August 31, 2007 Stratham, New Hampshire - Before I knew anything about the worldwide animal mutilation mystery linked to non-humans, I remember the first time I ever thought seriously about something from outer space coming to Earth and actually interacting with people. It was 1975, and I watched a TV program called “The UFO Incident.” It was a docudrama re-enactment of the alleged UFO and non-human encounter that Betty and Barney Hill described occurring in the White Mountains of New Hampshire on September 19th to 20th, 1961 – 46 years ago. [ Editor's Note: The couple was portrayed by James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons in the 1975 television movie The UFO Incident, and by Basil Wallace and Lee Garlington in the 1996 television series Dark Skies. ] The UFO Incident so provoked my interest that I got the book the broadcast was based on. That book is, An Interrupted Journey written by John Fuller and first published in 1966 in cooperation with Betty and Barney Hill and the psychiatrist who did their hypnosis, Benjamin Simon, M. D., in Boston. Dr. Simon did eleven hypnosis sessions with Betty and Barney Hill, beginning on February 22, 1964, and ending four months later on June 27, 1964. The reason the Hills asked Dr. Simon for help was Barney’s physical and mental deterioration and suffering after the September 1961 encounter. So, Dr. Simon began the first two hypnosis sessions with Barney, who was very soft-spoken and repressed. As a reality check on Barney’s fear and panic about cat-eyed, grey-skinned beings literally capturing Barney and Betty from Route 3 where they were driving in the New Hampshire "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"mountains, Dr. Simon also hypnotized Betty. Those hypnosis tapes recorded by Dr. Simon were the heart of a research project by Betty’s niece, Kathleen Marden. Kathy wanted to compare what Barney and Betty had said in their separate hypnosis sessions with Dr. Simon – and to travel the route herself from Franconia Ridge and Indian Head in the White Mountains to the Hill’s home in Portsmouth. Kathleen amassed reams of meticulous notes, family photographs and had her own memories of being with her aunt and uncle, Betty and Barney, many times after the 1961 encounter – until Barney’s unfortunate and early death in 1969 and Betty’s in 2004. Kathy asked long-time UFO investigator and nuclear scientist, Stanton Friedman, to help her create a book. Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience: The true story of the world's first documented alien abduction , co-authored by Kathleen Marden and Stanton Friedman, was published in August 2007. The title is what Barney said to Betty that fall 1961 night in great fear. He had stopped the car and got out with his binoculars. He was looking at a disk-shaped craft about 80 feet above him. There in a window back lighted by blue-white light, he could see a grey-skinned humanoid wearing a hat who had eyes like a cat’s with vertical pupils. Barney felt the cat-eyed being's eyes were taking hold of Barney’s mind and mentally warning him not to reach for the gun he carried in his pocket. Then Barney had the distinct feeling he and Betty were going to literally be “captured” by the cat-eyed entity. Historically, Betty and Barney Hill were the first documented case in what has come to be known as the \"human abduction syndrome\" in which non-human entities take humans from bedrooms, cars, yards, parks and other human environments into round rooms aboard what the human abductees assume are craft from outer space controlled by the non-human entities. During these events, human subjects often describe medical examinations, extractions of sperm or ova, mind downloads to and from the aliens, and sometimes learning sessions in front of 3-dimensional screens, holographic spaces or wall maps.

Image from Kathleen Marden. Professional Backgrounds of Betty and Barney Hill Kathleen Marden told me that her aunt Betty Hill was a social worker for the State of New Hampshire. Barney was employed by the Boston, Massachusetts, post office making long commutes, and was also very involved in the civil rights movement. He was a civil rights leader and there is an archival collection about his political leadership at the University of New Hampshire in the Milnes Special Collections Library. Betty and Barney Hill were invited guests at Lyndon B. Johnson’s Presidential Inauguration. Betty and Barney were also involved with the Office of Economic Opportunity in founding the Rockingham County Community Action Program in New Hampshire and Barney was the first executive director of that program. Kathleen told me, \"I think it’s important that people know what highly credible individuals they were and how they never wanted this story to be made public. When newspaper writer, John Lutrelle, first approached them in August 1965 and wanted to interview them, they refused. When they realized he might go ahead anyway and do a newspaper article on them and their experience, they contacted two separate lawyers to attempt to prevent him from writing the article and publishing it. They were afraid that it would have a negative"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"impact on not only their reputations, but on their work in the community. They might even lose their jobs as a result of this sort of thing. Betty and Barney did not want public attention.\" So, I asked Kathleen how the John Fuller book emerged? Kathy explained, \"John Lutrelle published his articles starting October 25, 1965, in the Boston Herald Traveler. They ran for a series of five nights. This brought worldwide unwanted publicity to Betty and Barney and they decided for the first time to speak publicly. They spoke in a church in Dover, New Hampshire. There was an Air Force information officer there from Pease AFB who introduced them. [ Editor's Note: On September 21, 1961, Betty telephoned Pease Air Force Base in Portsmouth and Newington, New Hampshire, to report their UFO encounter. But fearing ridicule, Betty she withheld some details. On September 22, 1961, Major Paul W. Henderson telephoned the Hills for a more detailed interview, lasting about 30 minutes. Henderson's report, dated September 26, 1961, determined that the Hills had probably misidentified the planet Jupiter. His report was forwarded to Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's UFO research project.] John Fuller was at that lecture. He talked with Betty and Barney that evening and proposed that he be permitted to tell their story in a book in order to set their story straight. Much of what had been published in the newspaper was incorrect. So, Betty and Barney decided that since the story had already gone public against their wishes, and it was not having the negative impact they thought it would have, they would cooperate with John Fuller and permit a book to be written ( The Interrupted Journey © 1966 by John G. Fuller with Introduction by Benjamin Simon, M. D.) Recently I asked Kathleen what her aunt and uncle consciously remembered in the mountains and told the family back in 1961. I also asked her if I could share with the Earthfiles and Coast radio audiences some excerpts from the original 1964 hypnosis sessions by Dr. Benjamin Simon. She agreed. Interview: B etty and Barney Hill were returning from a brief vacation to their Portsmouth, New Hampshire, home on the evening of September 19, 1961. At Franconia Notch (green circle on map), a light that had been moving oddly in the sky came within 1,000 feet of their car and was a \"spinning, lighted craft.\" By Indian Head, the spinning craft pulled in front of their car about 80 to 100 feet high and Barney stopped the car in the middle of the road. Then the craft \"arced\" to a field away from the road only about 50 feet above the Hills. Through his binoculars, Barney could then see a humanoid at a disc window back lighted by blue-white light; the being's eyes had vertical pupils like a cat."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"B lue square is where Barney stopped car in middle of road after spinning disc craft came down near front of their car. That's where he and Betty saw the humanoids coming toward them. For the walk to the craft in upper left, Barney was \"supported\" by two beings who dragged him so that the tops of his shoes were scratched. At the clearing marked \"craft,\" was a large disc which Betty was afraid to enter, but the humanoids made them enter for physical examinations. Aerial and graphic overlays by Kathleen Marden. Kathleen F. Marden, retired public and private school teacher, education services coordinator and co-author with Stanton Friedman of the August 2007 book, Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience - The true story of the world’s first documented alien abduction: “All she told the family about was having a close encounter with a UFO in the White Mountains, New Hampshire. Consciously, only Barney had viewed the beings onboard the craft (through binoculars) and that is when he went to the field adjacent to the car with binoculars when the UFO shifted from hovering above the car to the adjacent field. Betty remained in the car and from what I can figure out, the interior light was on because the driver side’s door was open (Barney had gotten out with his binoculars). So, Betty didn’t observe the craft in the field and did not observe the beings on board. That was Barney. They had a conscious memory of having this spinning, lighted craft come within 1000 feet of them in Franconia Notch. It was traveling in a stair step pattern. It was bouncing forward and then receding and obviously spinning the entire time. When they were south of Franconia Notch in the area of Indian Head, Barney decided that he wanted to pull over to the side of the road to get a better look at this craft. Now, as he was looking for a place to pull over, the craft suddenly shifted ahead of them and hovered only 80 to 100 feet above their vehicle and just to the right of it. I llustration of aerial craft suddenly swooping in front of Betty and Barney Hill driving near Franconia Notch, New Hampshire. Car model should have been a brown 1957 Chevy Bel Air, instead of the 1964 in this illustration at UFOCase book. Barney at that point was forced to stop the car and he stopped it directly in the center of the road. An oncoming vehicle, if there had been one, wouldn’t have been able to pass by him. At that point, he took his binoculars, exited the car, looked at the UFO through the binoculars as it hovered above the car and it was only 80 to 100 feet above, as I said before, and Barney’s arms were jiggling. So, he stepped away from the car. Betty at that time was observing the craft through the car window. At that time, it had stopped spinning. It was a saucer-shaped craft. It had a double row of windows and there was a bright blue-white light coming from behind those windows. The craft then, in an arc-like fashion, glided to the adjacent field, which was to Barney’s"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"left. And he walked into that field to observe the craft through binoculars, while Betty remained in the car watching for oncoming traffic. When he was in the field, the craft then descended lower to within what Barney estimated was about 50 feet from him. He looked up at it through binoculars and observed beings standing in the window. I llustration after Barney walked to field to get closer look at aerial craft through his binoculars and he could see humanoids at windows back lighted by blue-white light. One of the humanoids was wearing a hat and had cat eyes with vertical pupils. Oil painting © 2007 by Patrick Richard. Very rapidly, all of them at once, except for one who remained in the window, turned and moved toward what appeared to be some type of panel on the other side of this hallway. As they moved to that panel, they started to do something with their arms. At that point, red lights started to telescope out of the sides, out of each side of the craft, on what appeared to be very short bat-like, fin-type wings (or struts). And something started to drop down from the bottom of the craft. B etty and Barney Hill later showed investigator Walter Webb and others Barney's drawing of the craft and humanoids at the back lighted windows as he saw the aerial object only about 50 feet above him through binoculars at Indian Head, New Hampshire, the night of September 19, 1961. The being in the window continued to look at Barney and was terribly frightening. Barney felt they were about to carry out some type of plan and he said it was the precision of their"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"movements that frightened him so badly. He attempted to pull the binoculars from his eyes, but he could not do so. Barney attempted to reach for his gun, but his arms would not move to his coat pocket. His arms kept going upward. Barney felt that he was being – or was in the process of losing his ability to take self-initiated action – that he was coming under the control of this (leader) being who was somehow communicating to Barney to stay where he was and keep looking (at the leader) – that no harm would come to him. U nder hypnosis, Barney Hill sketched humanoid he saw through his binoculars wearing a hat and scarf with cat eyes standing at one of the back lighted windows in the aerial craft the night of September 19, 1961, near Indian Head, New Hampshire. I llustration made at time of 1964 hypnosis sessions with Benjamin Simon, M. D., of the \"Leader\" Barney stared at through binoculars and who seemed to take control of Barney's mind. Illustration © 1964 by David Baker. At that point, Barney was terrified and felt that he was about to be captured. But Barney said on the (hypnosis) tapes, he didn’t know what they were going to capture him for. Then he managed to pull the binoculars down away from his face and to run, either laughing or crying hysterically – Betty was not sure which – back to the car and informed Betty that he thought they were about to be captured. Barney put the car into first gear and swiftly took off down U. S. Highway Route 3 – that’s the route they were traveling on, the major north/south route through northern New Hampshire at that time. Then, when they were within just a few blocks away from where they had stopped, the couple heard a series of what Barney referred to as ‘electronic buzzing’ sounds. Betty referred to them as ‘electronic beeping’ sounds that seemed to be bouncing off the trunk of the car. It caused their car to vibrate and this tingling, vibrating kind of feeling seemed to pass through their bodies as well.\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Hypnosis Excerpts February 22, 1964 to June 27, 1964 Barney Hill in hypnosis session at the Boston office of Benjamin Simon, M. D.: \"And I was being signaled to stop. I thought, ‘I wonder if there is an accident?’ I do have my gun and I’ll put my hand on it. And I became afraid that if I did think of my gun, I would be harmed. I saw a group of men and they were standing in the highway and it was brightly lit up as if it was almost daylight, but not day. It was not the kind of light of day, but it was brightly lighted and they were coming toward me.\" Betty Hill in hypnosis session at the Boston of Benjamin Simon, M. D.: “And these men started to come up to the car. They separated. They came up in two groups. When they started to do that, I got real scared. And the car motor died, the car stalled. And when the groups started coming up, Barney tried to start the car.\" Barney Hill: \"I thought I saw a cluster of 6 men because they came to me and 3 did not. I didn’t think of the man in the sky in the machine that I saw. I just saw these eyes and closed mine and I got out of the car and I put my left leg on the ground and two men helped me out and I did not walk. I felt like I was being supported.\" I llustration of Betty Hill being guided by non-humans through field near Indian Head, New Hampshire, on September 19, 1961, to landed craft © 2007 by Patrick Richard. Betty Hill: \"And I turn around and think, ‘Barney, wake up! Barney, why don’t you wake up?’ And he doesn’t pay any attention. The object was on the ground.\" Benjamin Simon, M. D.: \"THE OBJECT WAS ON THE GROUND?\" Betty Hill: \"I think it was the same one I was watching in the sky. There were trees, a path and this clearing. The object I could see just about filled up the clearing. And they are taking me up into the object. I don’t want to go on it! I don’t know what’s going to happen if I go on it. I don’t want to go on it!\" Barney Hill: \"That’s funny – I thought of my feet thumping on the ground and they are going up smoothly. But I’m afraid to open my eyes because I am being told strongly to keep my eyes closed and don’t open them. (Pause) I don’t want to be operated on.\" Betty Hill: \"The man beside me says to go on. He’s a little angry with me. He said, ‘Oh, go on! The longer you stay out here, the longer it’s going to take. You might as well go on and get it over with and get back to your car. We haven’t got much time either.’ So, I still don’t want to go. But each one takes an arm and I get sort of a helpless feeling. There wasn’t much I could do at this point except go along with them. And I go up the ramp. We go inside and there is a corridor to the left. We go up the corridor. There’s a room and they took me in the room. I’m standing in the doorway and turn around, waiting for the others to bring Barney in. But they don’t do this. They lead Barney past the door where I’m standing. So, I said, ‘What are you doing with Barney? Bring him in here where I am.’ The man says, ‘No. We only have equipment enough in one room to do one person at a time. If we"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"took you both in the same room, it would take too long.’ Non-Human Medical Examiner I llustration of the \"medical examiner\" © 2007 by Patrick Richard. Then, the doctor, the examiner, says he wants to do some tests. He wants to check my nervous system. He wants to find out how my nerves and his nerves are different. I think I hope I would never have the nerve to go around kidnapping people right off the highways like he’s done! He tells me to take off my dress and then before I hardly have a chance to stand up to do it, the examiner – my dress has a zipper down the back. And the examiner – the zipper goes down to my waist – and so I slip my dress off. I don’t have my dress or my shoes on. The next over from me is a stool and then sort of in the middle of the room is a table. It’s not up very high, about the height of a desk. I lie down on the table on my back and he brings over this - oh, how can I describe that? They are like needles. There is a whole cluster of needles and each needle has a wire running from it. I don’t know, they are coming out of a gadget on the end of these needles. I think it’s something like a TV picture screen. You know how a TV, when the picture’s not on, you get all these kinds of lines? Something like that. So, he puts me down on the table and they bring the needles over. They don’t stick the needles into me, but they touch me with the needles. I feel a needle touching and it does not hurt at all. It’s some kind of record they are making. I don’t know just what it is. Then they roll me over on my back and then the examiner has a long needle in his hand. And I see the needle and it’s bigger than any needle I’ve ever seen (very upset, crying). I ask him what he’s going to do with it? And he says he just wants to put it in my navel. (crying and gasping for air) Don’t do it! Don’t do it! But he sticks the needle into my navel. (cries) It’s hurting – take it out! Take it out! And then the leader goes over and he puts his hands in front of my eyes and he says I’ll be all right. I won’t feel it. And all the pain goes away."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"I llustration of \"Leader\" based on hypnosis description by Barney Hill © 1964 by David Baker. I asked the leader, ‘Why did they stick the needle in my navel?’ And he said it was a pregnancy test!

The first Down's Syndrome amniocentesis diagnosis was made in 1968 in New York. By the 1980s, ultrasound devices were routinely used to guide the needle visually within the womb.

And some of the other men come in and with them is the examiner. And they are quite excited. I asked the leader, ‘What’s the matter? Did something happen to Barney?’"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"And the examiner has me open my mouth and he’s checking my teeth and they (aliens) are tugging at them (Betty Hill’s teeth). And I asked him, ‘What are they trying to do?’ WHAT WERE THEY DOING? They were pulling, tugging at my teeth. And the examiner said he was very excited and he said that (Betty laughs) ... and he said they couldn’t take it (my teeth) out. Barney’s teeth came out and mine didn’t! (laughs ) And I was really laughing! (more laughing) I said that Barney had dentures and I didn’t and that’s why his teeth would come out. (laughs) Then they (aliens) asked me what were dentures? And I said that people, as they got older, lost their teeth. They had to go to the dentist and have their teeth extracted and they (dentist) puts in dentures. Betty Asks for Non-Human Book As Proof of The Hill's Experience I said to him that this had been quite an experience. It was unbelievable! No one would ever believe me and that most people didn’t even know he (alien) was alive (that there was other living intelligence in the universe). What I needed was some proof that this really happened. He laughed and asked what kind of proof did I want, what would I like? And I said if he could give me something to bring back with me, then people would believe it. And so he told me to look around and maybe I could find something I would like to take. And I did. It wasn’t much around, but on the cabinet there was a book – a fairly big book. So, I put my hand on the book and said, ‘Could I have this?’ He told me to look in the book and I did. They have pages with writing, but not like anything I’d ever seen before. It looked almost like - I don’t know – it wasn’t a dictionary. Maybe – I don’t know – the writing did not go across. It went up and down. It had sharp lines and they were, some were very thin and some were medium and some were very heavy. It had some dots. It had some straight lines and curved lines. And I was taking it to read. This was going to be my proof that this happened. This was my proof! The leader said I could have the book if I wanted it. I picked it up and I was delighted. This was more than I had ever hoped for! And I’m standing there and I’m saying I’ve never seen anything like the book and I was very pleased he had given it to me and that maybe some way in time I could figure out how to read it. So then I asked him where he was from. I said that I knew he was not from the Earth and I wanted to know where did he come from? And he asked me if I knew anything about the universe? And I told him, ‘No.’ I knew practically nothing. \"Leader\" Opens Star Map for Betty Hill So, the Leader said that he wished I knew more about this and I said I wished I did, too.

It was not square. It was a lot wider than it was long. There were all these dots on it. And they were scattered all over it. Some were little, just pinpoints. Others were as big as a nickel. And there were lines. On some of the dots, there were curved lines going from one dot to another. There was one big circle and it had a lot of lines coming out from it, a lot of lines going to another circle quite close, but not as big. These were heavy lines. And I asked him what they meant. He said the broken lines were expeditions. So, I asked him where was his home port? And he said, ‘Where are you on this map?’ And I looked and laughed, ‘I don’t know.’ So, he said, ‘Well then, if you don’t know where you are, there would not be any point in my telling you where I am.’ \"Supervisor\" Orders B ook Be Taken from Betty"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"S horter humanoid who seemed to be the \"Supervisor\" over the \"Leader\" and the \"Medical Examiner, who ordered the alien book to be taken back from Betty Hill.
