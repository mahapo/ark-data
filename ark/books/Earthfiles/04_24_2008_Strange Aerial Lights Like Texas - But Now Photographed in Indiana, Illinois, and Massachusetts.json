April 24, 2008 Kokomo, Indiana; Oswego, I llinois; and Granville, Massachusetts - At 4:37 AM Central on Friday, April 18, 2008, at an epicenter 38 miles northwest of Evansv ille, Indiana (38.450°N, 87.890°W), a magnitude 5.2 earthquake at 7.2 miles deep s hook sleeping residents from Bellmont, Illinois, to St. Louis, Missouri, Des Moines, Iowa, Michigan, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Kansas and Georgia nearly 900 miles away. Indianapolis International Airport closed down for an hour while the control tower was evacuated. This was the first strong earthquake in the Midwest since 1968. E picenter of 5.2 magnitude earthquake at 4:37 AM Central on April 18, 2008, was 38 miles northwest of Evansville, Indiana (38.450°N, 87.890°W) and 7.2 miles deep. Two days before on April 16, 2008, in Kokomo, Indiana, northeast of the epicenter, residents between 10:25 and 10:40 PM Central, flooded the 911 emergency center with 146 phone call reports about bright lights in the sky and a loud explosion or boom that violently rattled houses "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"and windows. Authorities were quick to say it was “a midair mistake Wednesday night” when at least two F-16 jets in routine training exercises with the Indiana Air National Guard went too fast at 10,000 feet and caused a sonic boom on the ground. K okomo, Indiana, has a population of 46,000 and is about 50 miles north of Indianapolis. But MUFON received a series of alleged UFO sightings on the night of April 16, 2008, from Kokomo residents Here is one example: “At approximately 10:30 PM on the night of April 16, I was in the living room watching TV and my husband had gone to bed. There was a huge boom that rattled the front window. My husband asked what the noise was and I went to the front door to see. Off to the west there appeared a large object with lights all the way across it. It reminded me of a hair barrette with lights. It seemed to be hovering, yet the lights appeared to turn. My husband came out to stand behind me just in time to see the lights reappear from right to left until 5 lights were showing. Then it did it for a second time before it disappeared. The lights we saw with the naked eye were yellowish-orange in color. “If you click on www.WWKI.com (see 5 photos below), click on the article about the Boom and the bright lights. You will see pictures that someone submitted.The fourth picture down is exactly what I saw when I first looked out. This was no meteor orF-16. They don't hover. We could not take our eyes off of it and my husband, who is a Viet Nam veteran and a retired deputy sheriff, said he had never seen anything like it. We are both certain that what we saw was unidentifiable. The next morning, when I went out to get the newspaper at a little after 5 AM, I looked off into the west in the same vicinity. There, in front of the moon was a huge V-shaped dark cloud that reminded me of a flower vase with a lot of much smaller jet trails near it.” Source: MUFON. The next day, WWKI Radio 100.5 in Kokomo, Indiana, posted the following images on its website under the headline: “Big boom! Lights in the sky?

On April 18, 2008, I received this email from Courtney Lynne Wilson-Merr ill, a professional photographer who lives and works in Holyoke, Massachusetts: Subject: Large area UFO sighting over Western Massachusetts Date: April 18, 2008 1:15:39 PM MDT To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com Hello Linda. A few friends of mine contacted me last night (April 17, 2008, around 10 PM Eastern), as they were watching two light formations in the sky last night over Granville, Massachusetts. They said the lights were in triangle formations, very large and flickering and \"twinkling\" red, blue, green, and white colors. It appeared to be about two crafts and they were causing such a spectacle the entire neighborhood where my friends live were outside watching it. When my friend contacted her daughter (in Springfield, MA) about it she said they were watching the same thing over there and a whole bunch of people were out staring at the sky. I live in Holyoke, MA. and didn't notice anything up here. It seems to have hovered from the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"southwestern part of Massachusetts up to the Springfield area. It seems very similar to what was spotted over Texas recently and might be worth looking into. - Courtney Lynne Wilson-Merrill Then the next night on Friday, April 18, around 10 PM, Courtney's friend, Dan Vierno, in Granville about twenty minutes southwest from Courtney's residence in Hol yoke, called to say there were two more bright lights with spinning colors above trees near his house. Interview: Courtney Lynne Wilson-Merrill, Professional Fine Arts Photographer, Holyoke, Massachusetts: “ I immediately grabbed my camera, tri pod and my husband and was out the door (in pajamas). I drove right over there to Dan’s house. As we approached, from the road we could see a very bright object low in the sky. I knew that was exactly what everybody was looking at. My husband was trying to park and I jumped out of the car. Dan immediately grabbed me by my shoulders, handed me binoculars and pointed into the sky. I was looking at a great big ball of white light just above the tree line and it was flashing with colors. When we looked at it through binoculars, you could clearly see colored lights swirling around inside like blue, green, red, pink and gold. And it kind of reminded me of those flashing light toys they sell at Disney World for the parades. REALLY VIVID COLORS? Yes. It was beautiful, like a bright pink, and red and green and blue and gold. It looked like it was moving downward ever so slightly into the trees. SOME PEOPLE HAVE COMPARED A COUPLE OF THE UNUSUAL LIGHTS IN TEXAS (JAN – FEB 2008) WITH A MERRY-GO-ROUND INSIDE A SPHERICAL OR DISC-SHAPED LIGHT THAT HAD SPINNING COLORS BEHIND A GAUZY, SILVERY SURFACE. That’s exactly it – mostly white-silvery and then on the inside it was moving like a carousel in a circular motion of colored lights.

Courtney Videotape, April 18, 2008, Granv ille, Massachusetts “Here are the links to the three videos I shot with my new camera: • Canon G7 with • 35-210mm (35mm equiv) lens • F2.8-4.8 • 6x optical zoom http://youtube.com/watch?v=Jp0PKX5-BeY The first video I shot after I looked through the binoculars and saw the colors and was really excited because I began to question why it was there and what it was doing. So, I just grabbed my camera and started recording the light without my tripod, which is why the first video is really jumpy. After that video finished, I got my tripod and set that up on Dan’s front lawn and that’s when I took the second video. WHY IS VIDEOTAPE #2 SO BLUE AND FUZZY? In that one, I zoomed in, but the camera has auto focus and wouldn’t focus on anything, so it looks only like a light ball out of focus. [ Courtney does not know if her new camera can change to manual focus.] At the end of one of the videos, I think you can hear me say I could try taking a long exposure photo to see if the object was moving, because we were not sure. That’s the photo I sent you that has the downward curve to it and I was at either a 15 or 30 second time exposure.” Courtney's Still Frame Time Exposure"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"T ime exposure (15 or 30 seconds) on Friday, April 18, 2008, in Granville, Massachusestts, shows through the tree branches the very bright light that changed colors.

Both images © 2008 by Courtney Lynne Wilson-Merr ill. “There was a second object to the right of the first white ball, and the second one was mainly orange glow with the same colored lights dancing in the middle. I tried to photograph that second one, but it didn’t come out well. You can’t really see it. HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE THERE? There was my husband and me. Rich Guzman was not there that night, but was talking by cell phone with Dan Vierno. Others were Dan’s girlfriend, Bridgette, and one of Bridgette’s girlfriends, and a new neighbor across the street. So six of us there and Rich was at his house further up the mountain about five minutes away. He could see the same two lights from his place. We watched that as long as we could, about 90 minutes. I went over in just my pajamas, so I got pretty cold. I think it was still out there when we went inside to talk about what might be happening. HOW UNIQUE WAS THIS TO YOU? It was completely different than the stars because we were comparing the stars, looking through the binoculars. Then we would go back to the stars. The object was a lot brighter and bigger – maybe five times bigger than the stars – and it had the swirling carousel of colors on the inside. It didn’t look like anything astronomical at all. The first object was moving down and the amber orange one wasn’t moving at all. In comparison to some of the star formations, the amber one didn’t move with the constellations. It just stayed there.” I told Courtney that Erath County Constable, Lee Roy Gaitan, in Dublin, Texas, described one unidentified aerial object that he saw and videotaped on February 2, 2008, as “a spinning sun or"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Jupiter planet throwing off colored strobe lights.” [ See: 021408 Earthfiles ] Other Texas eyewitnesses said it was like looking at a merry-go-round covered with silver-white Christmas tree lights turning inside of a hazy, gaseous surface that kept changing colors. Courtney immediately said, “ That's it! It was mostly a silvery-white light that had colored lights changing inside of it.” Granville's Richard Guzman Sees More Pulsing Lights On Sunday, April 20, 2008 Richard “Rich” Guzman is 39-years-old, with a background as a computer salesman and now is a detail mechanic for van servicing in Granville, Massachusetts. His house is a bout five minutes up the road from Dan Vierno's and is more isolated in the Granville mountains. An odd, colorful, flashing light first caught his attention from his bedroom window on Tuesday, April 15, 2008. Rich couldn't figure out what the light was that night and was even more surprised when his friend, Dan Vierno, called him on Thursday night, April 17, and told Rich to go outside to see at least five bright, flashing lights. Interview: Richard “Rich” Guzman, Van Detail Mechanic, Granville, Massachusetts: “April 17th, I had a phone call from my friend, Dan. And Dan said, ‘Rich, you’ve got to look up in the sky. There’s something up there and I don’t know what it is. But I definitely think there are definitely UFOs up there.’ I said, ‘UFO? What are you talking about?’ I’m looking up into the sky and I’m seeing these flashing lights and I grab my binoculars and he's on the phone with me at the same time (each in different part of Granv ille). He says, ‘What are you seeing?’ I said, ‘I see these flashing, silver lights and they go from silver to red, and then they went to blue.’ HOW MANY WERE IN THE SKY AT THE SAME TIME DOING THE ODD COLOR FLASHES? For me, what I witnessed? I’m going to say at least five or more. WERE THE FLASHING LIGHTS IN ANY FORMATION PATTERN? I saw three of the lights in a long triangle – it was like one was pointed west, another light was pointed north and one was pointed south. It was weird because the triangle was long - not facing downwards, but sideways. THREE OF THE PULSING LIGHTS FORMING THEMSELVES INTO A FORMATION OF A LONG TRIANGLE? Yes, exactly. The one that I saw really vivid, it was moving and doing this little jagged movement - like it was moving a little bit and then staying in one spot. Moving a little bit and then staying in the same spot. I don't know, I’ve never seen anything like it in my life. IF YOU HAVE ONE LONG TRIANGLE FORMATION OF THREE OF THEM, WHAT WERE THE OTHER PULSING LIGHTS DOING? WHAT PATTERN WERE THEY IN? In the triangle formation, they didn't really move. But there was one I found separate that was bigger and more vibrant. That's the one I saw move just a little bit and stay still and then move a little bit and then stay still. Then I could see just like a silver-whitish color. It’s weird. It’s hard to describe it. But I do recall when Dan was talking to me, it was like, ‘Rich, I saw blue lights and red lights and I think Dan said green, too. But I saw red and blue lights. For me, they are still out there! (laughs) That’s what I’m thinking. I told Dan that and he came up here yesterday night and they were still up there, but they were moving towards the west. YOU MEAN THAT YOU ALL SAW THIS SATURDAY NIGHT, APRIL 19, AS WELL? Yeah. Then the lights were moving more towards the west. And I’m seeing one right now. I’m outside right now and I’m seeing it. I’m focusing my binoculars – yep, there it is! I’ll be a son of a gun! It’s mostly silver right now. It’s flashing lights – they look like Christmas lights. And it’s not. It looks like little crystal silver lights with a yellowish tint. And it’s flashing. IT’S SILVER NOW?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Yes, it’s silver now. SO, THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU ALL SAW ON APRIL 17 AND 18 and 19? Yes, there it is. Looks green. Now it’s flashing. What is that?! SO, IT’S CHANGED FROM SILVER TO GREEN. Ye s . NO MOVEMENT OF THE OBJECT? No, it's not moving. It's staying still. DO YOU HAVE ANY WAY TO PHOTOGRAPH IT? No, I don't. Wish I did. I just saw red flashing lights! And now it's back to silver. DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY YOU COULD CALL AND SAY, ‘COULD YOU GET A CAMERA WITH A LENS ON THIS AND TAKE SOME PHOTOGRAPHS?’ It's kind of hard for me because I'm up in the mountains, so there aren't really any neig hbors. There might be another light there, but it's hard to tell because it's clo udy. TWO OF THEM ARE SORT OF BELOW THE CLOUD CEILING? Yeah, I think I just found a third one. SO, THEY HAVE TO BE UNDER THE CLOUD COVER. Yeah, there's the other one. There are three of them now. THEY ARE ALL DOING THE SAME THING? Yeah, mostly silver and then flashing red and then flashing bluish-green like. That is so bizarre! ALL OF YOU ARE CONVINCED THAT YOU ARE WATCHING SOMETHING THAT IS NOT ASTRONOMICAL OR MILITARY? No, this is like flashing colored lights and - no way! This is the strangest thing I've ever seen since I was born on this planet - I'll tell you that much. I have never, ever seen anything like this - at all!” Oswego, Illinois Digital Still Image on April 5, 2008 F lashing light photographed through telescope around 11:45 PM Central, in Oswego, Illinois, on Saturday, April 5, 2008.

On April 18, 2008, I received the email below from Brandon Johnson about a very unusual digital photograph his niece, Gabrielle J ohnson, had taken on Saturday, April 5, 2008: Subject: Stephenville Lights in Illinois? Date: April 18, 2008 2:03:31 PM MDT To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com Here is the picture that Gabby (my niece) took on Saturday night, April 5, (in Oswego, Illinois). I have included the email description of the event that I asked Gabby to send me as well. I hope to hear from you in some capacity to confirm the importance of the event in relation to the Stephenville Lights. It sure l ooks the same and her description matches as well, including the colors match very well. If it's the same type of UFO, as it appears to be (in Stephenville, Rose Glen and Dublin, Texas), maybe the “ military” theory is falling apart. Ga bby mentioned to me that she and her friend were watching planes in the sky when they noticed the UFO. It was silent, visible to the naked eye, and flashing the color pattern she describes over a 15-minute period. Here is Gabby's email to me, Friday, April 11, 2008: “Brandon, When we saw the thing, it was Sat. April 5, at 11:45 PM, I want to say. We thought it was a plane because there were a lot of planes in the sky that night. But we noticed it wasn't moving, so we ran inside and got the telescope. It didn't help.Then we thought that we could take a picture (through the telescope lens), and so we did. After we took a picture, it was even stranger. The thing was turning colors and I remember what they were ... Blue, Green, Red, Purple ... in that order. We looked up on the computer to find anything like it, but we couldn't and there wasn't anything like it in my astronomy book. So that didn't help. Just north of the thing was (planet) Mercury. There were not many stars around the thing, either.

We were looking at the sky and all the stars and planes. Then we noticed something else and we didn’t know what it was, so we went inside and got the telescope. It didn’t really help much. So, we thought maybe we could get a camera and zoom in with it to see if we could see what it was. So, we started taking pictures of it and when we looked at the picture it was like blue, green, red and purple – very colorful and it looked like it was moving. Without the camera or anything, it looked like a giant, colorful star moving like back and forth slowly. WHAT CAUGHT YOUR ATTENTION IN THE BEGINNING? When we were on the trampoline, what really caught my eye was when we were looking up and it was like the brightest thing in the sky. WHEN YOU SAY BRIGHTEST, DO YOU MEAN A WHITE, LIKE SIRIUS, OR A DIFFERENT COLOR? Yes, it was like white, but around it was like bluish and greenish and red and purple. DID YOU SEE ANY MOTION IN IT AT ALL? Yes, but just a little bit. It was kind of like back and forth and up and down a little bit. SO, IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT LIKE A STAR OR PLANET? No. WHAT WERE YOU SEEING THROUGH YOUR TELESCOPE? It was very bright and big and colorful. It was very strange - a big, white color, kind of shiny, silvery thing in the sky, and it had blue, green, red and purple around it kind of flashing in that order: blue, green, red and purple. That’s what we saw. SO DID THE ENTIRE ROUND OBJECT CHANGE COLOR? Yes, it would change to a very light blue and then a very light green and very light red - almost pink - and then very light purple. HOW DID YOU ATTACH YOUR CAMERA TO THE TELESCOPE? We were holding it as still as possible right next to a tree, so we were leaning on the tree a little bit so we weren’t moving. And holding it as steady as possible to take a picture. AGAINST THE LENS PIECE? Ye s . WERE YOU AND YOUR FRIEND SURPRISED WHEN YOU SAW THE PICTURE? Yes. When we first saw it, we didn’t know what it could have been. We were trying to think about it the whole night. It’s very strange. YES, WHAT IMPRESSES ME IS THAT IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE COLORED BEADS STRUNG TOGETHER? Ye s . HOW DID IT GO FROM PULSING, CHANGING COLORS, TO BE A PHOTOGRAPH THAT LOOKS LIKE A STRING OF COLORED BEADS? Right. HOW FAR AWAY DO YOU THINK IT WAS? It looked pretty far south of Oswego up in the sky where the Swan constellation is. We went in the house for awhile to check the internet and my astronomy book to see if we could find anythng like it. But we couldn't, so we went back outside.
