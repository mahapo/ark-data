Mutilated bull found August 31, 2007, by Ansley, Nebraska, ranch owner Guy Mills, Sr. - the Mills family's second bull mutilation since June 2006. November 8, 2007 Chelan County, Washington - On November 6, 2007, Charles and Linda Everson were driving back to their hotel near Manson in Washington State when a 600-lb rodeo cow fell out of the sky and landed on the front of their minivan, denting it badly but leaving the lucky couple unhurt. A 600-pound cow fell 200 feet from a cliff above roadway near Manson, Washington, landing on this minivan driven by Charles Everson, Jr. Ironically, the Eversons had been out celebrating their first wedding anniversary. Chelan County Sheriff's Sergeant Mike Harris said the animal was a Professional Bull Rider- registered cow that had escaped its ranch about a month ago and apparently fell from the top of the 200-foot-high-cliff above the highway. Todd County, Minnesota - Only four days before on November 2, in Todd County, Minnesota northwest of Minneapolis, a pet horse was found dead and mutilated in a way that reminded me of the famous Alamosa, Colorado, mutilated horse back in September 1967 that was found stripped of flesh from the neck up. Todd County Sheriff Pete Mikkelson said about this recent horse that its skull had been skinned, one eyeball had been removed and that the killing was “ very strange.” Since 2006, the Minneapolis/St. Paul region has had a string of unusual animal deaths, including the beheadings of a bird, cat and dog. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Walworth County, Wisconsin - Another bizarre beheading was reported on October 10, 2007, in Delavan, Wisconsin, northwest of Chicago. Walworth County Sheriff's Deputies are trying to figure out who, or what, cut the head off a 5-day-old alpaca in southern Wisconsin. The owner, Tana Ward, found her missing 17-pound-baby alpaca in her family’s pasture with its head severed. At first, she thought it was killed by a coyote, but there were no bite or scratch marks. Police determined the head was severed cleanly and are puzzled because Alpacas have breeding and fur value, but the alpaca head is of little use. Investigators so far have no suspects, witnesses or motive. other animal beheadings have been reported in the area. Sherman and Custer Counties, Nebraska - T he Guy Mills ranch is in Ansley (red circle) with some pasture sections in Custer County and some in Sherman County. October 27, 2007 - Mutilated 8-Month-Old Heifer This past week I received an email from Guy Senior and Elsie Mills in Ansley, Nebraska. On October 27, their son and ranch partner, Guy Mills Junior, discovered one of their finest 8-month-old heifers dead and mutilated. Her left ear and left eyeball along with the eyelids had been cleanly excised without blood. The tongue was also removed along with the lips and jaw flesh. The heifer’s udder had been cut out hide-deep in an oval pattern. Her rectal and vaginal tissues had also been cut away only hide-deep in an oval pattern. Her tail had been removed at the base of the heifer’s spine. August 31, 2007 - Mutilated Bull Only two months before that on August 31, 2007, the Mills found one of their big, valuable bulls lying on its left side dead and mutilated in the same pasture as the heifer. That bull’s penis had been removed with a clean, hide-deep, circular excision. M utilated bull found August 31, 2007, on the Guy M ills ranch in Ansley, Nebraska. Guy Mills Sr. estimated the bull had been dead for only 24 hours.

In addition to the penis and testicles, the bull’s right ear and right eye had been excised. Right above the removed eye was also an excision only hide-deep in the shape of a half circle (see red arrow below). That was a very common finding in cattle mutilations throughout North America in the 1970s. H alf circle of hide removed above the right eye (red arrow) where the eyeball had been removed. Right ear excised at skull, tongue removed along with upper and lower lip tissue. The tongue had been removed from deep inside the throat and the upper and lower front lips were cut cleanly away. The bull's rectum had a hide-deep oval of hide removed. Guy Mills Senior and Junior looked all around the bull’s body for tracks, signs of struggle – for any evidence – and found nothing. June 2006 - Mutilated Bull Still Warm to Touch The father and son told me this week they feel scared and haunted because they lost another bull a year ago in June 2006 the same eerie way. Guy Senior had gone out at 5:30 AM to turn on the water hydrant for his cattle because there was a severe drought. That’s when he saw the bull down on the ground. Guy said the animal was still warm to touch and its jugular vein on the neck had a single, small hole that was bubbling a little blood. Guy immediately dialed 911 on his cell phone to the Sherman County, Nebraska, Sheriff’s Department. Deputies arrived and confirmed bloodless excisions of the bull’s left eye with a crescent of flesh was removed hide-deep above the eye; the tongue was gone, the lips and jaw flesh were gone, the penis and testicles had been neatly removed and the rectum was cored out."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"J une 2006, mutilated bull on Guy Mills farm in Ansley, Nebraska, found at 5:30 AM was still warm to touch when Guy Mills found him. Photographs © 2006 by Guy Mills. The two bulls and recent heifer together were valued at about $10,000 and the Mills had no insurance on the animals. But more than the money, Guy Mills Senior and Junior want to know who, or what, has killed and mutilated their valuable animals – and about a dozen more in their county over the past couple of years. In fact, Guy Mills, Junior, now 48-years-old, has ranched all his life with his 78-year-old father. In April 2006, he was out planting corn with his neighbor the night before a cow was found dead and mutilated on the neighbor’s land. What the two ranchers saw that April 2006 evening was unlike anything either had ever seen in their ranching experiences and Guy Mills Junior thinks it was related to whatever did the mutilation. Interview: Guy Mills, Jr., Rancher, Ansley, Nebraska: “We were out planting one night – come very close to catching whatever it was. I have one of these GPS (Global Positioning) on my tractor. You use the satellite to collect harvesting data. But another offshoot from it is I can put it with my planter and I get perfect rows, day or night. So, I said, let’s go try it out in the night and have some fun. This was in April of 2006. The moon was full that night. We were out there planting. We were on this one pivot where the way the topography was in this area made it about 150 feet above what you would call the flood plane. We got up on top of the hill in the middle of the night. My friend and I stopped up there and were visiting. Then we had seen these exceedingly bright lights. It was a white light unlike anything I’d ever seen. And we said, ‘My gosh, my neighbor’s got a cow in trouble!’ It’s got to be Duane Christiansen out there pulling a calf.’ And we said we wished we had those bright lights – I’d put them on my calving barn. I’d never seen such lights. Duane is a licensed electrician and I thought maybe he had gotten them. We went on to find out the next morning that he had one of his cows mutilated. That would have been in April of 2006. And we were about a mile and a half away from those lights. DID YOU HEAR ANY SOUND AT ALL? No, there was no sound. And it was such a brilliant light – it’s hard to describe because I had never seen anything like it before. But the white light was such brilliance! My friend"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"and I both remarked about it. COULD YOU HEAR ANY OF THE CATTLE BAWLING? No, none of the cattle. It was quiet. Nothing bawling that night. Of course, the tractors were running and we were visiting. But I would say it was a relatively quiet evening. His wife, who has since passed away, talked to my mother and said they took the cow’s udder and those sorts of things. NO BLOOD, NO TRACKS? No blood, no tracks. I tell you, though, Linda, we were probably as close to finding out what was doing it as anybody and it was just by accident. This is expensive. I don’t have insurance on these bulls. NOBODY EVER DOES. And it’s expensive. You add up the $9,400 on the bulls and the value of that heifer calf I’d say was probably $550. So that’s approaching $10,000 and that’s a lot of money to take out of your business. I visited with three law enforcement departments and made statements: the Sherman County, Nebraska, Sheriff; the Custer County, Nebraska Sheriff; and the Nebraska State Patrol located in Grand Island. I told them that if this had been considered a crime, like a local store or gas station robbed of $9,400, I said, ‘You (law) would have been all over it and you would have had all kinds of (patrol) cars out there and they would have found it. I said, ‘Now, it’s my bull (August 31, 2007) and we’re tax payers and this is our livelihood and whoever is messing with it and there have been some tough years with the drought and $9,400 is a lot to take out of your business.’ I told them I felt it should all be followed in a more disciplined approach where they could find out what is doing the killing. If it takes soil samples, that’s great. If it takes a necropsy on the animal, that would be great. I said, ‘Get the Nebraska Cattlemen’s Association involved. There’s money available there and we’ll all put money into it to help on the investigations to find out, using science and dispel emotion, so we can find out exactly what killed the cattle. It takes a lot to take a 2,000-pound bull down. I was telling all these guys this. We’ve worked around cattle all of our lives and you don’t just knock them down right away. We’ve got to find out what the cause of death was and use a complete science-based approach to it. WHAT DID THEY SAY? They thought that was a great idea, but I have not heard back from them. But I did talk to a Nebraska State Patrol officer in Arcadia in September and he told me I could talk to this Ida – and she’s somebody you might want to talk with. Her job is to investigate mutilations. YOU REQUESTED THAT THERE BE SOME KIND OF FORMAL AND SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION OF YOUR MUTILATED HEIFER, BUT TO DATE AS WE’RE TALKING ON THE NIGHT OF NOVEMBER 5TH, 2007, YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY FOLLOW UP FROM ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT OR VETERINARIAN? None. None since I started in June 2006 when I made my first complaint of it (first bull mutilation) and then the one in August (August 31, 2007), I really complained hard. ON THE BULL. On the second bull. I said, ‘You guys have got to do something!’ And they haven’t done anything. I don’t know why they really don’t (do anything). Some people are going to say it’s coyote. Well, we’ve had animals die from everything in our close to 130 years in this area – everything imaginable, we’ve had cows die of. And yes, coyotes do attack. But this is NOT a coyote or any predator and I said, ‘Let’s just find out what the facts are.’ WHAT DID LAW ENFORCEMENT SAY TO YOU ABOUT OTHER ANIMAL MUTILATIONS THEY HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT? This one State Patrolman said his dad owned a ranch and he said he knew all about it. He said, ‘Yes, I do believe it. I’ve seen it on our own ranch.’ That’s why he gave me Ida to talk to in Grand Island."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"They (law enforcement) are in a large respect reluctant. But in the state of Nebraska, it’s a felony for anything past $600, and I told them that. I made reference to some kids who shot at deer and they (law enforcement) threw the book at them. They shot at ten deer, some high school kids, as a prank contest. Law enforcement made a big to do about it in the District Court. I said, ‘OK, they shot a few deer out of season. I said, ‘Hey, my bulls are here! This is what everyone in this area depends upon for their livelihood and income, but nobody has come out to investigate it. HOW MANY ANIMALS DO YOU THINK HAVE BEEN MUTILATED IN THE ANSLEY, NEBRASKA, AREA OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS? A lot more than what people say and I know that because I’ve heard from employees of different ranches. But everybody is keeping it kind of hushed up. One of them is a friend of mine – he’s a bank director. They buried it (their mutilation) and said they weren’t going to talk about it. But it's a lot more than people say. WOULD YOU SAY A DOZEN? Oh, absolutely – more than that. See, we’ve got three (2 bulls and heifer). Our neighbor has one (cow), that’s four. Our other neighbor has two, that’s six. This is within 6 to 7 miles and you go down two more miles, and there is another one there, that’s seven within a small radius. See, our county is 90 miles across, so it would definitely be more than seven (mutilations in the whole county). WHY IS IT THAT YOU THINK EVERYONE WANTS TO COVER UP THESE BLOODLESS, TRACKLESS ANIMAL MUTILATIONS? You know, that’s an absolutely excellent question and I don’t have an answer other than I think it’s the culture. You know, if you go counter-culture on anything, whether you’re a war activist or whatever, you get labeled as a nut. I think there is a lot of that in law enforcement. You’re no longer a conformist if you’re a farmer and try to stand up. But I can’t answer your question for sure. AS LONG AS PEOPLE ARE SILENT AND BURY THE ANIMALS AND DON’T REPORT THEM AND DON’T DEMAND THAT NECROPSIES BE DONE, THEN THE SUBJECT REMAINS IN A KIND OF DARKNESS. Yes, it does and I’ve got to a point where enough is enough, you know? It’s just too expensive anymore to buy this kind of (high quality) bulls and have something like this, or the heifer. And it’s really bothered my family members and I don’t know. There are a lot more questions out there than answers. Government Insiders Say Perpetrators of Global Animal Mutilations are Extraterrestrial Biological Entities (EBENs) [ See: The Day After Roswell © 1998 by Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso) HAS ANYONE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT SUGGESTED TO YOU THAT EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES ARE RESPONSIBLE AND THAT’S WHY THEY WON’T DO ANYTHING? No, none of them did. IF THIS IS WHAT IS BEHIND THE GLOBAL ANIMAL MUTILATION PHENOMENON THAT IS BLOODLESS AND TRACKLESS AND TAKING THE SAME ANIMAL PARTS, WHAT CAN LAW ENFORCEMENTS OR GOVERNMENT DO? Well, if that was true, that would have to be one of the most significant findings in all of civilization. I mean since Jesus walked the Earth can you think of anything – I mean if you had proof of that, that would be more profound than anything that has happened in mankind. Why they (non-humans) do this, I don’t know. I really truly don’t. WELL, LET’S ASSUME THAT THE MILITARY PEOPLE ARE TELLING THE TRUTH THAT HAVE SAID, ‘YES, WE’RE DEALING WITH EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES (EBENS). AND WHAT YOU SAID IS PROBABLY TRUE THAT THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF THE MUTILATED ANIMALS IN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN HEMISPHERES IS THE LARGEST BODY OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF INTERACTION AND INTERFERENCE BY A NON-HUMAN PRESENCE."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS IT’S GOING ON, BUT THEY CAN’T STOP IT. THAT’S WHY THEY HAVE A POLICY OF DENIAL. OK. Well, what in the world would they (non-humans) want with my bull’s penis? THAT’S A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND THE ONLY ANSWER THAT I’VE EVER GOTTEN FROM PEOPLE IN MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE WORKING FOR THIS GOVERNMENT AND TALKING WITH ME OFF THE RECORD HAS BEEN A GENETIC HARVEST. AND WHEN I’VE ASKED WHAT IS THE GENETIC HARVEST FOR? THEY HAVE SAID, ‘WE DON’T REALLY KNOW.’ More Information: F ront Page, Sherman County Times , Loup City, Nebraska, September 5, 2007.
