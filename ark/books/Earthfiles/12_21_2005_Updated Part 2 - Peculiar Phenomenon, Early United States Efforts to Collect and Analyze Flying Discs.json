Army's actions either caused, or were a response to, offensive overt acts initiated by flying discs themselves.\" - J. Andrew Kissner Return to Part 1 Update : I received the e-mail below from an Earthfiles reader who has researched extensively the history of rocket development in the United States. E-mail December 22, 2005 to Earthfiles: \"Top Sail Island, North Carolina, was the first location that the military tested the rocket program pre-dating White Sands by some years. The military wants us to think that the first rockets were tested at White Sands, but \"Project Bumblebee\" shows that the U.S. had missiles long before they got to White Sands. \"This would probably be the first time that has ever been reported and I feel it is most important because if you and anyone would try to establish that the military \"shot\" the UFO's down, someone on the skeptical side would say \"we did not have rockets that were that advanced back then\". I've heard people say that before. This would also back up all of Andy's good work as well. \"I traveled out to Top Sail Island a few years ago. The old bunkers and viewing towers are still there as well as a museum that has a very nice display and a movie that shows the old rocket tests. I asked the curator of the museum if most people are shocked to learn that White Sands was NOT the first test site and he told me that even retired military people from that time frame are shocked and fascinated when they learn how much rocket research and development went on there. The operation was run by John Hopkins University as a cover back then. \"The reason they moved to White Sands was the fact that the rockets were getting so advanced they were in danger of hitting the fishing fleets of the coast !!!!! ( they felt they could not keep it a secret with the new range of the new technology.\" Also see: December 4, 2004, Earthfiles about Project Bumblebee: According to history written by the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, \"In July 1944, the Navy's Bureau of Ordnance requested Section T of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) to study anti-aircraft missiles to counteract the Japanese Ohka piloted bombs and other suicide weapons sent against the United States in the Pacific. The requirement was for a missile to shoot down a plane at a range of 20,000 yards at an altitude of 30,000 feet.\" Four months later by November 1944, the Navy's Bureau of Ordnance assigned the Applied Physics Laboratory of the Johns Hopkins University in Silver Spring, Maryland, to undertake the development of radar-guided surface-to-air missiles. This project became known as Bumblebee which produced several ramjet-powered missiles which evolved from the 1945 STV to the 1951 Terrier to the 1958 Talos. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Original full-scale replica of America's first surface-to-air missile, the Supersonic Test Vehicle (STV), called Bumblebee, or the \"Flying Stovepipe.\" Demonstration flight was on October 16, 1945, Island Beach, New Jersey, and reached 1400 mph. Produced by Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Baltimore, Maryland. J . Andrew Kissner Introduction from Part 1, Peculiar Phenomenon, continued: T he Air Force's 1994 \"Research Regarding the Roswell incident\" did not mention several interesting points of fact that haven't been mentioned by anyone for half a century. Even in 1947, few heard about these details. They were only reported in local area newspapers. These stories for some reason never found their way to the national or even regional media. A commander of a U. S. Army installation, 120 miles south of the Roswell crash site, reported six days before Mac Brazel found a crashed flying disc that two U. S. Army personnel had seen two different flying discs about to crash. One was observed less than 60 miles south of the Mac Brazel ranch crash site. The same commander reported that he had ordered U. S. Army search parties to find two crashed flying discs outside the perimeter of his installation six days before Mac Brazel found his. The U. S. Air Force asserted in their 1994 report that no U. S. Army Air Force aircraft were involved in accidents in the Roswell area during the July 1947 period. However, research reveals that a U. S. Air Force P-80A jet fighter, serial number either PN-343 or PN-349, attempted to take off from an improvised landing strip on a New Mexico state highway less than 25 miles from the flying disc crash site. The jet failed to gain altitude on take off and flew directly into a gas station killing the pilot, a civilian and injuring three other civilians. That location was Carrizozo. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) sponsored a meeting with all local area law enforcement officers covering a four county area of rural, central New Mexico on July 21, 1947. The meeting location was near the Roswell flying disc crash site and where the P-80 crashed. The FBI encouraged local police to cooperate with federal initiatives in the area. The Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) announced three days after the recovery operation was under way north of Carrizozo that the public was not invited into the area due to \"continuing radiation studies.\" The Air Material Command (AMC) based at Wright Field, Ohio, deployed the United States's first surface-to-air missile system to southern New Mexico and west Texas during this same period from a test site at Wendover Field, Utah. The U. S.'s first operational surface-to-air missile battalion was activated at least 60 days prior to the reported flying disc crashes in central New Mexico at a site less than 150 miles south of the crash sites. That control of Alamogordo Army Air Field 80 miles south of the purported flying disc crash site was transferred to the AMC in the summer of 1947. The Commanding General responsible for the new surface-to-air missile system was transferred to the U. S. Special Weapons Project at Sandia Base in Albuquerque. The"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"General was responsible for \"special weapons\" security four days after the purported flying disc crash at Corona. The Commander of White Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico, Lt. Col. Harold Turner, was the same officer who reported two flying discs about to crash, was relieved of command less than two weeks after the flying disc recovery operation began and was replaced by a Brig. General. U. S. Army Ordnance's elite weapons intelligence unit, Enemy Equipment Intelligence Section (EEIS), was based at Ft. Bliss, Texas, and White Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico, in 1947. Its sole purpose was and is to \"collect\" advanced foreign technology for U. S. government researchers. The technology was analyzed to determine performance characteristics so that technological advances could be eventually integrated into U. S. weapons systems. The U. S. V-2 program, the precursor to both the U. S. space program and U. S. effort to build and deploy intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) was a project area of EEIS, headed by the legendary Col. Holger Toftoy at Ft. Bliss, Texas, in the summer of 1947. [ Editor's Note: Colonel Holger N. Toftoy was the Chief of Ordnance Technical Intelligence for the U. S. in Paris at the end of World War II. Col. Toftoy commanded the transfer of rocket hardware and documents from German scientists to the United States. That process included one-year contracts from the U. S. Army to German physicist, Werner von Braun, and his 126 colleagues in what was first called Project Overcast and later Project Paperclip. Most of the 127 German scientists were transported to Fort Bliss, Texas, by December 1945, where the U. S. Army established a guided missile proving ground that worked closely with the White Sands Missile Range in southern New Mexico. Then Col. Toftoy became Chief of the Rocket Branch in the Research and Development Division of Army Ordnance.] O n left, Colonel Holger N.

More than half of those mentioned as members of Operation Majestic-Twelve were members of one expert panel of the Joint Research and Development Board (JRDB) of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. That panel was the Upper Atmosphere Rocket Research Panel, the same group responsible for V-2 rocket testing at White Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico, in the summer of 1947. Historical research suggests something even more controversial. The U. S. Army's actions either caused, or were a response to, offensive overt acts initiated by flying discs themselves. It appears that flying discs could have been a contributing factor in"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"the deaths of over six hundred military personnel and civilians in 1947 - over a two month period. Whatever flying discs were, or are, they were not, and are not, defenseless. Their \"special weapons\" were unconventional by every definition. Flying discs were immediately defined by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1947 as advanced \"foreign weapons systems.\" due to flying disc performance characteristics, it was immediately assumed they were nuclear powered. 1946: Planes, Rockets, Satellites D iagram © RMC, Time Magazine, September 2, 1946. T he \"Roswell/Corona UFO crash\" was one of the first catastrophic military encounters with the alien technology and is the most well-documented case of U. S. government involvement available in the public domain. Flying discs were believed to have been defined by the Joint Chiefs of Staff before the Roswell incident as an advanced \"foreign weapons system.\" This definition immediately cloaked the phenomenon in the highest compartmentalized security classification in the United States lexicon concerning national security: a foreign, probably nuclear powered, weapons system. Let's assume that a flying disc did crash southeast of Corona, New Mexico. Why did it crash? Who were the military personnel and civilians at the scene? How did it get there? Where did it go? Who has it now? Some answers to those questions emerge in Peculiar Phenomenon."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Also consider how important such a discovery might have been. On a scale of one to ten with ten being the most significant, how important is the knowledge that non-human intelligent life exits? Let's assume the non-humans control technology that is more advanced than our own. would it be a three or a seven on the significance scale? Or is it possible that our national leadership might consider the discovery so important and potentially so threatening to the U. S. national security that the U. S. would create an entirely new military/security system to maintain that secret? Throw in the additional consideration that the technology can appear anywhere at any time without regard to national borders, security systems, defensive weapons, weather, or any other apparent physical constraints. How important do you think that kind of discovery would be? What level of classification would you give that knowledge? Let us assume one other thing: that flying discs possess offensive weapons that we did not, and still do not, totally understand. In addition, assume that they have demonstrated a willingness to use them - not randomly - but specifically against the United States. How important is this knowledge? How threatening is this knowledge? These questions reveal the perspective of American national security policy makers since at least the 1940s. Peculiar Phenomenon is the result of my research project intended to provide an overview of a five month period: May, June, July, August and September 1947. This research introduces the principals, complete with motives, involved in covert actions to collect and analyze the enigma known as flying discs, flying saucers, photographic meteorites, upper atmospheric anomalies, UFOs, UFObs, Unidentified Aerial Vehicles (AEVs), Unidentified Aerial Craft (AECs) or whatever other term is applicable. This book is intended to establish a framework for understanding the U. S. government's involvement. The story is based upon published accounts of the period, coupled with selected other materials that have only been publicly available beginning in the early 1990s. I have learned that truth is stranger than fiction. The term \"flying disc\" is used exclusively throughout this work. It is descriptive and was the original term employed by eyewitnesses to describe what had been observed. Beginning on June 24, 1947, and continuing through mid-July 1947, eyewitnesses in the western United States and then the rest of North America were describing \"flying discs.\" In daylight sightings, flying discs were described as being lens-shaped, like two convex lenses fitted together at their outer edges. When not illuminated, the flying discs were described as looking like \"brushed aluminum,\" stainless steel or other silver or gray metallic material. When traveling at high speed, the discs would sometimes emit an orange or white glow and occasionally a blue, glowing tail. When hovering, the discs moved in a peculiar weaving motion, \"like the tail of a kite\" or \"falling lea,\" skipping from one location to another in the sky at very high speed. at night, the discs were often described as looking like the headlight of an automobile, a full moon, or a star. The discs could hover, move slowly or at hyper-velocity. Some would hover for several minutes and then gain altitude with incredible acceleration and disappear, only to reappear again. Others were seen with a row of lights on the upper convex surface when viewed at close range. At times, one large flying disc would appear to burst into three or more separate pieces heading off in different directions. At times, in both total daylight and at night, the discs would be so bright that eyewitnesses thought the light would blind them. In all cases, the discs emitted no audible sound, either from a propulsion system, or when the discs accelerated. There was no confusion regarding the physical phenomenon: people said they saw \"flying discs.\" Only toward the middle of the \"great flying disc scare\" of 1947 was the term \"flying saucer\" coined by General Nathan Twining (MJ-4) and the U. S. Army Air Forces. Much later, they were referred to by the U. S. Air Force as \"Unidentified Flying Objects (UFObs),\" a much less precise term. It appears that flying discs were photographed, inspected, disassembled, blueprinted and warehoused by representatives of the President, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Atomic Energy commission in 1947. All that was retrieved has remained in U. S. custody for more than half a century. In many respects, efforts to explain the flying discs crash at Corona (Roswell) or elsewhere tend to overlook the obvious. Who is responsible for collecting all foreign weapons technology flying disc or otherwise? Military intelligence organizations supported by specialized military units. Who is responsible for analyzing all high, foreign, weapons technology? Relevant government research laboratories in collaboration with private and university labs. Who was made responsible for all nuclear weapons, nuclear technology and nuclear materials in the U. S. in the first four decades of the nuclear era? The Atomic Energy Commission by authority of the Atomic Energy Act of August 1, 1946, and subsequent amendments (See Appendix VII). The U. S. Department of Energy"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"subsequently assumed the AEC's role within the past decade. Obfuscation of these fundamental responsibilities serves the interest of those keeping this secret. The answer to the question is a specialized military unit supported by a scientific group, working with a laboratory administered by the AEC or, at a higher level, the National Security Council or, one level higher still, either the Office of the Executive Secretary of the National Security Council (NSC) or its Chairman. The NSC, discussed also as the \"permanent staff\" of the White House, is the ultimate organization, created one month after the recovery of the New Mexico flying discs, who is responsible for managing and maintaining U. S. national security interests (See Appendix VIII.) Flying discs organizationally appear to hover in close proximity to the permanent staff to the White House. What else would you expect? This is not the approach used in this project, but it does simplify the question. Rather the history of the era has been dissected and reassembled using published reports from \"newspapers of record\" correlated with recently declassified government documents and newly published authorized histories of several national research institutions. Correlation, as a research technique, is particularly useful when the subject being considered deals with government decision makers, who normally leave published detailed biographies and with the formation of public policy that, under normal circumstances, generates volumes of documentation. Applying this technique, the researcher possesses one overall assumption observed events occur that require explanation at the time of the event. The physical description of the event can be assumed to be relatively accurate, but the explanation of the cause of the event might be assumed to be inaccurate and possibly intentionally misleading. Using the technique, comparing the observed physical events of 1947 to the explanations available today, yields a somewhat more coherent understanding of the eras history than was provided to the public in 1947. It is particularly useful when two official documents or sources of information are at odds with each other - it points to an event, a relationship, or information that is potentially intentionally misrepresented and because it is being intentionally misrepresented it might be significant in explaining what actually occurred. It appears that beginning in early June 1947, there was a major misinformation campaign waged by the U. S. Army's Psychological Strategy Board, authorized initially by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) and eventually by the President. By June 25, 1947, significant events were occurring, reported in local newspapers, that weren't reported in the national media. Specifically this relates to reports of aircraft accidents. The footprints left by those engaged in this activity are visible today. It was organized at the national level. Interviews conducted in the field confirm that instructions were given by military officials to civilian eyewitnesses not to report what they had seen, that the event was a matter of national security - it was, to quote a local New Mexico weekly newspaper published during those weeks - a \"military emergency.\" There is little question that due to the inherent weaknesses of the correlation analytical technique, which necessarily generates rather broad associations, there could be some interpretive inaccuracies. The strength of the technique, however, is that it points to major potential relationships that should be considered by the reader. It should be remembered that this process is similar to putting a jigsaw puzzle together without benefit of having a picture of the assembled puzzle. There is no question that it's bizarre. There is also no question that by mid-June 1947, in the words of one unidentified White House assistant to President Truman, \"something is radically wrong.\" Examining events which occurred in mid-1947 yielded a clearer understanding than later periods because the intelligence infrastructure created to suppress public accounts of this phenomenon was not in place back then. Later attempts to cover-up what had been published in the open literature in the summer of 1947 were not totally successful. Very few during this early period knew what the peculiar phenomenon was and had no idea about what was to be discovered. Also, the level of classification associated with the cover-up project - which was operated directly under the President and the Joint chiefs of Staff from the very beginning - precluded others from \"being in the loop\" at the time of events and for decades afterward. Project management at the level of the JCS and the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) within the Executive Office of the President, explains why a Major in U. S. Army Air Forces Intelligence at Walker Field in Roswell, New Mexico, with the 509th Bomb Group (America's elite atomic bomb squadron) would not have been informed by his superiors that something useful was recovered after the Major discovered a crashed flying disc. The policy of denial was already operating at the level of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the President. The notion that a mild form of mass hysteria or dementia created the illusion of flying discs in some people is fiction that was first disseminated by General Curtis LeMay and his psychological advisor. General LeMay was Director for Research and Development for"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the Air Staff when on July 5, 1947, he had a press conference to discuss flying disc sightings - at the same time that one or more flying discs were crashing near Roswell. General LeMay suggested disc reports were caused by mass hysteria. [ Editor's Note: The USAF Military Museum states: \"In October 1947 General LeMay was selected to command the U.S. Air Forces in Europe with headquarters at Wiesbaden, Germany. He organized air operations for the Berlin Airlift. A year later he returned to the United States, assumed command of the newly formed Strategic Air Command, and established its headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. \"Commanding SAC for nearly nine years, General LeMay built from the remnants of World War II an all-jet bomber force, manned and supported by professional airmen dedicated to the preservation of peace. Under his leadership and supervision, plans were laid for the development and integration of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capability. \"In July 1957, the general was appointed Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force and served in that capacity until July 1961, at which time he was appointed Chief of Staff.\" ] N ovember 15, 1906 - October 1, 1990. USAF General Curtis Emerson LeMay. T he U. S. government's misinformation effort was considered necessary for at least three primary reasons: 1) to dissuade researchers from examining hard evidence left in the wake of our fist major and rather \"messy\" encounter with the phenomenon. The physical evidence existed in 1947 and exists today. 2) America's integrated command (IC) of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had a mission to \"collect\" several flying discs in central New Mexico during the summer of 1947. 3) The U. S. did not want to inform our primary early adversaries that the U. S. had succeeded in collecting an advanced \"foreign, possibly nuclear, weapons system.\" Public announcement would have alerted the military and scientific community about possible technical innovations that could be accomplished if the phenomenon was seriously studied. Perhaps Peculiar Phenomenon can help dissipate some of the government-induced stigma associated with honest inquiry about \"extraterrestrial biological entities\" and their advanced technologies. How many other events in human history have been witnessed by thousands of thoughtful people over weeks and months? Hundreds of eyewitnesses have been dismissed by simply saying, \"No, it did not happen.\" Or, \"No, you really did not see that. It was something else - maybe swamp gas or retina blood or a large ice crystal or a hail stone gliding to earth.\" The reader should appreciate that this work was reviewed by a number of individuals employed within the space research area of the United States government. Those insiders share a general sense of unease and disagreement with official U. S. policy of denial about the UFO phenomenon. Those people, who cannot speak publicly on the record, applaud the release of the material in this book.
