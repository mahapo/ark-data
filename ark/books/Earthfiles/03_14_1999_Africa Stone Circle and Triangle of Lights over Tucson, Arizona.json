Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon © 1999 by Linda Moulton Howe March 14, 1999 - Sahara Desert Circle of Rocks In the March 1999 issue of National Geographic, there is a photograph of a circle made from small, flat, dark rocks on beige sand in the Sahara desert of Africa. The perfect circle is actually a ri ng about two feet wide laid flat on the desert sand and stretching about 60 feet fr om one side of the ring to the other. Who put the dark stones down so neatly and perfectly flat is not known. The mystery does not end with the ring. Investigators have discovered that if they go about one mile from the ring of rocks, there are markers exactly north, south, east and west of the ring. The markers ar e also made of dark stones that form arrows pointing away from the circle in each of the four directions. So far, no one knows the age of the ring and arrows, who made them, or exactly what their purpose is. For listeners who want to see a photograph of the ring of rocks, you will find it in the National Geographic article entitled \"Journey to the Heart of the Sahara,\" in the March 1999 issue. Y2K and Nuclear Power Plant Safety In other news, Y2K tests are increasing -- and a recent one has people worried about the nuclear energy industry. In February, PECO Energy in Pennsylvania tested a system at the Peach Bottom nuclear power plant near York. The particular system for the Y2K test help s track the position of control rods that regulate the nuclear reaction. But when the year 2000 was fed through a computer, the rod tracking system shut down and could not be brought back on line for SEVEN hours. PECO reported this week that another follow-up test was successful and that more tests of other Peach Bottom Reactor units are continuing. Nuclear plants have until July 1st to give the Nuclear Regulatory Commission a detailed description of what Y2K-related work remains to be done at nuclear power plants, and when the work will be done. Already PECO says that two systems at the Peach Bottom nuclear power plant will NOT be fully Y2K compliant until fall of 1999. How many other nuclear power plants in the U. S. and around the world are facing the same problems? And what are the consequences if there are still computer system failures on January 1st, 2000? It's worth remembering that the nuclear meltdown at Three Mile Island here in Pennsylvania occurred 20 years ago on March 28, 1979. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Strange Lights Over Tucson, Arizona It's March and in Arizona people are seei ng odd lights in the sky again. Bill Hamilton, Executive Director of Skywatch International, and his Arizona Skywatch Director, June Scherrer, called me about new sighting reports. Thursday evening, March 4th at about 8:15 PM, Linda Revere was startled by a large triangular formation of lights in the sky not more than a mile from her home north of Tucson that sits at the far end of a subdivision near Sombrero Peak. She watched dumbstruck for about five minutes until she heard her husband drive into the garage and got him to look also. Two other family members also watched the strange triangle suspended motionless in the night sky while its lights pulsated. I talked with the couple, Linda and Ray Revere, and here is their firsthand eyewitness report from their home north of Tucson. Linda Revere, Sombrero Peak Subdivision, Tucson, Arizona: \"I was coming out our back kitchen door and I was thro wing a newspaper into the garbage can. All I did was lift the lid up and there it was. WHAT DID YOU ACTUALLY SEE? WHAT CAUGHT YOUR EYE? The lights. They were in a sequence and they were in a pattern and they looked like a constellation, but I knew they we ren't a constellation because I knew they couldn't be that bright and blinking. A nd also, awhile ago, we have been having the Jupiter, Mercury, Saturn, Venus alignment. And I was watching it before hand. And I came out and I looked at (this) and WOW! THIS WAS VERY DIFFERENT BECAUSE? Very different. It almost looked like Battlestar Galactica hovering over the mountain.\" Ray Revere: \"I had at least a minute and a half at looking at this thing with a pair of 12 x 50 binoculars. WHAT EXACTLY WERE YOU SEEING? What exactly were we seeing? We were seeing a series of nine lights that were confining the configuration of the ship. In other words, there were three lights on one side, three lights on another and three lights on another. And they were going around and blinking in a series. WHAT SHAPE DID THESE LIGHTS FORM? They were a triangular shape and the size of the ship was bigger than two of my fists at arm's length. It was a big object! I would say when we were looking at it, and I looked at it through the binoculars, that this thing was at least a football field. At least. MEANING IT WAS AT LEAST 300 F EET LONG? At least an entire football -- it was just incredible in size. The only thing about it was that it was so stealthy that if ot her people were to look up there, they wouldn't even have seen it. The blinking lights that were on the craft itself were"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"about as bright as Orion's Belt in the sky, as far as the magnitude is concerned, and they were blinking in a rapid succession like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. And it was blinking in that series, going around the ship, making out the entire outline of the ship. And that was the first thing that grabbed my attention. And then when I grabbed the binoculars up and looked at it, there was a solid black mass which was the triangle shape that was in the middle and that solid black mass matched the sky so identically that you wouldn't even know it was there. And this was only 8:15 at night. Cars were going by Silver Bell Road. None of them stopped and none of them looked up and saw this thing. Now, the next thing that happened is that the object started moving to the east. BEFORE IT STARTED MOVING, HOW HIGH ABOVE YOU DO YOU THINK IT WAS AND COULD YOU HEAR ANY SOUND? No, there was absolutely no sound at all. And we would have heard something because there were passenger airliners in the back of me, shu ttles going from Tucson to Phoenix, and you could hear that in the background. But you couldn't hear anything from the object. HOW HIGH ABOVE YOU DO YOU THINK IT WAS? It was right over this peak and the p eak was I would say some place between a quarter and a half a mile. And when the cr aft started to move and lower itself -- it started to move away from the peak a nd from us, and it started to lower itself and the lights fell out of sight. We ran through the house and got the car and went all the way out of our community and down the block and through the ravine -- there is a highway that goes through the ravine -- to the back. And when we got to the back of the mountain, I stopped the car at the side of the road and took out a pair of binocular s and it was gone. And I couldn't see a thing. The only thing of real interest is that this thing was sitting there for the three minutes I was looking at it and for about five minutes that my wife was looking at it before I came. And that would ma ke it about eight minutes. And when we got onto the other side of the mountain, there's a horse ranch there and I think that's what it was over -- it's a big dude ranch where they have guests that come. I went down there and talked with a few people who said they hadn't seen anything. But this thing was over one of those huge corrals where the horses were. Then approximately a half mile from there down across Twin Peaks Road is a huge cattle farm and they must have a th ousand five hundred head in there. And I think this is what it was looking at.\" I also talked with Bill Morris, Asst. State Director for Arizona's Mutual UFO Network. He said he contacted the Marana Police Department not far from the Revere home to see if the dispatcher had received any calls from residents who might have seen the same triangle of lights. There were no log notes about any reports."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"But, Skywatch Director, June Scherrer, received another March 4th report from five adults and four children who were outside a half hour after Linda and Ray Revere's sighting. What those nine people saw was described as four bright lights that formed a perfect square in the sky. Then they saw a large, all black circular object come in front of the square of ligh ts. Everything went dark and they never saw the lights again. Because these sightings are in an area where there are a lot of horses and ca ttle, Bill Morris says he will continue to canvass the area for any unusual animal deaths such as mutilations -- or unexplained animal disappearances. There have been several mountain lion kills of cattle in the area this year. If any listeners have seen anything like th ese triangles or squares of lights -- or what they might be, or about any current unusual animal deaths or disappearances, please contact me by faxing 215-491-9842.
