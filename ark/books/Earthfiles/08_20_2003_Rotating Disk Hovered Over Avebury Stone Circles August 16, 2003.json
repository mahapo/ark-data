Thirty witnesses at the Red Lion Pub in Avebury, Wiltshire, England, reported a rotating disk hovered about 200 feet above the center of the Avebury stone circle at twilight around 9:45 p.m. on Saturday evening, August 16, 2003.

August 20, 2003 - Avebury, Wiltshire, England - Twilight was shifting to darkness at the Red Lion Pub in Avebury when people walking inside the big stone circle began to yell and point toward the sky. About thirty witnesses sitting outside the pub looked toward the shouts. A black and white disk-shaped object was slowly rotating about 200 feet above the center of the Avebury stone circle. Simon Beard, a London resident, had a digital video camera which he shakily pointed at the object and recorded about two minutes of videotape. He contacted British Sky Television in London and hand-delivered a copy of his videotape to the engineering department which was used in a Sunday evening, August 17, 2003, short news segment. British Sky Television engineering tech, Miles Johnston, called me Sunday evening right after I had returned from Wiltshire to tell me he had seen the videotape and it was \"pretty impressive.\" Rumors have now surfaced that the object \"crashed\" somewhere and must have been somebody's elaborate \"prank.\" But Miles Johnston, who has been employed at British Sky TV since 1989, said the videotaped object must have been at least forty to fifty feet in diameter and wobbling slowly like a child's rotating top, a characteristic reported in UFO phenomenon since the 1950s, including other photographed objects that have a very black bottom half and a white upper half as shown in the series of video frames below of the Avebury unidentified aerial craft Interview: Miles Johnston, Senior Technical Director employed since 1989, British SKY Broadcasting, Isleworth, Middlesex, West London, England: \"What I tried to do is select from the footage some distance shots so you can see the position of the object relative to the surroundings. I also tried to get image of the "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"object rotating so that from one frame to the next, it should give an impression that the object is rotating slowly. THE SIZE ESTIMATE? The size object looks relative to the position it was with the other trees roughly about 40 feet in diameter that's what the eyewitnesses said. Between 40 and 50 feet. HOW HIGH ABOVE THE GROUND? The trees are roughly 90 feet in height, so I think the object was roughly about 200 feet up. IT WAS SEEN FOR HOW LONG? It would appear it was seen for at least several minutes. But I would imagine that since the object wasn't moving that fast it was just sitting hovering with a very slight tip up and down, almost in sympathy with the rotation. So it was slightly moving up, down, left, right, tipping over from left to right slightly. SORT OF LIKE A CHILD'S TOP THAT SPINS? Yes, very slowly. THE ONLY PERSON SO FAR WHO HAS DESCRIBED SOUND COMING FROM THE OBJECT IS SIMON BEARD AND HIS COLLEAGUE? Yes. But they are the only two people I have been able to talk to. It would appear that Simon stayed with his colleague on the Sunday while he was up giving the footage to SKY. All he gave SKY was 1:40. YOU HAVE THAT ENTIRE TAPE? Yes, from the Avid editing system. Including the freezes. AND SIMON GAVE SKY PERMISSION TO USE THIS VIDEOTAPE? Yes, he said, 'Do with it as you wish.' That's what he told me. I also suggested it might go on a website (Earthfiles.com) and he said, 'Yeah, no problem.'

I had a whole pile of telephone calls and messages that SKY TV was going to run UFO footage and an interview of a UFO seen over Avebury in Wiltshire. So, I immediately contacted the producers and managed to get hold of a videotape that was shown on SKY News about 8:55 p.m. on Sunday night, August 17, 2003, which was a full 24 hours after the material was shot on Saturday, August 16, 2003. The person photographed the object on Mini-DV is Simon Beard (Earthfiles so far has not been able to reach Simon Beard for a firsthand interview) and there was a telephone interview on air with a friend of Simon's in West London who was a co-witness with Simon of this UFO over Avebury. When we saw the footage of the UFO, which is very shaky footage, there are a number of people up to thirty witnesses. Avebury is a very small area. It has one pub in the middle called the Red Lion Pub and there were a whole pile of people in the pub and staff of the pub who were all witness to this."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The dialogue on the videotape is basically expressions of, 'We can't believe this!' People are looking amazed up in the sky at this low flying elliptical object which is about 40 feet wide and flying low over the trees and standing stones in the main circle area of Avebury stone circles. The cameraman zooms in and can't get that good a zoom and starts running frantically towards the object, which is hovering and rotating quite slowly about one revolution about every two seconds, fairly low over the ground, probably 200 feet up. He then gets another perspective view and zoom up to the object where it's possible to see a white light on one side and a red light on the other. The bottom half of the object appears to be black and the top half of the object appears to be white. This is in getting dark conditions in late twilight around 10 p.m. in the summer evening at Avebury. COULD YOU HEAR ANY SOUND ON THE VIDEOTAPE OF THE OBJECT? Simon told me that there was a low frequency whirring noise coming from the object and he said the craft was about 40 feet wide and he saw it fly for about three miles. HOW LONG IS THE VIDEOTAPE THAT WAS DELIVERED TO SKY? The videotape which is shot on mini-DV was only 1 minute 40 seconds, of which about half of that is the cameraman running frantically towards the object. IF THIS WERE AN OBJECT THAT EVERYONE HAD SEEN FOR THREE MILES, WOULD HE AND OTHERS HAVE MORE VIDEOTAPE OF THIS? I was amazed for an object being fairly stationary and moving very slowly that there should be an awful lot more footage of that. DID SIMON AND HIS FRIEND SAY THAT THERE WAS MORE VIDEOTAPE BEYOND THE 1:40 THAT THEY DELIVERED TO SKY? He said that was the only footage he had. OF THAT 1:40, IS THERE ANY SOUND OF THE OBJECT ON THE TAPE? There is no sound of the object because the cameraman is running so heavily and there is a lot of his breath noises on it. There is some dialogue from other witnesses saying, 'We can't believe it!' at the very start and that's when everyone is looking up at this object with amazement and smiles saying, 'We can't believe there is a UFO over Avebury!' The cameraman basically echoed the same sentiment and then he's getting some pictures of the object, initially near trees, so there is a lot of good relative distance and calibration objects in the frames available, so one is able to get a fairly good idea about how big and where this object is. Then he runs toward it panting like mad, while the camera is running. Eventually he gets on to a better location on top of one of the Avebury rings which go around Avebury and that means he is able to get up at a higher angle of attack on the object. Then he used his digital zoom, which defocused the image very badly. Then he stopped using that and after that, the footage just stops. IT STOPS AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OBJECT? No. AND YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO TALK DIRECTLY WITH SIMON BEARD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED? OR DID HIS COLLEAGUE SAY WHAT HAPPENED? His colleague in London implied that maybe some kind of prank had been pulled, but he didn't know. He said it was a 'weird experience,' and referred me to Simon who I was able to talk with on Monday night. He was nursing a 3-year-old child at the time and was able to give me only some basic details. He"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"said he heard a whirring noise out of it. So, that Monday night, about 48 hours after his footage was shot, told me that the object had a low sort of whirring buzz coming out of it. A WHIRRING BUZZ? Ye s . WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OBJECT AS IT HOVERED OVER AVEBURY? Just slowly rotated and then moved slowly away for about three miles and that's all I've got so far. SO, THE THREE MILE DISTANCE WAS NOT THE OBJECT COMING TOWARD THE WITNESSES, BUT ...? Going away. SINCE YOU HAVE LOOKED AT THE VIDEOTAPE YOURSELF AND KNOW THE AVEBURY AREA SO WELL, CAN YOU PLACE EXACTLY WHERE THIS OBJECT IS OVER WHICH PART OF THE AVEBURY CIRCLE? It looks as if it is right above the middle of the large stone circle. HAS ANYONE AT SKY TELEVISION RECEIVED ANY COMMENTS FROM VIEWERS AFTER THE BROADCAST ON SUNDAY? None. NO OTHER VIDEOTAPES HAVE SURFACED? No, SKY treated it as a light Sunday evening story. But they aired it and publicized it for two hours.\" REQUEST: If anyone has more information or other photographs and videotape concerning this incident in Avebury on Saturday evening, August 16, 2003, please contact Earthfiles.com.
