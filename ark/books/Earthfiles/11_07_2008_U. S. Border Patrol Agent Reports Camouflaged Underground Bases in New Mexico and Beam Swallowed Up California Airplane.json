Border Patrol Agent Reports Camouflaged Underground Bases in New Mexico and Beam “Swallowed Up” California Airplane © 2008 by Linda Moulton Howe “T here were two people jogging on the beach. They saw the strange, intense beam and watched it swallow up an airplane that was flying over the ocean west of San Diego!” - R etired U. S. Border Patrol Agent November 7, 2008 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Seventeen years ago in March 1991, I received a brown, legal-sized envelope by Certified Mail postmarked February 28, 1991, from Porterville, California. The envelope contained an audiocassette, letter and drawings from a woman named Linda Porter about her abduction experiences since her teenage years. I felt her information was so important that I traveled to California to meet and interview Linda in person. Eventually, all of her drawings and insights were included in my third book, Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness, including information about a location in the Poway region of San Diego, that now seems even more relevant after recent mail from a retired United States Border Patrol Agent. [ See Earthfiles Shop for my books and documentaries.] First, some background about Linda Porter’s information. The primary non-humans in Linda’s abductions were 5-foot-tall “Grey” entities and smaller 3-foot-tall “Grey” entities that Linda sensed were biological androids working for the taller Greys. She also interacted with insect or praying mantis-looking creatures. She did not understand the relationship between the Greys and the praying mantis types. But she was also allowed to “see” a different, blond-haired, non-human being during an out-of-body experience in which she was conscious of all details around her, but knew her body was still in her Porterville bed. She began her description of this experience like this: “The aliens told me (out-of-body experience) prior to 1991 about a place called the Sycamore Remote Facility run by General Dynamics, according to the aliens. It’s located in Southern California and inland a ways from San Diego in the Poway region. A bove and below: 1996 photographs of Sycamore Canyon fac ility that includes General Dynamics, Hughes Sites A & J and Lockheed Martin Astronautics Site B northeast of San Diego directly north of Miramar Naval Air Station.

Please see Earthfiles Shop. “It’s supposed to be a missile-testing site, but it’s actually a holding area for non-human beings that have been captured by the U. S. government. Supposedly, there is one particular building that goes down five or six stories underground, and on the lowest level there is a very large room where the bodies of alien people are being kept encased in containers. The containers are on a cement base. I don’t know if they’re Plexiglass or what, but you can see through to see the person. “And there is one particular being down there that the aliens want back. I was also given the impression that the creatures that are being held are still alive, but they’re being stored in some sort of cryogenic form of suspended animation.” One of several human-looking beings Linda was shown in out-of-body experience prior to 1991. Non-humans are kept in suspended animation under U.S. government security in an underground facility east of San Diego in the Poway region and Sycamore"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Canyon. Pencil sketch labeled “5” by Linda Porter. Drawing from Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Str angeness © 1998 by Linda Moulton Howe. “The captured being was very human-looking. He doesn’t much like the grey beings at all. He has some kind of silver mesh vest over his chest, and the rest of him is all in black. He has sandy, blond-colored hair, and he has a very boyish look to him, although he’s probably in his thirties. “The whole Sycamore area is supposed to be full of underground tram systems that lead from the naval base in San Diego to this facility and to another pl ace. The other place is the entrance. Believe it or not, it is through a garage attached to a perfectly ordinary-looking house sitting up against a hill in an isolated area. The garage is the entrance to an underground network that goes into the hill. “If any of this is actually true, then there is an awful lot that the American public does not know and our tax money evidently paid for it. I was also told (telepathically by aliens) that two young Navy guys were killed by our government because the men found out about this place. And their families were told that they died on base in a jeep accident.” Back in 1996, I was able to confirm that near the intersection of Spring Canyon and Pomerado Road northeast of San Diego and directly north of the Miramar Naval Air Station were several signs leading into Sycamore Canyon, including one which said: “General Dynamics, Sycamore Canyon, Private Property, No Entry Without Permission.” Beyond that entry way, the road slopes around and down and you cannot see any buildings or guard shacks. I also learned that the entire area is off limits to overflights due to a 6,000 feet to ground level warning on flight charts. That air space limitation might be related to Sycamore Canyon being in the approach path to Miramar Naval Air Station. But could Linda Porter’s insights from her out-of-body journey by the non-humans into the alleged underground facility used to keep captured non-humans in a state of suspended animation be true? If so, would it imply that the San Diego region could be a persistent focus of non-humans that want to free other non-humans in the underground facility? What leverage would non-humans have over the U. S. government? Historically, various military people have asserted that the American government tried to shoot UFOs out of the skies from the 1940s to 1950s in order to retrieve advanced technologies and to interrogate the non-human occupants. But according to military and intelligence sources, the non-humans retaliated and brought down human airplanes and electric power grids. UFO investigator Len Stringfield told me before he died that he had firsthand knowledge there was an American standing order to shoot down alien craft, but that we ended up losing more than two thousand planes and pilots before that standing order was rescinded in the mid-1950s. There are also rumors that the American military is in a “secret war” with non-humans. If so, could that explain some modern unexplained air crashes – or even airplane disappearances? On Saturday, November 1, 2008, I received another letter by hard mail with a map from a retired Border Patrol agent who worked for the United States from 1958 until his official retirement in 1992, followed by more subcontract work for the U. S. Border Patrol until 1995. That’s a thirty-seven-year career in border security! His map was about extraordinary underground bases in the Roswell, New Mexico, region – including one disguised as a volcanic cone, but housing a silver disc surrounded by military personnel. I called him to follow-up and he is still nervous to talk about his experiences with his actual full name. So, we agreed I would refer to him as “Roberto.” Surprisingly, before we got into the details of his letter and map, he mentioned seeing a bright, beam of light emanating from a “black fog bank” above the hills east of San Diego. 1988, San Diego, California: Beam of Light “Swallowed Up” Small Airplane The year was 1988 and he was driving along Highway 94 not far from Tecate on the U. S. and Mexico border east of San Diego. Roberto was headed for a U. S. Border Patrol morning staff meeting in San Diego. The time was 5:30 AM. The sun was not up, but in the pre-dawn, he could see puzzling “black fog” resting on the hills above San Diego."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"H ighway 94 on map goes from Campo past Tecate past Jamul into San Diego. At 5:30 AM, “Roberto” was driving by Tecate, California at the Mexico border when he first saw in the pre-dawn sky over hills east of San Diego, “black fog” emanating a bright beam of light. Then in 1992, Roberto watched through binoculars from his Campo home a round, aerial object hovering over Escondido, flashing red, blue, white and yellow lights. Interview: Roberto, Retired U. S. Border Patrol Agent, Southwestern United States: “As I was looking towards the west, it looked like a big fog bank was over the mountains (east of San Diego), which was not unusual, but this fog bank was really dark. I mean, it was black. 5:30 AM in 1988, very bright beam of light moving in and out of “black fog bank” over hills east of San Diego, California. Two eyewitnesses on San Diego beach reported seeing bright beam of light “swallow up” a small airplane over the ocean. Drawing © 2008 by retired U. S. Border Patrol agent. And coming from the south low along the ridge of hills along the valley called Barrett Junction near Dulzura at the edge of Cleveland National Forest. You go past a place called Jamul. And I saw this bright, really intense beam going along the mountain ridge shining down. It was like a sunlight beam you would see in an attic where it’s dusty. That bright. At first, I thought it was one of our Border Patrol helicopters because they were always working in that area with searchlights looking for Mexican aliens. And then I realized that the beam was so intense and it was kind of going behind the fog bank and coming back out and kept going in and out. Even BEHIND the fog bank, the beam was really intense, way brighter than any of our helicopters would be. I figured when I got over the rise that I would see fog hanging over San Diego, which is common there in the early morning. But when I got over the hill rise at Jamul, I looked to the west towards San Diego and it was totally clear. The sky was unusually clear."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Two days later, I read an article in the San Diego Union-Tribune newspaper by a columnist who lived in Jamul, California. He wrote a regular column for the newspaper and he started out by saying, ‘Tell me if I’m crazy, but I saw a UFO from my home in Jamul. If anyone saw what I saw,’ – and he described exactly what I saw – ‘if anybody saw that, please contact me.’ Well, I did contact him. He said, ‘You’re the 45th person who has contacted me and all of the reports say the same thing.’ There were two people jogging on the beach. They saw the strange, intense beam and watched it swallow up an airplane that was flying over the ocean west of San Diego!’ So, he asked me if I would be willing to come on Channel 10 television with him because he told me I was the most credible witness he had so far with my being a law enforcement officer (U. S. Border Patrol). He wanted me to tell what I saw, too, and I told him, ‘Sure, I’d be happy to.’ So, I went to our staff meeting and told our chief and staff officers what I had seen and that I wanted to tell my story on TV. The chief looked at me and said, ‘What do you want to do, make us all look like a bunch of crazies?! I’m not going to allow you to take off and go down there and make a bunch of fools out of us.’ I said, ‘What?’ And there was another officer there who lived in Jamul – he was the Border Patrol Public Information Officer who I knew very well because he worked for me. He spoke up and said, ‘I saw it, too, Chief.’ But the chief said to him, too, ‘You’re not making a nut out of me.’ He told me, ‘I deny your request to take annual leave to appear on TV.’ I told him I would not appear in uniform. He said, ‘I don’t care how you’re dressed. Request denied!’ So, I had to tell the journalist I could not go. But some other eyewitnesses did go and I saw some drawings of what they had seen and it was identical to what I had seen. It was a strange, black, fog bank with this intense beam. I don’t know to this day what it was. BUT THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE BLACK CLOUD WAS OBSCURING THE CRAFT FROM WHICH THE BEAM WAS BEING EMITTED. Right, when I went over the hill expecting to drive into the fog, it was gone! Everything was just completely clear. It was the strangest thing. 1992, Escondido UFO About four years later in 1992, I was retired and living in Campo about 60 miles east of San Diego. I used to sit up working at the computer at night, listening to Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell. One night there was a report from a guy living in Boulevard, California, only abut 20 miles east of Campo. On the radio, the man said an aerial object was hovering low to the northeast and had different colored, glowing lights – red, yellow, white blue. Then another guy called in from Valley Center just northeast of Escondido. He said a round, glowing object was “suspended over Escondido.”"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"1 992: “I was looking towards the northwest from Campo, CA. According to the caller to C2C, it (UFO) was hovering over Escondido, CA. The caller said he was at Valley Center, just to the east of Escondido maybe 5 miles. I saw the orb through binoculars perhaps from about 40 miles. It was suspended low in the sky (not a star) and was flashing bright red, white, yellow and blue. Very bright. Roberto.” Drawing © 2008 by retired U. S. Border Patrol agent. So, I grabbed my binoculars and ran out into the street in front of my house because we lived at a pretty high altitude there and I looked over to the northeast and sure enough, I could see it! I could see it was blinking red and other colors. My youngest daughter was there, Allison, and I asked her to come and look through the binoculars and she said she saw the same thing. After awhile, it disappeared. 1977, Underground Bases Near Roswell, New Mexico? T he circled number 1 is an area west of Portales, New Mexico, northeast of Roswell, where U. S. Border Patrol agent says in 1977 there was a gigantic underground “air base.” Circled number 2 near Alamogordo and the White Sands Missile Range marks a site described as a “volcanic cone” that camouflaged an underground base in which a silver disc and U. S. Air Force personnel were seen. Map by retired U. S. Border Patrol agent. YOU SENT ME A MAP NUMBERED WITH A RED 1 AND RED 2. Right. RED 1 IS NEAR PORTALES, NEW MEXICO AND FORT SUMNER. AND NUMBER 2 IS DOWN NEAR THE FORT BLISS MILITARY RESERVATION. COULD YOU START WITH YOUR NUMBER 1 BETWEEN FORT SUMNER AND PORTALES. TELL WHAT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT ONE IS AND THEN WE’LL MOVE ON TO FORT BLISS. OK, the significance of number 1 is that there was a fellow who liked to play cards, poker and drink beer. So, he got to telling us one night, ‘I know all you guys have security clearances. I can tell you some stuff. He said, ‘I’ve been working with some guys in Las Vegas, New Mexico. They work all over the country and all over the world in different kinds of installations. It was 1977 and Jim said they were telling about an underground installation between Roswell and Portales out in kind of the desert there. He said they claimed there was an underground base, that they found this huge limestone cavern. He said it was way, way bigger than Carlsbad Caverns. He said it was so big that they told Jim they could fly airplanes in and out of the cavern. They told Jim there were great big sliding doors covered with sand and stuff to camouflage them. He said they could open the doors up and fly a plane in and out of this underground place. These guys told him they had worked in the cavern building the underground air base. Now we’ll go from circle 1 to circle 2 and that is located somewhere on the northern part of the Fort Bliss (Texas) missile range close to Alamogordo, New Mexico. And the story I got was from an agent that worked for me at Indio (southeast of El Paso). He got a call from a colleague at the border patrol station that said up towards Alamogordo, they had some trouble and were going to be transferred out of there."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"He said what had happened was that two of them had gone down in a jeep onto a missile range where they were not supposed to be, but they went prowling around looking for Mexican aliens. And they got down a ways and saw a weird-looking kind of volcanic cone. The description that I heard was that it was black, maybe 80 or 90 feet high and looked really out of place in the desert sands and aroused their curiosity. So, they got out of the jeep and climbed up the cone because it looked flat on top. What they told the border patrol guys when they got up there and looked down in it, they saw a concrete floor down in the thing and there was a flying saucer parked down there being attended to by Air Force personnel. They go, ‘Oh, oh, we saw something we should not have seen.’ So, they climbed down very carefully and got out of there and apparently were not detected. Or at least they didn’t think they were. But when they got off duty that afternoon, they went where everyone including cops got together at a local watering hole after work to have a beer. So they’re in there having a beer and telling the other guys what they had seen. Some little time later, a couple of guys came in plain clothes and tapped them on the shoulder and said, ‘Why don’t you come with us. We want to talk with you.’ Apparently it was some plain-clothes security officers from White Sands. All the guys said was that they were getting transferred out of here on short notice. They were both going to the East Coast and they were admonished not to talk about what they had seen (in the lava “cone.”) Well, the guy who was in charge of the border patrol station – he’s dead now – was a guy I had worked with at Carlsbad between 1960 and 1965. We were good friends and I knew he was in charge there. So, I called him on the government phone and I asked, ‘What do you know about some guys going out?’ He asked, ‘What did you hear?’ I said, ‘I heard some of your guys went out where they weren’t supposed to be and found a flying saucer in a volcano-looking thing and got in trouble with the base security.’ There was kind of a big pause. I knew this guy really well. He was an ex-Marine, by the way. I asked him, ‘Is it true?’ There was a big pause and then he says to me very deliberately, ‘Not true. Nothing to it.’ That’s all he would say. Well, I knew the way he said it that it was true. When I was stationed in Carlsbad, New Mexico from 1960 to 1965, there was UFO stuff going on all over the state then. The UFO activity – I never saw one myself there, but I talked to several people who had seen them and had seen them up close. Some were state policemen. 1961, Socorro, NM: Silver Disc Lands, Is Photographed by NM State Police Officer I think there was one over by White Sands where the State Police saw a disc come down and land close to the highway. He drove up to take photographs of it. Then guys in the black suits showed up because he was talking to his police dispatcher about what he saw and what he was going to do (photograph). He goes and takes photographs of the object with his accident camera and the guys in the black suits come zinging up. They were apparently monitoring the State Police frequency. They demanded his film, photographs and took his camera away from him and everything. I told him that if I had been a state cop, they would have played hell getting the camera and photo stuff away from me! (laughs) WHAT YEAR WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN? Probably 1961. DID YOU EVER HEAR A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT WAS IN THOSE PHOTOS? Yes, he described it as a typical flying disc and said it settled down and landed on the ground about a half-mile off the highway up towards Socorro, I think. He said he drove over to a little wire fence on a little dirt road that went up to it. He got pretty close. He got out of his patrol car and started to shoot photographs and the disc took off. So, he said he went over to the area where it had landed and he took photos of the marks in the ground where like a tripod had come down and was sitting. He said there were indentations in the ground there and he got photographs of those. Then about that time, the guys in the black suits came zinging up and said, ‘Hand over your film.’ And that was the end of that.”"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" T here has been a lot of reported high strangeness in the 2008 skies of projected 3-dimensional symbols and strange lights above Stephenville, Texas; Kokomo, Indiana; Oswego, Illinois; Granville, Massachusetts and many other locations in North America, Mexico, South America and Europe.

And rumors persist that there might be an Earth’s secret war between human military and non-human advanced technologies that can deceive with holograms and transport matter with beam technologies. So, I would like to close this report with one of the most significant communications I received from Linda Porter in 1991, allegedly telepathic information from a praying mantis entity. “There is much, much more to existence than we could ever begin to understand. Much of what we have been taught regarding the physical universe and the laws that govern it is wrong. “This creature’s civilization communicates difficult concepts via the use of symbols that radiate emotion. They use this form to get concepts across with their exact true meanings intact. No misinterpretations can occur this way. “The symbols are not mathematical ones, but appear as 3-dimensional holographic pictures that resemble abstract sculptures. The emotional aspect is relayed via carrier waves that resemble sound waves, but are not part of the human sound spectrum. These waves can be felt, but not heard. If the creatures want to clear a certain area of humans, they can ‘broadcast’ this carrier wave over the area at a certain frequency and it will create intense fear in people, causing them to flee the area. It does not cause any harm, so they say. [Editor’s Note: Most humans generally cannot hear frequencies below 20 Hertz or above 16,000 to 20,000 Hertz.] “Problems arise when trying to translate this visual/emotional input into words. Human semantics can cause explanations to become mired down in confusion. What is extremely easy to comprehend on one level of existence using one form of expression then becomes very hard to interpret correctly when translating it onto another level using a limited form of expression such as the human language. A lot of meaning is lost and many important concepts become hazy or are totally misinterpreted. “The universe is built on sound patterns, which is why so many different worlds/dimensions can exist in the same space. Each is on a different frequency. Disrupt a world/dimension to the point that you destroy the carrier wave it exists on and you have created a ‘hole’ in existence that cannot support the dimension above or below t. Each frequency, besides maintaining its own world/dimension, also supports – or holds in place – the one above it and below it. Everything is interdependent! “ The other world/dimensions will begin to collapse into this ‘hole.’ Not only will this destroy countless other civilizations, but the resulting area of matter compressed into such density can throw the whole gravitational field for parsecs around it out of balance, thus causing the further damage of even more worlds as they are pulled out of orbit. The process feeds on itself. “There are countless worlds/dimensions occupying the same space without"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"being aware of one another because of having their own individual octaves. This octave/frequency holds the world/dimension in place and causes it to exist safely without interfering with (or even being aware of) other worlds around it. This frequency acts as a buffer zone to keep everything in its place. Do anything to disrupt it and you begin a collapse that starts a deadly chain reaction. If the density of this collapse reaches a certain weight, space/time itself begins to collapse. “Whatever the experiment is that our government is involved with in outer space, (if successful) it will change the density of matter to such an extent that the chain reaction started will not be able to be stopped by anybody in any world/dimension! “There are literally hundreds of different alien life forms here trying to stop what is happening as it is putting their own worlds at risk. Some, as I had mentioned in earlier letters, are not supposed to be interfering, but are doing so anyway. What they are all trying to do is stop the ‘ripple effect’ that will emanate outward from us should this experiment succeed. “With all their technology, Linda, why don’t the aliens – or their superiors – just walk in and stop the whole thing themselves? Why do they need us abductees to speak for them? Something just doesn’t make any sense. I wonder if we are being lied to, used for some purpose to put over ideas they want us to believe? If there is an experiment, maybe if it succeeds, it w ill put us in competition with the aliens for something they don’t want to share. Maybe they’re trying to ‘scare’ us out of ‘their’ neighborhood.” [ Source: Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Str angeness © 1998 by Linda Moulton Howe, pages 266 – 268. ] More Information: I would appreciate hearing from other eyewitnesses of strange aerial light events in the United States and world.
