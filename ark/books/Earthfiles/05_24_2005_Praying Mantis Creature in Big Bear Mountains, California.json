Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Praying Mantis Creature in Big Bear Mountains, California? © 2005 by Linda Moulton Howe May 24, 2005 Omaha, Nebraska - Back in April 1996, Amy Brockman had been married four years and was living in Southern California. She had grown up in Omaha, Nebraska, where she was born thirty-five years ago in 1970. She graduated from high school with an interest in art and studied for one and a half years in a community college. By April 1996, her marriage was deteriorating toward divorce and her health was bad. For relief, Amy decided to go camping with a friend in the Big Bear Mountains near Big Bear Lake east of San Bernardino. The first morning around 8 a.m., she stepped out of the tent and was overwhelmed by the beauty of the trees, mountains and sunlight. So, she got her 35mm camera, loaded it with a 24-frame roll of 400 ASA Kodak film, and clicked off five shots as she randomly aimed the lens at what appealed to her. During the camp outing, she finished off the roll, had the prints developed and put them in a box. Amy and her husband divorced and she moved back to Omaha to be close to her family parents. In 2004, she heard a Coast to Coast AM radio program in which I was interviewing people about photographs that had translucent or opaque small orbs in them, even though the photographers had not seen any orbs with their eyes. Amy decided to look through the box of photographs she had been accumulating over the years to see if there were any orbs. To her surprise, she found several orbs in her old photographs - and something else in one of the 1996 photographs from the Big Bear Mountain camping trip that scared her . Interview: Amy Brockman, Medical Insurance Claims Specialist, Omaha, Nebraska: \"I don't know if it was because my mind was opening up to things, that I was being more intent in looking at the pictures very carefully in the box, but I just ran across this very strange figure that was by the tree. I remembered being out in that camping area and I don't remember seeing anything like this. And it scared me at first. So I started looking a little bit closer and the next day, I took them into (Kinko's) and blew up the pictures. The rest is history because I did not know what it was. HOW MANY PHOTOS DID YOU PRINT FROM THAT ROLL? I'm going to say a 24 frame roll and I took 6 pictures that morning, no 5. It's funny because I was just kind of aiming the camera around and I ended up taking two pictures of the same spot. One picture where the dead tree trunk is just sitting there by the pine tree and there is absolutely nothing standing by it. The next picture I took, the white figure is standing there. BUT YOU DID NOT SEE IT AT THE TIME YOU WERE PHOTOGRAPHING? No, that's why I'm so shocked. I'm an artist. I pay attention to things, to details. I don't know why I did not see that.

Also, between two trees on right half of photo is a white, long-armed object that is not in the first photograph. Third photograph has white arrow that points out white object.

I got out of my tent and I walked to the left of the tent and I just started taking pictures of the scenery. It was just absolutely stunning to me because I had never spent any time in such a beautiful place. SO YOU WERE NOT AWARE OF ANYTHING ANOMALOUS AROUND YOU? Not at all. HOW DID YOU DISCOVER THIS VERY ODD PRAYING MANTIS-LIKE CREATURE IN THE PHOTOGRAPH? I noticed it in 2004. I was listening to Coast to Coast AM and I was hearing people talking about orbs that were in their pictures. So I got interested and I sat down with all my old photographs and I started looking through them. I saw lots of orbs and that made me even more interested and kept looking and ran across these pictures from our camping trip. I had not seen them in years (9 years). They were in a box tucked away. YOU ARE 35 YEARS OLD NOW. DO YOU HAVE ANY MEMORIES AS A CHILD OF HEARING BUZZING NOISES, OR CLICKING NOISES, OR LIGHTS IN THE ROOM, OR ANYTHING THAT WOULD FALL INTO THE POSSIBLE CATEGORY OF SOMETHING NON-HUMAN INTERACTING WITH YOU? No, not when I was really young. I've had several things happen when I was in my college years, my early twenties. I would not say I've heard clicking or anything like that. I've just had strange things happen around me. I don't know if they would relate. ANYTHING IN WHICH YOU HAVE HAD A VIVID DREAM IN WHICH SOMETHING LIKE A PRAYING MANTIS HAS APPEARED? No, and I lucid dream, so I would remember that. I have very vivid dreams. WHEN YOU FINALLY GOT THESE PHOTOS OUT AGAIN LOOKING FOR THE ORBS AND YOU WERE LOOKING AT THIS IMAGE FOR THE FIRST TIME, REALIZING THAT YOU WERE SEEING SOMETHING YOU HAD NOT SEEN IN THE PHOTO BEFORE, WHAT WAS YOUR IMMEDIATE REACTION TO SEEING THE WHITE FIGURE? Fear. WHEN YOU THINK OF A PRAYING MANTIS, WHAT COMES INTO YOUR MIND IMMEDIATELY? I'm scare of that because I am scared (to realize) I was out in the middle of nowhere and thee was something there and I did not sense it. Now that I look at the pictures, it makes me feel it's really scary! Usually I'm more intuitive with my environment, like people around me, I can feel. I can feel if you are angry or if there are bad vibes around, I can usually pick up on that. So, I didn't pick up on that out there.. But when I looked at the picture, I felt horrified, I felt scared, fear, definite fear because it's unusual. It's strange. It's not something you expect to see in a picture! It's even strange to talk about it these many years later, but it's something that is haunting me and I want to know what it is. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT INTRIGUES ME ABOUT THIS PHOTO IS THAT THE"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"PRAYING MANTIS CREATURE IS SO WHITE, SO DRENCHED OF ANY COLOR, IN THE ENVIRONMENT WHICH OTHERWISE HAS A LOT OF GREEN AND COLOR IN IT. Yeah, and I think that the head on this particular creature is outstanding. You can tell so well that it's got that prominent chin on it. It looks so much to me like a praying mantis head. I looked at the long arm and thought, 'My goodness!' For awhile, I took this picture in and talked about it with some people at a metaphysical book store here in town and asked, 'What do you think this is?' And an older lady in there said, 'That looks like an angel because it looks like it has archangel wings behind it, kind of just perched up on its back.' ANOTHER INTERESTING THING ABOUT THE PRAYING MANTIS CREATURES IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE ENCOUNTERED THEM OUTSIDE, LIKE NEAR A BARN, AND DESCRIPTIONS AND DRAWINGS ARE OF A GLOWING LIGHT AROUND THE HEAD OR UPPER PART OF THE BODY. That might explain the bright white face and 'wings.'\" P raying mantis-creature encountered by David Huggins at Georgia farm when he was eight in 1950. He associated entity with small, grey beings which David thought were androids programmed to do work for the praying mantis and tall humanoids.
