Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Brentwood, Tennessee Crop Formation and New U.K. Photos by Peter Sorensen © 1999 by Linda Moulton Howe July 15, 1999 Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, England A few weeks ago on Coast to Coast AM radio, I interviewed crop circle researcher Nancy Talbott about the teenage fellow in Holland who watched a pink light shaped like a football, but smaller, expand to a thirty-foot disc. The transformation was over a crop field not far from the young man's bedroom window. He saw electrical discharges come down out of the pink glowing light. Then, the object disappeared by simply blinking out. He ran to the field where the ground was still warm to touch and he could hear a crackling noise. There, he found two circles: one about thirty feet in diameter and the other only about two feet wide. As far as the Dutch teenager is concerned, the pink, expanding light made the two circles. Those circles were sampled for Nancy Talbott's BLT research team and she will travel to Holland next week to re-sample plants prior to harvest and do further investigations. I'll have further reports from her in the near future. Since early April this year, there have been at least 66 formations in cereal crops in England. The array of patterns has ranged from one that looks like a time lapse photograph of a lunar or solar eclipse to another near Barbury Castle which was a refined image of an ancient Hebrew menorah with a tripod base. There have been several variations on spirals and fractals - and very long and complex pictograms reminiscent of 1990 to 1991 when the mysterious crop formations were discovered in more than twenty countries worldwide, including rice paddies in Japan and wheat fields in Australia. Over the past few weeks, there have been half a dozen in Germany ... 4 in Holland and the Netherlands ... 2 in the Czech Republic .... and 2 in the United States. The first here was not geometric, but oddly scalloped and downed wheat in Maryland. Electrostatic Crackling Noise in Tennessee Crop Formation: Then the first 1999 geometric formation in the U. S. was discovered June 18th in Brentwood, Tennessee south of Nashville. It consisted of a central ring from which a T-Cross and two corridors ending in circles branched at ninety degree angles. The longest part of the formation was 190 feet. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Diagram © 1999 by Tom Murdic, Franklin, Tennessee. Resident Tom Murdic from Franklin, Tennessee went into the formation with his two sons to photograph and measure and they heard a crackling sound. Interview: Tom Murdic, Franklin, Tennessee: \"I noticed - we all noticed - this crackling noise. And it was during this time that I made the comment to the kids that it sounded like we were in a bowl of rice krispies. And we were all standing still at the time. SO YOU WERE STANDING STILL HEARING THIS CRACKLING SOUND AND ALL THREE OF YOU COULD HEAR IT AT THE SAME TIME. Oh, yeah. We all noted it. HOW LONG WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE CRACKLING SOUND REMAINED WHILE YOU WERE THERE? The whole time. HOW LONG WERE YOU THERE? I would say we were in the circle somewhere between 30 and 40 minutes. SO ALMOST FOR AN HOUR YOU WERE HEARING THIS CRACKLING SOUND? Right. COULD YOU FEEL ANY SENSE OF WARMTH OR HEAT COMING FROM THE PLANTS OR THE SOIL? No, it was a pretty hot day, so it would be very hard to assess anything. COULD YOU IN ANY INTUITIVE SENSE DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THIS CRACKLING SOUND WAS COMING FROM THE AIR, FROM THE PLANTS OR FROM THE SOIL? I just say, you were surrounded by it. You were surrounded by it. It was everywhere. So, I mean, to say it was coming from one particular source, I can't say. Of course, you'd think it was coming from the wheat because that's the only thing in there to make noise. You know, having walked on it. HAD YOU EVER HEARD A SOUND LIKE THAT BEFORE? Yeah. Yeah. Static discharge.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"If the static discharge is produced by technology, whose technology, and why? Mysterious Light and Crop Circles in Peru There was even a circle reported this spring on March 8th in Peru, South America. Residents of Cinochero, a village in the Andes about 16 miles north of Cuzco reported they saw a glowing \"light ship\" land in a field. Later, the Peruvians said that a single large circle was left in the grass where the glowing light landed. Other International Crop Formations Various photographers in various countries are trying to document these peculiar patterns as they emerge. One in Germany named Frank Lauman described recent spirals near Hessen, Germany this way: \"Amazingly, it seems as if the first formation appeared in full daylight and within a perfect view to the nearby road. Local cropcircle researcher Wolfgang Schoppe is sure that it was not present at 8 AM on June 26th when he went by the field. But the formation was there eight hours later at 4 PM.\" Mr. Lauman also reports that same day, June 26th, a second formation was discovered in a field of rye near Hessen. The formation consisted of a huge spiral made of a wavy path with several small circles embedded in the standing crop between the flattened spiral paths. Photographs by Frank Laumen and many other photographers can be seen at www.cropcircleconnector.com. New photographs from photographer, Peter Sorensen, are shown below. This first photograph referred to as the 'Galactic Crescents' was photographed by Nan Lu and is Peter Sorensen's favorite crop formation so far in 1999.

Delayed Bloom in Oilseed Rape \"Eclipse\" Formation Back in April 1999 as the first formations began in the yellow flowered canola or rape seed, Peter Sorensen photographed the yellow crescent emerging from"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"the dark green circle which resonates with his following photograph of a formation that resembles a time lapse of a lunar or solar eclipse. Interestingly, the last solar eclipse in Europe for another 79 years occurs August 11, 1999. Peter wrote to me when he sent these two photographs: \"Attached are my pictures of the two eclipse formations. The little one at Bishops Cannings near Devizes was the first, arriving sometime in April, and the long sequence was at Middle Wallop near Andover. I'm probably the only person who has a shot of the little one with the 'sun' yellow like this! Everyone else has it when it (formation) was new, and the whole field of rape was solid yellow flowers (except for the flattened crop that made up the crescent). The flattened crop was retarded in its growth cycle (which is why the crescent is yellow after rest of green crop had already flowered.\" Yellow blooming oilseed rape in April 1999 that made the crescent and little grapeshot outside the formation where the solid green circle overlaps the yellow flowers are the result of delayed growth confined to those areas. All the rest of the field had already bloomed. What would produce such delayed growth in a specific pattern? Location is Bishops Cannings, Wiltshire near Devizes. Photograph © 1999 by Peter Sorensen.
