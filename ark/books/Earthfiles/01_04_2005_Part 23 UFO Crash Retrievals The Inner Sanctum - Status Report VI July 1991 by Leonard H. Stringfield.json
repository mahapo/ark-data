Leonard Stringfield: \"'THE MORICHES BAY 'RETRIEVAL' While the spotlight of the research community shines on the illustrious probes and detective work that brought the Roswell and Kecksburg cases to the forefront, another incident that happened on September 28, 1989, involved a mysterious 'retrieval- of-something' from the watery depths of Moriches Bay off Long Island, N. Y. Except for the local witnesses of the event in the Bay area to to those beyond in New York State and New England, who were aware of a UFO flap during that time-frame, the major research groups gave it no more than a glancing interest. But, thanks to John Ford, head of the Long Island UFO Network, his probes into the retrieval events finally led to a full scale investigation. The LIUFON report is long and tedious reading - evidence that it was a time-consuming and costly effort to get to the bottom of a series of undercover events in the Moriches Bay area. A UFO crash/retrieval? I cannot say, but the report is worthy of study. To me, it appears that LIUFON may have been subjected to the ploys of disinformation. Len Stringfield's reprint of report from Long Island UFO Network (LIUFON), New York: Long Island UFO Network (LIUFON), New York: 'INTRODUCTION 'The Long Island UFO Network has publicly stated since October 1989, that a UFO incident occurred over Moriches Bay in the northwest quadrant of this shallow body of water on the South Shore of Long Island. Located adjacent to this Bay are the areas of Shirley, Mastic, Mastic Beach, Center Moriches, Moriches, East Moriches, South Hampton, Quogue and Smith's Point Beach. This body of water and its adjoining communities are also the highest areas of the UFO activity in Suffolk County. 'The Long Island UFO Network, Inc., and its staff have investigated this case for some 12 months. The Network has interviewed to date some 16 witnesses who have had either eyewitness knowledge of the actual sighting or related contributing information to this continuing investigation. These witnesses have either been personally interviewed at either their homes or by phone. Some have only briefly "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"related their information to us and then declined further cooperation out of fear or government reprisals. 'It is the purpose of this paper to bring a concise report of The Long Island UFO Network's investigation to date so as to better inform the membership and public as to the findings surrounding this event. Based on the accumulated circumstantial evidence, we maintain that the United States Government, through the actions of the armed forces and the intelligence services, intercepted and retrieved an alien spacecraft from the waters of Moriches Bay on September 28, 1989. This action was a carefully planned and executed operation that was meticulously formulated some six months in advance. THE CONNECTICUT SIGHTINGS 'At 7:10 p.m. (Eastern) on the night of September 28, 1989, a young aerospace engineer in Torrington reported to noted UFO investigator, Philip Imbrogno, that he had observed a half-circle of very bright lights in the distance. Observing them from his home, he studied them through binoculars and determined that the object and its light were at an altitude of at least fifteen hundred feet at a distance of at least a mile and a half away. He stated that the object was hovering and that he observed it for at least several minutes. He saw the object eventually move, heading towards the North. 'Some thirty miles to the North in and around Torrington, motorists on Interstate 91 reported seeing a dark mass at low altitude composed of six to eight very bright amber lights slowly moving above them. These witnesses reported to Philip Imbrogno that the object was silent and blended into the night sky. They also stated that it was huge and larger than a football field in size. This is based on the testimony of witnesses who stated that the object was able to blot out the night sky as it passed over the highway. It so startled them that they had to pull their cars over to watch it pass. 'Later, there were reports that the object was seen in and around Hartford and West Hartford between 7:50 PM and 8:00 PM. Again, witnesses described an object composed of six to eight very large, bright amber lights. 'Later, at Hartford's International Airport, around 8:10 PM, airport workers observed a large boomerang object hovering above an unused tarmac at the airport that night. They watched as it lowered five alien creatures in a blue beam of light onto the ground. It is reported that they gave chase to one of the creatures and watched as it was lifted upwards into the object by another blue beam of light. Later that night, they are instructed by F.A.A. officials to keep silent about the incident. Several weeks later, a confidential source gave the information to Phil Imbrogno on the provision that his identity was never to be revealed. The object was described as a large boomerang, greater in size than a football field. It also had six large amber lights. 'At 8:05 PM, it was reported at Merrington. At 8:15 PM, in Trumbul, Milford and Easton. At 8:25 PM in Bridgeport, it was reportedly seen by motorists heading on a North-East course heading in the direction of Long Island. Heading on a South- easterly course, it would be in the area of eastern Long Island in a matter of minutes. 'With all these sightings in Connecticut, the news media paid scant notice to the many incidents. In all, Philip Imbrogno stated that he talked to some thirty-three witnesses. The description was the same in all cases. A very large object composed of six to eight large amber lights of tremendous magnitude was the common description. 'In October of 1989, John Ford told Phil Imbrogno of the incident on Long Island. In the course of conversation, it was agreed by Imbrogno and Ford not to publicly mention the airport incident or the type of object involved. This was to be kept a secret to serve as a litmus test in order to use its exact description as a yardstick to judge any witness or government statement concerning the sightings on Long Island as valid. Only a handful in LIUFON knew that the shape of the object was a triangular or boomerang type of object. It served its purpose well. IN THE BEGINNING 'The date was September 4, 1989. It was twenty-four days before the Moriches Bay incident occurred. John Fitzgerald and his son, Patrick, live in Bayshore. This was Labor Day, the last day of summer vacation before school began for 15-year-old Patrick. His father, John, decided that he and Patrick along with his two younger"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"brothers, ages 9 and 11, should go jogging this day. They decided that Gardner's State Park would be the ideal place for an afternoon run. Piling the boys into the family station wagon, John drove the kids over to the nature trail in the park. 'It was about 12:04 PM when John and Patrick were on the trail. John stated that he had no reason as to why he should have looked behind him when he observed the object. Patrick states that he turned to look as to where his two younger brothers were on the trail. 'John related to LIUFON investigators that he believes what he saw came in from the northwest heading southeast. He saw a giant, dark-colored boomerang object of immense size hovering briefly over an over pass of nearby Sunrise Highway. It was slowly moving towards them, gliding as he would say, not actually flying like a plane. He also had the impression that the object was floating since it bobbed up and down slightly. It was dark-colored, either black or dark grey, with no markings. As the craft passed overhead, he saw neither windows nor engine nacelles on the craft. Its surface was perfectly smooth. He also noticed that it was unusually quiet when the object drew near. There were no bird or insect noises. He estimated that the sighting was about one minute. 'Patrick, when interviewed by LIUFON investigators, related that he looked up to look for his brothers who were some distance behind them. As he looked, he saw what appeared to be a large boomerang object directly above them. It was dark colored, maybe black. It was smooth surfaced with no markings or windows. It was absolutely silent. He noticed that all the normal sounds of bird and insect activity had ceased which was exactly what his father had reported in his statement to LIUFON. 'The object then passed over them and disappeared. The father later recounted that he thought he saw a copy of the old YB-49 (Flying Wing), which was developed in the forties and fifties. This was an impossibility, since that aircraft was terminated in its development in the early fifties. It was, however, the best description he could give of what it reminded him of. His son, Patrick, a military scale model enthusiast, described it as possibly being the B-1 (Stealth Bomber) aircraft. Both he and his father lacked any real in-depth knowledge of the UFO phenomenon and decided that what they saw was a test flight of the B-1 Bomber. It was not until the fall of 1990 that they decided to contact LIUFON and make a report, especially when they read about the Moriches Bay case in local papers. [ Editor's Note: The B-1 bomber was never tested officially over Long Island, New York. It was produced by Rockwell in Palmdale, California, and tested mostly at Edwards AFB, California. Boeing writes about North American aviation history: \"The B-1 Lancer is a swing-wing bomber intended for high-speed, low-altitude penetration missions. By the end of 1977, three B-1As had made 118 flights with more than 21 hours at supersonic speeds. The next version was the B-1B. It first flew Oct. 18, 1984, could operate at 60,000 feet and had a range of more than 7,000 miles. B-1 Bomber, first flight was Dec. 23, 1974. Image courtesy of USAF and Boeing. \"Initial delivery to the Strategic Air Command took place in June 1985, at Dyess AFB, Texas. On Oct. 1, 1986, the B-1B achieved Initial Operational Capability and B-1Bs were based at Dyess AFB, Texas; Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota; McConnell AFB, Kansas; Robins AFB, Georgia; and Mountain Home AFB, Idaho. The first combat use of the B-1B was in December 1998 during operation Desert Fox, where the aircraft penetrated Iraqi air defenses to destroy Republican Guard barracks.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"B-2 Bomber, first public flight was 1993. Image courtesy of USAF and Northrup Grumman. About the B-2 bomber, manufacturer Northrup Grumman says: \"21 B-2s were delivered to Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, the first in December 1993.\" Where the B-2 Bomber was test flown is unknown.] LIUFON Report continues: 'The significance of this case will be more apparent as the reader of this special report continues to read on. The scientist from Brookhaven Laboratory, in his two meetings with John Ford, reported that the government was tracking this object since it had been reported in various areas of the metropolitan area. The scientist met with Ford in April and July of 1990. This case was reported and investigated in November of 1990. There was no way he could have known of the existence of this case, since LIUFON had not published this report until the November issue of the Long Island UFO Update. It was not public knowledge. 'The added significance of this sighting only serves to establish the fact that the scientist was right. There were sightings of large boomerang objects weeks before the Moriches Bay incident. SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1989: MORICHES BAY, LONG ISLAND 'Martha and Bruce Richardson are LIUFON investigators. As a husband and wife team, they are perhaps the best set of investigators in LIUFON. They are also avid boaters. 'They own a small cabin cruiser which is moored in the Moriches Bay Yacht Club basin during boating season. On this particular day, they decided to spend the warm September Sunday out on their boat. 'About 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon, Bruce noticed a group of at least five military helicopters in flight from the East. They were Army Huey helicopters which were painted dark green. 'As they roared in over the Bay, they formed a single line formation and began to fly a counter-clockwise flight rotation around the Bay and over the Dune area of Smith's Point Beach. This lasted for at least one hour before they left the area on a westerly heading. Both Martha and Bruce felt that this was some sort of training exercise, but for what purpose? SMITH'S POINT BEACH, AUGUST 1989 'The government of Suffolk County, New York, through the office of County Executive Halpern, announced in late August of that year the early closing of Smith's Point Beach County Campgrounds immediately after Labor Day in 1989. The announced reason for the early closing, the first in over 18 years, was due to the continuing budgetary crisis in the county government. There was not enough money to pay for keeping the campgrounds open past Labor Day. Usually, the practice has been to keep the campgrounds open until late October. 'As a result, there was a hue and a cry from Suffolk campers. Newsday, along with local papers ran articles about the crisis. Channels 12 and 55 gave top coverage to this unfortunate chain of events. 'On the night of September 28, 1989, there would be no campers in the campgrounds to observe the alleged UFO event. There would, however, be isolated surf fishers who would see something and later talk to LIUFON."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 'During the fall of 1990, the campgrounds were kept open past Labor Day well into late October as was the usual practice. THE WEST HAMPTON AIR NATIONAL GUARD FACILITY 'The news media in the metropolitan area ran major stories about the training program. The New York Daily News, The New York Post, The New York Times and Newsday ran major articles about the unique training that the New York State Air National Guard/Sea Rescue Unit at West Hampton was performing. 'Channels 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 12, and 55 gave coverage to this major honor on the eve of the resumption of the nation's Space Shuttle flights. It even showed the Air Guard training by jumping out of planes into the ocean off the South shore for the proposed event. It was major news for Long Island. It was part of the nation's space program again. 'It seems that Long Island's own was training to recover a spaceship from outside the Earth's atmosphere in case it ditched off the East coast upon takeoff or re-entry. A major contract was awarded by NASA to the guard unit to perform the function of rescuing the crew in case it went down off the East coast. CENTER MORICHES, LONG ISLAND, NEW YORK 'Residents in Center Moriches, who were questioned about the UFO incident in a twelve-block radius from the shoreline of Moriches Bay, reported to LIUFON tales of strange phenomena and unusual military activity. 'Many residents reported that summer periodic outages of their cable TV system and electric power from the Long Island Power Company. No satisfactory explanation was given by either company to subscribers. 'Some residents reported that on the night of the incident that they saw strange lights over the Bay which they thought were parachute flares dropped by the Air Force. 'It was not odd for the residents to say this since many of them were use to the constant army and air force training drills that summer which had been conducted much to the annoyance of the residents over Moriches Bay. Many took it to be the Air Guard training for the space shuttle missions which were to commence that fall. RICHARD STOUT 'Richard Stout is the co-founder of the Long Island UFO Network, Inc. He lives in Center Moriches, some twelve blocks from the Bay. When he and John Ford established the organization in April 1988, they spent thousands of dollars purchasing photographic and video equipment for the purpose of photographing UFOs. Mr. Stout, alone, spent some $5,000 on extreme low-light sensitive photographic equipment, along with professional quality 35mm cameras and telephoto lenses. 'In early September of that year, Mr. Stout's home was burglarized and all his photographic and video equipment were taken. A considerable amount of jewelry was also taken from the home. The other homes were also hit in the neighborhood that day by a young man driving an old Pontiac sedan. The police have never caught him. 'On the night of the incident, both Ford and Stout were some twelve blocks away at the Stout residence near the Bay. The two did not proceed to the Bay area to investigate since the cameras belonging to Stout had been stolen. KINGS PARK, LONG ISLAND, 5:30 PM, SEPTEMBER 28, 1989 'Mrs. Mary McLaughlin is a young housewife with two young boys. She and her husband live in the Kings Park section of Suffolk County, Long Island. Located on the North Shore of Long Island, Kings Park is a quiet middle class residential section of Suffolk County. 'That afternoon, Mary had the two boys home from school They were in the back of the house watching TV in the den. Mary was cleaning the house while dinner was cooking on the kitchen stove. Mary's routine was broken when she responded to the boys' calls to hurry to the den's rear window. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"'One of the boys had observed during the afternoon television session two large objects to the North from their house. He brought it to the attention of his younger brother who in turn watched them with his older brother. In bewilderment, they called for their mother to join them. 'Upon entering the room, Mary observed the two objects from the rear window. What they were, baffled her. There, at a distance of perhaps a mile and a half, were two large, triangular objects hovering in the sky. They were motionless, made no sound. She saw no windows, engines, wings or lights on the objects. Their surfaces were smooth and jet black. One of the objects was to the West while the other was in the East. The distance between the two was about a mile. In an instant, one object in the East, moved and joined the westerly object. It had moved up at an angle of 45 degrees and covered the distance in a second. 'In October 1990, her husband contacted us. Mary was afraid to talk to LIUFON for fear of ridicule. Instead, her husband John called in the report. 'The estimated size of the objects as seen from their house on Patiky Street in Kings Park was equal to that of an airliner seen at that distance. The objects were of equal dimensions. Both John and Mary are certain it was September 28, 1989, as the date of the occurrence. 'If correct, this sighting has changed the scope of the entire Moriches Bay incident's investigation. It places two large, triangular objects along the North Shore of Long Island about two hours before being seen throughout Connecticut. The aerial performance was beyond the capabilities of known aircraft. EAST MORICHES COAST GUARD STATION 'Beginning about six o'clock on the evening of September 28, 1989, witnesses who live near the East Moriches Coast Station in East Moriches, Long Island, reported unusual activity at the Coast Guard Base. Information supplied to LIUFON investigators indicate that a heavy influx of both military vehicles and civilian cars were seen along the entrance road to the Base compound. 'Many of the vehicles were left parked along the shoulder of the road when the base parking lot became filled. The vehicles remained there until late in the night. 'Information indicates that a military road block was imposed on the entrance road to the base to keep all civilian traffic from entering the area. If this information is true, a major military activity was underway that night. SHOREHAM, LONG ISLAND'S NORTH SHORE, 8:00 PM, 9/28/91 'Mona Rowe was driving home from an amateur orchestra rehearsal in Shoreham. She was on Route 25 heading West-bound to her home in Setauket. She observed to the North a formation of large amber lights in the sky. She paid no particular attention to them since she thought that they were either aircraft lights or flares. The lights just remained motionless in the sky. 'It was not until the month of April 1990 that she was contacted by Cheryl Clark of The News Review which is published in Riverhead, Long Island. The purpose was to confirm the involvement of Brookhaven Laboratories in the Moriches Bay incident. This was due to the story reportedly told by John Ford to a packed audience at Riverhead Library about the incident at a lecture on April 24, 1990. 'It was not until that time when she spoke to Miss Clark did Mrs. Rowe make the connection of the lights to the Moriches Bay incident. In her official capacity as a public relations official for Brookhaven Laboratories, she answered questions about the allegations made by Ford. 'Mrs. Rowe also witnessed the Moriches Bay object in its flight over Long Island's night-time sky. Mrs. Rowe was quoted in the April 26, 1990, edition of The News Review's story about the Moriches Bay incident. CALVERTON, LONG ISLAND, 8:00 PM, 9/28/89 'Mrs. P. G. and her fifteen-year-old son were on their way home from Hicksville on the night of September 28, 1989. P. G. had gone into Hicksville to pick up her teenage son who had spent the day with relatives in the area. They were on the Long Island Expressway, in the area of Calverton, Long Island, a very rural area of the Island with some farmland and woods."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 'They were eastbound towards their home in Riverhead when Mrs. P. G. noticed six large, bright amber lights over a field in the southeast from the expressway. The lights she first thought were similar to headlights, but were very large. 'It wasn't until she and her son got closer that she noticed the lights belonged to a very large triangular object. It was silhouetted against the night sky and appeared to be at least twice the size of a football field. The surface of the object appeared to be of a very dark texture, but the surrounding light from the area illuminated it sufficiently to give an outline of the object. She and her son were under the impression that it was something flown out of the Grumman Test Facility in Calverton a few miles away. 'P. G. and her son continued on their way to Riverhead. It wasn't until after the April 1989 Riverhead Library talk given by LIUFON that she gave a brief report to John Ford. She refused to submit a sighting report, but gave a drawing of the object to Ford along with a brief summary of the sighting. She also positively identified the photographs of the Moriches Bay object as being the same thing she saw over Calverton that night. 'P. G.'s identity is known to LIUFON. She lives in the Riverhead area of Long Island and is a New York State Civil Service employee. A reluctant witness, her sighting is taken seriously and places at least one of the objects in the Calverton area at least one hour before the incident over Moriches Bay. SOUTHHAMPTON COLLEGE, 8:00-8:30 PM, 9/28/89 'Susan G. is a reluctant witness. Her cooperation has been limited in this investigation. She did talk to LIUFON twice this year over the phone concerning her involvement in this incident. 'Susan states that she was driving home with her young daughter from Water Mill where she had been performing in a children's dance recital that evening. She was driving home a little after 8:00 PM on North Highway in Southhampton. She was heading West when she saw about a mile before Southhampton College a half circle of six to eight very large amber lights hovering over the highway. The lights were as intense as stadium lights. She could not see a structure behind the lights, but saw a dark mass and assumed that the lights were attached to it since they moved together. 'She stopped the car and swung it around to follow the object and learn what it was. It was South of her position and was very high in the sky. She estimated it at least 500 feet minimum altitude. The size of the thing she estimated to be at least 500 to 1,000 feet across. She, her husband and children live on a one acre lot in Southhampton and the object's size was greater than the width of her home plot. 'Pursuing the eastbound object, she reached the intersection of Tuccohoe Lane where she turned South and followed it to the shoreline. As she neared the end of Tuccohoe Lane near the water, the lights of the object turned off and whatever it was blended away into the night sky. It was gone. 'Susan related that the object blended in with the night sky and was totally silent with no engine sounds discernible. Susan reported the lights were unnaturally bright and lit up the night sky. 'Her sighting is important since what she saw was one of the two objects involved in the incident. It also places one of the objects off the coastline of the Southhampton and West Southhampton area where later an intense military air-sea rescue operation would be undertaken which was confirmed by government documents and eyewitnesses.'\" ontinued in Part 24 - Eyewitness Describes Moriches Bay 'UFO Retrieval' Credits"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe .
