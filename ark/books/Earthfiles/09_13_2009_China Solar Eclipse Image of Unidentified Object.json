K. Daily Mail S mall white object haloed in blue to left of red-white solar corona during July 22, 2009, total solar eclipse. Image © 2009 by Jijinshan Astronomical Observatory, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China. September 13, 2009 Nanjing, Jiangsu, China - Ji Haisheng, Director of the Jijinshan Astronomical Observatory in Nanjing, China, is upset that on September 7, 2009, U. K.'s Daily Mail used his quotes in an article headlined: “UFO ‘filmed for 40 minutes’ by Chinese scientists during solar eclipse.” Dr. Haisheng told CHINAdaily.com on September 12, “Obviously, there have been misunderstandings. That's false news. I said ‘an unidentified object,’ not ‘an unidentified flying object.’” Dr. Haisheng explained further that the bright spot might be “some coronal activity filmed during the total eclipse” and it could take a year to analyze and identify. Dr. Haisheng confirmed his observatory recorded 40 minutes of the solar corona during the total solar eclipse, not 40 minutes of a UFO. However, in Guangdong Province, some students studying the July 22, 2009, total solar eclipse from a rooftop photographed what they described as “a walnut-shaped” unidentified aerial object.
