Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon More Odd, Changing Aerial Light Patterns, Now Over Beavercreek, Oregon © 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe March 12, 2009 Beavercreek, Oregon - On January 29, 2009, I filed a 2-part Earthfiles report about more mysterious, multi-colored aerial light patterns photographed over Reno, Nevada, and Empire, Ohio. A week later, I received an email from a retired Wisconsin businessman in rural Elmwood, Wisconsin, who has taken more than one hundred digital still frames of a reappearing bright, aerial object. His images like all the others appear to be 3-dimensional, multi-colored patterns in the sky, changing shape every second or two. Today, I received similar images by email downloaded from the videotape of a woman who lives in Beavercreek, Clackamas County, Oregon, about 30 miles northeast of Salem. Subject: Unidentified lights Date: March 11, 2009 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com “ I'm writing to you for some feedback. I live about 30 miles from Salem, Oregon in the mountains in a little village called Beavercreek, Oregon (basically a couple of buildings and a gas station!). On March 11, at 12:30 AM, I couldn't sleep and happened to glance out my bedroom window to notice above the tree line what appeared to be a star flickering blue and red. It was in that position long enough that I was able to get binoculars to take a look and to see that it wasn't a star. I shot some footage on my digital zoom. I took some stills of the footage and enlarged it in Photoshop and got some interesting shapes that seem to have some commonality about them in terms of shape. I called the weather bureau to find out if they knew anything. They said it wasn't a weather balloon, but could have been some hot air balloon of some sort. There are hot air balloon enthusiasts in the Salem area, but what they'd be doing in the air on a cold night at 12:30 AM is beyond me! I've attached a few of the enlarged stills for you to take a look at.” "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" I f anyone has more information or images of such changing aerial patterns, please email: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.
