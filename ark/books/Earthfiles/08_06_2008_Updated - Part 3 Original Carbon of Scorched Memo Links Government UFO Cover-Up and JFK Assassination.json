It amazed me that my name was in the letter. And also, it says ‘ -1 ‘ to the left of the red FILE stamp at the bottom of this letter. That presumably was a way of identifying the leaker. We had other leaked documents from ‘-2,’ which was a different address and different kind of information. [ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “James Jesus Angleton (December 9, 1917 to May 12, 1987), known to colleagues as Jim and nicknamed ‘the Kingfisher.’ Angleton was the longest serving Chief of the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) Counter-intelligence (CI) staff from 1954 to 1974. The CIA recruited him in 1947 as the agency was first coming into existence. Angleton's internal CIA cryptonym (codename) was KU/MOTHER. His cover name was Hugh Ashmead. He turned his attentions to Russia's KGB and the Soviet nuclear weapons program with its probable reliance on technology leaked from the American Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb. In 1954, Allen W. Dulles, who had recently become Director of Central Intelligence, named Angleton head of the Counter-intelligence staff, a position Angleton retained for the rest of his CIA career. Dulles also assigned him responsibility for coordination with allied intelligence services.] IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THE LEAKER'S COVER LETTER, WHO IS 'AWD' WHO ‘WAS VERY FEARFUL OF DISCLOSURE?’ Allen W. Dulles. He was the Director of the CIA, and presumably MJ-1 up to 1961. He was a tough inside player. But, in November 1961, President John F. Kennedy replaced Alan Dulles with John McCone. McCone was also in charge of the CIA at the time of the November 22, 1963, assassination; Allen W. Dulles served on the Warren Commission, which investigated the assassination, and Allen W. Dulles signed the Warren Commission report cover letter."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"S ixth signature down is Allen W. Dulles, September 24, 1964, cover letter of President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, known as the “Warren Commission” after its Chairman, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Earl Warren. A llen Welsh Dulles (April 7, 1893 to January 29, 1969) was the first civilian and the longest serving Director of Central Intelligence (1953-1961). His professional civilian background was as a corporate lawyer and partner at Sullivan & Cromwell, an international law firm headquartered in New York, that is one of the world's most profitable and prestigious law firms. If, as the Eisenhower document says, the Director of the CIA is MJ-1 in the Majestic 12 group, who wrote the burned memo? Depending upon the date it was written - and we don't have a date - if it was written in 1963 shortly before JFK was assassinated, was the CIA Director then, John McCone, the MJ-12 memo writer? The fact that the author says, ‘Please submit your views no later than October’ after warning that ‘LANCER has made some inquiries regarding our activities which we cannot allow.’ For me, that seems to tie with 1963 events in which we have a Kennedy letter dated November 12, 1963, that asks for information from the CIA."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"N ovember 12, 1963 TOP SECRET Memorandum for Director, Central Intelligence Agency (name blacked out, but presumably John McCone) from President John F. Kennedy. SUBJECT: Classification review of all UFO intelligence files affecting National Security. AND JFK IS DEAD ONLY TEN DAYS AFTER HIS NOVEMBER 12, 1963, MEMO. Right. So, I’m inclined to believe the burned memo is October 1963 and that would mean the writer of the burned memo was John McCone, then CIA Director. But it might still have been Allen Dulles, the powerful insider, if he remained MJ-1 even after McCone was appointed to take his place in the CIA. Or the burned memo writer might also be Allen W. Dulles if it was written as early as 1961 when Dulles was head of the CIA. AWD is mentioned in the burned memo and clearly, the writer of the burned memo is identified as MJ-1. If the leaker of the burned memo to Timothy Cooper in 1999 is implying in his cover letter that AWD, Allen W. Dulles, was MJ-1, then the burn memo must have been written in 1961. WHEN DID YOU FIRST HAVE A COPY OF THE BURNED MEMO IN YOUR HAND? Probably 1999 because Tim Cooper called me about it in June and I think Ryan and I drove back there to see it. BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT IT WAS SO IMPORTANT. Ye s . ANY UNDERSTANDING WHY THE LEAKER SNATCHED THE BURN MEMO FROM THE FIRE? No. But the leaker apparently was a very senior guy in CIA counterintelligence, a right hand man to James Angleton, meaning the leaker’s name was probably well known. His cover letter was dated June 23, 1999. He might not be alive now. I don’t know. But certainly when the leaker wrote this letter in June 1999, he was a very coherent writer."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"WHO WAS CLOSEST TO JAMES ANGLETON IN THE CIA? I don't know. That's research that needs to be done. IN PARAGRAPH 2 OF THE LEAKER'S COVER LETTER, IT SAYS: ‘SALINA REQUESTED THAT THE MJ-12 DIRECTIVES BE SENT TO YOU AND HOPEFULLY, BE DISSEMINATED IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER.’ WHO IS SALINA? I think Salina was a secretary in counterintelligence to whom the burned memo was dictated. That’s my opinion. One of the things I got from Timothy Cooper is a note from Salina in her original handwriting dated June 5, 1996. Salina sent this note to Timothy Cooper in 1996 because it was accompanying other documents that were leaked. I believe this note is the one that sent the Oppenheimer and Einstein 5-page Project JEHOVA memo. So, she was transmitting other stuff at the time to Timothy Cooper. J une 5, 1996, note written by Salina to Timothy Cooper: “At my father's request (‘Cantwell’ - thought to be the CIA counter-intelligence operative under James Jesus Angleton), I'm sendi ng these pr ivate papers. Like my father, I w orked i n the Intel l igence Community. I'm a retired CIA employee with thirty years in CI (counter-intelligence) under Jim Angleton. There are clues to be found in these documents. I can say no more. Good luck. Salina.” TIMOTHY COOPER AND THE CIA LEAKER HAD A LONG-TIME RELATIONSHIP IN WHICH THE LEAKER SENT TIMOTHY COOPER DOCUMENTS – SOMETIMES A FEW AT A TIME OR ONE AT A TIME OR BUNCHES AT A TIME – AND ONE OF THE COMMON REFERENCES WAS A SALINA THAT YOU SPECULATE WAS A SECRETARY WORKING FOR THE OFFICE OF JAMES JESUS ANGLETON WHEN HE WAS CHIEF OF COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE FOR THE CIA BETWEEN 1954 AND 1974. Ye s . Tab A President's EYES ONLY"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"“The burned memo really tells a fascinating story. JFK is beginning to ask too many questions. We can’t allow this, in pretty much no kidding language. And MJ-1 (CIA Director) is saying, ‘I have some new policies I want you other six guys to agree (MJ-2,MJ-3, MJ-4, MJ-5, MJ-6, MJ-7) and let me know before October (presumed to be October 1963) that they are OK because we are going to put them in place. And these six policies are pretty interesting. The first Tab A says basically, if the President of the United States starts to ask questions, tell him it’s not a matter of national security. And then at the end it says that if the UFOs show up suddenly and we have to admit they are there, then we’ll give full disclosure as the law requires, which amazes me because that implies there is a law that says they (MJ-12) are supposed to disclose something. As far as I can tell so far, MJ-12 has not operated within any law. TO ME, THE MEMO IMPLIES THAT MJ-12 ALREADY KNOWS THAT UFOS DISPLAY HOSTILE INTENT AND WHAT THEY ARE MAKING A DISTINCTION IN THIS TAB A IS: ‘IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT UFOS OVERTLY DISPLAY HOSTILE INTENT’ – OVERTLY WOULD MEAN PUBLICLY. THE WORDS IMPLY THAT MJ-12 ALREADY KNOWS THERE HAS BEEN HOSTILE INTENT TOWARDS THE NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES. I read it without the word ‘overtly’ in my mind. But if you put in the word ‘overtly,’ you can attach your meaning to it, too. So, I would not dispute your interpretation. WOULD YOU CONTINUE WITH YOUR ELABORATION TAB BY TAB? Tab B “NEED-TO-KNOW” The second one, Tab B, basically says some people in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are getting to know too much, so we’ve got to tell J. Edgar Hoover that there’s something going on. But don’t tell him anything more than we have to and get as much out of him (Hoover) as possible, while we keep our CIA spies in place in the FBI. The ‘back"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"channel contacts’ means CIA guys working inside the FBI. Tab C DoD 5200.1 WHAT IS DOD NOTICE 5200.1? 5200.1 is just security rules concerning who gets access to classified material. The black stamp ‘CI’ is counter-intelligence. It’s a stamp the counterintelligence guys used under Angleton to distinguish their work from the rest of the CIA. You have to remember that the counter-intelligence people were basically the people trying to figure out whether the Soviets had planted spies within the CIA, so they had a measure of separateness from the rest of the CIA. That separateness was very important. CI could basically do whatever they wanted to do, as evidenced by the fact that’s where they put the MJ-12 program for control. Tab C is interesting for two reasons. First, it affirms the existence of SCEO (Sensitive Compartmented Executive Order) and also makes clear that apparently it's the 54/12 program that is exempt from that. Otherwise, all of the Department of Defense has no access to anything on MJ-12. SO, MJ-12 WAS UNDER THE CONTROL OF ANGLETON IN THE CIA'S COUNTER- INTELLIGENCE? I would say that’s what this memo implies. However, I would be quick to add that there are a lot of agencies in the United States and it is clear that the U. S. Navy had played a lead role in the past. And I believe it was the U. S. Army that retrieved the Cape Girardeau, Missouri, crash (1941). So, all these agencies had been snapping away to get control of the (E. T.) technologies by themselves. The CIA wound up with control of the official program for MJ-12, but I think there are other little pockets of UFO work in all the agencies – some of which were perhaps cleared for MJ-12 access and some, which were not. ALL COMPETING WITH EACH OTHER BECAUSE THEY WANTED ADVANCED EXTRATERRESTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES? Yes, I think so. That’s right. They were not caring about the public. They wanted the technologies. IS 54/12 THE SAME ENTITY AS MJ-12? No, I don't think 54/12 is the same as MJ-12, but apparently 54/12 was given some access to some parts of MJ-12. [ Update from Earthfiles viewer and Wikipedia: “ 54/12 was not in the Pentagon. This was a committee set up under NSC purview to review covert and clandestine operations. NSC, you recall is statutory and within the Executive Office of the President, so it was a very high level review committee concerning some of the most sensitive matters. Over the course of Administrations, its name has mutated ... 303 Committee, 40 Committee, Operations Advisory Group, NSC Special Coordination Committee, National Security Planning Group.” Wikipedia - 54/12: “Since 1954, oversight of United States covert operations has been carried out by a series of sub-committees of the United States National Security Council. Oversight of covert operations was brought under"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"the control of the National Security Council by the creation of the Planning Coordination Group in 1954. The Planning Coordination Group was created by President Eisenhower's Presidential Directive 5412/1 on March 15, 1954. The group, initially, was headed by Special Assistant to the President for Foreign Affairs, Nelson Rockefeller. The NSC 5412/2 Special Group , often referred simply as the Special Group, was an initially secret, but later public, subcommittee of the United States National Security Council responsible for coordinating government covert operations. Presidential Directive NSC 5412/2, issued December 28, 1954, assigned responsibility for co-ordination of covert actions to representatives of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the President respectively. The Federation of American Scientists list of national security documents for the Eisenhower administration does not show a directive 5412/2. It does, however, show a 5412/1 with a classified title (one of only three such documents for the entire Eisenhower administration). 303 Committee - The covert actions oversight group was renamed the 303 Committee after National Security Action Memorandum No. 303 on June 2, 1964. McGeorge Bundy, National Security Advisor, became Chairman for that committee. The successor to the Special Group was the 40 Committee. The 40 Committee was a division of the Executive branch of the United States government whose mandate was to review proposed major covert actions. In 1970, the 40 Committee played a major role in so called ‘Track I’ efforts to prevent Salvador Allende from taking office following the Chilean popular vote of September 4, 1970. Operations Advisory Group - On February 18, 1976, the 40 Committee was replaced by the Operations Advisory Group, in accordance with Executive Order 11905 issued by Gerald Ford. The new group was composed of the President's Assistant for National Security Affairs, the Secretaries of State and Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Director of Central Intelligence. NSC Special Coordination Committee - The following year on May 13, 1977, President Jimmy Carter issued Executive Order 11985, which updated the previous order such that the Operations Advisory Group thereafter would be known as the NSC Special Coordination Committee. National Security Planning Group - Under the Reagan administration, the Special Coordination Committee was replaced by the National Security Planning Group which included the Vice-President, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, the Assistant for National Security Affairs, and the Director of the CIA.” ] I think a number of people have concurred that President Eisenhower lost control to the MJ-12 program. The MJ program did things the way they wanted. In fact, that was the time that MJ-12 allegedly started to go and put some of the civilian contractors in charge – sort of took MJ-12 research out of the government and made the government clean so that when you ask the government, ‘What do you know about MJ-12?’ The honest answer is, ‘We don’t know squat.’ YOU MEAN PUTTING MJ-12 OUT INTO CORPORATIONS LIKE BECHTEL? Yeah, putting some of the responsibilities out into the corporations so the paperwork was not under government control and they could use security systems that separated it from the government. THIS MIGHT RELATE TO PRESIDENT EISENHOWER’S WARNING WHEN HE WENT OUT OF OFFICE ABOUT THE ‘MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX’? Yes, I think so. THAT’S CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTANDING THIS BURN MEMO. WHY IS IT THAT THE MJ-12 FORCES FROM TRUMAN TO KENNEDY WOULD SUDDENLY BE IN A HOSTILE POSITION WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WHO IN"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"THE BURN MEMO IS REFERRED TO AS ‘LANCER.’ Yes, right. And apparently that was a code name (for JFK) that was pretty well protected at that time. BUT TAB A IS ABOUT KEEPING ALL OF THIS KNOWLEDGE FROM ‘LANCER’. Exactly. And Lancer in his November 12, 1963, letter is basically saying he’s going to start a program to share all this stuff with the Soviet Union. That scared the hell out of them (MJ-12)! THAT WOULD BE THE REASON THAT YOU SUSPECT JFK WAS ASSASSINATED BY THE CIA THROUGH SOMEBODY? Yes. Actually jumping to the bottom line: As far as I know, this ‘burned memo’ is the only document that I’ve ever heard anyone claim could be the authorization to kill President John F. Kennedy. It’s written evidence that could be entered into a court as the authorization to kill Kennedy. Tab D Project BLUE BOOK In my judgment, the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) probably established Blue Book in a two-part way. One part was only slightly classified, which is the one we all know about. The other was highly covert, which was to take the information we were getting from the public and run it into MJ-12 to figure out how to use it. Perhaps also, they might have had a misinformation component. I think the thing that is significant to me is the reference to the NIE, the National Intelligence Estimate. That’s pretty important that the MJ-12 BLUE BOOK/MAJIC actually got in there. MEANING THAT THE COVERT PROJECT BLUE BOOK WAS DESCRIBED IN THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE. At least at that time in the early 1960s, which sure contradicts the misinforming public BLUE BOOK that pretty much said there was nothing to UFOs even to investigate.

AND IN THAT PREVIOUS TAB D, ‘REFERENCE TO BLUE BOOK IS AUTHORIZED ONLY WHEN RESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRIES.’"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"THAT MEANS THIS IS MJ-12’S WAY OF KEEPING EVERYBODY ELSE AT AN ARM’S LENGTH DISTANCE FROM THE TRUTH. Exactly. And Tab E doesn’t even extend to Congressional inquiries. Basically it implies everybody (is off limits from knowing E. T. facts). No one who asks, including the U. S. President, has a right to know. Tab F PSYOP So, Tab F re-affirms that ‘the authorization to interrogate and detain any and all targets.’ Basically that says that none of the basic rights that we thought we had apply in this area. THAT THE U. S. CONSTITUTION WAS NOT EVEN BEING RESPECTED BACK IN THE EARLY 1960S, AS FAR AS MJ-12 WAS CONCERNED. Precisely. That’s an excellent way to put it. Yes. Tab F is overt evidence that the U. S. Constitution was being ignored. WHAT WE DON’T KNOW IS EXACTLY WHAT PROJECT PSYOP IS AND WHO IT WAS UNDER? That’s certainly true, yes. I was just assuming that Project PSYOP was the sort of general project that tried to cleverly contain, using psychological operations that were standard. In other words, keeping the public in the dark (about E. T.s) using subtle techniques, such as movies created to attune the public to various (E. T.-related) ideas and advertisements and false press releases – the whole genera of things the psyops guys use to keep us in the public confused. IF THERE WERE AN EYEWITNESS WITH PHOTOGRAPHS AND VIDEOTAPE, THEN THIS ‘GREEN’ UNIT WOULD HAVE THE AUTHORIZATION TO INTERROGATE AND DETAIN ANY AND ALL TARGETS? Yes, UFO history is filled with excellent records of two or three guys in black taking away an eyewitness’s stuff and interrogating them and telling the eyewitness/es that nothing happened. HOW IRONIC THAT THE MEN IN BLACK MIGHT HAVE BEEN WORKING DIRECTLY FOR PROJECT GREEN. Right, exactly (laughs). Ta b G B W In Tab G, the BW means biological warfare."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"WHAT ARE ‘SPIKE,’ ‘HOUSE CLEANING,’ ‘MK-ULTRA,’‘ARTICHOKE’ and ‘DOMESTIC’? SPIKE, HOUSE CLEANING, ARTICHOKE and DOMESTIC, I think are all unknown. I’m still looking for people who claim to know something about those projects. MK-ULTRA, of course, has been released and discussed and basically that was a CIA project that did a lot of unconstitutional testing. I think the part they have admitted to was the use of psychedelic drugs without permission of the subjects. If you look up MK-ULTRA in the public record, I think you’ll find a lot of bad stuff that has been released. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Project ARTICHOKE was a CIA project that researched interrogation methods and arose from project BLUEBIRD on August 20, 1951, run by the Office of Scientific Intelligence. A memorandum by Richard Helms to CIA director Allen Welsh Dulles indicated ARTICHOKE became Project MKULTRA on April 20, 1953. The project studied hypnosis, forced morphine addiction (and subsequent forced withdrawal), and the use of other chemicals, among other methods, to produce amnesia and other vulnerable states in subjects. ARTICHOKE was an offensive program of mind control that gathered together the intelligence divisions of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and FBI. In addition, the scope of the project was outlined in a memo dated January 1952 that stated, ‘Can we get control of an individual to the point where he will do our bidding against his will and even against fundamental laws of nature, such as self preservation?’ Project MK-ULTRA, or MKULTRA, was the code name for a covert CIA mind-control and chemical interrogation research program, run by the Office of Scientific Intelligence, that began in the early 1950s and continued at least through the late 1960s. There is much published evidence that the project involved the surreptitious use of many types of drugs, as well as other methodology, to manipulate individual mental states and to alter brain function. Project MK-ULTRA was first brought to wide public attention in 1975 by the U.S. Congress, through investigations by the Church Committee, and by a presidential commission known as the Rockefeller Commission. Investigative efforts were hampered by the fact that CIA Director Richard Helms ordered all MK-ULTRA files destroyed in 1973. The Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the relatively small number of documents that survived Helms' destruction order. Although the CIA insists that MK-ULTRA-type experiments have been abandoned, 14-year CIA veteran Victor Marchetti has stated in various interviews that the CIA routinely conducts misinformation campaigns and that CIA mind control research continued. In a 1977 interview, Marchetti specifically called the CIA claim that MK-ULTRA was abandoned a ‘cover story.’ On the Senate floor in 1977, Senator Ted Kennedy said: ‘The Deputy Director of the CIA revealed that over thirty universities and institutions were involved in an ‘extensive testing and experimentation’ program, which included covert drug tests on unwitting citizens ‘at all social levels, high and low, native Americans and foreign.’ Several of these tests involved the administration of LSD to ‘unwitting subjects in social situations.’ At least one death, that of Dr. [Frank] Olson, resulted from these activities. The Agency itself acknowledged that these tests made little scientific sense. The agents doing the monitoring were not qualified scientific observers.” ] Robert Wood: “I’d love to know what SPIKE, HOUSE CLEANING, ARTICHOKE and DOMESTIC are. But, if you give them (MJ-12) the benefit of the doubt, you could say that if there were contamination from an (E. T.) pathogen in the public, MJ-12 wants to control it and contain it to save as many lives as possible. WHAT ARE ‘CONVENTIONAL METHODS’ CONCERNING SPIKE, HOUSE CLEANING AND ARTICHOKE? Presumably the less conventional methods are probably less constitutional, too. (laughs) That would be my guess."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"THAT SPIKE, HOUSE CLEANING, ARTICHOKE AND DOMESTIC ARE PROBABLY OUTSIDE THE BOUNDS OF LIBERTIES PROTECTED BY THE CONSTITUTION? I would suspect so. Anyway, it’s an alert – stay alert for anything having to do with ARTICHOKE, DOMESTIC, HOUSE CLEANING and SPIKE. I would like to know what those projects were - or are! IT'S DISTURBING THAT MJ-12 WOULD BE HAVING COMMUNICATION ABOUT BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS. Basically anything involving the aliens (E. T.s), it’s clear that there was and is genuine concern that some of the diseases that aliens might have could be problems for us. IN THE MAJESTIC 12 DOCUMENTS RELEASED AT RYAN’S MAJESTICDOCUMENTS.COM WEBSITE, THERE IS THE WHITE HOT MAJESTIC DOCUMENT AND THE INTERPLANETARY PHENOMENON UNIT DOCUMENT, WHICH DISCUSS THE DEATHS OF SABOTAGE ALERT TEAMS CALLED IN TO GATHER UP THE NON-HUMAN BODIES IN NEW MEXICO THE FIRST WEEK OF JUY 1947. That’s a good point. There certainly are cases such as the technicians who died in 1947 after they were taken to Los Alamos. THOSE WERE TECHNICIANS THAT SPECIFICALLY WERE IN SOME KIND OF PROTECTIVE SUITS THAT HANDLED THE BODIES OF WHAT WERE DESCRIBED AS ‘EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL BODIES’ AT CRASH SITES. Exactly. There are a few cases like this where you can associate aliens and illnesses. But not to the extent that you can be specific about what pathogen was involved or what the treatments were or what kind of procedures would have been used for a public emergency. My guess is that these projects, SPIKE, HOUSE CLEANING, ARTICHOKE and DOMESTIC might be responses to an ‘Andromeda strain.’ FROM EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES? Yes, right. Reasonable things to do. Not everything that MJ-12 does is necessarily evil! (laughs) They were trying to make sure that our human enemies did not get more technology than we did. In the process, they decided their objectives were so important that they did not have to worry about the U.S. Constitution. And that was bad. THAT BRINGS US TO THE FINAL PAGE OF THE BURNED MEMO, WHICH IS PERHAPS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF ALL IN THE CONTEXT OF AN AGENCY IN THE GOVERNMENT TRYING TO KEEP THE PUBLIC AND THE MEDIA FROM KNOWING THE FACTS ABOUT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT AGENTS DO KNOW: THAT THERE ARE EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES INTERACTING WITH PLANET EARTH. Tab H Project ENVIRONMENT TAB H SAYS: ‘Draft, Directive Regarding Project ENVIRONMENT. When conditions become non-conducive for growth in our environment and Washington cannot be influenced any further, the weather is lacking any precipitation (misspelled as percipitation in memo) ... it should be wet.’ CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS?"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Well, it’s four thoughts there. The first thought is when ‘conditions become non-conducive for growth.’ I think that means that if MJ-12 is not going to get any money, or no more money, or their money is going to be cut off completely ‘in our environment.’ ‘And Washington cannot be influenced any further.’ That means the people who control this covert money are not coming up with it. MEANING COVERT BLACK BUDGET MONEY TO KEEP MJ-12 FUNCTIONING? Yes. Exactly right, which is presumably somewhere between not trivial and huge! And the ‘weather is lacking any precipitation.’ I’m reading that to mean that there is no more money coming down from the heavens like it has in the past. Then, ‘it should be wet’ is a reference to ‘wet works,’ or ‘wet affairs,’ which originated in Russia, actually in the 19th Century from a Russian phrase where apparently if you killed somebody during a burglary, it was called ‘wet’ in Russian because of the blood. BECAUSE OF THE BLOOD? Yes, because of the blood. That word got used in the intelligence community in the KGB to describe assassinations. That was picked up by the intelligence communities around the world apparently. At this point, you have to go back to the scenario that was involved. I would presume that the scenario involved is that MJ-1 is dictating this burned memo to a secretary. He, MJ-1, does not want the secretary to know that he is saying, ‘We ought to kill JFK.’ So MJ-1 was using arcane language to conceal that from the secretary, but all of his (MJ-12) readers would know exactly what he meant. So, that’s my speculation on the phrase, ‘it should be wet.’ THIS IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY ... MJ-1, yes. WHO IS ADDRESSING MJ-2 THROUGH 7. ON THIS LAST PAGE OF THE BURNED MEMO, IN THE CONTEXT OF SOVIET SPY ACTIVITY AND ASSASSINATION HISTORY THAT HAS USED THE TERM ‘WET’ TO SIGNAL KILLING, ‘SHOULD BE WET,’ MEANS TO ASSASSINATE.
