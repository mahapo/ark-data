He had two canisters of 35mm footage with him. ...He told me directly that it was actual footage of the UFOs on the ground.” - M ike Verrano, RAF Bentwaters Capt. and Day Shift Commander, December 1980 R eturn to Part 1 July 22, 2009 Phoenix, Arizona - Eight years after the Rendlesham Forest mysterious aerial light encounters, on October 14, 1988, actor Mike Farrell hosted UFO Cover-Up: Live!, a two-hour prime time syndicated television special that was broadcast in North America. What happened behind the scenes was a secret hypnosis session with John Burroughs on November 11, 1988, after the TV broadcast. A producer wanted to find out what happened to John Burroughs near the lights and the rumor that John either “jumped up” on a craft or was lifted upward in a beam of light. John was confused by the rumor because he could not clearly remember what happened when he was near the lights in Rendlesham Forest on either the early morning of December 26, with Jim Penniston, or with Adrian Bustinza on the early morning of December 28. I’m now going to share brief excerpts from the unpublicized November 11, 1988, John Burroughs hypnosis session in which John is the only one speaking to the hypnotherapist and TV producer, but John quotes various military personnel he is hearing in his hypnotic state beginning with what the Shift Commander was saying.

Afterward, John Burroughs went to bed to sleep the rest of December 26, 1980, and woke up in the early morning of December 27, feeling like something had returned. Burroughs was told that a female Shift Commander was driving in her jeep when a blue light stopped her vehicle. The blue light moved inside her jeep and back out. The blue light scared her so much she cried and was relieved of her duty for the night. So, Burroughs decided to return to Rendlesham Forest after midnight on December 28, 1980, with a couple of friends. By 2 AM, December 28, lots of military people showed up with a light-all and other military and photography equipment. John Burroughs asked what was going on? An answer came from a military man nearby."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"S ome brief military personnel background: The RAF Bentwaters base commander in December 1980 was Col. Ted Conrad, who had not been on the job very long. His Deputy Base Commander was Lt. Col. Charles I. Halt. Their boss was the Wing Commander of the 81st Tactical Fighter Wing at Bentwaters/Woodbridge, Major General Gordon Edmund Williams. About Gen. Williams, in their 1997 book, Left At East Gate , Larry Warren and Peter Robbins quote Captain and Day Shift Commander, Mike Verano, as saying: “I did drive General Gordon Williams to an F-16 on the Bentwaters tarmac the AM of D ecember 30th. He had two canisters of 35mm footage with him. ...He told me directly that it was actual footage of the UFOs on the ground.” Back inside the November 11, 1988, private hypnosis of John Burroughs organized by TV producer, Curt Brubaker, John is saying:"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" C ontinued in Part 4 - John Burroughs and Jim Penniston hypnosis sessions.
