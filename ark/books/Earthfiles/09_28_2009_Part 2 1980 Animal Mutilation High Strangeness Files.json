R eturn to Part 1 September 28, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - In this series of Real X-Files, I am sharing my private 1980 files of high strangeness. But before I continue with those unpublished files, I want to insert a brief history of the American government's own TOP SECRET files related to UFO crash retrievals and the animal mutilation phenomenon. Since the May 1980 broadcast of my television documentary A STRANGE HARVEST, I have tried to find facts about the important question: What does the United States government know about animal mutilations linked to non-human entities and technologies retrieved from crashed discs which have provoked an American policy of misinformation and denial in the interest of national security since at least 1947? Back in 1983, while working on a documentary project for Home Box Office entitled, UFOs: The E.T. Factor , I met an elderly rancher who lived in Corona, New Mexico. He said he had known Mac Brazel, the rancher who found strange debris on his land and went to the Roswell Sheriff to report his discovery on July 4, 1947. The Corona resident told me, “I heard there was a horrible secret about that crash.” Perhaps the answer to the “horrible secret” is the fear and shock that President Truman and his close associates felt when they allegedly learned that dissected humans and/or humanoids and animal parts were found in at least two of the UFOs that crashed in New Mexico in early July 1947. Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit One of the many important documents gathered by Bob and Ryan Wood and displayed for study at their website, www.majestic12documents.com, is entitled: TOP SECRET ULTRA INTERPLANETARY PHENOMENON UNIT SUMMARY INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT File Ref. 001947122-A.1206. This IPU document states: “The extraordinary recovery of fallen airborne objects in the state of New Mexico, between 4 July - 6 July 1947: This Summary was prepared by Headquarters Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit, Scientific and Technical Branch, Counterintelligence Directorate, as requested by A.

FILE COPY Three Disc Crash Retrievals Between July 4-6, 1947 On Page 6 of the IPU Assessment, five alien bodies are described as they were found with a crashed aerial vehicle at a site on the northern end of the White Sands Missile Range in early July 1947. The site is called LZ-2 in the report, which means, “Landing Zone 2” on White Sands territory between the Trinity Site and Oscura Peak. Landing Zone 1 is defined as the crash site between Corona and Roswell. A third Landing Zone 3 is defined as 30 miles east of Alamogordo near the Mescalero Apache Indian Reservation. All three crashes occurred between July 4 and July 6, 1947, according to the MJ-12 report."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I PU Assessment describes three UFO crash/retrieval sites referred to as Landing Zones1, 2 and 3, that occurred between July 4 and 6, 1947.

LZ-3 east of Alamogordo near the Mescalero Apache Indian Reservation southeastern border. Map by Linda Moulton Howe. On Page 2, Paragraph 4, the IPU Intelligence Assessment states: “On arrival at LZ-2, personnel assessed the finds as not belonging to any aircraft, rocket, weapons, or balloon test that are normally conducted from surrounding bases. First reports indicated that the first crash investigators from Roswell AAF that LZ-1 was the remains of a AAF top secret MOGUL balloon project. When scientists from the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory arrived to inspect LZ-2, it became apparent to all concerned that what had crashed in the desert was something out of this world.” I PU Intelligence Assessment, Page 2, Paragraph 4. Description of Humanoid Bodies Recovered at LZ-2, White Sands Proving Ground Further along in the IPU Intelligence Assessment, Paragraph 11 states: “As to the bodies recovered at LZ-2, it appeared that none of the five crew members survived entry into our atmosphere due to unknown causes. DR. DETLEV BRONK has been asked to assist in the autopsy of one well preserved cadaver to be done by MAJOR CHARLES E. REA. From what descriptions the team was able to learn and from photographs taken by intelligence photographers, the occupants appear in most respects human with some anatomical differences in the head, eyes, hands and feet. They have a slight build about five feet tall, with grayish-pink skin color. They have no hair on their bodies and clothed with a tight fitting flight suit that appears to be fire proof (some of the bodies looked as if they had been burned on head and hands). Their overall stature reminds one of young children. It is believed that there were male and female genders present, but was hard to distinguish."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I PU Intelligence Assessment, Paragraph 11. “Bodies Disected (sic) As You Would A Frog” “The most disturbing aspect of this investigation was there were other bodies found not far from LZ-1 that looked as if they had been disected (sic) as you would a frog. It is not known if army field surgeons had performed exploratory surgery on these bodies. Animal parts were reportedly discovered inside the craft at LZ-2 but this cannot be confirmed. The team has reserved judgement on this issue.” [Bold emphasis by Howe.] T OP SECRET ULTRA Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit Summary Intelligence Assessment, Paragraph 12, about dissected bodies found near crashed UFO at Landing Zone-1 between Corona and Roswell and animal parts discovered inside the non-human craft at Landing Zone-2, Trinity Site, White Sands Proving Ground, NM. The IPU document does not make clear what he type of dissected bodies were - human? animal? non-human? Apparently those “disected (sic) bodies” were found on the ground “not far from Landing Zone-1” at the Corona site. But whatever the dissected bodies were, in addition to the discovery of animal parts inside the craft at the White Sands Landing Zone-2, that disturbing physical evidence must have scared President Truman and his colleagues so badly that they all agreed a tight lid must be placed on UFOs. A policy of complete denial in the interest of national security was demanded while the President and his advisers tried to learn more and figure out what they were up against. Thus, the National Security Act of 1947 created the Central Intelligence Agency, the Majestic-12 Special Studies Group and presidential executive orders that required everyone associated with the extraterrestrial investigation to deliberately lie to and misinform the press and the public in order to prevent panic and sustain national security.

C olorado bovine's left side of head removed cleanly to bone; tongue removed deep in the throat; eyeball removed with excision of tissue around eye, and left ear removed on July 26, 1977. I began to investigate the worldwide animal mutilation phenomenon back in the fall of 1979. Eleven years before then in 1968, I had graduated from Stanford University with a Masters Degree in Communication in which I made documentaries at the Stanford Medical Center and the Stanford Linear Accelerator. Then I was hired by the NBC television affiliate in Los Angeles to do news reporting and documentaries. Later I was hired by Boston's WCVB-TV (ABC) to produce medical and science programs that were honored as part of the station's Peabody Award for programming excellence. After a family move to Colorado, I was hired to be Director of Special Projects at the CBS television station in Denver, KMGH-TV. There I produced, wrote, directed, edited and reported documentary films and live television studio programs about science, medical and environmental issues, which were honored with a national Emmy nomination, several regional Emmys, Ohio State awards, Denver and Chicago Film Festivals best documentaries and other journalism awards. In the summer of 1979, dozens of animal mutilations were reported in Colorado again as they had been periodically since the 1960s. I wanted to get to the bottom of what was causing the unusual animal deaths and began an investigation which produced the documentary, A Strange Harvest, which received a 1981 regional Emmy. L inda Moulton Howe's A Strange Harvest hour television documentary received a regional Emmy in 1981. See Earthfiles Shop for more information. The bizarre, bloodless animal mutilations were not happening only in Colorado. Animal mutilations were occurring all over the United States, Canada and many other countries, all with the same pattern of tissue removed from their bodies: an ear, an eye, a circle of flesh around the eye, half the jaw flesh, the tongue removed in a vertical cut deep within the throat, as in this Sterling, Colorado, case back in the summer of 1976, and the mutilated Caldwell, Kansas, cow in 1992."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"M utilated cow's head on the Budin ranch in Sterling, Colorado, 1976.

Also, the yellow arrow points at two missing teeth. This is a common characteristic of many mutilated cows, but not widely reported. Back in 1980 after my documentary, A Strange Harvest, was first broadcast, I received a call from Lynn Lauber, head of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's (RCMP) animal mutilation investigation in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. He admitted to me that the common Calgary newspaper explanation of Satanic cults was not true, that he had no evidence. Further, he said many of the mutilated cattle there had two teeth taken from either the upper or lower jaw, but he was keeping that fact to himself in his investigations. I told him that Colorado law enforcement and I had also talked about missing teeth at mutilation sites and I agreed to keep that fact confidential as well.

The United States military had knowledge of Something coming from the skies and killing and mutilating animals around the world since at least the early 1950s according to retired U. S. Army Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso, now deceased, who wrote the important 1997 book, The Day After Roswell."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"In his book, Col. Corso described many advanced technologies that the United States government retrieved from crashed non-human aircraft and back-engineered. One of those technologies, according to Col. Corso, was what came to be known as a laser scalpel in modern Earth medicine. On Page 47 of his book, Col. Corso wrote: “Why did the extraterrestrial inhabitants of the craft have a cutting device like this aboard their ship? It wasn't until later, when I read highly classified military reports of cattle mutilations in which entire organs were removed without any visible trauma to the surrounding cell tissue, that I realized that the light-beam cutting torch...was being used by the aliens in medical experiments on our livestock.” G raphic of laser scalpel surgery on eye. Before he died, Col. Corso talked to me in private about the many classified documents he had seen in Washington, D. C., when he returned from his World War II assignment in Italy. He told me that he had read with his own eyes highly classified reports dated as early as 1951 about animals found in several parts of the world with bloodless excisions and no tracks around them, not even the dead animal's own tracks, implying the mutilated animal had been dropped to the ground from the air. Col. Corso said classified government reports he read specified that the animal mutilators were “extraterrestrial biological entities.” U. S. Army Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso with Linda Moulton Howe at 50th anniversary event in Roswell, New Mexico, July 4, 1997. Animal mutilations was such a sensitive and classified subject, Col. Corso told me, because the United States government was scared that if the public knew Something from outer space was able to pick up heavy animals in beams of light, remove tissue and liquids with instruments that cut with light and perhaps sound frequencies, then return the animals dead and mutilated to pastures - Americans, and the world, would panic. Also, the advanced technologies needed to be kept out of the hands of human enemies and developed and patented by American companies."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"S ketch of silver disc in Missouri horse pasture where several mutilated foals had been found in mid-1970s.

I think the Corona rancher's reference to a “horrible secret” at the Corona, New Mexico, crash had to do with the worldwide animal mutilation phenomenon, which seems linked to a large scale genetic harvest of this planet.
