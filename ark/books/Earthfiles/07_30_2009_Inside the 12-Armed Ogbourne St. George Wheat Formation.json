July 30, 2009 Yatesbury, Wiltshire, England - I arrived at Heathrow Airport in London around NOON on Friday, July 24th, and it was raining. On the drive out the M4 to Wiltshire, it was still raining. It was so muddy at the Kennet Canal where good friends of mine, Gill and Robert Nicholas, invited me to spend a couple of days with them on their houseboat, that Gill had to loan me knee-high rain boots.

All that cold rain underscores how miraculous the large wheat formation was between Ogbourne St. George and Barbury Castle first re ported Friday morning, July 24, only a few hours before my plane landed while it was still raining. But Gill and I had no computer to see the Cropcircleconnector.com aerials such as those below by Frank Laumen of VisibleSigns.de and professional aerial photographer and crop formation researcher, Lucy Pringle. In fact, after we found other confused people trying to find the new Ogbourne crop formation without success, we finally encountered some Norwegians who parked and yelled, “Follow us!” And we took off along a ridgeway - for two miles - before we even came to a place where we could see the amazing pattern down below us, but still very far away.

Image © 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe. Then we had to go down a steep sheep pasture hillside to get to the edge of the wheat field. There we found a zigzagging path right through the wheat, which most crop formation enthusiasts will never do to avoid damaging the crop. Instead, crop formation etiquette is always to find tractor tramlines that can be walked to the formation. Later we learned that the farm owner was enraged on Friday and had chased early people in the formation away. So, perhaps he made the zigzag path through his own wheat? When we walked another several hundred feet, we finally got to the edge of the huge pattern. One of the first features that struck Gill and me as unusual was one of the larger circles around the center core was “woven” or “faceted” as if to project a 3-dimensional image from the air, as some formations that appear disheveled on the ground turn out to create 3-dimensions in aerial images. But when we finally saw aerials at Cropcircleconnector.com, curiously, we cannot detect the faceted circle that was so prominently different from the other eleven on the ground inside the formation. C riss-crossed, disheveled “facets” of wheat inside only one of twelve larger circles around the central core of the Ogbourne St. George formation. Often these seemingly chaotic lays create 3-dimensional impressions from the air. Image © 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe. Another impressive feature of the Ogbourne 12-armed pattern is there were different weaves in each of the 48 small circles throughout the formation, some exquisite fountains surrounded by unbroken rings of standing wheat. One circle had a “bouquet” of wheat heads arranged artistically in the center of a small circle. O ther striking features were the different weaves in each of the 48 small circles throughout the formation.

Eventually I got down on my hands and knees and started lifting up the surface layers of the formation in dozens of places and I found layer upon layer stacked in 90-degree cross hatches and often topped off by a fifth, sixth or even seventh layer that was going 45"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"degrees to the 90-degree cross-hatching layers underneath.

I walked the formation’s main corridor that runs north-south from a lower altitude to higher altitude and found the place where the north-south axis crossed the farmer’s tractor tramlines. That means that the creators of the 12-arm pattern did not utilize the existing tramlines, but oriented the whole pattern on its own axis.
