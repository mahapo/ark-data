R. Leslie, former Security Platoon, 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry, 25th Division, Oaho, Hawaii U . S. Army's Schofield Barracks, near center of Oahu, Hawaii. July 14, 2007 Longmont, Colorado - Schofield Barracks is the largest Army post in Hawaii, located on 18,000 acres near the center of Oahu. Schofield Barracks has been the home of the U. S. Army's 25th Infantry, known as the Tropic Lightning Division, since 1941. S chofield Barracks valley near center of Oahu, Hawaii. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"In the fall of 1963, 22-year-old C. R. (\"Charley\") Leslie had been in the Army for three years after high school working in the Security Platoon and Brigade Band of the 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry of the 25th Division. \"When we went into the jungle, we provided security for the battalion headquarters guy who was either a Lt. Colonel (silver oak leaf) or full bird Colonel (silver eagle). Charley also was assigned to be the \"barracks Sergeant\" after the day staff left until the next morning when the day staff returned to work. Before sunup on a morning in either October or November 1963, Charley, his platoon and one infantry company were assembled in the barracks quadrangle for reveille. It was about 5:30 AM. The rest of the battalion was away on a 30-day field maneuver, leaving about 180 men under the leadership of a 1st Lieutenant Officer of the Day. What happened next has puzzled Charley over the 43 years since the event, which he has never talked about publicly until now.

(\"Charley\") Leslie, Former Schofield Barracks (Oahu, Hawaii) Security Platoon, 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry, 25th Division, now retired in Longmont, Colorado: \"So, we fell out for reveille and were standing in formation and I can’t remember if somebody said, ‘Look up!’ or ‘Look at that!’ or something to that effect. Anyway, my attention was drawn overhead. Being late fall, we were still in a night sky. The sun didn’t come up until much later – almost an hour later. So, we were looking at all the stars and we saw one that we thought was a star and it was an odd color and we were just staring at it. I don’t know whether it blinked on and was coming down? Or it blinked on the size that it was and then grew in size and diameter? It’s getting bigger and bigger and bigger! It’s getting to be the size of a dinner plate. And it kept growing and growing and growing. And the 1st Lieutenant Officer of the Day who takes roll call and everybody out there was looking up."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"This thing kept getting bigger until it got to the point it was as big, or even bigger, than the size of the quadrangle, which was as big as a square city block! It was huge!! You’ve got a building on each side, which are three stories tall that run the length of each side of the quadrangle. Then on the inside, there’s a company street that goes all the way around every one of the buildings. In the middle of that is a huge parade ground. And this thing grew to the point that it literally covered every side of that quadrangle. AT THAT POINT, HOW HIGH ABOVE YOU DO YOU THINK IT WAS AND WHAT KIND OF DETAIL COULD YOU SEE? From where we were standing, which was literally underneath this puppy, you could not see any distinguishing marks at all. It was just one solid light. There were no structural evidences of any kind. It was just a big oval body with the entire bottom portion lit up. But it did not cast a light out onto the ground. WHAT COLOR WAS IT? Lime green. L ime green, the color of the huge, glow ing, oval-shaped aerial craft as big as a city block that hovered silently over the Schofield Barracks quadrangle in the fall of 1963. No illustration. WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT THE HUGE GREEN CRAFT WAS NOT CASTING ANY GREEN LIGHT ON THE GROUND? Right, but it was evident in the sky. Very pronounced. The light was defined by a very sharp edge around it. Lime Green Oval Hovers Close to Barracks Rooftops Now, this thing stopped and I remember raising my hand and putting two fingers together and putting them up to compare to the bottom of whatever it was and kind of gauging where it was in relationship to the top of a building. I held my arm straight out and it was two fingers distance between the top of the building and the bottom of whatever it was. I’m guessing it was about 200 feet or so above the building. Here’s the interesting part. There was no sound at all – just nothing! I looked at all the edges of it and at the rear portion of this vehicle, the air was boiling. Do you understand what I mean? IT WAS AS IF THE AIR WAS ROILING AND YOU COULD SEE IT? Yes, because the stars behind it would waver. You could see the star field behind it and up above it and you could see the air ‘boiling’ and the disfiguring of the stars in the sky – they would wobble from the air ‘boiling.’ I will never forget that thing as long as I live! Unusual Silence and Mind Control Among Army Eyewitnesses WHAT WERE THE MEN AROUND YOU SAYING AND DOING? Nobody said a word. My entire platoon, I had them at attention, but nobody was saying a word. And I looked across the field at the Officer of the Day and he was standing there looking up. Now, just prior to his looking up, he stood there and barked out an order, ‘Battalion, attention!’ That’s the last thing he said. He never took roll call or anything. He just stood there looking up. And this thing sat in the sky for maybe 30 seconds at least. And then it tilted, like the back of it where the air was blurry, it kind of tilted maybe 2 or 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"degrees down. Then in two seconds, it shot off and out of sight. HOW MANY MEN DO YOU THINK SAW THIS TOTAL? I would say approximately 180. And one more thing after this occurred, the Lt. said – these are his exact words because I’ll never forget them. He did not dismiss the battalion. He did not bring anybody to parade rest. He just said, ‘Go eat.’ That’s all he said! He turned around and walked off the parade field. Then I had my men do an about face and dismissed them. Every man went right back to the barracks and sat down on his bunk and this really got me. I walked upstairs to tell them to go eat and every man was sitting on his bed facing the same direction. Every one of them! Nobody was talking. LIKE SOME KIND OF MIND CONTROL? I have no idea how you would define it, but it was just spooky to me. Now, here’s another part. We ate breakfast and came back and everybody sat down on their bunks and nobody said a word about it, not one word – even myself. Nobody ever raised the subject of what we saw. That was the weird part of it because I couldn’t figure that out. It just seemed strange that when I walked upstairs that everyone was looking out the same window in the barracks. They were all facing the same direction on their bunks. Every man was sitting there and everyone was quiet. Nobody was talking. WHEN YOU ARRIVED AND SPOKE TO THEM, DID ANYONE RESPOND? No, they just got up and went down to the mess hall. I had said, ‘Go eat,’ and they just all got up and walked down to the mess hall and ate breakfast. TOTALLY SILENT. Yes, that really got to me. IF THIS OCCURRED AND AFFECTED 180 MEN, DID ANYONE IN HIGHER AUTHORITY EVER COME TO YOU ALL AND SAY, ‘YOU DIDN’T SEE ANYTHING.’? WAS THERE ANY BRIEFING OF ANY OF YOU? Oh, no. Nobody did anything. No words were spoken about it the entire time I was there. SO, YOU WERE NEVER GIVEN A NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT TO SIGN? No, not even a request from the 1st Sergeant or Company Commander or even that Lieutenant. AFTER THAT DAY, DID ANY OF THOSE MEN EVER SEEM TO COME OUT OF THEIR AMNESIA AND ASK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED? Not a one. I was there from that October/November 1963 until the following February 1964, when I was discharged at Travis AFB in California, and nobody ever said a word. No Debriefings DID YOU EVER GO TO ANY SUPERIOR OFFICER AND ASK WHAT HAPPENED? That’s the strange thing – nobody did anything! I didn’t even have the presence of thought to go down and ask the guard, ‘We saw something last night – can I tell you about it?’ None of that, myself included. ANY AERIAL OBJECT THAT WOULD COVER FOUR BUILDINGS OVER THE SIZE OF A SQUARE CITY BLOCK ... At least a square city block, if not bigger. ...YOU WOULD THINK THAT EVERYBODY WOULD BE SCREAMING, ‘WHAT IS THAT?’ Yes, and every building was three stories tall. It was a big complex and there were three different brigades set up that way at the time. CHARLIE, DID YOU EVER THINK ABOUT YOURSELF, THAT IT WAS STRANGE BEHAVIOR THAT YOU DIDN’T GO TO SUPERIORS OR TO ANYBODY AND SAY, ‘THIS IS WHAT WE SAW. WHAT WAS IT?’"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Not until I got out of the military. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THAT LIME GREEN COLOR SINCE THE 1963 EVENT IN HAWAII? Ye s . WHAT HAPPENED? All I can tell you is that I remember seeing the light twice out here in Colorado, up by what they call the Pawnee National Grassland where. I was up there once about 2:30 AM in the morning to wait and watch for coyotes and a light was up at the cloud cover level and kept disappearing into the clouds. Another time, I was in Farmington, New Mexico, working in the oil field down there. And I saw one down there. Same lime green color. It just sat there and made me real nervous. I went back to my truck and drove off. Missing Time? DO YOU THINK IN HAWAII THERE WAS MISSING TIME FOR ALL OF YOU? That would be a pretty big event because you’re talking more than 100 men. I’ve got to be truthful with you. When I was standing there and that thing was down as low as it got, I was thinking, ‘Why don’t you come down?’ WHAT IF THERE WAS MISSING TIME? WHAT IF ALL OF YOU, INCLUDING YOUR LEADER FOR THE DAY, WHAT IF YOU WERE ALL ABDUCTED AND THEN RETURNED UNAWARE OF MISSING TIME? I have no idea because I don’t remember anything like that.\" I f anyone who was at Schofield Barracks on Oahu, Hawaii, in the fall of 1963 has further information about the appearance of the lime green, glowing oval, please contact me on or off the record at earthfiles@earthfiles.com.
