Aerial © 2003 by San Francisco Chronicle (Paul Chinn, Photographer). December 5, 2003 Grass Lake, Michigan - The San Francisco Chronicle published a story yesterday about a crop formation that was discovered on June 28, 2003, in a wheat field near Fairfield, California in Solano County. There were fifteen circles in a pictogram pattern, the largest was 140 feet in diameter. A ball of light in the field was reported by two different witnesses from two different locations. Thousands of people traveled to the wheat field and national news carried aerial photographs of the crop circles. Then four teenagers claimed they put the wheat down, but the District Attorney did not believe their story. And now the current news report is that local investigators have concluded the pattern of circles was too sophisticated for any teenagers to have created it. The Chronicle quoted former NASA engineer and physicist, Jean-Noel Auburn as saying, \"The level of sophistication was quite high and I don't think high school students could have done it - especially considering the state of education these days.\" The Chronicle also reported that, \"After analyzing the different-sized circles in the pattern, Aubrun found that the ratio in the size between each was the same as the difference in frequency between each note on a musical scale (known as diatonic ratios). ... Not only that, but investigators say there was not enough moonlight that night of June 27th to make such an intricate design. For months, (a local investigator named Steve) Moreno has invited the boys to recreate the pattern on a similarly moonlit night. The teenagers have balked.\" Further, biophysicist W. C. Levengood in Michigan recently concluded his own investigation of wheat and soil sent to him from the largest circle and a couple of the smallest circles. He agrees that no teenagers hoaxed what he found in the plants he analyzed. Levengood studied biophysics at the University of Michigan in the late 1960s and holds several patents on his inventions to increase seed growth and vigor. He has studied biochemical and biophysical changes in crop formation seeds and plants for over a decade. He thinks what is creating the truly mysterious crop patterns is a complex energy system that he describes as a \"spinning plasma vortex\" of ions with microwave frequencies that rapidly heat water in plants, causing them to collapse to the ground with stems not cracked or broken. Further, the microwave frequencies can heat up water in the plant's growth nodes which burst out, creating small holes that have often been found in extraordinary crop patterns. Those complex energies can also affect the seeds. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"For his investigation of the Solano County, California crop formation plants, he did what's called a \"Vigor Factor Test\" of the seed growth in the formation plants and compared them to a vigor test on normal plants collected from outside the formation. He has found accelerated growth in crop formation seeds before, but nothing like the amount in the Solano County, California wheat seeds. Fairfield, Solano County, California, wheat field reported on June 28, 2003. Largest circle was 140 feet in diameter.Aerial © 2003 by San Francisco Chronicle (Paul Chinn, Photographer). Interview: W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist, Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory, Grass Lake, Michigan (photomicrographs of this research will be added to this report as soon as available as an update): \"On three of them, I got a vigor factor which was over 50% increase one of them was 59% over the control. This was practically unheard of. I can't remember if you get in the case of wheat, it grows very uniformly. If you get a vigor factor that is over 15%, generally it turns out that is statistically significant. So, here we have three that had vigor factors over 50%. YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING AT PLANTS FROM CROP FORMATIONS GATHERED AROUND THE WORLD FOR 13 YEARS WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS IN YOUR MIND FOR THE SEEDS FROM THE SOLANO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA FORMATION THAT TEENAGERS TRIED TO CLAIM THEY HAD MADE? Oh, that's ridiculous! There's no way they could produce this. In fact, there's no way anyone could produce these changes. Kids wouldn't be able to do this under any circumstance. So that, and the fact that the vigor factor was so high in the formation plants tells me another thing. You see, in these things that influence the plants from the crop formation, there are I think in the last paper we published in the journal, Physiologia Plantarum I listed 7 factors that can influence these ion plasmas that strike the crop and make these formations. There were 2 primary factors. One was the ion plasma factor; the second that has great influence on the seeds is microwave energy. But the microwave energy does just the opposite of the growth enhancement from the ion electron avalanche component of these energies. So, this is very complex. These are interactive energies and there is no way whatsoever that this growth increase could be hoaxed. If you look at the increase in the development factor that I mentioned and you look at where she took these samples, the three that show this tremendous increase in growth are in three of the smallest circles. The biggest circle had the lowest development factor. That was still plus-12%, but that's quite a ways from 59%. There were two at 59% - of the three that were over 50%. What that says is that it's very consistent with what I've seen in many, many other crop formations. They are pretty much ignored by many"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"samplers because they think, 'It's a big circle. That must be the big energy.' But it's just the opposite. THE HIGHEST RATE OF GROWTH, ACCELERATED GROWTH IN THE SEEDS, IS IN THE SMALL CIRCLES WHERE MORE ENERGY HAS BEEN FOCUSED THAN IN THE LARGE CIRCLE? Yes. Right. In fact, the largest circle has the lowest increase in development, but it's still plus. THAT SEEMS COUNTER-INTUITIVE. CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY THE SMALL GRAPE SHOT CIRCLES SHOULD HAVE GREATER ENHANCEMENT OF SEED DEVELOPMENT THAN THE LARGE CIRCLE? Yes, sure. As these plasma vortices approach the earth, all plasmas in fact I showed this in a paper I had in (the journal) Nature back in 1958 a plasma vortex will actually put off or generate offspring. In other words, as the turbulence increases in this huge donut of energy, it will shoot off smaller vortices and because they are smaller due to the Conservation of Angular Momentum, they rotate faster and when they are pinched by the Earth's magnetic field, the energy density increases to a much greater extent than on the large vortices. AND THE ENERGY THAT SWIRLS AROUND IN THE VERY LARGE CIRCLE IS LESS PER SQUARE INCH, SO TO SPEAK? Yes, exactly.\" More Information: Soil Analysis W. C. Levengood: \" In addition to the plant material that was submitted, soil from the Solano County formation was all tested and there were no magnetic particles in the soil. In the formations I've looked at and that's well over 100 to 150 formations for me so far about 70% to 75% of the crop formation soils have the magnetic material. Approximately 25% do not. The magnetite level can be high outside the pattern, or inside the pattern, or not high at all. I think what happens as these plasma vortices form in the ionosphere, if we happen to be in a period of high meteorite activity, there will be a very close association between the vortex energy and the cloud of micrometeorites and their iron dust. The reason the micrometeorite dust is found associated with these plasma energies in the crop formations is because of their mutual attraction of their magnetic fields. In other words, when you have microwave energy, you have electric fields and you also have magnetic fields. So, if they are oriented right and they are in the immediate vicinity of one another, they will attract one another. So, the vortex literally picks up these magnetic particles from the cloud of meteoritic material and brings it down with it into the crops, sort of a 'space pollution by-product,' you might say.\" Credits"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe .
