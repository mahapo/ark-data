On December 11, 2007, this new high-latitude active solar region was magnetically reversed from sunspot magnetic directions in the previous Solar Cycle 23. So, this new sunspot officially marks the beginning of Solar Cycle 24. Images courtesy SOHO/NASA/ESA. January 10, 2008 Huntsville, Alabama - One month ago on December 11, 2007, a patch of magnetism on the sun was declared by NASA to be the first official sunspot of the new Solar Cycle 24. The spot was in a high-latitude on the sun with reversed polarity from the previous Solar Cycle 23 that has been in minimum for a long time. The sun has had a blank face without any sunspots for days and weeks at a time. But from now forward to 2012, sunspots should start appearing again all over the sun, leading up to what NASA astrophysicist, David Hathaway, Ph.D., thinks will be one of the more intense solar maximums on record. Dr. Hathaway is the Solar Physics Team Leader at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. He received his Ph.D. in astrophysics from the University of Colorado in Boulder in 1979. Dr. Hathaway is now one of the top solar astrophysicists in the world. He was surprised last week in the beginning of January 2008, to learn that his own solar physics research was being used by a non - scientist named John Casey in an Orlando, Florida company calling itself “Space and Science Research Center.” SSRC recently distributed an alarming press release on the internet entitled “Changes in the Sun’s Surface to Bring Next Climate Change.” The press release warned there will be a global food shortage in the next Solar Cycle 25 (approximately 2018 - 2029). This week I talked with Dr. Hathaway about the press release and his own perceptions about what’s expected in this current Solar Cycle 24 and beyond. Interview: "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"D avid Hathaway, Ph.D., NASA Astrophysicist. David Hathaway, Ph.D., Solar Physics Team Leader, NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama: “In the beginning of the cycle, it’s a little like popping popcorn where first one spot will come out and then you wait. Then there is another - bam, bam, bam! And off it goes, the cycle is on its way. We’re expecting this cycle will start rising in the next few months and should reach its maximum in about 2011 to 2012 time frame. Of course, the solar maximum is an extended period – one to two years at least where the sun is particularly active, compared to where we are now. We’ve gone for days and weeks at a time without any sunspots at all. L eft: not a single sunspot on December 30, 2007. Right: Active sunspots in previous Cycle 23. Images credit: SOHO/MDI. During solar maximum, we should see lots of spots on the sun. Even the low predictions for this Cycle 24 indicate that at maximum there ought to be on any given day at least 70 or 80 spots on the sun. THE LAST TIME WE TALKED, THERE WAS DISPUTE ABOUT WHETHER THIS WAS GOING TO BE A REALLY INTENSE “X-CLASS” SOLAR FLARE MAXIMUM IN THE 2011, 2012, 2013 TIME PERIOD? OR WILL IT BE REALLY MILD? IS THE SCIENTIFIC EXPECTATION ON THIS NOW ANY CLEARER? Unfortunately, no. (laughs) We continue to do research and it really comes down to two models and two different techniques for predicting the size of the next cycle, both of which agreed on the last Cycle 23, but disagree on this Cycle 24. We really have not gotten to the bottom of it yet. DO YOU STILL EXPECT IT TO BE A VERY INTENSE CYCLE 24 SOLAR MAXIMUM? I’m still sticking with it, that’s right. There are a number of indicators that suggest Solar Cycle 24 Maximum should be a big cycle, and there is a model out there that has shown to be extremely accurate in going back in time to predict the last eight cycles. That model can do it better than any of the other techniques out there and suggests that this upcoming solar maximum should be a much bigger solar cycle than average. Solar Cycle 25 - Cool Ea rth and Food Shortages?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WE WILL THEN BE ENTERING ANOTHER SOLAR MINIMUM AROUND 2017 TO 2019, RIGHT? Right, about another eleven years from now we should be back in another minimum phase of the sunspot cycle. THAT WILL BE CALLED SOLAR CYCLE 25 AND THERE HAS BEEN A PRESS RELEASE THAT HAS BEEN CIRCULATING ON THE WEB FOR THE LAST WEEK OR SO IN 2008 FROM AN ORGANIZATION CALLED “SPACE AND SCIENCE RESEARCH CENTER (SSRC) ” IN ORLANDO, FLORIDA. THE DIRECTOR IS JOHN CASEY. THEY HAVE RELEASED INFORMATION SAYING THEY EXPECT SOLAR CYCLE 25 TO BE SO LOW IN SUNSPOTS THAT IT WILL PLUNGE THE EARTH INTO A COOLING PERIOD THAT COULD JEOPARDIZE FOOD CROPS GLOBALLY. COULD YOU COMMENT ON HIS HYPOTHESIS? I find it highly doubtful. First of all, he bases his prediction for a small Cycle 25 on my own work. I’m well familiar with my own work! This was work where we had looked at the drift rate of sunspots on the sun and from that inferred flows that contribute to how the sun makes sunspot cycles. That flow was particularly slow during this last Cycle 23 – in fact, slower than any of the previous 12 cycles. We also found a correlation with the strength of that flow and the strength of the upcoming solar cycle two cycles in the future. This fits in with the same model that is predicting that this next Cycle 24 ought to be a large cycle. Given that data, we (NASA) went out on a limb and suggested that solar Cycle 25 (appx. 2018 to 2029) ought to be a much smaller than average cycle because that flow during Cycle 23 was a lot smaller than average. But there is a lot of scattering in the measurements. It’s not a perfect relationship and our uncertainty about just that one relationship and how big Cycle 25 is going to be is give or take 30%. His claim (John Casey, SSRC) is that he has evidence that corroborates our own NASA research in suggesting that Cycle 25 ought to be a small cycle. But there are other steps involved in getting from that to global cooling. Part of that is to what extent does solar variability in the sunspot cycle contribute to global warming? Our best estimates – this is an active area of research and there are other solar researchers that would claim the sun is far more important than I think – but if I look at the sunspot record and I look at the temperature record, it suggests that the sun influences the Earth’s global temperature at about the 20 to 30% level. When we look at the correlation between the sunspot cycle and Earth temperature, it’s not a really tight fit. There are other things that are far more important such as El Nino, volcanic eruptions and things like greenhouse gases that also influence – altogether much greater than solar activity. So, making the conclusion that a small Cycle 25 means we are going to go into a cool period on Earth is really pushing it. It’s taking the extremes of two or three measurements and adding them together to say this is going to be the effect. I’m highly suspicious of that result. IT SEEMS THAT THERE IS AN IRONY HERE ALSO THAT IF SOLAR CYCLE 25 DID BRING ANY COOLING, IT MIGHT BE OFFSET BY THE GLOBAL WARMING GREENHOUSE BLANKET THAT IS BUILDING UP AROUND THE EARTH? That’s certainly a possibility. If the sun does come in at 20 to 30% and it’s particularly low then, the greenhouse gas blanket might be particularly offsetting of that kind of cooling. WE MIGHT BE WORRIED ABOUT SOMETHING THAT COULD PROTECT US DURING THAT PERIOD? Protect us? I think the word to use is ‘temper’ the amount of warming we have. It might do that. But again, it’s also predicated on Cycle 25 actually being a small cycle. As far as I know, the only real indication of that is in fact the study I did on this flow on the sun and how it’s related to future activity. WOULD YOU SAY THAT YOU HAVE PERSONALLY ANY CONCERN ABOUT FUTURE SOLAR CYCLES AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE EARTH’S CLIMATE? I don’t have big concerns. Certainly, I would be more concerned about other things when it comes to climate. But nonetheless, it does behoove us to figure out what role the sun does play in all of this. I do have colleagues who have their own research and conclude that the sun has a bigger influence than 30%. They have valid arguments we need to hash"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"out and figure out to what extent does the sun contribute to global warming?” Is Sun Heating Up Solar System? Many people on the internet keep discussing rumors that our entire solar system is warming up, causing thaws on Mars and out as far as Pluto. But, Dr. Hathaway at NASA says there is no hard data that shows the sun is so much brighter and hotter that it would cause solar system-wide warming. In fact, even when the sun is at intense solar maximum with nearly 100 sunspots all over it – the sun’s brightness might increase only 1/1000th above it’s normal brightness during solar minimum.
