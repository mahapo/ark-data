Andrew Kissner Return to Part 1 White Sands and OSRD: The Atomic Bomb and V-2s O ne senses the vastness and grandeur of the Chihuahuan desert at WSPG, renamed White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) in 1956. Mountains rise dramatically from flat intermediate plains populated by yuccas, creosote bush and mesquite. The Tularosa Basin has mountain ranges generally oriented north to south. Between mountain ranges lie flat plains with \"playas,\" or beaches in Spanish because the white dry lake bed looks like a beach. In general, playas are depressions in flat plains which act as evaporation ponds for runoff draining from surrounding higher elevations. What is unique about White Sands Missile Range is the pure gypsum deposits that make the sand so white. Evaporation of water from Lake Lucero, a playa, results in the concentration of those pure gypsum crystals. When blown by the wind, the crystals create the pure white sand dune area that was established in 1933 as a National Monument. [ Source: SEAFARER ELF Communications System, Draft Environmental Impact Statement, Book 3, p. B-2.] On the west side of WSMR are the Organ and San Andres Mountains; on the east are the Sacramento Mountains; in the north are the Sierra Oscura Mountains and the 8,372- foot-high Oscura Peak overlooking the Trinity Site where the United States tested its first atomic bomb in July 1945. Sixty miles northeast near Corona is where the aerial disc came down on the Mac Brazel ranch on July 3, 1947. Later on in Majestic-12 TOP SECRET MAJIC documents leaked to Bob and Ryan Wood (www.majesticdocuments.com), three disc crash sites were indicated - two in addition to the Corona site. The MJ-12 documents called the disc crash sites \"Landing Zones,\" or LZ-1, LZ-2 and LZ-3. LZ-1 was the Corona site; LZ-2 was near the Trinity Site inside White Sands; and LZ-3 was 30 miles east of Alamogordo and Holloman AFB on the Mescalero Apache Indian Reservation. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Half of the dune area is controlled by WSMR via a cooperative agreement executed on December 23, 1963, between the Secretary of the Army, Cyrus Vance, and Stewart Udall, then Secretary of the Interior. Col. Frank Borman, Apollo 8 command pilot and former Chairman of Eastern Airlines, noted that as he orbited the moon, the white sand was the one distinguishing feature of the American southwest that could be seen from lunar orbit without magnification. [ Source: Personal discussion.] The white sand dune area is approximately 50 miles wide. Immediately north is Northrop Strip, renamed \"Space Harbor\" by an act of Congress in 1986, to be an emergency landing strip for the NASA space shuttle. The Strip is 32,000 feet long by 250 feet wide making it one of the longest runways on Earth. [ Source: SEAFARER ELF, p. B-55. ] Immediately south of the dunes is HELSTF, the High Energy Laser Systems Test Facility, home to the largest destructive laser in the world. Immediately to the east of the dune region is Holloman AFB, formerly Alamogordo Army Air Field. AAAF was renamed Holloman Air Field in the fall of 1947 after the base had been transferred to Gen. Nathan Twining's Air Material Command from the U. S. Army Air Corps. This transfer was accomplished within 30 days of the Roswell disc collection effort in early July 1947. The result is that Gen. Twining's AMC became responsible for the management of all events at Alamogordo, which included all peculiar aerial disc phenomenon. [ Source: From Sundaggers to Space Exploration , p. 308.] Holloman supports the USAF 49th Tactical Fighter Wing, the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories (AMC) and the Air Force 6585th Test Group. In 1991, Holloman AFB was designated as the primary support base for all F-117A stealth fighter-bombers. [ SEAFARER ELF , pp. 3-11.] Atomic Bomb Challenge In the fall of 1944, the OSRD - directed by Dr. Vannevar Bush (MJ-2) - identified a need to acquire real estate and establish what was described as the largest over land test center for missile research and development in North America. Primary responsibility for the activity would be vested in U. S. Army Ordnance and later with participation from the U. S. Navy, Office of Naval Research and Navy Research Laboratory. Three possible locations were studied for the national missile test range, among them the Tularosa Basin north of Ft. Bliss, Texas. [ Source: Ibid., pp. 2-8.] Another OSRD finding should be mentioned here. On December 7, 1942, - exactly one year after the Japanese surprise attack on the U. S. Pacific fleet in Pearl Harbor - Secretary of War Stimpson supported the recommendation of Dr. Bush and OSRD to see if the Los Alamos School for Boys could accommodate a special War Department project. The property was purchased and Dr. Bush signed a letter of intent with the University of California to allow the university system to begin hiring employees for the Manhattan Engineering District's (MED's) Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL) - Project Y. ["},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Sandia National Laboratories , p. 18.] The core area of WSPG consisted of 1,367,080 acres. That land was declared a military necessity and was acquired by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers through its real estate directive dated February 8, 1945. The condemnation by the War Department consolidated federal, State of New Mexico, and privately owned land into one homogeneous block that extended for 100 miles north and south. The land included the Joranado Experimental Range and ABRES Tract IV safety area that was more than 80 miles wide. It is probable that fewer than 200 people were displaced when the Army secured their 1.3 million acre property in 1945. Immediately access to the airspace above WSPG was restricted to only the cleared military flights with primary responsibility for enforcing air security vested in the Army Air Forces at Alamogordo Army Air Field on the easternmost boundary of WSPG. [ Source: SEAFARER ELF , Book 3, pp. 2-10.] In June 1945, construction began in the main post area and Lt. Col. Harold turner of U. S. Army Ordnance assumed command. Following construction of barracks and a mess hall, the first troops arrived in August 1945. The first missile, a Tiny Tim sounding rocket, was launched in September 1945. \"Fat Man\" Atomic Bomb - First Test At WSPG Trinity Site WSPG's first OSRD experiment did not involve a rocket or a missile. It was atomic bomb, Fat Man, and that first detonation was at the Trinity Site on July 16, 1945, under the authority of Project Y. Trinity Site is located on the northern end of the 3,200-square-mile White Sands Missile Range between the towns of Carrizozo and Socorro, New Mexico. The Trinity Site is now another National Monument and is open to the public two days per year. The V-2 Launch Complex 33 is also a National Historic Monument, but is not open to the public.

The Seattle Times : \"The heat was so intense that it vaporized the tower holding the bomb and melted the sand underneath into a green glass dubbed Trinitite. A mile away, exposed surfaces were heated to 750 degrees. At 10 miles, the heat still felt like the open mouth of a fireplace, witnesses reported.

Robert Oppenheimer, Ph.D., with Maj. General Leslie Richard Groves. The physicist and military leader were in charge of the TOP SECRET Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico, which detonated the first atomic bomb on July 16, 1945. The two men were photographed checking the remains of a ground zero tower after that first atomic test at the Trinity Site in White Sands Proving Ground. [ Editor's Note: In September 1942, Temporary Brigadier General Leslie Groves was placed in charge of the Manhattan Engineering District Project, established a month earlier. The Manhattan Project was the cover name for developing the atomic bomb under his direction. The scientific research was largely conducted at Columbia University in New York City (Manhattan) and the University of Chicago. Project plants were established at the Clinton Laboratory at Oak Ridge, Tennessee; the Hanford Engineer Works near Pasco, Washington; and the secluded Los Alamos installation in New Mexico. The work culminated in the first successful explosion of a nuclear-fission bomb at the Trinity Site at the north end of White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico on July 16, 1945. In December 1944, Groves was promoted to Major General and continued to head the atomic agency until January 1947. He was then named the Chief of the Army's Special Weapons Project. He retired in February 1948 as a Lt. General. From that time until 1961, General Groves worked as Vice President of Sperry Rand Corporation.] R ed arrow marks Trinity Site at northern end of White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, on Astronaut Image ISS008-E-5604 from NASA-Johnson Space Center taken on December 29, 2003. Why U. S. Navy So Involved in White Sands The logic of an overland test range for missiles is related to the stability and precision of test and diagnostic instrumentation that can be permanently fixed in surveyed locations. When instrumentation platforms are placed in water, there is continuous movement and questions arise as to distance and exact location of recorders and other diagnostic equipment at the time of a test. This is particularly important when the observations are related to moving objects traveling at speeds twice as fast as a bullet. In the rocket business, a bullet is extremely slow! [ Source: Confidential interview and SEAFARER ELF, Appendix G, B-17.] Testing missiles over land also enables researchers to recover test vehicles after they are flown. Malfunctioning components can be recovered and analyzed as opposed to attempting recovery in water. These two rationales are why the U. S. Navy was an integral part of WSPG operations after June 14, 1946. In the 1950s, the Navy built its own concrete ship in the desert known as USS Desert Ship (LL1). The U. S. Navy Commander at WSPG is the Captain of LL1. R. B. McLaughlin served as the first Navy commander. Ernst Krause, a Ph.D. in nuclear physics from the University of Wisconsin, headed the Naval Research Laboratory's guided missile research and development unit at WSPG in 1946 and 1947. James Van Allen, Ph.D., had discovered the Van Allen Radiation Belt while working for the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) of Johns Hopkins University at WSPG. Dr. Van Allen was an NRL contractor and nuclear physicist who completed his post-doctorate training at the Carnegie Institution's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism (DTM). Also, Dr. Vannevar Bush (MJ-2) was President of the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D. C. and was a former DTM faculty member. Further, Lloyd Veil Berkner (MJ-12) was Dr. bush's Executive Director at OSRD after 1946 and a DTM staff member. Berkner was also founder of JRDB's Upper Atmosphere Rocket Research Panel.

[ Source: The Nuclear Oracles © 1987 Richard T. Sylves, Iowa State University Press.] Tracking and Photographing V-2s and Discs The first matter of business at the new White Sands Proving Ground was to design, fabricate, acquire and field an array of test instrumentation that would be capable of tracking and recording missiles during tests. Cinetheodolites and radar were designed and fabricated by Marcus O'Day of General Nathan Twining's (MJ-4) Army Air Forces Air Material Command (AMC). Those instruments were used to track rockets in their boost, mid-course and terminal phases from \"Launch Row\" which extended in an easterly direction from the main post. There were defined missile impact areas \"up range\" to the north. High speed cameras capable of exposing 180 frames per second were installed at WSPG launch complexes, along with other high speed cameras up range. Optical telescopes were designed, fabricated and operated by astronomer Clyde Tombaugh. He had discovered the planet Pluto while working at the Lowell Naval Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. His installed instruments at WSPG were capable of resolving V-2 rockets in flight at 160 kilometers (99 miles). One of WSPG contributions to early technology innovation was the development of super high speed cameras perfected in collaboration with university researchers. Ironically, astronomer Clyde Tombaugh was the only member of that pioneering scientific team to publicly report sightings of flying discs above WSPG and was publicly ridiculed for his observations.
