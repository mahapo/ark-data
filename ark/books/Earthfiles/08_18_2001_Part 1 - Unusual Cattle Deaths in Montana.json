Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Part 1 - Unusual Cattle Deaths in Montana © 2001 by Linda Moulton Howe August 18, 2001 Conrad, Montana - Twenty-six years ago in the summer of 1975, there were so many cattle mutilations in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico and other parts of the United States and Canada that sheriffs reported some carcasses were still warm to touch with bloodless, \"cookie cutter\" cuts and no tracks or other evidence. The mutilations had first made national news in the fall of 1974 and continued without letup in many parts of North America and other countries such as Australia, South America, Central America, Mexico, the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa and parts of Europe. Colorado Grazing Association cow discovered with strange, bloodless excisions on July 26, 1977. This scene of a deputy sheriff examining the odd mutilation cuts has repeated over the past decades in Montana and many other states, provinces and countries.

Photograph by the Logan County, Colorado Sheriff's Office, Sterling, Colorado. In Montana, one county seemed besieged by the phenomenon in 1975-1976 and that was Cascade County around Great Falls. My brother, Jim Moulton, was there at the time after his tour of duty in the Vietnam war working as a helicopter pilot at Malmstrom AFB, an American military installation surrounded by Minuteman nuclear missiles. He and some of his other military colleagues were also assigned to help the Cascade County Sheriff's Office investigate many unusual deaths and mutilations of cattle, often associated with unusual aerial craft or lights in the sky. There were several incidents in which large, glowing, red-orange discs hovered right over Minuteman nuclear missile silos and caused great alarm. One day a rancher brought a mutilated cow to the base. A flight surgeon examined it and told my brother that the excisions of hide were precise and surgical. He also said that the cow had been so thoroughly drained of blood that the muscle tissue was a pale pink-white. \"It's happened all over again,\" Jan Elings of Browning, Montana told me this week. On Wednesday morning, August 15th at 7:30 a.m., Jan found one of their yearling heifers dead and mutilated, similar to another young cow she and her husband, Larry, found on their first ranch in Fort Shaw near Great Falls back in the late 1970s. Jan and Larry knew for certain that this August 2001 yearling was alive and well on Monday evening with the rest of the 400 cows, yearlings and one bull in the pasture.

WHAT EXACTLY HAD BEEN REMOVED? The tongue and then it went up the right side of the jaw bone. The jaw bone was completely I mean, there isn't any meat left on it whatsoever. And then up towards the back of the ears and the neck and the nose. It looked like it made a perfect triangle. And it's like they opened up the mouth and cut the tongue off. DID THEY CUT THE TONGUE DOWN INTO THE THROAT ? No, about 10 inches, I would say. Some would still be there. BUT MOST OF THE TONGUE HAD BEEN REMOVED? Ye s . A VERTICAL CUT, FROM THE TOP OF THE ROOF OF THE MOUTH DOWN TO THE BOTTOM? Yeah. As fresh as I found her, the flies were just setting in. There wasn't any bird crap on her at all. Nothing. WHAT ABOUT THE GENITALS AND RECTUM? One teat was removed. And part of the rectum was cut out also. WAS THE TEAT CUT OFF FLAT FLUSH WITH THE SURFACE OF THE UDDER? Ye a h . IT DIDN'T BURROW INTO THE UDDER? No. WHERE THE TEAT WAS CUT OFF, WAS THERE ANY BLOOD OR FLUID? No, and that was another thing the cutting on the face. There was no blood whatsoever. NOT ON ANY OF THESE EXCISIONS?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"No. WERE THE EARS INTACT? Ye s . THE EYES WERE BOTH THERE? Ye s . WAS THE YEARLING LYING ON GRASS OR WAS IT POWDERY DIRT? Well, it's supposed to be grass, but with the drought here, it's getting powdery. We can see tracks very easily. COULD YOU SEE ANYTHING UNUSUAL? Nothing. The first thing the area we live in, Linda, the first thing you look for are predators. Because we have it all up here. And that's the first thing when I seen her dead was to look for signs of coyotes. You know how coyotes chew on them. And I looked for tracks. And nothing. DID THE YEARLING LIE THERE WITHOUT ANY LARGE PREDATORS TOUCHING IT FOR A DAY OR TWO? Well, like I said, nothing was there on Monday, so she had to have been killed on Tuesday morning, maybe, judging by the flies and what not. YOU FOUND HER WEDNESDAY MORNING, EARLY? Right. NOTHING HAD TORN HER APART? No, there was no predators whatsoever. And even now, the coyotes still have not touched her. THIS IS FRIDAY. And I still haven't seen birds on her, either. Larry and I had a calf mutilated in the late 1970s when we lived in Fort Shaw. We found that while it was still very fresh and rigor mortis had not set in yet. We found that calf in the morning. WAS IT WARM TO TOUCH? Yes, it was, which a lot of people don't believe it. Back then, you didn't dare say much. HOW DID THE EXCISIONS IN THE 1970S COMPARE TO THIS ONE IN AUGUST OF 2001? On the calf (1970s), the only thing they took was an ear and down the neck and back up. That's the only thing they took on the calf. THE JAW FLESH THAT WAS REMOVED ON THE YOUNG COW IN THE 1970S, WAS IT VERY SIMILAR TO THIS ONE NOW? No, they didn't cut the calf's jaw. They just cut the calf's ear and down the neck and the shoulder and back up. They didn't touch the jaw. THAT REMOVAL OF FLESH BACK IN THE 1970S, WAS IT HIDE-DEEP ONLY? Yes, it was. EXPOSING ONLY THE MUSCLE? Yes, pretty much the hide."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CLEARLY CUT? Oh, yes. My dad did taxidermy work and he come up there and said, 'Something had to have done this.' He skinned the calf out thinking there had to be a puncture hole or something on the calf and he couldn't find anything. And again, no blood whatsoever. THAT'S ALWAYS A PUZZLING PART BECAUSE IT ALMOST IMPLIES THAT WHATEVER HAS HAPPENED HAS BEEN DONE SOMEPLACE ELSE AND THEN THE ANIMAL IS RETURNED. Yes. I really believe in that theory. With facial cuts like that, there should be a huge amount of bleeding. AND NOTHING. Nothing. NOT EVEN THE SIGNS THERE HAD BEEN FLUID ALONG THE CUTS? No. IT SUGGESTS SOME TYPE OF CAUTERY AND WE HAVE FOUND SOME EVIDENCE OF THAT IN SOME OF THE CASES, BUT WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHO, WHAT OR WHY? It almost has to be laser as even as the hide looks. OR SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED CUTTING WITH SOME KIND OF SOUND. That could be. BUT IT IS EVEN AND REGULAR. It is so clean that you know that knife didn't do it by looking. DID YOU HAVE A VETERINARIAN COME OUT ON THIS YEARLING? No, we didn't. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ANIMAL? She is still laying there. STILL NO PREDATOR? No, and that's very rare for this area. BECAUSE YOU HAVE COYOTES AND BEAR AND WHAT ALL ELSE? Lions, wolves. And I've seen kills by all. THEY ARE VERY BLOODY USUALLY, TOO. Yes, very definitely. And with the coyotes, they always start at the entrails. Bear usually starts at the shoulder. And lion. I found a fresh deer kill by a lion, and you can still see where the jugular was cut, that kind of thing. WITH NATURAL PREDATORS SUCH AS COYOTES AND COUGARS, THERE ARE CLAW OR TEETH PUNCTURE MARKS. Ye s . ON THIS YEARLING, DID YOU FIND ANYTHING THAT EVEN RESEMBLED TEETH OR CLAW MARKS? No."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"HAVE YOU TALKED WITH ANYONE AROUND YOU ABOUT WHETHER THEY HAVE SEEN ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN THE SKY? No, I haven't talked with anyone yet. IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW. Especially where this yearling is, too. It's not that far off from the highway. That's why she was so noticeable. YET THERE REALLY WEREN'T ANY SIGNS OF STRUGGLE OR TRACKS WHERE SHE WAS FOUND? No, and totally dust where she was. WHICH EMPHASIZES THE FACT THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLEAR PRINTS IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN AROUND THIS YEARLING? Yes, and that's the first thing you look for is tracks. IT'S ALMOST AS IF SHE WAS LAID DOWN THERE? Yes. There was no sign of struggle. Nothing! She was just laying there. NOT EVEN SIGNS OF HER OWN TRACKS LEADING UP TO WHERE SHE WAS LAYING? No. And even now, when you go out there, any time you take a vehicle, it really leaves a definite trail. Where I drove there yesterday, you can see it plain today. THAT'S WHAT OVER THE YEARS HAS LEAD LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT I HAVE TALKED TO SAY, 'WHATEVER IS DOING THIS, THEY'VE GOT TO BE TAKING THE ANIMAL BY AIR AND RETURNING THEM FROM THE AIR.' And why do they take one out of 400. How do they pick? WHY THAT YEARLING? Yeah. Why not a cow? Or even a calf again? Why do, how do they choose what they want?\" Continued in Part 2.
