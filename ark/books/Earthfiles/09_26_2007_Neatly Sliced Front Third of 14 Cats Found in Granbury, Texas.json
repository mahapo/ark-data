In other words, just behind the hind legs, a clean cut and they are just severed. They don’t find the other 2/3s of the cat.” - B radley Davis, Granbury, Texas, Resident G ranbury in lower left corner is 32 miles southwest of Fort Worth, Texas. The other red circles in Denton and Plano are sites where half cats and missing cats have been reported in the past. September 26, 2007 Granbury, Texas - It was only three weeks ago that I was reporting about half cat mutilations in Destin, Florida, and Alberta and Ontario Canada. [ See 090407 Earthfiles .] And since April of 2007, there have been other half cat mutilation reports in Waco and Corpus Christi, Texas. [ See 040907 Earthfiles. ] This cat mutilation mystery which has been reported over at least four decades in the United States, Canada, England and Australia. In addition to all the cats found bloodlessly cut in half since at least the 1980s, some other cats have been cut into thirds in which usually the front third is left to be found. Back in August 2003, Bothel, Washington, veterinarian, Cherie Good, D.V.M., photographed and x-rayed the remainder of a dead and mutilated cat found in a Bothel yard northeast of Seattle. The cat had been neatly and bloodlessly severed into three parts. In that case, it was the middle part that had been taken, leaving the front third of the cat cut off right behind its front legs and the back third cut in front of its back legs. A bove , first mutilated male cat found first week of August 2003, Bothel, Washington. Veterinarian Cherie Good laid cat out to show it had been severed in three parts and middle section was gone. Below is an x-ray of the same cat showing the dark space in the back half that indicates all internal organs were removed. Photograph and x-ray © 2003 by Cherie Good, D.V.M. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Now four years later between March and September 2007, in Granbury, Texas, only the front third of fourteen house cats have been found. This time, the mutilator left the front third of several cats on the golf course of the DeCordova Bend Estates, a gated retirement community southwest of Fort Worth. The groundskeeper found the first mutilated cat on March 9, 2007, and simply threw it on a garbage burn pile and never reported it. After three more front thirds of cats were found on the golf course, the groundskeeper finally reported the strange, bloodless deaths to the Security Chief. He eventually contacted the Hood County Sheriff’s Department who began to take notice after seven front thirds of cats had been reported and after DeCordova Bend Estates residents expressed alarm that Something was getting their cats inside the gated community. The fourteenth front third of a cat was found in the week of September 17th to 23rd, and a $4,600 reward is now being offered for information about the perpetrators that could lead to arrest and conviction. This week I talked with DeCordova Estates resident, Bradley Davis, who has a college teaching background. Interviews: Bradley Davis, Resident, DeCordova Bend Estates, Granbury, Texas: “I can give you a general overview of what has happened to these cats. Generally, the cats have been severed into one-thirds – the top one-third isleft. That’s all they are finding. In other words, just behind the hind legs, a clean cut and they are just severed. They don’t find the other 2/3s of the cat. The other thing - they have found next to two cats the cat collars. WERE THOSE COLLARS CUT IN TWO? OR UNBUCKLED? They were unbuckled and intact. THEY WERE FOUND HOW FAR FROM THE CATS? Right next to the cats. ANY FLUID OR BLOOD AROUND EXCISIONS? The Security Chief's analysis is that it is not predator or prey. His analysis is this is human. THAT SOMEBODY IS DOING THIS MECHANICALLY? Yes. And it wasn’t until the (DeCordova) September newsletter came out that anyone even mentioned we have a cat mutilation problem. SO IT HAD BEEN GOING ON FROM MARCH TO SEPTEMBER BEFORE ANYONE WAS OFFICIALLY NOTIFIED? Right. Law Enforcement Giving Mixed Messages: Coyotes Versus Surgical Precision HAVE YOU TALKED TO ANYONE AT THE HOOD COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE? Yes, approximately 2 weeks ago. The Sheriff said he was investigating, no conclusions. I did hear something about a week ago that the head Sheriff and an investigator in Austin are claiming it’s a predator/prey situation. WHICH CONTRADICTS WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT TOLD ELIZABETH MURPHY. Yes, exactly. You’ve got to understand where we are. We’re in the middle of rural Texas"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"here. SO IT’S POLITICAL AND THEY WOULD RATHER IT BE COYOTES THAN HUMANS THEY WOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH? Oh, absolutely! I called out County Agricultural Extension Officer and talked with him on the phone two days ago. He was very skeptical that these cat mutilations are natural predators!” O ne of Brad Davis's neighbors is the Elizabeth and William Murphy family. There are four children, including one teenage boy. The Murphys were dismayed when other residents pointed at their son and said he, or other teenagers, must be guilty of killing and mutilating the cats. The Murphys have also had their own cat disappear. Others in the De Cordova Estates cannot find their cats either. Missing cats have long been part of the \"half cat\" mutilation phenomenon. Elizabeth is very upset that her son would come under suspicion. She contacted the Hood County Sheriff's Office for more information and has been given contradictory explanations. Elizabeth Murphy, married to William Murphy, parents of four children and residents of De Cordova Bend Estates for 12 years, Granbury, Texas: “The Sheriff’s department keeps telling me it’s coyotes and they don’t see any evidence of human involvement, except she (officer) did admit that the cats are perfectly sliced. And she said, ‘We don’t know how coyotes make their kill.’ I said, ‘Well, they don’t have one single blade in their head. But she did admit to me that some of them had a straight through cut. AND THIS IS THE SHERIFF’S OFFICE. Right. And she’s telling me b ecause I’m calling here and saying, ‘You all need to find the cat killer quick.” This is a closed community. We’re not that big. Somebody should have been able to see a coyote if it was a coyote! People are retired here and have leisure time. We should have been able to figure this out by now. IF IT IS A GATED COMMUNITY, IS THAT WHAT PROVOKED PEOPLE TO SAY THAT IT MUST BE SOMEBODY FROM INSIDE THE GATED COMMUNITY? Correct.” More Information: F or information about $4,600 reward offered in Granbury, Texas, cat mutilation investigation, contact: Hood County Sheriff's Office 817-579-3307.
