Higgs Boson: “Most Sought-after Particle in Modern Physics” Joseph Lykken, Ph.D., Particle Physicist, Fermi Laboratory, Batavia, Illinois, and Member of the CMS experiment, at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), Geneva, Switzerland: “WHAT SPECIFICALLY ARE YOU HUNTING WHEN YOU TURN THE HADRON COLLIDER ON? One of the things we are most excited about is that we think we might be able to produce in the laboratory (LHC) some of the dark matter particles that we know are out there in space and actually make up most of the mass of the universe. This is something we have learned by looking through telescopes that there are huge amounts of dark matter, way more than ordinary matter, out there in the galaxy and we don’t know what it’s made out of. We think with the LHC, we might be able to produce some dark matter and figure out what it is. [ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “In physics and cosmology, dark matter is hypothetical matter that does not interact with the electromagnetic force, but its presence can be inferred from gravitational effects on visible matter. According to present observations of structures larger than galaxies, as well as Big Bang cosmology, dark matter and dark energy account for the vast majority of the mass in the universe. The observed phenomena which imply the presence of dark matter include the rotational speeds of galaxies, orbital velocities of galaxies in clusters, gravitational lensing of background objects and the temperature distribution of hot gas in galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Dark matter also plays a central role in structure formation and galaxy evolution, and has measurable effects on the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background. All these lines of evidence suggest that galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and the universe as a whole contain far more matter than that which interacts with electromagnetic radiation. The ‘far more matter’ is what is called dark matter. “The dark matter component has vastly more mass than the visible component of the universe. At present, the density of ordinary baryons and radiation in the universe is estimated to be equivalent to about one hydrogen atom per cubic meter of space. Only about 4% of the total energy density in the universe (as inferred from gravitational effects) can be seen directly. About 22% is thought to be composed of dark matter. The remaining 74% is thought to consist of dark energy, an even stranger component, distributed diffusely in space. Some hard-to-detect baryonic matter makes a contribution to dark matter, but constitutes only a small portion. Determining the nature of this missing mass is one of the most important problems in modern cosmology and particle physics.” ] HOW DOES THAT DARK MATTER HUNT RELATE TO THE SEARCH FOR HIGGS BOSONS? Yes, we’re very interested in the hypothetical Higgs boson, which we believe is related to the force of Nature that gives other particles mass. As I was talking about gravity, this Higgs boson would also be related to a fundamental force of Nature besides gravity and"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"the other forces we know about. So, the discovery of Higgs boson particles would be the discovery of a new force of Nature and the first one we will have seen in over a century. [ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “The Higgs boson is named after Peter Ware Higgs, professor emeritus at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland. Higgs is best known for his 1960s proposal of broken symmetry in electroweak theory, explaining the origin of mass of elementary particles in general and of the W and Z bosons in particular. This so-called Higgs mechanism, which had several inventors besides Higgs, predicts the existence of a new particle, the Higgs boson often described as ‘the most sought-after particle in modern physics.’ Although this particle has not turned up in accelerator experiments so far, the Higgs mechanism is generally accepted as an important ingredient in the Standard Model of particle physics, without which particles would have no mass.”] WHAT IS THE LINK BETWEEN THE HIGGS BOSONS, GRAVITY AND BLACK HOLES? We don’t know if there is a link and that’s one of the things we want to find out. One of the questions about the Higgs boson particle is even if it exists, we don’t understand why it’s there or why the laws of physics make it possible for it to be there. One of the reasons we started thinking about gravity in new ways is trying to understand what those connections might be between the Higgs boson, which we think is a fundamental property of Nature, and what we already know are fundamental properties of Nature such as the properties of gravity. So, this is all conjecture at the moment, which is why we needed to build the LHC and do these experiments because I can make theories that connect anything to anything, but we now have to go out and test those theories and see if the connections are really there. WHAT PROVOKED THE HYPOTHESIS OF A HIGGS BOSON IN THE FIRST PLACE? We found that we had very good theories of the particles that we knew. But those theories – even though they seemed to work well under most conditions – you could extrapolate them mathematically and they started to make mathematical nonsense. So, that’s a very bad situation to be in as a physicist where you have a theory that seems to be correct in terms of its predictions, but mathematically looks like it has contradictions. The bright idea of Mr. Higgs and some others was that if you just added this extra particle, the Higgs boson, you could make the theory work both mathematically and physically and Nature would be in mathematical harmony again. So, that’s a mathematical motivation, but until you go out and do the experiments, you don’t know really what is going on. DO YOU THINK THE HIGGS BOSON COULD BE RELATED TO THE MYSTERY OF DARK MATTER AND DARK ENERGY? Supersymmetry Yes, it could be. There is a theory that I like very much called ‘Supersymmetry.’ And in this theory, you explain both the existence of dark matter and the Higgs boson starting from a new principal of Nature called Supersymmetry, which relates particles to other kinds of particles. So, this is one of the things we want to test: whether Supersymmetry is really there and if the LHC turns on and works as planned, we should be able to tell you that. [ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia: “In particle physics, supersymmetery (SUSY) is a symmetry that relates elementary particles of one spin to another particle that differs by half a unit of spin and are known as superpartners. In other words, in a supersymmetric theory, for every type of boson, there exists a corresponding type of fermion and vice versa. As of 2008 there is no direct evidence that supersymmetry is a symmetry of nature. But supersymmetry is a common feature of most string theory versions, although supersymmetry could exist in Nature even if string theory is wrong.”] SUPERSYMMETERY COMES INTO PLAY IN THE FAMOUS BELL’S EXPERIMENT IN WHICH PHOTONS WERE SENT THROUGH SLITS AND THEY FOUND THAT"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"ALL THE PHOTONS KNEW THE SPIN DIRECTION OF ALL OTHER PHOTONS. ISN'T THAT SUPERSYMMETERY? It’s very close to that. Supersymmetry is sort of like relativity in that it would be a fundamental principal of Nature and the thing that it actually operates on is what we call quantum physics. What you were talking about in that famous photon experiment is one of the ways we determined that the world at a microscopic level obeys the laws of quantum physics. Supersymmetry is a symmetry of the laws of quantum physics. It changes the way quantum behavior operates in a microscopic world. DOESN’T IT IMPLY THAT EVERY SINGLE SUBATOMIC PARTICLE IS RELATED SOME HOW TO EVERY OTHER PARTICLE IN THE WHOLE UNIVERSE? That’s exactly right. It relates particles to other particles, including particles that we haven’t seen yet. So, this is the embarrassment of those of us who like Supersymmetry. Supersymmetry predicts many new particles and we have not seen them yet. When the LHC turns on, we hope to see at least a few of them. WHAT IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE IMPLICATION FROM SUPERSYMMETRY THAT ALL SUBATOMIC PARTICLES IN THE UNIVERSE WOULD SOME HOW BE CONNECTED – HOW DOES THAT RELATE TO THE MACRO WORLD THAT WE’RE IN? This is a very interesting connection. Normally, in particle physics, we are looking at very microscopic properties of the world. But then when we look out into the universe and we see dark matter and dark energy, those are the biggest things out there in the universe and we’re trying to explain those by studying the microscopic features of particle physics. Another way to look at it is that what we are trying to do at the LHC is re-create some of the conditions of the Big Bang that created the whole universe that we see now. Part of the reason why there is a connection between the Big Universe and the Microscopic Universe is because ultimately, everything came from a Big Bang explosion when everything was very small, very microscopic and very hot. That’s what we are trying to re-create here with the LHC. IN AN ALMOST POETIC WAY, IT WOULD MEAN THAT EVERY SUN AND BLACK HOLE THAT EXIST IN THE UNIVERSE NOW ARE SOME HOW ALL LINKED IF WE COULD ONLY UNDERSTAND HOW. That’s right. The phrase we like to use is that ‘inner space’ is related to ‘outer space’ and outer space is related back to inner space. It’s those connections we are really interested in. WHY IS IT THAT HUMANS FIGHT SO MUCH IF WE’RE ALL CONNECTED? (laughs) It’s interesting in physics because it has become so complicated and expensive, we now have these huge international collaborations. If the rest of the world behaved in the civilized way we behave in physics experiments, we would be much better off. We have something like 60 countries collaborating on the LHC from all over the world and we’re all getting along fine. BECAUSE YOU SPEAK ONE LANGUAGE, WHICH IS LARGELY MATH, YOU HAVE SIMILAR GOALS AND IT IS A WIN WIN SITUATION FOR EVERYONE. That’s exactly right. We all benefit by doing the best science. What Happens If Black Holes Are Produced in the Hadron Collider? I’M GOING TO ASK YOU A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION. IF THE HADRON COLLIDER IS TURNED ON IN THE MORNING OF SEPTEMBER 10, 2008, AND BLACK HOLES WERE PRODUCED AND THE EARTH WAS SWALLOWED UP, WOULD IT ALL HAPPEN SO FAST THAT NONE OF US WOULD KNOW ANYTHING? Yes, if black holes did swallow Earth, it would happen so fast you would not see it coming and you wouldn’t know it happened. It’s similar to other cosmic catastrophes, some of which might be the ultimate fate of our universe. If you talk about what is going to happen ultimately to our universe 100 billion years from now, there are some cosmic catastrophes, which could befall us through natural processes (such as star blowing up in nova or gamma ray burst). Fortunately, I guess, when those things happen, they are so catastrophic that"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"you don’t even know they are happening until it’s too late. And one of the things we don’t understand in physics is what happens inside a black hole. So, if you were swallowed by a black hole, you would be doing a very interesting experiment. I’m not sure what you would see once you were swallowed up. HOW WILL YOU KNOW IF ANY BLACK HOLES ARE PRODUCED? The kinds of black holes we are expecting are microscopic and will live for a very tiny fraction of a second. However, they will decay into many very energetic particles that we can detect in our big particle detectors. We expect that to be a very spectacular event. So, we have no doubt we can see these black holes if we are lucky enough to produce them. And we’re not worried that they are dangerous because if black holes can be produced at all, they are presumably happening with cosmic rays in the atmosphere all of the time. The difference here at LHC is that we are doing it in the laboratory and be able to get a handle on it and figure out what is actually going on. WOULD THE HIGGS BOSON BE ONE OF THE PARTICLES PRODUCED BY THE CREATION OF A BLACK HOLE AND ITS DISINTEGRATION? That’s certainly true. One of the things is that we might end up not producing Higgs bosons directly, but we might produce them from the decay of something more exotic such as a back hole or some Supersymmetry particles. WHAT ARE THE NAMES OF SOME OF THE PARTICLES THAT MIGHT SHOW UP IF A BLACK HOLE IS PRODUCED AND DISINTEGRATES? Neutralinos – Dark Matter? My favorite other particle I haven’t mentioned yet is called the ‘neutralino.’ This is a particle that is predicted by Supersymmetry to be the dark matter. So, that’s another particle we are very interested in. It could be produced from the decays of other particles or decays of black holes. If we could find that particle in the LHC experiments, we will have discovered the identity of dark matter. NEUTRALINO REMINDS ME OF NEUTRINO. IS THERE A CONNECTION? Yes. The reason they have a similar name is that both of them are neutral particles and they react very weakly with ordinary matter. So, this is why neutrinos are very difficult for us to detect and is the reason why neutralinos would be the dark matter. They would be dark precisely because they don’t interact, they don’t give off light like normal matter does. WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF NEUTRINOS? Neutrinos are produced by ordinary collisions. We do this all the time here at the Fermi Lab. We’re very interested in neutrinos because they are a strange type of particle, too, and we’re studying them right now with big experiments we’re doing here. BUT IN THE UNIVERSE, WHAT PROCESS PRODUCES NEUTRINOS? Neutrinos were produced in the Big Bang. And they are currently produced in the sun, for example. We constantly have millions of neutrinos passing through our bodies at any given time produced by the sun. They are produced in the basic fusion process that powers the sun. WHAT IS A NEUTRINO? A neutrino is very similar to an electron. It’s actually in the same family of particles as the electron. Like the electron, it’s rather light. In fact, neutrinos are even lighter than electrons. The big difference is that electrons have charge. That’s why electrons make up electricity and the neutrinos don’t. But other than that, we think they are very similar particles. WHAT IS A NEUTRALINO THOUGHT TO BE? We think the neutralinos are related to ordinary photons that make up light. We think it is what we call the ‘super partner.’ As I was saying that Supersymmetry relates particles to other particles. In this case, the neutralino is related to the photons of ordinary light. BUT WOULD IT BE THE DARK SIDE OF A PHOTON IF YOU ARE LINKING NEUTRALINOS TO DARK MATTER AND WE CAN SEE PHOTONS?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Yes, there is a great irony here. What I’m suggesting is that the dark matter is made up of a particle that is the cousin of the photon, which is what makes up all light. But that is indeed what the theory is telling us. THE NEUTRALINO WOULD PROVIDE WHAT FUNCTION WITH PHOTONS? What we think it does is make the universe behave in a more stable way at the microscopic level. Supersymmetry is a symmetry of how quantum physics works on a microscopic level. One of the things we are trying to understand in particle physics is: Why is our universe so stable at a microscopic level that it’s lasted for 13.7 billion years? So, we think the real purpose of this dark matter particle, neutralino, and of Supersymmetry in general, is to make the universe more stable and more well behaved, which has allowed life to form and for the universe to have been around for billions of years. I BELIEVE IT WAS COSMOLOGIST ALAN GUTH WHO TALKED YEARS AGO ABOUT MATTER, AS WE KNOW IT, BASICALLY BEING LIKE FOAM FLOATING ON TOP OF A HUGE UNKNOWN THAT WE STILL HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY OR INTERACT WITH? That’s right. If you look at empty space, it looks like nothing is happening. But if you have a powerful enough microscope, as we do using particle accelerators, what you see is that a lot is happening and it is a crazy kind of microscopic foam with all kinds of tiny particles doing all kinds of crazy things. So, the universe is actually not empty anywhere. Anywhere you go in intergalactic space, there are all kinds of things happening at a microscopic level. YOUR BOTTOM LINE WOULD BE, AS A HYPOTHESIS, THAT DARK ENERGY AND DARK MATTER ARE THE COUNTER-BALANCE AS IN A YIN AND YANG TO THE MATTER WORLDS? That’s right. In fact, dark energy and dark matter counter-balance each other. Dark matter is trying to make the expansion of the universe slow down and dark energy is trying to make it speed up. At the moment, they are about canceling each other out. It’s one of the puzzles of all this: if dark matter and dark energy have completely different causes, it is puzzling about why they seem to be in near balance at this point in the evolution of our universe. Dark Energy Is Driving Current Universe Expansion THAT WOULD SUGGEST STEADY STATE, BUT I THOUGHT THERE WAS DATA SUGGESTING THAT THE UNIVERSE IS ACCELERATING APART. That’s right, so the dark energy is making the expansion speed up. The dark matter is trying to make it slow down. It’s still not steady state because the universe is expanding, so what I’m talking about is whether the expansion itself is speeding up or slowing down. But there is no doubt that expansion is happening. THAT MEANS THAT RIGHT NOW THAT DARK ENERGY HAS MORE INFLUENCE THAN DARK MATTER? Yes. We think there is about three times as much dark energy as there is dark matter, which might seem like a lot more. But really, dark energy could have been a thousand times more or a thousand times less and it’s quite puzzling that the two, dark energy and dark matter, seem to be in almost a balance now. COULD DARK ENERGY AND DARK MATTER BE THE INFLUENCE OF UNDETECTED UNIVERSES BEYOND THIS ONE? It’s certainly possible. One of the things we’re interested in in particle physics is the possibility of extra dimensions of space. If there are extra dimensions of space, it means the universe is much larger than the big universe that we see because there are other directions you can move off into. People have thought about the question: Is dark matter dark because it is actually moved off a little bit in some extra dimension and living off in a different universe by itself and only talking to us through the force of gravity? So, that’s one of the things we’re trying to check by doing the LHC experiments. Einstein told us many years ago that gravity is really related to bending the fabric of space and time. So if there really is a bigger universe filled with other dimensions, gravity should"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"still connect everything to everything. And so, that should be our way of communicating with whatever is out there, even if it is invisible and moved off in another dimension. HOW STRANGE THAT IN SEPTEMBER 2008, WHEN THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER IS FIRED UP, THAT WE STILL HAVE NEVER FOUND ONE PROOF OF W H AT G R AV I T Y I S . Yes, I think this century will be the one in which we finally figure out gravity. We’ve figured out quite a bit about the other fundamental forces of Nature, but gravity is the big question mark. It’s the thing that people like me spend a lot of our time wondering about precisely because we’re so much in the dark. (LAUGHS) YES, AND IF THERE IS SUPERSYMMETRY WITHIN THIS UNIVERSE, THEN SUPERSYMMETRY MIGHT APPLY TO ALL UNIVERSES AND THAT WOULD MEAN THAT GRAVITY ITSELF MIGHT BE THE BINDER OF ALL THERE IS? That’s exactly right. In fact, Supersymmetry was invented by people doing what we call ‘string theory.’ The idea that there might also be multiple universes also came out of string theory, so these issues are all related together. WHAT IS YOUR OWN EXPECTATION ABOUT WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN YOUR LIFE TIME FROM THE LHC DATA? I think there is a very good chance we’re going to learn the identity of dark matter from the LHC. I think we are going to find the Higgs boson and understand what that new force of Nature is. And I think there is going to be at least one other big surprise that might have to do with gravity, black holes or something really exotic. Or it could be something that we just have not thought of.” A French nuclear power plant is providing the enormous power for the gigantic accelerator. Dr. Lykken told me, “Running the LHC requires huge amounts of electricity. Just their power bill alone is a large fraction of the money used to run the LHC laboratory.” Now, with the magnet breakdowns and spilled helium in the tunnel after the initial September 10, 2008, first test, CERN announced that the LHC won't be fired up again until spring 2009.
