Image dated May 6, 2007, and © by Chad. June 18, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - On Sunday evening, June 17, I received an email from George Pettit, a truck driver based in Shermansdale, Pennsylvania. He uses Earthfiles.com and listens to Coast to Coast AM Radio. So George was aware of the ongoing and evolving dragonfly-shaped drone story. He was studying the Chad photographs at Earthfiles: http://www.earthfiles.com/news.php?ID=1247&category=Environment George decided to rotate 180 degrees the lettering on the long tail to see if he could figure it out more clearly. He decided that in the middle section of the segmented tail, he could make out +x yx7+ C had's close-up of dragonfly \"drone\" lettering on long tail section, rotated 180 degrees in Photoshop so that the center panel reads +x yx7+. Chad wrote that his images were taken on May 6, 2007, in the general Bakersfield region. George then typed +x yx7+ into Google. He was so stunned by what came up that he sent me this email: \"Date: June 17, 2007 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com I looked at pic number 5 (in Earthfiles sequence of Chad photos, 5 has writing on tail section) and rotated it 180 degrees, and then googled the \" +x yx7+ \" writing on the craft. You must leave a space between x and y. This is the first thing comes up! PDS_VERSION_ID = PDS3 /*** FILE FORMAT ***/ RECORD_TYPE ...

C lementine 1 spacecraft that mapped the lunar surface in 1994. Illustration courtesy NASA. [ Editor's Note: Clementine 1 launched on January 25, 1994, from Vandenberg AFB, California, as a joint Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) / NASA effort to test lightweight sensors and electronics for military and civilian uses. (Proposed Clementine asteroid research spacecraft was cancelled in 1997.) www.astronautix.com writes about Clementine 1: \"Lunar insertion was achieved on February 21, 1994. Lunar mapping took place over approximately two months, in two parts. The first part consisted of a 5 hour elliptical polar orbit with a perilune of about 400 km at 28 degrees S latitude. After one month of mapping the orbit was rotated to a perilune of 29 degrees N latitude, where it remained for one more month. This allowed global imaging as well as altimetry coverage from 60 degrees S to 60 degrees N. After leaving lunar orbit, a malfunction in one of the on-board computers on May 7, 1994, at 14:39 UTC (9:39 AM EST) caused a thruster to fire until it had used up all of its fuel, leaving the spacecraft spinning at about 80 RPM with no spin control. This made the planned continuation of the mission, a flyby of the near-Earth asteroid Geographos, impossible. The spacecraft remained in geocentric orbit and continued testing the spacecraft components until the end of mission.\"] +x yx7+ Googles To: PDS_VERSION_ID = PDS3 /*** FILE FORMAT ***/ RECORD_TYPE = UNDEFINED /*** POINTERS TO START BYTE OFFSET OF OBJECTS IN FILE ***/ ^IMAGE_HISTOGRAM = 4783 <BYTES> ^BROWSE_IMAGE = 5807 <BYTES> ^IMAGE = 7535 <BYTES> /*** GENERAL DATA DESCRIPTION PARAMETERS ***/ MISSION_NAME = \"DEEP SPACE PROGRAM SCIENCE EXPERIMENT\" SPACECRAFT_NAME = \"CLEMENTINE 1\" DATA_SET_ID = \"CLEM1-L/E/Y-A/B/U/H/L/N-2-EDR-V1.0\" PRODUCT_ID = \"LHD0437D.262\" ORIGINAL_PRODUCT_ID = \"LHD30071.262\" PRODUCER_INSTITUTION_NAME = \"NAVAL RESEARCH LABORATORY\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"PRODUCT_TYPE = EDR EDR_SOFTWARE_NAME = \"NRL-ACT-MGRAB V1.2\" MISSION_PHASE_NAME = \"LUNAR MAPPING\" DATA_QUALITY_ID = \"N/A\" TARGET_NAME = \"MOON\" REVOLUTION_NUMBER = 262 FRAME_SEQUENCE_NUMBER = 0437 /*** TIME PARAMETERS ***/ START_TIME = 1994-04-15T16:01:30.411Z STOP_TIME = \"N/A\" UNCORRECTED_START_TIME = 1994-04-15T16:01:30.414Z SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_START_COUNT = \"N/A\" SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_STOP_COUNT = \"N/A\" PRODUCT_CREATION_TIME = 1994-11-29T17:41:38 /*** CAMERA RELATED PARAMETERS ***/ INSTRUMENT_NAME = \"LIDAR HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGER\" INSTRUMENT_ID = \"HIRES\" FILTER_NAME = \"D\" CENTER_FILTER_WAVELENGTH = 750 <nm> BANDWIDTH = 50 <nm> GAIN_MODE_ID = \"4\" MCP_GAIN_MODE_ID = \"154\" OFFSET_MODE_ID = \"5\" EXPOSURE_DURATION = 1.0670 <ms> LENS_TEMPERATURE = \"N/A\" FOCAL_PLANE_TEMPERATURE = 271.973 <K> CRYOCOOLER_TEMPERATURE = \"N/A\" CRYOCOOLER_DURATION = \"N/A\" /*** J2000 (ALSO CALLED EME2000) IS THE INERTIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM ***/ /*** USED TO SPECIFY OBSERVATIONAL GEOMETRY.
