It teetered as it righted itself and floated upward to hide in the cloud cover.” - Jacksonville, Florida, resident, 1997 R eturn to January 8, 2009 Earthfiles, Cape Canaveral, Florida February 3, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - After my January 8, 2009, Earthfiles report about the apparent star field camouflage on the huge V-shaped aircraft near Cape Canaveral, Florida, in August 1987, and my follow up news update on the January 29, 2009, Coast to Coast AM radio broadcast, I have received more email reports about V-shaped craft and other anomalies in which something moving in the sky appears to be using stars to disguise its location and motion. In this Part 1 Earthfiles are a few for consideration and I will follow up with more such reports in Part 2. I hope other eyewitnesses will contact me at earthfiles@earthfiles.com. 1) Subject: V-shaped craft, Jacksonville, FL Date: January 16, 2009 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com “I and a neighbor witnessed a massive V-shaped craft in broad daylight some years ago (circa 1997) in Jacksonville, Florida - it was identical to the craft on your site now. One overcast evening, around 5pm, I was watching beautiful lightning streak from one side of the sky to the other - it was just prior to a hurricane approaching up and just off the coast. One lightning bolt just suddenly stopped. I thought it was strange because all the others were sweeping great distances across the sky. Suddenly, a straight line began to materialize where the bolt had ended. It filled in until a huge V was visible. Obviously, this lightning had hit this V-shaped craft and did something to the craft's invisibility device. It teetered as it righted itself and floated upward to hide in the cloud cover. Each leg of the V was the size of a runway - the size blew me away! The construction was similar to modern buildings - huge panes of reflective panels - and all right angles - nothing round at all - a gigantic V-shaped craft. No sound. No visible propulsion. The exterior was comprised of two rows of panels per side and the size was so huge it made me dizzy as my mind fought to comprehend what my eyes were seeing. “I was able to make a surprisingly accurate image on my computer. It was gray - almost the same color as the clouds.” Illustration by Jackson, Florida eyewitness. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I yelled for my neighbor and he ran over to see what was going on. I pointed at the object and he uttered ‘Whoa!’ as his jaw dropped. We stood there in silence - totally blown away. Those 30 seconds or so were an eternity. Strangely, just inside my front door was a table with several cameras on it, but I was so startled I didn't even think of it! After being ridiculed by some close friends we told this to - the sighting was never mentioned again. Oh, yes - it was for real! Personally, I hope it is a USA secret craft. However, due to the extreme size - and the hair standing up on the back of my neck - I think not.” 2) Subject: Star-bottom craft moved across sky in '08, Puget Sound, Wa shingt on Date: January 30, 2009 2:10:02 AM MST To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com “I'm listening to you now on C2C, and the description of the craft in Florida of it hiding in the clouds, and being camouflaged in the sky was nearly the exact description of an event that unfolded before my eyes right after the new year of 2008, Puget Sound, Washington. I believe that I saw a gigantic craft with technology to cloak and camouflage and witnessed it hovering over my neighborhood for three entire days and nights before it left on the third day, which I also witnessed. During that time, the weather was very weird, there were strange phenomena all around, including sounds and flyovers which seemed to occur in a pattern or on schedule, and the sky took on a personality of its own. I did not make any report at that time because it seemed so vague, so strange, and I didn't know how to describe what I witnessed. I too, watched the skies for a good 2-3 hours when I first saw moving lights in the sky, and all manner of what I initially thought were planes at first. Then it looked as if these planes were attaching themselves to something, or docking as it were, like the stuff of Sci Fi television. Right before my very eyes while I was watching, the stars appeared to move with the clouds, and they also appeared to be situated differently than they were just moments earlier. The next day I witnessed the same phenomena. I noticed the clouds, which were moving very swiftly, had multiple layers to them and the layers appeared to be moving in different directions! And upon further study, they were not moving smoothly, as if the wind was gently moving them across the sky, rather it appeared to move in a choppy forward manner. It reminded me of when I was on a cruise ship, and how you feel when you're zipping across a choppy sea, kind of stop-start-stop-start. Not the type of fluidity that clouds would have. But it wasn't across the entire sky, it was a certain rectangular area that seemed to hover. I got the sense that there was a huge object moving slowly across the sky and was so huge that it was completely covering up the entire Puget Sound.” 3) Subject: V-Craft Spring 2001, La Conchita, Calif. Date: January 29, 2009 11:46:11 PM MST To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com “I cannot give you the exact date, but I lived in La Conchita California, and was staying with my father as he was selling the house. I was outside at about 11 PM Pacific. From off the ocean pretty much from the west, I saw a dark object blocking the stars. I was curious and went inside and grabbed a pair of Russian made b12 night vision. When I got back outside, I looked up and what was coming was BIG, and it came right over La Conchita - no sound. It had three lights they were not blinking and all red. This V-shaped craft, once it literally went over my head, had to be as big as an aircraft carrier. It cleared Rincon mountain by no more then a few hundred feet. Think stealth easily 800 feet in length, by 2/3s that wide at the tail. Without the night vision, all you could see was a dark outline and that something was blocking the stars as it came by, and NO SOUND, not even a whisper. It couldn't have been more than 1,400 feet up, because I don't think Rincon mountain is higher then 600 feet, if that. This craft came from the same direction that I used to see missiles shot off by Vandenburg AFB, but a few degrees south. It was also traveling at a VERY slow rate of speed and took"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"about a minute to complete the pass over my head. I watched this for 20 minutes from off the ocean until beyond the mountain, minus the few minutes it took me to grab the night vision. I did not see any markings. This craft was smooth, no breaks, no protrusions.” 4) Subject: Star Field Hiding Triangle-Shaped Craft? Date: February 3, 2009 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com “In Grafenwoehr, Germany, in 2002, a friend and I (we were in the Army) were scanning the sky for satellites (for fun) with our night vision scopes in order to view dimly lit objects. We observed three dim points of light traveling overhead. I am not sure of the direction of travel — perhaps eastward. The points of light were arranged in a triangle shape. The three lights would appear to be flying in formation except there were no subtle independent movements of the objects, like aircraft flying in close formation. I am not certain of the altitude, except it was very high, perhaps low orbit. Both my friend and I thought it was one object. But we thought that was impossible because we could see stars in the back ground. The lights were not bright, the intensity no greater than any other dimly lit satellites in the sky. We could not see the lights without the aid of the night vision scopes. The scopes were an/pvs-14 night vision devices.” 5) Subject: Triangular Piece of Black Sky, mid-1960s, Susanville, Calif. Date: January 30, 2009 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com “In the mid-1960s when I was in, or just graduated form high school, I was on a high bluff 'inspiration point' just above the town of Susanville, California, in a small convertible at night. The bluff is just at the west of the town, a boundary of the valley below. Stars were out, a quiet wind, beautiful. We (girlfriend and I) noticed a space of sky with no stars develop behind us toward the west over sparsely populated mountains covered with fir trees, and move over us and hover at the edge of the open valley. There were no stars in a large dark triangular area with tiny lights at 3 corners. It stayed still for a time and then slowly, quietly backed up and was lost in the mountains behind us. Herlong Army Depot (before it was decommissioned) is at the opposite end of the valley, maybe 15 miles in a straight line from our location at that time.” 6) Subject: Moving Piece of Black Sky - 1961, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada Date: January 30, 2009 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com “I was listening to your Coast news report about a gentleman who saw a UFO that seemed transparent, in as much as there were stars appearing through it. While he was describing the UFO and what he had seen, I thought that he could well be me describing what I had seen at about 8:10 PM, October 15, 1961, except for the ‘stars.’ On that evening I was out in the back yard with my telescope and had just that day been fitted with a new pair of eyeglasses, so I was excited about being able to see the vast display of stars on a moonless night - no clouds to be seen -no discernable wind - a perfect night for viewing. My location at that time was Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Looking up at the sky to pick a spot to aim my telescope, I noticed a patch of sky that had no stars, which seemed inappropriate considering the sheer volume of stars to be seen everywhere else. Concentrating on this void space, I realized that it was moving. What I saw - or rather didn't see - made it feel like my hair was standing on end. This ‘object,’ if I can call a void space an object, moved due south from where I first saw it and disappeared off the southern horizon a short time later. The object which I only saw as an absence of stars had no outline, but it was either very huge and high, or relatively small and low. There was absolutely no sound that I could hear. I had no time to train my telescope on the object."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"After it had disappeared from view, I went into the house and called the traffic observers at the airport and asked if they had picked up anything strange on their radar. They said that they had not and suggested that I had seen either a weather balloon or clouds. Neither of these options made any sense whatsoever to me. I made a few notes which I placed in my scrapbook - which I have just retrieved. I guess that I made a few calculations at the time and estimated that if the object had been at 1000 feet, it would have been flying at about 300 miles an hour - but I had no way of knowing how high it actually was. At that time there was nobody that I knew that I could give this information to. All I knew was that I had observed something that I could not rationally explain - i.e. an unobserved flying object. A year or so ago, I read that there had been some experimentation in the late sixties with stealth aircraft and I thought that that might explain my sighting - but perfect silence? I have a commercial pilot's licence (did have at that time), and I am, a professional engineer - not subject to being deceived or hallucinations.” 7) Subject: 1981 Dark Moving Sky Object, Sylvania, Ohio Date: January 30, 2009 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com “My sighting happened around 1981, just west of Toledo, Ohio in a city called Sylvania. I can't be exact on the day, but it was in the fall during the Perseid meteor shower [ Perseids peak August 12 in most years.] It was cold that night and the sky was very clear - no moon. A friend and I were watching the northern sky, but every so often I would spend a few minutes looking to the west and east. I couldn't see much to the south because of our big tree we had in the front yard. After a while I became familiar with the visible stars in each direction that I would concentrate on. But the next time I looked to the west, the stars that I noticed a few minutes earlier were gone. It was strange to me and it puzzled me because I knew that the stars had not faded into the horizon that quickly. It puzzled me for a few minutes and then I turned my attention back to the north to watch more of the shower. But this was really starting to bug me because about 3 minutes later, I looked to the western sky again and low and behold, the stars that were gone a few minutes earlier miraculously had reappeared. Then the more I looked, I faintly caught the glimpse of something in the sky like a dark cloud, but really all that I could see was the silhouette of something against the dark night sky. I really started to focus on the western sky and completely ignored what was happening in the northern sky all together. This dark object came closer to us heading due east slowly. Finally after about 15 minutes, it was directly above us. This thing was huge! It had to have been at least the size of a football field in diameter. It was just so dark that I could only make out certain rough features around the edges. It was roundish, and it was completely silent. It was just freaky, and as it had appeared, it slowly drifted off to the east just as it came slowly from the west. I know what I saw. I was frightened as well as excited. It was not a plane, cloud, or a figment of my imagination. This was real!” T o be continued in Part 2.
