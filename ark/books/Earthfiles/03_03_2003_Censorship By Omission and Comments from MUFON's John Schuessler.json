Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Censorship By Omission and Comments from MUFON's John Schuessler © 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe March 3, 2003 Littleton, Colorado - This morning Cherlette LeFevre of the Seattle UFO/Paranormal Group told me that the SUPG board of directors voted to \"dis-invite\" me from being the long-scheduled evening speaker on the first night of their May 2003 Seattle conference, \"because of the controversial nature of the Brazil case.\" (See Earthfiles February and March 2003 reports about Corguinho, Brazil.) Cherlette emphasized that MUFON members had been e-mailing her group to protest a presentation of the Urandir Oliveira \"hoax,\" as branded by Brazil MUFON Director and publisher of Brazilian UFO Magazine , Ademar Jose Gevaerd, known as A. J. I asked her, \"Isn't this censorship before even the physical evidence from the scientists has been reported?\" She said, \"No, we just don't want to be a battleground.\" I said, \"I'm not doing battle with anyone. I was invited to go to Brazil to collect physical evidence and have it analyzed in American labs that I trust, with the goal of science insights about what happened to the bed sheet and ceiling in Urandir Oliveira's bedroom on September 15, 2002. It is A. J. Gevaerd who is doing the attacking.\" Then she said, \"A. J. Gevaerd is international MUFON and MUFON people in the United States have sent us a lot of e-mails saying they don't want to hear about a hoax.\" So, I called John Schuessler, Director, International Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) in Littleton, Colorado, to see if MUFON had in fact taken an official or unofficial position to ignore the Corguinho, Brazil phenomena, as dictated by A. J. Gevaerd. I said I really would like to understand, \"since you are the Director of MUFON in the United States, why the Director of MUFON in Brazil, A. J. Gevaerd, should be blasting the United States e-mail lists, including some MUFON, with protests about this Urandir Oliveira case, calling me names for ignoring his claims that it's all a hoax. Linda Howe is not researching for MUFON or anybody else. I'm an investigative reporter and I'm working independently. And to be attacked the way A. J. Gevaerd is attacking, John, I would like to understand why?\" Interviews: John Schuessler, Director, International Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), Littleton, Colorado: \" I would, too. First of all, MUFON does not support attacks on individuals, no matter who they are. We do not support that. That's for the record. We only attack data, not people. Anything other than that is reprehensible, as far as I'm concerned. I don't attack people and I don't expect other people to attack people. That's only done by people who do not have data. For the record, if you are doing an investigation where you collect samples and you take them to the laboratory, the results should stand on the results of the laboratory, not on somebody's opinion. I SHARE EXACTLY THAT POSITION. THAT'S WHY I'M BAFFLED. YOU MUST BE GETTING THE SAME.E-MAILS? I haven't gotten anything from him, or anyone else. Not a single e-mail. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"YOU, DIRECTOR OF MUFON, IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE E-MAILS FROM A. J. GEVAERD IN BRAZIL? Not a one. I haven't seen anything from anybody on this. You are completely surprising me. The State Director of Washington was here at MUFON headquarters (in Littleton, Colorado) all weekend and didn't know anything about it. Any case has the right to be investigated and re-investigated by anybody any time. That's the first thing. There is no reason why a person who investigates, or who claims to investigate a case, should object to someone else doing it. It's done in police work all the time. Police cases are cross-checked. One guy's side says, 'This is not the case.' The other guy's side says, 'It is.' So, there is an investigation by both teams usually. And that's just common practice. It's nothing untoward. Secondarily, you have been open about what I have seen today by putting what you have found on your website for all the world to see and read. AND I HAVE REPORTED THE CASE ON THREE RADIO PROGRAMS. And reported it openly. Nothing else has been posted except I don't know if Gevaerd has a website or not. I doubt it, but he has not bothered to send anyone anything except the e-mails I got (forwarded) from you that claim it's a hoax. That's an empty claim if there isn't any proof. I'm disappointed that something is coming into this country saying MUFON is behind it and MUFON doesn't even have a case report. At least as far as I know, there is no case report. YOU TOOK OVER THE DIRECTORSHIP OF MUFON IN WHAT MONTH AND YEAR? October 2000. SINCE OCTOBER 2000, HAVE YOU HAD ANY CASE FILE SENT TO YOU FROM A. J. GEVAERD IN BRAZIL? I can't say I have had none, but I don't remember any. But I know there has been nothing on this that has reached me. MY POSITION IS THAT THERE IS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE THAT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED AND WE SHOULD HEAR WHAT SCIENTISTS SAY. Well, you're an independent investigator and I uphold your right to independently investigate something, whether or not I would agree with you on the answer. You have a right to do that and I wholeheartedly support that. That's what this is all about, free inquiry. If we cancel free inquiry, we might as well take anybody's answer for anything and say, 'That's good enough for me, duh.' IF THEY ARE ATTACKING EVEN BEFORE THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE HAS BEN ANALYZED... That's not the way we do it. It's officially not the way we do it. IT'S WORTH CLARIFYING TONIGHT THAT THIS IS NOT YOUR POSITION AND YOU KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THIS CASE UNTIL I CALLED YOU TODAY! Yes, nobody has even bothered to tell me. Now, having seen your website reports today, I am really impressed with what you have done. I have a lot of respect for Lefty Levengood and when he does an analysis he usually tries very hard to clearly and simply tell the truth about the analysis. He doesn't make things up. As such, his analysis is one good data point. If someone wants to do a second analysis, which I always encourage more than one analysis by more than one lab, they would probably find the same thing, that is really damning evidence for something."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"PHYLLIS BUDINGER, SHE IS A WELL RESPECTED ANALYTICAL CHEMIST WHO HAS WORKED WITH LEVENGOOD ON MANY INVESTIGATIONS AND SHE HAS NO EXPLANATION FOR HOW THERE COULD BE POLYESTER WOVEN IN COTTON WITH POLYESTER HAVING A 500 DEGREE F. MELTING TEMPERATURE, COTTON HAVING A 300 DEGREE F. SCORCH TEMPERATURE, AND YET HERE ARE MELTED POLYESTER THREADS THROUGHOUT THE (UNSCORCHED) COTTON. ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS HAS BEEN THAT WHATEVER THIS WAS WAS MOLECULARLY MAKING A DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THE COTTON AND THE POLYESTER IN WHATEVER ENERGY WAS APPLIED. That's an interesting hypothesis that needs to be followed and determined what could do that. One of the problems we have in this field is that everyone wants to investigate it like they did 30 years ago and not look at new technologies and new concepts. I think that's one reason we don't get answers. That's why I encourage revisiting cases and looking again at them.\" We b s it e : http://www.mufon.com/ Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
