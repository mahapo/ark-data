Return to Part 1 December 12, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Spontaneous Combustion After years of handling the Alien tools, the tools became more intimate with their handlers, a kind of “bond” formed between them. As bizarre as it sounds, the tools shared secrets with tenured scientists that they would not reveal to a new or unfamiliar scientist. All the Alien items performed more than one function, but discovering additional functions other than the primary one was achieved easier by some scientists than by others. Personality played a major role in the rate of success a technician achieved. If his or her demeanor was friendly and they were slow to lose their temper, they were apt to achieve success more readily. Ironically, those who were chosen for this work were usually from the “type A” personality. They tended to be more aggressive than the general population and very goal-oriented, unsatisfied if they did not get quick results. They were recruited from the top "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"ranks in their profession. The A personalities were also people with integrity and tended to be beyond reproach. On top of that, they needed to have the highest level of security clearance before they were hired. All of them were believed to be of good character and good will, with one exclusive objective “to serve their country.” Still, those who hired them were mere mortals, with the mortal tendency to fail when attempting to know the human heart. But something as simple as an Alien tool knows completely what's in the heart and mind of a man or woman and allows itself to be used accordingly. No determination was made regarding whether the Aliens were benevolent or evil beings. There was evidence indicating that they could be either one, or both. Most of the items that were catalogued and identified with performing a particular function were found to be beneficial to humans. Other items performed in ways that seemed purely evil. It was possible that the technician misused these items, or they are evil and are used to do atrocious things to humans. One item that seemed to do evil was a 1-inch cube. It looked like it was made of clear glass and had a small sphere the size of a pearl suspended in the center of it. The sphere pulsated with every color in the rainbow. “It was a beautiful sight to see,” was a common utterance of those who saw it. But its beauty hid its dastardly purpose. Unlike many of the other Alien objects, only one function was identified for this object. When it was placed on the chest of a person, the sphere left the cube and penetrated the chest cavity, entering the lung. It could be administered from the front or the back of a person, but it would not discharge into anything but a living human lung. It left no puncture wound nor any other sign of entry on the body. It was never determined whether the sphere had mass or if it was a ball of photons or some other form of matter or anti-matter. After it completed its task, it reappeared back into the cube. The whole episode lasted only sixty seconds, not enough time to study exactly what was taking place in the body. Once the sphere penetrated the lung, the whole body went into a state of transmutation. The sphere appeared to use the oxygen in the lungs to accelerate its function. Exactly fifty-two seconds after the injection, the whole body vaporizes into thin air. On one occasion, all that was left was a few external body parts: fingers and toes. Interestingly, the scientists who were there when this first happened were not injured in any way, even though they were a few inches away from the body. It was a horrifying sight, so the experiment was performed only twice. They only did it a second time so they could see what was taking place in the body after the injection. Spontaneous combustion had been a mystery for many decades and still will be for the general population. The committee now knows that it is not spontaneous, but caused for a purpose. That purpose is now the mystery. The device did not have a triggering mechanism. The instrument functioned like all the other items from the Alien ship. It was self-acting. How did the object know not to penetrate the lung of one of the scientists? It probably would have if it were placed on the scientist's chest. The scientists learned from the mistakes of their colleagues: \"Never come into direct contact with any Alien object!\" Clothing of any material, as well as ordinary gloves, were sufficient protection from the Alien instruments. To function, the Alien instruments needed to come into contact with exposed living skin. Certain Alien objects functioned only inside the Alien craft. When they activated, they triggered a corresponding response on the ship. An opening occurred, which revealed hidden rooms or small spaces. Some rooms contained tables and equipment that resembled futuristic surgical tables. Others were dark, empty spaces or voids that resonated with mysterious sounds and vibrations. Few scientists ever entered those rooms. Those who did were never able to put into words what they found in them. Doorways have no seams and there is no hint to where they are, except when by coincidence someone happened to walk by the area where the hidden room is located while in possession of the Alien device coded to open that particular door. One hidden door revealed a small chamber with a single seat in it. The seat was molded to fit a human being. There are no cushions on any of the seats on the craft. Some seats like the one found in the chamber had arm rests. The seats were made of the same material as the ship, a soft metallic material. The chamber had a glow to it. It was hard to explain, but one technician described it as “having a heavy feel to it. The color was yellowish and the air in the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"chamber felt thick, somewhat like Jell-O.” The chamber was the scariest spot discovered on the craft. It left all who saw it with chills. None of the scientists who studied the chamber dared sit in it. The chamber was not much bigger than a nook in the wall, with just enough room for one seat and leg room for an average size man. The scientists who were detailed to study the chamber submitted a requisition for a human guinea pig to the committee. They needed a live body to test a theory. They believed that once a person is placed into the seat, the opening would close, “And only God knows what it will do to that person.” The unlucky victim who was placed into that seat was a man in his fifties. He had no living family members or friends and was a recluse who lived alone. The search committee, which was in charge of procuring live bodies for the scientists, found him through a network of government hospitals that were set up to provide such a service. This man suffered massive injuries in a car accident. He was still alive, but just barely. Everything possible to save him had been done. When it was determined that he would die, his most serious wounds were sewed up and most of the bleeding was stopped. He was delivered to the committee two hours after leaving the hospital and was placed into the chamber minutes after he arrived. The man could not sit up by himself. There were no straps to hold him in place, but apparently none were needed. Once he was placed on the seat, the seat held him there as if he were a piece of metal that came in contact with a magnet. Seconds after being placed in the seat, the remote unit that activated the opening of the chamber in the first place made an indescribable sound. The sound triggered the opening in the nook to close. Once closed, the object made other sounds and some kind of process in the chamber began. After five minutes passed, the remote device made more sounds and the door opened. The man stood up and walked out of the nook. There was no evidence of his wounds and he appeared to be in perfect health. For an instant, everyone present thought they had discovered the cure for all major injuries. The euphoria was short-lived, however, as they watched the man - or what they had hoped would be a man - walk into another room, a room that only revealed itself when the living body approached it. The scientists soon realized they were witnessing a nightmare and not a miracle. As they watched the man walk past them without acknowledging anyone, they could tell by the look in his eyes that something terrible had taken place. His eyes never wandered, but stared straight ahead as if he were a zombie. The room that he entered was much larger than the cubicle that transformed him. It was circular and had something similar to a bench seat that curved around with the walls. After the man entered the room, he sat on the bench and continued to stare with a blank expression toward the center of the room. The scientists tried to speak to the man, but he did not respond, although his eyes blinked at normal intervals and his breathing was normal. He was operating on “auto-pilot.” Whoever was piloting the body before he was put into the nook either bailed out or was kicked out. In either case, nobody was home. The body was given a complete physical and was found to be in perfect health. It was not until they x-rayed him that they found something abnormal surrounding his internal organs, mainly the stomach, intestinal tract and his kidneys. Since the body did not eat or drink nor did it perform the normal body functions and still remained in top physical health, the scientists surmised that the foreign object in the body was some kind of Alien life support system. It kept the body alive, but what purpose could there be for a body with the lights out? The body remained in that room for weeks, then months and then years. The body did not age or deteriorate and remained in a dormant state (sitting upright) the whole time. Not only did that body not age, but there was something about being in the Alien craft that kept all the people who worked in it younger. It was as if their biological clocks stopped when they entered the craft. Einstein's theory that time slows down as one approaches the speed of light was well know to all who worked there, but the craft was stationary. The same week that the scientists discovered the “zombie Machine,” they brainstormed on what purpose the body could have. Ideas that ranged from using it to clean up the lab to working around nuclear waste sites were not"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"taken seriously. The scientists considered doing an autopsy on the body and removing the Alien organ that was sustaining it, but orders from higher up told them not to tamper with the man. They were told to keep a vigil on him to see if the body was being incubated by the craft for some purpose that no one could yet understand. What the scientists did understand was that everything about the Alien craft was self-directed. It seemed that they were only there to observe and were allowed to participate on a limited basis. After a year passed and the body remained the same, the scientists were given permission to perform a few experiments with the body.
