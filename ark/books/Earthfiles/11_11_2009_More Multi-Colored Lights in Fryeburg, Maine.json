C lose to the Conway, New Hampshire border is Fryeburg, Maine, a little south of the White Mountain National Forest and northwest of Portland, Maine. November 11, 2009 Fryeburg, Maine - On October 12, 2009, Earthfiles reported an interview with Jonathan Spak, 37-years-old, owner of a restaurant who photographed anomalous, colorful lights over Fryeburg, Maine. Now a month later on November 4, 2009, Jonathan has photographed more anomalous lights that are included in this Earthfiles report. If anyone else might be having repeated sightings of multi-colored, aerial lights that persist in a specific geographical area, please email me at earthfiles@earthfiles.com. Camera Specs Provided by Jonathan: “- Cannon EOS Rebel XSi; Shooting Mode - Flash Off; Shutter Speed - 20; Aperture Value - 5.6; Exposure Compensation - 0; ISO - 800. - All images were taken with my 300mm zoom lens fully extended. - Time lapse length in auto mode is only the duration of the previous picture. For example during a clearly lit sequence, the camera could potentially fire off 10 shots in a few seconds. This being a night shot, as soon as the previous picture was done, it went into the sequence of taking the next and I'm not sure how long that was. - Below pictures 139 & 142 were on auto mode 15 (seconds?) shutter speed, 5.6 Aperture and 800 ISO.
