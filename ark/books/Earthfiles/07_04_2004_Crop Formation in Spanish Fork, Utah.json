July 4, 2004 Spanish Fork, Utah - Over the past decade, there have been at least nine crop formations in Utah and at least three in the Provo and Spanish Fork area south of Salt Lake City. But the largest was in College Ward, about 80 miles north of Salt Lake City and Provo, in 1998 on the same day that similar circles appeared in Oregon, Idaho and Belgium. This year on Saturday night, June 26, 2004, a Spanish Fork farmer noticed plants down in a barley field. He called his father who owns the field. The father was angry that any intruder would touch his plants and called the police. By Tuesday morning, June 29, a story about the new, 4-ring Spanish Fork crop formation was published in the local newspaper. Nancy Talbott, President of BLT Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts, heard the news. Nancy has been testing plants and soils from crop formations for several years and in 2004, she is studying what effect energy systems that create patterns in crops might have on mycorrhizal fungi that are known to grow symbiotically in plant roots. So she organized some samplers to coordinate with the farm owners and surface soil, soil plugs and plants were collected for study. Interview: Nancy Talbott, President, BLT Research, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts: \"The crop is barley and there are no tramlines as we're used to them (in England). The plants have node elongations, but relatively subtle. The only way to tell for certain would be to do an analysis of the node lengths. Also, node expulsion cavities were seen by the BLT samplers.

Mycorrhizal Fungi Study We've done surface soil sampling and core sampling for the mycorrhizal fungi study. We did quite a bit so it took a couple of days to get it all done. ( Howe's Note: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM) has been found in association with plant roots all over the world. A clear symbiotic relationship has been demonstrated whereby plants exude photosynthates for the fungus to metabolize; in return, the fungus scavenges for essential elements that may be rare in a particular soil.) It's a study of fungi in the roots of the crop circle plants. The idea here is that these energies hypothesized to create crop circles are likely, if they have an effect on the plants as demonstrated by Levengood's work over the years and on the minerals as demonstrated by the XRD study we could then expect that we would see changes in the fungi that will be consistent with exposure to one energy or another. The idea is to see if we can find supporting evidence for any of the data that's already been submitted by various studies by different people. You don't know what you're going to find until you've done it. WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU'LL HAVE RESULTS BACK ON SOIL AND PLANTS? This fungi study is going to take all summer long. We're going to look at five or six of these (in crop formations) this summer and the results of that won't be available until the fall or winter probably winter 2004. The surface soil work on this might be ready in a month. DO YOU HAVE ANY PREVIOUS DATA FROM FUNGI STUDIES IN THE ROOTS OF CROP CIRCLE PLANTS?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"No, this is a brand new first time look. There are a wide variety of questions and hope we are going to have the right ones. PART OF WHAT YOU WILL BE LOOKING FOR WOULD BE THE EFFECT OF SOMETHING LIKE A MICROWAVE RADIATION OR IONIZATION PLASMA IMPACT ON ROOTS? Right. What would the presence of microwave radiation do to (the fungi?) There is already it's known that these fungi respond to certain conditions in certain ways. Therefore, if in fact the microwave radiation was present or ionization or this energy that seems to be responsible for the changes in the crystallization of the clay minerals there should be some sort of marked effect on at least some of the fungi. That is what we are looking for. YOU MIGHT EVEN SEE COOKED FUNGI? I can't answer that. I suspect so, but I can't say yet. Crystallization in Soil Clay WHAT ABOUT CRYSTALS IN THE SOIL? (BLT conducted an x-ray diffraction study, XRD, of clay-mineral crystallization in a 1999 Edmonton, Alberta, Canada crop formation. See: http://www.bltresearch.com/xrd.html The XRD study is very expensive and the only sensible way to do that is first of all, you've got to have a lot of money to pay for the work. And you have to do a lot of samples and a lot of controls to do an XRD examination. One or two or a half dozen samples does not mean anything. So, there is no point, unless you are doing a real major study, you can't just look for them simply, is what I'm trying to get across. I'm hoping some day to repeat the XRD study, but it will be an entire project, if we do, and it will mean we've been able to raise significant funding. What Spanish Fork Residents Saw and Heard The most interesting thing about this Spanish Fork formation so far is we do have several reports one from the local newspaper reporter - of animals behaving very peculiarly, just as we had in Arkansas. See 06-02-04 Earthfiles . A dog, or multiple dogs, at the business across the road were reported to have been barking all night long and carrying on. Then we found a neighbor abutting this property who had a dog and a cat, both of which were making very strange noises throughout the night. These animals were both inside the house and they were described as making eerie noises and refused to go outside, which is not normal. They normally go outside quite a bit. And apparently a woman who lives in that house at some point went outside to see why the animals what was causing the problem with the animals and she reports that she became frightened outside and got a very creepy feeling and had to go back inside. She didn't see or hear anything, but her home is within a quarter mile of the field. Something spooked her. This is an interview being followed up now. The only other report that was interesting that there was cell phone failure reported by the farmer's son in the formation and I gather that was on Tuesday, the first day he went in. He reported that his cell phone would not work. The field workers that their batteries failed consistently in their cameras and they had to replace them three times in order to get the photographs we take on the ground. Then I got an e-mail from a local visitor on Wednesday who said his son was able to use their cell phone on Wednesday. SO A TRANSIENT EFFECT? So, it was either a very brief effect or the owner's son there was something wrong with his cell phone. The camera, however, is working perfectly normally since it was inside the formation. It just got battery drainage when it was in there. DID ANYONE REPORT ANY LIGHTS OR UNUSUAL AERIAL PHENOMENA? There is one report we are still chasing and I have a feeling it's going to take us a week or so. But there is a report of unusual light phenomena and until we know the details, I would rather hang back. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Crop Formation's Physical Impact On Farmers Another thing is that the farmer's son and field worker both reported a very intense aching of their legs. This has been reported in Europe in a couple of situations and I think you might remember in Maryland some years ago? YES, BLUE BALL, MARYLAND. When I visited that case several weeks after it occurred, I also had this. People who had growing pains in their legs as kids might remember. It's a very distinct and unpleasant ache that many children go through as their bones are growing and developing. That's what the farmer's son reported in this case the night after he was in the formation, which would have been Tuesday, June 29. The field worker reports the same thing and since it is not widely known that that can happen, I wonder if it might be important in this case also. DOES THE LEG ACHE AFFECT SOME PEOPLE AND NOT OTHERS? The aching thing in every case I know about where that has been reported it has in fact affected everyone who was there at that time. CLOSE TO THE TIME THE FORMATION WAS CREATED. Yes, and usually in specific locations in the formation. I know in Holland where this has occurred a number of times, Robbert Van den Broeke's father has told me many times that his son would report various feelings or insights or would see things that the father wouldn't. The father told me he wished that he could. Then there was a formation a couple of years ago that they related to a member of their family who had passed on. Robbert was feeling the tingling in his legs very strongly and told his father exactly where to stand. In that case, when Peter did stand in that area, he then experienced the aches in his leg also. And that's what happened to me when I was in Maryland when George Reynolds, who was the field worker in that case, told me where he had been standing and I felt it also quite strongly. Later that day, it hurt like the dickens. I REMEMBER THAT BLUE BALL FORMATION AT THE TIME WAS THE LONGEST NODE LENGTHENING AND REORIENTATION THAT W. C. LEVENGOOD HAD EVER MEASURED. The most elongated, yes. Since then there have been one or two others that were at that range or slightly greater, but that was up to 200% elongation. Blue Ball, Maryland, 1995. Top: Normal wheat stems and growth nodes. Bottom: Nodes lengthened 130 to 200 percent and reoriented. Photographs © 1995 by biophysicist W. C. Levengood. How to Report Crop Formation to BLT Research I think the telephone call is the fastest and easiest and if people call me, I'll call them right back to save their long distance charges. If in fact we are going to continue to get a few more formations for this (fungi) study, the sooner the better."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Telephone number: 617-492-0415 Website: www.bltresearch.com Right on the top in the left hand corner, it says: 'Report a crop circle.' If you click on that, you get a form that you just fill in and then hit Go. More Information: Crop farmers' livelihoods are dependent upon harvesting. So, in the event of crop formations in fields, Nancy suggests that farmers in the United States - as some farmers have done in England - deliberately mow a path to the crop pattern and then charge entrance to visitors. That way the farmer can receive some financial compensation for his downed crop, the public can see the crop formation, and research people can investigate. A legal proviso in all instances should be that visitors enter farm property, with its unexpected holes and ditches often hidden by tall grass or plants, at their own risk.
