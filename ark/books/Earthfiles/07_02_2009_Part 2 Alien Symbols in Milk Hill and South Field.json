Right: Milk Hill Summer Solstice crop formation that evolved in three parts: Part 1 reported on June 21; Part 2 reported on June 22; and Part 3 reported on June 30, was an addition of five, 700-foot-long lines of “alien symbols.” Aerial image © 2009 by Lucy Pringle.

R eturn to Part 1 July 2, 2009 Wiltshire County, England - The Australian scientist and retired physicist and telescope engineer, Mike Reed, have been analyzing the June 27, 2009, South Field pattern of “alien symbols” and comparing them to the Milk Hill symbols that emerged on June 30, 2009, as a third addition to the original Summer Solstice versions of June 21 to June 22, 2009, discussed in Part I of this Earthfiles report. South Field - “Alien Symbols” Or “Electrical Grids” On June 27, 2009 “A lien symbols” reported on Saturday, June 27, 2009, in the South Field near Alton Priors, Wiltshire, England.

My best guess would be that July 7th will somehow be significant in our planetary history - twenty crop pictures since April 23 - possibly for revealing the first signs of instability in our Sun, leading up to December of 2012. Yet right now on our Sun, with only six days to go, nothing really spectacular is happening. Those are alien messages for sure, but what are they trying to tell us? Do they think similarly enough to us, so that we can communicate without errors of interpretation? I don't know. But it is surely a great scientific problem, and we are right at the cutting edge of it! In other words, the SETI question is over: They are here, and they are talking. What can we do now to understand?” C ontinued in Part 3: Quetzalcoatl's T Cross?
