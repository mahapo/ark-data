To be more computer-upload-friendly, the reprints will be divided into parts. Here begins Part 9 of Status Report VII, from February 1994. Mexican Crashes and U. S. Retrievals? An Alleged Crash in Chihuahua Reveals U. S. Intervention In my series of Status Reports, I have maintained a policy that I would not publish a major UFO event, including crash/retrievals, from anonymous sources unless it came from an intermediary known to me who, in turn, knew the source. The 1942 crash case and the geriatrics alien exam case reported earlier in this Status Report are examples. Too often, research has been misled by hoaxed reports of UFO crash/retrievals designed to muddy the waters. But, in my judgment, there seems to be a legitimacy to the 1974 Chihuahua crash report. Despite the risk of publishing a bunch of baloney, the full text of the report is reproduced herewith, hoping that the incident can be verified or exposed as misinformation. The Chihuahua report came to me from Elaine Douglass of Washington, D. C., officer of Operation Right To Know, who coordinated the picket march in Washington, D. C., in July 1993. Receiving it in the mail in the summer of 1993, postmarked Santa Ana, California, she said, \"It came probably as a result of publicity following the march.\" The report was entitled Research Findings on the Chihuahua Disk Crash , bore the sender's initials, \"JS,\" and was addressed to \"Deneb Team Members\" dated March 23, 1992. When Elaine and I discussed the report in August 1993, neither of us had seen it published before or knew of other copies in the hands of researchers. One compelling reason I believe the report is worthy of space in this status report is based on my recollection that I had heard of the Chihuahua case before, either in the late 1970s or early 1980s. The only detail I vaguely recall is that a U. S. military team had covertly crossed into Mexico to retrieve the object. Alleged UFO Crashes in Mexico "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" More on Mexico. I am aware of other incursions into that country. One was a naval retrieval in my January 1989 UFO Crash/Retrievals: Is the Cover-up Lid Lifting? I reported a case occurring in 1948 when a U. S. naval team from the U.S.S. McKinley docked in San Diego. It was a command ship, cargo class for amphibious operations, and was dispatched into a remote region to retrieve a \"flying saucer.\" According to my firsthand source who was a messenger aboard the ship, he heard a task force officer on his return say, \"We got some dead bodies and some managed to get away.\" He also remembers reading a brief item in a San Diego newspaper about a crash in Mexico. Also of pertinence, when I made my initial disclosure about UFO crash/retrievals in my Retrievals of the Third Kind at the 1978 MUFON Symposium in Dayton, Ohio, I was informed circuitously by the CIA several days in advance that it would be inadvisable for me to reveal information about UFO crashes in Mexico and West Germany. Actually, I had no reference of Mexican crashes, but neither the CIA nor anyone else knew what I had tucked into my status report. Looking back, as I learned more about Mexican expeditions, I suspect that the concern focused on illegal entries into that country to recover alien craft. Thus, the alleged Chihuahuan crash in 1974 would have been of significance. See The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome (1980) for reference to the CIA advisement that I should avoid mention of retrievals of UFO crashes in Mexico. Reviewing the text of the report initialed \"JS\" which follows, I find that it is authoritatively written, using correct military terminology and, of note and unlike a hoax, draws a line between so-called \"hard evidence\" and that which is speculative. Research Findings on the Chihuahua Disk Crash - August 25, 1974, initialed by JS. \"On 25 Aug. 74 at 2207 hrs., U.S. Air Defense radar detected an unknown approaching U.S. airspace from the Gulf of Mexico. Originally the object was tracked at 2,200 knots (2,530 mph) on a bearing of 325 degrees and at an altitude of 75,000 feet - a course that would intercept U. S. territory about forty miles southwest of Corpus Christi, Texas. After approximately sixty seconds of observation, at a position 155 miles southeast of Corpus Christi, the object simultaneously decelerated to approximately 1700 knots (1,955 mph), turned to a heading of 290 degrees, and began a slow descent. It entered Mexican airspace approximately forty miles south of Brownsville, Texas. Radar tracked it approximately 500 miles to a point near the town of Coyame in the state of Chihuahua, not far from the U. S. border. There the object suddenly disappeared from the radar screens. During the flight over Mexican airspace, the object leveled off at 45,000 feet and then descended to 20,000 feet. The descent was in level steps, not a smooth curve or straight line, and each level was maintained for approximately five minutes. Tracked On Two Military Radars The object was tracked by two different military radar installations. It would have been within range of Brownsville civilian radar, but it is assumed that no civilian radar detected the object due to a lack of any such reports. The point of disappearance from the radar screens was over a barren and sparsely populated area of northern Mexico. At first it was assumed that the object had descended below the radar's horizon and"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"a watch was kept for any re-emergence of the object. None occurred. At first it was assumed that the object might be a meteor because of the high speed and descending flight path. But meteors normally travel at higher speeds and descend in a smooth arc, not in 'steps.' And meteors do not normally make a thirty-five degree change in course. Shortly after detection, an air defense alert was called. However, before any form of interception could be scrambled, the object turned to a course that would not immediately take it over U. S. territory. The alert was called off within twenty minutes after the object's disappearance from the radar screen. Fifty-two minutes after the disappearance, civilian radio traffic indicated that a civilian aircraft had gone down in that area. But it was clear that the missing aircraft had departed El Paso international with a destination of Mexico City and could not, therefore, have been the object tracked over the Gulf of Mexico. It was noted, however, that they both disappeared in the same area and at the same time. With daylight the next day, Mexican authorities began a search for the missing plane. Approximately 1035 hours, there came a radio report that wreckage from the missing plane had been spotted from the air. Almost immediately came a report of a second plane on the ground a few miles from the first. A few minutes later, an additional report stated that the second 'plane' was circular shaped and apparently in one piece although damaged. A few minutes after that, the Mexican military clamped a radio silence on all search efforts. CIA Monitored Mexican Government UFO Crash Retrieval The radio interceptions were reported through channels to the CIA. Possibly as many as two additional government agencies also received reports, but such has not been confirmed as of this date. The CIA immediately began forming a recovery team. The speed with which this team and its equipment was assembled suggests that this was either a well-rehearsed exercise or one that had been performed prior to the event. In the meantime, requests were initiated at the highest levels between the United States and Mexican governments that the U. S. recovery team be allowed onto Mexican territory to 'assist.' These requests were met with professed ignorance and a flat refusal of any cooperation. By 2100 hrs., 26 Aug. 74, the recovery team had assembled and been staged at Fort Bliss. Several helicopters were flown in from some unknown source and assembled in a secured area. These helicopters were painted a neutral sand color and bore no markings. Eyewitness indicates that there were three smaller craft, very probably UH1 Hueys from the description. There was also a larger helicopter, possibly a Sea Stallion. Personnel from this team remained with their craft and had no contact with other Fort Bliss personnel. Mexican UFO Recovery Team Died - From What? Satellite and reconnaissance aircraft overflight that day indicated that both the crashed disk and the civilian aircraft had been removed from the crash sites and loaded on flat bed trucks. Later flights confirmed that the convoy had departed the area heading south. At that point, the CIA had to make a choice: either to allow this"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"unknown aircraft to stay in the hands of the Mexican government; or to launch the recovery team, supplemented by any required military support and take the craft. There occurred, however, an event that took the choice of of their hands. High altitude overflights indicated that the convoy had stopped before reaching any inhabited areas or major roads. Recon showed no activity and radio contact between the Mexican recovery team and its headquarters had ceased. A low altitude, high speed, overflight was ordered. The photos returned by that aircraft showed all trucks and jeeps stopped, some with open doors, and two human bodies lying on the ground beside two vehicles. The decision was immediately made to launch the recovery team, but the actual launching was held up for the arrival of additional equipment and two additional personnel. It was not until 1438 hrs. that the helicopters departed Fort Bliss. The four helicopters followed the border down towards Presidio and then turned and entered Mexican airspace north of Candelaria. They were over the convoy site at 1653 hrs. All (Mexican) convoy personnel were dead, most within the trucks. CIA Recovery Team Took Over Disk Some (CIA) recovery team members, dressed in bio-protection suits, reconfigured the straps holding the disk object on the flatbed truck, then attached them to a cargo cable from the Sea Stallion (helicopter). By 1714 hrs., the recovered object was on its way to U. S. territory. Before leaving the convoy site, members of the (CIA) recovery team gathered together the Mexican vehicles and bodies and then destroyed all with high explosives. This included the pieces of the civilian light plane which had been involved in the mid-air collision. At 1746 hrs., the Hueys departed. The Hueys caught up with the Sea Stallion as it re-entered U. S. airspace. The recovery team then proceeded to a point in the Davis Mountains, approximately twenty-five miles northeast of Valentine. There they landed and waited until 0225 hrs. the next morning. At that time, they resumed the flight and rendezvoused with a small convoy on a road between Van Horn and Kent. The recovered disk was transferred to a truck large enough to handle it and capable of being sealed totally. Some of the personnel from the Hueys transferred to the convoy. CIA Transported Recovere d Disk from Mexico to Atlanta, Georgia All helicopters then returned to their original bases for decontamination procedures. The convoy continued non-stop, using back roads and smaller highways and staying away from cities. The destination of the convoy reportedly was Atlanta, Georgia. Here the hard evidence thins out. One unconfirmed report says the disk was eventually transferred to Wright-Patterson A. F. Base. Another says that the disk was either transferred after that to another unnamed base, or was taken directly to this unknown base directly from Atlanta. Disk Description The best description of the disk was that it was sixteen feet, five"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"inches in diameter, convex on both upper and lower surfaces to the same degree, possessing no visible doors or windows. The thickness was slightly less than five feet. The color was silver, much like polished steel. There was no visible lights nor any propulsion means. There were no markings. There were two areas of the rim that showed damage, one showing an irregular hole approximately twelve inches in diameter with indented material around it. The other damage was described as a 'dent' about two feet wide. The weight of the object was estimated as approximately one thousand, five hundred pounds (1,500 lbs), based on the effect of the weight on the carrying helicopter and those who transferred it to the truck. There was no indication in the documentation available as to whether anything was visible in the 'hole.' It seems likely that the damage with the hole was caused by the collision with the civilian aircraft. That collision occurred while the object was traveling approximately 1700 knots (1,955 mph). Even ignoring the speed of the civilian aircraft, the impact would have been considerable at that speed. This is in agreement with the description of the civilian aircraft as being 'almost totally destroyed.' What was being taken from the crash site were pieces of the civilian aircraft. The second damage might have resulted when the object impacted with the ground. The speed in that case should have been considerably less than that of the first impact. Disk Occupants? No mention is made of the occupants of the civilian aircraft. It is not know if any body or bodies were recovered. Considering the destruction of the civilian light aircraft in mid-air, bodies might well not have come down near the larger pieces. Unfortunately, what caused the deaths of the Mexican recovery team is not known. Speculation ranges from a chemical released from the disk, as a result of the damage, to a microbiological agent. There are no indications of death or illness by any of the (American) recovery team. It would not have been illogical for the recovery team to have taken one of the bodies back with them for analysis. But there is no indication of that having happened. Perhaps they did not have adequate means of transporting what might have been a biologically contaminated body. Inquiries to the FAA reveal no documents concerning the civilian aircraft crash, probably because it did not involve a U. S. aircraft nor did it occur over U. S. airspace. It should be noted that the above facts do not tell the complete story. Nothing is known of the analysis of the disk craft or its contents. Nothing is known about the deaths associated with the foreign (Mexican) recovery team. Nor is it known if this craft was manned or not. Other questions also remain, such as why would a recovered disk be taken to Atlanta? And where did the disk come from? It was first detected approximately 200 miles from U.S. territory, yet U. S. air defenses extend to a much greater distance than that. If the object descended into the atmosphere, perhaps NORAD space tracking has some record of the object. Alternate possibility is that it entered the Gulf of Mexico under radar limits and then 'jumped' up to 75,000 feet. Considering prior behavior exhibited by disks of this size, it is probable that the entry was from orbital altitude. The facts that are known have been gathered from two eyewitness"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"accounts, documentation illegally copied, and a partially destroyed document. This was done in 1978 by a person who is now dead. Only in February of this year did the notes and documents come into the hands of our group.\" To be continued in Part 10.
