One of the many government documents is entitled UFO Sighting At Rendlesham Forest and begins: \"We are aware that on 27 and 29 December 1980 a number of personnel from RAF (Royal Air Force) Woodbridge saw strange lights in the vicinity of the base, in Rendlesham Forest. \"Lt. Col. Charles Halt USAF, the Deputy Base Commander, submitted a report on these events, which was passed to the Ministry of Defence.\" Christmas week in December 1980 was a tense and confusing time for several dozen men at the joint United States and English Royal Air Force Base at Bentwaters near the southeastern coast of the British Isles. In the early morning hours of December 27 and 29 - and perhaps December 26 as well - odd lights were seen moving in the Rendlesham forest. Various security and military personnel investigated. The joint United States and British Royal Air Force Base at Bentwaters near Woodbridge and the Rendlesham Forest on England's southeastern coast. USAF Lt. Col. Charles I. Halt, Bentwaters Deputy Base Commander, told Staff Sergeant James Penniston, \"The reports will remain confidential and we should treat the incident as Top Secret and not discuss it with anybody.\" Penniston remembered being told there was radiation where the lights had been, a dosage equivalent to \"five or ten x-rays.\" (See Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness for transcript of Jim Penniston's hypnosis session about the "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Rendlesham Forest events, Earthfiles Shop .) On January 13, 1981, Col. Halt wrote a summary of the Rendlesham incident on official U. S. Department of the Air Force letterhead to the Royal Air Force. The subject was labeled \"Unexplained Lights.\" Here is that entire one-page document as released by the MOD on November 29, 2002. This particular document had previously been released in 1983 through the U. S. Freedom of Information Act. January 13, 1981, summary memo written by USAF Lt. Col. Charles I. Halt, Bentwaters Deputy Base Commander, about the Rendlesham forest incident of December 27 - 29, 1980. February 16, 1981, memo by UK Ministry of Defence Senior Leader, J. D. Badcock , that references radar camera recorder and audiotape record \"evidence.\" "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"In the mid-1980s, British UFO researchers Brenda Butler, Jenny Randles, and Dot Street played an audiotape for me and police officer Larry Fawcett (Citizens Against UFO Secrecy, CAUS), recorded by Lt. Col. Halt in the forest. On the tape, the Colonel and other men describe lights as they move through the trees. The implication was that an unidentified and sophisticated technology had come down in Rendlesham forest which could affect national security. Yet, the MOD's dismissal of any national security concern can be found in several documents, including the following excerpt in the page entitled UFO Sighting At Rendlesham Forest : \"No evidence was found of any threat to the defence of the United Kingdom, and no further investigations were carried out. No further information has come to light which alters our view that the sightings of these lights was of no defence significance.\" Capel Green, a Rendlesham Forest field where an oval-shaped area was still discolored in 1988 when former USAF Security Police officer, Larry Warren, returned to photograph where he remembered a craft appeared during the December 1980 events.

British media such as the BBC and Reuters connected the release of the \"Rendlesham File\" to the British Freedom of Information Act (FOI) that began organizing in 2000, but will not be fully operational until 2005. However, today when I talked with a Ministry of Defence FOI employee, she explained the evolution of the Rendlesham File release. Interview: Linda Unwin, Publication Scheme Unit, Directorate of Air Staff, Ministry of Defense, London, England: \" IS THIS THE FIRST RELEASE OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION UNDER THE NEW BRITISH 2000 FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOI)? No, these papers were originally released in May 2001 under our Code of Practice and Access to Government Information which is the forerunner to our Freedom of Information Act 2000. THEN ARE THESE THE FIRST RELEASED PAGES SINCE THE FOI 2000 IN BRITAIN? They weren't actually released under the Freedom of Information Act because that doesn't come into force in the UK until January 2005. These were released under the Code of Practice and Access Government Information and then were added to the FOI Publication Scheme which went live for the first time on our MOD website November 29. WAS THIS THEN A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT INQUIRY IN THE UNITED STATES THAT LEAD TO THE MOD RELEASE? WAS THIS FROM AN AMERICAN INQUIRY?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"No, that has been incorrectly reported. The Halt report you are interested in, that one paper from the Rendlesham file, was requested by someone in America in 1983 through the American government which was unable to find a copy. Your government asked the UK if we held a copy of it. It was then supplied by us to your government, who released it through your Freedom of Information Act. So, the Halt report was released in 1983 under the U. S. Freedom of Information Act. The whole Rendlesham file was not released until May 2001 in this country as a result of a request under the Code of Practice. And now it is widely available because it is on the internet. SINCE 2001, IT REALLY HASN'T BEEN PUBLICIZED. No, not the whole file. IS THE ENTIRE RENDLESHAM FILE RELEASED IN THE 180 PAGES? OR ARE SOME STILL RESTRICTED? No. That's the entire Rendlesham file.\" Unexplained Aerial Phenomenon In March 1984, Britain's Sir Patrick Wall asked the Secretary of State for Defence how many people had reported alleged landings by unidentified flying objects between 1980 and 1983. The MOD's answer was that its files did not separate out a category of alleged landings, but its numbers of reports of unidentified flying objects were 350, 600, 250 and 390 - more than fifteen hundred in four years.
