He had another doctor confirm it and told us: 'This horse has been mutilated and we cannot save her.'\" - Guy Elford, Calgary, Alberta Resident Calgary, Alberta, Canada where law enforcement has had a dozen horse slashing reports since 1980. May 11, 2001 Calgary, Alberta, Canada - The Canadian Calgary Herald newspaper recently headlined, \"Police say horse mutilations likely work of sexual deviate: Investigators examine links in equine attacks.\" Calgary law enforcement confirm two horse slashings on April 9 and another eight months before on the Guy and Christine Elford residence. A fourth attack killed Tammy Hambrook's pet horse in 1999. Over the past twenty years, there have been at least a dozen similar equine attacks in the Spy Hill of Calgary. Yet, despite the suspicions that a sexual predator is on the loose, no person has ever been arrested and arraigned on a horse slashing charge. Hundreds of other horse slashings and deaths have been reported in Europe since the early 1990s. In Sweden more than 200 horses and cattle had been slashed by 1992. No arrests were made. Britain's Hampshire and Buckinghamshire Counties in 1992 suffered attacks on thirty horses, including ones whose \"genitals had been shocked with electricity. Other stallions and geldings have been rectally assaulted, flogged and stabbed.\" The front page of the Leicester Mercury on August 13, 1993 in Leicester, England headlined: \"Thugs launch callous attack on pet horse.\" A mare which had given birth to a foal three months before was found with six puncture wounds on her neck. An 8-year-old gelding at the same farm was hit on his nose. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Front Page, Leicester Mercury , August 13, 1993, Leicester, England. Interview: Guy Elford, Medical Equipment Salesman, Calgary, Alberta, Canada: \"There were two horses that were mutilated and killed at our place on April 9. Around 5 o'clock in the afternoon, we were going on an evening trip to the pasture to check the horses. We had our tack with us and were preparing to ride. We had our whole family there, my wife, Christine, and our six children. We came up over the rise and found our 2 1/2- year-old, Gypsy, standing but looking very distressed, her head hanging low. Also across from her in the trees was our 25-year-old mare named April. She was laying down in the trees. That was very unusual. Half of the family went to one horse and half went to the other. We did a quick assessment and found that both had generally the same symptoms: fast heart rate, distress, respiration rate really high. We had seen both horses in fine shape at 7 o'clock Sunday night (April 8), so this was less than 24 hours later. We immediately called the vet and she arrived in twenty minutes. Meanwhile, I was trying to get April out of the trees with the truck, rope and chains because we had to drag her out. Took about forty minutes to pull her out. Meanwhile, the vet had showed up and started to treat Gypsy with pain killers and things like that to try to stabilize the animal. Once that was done, we managed to get April out on to the hill. Then we dragged her up the hill into the sunshine and she expired on the spot. We couldn't stop it. We couldn't save her. It was very difficult for the children. It was their favorite horse. We had a couple of minutes to say goodbye and then immediately turned our attention back to the other horse. It took all our resources to build a shelter around our vehicle so Gypsy would not die of shock. WERE THERE ANY SIGNS OF SLASHINGS OR EXCISIONS ON THE HORSE APRIL THAT DIED? Basically, the mutilation that was done was internal. The intestine in her lower colon was shredded. WHEN THE VET DID A NECROPSY, DID SHE DO IT IN THE FIELD RIGHT THERE OR TO THE VET OFFICE? The one, April, who expired, we just left. The vet didn't examine her at the time because she was already dead. The other one, Gypsy, she expected would probably stabilize and she didn't really know what the problem was. They had similar symptoms. She thought it might be a poisoning, they had eaten something. Or some sort of sickness. So we tried to keep Gypsy through the night. She never got better. We brought her home to the house because the wind and the snow were bad that night. Then first light we headed out to the large veterinarian hospital, different from the first vet. And we were there as soon as they opened and they took her in immediately because she was in peril. The vet couldn't figure out what to do to get her stabilized. He couldn't. We were having to hold the horse up and she was starting to panic. Then the vet did some internal exams. The vet said there was a 10-inch hole in her digestive tract about 10 inches inside her rectum. He had"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"another doctor confirm it and told us: 'This horse has been mutilated and we cannot save her.' Immediately we took Gypsy out of the squeeze she was in because she was panicking and collapsing and we had to put her down right on the spot before she panicked and really hurt herself. After she was put down, the doctor said, 'Did you know she was pregnant?' We told him we were not sure. He said she had last year's foal and was going to deliver in July. So that was kind of a double hit for us. It was only the Thursday before that (April 5), that our 25-year-old gelding we had put down voluntarily because he had been mutilated about eight months earlier and he never recovered from his wounds. He was no longer comfortable and unable to heal himself. IN APPROXIMATELY AN 8 MONTH PERIOD, YOU HAVE LOST THREE ADULT HORSES AND THE UNBORN FOAL. That's correct. WAS ANY NECROPSY DONE ON APRIL? Not at first, but after Gypsy died at the hospital that vet called the police and told them there was a serious problem. He also called the other vet from the evening before and found out the symptoms were probably similar. Then the police seized the remains of both animals and we had to have them transported to the forensic lab for the police so they could do their testing. We found out that April had died of the identical intestinal wound. WHAT WERE THE DETAILS OF THE INTERNAL WOUNDS? I'm actually not permitted to release that information to the media being that the ongoing investigation requires that information regarding specific details be withheld before charges are made. BUT IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT SOME SECTION OF THE INTESTINE WAS REMOVED FROM BOTH HORSES? Not removed, just simply destroyed, obliterated. WHEN YOU SAY OBLITERATED, DO YOU MEAN BY SOMETHING LIKE LASER HEAT? No, by some sort of object. We're not sure what it was. PERFORATING THE INTESTINAL WALL? Yes, in both animals. Both succumbed to peritoneal shock. WERE THERE ANY OTHER ORGANS THAT HAD BEEN EFFECTED? No, nothing. IN BOTH HORSES, THIS WAS THE ONLY AREA ON THEM THAT WAS AFFECTED? That's correct. ANY SPECULATION BY VETS OR POLICE ABOUT WHAT KIND OF OBJECT COULD HAVE DONE THIS? They were looking for something metal and long. That's all they would release to us, a bar of some sort, or crow bar. WAS THE SAME SYMPTOM IN THE HORSE THAT HAD BEEN HURT 8 MONTHS AGO? No, not exactly. He was male and slashed with a knife repeatedly on his genitalia as well as he had punctures in his anus, eight or nine 8-inch punctures. Something like a screwdriver type of thing. PUNCTURES IN THE RECTAL AREA AND THEN ON THE SCROTUM AND PENIS THERE WERE ACTUAL SLASH MARKS? Yes, on the sheath. His sheath was not repairable. So we basically had to deal with him as he was and get him to heal up as best we could and deal with the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"restrictions that he had. HAVE THE POLICE TOLD YOU WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE A SIMILAR PATTERN IN OTHER ANIMALS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS? They said they have had a dozen mutilations in the past twenty years and those varied from animals that were assaulted in a similar fashion as well as animals that were disemboweled whereas ours were not. THE HORSE SLASHING PHENOMENON HAS BEEN REPORTED FROM THE NETHERLANDS THROUGH GERMANY AND OTHER PARTS OF EUROPE OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS. That's correct. We've heard a little bit about that from forensic psychologists that there is a profile of certain people and unfortunately there is more than one person at work, even in our area. These individuals are particularly dangerous because the psychological profile on people like the Jeffrey Dahmers, the very sick serial rapists and murderers, have 100% of the time, according to the psychological profiles, always practiced on animals - not necessarily horses, but always on animals. I think this is what the police have such a great concern about - that whoever it is could graduate from animals to humans with this last event of two animals at once that were assaulted. THE WORLDWIDE NATURE OF THE HORSE SLASHINGS AND ANIMAL MUTILATIONS AROUND THE WORLD FOR THE PAST 30-40 YEARS HAS INVOLVED PATHOLOGISTS THAT HAVE STUDIED TISSUE AFFECTED BY HIGH HEAT. DID THE VETERINARIAN INDICATE THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN THE PERFORATION IN THE INTESTINE IN EVIDENCE OF HIGH HEAT? No. But all the test results aren't back yet from the lab. IS THE LAB IN THE ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE? It's a part of Agriculture Canada, a forensics lab that works in conjunction with the RCMP, yeah. ARE YOU IN A VERY RURAL AREA? We aren't. We're within the city limits of Calgary which is almost a million people. We're right on the outskirts of town, but within the city limits. Interestingly enough, there were houses within 300 yards in virtually every direction. And there is a major highway and major intersection. It's amazing that no one saw this person walking or leave a vehicle. They figure the person walked in and had very well planned out this attack on our two horses. THAT IT HAD TO HAVE OCCURRED BETWEEN SUNDAY NIGHT, APRIL 8, AND WHEN YOU FOUND BOTH HORSES AT AROUND 5 O'CLOCK ON APRIL 9? Yes, but the police also believe that according to profiles, it was a daylight attack. So it would either be early morning or afternoon. But even if it had been that night, it was clear with a full moon so there was sufficient light. There was snow on the ground, so there would have been no problem seeing. WITH SNOW ON THE GROUND, DID THEY FIND ANY UNUSUAL FOOTPRINTS OR TRACKS? By the time we had got in there with my wife, myself and six children trying to deal with both animals, we had obliterated everything. DID YOU TALK WITH THE NEIGHBORS IN THOSE HOUSES AROUND TO SEE IF THEY HAD SEEN OR HEARD ANYTHING UNUSUAL THAT NIGHT OF APRIL 8 TO 9? We worked with the police who were exceptional for city police. They were quite appalled at this and we have one constable Johnston who has been outstanding. His outrage has helped to fuel a lot of the inquiry and he had gone and canvassed several of the buildings that had been built within 200 or 300 yards. And my wife and I canvassed homes on the ridge to see if anyone had seen anyone walk through that day."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"WAS THERE ANY POSITIVE RESPONSE? No, we didn't have any responses directly to us, but we have heard that the Crime Stopper phone line had 100 calls giving tips. NO NEIGHBOR HAS TALKED TO YOU DIRECTLY ABOUT SEEING OR HEARING ANYTHING UNUSUAL? No, no one. HAS ANYONE RAISED THE ISSUE WITH YOU ABOUT ODD LIGHT PHENOMENA ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER UNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHS IN THE WORLD? We've had a few people calling us that were giving us suggestions to check out UFOs or look for the occult. But what we can gather from the police, there was no involvement of the occult. But they think it's humans.\" More Information: \"WHO WOULD YOU LIKE THE PUBLIC TO GET IN TOUCH WITH IF THEY HAVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HORSES IN CALGARY? If people could call the Calgary Police at 403-266-1234. You can ask for the Crime Stoppers line. They will put you directly through to one of the people who takes tips for that. There is a detective Keown who is in charge of this particular investigation.\" Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
