Crop Formations, Two Mysterious Grass Circles in Mission, Kansas © 2007 by Linda Moulton Howe \" S omething has really knocked the heck out of the energy in the larger circle – and somewhat in the smaller circle.\" - W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist M onday, May 21, 2007, around 4 PM local time in Mission, Kansas, (suburb of Kansas City, Kansas), homeowner James Gravatt discovered two circles swirled in the high native grass of his unmowed front yard. Photograph © 2007 by James Gravatt. June 5, 2007, Earthfiles viewer's comment on the Mission, Kansas, grass circles: \"I grew up in Kansas west of Kansas City near I-70 mile marker 290. Living in the country and working on my family's farm, I have witnessed many (probably twenty or more) circles that look like the Mission, KS circles. These circles are different than an area where animals have slept in tall grass. The circles we experienced varied greatly in size from a few feet across to as large as 30ft across and all seem to form a rotational pattern. They would sometimes appear overnight in hay meadows where we were baling the prairie grass or in our yard. These circles were not ignored and there were many theories as to what made them. \"The 'old-timers' would say that the circles were on top of Indian burial sites, but could not offer any explanation as to why or how they were made. In my youth I had a few experiences with ORBS. It was my conclusion that the orbs could have been responsible for these perfect circles in the grass. That is still my conclusion. I have watched for your analysis of these events over the years and still have not read, seen or heard a plausible explanation that persuades me to accept any other means than these ORBS. How about expaining them? There is NO DOUBT that these things exist as I have personally experienced them, so, I will patiently wait until science can explain them in a manner that all humans can understand and accept. \"Keep up the fantastic work - Steve\" Return to Part 1 June 5, 2007 Mission, Kansas, near Kansas City, Kansas - On Monday afternoon, May 21, 2007, James Gravatt went out to mow his 24-inch-high field grass front yard. The reason the grass was so high was he had not been home to mow it. His father, a retired Marine who had served 25 years in a Marine Aircraft wing, had heart bypass surgery. For "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"weeks, James had been at the hospital and then helping his father recover. Meanwhile, the city of Mission had issued James an order to mow his grass or face a stiff fine. James had worked for years as a paralegal and then graduated summa cum laude from a local college with a B. A. in business administration. Today, he is a supervisor in a large UPS hub in Kansas City, Kansas, where the Kansas River merges with the Missouri River. Mission is a suburb of Kansas City in Johnson County, about 8 miles south. The town was named after the Shawnee Indian Mission, only two miles away from the neighborhood in which James Gravatt lives on the highest hill in the region. Shawnee Indians, along with many other eastern tribes, were moved from the East to the Kansas region in the 1820s and 1830s. A little south of where Kansas City, Kansas, is today, the Shawnee Indian Mission was first constructed in 1839 and functioned as a school for children of mainly the Shawnee and Delaware Indian tribes. The Mission also served as an early territorial capitol, a supply point on the Santa Fe and Oregon Trails and a camp for Union soldiers during the Civil War. G reen circle marks modern day Mission, Kansas, a suburb south of Kansas City, Kansas. Mission is where the original Shawnee Indian Mission was built in 1839 as a school for Shawnee and Delaware Indian tribe children. T hirteen stars in Shawnee Tribe flag. James Gravatt asked Chief Jim Oyler, Chief of the United Tribe of Shawnee Indians, about his Mission neighborhood where the two grass circles appeared. Chief Oyler said that \"the geographical location on which I sit has been inhabited by the Shawnee, Kaw, Kiowa and possibly Pawnee Indian tribes. The government has for the most part wiped out all records of burial grounds, and has not been helpful in relocating them. Most have been built on and covered up. There are a few cemeteries left in scattered areas. I asked if he would believe, with his knowledge of Native American history that my property might have been a burial ground. He said possibly, but more likely because of the elevation it was used as a lookout post, camp sight and signaling location. Jim said some information regarding burial grounds might be found in some of the various tribal treaties.\" There are several treaties with the Shawnee dating back to the 1700's that can be read on Chief Oyler's website: http://home.kc.rr.com/utosi/ Further west outside Salina, Kansas, there is an ancient Indian burial pit. The Kansas State Historical Society has an old text about the burial site which states: \"Several hundred years ago, perhaps more than a thousand, this valley was inhabited by men whose average height was probably well over six feet. These were not the Indians of Quivira, whose '7-foot-warriors' Coronado described in 1541, but an even earlier people. Here they lived in earth lodges, tilling the soil, hunting and fishing, and here they left records of unusual archaeological"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"importance. \"One mile southeast of this marker is a burial pit containing more than 140 skeletal remains that demonstrate the remarkable size and strength of these prehistoric Indians. The pit was discovered in 1936. It has been scientifically excavated, with the skeletons still preserved in the same flexed positions of their burial centuries ago. Among the objects found in the pit are pieces of pottery, a grinding stone, parched corn and beans. A stone tomahawk, ceremonial flint knives, and clamshell beads and ear pendants.\" On May 21, 2007, James Gravatt sent me an email with an image attached of the two circles he was surprised to find that afternoon. Both circles were swirled counterclockwise. The larger was eight feet in diameter and the smaller was 6.5 feet in diameter. \"Dear Linda, I have listened to you on Art Bell and Coast to Coast for many years, and appreciate your work. I live in a suburb of Kansas City near the Plaza. Today before mowing the lawn, I was walking through it looking for pieces of branches. I stopped dead in my tracks when I saw these circles. (Facing tree and house) The one on the left measures 105 inches in diameter, and the one on the right is 72 inches. They are pinwheel shaped and both are counter-clockwise. I have seen where deer lay before, but these circles are too big. They are under a large old tree and I can't see how they are weather-related circles. I'm stumped. Do you have any idea what could cause this? Feel free to contact me by phone if you prefer. Best regards and Thank you. James Gravatt Mission, KS (phone number)\" I talked with James Gravatt by phone about what happened and he agreed to collect grass and soil samples. I had them Fed Exed to biophysicist W. C. Levengood in Michigan for study. Not only were there biochemical and biophysical changes in the circle grass compared to normal controls - especially the larger of the two circles - but he also found an anomalously high distribution of very small magnetite particles in the larger circle. Interviews: James Gravatt, Supervisor, Kansas City UPS Hub, and Resident, Mission, Kansas: “On May 21, 2007, pretty close to 4 PM, I was beginning to mow my yard, which I had not done for some time because my Dad had heart bypass surgery in a local hospital and I spent a lot of time basically either working or at the hospital and I had a mowing order, as embarrassing as it is to say. My grass had grown 2 feet or more tall in a residential neighborhood. My home was built in about 1950. I went out to pick up small branches underneath the tree (Red Ash) – no big limbs had fallen – in order to mow under the tree. As I walked down the slope of my front yard, I stopped in my tracks. I saw two circles that had been laid down in a vortex of a spiral shape going counter clockwise, both of them. It literally took my breath away for just a moment. I’ve been a hunter and spent a lot of times outdoors. An animal lying down was the first thing that came to mind. But when I looked at the circles closer, I realized they were too large and were not stomped down. I’ve got a black Labrador retriever. She’s very skilled at tracking rabbits and whatever might run across the lawn. If I see one run across the lawn, two hours later, I can let her go out and she will tr ace where that rabbit went. So, I brought this dog out and called her to the circles and she showed no interest in them at all. She didn’t really sniff the ground. I did look closely for any fecal matter, which is common if it were a deer or something like that which laid down. And there was none. The grass and the stems were not bent or broken and they were not brown or discolored. And there were no indentations in the ground as if something had been set or laid on them. The second thought I had was perhaps from some utility construction truck that might have set utility cable spools in my yard. But I’ve seen that done, too, and I know if you set something heavy on grass, the grass lays flat and is damaged."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"These two circles are about 10 feet up from the curb of the street, which is a bit of a ways for someone to just set cable spools up there anyway. Besides that, this is a neighborhood where the city wouldn’t do that anyway because the neighbors would just scream.

Measuring Circles M easuring tape laid across diameter of larger native grass circle, 105 inches. Measurements and photograph © 2007 by James Gravatt. I did not step into the circles. But I got a tape measure and measured them. The smaller circle measured 72 inches (6 feet) in diameter and the larger was 105 inches (8.5 feet) in diameter. WHAT KIND OF GRASS? A native grass probably planted here in 1950 by the original owner or developer. It’s almost like field grass. It’s not Kentucky-blue-grass-type lawn. And none of the tree branches hang low to the ground, because I did think about the possibility of the branches being down and the wind making the swirling. But physically, that's not possible because the branches don't reach the ground. DID YOU SEE ANY TRACKS LEADING FROM THE SIDEWALK OVER THE TEN FEET OF GRASS TO THE CIRCLES? No, nothing. SO, FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW, THESE ARE TWO CIRCLES, 6 AND 8.5 FEET IN DIAMETER, THAT ARE SUDDENLY THERE ON MAY 21, 2007, AROUND 4 PM BENEATH YOUR TREE IN YOUR FRONT YARD AND WERE NOT THERE THE DAY BEFORE? No, they had not been there. You could not see them from a car on the street, but I go outside and I would have seen these circles before May 21, if they had been there. I think"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"they occurred within the last 8 hours, or last 24 hours. SO, IF YOU STARTED MOWING AT 4 PM ON MAY 21, YOU THINK THE CIRCLES WERE MADE AROUND 9 AM OR EARLIER THAT DAY? It could have been at night. When I leave for work, I am generally out the door and into the car and in a hurry and I might not have noticed them early that morning of May 21st. Tornadoes? WHAT WAS THE WEATHER LIKE THEN? Clear. Sunny. AND HAD BEEN THE DAY BEFORE ON MAY 20TH? Ye s . IS THERE ANYTHING IN YOUR LIFE THAT COMES TO MIND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE TWO CIRCLES AND WONDER WHY THEY WERE PUT IN YOUR FRONT YARD? (laughs) I live in Kansas and we have tornadoes. That came to mind. But the circles are under a tree and I know tornadoes, dirt devils, whirlwinds and they move across flat ground. But for something to form two perfect circles such as these that close together, no – I’ve seen a lot of things, but I’ve never seen anything like this. Shawnee Indian Mission Nearby I went out front and lined up the bigger circle to the smaller and stared right at Kansas City, Missouri. I then used Google Earth to pinpoint and draw a line from the direction of my street - which is the approximate direction of the circles, with a slight northern correction - to Kansas City. From my house to Kansas City, it is a straight line when the larger circle is the base and the smaller circle is the point, like an arrow. Passing over this line is the site of the Shawnee Indian Mission, from which Mission, Kansas, got it's name. The Shawnee Mission used to cover many acres. Biophysicists W. C. Levengood's Grass and Soil Analyses W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist, Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory, Grass Lake, Michigan: “These two grass circles are a different formation. I’ve never had one exactly like this. It shows an energy causing damage to the plants in which the internal energy (of Charge Density Plasmas, CDP) is just dropping like crazy. [ W. C. Levengood's definition: \"Charge Density Plasmas, CDP, are microscopic plasmas. A plasma is a liquid or a gas that is highly ionized and organizes itself into a very specific system with a very special kind of energy. I use a system where by I can look at a fresh specific-sized sample of plant tissue, so I can measure the internal energy generated by the plant.\"] What I did was compare the internal energy in the control grass with the internal energies of all the sampled grass James Gravatt collected from the small and larger circles. The small circle was + 9% greater than the controls. That’s not statistically significant. But in the large circle, the CDP was 73% lower than in the controls. I haven’t seen this before. In contrast, the normal controls grasses were exactly what I would expect in my CDP test. Then when I did a dissipation analysis of respiration in the cell mitochondria, the small circle was 45% lower in the rate constant than the controls. In the larger circle, it was 76% smaller. Not at all like the normal control grass! Further, when I applied a logarithmic algorithm that fits normal plants, I found the mean in the control grass samples was .99. Controls always fit right on at .99, which is practically a perfect correlation, so the controls to the two grass circles were very normal. In comparison to the circle correlation coefficients, the small circle was .90. And in the large"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"circle, it was .57, very little correlation at all. Something has really knocked the heck out of the energy in the larger circle – and somewhat in the smaller circle. WHY DO YOU THINK THE LARGER CIRCLE WOULD BE KNOCKED DOWN IN ENERGY SO MUCH? Microwaves in Complex Spinning Plasma Vortices It’s turbulence within the energy vortices and in this case, I would say it is microwave energies that are the culprit. (Biophysicist Levengood's hypothesis is that spinning plasma vortices come down from high in the atmosphere with microwave energies and positively and negatively charged ions. The spinning complex energies interact with plants to form crop formations.) This follows what I’ve seen before in crop formations, but here the two circles are in grass. Magnetite Particles in Larger Grass Circle Soil I had unexpected results with the soil. I did the magnetic drags and there was some magnetite there. The results tied right in with what I saw in the energy of the circle plants. The amount of magnetic drag material in the soil was very small - I think it’s one of the smallest I’ve seen so far. But there turned out to be significant differences. The controls had 0.2 milligrams per gram of soil, which is a little below the expected level in normal soil – .4 milligrams per gram. So, the Mission, Kansas, controls are about in that range. The small circle samples averaged together had 0.212, which was not significant. But the large circle had 0.764. THAT WOULD BE THREE TIMES WHAT YOU FOUND IN THE CONTROL SOIL? Yes, a little over. Then I did a microscopic examination and the particles were exactly what I expected, the bright, shiny particles. But the size was tremendously small! In other words, these showed up as little scintillations on the surface of the soil particles when I used reflected light. They were very profuse, but extremely small. The upper size limit on any particle I found was 21 microns (human blood cell is 7 microns in diameter). I would say the vast majority was in the range of 1 to 5 microns and some in 12 microns. SO THIS WAS LIKE THE PARTICL ES W ERE SP RAY PAINTE D ON THE LARGER CIRCLE? Something like that, yeah. That’s a good analogy. But it’s electrostatic, not melted. The smaller particle distribution might be related to the less intense energies involved in making the two grass circles. The grass was not knocked down flat. It was gently swirled. Again, I think the energy involved in the \"spray\" of very small magnetite particles in the larger circle is microwave energy, which also impacted most on the larger circle grass. Fundamental Biophysical and Biochemical Changes in Mission, Kansas, Grass Circles In the Mission, Kansas, grass circles we are seeing vortex action that has a pretty potent microwave component that lowered the energy in the grass of the larger circle. So this is not like the typical crop formations where you see the highest energy often affecting the plants in the smallest circles, what the British call 'grape shots.' It’s just the opposite here. The small circle had very little energy and very little magnetic material. WHY DO YOU THINK THAT OCCURRED IN THE MISSION CIRCLES? I don’t know why the smaller of the two circles would be so unaffected, while the larger circle’s grass respiration was so depleted. But I think the mechanism was entirely different than the ones we have found in English grape shot. There the energy has been far more"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"controlled and partitioned. Here in Mission, Kansas, there were just a couple of vortices that gently swirled the grass down. I’m eager to see what the re-growth looks like in this grass. The larger circle area could begin to show up a different color in the grass and eventually might even go brown.\" C ontinued in Part 3 - Wheat Pictogram in Madisonville, Tennessee Return to Part 1 - U.
