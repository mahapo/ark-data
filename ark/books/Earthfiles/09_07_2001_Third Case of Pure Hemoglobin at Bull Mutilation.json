Photograph © 2000 by Fern Belzil. September 7, 2001 St. Paul, Alberta, Canada - Rancher Fern Belzil of St. Paul has been investigating unusual cattle mutilations in Alberta for the past several years. On October 16, 2000, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police called him about the eerie death of a 2200-pound bull found at the Saddle Lake Indian Reserve on October 12 about fifteen miles southwest of St. Paul in a rural area called St. Brides. The bull was a seven year old Semmental, a robust blood line from Europe, owned by rancher Marshall Kiziak. In addition to the dry, bloodless \"cookie cutter\" excision of the scrotum, the ear had been cut off, the tongue was excised from deep within the throat and a circle of hide had been removed from around the rectal area. Oddly, the penis had been stretched out of the abdomen towards the rear legs and three of the bull's four small nipples had been excised, leaving a triangular pattern of small red marks near the penis. Penis stretched from abdomen towards legs through excised hide. Red marks in triangular pattern are three of four small nipples removed from the bull. Photograph © 2000 by Fern Belzil.

Biophysicist W. C. Levengood of Grass Lake, Michigan had asked Fern to collect grass and soil samples for study from the mutilation site. Recently, the findings were released in a report by Levengood and analytical chemist, Phyllis Budinger, confirming the third case of pure, dried hemoglobin at an animal mutilation. Interviews: Fern Belzil, Rancher and Animal Mutilation Investigator, St. Paul, Alberta, Canada: \"As I looked around and took pictures, I found two spots of blood. One was 5 feet north of the animal, just a little bit of blood on the grass. And I found another little spot on grass about 15 feet away in the same direction from the animal. There were a few willows in between that, but it was on the grass. And then I found these blood spots splattered on the willows just a few inches from the animal. The blood spots were about 4 to 15 inches up on the branches of the trees. I had never come across a case like this where blood was splattered on the trees or ground like that. So I took samples of the bark and carefully packaged it and sent it to Dr. Levengood. Willows a few inches from bull's rear that were spattered with blood drops. Photograph © 2000 by Fern Belzil. Do you think the hemoglobin discovery indicates that whatever technology is being applied to these animals that perhaps the animals are removed from the pasture to have tissue excised and then are returned for some unknown reason? Well, there are some cases where we think these animals are being picked up and brought to whatever a ship, UFO, or? where Someone does their thing and then drops the animals back down again.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Scientific Analysis Biophysicist W. C. Levengood has been analyzing plants and soil from both mysterious worldwide crop formations and what he calls \"bovine excision sites\" since the mid-1990s. He has published studies in the respected botany journal, Physiologia Plantarum , that show biochemical and biophysical changes in some crop formations that indicate \"a spinning plasma vortex with microwave and other energies\" have interacted with the plants and soil. He does not know the source of the spinning plasma vortex, but he finds the same changes at some animal mutilation sites. In his August 8, 2001 report, \"Bovine Excision: Alberta, Canada 2000,\" biophysicist Levengood writes: \"This is the third discovery of pure hemoglobin at a bovine excision site. In the Canadian sample discussed here, the hemoglobin was found adhering to grass and on the ba rk of willow bran ches. ...The purity of the hemoglobin was confirmed by an infrared spectral analysis conducted by Ms. Phyllis A. Budinger at her laboratory in Ohio.\" Analytical chemist Phyllis Budinger showed in her report how closely the blood spots collected from the grass and willows near the mutilated Canada bull match the 1997 California bull and the 2001 Alabama mutilated cow discussed in Earthfiles.com on July 28, 2001. Red line is the October 12, 2001 Alberta bull hemoglobin residue; green is the 1997 California bull hemoglobin residue; black is a whole boine blood reference; and blue is pure bovine hemoglobin used as a control for comparison. Further, chemist Budinger noticed in her spectrum analysis that there were \"missing bands and less absorption compared to that of the whole blood. This shows other whole blood components are missing; e.g., lipids and other unidentified constituents. This is indication that a separation of the blood components has occurred.\" W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist, Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory, Grass Lake, Michigan: \"There are two implications: one is that this is being used by some one, by some other dimensional beings or maybe in our own environment. I don't know. I don't know anyone who could this type of removal of the hemoglobin out in the middle of a pasture. But be that as it may, someone wants this material and is going to the trouble of removing it entirely from the blood, it looks like. I don't know that for sure, but certainly the indications are that they remove it totally. The other implication is that we had better more completely understand the relationship of the energies involved and what the mutilators are doing in our"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"environment because they are presenting us with some real puzzles and enigmas here. The fact that this pure hemoglobin has been found on mutilated animals in California (1997), Alabama (2001) and Canada (2001) - those are extremely separated geographic regions. That is true and I would expect it's probably more pervasive geographically and in amount than what we've found so far in our sampling. I believe the blood is not removed. I think it is totally disintegrated. I mean if they can do what they do with hemoglobin - put it in this dry, compact solid form and yet keep it chemically reactive - then they probably can disintegrate the rest of the components of the blood. (Also implied in analytical chemist Phyllis Budinger's laboratory report discussed above.) One medical laser researcher suggested it was hypothetically possible at a molecular level to remove specific tissue molecules by an advanced technology that humans do not yet have. But he expects that in the future surgeries on humans and animals could be accomplished by molecule- specific technologies. If you had that, you could focus something on an animal and remove just the hemoglobin or blood liquid and nothing else. That's very possible. We might be seeing the residue of such a technology on these animals in Canada, Alabama and California. That's true and I would like to see some sophisticated mass spectroscopy done where the isotopic ratios are measured in some of these - not just the hemoglobin which would be extremely interesting - but some of the grasses around the animal. I would like to see where I have found respiration differences, I would like to see if the isotopic ratios in the plants have been changed.\" More Information: Other Two Hemoglobin Confirmation Reports Earthfiles 07/28/01 and Earthfiles 10/15/00 Biophysicist Levengood welcomes help from other scientists and can be reached at: W.
