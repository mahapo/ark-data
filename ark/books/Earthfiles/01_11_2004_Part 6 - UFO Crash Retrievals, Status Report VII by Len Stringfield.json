Here begins Part 6 of Status Report VII, from February 1994. The first section of Part 6, \"Words on a Window Frame,\" was submitted by Sheila Franklin to Len Stringfield on December 9, 1993, concerning the investigation of Professor Edith Simpson. Words on a Window Frame: A Whimsy or a Warning? Investigator Sheila Franklin: \"On November 23, 1993, I had my last phone conversation with Professor Simpson. It was not satisfactory to me. She had a litany of problems that led to excuses as to why she could not provide 'copies' of the photos we requested. The problems she enumerated were so many and so burdensome that it seemed more than one sixtyish woman alone could bear. At the end of our lengthy conversations, she did what she always had done. She promised our satisfaction, but sometime way down the line. After all of the months of dealing with her, I did not expect anything more of her. Little did I anticipate that I had a surprise on the way. On November 24, 1993, after I had completed an early morning tennis match, I went to answer the phone in my den. As I was seated at my desk, I turned to the windows that faced directly out at the ocean. The windows are modern awning-type that have metal frames. They encompass three windows together each with four panes that open in an awning-type fashion. In the center window on the center metal frame, I thought I saw some kind of writing. I went to the window and could not believe my eyes. There, deeply etched into the metal, were the words - COME HOME MY LOVE - and what looked like the initials O. H. I was shocked. I tried to rub the words out, but they wouldn't erase. They were engraved into the metal. I look out of the window every day that I am home. It is my favorite window to stand in front of, since it has the best view. I have lived in the apartment for thirteen years and never saw this writing before and it would be hard to miss! I check out the weather there every day, especially the days that I am playing tennis. Why and who would do this? How and when did they get into my home? My first thought was to check with the cleaning person, Yvonne, who worked for my condo and also cleaned my apartment and windows every two weeks. She has been doing that for eight years and is absolutely trustworthy. I wanted to know if she had ever seen this before. She had just washed the windows five days prior. She said that she had never seen the writing before. I then beeped my friend, Don, who had remodeled my apartment nine months prior and knew every inch of the place. I had him inspect the engraving and he, too, said that he had never seen that before and would have noticed! The fact that there was no evidence of a breaking or entering really bothered me. There also was nothing missing or out of place. That meant to me that the intention was not criminal, even though the act was. How "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"did the person or persons get into my apartment? The only people who had keys besides myself are my mother and Yvonne. I live in a building that has 24-hour security guards at the main entrance, but for the days from November 22-24, 1993, the service entrance was fully open and unlocked, due to the laying of hallway carpeting in the building. It would be quite easy for someone/s to slip into the building and ride the elevator to my 10th floor apartment completely unnoticed. What I found most ominous was the message engraved into the window frame - COME HOME MY LOVE. It certainly sounded chummy, kind of like an unrequited lover or a languishing one. To my knowledge, there is no one in my life that fits that stereotype. Romance has not been my focus, since I got involved in UFOl ogy. The logical progression then is to assume that this is linked to the case of Professor Simpson. I am sure that the verbiage used in the message was meant to be construed by the non-cognoscenti as innocuous, nebulous and shoulder-shrugging. If it was threatening, it would be more damning to the agent/s involved and lend credence to the illegal entering of my home. I decided to make a police report on this, even though I knew that it would be considered a non-event to them, as there was no real evidence of a crime, other than my say-so. The police officer took the information and it was stated on the police report as a 'Miscellaneous Incident.' The officer said that in over 22 years of his time on the force in the area, it was the first time he had ever been to my building for any kind of an incident. I agreed with him that in the 13 years that I lived in the building, there had never been a burglary by an unknown individual. An important postscript to this relates to possible phone surveillance on others who are connected to me. After this event, I decided to phone my good friend, confidante and private investigator, Andy. When I told Andy what had transpired, he thought it quite bizarre, even for agents. He also mentioned that he had been having anomalous drops on his phone lines. He would lose phone calls in mid-conversation. His contact within the phone company could not understand where this draw on the line was coming from, even though it appeared that the phone computer room tap was off his line. Now, two weeks have passed. Andy states that he and his wife have tried to phone me from their home and cannot get my phone. He said that a recorded phone message comes on saying that my phone does not accept incoming messages, or there is a continual busy signal, despite the fact that I have call-waiting. No other people have indicated the same problem with my phone. Concurrently with Andy's phone problems, my friend, Don, who I had beeped initially about the engraving, also had immediate problems with his phone. He could not get any calls out and only one call in on his phone. He was very upset since it included Thanksgiving Day, when he wanted to phone his family. When he checked with the phone company, no reason for the problem was given. The service interruption disappeared after two days. My conclusion to this event of very high strangeness is that there is no doubt someone/s unknown illegally entered my home and defaced my property with the intent to intimidate me. The synchronicity time-wise, it appears, relates to the completed case of Professor Simpson. Why 'they' waited for completion is questionable. Perhaps, it is meant to be a permanent reminder of the eternal vigilance of the agents.\" An Alleged 1952 UFO Crash The Media and The Censors My source for this story is Robert Oliveri, an electronic technician, reaching him at his lab in August 1993. Robert is a cousin of Joe from whom he learned of the New York newspaper's headline story of a UFO crash in 1952 and of the events that followed at his parents' apartment in the Bronx. According to Robert, Joe's"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"father overheard a brisk discussion between two government agents and his neighbor, an occupant below him on the third floor. The gist of their inquiry was to ascertain whether a copy of the newspaper was purchased at the nearby newsstand. Robert is not sure whether or not the neighbor surrendered his paper, but his uncle reasoned that he would be next to face the inquisition. Acting on an impulse, he hid the newspaper under the kitchen linoleum. Commented Robert, \"In those days before air-conditioning, occupants in hot weather depended on screen doors and rarely closed doors to allow for ventilation. Everybody knew everybody else's business.\" When the inquisitors came, Joe's dad explained that he had not yet bought the evening paper and out of curiosity asked simply, \"Why all the concern?\" The frank response: \"A flying saucer story got into the paper which was not true and the government feared that it would upset the public.\" Like a dreaded curse, the newspaper was left to rest in its tomb under the linoleum until the early 1960s. Knowing of his son's blossoming interest in UFOs, he finally opted to uncover and show him the newspaper, now yellow with age, and to admit his feelings of guilt when he misinformed the agents. Stunned, Joe shared his secret with cousin, Robert. Regrettably, the fate of the newspaper is unknown. Joe believes that his dad returned it to its grave under the linoleum. Three years later, Joe and family moved to Florida, minus the newspaper. According to Robert, the photo in the newspaper first caught his eye. Taken by a flash camera at night, the disc-shaped craft had crashed head-on, submerging tilt-wise into a sandy terrain. No windows were visible, he said, but he recalls seeing an opening on the underside of the craft's tilted rear. Around the disc were many footprints apparently made by retrieval personnel, but no one appeared in the picture. Looking back into the early years of UFO activity, starting with the Roswell incident in 1947, most of its low-level sorties were concentrated over military bases, nuclear, rocket and missile test facilities and high-tech industrial sites. Indeed for the U. S., these were perilous times. Geopolitically, a war of aggression raged in Korea. Communist China menaced all of Asia and of even greater consequence, was the threat of nuclear war with a hostile Soviet Union. Equal to these terrestrial problems were the unpredictables of a UFO incursion. Boasting strategists, however, believed that the U. S. could cope with the world's tensions, having confidence in their early H-bomb and missile superiority. But the non-terrestrial UFO was anathema; a scientific embarrassment and a potential trouble-maker for mankind's philosophies, religions and eventually the economy. Despite the evidence of UFO crashes, losing aircraft during intercept missions, and some frightening encounters with nondescript entities, the strategists devised a plan to hide the real facts and in many clever ways, manipulated the public into thinking that the interloper and its little green men were a fantasy. In spite of secrecy and censorship, there is leakage of sensitive information. But, without official confirmation, it fades into the rumor mills and if the name of the source is not revealed, the media is not interested. Media Censorship and UFO Cover-Up Now for a look into the early role of the media in the UFO cover-up and its submission to censorship. To be continued in Part 7.
