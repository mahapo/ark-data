Rescinds Toronto Travel Warning © 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe Tiananmen Square in downtown Beijing, a city of 14 million residents, is eerily silent as the SARS coronavirus has provoked the government to close down all public entertainment venues, forced thousands into quarantine while thousands more are staying in their homes or have left the city in fear of contracting the deadly disease. Photograph © 2003 by AFP. April 29, 2003 Beijing, China - On this date, China announced nine new deaths from severe acute respiratory syndrome known as SARS and 202 new cases, bringing the country's death toll to 148 and case number to 3,303. Some medical authorities have expressed concern that given China's deliberate efforts to hide SARS patients and even deny their was a disease problem until only recently, the actual number of cases might be double or triple the current publicly reported number. The World Health Organization's advisory against nonessential travel to Be ijing and China's Shanxi Province, Guangdong Province and Hong Kong remains in effect where SARS is still a serious epidemic. There, as the government tries to clean buses, public buildings, schools and hospitals, the economies have collapsed in the face of a disease that is keeping thousands of people home, either in quarantine or in fear of catching the dangerous illness.

Rescinds Toronto Travel Warning But apparently giving into the political pressure from Toronto government officials who were angry about the suggestion that their SARS-infected city is not safe, W.H.O. today rescinded its SARS advisory against nonessential travel to Toronto. However, it's still a fact that Toronto has the largest number of SARS cases and deaths outside Asia. So far, Canada has reported 146 cases and "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"20 deaths. That is a mortality rate of 13.7%. In exchange for the lifted travel warning, the Canadian government says it will now screen all passengers leaving the country for symptoms of SARS, which includes a fever above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, body aches, dry cough and difficulty breathing. Association of Southeast Asian Nations Meet to Battle SARS Today was also the first time that high-level government officials from China, Hong Kong and ten other Asian nations met in Bangkok, Thailand, specifically to come up with ways to fight the SARS epidemic. \"Every country must be responsible for the health of their citizens, not allowing their sick people to travel to other parts of the region,\" said Thailand's Public Health Minister. The group agreed to screen international travelers at both departure and arrival gates. Some airports are investing in thermal imaging cameras which can detect high fevers. There will now be an emphasis on sharing information, not hiding it, and creating an international emergency SARS hotline. Backing up the Thai Public Health Minister's statement, China today banned tourists from visiting Tibet, central China and the Chinese countryside, even though W.H.O. has so far not reported any SARS cases in Tibet. W.H.O. continues to report that new SARS cases are slowing in Vietnam, Canada, Singapore and even Hong Kong, suggesting the deadly new coronavirus linked to SARS is being contained in those regions. Can China get control over the virus it refused to acknowledge since it first emerged in November 2002? Is this new coronavirus now destined to stay in the world, flaring up with unexpected virulence under environmental conditions and routes of transmission that are still not fully understood? If we don't yet have a vaccine for the common cold, another coronavirus, is a vaccine for this brand new coronavirus really feasible any time soon? What happens if this new coronavirus continues to mutate as it \"learns\" to operate in the human population? Could it become more virulent? Or less? SARS Cases as of April 29, 2003 Reported by CDC and W.H.O. United States Suspected SARS pneumonia cases in the United States have climbed to 274 in 38 states with 52 probable cases; no deaths.
