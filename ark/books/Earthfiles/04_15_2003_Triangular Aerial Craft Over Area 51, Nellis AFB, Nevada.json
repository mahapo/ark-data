On page 20, Restricted SOM1-01 Majestic-12 Group Special Operations Manual \"Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology, Recovery and Disposal,\" published April 1954 by the United States of America War Office. April 14, 2003 Boise, Idaho - In early August 1995, I received a plain manila envelope with only a San Francisco terminal annex postal stamp to indicate its origin. Inside were several pages and a title sheet that said, \"Restricted SOM1-01 Majestic-12 Group Special Operations Manual - Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology, Recovery and Disposal, TOP SECRET/magic eyes only, Warning! This is a TOP SECRET-MAJIC EYES ONLY document containing compartmentalized information essential to the national security of the United States. EYES ONLY ACCESS to the material herein is strictly limited to personnel possessing MAJIC-12 CLEARANCE LEVEL. Examination or use by unauthorized personnel is strictly forbidden and is punishable by federal law. Majestic-12 Group, April 1954.\" A War Department Logo position was indicated at the bottom of the cover page. According to page 4 of the SOM1-01 manual, \"Extraterrestrial Technology is defined as follows: a. Aircraft identified as not manufactured in the United States or any terrestrial foreign powers, including experimental military or civilian aircraft. ...Such aircraft may appear as one of several shapes and configurations and exhibit extraordinary flight characteristics.\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Page 5, 9. Description of the Craft states: \"Documented extraterrestrial craft (UFOBs) are classified in one of four categories based on general shape, as follows: a) Elliptical, or disc shape. b . Fu sel age o r cigar sh ap e. c. Ovoid or circular shape. d. Airfoil or triangular shape. This craft is believed to be new technology due to the rarity and (sic) recency of the observations. Radar indicates an isoceles triangle profile, the longest side being nearly 300 feet in length. Little is known about the performance of these craft due to the rarity of good sightings, but they are believed capable of high speeds and abrupt maneuvers similar to or exceeding the performance attributed to types \"a\" and \"c.\" The caption below the 1954 drawings said: \"Illustrations in this diagram are gathered from documented sightings in Air Force and Central Intelligence and from examination of wreckage collected from various sources years 1947-1953 inclusive.\" Since receiving the SOM1-01 manual, I have talked with a former CIA employee who said he saw a very similar manual during his intelligence career, but that it was a 1970 version. If the training manual is real and is a true insight into government knowledge and cover-up, insiders knew long ago that large, unidentified, triangle-shaped aerial craft are not made on Earth. Between Groom Lake and Papoose Lake is Area 51 and S-4 at Nellis AFB, Nevada, allegedly devoted to back-engineering extraterrestrial technology and housing extraterrestrial biological entities, both alive and dead. Triangle-Shaped Craft Over Area 51, Nellis AFB, Nevada Ike Bishop, of Boise, Idaho and State Director and Chief Field Investigator for the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), saw his first large triangular aircraft on Tuesday, May 21, 2002. He was parked at Mail Box Road near Area 51 at Nellis AFB, Nevada that night for a skywatch with his friends and colleagues. Ike and others were meeting together for Memorial Day weekend as they have done each year for some time in order to share information about the secretive and TOP SECRET Area 51. Ike, along with his friends, was surprised to see aerial, triangle-shaped craft on three nights, beginning May 21, 2002. Interview:"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Ike Bishop, Idaho State Director and Chief Field Investigator, Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), Boise, Idaho: \"We were sitting at Mail Box Road and watching the mountain tops of Area 51 and S-4 and behind us, we noticed three triangular lights that were coming through right behind the peak of Timpahute Peek, three lights in a triangle and this appeared to be a craft and the craft had thousands - and I'm not exaggerating with that figure - of little twinkling lights around it. They were like flashes. Had it not been for those flashes, we probably would have missed the craft altogether. WERE THE TWINKLING LIGHTS COVERING THE TRIANGULAR BASE? WERE YOU SEEING A SOLID TRIANGLE OF THESE FLASHING LITTLE LIGHTS? OR WERE THEY ONLY ON THE PERIMETER? They were completely around it. They appeared to engulf the craft. However, the three triangle lights on the tips of the craft were very much evident. They were more prominent than the little flashes. YOU'VE GOT FLASHES OF SMALL LIGHTS THAT ARE DEFINING THE SHAPE OF THE TRIANGLE AND THEN AT THE VERTICES WITHIN THE SHAPE OF THE TRIANGLE, YOU'VE GOT A LIGHT AT EACH OF THOSE CORNERS? That's correct. WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THE CORNER LIGHTS? It appeared to be a very dull yellowish-white and there appeared to be no light in the center bottom of the craft. WAS THIS PASSING OVER YOU AS YOU WERE STANDING OUTSIDE YOUR CAR? Yes, I stopped and got out to take a look at it and it was traveling very slow. It came between Badger Peak and Tickabo and I've been up that peak many times and I know the size of that valley. This craft appeared to take up almost the entire valley, which would put it - I estimate the craft to be about half a mile in length. HUGE THEN? It was very huge. HOW CLOSE OVER YOU DID IT COME? It came within 1.5 to 2 miles because it went right down the top of the mountain range north towards Rachel and it was just above the mountain peaks there. Those mountains in that area are quite low. I would say probably a total of 5,000 feet above elevation. WHAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING IS SOMETHING THAT IF IT WERE HALF A MILE LONG AND IT WAS ONLY A COUPLE OF MILES FROM YOU AND 5,000 FEET UP, ANYTHING THAT BIG, YOU WOULD THINK YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD SOME SOUND. There was absolutely no sound. It was silent and it was moving very slow. We estimate it was moving about 25 to 30 mph and just gliding along very quietly with these little flashes. While it was under power, these flashes were very evident. WHAT HAPPENED? It traveled on down through the mountain ranges towards Rachel. We watched it with binoculars. It left one valley and into another and eventually was out of sight. But then 10 minutes later, here it came back. Total sighting time that night was a couple of hours, I would estimate. DID IT GO RIGHT BACK OVER THE SAME VALLEY."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Went right back over the same valley and disappeared over Tickabo peak again, basically right back where it came from. AT THAT POINT, HAD YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE? No, this is the first one that I've seen down there. I've had other sightings, but this is the first I've seen that large and that close up. IN TERMS OF TRYING TO CONFIRM WHETHER THIS COULD BE SOMETHING THAT THE UNITED STATES IS DEVELOPING AT AREA 51, OR SOMETHING THAT WOULD FALL IN THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL CATEGORY, IF IT TRULY WERE A HALF MILE LONG, DOESN'T THAT SEEM TO ARGUE AGAINST ITS BEING AMERICAN MADE? When I talked about this at the Little Ailey Inn the next day at breakfast, some of the locals were telling me that they had been watching them for the past couple of weeks. And I asked, 'Them? You mean, there's more than one?' And they said, 'Yeah, there are theirs and ours.' And I asked, 'How do you tell the difference?' And they said, 'Apparently ours has a red light in the center of the craft itself on the bottom side. Theirs does not.' I have nothing to confirm that, but that's apparently what the locals seem to think. We were able to see them three nights in a row. WHAT HAPPENED THE NEXT NIGHT AND THE THIRD NIGHT. The next night, it appeared at about the same time and the time frame was between 9:45 p.m. and 10 p.m. at night. Other sightings of craft we've had down there have been very early in the morning, but this was about 9:45-10 p.m. at night when we first saw it. Same thing the second night. On the third night in Rachel, people were starting to arrive for the gathering and we had a local affiliate CBS news crew out of Boise, Idaho here. They were able to capture this on video by watching the mountains over Area 51 there. (Videotape Frames of the Triangle-Shaped Aerial Craft Will Be Posted Here Soon) About the same time of night, we were watching the flares that came up over the mountain and all of a sudden, up popped that craft. WHY DID YOU KNOW THERE WERE FLARES? There was a huge ground flare that came up. HOW DID YOU KNOW IT WAS A FLARE? We've seen a lot of flares down there that they drop from the jets and there was a lot of flare activity that night because at Indian Springs, there was some kind of a military maneuver going on down there and there were a lot of flares being dropped by the airplanes. But this one came up from the ground, similar to a rocket. You could see the trail (arcing up into the sky) and then there was a huge illumination. THAT ILLUMINATION LIGHTED UP THE SKY FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED? This craft popped up just to the left of it. The way it looked when it popped up over the mountains is that it came just straight up and on this sighting, there were no flashes, no miniature flashes around it. It hung motionless for approximately a minute or two and then began to move slowly towards the south. This was the only night that it did not have the little miniature flashes going on around it. My guess is that those flashes were some kind of cloaking device. We took several still photos of this and the only thing that comes out in the pictures are the little flashes of lights. So, it's my guess that this is some kind"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"of cloaking device.\" More Information: See Glimpses of Other Realities, Volume II: High Strangeness in the Earthfiles Shop.
