Five miles further northeast of Mildenhall is RAF Lakenheath, an American USAF facility with nuclear missiles. R AF Mildenhall, England, 100th Air Refueling Wing, USAF. November 3, 2006 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Around the summer solstice of June 22, 2003, at Royal Air Force Mildenhall in England, USAF security guards on nightshift were alerted that a bright, unidentified light was approaching restricted airspace at the base runway. One of the security guards that night recently contacted me. He had enlisted in the U. S. Air Force in 2000, had trained in the Air Traffic Technical School and was stationed at Langley AFB, Virginia, in Security Forces. In August 2002, he received orders to work at RAF Mildenhall, about 25 miles northeast of Cambridge. [ Editor’s Note: Royal Air Force Mildenhall - The United States Air Force activated the 100th Air Refueling Wing, host wing at RAF Mildenhall, United Kingdom, on February 1, 1992. From the time of its reactivation, the 100th ARW has served as the lone air refueling wing for U.S. Air Forces in Europe. The diverse mission of aerial refueling, special operations, air mobility, reconnaissance and intelligence makes RAF Mildenhall a unique U.S. Air Force base.] Mildenhall is headquarters for the 100th Air Refueling Wing that supports the USAF and other NATO ally countries. Also stationed there was a Special Operations Group flying "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"MH-53 helicopters and an Air Force Combat Control and Para-Rescue Special Operators. RAF Mildenhall is also only about five miles from RAF Lakenheath, another U.S. Air Force installation that has three fighter squadrons of F-15s and where nuclear missiles are ready to launch at all times. R AF Lakenheath, England. [ Editor’s Note: Royal Air Force Lakenheath, England, is located 70 miles northeast of London and 25 miles from Cambridge. As the host wing, the 48th Fighter Wing is also designated the Air Force’s Statue of Liberty Wing - making it the only wing with both a numerical designation and an official name. The Liberty Wing has nearly 5,700 active-duty military members, 2,000 British and U.S. civilians, and includes a geographically separated unit at nearby RAF Feltwell. In addition to supporting three combat-ready squadrons of F-15E Strike Eagle and F-15C Eagle fighter aircraft, the Liberty Wing houses the 56th Rescue Squadron’s HH-60G Combat Search and Rescue helicopters. RAF Lakenheath is the largest U.S. Air Force-operated base in England and the only U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) F-15 fighter wing.] What happened at RAF Mildenhall on June 22, 2003, around 9 p.m. local time, was the most dramatic incident of the American security guard's four-year career in the Air Force. He agreed to talk with me for Earthfiles and radio, provided I did not use his name or current location. Interview: Former USAF Security, RAF Mildenhall near Cambridge, Suffolk County, England: \" I worked the night shift in security forces. My main job was patrolling the installation, securing the perimeter. We were responsible for law enforcement activities on the installation as well. Primarily that evening, we were on a little bit more of a high alert because we did have an F-117 stealth fighter from Holloman AFB, New Mexico. It was stopped over for the night. So, our security level goes up a little bit when we have a high-protection asset like that. We made daily rounds and patrols of the airfield. At approximately 21:00 hours in the evening (9 p.m. local time), we started getting phone calls to the law enforcement desk from people off base (civilians). They said they saw a strange object in the sky hovering out near the base. Sometimes locals did call in and say they saw crazy things. We have a lot of operations happening in the night with helicopters, so everyone (on base) assumed the locals were talking about the helicopter landing lights or something like that. We did have helicopters flying that night. Probably about a half hour later, I got a call from the second member of my team, Alpha Flight. The kid was saying that he saw something on the approach end of the runway about five miles out. So we headed out to take a look. When we got there, we saw a bright object in the sky, a lot brighter than a landing light of any helicopter or plane. The light was pulsating from blue to green and then back to kind of white, almost a translucent kind of pulsing. Kind of hard to explain, to put into words exactly what it was doing. After that, we saw the object was gone right then. It kind of just before our eyes looked like it vaporized, disappeared. I don’t really have any words for what it did. At that point we headed back to the other guys to discuss what we saw and we went into the Radar Approach Control. On the radar, the Air Traffic Controllers had an unidentified contact. One of my friends who was an Air Traffic Controller who happened to reside in the barracks where I lived said that at the same time we saw this thing (at the far end of the runway), they had identified contact on radar. They had tried to establish frequency, the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"protocol how they do it. You try to establish on a certain frequency, identify the aircraft. At that point, the object was not in restricted air space. It was not into our Mildenhall air space yet. Unidentified Aerial Light Entered Mildenhall Restricted Air Space While we were there, the Air Traffic Controllers had not identified contact and the phone calls started coming in from engine mechanics and other people working the flight line that the object was back. Now, it was in fact within our air space. It was about 3.5 miles off the approach end of the runway. At that point our security level was heightened. At the point, the Security Forces Commander decided that since Air Traffic Control was trying to make contact with it and received no response; they tried on an emergency frequency and received no response. The unidentified aircraft, or whatever it was, showed up as a return on radar and it would disappear from radar while the object was still visible to people outside. A lot of guys saw it. There were jet mechanics working late on aircraft. At that point, one of my friends who was an air traffic controller said that three helicopter pilots out doing maneuvers did see the aircraft. They had visual contact in the air and so did several other security force members. At that point, we left the radar facility, the tower, and we headed out to the approach end of the runway. We got to the approach end of the runway and there it was, the same object as before, pulsating blue to green, green to white. Not moving. Stationary. One thing I noticed about this object that was peculiar at first. It was so bright, but when it did pulsate back down to a bluish color, you could make out a silhouette almost. I, being trained to look for different kinds of aircraft, I was looking for any type of warning lights on the aircraft, on the wingtips, any type of beacon light. But there was nothing. Large Triangular Craft It did have shape to it, did have form. The closest I could describe the shape would probably be like almost like a triangle. It was like – it almost kind of looked like if I compared it to any aircraft that we had – maybe like one of the F-117s, one of the stealths. But it was way beyond that. Besides, no F-117 or any other aircraft can hover without making a noise! Yeah, no sound – that was weird, too. If it had been a helicopter that close, you would really have heard the rotor wash from the rotor. F - 117 Nighthawk. HOW BIG DO YOU ESTIMATE IT WAS? At first I could not tell. But the object did start moving closer to us. It did start coming in closer. I think as long as we were looking at it and no one realized it was getting closer. When it got into about 1.5 miles at that point, I had no reference to compare it to, but from seeing other aircraft up in the air I would say probably about the size of one of our tanker jets – about the size of a KC-135, which is equivalent to a civilian 767. THAT’S HOW LONG? Those aircraft are over 100 feet. I would say that the aerial object was definitely over 100 feet long and over 50 feet wide. [ Editor’s Note: 767 Airliner Wing span is 47.57m (156ft 1in), length 48.51m (159ft 2in), height 15.85m (52ft 0in). Wing area 283.3m2 (3050sq ft).

The F-117's minimal radar cross-section and ability to drop precision ordnance place it in a class by itself. Also known as the \"Wobblin' Goblin,\" the Night Hawk flew 1,271 sorties during Operation Desert Storm in 1991, achieving an 80% mission success rate while suffering no losses or battle damage. The designation \"F-117\" does not fit in the logical \"F number\" series which was restarted at F-1 in 1962 with 11 then-current fighters being redesignated. The USAF had allocated F-112 through F-116 to Soviet fighters acquired through various means. One theory is that the Night Hawk was designated F-117 to draw less attention. Source: Military Analysis Network: http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys /ac/f-117.htm ] SO, THIS WAS A LARGE TRIANGULAR SHAPE THAT WAS HOVERING? It was weird! It was triangular when it was not pulsating the brightest. When it was pulsating at the brightest again, it looked like it was just a light. It did not look like it had any mass or shape to it. When the light would pulsate again to another color, then you could see the shape of it. HOW LONG DID IT STAY PULSING IN ANY GIVEN COLOR? I’d say it was about three second intervals. IF I WERE STANDING OUT THERE, I WOULD SEE IT BE WHITE FOR THREE SECONDS, BLUE FOR THREE SECONDS, GREEN FOR THREE SECONDS AND BACK TO WHITE FOR THREE SECONDS? At first, yes. As the object got closer to us, the pulsating times got shorter and it almost was not pulsating anymore. I wouldn’t say it changed color. It was like melting from one color to another, like fading into one color from another. AS IF THE PULSING WERE SPEEDING UP? Yes, the closer it got it speeded up. I then heard fighter aircraft, F-15s. Later, I came to find out that after they (Air Traffic Controllers) could not establish contact with the object, fighter jets from Lakenheath five miles away were scrambled to identify the object from the air. There orders were it had to be removed from our airspace. A merican F-15 Eagles. At that time, when I heard the F-15s getting closer, as we looked at this object, the object seemed to react, I guess, to the sound of the jets coming closer. As the F-15s got closer, we could hear them coming closer, the object’s pulsating increased and the object started to back off from the Mildenhall facility. Right as the F-15s were coming over our air space, the object made a couple of erratic maneuvers: vertical, back down vertical, horizontal, very quick, very smooth. No sound. At that point, it faded away again the same way it did earlier in the evening, disappeared, vaporized, I don’t know. Then we saw the F-15s come into our pattern, noticed the lights from the F-15s. They were circling our air space at that point. That was it for the sighting of the object. Lakenheath Nuclear Missile Operations Shut Down After Radar Lo ck On Triangular Craft Afterward, we had to go to debriefing. The base was on heightened alert. I came to find out"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"afterward that the installation next door, Lakenheath, I guess from people I know in the Security Forces Squadron over there, some of their systems were compromised concerning the nuclear weapons. I don’t know the details of what happened, but it all correlated at the same time this object was in between our facilities. [ Editor's emphasis.] I’VE HAD OTHER REPORTS FROM PEOPLE IN THE MILITARY ABOUT LOCKING ON TO UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS, OR BOGIES. IN ONE CASE THAT I REPORTED ABOUT RECENTLY, WHEN THE LOCK ON WAS DONE WITH A DOPPLER TYPE OF RADAR, THERE WAS APPARENTLY RETALIATION ON THE PART OF THE UNIDENTIFIED. ALL OF THE POLARITY IN ALL OF THE RADAR EQUIPMENT ... Was reversed. RIGHT, WAS REVERSED. EVERYTHING SHUT DOWN. A LOT OF IT WAS DAMAGED. DID THIS SAME THING HAPPEN AT LAKENHEATH? From what I’m told by some of the people there, I don’t know except the radar on the object that came into our airspace did lock on to that object. The F-15s would have had radar locked on to it as soon as they took off. Approximately the same time, the systems were compromised. I guess some of the powering systems went down. The back-ups were not responding where the nuclear weapons were secured. That’s as far as I know. SO SPECIFICALLY, THE EQUIPMENT THAT WAS EFFECTED WAS THE NUCLEAR MISSILE AREA AT RAF LAKENHEATH? Yes, from what I know, there were no other systems on that facility affected that night except for the security equipment pertaining to the nuclear weapons. SO, IF THERE WAS ANY COMMUNICATION ON THE PART OF THE INTELLIGENCE INSIDE OF THE MYSTERIOUS TRIANGLE, IT WOULD BE ‘I HAVE THE POWER TO SHUT DOWN YOUR NUCLEAR FACILITY?’ Yeah, if you think about it, you could look at it that way. Something is saying, ‘Hey, any time we want.’ But if that were the message, it would be a pretty understood message. Unidentified Aerial Triangle Similar to Belgium UFO HAVE YOU SEEN ANY PHOTOGRAPHS THAT RESEMBLE WHAT YOU SAW ABOVE THE MILDENHALL AFB IN 2003? Yes, actually I saw a photograph on the computer that resembled the object when it was not brightly lit. It was over Belgium, I think. It was the same triangular type object. It looked really similar to that. Left: F-117 American Nighthawk stealth fighters. Right: The Belgium UFO triangle was photographed at an unknown location in Belgium on November 29, 1989, by unknown source. False Official Explanation: \"NATO Training Exercise\" DID YOU EVER SIGN A NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT ABOUT THAT INCIDENT BETWEEN MILDENHALL AND LAKENHEATH? No, I never signed any type of agreement. The only thing we signed was an acknowledgement that we received a (NATO) training exercise. THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A TRAINING EXERCISE?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Ye s . SO, YOU HAD TO SIGN A PAPER THAT WAS A LIE? Ye s . AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOU NEVER SIGNED A NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT AND THE ONLY PAPER YOU WERE GIVEN TO SIGN WAS A LIE, WHY DO YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE USING YOUR REAL NAME AND YOUR MILITARY RECORD AND BACKGROUND TO TELL THIS STORY? Scared. (laughs) Not to be laughed at. I know a lot of guys in the military who have experienced the same things, but there are a lot of people who are still ignorant to what is happening and would rather laugh at you and say you are an idiot, you’re not qualified, you don’t know what you are talking about. Embarrassment. I haven’t really told the story before, except to some of the guys who were there with me. SO, IT’S REALLY MORE A FEAR OF YOUR FELLOW MALE COLLEAGUES THAN IT IS EVEN FROM SOME GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY CLAMPING DOWN ON YOU? Yes, more so. The possibility is always there that someone could in the government. But I don’t think they would waste their time. I think they count on that – they count on other people laughing at other people. That’s kind of their weapon, I think. IN OTHER WORDS, THE GOVERNMENT COUNTS ON THE RIDICULE FACTOR OF HUMAN-TO-HUMAN KEEPING EVERYTHING UNDER WRAPS? Absolutely! Especially guys in the military. We’re trained to do something and not to look weak in front of each other. Definitely. WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS GOING TO TAKE TO CHANGE THIS POLICY OF DENIAL? I don’t think it will ever change. I don’t think there’s anything anyone can do, nothing short of one of these things landing in downtown Times Square! (laughs) I don’t think it will change. WONDER WHY THE INTELLIGENCE ITSELF DOESN’T JUST DO THAT? My answer? I heard a scientist say once, ‘Would you bother explaining your day to an ant hill?’ People have no concept, no understanding – whatever these things are I believe they are so far beyond us, so outside the scope of our understanding. Policy of Denial About UFOs/Extraterrestrials DID ANY OF YOU GET A SPECIFIC DEBRIEFING FROM ANY SUPERIOR OFFICERS ABOUT THIS INCIDENT IN THE CONTEXT OF UFOS, INTERPLANETARY, OTHER INTELLIGENCES, ANY OF THAT KIND OF SUBJECT MATTER? Afterwards, we were debriefed by OSI, Office of Special Investigations. The word ‘UFO’ did come up once from one of the investigators, kind of in a joking manner trying to make it lighthearted, I guess. Like, ‘If you guys thought you saw a UFO tonight, tell me about it.’ That’s the only time that word came up from anybody with power. The only thing I have to say about it that upsets me the most is how we were treated after the incident by our own superiors. We were treated like we were ignorant. Afterwards a few days later, we were told that it was an exercise, a NATO exercise to determine the security at the installation and what we were witnessing was a helicopter with landing lights. All of us laughed about it because we’re not idiots! We know what a helicopter landing light is and this was not it. That was probably the most upsetting. The other guys I’ve talked to be told that is a basic flat out lie to your face. AND YOU HAD DESCRIBED WATCHING THIS OBJECT WITH YOUR OWN EYES MOVING RAPIDLY VERTICALLY UP, VERTICALLY DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT AND IN DOING SO IN A SPEED THAT NO TERRESTRIAL HELICOPTER COULD DO. No, and being in helicopters a lot and aircraft a lot, an object moving like that – if we did have an object that could move like that – whatever human occupants were inside wouldn’t survive that! (laughs) The G-Forces alone looked to me like unreal. No one would"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"be able to survive that. It was hard because someone joining the military wanting to protect the country and do the right thing and be a stand up guy, it’s tough when you think you’re doing the right thing and people treat you like you don’t matter. DID ANYBODY TALK WITH YOU OFF THE RECORD ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT HAVING KNOWLEDGE OF AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL PRESENCE IN THESE OBJECTS? No. A couple of pilots I talked to that I know from the Air Force said they’ve had encounters with things in the air, but it was more like guys hanging out after work at the bar. SO, IN YOUR MILITARY CAREER, DID YOU EVER HAVE A DISCUSSION ON OR OFF THE RECORD WITH ANYONE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCE INTERACTING WITH OUR PLANET? Area 51, Groom Lake, Nellis AFB, Nevada Yes. It was off the record. It was with a couple of security forces, individuals that I knew that I went to initial training with, who are stationed out in Nevada at the Groom Lake area, the test facility. They said they saw a lot of weird things and them having a TOP SECRET clearance only had access to the outer perimeter of the installation for security. They were never allowed inside any of the research facilities. One of the guys who works there believes something extraterrestrial was probably going on. Research on different kinds of craft and things of that nature. But it was never on the record. DID ANYBODY EVER TELL YOU THAT SECURITY GUARDS AT AREA 51 HAD DISAPPEARED? I heard rumors of that because after I got out of the service, I myself got a job on a government contract under the Department of Energy at the Nevada Test Site, pretty much doing similar work that I did in the military. I only remained there for about six months. I wanted to come back to the East Coast. The things I was exposed to out there (Area 51), I just wasn’t comfortable. So, I decided to leave, but I did hear a lot of rumors and talk. The area we were responsible for is roughly the size of Rhode Island. So, it was a lot of perimeter to patrol! We were responsible for the border of Groom Lake. Well, we interacted with other security from there contracted under Dynacorp. We were contracted under Wackenhut. A couple of the guys we talked to out there heard rumors not so much about disappearing, but guys being sick. They would tell you one thing, ‘Oh, there’s nothing to worry about out here.’ There was one area saying ‘Radiation exposure’ and on the other side, they are saying, ‘No, it’s fine.’ We had to wear dosimeters at work. Things like that. Your boots having to be shaken out when you left work. After about six months of that, I had enough. WHAT I UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE MEN YOU REFERRED TO BEING SICK ARE SICK FROM RADIATION POISONING? No one was really sure about what they are sick from. From what I heard from people is they developed a scab thing, almost like a psoriasis or shingles kind of disease, but no one is really sure. DID ANYBODY SPECULATE ABOUT WHAT THE CAUSE MIGHT BE? Chemicals or some type of unknown exposure to something out there at the Groom Lake test facility. But at the same time, there were a lot of scientists were ill at the Nevada Test Site as well. I was still in the process of obtaining my government Q Clearance while I was there, so I didn’t really have access to a lot more than just TOP SECRET clearance that I already had for the military (USAF). BUT IT’S FAIR TO SAY THAT AMONG SOME OF THE SECURITY PEOPLE THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO TALK WITH, THEY SEEMED TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SOME KIND OF UFO/EXTRATERRESTRIAL CONNECTION TO AREA 51? Oh, yeah. Absolutely!\" More Information: For further information about UFOs and military, please see reports below in the Earthfiles"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Archives: • 10/28/2006 -- Close UFO Encounter by USAF Eyewitnesses • 10/19/2006 -- UFO Retaliation to U.
