Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Update on Deformed Calf Fetus © 1999 by Linda Moulton Howe November 13, 1999 Las Vegas, Nevada This past week I talked with Colm Kelleher, Ph.D. Biochemistry and Deputy Administrator at the National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS) in Las Vegas, Nevada. NIDS paid for a necropsy on the deformed calf fetus born October 22, 1999 at a ranch owned by Joe Martinez in Los Brazos, New Mexico. (See: Earthfiles November 7, 1999 report.) Dr. Kelleher told me that after my radio and Earthfiles.com reports, he requested that the one eyeball from the deformed fetus that had been stored at minus 85 degrees F. be thawed for further examination. I asked Dr. Kelleher if any specific study of the eyeball had been made before by veterinarian Leroy Martinez or NIDS scientists prior to freezing. He said none had been, so now the eye would be studied further. After thawing and further examination, NIDS provided a photograph of the deformed fetus's comma-shaped cornea and elongated pupil shown below. Eye from deformed calf fetus has two major abnormalities: First, the cornea has a \"comma\" shape with an angular lateral protrusion. Second, the pupil is an \"elongated aperture with rounded edges.\" Photograph © 1999 by National Institute for Discovery Science, Las Vegas, Nevada. This past week, I also received a black and white sketch from Albuquerque resident and neuro-muscular therapist, Rebecca Minshall, of the deformed calf fetus's two eyes that she saw on videotape and in photographs taken during the necropsy which she described as looking \"reptilian.\" Ranch owner, Joe Martinez, also told me the fetus's eyes were an odd \"baby blue\" color and had vertical pupils.

M. , at his Cibolla, New Mexico clinic. Today I received a FAX from Ms. Minshall after she had reviewed the NIDS web site listed below. She said the videotape and photographs were much clearer, as her drawing indicated, than the photograph provided by NIDS. Today, I also interviewed Dr. Kelleher with his permission about the deformed calf eye and Ms. Minshall's comments. Interview: Colm Kelleher, Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Deputy Administrator, National Institute for Discovery Science, Las Vegas, Nevada: \"Maybe what the people are saying is that there is a difference between what they saw in terms of the live eye versus the eye that has been preserved in Formalin for a couple of weeks before being photographed. That could be one difference. Essentially what we've done is taken the thing out of cold storage in preservative and we tried to photograph it to the best of our ability to inform people that this is a definitely deformed eye. There are several things unusual about it. First thing is that the cornea of the eye was different. Rather than having a slightly oval shape, it's shaped more like a comma in a sentence. The second thing is that the pupil is elongated. It's not the average round or oval shape. It's much more elongated, giving it an unusual appearance. IS THERE A REPTILIAN APPEARANCE IN THAT ELONGATION? It looks unusual. Our veterinarian and I don't have much experience in looking at reptilian eyes. But there are the two obvious deformities in the eye and the structure of the eye. Otherwise, the pigmentation in the iris is normal. The conjunctival sclera are normal. But the actual cornea is definitely deformed as is the opening of the pupil. WAS THERE A BABY BLUE COLOR? Baby blue, I'm not sure of, because by the time we examined it closely it had been in 10% Formalin for more than two weeks. So, we can't really attest to the color. THAT WAS THE TESTIMONY OF THE RANCHER, JOE MARTINEZ. We feel that probably over time that may have faded - and also the 10% Formalin may have bleached it somewhat because we didn't see the kind of baby blue he was talking about. BASED ON THE DEFORMITIES THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM ABOUT THE PUPIL AND THE CORNEA, ARE YOU GOING TO DO DNA TESTING? No. Because we don't feel there is any evidence from what the veterinarian people have told us that there is anything unusual beyond a rare deformity in this animal. We specifically asked Dr. Leroy Martinez in Tierra Amarilla to look for unusual stuff as well as the resident NIDS veterinarian, Dr. George Onet. Both of these people who are more qualified than I am in terms of animal pathology and animal histology and they are saying that this animal is a rare, deformed hydrocephalic animal. The veterinarian in northern New Mexico has seen similar cases, but not as extreme as this one. This one undoubtedly was an extreme case of deformity. IN A SITUATION WHERE THERE IS A DEFORMED FETUS NOT VERY FAR FROM DULCE, NEW MEXICO WHICH HAS PLAYED A VERY STRANGE, ALMOST MYTHOLOGICAL PART OF THE HISTORY OF ALLEGED GENETIC MANIPULATION BY NON-HUMANS WITH EARTH LIFE - WHY WOULD NIDS NOT DO"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"DNA ANALYSIS TO SEE IF THERE IS SOME BIZARRE GENOME SEQUENCING ABERRATION? There is a lot of compelling information on the internet regarding what you've just said. But in terms of physical evidence which is what we are trying to look at, there is very little physical evidence that defines these kinds of genetic manipulations. And if we had been told by our veterinarian people that there was anything beyond the deformities that I've just outlined in this animal, we would have done the next several steps. But right now, the evidence we have is that it's a rare deformity. And quite frankly, we're aware of the stories that have come out of Dulce and we've done investigations in that area. And there is a tremendous amount of speculation and a tremendous amount of reaching beyond the evidence that has gone on in the northern part of New Mexico. IF THESE VERY RARE ABNORMAL FETUSES MIGHT BE LINKED TO SOME KIND OF GENETIC MANIPULATION, HOW WOULD WE EVER KNOW UNLESS WE DO GENOME SEQUENCING TO SEE IF THERE IS SOMETHING ARTIFICIAL? Essentially if there was something like that going on, the only way you would find it would be to do a kind of genetic sequencing. However, as far as we're concerned, the structure of the animal, the structure of what we've seen so far - even the tissue samples we've looked at, including the eye, don't give any credence to that. The internal organ architecture of the animal was pretty normal. The heart was slightly enlarged and the liver was slightly enlarged. But beyond that, the internal organ structure of the animal was normal. So, there is really nothing to indicate going down a path like that beyond speculation. BUT IN THESE EXTRAORDINARY CASES, ONE OF THE OFTEN STATED CRITICISMS IS THAT NO ONE EVER DOES GO THAT EXTRA MILE TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY UNUSUAL GENOME SEQUENCING? Our position is that we will go the extra mile if we're convinced that it's worth going the extra mile. But in this case, we're not. It's as simple as that. We've gone to the extent of doing the full necropsy on the animal, asking for two different veterinarians' opinions from Dr. Martinez and Dr. Onet. NIDS HAS BEEN IN FORMATION FORMALLY SINCE THE END OF 1995, CORRECT? That's right. WE'RE NOW AT THE END OF 1999. IN THOSE FOUR YEARS, HAVE YOU EVER DONE A DNA SEQUENCING ON ANY ABNORMAL TISSUE? No, we haven't. WHAT WOULD BE THE CRITERIA OF ABNORMALITY THAT WOULD TRIGGER DOING DNA SEQUENCING? The criteria would be if there was compelling physical evidence that would suggest we go down that path. That would be either histology, pathology or even cellular structure that would compel us to go down that path. COULD YOU GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT MIGHT HYPOTHETICALLY BE AN ANOMALY THAT WOULD TRIGGER GOING FURTHER WITH DNA TESTING? If a necropsy, for example, turned up a 3-chambered heart that was in good condition. That would be of interest.\" We b s it e s : http://www.nidsci.org/ Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"All Rights Reserved . www.earthfiles.com earthfiles@earthfiles.com Republication and redissemination of the contents of this screen or any part of this website are expressly prohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.
