Navy Satellites © 2002 by Linda Moulton Howe Canadian satellite hunter, Ted Molczan, says this analog video frame shows the U. S. Navy's NOSS 2-1 trio of satellites launched in June 1990. Video was taken of three star-like points of light which moved slowly northeast to southwest from the Auriga constellation towards the Leo constellation where they stopped after traveling for three minutes. Estimated time was 11:02 to 11:05 p.m.Central Daylight Time on Sunday, April 14, 2002. Location was the Piney River valley overlook ten miles north of Dover in the Ozark National Forest of northwestern Arkansas. Video © 2002 by Don Kreinbrink. May 2, 2002 Toronto, Ontario, Canada - Last week on Coast to Coast AM radio, I reported about the enormous triangle of what looked like stars moving slowly through the starry sky above eight of us at the Piney River valley look out north of Dover, Arkansas on April 14. I also interviewed a NASA Goddard scientist about cluster satellites that travel in fours to see if that could explain what we all saw near Dover, but he checked orbital logs and said none of those cluster satellites were on the night side of earth on April 14. (See: Real X-Files 04/22/02 and 04/27/02.) Since then, I have received more than two hundred e-mail reports from all over the world about other triangle formations of stars or lights in the sky that move in baffling ways that cannot be satellites. But among these reports, several people have sent information about classified U. S. Navy spacecraft that move together in triangle patterns - and are definitely satellites known as the Naval Ocean Surveillance System, or NOSS. The first experimental NOSS launch was in 1971. There were several \"generation one\" launches in the 1980s and \"second generation\" launches began in 1990, continuing in 2001 with perhaps an even more advanced system and another launch scheduled for November 2002. After the military classified their orbits secret in 1983, none but those with a need to know were supposed to find them. But their is a small, global group of satellite hunters and trackers who welcome the challenge of figuring out the orbits of secret military payloads and finding them with binoculars and telescopes. One of those men is a satellite hunter from Toronto, Canada named Ted Molczan. He is an energy analyst and his hobby since the 1960s has been to calculate satellite orbits with other independent satellite hunters. He has become "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"an expert on the secret U. S Navy NOSS satellites, which he is convinced is the answer to our April 14 Dover, Arkansas triangle. This week I also called the Navy Department in Washington, D. C. to try to confirm with an official military spokesperson, but despite my repeated inquiries, no one has replied. What I have learned from Ted Molczan is that currently there are three groups of NOSS triple satellite clusters orbiting earth moving at 4 miles a second at more than 600 miles altitude, covering most of the planet every day. Usually the NOSS are around magnitude 6 in brightness, too faint for most human eyes. But occasionally, their brightness can increase depending upon sun angle and surface glint and become more visible. Their job is to scan for radio signals coming from anywhere on the earth's oceans in order to find exact locations of ships at sea. Because the satellites work in a triangular formation, it means as each detects radio frequencies, each satellite is at a different distance from the transmission source. Taking the triangulated data and using mathematical formulas, the exact latitude and longitude of the radio signals can be calculated. I talked with Ted Molczan about our Dover triangle sighting and the modern purpose of the NOSS. I began by asking him if I understood correctly, the secret Navy satellites are not being used to help American navigation at sea, but only to focus on radio transmissions from foreign ships. Interview: Ted Molczan, Energy Analysis Consultant and Satellite Tracker, Toronto, Ontario, Canada: \"Exactly, because clearly we would know, the U. S. would know where its own ships are. So what they are after are ships these are creations of the Cold War. So when they were first launched in the 1970s, it was obviously a Soviet military fleet aircraft carriers, destroyers and even submarines if near enough to the surface would have been their (NOSS) primary target. In 2002, who would be the primary target off NOSS satellites? Well, that's a darn god question because clearly some things have changed. The Soviet Union no longer exists. Possibly the Navy might have adapted these things so they aren't just monitoring the oceans. They could well be monitoring on land. And if you think about it, a radio emitter, there is nothing special about a radio transmitter being on an ocean. It can just as easily be on the earth's surface. So it could be that there is a broader mission for these things that extend beyond their original purpose which was generally thought to be ocean surveillance. So, in 1983 when our government classified everything concerning any military payload, how did you all continue to find them after that? The way the process worked in the case of NOSS, one thing that makes the task a little bit easier than average is that they are just high enough up that their orbits remain pretty stable. The main thing that makes the challenge in keeping track of a satellite is that if it's in a low orbit, say below 500 kilometers (311 miles), there is enough atmosphere at that height, tenuous as it is, that there is a drag on the satellite's orbit that causes it to slowly decay. How high are the NOSS satellites orbiting? When they are first launched, they are approximately 1100 kilometers (684 miles) above the earth. And at that height under most conditions, there is a little affect from atmospheric drag, but not much. And that means we can go for months without seeing a NOSS and often we do have to go for months without seeing them because they are not visible every night. We will go through periods when for a few weeks we can see them at a given latitude and then the orbit moves out of range. For example, it's not that they don't fly over every day."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Every day a NOSS will fly over most places of the earth. But sometimes, the passes will occur in the middle of the day when the sky is illuminated by the sun. Then we can't see them. Other times, it will come through in the dead of night when the satellites are entirely in the earth's shadow and again, we can't see them. We need to observe them near twilight, either early in the morning or the evening when we have a dark sky on the earth, but the satellite is in range of the sun and able to reflect light. OK, how did the eight of us see this triangle above Dover, Arkansas between 11:02 and 11:05 p.m. Central Daylight Time? Uh, mostly just good luck. You happened to be in a very dark location, as I understand it, no moon and clear sky. It was the pilot. He was looking at the sky at the Auriga constellation and that's when he saw the triangular formation moving very slowly. Yeah, and so it was just luck. And if he had not looked up at that time, it would have gone unnoticed. Right. Is there anything about the Auriga constellation and that path from Auriga to Leo - which was the pilot's estimate of the track above us - that relates to what you know about the orbit of the current NOSS 2-1 three satellites? Yes, it does. The first thing that I did, once I had that description, was to get the latitude and longitude of approximately where you folks were. I put that into my computer program. And I then went methodically through each of the three clusters of NOSS that are in orbit. There are three clusters, each one having three satellites. And so it was just a matter of asking the computer, OK, for this particular date and time, were any of these passing within range. And with two of the clusters, they weren't. But with one of them, it flew right over that area at just about the right time. And the other key thing is that it did pass close to Auriga and the other description that was given is that it was heading toward the Leo constellation. And indeed this thing was exactly on track for the Leo constellation. Those were two facts the date, time, direction of travel relative to constellations, those were key pieces of evidence. And there was more than that. Meaning? The other thing that was interesting is that several of the observers noted that when these things got overhead, they faded. Now, in one case, it was described as they stopped, the way the observer perceived it. That is exactly the way it looked, as if it stopped and melted into the sky somehow. Yeah, so depending upon the circumstances. Different people will perceive phenomenon in a different way,. And in this case, it was perceived by many there as a stopping and then I guess as you debriefed one another about what you saw, one of the observers gave a description that particularly matches what I can compute, knowing the orbit of these things. And that is what each object did was gradually over a short period of time, maybe a few seconds, they faded into invisibility. And they didn't fade simultaneously, but they faded in a sort of staggered effect. One of them faded and soon after another and then the other. And that's exactly what you would expect because what was happening is they were entering the earth's shadow. Meaning each of the three NOSS satellites? Yeah, and because each are in different positions they are roughly 50 to 60 kilometers apart from each other (about 37 miles) at the speed they are traveling"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"which is roughly 7 kilometers per second (about 4 miles/second) almost mind boggling to think of that kind of speed there could easily be a span of 5 to 10 seconds over which different ones would hit the earth's shadow. Even at the 11 o'clock in the evening, central daylight time? Yeah, they are up quite high indeed orbiting, so for them it is from that vantage point, sunset is going to come much later than it is going to come for someone on the earth. So that's how you get this circumstance that you are well into the earth's shadow, so you have a nice dark sky. And yet the satellite is just outside the earth's shadow fully bathed by the sun, and so you see its reflected light. Many people who have responded to the program - and there are hundreds of e-mail responses - are describing triangle patterns in which the stars even move apart and back together and rotate around themselves. That cannot be satellites. No, certainly not. Satellites, whenever you see one of these things, one of the ways you can tell it's a satellite and not an airplane or anything else, is that satellites don't make any abrupt changes in direction. There are various data bases on the web where people try to compile observations made of things seen in the sky that are unexplainable. And looking through them, the impression I got is that only a small percentage of them are likely to be NOSS. And that is based on the fact that some of them would describe objects that make sudden changes in direction, had more than just 3 points of light, or were the wrong color. Some of them would describe a red light, for example. NOSS is not associated with any kind of redness. Some people would describe the object as solid. In other words, you couldn't see stars within it. Clearly, that wouldn't be NOSS. So, just informally I've never tried to compile any statistics - my gut feeling is that NOSS would not account for more than 10% of the sightings around the world of unusual triangles. Only ten percent? Yeah, that's a guess. And what are those other 90%? I don't know. I've never had the good fortune to see one. So, with these things about all that anyone can do is try to have the presence of mind to make good observations and report them.\" We b s it e s : To read the archives of satellite observers and make your own reports, visit: http://satobs.org To report anomalous phenomenon not consistent with satellite motion, go to: http://www.narcap.org (National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomena) http://www.nwlink.com/~ufocntr (National UFO Reporting Center) http://www.mufon.com (Mutual UFO Network) And e-mail me, Linda Moulton Howe: earthfiles@earthfiles.com Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"All Rights Reserved . www.earthfiles.com earthfiles@earthfiles.com Republication and redissemination of the contents of this screen or any part of this website are expressly prohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.
