Click on banners above. October 28, 2004 Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, Canada - In two weeks, the Second Annual UFO Crash Retrieval Conference will be held at the Sunset Station Hotel in Henderson, a suburb of Las Vegas, Nevada. The speaker line up features Canadian researchers Grant Cameron and Don Ledger; British researcher Nick Redfern and American investigators including myself, Jim Marrs, Peter Robbins, Dr. David Pace, Stephen Bassett, Dr. Robert M. Wood and his son, Ryan Wood. The subject matter focuses as much as possible on documents and eyewitnesses about government knowledge and cover-up of non-human technologies and entities which have been retrieved in crashes since at least the 1940s. One of the speakers, Canadian Don Ledger, has investigated the extraordinary October 4 to11, 1967 Nova Scotia case that provoked both Canadian and American military investigations for seven days in the region of Shag Harbour, the Canadian Forces Base Shelburne and Baccaro Point, where the NORAD radar base about ten miles from Shag Harbour was called CFS Barrington. Don Ledger learned from two military personnel that one or two objects were tracked coming over Siberia and the Arctic Circle at 7700 mph before dipping down into Canadian airspace and under the water in Shag Harbour at the southern tip of Nova Scotia. Don Ledger worked as a civil servant sound engineer and TV producer-director for the provincial government in the Province of Nova Scotia for thirty-four years. He is a licensed private pilot, who has owned two aircraft and has about 1,200 hours flying time. Don did not begin researching the Shag Harbour incident until the early 1990s after his friend, Chris Stiles, told him about the intensive government and military involvement in the 7-day incident. Don had been haunted himself by a personal sighting on October 4, 1967. He was working as a salesman at the time and was up at 3 a.m. on October 4 in order to make a meeting in Yarmouth. Driving by Cape Sable Island south of Shag Harbour, Don was confused and amazed by aerial objects that did not fit any airplane he knew. Shag Harbour and nearby Clark's Harbour are at the southern tip of Nova Scotia, Canada. Interview: "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Don Ledger, Retired Civil Servant Sound Engin eer and TV Producer-Director, Province of Nova Scotia (employed 34 years); and author Maritime UFO Files © 1998, Swissair Down (Flt. 111) © 2000; Dark Object (Shag Harbour) © 2001: \"I observed a bunch of red lights over the water at Shag Harbour. They were very anomalous. I've been a pilot with a license for about twenty-three years. But I've always been interested in airplanes and I knew what aircraft could do and could not do. They definitely could not do what these things in the air were doing out over the water! CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT YOU WERE SEEING? I was seeing just red lights, possibly ten or a dozen of them out over the water, but they were zipping around. They were acting in a haphazard manner. They just weren't flying, they weren't entering or departing space or anything like that. They were just moving around the area, flitting around out there. Very anomalous but very small and unspectacular looking except that what they were doing was very unusual. THE COLOR IF YOU WERE COMPARING THAT RED TO SOMETHING THAT WE MIGHT ALL MIGHT KNOW, WHAT COLOR RED WOULD IT BE? That's what's strange about it it was like the red you would see on a nav light on an aircraft. But, seeing what I was seeing was too unusual for them to have been nav lights on an aircraft. Plus, they were interacting with each other. They weren't flying in formation. They were sort of zipping around and passing each other, very reckless type of thing. When I got back home, my wife mentioned about there having been something strange happen down on the South Shore of Nova Scotia. Then it was in the newspaper the next day and that was the Shag Harbour incident. But I did not realize then that I was going to be involved in it all these years later. How It All Began Initially it was a young fisherman, 18-years-old, named Laurie Wickens nicknamed 'Dicky' by his friends - who was driving four girls home after a dance over in Clark's Harbor which is the area where I saw the red lights. There are maybe ten miles as the crow flies to Shag Harbour. The five teenagers were driving along just to the east of Shag Harbour when they noticed some lights that appeared to be hovering slightly in the sky, just holding there and pointing down at a 45 degree angle. Then the lights started coming down toward the water. They were bright amber flashing lights flashing sequentially from front to back and back to front if you could call the front being the downward most point of the lights. The group drove around Prospect Point and someone heard a whoosh and a bang and as they got around the corner, they pulled up in what is called the old Irish Moss Plant. That looks the same as it did in 1967. It's still there, right on the edge of the water at the edge of Shag Harbour, and the road is probably no more than fifty feet from the water's edge there. They pulled over in this gravel lot and got out and saw what looked like an object sitting on the water with a pale yellow light on the top, either drifting with the tide or under its own power, heading out to sea. At this point, it was only 800 or 900 feet away from them. The teenagers thought it was an airplane that had just crashed into the harbor. So, Laurie got back in the car with the girls and they went just a little further up the road to another fishing village that is only about half or three-quarters of a mile away called Lower Woods Harbor. There was an Irving's gas station there and a pay phone. Laurie called the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP Mounties) in Barrington Passage which is on the eastern side of Shag Harbour, opposite from their road sighting. Laurie got hold of a Corporal Werbicki who was on duty at the time. Lauri said he thought an airplane had just crashed into the harbor. Werbicki said that another phone line was ringing. He was manning the station by himself. So, he asked Lauri for the telephone number on the pay phone and told him to hang up and he would call him back. But to just stay there for a moment. When he hung up, Corporal Werbicki got two or three more calls from people phoning in saying that an airplane might have crashed into the sound next to Shag Harbour. So, now Werbicki was taking it seriously. After the third phone call, he called Lauri back and asked him if he would go back to where he had seen the thing floating on the water and keep an eye on it until Werbicki could get there. Werbicki hung up with Lauri and called two RCMP officers that were in a cruiser staking out a spot down in Lower Woods Harbor waiting for deer-jackers, which are poachers. Officer Ron Pond and Officer Ron O'Brien. The two Rons. Ron Pond was the rookie and"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"the other fellow is what is called a floating constable. He would travel from detachment to detachment along the south shore, going where needed. After talking to Werbicki , the Mounties headed back to Shag Harbour. In the meantime, Dave Kendrick and Norman Smith two other young fishermen who were only 17 and 18 years old, were coming toward Shag Harbour. Dave Kendrick was driving and Norman Smith, his passenger, mentioned he thought he saw something up in the sky. The young men saw what looked like four to five sequentially flashing amber-colored lights headed down toward the water. Because of the winding road, Dave Kendrick could not keep his eye on them too much because he could go off the road. So Norm Smith got the best view of this thing and he saw it for about 20 seconds before it disappeared behind a treeline. Dave Kendrick dropped off Norm Smith at his home just at the edge of Shag Harbour village limits and he went home and told his mother about what he had seen in the sky. Norm Smith was just going back into the house when he noticed lights in the sky again. So he went running in to get his father and brought him outside. They both watched this thing which looked like it was going to go into the water. While they were watching, they decided they should get some clothes on and go over towards the harbor in case it was an airplane crash and they could help. As they were talking about that, two Mountie cars went by going down toward the harbor which were responding to Lauri Wickens's call. So, why was Norm Smith and his father just seeing an object go into the water? Probably because there was more than one object going into Shag Harbour that night. As a matter of fact, that's confirmed by a couple of military people. One was a radio traffic officer. I was talking to him on the phone and he said, 'You know there were two objects that night.' I said, 'Yes, I suspected it,' but I wasn't 100% sure until he said it. There were other witnesses who saw two objects in the sky. That night was just phenomenal. There was this mini-UFO wave going on the southwestern half of Nova Scotia. If you look at the country on the map, it's stretched out northeast to southwest and then joined on the mainland. But that southwestern part of it, a portion of it, was alive with UFO reports, which is more detailed in my book than I can possibly get into for this phone interview. WHAT WAS THE MOST DRAMATIC ACCOUNT? The most dramatic account was the object going into the water, the Mounties arriving on the site and seeing this pale yellow light floating out on the water. Nobody knew what it was. But anybody who was there will tell you that it was not a buoy light or anything like that. They knew where they all were and not where this thing was. It appeared to be drifting above the water at maybe 10 to 12 feet in the air. It was one of these situations where what you could make out was more an absence of light , rather than seeing the object. But it looked like it was about 60 feet long and possibly 10 to 12 feet thick through a lens shape, your classic UFO object or flying saucer what government documents later called a \"dark object.\" But don't forget now that everyone was thinking that they were seeing an airplane on the water, or at least an airplane that crashed into the water. So, the first thing to do was to try to get to them. There might be survivors or bodies out there. It was a fairly calm, cool, starry night and no moon. Three Mounties arrived - Corporal Victor Werbicki RCMP, was in charge. The other two were constables. Corporal Werbicki decided he would find a couple of fishing boats to get out there and told Ron O'Brien to go and contact the RMCP in Halifax the Rescue Coordination Center, which is a military- operated tri-service operation that can bring in the Navy, Coast Guard, and the helicopters. The rookie, Ron Pond, was left to take down the stories of the witnesses. Now, everybody saw the thing out there, but about the time they decided to do something about it, the yellow light disappeared. They didn't know whether it went out, or sunk. The fishermen got some vessels from the government wharf up in Shag Harbour. They went out through the western approach. This would have been Norman Smith's uncle, Lawrence Smith and Bradford Chand and their boats those were the first two out. Eventually there were six boats up there and then the Coast Guard cutter showed up and there was quite a search effort. Yellow Light and Yellow, Glittering \"Foam\" But the first two boats went out across the sound and encountered the first of the anomalies which was this thick, cream, golden-yellow, glittering 'foam,' as the fishermen"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"described it, the ones we've interviewed. It was really thick on the water, about three to four inches thick. It was about 80 feet wide and about half a mile long. There was a roiling in the water and some bubbling. There was maybe the smell of sulfur in the water. Now, they were thinking this might have something to do with the interaction of jet fuel or some time of aviation fuel with sea water. Th ey didn't know. They were all kind of nervous thinking they were going to find bodies. But they never found anything except this foam. WAS IT GLOWING? It sort of glittered. One of the fisherman said, 'Like as if you took shaving cream.' It didn't look like sea foam. They all knew what sea foam looks like and this wasn't anything like that. If you took sort of shaving cream and sprinkled sort of yellow speckles or gold speckles on it, it had that kind of shimmer to it. Later on, in one of the military documents, it said it was a shame that nobody thought to take a sample, but no one was thinking that they were looking for anything unusual except for bodies. I remember Ron O'Brien telling me that it was so clear that night and quiet out there on the water. They could hear the twin diesels starting up on the Coast Guard cutter over on Clark's Harbor, thirteen miles away. It took the Coast Guard almost an hour to get to Ron O'Brien and gave him a message that the Rescue Coordination Center had done a full military search and even checked down in the eastern U. S. looking for commercial flights and military flights as well. Nothing was missing. Everyone was wondering, 'What the heck were we looking for? What was this that went into the water?' The rest of the story comes after that. The ensuing search. The Navy sent down divers. They were looking for something that might have been on the bottom. Remember, the main part of the incident - or at least the Shag Harbour sighting began around twenty minutes after 11 p.m. on the evening of October 4, 1967. So, we're quickly into October 5, and by October 6, the newspaper in Halifax was taking this pretty seriously particularly the Halifax Chronicle Herald, which has been around for about 200 years in one form or another and is one of the most widely read newspapers in eastern Canada. It's a pretty prestigious newspaper as well. They posted a headline at the top of their newspaper on the following Saturday saying, 'Could Be Something Concrete In Shag Harbour UFO-RCAF.' That was quite a thing for this newspaper to put something like that on their banner headline at the top of the newspaper because it's a pretty conservative rag and still is today. The Chronicle-Herald, Halifax , Nova Scotia, Canada, October 6, 1967. Anyway, the divers were down by Friday afternoon to do a look. They wanted to knock off around 6 p.m. that evening and say they had not found anything. But the word came back from Halifax to stay at it until they were told to stop, which was kind of unusual. So, they kept at it until Sunday night around 8 p.m. Then they were told they could discontinue the search and go back to Halifax. Canadian and American Counterintelligence? There was a portion of the story I've been investigating off and on for the past couple of years which has a connection to the Yukon here where a couple of twin sisters live up there now and claim there father was involved in this thing and he was a captain in the RCAF at Greenwood AFB and was told to go to Halifax to pick up material that had been gathered from the water and taken to Halifax, the Naval Armament Depot there, and then transported to the United States. Some of it is anecdotal and some records, but it's difficult to prove any of it. We do know there was a man by the name of Mace Cofee, Maurice Cofee, who was a psychologist working for the Defense Research Board here in Canada. He was assigned somehow to the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"case. He was the receiver of goods from Shag Harbour and took them and had them investigated at the Naval Armament Depot. Now, we don't know for sure whether this particular stuff that was brought up off the bottom was anomalous or not. But it seems strange to me that if it was anything other than anomalous, why would they put it on a flatbed truck and take it down to the United States? DID YOU EVER GET ANY DETAILS ABOUT WHETHER HIS WORK IN PSYCHOLOGY HAD TO DO WITH COUNTERINTELLIGENCE? I imagine he had something to do with counterintelligence. We touched base eventually with his daughter. (He has since passed away.) She told us she remembered a lot of people in and out of their lives who were involved with the military. There was always some sort of secret thing going on. She would ask him about UFOs on different occasions and he would not talk about it. But of course, the fact he wouldn't talk about it does not make it fact that there was something there. But our subsequent attempts to contact people he worked with long ago have been fruitless. They won't talk to us. HAVE YOU ASKED POINT BLANK, 'DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE FOAM OR THE YELLOW LIGHT IN SHAG HARBOUR ON OCTOBER 4 to 6, 1967? No, there was no one to talk to because no one would talk to us in that regard. WHAT IS THE STRONGEST EVIDENCE, EITHER IN EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY OR DOCUMENTS OR PHYSICAL EVIDENCE THAT YOU'VE COME ACROSS IN YOUR INVESTIGATION, THAT WOULD LINK THE SHAG HARBOUR INCIDENT IN 1967 TO SOMETHING IN THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL REALM? I mentioned the people involved as original witnesses thought it was an airplane. But it was the military that tagged it as a UFO on the documents. There's quite a document trail here, starting with the Air Desk in Ottawa. This is the one that used to handle UFO reports. Squadron Leader Bain, who was in charge that particular night, is the one who made the margin notes on the document stating 'UFO' and he underlined it three times. He is the one that got the search initiated through the Rescue Coordination Center in Halifax to go look on the bottom. The paper trail after that there is a Col. Turner involved. He was the overall coordinator of the search who made no bones about the fact that this could not be explained away by any space junk, could not be explained away by flares, it could not be explained away by aircraft. We have different documents denoting particular occurrences after the fact. For instance, there was a flight of B-52 bombers that went over within 20 to 25 minutes after this heading north. These would have come out of Loring AFB in Maine. One wonders why?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"October 6, 1967 Memorandum from Col. W. W. Turner, Director Operations, Royal Canadian Air Force.
