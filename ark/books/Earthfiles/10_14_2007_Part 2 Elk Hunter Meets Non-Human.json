The goal was to understand more about Carl's encounter with a non-human entity around 4 p.m. after he shot at an elk and saw the bullet drop to the ground on October 25, 1974, in the Medicine Bow National Forest. M argery Higdon wrote on back of 1974 photograph she took: \"Meadow (where) elk were when Carl shot at (one). (Ink circle marks) where Carl was standing.\" Photograph in 1974 by Margery Higdon. When his wife and friends became alarmed that he had not returned home, the Carbon County Sheriff Ogburn and his deputies Ed Tierney, Roy Flemming, Dave Martin, and Harold Shurtz went searching for Carl. Finally, nearly fourteen hours later around 6:30 a.m., Carl Higdon was found and his pickup truck was a good three miles from where he had originally parked it.

The location for the interview and hypnosis was the home of Carl and Margery Higdon whose children are Rose Bryson, age 15; Lilly, age 14; Michael, age 12; and Lyle, age 11. Attending the session were Rick Kenyon, an art teacher from the Rawlins, Wyoming, public schools and Marilyn James. The interview began with a discussion about the October 26, 1974, lab report that Carl Higdon's blood tests were described as \"super blood.\" Prof. Sprinkle used the following code to indicate who was talking during the November 2, 1974, interview: CH = Carl Higdon MH = Margery Higdon RK = Rick Kenyon LS = Leo Sprinkle This Earthfiles transcript below was reprinted from the original onion skin, carbon-copied transcript of November 17, 1974, provided to me by Leo Sprinkle. The session began in conscious discussion between Dr. Sprinkle and Carl Higdon about medical findings after Carl was found by deputies and taken to a hospital. Previously on November 2, 1974, Leo Sprinkle had also talked with Carl Higdon and that discussion will be excerpted in Part 3. Transcript of Interview with Carl Higdon, November 17, 1974 CH I don't know what they mean by \"super blood.\" I guess it is better than normal. LS Right! CH I haven't got hold of the doctor yet. I want to find out for sure. He said there were no spots whatsoever on my lungs. LS This was Dr. Tongca? There had been spots earlier? CH Yes, in 1970. In 1958, they put me in the hospital and said I had TB. Then they found out it came out negative. Nothing to it. They told me to get an x-ray every six months. So when I was in Kimball, I was getting x-ray every six months. Up to 1970, there were still spots. LS Did they say what they were? CH Scar tissue. The last x-rays I got were in 1971. When did we go to Byers? Maybe it was 1970 or 1971, the last x-rays I got. I still had spots on my lungs"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"then, but there is none on it now. LS Now, after this last x-ray, nothing? MH I didn't talk to him yet. He didn't say there was not any. He just said when I asked about if he could be anemic, he just said his blood is better than normal and he said his chest x-rays were OK. CH The first thing they say, if they see spots, they'll ask you about them. MH They will start testing right away. LS Right! MH Anyway, the hospital is being sued right now because they would not admit a drunk. The doctor has been kind of indisposed for the last couple of days. LS Did Roy Flemming tell you that he called me? Did Rick Kenyon tell you that a guy called me who said he was Roy Flemming? (Carbon County Sheriff's Deputy involved in search for Carl Higdon.) CH I was working the last three days and he did not say anything about it. LS Well, a man said that his name was Roy Flemming. He said, \"Do you know who I am?\" I said, \"Yes, because I talked with Carl Higdon.\" He told me that his supervisors had talked with him. One man said that he was interested in the case and wanted to know if it would be possible to get some kind of copy of the recording. I said I had no objections if Rick Kenyon and Carl Higdon had no objections. I said, however, that I felt that they should have a say in it. He said that he had been interested in the case. Also, he said, \"It's not that I don't believe him. But there is some question about what actually went on.\" Then I said, \"Carl has a copy of the recording, also.\" He said, \"Oh, is that right?\" Then he did not say much more. And I haven't heard from him any more. CH: I think it is this old boy right here. (Showing a letter written to Carl Higdon from LeVesque, not identified). LS: UFO Newsletter, Pyramid . I'm familiar with those publications. So, it could be that he is supplying information for these groups. Although if it is the same person, I don't like the idea of someone giving a name. CH: Yeah. LS: It is interesting. RK: Whoever he was, he is well enough versed to know that I was involved and Leo was involved. CH: Well, I don't know why Roy would call. RK: Roy would drive up to my house. CH: I talked to Roy here one evening. I told him just as quick as I got all this stuff together that I would give it to him. That has been two weeks ago. He was welcome to read everything that went on - the tapes, too. MH: If they ever call again like that, just tell them they can come down to the house and listen to them. If that is them, OK. If not...? RK: I'd have them meet me in a certain place. Hypnosis of Carl Higdon by Leo Sprinkle, Ph.D. [ Leo Sprinkle gave hypnotic suggestions to Carl Higdon for regression to the UFO experience and review of events.] CH: I see the elk in the clearing. I raised the gun to shoot. I could see the bullet coming out of the gun. Walked down, bent over, picked up the bullet, steadied the gun in my right hand. When I heard the branch snap, I swung, put my left hand back on the gun, holding the gun down."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"LS: Now you can remember what happened. T his transcript in October 2007 was typed from the original November 17, 1974, onion skin, carbon copies of the hypnosis session with Carl Higdon, typed by secretaries from audiotape for then Leo Sprinkle, Ph.D., Director of Counseling and Testing, University of Wyoming, Laramie, Wyoming. Original carbon transcript provide by Dr. Sprinkle. CH: Shifted and put the gun in my left hand, taking the bullet out of my right, with my right, put it in the canteen pouch. (Pause) 7 mm bullet that Carl Higdon saw drop straight down to the ground about 50 feet from where Carl shot his rifle at an elk around 4 p.m., October 25, 1974, 40 miles south of Rawllins, Wyoming, in the Medicine Bow National Forest. Original Polaroid photograph taken in November 1974 by Leo Sprinkle, Ph.D. LS: OK. So that helps explain what happened when you were picking up the bullet. Then at that time, did you...? CH: I did this at the time I was turning around. LS: While you were turning around. You had heard a sound? CH: I heard this sound. Then this man was standing up on the side of the hill by the trees ... shaded. LS: About how far away did he seem to be? CH: Oh, 50 or 70 feet. Really couldn't tell his facial features too good at that point. He walked toward me. Then I could see that he wasn't one of our planet. Then the pills. He says, \"Are you hungry?\" I told him, \"Maybe a little.\" He threw a package of pills. I took one. He wanted to know if I wanted to go with them. And I said, \"Might as well.\" The next thing we was inside this cubicle-type of office. It was kind of transparent. LS: Could you see through it so you could see trees? CH: You could see trees through it. You could look down and see the ground. Then he pointed at this lever on the front, and then the next thing you could"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"see a ball below, like a basketball, where the ground was there before. Then we landed where the lights were bright. LS: Did it seem like the lights were bright all around, like during the day? Or at night? CH: It must be night because the lights were in a confined area. Like artificial light, not sunlight. They only case out maybe 100 yards in a circle. Real bright, different colors. (Pause) Then there was a shield! (Raising his hand.) LS: A shield comes up? CH: Yeah, they're pushing it towards me. Then I'm behind the shield. Then they take it way. LS: Did they say what the shield was for? CH: No. Only one talked: Ausso. LS: Did you see anyone else beside him with the shield? CH: No. Just him. The shield just slides, kinda rolls. I told them, \"The lights hurt.\" The sun, our sun, burns them. I'm not what they want. They'll take me back. (Pause) Then, they kind of drifted me down, or beamed me down. I was standing flat-footed on the side of the hill when they left. Then, I slept and rolled over the rocks to the ground. Then I got up and started walking down the road. LS: And your rifle? CH: Rifle? I had it in my hand. I walked down the road. Seen the pickup. Passed the pickup. A mile or so down the road, I turned around and came back to the pickup. I heard a woman talking. I tried to talk to her on the radio and she wouldn't answer. I kept trying and Roy Flemming (Carbon County Sheriff's Deputy) got on the radio. We talked for a long time. They come and got me. (Pause) LS: OK. Can you recall anything else at that time that was unclear before? CH: The pickup just ... disappeared. LS: The pickup disappeared? When did that happen? T wo-wheel drive pickup, which Carl Higdon drove up to the Medicine Bow National Forest on October 25, 1974, to go elk hunting. Photograph in 1974 by Leo Sprinkle, Ph.D. CH: Oh, when we got above the trees a little ways, then the pickup disappeared. LS: So when the cubicle was up above the trees? CH: But I didn't see where they put it. LS: Did you see how it happened?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"CH: He (entity) just pointed his arm at the pickup, his right arm, and it disappeared. LS: Did you look at the cubicle? Did you see anything else around the cubicle? You said you saw levers before. CH: Just a big star on the left-hand side of the levers, up a ways. LS: The star was similar to the star he had on his belt? And you said you saw some letters on the levers? On the knobs of the levers, or on the sides? CH: On the side. LS: Can you look closely to see if you can focus on them? Can you see those letters? CH: Can't see them. LS: Can you see anything else beside the levers? How many levers can you see? CH: Three. LS: And are there slots? CH: Up and down. LS: Can you estimate how long the slots were? CH: About six or eight inches on the first. About an inch shorter on the next one. Then, about an inch and a half shorter on the last one. They're just smaller levers as you go that way. I don't know what they're for. LS: OK. How long were the levers? Could you estimate that? CH: About six, four and two. LS: Inches? CH: Yeah. LS: Do they have a knob on them? CH: Knob on each one. Black, like a shifting knob on a pickup. LS: About that same size? CH: Graduated down to different sizes. LS: How big would you estimate the diameter of the first one? CH: About an inch and a half in diameter. The other one was about an inch and the other one was about a half-inch. LS: Did you see any of the knobs move? CH: Only the big one - down. LS: Can you see anything else around the lever? Were they on any type of object? CH:: Just a little square box, like kind of round over to the back and down to the floor, but it is transparent, too. There's nothing coming off of it. LS: Could you estimate the size of the box? Or how high it was? CH: Well, I would say about two feet high. About a foot flat across the front. The back about five inches, towards the wall and curved down. LS: So it was wider at the base than it was at the top? CH: No. It was narrow at the base, about four inches wide from the wall out. Then it come up and it curved out to a flat surface about a foot to the front to the three levers. LS: OK. Maybe later on you can draw a sketch of that."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"CH: Yeah. C ontrol panels with levers at lower right. Four \"identical\" reclining \"transparent\" seats in middle of small cubicle room. \"Cage with 5 elk\" in lower left. Unidentified symbol in upper right. Drawing by Carl Higdon. LS: Is there anything else you can see beside the big star on the left-hand lever? CH: No. Oh! The mirror on the top right-hand corner. The elk - I can see in behind me. In the cage like a door. LS: A cage-like door? Bars or? CH: Cross pieces. Like a corral, only built all the way to the top. LS: You could see them (elk)? Do they seem to be moving? Or do they seem to be still? CH: Still. Like stuffed animals. Standing just like they were in the same position. LS: Were they in the same position in relation to each other - like when they were in the clearing? CH: They are sideways to me now. They look just about the same. LS: OK. So you can tell there is a mirror on top of the right-hand corner of the cubicle? You can see the elk reflected in the mirror? CH: (Nodding and pause) Power. What powers the craft? All you could see was kinda, not really daylight and not really dark. They power it by \"magnetic force\" - no sound. LS: This is what you were told? CH: Ausso said. LS: Ausso said what? CH: Powered by magnetic force. LS: Did he say anything about the pickup? CH: No. LS: When he moved the hand toward the pickup and the pickup disappeared was there any sound? CH: No. LS: Did he talk to you any time about the rifle? CH: Primitive weapon. Just for food. He wanted to keep my gun."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"LS: He could not - He was not allowed to? CH: He said he couldn't. He didn't say why not. LS: Is there anything else he wanted to keep? CH: No. LS: Did he say anything else about the craft? CH: No. LS: When he talked, did you see his teeth? CH: Not really, just when he opened his mouth wide. He had three teeth on top and three on the bottom. None on the sides. He didn't open his mouth very wide, only maybe to yawn or something. LS: You remember him opening his mouth sometime? CH: Just yawning after they took the shield away. LS: Did he say anything else about the shield? How long was the shield? Was the shield between him and you? CH: Yes. I couldn't see him when the shield was there. It was about - oh, I am not sure how big. It would be - well, with normal height, it would be about four feet and about eight feet high. It blocks out all vision. You can't see nothing except the shield. LS: What did the shield look like? CH: It looked like a wall coming toward me. LS: Did it look like it was made out of metal? Could you tell any texture? CH: Kinda glassy-like. You couldn't see through it. Like maybe slate, but it was real glossy. LS: Glossy? Could you tell how thick it was? CH: No. I didn't get to see the side. It come from the front. LS: Could you estimate how long the shield was in front of you? CH: Oh, about four or five minutes. LS: During that time, was the helmet on your head? CH: No. We were standing up. LS: You were standing up - so you didn't have the bands around your arms or legs? CH: No. We were out, we weren't in this craft. LS: You were outside the cubicle, outside the craft? CH: We were inside this big (sounded puzzled) - oh, I can't describe it - like a tower. But it looked too skinny to be inside it."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"\"5 people (humans) on platform\" waiting at \"tower\" where Carl Higdon described going up in an elevator with the entity Ausso. Drawing by Carl Higdon. LS: So it is hard to know how you could be inside, but it seemed that you were inside that big tower? CH: We were going up an elevator. LS: So that tower, when you saw the lights, it seemed like you were inside it and going up an elevator. CH: On the inside, behind the lights. It's not so bright here. There's other people. Not them (entities), but people like us (humans). Three ... five - standing by the door. Going back. LS: Back in time? Back to see those people? CH: No. Back in the building. LS: OK, go back and see what you see. CH: It's dim. Then the shield. We go down a tube, like an elevator. Didn't see nobody. Then we're back outside, back in the craft. Then I could see two girls, a bigger girl, a boy, then the old man - maybe 50 or 60. LS: Did you talk to anybody when you were up in the elevator or inside the tower? CH: No. LS: Did anyone talk to you? CH: Just Ausso. LS: What did he say during that time? CH: He was talking about fishing and hunting and exploring our country. He just kept talking. Nothing important, really, just small talk. Looking for birds, animals. They don't want nothing but animals. LS: Did he say what kind of animals they like? CH: No, just animals. LS: They want animals or food? CH: Food. Places to breed them on their planet. LS: Did he say anything else about their planet? CH: Fish. They don't have no place to keep them (fish), so they have to keep coming back after them, out in the ocean. LS: Did he say why they don't have any place to keep them? CH: Their sea won't take care of them. They die. Not enough oxygen or something. They don't know for sure."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"LS: But they can breed other animals? CH: Yeah. Our animals can live up there just like down here. But the fish - they've got a certain oxygen, or iodine, or something, Ausso says, that they're trying to find out what it is. LS: Did he say anything else about the planet: social, political or economic? CH: No. Just he's a hunter or explorer. That's all Ausso does. LS: Did he say anything about anybody else? Are there other people who do other kinds of things? CH: He didn't say. LS: Did you ever have an opportunity to be very close to Ausso One? CH: 30 feet, maybe. According to size, I can't tell for sure. LS: Were you close enough to touch him? CH: No, can't touch him. LS: He wouldn't let that? CH: No. LS: How about when you were sitting in the chair? Did he seem closer then in the craft? CH: Maybe 20 feet, according to the way the seats were, straight across. But (sounding puzzled) the cubicle ain't that big. LS: So it just seemed that way? Maybe later on you can draw a diagram or sketch of where the seats were in relation to one another. CH: Yeah. The \"force fields\" are around all of them and me. You can move, but can't reach out too far. Unless the \"force field\" expands, he said. That's the way they travel without helmets or any type of oxygen gear, through magnetic force. LS: So that they can move on our planet without the use of the helmet, because they can regulate the size of the \"force field\"? CH: They got oxygen inside the force field. LS: Did Ausso say that they use oxygen at the same level, at the same rate, as on this planet Earth? CH: He didn't say nothing about it, except that if our animals could live there, it seems like the oxygen would be about the same. LS: Did he say that they can move without walking? CH: Freely. LS: Is there some other way of transporting themselves? CH: No. They don't touch the ground. He uses his right arm to point where he wants to go and he goes. He moves freely. No, he said, \"We move freely anywhere we ant to go ... any WHERE we want to go. LS: Is this the way Ausso did when he was on the elevator? He would point? CH: I don't remember walking. (puzzled) We had to move some way. I can't remember moving from one place to another, other than being here and then there. He didn't say nothing about how you could get there and back. You just move freely. LS: Can you recall the inside of the tower elevator? How high the were the rooms? Or the hall? Or the elevator? CH: About normal size. LS: Like eight feet high?"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"CH: The hall was about six feet wide. The room we were in was big: 24 by maybe 30 feet. Nothing there. LS: That was the room where the shield was? CH: The room is empty. There's nothing there, but the room. Nothing in it. And the shield comes from the side out of the wall. LS: Did Ausso One point at the shield. CH: No. I stood up on a little platform in the room. The shield come out, stayed four or five minutes, and then went back into the wall. I stepped down and we walked back down the hall. LS: You remember walking down the hall? CH: Down the hall. We walked back down the hall. The door opened and we stepped on a platform and went down. We got down and walked through another hall to a door. Stepped outside the door and then we didn't walk any more. We just were here ... and then there. LS: Then you were back out and settling in the cubicle? CH: Back in the cubicle. I seen the five people standing in the doorway, going in. LS: Going in? CH: Platform - must be a platform, or something, that opens the door. When you land on the platform, or stop, then the door opens. Then you have to walk on inside. Then we're back in the cubicle. There's the five people. Ausso said, \"We'll take you back.\" Nobody with him, but he said, \"We.\" LS: You didn't see anybody else? CH: I didn't see nobody else. LS: Did Ausso talk further after that? Did he say anything else to you? CH: No. (Pauses) Ausso said, \"We'll set you down close to where you were, about two miles, I guess.\" LS: When was it that you were told that you weren't what they needed? In the tower? CH: No. That was in the cubicle. We were back in the cubicle and I told him the lights hurt my eyes. He said the sun burns them. He'd take me back, that I wasn't what they wanted ... needed. LS: He said that to you after you had been in the tower and the shield, and after coming back to the cubicle? CH: After we had been in the tower, in front of the shield, and back to the cubicle. Then he said, \"You're not what we need. We'll take you back.\" LS: Was that when the pills? CH: The pills were in my shirt pocket. Went up towards the \"star\" on the left-hand side and they stopped. They stayed there (sounded puzzled). Maybe there was a shelf - transparent or something. They just laid there. LS: After that, when they said they would take you back, then did you remember how much time the craft hovered over where the pickup was? CH: Oh, I can't really determine the time. Maybe 30 minutes or so somewhere along there. LS: Anything else happened at that time? Could you see the mirror at that time? There on the right-hand side? CH: There's nothing back there anymore. LS: Can you see the cross arms? CH: No cage."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"LS: No cage? Still the same number of chairs? Four chairs? CH: Four. LS: Four chairs, but nobody else there besides you and Ausso One? CH: No. Nothing behind as - through the mirror - there's nothing there, not even the cage. LS: And did he move any lever when you started back? CH: Same one - the first one. He moved it down. I don't know what them other two levers were for. LS: How about when you were getting out, when he was going to set you down? Did he point toward you or did he move a lever? CH: First he just moved a little. First lever down just a little. Then (sounding puzzled) I was on the ground. LS: Did he say anything to you when you were going? CH: No. \"We'll see you.\" LS: He said \"We'll see you\"? Did you think he meant he would come back again? Or was it just a friendly goodbye? CH: Just a friendly goodbye, probably, the way he said \"We'll see you.\" Then, this little lever moved and - Whit!!! - I was on the ground! LS: Do you remember how the rifle got in your hands? CH: It was setting by the seat. Ausso just had it elevated in front of him, looking at it. Then he had it move over and set down by the seat where I was settin'. When I left, he said, \"We'll see you.\" I grabbed hold of the rifle and the next thing, I was on the ground. LS: You don't remember how you got from the seat? CH: From the seat to the ground, I don't know. I just went like that! (Moved hands) And I was gone! LS: Before that, were there bands over your arms and legs coming back? CH: Yeah. No helmet though. LS: No helmet? But then, do you remember the bands being released? CH: No. LS: Just gone from the seat and then down? CH: Yeah. LS: Did you feel yourself going down? CH: No. Just like I say - you are sitting here and then you are over there. Don't feel nothing. LS: Then you were flat-footed there on the ground? With the rifle? CH: Set down facing towards where later I found the pickup. But my left foot was up a little and my right was down on the side of the hill. Then, a rock slipped and I rolled to the bottom, which was about eight feet or nine feet. Then I got up and I was in the road. I just walked back down the road towards the north and it curved back around towards the west. The pickup was down, just outside the clearing, down in the bottom. No way you could drive a pickup in there. LS: No trail in there? CH: A road, but it was bad! LS: Rough road? CH: Ditches, tire tracks wore down way below, and you would high center"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"anything on there. LS: Kina rough to remember that feeling? (Carl rubbed neck and shoulder) OK. Just work on that and say now you are going to get past that event and the pain is going to be gone. In a few minutes, the pain will be gone. You'll be able to ease that shoulder and that neck. You'll feel better than ever. So that if you ever go through that experience again, you'll be able to do so without discomfort. You'll be able to ease that pain in the neck and shoulder and there'll be no discomfort associated with that experience. But if there is any feeling, itt will be something that will remind you of the experience, reality of it and the significance it has for you. There's no need to have the discomfort and you can let the feeling to away, just let it disappear. But if there is any significance to the discomfort, you can use it, you can use it to recall any other feelings or memories of the experience. Then you can recall it, describe it, and add to the basic description of the event. OK. As you relax deeper and deeper, now mentally, just quickly review. You can go through your mind quickly, like a series of shots, and see if there is anything else that occurred that you didn't describe, that might be significant or important. You can find yourself going back to the crest of the hill, seeing the elk, lifting the rifle, firing, seeing the bullet, picking it up,, turning, talking to the man (Ausso), being in the cubicle, going to the other place, getting out of the cubicle, being in the tower, walking along, going to the big room, the shield. Does the shield, is the shield for an examination? Were you told what the shield was for? CH: No. LS: Then going back through the hall, back to the end of the tower, back to the cubicle, being told that you would be going back, the lever moving down, back to the spot where the pickup was, then being glided down. Now, without the discomfort in the shoulders. Now anything else that might be important in terms of the hospital? OK, fine. Doing a good job remembering. Later on, if there is anything else which does occur in terms of remembering, you'll be able to recall and describe it. Now feeling good about being able to have gone back, feeling good about recalling events, knowing that the experience is over. At the same time, any time you wish, you can always go back to the experience. You can recall without discomfort. There is a feeling of satisfaction of experiencing something significant. Also, feeling good that the experience is over. Now, whenever you wish, you can remember these experiences, remember the memories, remember the impressions, knowing that this experience will be there in terms of memory and also that it has a good feeling associated with it.
