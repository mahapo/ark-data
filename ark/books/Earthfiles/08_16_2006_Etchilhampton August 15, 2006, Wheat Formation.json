Wayland's Smithy is in the upper right corner of Oxfordshire County near Blowingstone H ill a nd U f fington C a s tle . Some other 2006 crop formation locations are highlighted in yellow. August 16, 2006 Etchilhampton, Wiltshire, England - British researcher and photographer, Lucy Pringle, has photographed the new August 15, 2006, Etchilhampton formation from the air, while on the ground the Cropcircleconnector.com's Julian Gibsone reports: \" Complexity within this wonderful new Star. This a beautiful new formation with an intricate line structure and a lovely star shaped centre. As I wandered around this circle I became aware of just how interesting the line structure was. This is a case of where seeing a formation on the ground is as significant as seeing it from the air. The lay, appeared to me at least, to be pretty impressive in crop that is about to be cut in the next few days. ... The location was outstanding as one could look across Pewsey Vale to the Milk Hill White Horse, Woodborough and Picton Hills in the distance.\" On August 17, 2006, Lucy Pringle emailed after visiting the formation to measure: \"We measured the formation and from the point-to-point of each axis, it measured 332 feet. The narrow lines measured between 9-10 inches each. We should have measured the diameter of the circle, but forgot. If you reckon that the width of the area between the tramlines is 60 feet, we can arrive at an educated estimate of a diameter between 160-180 feet approximately.\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"E tchilhampton wheat formation reported August 15, 2006.
