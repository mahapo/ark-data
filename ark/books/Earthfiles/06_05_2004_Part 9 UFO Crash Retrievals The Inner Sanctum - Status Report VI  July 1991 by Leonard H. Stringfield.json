Len Stringfield: \" THE NURSE ('Mary') Abstract of a discussion March 16, 1991, with a retired operating room nurse who was assigned to the Medical Lab at Los Alamos during WWII and sometime afterward. The source is Tim Cooper. Tim Cooper Report: 'Subject: Bodies being flown to Los Alamos (National Laboratory, New Mexico) by military aircraft; and atomic explosion near Indian Springs (New Mexico) prior to the Trinity test. According to 'Mary,' Los Alamos was classified as a 'Green Base,' which means it had the highest priority to conduct radical research under the MED program during the 1940s. Everyone had to have a 'Q' clearance just to be inside the facility. She casually mentioned to me over coffee that 'bodies' had been flown to Los Alamos periodically from late 1945 to sometime in 1947. I asked her if she had seen those 'bodies' and she said she had not, but others had. I asked her where the 'bodies' were coming from. She said she did not know, but it was rumored that they were human experiments for biological and nuclear medicine research. She thought they might have come from Japan after the war. (WWII ended in August 1945) I asked her why she thought that. She said that they were small bodies with deformed heads and limbs. The eyes were abnormally bit she was told. She did have some view of them in the morgue very briefly for a few minutes at some distance. I asked her why she was allowed to be present at the autopsies. She told me that she was asked to assist in the preparation and cleanup. At the time, Mary thought nothing of it because some civilians were exposed to an atomic explosion in Nevada (this was not known by the public. Only the Trinity explosion test was released to the public.) I was shocked to learn this. She said she knew what she was talking about. 'It happened,' she replied. I asked her again about the bodies. She said they were flown in on special transport planes equipped with refrigerator units to keep the bodies from decomposing. The flesh was badly burned and charred. There was no hair on their heads and (the beings) had a grayish-yellow color. That's all she knew. (See the Collins interview. This story by Mary seems to have some commonality with his story of bodies being sent to Berkeley from Los Alamos.)' "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" 'DR. EPIGONI' Ron Madeley of Houston, Texas, is my intermediary for this informative and perhaps unique interview with a 'Who's Who' scientist, the pseudonymous 'Dr. Epigoni.' Ron is a competent business person and as a researcher has proved that he knows his way around to get to the right places for 'inside' information. Mentally alert but blunt, even gruff in his demeanor and manner of speech, Epigoni's claim is that he was influentially active in the days of the Manhattan Project and that his colleagues were Dr. Albert Einstein, Dr. Robert Oppenheimer and Dr. Edward Teller. Because of his position in highly secret work, some of the information he disclosed to Ron during the interview he deleted, such as the name of a UFO project he headed. He substituted a false name for it, 'Blue Heaven.' While I can understand the change to Blue Heaven (to protect a secret project's real name), Epigoni's other corrections I thought were odd enough to be interesting food for thought. For purposes of evaluation, I have published both the Doctor's original disclosures and his corrections. Following is Ron Madeley's report: Ron Madeley Report: 'On April 11, 1990, I had the opportunity to visit a former government scientist. This, our second meeting, occurred in his (Houston) home. I recorded this conversation and agreed not to use his real name in any form of reproduction. Dr. Epigoni, as I will call him, is a retired physicist who is nearing 80 years in age and in fair, but steadily declining health. His knowledge might soon follow his name into quiet obscurity, even though he has worked closely with equally brilliant men - men like J. R. Oppenheimer; Albert Einstein; and Dr. Edward Teller, 'Father' of the hydrogen bomb. As early as 1939, Epigoni was working with the great minds of the day at two research laboratories in New Jersey. That work eventually led to a U. S. Navy post under the direction of John von Neuman. Epigoni worked at the top of the Manhattan Project with the development and detonation of the atomic bomb and later the first hydrogen bomb. Dr. Epigoni found himself involved in the research end, as opposed to the retrieval end, of crashed flying saucers. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, he was part of a team of scientists working at Edwards Air Force Base on a very special project. According to Epigoni, a flying saucer and its crew landed at Edwards A.F.B. The disc and its occupants were carted off to a secure building at the base for evaluation. It then became part of an 'Above Top Secret' project - something he calls 'Blue Heaven.' Q. Do you think that (disc) is the only one they've got? A. I don't know. That was the only one I was ever allowed to see. Q. Is this thing kept in a hangar out there? Or is it kept underground? Or what? A. It is kept in a big hangar. They've got guards all around that thing and I'm talking about guards! And there isn't any way you can get through. And I don't give a damn what you do. They've got all types of security there. You've got four rows of guards before you get there and twelve of the damn big barbed wire fences electrified. Q. How did you get in there to see it? A. Well, I was brought in there. I was head of the program. Q. What was the program called? A. It was called 'Blue Heaven.' Q. How many other people were involved? A. Several. Oh, there could have been hundreds. I don't know how many were involved. Q. That actually knew about it - that saw (the disc) there? A. People worked in different forms for parts of the military, you know. But, the day I was taken out there, a lieutenant and a major general were there and I had two lab assistants. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Q. What year were you on that project when you were head of it? A. That's been twenty years ago. Q. Any idea where this (disc) came from? A. I have no idea whatsoever. I examined the 'men.' Felt them. Their eyes were like a dog's eyes - one color. They had ears, a nose, mouth. They had teeth in their mouth and I could not tell if they were growing in there, or if they were made in there, or what. Q. How tall were they? A. I'd say that they were about five feet tall. They were laying down. Q. How many of them were there? A. Twelve of them, I believe. Q. Were they all dressed? A. Yes. Q. All dressed the same? A. Yes, in a silvery-looking material. It was real bright shiny material. It had not even tarnished. They tried to analyze it and it had elements that we don't have on Earth. Q. Now the bodies - or whatever they were - did you cut into them? A. They would not cut into them. All they would do was take a sample of the blood, or whatever it was, and show it to you. And the ample they took was less than 1cc. You put it under a microscope and looked at it and there was not a damn thing in it. It looked like oil. Q. Any idea about whether there were any organs in the body? A. Well, they x-rayed them and all that, but all that information was given to the medical people. Q. What area were you over (in the project)? You weren't over the medical? A. No, I was strictly on the aircraft (engineering). I was not even supposed to go in where those beings were. This major general was the one who allowed me to go in there with him. And I felt their arms, their legs, and I felt around on them. I said, 'Are they stiff?' He answered, 'No.' I asked, 'Can I lift the leg up?' He answered, 'Don't touch anything.' I asked if I could take the 1cc of liquid with me. I was told not to. Q. Did it have any color to it? A. It was sort of a milky color. Q. What about the bodies themselves? A. They were a light brown color. And you could feel their ribs. They had bone structure, but whether that was real bone or metal or something else, I don't know. They (U.S. researchers) came to the conclusion that since there was no deterioration, to leave them alone because another craft might come in the area and rejuvenate or reactivate them. At such time, they might open that craft and allow them in. But we were not to discuss anything about war or - well, I started to say - 'If you could make people like that and give them guns and send them to war instead of soldiers ...' When I said that, boy, I was shut up in a hurry! (Don't) Mention nothing about war or fighting or hurting anybody. Q. Who was actually above you who was telling you this? A. The major general. Q. Do you remember who he was? A. (Name given was deleted by Ron Madeley) "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Q. How long had they had the (disc) vehicle and the bodies at that time? A. They told me for seven years. They said (the disc) landed out there and legs came down out of it and held it up. Something like a stairway came out of the bottom of it and these (humanoid) men walked down the steps and walked out there where the (U.S. government) people were. And all of a sudden, the stairway closed back up. And the legs closed back up and the spacecraft sat back down on the ground. I said I want to feel that craft and see if I can feel if there is an opening. He said, 'You can feel if you want to, but it's as smooth as it is anywhere else.' There were no seams in it whatsoever. I figured it had some kind of molecular structure where it would give and open up and when it would close, it would reseal itself. Of course, the Air Force thought that was the wildest idea they had ever heard. You could not find any seams on it. No rivets. No welding. You would think there would be ruts on it or welding. It was a big disc. And right up there on top of that disc, you could look in there. It was glass. It looked like glass, but it was not glass. You cold shine a flashlight down in there and see instruments and things. I would not have any idea what they (instruments) were, what they do, or anything else. Q. Was this glass part like a dome in the top of (the disc)? A. Yes. And not only that, there were four seats up there, where four guys would sit. And there were all kinds of controls in there. Q. Did you actually look inside it yourself? A. Yeah! I walked up to it and they had a carpet. You go up a ladder, up a stairway, and get on this carpet and you were not to walk on the craft. All the way around this dome, they had this carpet. You could walk around it and see almost all there was to see inside of that hole. Q. Was this glass or plastic, this transparent material solid, just one piece? A. All solid. There was not any seams where it joined the craft. Q. Was it clear or tinted? A. No, it was clear. And I was getting ready to tap on it and they stopped me. I wanted to tap on it to see what it sounded like. They said it was a material that they had not discovered - never dreamed could exist. They had not figured out how to cut a hole through it. They had a lot of machinery in there, big machinery and equipment in that building. They undoubtedly had been doing a lot of experiments trying to figure out how to get into that thing (disc). Q. Where were the bodies kept in relation to the vehicle? A. In a room, like a hospital room. They made you go through a decontamination room and another decontamination room before you went in there. After you came out of there, you had to go through two more decontamination rooms. Q. Was this room inside the hangar, or outside it? A. It was in the hangar. It's upstairs. The hangar was a tall building. It had a deck up there. The ceiling was about 10 feet high and the room that we were in was about 40 x 40 feet. They had all kinds of medical machines, all kinds of x-rays in there. Q. Were the bodies just kept out? Or were they in any sort of case? A. They were out. Of course, the temperature and humidity in there was maintained perfectly, as the air was at the time that they arrived. I don't know. Every one of them told me the same thing: those were not dead (beings). If they were dead, they would have already started decomposing. They are either alive and in a state of suspended animation; or they are activated by another craft or by someone in another craft. Q. Did you see any of the bodies that were animated? That were not in the suspended animation state, but were physically walking around? A. Inside? Q. Or anywhere? "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"A. Oh, no. No. I've never seen one walking around. And I investigated about 25 closed sites. At many of those sites, you could check the plants and see traces where the beings walked around. We had to keep people out of those areas. Q. Was this part of the work that you were doing with the government group? A. Yeah. When we would get there, we would bring out (deleted by Ron). The ground was never burned or singed. Nothing would grow because the ground had gotten real hot. It would take a few years for that land to be able to regerminate. Q. So, you would go in (to a craft location) and check out these cases with other people still as part of the research that you were doing with this (government) organization? A. Yeah. Whenever they had a landing, we would be there. Q. Do you remember what year you stopped doing this? A. It was about 1971 or 1972. But in that area of New Mexico to California, we had about 40 or 50 landings. Q. In what length of time are we talking about? A. A time of about five years. Q. Do you know if this project is still around today? A. Yes. Q. It is still active? A. Yes.\" Q. Do you remember what year they actually started the project? A. No. I have no idea when it was started. Q. So you were brought in after it began. A. The guy's place that I took started leaking out information and I replaced him. Now I was not the only one. I was one of the scientists that worked on it. There was, well ... I can't name them ... Q. This was the U. S. Air Force that was over this project? A. No, it was the Department of Defense. Now the Navy had two or three of the research projects like this one. Q. How far up does information about this go? Does the President know about this? A. Oh, yeah. We had several special meetings with the President. Q. The President at the time would have been Nixon? A. Yeah, he got into all that damn mess. I answered some of his questions. Q. You know that Jackie Gleason, the comedian/actor that died recently. He reportedly saw bodies down at Homestead A.F.B. in Florida and that President Nixon supposedly got him clearance to see them. A. There were some at Homestead. Actually, it was right behind Homestead. It's one of the most secure bases. It is well protected. Q. Do you think that the astronauts know about it? A. I don't know. At the time I worked for the government, I was never supposed to discuss it with anybody. Q. Right. What was the level of security on this? A. It was Top Secret. The very top. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Q. Top Secret? Or above top secret? A. It was above that. It went from the President through the Director of the CIA to us. Q. Did he (President) ever have a group that represented him? A. Yeah, he had a whole bunch of scientists there. There must have been 25 to 30 in his office. They sat in chairs on that side and we sat on this side and they would ask us questions. Q. Was this in D. C. or at Edwards AFB where these meetings were held? A. No, they were in Washington, D. C. Q. Given the level that you were at and the speed at which you were progressing, how far do you think that project has gotten today? A. I haven't any idea.\" Dr. Epigoni later referred to the group of scientists that were with the President during these briefings at the White House and called them the Special Committee. In our previous meeting (in June 1989), we discussed the properties of matter and anti-matter. He believes that some of the flying saucers that our government has recovered are being powered by a type of anti-matter drive. Dr. Epigoni said that you would need to pass an electrical current around a tube that was capped on both ends with metal. Then, particles would be forced through one end of the tube. Protons and anti-protons would collide to release anti-matter. The process, Epigoni stated, could be quite dangerous if one end of the tube should fail to hold.'\" Continued in Part 10.
