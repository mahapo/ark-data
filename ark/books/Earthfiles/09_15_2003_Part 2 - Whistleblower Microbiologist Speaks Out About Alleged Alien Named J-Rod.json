Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Part 2 - Whistleblower Microbiologist Speaks Out About Alleged \"Alien\" Named J-Rod © 2002 by Linda Moulton Howe Interview, Part 2 conducted on September 19, 2002, and withheld a year until now: September 19, 2002 videotaped interview with B ill Hamilton. Photograph © 2003 by William F. Hamilton. Bill Hamilton: HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANY SIMILAR ACTIVITY AT THE PAPOOSE LAKE SITE, S-4? 4-3. Level 3, which is basically considered the housing unit. It's also been called various things. It's been called the Museum. It's been called the Housing Unit. It's been called the Hall of Tortures. An animal retention facility. One of the horrifying things about the S-4 facility is traveling in the elevator system. There is enough of a sound conduit in the elevator system where you can hear the sounds of the test subjects from the third floor while you are in the elevators on various other floors. And the sounds are akin to what I heard at the Dulce facility. Every once in awhile you can hear the sounds of other vertebrates, dogs, cats, monkeys screaming - some of which are natural behaviors due to how they are being kept. Very sterile. When I say sterile, I mean not conducive to a play environment. More of a housing facility like a kennel. Then you occasionally hear are the sounds you know are one of your brothers or sisters. NOW, J-ROD WAS KEPT ON THE 5TH LEVEL, THE BOTTOM MOST LEVEL TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE IN A CLEAN ENVIRONMENTAL....? Pressurized hydrogen clean sphere, yes. PART OF WHAT WAS THE ATMOSPHERIC MIXTURE THAT J-ROD WAS BREATHING - WAS THAT DIFFERENT FROM OUR OWN OXYGEN- NITROGEN ATMOSPHERE IN WHAT RESPECT? In the respect that the larger partial pressure of the environment was hydrogen and in so doing, we have a pressurization and temperature difference. It was an extremely cold facility within the clean sphere and there was insufficient oxygen within the gaseous mixture to support human life, human as we understand it presently. In other words, if I would have been introduced into the clean sphere not wearing a TBS (sp?), I would die fairly rapidly from asphyxiation and from cold. WAS THE MIXTURE FLAMMABLE? Yes. Flammable - not flammable at the temperature that it was being maintained. BECAUSE IT WAS A COLD TEMPERATURE? "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" It was extremely cold, yes. I don't remember the exact number. It was a long time ago since I was in there. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME? 1994? 1995? 1995, I believe. You're probably referring back to the Q-94 document. YES. That is in fact a date. The 94 is in fact a date. And the number would be 109 - the infamous 109 (Is it 109-A? or 1098?) B, C, D and E. Unfortunately, the rest of the document did not leak. Sorry, I just thought about how it got out by helping my friends. THIS REQUEST, WHICH I GUESS YOU TURNED DOWN (PAPILLOMA VIRUS) AT DULCE AND THEY WEREN'T TOO HAPPY ABOUT, I'M SURE. I turned down the request the following morning at which point, I was threatened to be maintained as a permanent resident. I asked them whether or not I would be taken to the Kennel, so to speak - would that be the result of my residency. They kind of laughed it off almost carelessly. I was transported later that afternoon back to the Air Force Base near Nellis where I was taken back to Watertown where I was released to my own recognizance and back to my residence. DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU GAINED FURTHER INSIGHT ABOUT WHAT THE PROGRAM IS ABOUT AND WHAT MAJESTIC IS DOING? I know full well what Majestic is doing on a few different levels. I don't know all of the activities. I wouldn't be privy to them, but I know full well the activities involving the association of the J-Rods - I know full well that the work that they have undergone involving Rain Dancer - which is a compartmentalized project within the chemtrail project - and I know full well what they are involved with regard to BCW work (biological-chemical warfare) involving the retro-viruses. a) I agree with trying to help, but moving cautiously. b) The second of the two, I am in disagreement with the philosophy because it was the employment of a hela???? restriction virus, and (probably helicase) c) I'm in total disagreement at the moral and ethical reasons. WAS THERE ANY INDICATION TO YOU THAT WE ARE STILL CAUGHT ON A TIME LINE THAT IS PROBABLY HEADED FOR FUTURE CATASTROPHE? We're talking about the Doctrine of the Converging Time Lines? YES, YOU MIGHT WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT. As I understand from - I've got a personal - how can I have personal experience with a time paradox, aside from living in the reality in which we exist - but from what I understand from what I've read and from the conversations to which I have been privy, we are in fact living in a time era, a reality time era which hodge podges together the reality time line that we would normally associate with moving from A to B, cause to effect, with the nexus being the passage of clock time. And a hodge podging together superimposed upon that in our reality of errors that we made in our future to attempt to go back into our past to correct the problems of our future. Those results have hodge podged a - rather than splitting a time stream as is - maybe such people as Michio Kaiku would posit - I'm no theoretical physicist. I'm just a lowly biologist that looks at patterns. but it hodge podges in a real sense to us - does things which happened, or are to happen in the future with our present time line due to an interruption of the time stream. Instead of splitting into two time streams, what happened is that as soon as we mucked around with something, we overlaid a second time stream into the present reality. The problem with that, as I understand it, is that we did it more than once. so what we have is a snowball effect, a time stream upon timestream. OK, I SEE WHAT YOU ARE SEEING - A LOOP WITHIN A LOOP?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Yes, and more I would say in my framework, moving from A to B, looping like this, and each of those node would be an overlay of a time stream. So the more we muck with it, the worse we get. AND THE CRITICAL PERIOD OF TIME IS COMING UP IN ABOUT TEN YEARS? The critical period, according to the history that has not technically been written - if you walk outside, they are going to charge you with incoherency. (laughter) The history has not been written yet if you walk outside of here. But according to the history books that I read, there is a difficulty - unless there is a further overlay of something in the time stream that either corrects it or gets us out of the Paradox in which we live. I don't know how the hell that would happen. I don't pretend I understand that kind of stuff. Put a slide in front of me and I'll do a micro on it, OK. But.... yeah, around 2012. We're talking about the famous December 21, 2012 in the Mayan issues. The catastrophe is alleged to have and to occur at around that date, yes. And what we can do about it, I have no clue. I have no clue. BUT WE HAVE A SPLIT, SO TO SPEAK, IN THE HUMAN SPECIES. Following the catastrophe, there is a split between those individuals who take a more spiritual path and will move forward to places such as the Moon and Mars, and then onward from there to Orion. And those folks who take a more rudimentary path because it's the alleged spiritual nature of humankind from the philosophy at that time which lead us to not deal with the pressing problems of the day because we were too busy fighting our petty religious battles that then go off into a more logical mathematical, numerological philosophy. those folks who then progress slower because of the lack of ambition, the lack of spiritual ambition, they are gradually moving on to the Reticulum area. (Zeta Reticulum 1 and 2, binary star system in Milky Way Galaxy). They then become the J-Rods. THEY BECOME, BY WHAT PROCESS? IS IT SOME KIND OF RADIATION MUTATION THAT TAKES PLACE IN THEIR CELL STRUCTURE? The adaptive radiation occurs time past the catastrophe. This is according to what I've read. The only thing I can say for sure, say for damn sure! - is the interaction with the being I've had in Sector 4. I can say nothing authoritatively about the peculiar adaptive radiation that occurred toward Orion - the spiritual half of the species who were all in the catastrophe. - (?words uncertain there) - aside from the few things I've read about it (sounds like: any chap going on at Jahova)???? But, the J-Rods undergo adaptive radiation to the form that we see presently - the word \"presently\" is kind of relative when it comes to these issues now - but presently, due to time and exposure after they have moved off to Reticulum. The height began to decrease as a function of micro-evolutionary changes. The eye size, the same. The eyes started getting larger, which by the way is an interesting thing because as the eyes were getting larger - this is before the true darkening via the cover lenses and the double lid system that they have - it's a very beautiful architecture. But something happened - they are traveling back into time - that is part of the problem - they actually landed in the Land of Enchantment (New Mexico) before the structures changed for their eyes. THE LAND OF ENCHANTMENT. 1947. NEW MEXICO, RIGHT? Yes. I'm not so certain how close the young lady was - this fits in her own life, Jean Crain. But the little folks that were obtained there were not fully - what I would say fully Greys at the time - and they would now be called J-Rods at the time because they had not moved later on to the Gleise"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"system to gradually try to correct the problem they are making worse and worse. Paradoxes. I sound incoherent. (laughter) THIS MAY HAVE BEEN AT SOME POINT WHERE THEY HAD DEVELOPED SPACE AND TIME TRAVEL, BUT NOT AT THE LATER STAGES - MAYBE THE EARLIER? Well, the evolution hadn't even been completed at that point. Completed leading to the point where I had experience of meeting the gentleman that I met at Sector 4. it's difficult. We were trained to call them specimens and they, frankly, are NOT specimens. People are people. They had not developed the darkening system yet. In fact, that was a micro-evolutionary change that occurred because of the particular solar issues that were going on the planet that we - meaning the shorter folks - moved off to. These stages were just beginning to take place at the time when they were working with time travel issues and landed by whatever means in 1947. Their eyes actually contained a structure, while larger - but very similar to ours which they don't have now. But that may account for the varying opinions about the darkened eyes and the structure of the eyes that the eyewitnesses provided from - I guess, it was the Brazel ranch or something like that. I understand there was some kind of difference between the two descriptions. WHOSE TWO DESCRIPTIONS? I've not seen any of the bodies from Roswell, so I can't speak for certain on that. YOU DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY GET BRIEFED ON WHAT HAPPENED AT ROSWELL? Well, in the briefing books, there were mentions. And there were probably a very heavy specific briefing in there, but when I was sort of brought up to the Groom area - when we were provided with the briefing books - frankly, I didn't care. I thought I was there, to be very honest with you, to work with some sort of bio-remediation project, leading to what ended up in reality is the Rain Dancer program - the Rain Dancer and chemtrail program because I was extremely interested at the time in the pathology and histology, but I was also extremely interested in biospherics, which is what got me interested in forwarding me with the NASA folks and the ABL project, the Army Biological Lab project. So, I wasn't particularly interested. In fact, before I experienced the gentleman in the clean sphere, I frankly thought honestly that those people who believed in aliens were (laughter) Egg on my face! TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE, ARE THERE ALIENS AT THE DULCE FACILITY? OR WERE YOU NOT MADE AWARE OF ANY? I was in fact made aware in a conversation that there are processes underway whereby they are in fact producing hybrids. And this is just - it is inconceivable! We are in the middle of a Paradox as it is. We've got our own progeny making our Paradox worse. And we're adding to it!! God only knows where this is going to lead to simply because we are producing these - I don't want to say monsters because I don't know what, I don't know what!!! it is, to be very honest with you. I do know we have taken the process of natural selection and thrown it out the window. And not only have we done that, we have done so willfully and with negligence toward our own future. It's extremely angering to me because I'm watching us - I'm going to have to watch my language here - I'm watching us muck our world at worse with indifference. WITH ARROGANCE (BJ) (words unclear????) As soon as you add two things together which are not meant to be together. It's the old thing that if you want to go into the popular movies - dinosaurs and them being separated by 65 million years of history in the Jurassic Park or whatever - it's the rape of the natural world. Well, by God, he got it right - we are raping her!!!! And damn us for us, damn us for it. WHAT DOES IT ACCOMPLISH TO PRODUCE HYBRIDS? That they didn't tell me, not specifically. I can theorize. I can theorize"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"what they are doing is taking the Aquarius Project and taking it to the next step, the next level, if you will. Like taking the atom bomb and turning it into the hydrogen bomb, no matter what evil comes out of it. BJ: AT THE END OF THE Q-94 DOCUMENT, THEY MADE SOME RATHER STRONG STATEMENTS AGAINST YOU AND EXACTLY THIS. \"Wild types.\" \"WILD TYPES.\" Yes, see the problem is this: we have viruses that are resident within our genome. When you begin combining - or cloning, if you will, serological cloning - when you begin doing cloning which is a better term - you begin combining the retro-viruses that are present in our genome (we would say \"naturally\"). No one really knows what is in there because of the reality in which we are dealing. And those things that we know are non-resident, not normally resident - what are we possibly going to release? Can any biologist tell us what the origin of viruses are? They tell us they are evolutionary archives, throwbacks to a time immemorial in the evolutionary history of life on Earth. Really!! I was asked about inconsistencies a little while ago, about U.S. versus U.S.M.C. I brought out an inconsistency having to do with my own birth date, an inconsistency. 1960 versus 1964. I say, 'Gosh, I was awfully young then.' Well, how young were we when man evolved on this planet? Or in fact was seeded? How young were we then? How do we know? We don't. ?????? causes the resident danger of even the project within which I'm currently working. WHICH IS THE STAR FLOWER PROJECT? It's a subset of a Star Flower - well, I originally prodded it's name to Lotus and Star Flower ended up being an umbrella project above it. I'VE SEEN THAT SPELLED TWO WAYS: STAR OR STAAR. The way I originally envisioned it was STAR. Then you see the way they applied it within the actual classification system which is STAAR. DOES THAT REFER TO A GROUP? It's a bean box. We're referred to as bean boxes. I'm in a particular bean box which is called Aquarius. There is a STAAR bean box and that group specifically deals with time issues, with issues involving the larger milieu of extraterrestrial interactions. And with the historical issues involving the imprints of the extraterrestrials on civilization past and how those imprints affect us today. That's as I understand it. But that's not my bean box. THAT'S STAR? That's STAAR. IS THAT STRATEGIC - ??? ** See footnote: (3) That's not my bean box.\" ** (1) Dan called S-4 either Sector 4 or Site 4 variously.
