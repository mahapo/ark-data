I personally feel that something a whole lot more is going on.\" - Colorado rancher Click to Part 1 \" 29. Friend Loses Physical Control Jim: This leads us back to another incident. A friend of a friend who was in the Army came out to the ranch to visit. He knew nothing about it; this was just his trip to the country. He spent the night, but he would not go into the woods. He felt something was very wrong and he did not want to go out. We did not press him and we didn't discuss anything. The next morning when we got up, he was already up and was walking across the fields. He would walk stiltedly out and then turn and run back. He was doing that back and forth and everyone thought he was crazy. When we asked him what was going on, he said that every time he got near the house, something took control of him and forced him to walk back into the fields. Appendix II: Witness Speculation and Inference Decision to Tell APRO Investigator Investigator: I can see you are really concerned, but what made you finally decide to take action? Jim: I felt the events that had occurred at the ranch were significant enough so that someone of serious intent should be looking into it. Because I'm reasonably sure that there is a permanent installation there. I could go into a lot of reasons, I suppose, but the main reason is that our ranch overlooks a military installation we have a perfect view. That is the only reason I can think of for a permanent installation being there. I've read (astronomer J. Allen) Hynek's book. I inquired into Dr. (Edward) Condon (Project Blue Book report at University of Colorado). I know people who knew Dr. Condon. I checked into his character. I found out that the CU project was basically a sham at least in my own opinion, and that he was certainly not someone to whom I would have wanted to pass on my findings. I checked into the 1967 (Nebraska Police officer) Herbert Schirmer affair, and I found out how he had been treated. I knew how we treated him because I was additionally PIO officer for the Air Force "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"and I knew how I dealt with that sort of thing as security officer. No one with good judgment wants to be made a laughing stock. Barbara: When Jim got to the point that he was going to write the letter, I talked him out of it. But I've known Jim's family for a long time and I know Jim well enough to know that if he wants to do something, he'll go ahead and do it anyway. Jim: I had already made plans to go to Northwestern (University) and talk to Dr. Hynek (astronomy professor). Barbara: I was reasonably sure you would do something like that. Jim picked up a copy of the Sentinel newspaper and was reading the article and saw your name. We discussed it and I called you. Whether anyone believes us or not, as we have already told you, we decided it does not matter. What we have seen, whether it was valid or not, someone else with some interest other than publicity should know. I'm not that community-minded. I know the areas that I'm a humanitarian in and that's not one of them. I would let George do it. I've been able to talk to some people who have really helped me understand the fact that my own fears are my own fears, and they have nothing to do with anything else and I should not confuse them. I have gotten some of that worked out. But, anyway, with Jim bringing it up in front of everyone, I knew that he was going to do something anyway. I felt that I would rather be in on it and know what was said and what I might have to deal with later. The thing I fear the most is the unknown. If I have a friend I have a cross word with and I don't know how she is going to take it afterward, it drives me bananas. The unknown I can't deal with I'd rather have the fight and get it over with. I agreed to call you because Jim is the one who wanted to give this information. I really just wanted to be away from it. John said that if you were interested in hearing what he had to say (he was at the ranch less than any of us because he had to commute so much), he would talk with you if you wanted to follow up. But he is working tonight and could not come. John is as nervous as I am about this because he has been with his company 19 years. He is in management and is doing well and anything like this would totally destroy his opportunity for further advancement. Jim: You see, the reason I decided to talk to you is your credentials. If I approach people in the town with your credentials you know, guaranteeing confidentiality, they would talk to you. But if someone showed up with long hair, looking bizarre, and wanting to talk to space creatures, we would be pretty well ostracized. They are tremendously clannish in the county. And there's only one place that serves hard liquor in the whole county and that's only a recent occurrence. And I really love the county. I do want to move back there, but never back to the ranch. Personal Feelings I go back periodically. We had some guests from California and they wanted to go out and see what was happening. I took them out and we spent the night at the ranch and we were looked over again. The reason that I think that I really wanted to bring it to someone's attention is I'm reasonably sure that they play rough. It's not big brothers from space who are interested in us as spiritual beings or whatever. I'm absolutely convinced that they could not care less if we live or die. We're nuisances, although I think they may be more humanitarian than we are. And I can only assume that they are watching us, watching our military potential because I can't conceive of anything else. I have no doubts that they are mutilating the cattle none at all. The cattle are being lifted into the air, they are being drained of blood, they are being mutilated and they are being lowered. If they wanted to do just biological research on cattle, they could have disposed of the remains without them being found. The animals are left where"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"they will be f ound. It is obviously some intent to inst ill fear and it has been quite successful. The people are extremely fearful. And about the story that helicopters are doing it. I figured out early in the game that the government is sending in helicopters in large numbers from several sources, but they are doing it to cover what is really happening. I'm absolutely sure that the helicopters have nothing to do with the mutilations. They have had intensive radar nets over that area and the law officer has been kept only moderately informed. The reasons for what they are doing, I think, scare me a little. Certainly they behaved better than man would have under the same circumstances. If he (blond humanoid) wanted something, he would have taken it. But I'm not at all sure that their purposes and intents are at all favorable to us, or that there is anything we can do. But at least knowledge for knowledge, it is valuable. I have no idea that there is any way that man could stop them or even impede them. But I know that they have no difficulty at all in immobilizing a person because I've been paralyzed and that's my freak-out. I'm a little bit claustrophobic and when I can't move. With Barbara, it's her mind. I don't care about my mind they can go through it all they want to. But don't stop me from moving. That happened about six times to me after that (encounter in woods). Barbara: When I was about 18, a friend of mine attempted hypnosis and I felt the going under. It terrified me beyond anything other than what has happened in the last couple of years. I suddenly realized that is my big fear losing control of my mind. It is very frightening to me losing the ability to think. Jim: During the 1960s, I took LSD (it was legal) and I don't fear losing control of my mind. I find it almost enjoyable. It is not terrifying to me at all. But this paralysis has happened to several people and I can't conceive of any purpose they could have out there other than to create terror maybe again, I think in a military way. And that does not go, in my thinking, with wanting to make a favorable association with man. It is not the basis of an amiable relationship to start off instilling terror. I'm sure what they have done could serve no other purpose. They terrorized us, they terrorized others, and mutilated cattle being found all over nine states, I understand. I'm not at all sympathetic toward them, frankly. The things that went on out there (Clearview Ranch) left few doubts that they appear extraterrestrial and I have few doubts that they are not friendly. Barbara: All I want is a simple, uncomplicated life. If I never hear from you again, it will be all right. I'm not trying to discourage you, but that would be fine. I care not what you do other than don't involve me. That's really all I care about. Jim: I'm just the opposite. If you ever found out anything, I'd love to know. I'm pretty sure that the things that happened out there are significant enough at least, like the black box. I haven't read about the box, but enough people have seen it. I'm reasonably sure that there is one permanent installation that can be tracked down or at least surveyed by someone. And I'm reasonably sure that the activity is increasing, not diminishing. I have some curiosity a bout how often this is happening. I have read reports about the alleged kidnapping of Travis Walton in Arizona. The same type of thing occurred with the man on Mt. Evans who said something was after him. And it just quietly disappeared out of the news. Of course, I'm familiar with the Betty and Barney Hill thing. I have mixed feelings like the Hickson-Parker case in Pascagoula, Mississippi. Barbara: I'm skeptical about anything I haven't experienced myself. Jim: But when it happens to you, your skepticism goes very quickly, you know. It's a hard thing. I can't believe it happened to somebody else. But at the same time, I don't doubt that it happened to me. I think it is probably the same spot that a lot of people are in. Barbara Thinks Children Have Unhealthy Interest in UFOs"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Barbara: I don't want my kids to get anymore into this. The youngest boy is very bright and is getting too wrapped up in this. It is too much. It's unhealthy too much of anything is unhealthy, I think. I don't see anything other than the tremendous what I consider to be unhealthy interest. If something comes on TV or if there is an article in a magazine, Sam will go to great lengths to hear it including sneaking, lying or whatever in order to get to the TV, spending lunch money for a magazine and seeing Close Encounters of the Third Kind. And I think that's unhealthy to get that wrapped in it. Sweet Smell Jim: There is something I would like to know from you. When you are mining beryllium, it gives off a sweet smell. I would really like to know exactly what type of a sweet smell. What we have experienced out there and a number of people have is a very heavy permeating odor of at first we thought van illa. Then we finally refined to cherry-vanilla. And ever ybody freaked out. It was the smell of cherry-van illa and it permeated whole large areas. We have driven through it in the car and stopped part way through and it's still there. It's there during times when there has been wind which would have blown anything away from a natural herb or flower or whatever. Barbara: A friend of my husband's who is a rock hound had found some rocks out there that he said indicated beryl possibly on the property. I don't really know that much about it. Jim: A friend of mine was doing some library research and all she was able to find was the fact that mining beryllium gives off a sweet smell, but never f ound out exactly what kind of smell. And there are a lot of different types of sweet smells. I would be interested to know about that. I'm sure a mining engineer could tell, but I don't happen to know any. Investigator: Your ranch is located in an area of coal mines, so I think it more likely that the sweet smell could come from methane gas escaping. Numerous People See Disks Barbara: You haven't been as afraid to go out as I've been. Jim: Of course, I've insisted that everyone else stay away. Part of the reason that I got so involved, I guess, is that I have a macho complex. I felt it was my duty to protect everybody. We saw disks very often, very regularly. John saw them, I saw them, other people saw them. A friend of ours from Wisconsin saw them. We came back one night and one of them came right in front of his car. Harry was with him. Barbara: There were, within the two years we were there, an awfully large number of sightings. Jim: From what I can determine, the activity has accelerated since we moved out, not diminished. We understand that from the neighbors. I took friends out there that came from California. We weren't any sooner camped we put out sleeping bags in the woods to be right in the midst of it than the sounds started around us. Robert had his dog with him. The dog crept up and climbed under the covers with him. He got the full dose of what we call the 'creepys' that tremendous sense of personal danger without any stimulus. It's like a biochemical reaction. You can give injections and cause the same reaction in a person. Coping with the Experience Barbara: I must be honest. I have to consult a psychiatrist on my own. I have a great deal of difficulty dealing with this. I know what my own eyes saw. It is not that"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"my vision is poor and I thought I saw what I saw. I know what I experienced. The increased pulse rate and all that were not caused by an outside stimulus because nothing had happened to cause it. I heard no sound and saw nothing. My hearing is not that fantastic. My eyesight is not very good at all. I know there are people who have very good hearing ranges and often hear things and subconsciously they come to conclusions consciously. I don't have that range of hearing to do that. I know what happened to me and I'm just trying to put it into some sort of reference so that I can deal with it. Jim: I think that probably what she is saying and I experienced it, too is the total sense of helplessness. I know what gave me the feeling was the inab ility to move. I never feared them. I never feared 'Big Foot' or any of them in the sense of personal danger. But I don't think people can easily face a sense of total helplessness. I think the way I saved my sanity because it didn't really bother me appreciably was by doing something, like sleeping with my shotgun. I just wiped out the fact that I couldn't move if they didn't want me to. Somehow, I still felt the power to do something. Barbara: But I don't have the range of experience that you have, either. You have lived a very full life and I have not. Jim: Well, this is not something I have lived before. Barbara: No, not that, but you have a broader base to face something with. I don't. I have never had anything that startling in my life happen to me. Jim: Is this all absolutely confidential? Investigator: Absolutely. Jim: Well, what she meant by my range of experience I was a security officer in the U. S. Air Force and I transferred to a Security Agency. I worked for them when I was young and they paid my way to college. I have kind of thrived on intrigue, to some extent. So I could deal very well with intrigue. I think in a way, it prepared me to deal with the ranch. But I never thought anything like this would happen to me. And some of the things that happened, I really would like to tell you. It would be beneficial to me to get it off my chest. But I'm locked into a situational thing. Barbara: Well, let me work a few more times with my psychiatrist and maybe we can come up with something. Since I've been trying to deal with this, my weight has gone up about 30 pounds and I'm now smoking almost three packs of cigarettes a day. Five years ago, I didn't smoke at all. I'm turning myself into an absolute physical wreck and I do have to deal with it because I don't want my family to suffer. I started with the psychiatrist about three months ago. I'm sure he doesn't believe a thing I'm saying. But he is helping me at least say, 'All right, if you believe it, that's fine. Let's deal with it from that point.' Jim: She really didn't crack until that night when she thought we were under attack, when the paint on the porch caught fire. Then she cracked. Barbara: I don't know if you have ever wanted anything so bad you can taste it, as the expression goes. That's how badly I wanted that ranch. But I couldn't face it. I think the psychiatrist thinks he is helping me. I'm sure that he does not believe me. But he is approaching it with the fact that if I believe it, I don't have to be insane to believe it. If I believe I saw it, and I can deal with it on a rational basis, then we can work from there. That's what I've gotten from him. You have to understand that once you face the fact, then it really doesn't make any difference whether someone believes you or not. Two Types of Creatures Appear in Conflict"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Jim: I think the reason that I need to give my opinion is that these creatures, whatever they are - the ones we have seen, with the exception of the two 'more humanoid' ones, have always appeared to be afraid of something. They are extremely nervous, extremely jumpy, extremely terrified of something and I'm sure it is not us. That I have no doubt of. It is not people. I'm sure they are watching the military base for some unknown reas on. I can't think of any other reason for them to be there. Whatever this other thing was that showed up, I actually feel more friendly toward this non-humanoid form than I do toward the ones that look humanoid. I'm reasonably sure that the humanoids are afraid of the (tall, thin one associated with ice cream cone-shaped craft). Yes, supposition, you know body language the way it looked at me. It obviously was not afraid of anything, if that makes sense. It was there, it intended to be there, and it was almost like a compassionate thing or if you were describing it as a religious experience, almost. You know, you come in contact with something very great. But I never felt that with the disks and whoever was on them. They had always been very nervous when anyone showed up. It was almost an extreme paranoia, except for the one time I mentioned that I walked up and talked to them (black box and Big Foot killed). They were very calm, very in control of themselves on that occasion. When I was talking to the law officer, he said that activity ceased when ships of this other type like Barbara saw showed up. She wasn't the only one to see it. Other people in the community saw it, too. And what he was relating to me as the fact that the activity would somehow go down because this other ship showed up. There has been a consistent pattern of the disks diminishing when this other (ice cream cone-shaped) ship shows up. He did not know that the humanoids, or whatever you want to call them, are in the disks and this other skinny, non-humanoid type is in the ice cream cone-shaped thing. What they are up to or what they are doing or the rest of it is, I think, partly what I am interested in. There is something going on between them, because I know at the ranch, they apparently were not at all interested in us. We were just nuisances. Barbara: You have an opinion about what happened to me. You felt that they made some kind of mental contact with me to impress me. I know that the first time it happened, my mental pattern was changed and I wasn't even aware of it. I didn't really realize that people have that clear a pattern of thinking until it was different for me. It was totally alien to me to think that way. I don't do that. I go very much on the emotional gut level. Somebody s miles right so they must be all right. It's not what they do or the facts you get about them. And that was definitely at least a two-hour experience. More Speculation Jim: I think I am extremely interested in how they can get into a person's mind, because they have no difficulty controlling mind or body. Everybody has had the same feelings. Several people have seen the humanoids. Again, I was the only one who saw this skinny thing. And Barbara, I don't think she wants people to think that I am crazy she made me absolutely promise never to tell anybody. Barbara: The only reason he convinced me to do this was the validity of what really happened. I know what happened. I know what I saw. I know that I did see disks. I know the largest number that I saw at one time was nine. I know that at least once every two or three months, we saw disks. So I know that I saw them. I was not imagining them because at that time I certainly was not in the mental state I'm in now. I was very happy with being out there. It got progressively worse because of what had happened and the only reason I agreed to do this was because Jim felt that maybe something would come of it, that maybe someone else had seen or experienced it and maybe something could be put together that would be helpful to mankind. I don't meant o sound like I don't care what happens to mankind, but I"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"don't think I could help that much. I really don't question what Jim saw. Jim: What happened could have been hallucinatory. It could have been drug-induced. It could have been a lot of things. But from my own subjective range, it happened to me. I would not want to be put up as a laughing stock in the National Enquirer. That would infuriate me. But to have someone quietly think I'm insane, you know, that's their problem. Barbara wanted to hush it up, but to me, it's interesting. After the pilot crashed and other things occurred, I had no doubt that they (non-humans) can play rough. And the law officer encouraged me to accept that point of view. But again, if they are playing rough, they are up to something that I don't feel is ethical. I personally feel that something a whole lot more is going on. I have read a lot of books and I personally believe that Herbert Schirmer, the State Trooper, was picked up. I have no doubts of that one in my own mind. I have a few doubts about the Betty Barney H ill case. I have doubts about the one in Mississippi: Hickson and Parker. I think reading the stories helped me so that I was not quite so upset about seeing things. It's hard, though, to explain what you feel inside because you never feel one solid emotion. You know, it's one over here and one over here and one over here. But I do want absolute confidentiality. That would be the one thing I could not deal with (publicity). If I did find that I was hallucinating, that would not bother me. But I do think there is a whole lot going on with a lot of people and that's the reason I decided to come and tell it all. Some could tell a whole lot of things and I think the people that have had some of the best experiences won't. I think it is something that people should do, even if it is a subjective experience. It is possible it could have been a totally subjective experience. Even with all of us, it could have been hallucinations. It could have been a lot of things. Maybe none of it happened. Maybe everybody there was deceived in some way. I can't picture how, but just because I can't picture it, does not mean it could not happen. Investigator: There is so much smoke there that it's hard to think that there is not some fire generating it. Barbara: I think that if you are ever going to do something material about it, that hum would be something that is still going on. To my knowledge, it has never ceased. Jim: If you are interested in the county and the people who live out there, I'm sure I could induce them to tell about this thing. The law officer, I'm sure, will talk but again, confidentially. The 'kooky' lady, Roberta, she'll talk on whatever basis. Barbara: I met her briefly in town twice and because of what was happening, I desperately wanted to go and hear about what she had seen. But other friends said it would not be good to become friends with her because she was 'the county gossip' there is one in every area and she is a good, kind-hearted person. She is the kind who will show up with a cake when you need it, but in the meantime, she w ill describe everything in detail that she cam across. And I felt that I didn't need that. I have never spoken to her about anything that happened at all. But other people have told me what she has seen and she had seen it for many years before we purchased the property.\" Continued in Part 6 Are Entities Using Underground Mine As Base?
