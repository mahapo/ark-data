Return to Part 2 May 3, 2005 - Thurmont, Maryland - The following transcript is from an interview conducted in January 1987 by the U. S. Federal Aviation Administration Chief Investigator, John Callahan, with Japan Air Lines Pilot, Kenju Terauchi, about his JAL Flight 1628 encounter with a massive UFO on November 16, 1986. The transcript was provided to Earthfiles by U. S. Navy Research Physicist, Bruce Maccabee, Ph.D., after Dr. Maccabee obtained the case file records from the CIA. Transcript of Interview with JAL Pilot, Kenju Terauchi (cont): “Then three to seven seconds later, a fire like from jet engines stopped and became a small circle of lights as they began to fly in level flight at the same speed as we were, showing numerous numbers of exhaust pipes. However, the center area of the ship where below an engine might be was invisible. The middle of the body of the ship sparked an occasional stream of lights, like a charcoal fire, from right to left and "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"from left to right. Its shape was a square, flying 500 feet to 1,000 feet in front of us, very slightly higher in altitude than us. Its size was about the same size as the body of a DC-8 jet, but with numerous exhaust pipes. The firing of the exhaust jets varied, perhaps to maintain balance, some became stronger than others and some became weaker than others, but seemed controlled automatically. We did not feel threatened or in danger because the spaceship moved so suddenly. We probably would have felt more in danger and would have been prepared to escape if the spaceships were shaking unsteadily or were unable to stop themselves. It is impossible for any man-made machine to make a sudden appearance in front of a jumbo jet that is flying 910 kilometers per hour and to move along in a formation paralleling our aircraft. The ships moved in formation for about three to five minutes. Then two ships moved forward in a line, again slightly higher in altitude than we were and 40 degrees to our left. We did not report this action to the Anchorage Center. Honestly, we were simply breathtaken. Communication Interference The VHF communication, both in transmitting and receiving, were extremely difficult for ten or fifteen minutes while the little ships came close to us and often interfered with communication from the Anchorage Center. However, communication conditions became just as good as soon as the ships left us. There were no abnormalities in the equipment or the aircraft. I have no idea why they came so close to us. Also, there was a pale white flat light on the direction where the ships flew away, moving in a line along with us, in the same direction and same speed and in the same altitude as we were. Anchorage Center Saw Nothing On Radar Again, we began communicating with the Anchorage Center. We said that we could see a light in the 10 o'clock position at the same altitude and wondered if they could see anything in their radar? The Anchorage Center replied that they saw nothing in their radar. I thought it would be impossible to find anything on an aircraft radar if a large, ground radar did not show anything. But I judged the distance of the object visually and it was not very far. I set the digital weather radar distance in 20 miles, radar angle to horizon. There it was on our JAL screen, a large, green and round object which had appeared seven or eight miles (13 to 15 kilometers) away, where the direction of the object was. We reported to the Anchorage Center that our aircraft radar caught the object within seven or eight miles in 10 o'clock position. We asked if Anchorage could catch it on their ground radar, but it did not seem they could at all. Normally, it appears in red when an aircraft radar catches another aircraft. I wonder if the metal used in the spaceship is different from ours (that caused the color to be green)? While we were communicating with the Anchorage Center, the two pale white lights gradually moved to the left side and to left diagonally back 30 degrees, as if they understood our conversation and then when they were beside our aircraft, they totally disappeared from our radar. When the lights were in front of us, the ships were positioned slightly higher in altitude than we were. But now, they placed themselves slightly below the horizon where it was most difficult for us to see them. The distance between us was still about seven to eight miles visually. When we started to see Ft. Yukon diagonally below us at the right, the sun was setting down in the southwest, painting the sky in a slightly red stripe approximately two to three millimeters and gave a bit of light. But the east side was still pitch dark. Far in front of us, there were lights increasing from the U. S. Military Eielson AFB and Fairbanks. The lights were still following us at exactly the same distance. However, it was too dark to identify by only the lights whether or not they were the same two spaceships that appeared in front of us a few minutes ago. It seemed that we were flying in the lighter side and gave them the advantage of being on the dark side. We had no fears so far, but began to worry since we had no idea about their purpose. When the lights from the Eielson AFB and Fairbanks became clear and bright, two very bright lights appeared suddenly from the north from a belt of lights, perhaps four or five mountains away. Confusion About Alaska Pipeline Lights"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" The extremely bright lights reflected on snow on the side of the mountains and seemed even brighter. We wondered if they were searching something on the ground surface or were to (attract?) or lead something? The flight above Alaska territory is generally in the daytime and it is confusing to identify those kind of lights. It cannot be a base for the spaceship? Is it a movie? There was something. Oh, yes, it is the Alaska pipeline. The lights must be a pump station for the pipeline. I got it (understood). 'Silhouette of Gigantic Spaceship' Causes Fear We arrived at the sky above the Eielson AFB and Fairbanks. It was a clear night. The lights were extremely bright to eyes that were used to the dark. How bright it was! We were just above the bright city lights and we checked the pale white light behind us. Alas! There was a silhouette of a gigantic spaceship. We must run away quickly! I radioed: 'Anchorage Center, this is JL 1628, requesting a change of course to right 45 degrees.' It felt like a long time before we received permission. When we checked our rear, there was still the (huge walnut-shaped) ship following us. 'This is JL 1628. Again, requesting for change the course 45 degrees to the right.' We had to get away from that object! 'JL 1628. This is the Anchorage Center. We advise you to continue and take 360 degree turn.' 'JL 1628, thank you. We will continue 360 degree turn.' It was too slow to circle in the auto=pilot mode. Therefore, we switched to the manual mode and set to turn right on a 30 degrees bank. We looked to our right forward, but did not see any light. We were relieved, thinking the object might have left us and returned to the level flight. But when we checked to our rear, the (huge) object was still there in exactly the same place. 'Anchorage Center, this is JL 1628. The object follows us in formation. We request a change in altitude, 31,000 feet, yes, 31,000 feet.' 'This is the Anchorage Center, JL 1628, ascend to 31,000 feet.' The consumption of fuel during this flight was almost as expected, but there was only 3,800 pounds left and as such was not enough for extra flying for running around. We have got to arrive at Anchorage. 'Anchorage Center, this is JL 1628. We request permission for the direct flight to Talkeetna.' 'JL 1628, this is the Anchorage Center. We authorize the direct flight to Talkeetna.' We checked behind us again. The ship was in formation and ascending with us. We wondered and feared as to their purpose. 'JL 1628, this is the Anchorage Center. Would you like to request scramble for confirmation?' 'The Anchorage Center, this is JL 1628. We would not request scramble.' We turned the offer down quickly. I knew that in the past, there was a U. S. military fighter called the mustang that had flown up high for a confirmation and a tragedy had happened to it. Even the F-15 with the newest technology had no guarantee of safety against the creature with an unknown degree of scientific technology. We flew toward Talkeetna at an altitude of 31,000 feet. The spaceship was still following us, not leaving us at all. United Airline Pilot Sees Object Near JAL Plane About the same time, a United Airline passenger aircraft which left Anchorage to Fairbanks flew into the same air zone and began communicating with the Anchorage Center. We heard United transmitting that there was an object near JL 1628 and requesting for confirmation. We heard that the Anchorage Center was saying to the United Airline aircraft that JL 1628 was at an altitude of 31,000 feet. It sounded as if"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Anchorage Center had the United Airline aircraft fly above the spaceship. We were flying the east side of Mt. McKinley. The United Airline aircraft came close to us. The United Airline aircraft requested us to flash landing lights for visual confirmation and we both confirmed our positions visually. The United Airline aircraft was coming close to us. We knew that they were watching us. When the United plane came by our side, the spaceship disappeared suddenly and there was nothing but the light of the moon. The strange encounter ended at 75 miles north of Talkeetna, 150 miles (276 kilometers) away from Anchorage. It comprised approximately 50 minutes of flight time.” R eturn to Part 1 More Information: F or further information about the worldwide UFO phenomena, please see Earthfiles Archive (partial list below) and my books, An Alien Harvest and the 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities in the Earthfiles Shop. · 04/28/2005 -- Dozens of Unidentified Aerial Objects Videotaped Over Sonora, California · 04/17/2005 -- 1949 Aerial Disc Covered-Up By Project Blue Book As \"Kite\" · 04/14/2005 -- \"Battle of Los Angeles,\" February 25, 1942 · 04/13/2005 -- Highly Strange Dog Death in Arkansas; 2000-Pound Bull Dropped On Log Pile · 03/08/2005 -- Flying Disc Paced Airliner Over Puget Sound Navy Yard · 02/21/2005 -- Update d - Bull and Cow Mutilations Northwe st of Corpus Christi, Te xas · 01/15/2005 -- Bull and Cow Mutilations Northwe st of Corpus Christi, Te xas · 12/10/2004 -- Part 3: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation? · 12/10/2004 -- Part 4: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation? · 10/29/2004 -- Part 2: Update On Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia, UFO Case. · 09/06/2004 -- Part 1: Terry Sherman - 1996 Interview About High Strangeness on Fort Duche sne , Utah Ranch · 09/06/2004 -- Part 2: Terry Sherman - 1996 Interview About High Strangeness on Fort Duchesne, Utah Ranch · 08/29/2004 -- Another Pictogram in Poland · 08/09/2004 -- Pictograms in Poland · 07/07/2004 -- Fourth 2004 Crop Formation in Poland Has Multiple Parts · 06/17/2004 -- More 2004 Holland and Poland Crop Formations · 06/03/2004 -- Updated - Second 2004 Pictogram Crop Formation in Poland · 05/19/2004 -- Why Ball Lightning Does Not Explain Facts in Mexico Air Force Infrared and Radar Eve nt · 05/17/2004 -- Update d - Crop Formation Re porte d in Zabno, Poland · 02/14/2004 -- More High Strange ne ss in the Michigan Sky · 02/06/2004 -- Unidentified Aerial Objects - Again! - Over Michigan · 01/19/2004 -- Earthfiles and Radio Audience Feedback About Anomalous Sky Objects · 01/17/2004 -- High Strangene ss in the Napole on, Michigan Sky · 01/17/2004 -- Update on Horton, Michigan Ice Circle · 01/10/2004 -- Strange Unidentified Aerial Objects in Indiana and Pennsylvania · 10/17/2003 -- 2003 \"UFO Flap\" in Ohio · 04/22/2003 -- UFO Expe rie nce s Re porte d by Fore st Fire Lookouts · 02/01/2003 -- Six Unidentified Triangular Aerial Craft Over Uinta Mountains, Utah · 01/14/2003 -- Part 2: Cape Girardeau and Charlette Mann's 1991 Letter About Her G randfathe r's Expe rie nce · 11/03/2002 -- Strange Light Triggered Magnetic Alarm and Was Photographed in Montre al, Canada · 04/17/2002 -- Part 2 - Unidentified Aerial Craft Over Farmington and Aztec, New Mexico in Spring 1949 · 03/16/2002 -- Part 1 - 'Huge Saucer Armada' Shocked Farmington, New Mexico 52 Ye ars Ago · 01/19/2002 -- Nine Unidentified Aerial Objects Tracked at 8,000 mph on 1952 Radar · 02/06/2000 -- Large Yellow Sphere In Snohomish, Washington · 12/26/1999 -- Hubble Repair, Gamma Ray Bursts and Unidentified Aerial Objects · 12/22/1999 -- Update - Unidentified \"Arrowhead\"-Shaped Object in California Sky · 06/28/1999 -- Anothe r 90-Degre e Ae rial Turn Associate d with Contrail · 04/09/1999 -- Strange Lights In Missouri Websites: JAL 1628 Over Alaska: http://www.ufoevidence.org/cases/case287.htm Physicist Bruce Maccabee JAL Analysis: http://brumac.8k.com/JAL1628/JL1628.html Majestic 12 Documents: http://www.majesticdocuments.com American Presidents: http://www.presidentialufo.com"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
