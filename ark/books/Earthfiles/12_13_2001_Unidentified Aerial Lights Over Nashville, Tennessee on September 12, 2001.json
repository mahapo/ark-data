It really makes you wonder what is out there?\" - Matt Randall, High School Student, Lebanon, Tennessee These nine frames were selected from the original September 12, 2001 twenty-three-minute videotape taken by radio engineer Ted Randall of unidentified aerial lights that appeared in the sky over Lebanon, Tennessee, a southern suburb of Nashville. Ted and his sons, Matt and David, experimented by flashing bright lights at the sky after the September 11 catastrophe in New York City, Washington, D. C. and Pennsylvania provoked the U. S. government to ground all flights, except authorized military missions. This sequence of 9 selected frames shows the light in the lower left advance upward over a five minute period until it flared twice and disappeared.

December 13, 2001 Lebanon, Tennessee - In the Nashville suburb of Lebanon on September 12, 2001, the chief engineer at WJKM 1090 radio decided to try an experiment after the skies were emptied of air traffic in the aftermath of the World Trade Center catastrophe the day before. Ted Randall has lived and worked in the Nashville area most of his life and reported to me this past summer that he and others were trying to cope with mysterious power surges at a Hartsville radio station and surrounding offices where more than sixty birds were found dead and their feathers melted as if exposed to intense heat or microwaves. (See: Earthfiles July 14, 18 and 25, 2001) Puzzled by all the unexplained power surges, he and his sons wondered if there might be a link to unusual aerial phenomenon. Ted called me on September 12 to let me know that he and his sons, David and Matt, were going to try flashing lights at the night sky that was supposed to be empty simply to see what might happen. To their amazement, for over two hours the three men watched lights appear, move slowly a small distance, stop and disappear or move in a zigzag pattern. I have seen 23 minutes of videotape Ted got with his Sony camera in its night vision mode. In one sequence shown above, a bright object appears in the lower left frame and for about five minutes, works its way up toward another light that is assumed to be a star. When the slowly moving light reaches a point above the background star, the mysterious light pulses off and on and then disappears. The only aerial craft approved to fly that night were U. S. military jets and helicopters, but none of the objects on Ted Randall's videotape move across the frame as jets or helicopters would. Lights not only appear, move and then disappear, many were appearing and disappearing in the same place. What were the strange star-like objects that appeared and disappeared in the sky over Nashville on September 12? Interview: Ted Randall, Matt Randall and David Randall, Radio Engineers, WJKM (1090AM), at Cedar Vine Manor, Lebanon, Tennessee: Ted Randall, Chief Engineer, WJKM 1090, Cedar Vine Manor Studios, Lebanon, Tennessee: \"When I was probably in the eighth grade, I had an interest in ham radio. And part of ham radio is Morse Code. I had a friend across town and we had fabricated some reflector dishes from metal snow slides and put car headlights into these dishes and flashed Morse Code on the clouds. Now, this allowed us to send messages back and forth. A DIFFERENT KIND OF TELEPHONE THEN THAT YOU GUYS HAD FIGURED OUT HOW TO USE THE CLOUDS TO SHINE LIGHTS ON. Te d : Right. The clouds would reflect and we could communicate back and forth. It was just something fun to do, nothing serious. However, one night we were experimenting and I was trying to get the light bright enough so we might not even need a cloud, more like a search light going into the sky. We had the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"light going straight up in the air and began to send the Morse Code and all of a sudden, I noticed there was a light flashing back at me. It was motionless and there was not a sound. Back in the time when I was in 8th grade, there wasn't satellites, helicopters and stuff like that in the skies. ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE 1950s? Te d : No, it would be in the 1960s. And I got frightened. This light would flash when we flashed and flash back. And I became frightened and ran in the house and that was it! That was the end of the light flashing for me because it just seemed too weird! I couldn't imagine what was flashing back at me. WE ARE AT 2001. THE CATASTROPHE HAPPENED ON SEPTEMBER 11. YOU DECIDED WITH YOUR SONS TO SORT OF TRY THIS OLD CHILDHOOD EXPERIMENT AGAIN. AND I'M CURIOUS, MATT, WHEN ALL OF YOU ARE OUT IN THE YARD, WAS EVERYTHING IN THE SKY PRETTY MUCH DARK AND SILENT? WHAT WAS THE SKY CONDITION WHEN YOU FIRST WENT OUT AND WHO FLASHED THE FIRST LIGHT AND WHAT HAPPENED? I believe David was first. DAVID, WHAT HAPPENED? David: We both have a giant 2 million watt lights. And I started flashing it up in the sky in a random order and wait for something to happen. WHAT WAS THE MOST DRAMATIC YOU SAW? David: Throughout the night, I would have to say the most dramatic thing I saw were the lights that would zigzag. They would start in a forward motion, then backtrack and go into forward motion again. THOSE WOULD START AT A PLACE IN THE SKY, DO THE ZIGZAG AND WHERE THEY WENT OUT WOULD BE AT THE END OF A ZIGZAG AND THEY WOULD THEN FADE OR BLINK OUT? David : They would most of the time blink out. But there was one that was brighter blinked twice. TED, ON THE VIDEOTAPE WE CAN HEAR YOU SAY MANY TIMES, 'I DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM LOOKING AT.' CAN YOU GIVE US A FEEL OF SOME OF THE ACTION THROUGH THAT LENS THAT YOU WERE SEEING? Te d : The lights would appear. You could see the stars very clearly through the night vision on the camera, a very amazing device. But then, all of a sudden these unexplained lights would appear. Not only would they appear, but they would appear to come and go out of focus. With the camera faced on stars, the focus of the camera is going to be on infinity. So for some of those lights to go in and out of focus did not make any sense. What were we looking at? I CAN ASSERT FROM HAVING SEEN A LOT OF VIDEOTAPE OF PHENOMENA IN THE NIGHT SKY THAT I WAS LOOKING AT A LOCKED OFF CAMERA ON A TRIPOD. THERE IS NO MOTION WHATSOEVER IN THE BACK STAR FIELD. BUT YOU DO HAVE THESE PINPOINTS OF LIGHT THAT SEEM TO BE STARS. BUT THERE IS THIS OTHER ACTION OF LIGHTS THAT SEEM TO COME IN AND GO OUT AT THE SAME PLACE. MATT, COULD SEE WITH YOUR EYES ANYTHING LIKE THAT LIGHT ON THE LOWER LEFT FRAME OF THE VIDEOTAPE WHICH SEEMS TO MOVE TOWARDS A LIGHT THAT SEEMS TO BE A STAR? Matt: You could see the light with your naked eye. But through the camera, you"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"could see much, much more. As soon as you placed the camera toward the night sky, there was more than you could see. It's mind boggling what's up there! DAVID, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE NIGHT SKY WAS BLACK WHEN YOU FIRST GOT THERE AND ON THE VIDEOTAPE ITSELF, THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANYTHING THERE UNTIL YOU SEE THE FRAMES WASHED OUT BY YOUR FIRST FLASHES OF LIGHT. HOW LONG AFTER THOSE FIRST FLASHES OF LIGHT DID IT TAKE FOR UNUSUAL MOTION IN THE SKY? David : I would say not more than five minutes. After I had flashed the light for about five minutes, you could see things start to move around in the sky. Father started taping with the camera shortly after we started flashing with the light. THERE ARE 23 MINUTES IN THREE SEGMENTS AND I HAVE SEEN IT ALL. AND WE KNOW THAT ON SEPTEMBER 12, ALL AIR TRAFFIC WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DOWN AND NOTHING IN THE AIR EXCEPT FOR AUTHORIZED MILITARY BECAUSE OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN NEW YORK, WASHINGTON, D. C. AND PENNSYLVANIA. WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR THREE MINDS WHEN FOR TWO HOURS OUTSIDE AND THE ONLY THING YOU ARE DOING IS FLASHING LIGHTS UP IN THE SKY AND GETTING THE TYPE OF REACTIONS YOU WERE SEEING? Te d : One thing I would like to say, Linda, is that the thing that was most puzzling was the fact that the lights would appear to respond to the flashing. As soon as Matthew and David initiated the light sequence, these things would appear. SO THERE WAS A DISTINCT CONNECTION BETWEEN FLASHING THE LIGHT AND THE MOTION IN THE SKY. THERE WAS A SIMILAR CASE IN MISSOURI. A BOOK WAS WRITTEN ABOUT IT. (See More Information below: Project Identification by Harley D. Rutledge, Ph.D., © 1981) PROFESSOR RUTLEDGE (Chairman of the Physics Department at Southeast Missouri State University) DID AN EXPERIMENT TO FLASH LIGHTS AT THE SKY AND FOUND THERE WAS FLASHING BACK. AND NOW YOU HAVE GOTTEN A SIMILAR RESPONSE ON A CLEAR NIGHT WHEN THERE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY AIR TRAFFIC. I'M CURIOUS IN TALKING WITH PEOPLE IN YOUR GENERAL AREA, WHAT DO THEY SAY IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE MYSTERIOUS POWER SURGES YOU HAVE HAD. HAS ANYONE TRIED TO SUGGEST WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FLASHING BACK AT YOUR LIGHTS ON SEPTEMBER 12? Not really. We have been met with extreme skepticism and even anger by some. When other people experience anything like this, they just keep it all to themselves. BECAUSE OF COMMUNITY REACTION OF DENIAL. Exactly. WHAT ABOUT YOU YOUNGER FELLOWS? HAVE YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS EXPERIMENT WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES AND HAS ANYONE ELSE AROUND HERE TRIED IT? Matt: I'm in high school and a couple friends of mine have tried flashing lights and have seen some of the same things. Then there are other people who just think you are absolutely crazy until they see it with their own eyes. I don't know. It's so strange and creepy when you see it with your own eyes. It really makes you wonder what is really out there."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"DOES THAT OLD ACRONYM 'UFO' CROSS YOUR MIND AT ALL GIVEN THAT NOTHING ABOUT THESE SEEMS STRUCTURED? BUT YOU CAN'T HELP WONDER IF THESE ARE THE TRAILS, THE TRACKS, OF SOMETHING THAT IS EXTRATERRESTRIAL. David: It definitely makes you wonder. Before we tried this, I would just wonder, 'Is that an airplane?' But after September 12, when there was no commercial airliners up there, what was it?! Matt: Also looking at the fact of the speed some of these things move in the sky. There is no way it can be a normal airplane. A LOT OF THEM. THAT ONE LIGHT IS MOVING A SHORT DISTANCE FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES THAT I TRACKED OFF THE MINUTE:SECOND TIME ON THE TAPE. AND IT MOVES FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER WITH A DISCERNIBLE MOTION. BUT IT STARTS AT A STANDSTILL AND THEN MOVES. AND WHEN IT FINALLY WENT OUT, IT DID SO WITH THOSE BLASTS OF BEING BRIGHT, DIM, BRIGHT, DIM AND THEN DISAPPEARING. AND IT DISAPPEARED AFTER MOVING FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES IN A LOCKED OFF CAMERA FRAME THAT IS FOCUSED AT INFINITY. AND A JET OR HELICOPTER GOING BY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN AND OUT OF THAT FRAME RATHER QUICKLY. SOME OF THE RAPIDLY MOVING LIGHTS, MIGHT BE METEORS. BUT FOR THE MOST PART, THERE SEEMS TO BE VERY ANOMALOUS ACTION NO MATTER WHAT IT IS? David: Well, even with the zigzags that I saw. There are no aircraft that I have seen in my life that can move like that. A lot of them look like falling stars, but with the motions and tracking they go through, they can't be meteors. SOME OF THOSE THAT ARE FASTER THAN THE SLOWLY MOVING OBJECTS SEEM TO HAVE A STARTING AND STOPPING POINT THAT SEEM SHORTER THAN WHAT YOU WOULD ASSOCIATE WITH METEORS . TED, WHEN YOU THINK BACK TO YOUR CHILDHOOD DAYS OF TRYING TO COMMUNICATE WITH CLOUDS AND YOU JUMP TO 2001 AND YOU DID THIS AS AN EXPERIMENT BECAUSE THERE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE ANYTHING IN THE SKY WHAT HAS GONE THROUGH YOUR MIND? Te d : I guess the thing that impressed me most using and looking through the camera is that when you flashed the light, with your naked eye you might see a light come on and off. But with the camera and its night vision, you see not just one but several lights go on and off at the same time. This anomaly is occurring in the sky when no other aircraft except authorized military are supposed to be there. And from 8th grade to now, it makes me wonder that someone has to know something about what this is! I would assume that. If not, that is something that makes you lay awake at night and wonder about. YOU ARE IN A RADIO STATION HERE BETWEEN NASHVILLE AND LEBANON. DOES IT EVER CROSS YOUR MIND THAT WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IS CALL UP SOME OF THE MILITARY BASES AND TRY TO REPORT THIS? YOU COULD ASK IF THEY KNOW WHAT THIS IS AND EXPLAIN TO THEM THAT YOU HAVE THIS VIDEOTAPE TAKEN ON A NIGHT WHEN THERE WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ANYTHING IN THE SKY. AND TELL THEM, 'YOU CAN LOOK AT THIS VIDEOTAPE YOURSELF. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THESE ARE.' Te d : To be honest with you, no, that has never crossed my mind. And I think the reason why is that in every case where we have tried to report about things,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"especially the situation in Hartsville (massive electrical surge See: Earthfiles July 14 and 18, 2001), it's usually met with deaf ears.\" More Information: If any one has tried similar light experiments in night skies and videotaped similar light movements, please get in touch with me at: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.
