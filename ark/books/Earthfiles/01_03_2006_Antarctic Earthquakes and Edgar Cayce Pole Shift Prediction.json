January 3, 2006 Fiji Islands and South Sandwich Islands - Two strong earthquakes have been reported in island regions north of Antarctica. The first 7.3 magnitude on the Richter scale was east of the South Sandwich Islands which are north of Antarctica. The second several hours later was a 7.1 magnitude located in the Fiji Island chain further north of Antarctica. South Sandwich Islands Associated Press: \"The quake struck at 5:10 a.m. local time (January 3, 2006), and was centered 10 kilometers under the seabed some 345 kilometers southeast of Bristol Island of the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands. ...South Georgia, formerly a whaling station, is now a permanent station run by scientists from the British Antarctic Survey. The South Sandwich Islands to the south of South Georgia are uninhabited. The islands are administered from the Falkland Islands, another British overseas territory.\" No tsunami were reported.

Associated Press reported: \"There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage and the Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said it did not expect the quake to trigger a damaging Pacific-wide tsunami. A seismologist at Fiji's Mines and Resources Department. said the quake was too deep to have been felt anywhere in the Fiji islands. Fiji is regularly hit by earthquakes in its 332 islands - about 110 of which are inhabited - because it sits in an active seismic area in the South Pacific.\" F iji island chain north of Auckland, New Zealand, w hich is also north of Antarctica. Antarctic Quakes Linked to Earth Pole Shift in Edgar Cayce's Prophecies Edgar Cayce was born in 1877 and died in Virginia Beach, Virginia, in 1945. In his 68-year-long life, he was known as \"the sleeping prophet\" because he would close his eyes and appear to go into a trance to answer questions about peoples' health, reincarnation history, and what he saw as catastrophic changes in the Earth's future. At his death, he left thousands of accounts of past life and medical readings. A stenographer took notes during his sessions and at least 14,000 transcripts of his readings are under the protection of the Association for Research and Enlightenment (A. R. E.) in Virginia Beach, Virginia. In one of his readings on January 19, 1934 (Cayce reading 3976-15), Cayce said there would be a literal and physical pole shift: \"There will be the upheavals in the Arctic and in the Antarctic that will make for the eruption of volcanoes in the Torrid areas, and there will be shifting then of the poles - so that where there has been those of a frigid or the semi-tropical will become the more tropical, and moss and fern will grow. And these will begin in those periods in 1958 to 1998 ...\" Also, in the classic book, Edgar Cayce - The Sleeping Prophet © 1967 by Jess Stearn, an excerpt from another Cayce reading is given: \"Apparently concerned that the 1958 to 1998 cycle would destroy civilization as we know it, a millennium-minded individual had asked, 'What great change or the beginning of what change, if any, is to take place in the Earth in the year 2000 to 2001 A.D.?' With Cayce's axis change in effect for some sixty years by then, the seer saw at this time a resulting shifting of the poles: 'When there is a shifting of the poles, or a new cycle begins.' That was for the year 2000 A. D.\" "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"E dgar Cayce 1877-1945. Photo at age 32 in 1909. Edgar Cayce at age 55 in 1932. William Hutton, geologist and co-author with Jonathan Eagle of the 2004 book, Earth's Catastrophic Past and Future: A Scientific Analysis of Information Channeled by Edgar Cayce, became interested in Edgar Cayce's Earth changes predictions after he read Edgar Cayce: Mystery Man of Miracles © 1956 by Joseph Millard. \"For me,\" says Mr. Hutton, \"that book described the Edgar Cayce phenomenon and it mentioned such things as the lost continent of Atlantis, a coming pole shift, the rising and falling of Lemuria in the Pacific and so on. I taught geology in universities and worked in state and a national laboratory. Then I decided to retire to Virginia Beach where Cayce had lived and to study his readings at the A. R. E. Finally, it occurred to me that as a geologist, I should write a book about Cayce's view of the future Earth. That first one was Coming Earth Changes © 1996, which I published through the A. R. E. and has been a successful book because there is so much public interest in the Cayce prophecies about the past and future.\" That lead William Hutton investigating more about the pole shift prediction linked on a prophesied Cayce timeline to earthquakes in the Antarctic and Arctic and consequential volcanoes in the \"Torrid zones.\" By 2004, William Hutton and Jonathan Eagle had produced another Cayce-related book, Earth's Catastrophic Past and Future: A Scientific Analysis of Information Channeled by Edgar Cayce. After the January 2, 2006, report of the two large earthquakes north of the Antarctic, William Hutton wrote as his Hutton Commentaries website: \"Major quakes like today's are the kind that have clear relevance to the pole shift and coming Earth changes predicted in Cayce reading 3976-15, on January 19, 1934. Today's quake was located only 2 degrees south and 5 degrees east of Montague Island, which was the subject of our November 24, 2005, bulletin on the eruption of Mt. Belinda (volcano). ...This volcanic island lies only 1.5 degrees north of 60 degrees south latitude, our chosen boundary within which we say that Antarctica is located. Montagu Island is 'close enough [to Antarctica] for government work,' as the saying goes. \"The strong eruption of Mt. Belinda on the island of Montagu, coming as it does at the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"present time, is but another indication ... that the shifting of the poles may be rapidly approaching.\" Interview: William Hutton, Geologist and Co-Author with Jonathan Eagle © 2004 Earth's Catastrophic Past and Future: A Scientific Analysis of Information Channeled by Edgar Cayce and Webmaster, \"The Hutton Commentaries\": \" In Cayce's reading about Antarctic quakes and pole change, we're not talking about the shift of the magnetic poles (which has happened many times in the Earth's history). That has nothing to do with what the Cayce readings predicted. We're talking about a true shift of the axis of Earth's rotation. I read a book called The Earth's Shifting Axis © 1996 by Mac B. Strain (see amazon.com). Strain gave us a skeleton to work from and Jonathan Eagle, my co-author, developed a computer model to incorporate this theory which was applied for a 1 degree shift down the 122 degree west meridian. THE IDEA OF CHANGING THE ACTUAL POLE ORIENTATION OF THE EARTH, AS OPPOSED TO THE OFTEN-DRIFTING MAGNETIC POLES, RAISES THE QUESTION: WHAT KIND OF ENERGY OR FORCE WOULD IT TAKE TO LITERALLY AFFECT THE ANGLE, THE DEGREE, ON WHICH THE EARTH IS TILTED? As you know, the Earth has a tremendous amount of angular momentum that tends to keep it spinning just like it is. What we are proposing is that it is not the entire ball of the Earth that is tipping over. What we're saying is that the densest part of the Earth, which is the iron core has a density about 6.0 or 8.0, somewhere in that range. It has its own inner momentum. In fact, it seems to be de-coupled from all the rest of the Earth. It's thought to be rotating slightly faster than the surrounding mantle and crust. So, if there are shifts in the interior of the Earth, in the core of the very dense material, there's a good chance this can throw off the equilibrium of the spinning Earth. Then the Earth has to assume a new figure. Or the core has to assume a new figure and that figure is such that the outer crust and mantle will slide right over the inner core. This then is what we think will happen if there is this shift. We're not sure there will be a shift. But that's what we think could happen. The results of such a sliding of the grapefruit skin over the core, if you will, those results are spoken of in several Cayce readings and this is the end point of our speculations. IN CAYCE'S READINGS, WHAT DID HE LINK THIS DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE ANGLE OF THE POLES TO IN TERMS OF OTHER EARTH EVENTS? It means everything because all the other changes that were predicted in two of the very best of the readings all of those changes must fit with a 1 degree pole shift. Here is a more complete text of Cayce's reading 3976-15, on January 19, 1934: 'The earth will be broken up in the western portion of America. The greater portion of Japan must go into the sea. The upper portion of Europe will be changed as in the twinkling of an eye. Land will appear off the east coast of America. There will be the upheavals in the Arctic and in the Antarctic that will make for the eruption of volcanoes in the Torrid areas, and there will be shifting then of the poles - so that where there has been those of a frigid or the semi-tropical will become the more tropical, and moss and fern will grow. And these will begin in those periods in 1958 to 1998, when these will be proclaimed as the periods when His light will be seen again in the clouds.' Cayce's Predicted Time Line Is Off? WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE WORDS AND YOU KNOW THAT CAYCE IN THESE READINGS THOUGHT THIS POLE SHIFT WOULD HAVE OCCURRED BY 2000 TO 2001, AND THAT WE ARE TALKING ON DECEMBER 13, 2005, NO POLE SHIFT HAS OCCURRED TO DATE. WHAT IN YOUR MIND DOES THIS SAY ABOUT THE CAYCE READINGS, THEIR ACCURACY AND PROJECTING INTO THE FUTURE? I'm so glad you asked that because it bothered me tremendously. I began to wonder more deeply about the reliability of the Earth change readings. So, what I did was go back to the time in the 1920s mainly when various people around Cayce, experiencing his first medical"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"readings that were so successful, and then getting the other readings on such things as Atlantis and so on. they began to wonder where the information was coming from. They asked many questions about this. This lead to two chapters in our book that deal with the general reliability of the readings, where the information came from, and what caused errors in the readings that were given? I applied the criterion that I developed from the readings themselves on the validity and credibility of the readings. That includes the fact that the truth of the readings could be wavered . Cayce was a channeler and he could contact millions of subconscious minds. And some that had already passed on. Then there were other sources such as the Akashic Records, archangels, universal consciousness - maybe a dozen sources in all. Then after he contacted a source, if there was a problem in the environment of the reading that is, if the people who were sitting there listening to him might have strong thoughts about some of the material he was covering. Or if he had a cold or other various problems, the material coming through could be wavered. So, I looked at the particular reading which dealt with the years 2000 to 2001. I looked very carefully at this and it's in our book. I decided that a particular reading, which was 826-8, (August 11, 1936) on pole shift, had low predictive value. This is looking back after there was no pole shift and somebody could say this was just my way of covering up for a bad prediction, which is also possible. But let me tell you about this particular reading. It was given for a woman who had lived on Atlantis. Remember reincarnation is through all the Cayce readings. A woman who lived on Atlantis. This is what the reading actually said: Question: ' What great change or the beginning of what change, if any, is to take place in the Earth in the year 2000 to 2001 A. D.?' Answer: 'When there is a shifting of the poles, or a new cycle begins.' This fragment was for a 35-year-old male Protestant lawyer. This fellow was all over the lot with his questions. He asked many things that were not according to the initial suggestion for the reading, which was that he wanted to have the Cayce source comment on his mental and spiritual developments and expression in the present life (1936). It was one of the problems with Cayce that when a person deviated in his questions from those of the initial suggestion given by the conductor of the reading that Cayce would be thrown off and material that came through him was wavered as to the full truth of what was being transmitted to his subconscious mind. The acid test of pole shift and other Earth change predictions is their scientific credibility. If true, momentous societal and political changes are imminent. The geopolitical map of the world will be redrawn. What Jonathan Eagle and I are exploring is the transition from the end of one Age to the beginning of another.\" More Information: C lick on cover to order.
