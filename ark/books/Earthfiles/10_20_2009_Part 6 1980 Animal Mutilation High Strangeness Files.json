It was not a cut, not a laser burn. No cells were destroyed. The excision was separated between cells, cell by cell.” - I ona Hoeppner, Briggsdale High School Science Teacher F rom Fort Collins to Briggsdale to Sterling, Colorado, the red dots on the map include some of the ranching communities where animal mutilations were reported repeatedly in the 1970s and 1980s. R eturn to Part 1 October 20, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - The following continues from Parts 1- 5 about the 1980 animal mutilation high strangeness summary I typed up for my private research files and am now sharing for the first time in this Real X-Files series. This segments continues on September 19, 1980, after Iona Hoeppner's Briggsdale, Colorado, high school lab was broken into and all her mutilated calf samples from the Roland Ball ranch were stolen. Interview Notes from Phone Conversation with Iona Hoeppner on October 15, 1980 The next day on September 19, 1980, Iona Hoeppner called Weld County Sheriff Harold Andrews' office. She did not tell them that her samples were stolen. She wanted to know what the sheriff had learned before, so she told them she had taken samples and wanted to compare her findings with theirs. It took three phone calls over the day to finally get the reluctant answer that the sheriff had sent the samples to the Colorado State University lab in Fort Collins. Iona called the CSU lab and they would not tell her anything. In fact, the person in the lab Iona talked to told her that no specimens had ever arrived from the Weld County Sheriff! Iona knows someone who works in the CSU Chemistry lab where they do work "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"on tissue samples. Iona asked him if he could find out about the samples from Sheriff Andrews and he said he had to worry about his job and family. But he did ask someone in the pathology lab where the specimens were and was told, \"They were misplaced.\" Her friend told Iona, \"The calf specimens were here - I can guarantee you that much.\" WHAT IS GOING ON AT CSU? WHY IS THE LAB LYING? Greeley Tribune Reporter Bill Jackson told me that Sheriff Andrews did find a white, powdery substance around one of the calves that he sampled on September 16, 1980, and sent to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in Denver for analysis. And CBI sent the powder to the CSU lab in Fort Collins. The lab report to CBI was \"Maggot eggs.\" Iona Hoeppner told me, \"That's ridiculous! It did not take me two minutes after seeing that calf to tell me it was a pretty sophisticated operation. I don't think humans have the ability to do what was done to the calf that was fresh enough to analyze.\" Iona examined under a microscope the hide sample she excised that contained both the mutilator cut and Sheriff Andrews' cut. She said that in the mutilator's cut, there were no maggot eggs, nothing. In the Sheriff Andrews cut, there were maggot eggs. On September 20, Iona Hoeppner went back to the Roland Ball ranch to gather more samples. Maggots were everywhere EXCEPT where the mutilators had cut. And there were no maggot eggs on the mutilation cuts. However, the area of the two puncture wounds on the back of the calf's neck was completely destroyed by maggots as of September 20, 1980, four days after the calf mutilations were discovered on September 16, 1980. Iona told me, \"Normally scavenger animals will come and tear away flesh. But there had not been a single scavenger there at all, even by September 20th. \" Of course, the Balls, the Sheriff and his people and Iona Hoeppner had been there September 16 and 18, so there were human odors all over the calf bodies. Iona and I talked about the fact that there had been a lot of young steers and young heifers mutilated in Colorado in 1980 and not many 3 and 4-year-old cows, which were the largest number of mutilated animals in 1975 to 1976. WHY THE DIFFERENCE IN AGES? Iona said the younger animals would be at a hormonal change peak, like our adolescents. She wondered if some check of the plant life that the animals are eating could reveal any differences? WHY TAKE TAIL TASSLE H AIR? \"It's protein, but why is it different from hair elsewhere on the cow's body? \" Iona and I wondered if Sheriff Andrews, or other federal agency, might have ordered the break in of Iona Hoeppner's high school lab to deliberately steal the samples for government confidential analysis? More strangeness occurred. On September 20, 1980, because Iona had all those samples stolen from her lab, she ha gone back to the mutilation site. The Balls knew she was returning and Roland Ball intended to accompany her back to the dead calves, but the Balls had company. So, Iona Hoeppner called up a female friend to go with her. \"I frankly was feeling a bit spooked by then.\" This time, Iona used sterile gloves and said she was extremely careful to get what samples she could. a) Got another fluid sample from the ground. The fluid looked exactly as it had looked on September 18 when she was first there. The reddish fluid was still on top of the soft ground, not soaking in and not evaporating. b) Also, the muscle tissue at the mutilation cuts were still well-preserved. c) Iona also got seven other fluid samples from all over the freshest calf's body, including maggot areas for comparison. She carefully labeled each sample vial. d) Roland Ball had talked to Iona about the break in and wondered if she went out and took ore samples and took them back to the lab"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"would those be stolen, too? So, Iona hid some of her real samples and put some dummy ones in vials that were colored by dyes and put them in the same rack as her first samples on September 18, 1980. The next morning all were gone. After the second theft of mutilated calf samples, she found the door, windows, everything was still locked. But she knew the lab door was easy to jimmy open. The Briggsdale High School Superintendent did not want police in to scare students and parents, so the Superintendent took fine powder and a brush to look for fingerprints around the opened window, door knob, and sample jars. But whoever took the mutilated calf samples made certain no fingerprints were left behind. Everything was clean. Iona Hoeppner said that as far as she knew, only the Superintendent, herself, the Roland Balls and her family knew anything about the second break in and theft of the planted, phony samples. And yet, the Superintendent received a call from the Grover Superintendent who said he heard from a bus driver who heard from people at a football game that there had been TWO BREAK INS at Briggsdale High School and he wanted to know what was going on. Iona Hoeppner still has what she hid away: a) Fluid sample from ground that did not absorb. b) Tissue sample from belly that included the mutilator's cut and Sheriff Andrew's cut. IONA HOEPPNER'S FINDINGS ON SECOND MUTILATED CALF SAMPLES FROM ROLAND BALL RANCH, BRIGGSDALE, COLORADO: Reddish fluid from ground near mutilated calf - Microscopic exam revealed NO CARBON. Therefore, it was not organic. Iona asked some of the local mortuaries about embalming fluids. None knew of any that did not contain carbon. Common non-carbon liquids are acids, bases, salts and water. As an experiment, Iona took water, carbon tet and other liquids, including viscous mineral oil, to the mutilation site to see how those liquids would penetrate the soft ground. All soaked in easily. Even the mineral oil was absorbed, although it took longer than the less viscous liquids. [ Editor's Note: Carbon tetrachloride is an organic compound used as a reagent in synthetic chemistry.] Also, the reddish fluid under the microscope was clear and uniform, except for \"some strange-looking rectangles that I estimate were 10 microns by 3 microns with striations on the rectangles running crosswise. The rectangles did not look like anything I have seen before. \"My first thought was that maybe the strange red fluid rectangles were individual muscle cells. But if so, then the solution should have had carbon in it. I tried hydrogen peroxide in interaction with the strange reddish liquid, but nothing happened. If organic, there would have been some reaction.\" There was no bacteria in the reddish liquid at all. \"It was as sterile as anything I've ever looked at under a microscope and I looked at it both before and after filtering through filter paper to get any soil out. I don't have any equipment powerful enough to see viruses, so I don't know about them, but there was absolutely no bacteria.\" And no abnormal Geiger counter reading either. A month later on October 16, 1980, when I interviewed Iona Hoeppner, I asked her if the reddish fluid was still on the surface of the soil at the Roland Ball ranch in Briggsdale. Iona told me there is a discolored, maroon-brown colored spot left on the soil and all the grass in the immediate area around the calf mutilation site is dead. \"I don't think the liquid evaporated. I think it just slowly sank into the soil,\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Iona said. \"I still ask myself: Why wouldn't the reddish fluid that had no carbon in it be absorbed by loose soil when the water, carbon tet, potassium chloride solutions and salt solutions went down into the ground so easily? That fluid stayed on top of the ground for at least two weeks.\" Iona told me she became convinced that \"in that reddish fluid I examined at the lab under my microscope, those were small crystals 1 x 2 microns and shaped like rectangles that were longer than wide. But there were several sides, more than four and at least six, so the crystal had the appearance of being rounded instead of squared off. The crystals had no attraction for each other. They were just thinly scattered throughout the reddish liquid sample.\" WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THE CRYSTALS IN THE FLUID? Iona said she injected methalin blue and carmine yellow. The fluid took on the dye color, but the crystals did not. Also, the striated, rectangular \"crystals\" that did not take on the color could be seen more easily in the dyed background. \"The fact that the crystals would not take on the dyes also affirms they are not organic.\" WHAT PHYSICAL PROPERTIES WOULD CAUSE THE ODD REDDISH LIQUID TO NOT ABSORB INTO THE GROUND? \"I really don't know why the strange liquid around the mutilated calf did not absorb into the soft soil. It's intriguing and it is scary.\" No Cells Destroyed in Mutilator Excision DID YOU SEE ANYTHING ELSE IN THE OTHER SAMPLES? \"I did careful microscopic exam on the tissue cut from the calf's belly. It was not a cut, not a laser burn. NO CELLS WERE DESTROYED. THE EXCISION WAS SEPARATED BETWEEN CELLS, CELL BY CELL. NO CELL WAS DISTRUPED IN THE MUTILATOR'S CUT. There is nothing that I know of that could do such a thing.\" Iona elaborated explaining there is a natural cohesion between cells - they like to stick together and cuts always destroy their cell walls, which she found in Sheriff Andrews' cuts and the cut she made with her own scalpel. \"But on the microscopic level, those were absolutely perfect cells in the wall of the mutilator's excision.\" WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO SEPARATE SOME OF THAT TISSUE AS ANOTHER SAMPLE THAT COULD GO TO THE SCHOENFELD LAB IN ALBUQUERQUE? [ I had worked with the lab on the Robert Blake horse sample in September 22, 2009 Earthfiles. ] Iona said, \"The tissue sample had been frozen since September 18, and I don't know if the cells would still be so well preserved now or not,\" but she is willing to let the Schoenfeld Lab in Albuquerque examine it, too, if some way to get specimen to that lab without further deterioration. Linda Drives to Briggsdale, Colorado to Get Calf Tissue Samples from Iona Hoeppner I ended up driving up to Briggsdale to receive Iona Hoeppner's package of the unusual tissue in which cells appeared under the microscope to be separated cell by cell. No one knew I was traveling there and that night at the high school was an event in which students and parents were everywhere when I arrived. Iona and I talked briefly in my car, she handed me the package and I turned on the engine of my car to drive off. Immediately, my car was filled with a high-pitched tone. I shut my engine off, but the high-pitched tone was still there. I opened my car door, stood outside listening for the tone, but could not hear it outside my car. I sat back behind the steering wheel, shut the car door, and the high-pitched tone was loud. I debated whether to find a police officer or someone to sit in my car to listen. But I decided I would not risk ridicule of my work at Channel 7. So, I turned on the radio loud enough to nearly cover up the high-pitched tone and drove off."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The trip to my Littleton, Colorado, home then was a little over two hours. The high-pitched tone filled my car all the way into my drive way. I clicked the button to raise the garage door, with an urgent desire to run in the house to get my husband to listen inside my car. But as soon as I entered the garage, the high-pitched noise cut off. I sat in the garage with the engine running for a few seconds with the eerie thought, \"Something has just followed me from Briggsdale to my Littleton home. Now what?\" Right now, no one has a clue about who might be watching Iona Hoeppner or listening in on our phone calls. During our phone conversation, there was a distinct interruption as if a phone on an extension line had been picked up. I decided to say good-bye and hung up. Then I called Iona back in a couple of minutes. There continued to be clicking noises off and on during our lengthy conversation. I asked Iona in that conversation if anyone had seen aerial lights or unusual sounds around the location and time of the September 16, 1980, calf mutilations on the Roland Ball ranch? She said that Tom and Patty Tabor, who live 5 to 7 miles south of Briggsdale, told Iona that on a night somewhere around the time of the mutilations that Mrs. Tabor saw several lights traveling at extreme speed in the night sky. The lights were close together, not too high and then they were gone. Finally, I was stunned after sending Iona Hoeppner's tissue sample to the Schoenfeld Laboratory in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I called the lab for confirmation that the tissue was being studied in the lab and was told that the sample arrived, but \"disappeared and no searches had turned up\" Iona Hoeppner's carefully wrapped package of a sample that would have proved the excision separated cells without cell wall destruction.
