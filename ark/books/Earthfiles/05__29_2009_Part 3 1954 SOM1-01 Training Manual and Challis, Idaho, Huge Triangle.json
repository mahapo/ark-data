Wood, Ph.D., Aerospace Engineer R eturn to Part 1 May 29, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Retired McDonnell-Douglas aerospace engineer, Robert M. Wood, Ph.D., has intensely researched the SOM1-01 document that first appeared as 35mm black and white negative film in a package addressed to Don Berliner of the Fund for UFO Research in Maryland. The package was postmarked March 7, 1994 from LaCrosse, Wisconsin, and bore a return address of a pharmacy in LaCrosse. On the 35mm film were thirty-two pages of text and drawings and the fingers of whoever photographed the pages of the TOP SECRET/MAJIC classified manual. Bob Wood had a 43-year-long career as an aerospace engineer, first working for Douglas Aircraft that merged with the McDonnell Corporation in 1967 to become McDonnell- Douglas, later purchased by Boeing in the early 1990s. Over those four decades, Bob Wood worked on aerodynamic heating, ballistic missile defense, radar, and the space station before his retirement in 1993. That year, nuclear physicist and UFO researcher, Stanton Friedman, had seen the 35mm negative in Berliner's possession and contacted Bob to see if he would be interested in researching what was on the film. Bob Wood agreed and a decade later says, “Basically what was on the 35mm negative is a 32-page manual (including covers and blank pages) dated 1954 which describes for special field units how to recover crashed flying saucers, how to take them apart, how to pack them, where to ship them, how to take care of the bodies and how to keep the public in the dark.” Tri-X Film First Manufactured in 1954 “The original 35mm negative was on Tri-X T-5063 film which was first made in 1954, which incidentally is the date of the document. So, it could have been photographed back then, or it could have been photographed around 1994 or some time in between. The pages that were photographed actually show the fingers of the photographer as he was photographing. For awhile we thought some forensic analysis on those fingers might identify the photographer, but the image isn't very clear and we haven't followed up on that. “The document itself in the photographs is really quite legible except for a few pages. My initial task was to figure out what does it say? After prints were made from the negative and as soon as I started key stroking one page at a time, I thought, ‘Wow! This is a remarkable document!’ I've felt that way ever since.” "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"T his TOP SECRET/MAJIC EYES ONLY warning is every other page throughout the training manual."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"C ontinued in Part 4 - SOM1-01 R eturn to Part 1 E arthfiles would like to learn about other unidentified aerial triangle sightings similar to the illustration in the SOM1-01 1954 training manual, what the Bales brothers saw and what flew over Belgium in March 1990.
