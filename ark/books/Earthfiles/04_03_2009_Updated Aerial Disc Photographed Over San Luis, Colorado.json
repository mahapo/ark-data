Image © 2008 by Susan Sanderford. S an Luis, Colorado, is west of Weston, Cokedale, Trinidad, Hoehne and southwest of Walsenburg. Updated: April 3, 2009 San Luis, Colorado - On March 27, 2009, after my 4-part Earthfiles report was posted about the three, bloodless, cattle mutilations in the Weston to Trinidad to Walsenburg region of southern Colorado, I received the following email and photo (with two enlargements) wondering if the unidentified aerial object seen and photographed over San Luis, Colorado, was similar to the round, silver, aerial craft that Mike Duran saw in February 2009, near Cokedale, about three weeks before his cow mutilation was discovered on March 8. See: 032009 Earthfiles. The photographer is Susan Sanderford, 52, born and raised in Shelbyville, Tennessee, until she was 20-years-old. Then Susan went to Emmaus Bible College between Chicago and Des Moines, Iowa, where she met her first husband. Later she remarried and lived in Sedona, Arizona, before moving about three years ago to San Luis, Colorado, to work with her current husband in the development of a spiritual center in which she can help others with her intuitive medium gift that connects the living with loved ones who have passed over for emotional, mental and physical healing. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"It was in that context that her family and friends in San Luis on September 18, 2008, between 11 AM and about 2 PM were erecting a wooden totem of Mother Mary when Susan took a series of photographs that included one image that contained an unidentified, round aerial object that seems to emanate golden light below it. Subject: UFOs and San Luis Valley Cattle Mutilations Date: March 27, 2009 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com “Hi Linda, I live in the San Luis Valley in the little town of San Luis, Colorado, on the west side of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, 60 miles from Walsenburg. I heard Mike Duran talking about the UFO he saw perhaps connected with his cow's mutilation (discovered March 8, 2009, in Weston, Colorado). I was wondering if you could pass these photos on to him to see if this is the craft he saw?

See: 032009 Earthfiles. Image © 2008 by Susan Sanderford. This digital photo was taken on September 18, 2008, in the San Luis Valley. I saw one of these with my own eyes earlier in the day about 1/2 mile away and 1/2 mile up in the air. I looked down to lay my watering hose on the ground so I could get a closer look, but when I looked back the UFO was gone. (No camera then.) Two day later I found this (UFO) in a picture I had taken of the totem pole we had just installed. I was just interested to see if this was the same craft as Mike Duran saw (in We st on). Thanks Susan Sanderford” Update April 3, 2009: Mike Duran, Rancher, Weston, Colorado: “The top original photograph (not next two blow ups) resembles what I saw in the sky in mid-February 2008 near Cokedale, but the aerial object I saw was more silvery - maybe because the sun was late in the afternoon and glinting at just the right angle off something silver. But the size of the round or oval shaped object in Susan's original photo looks pretty much the same as the size of what I saw.” Mike Duran's cow was found bloodlessly mutilated on March 8, 2009, about three weeks after he saw the round, silver aerial object near Cokedale.

Susan Sanderford, Spiritual Intuitive Medium, Casa de Santa Maria, San Luis, Colorado: “We had purchased a 10.5 foot tall totem pole carving of Mother Mary to be installed in the center of the prayer and meditation garden we’re building out in San Luis. After waiting for 2.5 years to have the statue carved, it finally arrived and on September 18, 2008, we were raising the statue that day, putting it in the ground. We had probably about eight people there helping us. Interestingly enough, I had the thought the day before ‘Wouldn’t it be fun if the extraterrestrials that make the circles in England show up and watch us put the Mother Mary carving in the ground.’ Just a fleeting thought."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"C arved wooden Mother Mary statue erected in the Casa de Santa Maria totem site 5 miles south of San Luis, Colorado, on September 18, 2008.

We were probably there around 11 AM, the statue got there, the hole was dug. Working on it around 1 PM, as I am holding the hose with water coming out, I looked up in the sky and about a half-mile to the north and then a half-mile off the ground, there set this oval craft with sunlight shining off it. The sun was at such an angle that the sunlight was shining off the object really brilliantly, but I could tell it was an oval craft and I looked at it and thought, ‘Oh, that’s interesting!’ I put the hose down and looked back up to get a closer look and it was gone. I said to the rest of the people who didn't see it, ‘Oh, I just saw a UFO.’ It didn’t bother me, but I got this really strong intuitive impression that They were watching us. WHAT DID YOU SEE IN THAT QUICK GLANCE? I saw a round, oval craft that looked silver on the bottom and really brilliantly white on the top because of the direction the sun was shining off of it. The aircraft was not moving. It was just sitting there. I was trying to process in my mind – ‘Could this be a plane?’ But thinking, ‘Planes don’t fly that low and I don’t hear any noise.’ That’s when I put the hose down and looked back up and the craft had disappeared. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? We went on with installing our statue. No one else besides me saw it. We took a lot of photographs of the Mary statue after she was embedded in the ground. It was not until two days later that I’m looking at the photographs and noticed the white dot in the background sky. As I zoomed in on the dot, I realized we had captured a photo of – I don’t know if it was the same object or another one – but I was facing south taking the photo, so it was south of us and probably had to be a mile away and maybe not more than a few hundred feet off of the horizon. When I looked at it, I was shocked and went to get my husband. I said, ‘Look! There is the object I saw. This is exactly what it looked like.’ So, somehow we captured the object on a photograph without even knowing it was in the camera lens when we took the photograph! I’M LOOKING AT YOUR PHOTOGRAPH NOW. WOULD YOU SAY THIS APPEARS TO HAVE A DARK CENTER ON THE BOTTOM?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Yes, it’s as if the sun shining on it is making it darker like a shadow. I blew up the photograph and it looks like there is some energy that showed up underneath the oval craft – kind of a golden color, which I thought was really interesting. In the photograph, you can tell it’s just sitting there not moving. HOW MANY PHOTOGRAPHS DID YOU TAKE OF YOUR NEWLY ERECTED TOTUM? I took a whole bunch of them and that was the only photograph it showed up in. ONE OUT OF HOW MANY PHOTOS? I think we took about 20 to 25 pictures. And it was the only one I took of a direct facing toward the totem statue. The others were people doing things, but interestingly enough, there is a pink energy light coming from the corner down right onto the statue. My intuitive feeling, Linda, was that They were watching what we were doing. Here's the specs for my camera which captured the UFO: HP Photosmart R742 7.0 Megapixels 5.9mm - 17.7 mm zoom — zoom not used WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PHOTO, WHAT INTUITIVELY COMES TO YOUR MIND ABOUT WHAT IS INSIDE OF THE OVAL OBJECT? My intuitive sense is they were off-world beings because mentally, I asked them to show up. So, to me that means whoever was in that craft had an extremely powerful connection to intuition – or telepathic thought communication – that I sent that message and they showed up. I can’t get a sense of a benevolent or malevolent presence – just the strong overwhelming feeling that They were from off-world and just watching, curious about what we were doing raising that carved Mary statue. I do get a strong sense that they were off-world and not any military experiment. I really felt what ever was in that round craft were off-world.” If any one else in the San Luis, Weston, Trinidad, Hoehne and Walsenburg region has seen any unusual aerial craft recently, please email me: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.
