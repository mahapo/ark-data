Who knows who the winners and losers will be in the next go round?\" \" - K en Caldeira, Ph.D., Carnegie Institution E arth photograph by NASA. December 7, 2006 Stanford, California - An extraordinary burst of global warming that occurred around 55 million years ago dramatically reversed Earth's pattern of ocean currents. That global warming event is called the \"Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum,\" or PETM.\" Back then, Earth's average surface global temperature rose rapidly by about 9 degrees Fahrenheit (5 degrees Celsius) in less than ten thousand years. In a new December 8, 2006, Science journal report, scientists Ken Caldeira, Ph.D., of the Carnegie Institution's Department of Global Ecology at Stanford University, and Mark Pagani, Ph.D., research team leader at Yale University, report they have found that the Earth's global warming 55 million years ago might have resulted from the Earth climate's \"high sensitivity to a long-term release of carbon.\" This finding contradicts the position held by many climate-change skeptics that the Earth system is resilient to carbon dioxide and methane emissions. For some years, scientists have known that the ancient global warming event, the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, caused a massive release of carbon. The temperature rise on Earth lasted for 170,000 years and caused profound changes to the world's rainfall patterns, made the oceans acidic, and affected oceanic and terrestrial plant and animal life, including spawning the rise of our modern primate ancestors. \"But understanding just how much carbon was responsible for the temperature increase and where it came from remained elusive,\" reports Carnegie Institution. \"Now the new calculations used data from carbon found in fossils of ancient land plants and tiny marine organisms known as plankton. 'We can tell that the amount of carbon released to the atmosphere and ocean was more or less the same as what is available today as coal, oil and gas,' Caldeira explains. 'The carbon heated up the Earth for over 100,000 years. If the climate was as insensitive to CO2 as the climate skeptics claim, there would be no way to make the Earth so warm for so long.'\" The source of the ancient carbon spike is still a mystery. It might have come from massive fires burning coal and other ancient plant material, or it could have come from \"burps\" of methane from the continental shelves. Caldeira: \"By examining fossils and ancient sediments on the sea floor, we can see that something very unusual happened to Earth's carbon cycle. At the same time, the climate near the North Pole became like Miami, Florida. We can tell it did not take all that much carbon to make this change in climate. If ancient methane 'burps' really occurred, as many believe, a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration would warm the Earth by over 10 "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"degrees Fahrenheit (5.6 degrees Celsius). If that's what happened, we could now be in for a mighty toasty future.\" If the source of the carbon release was ancient plant material, calculations indicate that for each doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration, the Earth would warm at least 4 degrees Fahrenheit (2.2 degrees Celsius), and possibly twice this much. If ancient methane was the cause, as many believe, our current situation is even more dire. The methane would have become carbon dioxide in the atmosphere within decades. The current research indicates that much less methane would have been available to cause climate change 55 million years ago, which means that the climate of the Earth is even more sensitive to added CO2 than originally thought. With a continuation of current trends in the use of coal, oil and gas, natural background atmospheric CO2 concentrations are expected to double around the middle of this 21st Century. The ancient emissions 55 million years ago are comparable to the CO2 that is expected to be emitted from human activities over this and coming centuries. So, if human-produced carbon emissions continue as they are, there could be a very serious impact on Earth's surface life and species evolution. Caldeira: \"The last time carbon was emitted to the atmosphere on the scale of what we are doing today, there were winners and losers. There was ecological devastation, but new species rose from the ashes. Luckily for us, our ancient primate ancestors were winners. Who knows who the winners and losers will be in the next go round?\" \"Our carbon dioxide emissions are risking biological, chemical and climate changes of a magnitude that has not been seen for more than 50 million years. Our work provides even more incentive to develop the clean energy sources that can provide for economic growth and development without risking the natural world that is our endowment.\" More Information: For further information about global warming, please see the Earthfiles Archives: • 11/09/2006 -- Outer Space Sunshade to Cool Earth in Global Warming? • 09/09/2006 -- Methane - Another Threat in Global Warming • 08/23/2006 -- Solar Cycle 24 - Headed for Intense X Flares by 2010-2012? • 08/19/2006 -- Repair of Earth's Ozone Layer Has Slowed • 07/18/2006 -- 2006 - Hottest Year So Far in U.
