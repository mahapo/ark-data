October 17, 2003 Florence, Kentucky - Since August 2003, many Ohio residents have seen large, strange, unidentified objects in the sky. Many of those reports have reached Kenny Young, an award-winning TV producer-writer- director who works full time as InfoChannel Coordinator for the Telecommunications Board of Northern Kentucky in Florence, Kentucky. In his off-hours, out of personal curiosity, Kenny produces and reports the UFO Research website, http://home.fuse.net/ufo. Interview: Kenny Young, Award-winning TV producer-writer-director; Coordinator, InfoChannel for Telecommunications Board of Northern Kentucky; and reporter of the UFO Research website, http://home.fuse.net/ufo, Florence, Kentucky: \"Certainly we've had more than our normal share of UFO sightings in Ohio, including with the most recent on October 15, 2003, in Hamilton, Ohio. That was an object witnessed by Mr. Stuart Linder who I did speak with shortly after the sighting. The object he described was very unusual, sounding like an upside down diamond that rotated with multi-colored lights. Mr. Linder indicated that the object was visible for almost a ten minute duration and made a rapid departure that he said was of extreme acceleration. I found that report to be quite interesting in the context of many other reports from southern Ohio recently. We've had several dramatic reports from Adams County, from Hillsboro, Ohio, several reports. Also from southern Ohio regions around Canton, Akron and Proctorville, people have observed unusual lights in the sky. WHAT WOULD BE THE MOST UNUSUAL THAT YOU'VE HEARD IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS, GIVEN THAT YOU'VE BEEN GETTING REPORTS FROM OHIO FOR SOME TIME? I received a very dramatic report from a gentleman in Gahanna, Ohio, northeast of Columbus. He explained to me that he had observed a tremendous object. He described this as a monster object that appeared over Gahanna. The gentleman described to me as he was driving his car toward town, this tremendous sized object literally filled the windshield of his car.\" Gahanna, marked in yellow, northeast of Columbus where the family of four saw huge disk on September 22, 2003, at sunset. Gahanna, Ohio Family Sees Huge Disk A computer analyst husband, his wife, their 9-year-old son and 13-year-old daughter were driving home in Gahanna, Ohio, on September 22, around 8 p.m. The sun was low on the horizon right above the tree line. Suddenly, all four saw a huge, dark disk-shaped object surrounded by changing colored lights appear in front of the setting sun. The family has asked not to have their names used in"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"this report, but gave permission to share their experiences in hopes that other eyewitnesses in Gahanna might have seen the same, bizarre object. The husband and wife told me this week that they were all shocked by the huge disk. Mr. \"Smith,\" Gahanna, Ohio: \"Because we couldn't really believe what we were seeing. It was not an airplane, a blimp, any type of aircraft I'm familiar with, and it was big enough to fit at least three or four 747 jumbo jets in it. Drawing of large disk-shaped aerial object above car by Mr. \"Smith,\" who was driving to Gahanna, Ohio, home with his wife, 9-year-old son and 13-year-old daughter on September 22, 2003, at 8 p.m. WHAT WAS IT THAT MADE THIS SO EXTRAORDINARY? It made no sound whatsoever. Something that size usually makes quite a bit of noise. When we first saw it, there were lights, and the lights seemed to change color. Then the lights went out and the object turned totally black. When I said it turned black, it turned absolutely black. Not like it was black paint, but almost like it was sucking in the light around it. I mean it was pitch black. It started with lights on it. After the lights shut off, it was just black.\" Drawing by Mrs. \"Smith,\" age 31, of large disk-shaped aerial object as it moved slowly and closely over the family's Honda, blocking out their view of the sunset, on September 22, 2003, at 8 p.m. Mrs. \"Smith,\" Gahanna, Ohio: \" It almost looked like an oval or big frisbee! WHAT WERE THE COLOR OF THE LIGHTS THAT YOU SAW AND WHERE WERE THEY? They were going all in a line, not flashing like you would see red, orange and pink and then they would just disappear and the lights were gone. So, we all looked at each other and said, 'OK, where did it go?' I sped up to drive and go look for it and we couldn't find it. It was like we looked down for a minute and looked back and it was gone. HOW HIGH IN THE SKY DO YOU THINK THIS OBJECT WAS? If it had been an airplane, it would have crashed into my house that's how low it was. The sun was actually setting in the sky at the horizon and this thing passed at about the same level from our angle where we were and literally completely blocked the sun out for a good fifteen seconds. It was moving very slow, and the size of it took forever to go across the tree line. And for something that big to not make a sound and then take off somewhere with no trace seemed pretty unbelievable. IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW IF ANYBODY ELSE AROUND 8 P.M. ON SEPTEMBER 22, IN GAHANNA, OHIO, SAW THIS OBJECT BLOCK THE SUN?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"If they did, I want to know! I don't want to be the only people who saw something that large in the sky. Impossible. We couldn't have been. Or maybe if we had been at the right angle at the right time. But somebody else had to see it. It had to be over the freeway. It had to be as big as it looks. We were only two blocks away from the freeway.\" Drawing on left by 13-year-old daughter.

Ohio Crop Formations and Upsurge of Aerial Objects KENNY, IN THE SUMMER OF 2003, THERE WERE SOME REMARKABLE CROP FORMATIONS IN OHIO ASSOCIATED WITH MILITARY ACTIVITY AROUND THE SEIP AND SERPENT MOUNDS. DID YOU GET ANY REPORTS ABOUT UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS AROUND THAT AUGUST 24, 2003 TO SEPTEMBER 9, 2003, PERIOD OF TIME? Kenny Young: \"I tell you we had so many reports that involved multi-colored objects and lights. But what really surprised me were the number of reports in which people described large objects, tremendous objects. In addition to the Gahanna, Ohio sighting, there was an eyewitness from Seaman, Ohio, which is estimated to be around seven miles south of the Adams County Crop formation (Serpent Mound.) This person also describes a very large triangular-shaped object that had head lights that the witness said was situated around the outer rim of the triangle. It was visible in the night sky and the object had brilliant lights which rotated around it. DID ANYONE REPORT SEEING ANY OBJECT IN THE SKY LOWER TO THE GROUND? There was a Hillsboro sighting that was investigated by researcher, Donny Blessing, from southern Ohio MUFON (Mutual UFO Network.) The object was very low to the ground and seen by residents near a trailer park in the area. This, I believe, was on August 22, and we have looked at this sighting with interest because it was shortly after this that the crop formation was discovered adjacent to the legendary Serpent Mound burial site in Adams County. It was at ll p.m. in the evening. It was a very peculiar object with a ring of yellow lights that apparently, the witness claims, came low overhead. We tried to do some follow up by contacting the Highland county Sheriff's Department. They had nothing, of course, in their logs about this sighting. But nevertheless, we were impressed by the report and much to our surprise the day after we find out that a crop circle appeared in this locality. So, we are left wondering exactly what is going on here (in Ohio)?\" More Information: If anyone has more information about the Gahanna, Ohio, disk of September 22, 2003, at 8 p.m. CT, please contact me: earthfiles@earthfiles.com We b s it e : http://home.fuse.net/ufo Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
