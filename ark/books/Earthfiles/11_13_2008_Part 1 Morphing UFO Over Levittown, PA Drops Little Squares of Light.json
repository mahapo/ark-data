When three oval-shaped lights appeared on the bottom ... sparkling little squares of light came down in a triangular pattern and surrounded the privet bush and silver maple tree.” - R obert Gardner, PA MUFON L eft: Digital image of curved cylinder, or boomerang aerial object, that morphed into middle pink-colored disc. Right: The pink disc then flashed three oval, white lights on its bottom surface and “little squares of light” dropped like snow in the air around privet bush and silver maple tree, but never reached the ground, floating three feet above yard. Half a dozen sightings April through July 2008, Levittown, Pennsylvania. Image and drawings by resident and eyewitness. A bout thirteen miles northeast of Philadelphia up the Delaware River is Levittown. Close to Levittown is the Oxford Valley Mall, marked with red star above. 2008 UFO reports have ranged from an unidentified aerial object over the mall in January to a series of sightings over a Levittown apartment complex that involved the “snowfall” of little squares of light. November 13, 2008 Levittown, Pennsylvania - On July 13, 2008, I received a phone call from Robert Gardner, MUFON Field Investigator living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Bob wanted to know if I knew a scientist who could analyze “glitter” that had fallen from a pink-colored, aerial disc over an apartment complex in Levittown. Bob's had talked with an eyewitness who first left him with the impression that sparkling, physical material had fallen onto a privet bush growing next to the female eyewitness's apartment. After I asked "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"questions in order to get physical material to a scientist who helps me with energy dispersive spectroscopy and other laboratory tests, Bob learned that there was no physical material. But the eyewitness wanted to know what might have happened to the privet bush growing next to her apartment door. She was alarmed when she found a dead bird near the privet bush the next day after the April 20, 2008, sighting. Later on, the female eyewitness's daughter would also see the aerial craft. By July 20th, a week after his first phone inquiry, Bob gave me a phone update about his progress in trying to understand the complexities of a case that involved half a dozen morphing UFO appearances over the same apartment and yard between April and July 2008 by a strange aerial craft that changed from a boomerang shape to a pink disc shape that flashed three oval lights from its bottom surface, and eventually would disperse what looked like little squares of light. R obert Gardner working at his home as a MUFON Field Investigator in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Robert Gardner Summary of Field Notes on July 20, 2008 1) First Levittown Apartment Event: April 20, 2008, 3 AM Eastern The first sighting was on April 20, 2008, at 3 AM, after the eyewitness's dog woke her up barking and she took the dog outside. That’s when she saw an object hovering in the sky. The word “cylinder” has been used to describe what the female eyewitness saw, but in fact the mother’s own digital photograph shows a curving, banana-shaped aerial object that changed shape to a disc. On April 20th, the object did emit a cone of light, but nothing else came out, no glittering material. WHAT WAS THE FIRST SHAPE SHE SAW? A cylinder (curved banana-shape or boomerang). D igital image taken on July 8, 2008, at 4:10 AM Eastern, by Levittown, Pennsylvania, apartment resident and eyewitness. THEN THE BOOMERANG CRAFT CHANGED SHAPE? Yes, it changes shape into a pink-colored disc. The object hovered in the sky, emitting the beam and then she went inside because she was scared. DID SHE ESTIMATE HOW HIGH THE OBJECT WAS ABOVE HER? She said the altitude was “treetops” about one mile away."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"B oomerang morphed into pink-colored disc. Sketch by Levittown, Pennsylvania, apartment resident and eyewitness. 2) Second Levittown Apartment Event: May 2008, 2 AM Eastern The strange aerial object was changing shape from circle/sphere to disc to banana-shaped cylinder. Eyewitness did not file a MUFON report - the May 2008 sighting came up in discussion with her about other sightings. 3) Third Levittown Apartment Event: June 12, 2008, 1 AM Eastern This is the first event with the sparkly “flakes,” or “little squares of light,” coming down around the privet bush near her apartment door and a silver maple tree about 65 feet away in her apartment yard. P rivet bush about 15 feet high grows next to eyewitness's apartment back door in Levittown, Pennsylvania, where “little squares of light” first fell on June 12, 2008, from a pink-colored aerial disc and surrounded the privet bush and a silver maple tree about 65 feet away. Image © 2008 by Robert Gardner. The morphing aerial object was about 60 to 100 feet away from where she stood in her Levittown yard near privet bush. When three oval-shaped lights appeared on the bottom, sparkly material came from both sides of the disc. The sparkling little squares of light came down in a triangular pattern and surrounded the privet bush and silver maple tree. WHAT WAS THE SHAPE OF THE MORPHING AERIAL CRAFT WHEN IT EMITTED THE SPARKLING ‘FLAKES’? Circular with three oval lights appearing on the bottom of the disc."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"A rtistic highlight of three oval lights that were actually on the bottom surface of the pink-colored disc. From two sides of pink disc after oval lights flashed on, the small squares of sparkling light fell in a pyramid-shaped pattern for about twenty minutes on June 12, 2008, around 1 AM Eastern. Draw ing by Levittown, Pennsylvania, eyewitness. R ed X marks where female eyewitness (mother) stood on June 12, 2008, watching the little squares of light fall in air around her privet bush (green circle) and the silver maple tree at left (light blue circle). The silver maple tree to right was later used as a control tree for sample collection and analysis to study biochemical and biophysical changes in the affected privet and maple leaves. Sketch by Robert Gardner, MUFON, on July 18, 2008, not drawn to scale. WERE BEAMS EMITTING THE SPARKLY FLAKES? No, no beams, just the metallic-sparkling “ flakes” raining down. AS THE SPARKLES FELL, YOU SAID THEY FORMED A KIND OF TRIANGULAR PATTERN DROPPING AROUND THE PRIVET AND SILVER MAPLE? Yes, the metallic-looking, sparkly, flakes came down in a pyramid-shaped pattern falling, but she didn't see any beams of light - just the sparkly pieces falling in a pattern shaped like a pyramid."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"U pper pink-colored disc with three oval lights, estimated by eyewitness to be about 60 to 100 feet above her. The grey pencil lines in triangular pattern represent the many little squares of sparkling light (about 1-inch square) that fell in air around the privet bush and silver maple 65 feet away on June 12, 2008, for an estimated twenty minutes. Sketch by Robert Gardner, MUFON, on July 18, 2008, not drawn to scale. DID THE MOTHER EYEWITNESS SAY THE SPARKLES HAD ANY COLOR? Yes, silver flakes that were glowing like – the analogy she used while we were sitting in her house – she has a wine cabinet with wine glasses in it and track lights inside. The light was reflecting off the wine glasses, and she compared the wine glass reflections with what she saw falling from the pink disc - as bright as the light reflecting off glasses in her cabinet. DID SHE ESTIMATE THE LENGTH AND SHAPE OF EACH OF THE FLAKES? They were sort of like small, silver-shining pieces of tinfoil in little squares. Little Squares of Light Never Touched Ground THEY WERE SMALL SQUARES? Yes. They were glittering, but nothing physical fell on the ground. ON THAT JUNE 12TH NIGHT, DID SHE TRY TO TOUCH THE SPARKLING FLAKES? No, she did not approach them. The sparkling things came down to about three feet off the ground. THEN THE GLITTERY FLAKES STOPPED DESCENDING? Yes, and they were just hanging around floating in the air for about 20 minutes. BOTH TREES WERE SURROUNDED BY THE GLITTERING, SMALL, SQUARE FLAKES? Ye s . BUT NOTHING EVER REACHED THE GROUND. Correct. Little Squares of Light “Sucked Back Up” to Disc THEN WHAT HAPPENED? All the glittering flakes got sucked back up to the aerial craft all at once. It all just went back up to the pink disc, all suddenly at the same moment."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"DID THE EYEWITNESS NOTICE IF THE PINK AERIAL DISC CHANGED SHAPE AT THAT POINT? Yes, it went back to the bluish-white curved cylinder or boomerang shape. DID THE CRAFT REMAIN STATIONARY IN THE AIR? At that point, she didn't watch any more, but went back inside because it was a weird experience for her. IS THE VERY NEXT EVENT THE JULY 8TH NIGHT IN WHICH SHE GOT PHOTOGRAPHS AS WELL? Ye s . 4) Fourth Levittown Apartment Event: July 8, 2008, 4:10 AM Eastern Three Digital Images WHY WAS SHE UP ? The dog woke her again. SHE GOES OUT INTO HER BACK YARD AND WHAT IS THE FIRST THING SHE SEES AND HEARS? Rob reads mother eyewitness comments: “I was out in the yard with my dog. It was 4:10 AM Eastern on July 8, 2008 (Tuesday). I looked up in the sky and saw four lights on the craft. Three looked like two eyes and a nose. Bright headlights were further away, but part of the aerial object. There was a pink-colored light in the front of the object. There was a blue fog that came out of the back of the object.” She said the aerial object was again changing shapes, almost “wiggling” into different forms from a boomerang-shape to a disc that flashed the triangle of oval lights underneath. This time, the prominent colors she saw were red, green, blue and a pink-rose. I guess the pink-rose was the front light and the blue was the fog and green and red were on the craft. The photos I have from her, the lights look something like a triangle. WHEN SHE WAS WAKED UP BY HER DOG AT 4:10 AM ON JULY 8TH, DID SHE GRAB A DIGITAL CAMERA ON HER WAY OUT TO THE BACK YARD? Yes, and that’s how she photographed the three images I have. The glittery flakes did not come out on the pictures, but the curved banana-shape of the object did. HOW MANY IMAGES DID SHE TAKE? I’ve got three and she did a drawing of one. AS THE BLUE FOG CAME OUT OF THE BOOMERANG-SHAPED CRAFT, WHAT HAPPENED NEXT? Like she saw it before on June 12, 2008, the boomerang morphed to the disc and a triangle pattern of falling silver, glittering flakes came down around the privet bush and silver maple. There was no beam of light. The flakes were raining down in the wide pyramid pattern similar to June 12, and were glowing for about 20 minutes around the bush and tree. Then all the glittery flakes were sucked back up to the aerial craft simultaneously. JUST LIKE THE JUNE 12TH INCIDENT? Ye s . DID THE EYEWITNESS SEE ANY GLITTERY FLAKE MATERIAL REMAIN IN THE PRIVET OR SILVER MAPLE? No. Nothing remained. I’VE ASKED BIOPHYSICIST LEVENGOOD TO ANALYZE THE SAMPLES YOU ARE SENDING HIM BECAUSE THE PRIVET AND THE SILVER MAPLE HAVE BOTH BEEN EXPOSED ON JUNE 12 AND JULY 8 TO THE GLITTERY MATERIAL AND HE WILL TRY TO DETERMINE IF THE PLANTS HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO MICROWAVE RADIATION, PLASMAS OR ANY OTHER EVIDENCE OF HEATING? I did find another silver maple tree there 75 feet away from the affected silver maple tree."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THAT’S CLOSE FOR A CONTROL SAMPLE, BUT IF THAT’S THE ONLY ONE YOU CAN FIND, LET'S SAMPLE IT AS A CONTROL. The woman said the glittery flakes just stayed in the area of the privet and silver maple 65 feet from the privet. So, the other silver maple at the end of the property is about 75 feet southeast from the affected silver maple. So, the second silver maple should work as a control. 5) Fifth Levittown Apartment Event: July 10, 2008, 2 AM to 2:45 AM Eastern Two eyewitnesses this time - mother and her daughter. Mother called the daughter to alert her that the aerial craft was back in the sky and both watched from their separate residences in the Levittown apartment complex. Daughter called Robert Gardner at 2:45 AM to say that the object was back and was moving around in the sky, but no sparkling flakes. She and her mother had watched the aerial object changing shape between 2 AM to 2:45 AM, changing from circular to the blue-white, boomerang-shaped cylinder that morphed into a disc and kept repeating shape changes. Everything was the same as the previous four sightings, except no sparkling flakes. 6) Sixth Levittown Apartment Event: July 16, 2008, Between 1 AM to 4 AM Eastern 18 images and 6 short videos on Kodak Easy Share camera What showed up was more of a banana-shaped cylinder that appears longer than the boomerang craft in the July 8th images. This object was changing back and forth between a disc and the banana-shaped cylinder. The mother took 18 images and 6 short videos with her Kodak Easy Share camera that can take both still images and short video. The aerial object in the images and videos looked more round like a horseshoe crab without a tail. The mother was out in the parking lot in front of the town home apartments this time, not in her back yard where the privet and silver maple grow.” C ontinued in Part 2: Biophysical and biochemical changes in privet and maple leaves More Information: I would appreciate hearing from other eyewitnesses of strange aerial light events in the United States and world.
