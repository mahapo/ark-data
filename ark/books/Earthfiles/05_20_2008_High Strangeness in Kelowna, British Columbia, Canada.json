Okanagan Lake is about 90 miles long and is famous for reports of an “Ogopogo” creature similar to the Loch Ness monster in Scotland. May 19, 2008 Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada - This past week I have been in the Okanagan Lake region of British Columbia, Canada, about two hours north of Spokane, Washington. Okanagan Lake runs north and south for 90 miles and is famous in Canada as one of the warmest and driest regions where grape vineyards, fruit trees and all kinds of berries grow. Okanagan Lake itself is famous for high strangeness. The Native American Indians said there was an “Ogopogo” in the lake, which translates as “lake monster.” No one has produced public photographs of the creature, but alleged eyewitnesses have sketched three or four snake-like loops breaking the water that look very similar to the Loch Ness monster illustrations in Scotland.

[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “ Ogopogo of Lake Okanagan was described by Native Indians as a N'ha-a-itk, or lake demon, living in the lake long before white men arrived. In modern times, Ogopogo sightings are reported each year of a creature some 20 to 50 feet long, with a horse shaped head and an undulating serpent like body. Sightings have been reported throughout the length of the lake, but the monster appears to favor an area just south of Kelowna in waters near Peachland. It is usually reported as dark blue, black or brown with a lighter underside. It can move with astounding speed, but many sightings in calm weather have been made of the creature apparently feeding on either fish or aquatic weeds. People very close, between 50 and 100 feet, report seeing fins or feet on the animal.” ] July 2, 2007: UFO War Over Lake Okanagan?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"L ake Okanagan from Kelowna, B. C. downtown park. Image © 2008 by Linda Moulton Howe. Only one year ago on Monday, July 2, 2007, around 10:45 to 11 PM, several eyewitnesses from the Kelowna to Winfield region of Lake Okanagan saw differently shaped aerial craft, which seemed to be at war with each other. One July 2nd, Kelowna eyewitness reported that around 10:45 PM, “I saw two objects in the sky just hovering. One craft was thin and long. The other was triangular in shape. They kept hovering there so I got up quickly to run and grab my camera. But the next thing I know before I take any photos, I hear a small bang, almost like a gunshot. The long object begins to hurtle towards earth on fire, making a deep bass sound like a nuclear generator. And I’m thinking to myself, ‘What the hell?!’ “I watched the falling object and it disappeared at low altitude behind a small hill between my neighborhood and the lake. I look up and see the triangular object make a small circle in the sky and then come a little lower and then I see it start to hurtle towards the sky at a fast rate. “Then the long thing reappears from behind the hill. It’s no longer on fire and it’s ascending at breakneck speed and it gets higher going after the triangle-shaped object. I see the long thing literally shoot something at the triangle object and then a very loud bang and then the triangular craft was no longer visible. The long thing started to search the sky. It was going north, the south, then east and west – very quickly, almost like a hummingbird when it goes side-to-side. “Then the object disappeared and I suppose its departure broke the sound barrier because immediately I heard that sonic boom when the sound barrier is broken. After my many years of watching the skies, I finally saw what seemed like two E. T.s duking it out.” Fifteen minutes later at 11 PM, another eyewitness of warring UFOs in Westbank near Kelowna also saw a flaming object splash into Lake Okanagan and from there, rose back out of the water chasing after another aerial object in the sky. It is assumed that the eyewitnesses were watching the same astounding event, but estimated the two different times of 10:45 and 11 PM. A woman walking her dog said that it looked like a “ torpedo on fire crashed into the lake and created a big splash of water.” She also heard a loud, base “womp, womp, womp” sound as the fiery torpedo came down. That woman emailed Brian Vike of Houston, British Columbia UFO Research and she wrote: “I don’t know what happened last night, but it was the most frightening, incredible and down right terrifying thing I have ever seen.” She described the fiery torpedo - that the other person called “long” – falling into the lake and then explained, “it, or something, came literally shooting back out of the water and I saw it hurtle towards a different-looking object very high in the sky.” The woman said the higher object she saw looked cone-shaped. In her email, she wrote: “I saw what looked like you see in a Star Wars movie and they have bullets or lasers that are kind of blasting out of things (that were) coming from that torpedo-object that was in the lake and I heard a loud bang that knocked me off my feet. I looked up to see what the heck was going on and the cone-shaped object was gone and the torpedo-shaped craft was just hovering, moving from side-to-side, almost like it was confused. Then there was a loud sonic boom and it was gone.” Other strange aerial objects over Lake Okanagan, Black Mountain and other sites in the region were reported into September 2007. But a spokesman for Navigation Canada said, “There were no radar reports of unusual craft in the area.”"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Corina Saebels, Kelowna Resident and UFO Experiencer C orina Saebels, Kelowna resident, experiencer in the UFO human abduction syndrome and author of The Collectors © 2007. Image © 2008 by Linda Moulton Howe. One Kelowna resident who is convinced the strange aerial craft are under the control of very advanced non-human intelligences is Corina Saebels, now 51-years-old. Corina was born in Brussels, Belgium, on August 14, 1956. By age five, in 1961, Corina’s parents had moved to Montreal, Canada, where she had her first encounter with large-eyed grey beings, which were to follow her the rest of her life to date, including after she moved to Kelowna in 1994 with her own daughter, Nicole (now 20), and two sons, Chris (now 23) and Michael (now 25). Corina Saebels is the author of a 2007 book entitled, The Collectors. I met with her and Nicole in Kelowna, B. C., in the week of May 12-16, 2008, and I asked Corina why she titled her 2007 book The Collectors? O rder from: Corina Saebels. Interview: Corina Saebels, Author, The Collectors © 2007, Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada: “Because that’s what these beings have done our whole lives. My children and I have been visited by them, starting with me at about the age of five. They have come and collected blood samples, eggs, sperm from my son, hair samples, and they have even removed fetuses from my daughter and myself."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"WE’VE HEARD THE DESCRIPTION OF WHAT SOME PEOPLE CALL A GENETIC HARVEST FROM HUMANS GOING BACK AT LEAST 30 TO 35 YEARS. TODAY, AT AGE 51 GOING BACK TO YOUR FIRST ENCOUNTER AT AGE 5, WHAT IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE TODAY ABOUT WHY THESE BEINGS WOULD BE HARVESTING AND COLLECTING GENETIC MATERIAL FROM YOU AND OTHERS? There are many different ideas about why these beings are doing this. Perhaps the non-humans have done so many genetic things with themselves, including cloning, that there is something we humans have that they have lost? I think they need to create a new hybrid race, which is part them and part us that perhaps is going to help them regenerate their own race. But who knows? I don’t really have a definite answer. WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT IT WAS LESS THAN A YEAR AGO IN JULY 2007, THAT OVER YOUR HOME TOWN OF KELOWNA AND LAKE OKANAGAN, THERE WERE OTHER RESIDENTS WHO SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE A CONFLICT BETWEEN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS OF DIFFERENT SHAPES. WHAT SPECULATION DO YOU HAVE ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE GOING ON? Either they were two different kinds of ships and beings and they were actually having an aggressive interaction with each other? Or possibly, it could be like what happened to my son, Chris, in the Peachland area a few years ago when he woke up in the middle of the night and saw a ship, was taken by some beings, which looked like greys and had what he described as suction cups on the ends of their fingertips. D raw ing of grey being w ith suction cup fingertips by Chris Saebels in 1995 at age 10. As my son was outside being taken into a craft, he said when he looked up, he saw another craft. There is a drawing of this in my book. D rawing of two different craft by Chris Saebels in 1995 at age 10. He told his mom, Corina, that the aerial object in the upper right had “bad ones” in it. The foreground craft were the grey beings that had come for him before the “bad ones” showed up. Source: Page 94, The Collectors © 2007 by Corina Saebels. It was absolutely amazing what he told me and he was only about 10-years-old at the time."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"He said, ‘Mummy, these grey beings came for me first and the other ones (non-humans) were also coming for me. The grey ones were bad, but the other ones were even worse. But the other greys got to me first.” So, it was not just one race that we were dealing with. It was actually two races and maybe that is part of that aggressive interaction. Maybe they were here to pick up someone (last July)? DID CHRIS SAY WHY HE THOUGHT THE OTHER SPECIES WAS ‘BAD’? No, he did not have a feeling or knowledge about why the other ones were bad. He just said, ‘I have a feeling. I just know. I don’t know how, Mum, but I know these beings were very bad and had they gotten me first, I probably would not have been returned to you.’ That was his intuitive feeling. July 31, 2003: Conscious Night Encounter with Grey Entities FOR PEOPLE WHO MIGHT THINK THAT THE ABDUCTION SYNDROME IS NOT HAPPENING NOW, COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED IN 2003? I WENT WITH YOU ON MAY 14, ALONG WITH NICOLE AND JOAN PEARSON OF CANADIAN QUESTERS, TO A ROAD AT A LANDFILL IN KELOWNA SO WE COULD SEE WHERE YOU AND A FRIEND HAD A REMARKABLE EXPERIENCE. Yes, it was July 31, 2003, and my girlfriend’s daughter had come up from Vancouver to Kelowna to look at apartments and for a job. She was trying to move here. We were on the computer that night, about five minutes to midnight. It was the night before she was supposed to go back to Vancouver. Quite suddenly she said out of the blue, ‘Let’s go star gazing.’ But I said to her that I was really tired and that she was leaving early in the morning, so why not put it off? ‘Why don’t we do it next time you come up here?’ But she felt very strongly about it and said, ‘No, we’re going!’ So, it was midnight when we left my apartment and found ourselves going up into the Glenmore area, which is on the outskirts of town and close to a landfill. But I did not realize that at the time. I just knew there were not many lights out there while we were driving. However, the car traffic was quite heavy and I told her that I wanted to pull over to the side of the road, but because there was so much traffic we would not be able to do much stargazing. No sooner did I say that than suddenly there was no more traffic. The road went completely dead. That night, there was no moon and there were no street or house lights out there, so it was very, very black. There was nothing but a blanket of stars. So, then I pulled over to the right side of the road and we got out of the car right away. She had the binoculars and I had a million and a half candlelight to check for cougars and bears because I had heard over the news that there had been sightings of animals recently on the outskirts of Kelowna. I checked for animals and there was nothing. I turned off the light and she looked up to the sky and right away she said to me, ‘Oh, there are three stars up here in kind of a triangle shape. And they are moving around together, but erratically. Do satellites do that?’ I told her, ‘No, a satellite is usually one light and it goes kind of steady. Then she said, ‘Wait, it’s just changed!’ As she said that – the air was quite hot that night because it was July and very dry. But all of a sudden, the air turned quite cold and musky- smelling. All the coyotes everywhere were just howling like crazy! Then maybe within a few seconds, everything went dead quiet, the air changed and she said the stars had changed into what looked like a bright neon green colored ball or sphere. And then she said, ‘No, it’s an oval. Now it’s a sphere.’ And I asked, ‘What is it?!’ because I had been handling the light and didn’t know exactly where she was looking. She said, ‘Now, it’s staying a sphere. Just look up.’ By then, when I looked up, I could see the glowing light above the car, maybe 150 feet up. At that point, I knew it was not just an airplane or a helicopter. I had a strong feeling we were in trouble. Something was not right. So, I grabbed my million and a half candlelight to check the area around us. I just felt fear. When I turned the light on, it was aimed in front of the car about 40 to 45 feet away to the left side of the road where two bushes were side by side. And there we saw five sets of eyes. I quickly realized the eyes were much bigger than deer or animal eyes and that we were in trouble. I knew what was standing in front of"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"us. C orina Saebels pointing on May 14, 2008, at the two bushes across the road from the Kelowna landfill where she and her friend saw five grey beings with large, black eyes first standing and then moving across the road toward them. Image © 2008 by Linda Moulton Howe. So, one started coming towards me because my next recollection is the eyes being much closer to me. I was trying to get back into the car, but I couldn’t seem to move very well. It was like going through quick sand and going in slow motion. Finally, I tried to yell to my friend to get back in the car, but my voice was only a whisper. I don’t know if it was terror or what, but I definitely had a problem with my voice. I also felt such bad chest pains, I thought I was having a heart attack from the terror of having these things coming at us. Next thing I know, we’re both climbing into the car and I was trying to turn the car on and it would not start. It took about half a dozen clicks in the ignition before the car finally started. I did a quick U-turn across the road and we started back toward Kelowna as fast as I could go. But then, my friend yells at me to pull over, ‘Stop, stop, stop! You’ve got to stop!’ So, I pulled the car over to the side of the road and she said, ‘Something is wrong. We just got here.’ Looking at her watch, she said, ‘It’s after 1 AM.’ I said, ‘That’s ridiculous! We haven’t been here an hour.’ And we still can’t remember what happened after the eyes came toward us. YOU TWO HAVE AN HOUR OF MISSING TIME IN 2003 AFTER PHYSICAL INTERACTION WITH BEINGS THAT BOTH OF YOU SAW IN A STRANGE ALTERED STATE. BUT BY 2003, YOU HAD ALREADY HAD A COMPLETE HYSTERECTOMY AFTER YEARS OF FEMALE ORGAN PROBLEMS WHICH YOU THINK WERE THE RESULT OF FETUS EXTRACTIONS FROM YOU BY THE NON-HUMAN BEINGS? WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THOSE PARTICULAR GREY-COLORED BEINGS WOULD COME BACK INTO YOUR LIFE AT AGE 46 AFTER YOUR GYNECOLOGICAL ORGANS ARE GONE? WHAT DO YOU THINK IS HAPPENING WHEN THE BEINGS STAY IN YOUR LIFE AT THIS STAGE? One of the things that I was told by a doctor is that my daughter, Nicole, and I have a very rare blood type. Are the beings coming back for more blood? I’m not sure. [ Editor’s Note: Corina is RH Negative O. Nicole is RH Negative A.]"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" But even after my hysterectomy, I actually believe that these beings do not need a uterus. They just need us human females like an incubator. They have a way of implanting some fetuses inside us for the period that they need – usually 3 to 3.5 months and sometimes up to 4 months. Then the beings come and collect that fetus. I REMEMBER HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH JOHN ALTSHULER, M. D., HEMATOLOGIST AND PATHOLOGIST (NOW DECEASED) ABOUT WHETHER HUMAN DOCTORS COULD PROVE THAT A PERSON WAS A HUMAN AND E. T. HYBRID BY ANALYZING THE BLOOD TYPE. THE QUESTION AROSE BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE IN THE HUMAN ABDUCTION SYNDROME REPORTED BEING SHOWN OR TOLD THAT RH NEGATIVE BLOOD WAS PROOF OF SUCH HYBRIDIZATION. DR. ALTSHULER TOLD ME THAT IF RH NEGATIVE BLOOD WAS THE CONSEQUENCE OF AN E. T. AND HUMAN HYBRID, HUMAN DOCTORS HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING WHAT WOULD CONSTITUTE AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL INFLUENCE IN A FETUS. Missing Pregnancies and Hybrid Infants FOR YOU AND NICOLE, HOW MANY DOCUMENTED MISSING PREGNANCIES HAVE EACH OF YOU HAD? My 20-year-old daughter, Nicole, has had two missing pregnancies. For myself, one for sure that has been documented and possible three more when I was much younger when I had no concept of such a phenomenon linked to the extraterrestrial presence. In each case, I seemed to be pregnant for about 3.5 months and then suddenly, there would be no fetus. I do remember in two specific disappearing pregnancies, I did not even go to the hospital because I didn’t think the doctors would believe me at the time. BACK TO YOUR AGE FIVE, YOU MOVED FROM BELGIUM TO MONTREAL, CANADA. YOU PUT A DRAWING IN YOUR BOOK ABOUT YOUR FIRST INTERACTION WITH GREY BEINGS THEN. COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"I llustration of Corina at age 5 presented with weak-looking infant that she thinks was part human and part alien. Source: Page 22, The Collectors © 2007 by Corina Saebels. I remember one night that a bright, bluish-white light came through my bedroom window and a being came in my room. My next recollection is that I’m in a strange, circular room with subdued lighting, it was kind of dark. I had my nightie on and I was sitting on a very cold, metal table, which seemed to be hovering in the air. The table did not appear to have legs. In front of me was a very smooth, curved wall with a protruding ledge. The next thing I see on the ledge is a strange-looking fetus or infant. It had a large head, very skinny body, the ears were barely noticeable, a very small nose – only two nostrils in a tiny bump. There was a slit for a mouth and the eyes were not like the grey beings and not like our human eyes. The iris and pupil part were round like ours was surrounded by some white, but the whole pupil and iris were the same color. It was a light blue, but a blue I don’t know how to describe. The little infant seemed so lethargic to me that I had mixed emotions. It was so scary- looking to me as a child that I was afraid of it. But I got a sense that I was supposed to help it somehow. There were not any clothes on the infant. I did not see a sexual organ or anything. It was naked. It had no blanket. It was just lying there on the ledge, looking lethargic like it was going to die. I was terrified, but I wanted to help the child and the next thing I know, the baby is gone. And then there is a very tall, scary-looking being coming through the shadows. I had the sense that he was a doctor. But that’s all I remember. SOME ABDUCTEES THAT I’VE INTERVIEWED OVER THE YEARS HAVE SUGGESTED TWO THINGS: 1) THE NON-HUMAN BEINGS ARE LOOKING TO HUMANS TO HAVE COMPASSION FOR THE HYBRIDS – THAT THE ACT OF COMPASSION IS AN EMOTION THEY ARE MEASURING OR USING. 2) SOME ABDUCTEES HAVE SAID, ‘AS SCARY AS IT HAS BEEN, I HAVE FELT THAT I SHOULD FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEINGS THAT ARE HAVING TO DO THIS, AS IF THERE IS A SURVIVAL ISSUE THE GREY BEINGS HAVE AND THAT IS WHY THE ALIENS ARE FORCING AN ARTIFICIALLY ACCELERATED MERGING OF TWO SPECIES. AS I SAY THAT TO YOU, INTUITIVELY WHAT DO YOU FEEL IN 2008? Our own experiences (hers and children) have been very negative and painful. My children still have scars remaining on their bodies from the radiation burns, the cuts, the holes. So, for me, it is very difficult. I’m torn, to be very honest. But the hybrids – not the grey beings – that I’ve been shown are the ones I feel sorry for. WHY? Because they don’t really belong to their world or our world. There is the question: who are their parents? Us? Them? Who looks after the hybrid children? Who nurtures them? Those young hybrids don’t seem to have very much emotion. When a baby cries, your first instinct is to go and pick it up and pacify it, nurture it, do something. But these little hybrids just seem to be on their own. That feels sad to me."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"INTUITIVELY, IF YOU WERE SAYING NOW WHERE YOU THINK THE HYBRIDS ARE GOING TO BE PLACED TO LIVE AND TO WORK, WOULD IT BE HERE ON EARTH OR SOME PLACE ELSE? I’m not sure, but I think on an intuitive level, I believe they will be taken to some other place beyond Earth. I’m just guessing here. THAT WOULD MEAN THAT PERHAPS THE GENETIC HARVEST OF EARTH IS TO PERPETUATE LIFE SOMEWHERE ELSE.
