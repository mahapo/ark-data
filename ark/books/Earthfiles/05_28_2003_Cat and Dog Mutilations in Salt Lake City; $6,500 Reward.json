May 27, 2003 Salt Lake City, Utah - Since May 14, 2002, the Salt Lake County Animal Services in Utah has received nine reports of mutilated cats and one report of a mutilated dog. The May 14th case was a domestic male cat with black short hair. The officer who picked it up thought it might have been attacked by another animal, but the resident who found it thought its throat had been slit. Then on July 2, 2002, another domestic cat with short black and white hair was reported, sex unknown. Ray Kelleher, Staff Sergeant and Senior Officer, who has worked 25 years for the Salt Lake County Animal Services, talked to me about that case and the eight others since that have all been found in a six block radius \"in the Avenues\" of northeastern Salt Lake City. Ray Kelleher, Staff Sergeant and Senior Officer, Salt Lake County Animal Services, Salt Lake City, Utah: \"That July 2, 2002, cat appeared to be gutted, decapitated and it looked to be cut open from the side and the head and internal organs were missing. That's what we've been finding - either we find the back half or the front half and the organs are missing, cleaned out. No blood or anything around, so we are suspecting that the perpetrators are dropping the cats or catching them somehow and taking them somewhere and doing their thing with them. Then taking the half they don't need or want back to the Avenues where and dropping it back off in the same location. Salt Lake City, Utah Animal Mutilation Cases Reported Between July 2, 2002 and May 22, 2003: 1) May 14, 2002, cat. 2) July 2, 2002, cat. 3) July 17, 2002, cat.

TO DATE, HAS ANYONE SEEN OR HEARD ANYTHING UNUSUAL? No. Out of the ten, we've only been able to identify three owners. They came and positively identified what they could of theirs. We've talked with them and asked if they've had any problems with neighbors, if anyone has threatened to kill their cats or have they had any juvenile kids around, any suspicious vehicles parked in front of their house or slowing down in front of their house or anything like that? Each one has said no. It's been really a quiet neighborhood and they've never had any problems with juveniles and haven't even seen anything suspicious in their neighborhood. THOSE THREE OWNERS OF THOSE THREE CATS, WERE THOSE CATS KEPT IN THE HOUSE AND LET OUT? OR WERE THEY OUTDOOR CATS? They would let them out at night and that's when the attacks seemed to occur, in the middle of the nights. We would end up getting a call in the morning about 6 or 7 a.m., when people would find the cat. It wouldn't be at the same house, but would be a couple of blocks from their house. It would be left on someone else's lawn. So, it's being done sometime after midnight or so when the perpetrators assume everyone is asleep and no one is out looking. IN ALL TEN ANIMALS, IT'S BEEN A BLOODLESS SCENE? Yes. And they were all within probably a five to six block radius of each other (in the Avenues). DID YOU PUT CRUISERS OR PEOPLE OUT TO LOOK THERE? Yes, we do have mobile neighborhood watch that is patrolling now at night and if they see anything suspicious or strange people they don't recognize in that neighborhood. The patrols will be calling the police on them. The police will check them out and see what they are doing up there. HAVE YOU HAD A REWARD? We do. It's $6,500 through the Human Society. Anyone with information can contact me at my phone number: 801-269-7497, Ex. 470. Aurora, Colorado has also had similar half cats and other animals and have a $9,000 reward out. (See More Information below.) IN THE TWENTY-FIVE YEARS THAT YOU HAVE WORKED FOR THE SALT LAKE COUNTY ANIMAL SERVICES, HOW MANY TIMES BEFORE HAVE THESE KINDS OF CAT AND DOG MUTILATIONS OCCURRED? None. They just started happening last year. We've never had any cases like this happening at all before. WHEN YOU'VE LOOKED AT THEM, WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND? Sick, perverted people. It's either some young kids, maybe high school age, possibly doing this. They might be dabbling into the occult a little bit, maybe even someone who doesn't care for cats and doing this. Because it's like they put it back out in the same area they catch the cats, like saying, 'Look at what I did.'"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"BUT WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS SAME EXACT PATTERN HAS BEEN GOING ON WORLDWIDE FOR DECADES, REPORTED IN THE NEW YORK TIMES AND MANY NEWSPAPERS FROM LONDON, ENGLAND THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES? Well, that's interesting. We've been looking at e-mails to see if there is a correlation with something on the internet that tells people, advises people, how to do these things. BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE AN INTERNET IN THE 1960S, 1970S OR THE EARLY 1980S. That's true. I don't know if it's some kind of big collaboration in the cults that is nationwide. That's a possibility. Because mostly the more pronounced cults usually don't leave any type of body or carcass for anyone to see. They dispose of everything they don't use because they don't want to be known. WHAT ABOUT UFOS? I don't know. That could be a possibility. I believe in those, actually, and that could be a possibility. DEPUTY SHERIFFS AND SHERIFFS WHO HAVE WORKED ON THE CATTLE MUTILATION CASES HAVE SEEN BEAMS OF LIGHT COME DOWN IN PASTURES, THEY'VE SEEN STRANGE GLOWING DISCS IN THE SKY. IT CERTAINLY MAKES ME WONDER ABOUT THE LINK? That's true. I'm open for any leads, for any information on this. I'm not closing my mind on any possibilities.\" More Information: Salt Lake City Animal Mutilations To report information and inquire about Humane Society's $6,500 reward for arrest and conviction of any perpetrators, call: Ray Kelleher, Staff Sergeant Salt Lake County Animal Services Salt Lake City, Utah 801-269-7497, Ex. 470 Aurora, Colorado Animal Mutilations Nine cats, two squirrels and one rabbit have been found the past year with bloodless, precise cuts and usually only the front half or back half of the animal.
