Interview (cont): Don Ledger, Retired Civil Servant Sound Engin eer and TV Producer-Director, Province of Nova Scotia (employed 34 years); and author Maritime UFO Files © 1998, Swissair Down (Flt. 111) © 2000; Dark Object (Shag Harbour) © 2001: Canadian and American Military Investigation for Seven Days THESE EVENTS OCCURRED BEGINNING 11:20 P.M. OCTOBER 4, AND CONTINUED PAST MIDNIGHT INTO OCTOBER 5 FOR HOW LONG? The whole event took place over a period of seven days. I think it was two objects, not just one, which went into the water and made their way out of the sound next to the harbor and traveled northeast up the coast and settled on the bottom off the mouth of Shelburne Harbor. WHEN YOU SAY THAT, YOU ARE IMPLYING THAT THESE WERE OBJECTS THAT WERE INTELLIGENTLY CONTROLLED AND FOR WHATEVER REASONS DID NOT WANT TO BE OBVIOUS AND WERE USING THE WATER TO HIDE? Yes. They made their way up the coast off the mouth of Shelburne Harbor off an island there that is called McNutt's Island. On that island, there is a lighthouse called Cape Roseway Light. Just to the left of that coming back on the extreme left of that island coming ashore again you end up on a point called Government Point, the site for Canadian Forces Station (CFS) Sheburne about six miles from the town of Shelburne at the mouth of Shelburne Harbour. It's been called Government Point for many years because there has always been a military installation there. It's thought to be a Canadian and American oceanographic study station to study the North Atlantic. Government Point was "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"IS GOVERNMENT POINT ON McNUTT'S ISLAND? No, Government Point is back on the mainland. You have to imagine the island being a plug in the mouth of the harbor. It's a long inlet. If you were facing out of the harbor, if you were going out on the left hand side between McNutt's Island and the point, there is a government installation there. At least there was. Right now, it's no longer there. HOW FAR IS McNUTT'S ISLAND AND GOVERNMENT POINT FROM SHAG HARBOUR? They are about 23 miles up the coast northeast from Shag Harbour. SO WHAT HAPPENED AT McNUTT'S ISLAND AND GOVERNMENT POINT? We don't have documentation. All we have is anecdotal evidence of the event through military sources. There are six or seven who have come forward so far to talk to us about this. What apparently happened is that these two objects came up and settled on the bottom in about 80 feet of water on the magnetic detection grid off of Government Point, which was thought to be some kind of mundane government oceanographic study installation. But it turned out to be a undersea sonar monitoring base for the U. S. Navy. SUSA was the underwater listening microphone system set up in the North Atlantic. It was TOP SECRET for years and did not become public knowledge in Nova Scotia until about 1988. It was only in 1967 that any Canadian military were even involved in the work at the Government Point base. For the most part, we were just ancillary - guarding, doing the cleanups and cooking the food. But eventually, the Canadians ended up sharing the operation of the base up to about 1994, after which it was closed. WHAT YOU MEAN IS THAT THE AMERICANS WERE DOMINATING GOVERNMENT POINT IN NOVA SCOTIA? They were. They owned it at that point. They bought it and got rights to use it starting back around 1949. SO, THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT BOUGHT AND CONTROLLED GOVERNMENT POINT? They brought the cables in from the North Atlantic. They had microphones salted all the way over from Russia and Greenland and down around Labrador, right down the coast into Government Point and then down as far as the New England area. They could pick up the propeller noises and hull noises of ships passing through the water. They could triangulate by using the microphones. SO THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT WAS VERY AWARE OF ANY SOUND, ANY VIBRATION, THAT WAS OCCURRING UNDERNEATH THE WATER AT GOVERNMENT POINT AND BEYOND? Oh, for sure! HAVE YOU EVER HAD ANYBODY TELL YOU, ON OR OFF THE RECORD, ABOUT WHAT THEY HEARD FROM GOVERNMENT POINT THE NIGHT ALL OF THIS WAS OCCURRING WITH THESE OBJECTS UNDER WATER? Never. Never got anybody to talk about that. Don't forget, this was still a really well kept secret up to 1988 and the base continued to run full blast until 1994. The reason for it closing out was because in 1994, Johnny Walker the spy in the United States was caught and it was discovered that for seventeen years he had been feeding information about this particular base and other bases like it to the Soviets. So, they knew what was going on. But by 1994, it was a mute point because the Berlin Wall was already down. Russians Tricked American Underwater Listening Network The Russians were able to use the American underwater microphone system for over seventeen years to their advantage by simulating hull signatures. It's almost funny! The American Naval authorities for many years thought the Russians had four times more nuclear submarines than the American fleet and it was a big concern to them. It turned out the two countries had about the same number of submarines, but the Russians were faking"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"new hull signatures every time they came up because they knew the Americans were listening to them (from Government Point). THE SOVIETS WERE MAKING IT SOUND LIKE THEY HAD MORE SUBMARINES THAN THEY DID? Yes. They would have a submarine out on a mission that the Americans already knew about. They were able to record the hull sounds. They would get them and computerize them and they could get a signature on them and apply a code name for it. I talked to a guy one time who had worked on this years before I got involved in UFOs and did not even realize I knew what I knew until the Shag Harbour incident came along. Then it came back into my head again. But the Russian submarines would go back to port, they would put the thing up in dry dock, maybe change the prop and put a little bit different pitch on it, weld something on the hull to change the sound of the hull going through the water, maybe even put a squeaky ball bearings into it and then put it back to sea again. It would be heard (by the Americans) and they would think, 'Aha, another one!' OUR GOVERNMENT WOULD ASSUME IT WAS YET A DIFFERENT SUBMARINE. Exactly. And they assigned it another code name. Once the Americans found out about the Russians knew all about it, their cover was blown. But it still did not blow the value of knowing that when something was moving around the ocean the magnetic anomaly detection grid was a little more refined than that. It was not as widespread. It did not go way up in the North Atlantic. It just covered along the Continental Shelf from about Labrador down into New England. What it did is that it was laid out in a grid underwater. When a vessel, a hull, passed over the top of it, it would make an anomaly in the grid. In other words, it would show up as a magnetic source in the grid. All it had to be was some kind of metal hull - even the engine block would do it. AFTER OCTOBER 4, 1967, WERE ANY MAGNETIC ANOMALIES PICKED UP FROM THE OBJECTS HIDING UNDER THE WATER NEAR GOVERNMENT POINT? No, I can't claim that. Maybe they did. I don't know for sure. We never were able to discover that. But military investigators were sitting right on top of the underwater objects. And don't forget, back in 1967, we only had a 12 mile protection limit, even for the military in those days. There was no 200 mile limit like we have today. IF THEY DID NOT PICK UP A MAGNETIC ANOMALY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM, HOW DID ANYONE KNOW THAT THE TWO OBJECTS WERE UNDERWATER OFF OF GOVERNMENT POINT? Apparently, they did. I'm not saying they did not. I'm just saying we have no proof that they did. I'm pretty sure they did pick up magnetic anomalies. I would be very surprised if they did not. But our information comes from people who were in the area at the time and were in on the operation, which is what I'll be talking about at the crash retrieval conference in Las Vegas. Unidentified Aerial Objects Tracked from Siberia Over Arctic to Shag Harbour In fact, they gave us some of the details we did not know before about the original object/s coming in from over Siberia into North American airspace and scaring the hell out of everybody. SO THESE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS ORIGINATED FROM SIBERIA BEFORE THEY CAME DOWN IN SHAG HARBOUR AND THEN WENT UP THE COAST INTO GOVERNMENT POINT? Two of the military personnel who told us about this told us that the objects made a half orbit and came in over Siberia and then came across the Arctic Circle and down into Canadian airspace. \"Things Not From This World\" Underwater WHAT DID PEOPLE SAY THEY KNEW WAS OCCURRING OFF OF GOVERNMENT POINT? To narrow it right down, there were two objects on the bottom in 80 feet of water. There were seven government vessels, at least seven, parked over these things for about seven"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"days while they could get government assets into the area. They observed the objects using divers. 80 feet of water - that's not very deep, not for diving. Pictures were taken and observations were made. At one point, whether suspicious or not, there was apparently a Soviet submarine that was testing the 12 mile limit and made a run at the post. Several of our vessels departed to give chase or defend, and these \"things\" under the water then started to move. They moved back down again to the Shag Harbour area. THE TWO UNIDENTIFIEDS UNDER THE WATER MOVED FROM GOVERNMENT POINT BACK TO SHAG HARBOUR? Ye s . COULD PEOPLE SEE LIGHTS MOVING UNDER THE WATER? Nobody mentioned anything about moving lights under the water, no. ONLY THROUGH MAGNETIC ANOMALIES DID THEY KNOW THAT THESE THINGS WERE MOVING? I'm assuming that (government investigators) knew that, but I don't know for sure because there is no documentation on it. We cannot nail it down definitely, but the people who are involved and we have no reason to disbelieve them say that this happened. HOW DID PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE DESCRIBING, PHOTOGRAPHING THESE OBJECTS 80 FEET DOWN UNDERWATER WHAT DID THEY SAY WAS PHOTOGRAPHED? 'Things.' That's as far as they would go. It turned out the divers were from Canadian Forces Base Shelburne who were keeping an eye on these underwater things. Of those five divers, two have since passed away from cancer. There are three left. One lives up in Cornwallis, Ontario. He won't talk about it. Apparently he was the photographer. The other fellow works in this area here (Halifax, Nova Scotia). He is an older retired diver and refuses to talk about it. The third guy did talk about it and then shut up after apparently somebody talked to him. WHAT DID HE SAY? He said they were camped over these things for seven days and keeping an eye on them. They were diving on them and watching them and they were being told to keep their mouths shut about what they were seeing and were not even allowed to talk about it among themselves. Some arguments occurred on the support vessel. This is a bit strange, too. This was not just Canadian Navy involved here. Apparently, the American Navy was concerned or at least officers from the American Navy. In one particular episode, the diver described where he was reamed out by an American officer on a Canadian ship which he thought was kind of unusual, but apparently that happened back then with the NATO thing. DID ANY OF THESE PEOPLE DESCRIBE WHAT THE OBJECTS LOOKED LIKE AND IF THERE WERE ANY ENTITIES? Oval shaped object, what you would describe as your usual UFO oval shaped objects about 60 feet in diameter, two of them on the bottom. One appeared to be giving assistance to the other. That's how they interpreted it. They weren't sure if that was the exact truth of it. But it seemed to them that one was helping the other one. Then eventually, two of the vessels moved up because they were sitting right over the top of the objects. Somehow that prevented the underwater objects from moving away, but eventually they did move off the bottom, kept going underwater and headed back the same way they came. Then we have a report from later that evening almost within 1/2 mile of the Shag Harbour incident where two objects climbed out of the water and climbed out over the Gulf of Maine and disappeared down toward the United States. Two of them came out of the water at Woods Harbor. SO THAT WAS 7 DAYS AFTER OCTOBER 4, 1967. Yes, on October 11. ON OCTOBER 11, EYEWITNESSES SAW TWO OF THESE OBJECTS COME OUT OF THE WATER AT SHAG HARBOUR JUST LIKE THEY HAD GONE INTO THE WATER ON THE NIGHT OF OCTOBER 4? Only half a mile from where the original sighting took place. DID ANYBODY TELL YOU THAT THEY HAD SEEN ON PHOTOGRAPHS OR ANY"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"OTHER WAY ANY KIND OF ENTITIES UNDER THE WATER ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ROUND OR OVAL-SHAPED CRAFT? No photographs. But there were anecdotal the divers say they saw 'things' down there. That's as far as they would go with what the shapes not only the objects, but there were 'things' working on it. The original cover story was that the government forces were sitting over a Soviet submarine. They were told even the divers were told that this was what it was a Soviet submarine. This is what you're telling everybody this is what it's going to be. THAT WAS THE COVER STORY. Yes, and an argument ensued in the mess galley while some of the divers were eating supper one night. It was an argument between an American officer and this particular diver about what these 'things' were. The language was kind of strong so I can't repeat it over radio. But the diver who was a bit of a feisty character the one who actually told the story and showed a great deal of bravado in telling the story eventually he did not back pedal on the story, but would keep his mouth shut. He would not retract it, but he would not talk about it any more either. He said some people talked to him and they told him not to talk about it anymore, so he would not. We had a lot of interference like that while we were doing this and we still have it happen. IF HE WAS FEISTY, DID HE DESCRIBE WHAT THE 'THINGS' WERE? He did not describe what they looked like. He just said there were 'things,' and they were not from this world. There were 'things' working on it and they weren't from this world that's the best I can give you (from him). Government Cover-Up of Shag Harbour and Government Point Events HAS ANYONE GIVEN YOU ANY DOCUMENTS OFFICIALLY OR NOT THAT DESCRIBES THESE EVENTS AS WE'VE JUST DISCUSSED? No, that part of the Shag Harbour incident is not documented. The first part of it is documented up the ying yang in Shag Harbour, up until the end of the dive is over with. Then there is some more anecdotal evidence about what happened around that time with local fishermen. Other odd occurrences such as three submarines parked off the coast sitting out there, which could not have been ours. We only had one at that time and it had just returned from England. THAT WAS THE COVER STORY THAT THIS WAS A SOVIET SUB OUT THERE. This is at Government Point. But I'm talking about down in Shag Harbour 3 submarines just sitting on the surface. The fishermen saw them out there, maybe 3 or 4 miles just sitting there. YOU MEAN SAW REAL SUBMARINES? Yeah, they saw them out there. The fishermen wondered why the 3 American submarines would be sitting off Shag Harbour? What were they doing there? Clearly there were security concerns. We are convinced that NORAD must have been aware of something coming into our air space, particularly since this thing came over Siberia. They scrambled jets up in North Bay, Ontario, on these things and they scrambled them up at Goose Bay in Labrador to intercept. That's a serious thing to do because North Bay is far enough north as it is right now in Ontario and so is Goose Bay in Labrador even further north. When you scramble a jet which in this particular day would have been a F-104, a Star Fighter or something when you scramble a jet and pilot out there, you aren't going to see either one of them back if they are going to intercept with something half way to the Arctic Circle because there is no way they can get back. They didn't have the fuel for it. It was going to be a cold, lonely death up north somewhere. So they scrambled north and then they were recalled when this thing or these things, came tearing in the military sources we have say these things were coming in around 7700 miles per hour, which originally were thought by NORAD to be an ICBM coming in. All the bells and whistles would go off at NORAD when they saw this thing coming, right? Then all of a sudden, it just stopped and hovered up over Elsmere Island and then it started coming back down again. But this time, it's only moving 4400 mph. Then someone recalled their jets.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"On May 18, 2001, the Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia Post Office inaugurated a cancellation stamp depicting the October 4-11, 1967 event.
