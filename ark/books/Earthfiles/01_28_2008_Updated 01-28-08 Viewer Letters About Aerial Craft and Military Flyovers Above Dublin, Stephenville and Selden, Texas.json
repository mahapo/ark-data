In nature, this field is unobserved because the ions are randomly arranged, thus causing their tiny gravito-electric fields to cancel out one another. In a Bose-Einstein condensate, where all ions behave as one, something very different occurs. Spinning ions - that' s what my email below is about (see red text). I think I can explain what those cone-shaped holes and mirage heat waves are, but first let tell you a little about myself. I'm 30 now. When I was about 18, I saw a strange light in the sky that looked like a red ball of light. As I was looking, it shot out of sight in the blink of an eye. The first question I asked myself was not \"What was that?\" I asked, \"How?\" Sense then in my spare time, I've researched the how question. Without getting too technical, I came to conclusion that an electromagnetic field can cause an antigravity effect IF the fields are shaped properly. There are actually two fields that need to be shaped properly. The electrical field and the magnetic field. The electrical field has to be shaped like a tornado or a vortex. The magnetic field has to be shaped like a donut. If you can make a device that can create the electrical vortex, then the electrical field will cause the magnetic field to take the d onut shape. The same is true the other way around. If you had a device that can make a donut-shaped magnetic field, it will build the electrical field in a vortex shape. These shaped fields cancels gravity. Another thing to mention that might explain what Ricky Sorrells saw. It's known for a fact that gravity bends lights. It's part of the theory of relativity that gravity can slow down time and cause mass to change. These are relativity facts. Now, we can explain Ricky's drawing. Each cone-shaped indention is a device that creates an electrical vortex (sometime called a plasma or ion vortex), and like a tornado with multiple vortexes, they all the add up to cause one big vortex around the craft. That big vortex causes a large donut-shaped field around the craft. Within this donut shaped magnetic field, magnetic flux lines are created in a little different shape than normal matter. Flux line are the force lines in magnetic fields. You can see these flux lines if you sprinkle metal shaving over a piece of paper with a magnet under it. Flux lines are always curved, except in the center of a donut-shaped field. Now, a craft using fields as described are subject to some side effects. Because atoms vibrate differently depending on gravity, a craft with a cancelling-gravity- effect will cause atoms to vibrate faster and make time seem faster (within the center). Or if you're on the edge of donut- shaped field like this, you'll be in a place were gravity is a little stronger then normal and time would seem slower. So think that if you walked up to a running craft, as you get closer to the magnetic field your watch would slow down. Once you entered the field and started to walk toward the center, your watch will start speeding up again until you get to the center. At that point, your watch will be running much faster then someone else's watch on the outside of the field. With time dilation comes length contraction. This explains why people see various craft as"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"different sizes. The eyewitnesses are really seeing the craft's field changing and its time dilation factor changing. As far as different lights around the craft - the color, size, and shape of the lights will depend on where you are in relationship to the craft, time of day, strength of field, and condition in the environment. Ionized air normally produces a blue hue like lightening. This is because most of the light emitted by ionized air is UV light, but some radiation is also in the visible spectrum. Water vapor in the air will split the UV light and other light into different colors. Kind of like how water vapor splits white light into a rainbow. The field will be more visible at night and might be drowned out completely during the day and the sun's light. Also, if you could see the fields around the craft, it would be like looking through a wavy pool of water. Light bends in water. If you look at something like a vent at the bottom of swimming pools, you see that it not clear, but seems to dance around. Same thing with light coming off a craft such as this, but a little bit more intense. Subject: Stephenville UFO Date: January 23, 2008 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com I'm sure my info will be of little help, but I will add to your mountain of emails. I live on the SW side of Benbrook Lake which is SW of Fort Worth. This also happens to be south of the Lockhead Martin / Joint Reserve base on Lake Worth. I am in the direct flight path of the F-16's and C-130's (or are they C-140's?) that fly in and out every day, and I work from home so I am here most of the time and pretty much know the basic routines. Although these guys don't have an exact schedule, I can tell when something is up by the way they fly out of the base. On the afternoon of 9/11 when there was no air traffic and the skies were calm, there were at least 3 jets that “screamed” out of the base flying over my house. I couldn't see the afterburners, but they were in an extreme hurry flying very low and very fast. Normally it seems they take a higher altitude when doing routine flights in and out. Anyway, the reason for the observation is this: On Tuesday, Jan.15, 2008, a friend of mine was stopping by so I was outside waiting for her. At about 6:45 or 7pm (after sunset), I counted 5 jets (F-16's? couldn't see them, only their lights) fly directly over my house heading SW very low and very fast. It reminded me of 9/11. These guys were definitely on a mission. I was very surprised because it is very unusual for them to take off like that after dark. I called my sister who lives 1/2 mile west of the base and she said she heard them, too, and that they also did the same thing on the previous Sunday Jan. 13, 2008. I was not home that night, so I missed it. At the time, I was unaware of any (UFO) sightings. I don't know if these dates will help with your investigation or not, but I hope so. January 22, 2008 Fort Worth, Dublin, Stephenville and Selden, Texas - The first week of January 2008, came with shocks for at least three dozen people living in Dublin, Stephenville and Selden, Texas, southwest of Fort Worth. The shocks ranged from yellow, red, blue and white lights that showed up after sunset – lights so bright that eyewitnesses compared them to a welder’s torch. There were also three daylight sightings by metal welder and machinist, Ricky Sorrells, within the first week and a half of 2008. His closest sighting about 300 feet above the woods on his property was of an aerial craft “at least three football field long (about 1,000 feet).” See: 011808 Earthfiles. 1) Subject: Air Force Jets Date: January 19, 2008 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com Linda, On Tuesday January 1, 2008, above Fort Worth, about 09:00 AM to 12:00 PM, we had some crazy flyovers of F-18s, B1s, B2s, F-22s, and the new raptor jet. Flying very much like a search pattern for something on the ground or in the air. Just East of I-35W and North to South of I-20/820 East. It got my attention while I was on the computer checking on my emails for the day, when these jets flew so close that I could look up and see the outline of the wheel wells, about 700 feet off the ground. Next door neighbor also noticed the flight pattern and came out to talk about what might be going on at this time. Being a security officer at one time in my life came in handy about distance and type of equipment, whatever it might be!

I am a graphic designer and a visual designer. For 9 years I have studied human perception; therefore, I am a very visual person. YES! It is true that big unimaginable super size UFOs exist. In 1998, I saw an enormous"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"mother-ship over the city of Pereira, Colombia. I was in a bus coming from Cartago, a small town in the South. The bus driver did stop the car on the top of a mountain. It is possible to see the city of Pereira at the bottom of the mountains. The time was 11 PM or 12 midnight. The bus driver was in trouble by what he was seeing, so he made all the occupants of the bus - 10 or more people - get out the bus and confirm for him what he was seeing: an enormous ship that covered the majority of the city. It was static over Pereira, Colombia, without a sound with green, orange, red, and yellow lights. It was not a product of the bus driver's imagination. It was not the first time I did see a UFO. When I was a young child, my father took me hiking over the Andes mountains and we saw so many UFOs, 3 at once, so close that we could touch them if we wanted to, but we were so disconcerted by the flying discs that we could not react. They came so close like they were observing us as we were a curiosity. Going back to the 1/2-mile-long ship. I did find other person who saw the same mother-ship over the city of Pereira, but in another date. This person wrote a report on http://www.nuforc.org /webreports/005/S05700.html . Thank you for caring about Mother earth and the environment. I do appreciate your work and intelligence. My best thoughts are with you. 3) Subject: Texas Jets Could Be Clue Date: January 19, 2008 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com If the witness was sure of I.D. of jet fighters being F-16 or F-15, they are Air Force fighters and mostly didn't come from Navy air base - unless it was secret special Air Force temporary deploy to Naval air base to observe UFOs. If Air Force F-16 didn't come from Navy air base, this mean government has been tracking and chasing UFOs from a far distant base. Navy fighters are F-18 and F-14. This could aid in tracking the base these fighters came from. I believe it is a top secret air unit to chase and observe UFOs, not regular Air Force or Navy, which both can say they have no planes in the air. 4) Subject: UFO over Aledo, Texas Date: January 19, 2008 2:01:01 AM MST To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com My (January 1, or 2, 2008) sighting was something I’d never seen before. I live in a little town called Annetta. Our address is Aledo, Texas, probably because that’s where the post office is and it is about 3 miles or more away. We are about 10 miles east of Weatherford and 25 miles from downtown Fort Worth. I was outside of our house looking west toward Weatherford. Directly behind our house are acres of ranch land. It was about 7 PM and a light caught my attention. I looked up thru a hazy winter night sky to see a bright light about the size of a quarter at arm’s length. It was moving west toward Stephenville. It was too fast for a balloon. It was completely silent, had no flashing red light like an aircraft has and it didn’t break up or go out like a flare or fireworks do. It suddenly shot out of sight over the horizon as it got close to the tree line from my line of sight and was gone in a hurry. It didn’t disappear as a firework would, but traveled away over the horizon and was gone. It didn’t fit a flare, aircraft, helicopter, fireworks or comet because of the silence, speed and change of direction of flight. This occurred on the night of about January 1st or 2nd. That is my story. Maybe not very dramatic compared to other experiences but it was a little unnerving to me and scary. I didn’t see a ship or anything but the light. 5) Subject: Texas Sighting Date: January 19, 2008 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com Thanks for the report on the sighting in Texas by Mr. Sorrells. Truly amazing. It seems to me from his description, that he is detailing an image of a giant “ flat screen” display or a projection device. I would equate the circle in a circle (reminiscent of Ezekiel), with a conical lens residing in the larger depression becoming something akin to a pixel. With the “ pixels” being distributed equally over the flat surface to form a viewing or projection surface. Of course, the neutral flat gray of the ship would provide the perfect background color, similar to an aluminum gray projection screen. And judging from the estimated size of the craft - “three football fields” estimated by Ricky Sorrells - or a mile by a half a mile estimated by the pilot's sighting (close to our present day 16:9 display format), and the distance of 40 feet between the circles on the grid, the intended view would be from thousands of feet. The lights described in the night sightings and the basic geometric figures being shown would seem to indicate someone looking for ground reports on their light “ convergence” test. Similar to adjusting your TV and asking someone across the room, “How is it now?”"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"If terrestrial, I would believe our government would never risk exposure of such a technology unless it was about to be used. What would be its use? I would guess for communications with a populous “off the grid” from some catastrophic event, which negated conventional communications. If extraterrestrial, I would think the sighting could be used for attuning the population to some soon-to-occur event, such as a first contact. It would make sense that a first contact would be by a visual display that could not be government-controlled or censored. This could give us physical characteristics of the species, views of a home planet, a history, and of course, INTENTIONS. All this acclimation, without actual physical interaction, and the possibility of a negative response from the militaries of the world. Of course, the other side of the equation, a device so large it could display an illusion event over an entire city. Frankly, I have no idea and am just responding with my personal interpretations. However, I would say this, if these sightings are true and correct, whatever the purpose of this machine, whether for help or hurt, things don't appear to bode well for our immediate future. 6) Subject: Texas Sightings from Mesa, Arizona, Resident Date: January 22, 2008 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com My boyfriend has finally convinced me to write to you about my experience with the UFO seen around the 8th of Jan, after listening to you on Coast to Coast. I listened and read your interview with Ricky Sorrells. I am still not sure what I saw; I will do my best to describe it. It was probably about 9:30 PM and I was out in my backyard just looking around. We own 2 telescopes so we spend a lot of time looking up. At first, when I saw the blinking red light, I thought it was an airplane (it was high up in the sky and had a blinking red light). But after watching it for a few minutes, I realized it was not an airplane. Then thought maybe a satellite. But it didn't fly in a straight line. And then the light turned white and was blinking, then strobing, then it would stop. It continually changed between red and white and was erratic. It would blink fast, then slow, sometimes it would stay solid. And it did not fly in a straight pattern. There were times when the lights would stop and when they started again, it was in a different position, but not in the spot you would think it would be. It moved diagonally, then straight. It would stop for a few seconds, then move really fast a short distance. I watched this object for about 10 mins, thinking this was the craziest thing I have ever seen. I had told my boyfriend about it, but didn't think too much of it until I read about others seeing it online. Then he had me listen to Coast to Coast and go to your Earthfiles.com website to read about what had been seen. All I know is what I saw was something I have never seen before. T his week, on Wednesday, January 16, Ricky called me to say there had been more low-flying jet and helicopter traffic over his Dublin property. While he was talking, another jet flew over so loud and so low that he stopped talking on his cell phone. Maj. Karl Lewis, a spokesman for the 301st Fighter Wing at the Joint Reserve Base Naval Air Station in Fort Worth, told Reporter Angela Brown at the Stephenville Empire-Tribune that “no F-16s or other aircraft from his base were in the area the night of January 8, 2008, when most people reported the light sightings.” Partial List of Military Bases in Fort Worth, Texas, Region Brooks AFB, San Antonio, Texas Dyess AFB, Abilene, Texas Fort Bliss, Fort Bliss, Texas Fort Hood, Killeen, Texas Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, Texas Goodfellow AFB, San Angelo, Texas Kelly AFB, San Antonio, Texas Lackland AFB, San Antonio, Texas Laughlin AFB, Del Rio, Texas Naval Air Station (NAS), Corpus Christi, Corpus Christi, Texas Naval Air Station, Joint Reserve Base (NAS JRB) Fort Worth, Texas Naval Air Station, Kingsville, Texas Naval Station Ingleside, Ingleside, Texas Randolph AFB, San Antonio, Texas Red River Army Depot, Texarkana Sheppard AFB, Wichita Falls, Texas F or other related Earthfiles reports, please see: • 02/14/2008 — More Aerial “Symbols” Photographed Over Dublin, Texas"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"• 02/06/2008 — Updated 02-14-08: Mysterious Symbols Projected in Night Sky by Aerial Disc Near Stephenville, Texas, Local Airport • 02/08/2008 — Law Officers Describe Unidentified Shape-Shifting Aerial Craft in Stephenville, Texas, Region • 02/05/2008 — Three Eyewitnesses in Selden, Texas, Saw Two, Large Rectangles of “White Flames” in Sky • 01/28/2008 — Updated 01-28-08: Viewer Letters About Aerial Craft and Military Flyovers Above Dublin, Stephenville and Selden, Texas • 01/18/2008 — Updated with graphic: Huge Aerial Craft Over Dublin, Texas, “Longer Than 3 Football Fields” More Information: F or further reports about unidentified aerial objects, please see my documentaries, A Strange Harvest and Strange Harvests 1993 ; also my books An Alien Harvest ; Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles ; and 2-Volume Glimpses of Other Realities in the Earthfiles Shop.
