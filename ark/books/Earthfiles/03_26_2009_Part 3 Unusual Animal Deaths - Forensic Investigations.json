My research is included in large color photographs and documents in my first two books, An Alien Harvest © 1989 and Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. 1 © 1993. See Earthfiles Shop. The pressure of forensic facts has added up to compelling physical evidence that mutilation excisions are cut with high heat. Physical investigations have also confirmed that internal organs - including large bovine hearts - have been removed without external excisions on the animal bodies; that the specific cutting instrument is still not identified because there is no carbon residue at the mutilator's excisions. Earth life is carbon-based. If the cutting instruments were typical lasers used in animal and human surgeries, there would be black carbon grains visible at the excision sites under a microscope. However, when examined microscopically, many mutilation excisions do not have carbon particles, even when pathology analysis has confirmed cooked hemoglobin and collagen that indicate the tissue was removed from the mutilated animals with a technology that generated enough heat to cauterize. Would modern acoustical scalpels cauterize without leaving carbon residue? That is a question that needs to be researched. By 1994, I also began collecting soil and plants from mutilation sites for biophysicist W. C. Levengood to analyze. He has published some of his research in the international botany journal, Physiologia Plantarum, including his hypothesis that the plants and soil are affected as if a plasma energy containing microwave frequencies interacted with plant cell respiration. Another significant forensic discovery was in January 1997 when field researcher Jean Bilodeaux from Oregon joined us to investigate a dead and mutilated bull in Red Bluff, California. [ See 3-part 101500Earthfiles ] Jean found hardened, dark particles on a mutilated bull's testicles and chest that proved to be pure bovine hemoglobin. Significantly, four years later, we found pure bovine hemoglobin particles on two more mutilated cattle. They were 2001 cases in Alabama and Canada. Pure hemoglobin can only be produced by two centrifuge processes in laboratories, not in remote pastures.

Three Cattle Mutilations In Southern Colorado Since March 8, 2009 Now, there have been three cattle mutilations in southern Colorado since March 8, 2009. One Colorado Springs resident has been to all three with equipment he has learned to use as a reserve deputy sheriff for the El Paso County Sheriff's Office. Chuck Zukowski also owns his own company, Zukowski, Inc., and works full time designing microchips as an IC mask design engineer. Since 2007, he has also contributed his technical knowledge to field research for the Mutual UFO Network."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"C huck Zukowski holding his Geiger counter over the rear of the mutilated 28-year-old cow discovered on a creek bank of the Mike Duran ranch in Weston, Colorado, discovered on March 8, 2009, and visited by Chuck on Saturday, March 14, 2009.

(integrated circuit mask design engineer); Certified MUFON Field Investigator; and Reserve Deputy Sheriff, El Paso County, Colorado Sheriff's Department, Colorado Springs, Colorado: “It might not be related to the calf mutilation in Hoehne, but I have a report on Monday, March 16, 2009, at 8:20 PM Mountain, that a dark, grayish triangle flew over Colorado Springs. That was the same night that Tom Miller thinks his calf was mutilated. [ See Part 2 ]. The eyewitness was walking his dogs and looking at the night sky hoping to see the International Space Station go over. He could not see the odd aerial craft well, but said it looked “eerie,” almost transparent with slight shimmering on the edges in the shape of a triangle. The aircraft was moving silently from southwest to northeast in a straight, steady velocity without wavering. The eyewitness estimated that at arm's length, the craft was big enough that it would take three to four inches of his hand to cover its size in the sky. He watched for about thirty seconds until he could no longer see the shimmering, triangle-shaped craft. At Tom Miller’s ranch, the first thing I saw was ‘Holy Mackerel!’ And the first thought I had was it sure looks like a large predator got hold of the 1-week-old calf. It was very eerie."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"O n Tuesday morning, March 17, 2009, rancher Tom Miller picked up the strangely mutilated, bloodless carcass of his 1-week-old male calf from beside the feed bin and placed what was left of the body on his flatbed truck, shown above. Image © 2009 by Chuck Zukowski, MUFON Field Investigator. Something you would expect to see in a horror flick where something comes in and just rips you apart. But, there was no blood splattered anywhere on the hair near the areas that were ripped or cut off the calf. And then the rancher, Tom Miller, pointed towards the ears of this calf, a little black Angus. The ears looked as though they had been surgically removed. I HAVE TOUCHED A LOT OF MUTILATION TISSUE WHERE THE EDGES WERE ALMOST LIKE PLASTIC, DARKENED AND HARDENED. I’M LOOKING AT YOUR PHOTO RIGHT NOW OF ONE OF THE EARS EXCISED AT THE SKULL. IT HAS VARIOUS LEVELS OF LAYERS, NOT EXACTLY SMOOTH LIKE SOME MUTILATIONS DOWN TO THE SKULL BONE. Exactly. 1 -week-old male calf discovered by Hoehne, Colorado, rancher Tom Miller on March 17, 2009, with both ears removed as if exposed to heat, its abdomen and all internal organs removed and pelvis broken as if dropped to the ground from some height. Image © 2009 by Chuck Zukowski, MUFON Field Investigator. DID YOU TOUCH THAT TISSUE TO SEE WHAT IT FELT LIKE? With surgical gloves on, I did feel the difference along the edges of the ear excisions. You do want to check and feel for hardness around the excision. I took samples by taking both excised ear regions off. I went about 1-inch or so outside where the ears used to be and outside the mutilator's excisions and did my own circular cut using a razor blade. When I was making that cut, I could feel the coolness of the moisture between my fingers and the skull and the tissue between my index finger and thumb that was holding what I was cutting. Right then and there, you could really tell a difference between what it should normally feel like after a kill and that it's different. Like you said, it was very plastic, hard plastic, like something you would expect to be molded. THAT WOULD MEAN THE EARS WERE PROBABLY EXPOSED TO HIGH HEAT WHEN THEY WERE EXCISED."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"From my untrained eye – I’m not a veterinarian or trained lab technician – but to a layman, it looks as though the ear tissues were cauterized. TOM MILLER TOLD ME HE HAS NEVER SEEN – EVEN IN PREDATOR KILLS – THE TAKING OF BOTH EARS LIKE THAT. Oh, absolutely! Both ears removed like that was definitely an anomaly I’ve never seen before. As a matter of fact, I got a chance to talk to a brand inspector from the Colorado State Board of Stock Inspection. Here’s a guy whose profession is to know cows. The anomalies of what was left of the ears, that’s something he had never seen. He has seen predators munch on ears before, usually the last thing because there really is no meat. If you think about it, if you are a predator, there is really nothing in the ear that you would go after first. You’re going to go after a gut kill. The rancher and the brand inspector were both very amazed, not only at how the ears were taken off, but the actual kill itself. The brand inspector said, ‘It looked like a semi-truck had hit it and removed everything!’ But the distance from the nearest road to where the calf was found near the feeder was a good 150 to 170 yards. I took samples there at the site where Tom Miller found it. The site had some hay over it that had been there for a few days. There were no bloodstains anywhere that I could see on the hay. It was like lots of tissue was taken from the calf and then the carcass was dropped from a high elevation and when it hit the ground, it crushed the pelvis, which was dislocated. The shoulder areas were broken and dislocated. I’ve never seen a predator kill that resembles this week-old calf. NO, NEITHER HAVE I AND NEITHER HAS TOM MILLER. IN THIRTY YEARS OF INVESTIGATING ANIMAL MUTILATIONS, I HAVE NEVER SEEN A CARCASS LIKE THIS IN EITHER CATEGORY OF PREDATOR KILL OR THE CLASSIC ANIMAL MUTILATION. THIS IS UNIQUE AND YET, WHAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ANIMAL MUTILATION PHENOMENON IS THE REMOVAL OF THOSE EARS AT THE SKULL. Yes, absolutely! I do have photographs of the front of the mouth where you look for removed teeth – and I saw that both eyes and tongue were there. All that was there with the Mike Duran cow in Weston, too. People have asked me on some cases, ‘Well, that doesn’t fit the scenario of cattle mutilations.’ Scenario of what? How do you know what the scenario is?! I mean, whoever is doing these cattle mutilations are going to do whatever they want to do to that particular animal at that particular time. And just because it doesn’t fit the criteria of every single cow, there are elements that it does fit. And that’s what makes this particular mutilation of the calf what I call ‘a non-Earth’ case. IT’S NOT NATURAL. It’s not natural as far as we know! Mutilated Animals Deliberately Returned to Be Found? TOM MILLER MADE A VERY KEEN OBSERVATION THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED AND WHOEVER IS RESPONSIBLE, THEY WANTED THIS CALF TO BE FOUND. WHERE THE CALF CARCASS WAS PLACED NEXT TO THE FEED BIN, THAT MORNING TOM WAS WORKING WITH ANOTHER PERSON ON A MACHINE AND THEY WERE STOPPED BY THE CALF'S BODY. TOM SAID HE HAD AN EERIE FEELING THAT THE CALF'S MUTILATED BODY WAS PLACED THERE TO BE SURE THAT HE FOUND IT. Yeah, I’ve picked that up sometimes talking with other ranchers on mutilations. It’s almost as if the animal was placed specifically for them to find it. We really don’t know who is doing this and what their thinking behind these mutilations is. IF THE MUTILATORS ARE NON-HUMANS AND THE EYEWITNESSES I’VE INTERVIEWED ARE CORRECT, THEY DESCRIBE BEAMS OF LIGHT COMING FROM ROUND, GLOWING AERIAL DISCS. EYEWITNESSES HAVE SEEN ANIMALS RISE IN THE BEAMS OF LIGHT, HAVE SEEN ANIMALS START DOWN IN BEAMS OF LIGHT AND THEN BE DROPPED TO THE GROUND THROUGH"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"TREES. IF SO, WE’RE DEALING WITH A TECHNOLOGY WE DON’T UNDERSTAND. We obviously don’t know how these ... ENTITIES. Yeah, we really don’t know how they think, how they reason or why they do things the way they do. We’d like to think they have some type of compassion ...but to be honest with you, you have to look at them 180 degrees opposite saying they have no compassion, are very analytical and robotic and they just do things we will never understand. But most of the time, it seems that the mutilators they try to get the animal back to an area where at least the rancher can find it. Is that what they are thinking? Or are they putting the carcass back to where they think the animal belongs? We really don’t know. And what is so significant about the calf? You have all the other cows in the herd and there mus be a reason to pick a particular subject and what is taken from the animal. We assume that whoeveer or whatever is doing this is reasoning out why they are going to take one particular animal and not the rest. Chuck Used Geiger Counter and TriField Meter CONSIDER THIS: ON MARCH 8, MIKE DURAN FINDS HIS 28-YEAR-OLD – THE OLDEST COW IN HIS HERD – WHO HAD GIVEN BIRTH TO A 3-MONTH-OLD. THE MOTHER IS MUTILATED IN A MORE CLASSIC WAY BY THE CREEK. THEN ON MARCH 17, WHICH IS ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF LATER, TOM MILLER FINDS A 1-WEEK-OLD CALF, THE YOUNGEST OF HIS HERD. SO YOU GET THIS SENSE OF SOMETHING THAT IS TAKING EXTREMES, LIKE SAMPLES. WITH YOUR INSTRUMENTS, WHAT DID YOU FIND AT THE CALF SITE BY THE FEED BIN COMPARED TO WHAT YOU FOUND AT THE DURAN MUTILATION ON THE CREEK BANK? I did not pick up any radiation signatures at the Duran site or at the Miller site. But one of the things I did take with me was my TriField meter and I did pick up electromagnetic readings from both animals – more readings with the Duran case probably because more of the animal was there. But I did also pick up readings from the calf. IN THE CALF AND IN THE DURAN COW, WHAT SPECIFIC FREQUENCIES SEEMED TO BE THE HIGHEST? I was picking up more on the magnetic range than the electric range. T riField Meter measures magnetic, electric and radio/microwave frequencies. See: TriFie ld Me te r. Now, as an investigator I need to experiment with live and other dead animals to see what readings I get so I have some normal baseline readings to compare with animal mutilations."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"That’s part of my investigation now – I have to understand why I got the readings that I got. Hoehne Calf Was Protected from Predators After Death One good thing in the Tom Miller case that Mike Duran could not do. When Tom Miller found his calf and realized the ears were missing – this has happened to him before (two previous mutilations) and that red flag went up to him. Tom also knew about the Mike Duran mutilation case that made the local newspapers the week before. What Tom did – thank goodness for us – was put the calf on the back of his flatbed truck and drove it into his barn and closed the doors. So, now we can guarantee there was no predator damage from the time he discovered it (morning of March 17, 2009) until the time that I saw it (afternoon of March 18, 2009). When I came up to the calf on the flatbed truck – even with a predator kill, you’re still going to get blood pooling. But if you look at my photographs of the animal on the back of that flatbed truck, there was no blood at all. It was as if the cow had been out there for a week and all the blood had dried up and dissipated. I’ve never seen that before. I also used a magnet I have that is flat and about 3 inches long and 1 inch wide. You take a baggie and turn it inside out and put the magnet on the backside and lightly sweep the magnet over the hair of the animal. What we’re looking for are any small, metallic objects that might be embedded in the hair. There are some cases in the past where little round, metal balls have been found. Once you drag the magnet with the plastic bag inside out, then you fold the bag up around the magnet and whatever was collected on it. But don't know if I'll have anything significant on these new cases. At least I was able to gather both excised ear tissues within 36 hours of the calf's suspected death and drove them to Colorado State University's Veterinarian Diagnostic Laboratory for analysis.” C huck Zukowski hand-delivered both ear tissues to CSU and as soon as there are test results, I will report further about the extraordinary calf mutilation. Then on Saturday, March 21, Chuck received yet another call about a mutilated cow about twelve miles southeast of Walsenburg on a ranch only about twenty miles from Tom Miller's place in Hoehne. By Sunday, March 22, Chuck was there to investigate and take more photographs. I interviewed the rancher, Jim Garren, on March 23, for Earthfiles Part 4. Historically, when there have been animal mutilations in one geographic region, there might be several more over the next few months. So, I hope viewers and listeners will contact me about any new mutilation reports at my email address: earthfiles@earthfiles.com. C ontinued in Part 4 - Third cow mutilation southeast of Walsenburg.
