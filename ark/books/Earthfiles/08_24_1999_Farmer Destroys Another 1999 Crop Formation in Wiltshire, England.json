Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Farmer Destroys Another 1999 Crop Formation in Wiltshire, England © 1999 by Linda Moulton Howe August 24, 1999 Wiltshire County, England Photographer Peter Sorensen has e-mailed some updates from Wiltshire, England where he has spent the summer photographing the extraordinary series of patterns in cereal crops since the early spring. First, another formation has been destroyed by an angry farmer. Peter Sorensen, Videographer: E-mail: \"On Monday morning (August 23, 1999), I heard that there was a big, new formation at Allington and immediately arranged to fly. Agonizingly, when I reached it at 11:30 AM, the farmer had already cut it out just like the Basket (August 4, 1999). The design is not discernible in the stubble. It was nearly five tramlines across - bigger than the Cherhill star by more than a tramline. It was large enough to be our Grand Finale (for 1999), but we will never know (because) I don't think enough of the design remains to show what it looked like. In my sadness and anger, I could hardly hold my camera steady! Allington formation of rings cut down on August 23, 1999 before an aerial photograph of the design could be taken.

But there are many thousands of us who are grateful for all the wonderful gifts and thank (the circlemakers) beyond measure for a most spectacular season!\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Interior of beautiful \"Basket\" formation discovered August 6, 1999 at Bishops Cannings before the farmer erased it entirely with his tractor against all please to temporarily save it.
