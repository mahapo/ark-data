Rhodes of unidentified aerial object seen at dusk on Monday, July 7, 1947 over his Phoenix, Arizona home and printed upside down on front page of the July 9, 1947 edition of The Arizona Republic © 1947 by William A. Rhodes. The rear curvature inward is very similar to sketches by some retired military men who claim firsthand knowledge of craft of unknown origin. December 17, 1999 Phoenix, Arizona - After filing the December 8, 1999 earthfiles.com report about the similarity between the William A. Rhodes 1947 photograph and at least three sketches by former military eyewitnesses of craft of unknown origin, I learned that the handwritten date on my copy of The Arizona Republic newspaper of July 11 was not correct. A printed copy of the original newspaper was sent to me showing the correct date of July 9, 1947, shown above. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Further, Mr. Rhodes's previous recollection was that he had taken the film to his friend in the photography department at the newspaper the night before the photographs appeared on the front page. However, Roswell investigator and author, Don Schmitt, has re-printed in his book UFO Crash At Roswell II a letter written on May 26, 1948 to William Rhodes by Colonel H. M. McCoy, Chief of Intelligence, U.S. Air Force. (See below.) The letter specifically references not only Mr. Rhodes's sighting and photography on July 7, 1947, but another eyewitness \"on or about the same date as your original sighting by another civilian in Phoenix.\" Therefore, the correct time sequence seems to be that William A. Rhodes took the two photographs at dusk on July 7, 1947 and The Arizona Republic newspaper published them upside down on July 9, 1947. Those dates have now been corrected on the December 8, 1999 earthfiles.com report. Photograph of final composite model of \"craft of unknown origin\" produced by Tim Bauer, Senior Design Director, © 1999 The Franklin Mint, Philadelphia, Pa. More Information: The composite model of \"craft of unknown origin\" was produced by The Franklin Mint from drawings by Frank Kaufmann, former U. S. Army Sergeant"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Clifford E. Stone and \"Kewper\" discussed in December 8, 1999 earthfiles.com report. Senior Mint Design Director, Tim Bauer, worked on the Mint's CAD System to produce a composite that could be rendered into a die-cast model. It's perhaps as close as the general public can come to at least one particular type of aerial craft retrieved from the New Mexico desert in July 1947, pending release of true information from government insiders who were ordered to enforce a strict policy of silence and denial. For in-depth documents, images and history about government knowledge and cover-up of these and other crash retrieval events, see my book, Glimpses of Other Realities, Volumes I and II in Earthfiles Shop.
