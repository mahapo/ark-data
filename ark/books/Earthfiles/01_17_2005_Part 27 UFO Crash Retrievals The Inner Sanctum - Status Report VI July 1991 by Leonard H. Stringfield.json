Here begins Part 27 of Status Report VI, from July 1991. These status reports were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report VII begins at Earthfiles 12/15/03 . Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. Leonard Stringfield: \"PHOTO PHANTASIES In recent years, photographs purporting to show alien spacecraft fail to excite the serious researcher. Good reason: most can be simply explained as conventional aerial objects - and in the heap, there are some good fakes. The most likely fakes are also the most dazzling, usually showing a sharply contoured disc or boomerang or maybe an ellipsoid or a spheroid. Some have domes and windows and other imposing details. Trick, high-tech photography today can produce an impressive UFO! But not necessarily faked are most nocturnal photos which usually show a pinhead light or a luminous blob streaking across the sky. In most cases, the witness - probably a novice with camera - simply cannot identify the light's source in a tricky night sky. Photos which are claimed to depict the alien entity are the worst offenders to research. Most are so indistinct, they are worthless. Then there are the oddball photos that show teasing portions of a weird anatomy of 'something' that might have its origin tied to P. T. Barnum of circus fame. But, to make the alien photo gallery even more disreputable, is one known case of a photo taken of a simulated alien dummy at an exhibition, with no intention of deception, that got into the wrong hands. It's still being passed around as authentic. Let's review three samples of spurious spacemen: Photos 1 In Status Report III (1982), Page 47 (to be reprinted at Earthfiles), I published two questionable photos showing a strange assembly of bones, including a rib cage, clavicle and one arm in view, bent at the elbow with a claw-like hand. But the photo shows no head. The sender, Mack, stated that the creature was a fossilized specimen discovered in a bed of shale in Florida and that it was stored secretly in the basement at the University of Pennsylvnia. According to Mack, there were hints that it had an alien-human evolutionary connection. Being more curious about Mack as a person than his anthropological wisdom, I requested a photo showing the head and the lower portion of the body. Well, a second photo arrived which showed a part of a rod-like, right arm - still no head. Later, to keep researchers who had seen the first photo informed, I decided to publish both copies, side-by-side, hoping that its embarrassing display would flush out at least an explanation for the missing body parts. But nothing more was heard "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"from Mack. At this point in our 'collaboration,' I am sure looking back that he had detected my suspicions about his modus operandi. It was in 1988 that a researcher, R. M. Mills of Armonk, New York - who had read my Status Report III - sent me a copy of a picture of the ribbed cage creature, with a head and the bottom. He discovered it in the July 1978 special edition of Ancient Astronauts, published by Official UFO magazine. Then a second version of the head - slightly different - -came from Christian Page in Canada in May 1991, along with the Carp crash report I had requested. But to my astonishment, both Mills' and Page's renditions revealed the lower portion of the creature's body - with a mermaid's fishtail! No wonder Mack did not send me the missing head. Thanks to the efficiency of his filing system, Page refreshed my memory by sending me a duplicate copy of a letter sent to me originally in May 1989 from his friend, Marc Peloquin, a professional photographer in Natick, Massachusetts. It reads in part: 'Of interest to me are the photos on page 47 ( Status Report III, 1982) entitled, The Alien Hand ... I am enclosing a copy of my resume to highlight my eight years as a Biomedical Photographer for the Nobel Prize Laureate, Dr. David Hubel of the Department of Neurobiology, Harvard Medical School. It is my responsibility to photograph various biological specimens related to Dr. Hubel's research. 'Regarding the photos, it is very difficult for me to believe that the artifact is, indeed, a fossil. The bone structure of the limb is nothing familiar to me ... but more significant are the lines between the 'rib bones' and the line of the 'elbow.' I am convinced this is man-made. 'Curiously enough, I recall seeing a display of odd man-made items at Harvard's Peabody Museum. Some years ago, there was a display of weird and faked items once exhibited by P. T. Barnum. One item called a 'Mermaid,' closely resembles the object photographed on page 47 ...' For a comparison with the photo published in Status Report III, both the xeroxed copy of the creature from Official UFO and a photograph received from Christian Page are reproduced here. What Are These? Mermaids? Photos in uppe r le ft was received initially from source, Mack, with head and lower parts of body missing. My request for missing parts brought the photo in uppe r right , showing nothing more than a long protruding arm as shown in photograph be low received from the files of Christian Page, which shows an Oriental rendition of a mermaid based on backup information from Marc Peloquin. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Unidentified creature was provided by Christian Page as \"Oriental rendition of a mermaid.\" Image source unknown. Below: Illustration from R. M. Mills in 1988, found in the July 1978 issue of Ancient Astronauts, reveals one version of the 'missing' head and the 'mermaid' tail. Photos 2 The 'missing parts' photo story is strange, but no more so than the rest of the story about Mack and his cohort, Jack, both New Englanders. For a capsule review of this episode, I must say that I already had a strong suspicion about their melodramatic behavior when we met in Erie, Pennsylvania, to discuss the super-sensitive, top secret photos they hoped I might be tempted to use to expose the UFO cover-up. There was a tense moment of silence as Mack opened his briefcase and then, presto, like a magician, he whisked out several black and white, 8 x 10 photos. In front of me, alas, was photographic evidence of the alien, a cadaver inside a rectangular glass case. Lying prone, with its long arms stretched down to the knee joint, the body was that of a humanoid, looking almost human. Its muscled arms and legs and portions of the chest and abdomen glared, reflecting the hidden light from above. The head, curiously, was not human or like the big, fetal-shaped kind so often associated with the little grays. Only in the photo, which showed the head closely enough, were the eyes in view, looking large and cavernous. The nose was just a dot of light and the mouth was just a slit. On the floor of the case, sitting on either side of the head, were beakers emitting a swirl of vapor and at the base, surrounding the body, were vents. One hazy photo, out of conformity with the others, showed what appeared to be a mangled or twisted body inside a glass case of the same model as the others. Still another photo showed a body obviously retouched. It was also obvious that all the photos were several generation reprints - hardly the kind that any proud secret agency would keep on file. Mack did say that the photos had been lifted from CIA files. If I played Mack's and Jack's game, I was to be the one to show and tell the world - the indisputable proof of a UFO cover-up. Here it was in a neat package - photos, plus a copy of a Government Memorandum to a federal judge, advising him that Mack was a national security risk facing trial for espionage. The time and place for my shocking announcement was to be at the MUFON Symposium in Houston in June 1980, which I had already planned to attend. If all went well, which according to their plan, meant that I would have to show the media the photos and document and try to get maximum publicity. Then, lo and behold, I would be richly rewarded with more alien photos - in color! On the way to Houston in a van with my close research friends, Dick Hall and Tom Deuley, I thought long and hard about my dilemma. My choices were agonizingly simple: go the full nine yard with the hope of getting more information from Mack and Jack about their modus operandi, their sources, their game - and the colored photos - or renege and later regret that my own little counter-intelligence ploy might have been productive. Summing it up, I told Dick, 'I'll be damned if I do and damned"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"if I don't.' With permission from Walt Andrus, my important announcement led off the morning's program. But I kept only part of the bargain, stating that I had photos in my possession allegedly showing preserved dead aliens which needed further study before making them public. I did not show them to the audience or to the media. (See MUFON UFO Journal, July 1980 issue, Page 15, for text of my statement.) Looking back, I was surprised - not shocked - to learn that a full-page photo showing an encased alien similar to Mack's appeared in the July issue of a new pulp magazine named UFO Sightings, Vol. 1, No. 1, published by the Fass Brothers in New York. Featured was an article by David McCarthy (who is he?) entitled, The Question of Teleportation. The caption under the photo read, 'A prototype of a cryogenic freeze chamber. The 'person' inside is actually a mannequin encased in a special mylar foil.' The special Vol. 1, No. 1, edition of a new magazine was well-timed to coincide with my announcement in Houston. But, there was still more to be revealed that might be a shock to the uninitiated UFO buff. Shortly after leaving Houston, John Schuessler, Deputy Director of MUFON, called to inform me that he found in his magazine files a copy of Ancient Astronauts, December 1977 issue, featuring on its cover the picture of a retouched alien under glass - the same photo that Mack had given me from \"CIA\" files. Headlined, 'Secret Chamber Beneath the Empire State Building,' the story raved over the discovery of an alien body underground in cryogenic suspension. The publisher: The Fass Brothers. Unless I am suffering from paranoia, it is in my judgment that Mack and Jack and maybe even the Fass Brothers, who used phony alien photos to back up phony magazine stories, all might have had undercover ties with the Inner Sanctum whose purpose, at that time, was to discredit my research into crash/retrievals. The whole story about this photo-based misadventure is too long and too twisted by personalities to recount in this report. Pertinent, perhaps, to illustrate Mack's apparent deep-throated complicity in trying to discredit my work, I think back to the alleged Government Memorandum that was sent to the federal judge who was to try him on charges of espionage. Maybe Mack was tried in court and sentenced to jail, as he had admitted to me. Maybe, too - and it's just a thought - that he might have been released on the condition that he could atone himself by playing a game of intrigue with me. Or, maybe he was brainwashed into doing the deed. Or maybe he was an intelligence agent, and in that event, the government memo was a fake. Another thought: how could he have access to such a secret memo? Whatever its status, the memo was published in Status Report III (See page 40). [To be reprinted by Earthfiles.com.] If, indeed, the 'mermaid' and the encased aliens were used by Mack and Jack with the intention to snare me into a trap, then their part might have been only one maneuver of an overall, orchestrated scheme to denigrate my crash/retrieval work. Suddenly and inexplicably after Houston MUFON, I became the target of a concentrated 'Siege' of vicious attacks, some coming from expected quarters. A few came from the unexpected. Even stranger was the coincidental cut-off of dependable 'insiders' and most of my firsthand sources who had shared their knowledge or experiences with retrieved UFOs and the remains of alien crews. It was unthinkable to me that I could not reach over a dozen contacts by mail who left no forwarding addresses and could not reach them by phone, which in several instanced had been disconnected. I suppose if there is a lesson to be gained from photographic phantasies, I for one - as a researcher - should have been a more faithful reader of all the far-out stories with pictures published in the sleazy UFO magazines of that period - especially the 1977 issue of Ancient Astronauts which showed the retouched photo on its cover. Lessons of the past apply today.\" ontinued in Final Part 28 - Photo 3 and Status Report VI, Inner Sanctum , ends. Soon to follow, Status Report V.
