Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Part 1: Texas Case of Shape-Shifting Human-to-Reptilian © 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe October 10, 2004 Texarkana, Texas - When I was writing Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. 1: Facts & Eyewitnesses (See: Earthfiles Shop ) , I included a chapter entitled \"Other Beings.\" In it, there are fifty drawings by people from coast to coast in the United States who, over the past several decades, have reported conscious encounters with a variety of non-human entities and submitted drawings to me about those encounters. One case was from a Missouri woman who saw a \"repulsive-looking entity with thin arms.\" Missouri artist, Lisa Dusenberry, sent a descriptive note and drawing she had made with the eyewitness she called \"M.J.\" Drawing by \"M.J.,\" Springfield, Missouri, adult female. During alleged 1991 abduction, encountered 5'9\" reptilian creature. Drawing by Lisa Dusenberry after M. J.'s August 13, 1991, hypnosis session. Compare this drawing to description by R.S. in Texarkana case featured below. \"M. J. was in bed sleeping when she began floating out of bedroom toward a light and through wall. Felt the sensation of being pulled by a force with fast movement. The being stood about 5'9\" with green body, looked scaly and rough. Felt electricity going through her hands. Saw pea-green eyes with pupils like a cat (vertical slits), black and yellow. Eyes slanted down toward outer face. No hair. Small mouth. Thin arms, hands like a duck with tan or brown webbing. Three or four long fingers with nails on end. After hypnosis, she felt that 'they need human beings to make them stronger. Trying to get our genes - threat of dying out. Inbreeding with us to see if what we have can make them stronger.\" Like so many other experiencers of the UFO abduction syndrome, the Missouri abductee did not understand clearly what the survival problem is or why earth life should be involved in an alien species' regeneration. I talked about this drawing and several others I have received from alleged conscious eyewitnesses with Jim Marrs, author of several books, including Crossfire, An Alien Agenda, Rule By Secrecy and Inside Job. Jim became interested in the reptilian connection "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"to both the abduction phenomenon and ancient Sumerian and Egyptian history, which he discussed in An Alien Agenda and Rule By Secrecy. Humanoid crocodiles such as Sebek/Sobek in Egypt and Sumerian Ubaid figurines of large-eyed humanoids depicted with reptilian scales are facts of ancient history. Sebek/Sobek embodied the power of the crocodile against its prey and epitomized the military might of the pharaoh. Relief from Temple of Sebek and Horus by Kom Ombo. Terra-cotta figurines from Ur in southern Mesopotamia (Iraq) about 4,500 B. C., or earlier, which depict tall, thin beings with scales on legs; strange, unidentified round objects on upper body; large, slanted eyes and enlarged heads.

Sumerian scholar, Zecharia Sitchin, writing in his \"Earth Chronicles\" series beginning with the 1976 classic, The 12th Planet, to his 1993 book, When Time Began, describes the ancient Annunaki \"gods\" of Sumeria as being reptilian and the manipulators of DNA in already-evolving primates to create Homo sapiens workers on Earth to serve the Annunaki. Cornell astronomer Carl Sagan's most famous book was Dragons of Eden , in which he described the sudden jump in human intelligence that could not be explained by Darwinian evolution and seemed linked to a change in the \"lower reptilian\" region of evolving primate brains. \"Are Reptilian Entities Still Among Us Disguised As Humans?\" On March 23, 1999, Jim Marrs called me and his voice was urgent. \"Linda, write down a phone number I'm going to give you and call it immediately. The woman expects to hear from you and I just want to know what you think after you've interviewed her.\" Following Jim's instructions, I called the number he gave me, not having any idea what the subject would be. Now five and a half years later with the world in so much political and military chaos, I share that interview in the spirit of the question the woman asked me: \"Are reptilian entities still among us disguised as humans?\" Jim Marrs and I hope that Earthfiles viewers, who might have had a similar experience"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"which has not been shared for fear of ridicule, will contact me in confidence. As I have with the Texarkana woman (general region, but not specific location), I will protect name and location upon request. My goal at Earthfiles is always to deepen understanding about earth mysteries. The interview below begins after R.S. explained she had described for Jim two conscious encounters with what she perceived to be reptilian beings disguised as human females. Interview, March 23, 1999: R. S., Housewife with 4 children, 61-years-old in 1999, Texarkana region of Texas: \"The first encounter I had was many years ago, around 1965. I had four children and they were all down with the measles at one time. My daughter, Mary (pseudonym) she loved school and she wanted a poster. They were trying for a poster to win a $25 Savings Bond. She said, 'Mother, make me a poster,' hoping she would win. Which she did not, I might add. But anyway, I told her I would go to the library and see if we could work some poster that I thought could win. So, I went to the library. While I was there reading, I was sitting at a rectangular, long table. I had been reading for at least an hour, maybe longer. I heard this gasp from the room. I looked up and in walked in one of the most striking, beautiful women that I had ever seen in my life. She was very tall. I would say she was close to 6 feet tall. She had on heels. She had masses of red hair piled on top in an upswept hairdo, which made her look even taller. She was absolutely regal looking. As I told Jim Marrs, I'm sure her suit cost more than my car. I knew very little about fashion and that type clothing, but you could tell by looking that she was impeccably tailored in every way, that everything about her was money well put together, perfect skin. She looked like a movie star to me. She come and sat down on the other end of the rectangular table. I was watching her along with most of the other women and a few other men in there. And I noticed that she kept gazing at me. She did not stare as if hard looking, but when I looked up at her, she was simply and calmly looking at me without let up. I was feeling unkempt, according to her standards. It was like I wondered if I was dressed right. I felt ill at ease. I felt awkward because here was this gorgeous creature staring at me. I felt like a peasant in front of a queen, if you want the truth. She asked me after several minutes of this uncomfortable gazing at me it was not really asking as much as a statement of fact 'Would I come and talk with her?' I got up and went and I've often wondered why I went. It was not a command in the sense of 'Get your rear end up here.' And yet, there was force behind it, is all I can tell you. I simply got up and went. She said, 'We're going to talk about you,' or something like that. She said, 'Your name begins with 'R,' does it not?' I said, 'Yes, my name is R.' She told me that I had four red-headed children, which I did and do. She told me my first child was born black-headed and turned red later. Absolute fact. I said yes to all these statements, dumbfounded and amazed. I can't even tell you my emotions at the time. I think I was intimidated by her looks, by her interest in me and by this 'force' is all I can tell you, Linda. I don't know how to explain it any better than that. She told me I would get a divorce in 1980, which was several years after this 1965 event in the library. She said I would marry a man whose first name would begin with a 'J.' I said, 'OK,' thinking this may or may not come to pass, kind of filing things away that she was saying. She told me that I had a mission, something to do with reptilians. To my knowledge, that was the first time I had ever heard the word 'reptilians,' as in a being or entity. She asked me if I knew what a 'coven' was. I said, 'No, ma'am, I don't.' And she said, 'It's like a wiccan.' She did not use the word 'witch.' She said, 'Wiccan.' I said, 'No, ma'am, I'm not familiar with that.' She said, 'It's the study and love of Earth and how to work with Earth energies.' Basically she confounded me. I was not even vaguely familiar with the terms she was using about anything she spoke. It was like I was speaking one language and she was speaking totally over my head, other than the questions and statements about my children. Then she told me that the number 13 would be very powerful for me. I asked her, 'Why?' She said something about the number 13 was not understood, that it was a very powerful number and that in time I would understand what the number 13 meant. Then she took out what you and I would call a business card, except it was blank on both sides. She told me"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"that when I was totally alone to do this spell (which she hand wrote on the card) and I would get great understanding about my mission, or something to that effect. The exact words, I have actually forgotten. Well, Linda, I had four children. I have a retarded son. My first child is a genius, my second child is retarded. Then, I have two normal children. I was never alone, never, and it took seven years for this to be - for me to have a free moment when I could do what she wrote on the card. One night, it dawned on me for the first time in years I was going to be alone. My kids were a little older, they had things to do. My baby daughter, the one that lives down here by me now my mother was going to take her and spend the night. My husband worked nights and I thought, 'I'm alone. I'm going to find that card.' Finally, I found it and she had told me to draw a pentagram big enough to put a chair in it. The only warning she gave me was that until the spell was complete, no matter what I seen and heard, I should never leave the chair. If I did, I could die. I think part of the reason that I never tried it is that some part of me was scared even though some part of me was drawn to it. But on some level, there was still a great deal of fear. We were building a den and bedroom on at the time. The den was finished and the bedroom was not. It had one complete wall up with sheet rock and a partial wall with sheet rock, so we had a couple of blank walls and it was still in the process of being finished. I went in there, drew the pentagram with chalk approximately 5 feet diameter. I took my chair into it. She told me to take an offering in. I thought, 'What is an offering?' The only offering I could think of was that I had a cake cooked. I took a piece of cake, put it on a saucer and went in there. I had looked at the card many times over the seven years and realized I did not know how to pronounce the words. She wrote the words and gave me the card and told me when I was alone, this is what I was to do. Draw the pentagram, put the chair in it, do not leave, give the offering, do the chanting, repeat the words, and I would get a clue to my mission in life. WHO WERE YOU OFFERING THE CAKE TO? She did not say and I was dumb enough not to ask. I honestly did not know. At the time I was doing it, I was fearful and a little risqué. I thought, 'I'm going to have a kick. It's going to be a delight. It's a little bit scary.' The whole thing was like an apex of something that had come to pass that allowed for this to happen that I cannot tell you why, when, where or under what circumstances, except what I'm telling you. \"Upright Alligator\" I got in the pentagram. I put the chair in. I repeated the words as best as I could, which was silly words I thought. They were certainly not normal English words that you and I would hear normally. I had very long hair at the time. The doors were shut, the windows were shut. And yet this wind came up (and blew my hair). I became very fearful. I realized on some level that something was happening that I could not control. I closed my eyes and remember thinking that I had not prayed in a long time, but this was probably a great time to start. I remember trying to look at it as a kick, something to be laughed about later. But the wind was undeniably real. It was frightening. I was scared. I shut my eyes several times. At one time, I don't know for how long because I don't remember how long I had them shut. But when I opened my eyes and I know this sounds totally bizarre but standing before me and I was sitting in a dining room chair standing before me slightly taller than head-high. I'm a tall woman, 5'8.5\". If I were sitting in a chair, I would still be nearly 5 feet tall in an upright position. Standing before me is what you and I would call an 'upright alligator.' Except that it did not appear frightening in the sense like it was going to attack. It had this steady stare just like the woman (in library) did, just like her. DO YOU KNOW IF HER EYES AND THE ALLIGATOR'S EYES HAD VERTICAL PUPILS, AS OPPOSED TO ROUND? No, I don't. I don't remember her eyes being any different than your or my eyes. The alligator's eyes was red I do know that, and they had the vertical up and down pupils. I noticed that, but I immediately shut my eyes. Unbeknownst to me at the time, my daughter had gotten sick to her stomach and my mother had brought her back home. My mother knew, of course, that I was in the house, so she let my daughter come through the house yelling, 'Mama, where are you?' She come to the back of the den where I was and she opened the door and yelled, 'Mama!' I said, 'Don't!' And at the time I yelled 'Don't!' the wind was so fierce that at first it"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"knocked my daughter down, kind of on her back hip to the side. She got up on her knees and I said, 'Oh, God!' I was just I don't know I went through such a period of fear there. All I can tell you is that I was praying loud and long and I know that sounds comical, but it's the truth. WAS THE BEING STILL STANDING THERE? No, when I opened my eyes again, the being was gone, my cake was gone, my saucer was gone, and the saucer never came back. My daughter was very scared for a couple of days. She had to sleep with me. DID SHE SEE THE BEING? You know, I asked her and I don't know. I don't really know. I know she kept having nightmares for several days. She wanted to sleep with a light on or sleep with me. I don't know, Linda. THE TIMING OF HER COMING HOME IS ODD, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO GO BACK TO THE EYES. CAN YOU PLEASE GIVE ME A DESCRIPTION IN TERMS OF SOMETHING I MIGHT KNOW OF THE RED THAT YOU WERE LOOKING AT? The eyes were red, Linda, is all I can tell you. DID THEY GLOW? OR WAS IT A RED LIKE A TOMATO SKIN? I'm going to say more red like you would look at a tomato skin. And yet, they had a power that was directed. You felt power from this creature. And yet, I can honestly look back and I was scared to death. I don't know what I thought that I could conjure up, but whatever, it certainly was not that! WHEN YOU REMEMBER BEFORE YOUR DAUGHTER CAME HOME AND YOU ARE LOOKING EYE-TO-EYE AT AN APPROXIMATE 4.5 TO 5 FOOT TALL ALLIGATOR WITH THE RED EYES, WITH VERTICAL PUPILS LIKE A SNAKE'S OR CROCODILE'S DO YOU REMEMBER ANY IMPRESSION IN YOUR MIND OF EITHER A THOUGHT VOICE, OR OF SYMBOLS, OR OF IMAGES OF ANYTHING? (long pause) No, I can't say a thought. Right now, I can't remember a symbol. The only thing I can honestly tell you that over the years, I felt like it was communicating with me. And yet I cannot tell you why or how, but communication, yes. WHAT WAS THE RESIDUE INSIDE YOURSELF AFTER THAT INCIDENT IN TERMS OF THE QUESTION: WHAT IS MY MISSION? I don't know. At the time, it was so far fetched, above and beyond anything I had ever thought, assumed, dreamed or dealt with. Linda. It was like I had been dropped off the face of the Earth or I had never encountered before and had nothing to relate to it with. I honestly don't know. It was so fearful that for a time I don't think I did want to deal with it. I think I almost retarded learning from it from my fear. It was only later, probably two or three years later, that I began to see what this meant. (Around 1975) I would go back to the library often, just to see if I could see the red-haired woman again (from the 1965 library table). I was too scared to coherently think of anything. I asked myself, 'Why did this happen? Why did she pick me? What did this mean?' I couldn't answer any of those questions. It was a foreign thing. ANY DREAMS AFTER THE INCIDENT WITH THE LIZARD OR REPTILE? The only dream I can specifically remember having after that several weeks after that, I took a terrible cold, flu, the usually bad aches, pains. My mother came to stay with the kids. One night I had the electric blanket on, even though it was warm weather. I still felt cold. I could hear mother in there with the kids playing a game with them. Linda, I saw something standing by the side of the bed that was pale green. I took it as a form which I cannot tell you what it was, but it was like a reassuring form. When I told my mother about it, she thought it was due to the fever and I had a bad dream. But I did not believe I was asleep at the time. WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THE BEING WHEN YOU HAD THE WIND BLOWING AROUND YOU AND YOU SAT ON THE CHAIR IN THE PENTAGRAM? Yellow-green. YELLOW-GREEN WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? More of a yellow-green than a green. THINK OF SOMETHING I MIGHT KNOW THAT WOULD BE CLOSE."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Take a shade of emerald green and a shade of lime green with yellow mixed. It had scales. It looked just like if we had gone to the zoo and seen an upright alligator with red eyes, gazing at you as in total curiosity, and yet trying to communicate its essence with you. That's all I can ever come to. WHEN WAS THE SECOND INCIDENT?\" C ontinued in Part 2 Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
