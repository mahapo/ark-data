Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon White Balls of Light and Helicopter Videotaped in Woodborough Hill Field © 2000 by Linda Moulton Howe Tuesday, July 18, 2000 between 8 and 8:15 PM in Wiltshire, England, half a dozen small white lights traveled over the wheat field between Pickled Hill and Woodborough Hill, Wiltshire, England. A helicopter also appeared and circled low in the field where the lights moved. All were videotaped by Andrew J. Buckley of Manchester, England. This map of events © 2000 by Andrew J. Buckley. August 19, 2000 Woodborough Hill near Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, England - Recently during my research trip to England, I met and talked with Manchester graphic artist, Andrew J. Buckley. He showed me about a dozen videotapes he has taken the past few years of mysterious aerial lights associated with crop formations in the county of Wiltshire. The most dramatic incident occurred this summer on Friday, July 18, 2000, between 8 and 8:15 PM. Andy was on Pickled Hill aiming his camera toward Woodborough Hill to view and videotape two small formations that had emerged in the fields below. Interview: Andrew J. Buckley, Graphic Artist, Manchester, England: \"It was a little before 8 PM and I had only been there five minutes or so when out of the corner of my eyes, I saw a flash coming from the field on the left. I was surprised to see a small, bright object moving along the surface of the plowed field at the foot of the hills. HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE IT IN TERMS OF COLOR AND SIZE? It was obviously quite bright. It was also quite small. I would estimate somewhere around a football or beach ball, maybe sort of about 12 to 15 inches in diameter and sharply outlined. COLOR? "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"White. All the lights I filmed were white in color. And it was moving quickly quite close to the ground, maybe only a few inches above the ground. But it seemed to be maneuvering along the contours of the hill as if it were aware of the hillside. It increased in altitude slightly when it came to a divide in the field. There was a sort of small crop formation next to Woodborough Hill, a simple circle, and it moved across that formation before disappearing from my view. I was quite annoyed that I hadn't unpacked my video camera at the time. The light disappeared and I thought it would have been nice to have recorded it. I was also surprised to see it. And I wasn't expecting to see anything else, so I unpacked the recorder and started to film the formation which was down below in the fields. Again, I had only been filming for a minute or so when something caught my attention and I saw another object quite similar to the first. But this time it seemed to be moving in a slightly different direction. It appeared more closely to me and moving across my field of vision and again across the crop formation. This time I got my camera ready and got it (the light) quite quickly and managed a few minutes of footage. And then it kind of moved away again and out of the field of view. Almost immediately, I saw another object! And I thought, 'This is very interesting. How many more?' While I was filming this object which was very similar to the others - they are all roughly the same size - I heard quite a loud noise. I was looking through the viewfinder and couldn't see around me what was making this noise. I just assumed it was a tractor or something. It sounded like that. Then the light went out of view and I put my camera down. Coming from behind the trees on Woodborough Hill was a helicopter which was making a very loud noise, a military helicopter. And it appeared over the summit of the hill where the lights had been flying and kind of moved around in that area. Later, I identified the helicopter as being a Puma which I think is RAF (Royal Air Force) rather than an Army helicopter. Anyway, this helicopter seemed to bank slightly towards Knap Hill which is to the north and flew across in that direction and I got my camera on it. I also thought there might be other lights, but I couldn't see any at the time. DID YOU HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS TRYING TO ENGAGE WITH THE LIGHTS? CHASE THEM AWAY? DID YOU HAVE ANY SENSE THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS FOCUSED WHERE YOU SAW THE LIGHT MOTION? Sure, yeah. I'm fairly familiar with military helicopter activity in the area and there is quite a lot of helicopter maneuvers going on, mainly over towards Salisbury Plain. But occasionally we get some down in the valley. But that time of evening, It's quite unusual to see military helicopters flying around in that area. I did get the impression that the helicopter was aware of these objects because it was circling in the same vicinity. Had an object been flying around, the pilots must have seen them, but I couldn't see any at the time. THE SUN WAS STILL UP? Yeah. It was a fine evening. The sun would still be up, setting, and the time that the first object appeared would be sort of five minutes to eight o'clock in the evening, so the sun would still be quite high up. And the objects appeared over the next ten to fifteen minutes. The helicopter appeared in the area circling and while I was filming, I was aware there were some people coming up behind me on the hill. I could hear these voices getting louder and I glanced away and saw eight to ten men standing behind me which was quite unnerving. It turned out they were soldiers and they were on some kind of cross country run. They were all in some kind of running gear. And they stood behind me and watched me film the helicopter. They made certain comments regarding the helicopter such"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"as, 'That's one of our mates.' And were waving to it. And they were making some very joking remarks about the crop formation like they had made it, or it was one of theirs, or something, 'We did it the other night.' They stood there a minute or so and I managed to get a few of them on film and you can hear them on the soundtrack. Then they just ran off down the hill. While all this was going on, the helicopter had come back again across the valley behind Woodborough Hill and went up towards the Woodborough Village direction. Then it suddenly banked to the right and came back again. Now, as I was filming, I didn't actually see this at the time, but when I played back the tape, a light had actually appeared. It flew on a diagonal from bottom to top in front of the helicopter, but I would say the helicopter was quite a distance from the light. Whether the helicopter pilot saw it or not, I don't know. Anyway, the helicopter just kind of flew again across the other side of the valley and then flew off towards Pewsey and I never saw it again. So, I carried on filming and to my amazement, the objects reappeared and I saw two objects, small, and they seemed to be rotating around each other, kind of flying very close to the ground. And then the one went in one direction and I decided I would follow one of the objects. I don't know where the other one went to. The one I followed flew across the field of view. It really speeded up dramatically compared to the others which were quite leisurely. This one increased in speed and it was really quite difficult to follow it in the camera. It flew to my right down the valley and again disappeared. And then almost immediately, I saw two others which again I filmed. These were much larger than the previous two and seemed to be brighter as well. Again, they speeded up and moved across the field and one of the lights split in two in one frame of the videotape which is 1/30th of a second. Then they all disappeared. And that was it. After that, I didn't notice any more lights. THAT WAS ON THE NIGHT OF JULY 18TH. WERE THERE ANY MORE FORMATIONS IN THE AREA AFTER THAT? Yes, a new formation appeared quite close by at the Woodborough Canal Bridge which would be roughly where the lights were coming from. THAT WAS THE FIRST FORMATION I WAS IN. I GOT HERE ON THE NIGHT OF JULY 18TH AND WE WERE IN THAT ONE IN THE MORNING. IT WAS A VERY INTERESTING FORMATION, THE ONE AT THE BRIDGE. WERE YOU IN IT? Yes, I did go in it the following day to look at it. I was quite surprised to see it. I had not seen a formation there before. But at the time I hadn't connected it necessarily with the appearance of the lights. But now you mention it, it was very interesting because the lights appeared to come roughly from that area. IN THE CONTEXT OF PRESS RELEASES IN THE SECOND WEEK OF AUGUST (BY COLIN ANDREWS) THAT 80 TO 90 PERCENT OF THE CROP FORMATIONS IN WILTSHIRE ARE MANMADE. WHAT IS YOUR COMMENT ON THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF MORE THAN TEN YEARS OF FORMATIONS IN WILTSHIRE AND WORLDWIDE. I have seen no evidence that 80 % are manmade. Various people have claimed to make formations and there have been commissioned formations which I suppose don't count as hoaxes because we know who made the formations. But with regard to the other claims, I'm still waiting to see any evidence. I haven't seen any hard evidence. WHY DO YOU THINK SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING ON NATIONAL AND GLOBAL MEDIA TO MAKE SUCH A CLAIM? I suspect they have their own agendas whatever they are. I would say that in my"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"own opinion, there is quite a lot of misinformation going around. There has been misinformation regarding crop circles for years.\" More Information: Coming up in Earthfiles.com news, more about the West Stowell pulsing light and an interview with Andrew Buckley about the intelligence he has sensed in the lights he has now videotaped more than a dozen times in or near crop formations.
