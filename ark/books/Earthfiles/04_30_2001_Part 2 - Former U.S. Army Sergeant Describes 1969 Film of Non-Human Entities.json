Human-like with tight skull cap. White \"marshmallow\" being. Entity that resembled 6-fingered humanoid in Santilli film. Interview: April 29, 2001 Sergeant Clifford E. Stone, U. S. Army (Retired), Roswell, New Mexico: Small, Thin Gray-colored with Pear-shaped Head \"WHAT ENTITIES DID YOU SEE IN THE FILM? You saw several different types of beings. You saw a typical Grey. DESCRIBE THAT IN AS MUCH DETAIL AS YOU CAN. The small spindly bodies, the arms appeared to be longer than what would be normal. The head was much larger than what it should be, disproportionate to the body. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT I WOULD KNOW THAT YOU COULD COMPARE THE SHAPE OF THE HEAD TO THAT WOULD BE SIMILAR? A perfect pear. A fruit pear. The cranium section was large and when it got down into the cheeks. SUNK IN AND NARROW AT THE BOTTOM? Yes. And you could make out no lips, but you could make out the slit for the lips. The eyes, you could tell it had a film over the eyes, but they were still dark. Drawing by Lisa Dusenberry based on man's alleged "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"close encounter experience in 1947. From Page 264, Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I: Facts & Eyewitnesses © 1995 by Linda Moulton Howe. WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU COULD TELL THERE WAS A FILM OVER THE EYES? The eyes were closed, like they had a transparent eyelid. THE EYELID WAS DARKER? OR ARE YOU SAYING IT WAS A TRANSPARENT OR TRANSLUCENT LID OVER DARK EYES? Like a translucent lid over dark eyes. AND WERE YOU SEEING FILM IN COLOR OR B&W? You saw both B& W and color film. DID YOU SEE THESE BEINGS IN COLOR? I saw this particular Grey in color. WHAT GRAY THAT I MIGHT KNOW WOULD YOU COMPARE THE SKIN TO? I would say, you know like the color of a cigarette ash. It would be that color of gray. COULD YOU SEE THE ENVIRONMENT SURROUNDING THE BEINGS? IS IT IN A ROOM OR OUTDOORS? Outdoors. This one was dead, lying on the ground. Apparently the pictures was taken by whoever got there upon arrival to take pictures before anyone moved in. COULD YOU TELL FROM THE GROUND IF IT WAS FOREST, DESERT OR WHAT? There was vegetation, but I couldn't say it was a desert. It was a dirt area where the body was lying at. THERE WERE NO IDENTIFIERS ON THE FILM WITH TITLES SAYING WHAT THIS WAS? No. This was flashing by very quickly, one, two, three second clips. We had no idea what they were telling these people at the time they were shown. YOU REMEMBER THIS GREY CREATURE WITH THE PEAR-SHAPED HEAD, SOME SORT OF TRANSLUCENT LENS OR LID OVER DARK EYES, A SLIT FOR A MOUTH. WAS THERE ANY NOSE REGION? I can't remember if there was a nose. WHAT ABOUT EARS? No ears you could make out. WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT WOULD BE CLOTHING? There was clothing. In this instance, it was a tight-fitting gray, but darker gray than what was the entity's suit. I can't tell you if it was one piece, two piece - the reason for that is that from the upper torso up was the only time we got to see a good close up of the entity. FROM CHEST UP? From slightly below the chest. COULD YOU SEE ANY SYMBOLS, BELTS, ANYTHING ELSE? No belts or anything else on this particular entity. I want to say there was a symbol, but I can't recall if that was the case or not. WAS THIS LOOSE FITTING OR TIGHT FITTING? This was very tight fitting, like a leotard. IT WAS HARD TO TELL WHERE THE SKIN AND THE SUIT ITSELF LEFT OFF? No, you could definitely tell that. The neck you could see where the skin of the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"creature was and where the collar or neck goes through. WAS THE NECK OF IT RIGHT AROUND THE NECK OR A V-SHAPE OR ANYTHING? In this one, it was right up to the neck. No V or anything like that. WAS THE MATERIAL OR WHATEVER MADE OUT OF SHINY OR DULL? It was shiny reflective. AS COMPARED TO THE CIGARETTE ASH-COLORED SKIN? More like an aluminum. I'm not saying it was aluminum, but more shiny like aluminum. IT WAS A SHINY MATERIAL THAT HAD A LUSTER TO IT COMPARED TO THE CIGARETTE ASH SKIN? A luster, and also after you got down a couple inches from the neck and shoulders it seemed to be solid, it was like a mesh, but like knitted, and that may not be a good term. YOU COULD SEE THAT KIND OF DETAIL FROM SITTING UP THERE IN THE BALCONY? You could see that kind of detail in the close-ups. IT WASN'T LIKE IT WAS SMOOTH LIKE METAL? Right. It had a texture to it. COULD YOU SEE ANYTHING ABOUT THE HANDS ON THAT CREATURE? I don't remember anything about the hands on it. COULD YOU SEE ANYTHING ABOUT THE ARMS OR LEGS? Probably saw it at a distance, but nothing of any type detail. IN THE DISTANT SHOT, COULD YOU SEE ANY ENVIRONMENT AROUND IT? That's how we knew there was vegetation. YOU COULDN'T TELL IF IT WAS A FOREST OR DESERT SCENE? No, there wasn't a whole lot of trees, but there was a lot of tall grass. DID YOU HAVE ANY IMPRESSION OF WHERE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN? No. At the time, we really did think that what we were seeing were science fiction trailers. We didn't think we were seeing anything genuine. It wasn't until they came after and put us down in the van that we figured that maybe we seen something we shouldn't have seen. Human-Like with Tight Skull Cap TELL ME ABOUT ANOTHER CREATURE THAT YOU SAW? One that was very human like. START WITH THE TOP OF THE HEAD. WAS THERE HAIR? Couldn't tell. It had a skull cap on for lack of a better term. Tight fitting. The eyes were like Oriental-looking eyes, but everything else was like flesh tone."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Tall humanoid with slanted eyes wearing skull cap encountered by New Jersey adult female in an alleged abduction experience in 1987. Drawing by eyewitness. Source is Page 276, Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I: Facts & Eyewitneses © 1995 by Linda Moulton Howe. WERE YOU SEEING THIS BEING IN COLOR FILM? This being was in color film and once again had tight-fitting clothes. Only this was red and on the left there was some type of yellow insignia. HOW ARE YOU SEEING THIS BEING? ARE THEY ALIVE? ARE THEY DEAD? This one was standing up. This one was apparently carrying on a conversation. You couldn't see who it was carrying a conversation with. WAS THERE A MOUTH MOVING? There was a mouth moving. Their lips were much thinner than ours, but you could actually see the mouth moving. DID THE SKULL CAP HAVE A SHAPE TO IT? The skull cap came down to the nape of the neck. WHAT IS HAPPENING UP ON THE FOREHEAD? IS IT A PERFECT OVAL? No, not a perfect oval. It comes down to a point in the center. IT CAME LIKE A WIDOW'S PEAK SORT OF LOOK? I'm not familiar with that term. IT WAS A POINT THAT CAME DOWN IN THE FOREHEAD AND WENT BACK UP ON EITHER SIDE AROUND THE FACE? Ye s . WHAT WAS THE COLOR? The same as the uniform it had on. THE RED? Ye s . WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THE BEING'S SKIN? It was flesh tone like our own. THIS WAS IN COLOR FILM? Ye s . BUT THIS ONE YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS FLESH-COLORED FROM A CAUCASIAN POINT OF VIEW? Yes, a Caucasian point of view. But as far as the eyes went, the eyes looked Oriental since the eyes had a slant to them. CAN YOU REMEMBER IF THERE WAS A COLOR TO THE IRIS? I can't remember. I don't even know if we could have told that from the film from our vantage point."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"WAS THERE A NOSE? Don't remember much about the nose, but I'm certain it did have a nose. THE LIPS? The lips were thin, but you could tell it did have lips. AS THE MOUTH MOVED, DID YOU SEE ANY TEETH? Didn't see any teeth. That doesn't mean it didn't have teeth, it's just that I don't have any recollection of teeth being there. DID THE MOUTH MOVE AT THE SPEED THAT YOU THINK OF A HUMAN TALKING? This is going to sound strange, Linda, but it's like there was no emotions being expressed. It moved at normal conversational speed, but like it was talking in a trance state. THERE WERE NO FROWNS OR FACIAL MOTIONS THE WAY WE THINK OF A HUMAN TALKING? No, and the head when it would turn, it would turn very slowly. COULD YOU SEE ANY EARS OR BULGES OF EARS IN THIS SKULL CAP? To the best of my knowledge, no. DID THE SKULL CAP CONTINUE DOWN AROUND THE NECK? No, it ended right at the neck. It was a separate item as opposed to the suit. WERE YOU SEEING FLESH-COLORED NECK? It was flesh colored all the way down to where the suit began. WHERE DID THE SUIT BEGAN? The suit comes down around the neck. There was a little opening. I can't say if it was a V or not. IS THE SUIT LOOSE OR TIGHT LIKE A LEOTARD? This was tight like a leotard. Not as tight as the other one we just discussed on the small Grey. But this thing was tight. It was not loose fitting. COULD YOU SEE THE WHOLE BODY OF THIS BEING? Once again, this was from the torso up, from about where our belly button would be up. HOW FAR AWAY WAS THE CAMERA? The camera was close. The camera was very close. YOU WERE SEEING IN GOOD FILM CLOSE-UP FROM THE WAIST UP THIS ORIENTAL-LOOKING CAUCASIAN-SKINNED BEING WITH A TIGHT LEOTARD AND SKULL CAP THAT WAS A REDDISH COLOR. Correct. WAS THERE ANY GESTICULATION WITH THE ARMS AND HANDS? No. DID YOU SEE ANY ARMS AND HANDS? I may have, but I can't remember at this time. WAS THIS BEING TALKING RIGHT TO THE CAMERA? The head was moving left to right. And like I say, that's how we knew it was moving rather slow. WAS THE CAMERA RIGHT IN FRONT OF IT OR TO THE SIDE? It was like the camera was slightly off, I can't remember if to the right or left, but slightly off angle."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"THIS LASTED FOR ABOUT HOW LONG? That was one of the longest clips and I would say a duration of 6 or 7 seconds. White \"Marshmallow\" Being WHAT CAME AFTER THAT ONE? A black and white shot with another near-dead entity. And in this one, the head was about the size of ours, but it looked like marshmallow white. It was a white white. I can't say whether it had a uniform on or not because it was just that one solid color, period. White \"marshmallow-skinned\" beings encountered by logger, Travis Walton, on alien craft in 1975 after alleged abduction from Snowflake, Arizona. Drawing by Travis Walton in his book The Walton Experience © 1978. CAN YOU START WITH THE HEAD AND DESCRIBE THAT SHAPE? The head was kind of similar to our own. The body proportions from what we could tell were similar to a normal human being. The eyes was much larger than what our eyes are. Dark eyes. I don't remember any iris being there which is why we were thinking it was kind of strange. WHAT WAS THE SHAPE OF THOSE EYES? The shape was like almonds. WERE THEY SOLID THEN? Solid. On the film, they were solid black. EARS, NOSE, MOUTH? On this one, you had like two little slits on a close-up of the face, two little slits running up and down that you could take for a nose. The mouth - we couldn't make out a mouth. That doesn't mean there was no mouth there. You just couldn't make it out. EARS? To the best of my knowledge, I don't remember anything about the ears. WAS THIS WEARING ANYTHING? It was just a solid white. There was no distinction from where the entity might begin and some type of clothing began. IS IT STANDING? OR DEAD? OR? This was laying down, but apparently it had motion to it. So, I don't think that this one was dead. WHEN YOU SAY IT HAD MOTION TO IT? The head was moving a little. The arms were moving a little. But your next question is going to be about the fingers and stuff of this sort. No way I can tell that. YOU SAW AN ARM AND HAND THOUGH? Yes. But we weren't seeing that much detail."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"DID IT HAVE ANY RESEMBLANCE TO THE SANTILLI FILM DISSECTION AUTOPSY? No. Entity in 1969 Ft. Belvoir Film That Resembled 6-Fingered Humanoid in 1996 Santilli Film One of two humanoids with six fingers and six toes seen in alleged autopsy after a New Mexico military crash and retrieval of unidentified aerial craft. Film released by Ray Santilli of Merlin Productions, London, England © 1996 Orbital Media Ltd. Reprinted in Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness , Page 55, © 1998 by Linda Moulton Howe. There was one very similar to that in the Santilli film and you caught a glimpse of it. It had rolls like in the forehead. YOU MEAN LIKE THE FOREHEAD WAS FROWNING OR HAD WRINKLES? It had wrinkles at the forehead. YOU'RE SAYING THAT ONE OF THE CREATURES IN THE 1969 FILM LOOKED VERY SIMILAR TO THE SANTILLI CREATURE, BUT IT HAD WRINKLES IN THE FOREHEAD? Ye s . HOW CLOSE WAS THE CAMERA TO THAT ONE? The camera was right up on the face and pulls back. The camera had to be on a tripod because there was no apparent motion of someone holding the camera. Do you know what I'm saying? YEAH. IT WASN'T JIGGLY. IT'S LIKE A ZOOM FROM A TRIPOD. Correct. WHEN IT ZOOMED BACK, WHAT WAS THE CREATURE'S ENVIRONMENT? The creature's environment was a wooded area at that time. LYING ON? The one that looked like the Santilli film - it wasn't lying (down). It was standing. IT WAS STANDING ALIVE? It was standing. COULD YOU SEE THE WHOLE BODY? When it pulled back, it faded out and then went to shots of the saucers. When I first saw the Santilli film, the only word I could use was 'haunting' because it took me back to that particular scene in that film."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"THAT ONE IS ALIVE AND THE SKULL TYPE BEING IS ALIVE STANDING UP TALKING. THE SMALL GREY WITH THE CIGARETTE ASH SKIN IS LYING DOWN DEAD. AND THE ALL WHITE ONE IS LYING DOWN STILL ALIVE. Right, it's lying down, but there is motion. THE ONLY ONE THAT IS CLEARLY DEAD OR KNOCKED OUT IS THE FIRST ONE WE TALKED ABOUT WITH THE TRANSPARENT OR TRANSLUCENT LID OVER THE EYES? Correct. WERE THERE ANY OTHERS BESIDES THOSE FOUR? From those four, it then fades into the saucer shapes. It fades into various UFO shapes in flight.\" To be continued: Part 3 - Description of unidentified aerial craft in Ft.
