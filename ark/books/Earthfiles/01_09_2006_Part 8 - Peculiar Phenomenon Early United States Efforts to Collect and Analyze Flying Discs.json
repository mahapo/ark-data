Andrew Kissner Return to Crash in Juarez, Mexico, on May 29, 1947 he explosion at Mt. Franklin was witnessed by General Homer and reported by the El Paso Times the following day. That explosion occurred more than ten minutes before a second explosion at least twenty-five miles further south. General Homer dispatched troops to look for missile wreckage and investigate the first crash site ten to fifteen miles northwest of Ft. Bliss towards WSPG. [ Source: Ibid.] E l Paso Times , El Paso, Texas, May 30, 1947. My sources say it was America's first surface-to-air missile strike against an unidentified radar object (disc) - a target that was possibly crippled by the first explosion and continued to fly in airspace north of Ft. Bliss until it eventually impacted within one mile of the new Buena Vista Airport four miles south of downtown Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico, at 7:32 p.m. local time. Elapsed time of the total event was seventeen minutes "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Maximum engine burn time for either a V-2, or a modified Wasserfall, would not have exceeded three minutes. A three minute burn would have allowed either rocket to travel 125 miles. But the impact crater was 55 miles south of WSPG Launch Row, a distance that would have been covered by the May 15, 1947, \"Alamogordo V-2\" in slightly over five minutes after achieving an altitude of 80 miles. What caused this May 29, 1947, event to last for seventeen minutes ? [ Editor's Note: According to the White Sands Missile Range Museum, the Juarez, Mexico rocket crash was a \"modified V-2\" Hermes II: \"The V-2 rocket was the world's first large-scale rocket and was developed by Germany in WWII as a weapon. It had the capab ility of delivering a 2,000 pound warhead at supersonic speeds to target areas 150 miles away. The Germans fired a bout 3,600 V-2s at targets in England and on the continent during WWII. \"The architect of the rocket was Dr. Wernher von Braun who based much of his design on the pioneering work done by Dr. Robert Goddard during the 1930s near Roswell, N.M. In late 1945, 300 railroad freight cars of V-2 components captured in Europe arrived at White Sands. From 1946 to 1952, 67 V-2 rockets were fired here. The use of these rockets launched the United States into the Space Age. \"The V-2 provided the U.S. with valuable experience in the assembly, pre flight testing, handling, fueling, launching and tracking of large missiles. The scientific experiments conducted aboard the V-2 gave us new information about the upper atmosphere, gave us our first photographic look back at the earth from space, gave us the first large two-stage rocket and carried the first biological experiments into space. \"Also, an errant, highly modified V-2, referred to as Hermes II, crashed just outside Juarez, Mexico on May 29, 1947. No one was injured but the incident prompted White Sands to develop a safety program...\"] Left: Hermes A-1 (Wasserfall) surface-to-air missile. Right: V-2 rocket.

Photo provided by Andrew Kissner. he El Paso Times and The New York Times both wrote in their May 30, 1947, editions about the Juarez crash. Juarez eyewitnesses reported \"a blinding flash of light\" followed by a tremendous pressure wave, followed by the appearance of a mushroom cloud. The mushroom cloud excited local rumors that an atomic bomb had exploded. The concussion of the blast was sufficient to crack windows six miles north of the crash site, while an electric clock stopped, apparently due to some blast effect at the El Paso County Sheriff's Office. The ground shock generated by the explosion was felt 35 miles northwest of the impact crater. An American Airlines pilot landing at the El Paso Airport at 7:41 p.m. said that he saw \"the flames and smoke\" at his altitude. \"If I had been 30 seconds earlier, at the height I was flying, I would have been directly in its path.\" Whatever the object had been was not apparent - it was totally vaporized by the explosion. Small shreds of \"burned gray metal fused with molten sand and rock,\" were found around the 50' x 50' x 24' crater. There was no V-2 rocket body at the bottom of the hole. Strangely, there was nothing in the hole except dirt. What crashed and made the hole? MPs stationed at Ft. Bliss and other U. S. Army personnel from WSPG rushed across the border into Mexico in an attempt to secure the downed object. They were met at the crater by Mexican troops and summarily evicted. Mexico's General Enrique Diaz Gonzalez commanded the Juarez Garrison. Gen. Gonzalez placed Juarez off limits to U. S. Army personnel for several weeks after the explosion. The entire Juarez Garrison's rocket recovery efforts resulted in a small pile of debris that fit on top of a desk."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"F ront Page, El Paso Times , May 30, 1947, detonation crater in Juarez, Mexico, after May 29, 1947, WSPG launch. Two Mexican pilots landed their plane shortly before the object detonated. They reported seeing a flash of light that temporarily blinded them. The light was followed by a deafening explosion. Several spectators at the crash site were interviewed by a local reported. The eyewitnesses said they thought that a \"piece of the moon\" had fallen out of the sky. If this was the U. S. Army's first attempt to shoot down a flying disc, where did the disc go? There was no explanation ever given about why the launched \"V-2,\" or modified Wasserfall SAM missile (Hermes A-1), vaporized. Col. Turner at WSPG did not see the Juarez crash site, but he told the press: \"There were no explosive materials in V-2s. If any fuel had remained in the rocket, which was highly unlikely, it would have simply burned.\" But there was no fire in the crater. A brush fire started spontaneously by the heat of the explosion scorched the surrounding desert. [ Sources: El Paso Times and The New York Times , May 30, 1947.] An effective cover story was immediately provided to the press and public that another V-2 launched from White Sands Proving Ground had gone astray, experienced a total gyroscope failure, flew 180 degrees off course and crashed in Mexico. Interestingly, the Technical Director at WSPG and spokesman for the V-2 program, Herbert Karsh, immediately left WSPG due to a \"family illness\" after it was a nnounced that a V-2 had gone off course into Mexico. In addition, Col. Turner immediately left for Washington, D. C. and did not reschedule is return to WSPG until June 9, 1947. It was never learned what the security detail dispatched by General Homer found at the site of the first explosion on the west side of the Franklin Mountains east of Anthony, New Mexico - twelve minutes before the explosion in Mexico. Three days after the Juarez crash, the editor of the Las Cruces Sun-News reported that he and his neighbors were eyewitnesses to part of the event: \"We were caught in an undesirable circumstance Thursday night when just by chance, we looked toward the Organ Mountains in time to see the 'modified"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"V-2' rocket that caused so much excitement a few moments later by landing near Juarez, Mexico, climb into the air. It seemed to slant a little to the south, in contrast to the normal almost vertical flight path. \"The vapor trail a V-2 leaves gives the rocket a 'toy' sky rocket appearance for a few seconds. Then the vapor trail ended, but in the gathering dusk, the orange colored exhaust could be seen and followed for a long time. The rocket climbed high, almost straight up until it seemed to be nearly over Las Cruces - actually, it was many miles east of the city - then turned to the south.'\" Perhaps that turn to the south was because the launched rocket was a modified Wasserfall SAM missile in the Hermes program, which unlike V-2 rockets, were remotely steered to their targets by a ground crew after launch. The Las Cruces Sun-News editor continued: \"At that instant, as the rocket, its exhaust resembling another bright star, drifted past two first magnitude stars and the moon, we realized something was wrong, that a news story of top importance was in the making. We weren't alone in seeing it. Dozens near our residence could be heard shouting to members of their families and friends to come out and see the rocket. \"We were wrong about one thing, however. The long period (comparatively) we could see the exhaust of the rocket made us believe a new type of missile was being tested, not a V-2 which burns less than 70 seconds. Since details of the rocket's construction are secret, however, it is possible some American alterations to the German V-2 make for a longer burning period and consequently, a greater range. \"We aren't making any apologies for the Army - it can usually take care of itself, but the fact that two V-2s have gone astray recently (May 15 and May 29, 1947) is no reason to condemn the guided missile program or to worry over the possibility that one of them may land in Las Cruces. In the first place, firings are watched carefully and malfunctions are usually noticed almost immediately.\" [ Source: Las Cruces Sun-News , June 1, 1947.] According to the Astronomy Department at New Mexico State University, the sun went down on May 29, 1947, at 7:06 p.m. local time. So the western sky would st ill be bright at 7:16 p.m. when the Las Cruces Sun-News editor said he saw \"two first magnitude stars.\" His eyewitness observation is about one month before the national headlines that pilot Kenneth Arnold saw \"flying saucers\" on June 24, 1947, and others saw them in northwestern New Mexico. The two New Mexico Navajo reservation eyewitnesses also thought they were seeing a star, but it was broad daylight. Then after watching the \"star\" for awhile, it began moving and disappeared over the horizon to the southeast, proving it was not a star."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"F ront page story, The New York Times , May 30, 1947.
