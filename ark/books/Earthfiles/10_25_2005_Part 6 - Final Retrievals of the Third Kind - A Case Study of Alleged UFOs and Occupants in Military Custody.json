Here begins Part 6 of Status Report I, written July 29, 1978. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report II begins at Earthfiles. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. For all the previous status reports, see Earthfiles Archives. Leonard H. Stringfield: Completion of Status Report I , Final Summary and Conclusion. \"Still another factor that has raised some questions is a bout the geographical location of UFO crashes. In the United States, especially in the 1950s, crashes have mainly been reported in the western or southwestern desert regions where military experimental installations abound. Logically, one might ask: Is the flying saucer a super secret U. S. weapon? But the negative answers are overwhe lming. As point out earlier, UFO crashes have occurred on foreign soil beyond the range of the U. S. experimental aircraft. And, as known to all research, UFOs have repeatedly reconnoitered U. S. and foreign military installations and other sensitive areas where they sometimes act in a menacing manner. On the premise that humanoid aliens have been preserved in deep freeze conditions at Wright-Patterson AFB and at several medical centers for research, I believe it is safe to postulate that these entities associated with the UFO are physical and are not an apparition from another dimension. My point here is not to derogate the extra- dimensional entity, for there is much evidence to suggest that it, too, plays a part in the UFO mystery. It is beyond the scope of this paper to rationalize each and every kind of alien intruder during a live encounter. This subject belongs to my colleague, Ted Bloecher, who has made a scholarly study of this phase of research. In summary, the information treated in this paper, while it might seem provocative to the media and to the average researcher, does not, admittedly, constitute the final proof that UFOs are of extraterrestrial origin. But, indeed, if my data from reliable and diverse sources are received with an objective and unbiased mind, then the hypothesis surely is strengthened. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"It seems no matter how hard we might want to disbelieve the data presented in the foregoing abstracts, it will be difficult to explain away the correlative physical similarities of the recovered humanoids. Despite my long experience in UFO research, I must admit that I feel a sense of human uneasiness as vital data continue to reach me from responsible sources. As the pieces of the puzzle suddenly fall into place for me, each a corroborative clue, I realize - like a smack in the face - that our giant Intelligence community, both military and covert agencies, have been sitting atop a real Pa ndora's Box with some righteous cause. I am not condoning our Inte lligence forces for their harsh and tricky actions or methods in suppressing the hidden facts for so many years, but I can now appreciate the problem they might have had in trying to find a reasonable way out of a dilemma to relate all the sobering data to a benighted world public. How would the public react to a sudden official disclosure of even the scantest details relevant to the humanoid which I have released in this paper? And, the humanoid factor is just a small segment in the overall sobering UFO data. And, there is st ill another sensitive aspect to consider: The intent of the UFO! It is my belief that our Intelligence community does not know the intent of the UFO. For our government to suddenly release only the known data in a major pronouncement could pose some new social risks. In my opinion, to release part of the UFO story, and be unable to define the UFO's intent could create an even greater concern in the unpredictable public mind. Perhaps the human mind is ready to hear the truth. Our minds have survived in many hot wars and a long cold war with the threat of nuclear destruction, plus all the social upheavals of the late 1960s and 1970s. I believe we are ready for the truth. Who are these mortals whose imperfect craft have crashed into the foreign soil of Earth? From what star system do they come where evolutionary life is not too different than our Earth's? Is there a missing link in our primeval pasts, or lost in our archaeological wonders which might reveal a human kinship? I do not profess to know the locked away secrets, or the final answer to the UFO mystery, nor do I know what other great secrets might be hidden away with the alleged retrieved craft and deceased aliens. Perhaps, President Jimmy Carter knows these secrets, or some of them. Thus, my plea, here and now, is addressed to the President of the United States to seriously review the testimony I have recorded in this paper. With his conscience as his guide, I trust that the President of the United States will tell this great nation and the world the truth about the greatest story of our time.\" Leonard H.
