In wheat, a \"Medicine Wheel\" depicted in upper left corner of diagram below which measured 70 feet in diameter with 5 feet wide inner spokes. There was also a ringed circle 82 feet in diameter. The formation was cut straight across at the edge of the field as shown in the diagram. Fourteen days later on September 20, the two smaller circle shown in the black and white diagram below were added. Their diameters were six feet and nine feet. All of the patterns that appeared September 6 and 20 were swirled counterclockwise. Measurements by Robert Leselie. In original diagram, bottom circle and ring slightly cut off. 11) Early September North of Midale, Saskatchewan, Canada. Wheat and Alfalfa. Three circles in straight line with diameters of 18 feet, 18 feet and 14 feet. 12) September 14 One Mile East of Midale, Saskatchewan, Canada. Wheat. Ring 125 feet in diameter in same field with 50 foot diameter circle surrounded by two rings. 13) September 20 South of Midale, Saskatchewan, Canada. Wheat. Two circles six and nine feet in diameter appear in te same field south of Midale as shown in September 6 Diagram above. 14) September 21 Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Within city limits. Barley heavily infested with thistle. Longest length 191 feet. See photographs and interview below with researcher and surveyor, Judy Arndt."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"15) September 26 Midale, Saskatchewan, Canada. Wheat. Flattened circle irregularly shaped 63 feet in diameter one way and 59 feet diameter another. Inside was a circle of standing crop, 6 feet in diameter and twenty feet from the flattened perimeter. Interview: Researcher and surveyor Judy Arndt talked with me the day after she and her husband traveled to the formation of seven circles discovered within the Edmonton, Alberta city limits on September 21st. The farmer did not want the specific location made public. The crop is barley heavily infested with thistles which Judy said were quite painful to walk through and made the survey very difficult. Formation in thistle-infested barley discovered September 21, 1999 near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Photograph © 1999 by Judy Arndt. Judy Arndt, Graphics and Web Designer and Crop Circle Investigator, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada: \"The central circle is 100 foot diameter and there are two slightly overlapping smaller circles coming off the north, sort of an"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"appendage. There is a 36-foot diameter circle. And attached to that a 19-foot diameter circle. Now on the south end is almost the mirror image of that sort of slightly south, southeast a 33 foot diameter circle and another 19 foot diameter circle attached to that. So the whole thing looks like an S-curve through the (large circle). There are two satellite circles on either side on the other axis and they are each 33 feet in diameter. There is only about 2 feet of standing crop between the satellite circles and the big circle. HOW WOULD YOU COMPARE THIS CROP LAY TO EARLIER FORMATIONS? The lay in every one of these circles is radial that is, it's splayed out from the center to the perimeter. THERE IS NOT A TWIST TO IT? IT' IS STRAIGHT? That's right. This is barley and very strange it looks like there has been a huge amount of energy to lay this down this way. And the thistle is tough and it's laid right down, too, although there are some standing tufts there. It looks so messy. But when you get down and look at what's under the thistle and under the heads, there is all this crop laying right close to the ground. YOU SAID THE ACADIA CIRCLE HAD A FLAT LAY, BUT WITH ALL THOSE SINGLE STANDING STEMS? Ye s . WOULD THIS ONE NOW (EDMONTON) BE SLOPPIER LOOKING THAN THE LARGE ACADIA ONE? In Acadia Valley the standing stems were completely upright as though they weren't leaning over. A lot of the standing crop in this one (Edmonton) is not standing way up. It's leaning slightly. I would say it's not as good condition, not standing as tall as the stuff in Acadia Valley. SINCE IT LOOKS SO SLOPPY, IS THE QUICK JUDGMENT TO DISMISS IT AS SOME KIND OF HOAX? I think a lot of people have dismissed it as a hoax. But, I should also mention that there is an extremely high percentage of very elongated nodes in the barley. There's some wild oats in there and a lot of expulsion cavities in the nodes of the wild oats.

We haven't done that thorough a search of all the nodes yet, but generally they are just elongated. They are kind of thinned and darkened and elongated. HOW WOULD YOU COMPARE THE NODES BETWEEN ACADIA VALLEY AND EDMONTON? The Acadia ones were quite blown out laterally. This (Edmonton) was more just stretched and often thinned out, too. They appear like a rubber band when it's stretched and gets thinner. And in terms of difficulty, the thistles were thick and I would say it would be very difficult to do this formation because it was all laid out radially. And how do you leave all these little tufts even if you were trying to do it by hand? And anybody would have seen something happening, some vandalism in the field, I would think. BECAUSE IT'S SO CLOSE TO AN URBAN CENTER? Ye a h . IT' IS SURROUNDED BY HOUSES? There are major roads on two sides of that quarter and there are acreages along one side of it and some woods on the other side. There is constant traffic on two sides of it. SO THE MOST OUTSTANDING ANOMALIES ARE THE RADIAL LAY IN EACH OF THE CIRCLES AND THE FACT THAT IT''S IN THISTLE AND THAT UNDERNEATH THE THISTLE AND SOME OF THE PLANTS STANDING LOOSELY, THE REST OF IT WAS LAYING VERY FLAT TO THE GROUND? That's right. It wasn't all perfectly radial. Once in awhile we found a strip of crop coming back the other direction, the opposite direction. And then sometimes there would be a piece that almost looked like a straight part in hair with plants going 180 degrees away from each other. When you look at the center of one of these circles, it's like if you put a blow dryer on your hair when you're drying your hair and it all splays out in all directions - it just seems like something has energy that came from the center and blew everything out to the sides. One more thing I need to tell you about the Edmonton formation. In the center of the northern most circle - that's one of the small ones - there was a hole. If you imagine a tetrahedron upside down - that is four triangles making a 3-sided pyramid. This one is about six by five inches on each side. And we had a small stick there and I stuck a stick down the hole and there is loose soil down the center for eighteen inches, as though there was a pole or lightning or something has gone down. Three sort of splits in the soil in three directions from this. There was a head of barley, beards down in the loose soil in the center of this thing. So, it looked to us like the plant had fallen in there and some soil had fallen in on top of it. It would be interesting to dig down there and see if something iron is there or inserted there. I'll try to get soil samples for the BLT Research Team. HAD ANYONE SEEN ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN THE SKY? No, but around the time the formation appeared, the woman herself saw something unusual about 6 miles north. She said one night, she and her husband were driving and there was this brilliant white light in front of them. It just filled their whole field of vision and then was gone.\" We b s it e s : 1) Judy Arndt's Web Site: http://www.CropCircleQuest.com/ 2) Paul Anderson, Director, Canadian Crop Circle Research Network (CCCRN)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"http://www.geocities.com/cropcirclecanada 3) Largest Crop Circle Archive: http://www.cropcircleconnector.com Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
