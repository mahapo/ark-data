Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Extraterrestrial Biological Entities and Discs Described by CIA/U.S. Army Administrator, 1957-1960 Â© 2002 by Linda Moulton Howe October 9, 2002 - My book, Glimpses of Other Realities, Volume II - High Strangeness , first released in April 1998, has a large \"Military Voices\" chapter which contains firsthand military and intelligence accounts, drawings and documents about extraterrestrial biological entities (Ebens) and non-human entities (NHEs) from origins unknown. See Earthfiles Shop. Within weeks, several ex-military and ex-intelligence people from around the country contacted me in various ways. Repeatedly, I was told that the documents and testimonies in \"Military Voices\" have true information about United States government knowledge and cover-up of non-humans interacting with earth. One of those calls was from a relative of a retired Army and CIA administrator. A copy of my book was sent to him and by early May 1998, I was put in phone contact with a man I will call \"Kewper\" at his request to protect his identity. Kewper served as a First Lieutenant with the U. S. Army Signal Corps and was a CIA administrator at an Army base in the southeastern United States from 1957 to 1960. He provided his DD-214 and Certificate of Discharge along with a 1956 newspaper article about his being drafted. His civilian name and Army Signal Corp base of operations were consistent with the Army discharge papers which he showed me in a face-to-face meeting where he resided. I would name the Army base, but as you read further in the interview excerpt below, you will see that Kewper was asked by government watch dogs to withhold that information in order to protect current CIA sensitive and classified operations out of the same base in 1998. Back in the 1957 to 1960 period, Kewper taught radio operations and cryptography to Army Signal Corps officers under a false identification assigned to him by the CIA, for which he also worked. The head of that Signal Corps school had worked for the OSS during World War II. The OSS was the Office of Strategic Services which became the Central Intelligence Agency in 1947. In addition to teaching, Kewper's CIA boss at the Army base asked Kewper to help analyze Top Secret cases gathered for the Air Force's Project Blue Book investigation of unidentified flying objects. Even though the public and media were later told there was nothing to UFOs and the Air Force was not interested, Kewper said the truth was that highly sensitive and unexplained Blue Book case files were gathered in Washington, D. C., sent to Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and then re-routed to different CIA field offices for further study. One of those CIA analysis centers was the Army base in which Kewper and his boss worked with cryptography and radio operations. Kewper traveled with his CIA boss to the Papoose Mountain range on the edge of Groom Lake, Area 51, Nellis AFB, Nevada, in August 1958. There, with his boss and three other CIA agents, Kewper toured with a USAF Colonel identified only as Jim to see disc craft inside a small mountain and a living, telepathic \"extraterrestrial biological entity\" dressed in human civilian clothing to be more psychologically acceptable, Kewper thought. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"When I first talked with Kewper, he said his security oaths expired 30 to 35 years after he got out of the Army and CIA in 1960. That period ended around 1995, so Kewper said he felt he was not doing anything wrong by discussing with me his extraordinary firsthand knowledge and experiences concerning \"extraterrestrials,\" the word used to describe them in Top Secret classified files Kewper read and analyzed. On Saturday, May 30, 1998, I called him to ask if he might be willing to do a radio interview, as long as his real civilian name and location were withheld. Kewper surprised me when he immediately said, 'I'm afraid your phone is tapped.' He had received a call on Monday, May 25, from a man who did not explain who he was, who he worked for and did not address Kewper by name. The caller simply started talking, reminding Kewper of his \"patriotic American duty\" to his military past and warned him not to talk with \"somebody in Pennsylvania\" which we assumed was me. Kewper wanted to file a police report for a harassing phone call and went to a friend of his at the phone company to see if there was a record of the call. His phone company friend found that the source of the call had been the Wackenhut Corp., but when he went to his supervisor to get authorization to have a printout made, the data containing the Wackenhut name had been mysteriously deleted in the phone company's call records. Wackenhut has long been a provider of security operations for a variety of U. S. intelligence agencies, including the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). This is what Kewper told me on the record under the condition that I edit out subjects that the unidentified caller said were still sensitive. Those edits are indicated in the following interview first broadcast on the North American syndicated radio programs, Dreamland , on May 31, 1998, and Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell the night of June 1-2, 1998. Interview: \"Kewper,\" Retired Former U. S. Army Signal Corps Cryptographer and CIA Administrator: YOU ANSWERED THE PHONE AND THEY SAID...? They didn't say my name, but just said, 'We understand that you had a conversation with somebody in Pennsylvania in regards to classified materials that had been classified and we would appreciate it if you didn't bring up the fact in an interview or television interviews in regard to (Army base name deleted) and that you had mentioned on the telephone and also about anything going on in the (CIA aerial logistics deleted) or anything regard to that. We would really appreciate it because reporters and just interested people - if it gets aired may try to get into the classified area there. And of course, to their own physical harm. THEY DID NOT SAY THAT YOU COULD NOT TALK ABOUT SEEING CLASSIFIED FILMS OF CRAFT AND HUMANOIDS? No, that is not what they specified I shouldn't talk about. They were very concerned about the name of the military base getting out because it is still used for highly sensitive CIA-related matters today. AT THAT BASE, YOU WERE ASSIGNED TO STUDY PHOTOGRAPHS, DRAWINGS AND FILM OF UNIDENTIFIED CRAFT AND BEINGS? Yes. At least we were one of the groups investigating the unexplained. I know when they closed down Project Blue Book, they said they had found very little that wasn't explained. And that was actually true because anything they didn't explain would be sent to Ft. Belvoir in Virginia and then farmed out from there"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"to other military or - the FBI was involved with some of the things, too. I know, because FBI would show up on some of these peoples' doorsteps. WERE THE FBI SOME OF THE ALLEGED MEN IN BLACK? Yeah, I think so, at least in some instances. WHAT WERE THE YEARS THAT YOU WERE PERSONALLY WORKING IN THE CIA AND HANDLING THESE HIGHLY CLASSIFIED REPORTS RELATED TO THE UFO PHENOMENON? 1957-1960. I was in the service starting in 1956, but I didn't get involved with the CIA in the first year. YOUR RANK WAS WHAT AND IN WHICH MILITARY BRANCH? I was in the Army and a 1st Lieutenant. I was still actually in the Army Signal Corps, but I also worked for the CIA, too, because I was getting two paychecks. I was getting one from the CIA and one from military service. IN THE COURSE OF THIS WORK FROM 1957 TO 1960, DID YOU SEE ANY 16MM FILMS RELATED TO THIS PHENOMENON? We saw several at that time which were highly classified UFO sightings and film. We had one film showing a UFO actually developing or materializing over a power plant out in one of the western states, like Oregon or Washington or Utah - somewhere out in that area. YOU MEAN SOMEONE JUST HAPPENED TO BE FILMING? Yes. Someone was trying a brand new camera and they were filming this power plant. And first the mountainous areas around and then they were over to this power plant. And then the power plant had like a smoke stack and had some smoke going on up. And right a little ways a way from where the smoke was going up, we started seeing like little white round - like a little piece of a cloud. And it got more and more dense. And more and more round. And pretty soon you could see like little tiny windows around the bottom section. I'm just using windows as a term loosely. And it developed more and more and pretty soon it looked real silver and pretty soon it started flying off by itself slowly. SO YOU HAD ON FILM IN CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY WORK WHAT APPEARED TO BE A HARD SILVER DISC THAT LITERALLY JUST EMERGED FROM WHAT LOOKED LIKE A VAPOROUS CLOUD. Yes. Just a little ways from a cloud emitted by the smokestack. So we thought at that time that these aliens must have some way of like materializing or traveling from one area to another and materializing and by using the current that was down in the power plant some how to change the electric currents that were down there and change it into something electromagnetic or something solid like solid material. They just announced it as something that we have that we cannot explain and we'd like to have you take a look at this - your group - just one of the unexplainable things. And they said, too, that you may get calls from people who had witnessed this (materialization in the sky) and this is hard evidence film of such an actual happening. WHAT HAPPENED TO BRING YOU CLOSE-UP WITH A GREY BEING? My CIA boss and I went to Area 51 in August 1958. We were out there for a meeting of all the CIA people around this country and over toward the Far East and so on, and we had the meeting there at Area 51. We were involved with this Project Blue Book thing and they wanted the meeting there with some of us involved directly with the Blue Book project. There were only 5 of us that went from (name of Army base deleted) and we were the only 5 that had meetings right inside a little base they had there in a small mountain."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"AT NELLIS AFB IN NEVADA. Yes. But we went out to Groom Lake Area and the two areas they had out there, they showed it to us, but only to us and not to the CIA people that were in from the Far East or from Central America. They didn't go out there. Only the 5 of us. And we landed at Area 51 at the main landing strip. Then we got into a van type of small mini-bus. And after that, we didn't stop to get into any other buildings there. They took us down about 10 miles away, something of that nature, and stopped at the first special area. And they did take us into the area where they had U-2s and we also had the SR-71 Blackbirds. And I believe they were flying them at that time. We were there a short period of time and then we got back on the bus and went another about 8 miles to the third and final area where they had highly classified material. We stopped there and went into like an office area first and then a Colonel there met us and took us on a tour. He took us first of all down a walkway into a hangar area that had been carved out - it might have been a natural cave to start out with - but at least it was carved out of the mountain side area. (Papoose Mountain range.) THIS IS A USAF COLONEL WHO IS JOINING YOU AND YOUR CIA BOSS AND THREE OTHER CIA MEN IN YOUR PROGRAM? Ye s . WERE THERE ONLY SIX OF YOU? Yes. As we passed through different areas naturally, there were other workers and scientists working on different things and office personnel. DID YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THE REASON WAS THAT YOUR BOSS WAS HAVING YOU GO TO HAVE THIS TOUR BY THIS COLONEL? Yes. They wanted us to see the craft so when we looked at pictures and tried to identify fake pictures from the real thing, this would be a help to us. That was the main reason why we were toured through the area to see the different types of craft so we could pick out the (hoaxed) 'garbage can covers' from the real craft. DO YOU REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE COLONEL? Just his first name that was on his name tag and it was 'Jim.' WHY HE WOULD HAVE HAD ONLY ONE NAME ON THERE? Because apparently he was guarding his real identity just like most of us did. Jim was probably not even his real first name, most likely. THE NAME ON YOUR NAME TAG WAS NOT YOUR REAL CIVILIAN NAME? No, I had a separate name for when I got into the CIA and a separate name tag and a picture ID tag from the CIA with my picture on it and name. BUT YOU WERE NEVER WORKING UNDER YOUR REAL NAME - YOU WERE ALWAYS WORKING UNDER AN ASSIGNED NAME BY THE CIA? Yes, I was working under an assigned name. SO THE 6 OF YOU - THE COLONEL AND YOUR CIA BOSS AND YOURSELF AND THESE THREE OTHER CIA MEN INVOLVED IN THIS PROJECT - YOU'RE LITERALLY WALKING INTO A CARVED OUT AREA OF A MOUNTAIN? Ye s . CAN YOU DESCRIBE EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAW?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"As soon as we got in, the first thing we did see was two small craft. WHAT COLOR WERE THEY? They were the silver, kind of a silver finish to them - not real shiny and bright but basically silver. WHAT WAS THE DIAMETER? About 18 or 20 feet - they were quite small. Drawing Â© September 1998 by \"Kewper\" of one among several disc craft he saw inside part of the Papoose Mountain range (S-4) near Groom Lake, Area 51, Nellis AFB, Nevada, during his visit as a U.S. Army and CIA Administrator in August 1958. WERE YOU ALLOWED TO GO OVER AND TOUCH THEM? No, we were on a walkway area and couldn't get down over to where the crafts were actually sitting. HOW MANY OTHERS COULD YOU SEE? At least about seven, I think. There were some larger ones in the rear towards the end that we could see that were probably 50-60 feet in diameter. WERE ANY DIFFERENT FROM ANOTHER? They were all disk-shaped, but some had larger bottom areas that extended down the same distance as they extended to the top. And they were in different colors. The larger ones in the rear were a real deep, real dark grey color. Some of the other ones were lighter in color, but maybe like a light or medium brown type of thing. The larger ones in the rear had real large top units and large bottom units to them and were sitting on like metal saw horses to hold them up off the ground. DID THE USAF COLONEL TRY TO EXPLAIN - OR DID HE HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE PROPULSION SYSTEM OF THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFT? That question was asked and they mentioned it was electromagnetic/anti- gravitational type engines. But they had other propulsion systems also. Apparently they were like anti-matter propulsion on one of the units, something of that nature. And I saw they tried to reverse-engineer (one craft) so part of the craft was taken apart. And they were trying to figure out how it works and they were explaining to us that there really was no physical motor in that thing. The entire (disc) was like an electronic circuit and the aliens had to be inside of this disc to complete"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"the electronic circuit to make it fly. (The Area 51 people) knew that because they had tried to make that one fly. They were just like a battery electrical unit. And it worked with anti-gravitational electromagnetic drive, but the whole saucer itself was like the drive of the ship. And it was all coated with nickel inside and it was like a giant circuit, electronic circuit. And it took the aliens to complete the circuit because they were tied right in with it and they had headbands they wore that had detectors. And they had finger-type board control where they could fly the craft. THOSE ARE THE HAND-IMPRINTED 6-FINGERED CONTROL PANELS THAT WERE WITH THAT AUTOPSY FILM (1995 Ray Santilli)? Ye s . THEY SHOWED THOSE PANELS? Ye s . DID YOU SEE THE PANELS THEMSELVES ACTUALLY THERE WITH THE CRAFT? Yes. They were there with the craft. They were trying to figure out the electronic circuitry because there was no wiring of any kind that they could see. But later on, they found out that when they had it at Groom Lake, they had a couple of scientists there and these scientists used microscopes to check over the fingertip control harnessing and they found little fibers going out from it. They used microscopes to see that and they found out then it was a fiber optic type of electrical transmissions throughout the craft. ALL DONE WITH LIGHT. Yes, it was light. The craft inside - the report I read originally - that when they looked inside the craft, the craft was glowing with a real thin light inside from all the circuitry fiber optics. Reverse-engineering of that is apparently where we got fiber optics technology from. WHAT IS THE COLONEL SAYING TO YOU ABOUT THESE DISCS IN RELATIONSHIP TO WHERE YOU'RE GOING NEXT? He just stated that these are some of the craft we have picked up and captured in different parts of the world. Apparently some of them were even brought in from overseas from some point or other, but I gathered that most were captured within the U. S. He just mentioned that we were going back out to the general office area and other smaller hangar area to see the being, this extraterrestrial being, they had there at that time. Visiting A Grey-Skinned Extraterrestrial Biological Entity (Eben)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Drawing Â© 1998 by \"Kewper\" of what the U.S. Air Force Colonel introduced to the CIA group as an \"extraterrestrial biological entity\"working at a disk behind a one-way mirror/window inside small mountain (S-4) near Groom Lake, Area 51, Nellis AFB, Nevada in August 1958. We went from the hangar area where the saucers were, out to a covered walkway area, into what I would call an office complex because it was a bunch of small rooms and offices. There they had a special room for viewing that had one-way windows in it, one-way mirrors, rather, and we could look through the window into this small office where the being was in there. He was not able to see us through the mirror because there was a mirror on his side. WHAT HAPPENED? They did tell us that the being spoke like telepathically and the other four people went in the being's room to try communicating. YOUR BOSS, THE THREE OTHER CIA GUYS AND THE COL. JIM? Ye s . YOU'RE WATCHING FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ONE-WAY MIRROR. WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER ABOUT THE BEING? The being was, I think, what the Colonel called him was a 'Grey.' He had the large head and bigger eyes, kind of slanted bigger eyes - he looked like he was wearing sunglasses because the lenses were real dark. And kind of a slim face down to a peaked chin with just a little nose area and a tiny slit of a mouth and just holes in the side of his head for ear openings. ABOUT HOW TALL? About five feet, something like that. WHAT WAS THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN LIKE IN COLOR AND TEXTURE? It was greyish-looking, but it looked fairly course - not like the smoothness of our skin, from looking through the window. It looked almost like a canvas or something, graininess, not real smooth like our skin would be. The color was a medium grey. COULD YOU SEE THE HANDS? No, I didn't because first of all, the being had his hands and arms behind his back, kind of walking back and forth behind a little desk area. There was a chair"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"for him to sit down and he did sit down later on. But, I never did see his hands, so I don't know how many fingers he had. COULD YOU SEE ITS FEET AND WAS IT WEARING ANY CLOTHES? I would classify it as civilian clothes. I never saw his feet so I don't know if he had on shoes or his own feet or just what. AND YOU COULDN'T SEE THE FEET BECAUSE? Because he was behind this desk area and all I could see was from above his knees on up. WAS YOUR IMPRESSION THAT THEY HAD JUST SORT OF PUT THIS ON THE BEING IN ORDER TO MEET THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE? Probably. I would say so. WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN YOUR BOSS AND THE THREE CIA GUYS AND COLONEL JIM IN THAT ROOM COMMUNICATING WITH THE BEING? They questioned - my boss did ask him what he was doing here? And why do you come here? And this type of thing, and the only answer he had gotten was, 'We are not here to conquer the earth. We're not here to destroy anything. We are here to add, like knowledge to humans and so on, so they can gain more knowledge in different areas.' DID YOUR BOSS AND THE OTHER MEN EXPLAIN HOW THAT TELEPATHIC PROCESS WENT? They said they definitely weren't hearing a thing through their ears and that the voice more or less they heard was right in the mind itself. They could put their fingers in their ears and they would still hear the being - one tried that. He plugged both ears to see if he could still hear the being and he could. WHAT WAS THE SOUND OF THE BEING IN THEIR MINDS? My boss said the voice almost sounded like an electronically reproduced voice DID SOMEONE EXPLAIN WHY THIS BEING WAS EVEN BEING KEPT THERE? No, they wouldn't tell us why he was kept there, how long he had been there or anything like that. They wouldn't - I think one of the answers was, \"We can't talk about that,\" I believe was the main answer. DID THIS COLONEL TALK ABOUT WHETHER THESE BEINGS WERE CONSIDERED ANY KIND OF A THREAT? No, they didn't really consider it like a big threat - but there was always like, 'We don't know for sure, but we don't think that they are going to be harmful to us, but we don't really know for sure. We can't say for sure that they are not trying to invade or checking us all out and checking out our military.' Because even at that time, the saucer sightings were always around classified areas and any military bases, that type of thing. So, it looked almost like they were scouting. BY THE TIME YOU LEFT THE ARMY SIGNAL CORP AND CIA IN 1960, DID YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER BRIEFINGS ABOUT THE BEINGS AND WERE THEY REFERRED TO AS EXTRATERRESTRIALS? Yes, they were referred to as extraterrestrials. Most of the time they referred to the one out there as a \"Grey.\" THE ONE AT AREA 51? Yes, they just referred to it as a \"Grey.\""},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"WHY DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT TOLD THE UNITED STATES PUBLIC, MEDIA AND THE WORLD WHAT THEY KNOW? You would think they would by now. But I know at the same time through the Cold War era back in the 1950s - I was involved with it - the CIA in a lot of cases in regards to this unidentified flying objects - did contact and work with even the Russians during that time of the Cold War to see what they had because the Russians had contacted us in regards to UFOs because they had UFO sightings also. And they contacted us because they thought it might be some kind of advanced flying craft that we had and they were calling us to warn us to keep them out of their area... because th ey thought they were our craft. And we told them they were not ours. IF RUSSIA AND THE UNITED STATES WERE SECRETLY TRYING TO TALK WITH EACH OTHER ABOUT AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL PRESENCE, DID YOU EVER HAVE ANY FURTHER INFORMATION OVER THE LAST 40 YEARS ABOUT WHAT OUR GOVERNMENT'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE AGENDA OR INTENT OF THESE BEINGS IS BY NOW? I know that we have - they have worked together with Russia on this, especially since the Gorbachev thing and we became more friendly. And that Russia is involved with particle beam weapons, too, from satellite and from ground - we had actually given them the particle beam thing to be able to like shoot down any of the saucer craft. BUT WHY WOULD WE TRY TO SHOOT DOWN CRAFT IF WE PERCEIVED THESE BEINGS TO BE BENEVOLENT? Well, it could be something that happened since that time I was involved. DID YOU EVER SEE ANY REFERENCES TO ANIMAL MUTILATIONS OR UNUSUAL DEATHS? Yes. At that time, we had it out in Colorado, I think - I saw some of those. And they were apparently different parts of the animal were taken like samples - the stomachs in some, sex organs in others - and various parts and apparently mutilated with a laser weapon of some kind that left very precise cutting edges. DID YOU READ ABOUT ANY SUCH CASES IN THAT 1957-1960 TIME PERIOD? Yes, especially from Colorado. EVEN BACK THEN? Ye s . DO YOU THINK THAT THIS STORY SHOULD BE TOLD IN ITS ENTIRETY TODAY? Yes, I think it should. We still have a lot of sightings to this day and age. THIS IS WHY YOU'RE TALKING TO ME? Ye s . \" After this audio taped interview was broadcast, I made arrangements to visit Kewper privately at his residence to see documents and other materials related to his military work and civilian life afterward. He talked several hours on the record and agreed to go another step to work with me on videotape. We tentatively outlined how that would be accomplished and I returned to Philadelphia to organize a camera shoot with Kewper. One week before we were scheduled to meet again, Kewper called to say that he had been approached in a supermarket parking lot by two men who warned him specifically not to talk with \"Linda Howe\" any more. The same men showed up"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"two more times, expanding their threat to include Kewper's son. It might have been toothless intimidation efforts, but Kewper became so upset he told he he could not go forward with the videotaping at that time. More Information: SOM1-01 document that first emerged in 1994 on 35mm negatives which were studied by aerospace engineer, Bob Wood, and his son, Ryan, in order to produce the \"clean copy\" shown here from their investigations of government knowledge and cover-up. A document reprinted in Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness is entitled \"Restricted SOM1-01 Majestic-12 Group Special Operations Manual: Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology, Recovery and Disposal TOP SECRET/MAJIC EYES ONLY\" and dated April 7, 1954, with a War Department seal. A copy of this manual emerged in 1994 when don Berliner, member of the Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR) based in Mt. Rainier, Maryland, received a green box used to ship film and photographs and postmarked March 7, 1994 from a La Cross, Wisconsin pharmacy. Sender unknown. Inside were 35mm negatives of this SOM1-01 training manual. Later aerospace engineer, Bob Wood, and his son Ryan, studied the photographs and produced the \"clean copy\" above in their investigations of government knowledge and cover-up. Page 363 of my book has a reprint of the document's page labeled \"Description of Craft\" that states the following: \"Documented extraterrestrial craft (UFOBs) are classified in one of four categories based on general shape, as follows: a. Elliptical, or disc shape. This type of craft is of a metallic construction and dull aluminum in color. They have the appearance of two pie-pans or shallow dishes pressed together and may have a raised dome on the top or bottom. No seams or joints are visible on the surface, giving the impression of one-piece construction. Discs are estimated from 50 to 300 feet in diameter and the thickness is approximately 15 percent of the diameter, not including the dome, which is 30 percent of the disc diameter and extends another 4 to 6 feet above the main body of the disc. The dome may or may not include windows or ports, and ports are present around the lower rim of the disc in some instances. Most"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"disc-shaped craft are equipped with lights on the top and bottom, and also around the rim. These lights are not visible when the craft is at rest or not functioning. There are generally no visible antenna or projections. Landing gear consists of three extendible legs ending in circular landing pads. When fully extended, this landing gear supports the main body 2 to 3 feet above the surface at the lowest point. A rectangular hatch is located along the equator or on the lower surface of the disc.\" Another SOM1-01 page is entitled \"Description of Extraterrestrial Biological Entities (EBEs)\" which states: \"Examination of remains recovered from wreckage of UFOBs indicates that Extraterrestrial Biological Entities may be classified into two distinct categories as follows: a. EBE Type 1. These entities are humanoid and might be mistaken for human beings of the Oriental race if seen from a distance. They are bi-pedal, 5 to 5 feet, 4 inches in height and weigh 80 to 100 pounds. Proportionally they are similar to humans, although the cranium is somewhat larger and more rounded. The skin is a pale, chalky-yellow in color, thick and slightly pebbled in appearance. Their eyes are small, wide set, almond-shaped, with brownish-black irises with very large pupils. The whites of the eyes are not like that of humans, but have a pale gray cast. The ears are small and not low on the skull. The nose is thin and long, and the mouth is wider than in humans, and nearly lipless. There is no apparent facial hair and very little body hair, that being very fine and confined to the underarm and the groin area. The body is thin and without apparent body fat, but the muscles are well-developed. The hands are small, with four long digits, but no opposable thumb. The outside digit is jointed in a manner as to be nearly opposable, and there is no webbing between the finger as in humans. The legs are slightly, but noticeably, bowed and the feet are somewhat splayed and proportionally large. \" b. EBE Type II. These entities are humanoid but differ from Type I in many respects. They are bi-pedal, 3 feet 5 inches to 4 feet 2 inches in height and weigh 25-50 pounds. Proportionally, the head is much larger than humans or Type I EBEs, the cranium being much larger and elongated. The eyes are very large, slanted, and nearly wrap around the side of the skull. They are black with no whites showing. There is no noticeable brow ridge, and the skull has a slight peak that runs over the crown. The nose consists of two small slits which sit high about the slit-like mouth. There are no external ears. The kin is a pale bluish-gray color, being somewhat darker on the back of the creature, and is very smooth and fine-celled. There is no hair on either the face or the body, and these creatures do not appear to be mammalian. The arms are long in proportion to the legs, and the finger is thicker than the others, but not as long as the index finger. The feet are small and narrow, and four toes are joined together with a membrane. \"It is not definitely known where either type of creature originated, but it seems certain that they did not evolve on earth. It is further evident, although not certain, that they may have originated on two different planets.\" Threat Assessment Further, the April 7, 1954 TOP SECRET special operations manual states under the label \"Current Situation\" a summary that closely parallels Kewper's description of his CIA colleagues' perspectives about the extraterrestrial situation back in 1957-1960: \"It is considered as far as the current situation is concerned, that there are few indications that these objects and their builders pose a direct threat to the security of the United States, despite the uncertainty as to their ultimate motives in coming here. Certainly the technology possessed by these beings far surpasses"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"anything known to modern science, yet their presence here seems to be benign, and they seem to be avoiding contact with our species, at least for the present. Several dead entities have been recovered along with a substantial amount of wreckage and devices from downed craft, all of which are now under study at various locations. No attempt has been made by extraterrestrial entities either to contact authorities or to recover their dead counterparts of the downed craft, even though one of the crashes was the result of direct military action. The greatest threat at this time arises from the acquisition and study of such advanced technology by foreign powers unfriendly to the United States. It is for this reason that recovery and study of this type of material by the United States has been given such a high priority.\" When that \"Current Situation\" was printed in the 1954 manual, either the grey being at Area 51, Nellis AFB, Nevada, was not there. Or this training manual did not want even its intelligence recovery teams to know that the U. S. government actually had extraterrestrials in custody. Further, the SOM1-01 manual does not discuss animal mutilations or the human abduction syndrome which were reported to the CIA and military officers as early as the 1950s, according to both Kewper and Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso in his 1997 book, The Day After Roswell. Was that information known when the SOM1-01 manual was written in the early 1950s? Or was it deemed necessary to keep such unsavory facts from the trained intelligence teams that would have to retrieve craft and extraterrestrial biological entities? Fifty-five years later in 2002, what sustains the Orwellian policy of silence and denial in which lies are ordered to become official truth? The 1954 U. S. War Department's SOM1-01 training manual states: \"Any encounter with entities known to be of extraterrestrial origin is to be considered to be a matter of national security and therefore classified TOP SECRET. Under no circumstance is the general public or the public press to learn of the existence of these entities. The official government policy is that such creatures do not exist, and that no agency of the federal government is now engaged in any study of extraterrestrials or their artifacts. Any deviation from this stated policy is absolutely forbidden.\" What will it take to change this policy of denial in the interest of national security? What non-human and military-industrial complex interests are so vested in perpetuating the suppression, and why?
