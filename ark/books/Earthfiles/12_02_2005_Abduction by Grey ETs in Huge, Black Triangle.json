The taller being kept telling me that time was only important to me. Time could be whatever they wanted it to be. And that size was irrelevant to them.\" - B ill Foster, Co-author, The Black Triangle Abduction December 2, 2005 Kittery, Maine - One of the most important unauthorized leaks of alleged U. S. government information to investigators of the UFO/ET phenomena is a training manual produced by the American War Department in April 1954 and entitled: \"Restricted SOM1-01 Majestic-12 Group Special Operations Manual: Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology, Recovery and Disposal, TOP SECRET/MAJIC EYES ONLY. In Chapter 2, Section 1, Paragraph 9, is the title: \"Description of Craft.\" Four categories are detailed: a) Elliptical or disc shape b) Fuselage or cigar shape c) Ovoid or circular shape d) Airfoil or triangular shape W hite arrows point out side view and bottom view of extraterrestrial craft labeled, \"TYPE D: AIRFOIL OR TRIANGLE SHAPE\" on Page 20, MJ-12 SOM1-01 \"Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology, Recovery and Disposal.\" The bottom page text reads: \"Note: Illustrations in this diagram are gathered from documented sightings in Air Force and Central Intelligence and from examination of wreckage collected from various sources years 1947-1953 inclusive.\" Leaked training manual distributed by Bob and Ryan Wood, www.majesticdocuments.com. Under Airfoil or triangular shape, the Majestic-12 SOM1-01 training manual states: \"This craft is believed to be new technology due to the rarity and recency of the observations. Radar indicates an isosceles triangle profile, the longest side being nearly 300 feet in length. Little is known about the performance of these craft due to the rarity of good sightings, but they are believed capable of high speeds and abrupt maneuvers similar to or "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"exceeding the performance attributed to types 'a' and 'c'.\" Forty-three years after that SOM1-01 training manual was printed, on March 13, 1997, in the early evening, a large triangle flew slowly in the sky over Phoenix, Arizona. Several eyewitnesses estimated its size to be 2 miles long. And completely silent. To date, no one has reported who, or what, was inside the series of aerial phenomena over Phoenix that night. But only four months before on November 16, 1996, around 10:45 p.m. in North Carolina, a retired sales manager of electronic equipment not only saw a huge triangle block out the stars, he had other eyewitnesses with him which included his wife and two good friends. Bill and Peggy Foster and the other couple, who wish to remain anonymous, had been partying at a social event outside Winston-Salem and were headed back home to Yadkinville. The first thing that caught their attention were three red lights in the sky coming toward them very low, perhaps 100 feet above ground. Bill told me this week, \"You could see a straight edge and tons of stars on the outside of the edge. But underneath, apparently filled by the triangle, you could see nothing! It was totally black.\" Y adkinville was about a half-hour drive from the festivities in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The whole event lasted about seven minutes, Bill thought, and when he and Peggy got home, they felt tired and went immediately to bed. The clock said 2 a.m. Later on, Bill Foster could not understand how it could have been so late. In fact, perhaps two hours were missing from their memories. Eventually the couple talked with Dr. John Mack in the Psychiatry Department at Harvard University, who had investigated the human abduction syndrome and came to the conclusion that masses of people were not all suffering delusions and hallucinations. Dr. Mack took the human abduction syndrome seriously, following in the steps of pioneer and groundbreaker in the field, Budd Hopkins. Both Dr. Mack and Budd concluded that non-human intelligences with their own specific agendas were interacting with Earth life. Dr. Mack recommended to Bill and Peggy Foster that they try to unlock the November 16, 1996, missing time with hypnosis. The couple ended up working with Nadine Wheeler, a licensed hypnotherapist, who used hypnosis to help people with physical and emotional traumas. To everyone's surprise, in his first hypnosis session, Bill Foster began to sob. He could not believe that flashing through his mind were memories of at least eleven encounters with the big, black triangle in the sky between age 5 in 1946 and age 55 in 1996. Further, inside the triangle craft were grey beings with \"huge blue-black liquidy eyes.\" The beings had egg-shaped heads where the narrow end was the chin. No ears, except holes. Small ridge for a nose and short slit for a mouth. There were no clothes or uniforms, only \"wet grey cement\"-colored skin that looked rough and wrinkled, but was very soft, \"like suede\" to touch. Bill and Peggy Foster worked with Nadine Wheeler to write about the unfolding hypnosis discoveries in a new book, The Black Triangle Abduction. Bill talked to me this week about his interactions with the entities. Interview: Bill Foster, 64-year-old retired sales manager of electronics company and co-author, The Black Triangle Abduction © 2005 by Bill Foster, Peggy Foster, and Nadine Wheeler: \" The beings were all about four feet except for what I termed the 'big guy.' I've never had a name for this individual who was probably was max, 51/2 feet tall, who seemed to tower above the other little guys. This seemed to be the one at that particular abduction and in all of mine (that I came up with subsequently) that was standing by my side, or I looked into his eyes quite a bit. He was much taller than the others. WHAT WERE HIS EYES LIKE? Very liquid pools. First of all, huge, pretty typical of the type that Whitley Strieber drew on the cover of Communion. That egg-shaped, large eyes. But very dark blue, with a rippling on the surface. No pupils, just one solid, dark cobalt blue with this liquidy ripple effect across the top. I could never see an eyelash or eyelid to blink. Never saw a blink. But just stare into those eyes and I would get the most comforting I don't know - most comforting,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"warmest, happiest feeling in the world. I don't have great words to describe how comforting and soothing that feeling is by just staring in the eyes. Telepathic Communication Another interesting facet I've read that people say the greys communicated through ESP (telepathy). To me, that sounds wrong because it denotes 2-way communication and most of these things just popped into my head. I found the best analogy that I could come up with is if you've ever walked out of a room and forgot why you went to this other room, then you had to go back where you were to think about it again. And it just appears in your brain. You don't see a word or a picture or hear anything. You just have the memory in your head. That sort of seems to be the way that I got communication. It just appeared as a memory in my mind. WHAT WAS THE MOST VIVID COMMUNICATION YOU REMEMBER OUT OF YOUR NEARLY DOZEN ABDUCTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE BEINGS WERE DOING? Oh, the continual mantra: 'Don't be afraid. We won't hurt you. Try not to be afraid.' The big thing with me was 'Don't be afraid.' I was the world's most afraid. As a matter of fact, one of the most unusual aspects I use a quote in the book I look back at the past abductions and I ended up liking these guys. It bothered me that I actually liked them because it would take some moments for me to recognize that I had been there before, like a whole different life that you didn't know you had. And so when I told John Mack I felt badly about it, he said, 'Well, you probably feel like a traitor to the human race.' I said, 'That's probably right.' Why would I like them? After all, they hurt me. Painful Physical Probes by ETs THEY HURT YOU HOW? The probes. I've gotten probes up the rear. I've gotten them over my genitals. I've gotten needles in the back. I can remember some probes in my ear. They've put an implant up my nose, my left nostril, when I was about 12. So, I've had a lot of pain associated with them. So it isn't something you would normally like people for plus the fact that you're abducted without your knowledge. My biggest quandary is the fact that they can keep all of this repressed in your subconscious memory to where you do not remember consciously. It's amazing to me how well it can be buried in your mind! IF IT IS BURIED IN SECRET, DOES THAT MAKE YOU NERVOUS? It does because it seems like I have a whole different life that I don't know anything about! I had no conscious knowledge until four years ago that I ever had any contact with this sort of thing. I thought I was just a normal guy leading a normal life. My wife certainly did not have any idea. I asked John Mack, 'When will this ever end?' And he said, 'Cradle to grave. It doesn't end.' Huge Triangle Over Ph oenix, March 13, 1997 T im Ley and his family, looking north from their Phoenix home, were among hundreds of eyewitnesses who saw Phoenix \"lights.\" The Leys described for computer graphic artist above a large triangle-shaped aerial craft they watched move overhead on March 13, 1997, Phoenix, Arizona. Courtesy KSAZ-TV, Phoenix. WHEN I THINK OF LARGE TRIANGLES, I THINK OF THE MANY PEOPLE I HAVE INTERVIEWED OVER THE PAST 20 SOME YEARS, EITHER IN A MILITARY CONTEXT OR CIVILIAN CONTEXT, WHO HAVE SEEN THEM. THE ONE THAT STANDS OUT IS MARCH 13, 1997, OVER ARIZONA AND PHOENIX. THERE ARE MULTIPLE EYEWITNESSES TO A LARGE TRIANGLE IN THE SKY. TWO RESPONSIBLE REFERENCES COULD RELATE THE SIZE OF THE TRIANGLE TO SOMETHING ON THE GROUND AND ESTIMATED IT WAS ABOUT TWO MILES"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"LONG. YOUR DESCRIPTION WAS THAT MAYBE IT WAS THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL FIELD, WHICH WOULD BE MAYBE 300 FEET IN DIAMETER. HAVE YOU TALKED WITH ANYONE WHO WAS AN EYEWITNESS TO THE MARCH 13, 1997, EVENT IN WHICH MULTIPLE PEOPLE SAW A GIGANTIC TRIANGLE AND WOULD YOU THINK IT WAS THE SAME GREYS YOU HAVE ENCOUNTERED? OR SOMETHING E LSE ? No, as a matter of fact, I'm glad you brought that up because that original description (of mine) that went out to all the original newspapers about the size of a football field was apparently way wrong. This thing (Nov. 16, 1996) was very massive and probably two miles long is not a bad description. When I first went into hypnosis and we were talking about the triangle, these bright lights came on overhead not all at once. They seemed to be in some sort of random order a very warm, not hot warm just a warming feeling and extremely bright. Then the car was lifted up. As a matter of fact, I was laughing to myself (under hypnosis) because I kept looking over my shoulder at the road wondering if any traffic was going to hit me. I started laughing and the therapist asked, 'What are you laughing about?' I was hypnotized. And I said, 'I'm laughing because the car isn't even on the road! We're being lifted up and away at the same time. It's pulling off to the left and taking us up with it.' And so this thing in looking up above us once the bright lights came on, I couldn't see anything. But just prior to that, this thing was massive. IN THE CAR, COULD YOU LOOK THROUGH AND SEE LIKE A BEAM AROUND YOUR CAR? No, what I saw was a series of what appeared to be little spot lights come on. If you took a peg board and you put a light above the pegboard and opened a few holes at a time until all the little holes were shining light, that's sort of what they looked like. It was coming from all over the bottom of the thing until the whole area was so bright I couldn't tell what I was looking at. But I had my eyes wide open and the bright light did not bother me at all. It was brighter than sunlight and I could stare right at it. 3-D Star Charts and \"Slide Show\" HAVE YOU EVER BEEN SHOWN A SCREEN WITH IMAGES ON IT? Oh, yeah, but it wasn't a screen. It was 283 pictures, but they were 3-D. It's like an Imax (movie theater) that you're in. At first, I thought I was looking at a slide show because they just whipped by, bam! bam! bam! The pictures went too fast. They kept telling me that I had to watch these during the instructional lessons when I was taken for the purpose of watching this slide show, or whatever you want to call it, until I understood. I thought I would never understand and finally one day I got it, whatever that means. In other words, I guess I understood what I was supposed to learn from these. Oddly enough, and I do mention this in the book, I started looking at the night sky when I went out. I'm no astronomer. I'm barely able to recognize the space station only because it's the brightest thing out there, along with the moon and Big Dipper. I would divide the sky into sections and I couldn't figure out why my mind was dividing the sky into sections. Then I realized it was because of the star patterns, but the odd thing is and I can't even explain to you how I know this they are backwards! The ones that I was supposed to memorize or understand or whatever the right word is for this, I saw them from the reverse side not from this (Earth) side from a space out there side. I don't know to this day what I'm supposed to know about them except that these 283 slides went by faster than you can turn the pages in a book. ALL ASTRONOMICAL? No, one like the third one was a human nose. Now figure that out! I'm looking at a nose on a face, up close, a nose. Makes no sense to me at all. What am I looking at a nose for? The 4th thing was like a planet, like a dying sun. You could tell there were maybe some coronal discharges around the edges. It looked like a molten planet. The other 3 (slides) out of the 5 were star charts. HAVE YOU DRAWN THE STAR CHARTS IN DETAIL? No, never tried. IT WOULD BE VERY INTERESTING TO COMPARE THEM TO BETTY AND BARNEY HILL AND THE STAR CHART SHE DREW?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"That's true.

Drawing © 2005 by Bill Foster. One of the things we did do was I remember seeing 8 posts, huge like 4 x 4 pillars or something in this hangar bay that the car was in. Anyway, at one point Nadine asked: 'What's on those posts?' I said, 'There are symbols. They look sort of like Chinese characters or whatever. They are stacked one on top of the other, massive symbols going all the way up the wall like 10 feet high. So, she took me out to a lighter hypnosis and had me draw the symbols of this one post, which we put in the book. I was amazed I could draw them. I didn't remember them consciously at all. COMING BACK TO THE IDEA THAT YOU WERE LOOKING AT STAR CHARTS THAT WERE THE OPPOSITE FROM THE WAY WE WOULD LOOK AT THEM FROM THE EARTH THAT YOU WERE LOOKING AT THEM FROM ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH ENTITIES FROM PARALLEL UNIVERSES, OTHER GALAXIES, OTHER DIMENSIONS. DOES ANY OF THAT SEEM POSSIBLE TO YOU WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THEIR SHOWING YOU STAR CHARTS THAT SEEM TO BE FROM AN"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"OPPOSITE PERSPECTIVE FROM OURS? Personally, I would much rather believe for the sake of my peace of mind that they come from \"another planet\" that is somewhere right out there you can put your finger on, as opposed to another dimension that is hard for me to grasp. The only way I can sense another dimension is what I think I read from Stephen Hawking who said, 'If you want to sense another dimension, every time you put your hand inside your aquarium where your fish are, you have come from another dimension and the fish think you have come from another dimension.' I can understand that. They can't see you without your hand in the aquarium. Grey Aliens Say Time and Size Are Not Relevant To Them THINKING OF THAT METAPHOR, IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THESE EXPERIENCES YOU'VE HAD WITH THE TALL GREY AND SHORT ONES THAT LEAVES YOU WITH A RESIDUE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER INTUITIVELY ABOUT WHETHER THEY ARE FROM ANOTHER SOLAR SYSTEM OR GALAXY OR WHERE? No. I honestly don't have a feeling. That must be my most frequently asked question. I can look back on each abduction and asked that a dozen times and never got an answer. The only things that I found fascinating that I did seem to get an answer to, or somehow is: time has no relevance to them. Time has no relevance to them. The taller being kept telling me that time was only important to me. Time could be whatever they wanted it to be. And that size was irrelevant to them. I asked at one point how big their ship was because it looked massive. He said, 'It's whatever size we need it to be.' [ Editor's Note: Stephen Hawking, Ph.D., Astrophysicist, is author of The Universe in a Nutshell and A Brief History of Time. Stephen William Hawking was born on 8 January 1942 (300 years after the death of Galileo) in Oxford, England. Since 1979, he has researched cosmology in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at Cambridge University and holds the post of Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, a post also held in 1663 by Isaac Newton. Professor Hawking is the recipient of many awards, medals and prizes and is a Fellow of The Royal Society and a Member of the US National Academy of Sciences. Stephen Hawking has worked on the basic laws which govern the universe. With Roger Penrose he showed that Einstein's General Theory of Relativity implied space and time would have a beginning in the Big Bang and an end in black holes. He discovered was that black holes should not be completely black, but should emit radiation and eventually evaporate and disappear. Another conjecture is that the universe has no edge or boundary in imaginary time. This would imply that the way the universe began was completely determined by the laws of science. ] HOW DO YOU INTERPRET THE MEANINGLESS OF TIME IN THE ALIENS' CONTEXT? At one point, I think I discovered, or it was told to me, in our years if you wanted to pin an age, the tall grey was something like 400 (Earth) years old. And that the little guys, the helper greys, were about 200 years old. He said, 'If our Earth time applied, which it doesn't.' I don't know what to make of that other than if I wanted to think in terms of age, they must have been around for a long time. And continue to be around a long time. WHY IS IT, IF TIME IS SO IMPORTANT TO US ON THIS PLANET, IT WOULD HAVE NO RELEVANCE TO WHERE THEY COME FROM? Isn't that unusual? And actually, a lot of things to do with time, when I think about it, we impose on ourselves. We wear watches. If you live on a desert island, time wouldn't mean much, except for light and dark. EXACTLY. WE HAVE THE ORBIT OF THE EARTH AROUND THE SUN AND DARK AND NIGHT. SO IF YOU CAME FROM A PLANET WHERE THERE WAS NO NIGHT AND IT WAS ALL BRIGHT, THEN MAYBE THERE WOULD BE NO SENSE OF TIME. That's true. You wouldn't have a cycle to worry about. And years are just markers we put in there. SO MAYBE THEY COME FROM A PLANET AROUND A COUPLE OF SUNS WHERE THERE IS NO DARKNESS AND YET, THE ISSUE IS: WHAT DO THEY WANT"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"HERE? Yeah. That is the question. What do they want? I have no idea, but I do get the sense that they are not here for our benefit. And the easy answer to that is: the reason they are not here for our benefit is we're doing everything their way. That's why we're abducted and we don't abduct them! So, obviously whatever they are doing benefits whatever they want to do, as opposed to anything we might have for wishes because whether you want the abductions to end or not, it doesn't end. So, they are in control of that. WHAT KNOWLEDGE DO GOVERNMENTS HAVE THAT KEEPS THIS ALL SO QUIET? That's the big question, isn't it? I mean, I can't believe that the government does not have a great deal of knowledge about this. After all, if you believe the government's line that there are no abductions and we're all just crazy, then this disease is worse than cancer. We ought to have a charity in our name. Millions of us should be getting help from the government to get cured. But nobody offers any cures. AND IT DOESN'T STOP. And it doesn't stop. No.\" More Information: C lick on cover to order.
