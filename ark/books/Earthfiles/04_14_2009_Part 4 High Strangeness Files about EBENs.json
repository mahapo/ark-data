Each is on a different frequency.” - L inda Porter, California Abductee R eturn to Part 1 April 14, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Continuing in Part 4 with Linda Moulton Howe's 1983 to 1987 High Strangeness Files about EBENs. HOW FAR BACK IN EARTH'S HISTORY HAVE EBENS INTERACTED WITH EARTH LIFE? The alleged presidential briefing paper I was shown at Kirtland AFB on April 9, 1983, stated in one paragraph that extraterrestrials were operating on Earth before the time of the dinosaurs and that in fact, the EBENs genetically created dinosaurs. Scientists date the beginning of dinosaurs to at least 230 million years ago. Dinosaurs ranged the entire planet until 65.5 million years ago when it's theorized that a large meteorite, or bolide, maybe one-half-mile in diameter, crashed into the Gulf of Mexico near the Yucatan peninsula that caused the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event that wiped out 48% of all genera of life on Earth, including the dinosaurs. According to the USAF Captain in 1949 and later a Colonel, Ebe told him that dinosaurs from our Earth were gathered up by EBENs before the meteorite impact and have been relocated to another planet for preservation as we put animals in zoos on Earth. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “The Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event, which occurred approximately 65.5 million years ago (Ma), was a large-scale mass extinction of animal and plant species in a geologically short period of time. Widely known as the K–T extinction event, it is associated with a geological signature known as the K–T boundary, usually a thin band of sedimentation found in various parts of the world.” A rtist's rendering of large meteorite or bolide impact in Gulf of Mexico 65.5 million years ago near the Yucatan peninsula.

The iridium-rich ash (the boundary) was deposited 65.5 million years ago when it is hypothesized that a large meteorite hit earth and wiped out 48% "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"of all genera of l i fe on Earth, i ncl udi ng the di nosaurs. I llustration of a Brontosaurus known to have been published in Animals of the Past © 1902 by Frederic A. Lucas. In 1983, I was told that the year before in 1982, a French road crew plowed into a buried silver-colored, disc-shaped craft embedded in granite and soil dated to at least a million years ago. Incredibly, it was reported that the craft was still powered. Inside were two skeletons about 2-feet-tall. The craft's interior was described as altogether different than the EBEN craft. A section of the craft's hull was eventually cut out and sent to Sandia Laboratory in Albuquerque, New Mexico, for analysis. According to the source, “they still don't know what it's made out of.” Were the small entities actually androids manufactured and programmed by other unknown non-humans to do work specifically on Earth? WHAT ABOUT OTHER MYTHOLOGIZED EARTH CIVILIZATIONS SUCH AS ATLANTIS? Ebe said at one time on Earth there was an alien civilization from outer space that inhabited land surrounded by water. Ebe also communicated that EBENs helped the Egyptians construct the pyramids for their dead and transition to an after life. The large stones were moved by antigravity technology, according to Ebe. HOW MUCH OF EARTH'S HISTORY HAS BEEN MANIPULATED BY EBENS? Ebe said that the entire history of the solar system and Earth was recorded in a crystal device which projects 3-dimensional holograms of everything that has happened and is happening. Ebe said that the truth about the Earth, the galaxy and the universe is that there are cyclic Big Bangs followed by contractions followed by more Big Bangs, but the EBENS discovered there is an End to the universe on a specific timeline and the EBENs made an effort to go into that End. Ebe said going into it is not pleasant. It is another dimension. Later on in 1991, I interviewed an abductee named Linda Porter who was familiar with non-human communication about other dimensions. She encountered an entity that resembled a tall praying mantis insect. She remembered a telepathic download into her mind from the creature of which the following is an excerpt: “There is much, much more to existence than we could ever begin to understand. Much of what we have ben taught regarding the physical universe and the laws that govern it is wrong. This creature's civilization communicates difficult concepts via the use of symbols that radiate emotion. They use this form to get concepts across with their exact true meanings intact. No misinterpretations can occur this way. The symbols are not mathematical ones, but appear as 3-dimensional holographic pictures that resemble abstract sculptures. The emotional aspect is relayed via carrier waves that resemble sound waves, but are not part of the human sound spectrum. These waves can be felt, but not heard. If the creatures want to clear a certain area of humans, they can 'broadcast' this carrier wave over the area at a certain frequency and it will create intense fear in people, causing them to flee the area. It does not cause any harm, so the aliens say. Problems arise when trying to translate this visual/emotional input into words. Human semantics can cause explanations to become mired down in confusion. What is extremely easy to comprehend on one level of existence using one form of expression then becomes very hard to interpret correctly when translating it onto another level using a limited form of expression such as the human language. A lot of meaning is lost and many important concepts"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"become hazy or are totally misinterpreted. The universe is built on sound patterns, which is why so many different worlds/dimensions can exist in the same space. Each is on a different frequency. Disrupt a world/dimension to the point that you destroy the carrier wave it exists on and you have created a 'hole' in existence that cannot support the dimension above or below it. Each frequency, besides maintaining its own world/dimension, also supports - or holds in place - the one above it and below it. Everything is interdependent! The other world/dimensions will begin to collapse into this 'hole.' Not only will this destroy countless other civilizations, but the resultant area of matter compressed into such density can throw the whole gravitational field for parsecs around it out of balance, thus causing the further damage of even more worlds as they are pulled out of orbit. The process feeds on itself. There are countless worlds/dimensions occupying the same space without being aware of one another because of having their own individual octaves. This octave/frequency holds the world/dimension in place and causes it to exist safely without interfering with (or even being aware of) other worlds around it. This frequency acts as a buffer zone to keep everything in its place. Do anything to disrupt it and you begin a collapse that starts a deadly chain reaction. If the density of this collapse reaches a certain weight, space/time itself begins to collapse.” [ For Linda Porter's complete dialogue, please see: Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. 2: High Strangeness © 1998 by Linda Moulton Howe in Earthfiles Shop. ] EBEN RELIGION: Ebe also said, “There really is a devil.” The implication was that the devil's source is another dimension that some how tries to interact with this matter universe's dimension of which Earth is a part. EBENs are sun-worshipers, like the Egyptians were. EBENs don't like war. They are not supposed to have offensive weapons, only defensive energy weapons that knock out any offensive weapons directed at them. Linda Porter also had an insight about the “dark side” from her encounters with the praying mantis and grey-skinned EBEN types. “The dark side seems to be a part of creation that has ben at war with itself since the beginning of all-that-is. How or why the split? I don't know. Those higher evolved would know that, not I. But ever since the two sides split apart, they have been creating beings with which to fight one another throughout all existence. Not just on this planet Earth, but on others, too. Is it something Creation itself uses as a tool to 'push against' itself as a way of expanding its own knowledge, growth and consciousness? I don't have the answer to that one either.” EBEN ANIMALS: Ebe described armadillo-like animals that live on the EBEN planet said to be dominated by desert conditions. Ebe said there were not many other indigenous animals there, but they have imported from Earth our cats, dogs and some other Earth animals to their planet. EBEN TRANSPORTATION: Many kinds of craft. Ebe said his civilization travels around their EBEN planet in ground machines the way we think of cars. But there are many different kinds of craft for space travel. Ebe described traveling to another galaxy. The EBEN craft in Earth skies are called “bathtubs” by human agents because the EBEN craft are egg-shaped and put down “bent legs” that remind some people of antique bathtubs that rested on ornate, angled legs. In contrast, the blond humanoid ships are shaped more like upside down pie plates with three “balls” placed in a triangle pattern on the bottom of the blond “Nordic, or Swede,” craft. EBEN craft and technology are described as so advanced that the best human scientists at Los Alamos cannot grasp the technologies. Travel is inter-dimensional. According to Ebe, there are at least fourteen different dimensions. Two of those dimensions, the human mind might be able to relate to, but humans would not be able to relate to the other twelve dimensions. The December 1980 Cash-Landrum craft is supposed to be one set down at H ill AFB, Utah, in 1953 as a “gift” by EBENs. The advanced craft was left powered up, but scientists have been trying to figure out how to make it work ever since. Supposedly its nuclear power is too advanced for our human scientists to deal with, so they tried to revamp it with a nuclear system that human scientists might control. But the experiment backfired near Houston and nearly killed the two women and the young boy. That craft was transported to Nellis AFB Area 51 for experimental flights away from civilian population. Supposedly there are hockey puck objects that levitate inside the craft that have puzzled human scientists since the discovery of the craft in 1953."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The December 26 - 28, 1980, Bentwaters AFB UFO events - the first sign of an alien presence in the Rendlesham Forest was a mechanical, “American-sounding voice” that communicated to the Bentwaters AFB tower. Then there was a bright flash of light from which fell silvery “ash” and two spaceships appeared. Supposedly there was a technical problem with one of the craft and the non-humans were in the forest from December 26 to 28, 1980, while repairs were underway and American and British military units photographed and monitored the alien craft and lights. NEW MEXICO POLICE OFFICER LONNIE ZAMORA: It was an EBEN military scout craft with the insignia on it. Communications with American military about landing for meetings are done by star coordinates and someone on the human end goofed by one day. The EBENS were supposed to have landed at the Trinity Site in the northern end of the White Sands Missile Range at 6 AM, April 25, 1964, in a white, egg-shaped craft on support legs. Instead, because of the communications error, the EBEN military scout craft landed near Socorro at 5:45 PM on April 24, 1964, which Lonnie Zamora encountered. Apparently realizing there was a mistake in location, the EBENs took off in the egg-shaped scout craft that produced flame and scorched plants. The landing leg supports left deep impressions of a triangle pattern in the desert soil. The EBENs and American military communicated again and the EBENs landed the next morning in the correct Trinity Site location. P olice officer Lonnie Zamora, Socorro, New Mexico, 1964.

Source: UFOcasebook.com. Much later on, Texas investigator, Chris Lambright, contacted Lonnie Zamora. “I sent him several pages of small sketches that covered various details of his sighting. I included several variations of this symbol, along with one that matched what I had seen in other places and another that matched what I thought he had described to me. I asked him to place a check mark by whichever sketch matched his recollection. However, in the section showing the symbols, he was nice enough to actually redraw what he had seen.” A bove the row of symbol variations is the one drawn by Lonnie Zamora"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"for Texas investigator, Chris Lambright, indicating what police officer Zamora saw with his own eyes on the egg-shaped craft near Socorro, New Mexico, at 5:45 PM on April 24, 1964. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “The Zamora incident began at 5:45 P.M. on April 24, 1964, in Socorro, New Mexico. Thirty-one year old policeman Lonnie Zamora was on patrol when he was passed by a car which was obviously speeding. Zamora took off in chase of the vehicle, but suddenly heard a loud roar in the distance, accompanied by a bluish, orange flame rising into the air. He knew that there was a dynamite shack not too distant from him, and he thought at first that there had been an explosion there. Abandoning the chase for the speeder, he pointed his police car in the direction of the shack. He radioed his activities to the sheriff's dispatcher. As Zamora proceeded towards the rising smoke and flame, the aftermath of the explosion seemed to disappear and reappear because of the rising and dipping roads he traveled. The route he was on was a narrow gravel one, and it wound around a small gully. As he approached the location of the shack, he noticed in the distance a shining object, anywhere from 100 to 200 yards away. His first reaction to this sight was that it was an automobile which had overturned, and its gas tank had exploded. Upon a closer look, however, he discovered that it was an oval-shaped object without windows or doors. He stated that the object was about the same bulk of a medium-sized car. He was drawn to an unusual red insignia on the side of the object, and then noticed two beings that he thought at first to be children, dressed in white overalls. He recalled that one of the \"children\" seemed to jump (become frightened), upon noticing him.”] MJ-12: American presidents are treated only on a Need To Know basis. John F. Kennedy wanted everything out about all the UFO information - he threatened MJ-12 that he would order an official investigation of all secret vaults and files on the extraterrestrials. The consequence was that MJ-12 ordered JFK's assassination to keep the public and media from finding out about the non-human presence and about MJ-12's authority in investigations and documents concerning the non-human presence, technologies and back-engineering efforts in highly classified operations within American corporations.
