This wheat field is on the highest plateau of Milk Hill and the highest point in the county of Wiltshire, England. The field is not visible from any road and to get there, people must walk about fifteen minutes from the nearest place to park a car. Photograph © 2001 by Lucy Pringle. August 22, 2001 Alton Barnes, England - Author and researcher, Lucy Pringle, has been flying over crop formations to take aerial photographs and to investigate the plants and soils of English crop formations since the mysterious patterns began evolving from simple circles and rings in 1989. She has been in hundreds. But this formation that was discovered in Ron Read's wheat field on a high plateau of Milk Hill, Wiltshire on Sunday, August 12, overwhelmed her. After measurements were made, there were 409 circles of varying sizes divided into six curved arms stretching 240 meters (787 feet) from one side to the other. The largest central circle was 72 feet in diameter and the smallest little circles that dotted along the large arms were no more than 40 inches in diameter. Interviews: Lucy Pringle, Crop Circle Researcher and Author, Petersfield, Hampshire, England: \" When I went in with Denni Clarke (from California), we were both completely bewildered and disoriented because as far as we could see in any direction there was nothing but circles. We didn't know where we were. We couldn't find the center. We said, 'What's happening to us?' We were just completely bewildered! Then somebody who had been in there longer got us and said, 'I know there are 13 circles (on each arm) from the tip right into the center.' So she started off ahead of us and she just disappeared from sight on the horizon. And then she reappeared to wave from what seemed miles away to say, 'I'm in the center!' So we made our way towards it, but you know when you are on the ground, you have no possible means of deciphering the shape of the formation, especially when you're confronted with 409 circles. Where the hell are you?! ? C lose-up center of Milk Hill, Wiltshire formation. Center circle was 72 feet in diameter. The smallest circles "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"were only 40 inches across. Photograph © 2001 by Lucy Pringle. It's quite impossible when many of them measure 70 feet in diameter. You just don't know where you are. Totally mind blowing I've never seen anything like it. I mean, as far as you could see on the horizon there were circles. I've never seen anything so big in all my life. I had to go up to over 2000 feet to get it in my lens! HOW DID IT COMPARE TO OTHERS YOU HAVE SEEN? Well, I can tell you that it was not like the triple spiral (Windmill Hill 1996 Triple Julia Set). In that triple spiral, every single circle was different. And I have to say in this particular one, the lay was very uniform. They are all clockwise. HAS ANYBODY BEEN ABLE TO GO TO EVERY CIRCLE? Not that I know of. I can't say I've been in all 409! I can't even tell you which ones I've been in, to tell you the truth!! It's so confusing. I know I've been in the center a couple of times now. But every single one I went into, and I think it was a wide variety, they have all been clockwise.\" G iant 409-circle, nearly 800 feet diameter, formation discovered Sunday, August 12, 2001, in Milk Hill, Wiltshire, wheat field. Andreas Mueller of Saarbruecken, Germany measured every circle, large and small, in one of the six arms. Photograph © 2001 by Lucy Pringle. A Researcher Who Measured Every Circle In One Arm ANOTHER CROP CIRCLE RESEARCHER WHO HAS MEASURED AND DRAWN DETAILED DIAGRAMS OF DOZENS OF CROP FORMATIONS THE PAST THREE YEARS IS ANDREAS MUELLER FROM SAARBRUECKEN, GERMANY. HE HAD BEEN IN SOUTHERN ENGLAND TRAVELING FROM FORMATION TO FORMATION FOR ABOUT A MONTH IN THE SUMMER OF 2001. SATURDAY NIGHT, AUGUST 11, WAS HIS LAST NIGHT AND HE AND HIS FRIENDS LEFT EARLY THE NEXT MORNING FOR GERMANY. WHEN HE ARRIVED, HE ALREADY HAD A MESSAGE ABOUT THE HUGE MILK HILL FORMATION DISCOVERED THAT SAME DAY, AUGUST 12. SO HE TURNED AROUND AND WENT BACK TO WILTSHIRE TO EXPERIENCE IT FOR HIMSELF AND MEASURE AS MUCH AS HE COULD. Andreas Mueller, Student, School of Fine Arts, Saarbruecken, Germany, and producer of The International Crop Circle Archive (I.C.C.A.) : “When you start surveying, you look for symmetry and we have that in this formation. Of course, I didn't measure all 409 circles. Entering it the only thing I can explain is that you were surrounded by circles. This was unbelievable. You made a 360 degree turn and circles were all around you. And without an aerial picture, you simply would not know what's up there. But I measured each diameter of each circle of one of the six arms, even of the small circles on the side. And took some control measurements in other arms. So, this gives you quite a workable basis for doing the survey work. The biggest circle was in fact the central circle with 22 meters in diameter. (72 feet) And the smaller circles that were the caterpillar like arms on the sides of the six arms which had the smallest was like 1 meter and 50 centimeters. (40 inches or 3 ft 4 inches). The thing is that what was of very impressive detail in this formation is that it was placed in a field that was very sloping. There were many ditches and some in the field. Those ditches were very deep. I was once standing in an outer circle of one of the arms looking in the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"direction of the very center and I saw some people that I thought were sitting in a circle because their heads were just showing out of the standing crop. When I approached them, I realized they were actually standing in a circle that was in the lowest part of the ditch. So, you can imagine how bumpy the whole area was. And this was very difficult for me because those irregularities in the crowns and in the topography did not cause any distortion or irregularity in the formation itself which is a basic problem for architecture. What they have to do is make the foundation for a house, they have to create a flat and right angle platform where they can start on. Or they have to do a very detailed topographical survey of the whole ground to be able to put down a building. And this is similar - architecture makes the same as crop circles do - they bring geometry on the ground, basically. And so, something was able to avoid all these known problems by creating this amazing and the biggest formation we've ever had. Not the longest, but the biggest we've ever had on such a hard terrain. And the night it had formed (August 11) it rained and and we can also confirm a witness who is credible, a crop circle man from Wiltshire. He was there on Saturday at the field and there were no circles. So it had to have happened that night. It is something someone really has to experience in the field. This sheer scale, this sheer large scale. It's mind blowing. And to say it in an experienced circle maker's words who was baffled by it and just kicked away by this formation, he said: 'My brain hurts.' THIS IS A GUY WHO HAS MADE CROP FORMATIONS, SAID TO YOU ABOUT MILK HILL, 'THIS MAKES MY BRAIN HURT.' Yeah. And I remember that we were out with a cropcircleconnector guy because it was our last night in England. When we drove home, rain started and the whole, or big part of the night, we were covered in rain. And it was that humid in the air until 11 the next morning, the whole area was covered in very thick mist and fog and so we went home to Germany. But the basic thing I want to tell is that the night was covered with rain. And people who were first in the formation said the lay was nice and clean and with no footprints on it and everybody who knows what it is to walk in a wet field - you know this from England - it is not possible to avoid that your feet and shoes get clumpy with tons of earth and mud and you spread this all over in the formation. And nothing was there. WHAT KIND OF GEOMETRY ARE YOU FINDING AS YOU ANALYZE THIS FORMATION? Many people compare this, of course, to the Julia Set. But the difference between this formation and the Julia Set we had (in 1996). Julia Sets follow a spiral path. those 6 arms are not spiral. They are arcs as parts of circles. So, it's like in your book, you show the procedure how to make a 6-fold geometry. And this is basically the idea that is shown - a 6-fold geometry made out of circular elements. So, there are no spirals, just circles. Or rings or arcs. FROM THE CENTER CIRCLE, COULD YOU SEE OUT TO ALL THE FORMATION IN ALL DIRECTIONS? WAS IT HIGHER IN THE CENTER? No, but it's a good question because it was actually the highest point in the field, or nearly the highest point. Probably there was also another highest point at the other end of the field. But it was really like a good place to put the highest point as the center point because it was slightly the highest point, but because of the topography of the field, you could not see in all end of the arms because they were sometimes lower or hidden by the ditches in the field. And sometimes they were too far away. STANDING IN THE CENTER, YOU COULDN'T SEE ALL OF THE ARMS TO THE END? No. HOW DIFFICULT WOULD IT HAVE BEEN IN THE DARK TO LAY OUT SUCH A FORMATION AND PRODUCE IT? The thing that takes the time is the survey and the positioning and marking the geometrical relevant points. And this really takes hours. And based on experience, I think the only way it could have been made by people in several stages over several nights. But we know definitely that did not happen. On top of that, it appeared on a night of pouring rain and there was only a few hours between sunset and sunrise. It is something someone really has to experience in the field. This sheer scale, this sheer large scale. It's mind blowing."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Intelligent Consciousness Sensed in the Milk Hill Formation AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF GOING EACH SUMMER FROM GERMANY TO ENGLAND AND GETTING INTO THE FIELDS, ARE YOU LEFT WITH ANY SENSE INSIDE YOURSELF OF WHAT COULD BE BEHIND SOMETHING LIKE MILK HILL 2001? I think a good word that explains what I feel is 'consciousness.' And 'intelligence.' But not fixing those two words to aliens from outer space. I see the intelligence and consciousness even in Nature, but not in simple nature as we are used to experiencing it each day. It is something hidden in Nature. Probably it can be explained with Hyper-Nature. I don't know. I don't want to exclude aliens, but it's not what I personally feel. I feel after all these years that we are facing a phenomenon that teach us again the basic teachings on ourself, our environment and our nature. And so I see more hints for linking the phenomenon with a consciousness and intelligence which is in nature itself. CLOSE TO THE MIND OF GOD, SO TO SPEAK? So to speak, but this brings crop circles in the religious and I don't think they are religious. And in the same way that I look at a flower and suddenly realize what a wonder it is. What big and complex geometry it includes and this is something we need to wonder about and this is something I think the crop formations teach us.\" What A Professional Land Surveyor Says: GIVEN THE IMMENSE SIZE OF THE MILK HILL 2001 FORMATION AND THE 409 CIRCLES, I ASKED A PROFESSIONAL LAND SURVEYOR IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY TO STUDY PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE PATTERN AND ESTIMATE HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE HIS SURVEY TEAM TO MARK OUT THE FORMATION. Vincent Creevey, Professional Land Surveyor, Southern New Jersey : \"To stake something like this out in the field from a surveying perspective, it's probably going to take a better part of a day and a half to two days work. Because you've got 409 points. You would have to lay out the radius point of every circle in that formation to get it perfectly symmetrical. And the office calculations you would need for something like that would probably take also the better part of a half a day with a computer. And the way this would be laid out would be with an electronic distance meter and a data collector that would already have the coordinates of all the points stored into it. That's how it would be laid out in the field. A TWO MAN TEAM WORKING WITH THOSE CONDITIONS WITH THE MOST ADVANCED SURVEYING COMPUTER KNOWLEDGE, WOULD TAKE MAYBE UP TO TWO DAYS EVEN TO LAY IT OUT? That's correct. WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU LOOKED AT THE PHOTOGRAPH AND YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD APPROACH A HILLSIDE WHEAT FIELD THAT UNDULATES AND IS ON A SLANT AND PUTTING DOWN CIRCLES IN A PATTERN THAT SEEMS TO BE THAT MATHEMATICALLY ACCURATE? My personal opinion is that I think the thing is fantastic and absolutely amazing! And I showed this to a couple of my colleagues at work and they said, 'Yeah, it would be a big job!' And I don't know how you would explain it. I wouldn't know how to go about putting down the circles themselves. From a surveying standpoint, what we'd be looking at staking out would be the center of each circle, the radius point. So, then from there by whatever means, the circle would be flattened from that central point. I can't even venture a good guess as to how long that would take. AFTER TWO DAYS OF WORKING IN THE FIELD, WORKING OUT THE CENTERS OF THE CIRCLES AND DOING THAT WITH AT LEAST A HALF DAY OF COMPUTER TIME DATA, YOU HAVE 2.5 DAYS THERE. THEN LAYING THE CROP DOWN WOULD BE AN ADDITION TO THOSE 2.5 DAYS? Yeah. And I would imagine that would take some time as well. It certainly would be a difficult task to lay this thing out. And a costly one. In the United States your survey crews run anywhere from $800 to $1,000/day. Also, I'm speaking of doing this work in the day"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"time. It would be very, very difficult to do this survey work at night time. WOULD IT BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO LAY THESE 409 CIRCLES OUT AT NIGHT? It would be extremely difficult. You would have to have some type of surveying equipment with an optical laser site on board. That does exist, but it's pretty expensive and most people aren't using it because it's not necessary for a lot of current construction layout work. Another possibility would be to lay it out with the Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment. Once again, that is even more costly equipment, but that works by using satellites to determine your position on earth. And you would have to have the time to lay out those using the satellite positions. COULD YOU GUESS HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO LAY OUT THAT 409 CIRCLE FORMATION? With the very best GPS equipment available, you might be able to lay out each point in about 2 to 3 minutes, and with some of the less expensive equipment, it would probably be about 45 minutes per point. That would still be about twelve hours of laying out points before any crop could be laid down.” More Information: Lucy Pringle has produced this 2002 calendar with three glossy photographs per page, showing the classical crop circle formations, plus associated sacred places, cathedrals, villages, flowers and animals.
