S., Microwave Technician Updated with Earthfiles viewerbluemobluemoon comments: February 14, 2006 \"I'm writing to inform you that I, too, have seen these lights in the sky here in Blythe, CA northeast of Brawley, CA. I've seen lights like these before, but not that often. There is a bombing range between Blythe and Brawley and you can see lights over that area from time to time. I use to make a big deal out of them, but most people I talk to about them don't seem to care. But, I'm happy to see them reported on your website.\" February 15, 2006 \"I read your post at Earthfiles about the beams seen in the skies over CA. As well, I heard you on a past recording of Dreamland. The man interviewed said the beams were descending towards the Chocolate Mountain area, and he pinpointed an area at the gunnery range. ...Beams shot up can sometimes appear to be shooting down and that's what may have been seen. It might be a test of a secret gov. weapon known as a Rail-Gun. If the bars of light were truly descending, it might mean the Rail-Gun is now in space, or on a high altitude jet like the Aurora, fitted with a test version of a Rail-Gun.\" February 15, 2006 \"I am wondering if what the individual saw in this instance was fire from an AC-130 Spectre gunship, possibly in a training exercise or conducting some sort of live fire exercise in the desert. Twentynine Palms Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center is to the north of Brawley. AC-130s usually operate at night. \"If it was not a joint USAF-USMC air-ground exercise, then I have no idea what an AC-130 would be doing firing at the ground near Brawley. The use of this aircraft for a Drug Interdiction mission would seem rather extraordinary. I also thought about test firing of the Airborne Laser System, yet normally when it is fired, there is a solid shaft of light and not a series of energy \"bolts\" or \"bars\" as with the description from Brawley. This is a very interesting mystery.\" A irborne Laser Logo for D.O.D.'s Star Wars Space Policy Project. See website below. February 13, 2006 - On February 8, 2006, I received the following e-mail from a microwave technician driving around 11 p.m. Pacific time on February 7, when he saw huge, disconnected bars of light suddenly appear moving downward at an angle in the dark "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"sky lasting for about half a minute. He contacted Earthfiles to ask what the mysterious, aerial bars of light might be. If any Earthfiles viewers have any more information, or have seen any comparable bars of light, please contact: earthfiles@earthfiles.com E-mail February 8, 2006 From M. S., near Brawley, California: \"I have listened to you a number of time on C2C radio and know of your interest in UFOs. I am currently in the southern CA and Yuma, AZ area working at RF tower sites doing microwave work. Yesterday night (2/7/06) at around 11 p.m. AZ time, I was driving to a tower site in the mountains of southeastern CA and saw something that I have never seen before. I estimated from my DeLorme Street Atlas map that a large military installation was around 10 to 12 miles away from my vehicle and directly in front of me at the time on the road I was traveling on. It was totally dark outside of course due to the late hour. Suddenly, there was what appeared to be several huge - and I mean really huge - fluorescent white beams of light that were all of the same length and spaced evenly apart, coming down at about a 225 degree angle (0 being straight up), in other words, at a downward angle toward the left halfway between straight down and horizontal. The fixed length beams of bright white light appeared to come out of the black sky, probably from at least a couple of thousand feet in the atmosphere, and at a reasonably slow pace made their way to the ground. There are mountains or hills in the way so I could not see the ground or destination where the light beams were directed.

S. for Earthfiles. \"The lights reminded me of the Luxor in Las Vegas, only the thickness, length and brightness of the Luxor lights is a pittance compared to what I saw. There were only about 7 or 8 of these light beams, lasting a total of about 20 to 30 seconds and then they stopped. After contemplating the lights and their slow downward \"slide\" they appeared to be some kind of guiding lights. I just know they were absolutely huge, thick and bright and were most certainly a technological phenomena, not a natural one. The size of these lights and the distance they traveled, as if down a tight cable, easily dwarfed the size of 500 to 1000 foot communications towers. And if the lights were closer to 20 miles away, nearer to the center of the military installation, they would definitely have had to be the size of a mountain. \"I could see nothing else due to the darkness, except that within one minute there was a yellowish light just off to the west of where the \"fluorescent lights\" were that came on and went off a couple of times. It too must have been 2000 or more feet above the ground. I thought it might be some kind of flare light, except that it did not move in any trajectory. It appeared to be still. It was not a typical FAA tower light. It lit up in an isotropic pattern and was not white or red, but yellowish orange. Another tech I met at the site had seen the yellowish orange light before, but not the white tubular beams. \"Do you have any idea what I might have seen? Or do you think this is"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"some type of technology that the public has not been told about.\" L ocation of aerial beams of light specified on map as \"lights\" at southeastern part of Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range north of Brawley, California and northwest of Yuma, Arizona. Map © 2006 by M. S. for Earthfiles. E-mail February 9, 2006 \"Hi Linda, \"I decided to drive back to the area where I saw the lights and take a picture from the highway tonight. I took the attached picture at dusk and using Paint I then drew in the lines of light where I remember seeing them. This is as good as my visual memory allows right now. The only difference is that it was at 11:00 PM at night and therefore quite dark, though there was a partial moon in the mostly clear sky that night, but not within the pictured area. \"After looking at the area tonight from the road and remembering the notch in the mountain to the left of where the lights came down I found that the location on the road where I saw the lights from was probably a few miles north from where I had indicated on the maps that I sent you. In either case, the lights were beaming from, or to, an unknown location behind the mountains quite a few miles away from my vehicle, and as you can see they \"originated\" quite high in the sky where they then descended from toward the ground in the straight line direction of the lights while maintaining their even spacing. Since these mountains are north of California SR78 going east/west, it appears to be something that the military installation, Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range (CMAGR) is working on. \"The lights were not green or blue argon laser beams like those I have seen in Hawaii, but were all very bright white. No objects could be seen at or near the lights, just the light beams. They probably don't mind civilians seeing the lights once in a while, because the technology is hidden anyway by the mountains and the darkness. You would think that if they minded they would go further north and not beam them so high that everyone in the area could see them. There is the Border Patrol station to the east on SR78 and if I stop my vehicle within 10 miles of it (at night with my headlights on) to look at a map or something, they will show up to check me out within a couple of minutes. I wonder if the Border Patrol employees have been briefed about the lights. A tech I worked with said a Blackhawk helicopter buzzed him once on the road to the tower site near there, then landed and troops got out in some kind of exercise.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"O riginal sketch for Earthfiles by M.
