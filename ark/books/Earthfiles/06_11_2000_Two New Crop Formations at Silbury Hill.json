June 11, 2000 Silbury Hill, Wiltshire, England - Photographer Peter Sorensen has been photographing the mysterious crop formations in England since 1992, both on the ground and in the air. He is back in Wiltshire, England for the 2000 crop formation season and e-mailed today: E-mail from Peter: \"Thanks to an e-mail tip from someone who was driving to work at 5 a.m. this Sunday morning, I was able to promptly visit two new formations between Silbury Hill and the Waggon and Horses pub. Both are over 200 feet in diameter in barley. ... \"Now to see if I can possibly fly tomorrow. At least SOMEbody was above in a helicopter, so the twin formations have been documented before they are destroyed by tourists. There were about 50 people traipsing around during the time I was there and a couple of them walked thoughtlessly through the crop from one circle to the other. The farmer is charging two pounds to go in, a quid a piece. A fair deal!\" I called Peter in Stanton St. Bernard for more details about his visit to the two Silbury Hill formations created in the same field in which the huge Winged Solar Disk formation emerged last year on June 19, 1999. Interview: Peter R. Sorensen, Videotape Photographer, Stanton St. Bernard, Wiltshire, England: \"I quickly arranged to get a ride out over there and what I found was - it's like two squares overlapping each other in such a way you can get a blunt 8-pointed star and surrounding that are several rings going outward. Total diameter of the thing is well over 200 feet. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Diagram of 8-pointed \"star\" formation discovered June 11, 2000 at Silbury Hill near the second formation of a triangle inside the hexagon. Diagram © 2000 by Peter R. Sorensen. And very curiously, the way the crop was laid down in this 8-pointed star is there were several, maybe 100 different clumps that were still standing up in the flattened crop and seven of those clumps had little swirls around them. I've never seen anything like that before. One of nearly 100 different clumps of barley left standing in the 8-pointed star. Oddly, only seven of the many clumps were surrounded by very deliberate swirls like this photograph. All the clumps seemed to be distributed randomly within the formation. Photograph © 2000 by Peter R. Sorensen. So, that's formation number 1. Formation Number 2 which is higher up on the brow of the hill and you couldn't see what the design was until you walked up there. This formation consists of a flattened circle about 60 feet in diameter and surrounding it is a standing triangle and surrounding that is a flattened hexagon. Now, this is all contained within two broad rings, so the ultimate size of this formation ends up being about as large as the other which is 200 feet plus.

HOW FAR APART ARE THESE TWO FORMATIONS? Less than their own diameters probably, about 100 to 150 feet apart. I WONDER IF YOU OR ANYBODY ELSE HAS GIVEN ANY THOUGHT TO THE IDEA THAT WHATEVER INTELLIGENCE IS PUTTING THESE FORMATIONS IS PUTTING THEM DOWN, THAT ONE MIGHT BE PUT DOWN FOR ONE INTENT BY ONE INTELLIGENCE AND ANOTHER COMES TO EITHER COUNTER, NEUTRALIZE OR REINFORCE THE OTHER. Ye s . ANYTHING ABOUT THESE TWO FORMATIONS THAT YOU HAVE HAD ANY INSIGHTS ABOUT THE PARTICULAR GEOMETRIES OR THE RELATIONSHIP TO EACH OTHER? You've got the six and the eight, which in a way are not particularly harmonic together in my own sort of intuitive feelings about them. And even though they are quite similar in some ways, on the whole each seems to have very different flavors. Either different entities made them or who knows? I don't think these were made by the same source or people or hedgehogs or little green men or whatever is making these crop circles. There seems to be two different artistic flavors to them. WHICH ONE DID YOU PERSONALLY RESONATE WITH THE MOST? Definitely the triangle and circle. Not the 8-sided one. The hexagon was the first one I came to and also this was so beautifully laid out. There were hardly any standing, except for an occasional magical standing stalks. That's what I call them, those lovely single standing stalks. No, it was all very neatly flattened to fill in even here and there diamond shapes and circles within the lay. Very beautifully done. THE HEXAGON. Ye s ."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THE EIGHT-SIDED, THE TWO SQUARES DOWN OVER EACH OTHER - IT ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE THERE WAS MORE CHAOTIC ENERGY INVOLVED GIVEN ALL OF THOSE RANDOMLY PLACED STANDING STALKS WITH THE SWIRLS. Absolutely. Absolutely. That was very chaotic. Maybe that's what I didn't feel I liked about that one. WHAT ABOUT THE MYSTERIOUS FORMATION ACROSS THE ROAD AT THE WEST KENNETT LONG BARROW THAT YOU FIRST REPORTED ON JUNE 2ND? COULD YOU DESCRIBE THAT TRANSFORMATION THAT TOOK PLACE AND THE INTERESTING ISSUE OF SOMEBODY TRYING TO DESTROY THE FIRST VERSION? WHAT HAPPENED? Right, this went through some stages of evolution which is unusual, but it's happened before. The formation when it was first found was about the same size as the others - over 200 feet in diameter, but was almost all standing crop with thin lines used to define a 12-sided figure around the outside. Actually 12 little triangles, very shallow triangles, going all the way around the outside. And then, inside of that was a very thin ring and a very thin flattened lines making a triangle in the center of all standing crops. There were just these thin lines and thin little triangles around the outside. About it being rough, the first people in it that morning reported that it looked as though somebody tried to trash it. The lay of the crop circles are usually quite smooth and going in one direction. This was as if somebody had been walking backwards against those lines, messing up all the crop. The guy said to me, 'No hoaxer in his right mind would ever do this to their own artwork!' So, this must be somebody who was intentionally trying to damage the thing. THEN BY THE NEXT DAY? Then the design matured tremendously, getting large flattened areas which took that large standing central triangle and cut small flattened triangles into it. By the way, it has a lot of the same flavor as the new one today which has the triangle and the hexagon. THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU. Yeah, same family. IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS FIRST ONE AT THE WEST KENNETT LONG BARROW ACROSS THE ROAD WAS A 12 WHICH IS A DOUBLE OF 6 WITH THE TRIANGLE AND NOW YOU'VE GOT THE HEXAGON WHICH IS THE 6 ALSO WITH A TRIANGLE MOTIF. I'VE GOT ON THE WEB SITE AT EARTHFILES.COM YOUR BEAUTIFUL PHOTOGRAPH OF IT AFTER THE TRANSFORMATION AND THE RECONSTRUCTION THAT YOU DID LABORIOUSLY WHICH I AM GRATEFUL BECAUSE IT GIVES US A CLEAR IDEA WHAT IT WAS 24 HOURS BEFORE AND RAISES THE MYSTERIOUS QUESTION OF WHO TRIED TO DAMAGE? AND THEN WHAT CAME BACK AND WENT MANY STEPS FURTHER IN THE COMPLEXITY? That's right. As if somebody tried to damage it and then the original circle intelligence said, 'OK, then try to damage this!' and then flattened about TEN times as much crop beautifully again. Yeah, it's very unusual. But remember the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"web formation we had at Avebury several years ago. That one also was done in two stages. On the first night, the lines went down. And on the second night, the larger areas were flattened. I'M CURIOUS IN THE PROCESS OF PHOTOGRAPHING THESE FORMATIONS, WHAT IS IN YOUR MIND AND YOUR SOUL IN RELATIONSHIP TO WHAT THE PURPOSE MIGHT BE FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW NOW OF THESE CONTINUING FORMATIONS, SOMETIMES GEOMETRIC, AND SOMETIMES NOT? AND THIS ISSUE OF SOMETHING PERHAPS IN CONFLICT OR WITH AT LEAST TWO DIFFERENT INTENTS PLACING THESE FORMATIONS DOWN, NOT ONLY IN ENGLAND, BUT IN GERMANY AND MANY OTHER PLACES? My sort of philosophy or understanding as best as it is of the crop circle phenomenon is that some intelligence interested in mankind is bringing us these maybe they are messages, but at the very least they are like visual music. They are harmonies that are good for the soul to look at. And it's affecting millions of people in the world, these designs, one way or another, making people start to ask questions they might never have asked before. A UFO is a fleeting thing and maybe you get a blurry picture of it and it doesn't affect people unless they really want to be. But crop circles are really beautiful. When you see a picture, you can't ignore it. No matter what you think made the crop circles like I said, whether it's hedgehogs or little green men, it moves your spirit so beautifully. It does that for me and I thank the circle makers for leaving humanity better off with these messages. And it may well be, of course, that there are some really astonishing times ahead of us here in the year 2000 and up to the year 2012. This is an extremely important time in our evolution. So, something is singing to us. YOU ARE PICKING 2012 AS THE CLOSE OF THE GRAND MAYAN CALENDAR, FOR EXAMPLE? Right, I think that is more important than the year 2000. Pope Gregory and his Gregorian Calendar is not exactly based on the birth of Jesus and, I think the Mayan Calendar is much more ancient, much more probably fundamental to reality, this slice of reality we're in. You know, the crop circles may affect a few million people on the planet, but that's not a lot of people. But what it might be is just the exact amount necessary, the straw to take off the camel's back so the camel doesn't break its back, right? Just the right amount to get us through the eye of the needle. ENOUGH CONSCIOUSNESS IN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PEOPLE. That's right. PAYING ATTENTION. Ye s . EVEN IF THE REST OF THE WORLD IS COMPLETELY OBLIVIOUS TO ALL THESE FORMATIONS THAT ARE NOW IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES. WHAT IF THIS IS REALLY BEING DONE BY FREQUENCIES THAT ARE BEYOND WHERE WE ARE NOW? Oh, sure. Actually, the more time I've spent with these crop circles, the less I've begun sure at all what the actual source of the intelligence is. Sure, all sorts of dimensional - angels. God's probably been looking out for the universe since"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Square One. Still keeping the tune, you know. THAT WE COULD BE DEALING WITH THE HIGHEST ANGELIC FREQUENCIES THAT HAVE BEEN THERE FROM THE BEGINNING OF EVERYTHING? Yes, indeed.\" More Information: Keep up with all of Peter Sorensen's beautiful crop formation photographs on the ground and in the air at his web site inside the major crop circle crossroads for the world at www.cropcircleconnector.com.
