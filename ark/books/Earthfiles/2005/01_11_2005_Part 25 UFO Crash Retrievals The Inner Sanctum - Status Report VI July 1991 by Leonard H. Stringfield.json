Continued - Len Stringfield's reprint of report from Long Island UFO Network (LIUFON),New York: Long Island UFO Network (LIUFON), New York: Moriches Bay and surrounding communities on Long Island, New York, south ofBrookhaven National Laboratory. Quogue is south of the Westhampton Air Guard facility. JOHN D., QUOGUE, LONG ISLAND, 2:30 AM, 9/29/89 John D. is a commodities broker on Wall Street. He has asked that his real identitynot be used with this report. John D. lives in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Every weekend during the spring to the latefall, he will come out to spend time with his sister and her family at her residence inQuogue. It is located just one-quarter mile south of the main runway of theWesthampton Air Guard facility. The night of the incident in the wee morning hours of the 19th of September 1989,John was sleeping over at his sister's house. He had taken Friday off and wasplanning to spend the entire three days with his sister's family as a short vacation.About 2:30 AM in the morning of the 29th, he was awakened by the sound ofhelicopters. He went to the bedroom window which was located on the second floorof the house and peered out towards the air base. There coming in above the treelineto the southwest were two big Air Force helicopters with their running lights on.Under the helicopters were slung large steel cables with something very big hanging"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"under each aircraft. He could not get a good view of what it was, since the treelineobstructed his view. He then saw the two helicopters hover above the end of themain runway at Westhampton and slowly lower whatever it was to the ground. Theentire operation lasted 45 minutes. He could not see what the activity was on theground and the helicopters had landed by that time. In August of 1990, he contacted LIUFON and filed a report with us. He has notcontacted us since. In the last conversation, he told us that he had learned fromfriends of his brother-in-law that the Westhampton Volunteer Rescue Squad hadbeen involved in this incident, but refused to discuss it with us. He did not want toget his brother-in-law's friends in trouble. The particulars remain a mystery. If John D. is correct in his observations, he might have solved the one problem withthe whole incident. What happened to the structural wreckage? How was it takenout of the Bay with very little public attention for an object so big and heavy? In the discussions held with the Brookhaven Laboratory scientist who was involvedin the incident, he told LIUFON that the massive object weighed very little, sincethe metal was very strong and light. Maybe light enough for two helicopters to carryit out of the water? THE CONVOY ON WILLIAM FLOYD PARKWAY, 4:30 AM, 9/29/89 During the course of the two and a half years investigating the case, three witnessesclaim they saw a late night convoy from Smith's Point Beach up William FloydParkway to Brookhaven Laboratories. One woman who lives opposite the main entrance of the Laboratory told LIUFONanonymously that she saw a convoy around 4:30 AM that morning composed ofmilitary flatbed trucks pulling into the main gate. It was escorted by jeeps and policecars which blocked off both directions of the highway to allow the convoy to enter. Two sisters who live in Shirley along William Floyd Parkway related to LIUFONthat they observed from their kitchen windows around 4:30 or 5:00 AM a convoy oftrucks composed of military vehicles and flatbed trucks with a police escort headingup William Floyd Parkway going North. This would be in the direction of theBrookhaven National Laboratories. So far, there has been no official confirmation by authorities concerning thisincident. GEORGE DICKSON'S STORY, 10/4/89 George Dickson is an amateur anthropologist and also known on Long Island for hisindependent UFO research. On October 4, 1989, George contacted LIUFON to inform the organization that hehad information on an incident that had occurred a few days before over MorichesBay. At this point in the investigation, LIUFON had not revealed the existence ofthe Peterson story and the photographs. George related a story he had received from a friend who is an Air Force colonelattached to Air Force Intelligence at the Pentagon. According to his friend, therehad been a UFO incident over Moriches Bay on September 28, 1989. The (Moriches Bay, Long Island) incident involved the downing of a UFO by theuse of a U. S. Star Wars weapon on that night (September 28, 1989). The craftcrashed into the Dune area where it was subsequently retrieved. There had also beenfatalities among the military personnel, some 18, in fact, who were killed when thealiens retaliated upon the downing of their alien craft. He related the fatalities wereincurred by the use of a weapon which generates extremely low frequency soundwaves which can destroy the molecular cohesiveness of known matter. Some ofthese fatalities were psychics who were there to be used to communicate with thealien occupant survivors if needed. George Dickson never revealed the name of his source and never will. He has stuckby the story and maintains the source is impeccable. COPELY NEWS SERVICE, SAN DIEGO, 10/22/89 Copely News Service acquires news programming for some 178 radio stationsaround the United States and Canada. On October 21, 1989, LIUFON had broken"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"the story to the local news media and had alerted them to the incident. On October22, LIUFON had conducted a field search operation in the Dunes with a ground, seaand air team. It had produced some promising results. That afternoon, Copely News Service contacted John Ford to confirm that they hadverified from the police and Coast Guard that there had been helicopters in thevicinity of Moriches Bay the night of September 28, 1989. They were going to runthe story nationally for syndicated pickup. It seems they had a special impetus for doing the story. When they contacted theSuffolk County Police Headquarters in Yaphank by phone, the responding publicrelations officer admitted there had been a UFO incident over the Bay. A follow-up phone call later received an official denial to the previous statement. Itappears there might have been an unintentional leak that was quickly covered up. THE FIELD INVESTIGATION IN THE DUNES, 10/11/89 On October 22, 1989, a team was dispatched to investigate the area of the Dunesalong Smith's Point Beach. It was a three-pronged effort composed of a land, seaand air search. The team was composed of LIUFON investigators: John Ford, KellyFreeman, Ron Sierra, Lou Mattera, and Bruce and Martha Richardson. Assistingwere members George Dickson and Frank Valenti. The following is what they found: 1) The air team in a light plane observed, from an altitude of 2500 feet, a circularformation of depressed marsh grass on an island in the mouth of Moriches Bay. Thiswas first thought to be a possible landing circle for a second object that thehelicopters might have been searching for in the Inlet's entrance. It was later ruledout as such by the fact that it was caused by the heavy tidal action near the Inlet'sentrance at high tide. 2) The field team searched the Dunes for part of the day. They could not find animpact area for a possible crash site along the length of the Dunes. Kelly Freemanand Lou Mattera did discover, on a peninsula which protrudes into the Bay side ofthe Dune area, a 75 foot diameter circle of depressed bushes and vegetation whichappeared to be dead. The area showed signs of heavy tire tracks and was recessedslightly into the side of a large dune. From the seaward side, it would have been hardto see, and access to that area was by four wheel vehicle over a dirt road track in theDunes. It was videotaped and photographed by Kelly Freeman. This circle was also thought suspicious and might have been a landing circle. Thevegetation, however, was not burned or dechlorophyled as would be expected in alanding site. It, too, was thought to be the object of the helicopter flights over theDunes. It would soon be found to be something else. 3) The sea team, headed by Martha and Bruce Richardson, cruised the Dunesshoreline. They videotaped the area and could find no evidence of a crash-site orany area of burned vegetation. The investigation could find no evidence of a fire or impact site of a crash along theDunes. The aerial team of John Ford and Ron Sierra flew the length of the Dunes tothe Westhampton side and found nothing that could bolster the story given GeorgeDickson by his contact. In April, things developed that would change the direction of the investigation. Oneof them was Kathy O'Donnelly's story and the first meeting with the scientist fromBrookhaven Laboratories. THE PHOTO ANALYSIS The Peterson photographs were obtained for scientific analysis and study. Theoriginal negatives were sent out to have high grain copies of the photographs madefor evaluation. When developed, the series of 30 photographs from two disc wheelsshow a pattern of amber lights over the Bay. The pattern is sometimes in a triangularformation. Other sequences show only one or two lights while others show three.The only light source in any of the pictures are the amber lights (one photographshows the searchlight of one of the helicopters). Ron Sierra, who is by trade an engineer with access to microscopic equipment, didan examination of the negatives for LIUFON. Ron is also an amateur photographerand a Viet Nam era helicopter pilot with many hours in combat flight operations."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Ron's report on his examination of the negatives reveals this: 1) He could not locate a smoke trail on any of the lights on any of the negatives ofthe pictures. 2) The lights are not flares. 3) The computer analysis shows the amber lights to be sources of \"Cold Light\"emissions. This translates into one thing: the computer showed that the lights gaveoff no heat. Bob has also shown the pictures to Dr. Bruce Maccabee for his opinion. He hasstated to LIUFON that Bruce has looked at the pictures and has suggested furtherwork should be done on them. As of this writing, LIUFON hopes to have supportfrom the Fund for UFO Research to do extensive work on the pictures in the Fall of1991. THE SOVIET SATELLITE CRASH STORY Mr. Joseph Z. is an electronic engineer who is employed by A. I. L. Electronics onLong Island. He claims he had access to classified government records. Hecontacted LIUFON by phone and informed us he had uncovered some interestinginformation concerning the Moriches Bay incident. He informed us that he had heard of the Moriches Bay incident from severalnewspaper sources and wondered if there was anything on government computernets that would give any insight into the incident. He accessed three Pentagoncomputer systems the next day, and in two of them, dealt with Quarter Mastersupply and allocations. This is a run down of what Mr. Joseph Z. said he found: 1) On or about 11:00 PM, a fire was reported in subject dune area. Fire Dept. truckswere dispatched and flashing blue lights were, in fact, visible from sighting area.These were emitted by Fire Department trucks. Wreckage was reported to thecommanding officer by Fire Dept. personnel, who were instructed to disperse. 2) No weapons were deployed by any government agency. 3) The Suffolk County police were informed by an anonymous telephone caller thata vessel was in distress and police helicopters were deployed. The local Coast Guardunit was informed and assisted in the search. 4) Prior to the incident, NAVSYCOM had been tracking a polar-orbiting satellitewith a decaying elliptical orbit. Said device was assumed to be powered byfissionable material and considered a radiation hazard. 5) Portions of said satellite survived atmospheric impact and, in fact, were believedto be the cause of the fire. 6) Seven U. S Coast Guard helicopters were fitted with tethered halogen lightsources at the request of the Office of Foreign Technology. Two of these wereequipped with infra-red viewing equipment. 7) Naval personnel accompanied Coast Guard pilots and suited up to precludeexposure to radiation. 8) Helicopters hovered over the area to provide illumination only. Parachute flareswere dropped initially to close the window of the affected area, which includes theSouth by Southeast portion of the Bay. The lights augmented the flares and were ofhigh intensity. All water impacting elements were fragmented by the sudden changein temperature and deemed unrecoverable. 9) A thorough radiometric survey was carried out by military personnel and allremnants on land were recovered. Radio communication was established to deployland transport vehicles near the site. Four flatbed trucks were deployed and twowere sent back without a payload to an undisclosed location. 10) Army ATVs equipped with winches and 4WD were deployed to the location. Sixlight-armament vehicles were also called in."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"11) A command/control aircraft circled the area at high altitude in a figure-8 pattern. 12) Remnants were transported to a nearby parking field, then loaded ontowide-load flatbed trucks. Smaller fragments were tagged and transported byunmarked vans. 13) Said trucks were tarped with leaded woven material and escorted to BrookhavenNational Laboratories via William Floyd Parkway. The local police were instructedto reroute traffic at 4:22 AM on September 29, 1989, because of the potentialradiation hazard. 14) Remnants were unloaded and secured by 7:20 AM that morning under navalintelligence directive and supervised by army personnel. 15) Said military helicopters were dispatched from an undisclosable location inConnecticut and a similar search operation was implemented there around the SouthShore of Connecticut, based on impact data extrapolation just prior to this event.Tethered halogen lighting was used here also. 16) Implied weapon referred to was an electronic power generator acquired from acommercial source, but modified for 400 Hz 3-phase output. It was used for siteoperating power only. 17) Both civilian and military personnel were involved in the recovery operation,which was classified and remains so. 18) Radioisotope elements were removed from the wreckage at Brookhaven andplaced in secure storage for disposal as waste. Remaining wreckage was transportedto an undisclosable location for examination by Office of Foreign Technology onOctober 30, 1989. 19) Portions of said wreckage were identified as Soviet, including part of a Ku-Bandtransmitter and image processing circuitry. The information at face value seems to explain the entire incident as a routinerecovery of Soviet space debris mounted in a few hours to recover a few chunks ofmetal that were later identified as a Soviet transmitter and radiological waste.(Leonard H. Stringfield's comment: Joseph Z's information is nonsense.) If one looks closely, one discerns loopholes in the information. It does not explainaway the sightings in Kings Park, Gardner Manor State Park, Calverton, Box TreeLane, the 2:30 AM incident in Quogue or the numerous other incidents. Theeyewitness account by the fisherman in the Dunes which made no mention ofmilitary personnel or vehicles seems to contradict even the secret Pentagon report.The search team reported no signs of any fires in the Dunes. None of the witnessesinterviewed reported seeing or hearing any fire engines at 11:00 PM that nightduring the incident. The blue lights were supposedly the fire vehicles in the Dunesafter 11:00 PM, yet Peterson saw it beginning at 9:10 PM and would contradict thereport in that respect. The numerous sightings in Connecticut and Long Island involving dozens ofwitnesses who all reported a silent dark mass behind the lights, all reported the samething, not a helicopter. If one believes Kathy and Kevin O'Donnelly correctly, thisCoast Guard helicopter with tethered lights was as big as a potato field ten acresacross. It was also totally silent. When Phil Imbrogno was asked to check this story out with colleagues in theGreenwich Observatory in Connecticut, he reported that based on published NASAsatellite tracking reports, there were no Soviet satellites over the Eastern seaboardthat would have placed it over Moriches Bay in a decaying orbit. The report does spell out a military-intelligence operation occurring in the watersand dunes of Moriches Bay that night. It could be that this was a second cover storyplanted in case the first one concerning the sinking boat failed, or if Freedom ofInformation Act requests had to be answered. THE MAGNETIC DISTURBANCE IN THE BAY During the past two years, LIUFON has received three reports from commercial andsports fishermen from the area of Moriches Bay. The commercial fisherman had to change his ship's compass because it would not"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"work in the middle of the Bay. The other two sports fishermen reported the sameoccurrence on their pleasure boats. This occurred near the mouth of Moriches Inlet. One of the fishermen reported that his Timex watch stopped for over an hour whilehis compass spun around like atop in his ship's cabin. All of these events occurred after the September 28, 1989, incident. They alloccurred in a space of four months of each other. They all occurred near the site ofthe supposed crash-site of the UFO in the Bay. LIUFON can think of no naturalphenomena to explain these incidents. THE MEETINGS WITH THE SCIENTIST The identity of the scientist who was involved in the Moriches Bay incident hasbeen a closely kept secret by the Network. His name and address must remain asecret, since he has already been threatened by the government who suspected himas the leak in the case. He first came to LIUFON's attention when his close friend, George Dickson, whoapproached the organization on October 29, 1990, to inform John Ford of hisexistence. George informed Ford he was in contact with a scientist who wasinvolved in the recovery of the Moriches Bay object. Dickson stated further theperson in question would be willing to talk to LIUFON at a later date, especiallywhen things cooled down and there was less attention focused on the scientist'sactivities and associates. As the investigation continued and public statements by LIUFON issued concerningthe incidents brought more witnesses to the forefront of the investigation, contactwith the scientist was delayed by the heavy investigation schedule. It was not untilApril 1990, that arrangements were made to interview and speak with the scientist. The ground rules that were made were strict and were set by the scientist. Theywere upheld by the Network as a basis for the interviews and the continuingdialogue which has been maintained by the organization with him. They included no permission to tape record his interviews or to disclose his identityto the public. He did permit, on two occasions, John Ford to speak with him and totake notes. For further discussion, he will be referred to in this report as 'Dr. Nick.' this is thecover identity which has been assigned to him in our files. Dr. Nick insisted the first meeting be held at Ford's residence in the Patchogue, NewYork, area. On an April 1990, Sunday evening, the first meeting took place. Therewere no witnesses to the meeting as per his instructions. The second meeting tookplace on an evening in August 1990, again at Ford's residence where there wasanother witness to the conversation. This was Kay Ford, Secretary and Treasurer forLIUFON. The following items are a summary of the information produced from the twomeetings: 1) Dr. Nick stated at both meetings, the United States intercepted and brought downa wedge-shaped or boomerang-shaped UFO over Moriches Bay on the night ofSeptember 28, 1989. He knows this for a fact because he and members of hisengineering tam were present at the incident. 2) The crash occurred around 12:00 AM or a little later (September 28, 1989). Hedid not know the precise minute, but gave this time reference as the time of theoccurrence. 3) He has been involved in the study of crashed UFOs since the 1970s for the UnitedStates government. He was first employed to study the electronics of recoveredUFOs at Wright-Patterson AFB in the top security underground facility known as'S-3' where crashed UFOs are stored. His study of one of three recovered UFOs convinced him that their electronicsindicated that their technology was far in advance of anything envisioned here onEarth. He stated he discovered the technology to be crystalline-based using immensecrystals as focusing elements for the propulsion drive of the craft. He stated thedrive for the craft are 'anti-gravity' in nature and the crystals help in tuning in theright frequencies for the drive to work."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" The evidence of their electronics indicates the wide use of crystals in theirinstrumentalities which indicates that one or several crystals perform entirefunctions of computer chips.
