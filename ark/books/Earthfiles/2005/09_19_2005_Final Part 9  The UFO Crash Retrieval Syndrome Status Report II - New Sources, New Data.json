Here begins Part 9of Status Report II, written in January 1980. The series of status reports, I through VII,were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report IIIbegins at Earthfiles. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. For all theprevious status reports, see Earthfiles Archives. Leonard H. Stringfield: \"ITEM B-13 In my first UFO crash/retrieval paper I made brief reference to an alleged violentincident occurred in the Spring of 1977 in southwestern Ohio which involved anencounter between a landed or disabled alien craft and its crew and a U. S. militarydetachment dispatched to the site. Since it made news and drew inquiry, the townnearest the site has been identified as Lumberton, on Highway 68, southeast ofXenia, Ohio and Wright-Patterson AFB. Lumberton, Ohio, southeast of Xenia and Wright-Patterson AFB,where human/alien shootout allegedly occurred in spring of 1977.The incident is one of violence, ending in a western-style shoot-out. Word was that itresulted in 11 American casualties and an unknown number of aliens deaths. To addfuel to this story, which emanated from a research group in Pennsylvania, I learnedfrom another source in Cincinnati that a person working in an 'off limits' area atWright-Patterson claims to have seen 'bodies on litters' arriving at the base duringthe same time frame. Researchers involved in the investigation of this sensitive incident prefer anonymity.It all began when a respected researcher in Pittsburgh overheard the story during aluncheon from an engineer who worked for the city's school system. He, in turn,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"knew of another person who was supposed to have been involved somehow in themacabre experience. But the key person, despite repeated attempts, could never bereached. Bob Pratt, a respected reporter for the National Enquirer, also tried topursue the case and hunt down the key source. He, too, talked with the secondhandsource, but he would not reveal the identity of the principal source. In October 1977, I also tried to get a lead by calling many law enforcement agenciescovering three counties. I got nowhere. It is understandable, if this case is true, thatit would be kept under the tightest security. ITEM B-14 February 12, 1979, was a day like all days in my quest for a new material relative tothe UFO crash/retrieval syndrome. I had called David Mannweiller, columnist forthe Indianapolis News who featured a story about an anonymous source withinformation about the recovery of an alien body from a saucer crash in 1948. Hepromised he would try and arrange an interview, but his source dried up. I also got a call from a New York reporter for The Village Voice who desired aninterview with me for an article concerning my UFO crash/retrieval material. Thisalso vaporized. And there were other calls, but the real eye opener came aboutmidnight from Larry Moyers, State Director of Ohio for MUFON in Akron. Moyerspardoned his late call, and as I tried to recover from a half sleep, he jolted me withnews so extraordinary that I was not sure if I were in a dram. Moyers had just anhour earlier received a call from a person named Ron Johnson who made the claimthat he had recovered a small humanoid body appearing to be injured, but still alive,from a roadside while driving through the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania.Confused as what to do next, he put the creature into his car and rove on. About 3hours later, when he stopped to check the body, he found it motionless andpresumed that it was dead. Johnson described the creature as humanoid, about 3 feet tall, without nose and onlyone ear. The other ear appeared to have been sheared off. The biped covered with adowny fuzz, had only three fingers with webbing in between, and the feet were'neither left nor right, not in the sense that humans are.' A metallic cloth covered theentire body. Johnson's main concern, said Moyers, was his fear of legalconsequences for allowing the entity to die while in his possession without notifyingthe police. In desperation, he drove on to his home in Akron and placed the cadaverinto a deep freezer. Johnson explained that he had remembered hearing of a localUFO research group and finally got Moyer's telephone number and called him foradvice. Because of the lateness of the hour and fatigue, he agreed to see Moyersearly the next morning and gave him his address and phone number. Moyers whowas concerned called me. My advice, in the play against time, was for Larry and a trusted friend to go toJohnson's at the earliest next day. Take a camera, I suggested, to photograph avariety of shots of Johnson and his cadaver as proof. Then call an attorney and amedical doctor for their expertise. In the meantime, I told Moyers I would head forAkron and be on hand to advise the authorities, key researchers and the media. But,Larry and I both smelled a hoax. Early the next morning, Moyers joined by Mike Candusso got to Johnson's house asplanned. While parking to check the house number, they saw two women leavingthe house. When asked if they knew Ron Johnson, both said they never heard ofhim. Then Moyers checked the neighbors. No one knew of Johnson. Moyers thenphoned the number given him by Johnson. To his dismay, the phone had beendisconnected. When Moyers called me to explain his dilemma, I too called the'Johnson' number. Said the Operator: 'The number you have dialed has beendisconnected temporarily at the customer's request.' Hoax? Probably. Who is the real Ron Johnson? Was his game a ploy to test Moyerswith an ulterior motive? And why was the phone number he gave Moyersdisconnected and on whose request? Hoaxes, although rare, and other inexplicableacts are not new to me and others investigating mysteries of the crash/retrievalsyndrome. Another case in point, and so typical of following a new lead, involved adentist in Bloomington, Indiana, to whom I was referred as having UFOcrash/retrieval information. When I called the dentist he recalled that his brother, aretired Navy Captain in Washington, D. C., had discussed with him several yearsbefore his part in the transportation of a crashed alien craft. Seeming eager to help,he gave me his brother's phone number. But when I called the retired Navy Captain,he said he did not remember ever talking about such an affair with his brother."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"There are many other leads bearing promise of information to come by mail, a returnphone call, or a visit. Weeks, months, a year might pass. So often the response isnothing; a silence rooted in fears of reprisal or ridicule; or a desire for privacy - orall three combined. This is understandably human. Indeed, I feel privileged to knowwhat I do know and for what I can relate. This is my inspiration. I hope to learn stillmore with new leads now on hand, and if I persist with patience in this endeavor. PART III: STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF UFO CRASH/RETRIEVAL EVENTS 1. Chronology of UFO Crash/Retrieval Events Known By Year Statistics, it must be emphasized, about reported UFO crash/retrieval events areinadequate and perhaps misleading. In the main, for this analysis, I have used onlythe sources who can identify the year of the event. Informants in this category rangefrom the firsthand source to those less credible. There are also many reports, evenfrom good sources, with no year affixed to the event and thus are not included inthis report. The total number of reported events for any one year might describe asingle event rather than isolated events. A breakdown by years follows. Year and Number of Reports Prehistoric 1WWII 11947 31948 3 1950 31952 81953 71957 11962 21964 31965 11965-1968 31973 1 1974 11975 21977 31978 41979 2 TOTAL: 49 The most interesting feature is that the preponderance of reported UFOcrash/retrieval events out of a total of 49 occurred in the 1950s, a total of 19 reports,followed by 9 in the 1970s, 8 in the 1960s, and 7 in the 1940s. These figures indicatethat there were more UFO crash/retrieval events in the 1950s, which suggests that ineach of the two decades following, the news about the event has been moreeffectively controlled, or that a later model of the alleged alien craft has overcome atechnical vulnerability to Earth's geological or atmospheric or human interferences. 2. Geographic Distribution of Reported UFO Crash/Retrieval Events This cursory analysis concerns C/R reports worldwide from general sources,including those with the year of the event unknown. Again, insufficient data obscurethe few credible firsthand reports. From all these diverse sources, I am aware of 16reports allegedly occurring outside the continental limits of the United States. Threeof these, according to a C.I.A. employee, occurred in Russia, two in CommunistChina. Compared with the 16 reports outside the USA are 27 allegedly occurring inside itsboundaries. The figure 27, however, is ambiguous as it might include more than onesource describing the same incident. For instance, in 1947, I have three separatesources probably describing the same incident. This also holds true for 1948, wherethree independent sources might all describe a single event. Further analysis shows,according to general information reaching me, that 17 of the 27 events haveoccurred west of the Mississippi River and 10 east of the Mississippi. Many reports of C/R events in the U.S. are not included in this analysis as no site forthe incident is known. For instance, an alleged alien craft having been seen in an AirForce hangar, or a body in deep-freeze, is not a statistical entry. In consideration ofall C/R material available, it would only be a guess as to the true number of actual"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"events occurring in the United States. At one time, I guessed at a dozen incidents.But perhaps this is just the tip of the iceberg. On the other hand, if only one or twoincidents have substance, then there still would be justification for another StatusReport. 3. Chronology of Crash/Retrieval Events World War II: England.

(Item B-14)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" EPILOGUE Who, in our world, is this strange little mortal of human configuration? Is the UFOcrash/retrieval syndrome and its tandem, the humanoid, a part of a grand weirdhoax, or an officially or privately contrived deception? Hardly. Assuming that thebiped does exist, and my Status Reports assume just that, then is the little 'monster'an experimental creation conceived by a clandestine earthly laboratory? Hardly. Oragain, assuming that all my informants are correct, is the creature with anoverdeveloped head and atrophied body and limbs a distant relative of primordialman whose beginnings share a common cradle? Or is the creature, born in space anddeveloped through a parallel chemistry akin to the Homo sapiens, in an advancedstate of evolutionary regression? And finally, guessing again, we might ask if 'it' is aclone developed for tactical and expendable purposes by a higher order ofextraterrestrial intelligence? Whatever the state of its alleged existence, the entity is alien to man. Until more isknown, we can only hope that the alien's large head might manifest a high enoughintelligence to allow for its intentions to be merely curious and not hostile. With thepaucity of reliable, firsthand information, I believe that the suggested use of a graphby which I could show the physiological details reported by each witness can offerlittle for qualitative analytical purposes. Perhaps the best graphic illustration iscontained in the attached composite sketch conceived out of the data from themedical doctor who performed an autopsy. Leonard H. StringfieldCincinnati, OhioOctober 29, 1979\" \"Drawing of humanoid based on information received from medical doctor who performed autopsy.Data, concerning relative size of head, torso and limbs, and other details, were gathered over a periodofseveral months in 1979, during which time four separate drawings were submitted for comment. On myfirst drawing,he drew a heavy ridge of brow over the eyes, and indicated less length of neck and less droopingshoulders.After third drawing, he commented, 'Check a 5-month fetus to get proportionate size of head and body.'For the final rendition above, he said, 'The proportions are right.'
