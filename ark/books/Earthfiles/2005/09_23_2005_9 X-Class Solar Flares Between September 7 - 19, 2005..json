The sun is like a bignuclear fusion reactor that gives light and heat to the planets. Even at 93 million milesfrom the sun, the temperatures can support life from the icy poles to the hot equator.Scientists who have studied ice cores report that long before the current Industrial Age'semissions of greenhouse gases linked to global warming, there have been many cycles ofheating and cooling on the planet. Could it be that the so-called Solar Constant is not soconstant? Could cycles in the sun ranging from lots of sunspots and big solar flares to fewsunspots and small solar flares have more to do with Earth temperatures than originallythought?In March 2003, NASA reported that since the late 1970s, the amount of solar radiation thesun emits, during times of quiet sunspot activity, has increased by nearly .05% per decade.The author of the study published in Geophysical Research Letters, Richard Wilson,Ph.D., at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies and Columbia University's EarthInstitute said: \"This trend is important because, if sustained over many decades, it couldcause significant climate change. Historical records of solar activity indicate that solarradiation has been increasing since the late 19th Century. If a trend comparable to the onefound in this study persisted throughout the 20th century, it would have provided asignificant component of the global warming over the past 100 years.\"The solar cycle most of us have heard about is the Solar Maximum and Solar Minimumwhich averages 11 years. Back in the mid-1990s was the last Solar Minimum wheresunspots were low in number. Now in 2005 to 2006, the sun is again supposed to be atSolar Minimum. But in February this year and most recently in September, there havebeen large X-class solar flares. In fact the fifth most intense solar flare on record occurredon September 7, followed by eight more large X-class flares over the next twelve days.What was astounding to solar physicists is that all of the X-class flares came from thesame sunspot! In August it was called 798. As it traveled behind the sun for a couple ofweeks, it grew stronger and as it emerged for the first time again on the eastern limb of thesun with the new name \"808,\" it let loose with the huge X-17 Coronal Mass Ejection(CME) that caused problems with GPS systems, caused a complete blackout of HF radiotransmissions on the daylight side of Earth, and produced Northern Lights all the way toArizona. By September 19, sunspot 808 had ejected eight more X-class solar flares for atotal of nine in twelve days.Red Northern Lights over Payson, Arizona, on September 11, 2005.Photo © 2005 by Chris Schur.What amazed solar physicists was the amount of solar energy that impacted Earth from theX-17 flare that was on the far eastern limb of the sun, just emerging from the backside. Itis assumed that energetic particles from the sun travel along magnetic field lines. The X-17flare was pointing far away from the Earth. According to NASA solar physicist, DavidHathaway, Ph.D., the implication is that the energetic particles from the huge flare had to\"cross a lot of magnetic field lines to reach the Earth with so much intensity. These"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"observations of intense solar radiation (on Earth after the September 7, 2005, X-17 flare)are not easily incorporated into standard models of how radiation moves through the solarsystem.\"On Sept. 7, 2005, at 1740 UT (1:40 p.m. EDT), Earth-orbiting satellites detected a major X-17 class solarflarecoming from the sun's eastern limb. The blast caused a complete blackout of HF radio transmissionson the daylight side of Earth.

The Solar Physics Group Leader at NASA Marshall Space FlightCenter in Huntsville, Alabama, is David Hathaway, Ph.D. He was monitoring sunspot 798even while it was behind the sun with sound and x-rays.Interview:David Hathaway, Ph.D., Solar Physics Group Leader, NASA Marshall Space FlightCenter, Huntsville, Alabama: \"When we first saw it back in August, it had just startedgrowing on the disk of the sun. As the sun rotates in about 27 days, it disappeared off thewestern edge of the sun as you view the sun in the sky, it rotated to the back side. Weknew it was still big on the back side because we could still see effects on the sound waveson the sun. When it came back around even before we could see it on the eastern limb ofthe sun, it was flaring. You could see x-rays coming from the upper parts of loops evenbefore we could actually see the sunspot itself. As it rotated into view, we could see that itwas continuing to grow in size. In fact, it looked like part of the reason it is energetic andproducing solar flares is that new magnetic loops had popped up where the old ones wereand they were terribly tangled up. It's a complicated situation as far as the magnetic fieldsand that is always a major ingredient toward producing things like large solar flares andCoronal Mass Ejections (CMEs).I UNDERSTAND IT IS A LITTLE LIKE WINDING UP RUBBER BANDS ANDLETTING THEM SNAP?A bit. Magnetic fields are very much like rubberbands, except they don't break the sameway. A magnetic field never has a loose end, but a magnetic field can be short circuited ifyou twist them so they cross. Where they cross, they can re-connect there and form twoloops instead of one. In the process, they give off a great deal of energy equivalent tomillions of megatons of TNT. An Oddly Active Solar Minimum"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"With Very Few SunspotsSINCE I TALKED WITH YOU IN FEBRUARY 2005 ABOUT ALL THE SOLARFLARES THAT WERE COMING THEN FROM WHAT WAS KNOWN AS SUNSPOT720. AND NOW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AUGUST TO SEPTEMBER 2005, JUST AFEW MONTHS LATER ABOUT SUNSPOT 798 AND 808 BEING SO ACTIVE ANDENDING UP WITH THE 5TH LARGEST FLARE ON RECORD.This cycle seems to be a little odd. I say that with reservations because in terms of lookingat x-rays, we've only been doing it for about 30 years now. So, we don't have a lot ofexperience dealing with how many x-ray type flares occur during a cycle. But this one isdefinitely very different from the last two (Solar Minimum cycles) in having a lot ofactivity down as it's increasing toward Solar Minimum and still producing a lot of bigflares.Certainly it raises questions about whether this cycle is different from others with regardsto these explosive events, to the big flares. But what appears to be the odd thing this cycleis that even though the number of sunspots are small and the total area of the sun coveredin spots is small as it is headed toward minimum, the spots are still producing lots of flaresand lots of big flares.Sunspot counts and X-flares during the last three solar cycles. Note how solar activity continueseven during Solar Minimum. Graphic courtesy David Hathaway, NASA/NSSTC. More Tangled Magnetic Fields On Sun?WHAT'S THE SPECULATION OR HYPOTHESIS ABOUT WHY THIS IS HAPPENING?My first guess would be that the magnetic fields that we know are the cause of theseflares, are just more complicated for some reason in the spots this time around than theywere, for example, in the decline of the last solar cycle back in the mid to late 1990s.WHAT WOULD MAKE THE MAGNETIC FIELDS MORE COMPLICATED?I don't know! (laughs) That's an excellent question. The way that sunspots are formed isthat groups of magnetic fields rise up from deep inside the sun. When they erupt throughthe surface, they make sunspots and being loops, you'll have one set of spots where you'llhave the field coming out of the sun. Then there will be another set of spots where themagnetic fields are going into the sun. It looks like that's what we had for this region whenit was 798 when we first saw it on the sun.It looks like what happened, as I interpret the data, is another loop came up in the samespot and the two of them have been 'fighting' and crossing their magnetic field lines andexploding in the process. So, I think that's what appears to have happened in this particularcase.IS IT STRANGE ENOUGH THAT YOU AND OTHER SOLAR PHYSICISTS ARETALKING ABOUT THIS AND COMPARING NOTES ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BEHAPPENING AND WHERE ALL OF THIS MIGHT BE HEADED?Indeed, yes. My own group here, we're having a meeting on Wednesday morning and partof the reason is to talk about this sunspot group, what happened to it and see if we canunderstand it."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"WHERE IS 808 RIGHT NOW?It's just about off the western edge of the sun again. It's decreased a lot in size the past 4 or5 days, so it looks like it's on its decline now. But the last time we saw it rotate off thewestern edge of the sun, it was growing in size. this time, it's getting smaller. There havebeen flares in the last few days, but they haven't been the big X class flares that we sawearlier. So, it looks like it's going to slowly decay away and we might not see much left ofit two weeks from now when it comes back around again. Rare to Have 9 X-Class Solar Flares from Same SunspotHAS THERE EVER BEEN A TIME IN SOLAR RECORDS IN WHICH THERE HAVEBEEN NINE X-CLASS SOLAR FLARES BETWEEN SAY SEPTEMBER 7 AND THE19TH, THAT'S ONLY TWELVE DAYS?Since we've only been observing x-rays from the sun like this for the last 30 years and wehave only 3 cycles to look at. If we look at those three cycles, this one is different. There isno doubt about it. But that does not say there was not a similar cycle like this in theprevious three or ten cycles. That's where having just a small number to look at, it's hard toreach conclusions about how odd this might be.IF THIS IS DIFFERENT AT THE END OF 2005 AS WE GO INTO 2006, AND 2006TECHNICALLY IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE BOTTOM OF THE CYCLE, THE MOSTMINIMUM. WHAT IS YOUR PROJECTION NOW FOR WHAT THE NEXT SOLARMAXIMUM MIGHT BE LIKE BY 2010, 2011, and 2012?That's an excellent question. If you ask me my own opinion, I'll give you one answer. Ifyou ask another solar astronomer, you're apt to get another answer. In fact, my ownimpression in looking at the solar phenomena that I do look at to try to tell me what isgoing to happen for the next cycle, I think it's going to be a big cycle.But some of my colleagues looking at other characteristics of the sun think it's going to bea small Solar Maximum. And this has traditionally been a very difficult thing within solarphysics: predicting the size of the next Solar Maximum. Once a cycle has started, we'reusually pretty good. But before they start, it's traditionally been very difficult to predict thesize of them. Earth Damage From Large Solar FlaresIF THIS NEXT SOLAR MAXIMUM IS REALLY BIG AND HAS LOTS OF X-CLASSFLARES IN IT, HOW MUCH DAMAGE COULD BE DONE TO OUR ENTIREGLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM AND SATELLITES?The satellite makers are getting better at designing their instruments to be somewhatsafeguarded from the effects of solar flares. But nonetheless, the energetic particles thatthe sun produces in the process of producing solar flares can take out electronics onsatellites. If it's a big cycle, the Earth's atmosphere expands as it heats up and causessatellite drag which can bring down satellites earlier than their prescribed lifetimes. If it's abig cycle, we're apt to see more of that. As far as satellite losing electronics that totallydisable them and also satellites that de-orbit, spiral into the Earth's atmosphere earlier thanexpected.The danger comes from the radiation itself and what it does to electronic components. It'snot so much that it melts things, but you get energetic particles - protons and alphaparticles, helium nuclei - that can go crashing through electronic components and knockaround atoms within the component and destroy their functionality.THEN, THE SIGNIFICANCE OF OUR LOOKING AT A SOLAR MAXIMUM INWHICH THERE MIGHT BE A LOT OF BIG X-FLARES UPCOMING IN THE NEXT 6TO 8 YEARS, IS THAT IF IT IS REALLY INTENSE, IT'S THE NUMBER OFENERGETIC PARTICLES THAT WILL BE IMPACTING THE SATELLITES ANDTHAT IS WHAT COULD DO DAMAGE?Ye s .WHAT ABOUT MAGNETIC FIELDS THEMSELVES. WE KNOW THAT AURORASARE CAUSED BY GEOMAGNETIC STORMS. IS THE CORONAL MASS EJECTIONAND ITS INTERACTION WITH THE EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD DOES THAT"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MAGNETIC FIELD DISRUPTION CAUSE PROBLEMS?Certainly it does. Not only does it cause beautiful things like the auroras, it can causedamaging things such as surge occurrence in power lines that can take out transformersand big circuit breakers in big power distribution systems so you can get black outs due tosome of the big flares.SO, WORST CASE WOULD BE WHAT?Worst case would be something like we saw back in March of 1989 where there was a $10million transformer in New Jersey that was literally fried by the surge of current throughpower lines. And the province of Quebec in Canada lost power. There were some peoplethere who did not have power restored for 6 days in the end of winter there. Worst caseare things like that happening. Again, there is the loss of satellites that occurs when bigflares go off.DOES A LOT OF THE DAMAGE FLARES CAN DO USUALLY RELATE TO THEEXACT DIRECTION THAT THE SUNSPOT IS IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE EARTH?Yes, it does. But the mystery about the big one (September 7, 2005) is that the X-17 flarehappened just as the spot was coming into view. You can think of it as aiming away fromus, aiming out toward the side. The fact that we saw a big increase in the radiationenvironment around the Earth from it that was even more of a surprise than seeing theflare itself the fact that it occurred in a position on the sun that does not normally influenceus. And yet in this case, it certainly did.IF THE X-17 FLARE HAD BEEN AIMED DIRECTLY AT THE EARTH, WHAT DOYOU THINK WOULD HAVE HAPPENED?They would be seeing aurora in Florida! (laughs) Will Next Solar Maximum Have Lots of Sunspots andFlares?Or Will It Be Exceptionally Mild?WHEN WILL WE KNOW IF THE SUN IS GOING TO BE A MAXIMUM WITH LOTSOF X SOLAR FLARES,, OR THE OPPOSITE THEORY THAT IT MIGHT BECOMEEXCEPTIONALLY QUIET?We ought to have a better measurement about the next solar cycle within the next coupleof years. Even within the next year, if we start to see lots of new spots as in a new cyclecoming out as minimum approaches, then that is a good indicator that the next cycle willbe a large and active cycle.On the other hand, there are these strange things that we don't quite understand. In thiscase, we have a cycle that is not so big when you look at current sunspot numbers or areasof other solar activity. Yet, if you look at flares, it's been quite active.THAT IS THE PUZZLE TO SOLAR PHYSICISTS RIGHT NOW?That's the puzzle at the moment: Why is such a wimpy Solar Minimum cycle, with only afew sunspots, so strong when it comes to making flares?\"More Information: In 1645 to 1715, the solar activity reached the so-called \"Maunder-minimum.\" In fact,astronomers reported not seeing any sunspots for some period of time. [ Editor's Note: The \"Maunder Minimum\" is the name given to the period roughlyfrom 1645 to 1715 A.D., when sunspots became exceedingly rare, as noted by solarobservers of the time. It is named after the later solar astronomer, E.W. Maunderwho discovered the lack of sunspots. Records from that time include one 30-yearperiod in which only fifty sunspots were reported in contrast to a more normallyexpected forty to fifty thousand sunspots. ] There was also a powerful volcanic eruption which might have contributed to whatbecame the \"Little Ice Age\" in the early 1700s. Some solar physicists wonder if a lowsunspot number and low number of solar flares by themselves could cause temperatures todecrease on the Earth."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The solar physics debate is growing about which way the sun will go in this next SolarMaximum supposed to reach the most number of sunspots between 2010 and 2012. Infact, according to Pravda:\"Russian scientists Vladimir Bashkirtsev and Galina Mashnich, senior researchers at theInstitute of Solar-Terrestrial Physics of the RAS laid a $10,000 bet with British governmentclimate expert, James Annan. The Russians claim that in the next ten years the Earth willface global cooling. The Englishman says that the climate will become warmer andwarmer. \"Russian scientists think that the present warming on the planet is connected with Earth'sreaction to the outbursts and spots that have been lately appearing on the sun morefrequently than before. At the moment, the sun is entering a less active phase. That is whythere will be a reverse temperature rise: it will become colder. \"It is hard to predict who will win. It would be great if both sides lost. And the Earthstayed the same. However, at the moment, scientists cannot understand what is happeningwith the sun.\" For previous Earthfiles reports about solar flares, see Archives: · 03/20/2005 -- Astronaut John Young: \"The Moon Can Save Earth'sCivilization.\"· 02/11/2005 -- Sunspot Region 720 Emitted Strongest Solar Radiation SinceOctober 1989.· 10/29/2003 -- Fifth Intense Solar X-Flare - What's Happening On the Sun?· 03/07/2003 -- Scientist's Record Sun's Plasma Interaction with Comet NEAT· 10/25/1999 -- A Blast of Solar Wind Provokes Aurora Over Northern U.
