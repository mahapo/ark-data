Andrew Kissner Return to Part 1Trouble in the Desert (cont.)The Deputy Commanding General of the Army Air Forces and Air Chief of Staff, Lt.General Ira C. Eaker, had been on hand to observe the launch. General Eaker's Vice Chiefof Staff was General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, identified in the MJ-12 document as MJ-6, whoin 1946 was U. S. Director of the Central Intelligence Group (CIG), immediate forerunnerof the CIA established by the National Security of 1947. General Vandenberg (MJ-6) wasreturned by the CIG to the Army Air Forces in January 1947 and given the assignment ofVice Chief of the Air Staff. He was subsequently promoted shortly after this test to Chiefof the Air Staff, upon General Eaker retirement.USAF Lieutenant General Ira C. Eaker.Retired Aug. 31, 1947; died Aug. 6, 1987.Photograph courtesy U. S. Air Force. Those especially concerned about the peculiar object's appearance included the U. S.Army Ordnance and the Naval Research Laboratory who were based at WSPG; theNational Antiaircraft Artillery School at Ft. Bliss, Texas; and the Armed Forces SpecialWeapons Project (AFSWP) at Sandia Base, Albuquerque, established on January 1, 1947.AFSWP was responsible for nuclear weapons security at all U. S. nuclear weaponsrepositories. The AEC designed, fabricated, assembled and tested all of the U. S. nuclearweapons from its base at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL) 300 miles north ofWSPG launch row. No one knew what the peculiar phenomenon was, but its appearancealong side launched V-2 rockets was not good.[ Sources: El Paso Times, May 14, 1948; Who's Who in America, Vol. II,1951-1960; The Central Intelligence Agency: An Instrument of Governmentto 1950 © 1990 by Arthur B. Darling, Pennsylvania State University Press;Sandia National Laboratories © Furman, p. 216.]Speculation centered on the peculiar phenomenon being a long range Russianreconnaissance aircraft or drone, possibly launched from Mexico to observe and/orobstruct United States V-2 tests. If that were true, then the U. S. was in trouble because the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"phenomenon had not been detected prior to V-2 launches on America's heavily monitoredmissile test range. Recorders attached to an array of tracking radar assessing the rocket'sperformance and film from a battery of high speed ground cameras was reviewed. Germanscientists included Werner Von Braun who was brought to Ft. Bliss to support the V-2program at White Sands, with the encouragement and support of Dr. Vannevar Bush(MJ-2). Dr. Von Braun witnessed the troubled launch along with other scientists whoworked with the Naval Research Laboratory, including Dr. James Van Allen from JohnsHopkins APL. The German scientists were asked if they had developed such technologyduring WWII. But none could explain the peculiar phenomenon.The object that had appeared next to the launched V-2 was defined as \"hostile\" since itappeared to have caused the rocket to veer off course. Therefore, that unidentified discwas considered to be an advanced foreign weapon system. Effort would be expended toguard against further over-flights and high priority would be assigned to collect a sample ofthe technology for further analysis, covertly if possible.[ Sources: The New York Times, June 7, 1947; confidential source at WSMRIwho told this author that launch rules preclude missile tests after anunauthorized aircraft has been detected in WSPG air space; Las CrucesCitizen, May 18, 1947; Devorkin, Science With A Vengeance, p. 47; LasCruces Sun-News, May 16 and May 20, 1947.]El Paso Times, May 15, 1947.Believing that the peculiar technology was probably Russian, the Army would attempt towithhold the information so that the Soviet Union would be unaware of the Americanaccomplishment - capturing a high technology, long-range reconnaissance aircraft. The U.S. Army Ordnance and National Antiaircraft Artillery School at Ft. Bliss, Texas, hadprimary responsibility for collecting a specimen. The Army Air Forces Material Commandat Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, supported the Army's effort by providing a moresophisticated antiaircraft weapons system from site \"KINGMAN\" at Wendover, Utah.The implications of the object's appearance were both strategic and tactical. An airplatform that could instantaneously appear, bring a weapon to bear, and then disappearover the southern continental U. S. without warning could, in theory, appear anywhere(e.g., nuclear weapons laboratory, uranium processing plant, a nuclear weapons storagesite, a battlefield) at any time. It could observe and attack its targets at will. Its intrusionmight be momentarily detected, assuming that the military or industrial target hadantiaircraft surveillance and tracking technology like the Proving Ground, but none did.Considering the state of the art in antiaircraft weapons, it would be difficult to defendagainst. The peculiar phenomenon apparently enjoyed complete freedom of movement andcould select from a wide variety of military or industrial targets a number more criticalthan even the SECRET V-2s.Brig. General Robert M. Montague (MJ-11) was the Army's foremost expert in antiaircraftweapons and tactics and was Director of the Antiaircraft and Guided Missile Branch of theNational Antiaircraft Artillery School at Ft. Bliss in northern El Paso, Texas, 35 milessouth of WSPG. General Montague, identified as MJ-11 in the Majestic 12 leakeddocument, was promoted to command the AFSWP at Sandia Base on July 11, 1947, fourdays after the covert military operation began to recover the Corona \"flying disc.\" The"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"AFSWP at Sandia Base was established at Kirtland Field in Albuquerque, for the purposeof maintaining, transporting, storing and securing all U. S. nuclear weapons. It is believedthat Sandia Base, following successful recovery of the first flying disc, would act as aflying disc custodian. That custody might possibly be at a repository in the ManzanoMountains in central New Mexico. The repositories would be protected from air attack byGen. Montague (MJ-11). Operating under the proword WATERSUPPLY, the U. S.'s firsttwo underground nuclear weapons repositories were completed by March 1948. The thirdunderground complex was completed by the fall of 1948. It is believed that one of the firsttwo completed sites was within 100 miles of the \"Roswell\" (Corona) flying disc crash site.It was under construction in the summer of 1947.After the May 15, 1947, V-2 rocket crash, Gen. Montague was brought to the ProvingGround with Major General John J. Homer, Commander of Ft. Bliss, to review theevidence of the peculiar phenomenon.[ Sources: Las Cruces Sun-News, May 20, 1947; confidential interview withSource 1 from the Boston scientific community in 1976.]General Montague's (MJ-11) assignment not only included training antiaircraft artilleryofficers and crews, but also a secondary mission providing antiaircraft security for WSPG.It is believed that General Montague deployed Ft. Bliss antiaircraft artillery around theProving Ground. General Montague's troops would have primary responsibility to guardfuture tests and collect a sample of the technology for further analysis. The Army AirForces at Alamogordo Air Field were placed on heightened alert and directed to watch forunknown airborne intruders. In cooperation with Lt. Col. Turner, General Montaguerequested a more rapid deployment of a new surface to air missile reportedlymanufactured by Boeing Aircraft Co. The \"GAPA\" surface-to-air missile system waspublicly reported to be two years old and operated under the auspices of the TechnicalBranch of the Air Material Command at Wright Field, Ohio (that became Wright-PattersonAFB), commanded by General Nathan Twining (MJ-4), with a program site at Wendover,Utah.[ Source: Las Cruces Sun-News, July 24, 1947.]The El Paso Times, July 25, 1947."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Las Cruces Sun-News, July 24, 1947, Front Page.Continued in Part 7 - Project Y's TOP SECRET \"KINGMAN\" Nuclear Test StagingAreaCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
