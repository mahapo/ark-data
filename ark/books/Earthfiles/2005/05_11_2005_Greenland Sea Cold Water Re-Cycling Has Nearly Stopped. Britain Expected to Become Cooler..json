Thatwill cool down Europe or at least parts of Europe that are accessible to the ocean.... (England and coastal parts of Europe) will be getting more violent types ofweather that are due to the higher temperature differences that are happeningeverywhere.\"Ocean Physicist Peter Wadhams, Cambridge University, U. K. Labrador and the British Isles are on the same latitude. But Britain has enjoyed a mild climate comparedto cold Labrador because of the North Atlantic Drift, also known as the Atlantic Thermohaline Circulation,which conveys warm equatorial water to the U. K. and Faeroe Islands. May 11, 2005 Cambridge, England - Normally in the Atlantic Ocean, warm watermoves from the Equator up to the British Isles, keeping England and parts of Europewarmer than Labrador which is at the same northern latitude. The warming is caused by ahuge convection process called the Atlantic Thermohaline Circulation, or North AtlanticDrift. Equatorial warm water is circulated to the Labrador Sea and Greenland Sea, coolsoff, and then sea ice forms. The ice does not take up the sea salt which is left behind in theocean and makes the water denser and it sinks. For more than a century, at least a dozencylinder-shaped columns of cold water have been sinking into the deep ocean and headingback south toward the Equator which has kept the big conveyor belt of warm-to-cold-to-warm water going in the Atlantic Ocean.But now for the first time, Cambridge University Physicist, Peter Wadhams, hasdiscovered that those dozen cold water columns in the Greenland Sea have nearlydisappeared. Prof. Wadhams is also head of the Cambridge Polar Ocean Physics Group.He reported last week in Vienna at the European Geosciences Union meeting about hisfield research in the Greenland Sea. With a changing, slowing thermohaline circulation,Great Britain and parts of Europe will become colder over this century as the rest of theplanet gets warmer."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Atlantic Thermohaline Circulation map © Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.Interview:Peter Wadhams, Ph.D., Prof. of Ocean Physics and Head of Polar Ocean PhysicsGroup (POPG), University of Cambridge, England has studied the GreenlandSea cold water circulation since 2001.

Part of the reason isglobal warming and partly because the wind system has changed. So, that part of theGreenland Sea remains ice free and there is not the driving force for the sinking of the coldwater.This means that the volume and depth of this sinking process, or convection, has beenreduced. That's weakening the circulation of water in the Atlantic and there is a reductionin the amount of warm water that once headed north and bathed the shores of Europe,keeping it warmer than it would otherwise be. That's the main thing that we are finding.This has been found by a number of different research groups looking at ocean properties,but we found it in relation to studying the Greenland Sea sinking site itself. We've gonethere every winter and summer for the past four years. We found that the sinking happensin the form of current 'chimneys' that's a kind of narrow 10-kilometer-wide (6.2 miles)rotating column of water where the surface water is sinking through that column down intothe deep ocean. This seems to be the mechanism by which the circulation happens. Water-Circulating \"Chimneys\" Are Nearly GoneWe found that these 'chimneys' are very long-lived. But there are only two of them inexistence at the moment, while seven to eight years ago when they were first studied, therewere at least a dozen. I think what's happening is because the ice is not forming in thecentral Greenland Sea anymore, chimneys are not forming either. We've just seen the lastcouple of chimneys fading away now.We do expect that this reduction in the volume of sinking water will lead to a reduction inthe volume of warm water reaching Europe. That will cool down Europe or at least partsof Europe that are accessible to the ocean. This is something that will take over fromglobal warming for Europe, not for America or Asia. They will continue to warm at therate of global warming, but the prediction of computer models are that Europe will warmmore slowly because of this effect. By the end of this century, Europe will be back roughly"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"at the same temperature that it is today while everywhere else in the world will be warmer.We're getting the cooling effect in Europe which will be offsetting global warming for us. More Violent WeatherWHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO BE THE WORST CASE?The worst case might be what would happen is if this local effect kept Europe much coolerthan it would otherwise be, it would have quite a lot of other effects as well. It's like anisolated island of cooling in a big hemisphere of extreme warming. So, there will probablybe much more violent weather. There would be changes in the ocean conditions as far asfish and plankton are concerned. We would be seeing quite a lot of changes that wouldlikely make Europe a more climatically violent place than it is now.THEN IF EUROPE COOLS DOWN WHILE THE NORTH AMERICA CONTINENTAND OTHER PARTS OF THE GLOBE ARE HEATING UP, WOULD THAT MEANVIOLENT WINDS AND INCREASED RAINS AND DEEP SNOWS WOULD BECOMEPERSISTENT IN BRITISH AND EUROPEAN WEATHER PATTERNS?Yes. (England and coastal parts of Europe) will be getting more violent conditions and ingeneral, one of the aspects of global warming is increase in extremes of violent types ofweather that are due to the higher temperature differences that are happening everywhere.So, every part of the world can be expected to have more variable weather, more extremesof climate than we are getting at the moment.ISN'T THIS GOING TO TAKE A MAJOR FINANCIAL TOLL ON REALLY ALL THEGOVERNMENTS?Yes, it is. That's the really crazy thing about the idea that, for instance, the U. S. shouldn'tdo anything about global warming or reduce oil consumption or carbon emissions becauseto do so would cost too much for the economy. In the long and medium run, the cost ofclimate change is going to be infinitely greater than any cost of trying to mitigate it. What Happens If the Thermohaline Circulation Stops?I REMEMBER DOING MY FIRST REPORTS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL THAT THENORTH ATLANTIC DRIFT COULD STOP ALTOGETHER JUST A FEW YEARS AGOWITH THE COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICISTS. I REMEMBERTHEY WERE SAYING THAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF IT SLOWING DOWNCONSIDERABLY OR STOPPING COULD PLUNGE EUROPE INTO A DEEPFREEZE.That was the theme of the film The Day After Tomorrow, but I wouldn't be that pessimisticabout it. There is certainly going to be a noticeable effect and it's going to stop Europefrom warming, but I don't think it would actually go to the length of plunging Europe into adeep freeze. It would if the North Atlantic Drift or Gulf Steam actually stopped. If we lookacross the Atlantic to the same latitude as say Britain, we have Labrador which is a prettymuch Arctic region. It's the same latitude as Britain which is pretty temperate. That is thedifference between sitting in the warm current or sitting in a cold current.You can point to Labrador and say if the Gulf Stream stopped, Europe would look likeLabrador. But I don't think the Gulf Stream is actually going to stop. It's simply a matter ofslowing because that component of it (Greenland Sea) is not being driven anymore. Butthe wind-driven part of it is still going strong.BUT WOULD YOU HAVE THOUGHT THAT BY AS SOON AS 2005 THAT THEGREENLAND SEA DOWN CURRENTS WOULD BE ALMOST GONE?No, that was a big surprise because this region of ice formation in the Greenland Sea whichis called the 'Odden' a Norwegian word that means 'tongue.' It's always been there everywinter since it was first discovered, which was in the early 19th Century when seal-huntersused to go there because that's where the seals would hold up to have their pups. So it wasrecognized very early on as an annual feature. That's where the seal hunting ships went.Then suddenly in 1997, it stopped forming and hasn't been seen since. So that's a prettysudden change that nobody expected.DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOUR OWN INTERNAL THOUGHTS WERE WHENYOU DID THE LAST SERIES OF MEASUREMENTS THAT INDICATED THECURRENT 'CHIMNEYS' OF COLD WATER AROUND GREENLAND WERE DOWN"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"TO ONLY TWO VERY WEAK ONES?Yes, I was thinking that the ocean is changing much faster than anybody had thought!When I first went into oceanography over 30 years ago, as a science it had just reached thepoint where oceanographers thought if they just sent out ships all over the world,eventually you would build up a picture of the state of the ocean: the currents andtemperatures and salinity and plankton. You could gradually build up that and put it all inan Atlas and improve the Atlas every year by exploring the world and gradually improvingthe map of Africa. Oceanographers did not think that the ocean could change very much.They thought you just had to map it once and there you were.But now we are finding it's just changing very rapidly and everywhere we look. It's not aconstant part of our planet. We used to think that whatever happens, there is the oceanalways the same. But it's not. It's changing very fast. That makes one feel a lot less safe, Isuppose, on this planet.GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE LESS THAN TEN YEARS EXPERIENCE WITHTHE GREENLAND SEA'S CURRENT CHIMMNEYS APPARENTLY STOPPING, IS ITFAIR TO SAY THAT THE NORTH ATLANTIC DRIFT MIGHT STOP ALTOGETHER IFTHE MELT OF GLACIERS AND OTHER NEUTRALIZING IMPACTS ON SALTWATER CONTINUE?Yes, but (stopping) is a different thing. It would take a very long time. There is thepossibility in the very long term that the Greenland ice cap will start to melt, or perhapsalready is starting to melt. Then that would release a very large amount of fresh water intothe ocean at high latitudes that would spread a kind of 'cap' over the ocean that wouldcompletely prevent any sinking or convection going on because the surface water wouldhave such low density. It would be almost fresh. That would be a very important event.Something like that seems to have happened at the end of the last Ice Age when the big icesheets in the northern hemisphere were melting.But even with global warming going sort of roaring mad, which it might well do if we don'tstop burning carbon, then the Greenland ice sheet will still take a long time to melt at theorders of hundreds of years. So, I don't think that effect will come in for a long time.IF IT DID THOUGH, WHAT WOULD BE THE WORST CASE FROM THECOMPUTER MODELING?I think you would have to look at the people who do computer modeling of past climate.People have tried to model how the last Ice Age ended - what's happened when lots offresh water suddenly appeared in high latitudes. It seemed to have been that a strangeeffect occurred. A lot of fresh water was released in one go and this capped off the NorthAtlantic from the convection process and that then had this cooling effect on Europe andNorth America as well. The world went back a little way into the Ice Ages conditionsagain. Then it took another warming impact to get us out of it. That sort of thing mighthappen. There would be the possibility of cutting off the circulation could push areas likeEurope into very cold conditions.SINCE THIS IS SORT OF LIKE DOMINOES FALLING, WE DON'T REALLY KNOWFROM EXPERIENCE EXACTLY WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE APARTFROM THE COMPUTER MODELING?Yes, that's true. I don't think it (Atlantic Drift) would stop altogether because part of it iswind-driven, so it's driven by patterns of wind over the ocean. That will continue. It's morea matter of it slowing down because the part that is driven by this vertical circulationwould stop happening. But it's true, computer models are not the be all and end all. Thecomputer models that have predicted the global warming seem to be very good when youhind cast them for the last 50 years, that is, go back and see what they predicted for whathas happened. They agree pretty well. So, I think the model predictions are pretty good forglobal warming as a whole.But this effect of the slow down of the Thermohaline Circulation was something that didn'teven enter into computer models until very recently. The effects had not even beendiscovered or thought of. So, it was only when the people who write the models put thiseffect specifically into the model, that they got the predictions about the cooling. So, theywould not have gotten the predictions unless they actually knew the effect was happening.Then they could put it in the model.So, therefore, you expect or fear or suspect that computer models are not that goodbecause there will be other phenomena occurring that we don't understand and therefore,we haven't put in the model and therefore, the model does not predict it. It's a circularargument, but it does mean that the unexpected is very likely to occur.IN THAT UNEXPECTEDNESS, ISN'T PART OF IT THAT SCIENTISTS ARE"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"SURPRISED THAT THE DOWN-WELLING IN GREENLAND HAS ALREADYNEARLY DISAPPEARED?Yes, it has been a very big effect in relation to sorts of changes that normally go on in theocean. This is a shut down of a major oceanic global phenomenon. It's certainly that themore people discover about the ocean, the more they are finding that very large changesare going on which were not suspected which affect large volumes of water, involve largetemperature changes. In terms of the scale of the planet, they are major changes going onwhich often are not suspected for a long time simply because it is so much more difficult tostudy the ocean than to study the land. There are not enough ships to do it and not enoughpeople doing it. So, you can't survey the ocean as easily as you can the land. These thingscan be happening without anybody knowing what's going on. Oceans Changing More Rapidly Than Scientists ExpectedYES, AND THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AS AREPORTER: WITH THE RAPIDITY WITH WHICH GLACIERS ARE MELTING,WITH WHAT YOU HAVE JUST FOUND AS A MAJOR CHANGE IN THE COLDWELLING DOWN CURRENTS AROUND GREENLAND THAT NO MATTER WHATOUR COMPUTER MODELS HAVE SAID, OR SAY, THE OCEANS ARE CHANGINGSO RAPIDLY THAT THE CONSEQUENCES COULD BE DISASTROUS CLIMATECHANGE?Oh, yes, because so much of the Earth's climate as weather is dependent on the ocean. It'sthree-quarters of the Earth's surface and if the ocean is changing, it will have quite anunpredictable consequences for different parts of the Earth. More Violent Hurricanes ExpectedEVERYBODY WANTS TO KNOW: ARE WE GOING TO BE SEEING WEATHERTHAT IS OVERWHELMING SUCH AS THE FOUR MAJOR HURRICANES THAT HITFLORIDA WITHIN A MONTH'S PERIOD IN 2004?Yes. Hurricanes, for instance, are more vicious and there are more of them now becausethe ocean is warming up and the temperature differences that are involved in theevaporation of water from the oceans and the winds in the tropical Atlantic are morevigorous than they were because the tropical Atlantic is warmer. As it gets warmer, we canexpect more hurricanes and worse ones.WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF IT BECAME A REGULAR YEARLY CYCLE OF FOUROR FIVE HEAVY DUTY HURRICANES HITTING THE EAST COAST OF THEUNITED STATES, FOR EXAMPLE, IN A FOUR OR FIVE WEEK PERIOD? HOWWOULD ANY GOVERNMENT OR NATION RECOVER FROM SOMETHING LIKETHAT?Probably the U. S. can take precautions as far as building codes are concerned, but it willbe much worse for the poor countries in Central America where regularly when ahurricane hits, you have thousands of deaths because they can't afford to build theirbuildings more strongly. It will be very bad for them and bad for the U. S., but mainly interms of property damage and not so much in loss of life.BUT IF IT KEEPS INCREASING AND NO ONE CAN GET INSURANCE, THEN ITMEANS EVENTUALLY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE FORCED BY CONDITIONS TONOT EVEN LIVE ON THE COASTS WHICH ARE THE MOST POPULATED AREAS.Oh, yes, in the end, people will need to move inland also because of sea level rise as well. Faeroe Islands Also Show Reductionin Warm Water Current"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"IS THERE ANY SCIENCE GROUP RIGHT NOW THAT IS LOOKING AT YOURWORK AND NOW LOOKING AT ENGLAND AND EUROPE AND SAYING ORTRYING TO SEE IF THERE IS A TREND IN WEATHER PATTERNS THAT HASCHANGED BECAUSE OF THE STOPPING OF THE DOWN WATERS INGREENLAND?There was a discovery in the groups that have been monitoring the northward flow ofwarm water past the Faeroes those are the islands north of Britain on the way towardsNorway. They found that has slowed down and have published some results that show afairly substantial reduction in the volume of water flow past the Faeroes. That's a recentresult that looks pretty interesting. So, it will become gradually clear that Europe is notexperiencing the same warming as the rest of the hemisphere is. Earth Could Warm Up Much MoreThan Early Computer ModelsWHAT DO YOU WORRY ABOUT THE MOST HAPPENING IN THE NEXT 20YEARS?Apart from war, I suppose it is the possibility that global warming will go faster thanpredicted. Already there has been an upgrading in the predictions of the rate of warming.In fact, the last report of the Inter-governmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC) foundthe observed rate of warming and computer model rate were faster because there werevarious processes that had not been included in the models related to the carbon cycle. So,when they reran the models, the rate of warming was something like a third greater. Thatjust happened very recently.Given that computer models can be changed as quickly as that for such a big changesuggests there is some possibility that the global warming might start to go much fasterthan we think, or had expected at such a rate that even if we take fairly drastic actionabout our carbon emissions, we won't be in a position to slow it down rapidly enough. Thisis because of the fact that carbon does remain in the atmosphere for a long time. If wesuddenly stopped everything (all carbon emissions), we would still have global warminghappening for about another 100 years.THEN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO SURFACE LIFE?I suppose the worst possible case would be the planet Venus which seems at some stage afew billion years ago to have had a runaway greenhouse effect and now the surfacetemperature is several hundred degrees! (laughs) I don't think that will happen to Earth,but given what we're doing to the atmosphere, there is some possibility of an effectbecoming more rapid than what has been predicted because we don't understand thephysics completely. Then we might find ourselves the victims of some quite severe globalcatastrophe without having the means to do anything about it because we've already putthe carbon into the atmosphere and we can't really take it out again even if we stoppedputting it in.\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Prof. Wadhams and his colleagues next plan to study the rate of Arctic ice melting whichcould also slow down the Atlantic Thermohaline Circulation even more.More Information:See Other Earthfiles Reports About Atlantic Thermohaline Circulation:· 02/27/2004 -- Abrupt Climate Change: Scenario from A Pentagon-CommissionedReport· 10/15/2004 -- Ever-Increasing Carbon Dioxide Build-Up in Atmosphere Since 1958· 08/14/2004 -- Oceans Absorbing Greenhouse CO2.
