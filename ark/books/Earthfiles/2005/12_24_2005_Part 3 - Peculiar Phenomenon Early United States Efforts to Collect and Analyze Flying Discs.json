Seidel, 1999 Return to Part 1In order to better understand Peculiar Phenomenon, I am beginning with the followingglossary of American government abbreviations, acronyms and nomenclature.AAF Army Air Forces, predecessor to the U. S. Air Force. USAF was created by theNational Security Act and organized on August 1, 1947, only three weeks after one ormore flying discs were allegedly recovered in the Roswell, Corona and White SandsMissile Range region of New Mexico.AEC Atomic Energy Commission, established by the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. AECwas a \"civilian\" organization given custody of all U. S. nuclear weapons and materials bythe Act. A further nuclear weapons custody determination was made by President Trumanin June 1948, in favor of the AEC.Aerospace Corporation A private, non-profit, \"civilian\" research anddevelopment corporation wholly owned by the U. S. Air Force Systems Command based inEl Segundo, California. However, it appears to operate as an integrated military commandof the Joint Chiefs of Staff.AFCRC Armed Forces Cambridge Research Center, a division of the Air MaterialCommand based at Wright (Patterson) Field (AFB), Dayton, Ohio. AFCRC is based inMassachusetts.AFGL Armed Forces Geophysical Laboratory.Now renamed: AFRL Air Force Research Laboratory - Space Vehicles Directorate.The Space Vehicles Directorate Headquarters is located at Kirtland Air Force Base inAlbuquerque, New Mexico, at the site of the former Phillips Laboratory (see: AFWL). Thesecond Space Vehicles Directorate site is located at Hanscom Air Force Base inMassachusetts, formerly the Geophysics Directorate.AFMC Air Force Materiel Command, located at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.AFOSI Air Force Office of Special Investigations. AFOSI is a field operating agencywith headquarters at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. It has been the Air Force'sfelony-level investigative service since August 1, 1948. The agency reports to theInspector General, Office of the Secretary of the Air Force. There is also a districtheadquarters at Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque. AFOSI's mission focuses on counter-intelligence operations, specifically to target and investigate attempts to steal or discloseclassified information related to U. S. special weapons.AFSA Armed Forces Security Agency. Precursor to the National Security Agency"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"(NSA), created on May 20, 1949, in the Department of Defense under the command of theJoint Chiefs of Staff. AFSA was to be responsible for directing the communications andelectronic intelligence activities of military intelligence units such as the Army SecurityAgency, Naval Security Group and the Air Force Security Service. But AFSA wasineffective and was replaced in 1952 in a classified Executive Order of President HarryTruman by the creation of the National Security Agency.AFSC U. S. Air Force Systems Command was a former United States Air Forcecommand. Its headquarters was located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. On July1, 1992, AFSC and Air Force Logistics Command were merged to form the Air ForceMateriel Command, also located at Wright-Patterson AFB.AFSTC U. S. Air Force Space Technology Center, Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, NewMexico.AFWL U. S. Air Force Weapons Laboratory, at Kirtland AFB's Sandia Base,Albuquerque, New Mexico. AFWL was formed in 1947 as the Armed Forces SpecialWeapons Project (AFSWP) and renamed Phillips Laboratory in 1991. A division of theResearch and Technology Division, Air Force Systems Command in 1963, and the Directorof Science and Technology, AFSC, after 1967.AFSWC U. S. Air Force Special Weapons Command, activated on December 1, 1949,at Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, New Mexico. It was responsible for operating all AirMaterial Command (Wright Field, Ohio) activities at the base and provided personnel andequipment for developing and testing aircraft and other special weapons as well asproviding additional personnel and equipment to the AEC. AFSWC's mission was \"... toestablish and maintain technical supervision over a test facility and group of qualifiedpersonnel, aircraft, equipment and instrumentation that will provide the Air Force, theAtomic Energy Commission, their contractors and other agencies of the Department ofDefense an organization for the development and testing of atomic weapons or otherspecial weapons with their associated equipment for determining the adequacy of airbornevehicles and special weapons. It is the primary source of scientific and technicalinformation pertaining to special weapons development and associated special techniqueswithin the Air Force.\" [ \"From Sundaggers to Space Exploration\" © 1986 by Hsi andPanitz, New Mexico Journal of Science, Vol. 26, No. 1, p. 294.] AFSWC became the AirForce Special Weapons Center in 1952.AFSWP Armed Forces Special Weapons Project at Sandia Base, Albuquerque, NewMexico, established in 1947 with the transfer of some Los Alamos Scientific Laboratoryproduction and research functions to the Z Division at Sandia Base in Albuquerque.AFSWP also involved the assignment of special U. S. military units to protect the U. S.special weapons stockpile. Brig. General Robert M. Montague (MJ-11) became the firstmilitary commander of AFSWP only four days after a flying disc allegedly was discoverednear Corona, New Mexico, on July 4, 1947.AMC Air Material Command based after June 1947 at Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio;Kirtland Army Air Field, Albuquerque, NM; and Alamogordo Army Air Field,Alamogordo, NM.

In 1948, BNL had a $40 million budget duringits first year of operation. The RAND Corporation referred to BNL as an AEC laboratory.BNL's own literature refers to its mission as an \"independent, academic researchlaboratory\" operated by a consortium of U. S. colleges in the Associated Universities, Inc.\"BOWMAN\" Proword purportedly associated with a compartmentalizedintelligence classification for \"flying discs.\" A source says the proword was used becausegoing after discs, from a military point of view, was \"like trying to hit a jet fighter with anarrow.\"BRL Ballistic Research Laboratory, U. S. Army Ordnance, that operated for the JointChiefs of Staff at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland.CAB Civil Aeronautics Board. President Franklin Roosevelt split the authority into twoagencies in 1940, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) and the Civil AeronauticsBoard (CAB). CAA was responsible for ATC, airman and aircraft certification, safetyenforcement, and airway development. CAB was entrusted with safety rule-making,accident investigation, and economic regulation of the airlines. Both organizations werepart of the Department of Commerce. Unlike CAA, however, CAB functionedindependently of the Secretary. The approaching introduction of jet airliners and a seriesof midair collisions spurred passage of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. This legislationtransferred CAA's functions to a new independent body, the Federal Aviation Agency,which had broader authority to combat aviation hazards. The Act took safety rule-makingfrom CAB and entrusted it to the new FAA. In 1966, Congress authorized the creation of acabinet department that would combine major federal transportation responsibilities. Thisnew Department of Transportation (DOT) began full operations on April l, 1967. On thatday, the FAA became one of several organizations within DOT and received a new name,the Federal Aviation Administration. At the same time, CAB's accident investigationfunction was transferred to the new National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).CIA Central Intelligence Agency, formed on September 26, 1947, from threeorganizations: the Central Intelligence Group (CIG), the Office of Strategic Services (OSS)and the Strategic Services Unit (SSU) of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Its first Director wasAdmiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter (MJ-1). President Harry S. Truman signed the legislation tocreate the CIA only two weeks after one or more flying discs were allegedly recovered inthe region of Carrizozo, Corona and Roswell, New Mexico.CIG Central Intelligence Group of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was formed to replace theOffice of Strategic Services (OSS) in May 1946. General Hoyt Vandenberg (MJ-5) was adirector of CIG. Other CIG directors were Admiral Sydney Souers (MJ-8) and AdmiralRoscoe Hillenkoetter (MJ-1).CIOS Combined Intelligence Objectives Subcommittee of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,established by the Joint Research and Development Board (JRDB). CIOS panels used themost expert scientific talent available from military, civilian and academic organizations tostudy specific technical subjects. CIOS panels held specific names such as V-2 RocketPanel; Upper Atmosphere Rocket Research Panel; Subsurface Warfare Research Panel;Uranium Research Panel.CIW Carnegie Institution of Washington, D. C. During 1947, the President of CIW wasDr. Vannevar Bush (MJ-2), who also served as Director of OSRD (Office of ScientificResearch and Development), JRDB (Joint Research and Development Board) and RDB(Research and Development Board).COMINT Communications Intelligence.CRPL Central Radio (Wave) Propagation Laboratory, National Bureau of Standards.In the late 1940s at the beginning of the Cold War, President Truman had declared thatnew government facilities not be built within the Washington, D.C. metro area so as not toconcentrate so many federal facilities within range of one atomic bomb.

Over the years, the name of the organizationevolved from the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP) in 1947, to theDefense Atomic Support Agency (DASA) in 1959, to DNA in 1971.In 1996, the name was changed to: Defense Special Weapons Agency (DSWA). TheAgency's responsibilities were increased as a result of two congressionally mandatedstudies of its roles and functions. Missions include: maintaining a center for nucleartechnical expertise within the Defense Department (DoD); conducting nuclear weaponsstockpile support and serving as the lead DoD agency for national nuclear stockpilestewardship programs; performing nuclear and advanced weapons effects research andoperational support; carrying out research and development to support U.S. governmentimplementation, compliance and verification of arms control treaties and agreements;researching and developing capabilities for military responses to the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction; supporting military war fighters in analyzing plans andresponse options for both nuclear and advanced conventional weapons; carrying out DoD'sCooperative Threat Reduction (CRT) program projects.\"DREAMLAND\" Alleged joint U.S. government and alien base/s in Nevada,New Mexico, Utah, Colorado and Arizona.DSWA Defense Special Weapons Agency.
