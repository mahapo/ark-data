Here begins Part 3of Status Report IV, written for the June 28-30, 1985, MUFON 1985 UFO SymposiumProceedings in conjunction with the national MUFON conference held in Saint Louis,Missouri. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H.Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report V begins at Earthfiles 012805.Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994.Leonard H. Stringfield: \"The document is avowedly not proof. For it to be established asbona fide would, in turn, require additional irretrievable reports, memoranda, tapes, adinfinitum. In this regard, however, Morse said on several occasions that he had attemptedto obtain a later Form 1569 Report mentioned by the desk sergeant, but was unsuccessful.Nevertheless, the Incident/Complaint Report, as it stands, is a strong link of evidence noteasily dismissed, even if denied officially or by any of its named personnel who might becoerced to do so. (Note 4: See Incident Complaint Report, Item 11, where the box for'Unfounded' is checked. Inasmuch as 'Unfounded' suggests that the incident was baseless, Iasked Morse to explain this classification. He said that it referred only to the limitedinformation available to his security police squadron, which was not in a position toevaluate the incident. Also note that the check in Item 13 indicates that the case wasreferred to 'Other agency' (AFOSI - Air Force Office of Special Investigations) for finaldisposition, including 'One body of unknown origin ...' released to other authorities. Thesecurity police squadron had no basis for any other 'Evaluation.'"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Front page, January 18, 1978 Incident/Complaint Report Form 1569,prepared by Desk Sgt. WC and signed by 1st Lt. WS, it was channeled to Col. Landon,Commanding Officer of McGuire AFB; Brig. Gen. Brown, Hdq., 21st Air Force (at MAFB);and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI).The Genesis for Case A-3, as it is designated in Status Report III, [to be reprinted in futureEarthfiles] is a taped rebroadcast over the Armed Forces Far Eastern Radio Network of aninterview conducted by Charlie Tuna of KATZ, Los Angeles, July 28, 1980. I rememberthe interview well which concerned my UFO crash/retrieval probes at which time I waspromoting Status Report II, [to be reprinted in future Earthfiles] published by MUFON. Atthe close of the interview, I gave my home address for listeners who might contributeinformation. By chance, Morse (with his new Security Police Squadron in Okinawa) heardit as did others in the U. S. Armed Forces in the Far east. As confirmation of this, I have aletter of inquiry from a serviceman, D. N. Cook, stationed in Korea who mentioned thebroadcast. (Letter on file.)To establish how it all began is important, I believe, for it diminishes the chance that Morsemight have acted in collusion with a Stateside hoaxer. Also, to verify that he was stationedin Okinawa, I asked questions about the island's terrain and its little-known offshore island,Ie Shima. His answers were right on target as I knew these islands well, having been theremyself with the 5th Air Force in World War II. For the incident itself at McGuire AFB, we have only Morse's word and his word only thatit happened the way he described it, based on his recall of his own experience andobservations. Other than the Incident/Complaint Report which produced names, no otherperson has responded to Morse's request for back-up testimony. One letter he addressed toanother member of his unit on patrol went unanswered. Still another refused to surface tohis request fearing for his career in the services. 'No way,' was the response. Additional details about the affair came bit by bit based on specific questions by phoneand letter during 1984, which are broken down for simplicity into categories as follows:1. The Humanoid Factor. At varying times during his patrol duty, Morse waswithin 40 to 70 feet from the prostrate body on the abandoned runway #5.Never close enough to observe details such as facial features or its hands andfeet, Morse did recall that under the glare of truck headlights the skin of theunclad, hairless body was wet, shiny and snake-like. As reported in his initialletter, the entity was about 4 feet in height with large head, slender torso, thinarms and legs, and overall was of grayish-brown coloration. Unquestionably itwas not human and was however of humanoid stature, fitting the anatomicaldescription so often heard from military sources who have made claim to"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"having seen entities at crash sites and by a medical source who allegedlyperformed an autopsy on a specimen in the early 1950s. (Note 5: See Case A7in Status Report II, 1980, which includes letter from medical sourcedescribing in layman's terms his observation of alien specimen. See alsoanalogous description by a former CIA person in Case A6, same report.Always pressing for more detail, I once proffered the notion that the McGuirecorpse could have been that of a wild animal, a deer perhaps, or an escapedape from a military experimentation lab, or a zoo. To this Morse replied, 'Nozoo nearby. We did have a problem with deer on the runway, but no one evermade such a big fuss over a deer.'The only other anomaly that Morse attributed to the presence of the body wasthe strong smell of ammonia in the cold night air. I note here that the sameodor also prevailed at the alleged crash site in Case A-2 of Status Report II.2. UFO Reports. Morse, who never sighted a UFO before or after the incident, wasamong many on duty who witnessed the bluish-green lights flying high and in tightformation over the adjoining Ft. Dix-McGuire bases. And in the Incident/ComplaintReport is the confirmation of their flight by the radar operator, A/1C R, on duty atthe airbase control tower. Also, he had learned from the state trooper and later fromhis desk sergeant, WC, that one of the UFOs had come in at low level over the Ft.Dix MP's patrol car, causing temporary failure of his radio transmission. See belowdrawings of UFO flight formation and map of Ft. Dix-McGuire showing sites ofshooting and location of body, based on sketches by Morse. December 14, 1983, Map of McGuire AFBand Ft. Dix Army Base, New Jersey, with Alien Body Sketch "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Although he never was able to see or talk with the Ft. Dix MP named JS, Morse did seekconfirmation after his military service from the New Jersey State Police for their part inthe incident. But he got nowhere and claimed the State Police would not cooperate. Also,attempts to locate the state trooper he met at Gate # 5 were futile. In this runaround, Irecall Case A-8 in Status Report III where the police personnel involved in the 1966Hillsdale-Dexter, Michigan, encounter were immediately transferred to new posts in thecounty and all records on their blotter regarding the incident were removed.My search for UFO reports coincidental to the January 18, 1978, event indicates thatmainly in the eastern part of the U.S.A. there was no national flap and no concentration ofsightings in the New Jersey area at that time. A check into the reports collected andevaluated in the International UFO Reporter (CUFOS) for that time period show that 82reports (according to editor Allan Hendry) were judged to be 'unidentifiable orinappropriate.' However, five were selected for review in the March 1978 issue ofInternational UFO Reporter. Those occurred in Toledo, Ohio on January 23, 1978;Williamston, North Carolina on January 27, 1978, Key West, Florida on January 27, 1978;Montvale, New Jersey on January 31, 1978; and Peoria, Illinois on February 5, 1978.The only case possibly akin to the Ft. Dix-McGuire encounter is the January 31 report inMontvale, New Jersey, which involved humanoids. This story was reported in theFebruary 1978 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal with drawings of the entities, bearinglittle resemblance to the biped described by Morse. It was also fully reported in the April1978 issue of the International UFO Reporter. Only because the encounter happened inNew Jersey and within a reasonable time frame is it of relative interest.Another case occurring January 15, 1978, three days before the incident, involved a pilot,Roger K, and passengers flying in a Sundowner from Evansville, Indiana to LunkenAirport in Cincinnati, Ohio. I received the pilot's call who got my telephone number fromthe Control Tower, explaining that he had a harrowing experience 20 miles north ofLouisville, Kentucky, at 5,500 feet when he observed two white lights. One was movingback and forth and the other was stationary. Watching the one object make a circle, hesaid that all of a sudden it headed for the Sundowner on a collision course. To escape itspath, he dove 1,000 feet and watched the lights pass overhead and out of sight. Calling theControl Tower at Stanford Airport in Louisville, he heard they had received calls frompeople in the area who saw a UFO.In early January 1985, my hopes to get a back-up UFO report were heightened when aletter from Morse stated that he had traveled to Baldwinsville, New York, to see a friendretired from the U.S. Air Force, a former M/Sgt. HPS who had served in the 21st Air ForceHeadquarters at McGuire in the late 1970s. Morse said that he briefly mentioned theincident to HPS and learned that he recalled a night in 1978 when he took an urgent callfrom a C-141 pilot reporting a UFO while flying near McGuire. Morse said that HPS wasvaguely aware of his incident and suggested I check further, giving me his address. I calledHPS the day I got Morse's letter. HPS confirmed that he got the call from the pilot in 1978,which he said was 'quickly squelched.' But he could not pinpoint the date. 'Too long agoand I kept no records,' he said. He added, 'I don't recall a base alert, but the call I got fromthe pilot could have happened the same night of the other incident.'While on the phone, I asked HPS about Jeff as a person. 'He was always friendly. I livedwith my family on the base and he would often stop by in his patrol car and play with thekids. We got to know him well.' HPS added that he had no reason to question his honestyor sincerity. In my opinion, had Morse been a shrewd hoaxer, he could have inveigledsomeone else into adding spicy details to the incident instead of HPS, who in all honesty,provided little of real substance to support his case. But my call was worth the cost. HPSvouched that Morse was at McGuire AFB in 1978 and that he was a likable person."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The most significant event of UFO activity, pinpointing the exact date of January 18, 1978,is a report I received from a police officer, Ron Jones, while on duty in Erlanger,Kentucky. His UFO was a large lime green, egg-shaped object that flew erratically acrossKentucky skies. Other reports of a green object were also reported that night in northernKentucky and into Cincinnati, including one coincidentally that flew low over the home ofthe Jones family. It caused a moment of terror. The story made big news on the local radiostations and in the headline of the Kentucky edition of the Cincinnati Post.Saturday, January 21, 1978, The Kentucky Post (regional edition of The Cincinnati Post.)[Editor's Note: Entire text of The Kentucky Post newspaper article by reporter,David W. Brown:\"The man in charge of reporting sightings of UFOs in northern Kentucky andCincinnati says he believes the stories told by Erlanger Pd. Ronnie Jones and hisniece.'These are credible people. I have no reason to doubt that they saw an object in thesky that can't be explained,' said Leonard Stringfield. Stringfield of Marlemont,Ohio, a DuBois Chemical Co. official, was especially excited by the account ofMelody Harris, 20, of 6960 Shenandoah, Florence.'I would classify her experience as a Close Encounter of the First Kind,' he said,adding data he is collecting from Melody and Jones will be sent to the nationalUnidentified Flying Objects Research Center in Evanston, Illinois. (UFORC) For atechnical reason, Jones's experience won't be classified as a Close Encounter. 'AClose Encounter of the First Kind must be within 500 feet and the object wasapparently further away from the patrolman than that,' Stringfield said.Up Close'But the girl is another story. She apparently saw it up close - it was justabove her.' Jones says the flight of the UFO was erratic. He said on theface of a clock, it plotted a course from 3 o'clock to 9, up to 12, downto 6 - roughly making the figure of a numeral '4.'James E. Brown, 26 Franklin, Ft. Thomas, is sure he saw the same UFO whilewatching TV. 'I saw a flash out my living room window right before 9:30 p.m.,' saidthe 58-year-old Brown. 'It looked something like a shooting star, but much largerand differently shaped. I told my wife (Ellen), but she just laughed.'Brown, a barber in Campbell County for 27 years, said he thought people wouldthink he was nuts if he reported the sighting. 'But after reading your story Friday, I'mconvinced now I saw the real thing,' he told reporter Tim Stein. 'It had to be thesame UFO because I saw it at the same time.'Jones's niece was playing in the snow outside her apartment with Jones's son, Ron II,4, at roughly the same time. She described the object as green and in the shape of alight bulb. She estimated it was about (number not clear in reprinted newspaperarticle) feet above her and was the size of a car.'Nothing to gain.'Melody said the object appeared to land somewhere in the vicinity of the FlorenceDrive-in, which is closed for the season.Stringfield said UFO landings are reported to him almost as often as sky sightings.'This may sound strange,' Stringfield said, 'but these things do come in for touchlandings quite often.'Story continued on Page 6:Stringfield believes in UFOs. He says he has seen one and has talked to many peoplewhom he thinks also have had Close Encounters. At the same time, he says manyreports aren't believable. 'That's why it's extremely important,' he says, 'to determinethe credibility of the persons making the reports.'Stringfield says Pd. Jones is credible 'because he stands everything to lose, nothingto gain.' Jones has aid he has been ridiculed and laughed at since his sighting.He says he hopes to get more reports from persons who might have seen a greenobject in the sky Wednesday night. 'Sometimes it takes a few weeks for people toreport these things. Often, people don't report them for obvious reasons of beinglaughed at.'"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Stringfield agrees with Jones and Melody that the object probably was not a plane.'These people live near the airport. A plane would not frighten them. And don'tforget that little boy cried. He was really scared.'Stringfield planned to interview Melody at length about her encounter Friday. Healso was preparing for a tape session at his home for a program to be aired in thefuture by WLW-TV.Nine-year-old Lisa Purnell called The Kentucky Post late Friday night to report hersighting of the egg-like UFO. 'I was looking out the window around 10 p.m.,' said theOckerman Elementary fourth grader. 'It was green, with flashing lights, and anantenna on top.' Lisa is the daughter of Edward and Uvonna Purnell, 28 GrandAvenue, Florence. Edward is a self-employed contractor.\"]Leonard Stringfield: Of pertinence in this event is that the UFO was green as were thoseobserved by Morse. Despite a variance in shade perhaps, in my research green is amongthe least common of colors in the spectrum reported for UFOs. Most often reported iswhite, yellow, orange and red. Considering that Erlanger, south of Cincinnati, is as thecrow flies a short hop for a UFO to New Jersey, the two events might be plausibly linked.\"Continued in Part 4 - Alien Retrieval Operation at Ft.
