Here begins Part 8of Status Report III, written in June 1982. The series of status reports, I through VII, werewritten by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report IV begins atEarthfiles 021205. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. Leonard H. Stringfield: CASE B-4: 1962, Crashed Disk In Northern New Mexico [Editor's Note: Carswell AFB was one of the first Strategic Air Command bases,originally created on July 18, 1916.] Researcher Tommy Blann met Lt. Colonel X through a friend of another military officerstationed at Carswell AFB. 'There were many exchanges of communications betweenmyself, my friend and the other officer before the Colonel decided to meet me in person,'commented Blann in his personal summary of the discussion, recorded March 14, 1975,which Tommy obliged to send me in November 1981. Although sensitive portions of Blann's notes have been omitted here on his request, indeference to his informant, an excerpt that is pertinent to crash landed UFOs follows:March 14, 1975, Letter from UFO Researcher Tommy Blann: 'The Colonel stated that underground installations, as well as isolated areas ofmilitary reservations, have squadrons of unmarked helicopters which havesophisticated instrumentation on board. Squadrons are dispatched to areas of UFOactivity to monitor the craft or airlift them out of the area if one has malfunctioned. When I asked him about the crashed discs and humanoid bodies being taken toWright-Patterson, he told me that 'in the earlier years, they had taken some bodies tothat base, but later it depended on where the bodies were found. They had a hell of atime setting up procedures for this operation, as well as getting the craft out of thearea without it being observed. Usually this was done at nighttime.' He feels thebodies are now being flown outside the U. S. to a secret naval installation on anisland in the Pacific Ocean. I then asked him had he ever observed a crashed craft and any humanoid bodies? Hehesitated and said that he witnessed one crashed craft in Northern New Mexico inthe summer of 1962. It was dull aluminum-looking disc like two saucers invertedend-on-end, with a dark section running around the center of the craft. It appearedto be 30 feet in diameter and about 12 feet high. There was no noticeable landinggear and the craft had skidded, digging up a small trench. There was a team of eight men wearing jump suits and gas masks. Each man had aspecific job to do. The main testing is not done in the field. Only the preliminarydata are recovered. He said if you hear of a case where there are a large number ofmen crawling all over the craft without proper attire and doing all types of testing,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"you can bet it did not happen. There were two bodies recovered from the craft and they were put in a largeunmarked silver van and whisked off. I did not get a good look at the bodies.However, they looked small and were dressed in silver, skin-tight flight suits. Theywere taken to Holloman AFB as well as the craft and then sections of the craft weresent to various research labs, including Los Alamos Laboratories. I believe thebodies were also taken to Los Alamos and samples sent to other locations. Theywere not taken to Wright-Patterson. He would not give me any further details and stated he had said enough. I don'tknow if he is telling me the complete truth, but I do know that some things he saidcoincided with what I already knew from other sources.' Leonard Stringfield Comment: Above all else, the Colonel's alleged presence at a crashsite in New Mexico in 1962, ties in with the report described by researcher Robert Barryinvolving his C.I.A. source in same place, same year.See Case A-6 in Status Report II (reprinted in future Earthfiles). Also of note in bothreports was the recovery of two small occupants wearing tight-fitting suits. Unfortunately,there is one glaring discrepancy. Each report describes the size of the craft differently. Inthe case of Colonel X, it was 30 feet in diameter and 12 feet high. The C.I.A. investigator'swas 68 feet in diameter and 13 feet high. Both heights were close enough, but thediameters are off by 38 feet. Is one report, or both, miscalculations? Did two crashesoccur, accounting for the diameter differences? Is one or both reports fake? Also of note isthe variance in size of the craft seen in a hangar at Wright-Patterson, 1962, perhaps'freshly' retrieved, cited in Case A-6 in this paper. Significant is the Colonel's remark that retrieved craft and occupants have not all been sentto Wright-Patterson. Much ado has been made by some researchers unwilling to believethat during the 1950s most captured craft - because of size - could have been shipped byrail or over inadequate highways from far away places to Wright-Patterson AFB. Agreed,reported craft sizes over 30 feet in diameter would have been a monumental task totransport from great distances. However, I have not claimed that all craft have beenshipped to that base. I suppose if human purpose or the priority were strong enough,anything can be done. Notably, experts are still baffled by the feat of the ancientEgyptians who transported more than 2 million stone blocks, some weighting 15 tons, tobuild the great pyramids almost 5000 years ago. It seems they had a purpose. Maybe theU. S. Air Force had a purpose and the priority. CASE B-5: 1953, UFO Crash At White Sands Proving Ground In this case, Lt. Colonel RAB becomes a first person witness for Richard Hall, who is aveteran researcher and Editor of the MUFON UFO Journal. It begins with a letteraddressed to NICAP on April 8, 1964, from HC, a student at the Bob Jones University,Greenville, S. C., a copy of which was sent to me by Hall and is quoted in part as follows:HC Letter Addressed to NICAP, April 8, 1964: 'Here at school there is aninstructor was an adjutant to an Army Air Corps General at one of our New Mexicoproving grounds during the Korean conflict. I got the following story from him. In 1953, a flying saucer crash-landed near the White Sands Proving Grounds. AirForce personnel immediately rushed to the area and found the saucer, unharmed andunoccupied, with doors open. Upon searching the surrounding area, they came uponthe bodies of the saucer's four occupants, all dead. Shortly after this, certain top level personnel were given the true saucer story by AirForce officials. In his capacity, my source was included in this. They were shownthe bodies of the four occupants of the ship, which he described as from three tofour feet tall, hairless and otherwise quite human in appearance. An autopsy hadbeen performed on one of them to determine the cause of death. He described themas ovoid, with a length of twenty-five feet, and a width of thirteen feet. They wereshown the interior as well and there were no visible means of control, no visiblemeans of propulsion. He told me that since that time, the Air Force has beenworking intensely, although unsuccessfully, at trying to discover the means ofpropulsion. I can vouch for the validity of this information as well as the reliability of the personI got it from. This you can state as positive fact. Due to the fact that he is stillaffiliated with the armed forces, he prefers that his identity remain hidden. He alsotold me that this is top secret information which is highly guarded to prevent leaks.(Then why is he telling college students about it?' - Richard Hall)"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" In 1977, as a result of HC's lead, Hall arranged to meet Lt. Colonel RAB during a radiointerview in Washington, D. C., which he explains in his memo to me on June 24, 1980. RAB was a Lt. Colonel in Army Reserves, former helicopter pilot in Vietnam orKorea or both. As a former aide to an Air Force General, he saw firsthand four alienbodies at Langley AFB recovered from a crash in 1953 near White Sands, NewMexico. The four bodies, RAB said, were found outside the saucer which wasintact, with doors open. RAB is very religious. He was in Washington as a representative at a religiousconference. I have sent him Status Report II with a note suggesting that after he hasa chance to appraise your discreet handling of sensitive information, he might bewilling to talk to you. As I recall, he is not convinced the information should bemade public. Leonard Stringfield Comment: 'In follow-up, I wrote to RAB (xerox copy to Hall), butnever received a reply. According to RAB, four bodies were found outside of the crashedcraft in New Mexico in 1953. Significantly, his testimony parallels that of KA in Case A-2in this paper who photographed, from a helicopter, four bodies outside the craft in NewMexico in 1954. The difference of one year! KA stands firmly on the time of his incidentand unfortunately, RAB cannot be reached to verify his memory of the date. CASE B-6: 1948, UFO Crash in New Mexico The following notarized statement, signed by veteran researchers, John Meloney andLorraine Duchesne, bear witness to the testimony of the informant, WW. The notarizedstatement is a positive step in procedure to obtain credence for intermediary information.In recent years, John Meloney of MUFON and formerly of NICAP, and I have exchangedUFO information by phone and letter. Once we had occasion to meet personally on a UFOcase.Report by John Meloney and Lorraine Duchesne On February 9, 1980: \"OnFebruary 9, 1980, Lorraine Duchesne and I called on WW at his home in NewHampshire. In 1978, he had told Lorraine that he had been at the site of a crashedsaucer in Mexico many years ago when in the OSS (WWII's Office of StrategicServices). After talking with him awhile and explaining that I had considerableknowledge about UFOs and alien beings, and that I was formerly in the U. S.Intelligence Service, he gave us some guarded information. But I had the impressionthat he knew a lot more. I said I wondered if he could verify that he was at the saucer crash of 1952. He saidit was earlier than that. Eventually he admitted it was in 1948 in New Mexico. Hesaid he remembered the location so well he could take me to the exact spot rightnow, but he would not say where it was. (I had used the 1952 date as a test.) He said he saw the corpse of an alien lying on an examination table covered with asheet. He was reluctant to describe it, so I showed him the picture of the drawing ofa hand in Leonard Stringfield's report, The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome - StatusReport II, October 29, 1979. He said it was just like that, but had only three fingers.Then he admitted the small finger might have been tucked underneath the hand. Hesaid the hand was white, except for webbing between the fingers, which was brown.Only the hand was protruding from the sheet. He said a sheet covered most of the body, but the forehead was also showed abovethe sheet and that, too was white. The face was wide and wrinkles in the sheetshowed the outline of the head to be triangular with a point at the chin where itshould be. There was no bump in the sheet where the nose should have been. He said he thought it was some kind of 'throwback' in human evolution. It was notuntil he read a report about it (which he was not authorized to read) in the companyof a friend named \"L,\" that he realized he had been looking at an alien body. Bothmen were in the OSS at the time and were even part of a recovery team. He said they were all told not to discuss what they had seen and that the body wastaken to the U. S. He said there were a lot of Mexican civilians around and theywere not told to keep it secret. The implication was that there might still bewitnesses in the area who would remember the incident. The rest of our discussion pertained to technical aspects of UFO propulsion andadaptations of alien technology that have been developed on Earth. His remarks in"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"this area were not relevant to this particular incident though he showed a greatunderstanding of physics. He indicated a willingness to pursue technical mattersfurther if I could put him in touch with a scientist with certain qualifications whichhe outlined. I am sure that if I had not been introduced by Lorraine Duchesne and had not firstconvinced him that I already knew about saucer crashes, that he would not havediscussed the matter at all.' Following the conclusion of the statement were the signatures of four people: JohnMeloney, Lorraine Duchesne, a Notary Public and witness of WW, with the statement: 'Iswear that the above is a true and accurate report of the gist of our discussion.' CASE B-7: 1980 Story About 1962 or 1963 Craft and Alien Body Recovery, LocationUnknown. On a tip from Bill Hamilton of Phoenix, Arizona, at the MUFON Symposium in Houston,Texas in June 1980, I was soon in communication with Ms. CM of Los Angeles, asuccessful freelance writer who knew about a secret movie allegedly showing a freshlyrecovered alien craft with occupants, filmed inside an Air Force hangar. The movie, incolor with sound, and of 17 minutes duration, said CM, was in the possession of a personformerly in the government service whom she did not identify. According to CM, the filmshowed various aspects of high ranking personnel around the craft inside the hangar. Onephase, or scene, showed the removal of five alien dead bodies. 'It would be the proof,' emphasized CM, who claimed to be in a pivotal bargaining positionto discuss the matters with me. Knowing of my UFO work and my public relationsexperience, she asked for my recommendations for a plan to release the film to the media.We agreed there was a need for scientific back-up to prove that the film was authentic.CM said, 'A special screening has been arranged for me to see it next week. So far, onlythree people know about it.' The date of the retrieval was not clear. CM thought it was 1962 or 1963. 'You will get allthe facts soon,' she said. She added, 'You will probably be called here to see it yourself. Inthe meantime, it's in a bank vault.' When I called a week later, the mood had changed. CMsaid, 'The time is not right. He's scared and needs time to think. I'll call you when he'sready.' Weeks went by. Nothing. When I called again, I was told only that her source wasfrightened and in hiding. The last word I had from CM was a message in a Christmas Carddated December 22, 1980, which read in part, '...I have no news on the important matterwe discussed.' In 1981, I heard from another person who knew about the film. 'They moved in on him,' hesaid ominously. He did not identify the 'they.'\" Continued in Part 9 - Post Mortem of Two Alien Cadavers in U.
