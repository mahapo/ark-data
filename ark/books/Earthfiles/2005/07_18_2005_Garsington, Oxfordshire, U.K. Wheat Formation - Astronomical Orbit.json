For example, the number 1.001 when cubed becomes 1.003 if v / c =0.001.The angular factor for light bending around our Sun remains (1 + v2/c2) = 1 + 1 = 2,because there it is only acceleration, and v = c.Very intelligent indeed, in my view at least.\" Other UK Crop Formations in July 2005 July 18, 2005 - East Field near Alton Priors, Wiltshire, England "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Cropcircle Connector reports a second formation in Wiltshire's East Field wheat, reported on July 18, 2005.\"Appears to be about three to four circles in a horizontal line with a straight line at the bottom.\"Aerials upcoming.

Six circles, including the big one that \"crosses the road,\" were reported on July 3, 2005,in crop on the road from Horton to Devizes, Wiltshire, England.Aerial photograph © 2005 by Cropcircleconnector. Stuart Dike of Cropcircleconnector.com writes about this Horton, Wiltshire, formation: \"Crop Circles straddling and crossing roads, is quite a rare occurrence. However ithas happened twice this year already, with the Stephen Castle Down formation inHampshire with its pathway crossing the main highway. On this particular occasion,an actual circle has been completely cut in half by the road. The event itself, hasbeen made even more extraordinary by the fact that one side of the circle is setlower than the other side. This lower part to the circle is separated by a line of longgrass which runs parallel with the road. On closer inspection the grass was notaffected by the event, just the crop itself. The higher side also included a small ringed circle with a larger intact single circlejust behind the straddled circle. In all, this collection of oddball circles had a certaincharm to them, which is always important to have running alongside the morecelebrated and grander events in Wiltshire. The circle which crosses the road, was even more intriguing when comparing eachside. From an aerial perspective we can clearly see that the radius of the circle wasnot true, if the circle had been made in the proper way in open crop. The question iswas its creation affected by the presence of the road, of was it constructed in thisway purposely? It was very strange why the long grass along the side of the roadsidewas not at all disturbed. And this can be said for the grass verge on the open half of"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"the circle.\" July 3, 2005 - Hundred Acres in East Field, Alton Priors, Wiltshire,England Eight-fold star pattern surrounding central square grid pattern, reported on July 3, 2005, in theHundred Acressection of the huge East Field in Alton Priors, Wiltshire, England.
