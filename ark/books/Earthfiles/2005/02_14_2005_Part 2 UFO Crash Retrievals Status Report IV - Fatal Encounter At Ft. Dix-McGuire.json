Here begins Part 2of Status Report IV, written for the June 28-30, 1985, MUFON 1985 UFO SymposiumProceedings in conjunction with the national MUFON conference held in Saint Louis,Missouri. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H.Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report V begins at Earthfiles 012805.Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994.Leonard H. Stringfield: \"By March 1981, while preparing the text for Status Report III, Ihad decided it was time to take inventory; time for appraisal of the material on hand and ofmyself still in the midst of a heated controversy among researchers over the pros and consof UFO crashes and retrievals. I needed outside thinking and assessment of cases, a newperspective. To this end, I invited to my home two trustworthy friends who supported andcontributed to my endeavors: Dr. Peter Rank, Chief of Radiology at the MethodistHospital in Madison, Wisconsin; and Richard Hall, former Assistant Director of NICAPand then Editor of the MUFON UFO Journal. (Note 3: See statement in Epilogue, page49, of Status Report III, signed by Dr. Peter Rank and Richard Hall.) During our long weekend chats, evaluating every case I planned to publish, we agreed thatthe Ft. Dix-McGuire encounter was among the foremost as to potential value - providedwe could establish the genuineness of Morse. On this premise, I gave Hall his name andaddress, hopeful that new blood might stimulate a response. On April 10, 1982, Hall sent Morse a certified letter offering on my behalf to meet himanywhere, anytime, to discuss the incident and to provide professional services and funds,if needed. Curiously, the certified letter was received and signed for by Morse, April 12,1982, but the silence continued. It continued for 17 months! Then on September 27, 1983,Hall received an urgent letter from Morse, quoted as follows: USAF Security Policeman Morse Reply on September 27, 1983: 'I am writingyou in regards to your letter, 10 April 1982. I'm sorry that it has taken so long toanswer your letter. I had to be sure about you and your organization. My mail hasnot been monitored for some time now. However, I must not express my informationin the letter form. I have been warned, threatened and I have personally been"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"interrogated as recently as February 1983, in reference to the subject I discussedwith Len Stringfield. I also have further information ... which I know will interestyou ... I have the opportunity now to travel to D. C. area. So if you wish to contactme gain, you should still have my address. Hope to hear from you soon. If after 2weeks, I have not heard from you, I will no longer acknowledge my participationwith your group, nor will I answer any mail.' When Hall phoned the news to me I advised that he follow up quickly by letter andarrange for a meeting. Unfortunately, because of personal circumstances, Hall's reply onOctober 10, 1983, was sent a couple of days later than the deadline set by Morse. Again,silence. On November 30, 1983, I wrote Morse the following letter, quoted in part: Leonard Stringfield Letter to Morse on October 10, 1983: '... I held off writinguntil today, hoping that a little breathing time would give you the motivation towrite. It is difficult to believe that the mail I sent you in 1980 and 1981 failed toreach you. Or, if you had received my letters that you were unable to reach me insome manner. Obviously, there was interference both ways ... I felt hopeful thatHall's letter could open a new door of communications - or, better still, a personalmeeting with him.s have passed, I feel again concerned about your safety ...Assuming you are still a 'free' person, I suggest you simply call me, reversing thecharges. ...Jeff, please respond in some way, if only to acknowledge you receivedthis letter.' More surfaced by phone on December 6, 1983, and I heard his voice for the first time. Hecalled me at dinnertime, identifying himself by first name only. He said he felt safe now asenough time had passed since an official visitor warned him about his oath of secrecy.Talking cautiously for about 15 minutes, we covered the basics of many issues. Among hishigh points, however, were the disclosures that two days after the incident, he and otherson duty at the scene were summoned to Wright-Patterson AFB for interrogation and thateach was transferred promptly to a separate base overseas. His assignment was to a newSecurity Police Squadron in Okinawa. 'Others,' he said, 'went to the Philippines, Germanyand Korea.' Finally, he promised to answer any questions I had by letter and he gave mehis phone number. Morse's phone call opened the gates. I followed up the next day with a four-page letter inwhich I reiterated questions asked in 1980. Also, excerpted from my letter: Leonard Stringfield Letter to Morse on December 7, 1983: 'Your testimony isimportant. Of course, I'll need back-up witnesses such as Dick Hall, so thatcredibility is established. ...Enclosed is a copy of Status Report III. Your report,Case A3, is on Page 9 with my comments about our correspondence problems. Atone point, I wondered if you really existed, or if your letter was a hoax. So, you canimagine my relief when I heard your voice.' Morse replied promptly, his letter post-marked December 14, 1983, included a maphe sketched of the scene of action and a rough drawing of the body. (Answers tosome of my key questions appear later in the text of this paper wherever the subjectis appropriate.) Additional information came by phone, December 13, 1983. In thisexchange, I got the names and ranks of the officers who were his interrogators atWright-Patterson. These, he said, were obtained from a source still in the Air Forcehe preferred not to identify. December 14, 1983, Map of McGuire AFBand Ft.

Dix-McGuire case going from Square One to Square Two, my dialoguewith Morse was not on a constant but cautious track, always mindful of surveillance. The next event came as a surprise by certified mail postmarked December 23, 1983.On the flap of the envelope it said, 'Merry Christmas. I hope you like it.' Inside was axeroxed copy of the Incident/Complaint Report (Form 1569) that Morse had hintedby phone he might be able to procure as important back-up. The Report was brief,but essentially contained the same story told by Morse. Prepared by Desk Sgt. WCand signed by 1st Lt. WS, it was channeled to Col. Landon, Commanding Officer ofMcGuire AFB; Brig. Gen. Brown, Hdq., 21st Air Force (at MAFB); and the AirForce Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI).
