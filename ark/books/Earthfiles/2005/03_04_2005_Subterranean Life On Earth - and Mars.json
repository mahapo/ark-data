March 4, 2005 Socorro, New Mexico - Last week at the first European Space AgencyMars Express Orbiter conference in The Netherlands, the Italian physicist VittorioFormisano presented data about not only methane and water vapor in the Martianatmosphere, but formaldehyde. Small amounts of formaldehyde had also been reported byNASA and attributed to the oxidation and break down of methane.But Dr. Formisano who is the creator and principal investigator of the Planetary FourierSpectrometer on the European Space Agency's Mars orbiter reported at the meeting thathis data is showing about 10 to 20 times more formaldehyde than methane. If his dataproves to be accurate over time and other measurements, the amount of methane will alsohave to be revised upwards since most methane is oxidized as soon as it comes out of theground.Dr. Formisano told the ESA meeting of scientists; \"If you consider formaldehyde asoxidized methane, then Mars is producing 2.5 million tons of methane a year.\" One area onMars where his PSF instrument found the greatest concentration of methane was over theElysium Planitia near the Martian equator the same region that British scientist JohnMurray reported a large frozen sea - equivalent in size to Lake Michigan. [See Earthfiles02-22-05]Dr. Formisano said the amount of methane his PSF instrument has measured is too large tobe accounted for by any known geological process. Thus, he hypothesized that some othersource must be involved. In fact Dr. Formisano said publicly: \"I do believe there is lifeinside the planet Mars, maybe 50 to 100 meters below the surface. But there is a long wayto go to demonstrate that.\"Since there is no instrument on Mars to measure the isotopic ratio of the methane whichcould distinguish between an organic or inorganic source, scientists are now looking forheavier hydrocarbons in the Martian atmosphere, such as propane which cannot comefrom geothermal inorganic processes.Meanwhile, back on Earth in the caves of New Mexico and the nation of Mexico,renowned microbiologist and atmospheric chemist, Penelope Boston, is studying and"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"cataloging a huge array of creatures that literally eat their way through cave rock andleave telltale residues of their exotic, but organic, existences. She wants to assemble a\"Field Guide to Cave and Subterranean Microbes\" which can be used on future field tripsto Mars. I first talked with her during the ESA meeting in The Netherlands when Dr.Murray's pack ice discovery in the Elysium Planitia was first reported and Dr. Formisanosaid that was where he found the greatest concentration of methane.

Photograph © 2001 by Kenneth Ingham.Penelope Boston, Ph.D., Director, Cave and Karst Study Program and Assoc.Professor of Earth and Environmental Sciences, New Mexico Institute of Mining andTechnology, Saucer, New Mexico: \"That (methane higher over Elysium Planitia) isextremely exciting. One of the things we've been wondering about is whether the presentinstruments that are onboard the different space craft orbiting could narrow down themethane detection to the point that there might be point sources, or at least localizedsources, rather than an overall background methane signal?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Finding a solid indication that there are more localized sources of methane supports boththe potential life hypothesis and also the leaky hydrothermal from a volcanic sourcehypothesis. It doesn't distinguish between those, but makes it more likely (for life) thangeneralized air chemistry.POSSIBLY ORGANIC LIFE COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PRODUCING PEAKSOF METHANE, FORMALDEHYDE AND OTHER GASES IN THE MARTIANAT M O S P H E R E ?Sure, sure. But so can non-biological processes. So, what one has to do with thesetantalizing results is figure out ways to test them further to try to distinguish volcanicresidual activity and critters.ISN'T IT TRUE THAT FORMALDEHYDE UNDER THE STRESS OF UV HITTINGMARS COULD ONLY SURVIVE AS A MOLECULE IN THE ATMOSPHERE ONLYABOUT 7 HOURS...Yes, I think it is a very short half life. The half life is probably 10 hours, or on the order ofa day.THAT WOULD MEAN THAT IF THERE IS ENOUGH SUSTAININGFORMALDEHYDE TO BE MEASURED BY THE PSF, THEN THE IMPLICATION,THE HYPOTHESIS IS, THAT SOMETHING HAS TO BE GENERATINGFORMALDEHYDE ON A DAILY BASIS.Right, the same can be said for ammonia and indeed, methane. However, the methane halflife is more on the order of 100 years. But nevertheless, it's still sufficiently short thatpositive detection of it is quite significant. Cave Creatures On EarthHOW WOULD YOUR WORK LOOKING AT CAVES AND UNDERGROUND LIFE ONEARTH GIVE US SOME INSIGHT ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE LIVING ON EARTHAND MARS EMITTING METHANE , FORMALDEHYDE AND OTHER GASES?All of the gases reported on Mars are common products of the kinds of systems we arestudying on Earth. Most of the things that interest us are organisms that are takinginorganic materials and typically oxidizing them and getting a small amount of energy torun their life process from that reaction. Very often they excel in transforming the state ofdifferent materials.1) Metal Eaters Excrete Methane GasThere are systems that are anaerobic where oxygen does not enter into the system and inthose cases, these are methane-generating organisms.There are organisms that produce methane from CO2, using inorganic sources of energylike oxidizing metals and things like that. Then there are organisms that eat it. So, justabout every chemical transformation that you can think of is probably done by at least oneor more different kinds of micro-organisms.2) Manganese and Iron Eaters Leave Behind Crystal TrailsTelltale signature crystal residues left by manganese-eating microbes."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Photomicrographs courtesy Penelope Boston.Lechuguilla Cave, Carlsbad Caverns and other caves in New Mexico date from 5 to 12million years old. In those ancient caves, we find a number of microorganisms that maketheir living oxidizing manganese compounds and iron compounds.As a result of that, they are chewing their way through the bedrock in these caves anddegrading the bedrock and leaving these characteristic minerals behind. And they aredoing it today at a very slow rate.We're interested in that because the material they leave behind is pretty characteristicmarkers of residue from their lives there. So for example, even if all the microorganismsare gone, based on what we now know about what they do, we could look at material thathas some of these minerals and special crystal forms in there and say, 'Aha, we think theseare probably the products of micro-organisms.'WHAT DO THOSE ORGANISMS RELEASE IN TERMS OF GASES AS THEY CHEWTHROUGH THE CARLSBAD CAVE SYSTEM?They release CO2. None of these guys are methane releasers. But we have organisms thattransform hydrogen sulfide into sulfates and vice versa.3) Sulfur Eaters Release Aldehyde Gases - Including Formaldehyde?Penelope Boston, Ph.D., and colleagues explore dangerous sulfuric acid cavesin Mexico where many living organisms live on the sulfur rock and secret sulfuric acid.WHAT ABOUT FORMALDEHYDE?Haven't looked for that. That is not an uncommon product of microbial breakdown oforganic material. So for example, we have several different aldehydes in the sulfuric acidcaves we are studying in Mexico. So, we're looking there at critters that are making theirliving by metabolizing sulfur in one form or another. We know there are background dlevels of a number of different aldehydes that are unusual.SO THE SULFUR EATERS ARE RELEASING GASES SUCH AS FORMALDEHYDE?Something in the system is we don't know if it's the critters themselves or some othermicrobe that is breaking down organic material that the sulfur eating critters areresponsible for creating? Or what? We don't know the precise source, but we do know thelevels are higher.One of the things I have to emphasize is that the microbial subsurface communities are byand large novel meaning we don't have them already in the DNA data bases. This isbecause they have not been studied. So when you look at one of these areas, a lot of theorganisms are so different they could even be put in different domains. The part of ourteam that is working on molecular biology, Diana Northrup and her colleague at UNM, arelooking at these organisms and putting them near their closest relatives. But many of themdon't have many close relatives, or any, among the known bacteria. So, I can tell you thenames of a few that we find because they happen to be ones that have been identified"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"before, or are close to them. But by and large, these are really terra incognito!\"Snottites\" Are Sulfur EatersSome of the organisms we find in these 'snottites,' as they are called, in the Mexican cavesbecause they look like strings of snot basically. They produce all this gooey material andthey look like stalactites because they hang down.Snottites: These are gelatinous, dripping microbial draperies (\"mucus stalactites\") composed of elementalsulfur,iron oxide crusts, gypsum, and densely packed bacteria, and are found in caves. They are formally known asbio-vermiculations, although snottite is more descriptive. Snottites are produced by sulphurphilic microorganismsand drip sulphuric acid with a pH of 0.3 to 0.7. Other microbial stalactites are called \"phlegm balls,\"\"green slime,\" \"punk rocks,\" \"hairy sausages,\" \"slime balls,\" and \"beads on a string.\"SNOTTITES ARE ONLY IN THE MEXICO SULFURIC ACID CAVES?Absolutely. They are sulfuric acid beasts. They are fed by the hydrogen sulfide, theyproduce sulfuric acid, they produce these copious amounts of snot. It looks like snot and infact chemically, it's very similar to slimy stuff that would come out of a person's nose witha cold. It really is extra-cellular polysaccharide goo. Chemically it is very similar and theorganisms use it as a protection. It's part of their natural protection against theirenvironment and their way of chemically controlling their immediate environment. Theyactually produce sulfuric acid as a by-product of their metabolism. These guys are in therebusy producing acids.Then there is the abiological production of sulfuric acid just from hydrogen sulfide goinginto solution in the water and reacting with the oxygen. So, these caves drip with sulfuricacid. They are very difficult for us to work in, as you can imagine, and the atmosphere ispoisonous. But they are absolutely bursting with life! They are absolutely biologicallyintensely rich.There are so many organisms in there that I can't even regale you with the numbers.Everywhere you look in these caves, there is new microbial goo or a new different kind ofmicrobial mat. Many of them are busily precipitating and eating minerals while they growin the goo in which they are growing.THESE ARE THE ONES THAT WOULD RELEASE FORMALDEHYDE AND OTHERALDEHYDE GASES?Something in the system is. I don't think it's those organisms per se. I think we don't knowwhich of the many possible actors in the play are producing that material.COULD THE MICRO-ORGANISMS THAT YOU ARE STUDYING IN MEXICO THATLOVE SULFURIC ACID AND YOU ARE IN CAVES THAT ARE ALIVE WITH LIFEAND THAT THEIR DNA IS NOT REALLY KNOWN IN ANY OTHER CATEGORIESON THE EARTH. COULD THESE SAME ORGANISMS BE AT WORK INSUBTERRANEAN SYSTEMS AND CAVES ON MARS?Something like them, I think could very well be the case. We don't know whether or not ifwe find life on Mars right now, we don't know how to speculate whether or not it would berelated to us here. In other words, was there a single genesis of life because of materialbeing blasted out of Mars and carried here? Or vice versa? There is a shuttle mechanismfor potentially getting organisms from one place to another. So, we wouldn't know thatuntil we looked at the details of the organisms. But in terms of the way the organisms heremake their living in these environments, I think it's a very good model for the waypotential Martian subsurface microbes might be making their living."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"AND RELEASING GASES INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.Yes, releasing gases that they by-product from their metabolism.WHAT ABOUT TEMPERATURES? IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS ENOUGHHEAT IN THE INTERIOR OF MARS THAT SUBTERRANEAN ORGANISMS SUCH ASWHAT YOU ARE STUDYING IN MEXICO COULD LIVE THERE?I think that all you need is the ability to have liquid water and that could be at very lowtemperatures, below what we normally think of as freezing, if the solution is briny (salty).So one might imagine that you might have salty systems at quite chilly temperatures wherethe water could remain liquid and organisms could have evolved to tolerate that andprosper in that circumstance.So, that extends down the possible temperature at which organisms can live.BASED ON THE WORK YOU HAVE DONE IN MEXICO AND NEW MEXICO SOFAR IN CAVES, WHAT IS YOUR BEST EDUCATED GUESS ABOUT WHAT COULDBE UNDERGROUND ON MARS?I would guess, if it resembles Earth at all, that pretty much most of the subsurface wherethere was the availability of liquid water might be inhabited by low biomass, a low numberof organisms making their living very similarly to here.CHEWING AWAY ON ROCKS.Yes, chewing away, liberating materials out of the rock that they can use, dissolving therock in order to get to those materials, and leaving characteristic, telltale byproducts in theway of minerals, very characteristic minerals.YOU CAN LOOK FOR IN THE SULFUR RANGE FOR CRYSTALS THAT COULD BETHE BYPRODUCTS OF THE MICRO-ORGANISMS, CHEWING THE ROCKS UPAND EXCRETING THEM.Yes, exactly right. A lot of the stuff that we see in caves is basically bug poop. It doesn'tseem like animal poop. Very often, it is quite beautiful if you look at SEMs of some ofthese crystals, they are very beautiful minerals. But in the biological sense of the term, thisis really bug poop. So, you are working at scat basically!AN OVERLAPPING MAP THAT WOULD SHOW WHERE THERE WAS HIGHMETHANE AND FORMALDEHYDE, PLUS PERHAPS LARGE PACK ICE ON THESURFACE, COULD BE THE FOCUS FOR WHERE THERE COULD BESUBTERRANEAN LIFE?Oh, definitely. Putting together what data have been gathered by the different missions onsubsurface ice detection and/or water detection, and also anywhere that any kind ofreduced gas whether it's formaldehyde or methane or ammonia could be localized, thoseare the places you want to go.\" Lava Tubes At Olympus Mons Volcano on MarsFebruary 11 2004, this 3D view of the complete Martian Olympus Mons volcano has been derived fromUS Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) topographic data superimposed with theMars Orbiter Camera (MOC) wide-angle image mosaic.

One of the Martian lava tubes she has been studying from Mars Orbiter images is inOlympus Mons. The Olympus Mons lava tube has both sunken in sections and coveredsections. The covered, or roofed channels, would provide the most protection for livingorganisms.Interview continued:'THIS (OLYMPUS MONS LAVA TUBES) IS A PLACE YOU WOULD REALLY LIKETO GET ROVERS?I would love to go there! I would pack in tomorrow!! I would be packing my little robots.One of the things we've been working on the last number of years with some money fromthe NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts is a joint project that we are doing with theField of Space Robotics Group at MIT. We've come up with these cute, tiny, bouncing sortof tennis ball-sized micro-robots. We haven't built any yet. There isn't enough money in thesmall pilot project we've been doing. But we've developed these as a concept. They usesome of these artificial muscle material to propel themselves. They kind of boink their wayinto a cave and you deploy lots of them. The idea is you can make lots of them relativelyinexpensively and send them to Mars.One of our calculations shows we could send maybe a thousand of these little guys withina spacecraft the size that delivered the Mars rovers. So these guys (little ball robots) youcould withstand high mortality of them in these challenging environments and still have"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"enough to do the job. They would be able to communicate with one another essentially likea cell network does. So, node-to-node communication and make their way into some of thechallenging rough terrains that things like the big Spirit and Opportunity rovers have nohope of getting into. They would be able to do reconnaissance and a lot of valuablescience. It's a very different strategy for robotic exploration of these kinds of ruggedterrains.I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THIS BEFORE AND I'M TRYING TO GET IN MY MIND'SEYE THAT INSIDE OF THE SPACECRAFT THERE WOULD BE LIKE 1,000 BALLS...Yes, a thousand little guys that could deploy from the mothership there would be themaster robot...WHEN IT LANDED.Right, and if one could land that relatively near some interesting terrain. In my case, lavatubes, or even very rough surface terrains. These little guys could make their way slowlyusing very low amounts of power and be able to gradually make their way into theserugged terrains, including subsurface environments.\"More Information:Mysterious Life In CavesCave Pearls"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Penny Boston, Ph.D.: \"Cave pearls are a unique kind of formation found in quite a fewcaves and are made mineralogically out of the same mineral that produces moststalagmites and stalactites. But in this case, these are literally like 'pearls' in that they areloose and they occur in these little nests. I think you can see in the picture there are littleindentations where the spherical objects are sitting.But how are they made? Why would they not be drip features like the other drip featureswe see? How come if you have a drip, you just would not produce a stalactite orstalagmite? Why would you produce these curious objects? We know now the surfaces ofthe cave pearls are coated with bacteria and the bacteria are producing biofilm. Thebiofilm is facilitating the precipitation of calcite, which we know that it does. Livingsystems like that greatly enhance the precipitation of many minerals. So, the hypothesis weare beginning to test is that the biofilm itself is responsible for the cave pearls.\"Sulfur Eating Microbe MatsThe largest gypsum crystals in the world were discovered in a silver and zinc mine near Naica in Chihuahua,Mexico in 2001.The selenite crystals are as long as 20 feet. Inside the cave growing with the crystalswere large, thick mats of sulfur-eating micro-organisms.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
