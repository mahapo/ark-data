Return to Part 1 To be more computer-friendly, the reprint has been divided into parts. Here begins Part 14of Status Report III, written in June 1982. The series of status reports, I through VII, werewritten by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report IV begins atEarthfiles 021205. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. Leonard H. Stringfield: THE OMNIPRESENT I.I.I. \"Always present in my work is the I.I.I., or less cryptically, the 'Invisible Inside Informant.'New ones surface from time to time as old ones fade away. Sometimes on my wish, like astorybook genie, they respond with supposedly 'inside' UFO information ostensibly to helpmy cause in research. Usually, known by only a first name or as in one case, just as 'Uncle,'their backgrounds as UFO savants vary. Some allegedly serve, or have served, in theIntelligence community. One is a medical doctor and some are too shifty to be pinneddown. The I.I.I. are always polite, are not always readily reachable and are evasive when Iask for a one-to-one meeting. As to their motives, I can only guess. Maybe some are justtired of secrecy and genuinely want to help. But others I can see as plants who are a partof a plan to either spoon feed information as a test of public reaction or are to set up adisinformation trap. In the end of the spectrum is the KGB who is interested in theprogress of a duplication of a saucer-like craft by the U. S. military. Surprisingly, the general track record of the I. I. I. is good. Information related is oftencorroborative and sometimes scarily right on target. Sometimes even their advisementseems sincerely helpful. For instance, the last word I had from Robert Barry's C. I. A.source was to stay out of the 'photo fight' (in references to the alien cadaver photos).'They're all fakes,' he said. Previously this source intimated that the U. S., through NASA,had cooperated with Russia on the evaluation of a movie film showing UFOs in flight neartheir Salyut 6 space station. He also had informed me that 80% of the material in my paper(1978) was correct and predicted that I would face threats while delivering that paper inDayton, Ohio. A more recent 'Insider' known as 'Uncle,' who spoke through an intermediary, said that Iwas on the right track in my research, but cautioned that many reports I had received weredisinformation. He also said that I would never be able to prove my C/R case without the'hard stuff' which I would never get. Other notable points follow: 1. Possessing a photo of a maimed alien cadaver, he admitted that his knowledge of itsbiological structure made him turn to atheism. 2. He believed that UFOs were not of a benign nature; that he knew of one case in Texaswhere people had been mutilated in like manner as the classical cattle mutilation cases. 3. That the Kecksburg case (Item B-1 in Status Report II) involved a crashed spy plane,not a UFO. He also averred that the Ft. Riley incident (Case A-8 in Status Report II) andthe crash in Johannesburg, South Africa, were true. I note here that my C.I.A. informantalso had confirmed the Ft. Riley and Johannesburg cases. (See Case A-6, Status Report II). "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"4) He also said that AF interceptors fired on a UFO over Washington, D. C., in 1952, andbelieved that the reported UFO crash in Spitzbergen was a result of damage during thatengagement. Several sources gravitating into my realm of research have related firsthand knowledge ofgenetic experiments supposedly in league with UFO phenomena. One source in 1978offered proof of a cyborg experiment - x-rays, medical records and so on. I received bymail some military medical records, but the promised x-rays wrapped protectively neverarrived by mail nor were they delivered in person as he had arranged. On this same tack,another source claimed he had been used in a genetic experiment which tied in with thealiens. Then in recent correspondence from his confidante, I was told he was visited by astrange appearing female who shared her great wisdom about UFOs and space, whichnearly scared him out of research. Still another person who knew about a hospital 'outwest' which was involved in genetic experiments made urgent plans to meet me and neverfollowed up. Other Insiders of a less dramatic posture have told me of hidden UFO secrets undergroundin Colorado; of saucer-like craft that are 'ours' flying experimentally at Nellis AFB and at asecret base in New Mexico; of underwater UFO bases; of decipherable communicationswith aliens, ad infinitum. Many things have been said about UFOs by the Collective I.I.I. which are beyond thescope of this paper. If any of the points they have stressed are true, then the UFO isserious business and perhaps, according to official rationale, a good reason for silence. Themedical or the journalistic model will not help in dealing with the I.I.I. They are covert andmost, I believe, are legitimate insiders. Again, I don't know their respective motives andprobably never will. POSTSCRIPT ON TWO KEY CASES Most case histories cited in my two previous Status Reports remain essentially unchangedas most sources are no longer accessible for questioning. In two key cases, however, newdata have surfaced as follows: 1) Kingman, Arizona, 1953:First investigated and reported by researcher and author Ray Fowler. See pages 178-185 inSituation Red, The UFO Siege, Doubleday, 1977; and see Abstract 6 in Retrievals of theThird Kind. On August 11, 1980, I wrote to Fowler seeking permission to question hissource, Fritz Werner (pseudonym) concerning his experience in the Kingman, Arizona,retrieval operation. My questions and Werner's answers, dated September 2, 1980, follow: September 2, 1980, Written Q & A with Fritz Werner: 'Q: Details of observed facial features of the deceased entity, such as ear lobes,nose, mouth, eyes, neck, head size and shape. A: Since it's been 27 years, details like this are pretty foggy and I may even beinfluenced by other descriptions I've seen or heard in the interim. In short, I don'treally remember any earlobes. Eyes, I did not see. Head shape was oval. Nose, Idon't recall one. Q: Other body features such as arm length, hands, fingers, shoulders (square orrounded ) uniform, feet and so on. A: Body very slender. Overall, quite small. Arms disproportionately long by humanstandards. Q: Was protective clothing worn by investigators on scene of crash? Anyexplanation why such protective clothing would not be standard procedure duringexposure to alleged alien craft and bodies? A: No protective clothing. We were 'scanned' for radiation, however. Negative. Noexplanation why no protective clothing. Q: Were you and others checked medically following exposure to craft and bodies? A: Yes. No apparent bad effects. Q: Were special guards assigned to guard tent where the alien body was held? A: Yes."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Q: Was an attendant medic in tent with the recovered body? It seems that such aprecious 'cargo' would be under constant scrutiny. Any dry ice on the premises? A: Don't know. There were others in the tent. Q: Any official cameramen on the scene? A: Didn't see a photographer, but I'd be greatly surprised if there was none. Q: Any visits, since original disclosures, by authorities to remind you of your secrecyoath? A: Only once. About a month after the incident and that was by phone. Q: Any knowledge or rumors of cause of the crashed craft? A: No. Q: A former C.I.A. employee related to me through Robert Barry that parts of yourdisclosure were 'embellished' or 'just story.' He did not explain what parts. Can youclarify or describe any 'gray areas' in my published report in my paper, Retrievals ofThe Third Kind? A: Did not read the referenced article. Postscript: Don't wish to talk to anyone just yet. Think there is 'something going on,however, particularly in nature. I believe in the next 5 to 10 years, 'nature' is goingto unleash a series of phenomena (such as Mt. St. Helen's) which in some cases willbe disastrous. Have feeling that UFOs, psychic phenomena and these 'nature'occurrences are connected. 2) The Lumberton, Ohio, case, Spring 1977:Alleged skirmish between U.S. military forces and landed (or disabled) alien craft. SeeCase B-13 in Status Report II. The so-called Lumberton incident is vague, elusive, sensitive. One Cincinnati investigator(name withheld on request), intrigued by the report, decided to sleuth for more informationon his own. He said that he managed to talk to the Sheriff in the suspect area, whopromptly claimed that he had been ill and off duty during Spring of 1977 and there wasnothing in his records about a UFO encounter. A more recent investigation into the case by the intermediary of 'Uncle' (see OmnipresentI.I.I. in this report) brought more positive results. According to his version, he made anarrangement with a police officer of influence who claimed to be in a position to check therecords. By March 21, 1982, my intermediary reported that his friend learned enough fromhis 'contacts' to confirm the incident. He pinpointed the scene of action as being closer toWilmington than Lumberton and that there were casualties. Regarding the latter, he wasvague, claiming it was law enforcement personnel, not military. After the confrontation, the officer learned the craft lifted off and disappeared. Said myintermediary from Beavercreek, Ohio: 'He (the officer) knows a lot about the case and Ithink he's willing to talk about it. But he has to be careful.' I pressed for an early meeting, guaranteed anonymity, and waited for my middleman toname the time and place. On April 5, 1982, I got my call. As expected, my intermediarysomberly announced that his sleuthing police officer had a bad UFO experience and won'ttalk. 'He's been scared out of his wits,' he said. 'In March a UFO attacked his patrol car,burned the roof ... (thus) threatened (he contemplated) to pack up and leave his home, hisjob, everything.' I said, 'Now I've heard everything,' feeling almost unimpassioned by the turn of events.Later, I thought of the Sheriff who claimed illness during the Wilmington episode, and Iwondered about the story given me by the prying police officer and if he really had hisUFO experience that he claimed? Or was he was frightened off by another kind ofinterloper? On May 27, 1982, as I finished writing this Status Report III, I called my intermediary forthe latest on the newly named Wilmington case. 'It did happen,' he emphasized, 'and therewere injuries to law enforcement personnel, but the military came into the affair later, afterthe incident.'"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"When he said he had not heard from his police officer friend in recent weeks, I tossed inthe notion that he (officer) probably got his 'hands spanked' by a superior and that he madeup his UFO encounter as an excuse to bow out. My informant agreed. THE HYPOTHETICAL ALIEN My medical informants on staff of a major hospital, who in 1979 provided extraordinaryinformation for Status Report II (See Case A-7 of that paper), have since late 1980 beensilenced. One was a pathologist who allegedly performed an autopsy on an alien body. Herelated that he could no longer collaborate on the subject. His last message, however,reiterated through his colleague, concerned a hypothesis which postulated that early man -possibly Cro-Magnon or before - had been genetically altered or hybridized with an alienof superior intelligence to form Homo sapiens. According to his rationale, atrophiedhuman-like organs such as evidenced in the alien's genitals, suggested Earth-relatedevolutionary ties that are beyond coincidence. In essence, according to the pathologist, primeval Earth had become an experimental testtube for a new race whose development required periodic watching. Provocatively, thehypothesis which was presented at a secret high-level medical conference (with Russianattendance) does answer a lot of basic questions about the UFO; i.e., their cyclic visitation,some Biblical events, the lack of open communication, the lack of overt hostility, and aplausible explanation for abductions of random subjects for what seems to be physicalexaminations. Also, it would explain the prolonged high level international secrecy. Ifworld governments have medical and other back-up evidence to support the hypothesis,then the posture of silence takes on new meaning. Perhaps they assume that Man's conceptof himself in his world would be shattered. In the absence of firm evidence needed to convince research that the Homo sapiens is ahybrid, there is no shortage of speculative information about early extraterrestrialvisitation. Their possible exploits and influence about in Biblical times and in the culturesof the Maya, Inca and Aztec. China, too, has its story of a mysterious anthropological find.This one of evolutionary significance allegedly goes back 12,000 years to an 'ugly' offshootrace. Researcher Clark McClelland spent time in his Pittsburgh library and pieced togetherthe Chinese Connection from various Russian papers, including a 1963 issue of themagazine, Sputnik. His notes follow: Clark McClelland on the E.T. and Chinese Connection:'In 1937-1938, a Chinese archaeologist, Chi Pu Tei, made what has been called anextraordinary discovery according to Professor Alexander Kazantsev and ProfessorVyatcheslav Zaitsev of the Soviet Union. During the expedition into the isolated Payenk Ara Shaan (mountains) in China,archaeologist Chi Pu Tei and a group of students entered several caves of greatantiquity and discovered over 700 disc-shaped stone tablets consisting of double-grooved lines. They looked similar to present-day phonograph records, even havinga hole in the center. But they were of a less refined quality and much larger in size.They were later found to contain a strange style of spiral writing that does nototherwise exist in China or anywhere in the world. Another unique discovery is that in the remote area (where) these ancient recordswere discovered (according to a report by Soviet scientist Zaitsev) live two tribes,the Khams and Dropas, who are pygmy-like people with larger than usual heads andare difficult ethnically to classify. They are different from Chinese, Tibetans andMongols. In the caves where the disc tablets were found, small ancient graves were alsodiscovered aligned in neat rows. The unusual skeletons in those graves were allhumanoid of small proportioned creatures with large skulls. Their average heightwas 5 feet. Also, according to Chi Pu Tei, on some cave walls were found paintedastronomical formations of the sun, moon and star groupings and many small opendots shown converging on earth and in a direction that leads to a mountain region.Perhaps the dots indicate the route of alien craft. Present information indicates theskeletons and paints are at least 12,000 years old. In 1962, Tsum Um Nui, professor at the Peking Academy of Prehistoric Research,announced that he had deciphered some of the grooved symbols that he discoveredon several discs that had been brought back from the earlier expedition by Chi PuTei. Associating this with local legend, he released the following account which waseventually published in a German journal, Das Vegetarishe Universe. His story states: About 12,000 years ago a group of living things which were very"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"ugly (this statement is from local legend and a literal interpretation) landed theircraft (on earth). They were hunted by the local people and hid in caves. Later thelocal inhabitants returned with gifts making efforts to be peaceful. But when some ofthem (the creatures) emerged from the caves, they were immediately killed becauseof their ugliness. Other Chinese legends tell of little yellow creatures that came down from the stars.They had big heads and small bodies and were so ugly that local inhabitants attackedthem. According to Dr. Zaitzev, a couple of these stone discs were secretly sent toMoscow and several scientists were assigned to study the discs and elaborate ontheir composition. They found the discs are 0.8 meters in diameter and 2.0centimeters thick (approximately 31.5 inches in diameter by 7/8 inches thick). Eachdisc has double grooved indentations on which are engraved tiny symbols. Whentested, each disc was found to be granite with a high content of cobalt and aluminumand a highly resonant frequency indicating they may all be carrying an electricalcharge. Since granite is largely composed of silicates and cobalt in metal withproperties of magnetism and corrosion-free, these stone discs could practically lastforever. These embedded alloys of silicon, cobalt and aluminum which are found as part ofthe spiral grooves could very possibly form an electronic recording capability similarto that used in present-day magnetic recording machines. Let us consider thistheory. Perhaps these strange discs carry two messages: one written in symbols onthe grooves and perhaps sounds or information recorded within the electricalcharges. If true, it could be in the language of its original creators - the frail creatureswith large heads in myth and legend.' While out hypothetical alien lies on his alleged cold slab somewhere in secret custody, weare left only to guess about other key parts of his physiological structure such as the brain,the reproductive organs or what the Thing ingests for sustenance. When my prime medicalsource went silent, there was an 18-month gap before a new medically informed insider ofthe I.I.I.-type emerged. He not only hastened to confirm the general data related by mymedical source, but added that the alien without a digestive track thrives by the absorptionof electrical energy. Curious as to particulars, I tried to get my intermediary to reach his'Uncle' for more details. But like others who claim to have served in the Wright-PattersonInner Sanctum, he never resurfaced. The Alien Hand Pondering all the gaps in the alien's anatomical puzzle, curiously it is the hand with fourfingers, webbing and no opposable thumb that is described most often by diverse sources.Here, I must go back to my first and second status reports [ Status Report I and II, to bereprinted in upcoming Earthfiles. ] which include drawings of an alien hand structurebased on information from several firsthand observers. One of my sources (allegedlyC.I.A.), when he reviewed my drawing prior to the release of my first paper in Dayton inJuly 1978, suggested that I remove a knobby protuberance which I had sketched in at thenormal thumb joint of the hand. He commented that my rendition bore a likeness to thehands he had seen on the two bodies in his 1962 retrieval. See drawing below. When Status Report II was released through MUFON in January 1980, the influx ofinformation about UFO crash/retrievals was nearing its peak. During this period ofeuphoria, I received a photograph from a source showing a close-up of a skeletal hand thatwas strikingly similar to my drawing. In the photo was a claw-like appendage withindistinct webbing between each gnarled digit, joined to a thick, swivel-like wrist on anarm, sharply bent at the elbow, which joined a bulbous socket at the collar bone and a hulkof anthropoid rib cage. According to my source, the specimen was found in primordialshale and was procured by the U. S. Air Force in Florida, sent to Wright-Patterson andfinally shipped to a university in Pennsylvania where it is preserved for 'secret study in agrotto lab.'"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Photo reprints showing skeletal remains of a creature unknown to science, found allegedly in shale.According to my source, the specimen was sent to a university in Pennsylvania by the U. S. Air Forcefor secret study. Left print which I originally received seemed to me that it was clipped off of a photoshowingmore of the remains. When I questioned this and requested more detail, I received the photo at Right, whichshows the clavicle or the collarbone and what appears to be the creature's extended right arm (as if entitylaying on stomach). Curiously, the head is either missing from the skeletal remains or I was notpermitted to have a full-view photo in my possession, for reasons unexplained. Information about the hand of the alleged alien, as sparse as it is from firsthand witnesses,may provide some biological clues. The webbing, for instance, suggests that the creature isamphibian which may further find plausibility in that the epidermis is so often described asscaly or reptilian. This brings to mind a creature dubbed 'dinosaur man,' imagined by Dr.Dale Russell, Chief of Paleontology at the National Museum of Natural History in Ottawa,Canada. [ Editor's Note: RUSSELL, DALE A.Dr. Dale Alan Russell is a vertebrate paleontologist and author. He is a ResearchProfessor at North Carolina State University and Senior Curator of Paleontology atthe North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. Russell has named the followingdinosaurs: Alxasaurus (Russell and Dong, 1994), Archaeornithomimus (1972),Atlasaurus (Monbaron, Russell and Taquet, 1999), Cristatusaurus (Taquet andRussell, 1998), Daspletosaurus (1970), Dromiceiomimus (1972), Dyslocosaurus(McIntosh, Coombs and Russell, 1992), Lurdusaurus (Taquet and Russell, 1999),Sigilmassasaurus (Russell, 1996), and Sinornithoides (Russell and Dong, 1994).Russell has written many papers and books, including, \"Odyssey in Time: TheDinosaurs of North America\" 1989 and \"Systematics and Morphology of AmericanMosasaurs\" (1967). In 1971, Russell and the physicist Wallace Tucker published apaper (in the journal Nature) called \"Supernovae and the extinction of the dinosaurs,\"which theorized that a supernova caused the K-T Extinction. This was the firsttheory to put the blame on an extra-terrestrial phenomenon. ] Model of a dinosauroid with the reconstruction of Stenonychosaurus behind.Conceived by Dale A. Russell in 1981 and created by Ron Sequin in 1982,The National Museum of Natural Science, Ottawa, Canada."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"\"Dinosauroid.\" Sculpture by Dale Russell and Ron Seguin, 1982,Canadian Museum of Nature, Ottaw a, Canada. Source:The Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, Astronomy, and Spaceflight . Leonard Stringfield: \"Before Russell's hypothetical dinosaur made news in 1981, I hadreceived from the scientist in July 1980 two scholarly papers: The Evolution ofIntelligence on Earth and Reflections of the Dinosaurian World. Both papers were usefulto me in understanding the biology of early Earth. Of note, during a 1981 interview,Russell expounded that UFO aliens from outer space may have descended from a supersmart dinosaur like the kind that roamed our Earth eons ago. He was also quoted as saying,'It is quite legitimate to assume that on other planets dinosaurs lived on to becomehumanoid beings with the high intelligence necessary for interplanetary travel.' Corroborative information came from Ted Phillips, a specialist in UFO physical traceresearch for CUFOS (Center for UFO Studies) and MUFON (Mutual UFO Network).When Phillips saw my drawing during a meeting at the United Nations, hosted by PrimeMinister Gairy of Grenada (with Drs. Hynek, Saunders, Vallee, Pohar of France, andastronaut Gordon Cooper), he was 'shocked out of my seat.' Ted compared its likeness toan alien hand appearing in a photograph he had seen from a reliable source. See statementPage 34, Status Report II. If the freak skeleton is not another 'Piltdown Man' hoax, the problem is finding its link inpre-history. And if not a hoax, is it a vestige of experimental genetics eons ago to whichmy medical informant had alluded? And in comment, why should a skeleton of somethingextinct be kept secret? In an attempt to get professional opinion on the skeleton, I took the 'hand-rib cage'photograph to Dr. Anthony J. Perzigian, Ph.D., Anthropologist at the University ofCincinnati. His response by letter was dated November 15, 1980, and follows: November 15, 1980, letter from Anthropologist Anthony J. Perzigian, Ph.D.,University of Cincinnati: 'Earlier this month at your and Professor Harry Mark'srequest, I examined photographs in your possession. Pictured were some unusualkind of creature which gave the appearance of having a simian-like (or ape-like)thoracic anatomy at least insofar as one could tell from the rib cage. The limbs,however, displayed no particular simian-like features. The upper arm wassignificantly longer than the forearm in proportions one does not see in apes. Thecarpal or wrist region was quite indistinct; the hands gave the appearance of havingfewer than five fingers; the fingers seemed to have claws instead of the morecommon nails one finds among higher primates. 'This organism, if it is just that, is quite peculiar and one that I cannot classify as togenus and species. Moreover, I would hesitate, on the basis of a photo or two, tosuggest that it is some extra-terrestrial form vis a vis a fabrication. Best of luck inyour work.' During the spell when many of my sources were silent, many researchers pledgedtheir moral support. Others offered professional help. Al Reed, artist in Sunnyvale,California, offered both. On the hope that I could get more physiological detailsfrom my medical sources, he rendered an elaborate set of illustrations of the handand wrist showing hypothetical bone structure with flesh overlays in color. But atthis point in time, my medical informant had dried up and without his expertise, theproject was aborted. Some of Reed's renderings are shown below. I hope for furtherguidelines by my medical source who allegedly performed an autopsy on an alienbody in early 1950s."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" Uppe r le ft Drawing 1 is a sketch of the hand that I (Len Stringfield) drew for the critical view of aformer C.I.A.employee in 1978, who claimed to have seen deceased aliens during a recovery in New Mexico, 1962.He advised only that I remove a small protruding nub which I depicted indicating a vestigial thumb.Drawings 2 and 3 are by artist, Al Reed, showing alien hand structure (sketch 3 by Al Reed 9/6/80).Drawing 2 is Al Reed's textured conception of the hand based on my sketch (Draw ing 1by Len Stringfield).
