The land is very unusual with vertical upthrust anddownthrust, in contrast to the rest of flat Ohio. One theory was that the unusual geologicalstructure might be the remains of an old volcano.But now geologists and geophysicists at Ohio's Wright State University, the OhioGeological Survey, and the University of Vienna in Austria, have detected the presence ofcracked quartz crystal and iridium beneath the crater. Iridium is a silver-grey metal notcommon on Earth and is largely associated with comets and meteorites. The new theory isthat 256 million years ago, an object from outer space hit the ground so hard it created the6-mile diameter crater that fractured quartz crystal as far down as 10,000 feet, or nearlytwo miles.This week I talked with the science team leader who mapped the size of the impact crater.He is Doyle Watts, Ph.D., Assoc. Prof. of Geophysics, Wright State University,Department of Geological Sciences, Dayton, Ohio.Interview:Doyle Watts, Ph.D., Assoc. Prof. of Geophysics, Wright State University, Dept. ofGeological Sciences, Dayton, Ohio: \"The odd thing about the geology of the area is thatthere is an outer ring of rocks about 6 miles in diameter that have dropped down about1,000 feet. They are not in the right place, from the geologic point of view. The other thingis that in the center of the structure, the rocks come up 1,000 feet and they are intenselydeformed. They look like they have been pulled through a napkin ring. It's very muchunlike any of the rocks one finds in Ohio which are normally flat lined and have not beendeformed.This is the geological structure about 6 miles in diameter and it's located on geologicalmaps. And the Native Americans built the monument on the flank of the geologicalstructure, the southwestern flank. So, the Serpent Mound monument is not located in themiddle of the geological structure. It's located on the southwest flank of the structure.Above: Satellite image in filter that emphasizes the lighter green perimeter of the crater that drops down1,000 feet and the slightly darker green center that rise back up 1,000 feet where rocks are intensely deformed,\"as if pulledthrough a napkin ri ng.\" Below: Map for location reference in Ohio and counties.

The reason we worked on it was to sort out between the twohypotheses that explained it. In the 1920s, the people that mapped the geological structurethought it was an old volcano. But more recently in the 1960s, a group of workers thoughtit was the scar of an impact (crater).We decided to investigate the geological structure in more detail because we had dataavailable. There was seismic data that the oil companies used to image the subsurface andthere were rock cores collected in the 1970s that were drilled down to a depth of about1700 feet by an exploration mining company. We had that data available and decided thetime was right to look at it.We did not discover the feature. It's been known from a long time ago and I feel the NativeAmericans probably noticed there was something strange about the area because that'swhere they chose to build the very significant monument (Serpent Mound).WHAT PRECISELY DID YOU FIND?In the core, we found rocks that had been shattered and had been pushed downwards,down to the bottom of the core at 1700 feet below the surface where the core wascollected. There were actually two cores one at the center of the geological feature andone at from the periphery of the geological feature. We found features called 'shattercones.' These show very fine fracture lines on the surface of the rock when you break it.They are indicative of a passage of a shock wave through the rock. My colleagues foundquartz that had been deformed. What happens when you get a shock and it squeezes thecrystal quartz at very high pressures and there is partial melting along certain crystal plainsdue to the intense pressure. My colleagues found quartz that had been subjected to thataffect. Impactor's Energy Greater Than Atomic BombTHE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THE PRESSURE OF IMPACT FROM SOMETHINGLARGE FROM OUTER SPACE COMING AND HITTING IN OHIO 250 TO 260MILLION YEARS AGO WOULD HAVE THIS KIND OF CRACKING OF QUARTZCRYSTAL UPON IMPACT, SIMILAR TO WHAT WE WOULD FIND IN ATOMICBOMB TESTS?Yes, yes. You would need the amount of energy released that you would get in an atomicbomb to produce such a texture in these particular crystals. Let me say that the energy thatproduced the Serpent Mound structure is far greater than any nuclear device that has beenactivated by humans. No atomic device has created a crater 6 miles across and fracturedthe rocks so deeply. Crater Impact Goes Down Nearly Two MilesDOWN TO ABOUT 1700 FEET AT THE MAXIMUM?No, that was the maximum depth at the core. I would say at the minimum we don't knowwhat's beneath the core because it ended at only 1700 feet.SO IT COULD BE 6 MILES IN DIAMETER AND WHO KNOWS HOW DEEP?Well, we actually have a pretty good idea how deep because that's where I contributed"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"most to the effort. The oil industry had gathered some seismic data. This is a way ofimaging what's beneath the Earth using soundwaves. The device that is used is a vibrasizedtruck. It's a large truck that has a 2-ton speaker mounted on it. The reaction mass willmove up and down between 6 to 100 times per second producing soundwaves at thosefrequencies.I processed the data that had been gathered and I can say that looking at those images thatthe effect of the geological structure goes down about two miles, about 10,000 feet. Wecan see that the rocks are deformed in the seismic image down to that depth.HOW BIG DO YOU THINK THE OBJECT WAS THAT CAUSED ALL OF THISDESTRUCTION?It depends on the nature of the object. If it were dense and heavy like an iron meteorite. Itwouldn't have been all that big maybe the size of two or three football stadiums. If you canimagine something that big.If it were lighter, say a fragment of a comet, it would have needed to have been biggerthan that. But I think we're talking about something that's maybe a few hundred metersacross, as opposed to a few thousand meters.IF IT HAD BEEN AN IRON CORE METEORITE, WOULDN'T YOU BE ABLE TOFIND THE RESIDUE OF THAT IRON METEORITE?I don't think so if it's so old, at least 256 million years or older. Meteorites like that are notstable at the surface of the Earth. They weather quite readily. They'll rust effectively. If250 million years have gone by, it's unlikely it would have been preserved. What ISpreserved and my colleagues have found it was Dick Carlton of the Ohio GeologicalSurvey and Mark Baranoski, worked with Christian Koeberl at the University of Vienna.They sent some samples to Prof. Koeberl who found higher concentrations of the elementiridium. Iridium is not all that common on the Earth and they found in samples taken fromwithin the core had higher concentrations of iridium. That's probably all that's left fromimpacting body (comet or meteorite).By the way, this is the sort of thing that gives evidence that supports the impact theorybecause volcanic activity just would not produce the levels or iridium that my colleaguesdiscovered. Outer Space Iridium ConcentrationTen Times Normal Earth CrustI UNDERSTAND IT IS TEN TIMES ABOVE WHAT IS USUALLY PRESENT IN THEEARTH'S CRUST THE AMOUNT OF IRIDIUM AT THE SERPENT MOUND?OK, the sample they looked at which was gathered from the core I'm not sure how deep itwas but it was around 1,000 feet deep certainly had ten times the normal concentration ofiridium. I don't know that anybody's found an iridium anomaly near the surface.BUT WE THINK IRIDIUM IS LARGELY ASSOCIATED LARGELY WITHASTEROIDS AND COMETS, DON'T WE?Yes, yes. That is the current thinking, the current wisdom. You have to have anextraterrestrial source for such concentrations of iridium.NOW, I THINK IT WAS FROM THE PLAIN DEALER NEWSPAPER THAT IT SAID:\"Fine grains of sand taken from 1439 feet down appear deformed when viewed under amicroscope. There even seem to be particles of soot left from scorched limestone, althoughresearchers say additional work is needed before the strange black material is positivelyidentified.\" HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO FIND OUT WHAT THIS BLACK MATERIALON THE SCORCHED LIMESTONE IS?I'm not aware of any further progress on that. My colleagues at the Ohio GeologicalSurvey that were examining the thin sections and the microscope slides they produced andI don't know if they have made any further progress on that.ANY SP ECULATION?No. (laughs) That's there line of work, not mine.COULD IT BE CARBON FROM BURN?It could be carbonaceous material. I don't think it would have been material from a fire"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"that had been created by the impact because the temperatures at that depth were not veryhigh, at least not for very long. I don't know what would have burned. I think if I had tospeculate if you look at some of the rocks exposed at the surface as well as in the core,there is evidence that hydrocarbons had once passed through the rock. It's not activehydrocarbon. It's a very thick residue left behind. So I wouldn't recommend drilling any oilwells, at least at those depths. But it could be bitumen that was left behind by the passageof hydrocarbon through the porous rocks. That could have happened any time after thecreation of the geologic crater feature. Magnetic Field AnomalyANY LINK BETWEEN THE PRESENCE OF A HIGHER AMOUNT OF IRIDIUM ANDPERHAPS MAGNETIC FIELD ANOMALIES OVER THAT AREA?I don't think so. We've measured the magnetic field over there, and there is a magneticanomaly. One can use geophysical analysis to determine the depth of the production of theanomaly and the anomaly that is there is produced by rocks that are at least 10,000 feetdeep. That's well below the maximum depth of that core.THE MAGNETIC ANOMALY HOW DOES THAT REGISTER AT THE EARTH'SSURFACE? COULD IT EXPLAIN WHY THE HOPEWELL INDIANS, AS THEY WERECALLED, MIGHT HAVE BUILT THE SERPENT MOUND THERE SO LONG AGOBECAUSE OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD ANOMALY?I don't know they would have had any means to detect it. You can't really see it, even ifyou have a magnetic compass. I don't know they had magnetic compasses. To actually seethe anomaly, you have to make measurements over quite a large area. That's pretty muchover 30 to 40 square miles. Using a device called a 'proton procession magnetometer' thatmeasures the intensity of the field with considerable precision. The amplitude of themagnetic anomaly is not more than 1% of the total field there. So, whatever the nativesnoticed and chose that site there to build the Serpent Mound monument, I don't think itwas the magnetics. It might have been the strange disposition of the rocks themselves.But what makes it so intriguing is that this is the very place that the native Americanschose to build the monument. The area must have been very sacred to them. It begs thequestion: why would they choose this 6-mile across circle area to build the mostspectacular effigy mound seen from the sky? \" Did Serpent Mound Impactor Cause Extinction Event?I asked Prof. Watts if there is any evidence of an extinction event that would match theSerpent Mound impact 256 million years ago?He pointed out that the timing is close to what is called the \"Permian/Triassic boundary.\"That was the largest extinction event the world has experienced so far, occurring about255 million years ago. 90% of all marine species died out and 70% of vertebrate species onland went extinct. Exactly what happened is unknown. The strongest hypothesis is that alarge meteorite or piece of comet fell to Earth.After that, the next big outer space impact was 65 million years ago when something hugelanded near the Yucatan Peninsula and wiped out 70% of all earth life, including thedinosaurs.Compared to those Permian and Yucatan impacts, whatever came down in the SerpentMound, Ohio, region was small in comparison. There would have been local devastationover an area maybe the size of Ohio from the debris falling out of the sky. But Prof. Wattsdoes not think the Serpent Mound impact could have caused wholesale extinctions aroundthe Earth by itself. But he qualified that conclusion by saying: If there had been lots ofmeteoritic or comet impacts around the world at the same time - that might have had asignificant impact on Earth life such as the Permian/Triassic boundary catastrophe. But sofar, there is no evidence that connects the Permian/Triassic extinctions and the SerpentMound crater event.More Information:See other Earthfiles about Serpent Mound, Ohio· 10/17/2004 -- American Crop Formations: 1880-2004"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"· 09/22/2004 -- Miamisburg and Serpent Mound, Ohio Crop Formations: GeometriesCompared· 09/10/2004 -- Update on Miamisburg, Ohio, Corn Pictogram - Balls of Light?· 09/02/2004 -- Updated Photos: Big, Impressive New Corn Formation inMiamisburg, Ohio· 05/22/2004 -- 2004 Overview of Crop Formations in Five Countries· 12/13/2003 -- What Snapped Off Big Trees in A Circle in Ruby, Alaska?· 11/01/2003 -- Another Soybean Formation in Ohio· 10/17/2003 -- 2003 \"UFO Flap\" in Ohio· 10/10/2003 -- Updated - Ohio Hunter's \"Deer Camera\" Photographs MysteriousGlowing Disk· 10/05/2003 -- Part 3 - Paint Creek Island, Ohio Crop Formation Photographs· 10/03/2003 -- Part 2 - Military Interest in Serpent Mound and Seip MoundFormations?· 10/02/2003 -- Part 1 - Another Soybean Formation Near Seip Mound in Ohio· 09/12/2003 -- 2nd Soybean Crop Formation in Ohio is Manmade.
