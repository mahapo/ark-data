The absence of suchextraterrestrial civilizations visiting Earth is the Fermi Paradox.\"- Geoffrey Landis, Ph.D., Aerospace Engineer, NASA Our sun is one of several hundred billion stars in the spiral galaxy, Milky Way.The nearest large galaxy that has a similar shape to the Milky Way is M31, also known asthe Andromeda galaxy, pictured above. Photograph from Univ. of Arizona. February 11, 2005 Corvallis, Oregon - If Someone Else is out there in the Milky Waygalaxy, Andromeda galaxy or elsewhere in the vast cosmos, why aren't they more evidentto Earthlings? That question is at the heart of the Fermi Paradox which four Ph.D.scientists recently addressed in the mainstream scientific Journal of the BritishInterplanetary Society. (JBIS, Vol. 58, pages 43-50.) To review entire paper, see Websitebelow. The four scientists are:James Deardorff, Ph.D., Research Professor emeritus, retired in 1986 from theDepartment of Atmospheric Science at Oregon State University; also worked assenior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) forsixteen years. Now Dr. Deardorff lives in Corvallis, Oregon;Bernard Haisch, Ph.D., former Director of the California Institute for Physics andAstrophysics in Palo Alto, California;Bruce S. Maccabee, Ph.D., Research Physicist, Naval Surface Warfare Center(NSWC), in Dahlgren, Virginia; author; and Fund for UFO Research;Hal Puthoff, Ph.D., a pioneer in the physics of zero point energy research andDirector of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Austin, Texas.Their JBIS journal article is entitled \"Inflation-Theory Implications for ExtraterrestrialVisitation.\" Inflation Theory has replaced \"Big Bang\" as the latest general term for modelsof the very early universe which involve extremely rapid expansion from somethingperhaps the size of a grapefruit to the entire observable cosmos - in only the fraction of asecond. Joining inflation is Quantum Super String Theory that postulates there are at leasteleven dimensions. Faster-Than-Light Travel?In addition, modern quantum physicists seriously discuss faster-than-light travel that coulduse small black holes called \"worm holes\" to make short cuts through space-time, an idea"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"illustrated in the January 2000 Scientific American article, \"Negative Energy, Wormholesand Warp Drive\" © 2000 by Lawrence H. Ford and Thomas A. Roman.Scientific American, January 2000: \"If a wormhole could exist, it would appear as a spherical openingto an otherwise distant part of the cosmos. In this doctored photograph of Times Square, the wormhole allowsNew Yorkers to walk to the Sahara with a single step, rather than spending hours on the plane to Tamanrasset.Although such a wormhole does not break any known laws of physics, it would require theproduction of unrealistic amounts of negative energy.\"Another approach to faster-than-light travel would not move the traveler, but wouldstretch and bend space-time around the traveler. That is known as the \"Alcubierre WarpDrive.\"This Warp Drive Metric supposes a contraction of spacetime in front of a body,with a expansion behind it. The expansion and contraction can be seen throughhttp://members.tripod.com/da_theoretical/wdtheory.htmlthe coordinatesx and r=(y2+z2)1/2. Drawing ©2001: Edward Halerewicz, Jr.[Editor's Note: Edward Halerewicz, Jr. describes the warp drive: \"In fact whatAlcubierre is proposing is using a form of bipolar (or \"dual\") gravitational waves as amethod of propulsion. Gravitational waves in general relativity are planar andhence, each wave expands and contracts. However, the Alcubierre metric, inprinciple, suggests that such an effect could be bipolar, possibly explaining thenecessity for a 'negative energy' requirement. (However, this is purely speculationon my part). What this metric truly suggests is that such a manipulation of spacewould cause spacetime to propel a localized region of space (referred to as a warpbubble) by expanding and contracting the metric field. Since gravitational radiationis believed to propagate at the speed of light, the propulsion of this space is similar inprinciple to how electric and magnetic fields cause electromagnetic radiation topropagate.\" See Alcubierre Warp Drive website below.]If human physicists today are contemplating faster-than-light travel in our ever-inflatinguniverse, why couldn't there be other, older intelligences out there which have alreadysolved the problems of jumping around great distances in and around galaxies? Finally,could the UFO phenomenon be evidence of such advanced technologies visiting Earth?The journal article begins with a discussion of what is called \"the Fermi Paradox.\" Thisweek I talked with meteorologist Jim Deardorff, who originally began the JBIS paper andasked the other three to join him in the goal of getting the taboo subject of researchingextraterrestrial visitation published in a mainstream scientific journal. First, I asked Dr.Deardorff to explain the Fermi Paradox. (See More Information at end of this article.)Interview:James Deardorff, Ph.D., Research Professor Emeritus, retired Meteorologist fromthe National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), Boulder, Colorado, who nowlives, researches and writes in Corvallis, Oregon: \"Enrico Fermi is a pretty well knownphysicist. He is no longer alive, but back in the 1940s, he was one of the first about 1950 the first to open up the idea of extraterrestrials perhaps being around in the galaxy. Overlunch one day at Los Alamos, he discussed with his colleagues this problem: since they(ETs) could be so far advanced over us, why don't we see them? Why aren't they around?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"This made the topic a little more respectable for other scientists to start debating, whichthey did. Some papers came out talking about how it would take only a few million years ifone extraterrestrial race were even only a few centuries ahead of us in their technology forthem to start exploring from their planet and go to other stellar systems, even if they couldonly travel at 5 to 10 percent of the speed of light. Then when they found a habitableplanet to colonize it, or to exploit it. After maybe giving them a thousand years or more tosettle around on that planet, the idea is they would go out and explore the next star fromthem. And the idea is that eventually the whole galaxy should be colonized by the ETs whowould not be all that far ahead of us. The whole process, they figured, would take onlyabout 10 to 20 million years if you calculate that out.HOW DID THE EMERGENCE OF THE INFLATION THEORY IN THE 1980SCHANGE OR IMPACT THE DISCUSSIONS THAT THE FERMI PARADOX HADPROVOKED?I think it was basically a more recent paper that came out just a year ago by Ken Olum ofTufts University in the Dept. of Astronomy. He's an astrophysicist. He suggested thatFermi's Paradox is stronger than you would think. The question that Fermi proposed - Whyaren't they here? - is even worse now in modern physics for a galaxy, or universe, thatunderwent inflation - which most astrophysicists think our universe did in an early phaseof terrific expansion that makes the universe almost infinite in size. There should be somany chances for ETs to be around that we should find ourselves immersed in galacticcivilizations all over the place. So again: why aren't they around? How The JBIS Paper Survived First RejectionsWHAT PROVOKED YOU AND BERNIE HAISCH AND BRUCE MACCABEE ANDHAL PUTHOFF TO PRODUCE THAT VERY INTERESTING PAPER, \"INFLATION-THEORY IMPLICATIONS FOR EXTRATERRESTRIAL VISITATION?\"That's a nice question because those, like myself, are scientists who have looked into theUFO phenomenon over the years. We realized how tough it is to get any good paper intoscientific journals telling about what has really been going on with the UFO phenomenoninto journals that mainstream scientists typically read. That's because most science journaleditors have not been considering any received papers which involve the UFO topic evenworthwhile to send out for review.I felt that every few years - every 5, 10 or 20 years - we really ought to keep testing thejournal editors and find maybe attitudes are changing a little bit. Maybe journal editors arenow more reasonable or slightly more open-minded. So, we should not just give upbecause the curtain of ridicule against the UFO phenomenon has been so strong over theyears.So, we decided we would give it another try, even though all of the authors includingmyself realized we had scarcely any chance of getting the paper into the most prominentscience journals. In the U. S., there is one called Science and in Britain, it's the one calledNature. We did indeed submit our paper to those two journals first, just to test them out,and they would not even send them out for review. If they had sent them out for review,it's quite likely they would have found some good reviewers. But in this business,everything depends on who the editor wants to send the paper out to for review. So, I thinkfear of ridicule is the big thing. We (four) want to help science overcome that so thesubject can be discussed seriously in the scientific literature.SO, WHAT HAPPENED? WHERE DID YOU GET PUBLISHED AND HOW DID THATOCCUR?Yeah, well, Hal Puthoff, one of the co-authors, has been publishing quite a few of histheoretical papers in physics in the last few years in this journal called the Journal of theBritish Interplanetary Society, JBIS. So, he suggested we try that journal next. So we did. Ionce published an article in it myself and knew they were more open-minded than some ofthe other journals. It has a small readership- it's the more narrow topic for people who areinterested in space travel and what's the best way to do it. So, we gave that a try and wewere fortunate that we had a responsible and rather open-minded editor at the journal whoin fact encouraged us a bit to delve more into the Condon Report that came out around1968 to 1969, which was sort of considered the last word by the scientific establishmenton the UFO phenomenon. So, we went over that again. As you and many people know,that report did not reflect the true status of what even the scientists on that committeefound.Seems like Edward Condon, under the influence of one of his associates there, had"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"decided, had his mind pretty well made up in advance, that they were not going to comeout with anything seriously truthful about the UFO phenomenon. They did not want toreceive ridicule by the scientific community. So, Condon wrote the summary of this greatbig, long report. It was a 6 or 8 page summary at the very front of the book. That's themain thing that the reporters read and they did not bother to read further into the reportand study all the cases that the Condon Committee had considered. And the reporters didnot learn that about one-third of the cases were cases that could not be dismissed as anyknown objects. That never came out in the report.WHICH MEANT THAT FOR THE PUBLIC AND WHAT THE U.S. AIR FORCE WASTHAT THE CONDON REPORT, THE BLUE BOOK REPORT, WAS CLOSED AT THEEND OF THE 1960S BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING TO THE UFOPHENOMENON THAT ALL OF THAT WAS BASICALLY NOT TRUE BECAUSEEVEN THE CONDON REPORT WAS NOT HONEST.Yeah. Actually he was somewhat in his summary. He was somewhat cautious. I think themain thing he said against it was that there was nothing that science could learn fromstudying UFO reports. That does not really say they are not real. It's a very strange attitudeto have for a phenomenon that everyone who has had UFO sightings can see that theseunknown vehicles that have been spotted in the skies every so often since World War IIcan perform maneuvers that science can't explain. So, we would hope that science couldlearn something from it. Inferring An ET Strategy About Planet EarthEarth from space, courtesy NASA.IN YOUR PAPER, IN SECTION 6., IT SAYS 'INFERRING AN ET STRATEGY.' COULDYOU EXPLAIN THAT MORE?There have been quite a few papers in the past, scientific papers, inferring an ET strategyof 'Why don't we see them around?' in trying to explain Fermi's Paradox. So, we kind ofbuilt on that. In science you have to really if you propose anything new, you have to firstsay, 'What's wrong with the accepted conclusions of the past? Then you go on to give yournew proposals or theories.There had been proposals that the solar system and Earth were a wildlife preserve or zoofor extraterrestrials to keep any bad ETs away from Earth so we can just evolve on ourown. There have been other proposals in the scientific literature that ETs could be having ahands off attitude toward Earth because humans are not prepared for them. There is alsothe laboratory hypothesis that we're sort of a laboratory for ETs to observe us covertlywithout us knowing about it and they can see how we develop without having openinterference by the ETs themselves. And there is the embargo theory that the ETs havehands off because it would be just too traumatic if the ETs were to suddenly have opencontact with us. Governments would topple and the stock market would collapse.So, earlier in a paper I mentioned how many of these theories lack one thing: if the ETshad a total hands off attitude towards Earth, then some day we would nevertheless run intothem. Then the culture shock would be just as great as it would have been thirty years ago,so that you would still have governments collapsing and civilization might come to a halt.So, I proposed that there was a leak in the embargo against Earth and this leak takesvarious forms. But in this JBIS paper, I didn't talk about the UFO phenomenon itself beinga 'leak in the embargo' because if I used the word 'UFO' I felt the paper would have beenrejected, which probably would have been the case.So, we go on here to say how it looks like they are remaining covert for the reason of notshocking society into any abrupt knowledge of their presence, but presenting themselves toselected witnesses here and there over a very long time scale, ever since World War II.AND THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE FERMI PARADOX QUESTION - IF THEUNIVERSE WAS FILLED WITH LIFE, WHY AREN'T THEY HERE?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Yes, exactly. There is no excuse for other scientists wondering why ETs aren't here not toinclude the UFO phenomenon in their analysis. We just can't anticipate how much theevolved science of an extraterrestrial civilization that is 10,000 years ahead of us, or 10million years ahead of us, or even a billion years ahead of us what could that mean interms of what they could do? All we know is what Carl Sagan once wrote in a paper withWilliam Newman: What ETs should be able to do should be indistinguishable from magicfor us.He was parroting Arthur C. Clark, the science fiction writer, in saying that. I think almostall scientists would agree on that. But when it comes to any particular UFO case where, forexample, we see a UFO maneuvering some way and can't understand how it could be, thenwe tend to forget about what an advanced civilization could really do. We say in anyparticular case we can't invoke that possibility because you just have to know howsomething is done or science is unable to accept that it could be done. Feedback from Scientists About JBIS ArticleWHAT KIND OF FEEDBACK HAVE YOU GOTTEN ON THIS PAPER FROMSCIENTISTS?Mainly it's been brief words of congratulations to have gotten this into the mainstreamscience literature.BUT WOULD SCIENTISTS BE CONGRATULATING THE FOUR OF YOU BECAUSETHEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE DISCUSSION, BUT THEY ARE AFRAID TOBRING IT UP THEMSELVES?Well, yes, because they would like to see more discussion in the open literature, much,much more. But they weren't really afraid themselves. They just knew it was impossible!The curtain of ridicule that grew up around the UFO phenomenon - as far back as the early1950s, there was the Robertson Panel in 1953, a US Air Force panel that helped get thisstarted by saying, 'Well, let's make the UFO witnesses appear ridiculous and eventuallythat would have the effect of deterring people from reporting their UFO sightings.' Open ET Contact With Earth This Century?IF YOU WERE MAKING AN EDUCATED GUESS, DO YOU THINK WE WILL HAVESOME KIND OF CONTACT FROM ANOTHER INTELLIGENCE IN THE UNIVERSEIN THIS CENTURY?Oh, yes. I think it will be within the next 20 years. Probably won't have to wait the wholecentury. But I don't really know under what circumstances it might occur.WHY DO YOU SAY THE NEXT 20 YEARS?Well, we can see conditions going downhill so fast in the environment and in internationalpolitics, things like that. It could be that if things really did keep going down the way theyare, we could end up in a World War III. In addition, we could end up with great problemsin the environment with pollution being too great , as you have discussed in so many ofyour Earthfiles and radio reports. The ETs then could feel that it would be time to step inand we would be undergoing so much trauma anyhow that their appearance would notmake matters worse. I just don't see that time scale as long as a whole century now.\"More Information:Geoffrey A. Landis, Ohio Aerospace Institute, NASA Lewis Research Center,Cleveland, Ohio, wrote about the Fermi Paradox this way: \"If even a very small fraction ofthe hundred billion stars in the galaxy are home to technological civilizations whichcolonize over interstellar distances, the entire galaxy could be completely colonized in afew million years. The absence of such extraterrestrial civilizations visiting Earth is theFermi Paradox.\"Proposed solutions to the Fermi paradox either deny the possibility of extraterrestrialcivilizations, an assumption as yet unwarranted, or accept the possibility of extraterrestrialtechnological civilizations and propose explanations for why such civilizations maynevertheless not have colonized the galaxy. Explanations include suggestions that suchcivilizations collapse or blow themselves up, run out of resources, choose not to colonize,"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"or chose to colonize but leave us alone. The difficulty with all such explanations is thatthey must all assume an unwarranted uniformity of motive for extraterrestrial civilizationsover extremely long periods of time. If even a single civilization chose to colonize thegalaxy, the explanations fail. It is useful, therefore, to try to look for explanations of theFermi paradox which do not rely on uniformity of motive.\"Jim Deardorff's comment: \"Dr. Landis assumes that nothing like a consortium ofadvanced civilizations with reasonably good ethics would be able to prevent a single othercivilization from exploiting us over a several thousand-year period, or from having donethe same earlier within the galaxy. But a key element of any civilization is that an ethical,law-abiding majority is able to police a criminal minority and keep them under control -but perhaps never eliminate them.\"Websites:The JBIS Article: http://www.ufoskeptic.org/The Fermi Paradox: http://www.sff.net/people/Geoffrey.Landis/percolation.htpWorm Hole Travel: http://www.zamandayolculuk.com/cetinbal/NEGATIVEENERGYWORMHOLESWARP.HTMAlcubierre Warp Drive: http://members.tripod.com/da_theoretical1/wdtheory.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
