December 7, 2005 Thirty-one years ago the December 1974 issue of Astronomymagazine featured a 15-page article entitled, \"The Zeta Reticuli Incident\" by astronomerand author, Terence Dickinson. His article began: \"A faint pair of stars, 220 trillion miles away, has been tentatively identified as the'home base' of intelligent extraterrestrials who allegedly visited Earth in 1961. Thishypothesis is based on a strange, almost bizarre series of events mixing astronomicalresearch with hypnosis, amnesia, and alien humanoid creatures. \"The two stars are known as Zeta 1 and Zeta 2 Reticuli, or together, as simply ZetaReticuli. They are each fifth magnitude stars - barely visible to the unaided eye-located in the obscure southern constellation Reticulum. this southerly sky locationmakes Zeta Reticuli invisible to observers north of Mexico City's latitude.\" The hypnosis, amnesia and alien humanoid creatures that Mr. Dickinson referred to arefrom the Betty and Barney Hill abduction case in the White Mountains of New Hampshireon their way home to Portsmouth on September 19, 1961. The events and effort to unlockmissing time with psychiatrist, Benjamin Simon, M. D., were detailed in the book, TheInterrupted Journey © 1966 by John G.

Image from Betty Hill. Historically, Betty and Barney Hill were the first documented case in what has come to beknown as the \"human abduction syndrome\" in which non-human entities take humansfrom bedrooms, cars, yards, parks and other human environments into round rooms aboardwhat the human abductees assume are craft from outer space controlled by the non-humanentities. During these events, human subjects often describe medical examinations,extractions of sperm or ova, mind downloads to and from the aliens, and sometimeslearning sessions in front of 3-dimensional screens, holographic spaces or wall maps. In theBetty and Barney Hill experience, Betty described the alien \"leader\" showing her a starmap of his home solar system in the Zeta Reticuli I and II binary star system 37.5 lightyears from Earth. Our Sun was also shown on the aliens' star map and connected by linesto Zeta Reticuli I and II apparently to indicate a one-way trade route."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Above: Wide view of Zeta Reticuli I and II binary star system 39.41 light years from Earth.Zeta Reticuli 1 is a G 3/5 V Spectral Type sun and Zeta Reticuli 2 is a G2 V Spectral Type.Below: Close-up of the binary stars.

Betty Hill Describes Zeta ReticulanNon-Humans and Their Star Map Betty Hill, The Interrupted Journey © 1966, from dream memory: \"...I would judgethem to be 5' to 5'4\". Their chests are larger than ours; their noses were larger (longer) thanthe average size, although I have seen people with noses like theirs - like Jimmy Durante.Their complexions were of a gray tone; like a gray paint with a black base; their lips wereof a bluish tint. Hair and eyes were very dark, possibly black.The men were all dressed alike, presumably in uniform, of a light navy blue color with agray shade in it. They wore trousers and short jackets, that gave the appearance ofzippered sports jackets, but I am not aware of zippers or buttons or closing. Shoes were alow, slip-on style, resembling a boot. I cannot remember any jewelry, or insignia. Theywere all wearing military caps, similar to Air Force, but not so broad on the top.Betty Hill's Star Map Description under hypnosis with Dr. Benjamin Simon:"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"\"...I asked him where he was from. Because I said that I knew he wasn't from theearth, and I wanted to know where he did come from. And he asked if I knewanything about the universe. And I told him no. I knew practically nothing. Thatwhen I was in graduate school, we were taught that the sun was the center of thesolar system, and there were nine planets. And then later, of course, we did makeadvances. And I told him about seeing, I think I met him at one time. HarlowShapley; he wrote a book, too.\"[ Editor's Note: Harlow Shapley, astronomer, November 2, 1885 - October 20,1972. Shapley was offered directorship of the Harvard College Observatory whichwas to remain his academic home for the next 75 years.Perhaps the greatest - and certainly the most fruitful - of Shapley's innovations wasthe establishment of the graduate school of astronomy as a part of the educationalstructure of Harvard University. His telescopes at Harvard possessed smallerapertures, but wider angular fields than Mt. Wilson in California, in which he alsoworked. It was with these that Shapley and his collaborators continued to explorethe Magellanic clouds, to probe the spatial distribution of external galaxies; and in1938 discovered new dwarf galaxies in Sculptor and Fornax and the center of ourgalaxy. ]Betty Hill: \"And I had seen photographs that he had taken of millions andmillions of stars in the universe. But that was about all I knew. So, he said thathe wished I knew more about this, and I said I wish I did, too. And he wentacross the room to the head of the table and he did something, he opened up,it wasn't like a drawer, he sort of did something, and in the metal of the wall,there was an opening. And he pulled out a map, and he asked me had I everseen a map like this before? And I walked across the room and I leanedagainst the table. And I looked at it. And it was a map - it was an oblong map.It wasn't square. It was a lot wider than it was long. And there were all thesedots on it. And they were scattered all over it. Some were little, just pin points.And others were as big as a nickel. And there were lines. There were on someof the dots, there were curved lines going from one dot to another. And therewas one big circle, and it had a lot of lines coming out from it. A lot of linesgoing to another circle quite close, but not as big. And these were heavy lines.And I asked him what they meant. And he said that the heavy lines were traderoutes. And then the other lines, the solid lines were places they wentoccasionally. And he said the broken lines were expeditions ...\"So I asked him where was his home port? He said, 'Where are you on themap?' I looked and laughed and said, 'I don't know.' So he said, 'If you don'tknow where you are, then there isn't any point of my telling where I amfrom.'\"Under hypnosis, Betty Hill described the star map she was shown \"by the leader aboard the ship.\"Later, she sketched it above. She said she was told that the heavy lines marked regular trade routes,and the broken lines recorded various space expeditions. Our own Sun was later identifiedby amateur astronomer, Marjorie Fish, to be the upper right dot connected by two lines toZeta Reticuli I and II. Map from The interrupted Journey © 1966 by John G. Fuller.Marjorie Fish, Amateur Astronomer,Makes 3-D Star MapAfter John Fuller's book was published containing the star map drawing by Betty Hill,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Marjorie E. Fish (Ohio schoolteacher, amateur astronomer and Mensa member) wonderedif the objects in Betty's star map might represent some actual pattern of galactic objects.Marjorie visited Betty Hill in the summer of 1969 after Barney Hill had died earlier thatyear. Terence Dickinson quoted Marjorie Fish's description of that meeting in hisDecember 1974 Astronomy article\"On Aug. 4, 1969, Betty Hill discussed the star map with me. Betty explainedthat she drew the map in 1964 under posthypnotic suggestion. It was to bedrawn only if she could remember it accurately, and she was not to payattention to what she was drawing - which puts it in the realm of automaticdrawing. This is a way of getting at repressed or forgotten material and canresult in unusual accuracy. She made two erasures showing her consciousmind took control part of the time\"Betty described the (star) map as three-dimensional, like looking through awindow. The stars were tinted and glowed. The map material was flat and thin(not a model), and there were no noticeable lenticular lines like one of our(human) three-dimensional processes. It sounds very much like a reflectivehologram. Betty did not shift her position while viewing it, so we cannot tell ifit would give the same three-dimensional view from all positions or if it wouldbe completely three-dimensional. Betty estimated the map was approximatelythree feet wide and two feet high with the pattern covering most of the map.She was standing about three feet away from it. She said there were manyother stars on the map, but she only (apparently) was able to specificallyrecall the prominent ones connected by lines and a small distinctive triangleoff to the left. There was no concentration of stars to indicate the Milky Way(galactic plane) suggesting that if it represented reality, it probably onlycontained local stars. There were no grid lines.\"Beads on thin strings in model prepared by Marjorie Fish so that each star is suspendedon a separate thread at its appropriate distance and position from our Sun. Colors denotespectral type. Our Sun, far right, is a yellow G2. Zeta Reticuli I and II, also G type stars, are bottomcenter. Marjorie Fish found 16 stars whose positions were close to those in Betty Hill's drawing. Oneof the discoveries provoked by Betty Hill's 1964 star map is that all the starsin Betty's map are G-type yellow suns similar to our own Sun.
