Here begins Part 3of Status Report III, written in June 1982. The series of status reports, I through VII, werewritten by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report IV begins atEarthfiles 021205. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994.\"Fred Schaefer's report on KA's aftermath: Since 1954, when this incident allegedly occurred, KA has been having intermittentnightmares about his experience in the desert. During the year 1981, thesenightmares have grown in intensity and frequency, causing KA much anguish.During the lecture at Edmund Scientific Company in March, KA saw his opportunityto reveal details of his UFO retrieval experience to someone who would lend anunderstanding ear; thereby helping to alleviate his mental torment. Leonard Stringfield: During a long chat on December 10, 1981, KA told me withvocal sincerity, 'I was taught to tell the truth,' as he related details of his experience,some confirming what the Schaefer report related, and others new to me. I felt thatKA was telling it as it was. Describing the crash scene, he said: 'I thought I was in aset in Hollywood.' But fantasy was soon dashed, he said, because of the terriblestench in the crash area and watching one of his buddy's regurgitate. The stench, hesaid, was like battery acid and ammonia. Other details follow:1) While KA's chopper was still at the crash site, a second chopper landed. Atleast four men got out wearing white pants and long white coats. KA tried totake a picture of one o the new arrivals, but was told angrily, 'Don't take apicture of me. Just take what you were told to take.' The second chopperlanded much closer than KA's, scattering sand from its prop-wash. 2) While KA was taking pictures of the saucer on the ground, he saw a silveror aluminum-colored metallic box on the ground about 3 feet long and 1 1/2feet high with numbers printed on it. There were also words printed on thebox which were indistinguishable. He tried to take pictures of the box, but wasstopped by a member of the ground crew and told, 'Get the hell away fromthat.' (Comment by Len Stringfield: Probably a detector device.) 3) All members of the ground crew wore green fatigues with no insignia orrank identity. 4) There were four or five large dogs on leashes by the trucks. 5) The pilot of the chopper also vomited. He was pale like a ghost for severaldays. 6) I asked how many rolls of film he took. KA's answer: Four canisters, twolarge; a total of 36 exposures. The camera was turret-mounted and looked likean accordion. ULTRA-F-5 was the filter used, not the camera. He wasinstructed to take pictures from all angles on and above the ground. However,he was told to take more pictures from the ground. He was also told to use allthe film. These instructions came over the intercom. He was also instructed toleave the film on the chopper when they landed. The officer in charge stayed"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"onboard after they landed. 7) KA would not disclose the names of the fellow members of Rescue Team 4.Following our talks in December, KA told me with concern that he had beenreminded by phone, and more surprisingly, by a stranger he encountered in hisneighborhood drugstore, that he should not talk about his part of the retrievaloperation. Again, he was called and warned of consequences following aphone call I made in January 1982. COMMENT: KA's torment over his long-ago experience is obvious and so is his fearof reprisal, which is shared by his wife. Although vague on certain issues such as hishospitalization after the incident, I believe that his reticence (or blackout) might be aresult of experimental drugs or other methods known to have been used by militaryIntelligence in the post World War II years to confuse the mind or to program it toforget. KA does admit, backed by his wife's testimony, that he experiences recurringnightmares recalling phases of the incident and of people involved. CASE A-3: Mail irregularities in my special research have a high incidence rate. Not so withroutine UFO matters or the monthly bills. The foregoing case, one of possible greatsignificance if true, is exemplary of mysterious postal handling. Because of theobvious non-delivery of follow-up letters to and from the principal involved, thecase remains incomplete. The story begins with a letter that had military masthead and was dated September16, 1980, from a Sergeant JM, APO San Francisco. The Sergeant's letter, amongother letters on the UFO subject, was probably in response to an Armed Forces radiore-broadcast of my interview on UFO crashes with the popular Charlie Tuna Show,KATZ, Los Angeles. The Sergeant's disclosure on official stationery follows: Sergeant JM, September 16, 1980: 'Department of the Air Force...Security Police Sq. (PACAF)APO San Francisco, California 96239Reply to: (Name and home address withheld on request)Subject: Response to Request of Information in Relation to UFO contact andother Related InformationTo: Len Stringfield 1) In January of 1978, I was stationed at McGuire AFB, N. J. One evening,during the time frame of 0300 hrs. and 0500 hrs., there were a number of UFOsightings in the area over the air field and Ft. Dix Army Camp. I am a securitypoliceman and was on routine patrol at the time. N. J. State Police and Ft. DixMPs were running code in the direction of Brownsville, N. J. A state trooperthen entered Gate # 5 at the rear of the base requesting assistance andpermission to enter. I was dispatched and the trooper wanted access to therunway area which led to the very back of the air field and connected with aheavily wooded area which is part of the Dix training area. He informed methat a Ft. Dix MP was pursuing a low flying object which then hovered overhis car. The N. J. state trooper described aerial object as oval-shaped, with nodetails, and glowing with a bluish-green color. His radio transmission was cutoff. At that time in front of his police car appeared a thing, about 4 feet tall,greyish-brown, fat head, long arms and slender body. The MP panicked andfired five rounds from his .45 cal. into the thing and one round into the objectabove. The object then fled straight up and joined with eleven others high inthe sky. This we all saw, but did not know the details at the time. Anyway, thething ran into the woods towards our fence line and they wanted to look for it.By this time, several patrols were involved. 2) We found the body of the thing near the runway. It had apparently climbedthe fence and died while running. It was all of a sudden hush-hush and no onewas allowed near the area. We roped off the area and AFOSI came out andtook over. That was the last I saw of it. There was a bad stench coming fromit, too. Like ammonia smelling, but was not constant in the air. That day, ateam from Wright-Patterson AFB came in a C 141 and went to the area. Theycrated it in a wooden box, sprayed something over it, and then put it into abigger metal container. They loaded it in the plane and took off. That was it,nothing more said; no report made and we were all told not to have anythingto say about it or we would be court martialled."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 3) I will be getting out of the Air Force in about two months. Do not disclosemy name as I could get into trouble. I am interested in pursuing this and othermatters if you need help. Forgive me for not signing this, but I can't take anychances. Please reply to the above address and my parents will forward it tome or I will be home already. Don't send it here because they monitor all mailclosely and I again don't want to take any chances.' Len Stringfield: Upon receipt of the above letter, I answered on September 27,1980, with a long letter to his home address with many questions and enclosed acopy of Status Report II. [To be reprinted in future Earthfiles.] I received no reply. On November 18, 1990, I sent a follow-up letter asking about the delivery of myearlier letter and offering to meet him in person. To this I received a reply datedNovember 27, 1980, in which he said he did not receive my previous letter. Said JM,'I don't know why. I am now out of the service and am home. I am prepared toanswer your questions. ...The desk sergeant that night was Sgt. 'C' (name on file),and he would know much more. ...I would like your next response ASAP and I willtry to give you my phone number by then.' I wrote to JM again dated December 4, 1980, and enclosed a xeroxed copy of thefirst long letter with questions. He did not respond. I sent another letter dated February 16, 1981, expressing my concern and gaveassurances of anonymity. He never responded. I tried to make connections via thetelephone, but to no avail. He disappeared into thin air and with him a case assinister as the Lumberton affair cited in Status Report II (See Case B-13), and in thePostscript of this paper. One more follow-up was made by researcher and confidant,Richard Hall of MUFON, who sent a certified letter to JM dated April 10, 1982.Although it was received and signed by JM on April 12, 1982, thee has been noresponse. CASE A-4: V. A. 'Posty' Postlethwait of Phoenix, Arizona, formerly served as Captain in the82nd Airborne and was on detached service, G-2 (Intelligence) V-Corps, Pope AFBin the Ft. Bragg complex in North Carolina. Posty was referred to me by Bill Jenkinsof KABC Los Angeles radio, April 1980, when I was a guest on his 'Open Mind'show. Reaching Posty I found his credentials good and so was the information he sharedconcerning a UFO crash at White Sands Proving Grounds in 1948. As a Captain inG-2 Air, he was cleared to see a TOP SECRET message coming in by TWX fromthe 3rd Army Headquarters, Atlanta, Georgia. Directed to the Commanding General(with copy to G-2), the message described the crash of an alien saucer-shaped craft100 feet in diameter, 30 feet high, with one portal window blown which causedsuffocation to the five occupants. Among other items cited, as Posty recalled, thebodies had turned blue and were about 4 feet tall with oversized heads by humanstandards and that the metallic skin of the craft was as thin as a newspaper, but tootough to penetrate by conventional tools. He also recalled hearing that privateproperty was purchased to facilitate transporting the craft to the base. Posty said the full story, beyond what he had heard at the base, was published in anarticle appearing in a 1948 issue of Coronet magazine. When the issue was released,he heard that authorities had confiscated all copies at the Coronet office and mostthat reached the newsstands. A few survived, a copy of which he had seen yearsago. COMMENT: Needed is a copy of Coronet, month unknown, 1948. Significant isPostlethwait granting me permission to use his name in this report. CASE A-5: RT married, was a former Marine, rank PFC, assigned to Canine Corps at CampPendleton, San Diego, California, with Alpha Red TS Crypto Clearance. Served 6years in Vietnam. Resident of Las Vegas, Nevada. In this first person report, RT alleges he was at a UFO retrieval site, 1967. FollowingRT's disclosures to me in July 1980, supported by data from APRO (AerialPhenomenon Research Organization) records of his phone calls to that office, is a"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"weird unfolding drama of harassment and violence, a strange visit, and the grimconsequences which allegedly befell one of its on-the-spot investigators, RC, also ofLas Vegas. Through RC, my intermediary - who was formerly a U. S. Narcotics agent - Ireached RT by phone. According to RT's testimony, he was given 45 minutes noticebefore departure by plane from Camp Pendleton to a retrieval site 'somewhere in thedesert' on July 3, 1967. As a trainer in the Canine Corps at his base, he and his dogs and other marines as ateam were flown in a light cargo transport for 2.5 hours to the site, landing on amakeshift strip carved out by a road grader. The windows of the transport wereblacked out, he said. At the site, among the cactus and tumbleweed, were tents, asmall quonset hut and what appeared to be a small pre-fab hangar. Busy were menin military fatigues without insignia. Told nothing about the status of the operation,he was assigned to a post for guard duty, given orders, and told to use only onedesignated path to the mess tent and latrine. Curious, said RT, he decided on his fourth day to see what was so hush-hush andtook a different route to the mess tent near the hangar. When the guard had his backturned, he peeked inside the hangar and to his shock, he saw a metallic disc, orsaucer, about 30 feet in diameter. On top was a dome. There were no windows.Around the craft were men at work and tables on which were technical instruments.He also saw a large walk-in refrigerator unit on skids and several empty body bags.'If there were bodies,' he said, 'they had already been shipped out or maybe theywere in the freezer.' RT's one good glimpse into the hangar was also his undoing. The guard nearbynabbed him and he was escorted to the headquarter's tent where he faced the officerin command, Colonel 'P' (name on file), U.S.A.F. Medical Corps. Reminded of hisSecurity Oath, he was confined to quarters and sent back to Pendleton forpunishment. Thirteen years later, RT decided to tell his story. He admitted to seeing the movie,'Hangar 18,' knew it was fiction but said its emotional impact on him conjured up inhis mind the hangar in the desert which he knew was not fiction. He first told hisstory to Wendelle Stevens and RC in Las Vegas and called APRO. Then, like the dayhe went down the wrong path at the retrieval site, he got into a new hornet's nest oftrouble. According to APRO records, RT called in to their office to report each incident ofharassment staring July 14, 1980. On July 14, RT claimed he was visited by anIntelligence agent who reminded him of his Security Oath. On July 21, 1980, RTclaimed that his apartment was pillaged, maps and all UFO memorabilia taken.Called police. On July 22, 1980, visitor came to apartment with threats. RT excusedhimself to bedroom, got a 45 cal. gun, forced the intruder to show ID at gun point,and performed a 'citizen's arrest.' He called police, the intruder was 'booked.' Also,there was a man waiting in the limousine outside. the police checked the intruders'credentials and released them. On July 28, 1980, RT called to relate that he wasvisited by a person dressed in black who offered to exchange UFO information. Thiswas the last call made by RT to APRO, according to available records. During the period of RT's contact with APRO, I was receiving similar information byphone from my intermediary, RC. Needless to say, I had difficulty in digesting theadventures of his source. Then , on August 11, 1980, it was arranged for me to reachRT to discuss firsthand the events of the past month. Hearing it from RT, the storyseemed less fanciful or less contrived. When I asked about the intruders' ID, he said,'C. I. A.' The story told by RT about his visitor, a man dressed in black, might have beenpenned by Poe. During the stranger's 45 minute unannounced visit, RT's dog, ashepherd, behaved uneasily. Once, said RT, he asked for a glass of water, but whenhe was approached, he uttered, 'Don't touch me.' RT also noted that during theirconversations about UFOs, the visitor always spoke in the third person, using 'we' or'they.' According to RT, the visitor - while describing a UFO incident - suddenly producedfrom his briefcase a half dozen color photographs. 'Each showed a small cadaver orparts, not human, in what appeared to be a hospital operating room,' he said. 'Iwould judge they were just about four feet tall if scaled with the tables they wereon.'"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"One photo, said RT, was a close-up of a hand with four fingers, long and slim, withno opposable thumb. 'Another,' he said, 'showed the top of a humanoid head, theflesh cut open and drilled into.' Still another showed the upper torso of chalky complexion with an incision into itschest, he said. And another showed a body burned in its suit. 'But there was onephoto that really convinced me,' said RT with emphasis. 'It showed three doctors inthe process of dissecting a body on top of a slab with a gutter around the edge. 'See any blood?' I asked. 'If their blood is red, there wasn't any,' he replied, or words to that effect. 'The photos looked real to me,' he said, when I asked for his opinion of them. I called RT the following day, August 12, 1980, on a tip from RC who learned thatRT and his wife might move from their apartment in the next day or two. He seemedrestrained, his words hesitant, but he tried to be courteous. 'Maybe I should not be talking on this subject anymore,' he said. He then went on toexplain that he was having a 'social security number problem' and that it was causinga delay in money to pay the rent. That was the last word from RT, although he promised to send me his new address. Ihave since heard from Wendelle Stevens who heard that RT was working for theAtomic Energy Commission (AEC), had all of his debts paid, and was not talking toanybody about UFOs anymore. But this anecdote does not end with RT. Events just as strange allegedly happenedto RC, my intermediary who seemed ready and willing and unafraid to movemountains in his probes to get facts for me.\"Continued in Part 4 - Shocking news from RC and more crash/retrieval cases.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
