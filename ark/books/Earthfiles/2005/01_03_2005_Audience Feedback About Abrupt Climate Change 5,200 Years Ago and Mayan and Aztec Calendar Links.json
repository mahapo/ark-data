Just as the world was created, destroyed and recreated time andagain, so smaller units of time repeated themselves. ...If life was impermanent forthe Aztec, so, in the last analysis, was death. Life contained the inevitability ofdeath, but death held within it the certainty of rebirth. For the Aztec, as for othernative American peoples, death meant passage from earthly life to anotherexistence on a different plane in a multi-level universe. For some, it also meanteven the possibility of return to earth, though in a different form.\" - Mysteries of theAncient Americas Phase 2 of Silbury Hill, Wiltshire, England, design in wheat field on August 3, 2004.Aerial photograph © 2004 by Roiland Beljon. Click back to 12-31-04Earthfiles, climate change report. January 3, 2005 Albuquerque, New Mexico - 1) R.C.Australia \"Concerning rapid climate change just reported at the American Geophysical Unionmeeting, carbon-dated worldwide to precisely *5200 years ago,* did you sayanything to Professor Lonnie Thompson about the Mayan-Aztec crop picture ofAugust 2004? [Editor's Note: See Silbury Hill photograph above and 08-04-04Earthfiles; 06-11-00 Earthfiles] Four outer shaded-divisions signify precisely *5200 years of 360 days each* (not365 which would give 5130 years). But carbon-dating is often in error by 100 yearsover such a long interval.See: http://www.earthfiles.com/news/news.cfm?ID=839&category=Science Then there are 10 outside intervals of 520 years each; and 10 inside intervals of 52years each (a Mayan 'century'); and finally six small lines to show 52/6 = 8.67 yearsuntil the Fourth Sun will end. The most anomalous coding was '12.19.19' for the inside dial; but now we realizethey were trying to draw a parallel, between the December 2004 quake and whatwill happen in December 2012. Given Thompson's new evidence, the 2012 event is certainly 'on'--even if we don'tunderstand the astrophysics. Probably the most important story ever. Whether theSun's energy changed (5200 years ago), or whether land masses 'slipped' to differentlocations, remains uncertain.\" 2) Bill HamiltonLancaster, California"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" \"I am sure you noticed that the duration of 5,200 years is equal to13 Mayan Baktuns. This 13th Baktun ends on Dec. 21,2012. The Ox Lahji Baktun calendar spans 5200 years and it will end on December21, 2012, of the Gregorian calendar. We are in the fourth part of these twocycles that began in 3114 BC. When we put together these two calendars, itgives us one period of great destruction for all humanity. Is it coincidence that Lonnie Thompson has found evidence of abrupt climatechange 5,200 years ago or did the Mayans encode a warning of solar cyclesin their calendar?\" 3) P. C. \"I just read your recent article stating 'Abruptclimate change occurred worldwide 5200 years ago.' Hasanybody been making any connections between thisarticle and the 'Mayan Factor' of Jose Arguelleswherein he discusses at great length the '5200-tunsynchronization beam' cycles?...the 52galactic-activation katuns?....of which we are nearinga pivotal year in 2012?\" [Editor's Note: The following comments are from 13moon.com:] \"As avid stargazers, the ancient Maya were keen to an astrological cycle wecall the Precession of the Equinoxes. This is close to a 26,000 year cycle inwhich Earth transits through each of the 12 signs of the zodiac for about 2,152years each. Each of these astrological ages represents one month of the grand,Cosmic Year. Sumerians, Tibetans, Egyptians, Cherokees, Hopi, and Mayansrefer to this same 26,000 year cycle in their mystical belief systems and eachhave developed calendars based on this great cycle. \"The ancient Maya understood this 26,000 year cycle to be specificallycomposed of 5 lesser cycles, each 5,125 years each. Each of these 5 cycleswas considered its own World Age or Creation Cycle. As depicted on thefamiliar, circular MesoAmerican Sun Stone, (often called the Aztec Calendar)each Creation Cycle is said to have been ruled and destroyed by one of 5elements. Specifically, 4 Jaguar, 4 Wind, 4 Rain, 4 Water. Aztec Calendar Based On Mayan CalendarInspired by the ancient Mayan calendar, the popular Aztec Calendar consisted of a ritual cycle that wasdividedinto 13 periods of 20 days each and a civil cycle that was divided into 18 months of 20 days each, plusthe 5 \"unlucky\"days called 'nemontemi'. The original stone measures 12 feet in diameter and weighs over 25 tons. Itwas discovered in whatis now Mexico City in 1790 and is currently on display in the national Museum of Anthropology inMexico City."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The face of the sun god Tonatiuh appears at the center, surrounded by four square panels honoringpreviousincarnations of the deity that represent the four previous ages of the world. \"Our present great cycle (3113 B.C. - 2012 A.D.) is called the Age of theFifth Sun. This time period is ruled by 4 Earth. This fifth age is the synthesisof the previous four. 4 Earth (called Caban in the Maya language and Ollin inAztec) has several meanings, including: movement, shift, evolution,earthquake, navigation, synchronicity, clue tracking, turtle. In the Mayalanguage, the word 'ol' of ollin means consciousness. In Mayan calendrics, the initial date that Earth entered the Fifth World wasAugust 13, 3113 BC, written in Mayan long count notation as 13.0.0.0.0.Every day from that point was reckoned by the number of days passed sincethe event of this cosmic beginning point. \"As Dr. Jose Arguelles writes in Time and The Technosphere: 'August 13,3113 BC is as precise and accurate as one can get for a beginning of history:the first Egyptian dynasty is dated to ca 3100 BC; the first 'city,' Uruk, inMesopotamia, also ca 3100 BC; the Hindu Kali Yuga, 3102 BC; and mostinterestingly, the division of time into 24 hours of 60 minutes each and eachminute into 60 seconds [and the division of the circle into 360 degrees], alsoaround 3100 BC, in Sumeria. If the beginning of history was so accuratelyplaced, then must not the end of history, December 21, 2012 also be asaccurate?' \"(Sidenote: Regarding the World Age cycle we are closing in 2012 and thenew World Age cycle to dawn, there are varying cosmologies as to whetherwe are closing the Fifth World and entering the Sixth, or closing the FourthWorld and entering the Fifth. For example, In the perspective of the livingMaya Timekeepers of Guatemala, calendrically speaking, each element has a5,125 year cycle. They teach that we have been through fire, earth, air andwater already. The next cycle (beginning Dec 21, 2012) will be ether - theFifth Age - the Age of Center. Likewise, the Hopi teach we are closing theFourth World of Destruction, and preparing to begin the Fifth World of Peace.Regardless of the title given, what is clear is that we are on poised on thebrink of a World Age Rebirth!) \"Within the 5,125 year cycle lies 13 smaller cycles, known as the '13Baktun Count,' or the 'long count.' Each baktun cycle is 394 years long, or144,000 days. Each baktun was its own historical epoch or Age within theGreat Creation Cycle, carrying a specific destiny for the evolution of thosewho incarnated in each baktun. For example, almost all of the Mayaninscriptions were seeded precisely during Baktun 9 (435-830 AD). This era isknown as the time of the Classic Maya. After this point, around 830 A.D., thegreat Mayan centers were abandoned and their thriving culture mysteriouslydisappeared. To this day, no one can verify or prove why they left or wherethey went. \"The Classic Maya of Baktun 9 were of a specific destiny, distinct fromMaya of other times. As Dr. Jose Arguelles writes, 'In 830 A.D. theengineering team departed back to space, back to the other dimensions fromwhich the Maya keep their watch on things. Slowly the terrestrial Mayamelted back into the jungles. The time of darkness was setting in. Sure enoughthe conquerors came. By 830 A.D. Warrior tribes who took the ancient nameof Toltec, which means Master Builder, entered the Yucatan. War and humansacrifice were introduced.' \"Earth and her inhabitants are currently traveling through the 13thbaktun cycle - the final period of 1618-2012 AD. This cycle is known bothas 'the triumph of materialism' and 'the transformation of matter.' The Mayapredicted this final baktun would be a time of great forgetting in which wedrift very far from our sense of Oneness with Nature and experience a kind ofcollective amnesia. Like a memory virus in which we begin to believe thelimited reality of appearances and grow dense to the spiritual essence whichfuels this world, so humanity's sense of ego and domination has grown. \"We entered this baktun cycle right after establishing the world widecoordination of Pope Gregory XIII's 12 month calendar system (1582) aswell as the perfection of 12 hour 60-minute mechanical clock (1600), whichhad been evolving for centuries. These are no small matters.
