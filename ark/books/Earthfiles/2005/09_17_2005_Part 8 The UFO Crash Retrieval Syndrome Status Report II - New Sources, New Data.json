S. Senator Barry Goldwater (R-Arizona) Return to previous Part 7To be more computer-friendly, the reprint has been divided into parts. Here begins Part 8of Status Report II, written in January 1980. The series of status reports, I through VII,were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report IIIbegins at Earthfiles. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. For all theprevious status reports, see Earthfiles Archives. Leonard H. Stringfield: \"ITEM B-8 \"The case of the mysterious flying object crashing into the mountains borderingArgentina and Bolivia, May 8, 1978, is well known by research. Was it a meteorite,part of a satellite or spacecraft? Rumors say nothing was ever found after extensivesearch on the precipitous slopes by Bolivian and Argentine military teams and byNASA. In June 1979, I received a stack of clippings from Argentine newspapers with storiesthat claim otherwise. The sender, Nicholas M. Ojeda of Rosario, Argentina, stated inhis letter: '...As you know, our country is one of the most visited areas of the worldby OVNIs as we call them in Latin America. Last year, May 8, we had a verysignificant case in the Salta Province in the north of the country. A long objectcrashed into the mountains. Although some people think it was a meteor or part of asatellite, the case is not closed yet. There is a report of a group of investigators whovanished mysteriously in the area. I really think something big happened in Salta.NASA investigated, but there was not news of it. I have to tell you that in LaPaz,Bolivia, a huge USAF Hercules C-130 carried 'something' from the area where theUFO crashed. What was it?' When this question and the news of the cargo plane being there was put to BobBarry's former C.I.A. contact, he confirmed the flight and admitted, 'I was aboardthat plane.' He offered no answer to, 'What was aboard?' ITEM B-9 Lee M. Graham, UFO researcher, whose occupation is as infrared researchtechnician for Aerojet Electro Systems Co., in California. Lee made considerableeffort in 1979 to reach a medical doctor (name withheld) through a friend, a schoolteacher, who had discussed with him privately some aspects of the research that hadbeen conducted on a recovered live alien body some years before. The doctor, saidGraham, knew a colleague who still had the records of his work. Graham and friendtogether finally reached the doctor for an interview, hoping to be given clearance tocall the out-of-town colleague. The reply: The colleague had passed away - and sohad his medical secretary who knew about the secret records. It was not all in vain. The doctor, who did talk briefly, recalled certain factorsdisclosed about the circulatory system. The skin was pliable, or stretchable, over"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"smooth muscles. There was no perspiration or loss of liquid through the skin and nobody odor. This information tallied with characteristics made known by my othermedical source in Case A-7. ITEM B-10 The Honorable Barry Goldwater, a long-time Arizona Senator and once Presidentialcandidate and a forthright spokesman on military and political affairs, is respectedfor his candor for speaking on the UFO subject. But, alas, what he relates is limited.Response to inquiries contain the same general information; however, couched ineach there is a variation in the text which is perhaps significant. U. S. Senator Barry Goldwater (R-Arizona)January 1, 1909 to May 29, 1998. Goldwater's letter to me dated December 3, 1974, follows:December 3, 1974 U. S. Senator (R-Arizona) Barry Goldwater letter toLeonard Stringfield:'...Let's get this whole UFO thing straight as far as my relationship to it isconcerned. Many years ago, more than I can remember, someone asked me ifI believed in UFOs. I said that I neither believed in them nor disbelieved inthem because I felt that with the billions of planets in our universe, there hadto be at least another on which lived creatures that could accomplish thingswith their brains or whatever they used as brains. I have never seen a UFO,I've never had a personal friend that's seen them, although I've read accountsof reputable pilots who have seen what they described as UFOs. That wasabout the extent of my statement on UFOs, but since then - and that was along time ago - I made an effort to get in the room at Wright-PattersonField where the information was stored and I was denied this request,understandably. Frankly, I'm no expert on this subject. I've never madelengthy statements on it. What I've told you just about sums it up ...' In a letter received by a researcher (S.A.), dated March 28, 1975, Goldwater stated: March 28, 1975 U.S. Senator Goldwater letter to researcher S. A.: '...Thesubject of UFOs is one that has interested me for some long time. About ten ortwelve years ago, I made an effort to find out what was in the building atWright-Patterson Air Force Base where the information is stored that hasbeen collected by the Air Force, and I was understandably denied this request.It is still classified above Top Secret. I have, however, heard that there is aplan underway to release some, if not all, of this material in the near future.I'm just as anxious to see this material as you are, and I hope we will not haveto wait too much longer ...' Then, in a letter dated April 11, 1979, Lee Graham (referred to in Item B-9) whohad questioned Senator Goldwater about my letter in (my book) Situation Red,received the following response: April 11, 1979 U.S. Senator Goldwater letter to Lee Graham: ' ...It is truethat I was denied access to a facility at Wright-Patterson. Because I never gotin, I can't tell you what was inside. We both know about the rumors. Apartfrom that, let me make my position clear. I do not believe that we are the onlyplanet, and of some two billion that exist, that has life on it. I have never seenwhat I would call a UFO, but I have intelligent friends who have, so I can sortof argue either way. ...' The emphasis in each letter is mine. In essence, Goldwater is saying that he wasdenied access to the facility where Top Secret information was stored which he"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"believed concerned the alien craft and bodies. Recall in Case A-3 that my informant,who was stationed at Wright-Patterson during the Goldwater visit, states that theincident caused quite a fiasco among ranking personnel. ITEM B-11 The following excerpted letter, dated June 22, 1978, was received from a source inFlorida, who prefers that his name and location be withheld: June 22, 1978 letter from Florida source to Stringfield: '...this letter is inreference to your book, Situation Red. ...To the point, what really grabbed mewas the letter published on page 252, which was a reply from the Air Force toSenator Goldwater. ...It is an outright lie. In 1951, I became a very good friend with a Major in the Air Force, nowdeceased. I decline to mention his name on paper, but he was an influentialperson, known throughout the world. I worked for him part time, and while Iwas in his house one day, he casually tossed a book to me to read. Eventhough this was over 25 years ago, I still remember distinctly the words on thecover: 'Classified.' I read the book and thought that it was science fiction. ...Idon't remember much of what I read, but one picture I'll never forget. Thephoto showed three or four Air Force personnel holding saucer objects bytheir rims. The objects were about 3 or 4 feet in diameter and were identifiedas UFOs. Printed on the bottom right hand corner was 'Official U.S. Air Forcephoto.' These were remote controlled UFOs that had been captured by the Air Force,that much of the book I do remember ... and, they do have humanoids andUFO craft in their possession.' COMMENT: I phoned the source and got identification of the Major who was a well knownfigure. I also got other details relative to the document he was privileged to haveread. ITEM B-12 In the long history of the UFO, chroniclers and story tellers representing all levelsand from all doubtful depths have surfaced to espouse a theory or an experience.They range from the professional and the authoritative, who have measurablycontributed a lasting message, to the opportunist and the charlatan who have doneeverlasting harm. One, a professional writer, and one of the earliest to release arhetorical bombshell, was Frank Scully. His only UFO book, Behind the FlyingSaucers, (published in 1950) was the first to deal with the UFO crash/retrievalsyndrome. Behind the Flying Saucers © 1950 by Frank Scully.But his glory as author was short-lived. His sensational expose became a sensationalhoax. Indeed, the fate of Scully was to change the course of research for almostthree decades. As a result of Scully's scandalous smear, which got maximumpublicity when the saucer craze was peaking in the early 1950s, it becameunfashionable for any respected researcher to write or talk about a crashed UFO ortheir 'little green men.' Contrary to today, as records will attest, even Encounters ofthe Third Kind were scantily reported in that early era. So completely was Scully'sstory put down that some researchers today wonder, in retrospect, if the book and/orits exposure was contrived. Little new information about Scully since his deathsurfaces for today's evaluation. Any item concerning his life may provide a clue. Ihave uncovered two letters written by Frank Scully in 1954 that deserve review.They came from a collection of saucer memorabilia bound in hard cover discovered"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"by an Australian while browsing in a bookstore in Florida. While writing my book,he obligingly sent me the material for my research. Scully's letter on masthead, Desert Springs Chamber of Commerce, dated April 12,1954 follows: April 12, 1954 letter from writer Frank Scully to a Reverend: 'Dear Rev.----- Thank you for your letter of April 4, which I had better answerimmediately or it will never be answered, I'm so in arrears. I just returnedfrom a convention held in Giant Rock where 5,000 persons held a Saucerianconvention. It is 35 miles from anywhere in the Mojave Desert. All shades ofopinion were represented. But to get to your letter. My chief witnesses as you describe them have notrepudiated one sentence of Behind the Flying Saucers. Dr. Gee was acomposite of 8 different scientists, whose stories were tape recorded and thensynthesized by me where they were in substantial agreement. As for otherswho have similar stories, there are a whole slew of them. Mine dealt withthree saucers and dead crews. George Van Tassel, a former Lockheed testpilot, has out a book, I Rode A Flying Saucer. George Adamski tells apersonal experience in Flying Saucers Have Landed. Another man has oneout called Aboard A Flying Saucer. He claims he was aboard 11 times.Another, Williamson, has one out, The Saucers Speak. There are altogetherabout 10 books. Many go beyond mine, but their authors are not writers assuch. I am. That's my only profession. I claim to have seen nothing. I simplyreported what others claimed they saw. Right now, I am gathering material for This Side of Saucers. It should provemore sensational than Behind The Flying Saucers. I do not know when I willget it finished. Next Spring, probably ... Faithfully (signed) Frank Scully.' Letter on VAR IE TY masthead, dated June 10, 1954 follows: June 10, 1954 letter from writer Frank Scully to a Reverend: 'Dear Rev.---- Thank you for your letter of May 21. I've not seen any response to thatresolution to turn the saucer inquiry over to civilians, have you? At the GiantRock Convention, 5,000 people endorsed this view and you might try yourCongressman, or your Senator, this being an election year, to try his hand atpushing it through. As to the Hunrath-Wilkinson disappearance, I'm afraid it was planned suicideon Hunrath's part. They had gas enough for only three hours and could hardlyget over these high mountains with that. If they lost their bearings and gotover the Pacific, they might easily be drowned without a trace. I'm in the position of a pathologist having reported on grounded saucers anddead crews, and listening now to personal histories of those who have talkedwith live crews and even flown in their saucers. My personal history continuesto be much more prosaic. I've been very ill for several months and have beendoing much research and little writing, but I hope to get on to the latter thissummer in the desert. With renewed thanks for your interest, I remain ...Faithfully (signed) Frank Scully.' \" To be continued in Part 9 - Shoot Out? Between U.
