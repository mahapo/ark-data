In the infectious prion form, wehope the species barrier will protect us. But the recent history of BSE (Mad Cow)suggests it has not.\"- Srinand Sreevatasan, D.V.M., Univ. of Minnesota Oneida County, New York, where Utica is the County Seat.April 7, 2005 Albany, New York - This week on April 2, 2005, a second case of ChronicWasting Disease was confirmed in a white-tailed deer farm in Oneida County, New YorkState. Utica is the county seat. The week before, the first case was reported by New York'sDepartment of Agriculture and Markets and the New York Dept. of EnvironmentalConservation (DEC).Chronic Wasting Disease, also known as CWD, is similar to Mad Cow in its ability totransmit from animal to animal. But so far, CWD has only been found in white-tailed deer,mule deer, elk and moose in North America. Mad Cow also known as bovine spongiformencephalopathy, or BSE - has infected cattle and people in England and many otherEuropean countries since the early 1990s. More than 200 people have died from a MadCow-related disease in Europe after eating infected meat and organs.Since both Chronic Wasting Disease and Mad Cow cause severe brain and nervous systemdeterioration which is always fatal, scientists have been trying to understand how MadCow crosses the species barrier from animals to people. So far CWD has never had aconfirmed link to human illness and death. Both diseases are caused by natural bodyproteins called \"prions\" that become misshapen, or \"folded the wrong way.\" So far no oneknows why the naturally occurring proteins in animals and humans go haywire and causeso much self-destruction in the brain and nervous system.The United States and Canada have been working hard to keep Mad Cow-infected cattleout of the Northern Hemisphere. But there have been a few cases in the past couple ofyears. And while Chronic Wasting Disease was originally a problem only in western deer,elk and moose, the prion disease has now spread to thirteen states from the RockyMountains to New York, and into the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta.In New York State, deer are raised in captive herds called deer farms to sell the meat forvenison stakes or to ship out to game hunting preserves. The bottom line is that all thecaptive herds will eventually be eaten. What New York State is faced with right now areseven deer herds in the same region which now must be taken out of circulation. Of theseven, two herds have had the CWD-infected deer. All twenty animals in those two herdswere killed this week so their brains can be studied at New York's Veterinary DiagnosticLaboratory at Cornell University. Microscopic examination of brain, lymph, tonsil and"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"nervous tissue is the only way to confirm the presence of the destructive proteins.This week, I talked with Michael Fraser, Assistant Commissioner for Media Relations inNew York State's Department of Environmental Conservation in Albany. I asked him ifthey had any idea how the two Oneida County white-tailed deer herds became infectedwith CWD.White-tailed deer like the two in the Oneida County, New York, deer parks which were infectedwith Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD). CWD has now been confirmed in 13 states and two Canadianprovinces.Interviews:Michael Fraser, Assistant Commissioner for Media Relations, New York State'sDepartment of Environmental Conservation, Albany, New York: \"There is a lot we canlearn about CWD. We know its effects. We no it's always fatal. As far as transmission fromanimal to animal, we're still in a learning process. Because of that, because there arequestions that need to be answered, we implemented stringent regulations as aprecautionary measure to try to keep CWD away from New York. We've learned from thestates that have faced this challenge in the west and Midwest. It's fair to say, we arecontinuing to learn more about CWD as time goes on and to try to get more answers.WHAT IS THE CURRENT THINKING ABOUT WHERE THE SOURCE OF THEPRION DISEASE CAME FROM IN THE TWO DEER?That's the matter we're looking into and that's the most important part of our investigationright now. There are a number of theories, but to speculate on one or to narrow down toone is premature. DEC is working with the Dept. of Agriculture Markets to identify thesource. Because we're dealing with captive herds, we are backtracking and trying to dig upas much as we can on the history of transactions, the history of any importation of theseanimals into New York and do whatever we can to make that final determination to putthat piece of the puzzle in place. Uncertain Source of All Deer in Captive HerdsDO YOU KNOW WHERE THE CAPTIVE HERDS CAME FROM?Right now, we haven't made a final determination. It varies from animal to animal. Somewere born on the farm. Others came from different parts of the state. But we're trying totrack all that down and the highest priority for us is to gain more knowledge and get abetter handle on what the source is.SO THE DEC AND OTHERS MIGHT NOT HAVE ADEQUATE PAPER WORK ONEACH ANIMAL IN A CAPTIVE HERD?There's the potential for that if some farm owners kept more diligent records than others.But that's something the Dept. of Agriculture and Markets and our DEC are going to worktogether on and do what we can to find record keeping through interviews and variousmeans to backtrack and do as thorough and comprehensive research as we can on this. 20 Deer In Two CWD-Infected Herds KilledApril 5, 2005, for Medical StudyWHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW TO THESE SEVEN HERDS THE TWO IN"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WHICH YOU HAVE FOUND THE CONFIRMED CWD - AND THE OTHER FIVEHERDS?At the two farms where we have detected CWD, we are conducting depopulation meaningwe are going to take the deer and sample all of the deer at our Cornell laboratories.WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO KILL THEM FIRST.Right. As you know, to take samples to test for CWD, you need brain matter.RIGHT. AND HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT DOING THIS AND HOW MANY ANIMALSWILL BE KILLED?All the animals in the two herds, so you're talking a total of 20 will be killed and sampled.WHEN WILL THE ANIMALS BE KILLED AND SHIPPED TO CORNELL?They will be killed today and shipped immediately to Cornell. We hope to have test resultsback from Cornell within 2 weeks.OK, SO SOMEWHERE AROUND APRIL 18?That's' right.THE GOAL RIGHT NOW IN STUDYING THE 20 ANIMALS, WHICH WOULD BETHE ENTIRE POPULATION OF THE TWO HERDS, IS TO SEE HOW MANY MOREMIGHT BE INFECTED?Correct.WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER FIVE HERDS?Right now from DEC's perspective, we're going to implement regulations and additionalrestrictions on the movement of deer in this immediate area.DOES THAT MEAN YOU ARE GOING TO STOP ANY TRANSPORTATION OF ALLTHE DEER IN THE SEVEN HERDS UNTIL YOU FIND OUT?Correct. Could Wild Deer Outside New YorkCaptive Herds Also Have CWD?IF YOU'VE GOT CAPTIVE HERDS WITH CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE, HOWMANY OF THE WILD DEER POPULATION OUTSIDE THE FENCE COULD ALSOHAVE IT?That's certainly a concern for DEC. And that's why we're going to conduct an extensivemonitoring program around the farms to make that determination. When CWD wasdetected in Wisconsin, we began a sampling program around the state of New York. Forexample, we looked at 3500 deer for CWD including 40 in Oneida County and have notcome back with a positive result. We're going to continue that and intensify our efforts inthis area to determine whether CWD has spread to the wild herds.AND IF IT HAS, WHAT DO YOU DO?That's a good question! We'll continue monitoring. We'll try to implement measures andcontinue our investigation as to source and try to determine if there are other infectedregions in New York. But that's certainly something we're hoping we don't have to get to.BECAUSE THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO PUT OUT AN ADVISORY THROUGHOUTTHE STATE OF NEW YORK TELLING HUNTERS AND RESTAURANTS ANDEVERYONE IT IS NO LONGER SAFE IN THE UNKNOWN TO CONSUME DEERAND ELK?No, I don't think that is something we would do. We recommend to people right now andthis comes from the Dept. of Public Health, not DEC, to not eat a deer or elk that testspositive for CWD.Our greatest concern would be finding that this has spread and gone into the wild deerpopulation. Obviously the ramifications for that would be felt and would be considerable.MEANING ECONOMIC AND PEOPLE WOULD NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"HUNTING AND THERE MIGHT HAVE TO BE A RESTRICTION ON VENISON ANDTHAT SORT OF CONSUMPTION?I don't want to speculate on that, but there is certainly that potential. That is why we havebeen aggressive in our regulation thus far and our response to this will be equallyaggressive. We've seen what's happened in other states and the effects it's had onsportsmen groups, on hunting, on venison donation. Obviously from an economicstandpoint, it certainly not what we want to see for our sportsmen and industries that relyon a healthy deer population to attract tourism that gets people into the outdoors.From our standpoint, that's our primary concern is to contain as much as we can and tofirst determine if it has gotten into the wild deer population and to do whatever we can tomeet the challenges and mitigate the problem. CWD Spread to New York StateFaster Than ExpectedTo be honest, I don't think - when we saw this only as far east as Illinois, I think wethought if it is spreading, it's going to take a little time. But here we are (in 2005) andsomehow we are facing the inevitable a lot sooner than we thought we would have to.IT HAS HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY.Right.THAT IN AND OF ITSELF HAS GOT TO BE A MAJOR CONCERN.Yes and it's not just for us. You can imagine that our neighbors it's got their attention aswell.ALL THE OTHER STATES THAT'S IN EVERYBODY'S MIND. COULD ALL STATESAND CANADIAN PROVINCES END UP WITH CWD? IF SO, THEN WHATHAPPENS?Right.\" CWD, Mad Cow and Other Prion Protein ResearchChronic Wasting Disease and Mad Cow are not the only fatal diseases in which prionproteins change shape and destroy the brain and nervous system. Ranchers have long hadto cope with \"scrapie\" in sheep. But there is no known case in which the scrapie-causingprion protein was transmitted to humans.But people are susceptible to several prion diseases which include:- Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease- Mad Cow-variant (CJD-v) which is transmissible from cattle to humans.- Kuru contracted during a Pacific Island native tradition to eat the brains of deadfamily members.- Alpers syndrome.Many scientists are working on the prion problem. This week I talked with one expertabout research into the differences between the misshapen proteins in CWD, Mad Cowand other prion diseases. He is Dr. Srinand Sreevatasan, Associate Professor of VeterinaryPopulation Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine in the University of Minnesota - St.Paul. He begins with what's happening at the protein level in an analogy with a sheet ofpaper."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"On the left is the normal prion protein, PrP-C. On the right is the abnormal, misshapen PrP-SC.These diagrams are from Huang, Z., Prusiner, Stanley B. and Cohen, Fred E. from \"Structures of PrionProteinsand Conformational Models for Prion Diseases in Prions,\" (ed. S.B. Prusiner) Berlin: Springer-Verlag, ©1996.Srinand Sreevatasan, D.V.M., Associate Professor of Veterinary PopulationMedicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota - St. Paul: \"Andyou nicely fold it into a rocket or airplane form. Then if you take the exact same type ofpaper and just crumple it and toss it across the room, one goes gliding through the roomand the other plops down somewhere. The normally folded protein would serve a functionand it would be like the airplane nicely folded. The crumpled paper would be theabnormally folded protein that does not serve a function, but it does do something elsebecause it has a tendency to aggregate and to destroy cells.USING THAT METAPHOR ABOUT THE FOLDED AIRPLANE AND CRUMPLEDPAPER, IS IT THAT THE MOLECULAR STRUCTURE THAT WOULD MAKE UP THENORMAL PRION PROTEIN GETS SCRAMBLED?Yes, that is correct. It has exactly the same primary amino acid sequence. The way it plopsdown into a different molecular form is a second or third possibility in which it can fold.But the abnormal fold is not favored thermodynamically because the airplane form, ornormal form, is the thermodynamically favored folding pattern. That serves a purpose inthe cell, but what that purpose is is not clearly understood either.AND THE MYSTERY IS: WHAT CAUSES THE MOLECULES TO GO HAYWIRE INTHE FIRST PLACE AND CAUSE THE CRUMPLED PAPER INSTEAD OF THE NICEAIRPLANE?Right. Right.BUT IT IS KIND OF SPOOKY, ISN'T IT, THAT AT THIS MOLECULAR LEVEL THATTHAT WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE NORMAL AND NECESSARY FOR LIFESHOULD TURN INTO CRUMPLED PAPER THAT CAN DESTROY US?Yes. Whether the prion protein is necessary for life is also a question because there havebeen transgenic mice that have been deleted of the PrP-C gene which produces the geneand they live normally like regular mice.So we don't know if it actually serves a purpose. If it does, what kind of function is itserving in the cell? If we understand that, I think we will understand a lot of thesemolecular processes that link to either one form of folding or the other. Misshapen Prion Proteins Remain Hard CrystalsThat Don't Dissolve Into Normal Body WasteWHEN YOU LOOK AND STUDY THE PROTEIN FOLDS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLEFOR CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE AND YOU COMPARE THOSE TO THEPROTEIN FOLDING THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAD COW DISEASE, DO THEPROTEINS LOOK ABOUT THE SAME? OR ARE THERE SUBSTANTIALDIFFERENCES?The problem is that we've never crystallized the protein. I don't believe anyone has so farof CWD versus that of BSE. They are working on it. The amino acid sequences are a little"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"different between bovine and the deer population the normal protein amino acid sequencedoes vary when you look at it in the phylogenetic tree. Although, the ruminant of prionproteins cluster together, they are separated by a small percent of variation in amino acidsequences. And the basic primary amino acid sequences which are the building blocks of aprotein would determine how the protein would fold because they would determine theacidity, the basidity of different parts of the protein. Regardless, the prion protein, if weunderstood the function of it and if we knew what a particular confirmation or foldedpattern would indicate in terms of function, then we would be able to tell if there are majorvariations in the abnormally folded bovine BSE and the CWD prion.We do know that the proteins have a certain memory and a tendency to mis-fold. But mostof the mis-folded proteins in a cell are generally soluble and transported back into a 'trashcan' where they are destroyed. But in this particular situation, I think this CWD misshapenprotein is not soluble, so it is not being destroyed in sufficient speed in order to prevent thedownward cascade toward the disease phenotype.DO YOU ALL HAVE ANY UNDERSTANDING YET ABOUT WHY IT REMAINS IN ACRYSTALLIZED FORM AND DOES NOT GO INTO SOLUBILITY SO IT COULD BEREMOVED FROM THE SYSTEM?Yes and no. That is the major emphasis of certain research groups. I think if you contactedsomeone like Dr. Witold Surewicz at Case Western University, he would tell you that is hismajor thrust that's the question he has been asking for the past several years. He was adisbeliever in the protein-only hypothesis until recently. There are a couple of papers thatwill be coming out soon in the journal Molecular Cell, I believe, about prion test tubestudies done outside of a mammalian system. These studies are very important in studyinghow the proteins mis-fold and how they can become infectious.To directly answer your question about infectious prion protein variations, I don't think weknow enough to actually say that just because a prion is not folded in a particular fashiondoes not mean it's not going to transmit to humans. Or that we could say it means we aresafe and can go on eating any types of meat we want.THAT WE CANNOT SAY THAT?Right, no! We cannot say that because we don't know enough about the protein-foldingcharacteristics to make that call. If we did, we would probably be makingrecommendations about how safe CWD is or not. People Should Not Eat CWD-Infected AnimalsRIGHT, AND THAT'S WHY WHEN TWO WHITE-TAILED DEER THAT AREBASICALLY GROWN FOR PEOPLE TO EAT ARE FOUND IN TWO DIFFERENTHERDS WITH A POSITIVE CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE PRION, IT HAS TORAISE RED FLAGS FOR EVERYBODY IN NEW YORK AND THE STATES WHERETHE PRIONS ARE FOUND, ABOUT EATING GAME THEY KILL, CORRECT?Absolutely! It's better to be safe than sorry. I think in infectious disease we have learnedlessons that you can't ignore an infectious agent and say it does not exist because we havenot found it.One thing to remember is while the transmission of the CWD disease within the sameanimal species is easy, the transmission across species barriers is difficult. This is veryimportant that we keep track of where the animals are moving between states or betweencountries globally.Sure, we have now found two new cases in New York State, but we don't know if it isactually spreading. We know we are identifying more and more cases as we test more andmore animals. We don't know if it is a diagnostic bias just because we went and testedthem and found CWD, or if it's actually spread from the particular same strain of prion thatcould be spreading across the animal population.YOU WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO EAT VENISON THAT HAD A POSITIVEDIAGNOSIS OF CWD?Yes, if it was a positive CWD animal, I would not eat it. In the infectious prion form, wehope the species barrier will protect us. But the recent history of BSE (Mad Cow) suggestsit has not.RIGHT, THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF DEATHS IN EUROPE.Yes. I think it's now 200 something."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"AND IF IT COULD HAPPEN IN EUROPE, IT COULD HAPPEN HERE?Yes, it could. I can't say no to that question. Yeah, it could.\"In normal health, if prion proteins fold the wrong way in animals or humans, the mistakeswill be soluble and be flushed out of the body systems. But in prion disease, for unknownreasons, the misshapen protein is no longer soluble. It's thought to be in a non-solublecrystallized form. The goal of prion researchers now is to isolate the misshapen proteincrystals, if possible. If it can be understood how the proteins fold themselves the wrongway, then maybe scientists can find an antidote that could return prion proteins to theirnormal shape and restore health to the infected animals and humans.Cow infected by Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) that destroys brain tissue, on right,with a myriad of holes that resemble a sponge. Photographs courtesy www.mad-cow.org.More Information:Prion DiseasesA prion has been defined as \"small proteinaceous infectious particles which resistinactivation by procedures that modify nucleic acids.\" The discovery that proteins alonecan transmit an infectious disease has come as a considerable surprise to the scientificcommunity. Prion diseases are often called spongiform encephalopathies because of thepost mortem appearance of the brain with large vacuoles in the cortex and cerebellum.Probably most mammalian species can develop these diseases, which are always fatal.Specific prion diseases in animals are:* Scrapie: sheep* TME (transmissible mink encephalopathy): mink* CWD (chronic wasting disease): mule deer, elk* BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy): cowsHumans are also susceptible to several prion diseases:* CJD: Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease* GSS: Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome* FFI: Fatal familial Insomnia* Kuru* Alpers SyndromePlease see other Earthfiles reports about prion disease:· 03/09/2004 -- 300 Wyoming Elk Dead After Baffling Paralysis· 02/20/2004 -- New Form of Mad Cow Disease Resembles Human Creuzfeldt-JakobDisease (CJD)· 09/28/2002 -- 2002 Mad Cow Disease and West Nile Fever Updates· 04/06/2002 -- Chronic Wasting Disease Spreads to Wisconsin White-Tailed Deer· 04/24/2001 -- Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) in Colorado and Saskatchewan,Canada· 03/26/2001 -- Mad Cow and Foot and Mouth Disease Spreading· 03/21/2001 -- USDA Finally Removes 233 European Sheep from Vermont FarmAfter Court Battles· 02/25/2001 -- Environmental Updates· 02/11/2001 -- Update On Mad Cow Disease· 02/04/2001 -- Mad Cow-like Chronic Wasting Disease in North American Deer andElk· 01/21/2001 -- Prions - The Misshapen Protein That Causes Mad Cow and CJDiseaseWebsites:http://www-micro.msb.le.ac.uk/3035/prions.html"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"http://www.cjdfoundation.org/cjdisease.htmlhttp://www.thedoctorsdoctor.com/diseases/prions.htmhttp://www.mad-cow.org/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
