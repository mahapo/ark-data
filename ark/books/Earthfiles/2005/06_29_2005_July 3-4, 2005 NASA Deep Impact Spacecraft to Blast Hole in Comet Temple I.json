Weaver (Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab).Interview:Jay Melosh, Ph.D., Regent's Professor of Planetary Science, Lunar and PlanetaryLaboratory, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona: \"NASA's Deep Impact is a doublespacecraft. There are two pieces to it. One is the 'impactor' that will actually strike thecomet and the other is the fly-by instrument that will stand off at a safe distance and filmwhat happens. That first separation takes place about 24 hours in advance. There are fourbig springs that push the impactor out of where it's docked right now and send it on its waytoward the comet.The entire impactor is on a collision course at that stage and after we separate from theimpactor, we do a short burn to make sure that the larger spacecraft with cameras the'mother ship' we call it flies by at a safe distance. In fact, it will get no closer than about500 kilometers to the comet.They are both traveling toward the comets at 10 kilometers per second. So, although wepass by the comet, we are still speeding along going by. It's a little like passing an18-wheeler in a sports car. You come up behind it with the sun behind you, you toss out asnowball and film what happens when the snowball collides with the back of the truck.We'll get about 800 seconds of good observation of the comet after we impact it and thenwe zoom on by and turn around and do some back imaging. We expect to see somematerial blasted off the comet lit by the sun, but we won't see the lit surface of the cometany more."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"NASA poster illustrating the 3-foot-diameter impactor, shielded by copper, headed at 23,000 mphfor impact site on Comet Tempel 1 after ejection from its Deep Impact \"mother ship.\" Artwork courtesyNASA.Hole In Comet Made By Kinetic Energy, Not ExplosivesWHAT EXACTLY IS IMPACTING THE COMET?The impactor is a spacecraft that looks a little like a snub-nosed bullet except that it's 3feet in diameter. It has its own propulsion system and its own imaging system that looksout through the front. We will be taking images as we approach the comet and just beforeimpact. We hope to get the highest resolutions of the comet's surface through that. Thefly-by spacecraft (mother ship) won't have the same high degree of resolution as theimpactor that actually strikes the surface.Now, the impactor is constructed with a big copper plate up front and that's our mass that'sgoing to blow the hole in the comet, as well as shielding against dust particles we mightencounter on the way in. Impactor Will Hit Comet At 23,000 MPHI've been asked by a number of people: Why don't you pack the spacecraft with explosivesand blow a big hole that way? In fact, we don't have to do that. The spacecraft is movingso fast, traveling at 23,000 mph, that the amount of kinetic energy for the 820 pound massof the projectile, that it contains TEN TIMES MORE energy than an equal mass of TNTwould contain. We could pack the spacecraft with explosives and it would not add verymuch at all to the explosion that we plan to make in the comet.THAT IMPACTOR IS GOING TO STAY ON THAT COMET IN WHATEVER HOLE ITMAKES?The spacecraft will actually vaporize at that stage. Moving at that speed when it runs intothe comet, the kinetic energy will be turned into heat in a couple of milliseconds. We'llessentially make a ball of plasma, superheated gas at a temperature exceeding 10,000degrees F. And in addition to the spacecraft vaporizing, we plan to vaporize about athousand pounds of the comet's surface itself. That hot gas expanding out of the crater willgive us a great flash we will be imaging even from ground and that flash will tell us whatelements are there and the abundances of elements there.Deep Impact \"mother ship,\" as it zooms by Comet Tempel 1at 23,000 mph on July 3-4, 2005, will photograph the \"impactor\" at it hits comet"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"and makes hole (upper center) about 300 feet wide and 100 feet deep. Humanity'sfirst look inside a comet. Artwork courtesy NASA.HOW BIG A CRATER DO YOU THINK THAT WILL MAKE ON COMET TEMPEL 1?We think the crater will be at most about 300 feet in diameter and about 100 feet deep. Wewere very uncertain about the actual crater size because at present we know nothing aboutcomets. That's what this mission is all about. If the comet surface is dense and strong, we'llmake a small crater. If it's fluffy and very weak, we'll make a big crater. We've designedthe projectile so it will couple in the maximum amount of energy in either case.We don't know whether we are impacting solid, frozen ice, or we are impacting snow. Wehad to make the impactor designed such that it could penetrate and make a big crater ineither material. That was quite a challenge in the design which we think we havesuccessfully addressed by making the impactor kind of in two sections. The snub-nosedpart of the bullet as I described it is a hemisphere of copper that weighs about 317 poundsand it's 20 inches in diameter.If we hit a hard comet, that dense slug of material will penetrate deep into it and deposit alot of the energy of the impactor deep down inside the comet and blow out a big hole. Onthe other hand, if it is really soft, fluffy stuff like snow or Cornflakes or something likethat, what will happen is that the hemisphere by itself would penetrate too deeply. Butthat's attached to a plate about the shape and size of a manhole cover, also made ofcopper. In the case of a fluffy comet, that will slow the impactor down in the outer ten feetor so of the surface, but still couple enough energy to blow out a big crater. That's our kindof 2-step design to making a pretty big crater no matter what the comet is made of. Is This How We Might Deflect A Comet Headed TowardEarth?IS THE MAIN REASON FOR TRYING TO DO THIS TO SEE IF WE HAD A COMETTHAT WAS HEADED TOWARD THE EARTH COULD WE GO OUT AND DEFLECTIT OR DO SOMETHING TO KEEP IT FROM IMPACTING THE EARTH?The prime reason for the mission is actually scientific. The goal is to find out what is deepinside a comet because that contains records of what was going on in our solar systembefore the Earth existed as the planets were forming.As a serendipitous consequence, we will be learning about the mechanical properties of acomet how strong it is, how dense it is and should we ever have to deflect a comet that isthreatening us, these are exactly the kinds of properties we need to know to do aneffective deflection scenario.COULD THIS DEEP IMPACT CHANGE THE COURSE OF TEMPEL 1 IN ANY WAY?In theory, it changes it in a tiny, tiny amount. But even though the spacecraft sounds prettybig and we're delivering a lot of energy. The comet itself is about 4 to 5 miles in diameter.Just working out the ratio of masses, if you think of the impactor as a mosquito, thecomet's mass is equal to the mass of a fully loaded 747. The impactor won't deflect thecomet any more than the impact of a mosquito on the windshield of a 747 would deflect itin flight. Learning What Comet Tempel 1 Is Made OfWHAT IS IT YOU ARE EXPECTING TO FIND IN THE ANALYSIS OF THAT BRIGHTGLOW WHICH WILL BE AN EVAPORATION OF PART OF THAT COMET?We would expect mainly to see elements that are present in ices in the interior of thecomet. We know from observing many other comets that comets are composed both ofices and when I say ices, I mean not just water ice, but dry ice, methane ice, ices of manydifferent elements that only exist at much lower temperatures than we are comfortablewith on Earth. But also, there is a dust component. You can see that in the tails of comets.What we anticipate doing by blasting a hole in the comet is exposing the pristine ices thathave never been disturbed since the beginning of the solar system and ejecting those intospace so we can measure the abundance of the different elements. We will measure thoseelemental abundances by what is called spectroscopy, that is looking at the wavelengths oflight emitted by the glowing plasmas. The different elements each have their ownfingerprints of the frequency of light they emit. By looking at the frequencies of light, we"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"determine which elements are there. And by looking at the brightness of each of thosespectral bands, we can tell how much of the elements are there.SINCE THE IMPACTOR IS GOING TO EVAPORATE, HOW DO YOU SEPARATE OUTWHAT IT'S MADE OF FROM WHAT THE COMET'S MADE OF?Ah, that is a good question.That's in fact why the impactor is made of copper. Copper is not a very common orimportant element in understanding the evolution of the solar system, so we chose thatelement instead of aluminum, for example, because it won't interfere with ourmeasurements of the other elements. We also asked Ball Aerospace, our contractor whobuilt the spacecraft, to do something they've never done before. That was to give us a listof the amount of each different element that is in the spacecraft and we compare that towhat we are expecting to find based on meteorites, carbonaceous chondrites, that webelieve derive from comets. And we insisted that for a certain suite of critical elementsthat the abundances in the impactor be less than the amounts we expect to see in thecomet. So, we avoid that very problem of swamping the things we are interested in. Deep Impact \"Mother Ship\" -highest resolution imaging system that'sever been flown on a spacecraft. Where else could it go?WHAT HAPPENS TO THE DEEP IMPACTOR MOTHER SHIP AS IT FLIES BY?WHERE WILL IT END UP GOING AFTER IT HAS PHOTOGRAPHED THE COMET?There are a couple of things that happen with the flyby spacecraft. The first thing it facesis kind of a dangerous passage. After it images the crater, it passes through the orbitalplane of the comet where most of the dust from the comet accumulates. We have to getthrough that with a live spacecraft. So what we've done is armor one side of the spacecraftand we couldn't afford weight-wise to armor the entire thing. So, we go into what we callshield mode and turn the cameras away from the direction of motion, we turn the shieldedside of the spacecraft into the direction of motion. We have shields on one end of the solarpanels which are critical and for a period of about 20 minutes, we stay in that shield modeas we pass through this band of dust near the comet. We believe we will survive that. Butin case we don't, we will have radioed back as many of the images as we can possibly do something like 10% of them in real time. The rest will be stored aboard the spacecraft.Assuming that we come out of the shield mode just fine, and we have every reason tothink we will, then we will radio the rest of the images back down. We will have most ofthe data from the passage on the ground within a couple of days of the encounter.After that, there are some interesting possibilities. If everything goes as we expect, we'llhave a healthy spacecraft with plenty of fuel, plenty of power and the highest resolutionimaging system that's ever been flown on a spacecraft. There are a number of other cometswe could reach in a period of a couple of years. There are some asteroids we could reachand image as well. That's something we can't plan on before the mission because NASAwould not allow us to commit resources to the so-called follow on mission. But if we comeout as we expect in good health, we will have a number of other targets we could go to. Ofcourse, we won't be able to hit anything again. We only get one shot with an impactor. Butwe will have a wonderful flyby imaging system that we can make good pictures of a lot ofdifferent objects.\"Websites:NASA TV, click on: http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/index.htmlNASA Deep ImpactComet Tempel 1: http://deepimpact.jpl.nasa.gov/science/tempel1.htmlhttp://deepimpact.umd.edu/amateur/where_is.shtmlhttp://spaceplace.jpl.nasa.gov/en/kids/deepimpact/deepimpact.shtmlCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Republication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
