Here begins Part 1of Status Report V. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H.Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Status Report VI begins at Earthfiles 022404. LeonardStringfield died on December 18, 1994. PROLOGUE\"At this writing, many issues of controversy hang over UFO research. Some have causedbitter differences between team members; some can backfire and smear the image ofobjective research itself. In the middle zone, trying to avoid the 'people' problems, I feelthe urgent need to continue my probes into one basic issue - UFO crash/retrievals. In this endeavor, once we can see through the specter of disinformation and findconvincing evidence - or proof - that UFOs are not-and-bolt vehicles with an alien crewaboard, I believe that serious researchers can then go forward to disregard all the otherwispy issues and maybe even put a stop to the disruptive noises coming out of thewoodwork from the far-out fringe. Ideally, with the media supporting the demands for 'bottom line' facts from a strongphalanx of the scientific community, and perhaps some politicians, the UFO cover-up lidmight melt or at least change allowing for some admissions and disclosures. By confirming any one case of an alleged UFO crash and recovery such as Roswell, Aztec,Kingman, El Yunque or even Brown County, Ohio, might alarm the world public, or evendemolish some of its cherished traditions and philosophies. It could also lead to aneventual sharing of alien technologies such as a new propulsion system for inner and outerspace travel or new 'metals' and many other marvels. Certainly it would bring publicsupport for NASA and a bigger budget for vital space probes. More importantly, we mightlearn about the alien entities themselves, their intent for being here and an explanation forsome of their incursive actions - such as abductions! Even at this short-of-proof stage, the UFO crash/retrieval story still unfolding, I believe,should be public information - unless the full UFO story is too exotically grim to tell. Inthat case, I reserve judgment. Feeling confident, I submit new data, based on my research and the cooperative work ofothers, for open review. VE RITAS VINCIT Leonard H. StringfieldDecember 7, 1988 PART I: THE QUIET OF DUSK ... As we close out the decade of the 1980s, new public interest in UFOs, it seems, is surging.Some of it probably is the trickle-down from new books on the market, but for the most"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"part, new and old researchers alike are being spurred by recent revelations of officialcover-up amid some sobering reports of human encounters of the first, second, and thirdkind. Perhaps already an established fact is the climactic close encounter of the fourth kind:contact with an alien race. Based on rumors, contending that a covert human-alienrelationship has been in effect, and of late, more rumors that tell of a ruptured 'alliance,'we must not only pause and wonder about the magnitude of a colossal cover-up, but theimplications of an eventual open contact - even if it were on terms of peacefulco-existence. Any other alternative staggers the imagination! But, getting down to Earth,as we once knew it, we must also pause and ask in all seriousness: Where's the proof that aspacecraft exists? Or, for that matter, that a cover-up exists? A seemingly stupid question when we hear so many lurid tales about abductions, alienunderground installations, genetic manipulation, animal and human mutilations, ofAmerican and Russian satellites exploding in space, of alien artifacts on the Moon andMars, of dire predictions of the world's end. And yes, even to a lesser degree, we hearabout UFO crash/retrievals. Once a blockbuster to research in the late 1970s and early1980s, a crash story in 1988 was no longer big ufological news. As I weigh all the reports, or rumors - mindful of misinformation - I still maintain that it isin C/R research that we might find our elusive proof. Once the hardware and the crews,cadaverous or alive, are forced into public view, then we might find credibility for some ofthe other postulates and be in a better position to espouse endless hypotheses. Sincepresenting my paper, The Fatal Encounter at Ft. Dix-McGuire: A Case Study at theMutual UFO Network Symposium in St. Louis, MO in 1985, and pursuing some leads inthat case to little consequence, I have remained relatively quiet on the literary front. NewC/R reports from time to time have surfaced since 1985, but most were secondhand or ofthe 'Cheshire Cat' variety, providing scant information. What I had, with a few exceptions,were not up to Roswell caliber and these cold wait until ... August and September of 1988. Then in the quiet of dusk, the valley of my researchsuddenly hit a peak. As Dick Hall, the author of Uninvited Guests, Aurora Press, 1988,commented: the 'thermostat' (by official orchestraters) seems to be turned up. During thistime, ten new sources emerged - each promising that useful information about UFOcrash/retrievals would soon follow. By the end of November, most promises were filled -some were firsthand reports and some second. But more importantly, some provided newbackup information for cases cited in my previously published stats reports. Mostrewarding was the timely emergence of persons serving in covert positions withsubstantive information in key areas of my work. Reflecting back, I see in them parallels tothe medical sources in 1978 who surfaced and shared graphic descriptive anatomicaldetails of the alien body for release in Status Report II, The UFO Crash/RetrievalSyndrome. [To be reprinted in future Earthfiles.] As a matter of record, this prototypeinformation remains to this day analogous to most reports of alien encounters and is muchlike the computerized rendition shown in October 1988 on the TV documentary, The UFOCover-up. Proof? Of course not. Getting close to it? Perhaps. And yes, I'm aware of the adroit arts ofmisinformation. While I see no evidence of devious game-playing in my current input, norin some of the material received in the later 1970s and early 1980s, I am aware of anotherrecent suspect annoyance where my name was in blatant public view by a tabloid, theWeekly World News. In its September 20, 1988, issue, I was headlined as an 'expert' havingthe inside scoop on an alleged alien underground facility in Dulce, New Mexico. Bunkum!Fact is, I have no such scoopy news, but I have heard the rumors about Dulce and the onein Nevada and others. Triggering the tabloid article was a story published in a county weekly newspaper who hadcovered my talk on UFO crashes at the Milford Public Library near Cincinnati in April1988. The Weekly World News, however, in picking up the story and my brief reference toDulce, ignored my statement that such reports could be misinformation. Was I being setup, as some researchers wondered, as a target for ridicule? In this case, for the record, Idoubt it, knowing the unscrupulous behavior of the tabloids. Alert to the risk of tabloid exploitation and official machinations that try to maintainsecrecy, one treating a sensitive subject like C/R must also expect the unexpected fromeven 'friendly' quarters. And most often, unexpectedly, from out of the rank-and-file ofresearch comes the sudden strike of a cobra or a 'loop' of such snakes-in-the-grass who tryto take one's work and credibility to task and make a big stinking mess of it. Reasons mightbe many. Is it simply arrogance and a thirst for fame or power? Or is it the work of theorchestraters who pick and choose their lackeys? Whatever the reasons, I have felt theirsting since I presented my first paper, Retrievals of the Third Kind at the MUFONSymposium in Dayton, Ohio in 1978. while most of these early adversaries have faded"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"away, little loops persist who employ subtler ways to undermine my work. Haunting me still is a remark by a loop kingpin averring that all my case histories publishedin my series of Status Reports were 'fairy tales,' thus of no substance. Drawn into his loopis a pundit, a prominent writer in UFO media, who having belittled my work since 1978,has worked well into the scheme. In later years, through his editorial controls, wheneverC/R was an issue, my work was simply snubbed. More recently, still another in the looptold a mutual correspondent that my investigations have no depth and that I'm a goodsubject for misinformation. Obviously, sad to say, these loopers have not done much 'investigation in depth' about mymodus operandi or have taken into consideration the lack of funds at my disposal to followup hundreds of leads coast-to-coast. Also, it is beyond my comprehension how some of mycontemporaries can entertain the notion that I have gullibly accepted as valid, or bonafide, every item of C/R material published in my papers. Once again, for the record, thepurpose of my Status Reports is to draw in new sources with new information that couldeither strengthen a case or give reason to drop it in the circular file. It's true that some of the best made plans go awry and it's true that some entries in mymonographs have obvious weaknesses. Some, based on new information, have becomequestionable. Example is Case A-2, Status Report III ([o be reprinted in future Earthfiles].However, the mainstream material from early sources remains solid and one, I thought,that deserved a full investigation was the Ft. Dix-McGuire case which has become strongerfrom new information and new sources. Someday, perhaps for the record, I might write aspecial paper updating the status quo of my published case histories. While the mid to late 1980s did not produce any substantial Crash/Retrieval case historiesworthy of a monograph, except the Ft. Dix-McGuire affair, it was not devoid of highpoints. CASE 1)Pickled Alien Body in Pentagon Glass Tank, 1952 While attending the MUFON Symposium in St. Louis in 1985, Raymond Jordan, aMUFON investigator gave me a confidential lead to follow up involving a lady who hadworked at the Pentagon in 1952. He said she had seen an alien body 'pickled' in a glasstank in an 'Off Limits' room. By mistake, she had entered the room, was promptly nabbedand forced to sign papers swearing her to secrecy. When I reached the lady, who was stillemployed by a government office, she said: 'I know what you're talking about.' Then sheadded, 'But, I can't talk.' I suggested she communicate by other means to which shereplied, 'No. I don't want to talk about it at all.' CASE 2)Marine Guard At \"Disc-Shaped Vehicle,\" 1963 Thanks to Michael Johnstone, a California researcher, who did some good research spadework, it was arranged for me to talk with a former marine who claimed in 1963 that hestood guard at an undisclosed military base which housed a 'disc-shaped vehicle with ovoidcross section, 40 feet across and 13 feet thick at the center.' A more detailed description ofthe craft appeared in my article, 'The Chase for Proof in a Squirrel's Cage,' published in theBritish book, UFO's 1947-1987. The marine, who signed a security oath, said that heguarded the secret premises for two weeks while a technical crew, speaking in code, triedevery known means to gain entry into the craft, including a laser device. Once he said heobserved that it deflected off the curved side of the craft into the rafters causing somedamage. 'The public should know the truth about UFOs,' the ex-marine told me. But I felthe knew more than he had cautiously related and would not budge in disclosing the nameof the base. CASE 3)Astronaut Says He Saw B&W Film of Alien Bodies On A Slab, 1973 Former military sources with information about witnessing a special movie showingdeceased alien bodies surfaced in the late 1970s. These were published in my StatusReport II (See Cases A-4 and A-9). [To be reprinted in future Earthfiles.] The viewing ofthe film was always behind doors and the viewers were few. Then in 1985, Chris Coffey ofCincinnati, Ohio - a close friend of astronaut Ellison Onizuka - revealed to me that she hadasked him when they met after one of the astronaut's visits to Wright-Patterson AFB,about his interest in UFOs. Onizuka admitted he kept an open mind on the subject andadded that his curiosity was aroused when he and a select group of Air Force pilots atMcClelland AFB in 1973 were shown a black-and-white movie film featuring 'alien bodieson a slab.' In his state of shock, he said he remembered saying aloud, 'Oh, my God!' Chrisknew of my work in C/R and had arranged for me to meet Onizuka to discuss UFOs after"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"his scheduled flight on the space shuttle, Challenger. As it turned out, fate intervenedwhen the shuttle exploded. CASE 4)Retrieval of Crashed Disk in Mexican Desert, 1948 or 1949? With the confusion among researchers over the number, dates and locations for severalalleged UFO crashes on the Texas border with Mexico, and in Mexico, Tom Deuley - whoheads the MUFON team in Texas - wrote to me in February 1988 the following excerpts: To m D e u l e y , Te x a s M U F O N : 'Shortly after returning from Washington (MUFONSymposium), my group was challenged to look into the El Indio-Guerrero case thatis briefly mentioned in the MJ-12 document. ...I'm writing to ask if you can give usany details or rumors beyond what is printed in your papers. ...I have gone throughyour works and made copies of everything that might be related to the El Indiocase.' My response by letter on February 12, 1988 was: Len Stringfield's reply: '...A few weeks ago, I was sorting out some oldcorrespondence and found a letter dated March 1985, on which I had noted, 'Followup.' I noted also that I had tried to reach the sender, seeking more information. But Ireceived no reply. So, I tried again in January of this year. Fortunately, this time Iwas able to reach the son-in-law of the source. Cooperatively, he gave me his phonenumber. Mr. JA in California. Having a friendly chat with JA, I find no reason toquestion his sincerity. He was no UFO buff, having no knowledge of current affairs. ...According to JA, he was aboard the USS McKinley, cargo class, the command shipfor amphibious operations, docked at San Diego. Many admirals aboard. His job:messenger. The time, he said, was late 1948 or early 1949. It was winter and heremembers a quick cruise to Alaska in between those years. JA was on deck when he learned from the top brass that a small task force wasassembled and ordered to go to a certain location (unknown to him) into Mexico toretrieve a crashed 'flying saucer.' They departed by vehicle, but he was not certain ifthey drove to the site or used other means to reach what was described as a 'remoteregion of Mexican desert.' The task force was gone for several days and when theyreturned, he said everything was hushed up. He did, however, hear one of theofficers on the mission say that they got some dead bodies and some managed to getaway. 'They were able to move at great speed,' he recalls the officer saying. JAnever heard more about the saucer or the bodies, but he did remember reading abrief item in a San Diego newspaper about the crash in Mexico.' CASE 5)UFO Crash in St. Geniez, France, 1972? Something unidentified crashed into the rocky slopes of a mountain in the township of St.Geniez, France, March 18, 1972. According to witnesses, it caused brush fires over a fortyacre area. Significant was that the incident occurred during a flap of UFO reports in thatsoutheastern part of France. The story was originally obtained by researcher Olivier Rieffel in 1986, during a meetingwith Leon Visse, the person identified in Dr. Jean Gille's papers published in Status ReportIII (See Case B-8). With Visse's disclosure that the crash occurred near the Durance River,Rieffel informed his colleague, Jean Sider, who found in his records that the time and placecoincided with a reported crash of a 'space object' into a mountain near the town ofSisteron. According to most witnesses, the UFO was described as a 'red ball' of fire andone informed source who prefers anonymity stated it was 'red-orange, shaped like a disc.' While the investigations continue through the well-coordinated teamwork of Sider andRieffel, extensive records of their findings were sent to me for appraisal in April 1988.Included was a fragment from the site of a ceramic-like substance appearing that it hadbeen baked by intense heat; three pages of firsthand reports from witnesses who saw thedescending red object - among them farmers in the region, including the son of a mayor, anewspaper reporter on the scene and members of the police and fire departments. Of notewas an astronomer whose investigations ruled out a meteorite and other meteorologicaland atmospheric phenomena. Said Sider, 'The facts of the case remain classified in the filesof the military and the Nationale Gendarmerie Archives,' adding, 'Confirming all the maindetails was a member of an intelligence agency who stated that 'something' was receivedby the Gendarmerie and shipped in a truck to a location near Paris.' Sider emphasized that his report was not conclusive and investigations were still in"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"progress. Listed were many more names of people directly involved that he hoped to traceand interview. CASE 6)Two Alien Humanoid Skeletons in Kentucky, 1987? Far more spectacular, but affording far less supportive evidence than the St. Geniezincident, is the firsthand report from a retired medical doctor who alleges he accidentallyfound the skeletal remains of two humanoids, possibly of alien origin, on his farm inwestern Kentucky in March 1987. When informed of the story, I was eventually able to reach the doctor through his friend,Bill Boshears, who first aired it on his radio talk show in Cincinnati. Since the show, hewas warned to 'shut up' in no uncertain terms. The doctor, nonetheless, entrusted me withhis name, but would not reveal the location of his farm nor give me or anyone else hisunlisted phone number. He also advised that some of the details he shared with me aboutthe investigation by the Air Force should be kept confidential. The doctor was cordial when he talked with me on his friend's phone, but brief. He saidthat it was during a routine evening stroll on his farm property of 400 acres that hediscovered the extraordinary evidence. Next to a burned-out circle about 4 feet indiameter in an open grassy field, he found the skeletons of two humanoid entities about 4feet apart. Without a trace of clothing, some of the bones showed residual ligament withevidence that predators had been at work, he said. As a doctor, he was certain that thebones were not of animal origin and on closer examination, he was shocked to find that thestructure was bipedal, about 4 feet tall, with a large skull and cat-like jaw, a barrel-like ribcage with long arms and three fingers. For sure, they were not human. The doctor's nextmove was to call the sheriff who, without hesitation, called the Air Force. The next morning at sunrise, the doctor said he was surprised to see three helicopters landin a clearing and many people, some in uniform, some not, being deployed over a widearea. Greeting him was a Colonel (name known to me) who cordially introduced himselfand stated his mission: remove the bones and undersoil, test and remove the burnedcircular soil and comb the area for any other evidence. Later in the day, fresh soil wasfilled in the excavated areas and the doctor was told that the soil in the circle had beenbaked at 3,000 degrees. When asked about the time factor of body decomposition (allowing for predators), heestimated that the aliens had been exposed for less than a hundred days, based on cursoryexamination. Reminding me that 'they put the fear of God in me' after his trip to a military base forfurther interrogation and where he was shown photos of other alien corpses, he expressedinterest in my research. I suggested that we lunch together soon. He agreed, but nevercalled. CASE 7)UFO Crash Brown County, Ohio, 1987? News of a UFO crash on a farm in Brown County (Southwestern Ohio) in the Spring of1987, looked promising at the outset. As I tried to put the pieces of raw information intosome order to make the next move, mainly to reach the principle source, I ran into everyconceivable roadblock. A year later after 'giving up,' information surfaced from a newsource to give credence that something did crash at the farm site. Whatever happened, Icould now see through some of the screwiest diversions that blocked me from contactingthe farmer who claimed he saw the crashed disc, three small female non-human bodiesstrewn in the field, and above all else, had some unusual metallic fragments from thedebris to prove it. My initial informant was JD, a gemologist and a persevering UFO buff. She got manypackages by United Parcel Service on her rural route and learned from the driver that thefarmer 'down the road' had pieces of metal from a UFO that crashed on his property. WhenJD tried to learn the farmer's name and location, the driver got scared. I was later told toavoid the issue, and the UPS driver even changed his route. Undaunted, JD then opted togo to the local police office near the site, hoping to locate the farmer. There, she got therunaround and was advised by one officer to forget the matter. But, according to JD, theofficer with the friendly advice later visited her home. For some unexplained reason, hegave her a photo of the farm property. At this point, JD suddenly showed signs of confusion and fear, claiming that her house hadbeen entered, that the photograph of the property had been taken which she had used as abookmark in a library book (by Major Keyhoe) and that the book was found on the hood"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"of her car in the garage. Next came word that she had been injured in a fall into a sewerhole between her house and garage. The lid had been loosened, she said. Investigating, myson-in-law and I could find nothing else abnormal in her manner of keeping hose. But webegan to wonder about her going off the deep-end and if she had become obsessed to adegree of fantasy? Or, was it all a hoax? Or a ploy of disinformation? Time went by without further contact. But I felt that something was strange, somethingamiss about the case. Concerned, I got in touch with a former Air Force intelligenceofficer who had the 'right' connections. I asked if he could help throw light on the affair.Two days later, he called back to relate that he had been in touch with the 'right' personand was told that there had been 'no significant UFO sightings in that area for the pastyear.' He added that my informant would soon be visited by two investigators in an officialcapacity. Several weeks later, I got a surprise call from JD who said simply, 'I'm not supposed to talkwith you, but here I am.' She went on to explain that she had two visitors. In learning shehad no hidden metal artifacts, they debunked the crash and also my work in crash/retrievalresearch and advised in so many words that she should not contact me in the future. Not long after that, JD called me again, admitting that she had met the farmer, had visitedthe farm, saw the newly added soil over the crash site, and moreover, gave me the farmer'sname. She had made plans for him to visit me the following week. He never came, asexpected, and a few days later when she called, she regretted to tell me that he had beenmoved, expenses paid, to Virginia. This, if true, was supposedly his reward for being agood citizen, a real patriot. In April of 1988, a researcher joined by a person knowledgeable in military intelligenceoperations, visited my home to discuss an abduction case. Inevitably the conversationdrifted to crash/retrievals and I mentioned the alleged crash in Brown County. 'Oh, yes,'said my knowledgeable guest, 'I heard that a jet crashed on a farmer's property.' He added,'It was in an inaccessible area and they had a hard time getting the wreckage out.' A jet? Certainly there had been nothing in the news about a jet crashing the previous springin that locality. As we all know, airplane crashes of any kind always make news. Ofsignificance, my guest also stated, 'I heard from a good source that the government camein and bought the farm and moved the owner out of town.' Much can be said about this case, pro and con. And I'm also omitting some details thatmight compromise the positions and activities of certain people involved.\" Continued in Part 2 - UFO Material in Wright-Patterson AFB Building?Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
