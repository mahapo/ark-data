There, the Juan de Fuca Platemoves downwardbelow the North American Plate along the seismically active Ring of Fire. A large motion downward of theJuan de Fuca Platecould push the North American Plate violently upward in a major earthquake and possibly Indonesia-sizedtsunami. March 10, 2005 Newport, Oregon - An abnormally large number of small earthquakesswarmed in the Juan de Fuca region off Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada,between February and March 4. Then on March 8, 2005, Mount St. Helens released a30,000-foot-high plume of gas and ash. Offshore, U. S. Navy hydrophones picked up atleast 4,000 low magnitude rumblings over six days, which provoked university and NOAAscientists to recently dive down to the sea floor to check out what was happening. Of allthe seismic regions off shore around the continental United States, the Juan de Fuca ridgeis one that could have a subduction event in which plates violently slide over each other asthey did in the huge December Indonesian event. If that did happen in Juan de Fuca, therecould be a very large tsunami as well.To learn what the divers found, this week I talked with Robert Dziak, Ph.D., AssociateProf. of Oceanography at Oregon State University and geoscientist in the National Oceanicand Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory atthe Hatfield Science Center in Newport, Oregon.Interview:Robert Dziak, Ph.D., Associate Prof. of Oceanography at Oregon State Universityand geoscientist in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'sPacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, Hatfield Science Center, Newport,Oregon: \"(The divers) found a lot of sediment stirred up in the area, probably from thelarge number of earthquakes during the swarm. Not a lot of hot water, though, that wouldnormally be associated with a pile of lava on the sea floor. So, it's very likely that this wasa pure sea floor spreading event, tectonic event, where the plates are moving apart. It'sprobably likely that magma was ejected at depth, but did not break through the (sea floor).COULD THIS SWARM POSSIBLY BUILD UP TO SOME LARGE EVENT?Again, this is a sea floor spreading event on the ridge and the plate that is being pushedapart is subducting the North American plate. Where it subducts beneath North America iswhere the hazard for the large earthquake and tsunami originates. So, they are on the same"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"system. That is correct. But the linkage between the two is not very clear. And that's whatwe are basically studying is to understand the system in better detail. Mount St. Helens Released Gas and Ash on Tuesday,March 8, 2005, to 30,000 Feet AltitudeMt. St. Helens released steam and ash around 5:25 p.m. MT,about an hour after a 2.0 magnitude quake on the east side of the mountain,according to Bill Steele, Pacific Northwest Seismograph.

The ocean floor is spreadingapartand forming new ocean crust along the mountain valley as hot magma from the Earth's interior is injectedinto the Juan de Fuca Ridge.\" Graphics by USGS/Cascades Volcano Observatory, Vancouver, Wa.Could the Juan de Fuca Plate CauseAn Indonesia-Size Earthquake and Tsunami?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"HOW WORRIED ARE YOU AND NOAA AND OTHER SCIENTISTS ABOUT AMAJOR EARTHQUAKE HAPPENING THERE AND CAUSING A LOT OFDESTRUCTION AND LARGE TSUNAMI?Certainly it's a concern and we're doing our best the probabilities of these happening.Certainly, after the Indonesia quake, there is a lot more awareness of that, not only in thescientific community but in the public in general. So, we're doing our best to study it andunderstand it.WAS THIS SWARM OF THE 6,000 UNIQUE IN MONITORING THIS REGION?It's uncommon. It's not unique. The swarms of that intensity usually occur every two tothree years along different parts of the ridge. The Juan de Fuca ridge runs from VancouverIsland south all the way to Cape Mendocino off northern California. It's a long system,about 1,000 kilometers. So, it's essentially a long, linear volcano and so you could expectthat different parts of it get active over different periods of time. Again it was anuncommon event that occurs about every two to three years.THEN THE PROBLEM IS THAT NO ONE KNOWS WHEN ONE OF THESE SWARMSMIGHT LEAD TO SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER?Correct. Once an earthquake swarm starts, you never know exactly how large it's going tobe or to what extent. But bigger in terms of more activity on the ridge, not necessarilybigger in terms of developing into a bigger earthquake on the subduction zone or anythinglike that.DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE WITH THE CURRENT TECHNOLOGY ANDSCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE NOW TO GIVE ADVANCE WARNING TOTHE POPULATION THERE IF SOMETHING WAS BUILDING UP? OR WOULD IT BEANOTHER BIG SURPRISE AS HAPPENED IN INDONESIA?That's a tough question. Current technology it is not really possible to monitor veryaccurately what is happening on the subduction zone. We do our best. We look atearthquakes. There are GBS monitors on the coast and they do see changes in groundmotion and deformation. There may be some kind of warning. In other parts of NOAA,there is the tsunami warning system available and that would also be part of the warningprocess for a tsunami. Also, some of the best warning is just good education and to knowthat at least in coastal communities, if you feel a strong earthquake you should get to highground in case there is a tsunami.IS IT TRUE - FROM YOUR MONITORING POINT OF VIEW WITH INSTRUMENTS -THAT THIS DOES SEEM TO BE A MUCH MORE ACTIVE THAN NORMAL SEISMICTIME ALL AROUND THE WORLD?No, I wouldn't say that. I think there is more awareness now in the media following theIndonesia earthquake. The areas that are active are generally pretty active all the time.Somewhere in the world there is always lots of earthquakes and a volcano erupting. To me,this appears to be normal activity.\"Website:USGS: http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/JuanDeFucaRidge/framework.htmlNOAA: http://www.noaa.gov/volcanoes.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
