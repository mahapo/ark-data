The series of status reports, I through VII, werewritten by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report IV begins atEarthfiles 021205. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. Leonard H. Stringfield: CASE B-8: 1979, Autopsy of Humanoids Allegedly, UFO affairs involving the United States and many world governments are of thehighest degree of secrecy. If my 'insiders,' both here and abroad are correct, there is a highlevel international exchange of UFO data and a cooperative contingency plan for aliencraft retrieval. I have been told on good authority that countries in NATO have closeIntelligence ties as does the U. S. with Australia and New Zealand, and some countries inLatin America, Asia and Africa. Some insiders even believe that Russia, and morerecently, the Peoples Republic of China, share a close detente on UFO matters. But,except for the sensational 'stuff' which gets top billing in some tabloids, precious little ofthe real tactical or scientific data leak out to trickle down to the researcher. Althoughstories of crashed alien craft surface from distant lands from time to time, the stories ofrecovered occupants are rare. Thanks to a new French connection, maybe there is light inthe end of the international tunnel. Word about an alleged French medical consultation, involving a post mortem evaluation oftwo cadavers in the United States came by letter from Jean Sider of Clichy, France, onApril 17, 1980. In this letter he referred me to Dr. John Gille of Paris, with credentials inthe Centre National De Richerche Scientific (National Scientific Research Center), anequivalent to NASA. Dr. Gille's response to my request for information came by letter dated May 7, 1980, asfollows: 'Dear Mr. Stringfield, ...I had decided to write to you before receiving your kindletter of April 28, 1980. I got a copy of Situation Red (© 1978 by Leonard H.Stringfield.) For me, it was a nice breath of fresh air in the somehow dreary field ofUfology. Of course, I knew of some UFO crash/retrieval affairs and I began toinvestigate one. Here follows a summary of what I know about that affair:In the spring 1978, I met Jean-Charles Fumoux, then chairman of a little UFOassociation, the A. D. E. P. S., in the south of France. What led me to this group wasthe desire to meet a certain Francois Gardes - alias Julien -- a former member of theFrench Intelligence community and a former chairman of ADEPS. I had concludedat that time that all important and sensitive information about UFOs, at leastavailable, were in the possession of members of Intelligence agencies. Turning backto Fumoux, he told me some anecdotes of very high strangeness level. The one"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"which involved two UFOs that crashed into a marsh seemed to me the most easilycheckable and is summarized in the 5 pages I enclose, a photocopy of the Frenchoriginal account, typed by Fumoux. Months afterward, I succeeded to get from Fumoux the name - and later, the way toget the address of the 'professor' who caught a glimpse of the deceased aliens. Hewas a Mr. Leon Visse living at St. Pourcain-sur-Sioule (a village near the little city ofMoulins in the French department of Allier). The person who gave me the address ofVisse was his employer, the Director of the College Notre-Dame in Moulins, asecondary school of denominational nature. Visse gave me an appointment and I met him at his home February 6, 1979. He is aman between 50 and 60, the appearance of a country doctor. I explained the aim ofmy visit - his involvement in a humanoid's autopsy affair. He denied all at once, butfailed to show any sign of amazement. 'I never had any participation in any humanoid's autopsy affair,' he said very quietly.'Nevertheless, what you just told me (I had given him a sketchy account of theFumoux story) is perfectly true. Only a biologist of really big caliber could imagine adescription of the body of an extraterrestrial alien which so accurately fits with thegreat principles of modern biology and exobiology.' 'This sober description contains an interesting detail,' said Visse. 'The alleged factwas that alien bodies exhibited a much more developed lymphatic system than thestandard human body. Never would a medical student be able to fantasize such atrick.' Mr. Visse went on for a long time explaining to me that hyper-development of thelymphatic system would be hypothetically normal for interstellar travelers. Aneffective antigenic system was duly needed to avoid possible diseases produced bymicroorganisms which are said to infest areas in the galaxy. On the other hand, hesaid, very few muscular needs were to be expected for individuals belonging tospace civilizations. Therefore, a diminished cardiovascular system which wasprecisely what the alien bodies showed. Mr. Visse made the point that dredging of the bottom of the seas was given up a fewyears ago, both by the U. S. A. and the soviet Union. The cause of that would be therisk that an unknown virus would be brought up to the surface, providing occasionsfor it to wipe out the whole of mankind. I reminded him about The AndromedaStrain by Michael Crichton, a so-called fictional book. He agreed that such books ormovies were devised as a covert warning. Mr. Visse concluded with these words: 'Your informant protected himself giving myname. To hide his actual source, he cited me, thinking you would never reach me.'Visse told me to go to survivors of the French team, which won the Nobel Prize in1965.[Editor's Note: The 1965 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded\"for their discoveries concerning genetic control of enzyme and virussynthesis\" to Francois Jacob, M. D. and Ph.D., Andre Lwoff, M. D. andPh.D., and Jacques Monod, Ph.D., all from the Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.] I met Prof. Andre Lwoff on 10.25.79, at his office at the Institute Pasteur in Paris.He ousted me quickly, saying he was aware of nothing concerning this affair andthat, of course, flying saucers do not exist and were only swamp gas, meteorologicalballoons, misinterpretations and hoaxes. He said Prof. (Edward) Condon provedthis. So, I was led to a dead end. I got no more information. Visse never sent me thedocuments he promised me. I saw Fumoux again several times and he swore to methat Visse was indeed the real man. I knew Fumoux was a former Air Force officerand that he had connections at that time - and maybe still - with Intelligence circles.He also told me two or three interesting UFO C/R stories.' Leonard H. Stringfield: \"Next, I met Dr. Gille in Houston at the MUFON Symposium in June 1980, where we triedto find the time and place to talk privately, but circumstances prevented an adequatediscussion. Time passed and when it became known that I was preparing my thirdmonograph on UFO Crash/Retrievals, I heard from the scientist again by phone, followed"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"by a letter. His letter of November 20, 1981, said in part: 'I am preparing a comparative report aboutthe variations in Fumoux's testimony, which in my opinion, serve as a contrived method heused to tell a genuine fact.' Enclosed was a section of J. C. Fumoux's recent book, Preuves Scientifiques OVNI(published in Monaco in 1981), which he had translated for my review. It is quoted in partas follows: Excerpt from Preuves Scientifiques OVNI © 1981 by J. C. Fumoux: '...the other accounts quoted by Leonard Stringfield come from military officers whowere on duty at Wright-Patterson, or from civilians under military contract at thisbase. Now, more and more American scientists maintain that they have beenappointed by military authority to perform biological analysis or anatomical studieson humanoid bodies. What a coincidence, the name 'Wright-Patterson' crops up intheir remarks. This confirms what a French scientist, Mr. L. ..., a world famousbiologist, says. He admitted in 1969 to have been dispatched by the Americangovernment to Wright-Patterson to carry out precise experiments. This professor, a former colleague of Lwoff, Monod and Jacob, Nobel Prize winnersin 1965, and a Professor at College de France, told his adventure to a group ofstudents in 1969. During the year 1959, he received an invitation from an Americanscientific organization for a three months lecture tour in the American universities.The subject for these lectures was histons (which are special elements connected tocellular genetic material). In this particular field of research, this professor wasamong the world's number ones. A short time after his lecture, he was asked if he would perform an experiment abouthistonic weight on particular cells. Computation of histonic weight was precisely thefield he knew best, so he eagerly accepted the job. An appointment was scheduled.A few days later, an American scientist, who was also a biologist with whom he keptcorrespondence by mail for many years, came to pick him up. They took the shuttleUSAF plane and wound up at Wright-Paterson AFB. Of course, the Frenchprofessor was very surprised to wind up inside a military compound. But he beganhis work, having all the necessary equipment made available to him and ralliedaround by three assistants who knew their job well. In his first test, he found a ridiculously low histonic weight, much lower than humancells, which looked impossible to him. It had to be one thing or the other: either hewas wrong with his experiments or genetic theories about histons had to be entirelyrevised.[Editor's Note: Histons and DNA are found in the cell nucleus. DNA is adouble stranded structure built up by many millions of nucleotides. DNA istwisted around proteins named Histons which act as spools around whichDNA winds and they play a role in gene regulation. Histones are found in thenuclei of eukaryotic cells.There are 5 different types of Histons.] Logically, he chose the first hypothesis and decided to do his experiments again.After awhile, he got the same results and asked to be allowed to look at the organismfrom which the cells came. His request was of the utmost importance. If not, hewould have to go over again all the studies he had run for years. Was it a particularvirus? Whatever the case, the soundest theories were to be revised and the mostimportant genetic works were challenged. Twin Humanoids, Long Blond Hair To his surprise, he was taken into a special room where he could leisurely study thecorpses of two humanoids. They were very tall (2.3 meters or so, or 7 feet 3 inches)and bore hideous mutilations on their bodies, as if they had been the victims of aroad accident! The heads of these two creatures were intact. The forehead high andbroad. Very long blond hair. The eyes were stretched towards the temples whichgave them an Asiatic look. The nose and the mouth were small. The lips were thin,perfectly delineated. The chin was small and slightly pointed. the two faces werebeardless. Despite slight differences in their facial appearances, the two humanoidslooked like twins. Other facts as well puzzled him. The corpses had stayed in formalin. Nevertheless,they remained perfectly white. They did not have keratin granules which allow thehuman being to get a tan on summer days. He was also allowed to study the other"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"aspects of the two beings' physiology and to note that their lymphatic system wasdominating and virtually had taken the place of their blood system. The eyes ofthese creatures were of a very light blue shade and did not look different from ours.The hands, although slender, were very human-like. On the other end, their toeswere very small and their feet absolutely flat. In the course of this appraisal, his American colleague drew his attention to somedetails which had gone unnoticed. Then he explained that the humanoids were ofextraterrestrial origin. Though he was appalled to have seen two beings belonging toanother world, the French professor was more relieved to note that his genetictheories were not challenged and his twenty years of research did not end in failure. Before leaving Wright-Patterson, two members of the American security servicesmade him swear to secrecy for ten years and he kept his word. His journey back toFrance took place without troubles and he quietly carried on his research work at hisParis laboratory. The department in Wright-Patterson where the two humanoidcorpses rested at the end of the year 1959 was named FTD (TDETR). I have to confess that I have hesitated a long time before publishing this amazingstory which, I don't doubt, will bring down all the French scientists' wrath upon meand particularly from those who work in our official G.E.P.A.N (Groupe d'Etudesdes Phenomenes Aerospatiaux Non-identifies, Study Group for UnidentifiedAerospace Phenomena, established in Toulouse, France in 1977; director was Dr.Claude Poher.) But I did it because I have been granted the French scientist'spermission, providing I don't name him.'\" Continued in Part 10 - More about the autopsy story.Website: Biochemistry: http://www.ida.liu.se/~ulfni/bio/gunilla.pdf GEPAN, France: http://www.ufoevidence.org/documents/doc537.htmCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
