One is that they are really old hominids -shockingly old -or they're not footprints.\" - Paul Renne, Ph.D., UC-Berkeley Left: Human left foot placed next to what appears to be left footprint in volcanic rock, Puebla, Mexico.Right: Possible right footprint, showing toe impressions and ball and heel, first discovered in 2003.Images courtesy John Moores University, U.K. December 8, 2005 Berkeley, California - This past summer on the 4th of July at theBritish Royal Society Summer Exhibition Program, geologist Silvia Gonzalez, Ph.D., fromLiverpool's John Moores University, announced that what appear to be human footprintsin volcanic rock near Puebla, Mexico, were 40,000 years old. Puebla is about 1.5 hours bycar southeast of Mexico City. The date was determined from Optically StimulatedLuminescence (OSL) of \"some baked particles incorporated into the ash.\" Dr. Gonzalesand her colleagues had first discovered the prints in 2003 and hypothesized that earlyhunters walked near a lake there across freshly deposited ash from volcanoes that are stillactive in the region. The ash mixed with rain and water which over time turned to rock. Who those early humans would have been is also hypothesized by Dr. Gonzalez to berelated to the Pe on Woman III, aged around 13,000-years-old, and the Pericues whobecame extinct at the end of the 18th Century. The Pericues, according to Dr. Gonzalez,have been associated with the first native Americans due to their skull characteristics. Left: Pe on female skull, dated to 13,000 years ago.

Possible Pacific Coastal Migration Routes Until recently, archaeologists thought that early inhabitants of North, Central and SouthAmerica arrived the end of the Pleistocene period ( 1.65 million until 10,000 years ago) byhunter-gatherers who migrated from Siberia into Alaska across the Bering Land Bridgewhich was exposed land when sea levels were lower during ice ages. This hypothesis isknown as the \"Clovis-First Model\" which dates back 11,500 years ago. But the July 2005 announcement by Dr. Gonzalez that fossilized human footprints havebeen discovered in 40,000-year-old volcanic rock of the Valsequillo Basin of CentralMexico near Puebla, challenged the Clovis model.

Oneof those doubters is Prof. Paul Renne, Ph.D., Director of the Berkeley GeochronologyCenter and Adjunct Professor of Geology in the Department of Earth and PlanetarySciences at the University of California-Berkeley. When he heard first in 2004 about thealleged 40,000-year-old human footprints, he wanted to see for himself. He was alreadyworking on a Mexico site and asked a colleague to take him to the Cerro Toluquillavolcanic rock prints southeast of Puebla to collect rock samples. Dr. Renne did not dowork on them until provoked by the July 4, 2005, press release from the British RoyalSociety Summer Exhibition Program and subsequent media sensation.Interview: Paul Renne, Ph.D., Director of the Berkeley Geochronology Center and AdjunctProfessor of Geology, Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University ofCalifornia-Berkeley: \"Then I realized: 'OK, this has become an issue and I'm going to tryto resolve it.' It was only after the (July 2005) press release that I decided I would goahead and do the work. So our results are really fresh off the press, literally, to have donethe analyses, written it up and published within a period of about four months. That'spretty quick.When this group (in Great Britain) reported evidence of human presence 40,000 years ago,that was quite a revolutionary thing if it's valid.THE FOOTPRINTS IN THE VOLCANIC ROCK ARE UNIQUE IN SOUTH AMERICA,CENTRAL AMERICA, MEXICO AS LEAST AS FAR AS SCIENTISTS KNOW TODATE?No. If they were truly footprints, then they would be unique. The question is whether theyare truly footprints?YOUR WORK THAT HAS BEEN REPORTED IN NATURE CONTRIBUTES WHAT TOTHIS QUESTION?I heard rumors about these footprints and I wanted to see them, so one of my colleagues,Mike Waters at Texas A & M University - who had been there before took me to see thesite and I had one of my grad students with me. We looked at the surface and after a halfhour or so, we concluded, 'No, these are not footprints.' They didn't look like footprints.We knew we were in exactly the same place that this other group had been because wehave photographs showing various bushes, rocks and you can see it's where this othergroup has reported on its website.So, we knew we were looking at the same features they had seen. What we saw was ahuge variety of shapes of markings on a surface of a volcanic ash, which is pretty hard. It'swell cemented. You can make dents in it or chisel it out, but it's sort of like a crumblyasphalt, let's say.The surface outcrop of Xalnene tuff on which the 'footprints' are found.

Image © 2004 by Paul Renne, Ph.D.THE VOLCANIC ROCK IS 1.3 MILLION YEARS OLD?Yes, it is a volcanic ash and what we've done is to date the pieces of rock that constitutethe ash. We've done a number of these in 9 different pieces of it. We get the same answer:1.3 million years. Furthermore, we also analyzed the magnetic field that is trapped in theserocks, which is a reflection of the magnetic field that the Earth had when they wereerupted. We find that the polarity is reversed when compared to today's magnetic field.There are a couple of important things that follow from that:1) One is that the last time the Earth's magnetic field was reversed, it was 790,000 yearsago. This tells us that the lava had to have erupted longer ago than about 800,000 years,which is consistent with the argon/argon dating that we've done.WHICH IS THE 1.3 MILLION YEARS.The 1.3 million, right.2) But the other important thing that the paleomagnetic data tells us is that the ash waserupted and deposited while it was still very hot because it had to cool through itsmagnetic curie temperature after it had stopped moving in order to explain the consistencyof our results. This tells us that the ash wasn't erupted and deposited somewhere 1.3million years ago and then perhaps eroded and deposited somewhere else 40,000 yearsago. We can rule that out.The upshot of all this is that it's very clear that the ash is much older than anybody wouldthink possible for humans to have made them (prints). In fact, humans - if you define themas being Homo sapiens weren't even around yet. They didn't appear in Africa until the last200,000 years. So, IF and it's a very remote possibility, in my view IF the tracks weremade by hominids, they would be something like Homo erectus. And while this would be avery exciting possibility, it's extremely improbable."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"IS IT IMPROBABLE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T COME UP WITH A MECHANISM OFHOW THE HOMO ERECTUS WOULD HAVE GOTTEN FROM AFRICA TO MEXICO?No, I don't think that's a really insurmountable problem. We know that Homo erectus gotpresumably from Africa to Indonesia, to Java specifically, as long ago as 2 million yearsago. So, Homo sapiens' ancestor was capable of extreme migration. So, I don't think itwould be at all impossible for Homo sapiens to have migrated. The problem is why don'twe see any other evidence?Why haven't we seen any other evidence? Homo sapiens and Homo erectus are they leavefootprints, so to speak. They leave evidence. They were making stone tools. They weredoing all kinds of things. There has been a huge amount of archaeological research in theU. S. and Central and South America. It's inconceivable to me that we would not havefound some other type of evidence by now. But let's just say in the extreme case that noone has found it. Maybe people have found things and they said, 'No, this is impossible. Itcan't be that old, so I'm just going to dismiss it.' That is kind of the conspiracy theorymentality. So, let's say it's theoretically possible. We should not close our minds off to thisoption, and I agree with that to some extent.So we have to go back and look at the purported footprints ourselves and ask ourselves:Are these really footprints? And I started out describing this story to you that I'mcompletely unconvinced. Most people who have seen the marks are completelyunconvinced. But if the group that is making this claim really believes that they arefootprints and won't be swayed by the evidence that's starting to mount against it, thenthere is a very simple thing they have to do. That is to excavate the layers in which themarkings appear and find the same layer in a place where it's still buried by overlyingsediments so it's been protected from any sort of human commerce. That's a real problemwith the surface because there are tire tracks. Cars and trucks drive over it. People arequarrying building stone from this area. They use the volcanic rock as a building stone.And so what they need to do is dig and excavate the same layer from a place where it'scompletely undisturbed and find real convincing footprints. Then they will be takenseriously. So, if they really believe this, it's a fairly simple task to prove it. Human, or Hominid, Footprints? Or something else?IF THEY AREN'T FOOTPRINTS, WHAT DO YOU HYPOTHESIZE THEY MIGHT BE?Because there are vehicles driving across the surface, you get a rock that just rolls off onthe surface. There are lots of rocks scattered around on it today. A truck comes along, hitsthe rock. What happens the mechanics are pretty easy to prove by experiment the rockgets forced down very quickly and makes a little divot in the surface. Then it gets bouncedout. Then you have a divot in the surface. It might be a few millimeters or half an inch orsomething. Now, you've got a low point. So other rocks rolling on the surface when it rainsand then another truck comes along and boom! the divot gets enlarged. Because the trucksare coming and going in the same direction, or to and from the same place, what's going tohappen is the divots get worn in an elongated way. So, they look sort of like footprints insome cases. That's my theory, frankly.WHAT ABOUT YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES DOING MORE RESEARCH TO SEEIF IN THE LAYERS THERE MIGHT BE MORE TRACK?Ethically those people were working first and are entitled to make their case and it's a freecountry and we're entitled to tell them how they should do it! (laughs) But they shouldhave the right to either prove themselves right or wrong. In science, it's self-correcting.That's something people don't always appreciate. But there are always people looking overyour shoulder and if you make a mistake, it's going to come to light sooner or later. Thereis no vast conspiracy of scientists to prove each other right all the time. Scientists areactually vicious competitors and they will prove you wrong if you are wrong!So, there is that kind of tendency, but at the same time, I think we would like to see ourcolleagues, if they are wrong, arrive at that themselves and admit it gracefully and reallypreserve some dignity. There are many cases of people who have been proven wrong andthey just refuse to accept it for the rest of their lives. It ruins their careers. They becomebitter and people begin viewing them with a lot of skepticism and it's just very bad. It'sbetter just like when your mom told you when you took cookies out of the cookie jar andyou weren't supposed to: you should admit it and move on and everybody will forgive youbasically. We want to give them that opportunity. And if they are right in the mostimprobable, impossible way, then I'll be the first to say, 'Wow, congratulations. You'vemade the discovery of the century.' I just don't think that's going to happen.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"More Information:For more about ancient archaeology, please see reports below in Earthfiles Archives :· 10/05/2003 -- Part 2 - Cuban Megaliths and the Atlantis Question· 09/25/2002 -- Harvard Egyptologist Discusses Purpose of Shafts and Small \"Doors\"in Cheops Pyramid· 09/24/2003 -- Part 1 - Update On Deep Water Megalithic Stones and StructuresNear Western Cuba· 07/10/2002 -- Update About Cuba Underwater Megalithic Research· 04/23/2002 -- John Anthony West to Date Weathering of Sphinx and Red PyramidChamber· 02/16/2002 -- Sunken City Off India Coast - 7500 B.
