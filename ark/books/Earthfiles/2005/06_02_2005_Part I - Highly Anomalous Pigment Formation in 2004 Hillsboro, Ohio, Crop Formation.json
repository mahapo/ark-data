Jeffrey Wilson,Director, Independent Crop Circle Researchers Association (ICCRA), in Ohio, forwardedto me an e-mail from the Hillsboro, Ohio, residents, along with a photograph of theiraffected garden plot of corn. The owners wrote: \"We have what most would refer to as a 'crop circle' in our garden plot of corn. Wenoticed it yesterday (July 5, 2004). We have contacted the local sheriff's departmentand he said it did not look like vandalism to him, but rather some type of natural orunexplained phenomena. No one has stepped into it yet, as I thought it might be ofinterest to someone.\" The unanswered question over the years: Does the same energy that creates the anomalousgeometric formations in crops around the world cause randomly downed patterns as wellin grass and cereal crops? If the same energy is involved, why are some patterns geometricand others not? Hillsboro, Ohio Hillsboro, Ohio is near the Hopewell ancient mound region where in 2003,there were several complex crop formations in soybeans noted byyellow in the above map.

It is also smaller than more normal ear below, implying stunted growthwhich has been documented in other corn formations in previous years. Also in the upper ear, you can seelarge \"balloon\" kernels that expanded and did not burst.
