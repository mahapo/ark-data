Image credi t: NASA, ESA, and Hubbl eHeritage Team.May 7, 2005 Boulder, Colorado - In the Earth's 4.5 billion year history so far, there havebeen five major extinction events, plus the current sixth caused by the expansion of humancivilization into animal and plant habitats and subsequent impact on global warming. Thefive previous major extinction events were based on the most complete study ever done ofall the known world marine fossils. That was the life work of University of Chicagopaleontologist, John (Jack) J. Sepkoski, Ph.D. He documented 36,380 genera of marine lifeover the past half a billion years. After his death, his work was published as Compendiumof Fossil Marine Animal Genera and is the most complete reference available for thestudy of biodiversity and extinctions.

The global icephenomenon has happened at least four times in our planet's history, according to theinvestigative work of Prof. Paul Hoffman at Harvard University. Our planet also turnedinto a snowball 800 million years ago and 2 billion years ago.[Editor's Note: Snowball Earth - \"Many lines of evidence support a theory that theentire Earth was ice-covered for long periods 600-700 million years ago. Eachglacial period lasted for millions of years and ended violently under extremegreenhouse conditions. These climate shocks triggered the evolution of multicellularanimal life, and challenge long-held assumptions regarding the limits of globalchange.\" - Paul F. Hoffman, Ph.D. and Daniel P. Schrag, Ph.D., HarvardUniversity.] What would cause the Earth to completely go into deep freeze? And could it happen againin our future? Two scientists have published their theory about the cause of \"SnowballEarth\" in the February 2005 Geophysical Research Letters. Physics Professor, AlexPavlov, Ph.D., originally from St. Petersburg Russia, produced a computer model incollaboration with astronomer, John Bally, Ph.D. both from the Department ofAstrophysical and Planetary Sciences at the University of Colorado in Boulder. Recently Iasked Prof. Bally to explain what he and Dr. Pavlov think has periodically turned theEarth into a snowball. Interview:John Bally, Ph.D., Prof. of Astronomy, Dept. of Astrophysical and PlanetarySciences, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado: \"The big picture here is that welive in a spiral galaxy, about 8.5 kiloparsecs or 30,000 light years from the galactic center(of the Milky Way galaxy.) The disc of the galaxy, in addition to containing stars, containsclouds of gas and dust that astronomers call 'giant molecular clouds.' These clouds are veryinteresting to us because they are sites of ongoing star formation and star births. In fact,our own Sun was born in such a cloud about 4.5 to 4.6 billion years ago.The Milky Way galaxy still contains quite a few maybe on the order of 10,000 such clouds.They are mostly confined to the disc of the galaxy, the place where the sun orbits in itspath around the galactic center. On occasion, we encounter such a cloud by random. It's afairly rare event, but our estimates are that over the last 4.5 billion years, we must haveencountered dozens of such clouds. The solar system actually enters the clouds andencounters a density of gas which is orders of magnitude higher than the average densityaround us today.Just for reference, the typical density of gas between the stars is about 1 atom for everycubic centimeter. When you enter a molecular cloud, that density could increase a factorof 100 or 1000 fold, so you encounter 100 to 1000 molecules, mostly of molecularhydrogen, for every cubic centimeter.One consequence of such an encounter is that as the Sun and solar system move throughsuch a cloud, the pressure of the encounter causes the solar wind to collapse to a fairlysmall radius, sometimes smaller than the Earth's orbital radius. That means that dustparticles that come in from the molecular cloud can actually be captured by the solarsystem and what my colleague at the University of Colorado, Alex Pavlov, Ph.D., hasshown is that although the total effect of this dust is insignificant in terms of absorbingsunlight. But when the heliosphere is collapsed to a radius smaller than the Earth's orbit,this dust can be swept up by the Earth's stratosphere. The latency of this stuff how long thedust stays in the upper atmosphere - can be quite long.So, during the several hundred thousand years it takes for us to pass through such a cloud it could be anywhere from tens of thousands to maybe a million years the upperatmosphere can be loaded with enough dust so that the Earth's climate can be modified.So, what Alex has proposed is that might potentially be a trigger for these global glaciationevents. The idea is that the accumulated interstellar dust that comes in from this molecularcloud encounter can shield enough of the Sun's light so that the surface of the Earth iscooled enough so that in fact glaciation becomes the prevalent mode of the Earth's surface.So, you enter this 'snowball Earth' episode."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Galactic Connection to Snowball Earth Phenomenon?THERE ARE INDICATIONS, I UNDERSTAND, IN THE GEOLOGY OF OUR PLANETTHAT THIS MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED 600 MILLION YEARS AGO, 800 MILLIONYEARS AGO AND AS FAR BACK AS 2 BILLION YEARS AGO. GIVEN THAT ASFOUR EPISODES, IS THERE ANYTHING OUT THERE THAT YOU AND OTHERASTRONOMERS ARE LOOKING AT THAT SUGGESTS THAT IT COULD BEMODERATELY DENSE OR VERY DENSE GAS CLOUDS THAT OUR SOLARSYSTEM IS HEADED FOR NOW?The problem is that these clouds form and dissolve on time scales of tens of millions ofyears. So, we don't know specifically where the clouds were hundreds of millions of yearsago. In fact, it's even very difficult to predict when we might encounter such a cloud again.When we look around the sky, the nearest gas and dust clouds are about 300 light yearsaway from us right now. That takes us many millions of years to travel that distance.However, the clouds themselves will change their structure dramatically on that kind oftime scale, so by the time we get to a location where there might be a cloud today, thatcloud might be completely dissolved.On the other hand, other clouds might reform as the interstellar gases are pushed around.So unfortunately we cannot predict and look around the sky and say, 'Well, 'x' years ago,we passed into a cloud. The distributions of clouds in the galaxy changes with time onEarth, on a shorter time scale than the last glaciation.So our model is statistical. What we can say is that by looking around the sky today, wecan access how frequently we encounter such a cloud. We can do that becauseobservations of the sky show us that typically we have to move a few thousand light yearsin the galaxy on average before you encounter such a cloud. So we typically travel about20 kilometers per second through space in respect to the background of stars and gas. Thatmeans we cover about every million years, we travel about 60 light years. It would take usseveral thousand light years before we had a reasonable chance of encountering such acloud (dense gas and dust.) So the mean interval between encountering clouds iscomparable to the time scale in which the clouds themselves change. So, unfortunately wecannot say when the last clouds and solar encounter occurred or when the next one willhappen.What we can say with a fair degree of confidence is that we have not suffered such anencounter in the past few million years. If you look back in the direction from which theSun is moving, there are no dense clouds there today out to many hundreds of light years.Similarly, if you look at our projected motion into the future as we move around thegalaxy, again there are no nearby clouds along our path. So, what we can say to somedegree of confidence is that in the past 10 million years, and in the next 10 million years,there will be no such encounter in our history.Similarly, another 5 billion years in the future the total amount of molecular material in thegalaxy will be lower by a comparable amount, by a factor of three. So, not only is thegalaxy dynamic, but it appears that this process is running down as molecular cloudsconvert some of their mass into long-lived, low-mass stars.WHICH IS GOOD NEWS FOR THE EARTH BECAUSE GOING INTO AN ICYSNOWBALL WOULD REALLY BE A MAJOR EXTINCTION EVENT.Oh, absolutely! Absolutely!WHAT WE MAY BE SEEING HERE IS THAT FINALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME WEMIGHT BE COMING UP WITH A POSSIBLE ANSWER TO WHY THERE HAVEBEEN GLOBAL GLACIATION PERIODS THAT HAVE SO PUZZLED SCIENTISTS.Correct.AND THE ANSWER ITSELF MIGHT BE A PHENOMENON IN THE GALAXY THATMIGHT NOT HAPPEN AGAIN AT ALL.It might not happen again. On the other hand, it could.IS THERE ANY WAY ON OUR PLANET OF LOOKING FOR ABSOLUTESCIENTIFICALLY DEMONSTRABLE PROOF OF A GALACTIC CONNECTION TOTHE EARTH SNOWBALL PHENOMENON?Yes, there is a potential test specifically short-lived nucleotides, isotopes of elements thatare short-lived and that would require supernova for their formation. For example, mostmolecular clouds where star formations are going on, massive stars will explode assupernovae. those explosions pollute the surrounding interstellar gas and dust with"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"short-lived radioactivity. An example would be the rare species of iron known as Iron 60,which has 4 more neutrons than standard Iron 56. That species, Iron 60, has a half life of700,000 years or so. So if we passed through a molecular cloud that had recently beenpolluted by a recent supernova, then we would expect that some of the dust the Earthswept up would be enriched in this short-lived isotope. So, the daughter product of thoseisotopes could be identified in geological sediments on Earth.There are a number of potential isotopes having a variety of life times which could be usedas a direct test that the Earth was polluted by some source of radioactivity which wasgenerated in a supernova event well after the formation of the Earth. That would be a testof this model.IS ANYBODY LOOKING FOR THAT NOW?I believe they are. What one has to do is deep sea ice cores or core samples of the rockswhere we think we can tell the rock dates back to the time of the ice ball glaciation. Thetest will be to look for the rare isotopes and their daughter products. The isotopes will havedecayed, but in minerals in which these isotopes are present, the daughter products of theisotopes should be present. So this is an in principal test and I believe there are variousgroups attempting to do these experiments. How Has Earth Changed from Snowball Ice to Greenhouse?WHAT HAS PULLED EARTH OUT OF THE GLOBAL ICE BALL CONDITIONS?Ah! My understanding is that it has to do with the carbon cycle. The problem today is thatthe climate to some extent is balanced by the rate at which carbon dioxide is released intothe atmosphere by volcanoes, versus the rate at which the oceans lock it up in mineralssuch as limestone.If you freeze the oceans, you've shut off that cycle because the atmospheric CO2 has noway of getting pulled into the water and deposited as rock. So, the idea is that once you gointo global glaciation, you shut off the carbon cycle, but you haven't shut off the volcanoeswhich have to do with deep mantle processes well below the Earth's surface and oceans.Volcanoes continue to erupt. As a result because you can't sequester the CO2, theatmospheric CO2 increases. That will warm the planet to the point that you reverse theglaciation and melt the ice and all of a sudden you enter a period of extremely hightemperature until the carbon sequestration can remove enough CO2 to rebalance theclimate. So, I think the glaciations are self-limiting by the carbon cycles.HOW DO YOU FREEZE THE TOPS OF OCEANS?You cool the planet. Lower the atmospheric temperature. For example, if you block 5 to10% of the sunlight by dust in the stratosphere, the planet becomes more reflective.Hence, the amount of heat that reaches the surface is diminished. Average globaltemperatures drop to a point where in fact the polar caps grow. If you do this long enoughand severely enough, the polar ice caps can reach right down to the equator. At that point,you have no open ocean left.SO IT IS NOT LIKE STANDING ON THE SHORE OF NEW YORK OR NEW JERSEYAND LOOKING OUT ON AN OCEAN THAT HAS STOPPED MOVING BECAUSE IT'STURNED TO ICE THE WAY WE THINK OF A POND?That's a good question. How rapidly would it happen? I suspect this would take tens ofthousands of years. Dust takes a long time to accumulate, so it's not like the movies whereovernight the planet freezes. I suspect it would take tens of thousands of years. It would bea very gradual decrease in global temperature at the Earth's surface and a gradual increasein the size of the polar caps until they reached the equator. No Earth Snowball Syndrome SinceCambrian Spread of Land PlantsDO WE KNOW EXACTLY WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THAT THE ANTARCTICWAS COMPLETELY FREE OF ICE?I think it's known. [Editor's Note: At least 20 million years ago or more.] I don't know thatmyself. There are fossil records that indicate quite lush tropical plants. I do not know whatthe age of those fossils are."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"I'M CURIOUS IF THAT WOULD MATCH THE 600 MILLION AND THE 800 MILLIONYEARS AGO THAT PROF. PAVLOV IN HIS HYPOTHESIS?I'm sure the Antarctic fossils are much more modern. The reason is that these twoglaciations occurred before the so-called pre-Cambrian Explosion. More than 600 millionyears ago, there were very few macroscopic plants of any sort. There were virtually noland plants. In fact, the land was mostly desert. Life had simply not yet emerged from thesea. I think it's quite interesting that no global glaciation has occurred since the planetwas colonized by plants. The point I'm making is that the Antarctic record is much youngerfor geologic reasons. The continental land masses have been recycled on time scales ofonly a few million years. And so I'm pretty certain that the Antarctic fossil record does notgo back anywhere near the 600 million time scale that the global glaciation goes back to.\"Plants began to spread over the Earth as the Cambrian Age started around 550 million years go.The thin lines above Pleistocene is our modern Holocene Age of the past 10,000 years.Graphic Copyright © 1996 by macrae@geo.ucalgary.caMore Information:See other Earthfiles about Ice Ages· 04/01/2005 -- What's Killing Off Marine Life Every 62 Million Years?· 02/22/2005 -- Frozen Sea Near Martian Equator Size of Lake Michigan· 12/31/2004 -- Abrupt Climate Change Occurred Worldwide 5,200 Years Ago· 04/26/2004 -- Update About Microbiologist Dan Burisch, Ph.D.· 08/27/2003 -- No Ancient Oceans On Mars?
