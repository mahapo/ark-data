During our search, some localinhabitant Mr Zbigniew Wasilewski, came to us and told us that he also discoveredtwo circles in his wheat field the previous day. Older Wheat Circles in Nearby Field \"We immediately visited these places. The first circle situated about 1 kilometer (1.6miles) from the rye formation was a regular one that was 12.30 meters x 12.30meters (about 39 feet) in the wheat, lying on the right side like the rye.

In this circle, the wheat wasalready almost standing up. It might have meant that the circle must have beencreated at least two weeks earlier. We got some samples on the ears of the crop andthe ground to analyze.\"Half a kilometer from the first wheat circle, was a second circle in wheat about 15 meters (49 feet) indiameterthat had already begun to rise, indicating it might have been created two weeksbefore June 18, 2005.
