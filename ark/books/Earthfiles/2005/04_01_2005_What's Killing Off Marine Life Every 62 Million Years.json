Graphic © 2005 by Richard Muller, Ph.D. Apri1 1, 2005 Berkeley, California - Whatever humans do, or don't do, in this century tohelp sustain the Earth's ecosystem, it appears that our planet has endured some kind ofassault every 62 million years which kills marine life all over the world. The last big globalcatastrophe is definitely linked to the impact of a large asteroid near the Yucatan Peninsulain the Gulf of Mexico 65 million years ago. About 75% of all living creatures in the oceansand on land were literally wiped out to extinction, including the dinosaurs. Could there bea 62-million-year cycle of asteroids, comets or other cosmic debris that affects our solarsystem and Earth? Or is it fluctuations in our Sun? Or the periodic volcanic violence of ourown planet? Or something else?Those are the questions that physicist Richard Muller and his graduate student, RobertRohde, have been trying to answer over the past few years and recently published theirfindings in the March 10, 2005, issue of the British science journal, Nature. What cametogether to make their investigation possible were two scientific accomplishments. First,the most complete study ever done of all the known world marine fossils was the life workof University of Chicago paleontologist, Jack Sepkoski. He documented 36,380 genera ofmarine life over the past half a billion years. After his death, his work was published asCompendium of Fossil Marine Animal Genera. That is the most complete referenceavailable for the study of biodiversity and extinctions.Then last year emerged a computer model known as the \"2004 Geochronology TimeScale.\" Prof. Richard Muller and Robert Rohde combined the Compendium and TimeScale to search for cycles of extinction in the marine fossil record. And where they beganwas a discovery that Prof. Sepkowski had found while assembling his meticulouscompendium of fossils.Interview:Richard Muller, Ph.D., Prof. of Physics, University of California - Berkeley,Berkeley, California: \"About twenty years ago, Sepkowski found an interesting andintriguing pattern in the recent fossil record. They found great extinctions when animals goaway abruptly appeared to occur every 26 million years. Back then, they had the data andthey were analyzing it and published their papers. Now, that their data are all publiclyavailable and in this form that we could use on a computer, I wanted to verify and see ifthat 26 million year cycle of sudden mass extinctions was still there. So, that's how webegan the work, looking for that.I enlisted help from a graduate student, Robert Rohde, and one day when I was away, I gotan e-mail from Robert saying that he had been looking for this 26 million year cycle, whichwe believe now is really there. But he found something that was much, much larger it wasa huge variation in the diversity of the fossil genera. Diversity basically measures how"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"many different kinds of creatures there are. So high diversity means there are a lot like wefind in the rainforests today but over the whole Earth. Low diversity means that for somereason, and it could be many reasons, there aren't that many, that the variety hasdecreased.We found this huge cycle at every 62 million years when diversity would grow and then itwould collapse and it would grow and then collapse and the cycle was quite regular. Thatwas a real surprise much bigger than what we were looking for.WE KNOW THE DINOSAURS AND A LOT OF LIFE WERE WIPED OUT 65MILLION YEARS AGO BY AN ASTEROID. DOES THAT IN ANY WAY TIE INTOTHE 62 MILLION CYCLE?Red circle represents the Chicxulub impact crater in northwestern Yucatan peninsulaproduced by the violent impact of an object about 6 miles (10 kilometers) wide when dinosaurswere alive on the earth 65 million years ago. Asteroid, or comet, it punched through 22 miles of the earth'scrustand is thought to be the extinction event that annihilated more than 75% of all earth life.Map courtesy of marine geophysicist Gail L. Christeson.Your number is absolutely correct and yes, it does. If this were the only thing going on, wewould now be in an era of low diversity. But there are two things that compensate for that:One of them is that for the last 100-150 million years, biodiversity has beenincreasing on top of the 62 million cycle. So, that increase is a bigger effect.The other effect is that with closer examination into these data, we found there is asecond cycle, almost as strong as the 62 million cycle. That's 140 million years. So,these two things come and go the 62 million cycle and a somewhat weaker 140million cycle. The 140 million year cycle was at its low diversity point 65 millionyears ago. But now it's at a relatively high point. So, they tend to cancel (each otherout). Because of these two effects, the growth in diversity and the fact that the 140million year cycle is now in a peak of diversity, the (62 million low diversity) cycleeffect is not very big at present. Ice Ages and 140 Million Year Galactic Cycle?I THINK THE 140 MILLION YEAR CYCLE IS ASSOCIATED WITH CYCLIC ICEAGES ON THE EARTH. YET WE CAME OUT OF AN ICE AGE ONLY 12,000 YEARSAGO. IS THERE ANY CONNECTION THERE?The Ice Ages we've basically been in a constant Ice Age for the past million years. Yes, wecame out of one about 12,000 years ago, but we've been coming out of them every100,000 years for a short period. We're kind of near the end of one of those short periodsright now. If we look over the past million years, it's been mostly ice, with short periods ofwhat we call 'inter-glacials.' We happen to be in one of those right now.When I talk about the 140 million year cycle of the Ice Ages, I'm referring to the fact thatright now there is lots of ice with short inter-glacials, whereas if you go back 65 millionyears, there was actually very little ice ever! So, these microscopic things 12,000 yearssounds like a long time to you and me. But on the cycle of 65 million years, it's just a blinkof an eye. Milky Way Galaxy Bands of Dust and Gas?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Mapping of variable stars, neutral hydrogen radio maps and star clusters gives this current view of theMilky Way Galaxy seen face-on, with our Sun/solar system in one of the arms.Graphic courtesy Oregon State University.COULD THE 62 MILLION CYCLE THAT YOU HAVE JUST DESCRIBED BERELATED TO THE ENTIRE SOLAR SYSTEM, GOING THROUGH SOME BUMPYPATCHES OF GAS AND DUST EVERY 62 MILLION YEARS?That's my favorite hypothesis. But there is no evidence there is dust out there with thatkind of regularity. When Robert and I looked to see how often we passed regions of dustin the galaxy, the best answer was around 140 million years although it might be longer orshorter. But we could not find any pattern that would be 62 million years.So, the 140 million year cycle could be due to the passing of the Sun and Earth throughthese dense regions called the galactic arms. That's plausible. But looking hard and talkingto the experts, 62 million years there is nothing out there that we know of that we passthrough every 62 million years. Doesn't mean it's not there, but now it's moving away fromscience to mere speculation. Fluctuating Sun?Sept. 14, 1999 -- Huge, handle-shaped solar prominence of relatively cool dense plasmaerupted into the Sun's hot, thin corona. Upper chromosphere was 60,000 degrees Kelvin. The hottest areasappear almost white, while the darker red areas are cooler. Image courtesy Solar and HeliosphericObservatory.We looked hard at lots of things. Maybe the Sun could be undergoing some sort ofoscillation and gets brighter every 62 million years. So, we looked hard at solar theory tosee whether the reactions that are going on in the Sun maybe there is something somebodymissed. Maybe there is something that heats up and cools off. We looked at solar theory.We do understand the Sun pretty well and we can pretty well rule that out as anexplanation. Mega Volcanoes?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Another possibility is that we are undergoing regular volcanic eruptions. This is RobertRohde's favorite. If you have a source of heat, as we do deep down in the Earth, everynow and then a big blob could come up to the surface, create a huge volcanic eruption,and those might occur on a regular pattern. Once you have relieved the pressure, then itsettles down for awhile maybe 62 million years. So, we looked at the records of volcaniceruptions and in fact, there were huge volcanic eruptions right around the time when thedinosaurs went extinct 65 million years ago.There was another (volcanic eruption) right at the Permian-Triassic, one of the greatestextinctions of all time, at 250 million years ago. Maybe that's what's really going on here.There have been lava flows so big they would cover the state of California!It turns out that there does not seem to be a regularity of these eruptions every 62 millionyears, except for those two. So, it's possible as we get better geologic data, it will verifythat the cycle is due to volcanic eruptions. But right now, the evidence does not supportthat. Earth-Crossing Cycles of Asteroids and Comets?December 11, 1998, frozen swirls of molten rock in meteorite.The discovery of a 3.3-million-year-old meteorite impact site in Argentina has revealeda sharp dip in the ocean temperature occurred at the same time as dozens of species were suddenly wiped outand also when a thick layer of molten rock was formed. The extreme pressure at impact would meltthe rocks and create a cloud of dust or smoke which would block out the sun's warming light.WE SAY THAT THE DINOSAURS WERE WIPED OUT BY AN ASTEROID THATWENT INTO THE YUCATAN AREA. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THERE COULD BESOMETHING THAT CYCLES IN THE ASTEROID BELT OR KUIPER BELT?That is asteroid impacts occurring. We know there was a great asteroid impact 65 millionyears ago and that played some role here (in the 62 million cycle). So, it suggests thatmaybe every one of the cycles should be due to an asteroid or cometary impact. Theproblem there is that the evidence that other cycles are caused by impacts is really veryweak. to come up with an explanation I tried very hard to come up with an explanation forsomething that would cause asteroid or comet impacts every 62 million years. You can saythat something is there, but that's speculation.The hard part is to do a calculation that shows that something we know about, some simplemechanism you can come up with, would cause such a thing to happen. Maybe there is astar, like the Nemesis, that's on a 62 million cycle (instead of 26 million). But I can rulethat out because the calculations show the orbit is unstable.So, we tried lots of ideas, but we could not make any of them work. Right now, we're at aloss. We don't know what causes the 62 million year cycle.IS IT POSSIBLE THAT CURRENT HUMAN CIVILIZATION SIMPLY HAS NOT BEENAROUND LONG ENOUGH TO HAVE A REALITY CHECK ON THE CYCLES OFGALACTIC ARMS AND ASTEROIDS AND THE SUN?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"I think that must be the answer. Our science is really just at the beginning of astrophysics.The things we don't know about the galaxy anybody who is an expert in this would behappy to list them. Dark matter is a big mystery. Dark energy is a big mystery. We don'tknow if our galaxy has four arms or two arms. We don't really understand what is going onat the core of the Milky way galaxy. So, there are a huge amount of things for futurescientists to figure out. I'm hoping that when they do, one of them will turn out to say:'Look at this, here is something that's 62 million years.'YOU'RE USING THAT NUMBER, 62 MILLION. AND WE KNOW THE ASTEROIDCRASHED INTO THE EARTH ABOUT 65 MILLION YEARS AGO AND THEDINOSAURS AND SO MUCH LIFE WAS WIPED OUT. DOES THAT MEAN WE AREOVERDUE FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN NOW?Not necessarily overdue. If the cycle is right, then there is a larger number of impactshitting the Earth every 62 million years. If we look over the history of the Earth and life onEarth which goes back over 300 million years, then we see these cycles. The data as welook at them now seem to show more gradual changes, as if there are times lasting half acycle up to 30 or 31 million years when diversity is low. This could come about fromperhaps an impact every few million years. Then there are periods of 30 million yearswhen biodiversity is high. So not every cycle here consists of an event as big as the onethat killed the dinosaurs. It's certainly possible that over the past few million years,asteroid or cometary impacts on the Earth could have helped trigger these kinds of cycles.Since they weren't as big as the one that killed the dinosaurs, we just haven't paid muchattention to them but this is just speculation.\"Prof. Muller will keep trying to figure out which marine animals have been the mostvulnerable to the 62 million cycle of destruction in hopes of finding the cause. Ironically,right now it's humans that are doing the destroying and our very lives depend on what wedo next to protect this planet.More Information:See: Earthfiles053003 Scientists Surprised by Common House Fly Fossils in AntarcticaOther Earthfiles reports about potential extinction events:· 03/20/2005 -- Astronaut John Young: \"The Moon Can Save Earth's Civilization.\"· 02/26/2005 -- Collapse of Societies: From Easter Island to Iraq - to Western World?· 02/03/2005 -- British Scientists Warn Global Temperatures Could Climb HigherThan Earlier Estimates.· 08/27/2004 -- Global Warming Impact On Birds - More Extinctions Expected· 09/02/2003 -- Updated - Astronomers Don't Think Asteroid Will Hit Earth in 2014· 11/14/2002 -- What Happened 12,000 Years Ago That Killed So Many Animals?· 07/20/2002 -- Extinctions of Earth Life Are Accelerating Rapidly· 04/27/2002 -- Earth's Magnetic Anomalies - Could the Poles Flip?· 01/05/2002 -- Global Warming Update - Could Increasing CO2 Gas BeTransformed Into Limestone?· 12/22/2001 -- Scientists Warn That Climate and Earth Life Can Change Rapidly· 06/09/2001 -- Environmental Updates and Colt Mutilated in Leitchfield, Kentucky· 02/25/2001 -- Environmental Updates· 02/07/2001 -- 94% Decline In Aleutian Islands Sea Otter Population· 01/07/2001 -- Dinosaur-Killing Asteroid Punched 22 Miles Through Earth's EntireCrust·10/25/1999 -- A Mysterious \"Perturber\" at the Edges of Our Solar SystemWebsites:Mass Extinctions On Earth: http://www.answers.com/topic/extinction-eventNear-Earth Objects: http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/Volcanoes: http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Solar Activity: http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/Milky Way Galaxy: http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast123/lectures/lec10.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
