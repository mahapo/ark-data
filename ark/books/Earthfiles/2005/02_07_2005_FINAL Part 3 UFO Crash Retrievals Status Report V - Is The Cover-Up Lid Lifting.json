Status Report VI begins at Earthfiles 022404.Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994.Len Stringfield continues:Case 12)Alien Humanoid Shot at Ft. Dix-McGuire AFB, 1978 McGuire AFB and Fort Dix Military Reservation near Wrightstown, New Jersey, are near the U. S. Naval AirStationin Lakehurst, New Jersey. The bases are about 45 miles east of Philadelphia, 50 miles south of New YorkCity,60 miles north of Atlantic City and 10 miles west of the Atlantic ocean. The Fort Dix/McGuireAir Force Base/ Lakehurst Naval Air Station complex covers 42,000 acres.\"The answer to my source's question comes from still another officer allegedly on thescene in early January during a phase of significant UFO activity over the two largemilitary compounds. During this phase, I was told one of the craft had malfunctioned andcrash-landed. One survivor of the crew, lost and starving, managed to reach the outerperimeter near a guard post at Ft. Dix and was shot by an MP. Said my source, theinterloper, mortally wounded, was later found dead at McGuire. Here, relying on Morse'stestimony, the 'alien' was retrieved from an abandoned airstrip. The Lt. Colonel, referred to by the intelligence officer in his letter, who briefed GeneralSadler, had been previously identified by Morse as his Commanding Officer, whose namewas made known to me. His name, rank and serial number, as well as the officers whointerrogated Morse at Wright-Patterson AFB following the incident, had all beenauthenticated by the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1985. Also of interest is a letter of September 12, 1985, from the New Jersey State Police inresponse to a letter from Robert Bletchman, attorney in Manchester, Connecticut, askingabout accessibility to their records of alleged involvement in the incident. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"New Jersey State Police Letter Dated September 12, 1985: ' ...Please be advised that it has been, and continues to be, the policy of the NewJersey State Police that the records, radio logs and other documents maintained atour stations are privileged and are to be kept confidential. We further advise that wedo not consider them to be within the public domain in conjunction with generaldisclosure, etc...' This information should answer those in research who queried the State Police about itsinvolvement and were told that the State Police have no such records. For me, the evidence collected over eight years of investigation into this case might notprove that UFOs are real or extraterrestrial, but it does show that such incidents, if true,would be difficult to explain to a benighted (unenlightened, kept in the dark) public. Thus,the cover-up. CASE 13)Puerto Rico UFO Crash February 19, 1984? If only I had known when I was touring San Juan in Puerto Rico on March 7, 1984, that aUFO had crashed on February 19, into the mountainous region of the El Yunque rainforest. Had I gone there, I would have found units of the military retrieval team still active. Barry Greenwood, Editor of Just Cause, first enlightened me about the crash at theMUFON Symposium in Washington, D. C., in 1987. He then had few details and I heardnothing more. Then in August 1988, Jorge Martin, Editor of Enigma, a UFO pictorial-newsmagazine published in Puerto Rico in Spanish, called me to relate that he had two items ofsignificance. One concerned a possible alien underground facility on the island. The othercontained new information about the 1984 UFO crash. His continuing investigations intothe crash, he said, had produced new sources who had witnessed some important phases ofthe military retrieval operation. Through the gracious assistance of Ms. Anna Gloria Colon, MUFON State Director ofPuerto Rico, Martin's records - including tapes - were translated from Spanish to Englishfor use in this Status Report. Martin, like all Puerto Ricans, first learned of the crash in the news. Witnesses were manyand most described the object as round, white, self-luminous, with a tinge of orange at itsrear outer edge. Flying horizontally to the East, the object suddenly jerked and in archfashion, went straight up, leveled, and then continued its soundless trajectory courseeastward to where it was last seen crashing into the El Yunque mountains. Among thewitnesses were the passengers and crew of a commercial airline flight from the VirginIslands and a firsthand report from two men in FaJardo, who watched from their 10th floorapartment as the object was 'spinning' as it plummeted to Earth. And notably is theexperience of Luis Morales, policeman, who worked out of the Rio Grande police stationnear El Yunque. He saw the object crash and said that when he tried to reach the area, hiscar suddenly went dead. Before too much suspense could be built up in the news, the story was snuffed. Accordingto Martin, a diversionary tactic to keep everybody out of the crash area was thatauthorities told the police that the object was a meteorite that fell well beyond El Yunqueand that investigations had been called off. Not so, said Martin, who talked with Benjamin Gascot, officer for the air rescue divisionoperating out of Isla Grande Airport. According to Gascot, 'Something was wrong aboutthis incident because we as a group of officials always worked together in the past.' Martinalso learned from the officer that on the morning of the investigation, a mysterioushelicopter painted black and without identification showed up at the site. 'The occupants,'he said, 'were dressed in military fatigues and in plain clothes.' He added, 'We were advisednot to talk to the crew.' Confirmation came from another firsthand source, Michael Pazo, who operated a refuelingstation at the Isla Grande Airport. He, too, had seen the helicopter, identified as aChinook, that brought in the military personnel. He further claimed that El Yunque hadbeen under military surveillance for three weeks. Pazo also stated that the object thatcrashed was 'very radioactive' and that he, being a witness to the activities, was told by afederal agent named Swaggart to 'keep things quiet or else ...' Still another source,according to Martin, claimed that a second helicopter landed two days later with morepersonnel and that a Lear jet with NASA markings flew over the El Yunque area for twoweeks. Of Martin's many sources, one working in security (unknown to me), provided him with"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"details of the on-site 'packaging' of the pieces of metal from the wreckage. Said theinformant, the parts were cataloged, labeled and protectively wrapped before being boxedconforming to the exact size of each artifact. Then, the wooden boxes were sprayed with aleaded paint, followed by another coat of a chemical substance, the color of fuchsia. Still hoping to get some kind of official response to the crash, Martin said he asked BarryGreenwood to check with the FAA. Word came back from an official of its SoutheastDivision: no such incident took place. For Martin, it was a flat denial of everything he hadheard from scores of firsthand sources. For me, it was one more case in keeping with thecover-up of all UFO crashes and retrievals and to hide the evidence at all costs. CASE 14)Norton AFB, California, 1973 John Lear, son of William Lear who invented the Lear Jet, was MUFON State Director forNevada in September 1988. Undaunted in his pursuit of people anywhere to get UFO facts,John extensively lectured and made several radio and TV appearances in Las Vegas,Nevada, to tell his story. Listening was 'Mike,' (real name withheld on request) whosurfaced in September 1988, to tell Lear his firsthand story. Admittedly troubled by hisexperience, Mike explained that in 1973 he had been a U.S. Air Force photographerstationed in Hawaii, following his duty in Vietnam. His prime duty in Hawaii was toprocess gun camera film. One day he said he was notified that his security clearance hadbeen upgraded. Several weeks later, he and another photographer in his unit were flown ona temporary duty assignment to North AFB in California. Lear's letter to me dated November 21, 1988, recounted briefly his interview with Mikeand is paraphrased as follows: John Lear Letter, November 21, 1988: 'On landing at Norton, Mike andcompanion were taken by air force vehicle with windows blacked out on a two hourdrive. During the drive, Mike was told by the driver, 'So, you guys are going tophotograph the UFO, eh?' The vehicle came to a halt on a platform which was then lowered into a largeunderground installation. Escorted to a briefing room, they were told that they wereto photograph a flying saucer and the autopsy of three dead aliens. Ordered todisrobe, they were issued white smocks and combat boots for security purposes.Mike was then escorted into the installation where he saw a disc-shaped craft about30 feet in diameter contained in a heavy net suspended from a large crane. Mike was boosted into the opening of the disc (no stairs or ramp) and proceeded tocrawl inside. He was shocked, he said, to find that the inside looked to be about 10times the size of the outside. He commented, 'I could have thrown a football as hardas I could and not hit the other side.' Disoriented, Mike poked his head back outsideto check the size which appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter as before. Onceinside, he met two persons similarly clothed in white smocks who showed him whatthey wanted photographed. He shot many photos of control panels and various otherfixtures and later was asked to photograph the exterior from different angles anddistances. He was later taken to a room in which there were three dead aliens. He describedthem as approximately 5 fee tall, with almost normal, human heads, except the eyeswere more rounded. The skin texture was of baking dough, very white. Before theautopsy, the aliens had been dressed in blue uniforms, like flight suits. As the initial incisions were made for the (alien) autopsy, Mike saw green fluid andblack innards. At this time, he became ill and called for the other photographer tocontinue the assignment. Later that day, they were driven back to Norton wherethey spent the night and were flown out the next day back to Hawaii. About twomonths later, Mike's companion disappeared and neither Mike nor his family haveheard from him since.' Leonard Stringfield: The year 1973 brings to mind Case A-2, Status Report II (to bereprinted in future Earthfiles), where three humanoids were examined at Wright-PattersonAFB. While the head sizes described in each case differed and the body heights alsodiffered by a foot or so, the description of the skin is strikingly similar. In Case A-2,according to the sergeant who stood guard in the underground facility, the color was 'offwhite or cream.' Both observers, it should be noted, were admittedly traumatized by thesight of alien bodies - which could account for visual differences of anatomical sizes andheights. CASE 15)"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Termination Orders for Insiders Who Know Too Much? For those of us in research who wonder or worry about the rigors of cover-up that's beenso effective for a long time, that we have suspicion that the reason for the cover-up mustbe compelling. In fact, so compelling that it might explain why it is maintained at any price- even at the price of sudden death to those having sensitive information and might talk toomuch. Evidence of such thinking finds support in the recent disclosure of a retired police officerwith 22 years of service in an Eastern state. Through the cooperation of John Ford, head ofthe Long Island UFO Network, I first received word on August 5, 1988, that his source hadinformation concerning a crashed disc and the recovery of seven bodies in a western state,which in some way also involved the FBI. Filling Ford's request for a notarized statement and insuring his source's anonymity, I thenreceived his videotaped interview with him. After viewing the tape, which firmlyestablished the former officer's credentials, I reached him by phone for his firsthand story. It was 1973, he said, that he was joined by two FBI agents in a special 3-day trainingprogram for cadets on 'behavioral science' at the police academy. One evening after a longday's work, he and the two agents went out to dine and relax. The subject of UFOs cameup. To his surprise, he said, one talked about a crashed disc in Colorado and the recoveryof bodies. 'What he said next,' added my informant, 'I could tell by his body English that hewas disturbed.' His concern was the means used to insure the cover-up, stating that adoctor who had been called upon in the night for urgent medical needs, died suddenly of'cancer' three weeks later. At that point, according to my informant, he observed that thetalkative agent was booted under the table by his companion. The subject was dropped andnothing was said about the FBI's role in the affair. Sudden and accidental death stories I've heard before. Never finding any substantiation, Irelegated them to be a quirk of orchestrated propaganda, probably a scare tactic tointimidate potential whistle-blowers. Reports of suspicious deaths, darkly and deeply linked to UFOs, however, persist andcontinue to cause speculation. Word comes from Gordon Creighton, Editor of theinformative British Flying Saucer Review, who notes a possible deathly tie-in with the U.S. 'Star Wars' program. Here I quote in part his letter of November 15, 1988: Gordon Creighton, November 15, 1988 letter: '...here in Britain, 22 scientists haverecently either taken their own lives or died in very strange or mysteriouscircumstances. And it seems that most, or all, of them were engaged in British workon behalf of, or related to, the U. S. 'Star Wars' program. The British government, itseems, was trying to hush it up. But press statements here say that the U. S.government had put our British government on the spot and demanded full inquiry.So, quite clearly, it is either the Russians or THEM ...' Len Stringfield: As many researchers have surmised, 'Star Wars' - ostensibly conceived asa defensive system against Russian missile attacks - might have had from its beginning a'defensive' UFO connection. Whatever the case, a 'mock test' in September 1988, of anearth-penetrating warhead, much like 'Star Wars' in reverse - was conducted at theTonapah Test Range in Nevada. Announced as a proposed super-weapon designed todestroy Russian underground command centers dug in solid rock down to 1000 meters,some UFO analysts believe that the real target is not Russian, but another adversary downdeep in cavernous installations in Nevada and New Mexico. According to the Pentagon, the proposed earth-penetrating warhead is 'urgently needed.'According to the rumor mills, an alien race of the 'grays' is in their fortressed undergroundlaboratories and are genetically experimenting with the human race. Even more ominous,rumors say that their intransigence today might lead to new perils tomorrow. It is beyond the scope of this paper to speculate on all the sinister machinations attributedto the alien super-race. But news of the British death syndrome and my awareness of othersuspicious deaths and disappearances - allegedly connected to UFO crash and retrievalevents - must be reckoned with. They might indeed have at least a peripheral pertinence tofears, causing suicide or extreme security measures to maintain a monstrous cover-up. At this writing in early December 1988, I have four other sources with UFO crash/retrievalinformation not included in this report. Most, as far as I know, are in positions to throwstrong light on the humanoid factor and other phases of retrieval operations. They couldconfirm information already cited in my previous papers. But at this stage, and in someinstances, being dependent on intermediaries, I find the material to be either toofragmentary or too sensitive to even hint at its nature."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" The material herein was originally intended as an article to update my work for publicationin the MUFON UFO Journal in early 1989.
