The mutilated corpse of a goatwas found close to Movelier, Jura. The Jurassic cantonal (Jura province)police force seeks for witnesses.For the police, there is not any doubt that the animal was victim of a pervert.The white goat of the Saanen race and four years old, died of thecontinuations of the total ablation of the udder. The udder was not found onthe site. The animal had been in the pasture for two months with about fiftyother animals.One is unaware if this act is to be put on the account of the sadist whomutilates animals in the area of the North-West. This last one (perpetrator)struck about thirty times, often hurting the genital parts of cows, horses,sheep, cats and rabbits.For reasons of tactic, the police force did not reveal certain cases and otherswere announced to it with delay.

But not inevitably with that(perpetrator) who prevailed in the remainder (other places) of Switzerlandlately, even if this new case is not without pointing out the other acts ofcruelty made on animals these last weeks. In an official statement, the policeforce said the animal was a victim of a pervert. But Jurassic cantonalgendarmerie, Hubert Thalmann, said the investigation will have to prove if theperpetrator of the goat mutilation is the same as all the other cases discoveredlately in the bordering cantons (provinces). Many animals have been torturedthe past few weeks in the cantons (provinces) of Basle countryside, Soleureand Argovie. More than 30 cases of mutilations have been reported, acts oftenwith sexual organs removed. Police urge anyone with information to contactthem at 032-420-6565.\" August 18, 2005\"Tracking of a sadist zoophile in SwitzerlandThe police force of three cantons (provinces) in the north of Switzerland offera reward of 26,000 Swiss franks for the capture of the person who hasmutilated animals for several weeks. Acts of zoophile were made on certainanimals.Since the end of May 2005, the triangle located between Basle, Soleure andAarau, in the Swiss countryside, are hot with cases of at least 43 animals -cows, sheep, horses, cats and rabbits - indeed were sadistic victims of actszoophiles. The attacker slices in particular the udders or the genitals of theanimals with a surgical precision.The story causes the agitation in all the country and has been published in theserious and respected newspaper, Le Temps, which devoted a long article tothe subject last weekend.\" August 19, 2005\"Five new casesFive new cases of animal mutilations were announced since last week in theNorth-West of Switzerland. Three suspects were apprehended, but they arenot responsible indicated the ATS (police). The sadist struck 23 times in Basle-Countryside, eleven times in Argovien territory, and nine times in the canton(province) of Soleure. The victims were mainly cows, sheep, horses, cats andrabbits.\" August 22, 2005\"Mutilated animals; four new cases in Switzerland (3 cows and"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"1 horse)The serial torturer, which attacks cows and horses as well as rabbits, sheep orcats, did he perpetrate other crimes in the Bernese Jura? Or did he causefollowers? These are the questions that the Bernese province police askthemselves. Indeed in the night of Wednesday to Thursday, August 24 to 25,2005, three cows were wounded in Elay in the province of Soleure where thesadist has already prevailed.The three bovines underwent serious mutilations on the legs while they werein a pasture herd. In a close village, Bellelay, it was a horse that was wounded.These deaths were also near the triangle formed by the Basle-Countryside, apart of Argovie and Soleure province where the sadist zoophile usuallyprevails. Is it the same individual? You would think he sees the net beingtightened around him and seek another hunting ground, less supervised andcontrolled, since patrols of inhabitants and farmers regularly patrol at night theways and pastures.According to Swiss media, the investigators still do not have tangible evidencethat would allow the arrest of the sadist whose misdeeds worry thepopulations more and more. A unit of police officers called Zaun was createdunder the aegis of the legal settlement of the police force of the North-West toput an end to the intrigues of the torturer who prevails since the end of May2005 for three months now. Police have communicated very little about theseworrying cases.\" August 26, 2005\"Ass mutilated and killed close to the village of CouvetAn ass was found dead on Tuesday (August 23, 2005) in a pasture towardsCouvet in the canton (province) of Neuchatel.

The first cases ofmutilations in the Jurassic Arc had been announced at the beginning of theweek. Three cows had been mutilated in Elay, very close to the border withthe province of Soleure, and a wounded horse in Bellelay. The maltreatmentsof animals have accumulated over fourteen weeks.

The reward for information leading to the arrest of the perpetrator is26,000 franks ($26,831.49).\" September 9, 2005\"Police clueless on animal sadism Sunday Herald Sun, Australia,September 11, 2005:Swiss police admit they have few clues about a wave of sadistic attacks onfarm animals after the gruesome discovery of the carcass of yet anothervictim, a cow whose udder was cut off.The carcass found on Friday, September 9, in a meadow at August am Albis,near Zurich, brings to at least 47 the number of cases involving cattle, horses,sheep, rabbits and cats tortured to death in rural areas in the past four months.Another pregnant cow whose udder had been mutilated was put down earlierin the week.Police, who have been at pains to avoid dramatizing the incidents for fear ofencouraging copycats, are attempting to establish if the Zurich case is linkedwith a series of attacks in nearby districts near the German border.Authorities fear the perpetrators could be dangerous because of the extremecruelty inflicted on the animals; their genitals or mammary organs are oftensurgically excised. The victims either died or had to be put down and somebore traces of bestiality, or sexual assault.The head of a task force involving three district police forces told a Swissnewspaper on Saturday that the attacks were almost certainly committed by anumber of sadists. \"(But) we don't have a shadow of a trace (of the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"offenders), unfortunately,\" investigator Beat Krattiger told Blick newspaper.He said police were following up 360 lines of inquiry and had logged 8,000hours on the investigation. The district of Basel has been hardest hit, with 24cases reported, followed by 12 in neighboring Aargau and 10 in Solothern.One prison psychologist has pointed out that cruelty to animals is a commoncharacteristic of psychopaths.

The scene was toodifficult for Rosie Elmore to take in. \"I didn't get close to it, but my husband did. I knew itwas bad,\" she said as she recalled the incident recently. Neither the Elmores nor their neighbors heard any unusual noises the night the 15-poundWest Highland terrier they called Noel was killed. But a few months ago Lee Beth Deverand her husband, Michael Dever, were awakened by a dog barking somewhere in theirneighborhood. The barking soon turned into a blood-curdling wail. \"It was the mostGod-awful wailing, crying and screaming,\" Lee Beth Dever said. \"It was so disturbing thatat the time we actually thought, 'Gosh, someone is beating their dog.'\" A mystery Several residents who live in the area of Alvamar Golf Course and Country Club and inneighborhoods just north of Bishop Seabury Academy think some type of animal isattacking and killing small dogs and cats that have been left outside overnight. It's beengoing on for several months, they said. At least three dogs have died under mysterious circumstances, including the Elmores' dog.Neighbors also said cats have disappeared or been found dead. \"We've been bringing ourcats in at night,\" said Susan Stuever, who has found small animal remains during morningwalks in her neighborhood and around Alvamar. \"My dogs will pick stuff up when we'reout walking and you can tell it's the leftovers of something,\" she said. The most common theory among the neighbors is that a mountain lion or a bobcat is theculprit. \"I think there needs to be some sort of evaluation of the wildlife in thisneighborhood,\" Dever said. The Elmores notified police and animal control officers aboutthe death of their dog. It is the only such incident in that area reported to them, policespokesman Sgt. Dan Ward said. Police and animal control do not handle wild animals andrefer such incidents to the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks.\" The article speculates about possible culprits ranging from coyotes to bobcats, but to datethere is not a definite answer to what is killing and cutting up dogs and cats in Lawrence,Kansas.
