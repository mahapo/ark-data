October 11, 2005, image of Saturn's icy moon, Dione, above the planet's thin rings. Behind Dione are theshadowsof Saturn's B and C rings. Image from the Cassini spacecraft at 24,200 miles (39,000 kilometers)distance. Image courtesy NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute. October 19, 2005 Pasadena, California - NASA reports that \"speeding toward pale, icyDione, Cassini's view is enriched by the tranquil gold and blue hues of Saturn in thedistance. The horizontal stripes near the bottom of the image are Saturn's rings. Thespacecraft was nearly in the plane of the rings when the images were taken, thinning themby perspective and masking their awesome scale. The thin, curving shadows of the C ringand part of the B ring adorn the northern latitudes visible here, a reminder of the rings'grandeur.\"It is notable that Dione, like most of the other icy Saturnian satellites, appears in grey tonesno differently in natural color than in monochrome images.This new Cassini image was taken on October 11, 2005, with blue, green and infrared(centered at 752 nanometers) spectral filters were used to create this color view, whichapproximates the scene as it would appear to the human eye. The image was obtained withthe Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera at a distance of approximately 39,000 kilometers(24,200 miles) from Dione and at a Sun-Dione-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 22 degrees.The image scale is about 2 kilometers (1 mile) per pixel."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Close-up view of surface terrain of Saturn's moon, Dione, within a 37-miles wide (60 kilometers)crater along a feature called Padua Linea. Image courtesy NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute.NASA: \"The Cassini spacecraft continues to prove that the closer the view of the myriadworlds constituting the Saturn system, the more interesting and varied the views become.This close-up view of icy Dione reveals a wonderful variety of surface features that aresimultaneously familiar and unlike any other place in the solar system.\"The terrain in this image is located within a 60-kilometer-wide (37-mile) impact crateralong the feature called Padua Linea. The western rim of the encompassing crater runsfrom the middle left to the upper right. The crater's central peak can be seen at the lowerright.\"Multiple generations of fractures are visible here. Numerous fine, roughly parallel lineargrooves run across the terrain from top to bottom and are interrupted by the larger,irregular bright fractures. In several places, fractures postdate some deposits in the bottomsof craters that are not badly degraded by time. Such a fracture, for example, runs from thecenter toward the upper right.\"Most of the craters seen here have bright walls and dark deposits of material on theirfloors. As on other Saturnian moons, rock slides on Dione may reveal cleaner ice, whilethe darker materials accumulate in areas of lower topography and lower slope (e.g. craterfloors and the bases of scarps).\"This clear-filter image was taken using the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera onOctober 11, 2005, during Cassini's close targeted flyby of Dione. The image was acquiredfrom a distance of 4,486 kilometers (2,787 miles) from Dione and at a Sun-Dione-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 10 degrees. The image scale is 23 meters (75 feet) per pixel.This view is centered on terrain near 11 degrees south latitude, 238 degrees west longitude.\"The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European SpaceAgency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of theCalifornia Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's ScienceMission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameraswere designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based atthe Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado.\"Websites: http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov http://ciclops.orgCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"earthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
