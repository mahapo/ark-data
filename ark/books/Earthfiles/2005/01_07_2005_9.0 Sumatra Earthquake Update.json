The tsunami of a trillion cubic metersof water swamped beaches, including Phuket and the Nicobar and Andaman Islands northwest of Banda Aceh.Yet animals and natives on those nearby islands apparently got to higher ground to survive. January 7, 2005 Pasadena, California - The 9.0 Indian Ocean earthquake that hitSumatra, Indonesia, at 8 o'clock Christmas morning was caused by big rocky plates movingover each other more than five miles down at the bottom of the Indian Ocean. Those bigchunks of rock were at least 500 kilometers by 150 kilometers wide. That is 311 miles by93 miles. The Burma Plate slid fifty feet closer to India. Normally the Indian plate hasmoved only 2.4 inches a year.When hundreds of miles of the Earth's rocky plates move against each other like that, theplanet changes shape slightly. That provoked some scientists to calculate what might havehappened to the Earth's spin rate. That huge change in rock position also moved a trillioncubic meters of water outward from the epicenter southeast of Banda Aceh, creating atsunami that swamped beaches from Sumatra to Thailand, Burma, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka,India, the Maldives, Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania. So far, the death toll is over 160,000(as of 1/8/05), with thousands more missing. According to the U. S. State Department, atleast 4,000 Americans have not yet been located. (As this Earthfiles is posted, thegovernment is revising the number down to 2,500.)But on islands and land not far from the gigantic earthquake's epicenter, animals survived -and even some tribesmen on the remote Andaman and Nicobar Islands where severalthousand others died. The Scotsman National Newspaper reported January 5, 2005, thatwhen an East Indian coast guard helicopter flew low over Sentinel Island in the Andamanand Nicobar region, tribesmen attacked with bows and arrows. What did the surviving"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"animals and those extremely isolated natives feel, hear or see that made them move tohigher ground before the mass of water rolled in?This week I talked with several scientists about what might have happened to the Earth'sspin, why the massive but deep Indian Ocean rock slip created such a huge tsunami, andwhat animals might sense that people don't. First, the Earth's spin calculation and analysisof how much rock and water were moved has been done at the United States GeologicalSurvey. Seismologist Lucy Jones, Ph.D., heads the USGS office for Southern Californiawhere earthquakes are a constant worry. I asked Dr. Jones to explain why the Sumatraearthquake could affect our planet's spin rate?Above: Banda Aceh Shore, Sumatra, Indonesia, before December 26, 2004.Below: Same shore after 9.0 earthquake and tsunami hit 8.0 AM,December 26, 2004. Images © Digital Globe.Interview:Lucy Jones, Ph.D., Seismologist-In-Charge, U. S. Geological Survey in SouthernCalifornia, Pasadena, California: \"When earthquakes happen, they don't happen at anepicenter. They happen over a fault surface. And it's one block of rock moving up andacross another block of rock that releases shaking as one of its effects. In fact, it's a lot likesnapping your fingers. When you snap your fingers, you have two surfaces in frictionalcontact. Because of the friction pushing them together, they don't slip sideways until youpush hard enough you overcome friction. You slip suddenly and release energy in the formof a sound wave. The same thing goes on in an earthquake, except now instead of fingers,we have two big blocks of the Earth's crust. One of them moving over the other one. Andevery point on that surface where they come together releases energy, the shaking.The bigger that area is, the bigger the earthquake because you have more spots releasingenergy. To be a magnitude 9, it needs to be a very large fault. The first reports weresuggesting like 1,000 kilometers. Some of the modeling going on now, maybe it's about 500kilometers long and about 150 kilometers wide. That big block of rock moved an averageof about 10 to 15 meters during the earthquake.WOULD YOU CLARIFY IF I UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY THAT IT WAS THEINDIAN OCEAN PLATE THAT SLID UNDERNEATH THE BURMA PLATE?Yes, that's correct. The Indian Ocean plate went underneath the Burma plate. Burma roseup and over the Indian plate and moved something like 10 to 15 meters, 30 to 45 feet,closer to India than it was before. Now, that's a pretty big mass that's moving around"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"because it's over 500 kilometers long. That's a pretty big chunk of real estate not comparedto the whole Earth, but even there, you start to notice it. 9.0 Earthquake Changed Earth's Shape- and Perhaps Earth's Spin Rate?So people began speculating about how it might have effected the Earth's spin. The Earthspinning around is just gravitational forces and if you really change the shape of the Earth,you're going to change the way in which its rotating. You don't change the shape verymuch compared to the whole Earth, but you do a little bit. Some calculations were madeand it came out to be a couple of microseconds change in the length of the day.SO IT GOT LONGER, MEANING THAT THE EARTH SLOWED DOWN A TINY BIT?No, I think it got faster. But it's two microseconds out of a whole day. One millionth of asecond. So, it's not something that's actually been detected. It's something that peopletheoretically thought could happen and that was a calculation of what it should be giventhe redistribution of mass. The mass of rock changed its position on the sphere of theEarth.IF SOMETHING LIKE THIS 9.0 WHERE THESE TWO PLATES INTERACTED OVERSUCH A LARGE AREA COULD AFFECT THE SPIN OF THE EARTH, COULD ITHAVE IMPACTED THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH WHERE WE THINK THE IRONCORE HAS IMPACT ON OUR MAGNETIC FIELDS?We would not expect it to have an impact because that's at the center of the Earth. Themass shift all happened out at the surface and it should not have had any affect on the coreof the Earth. Other Seismic Activity Before and After 9.0 Sumatra QuakeIS THERE ANY RESEARCH NOW GOING ON TO DETERMINE IF THERE HAVEBEEN OTHER AREAS OF THE PLANET OR LET'S SAY, THE RING OF THE FIRE,THAT MAY HAVE BEEN JARRED LOOSE AND THIS BIG 9.0 MIGHT SET OFF INTHE FORESEEABLE FUTURE BECAUSE SO MUCH ROCK WAS MOVED?OK, it's a reasonable concept to see if you might get some triggered earthquakes within adistance of 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) or 2,000 kilometers (1,243 miles). On a globalscale, we have never seen global changes in earthquake rates because of a big earthquake,even in the 9.5 the much bigger earthquake that happened back in 1960 in Chile.On a closer scale, it's possible. I know there was an earthquake in Myanmar, Burma, just afew days after this big earthquake, undoubtedly triggered by the big 9.0. Anotherinteresting phenomenon was that three days before this earthquake, there was a magnitude8 down on the boundary south of New Zealand, on the edge of the Indian Ocean plate.There's been some discussion about whether that would have triggered the magnitude. 9 orwhether there is any relationship. At this point, there is not enough data to say yes or no.One just says, 'Isn't that interesting.'There are calculations that have been made to look at how the stress changed in that area.For instance, there is a great Sumatra fault that runs down through the islands of Sumatrathat might be closer to having an earthquake now than before this other event. Our bigproblem is that we can always say that the stress change would have put it closer to anearthquake, but since we don't know how long it was going to be until the next earthquakeanyway, that doesn't tell us when the earthquake will happen. That's always one of ourlimitations. Earthquakes are basically a chaotic process. We could look at some shifts andit still doesn't give us a confident pattern.IS IT TRUE THAT SOME CHINESE SEISMOLOGISTS HAD BEEN REPORTINGWITHIN THE LAST FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS AN INCREASE IN LARGEREARTHQUAKE ACTIVITY AND SWARMS IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE?I have not heard anything like that. The Chinese don't run a network in the SouthernHemisphere. So, I don't know. That might be related to this idea there was this 8 downnear Antarctica that happened just a few days before the 9. But I haven't heard anythingover a longer time scale.YOU HEAD THAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SEISMIC OFFICE AND YOU HADNOT HEARD ABOUT ANY INCREASED SEISMIC ACTIVITY IN THE SOUTHERN"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"HEMISPHERE?No.PRIOR TO DECEMBER 26, 2004?No. Tsunami Size Relates to Size of RockDisplacement in Undersea EarthquakeI WONDER IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN FOR LISTENERS THE RELATIONSHIPBETWEEN THE SIZE OF THE ROCK THAT MOVES AND THE WAVES AS THEYOCCUR IN THE OCEAN THAT CREATES THE TSUNAMIS?What happens is that when you move that block of rock. We might have 500 by 150kilometers and it moves over 20 meters it also moves up a certain amount and it displacesa piece, a section, of water. We did a bit of a calculation as to how much water wasdisplaced and it's almost 1 trillion cubic meters, which is so large it's difficult tocomprehend. That's equal to about 20 times the volume of the Great Salt Lake (Utah) that's the amount of water that got moved by the motion of this fault on the Indian Oceanbottom.So when the fault moved on the ocean bottom and it moves the floor of the ocean, thatwater twenty times the Great Salt Lake had to go somewhere else. And that's what movedout as the tsunami. So it's not a wave in the same sense as a seismic wave or a sound wave.It's a big piece of water that's been displaced and swashes out and then it vibrates back andforth a bit.SO ESSENTIALLY, THEN, THAT BIG DISPLACEMENT OF WATER AS IT MOVES ISDEEPER AND DEEPER AS IT APPROACHES THE COASTLINE.It's a big piece of water that moves out and as the coast line gets more shallow, you get amassing up of the water. Even a big tsunami when it passes by a big ship out in the deepocean often won't even be noticeable. It's when it interacts with the coastline that you getthe really large affect.BECAUSE A TSUNAMI IS NOT A BREAKING WAVE; IT'S AN EXPANDING,MOVING RAPIDLY, BLOCK OF WATER.Yes, it's a big wedge of water that used to be at the ocean floor and now there's a piece ofrock where it used to be and it has to go somewhere else. When you look at Indonesiawhere the earthquake happened, the tsunami also rolled over there. That's where most ofthe deaths would be. And we should not forget that they had a magnitude 9.0 earthquake.Probably a lot of the damage in Indonesia came directly from the earthquake rather thanthe tsunami. Then the tsunami would have been arriving very soon thereafter becausethat's close to where it was generated (5.5 miles below Sumatra). Maybe five, ten, twenty,thirty minutes to hit all the places along Indonesia. I heard then 1.5 hours up to Thailandand longer periods as you go further away.NO ONE WAS AWARE OF ANY EARTHQUAKE, SEISMIC ACTIVITY. IT ALLSEEMED SUDDENLY TO BE THE WATER RISING THAT SUNDAY MORNING.It does sound like in Thailand people felt the earthquake, but it would have been early inthe morning. A lot of people would have been asleep. When you are a long way from anearthquake, all the sharp motions have already died off and you're left with more of arolling motion. Then it's more likely that people sleep through that. Seismologist Surprised by IndonesianTsunami's Vast DevastationAS A PERSON WHO IS AN EXPERT IN SEISMOLOGY, WHAT HAS SURPRISEDYOU THE MOST ABOUT THIS EVENT?I guess I was surprised at the way the tsunami really wrapped around islands and struck inareas I would have thought would be sheltered. I study earthquakes more than tsunamis, soI wasn't aware of that.RIGHT. I THINK IT WAS ALSO THE BBC REPORTER WHO SAID IT WAS"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"SHOCKING TO FLY AND REALIZE THAT THE WATER HAD EXTENDED FORNEARLY TWO KILOMETERS INLAND IN SOME PLACES TAKING EVERYTHINGWITH IT. THOSE ARE THE BARE, ALMOST MOONSCAPE LOOKS.I think the worst devastation was in places where the tsunami came in on top of theearthquake. The earthquake had already shaken the buildings down and made it mucheasier to carry away.YOU THINK THAT HAPPENED MORE LIKELY IN WHICH AREA?That's Indonesia because along the whole coast of Sumatra, that's where the fault is. Theywere on top of the magnitude 9.0 The ground was shaking at a very high level for fiveminutes.THAT'S BASED ON YOUR MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGY?Yes, we can see those waves they proceeded out around the world, set off all our sensorshere across America as well as everywhere else in the world.AND IT LASTED FOR FIVE FULL MINUTES.Ye s .I SEE FROM THE SCIENCE POINT OF VIEW THAT BUILDINGS IN INDONESIAAND ON THE ISLANDS WOULD HAVE BEEN RATTLED ROYALLY THROUGHTHOSE FIVE MINUTES.Right.AND THE TSUNAMI THAT HAS OVERWHELMED THE NEWS THAT CAME ANHOUR TO TWO HOURS LATER...Well, the tsunami in Indonesia the places that had the shaking also had the tsunami rightaway.I SEE, BECAUSE...Because it would have been close by. So, they are shaken for five minutes, the buildingsfall down and then five or ten minutes later, in comes the tsunami and washes away therubble. It's not surprising in that level of devastation you have to build very strongbuildings to not fall down in that sort of situation.IT WOULD ALSO EXPLAIN HOW THE TSUNAMI COULD TAKE BACK OUT TOSEA SO MUCH RUBBLE LEAVING THE VAST MOONSCAPES.Yes, it was not pulling down the whole building. It was picking up rubble that had alreadybeen shaken down. American East Coast - Tsunami Danger? (More about Canary Islandvolcano in future Earthfiles.)WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS COUNTRY COULD DO IF THERE WAS A TSUNAMIWARNING ON THE EAST COAST TO MOVE SO MANY PEOPLE?You don't need to move people very far. You've got to get people not to be on the beach.One simple thing that should be done is to educate children in school: If you are on thebeach and either feel an earthquake or the water starts behaving oddly, go for high ground.People died because they went to look at the waves instead of moving away from them.HUMAN CURIOSITY.Yeah. I've seen a horrible set of pictures from there where people had all run down to thesea wall to see the waves and then a horrid sequence of pictures as the wave came up overthe sea wall.. Tsunamis happen so infrequently in the lives of most people that people justdon't think about do we need to educate people about what to do in a tsunami. I think thatis probably the most important thing: if the water is behaving oddly, go away from thebeach. Most Animals Survived the Indonesian TsunamiWildlife officials in Sri Lanka reported their surprise that they did not find many dead"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"animals, even where so many humans had lost their lives. An Associated Pressphotographer who flew over Sri Lanka's Yala National Park in a helicopters said he sawlots of elephants, buffalo and deer, but no dead animals. Yet floodwaters from the tsunamiuprooted trees in the park, knocked cars over and killed at least 29,000 people. How didthe animals escape?In the United States at the University of California-Davis's School of Veterinary Medicine,animal behavior professors Benjamin and Lynette Hart, husband and wife, have doneresearch projects that give insight about animal survival in the face of huge seismic events.First, Dr. Benjamin Hart did a study for the U. S. Geological Survey to see if unusualanimal behavior in seismically active California regions might be a reliable early warningsystem. The answer was no because animal behavior before earthquakes was notconsistent which might relate to differences in quake intensities. However, Dr. Hartdescribed for me what might be happening when many animals do react before seismicevents such as Indonesia's.Benjamin Hart, D.V.M. and Ph.D., Professor of Physiology and Behavior, Universityof California Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Anatomy,Physiology and Cell Biology, Davis, California: \"In many cases, we had three to fourhours, or even ten hours, prior to earthquakes in which unusual animal behavior wasreported. And when we talked with our geophysical colleagues about what animals couldbe responding to if it is not the foreshocks, it could be when the plates rub against eachother. Then they produce subsonic emissions. Those can travel a long ways, subsonicvibrations can travel quite far. Animals can pick that up. They might also produceelectrostatically charged particles that maybe animals can pick up on. There is release ofradon gas in some instances. So, those are examples of the kind of stimuli that animalscould be perceiving. Of course, we don't have any idea which one it would be.THE 9.0 LEVEL OF THE SUMATRA AND INDIAN PLATE COMING TOGETHER,THAT MIGHT BE LARGE ENOUGH TO SET OFF THE SUBSONIC FREQUENCIESTHAT MAYBE ELEPHANTS AND OTHER ANIMALS IN THE ISLANDSRESPONDED TO?Oh, that's exactly right. So if you get 9.0, it's logical to me at least, an earthquake of thatmagnitude, prior to the earthquake, the stress on the plates is going to be much greaterthan a magnitude. 6.0 would be. It's the stress, the plates coming against each other andpushing that produces the precursor stimuli. It's logical to think the precursor stimuli willbe stronger.One of the things we learned on our study is that the behavior of the animals, irrespectiveof species, is not bizarre or abnormal. It's normal behavior to a frightening stimulus. Theprecursor would be a frightening stimulus for which there is no explanation. That's whatthey do. For many animals, it's fleeing to escape. Some it's freezing (in place). Some it'swhat instincts say it needs to go for protection. If it's elephants, it's 'Let's move out ofhere!'\" Do Elephants Perceive Subsonic Frequencies?The intelligence and highly sensitive nature of elephants has intrigued Dr. Lynette Hart,who is Professor of Animal Behavior and Human Animal Interaction in the Department ofPopulation Health and Reproduction at the UC-Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. Shehas studied the way elephants vocalize through the air. Not only can elephants trumpetloudly and run quickly, Dr. Hart thinks the animals perceive sound frequencies fromseismic events that humans cannot hear frequencies that are subsonic.Lynette Hart, Ph.D., Professor of Animal Behavior and Human Animal Interaction,Department of Population Health and Reproduction, School of Veterinary Medicine,Davis, California: \"One of the questions that we have pursued is the fact that such a largesound as an elephant makes when it vocalizes is going to also create a seismic wave in theEarth. A question that we are very interested in is to what extent are elephants cueing onseismic propagation on things that are going on in the Earth, in addition to acousticresponses propagated through the air.SO, A RESPONSE THAT MIGHT COME FROM AN ELEPHANT AT A LONGDISTANCE AND ELEPHANTS MAY HAVE WIRED IN THEIR PHYSIOGNOMY ANDTHEIR BRAIN THE ABILITY TO PICK UP SUBSONIC FREQUENCIES.That's right. They might be able to integrate both information they would receive throughthe Earth and information they would receive through the air. By combining thatinformation, might be able to make a better judgment about the direction of the sound orthe intensity of it or how far away the source of the sound would be."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"WOULD THE ELEPHANTS BE PERCEIVING THE SUBSONIC FREQUENCIESTHROUGH THEIR FEET?This is one question their feet, they have large fat pads on the surfaces. The bottom of anelephant's foot feels quite a bit like a water bed if you push on it. So it makes a very goodcompact seal with the Earth. In work that's still unpublished, we have started looking at theanatomy of the foot and we see that there are some fine pressure receptors in the foot. It'salso been published by Beth Rathmussen that the trunk has extensive pressure receptors init, so they have the capability of resting the trunk on the ground and they would be able tofeel vibrations on the Earth.If you think about this 9.0 earthquake which is really off the scale of usual earthquakes itwould create a huge seismic wave that will go a vast distance.AND THAT THE ANIMALS WOULD HAVE ESCAPED BEFORE THE TSUNAMIS HITBECAUSE THEY MIGHT HAVE PICKED UP ON THOSE FREQUENCIES FROMSUCH A LARGE ROCK SLIP.Exactly.\"Sunday January 2, 2005, 11:30 AM, An elephant works to find tsunami victims in Takuapa,about 130 km (81 miles) north of the Thai resort island of Phuket, January 2, 2005.
