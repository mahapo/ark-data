July 22, 2005 Jakarta, Indonesia - The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmedthis week: \"The Ministry of Health in Indonesia reported that a 38-year-old father whodied on 12 July was the country's first laboratory-confirmed H5N1 positive human case ofavian influenza. His two daughters also died of severe pneumonia illness compatible withH5N1 infection, but laboratory confirmation is not yet available. Limited samples wereavailable from the 8-year-old daughter who died on 14 July, and the 1-year-old daughterwho died on 9 July.\" H5N1 Virus Found in Frozen Duck Meat from China The journal Vi rol ogy and WHO also confirm H5N1 bird flu virus was found in processedfrozen duck meat shipped from China to Japan in 2003. This is not the first time the deadlyvirus has been found in processed meat. The implication from this new study is that thedeadly virus was in China birds when the ducks were processed. \"This is an indicator that H5N1 viruses are widespread in Asia in many different kinds offowl,\" said WHO's Western Pacific Region spokesman, Bob Dietz. A Hong Kong scientistalso reports that the 1,000 geese that died in Qinghai province this year apparentlycontracted the H5N1 virus from poultry. In the past two years, 57 people in Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia have diedfrom the H5N1 avian flu virus. As the cases rise in Southeast Asia, virologists and othermedical experts worry that the lethal virus will mutate to transmit more efficiently fromhuman-to-human. If that happens, the next world pandemic might be upon us. More Lethal H5N1 Bird Flu Strain in China? This week, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science reported that the viruscirculating in some of the bird population is becoming less lethal to birds. That createsanother problem: more and larger virus pool in more surviving chickens, ducks, geese andother birds. That means that more migrating birds could carry the virus outside SoutheastAsia. However, in China the Wenhuibao newspaper and World Health Organization reported inJune that the H5N1 virus in migratory birds there might be more lethal than previousstrains. Chinese scientists reported in the journal, Science, that gene sequencing from someof the 6,000 birds that have died of bird blue in Qinghai province indicated those bird flustrains were more lethal than strains in previous outbreaks. Gao Fu, Director of theChinese Academy of Science's Microbiology Research Institute reports: \"The results showthat this new strain of H5N1 is very harmful. The deadliness of the virus far exceeds that"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"of the virus strains previously found in water fowl in northern China.\" In the China lab tests, the H5N1 viral strain under study killed chickens within 20 hoursand mice within three days. WHO spokesman, Roy Wadia, said, \"It would seem to indicatewhat we've known all along, that this is a highly pathogenic strain that has killed manywild birds, so it's not surprising that it would kill mice.\"Websites:W.H.O.
