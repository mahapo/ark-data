It all began with the publication of my book, Situation Red, The UFO Siege(Doubleday, 1977) in which I made references to reported crashes of UFOs and therecovered alien bodies. In surprising response, information relative to 'retrievals'surfaced from new sources. This led me to July 29, 1978, the day I stepped up to thelectern as guest speaker at the MUFON ninth annual Symposium in Dayton, Ohio, todeliver my paper, 'Retrievals of the Third Kind,' pointedly subtitled, 'A Case Study"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody.' Since Dayton, new informants continue to emerge. People, like my earlier firsthandcontacts, who want no open, active part in UFO research. Independent from eachother, they ever so cautiously share sensitive information about their alleged roles ina retrieval operation. Or they claim to have been in an authoritative position to haveseen the deceased humanoid entities under a variety of 'need to know'circumstances. One of my most enduring and informative contacts is medical.Others formerly served in the C.I.A. and in key positions of the military. Indeed, theknowledge I have gained since my book from diverse, credible sources isextraordinary. It is beyond the scope of this paper to review all the behind-the-scene events prior toand since the Dayton affair. However, I hasten to say that what began as a simpleresearch report, featuring an update on alleged or legendary retrievals of crashedsaucers and little men, soon gave way to a venture into seeming fantasy. The more Iprobed into old and new leads, the deeper I became enmeshed in an inconsistentworld of real people on one end; on the other, the unreal tales they told. Just as unreal, or so it seems, were some of my own experiences during theseprobes. One, no longer a hushed incident, was my close encounter with a 'phantom'force at the Dayton symposium. There, before going on stage, my life was twicethreatened. On both occasions word came through an intermediary, once by phoneat 4:30 a.m. on July 29, 1978; the other by physical confrontation just momentsbefore my address that day. Uninformed of the threats, I spoke for nearly two hours.However, the moment I finished, I was suddenly whisked off stage by three armedplainclothesmen with walkie talkies, escorted to the Stouffer Hotel, where I held aprearranged press conference, then again escorted to my room which was in theprocess of being changed with a lady tenant on the far end of the hotel - an order notplaced by me. I was advised not to reveal my new room number to anyone and notto leave its premises. In effect, until dinnertime, I was detained incommunicado. Imissed everyone I had arranged to see, including a medical person with information. A real threat? Or a scare tactic? To this day, it is unclear if I was being protectedfrom a lunatic adversary, or if the whole episode was a ploy to deflect potentialinformants in the audience from reaching me. I had indications beforehand whilepreparing my 'Retrieval\" paper that someone connected with the C.I.A. wasconcerned about some of my sensitive material and how far I might go with it. Headvised that the use of some data in my possession could be risky and for my ownsafety, I 'should always stay in crowds.' Months later, the same C.I.A. employee,who had been helpful in many ways, said he had the answer for the threats inDayton. Investigation, he said, showed that it was all a part of the shenanigans of amovie studio who possessed secret documents and film about the retrieved craft andentities. Fearing that I would steal their thunder before their release date, they triedto intimidate me into canceling my talk. Whatever the intent of my would-be-assailant or of the Intelligence Community, myrole and objectives in research have since changed. to me, the key to truth lies inwhat we may call the UFO crash/retrieval syndrome. Lights in the sky, closeencounters of all kinds, and even the grotesquerie of abduction cases have all lostpriority. Time, with its influx of new data from new and old reliable sources, nowaffirms my belief that beyond my fingertips - and perhaps forever unreachable - isthe evidence extraordinaire: the alien cadavers and the craft. In my opinion, if all theofficially suppressed information were released suddenly in one package, it couldhave an unpredictable psychological but profound philosophical impact on mankind.But no matter how it would be released, I also believe that the human mind has beenso conditioned to stress since World War II that a worldwide Wellesian panic is notlikely. For the record, no one in UFO research, the media or the scientific community hasbeen privy to share certain portions of my cumulative data. thus, theyunderstandably remain skeptical. The whole story of my experience in this endeavormay never be told, mainly because of the sensitivity of some of the names, placesand subject matter. To stress a point in summary: I know firsthand that my continuedquest for UFO crash/retrieval information is a venture that can be as risky andfrustrating as it is rewarding. Through patience, keeping confidences, and playing the game in a posture of lowprofile, I feel at this writing that I have progressed substantially since my first paperin gathering new, vital and corroborative information. Unlike my first paper, this onedraws principally on information collected from firsthand sources."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Status Report II will not attempt to correct a number of errors that appeared in myfirst paper. However, it is important for the record that exceptions should be maderelative to three of the original Abstracts:- In Abstract #1, the year of the incident should be corrected to read 1950, not 1948.Other amended data concerning this case I understand will be revealed byresearcher, Todd Zechel, through other media.- In Abstract #8, the retrieval incident dated 1973 should be corrected to read 1953.- In Abstract #21, Seymour-Johnson, a Navy Training Station, should be corrected toread: Seymour-Johnson Air Force Base, located in Goldsboro, North Carolina, notNorfolk, Virginia. My goal in this phase of research is to obtain information from the firsthand source.Such prime material used in this monograph is specified as Class 'A,' and is recordedas Cases A-1 through A-10 in the text. New leads, or other pertinent material, arepresented as Class 'B,' which are recorded as Items B-1 through B-14. It should be noted that many abstracts appearing in my first paper, 'Retrievals of thethird Kind,' are of the Class B type and are not included for review in thismonograph. CASE A-1 During the summer of 1977, I was asked by a local business executive, a former U.S. Naval Intelligence Officer, to speak on the UFO at the September 1st meeting ofthe Cincinnati Chapter of the World Wings held in the Administration Building ofCincinnati's Lunken Airport. During the question and answer period following mytalk, one member of a group of 25 pilots arose and brought up the legendary subjectof recovered alien UFOs and occupants. His comment, I thought, indicated that hewas unusually well-informed on the matter. So I asked that he stand by for a chatlater. When the crowd finally disassembled, he led me to the privacy of a back roomwhich was dominated by a huge topographical map of the United States. Staring at the map he said bluntly, 'I have seen the bodies.' Still looking at the mapand noting my protracted silence, he pointed vaguely to an area inside the state ofArizona. 'There's approximately where the saucer crashed,' he said. 'It was in adesert area, but I don't know the exact location. I'm almost positive it happened in1953.' The pilot was my first encounter with a firsthand witness. As he stood at the mapwith a straight-on glance, he impressed me as a person who is sincere and forthright,possessing a no-nonsense character. 'I saw the bodies at Wright-Patterson,' he said. 'Iwas in the right place at the right time when the crates arrived at night by DC-7.' As we lingered at the map, he recalled that he had stood inside a hangar at adistance of about 12 feet, peering at five crates on a forklift. In his judgment, thecrates appeared to be hastily constructed and were made of wood. In three of these,little humanoids appearing to be 4 feet tall were lying unshrouded on a fabric, whichhe explained prevented freeze burn from the dry ice packed beneath. As a numberof Air Police stood silent guard near the crates, he managed to get a reasonably goodbut brief glimpse of the humanoid features. He recalls that their heads were hairlessand narrow. By human standards, the heads were disproportionately large with skinthat looked brown under the hangar lights above. The eyes seemed to be open. Themouth small and nose, if any, was indistinct. The arms were positioned downalongside their bodies. But the hands and feet, he said, were indistinct. When askedabout their attire, he said they appeared to be wearing tight-fitting dark suits.Because of the tight-fitting suit, there was one revealing feature - a surprisingfeature. One of the humanoids appeared to him to be female. He said, 'Either one ofthe aliens had an exceedingly muscular chest or the bumps were a female's breasts.'Later, he learned from one of the crew members with whom he bunked at thebarracks that the body of one of the aliens was believed to be that of a female. My informant also heard from the crew member that one of the entities was stillalive aboard the craft when the United States military team arrived. Attempts weremade to save its life with oxygen, but they were unsuccessful. Another issue, an important one: How was the military able to track the crash? Saidmy informant: The crew member told him that the UFO was picked up by specialtracking equipment at Mt. Palomar in California. My informant claimed that he hadlater heard a report that the retrieved craft, found intact, was also sent to Wright-Patterson. He had no more details as to when or by what means."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"COMMENT: I have had a dozen or more private talks with my firsthand informant since ourinitial meeting as reported in Abstract #8 of my first paper. During this period, Iknew him as a dedicated family man and by occupation to be an engineer. He hadalso made several trips to Wright-Patterson for treatment of a medical disability.Without notice, in the Fall of 1978, he and his family moved away leaving noforwarding address. His military career was extensive, having served as WarrantOfficer in the Army during which time he was assigned to Wright-Patterson. My informant seemed well informed about the UFO, but had never desired toparticipate in open research to share his knowledge. In my opinion, he seemed to bekeenly aware and able to separate fact from rumor. Of the latter, he heard that aUFO (foo fighter) had been retrieved in England by the 8th Air Force during WorldWar II. Having a top security clearance, he claimed to have seen photos at Wright-Patterson of a retrieved UFO and a close-up showing strange glyphs on its bodywhich he described as looking like Sanskrit. He was also aware of the consequencesof talking too much about secret subjects and often referred to reprisals such asconfinement at a base in the U. S. which he dubbed the 'Turkey Farm.'[ Editor's Note: Sanskrit is a classical Indian language and the parent of theIndo-Aryan languages. Sanskrit is still used as literary and liturgical languageby about 200,000 people. ] In August 1978, I requested an affidavit or a tape describing his 1953 experience formy private records. He declined because of his oath of secrecy. I then asked for aposthumous statement. His response was that he would have to check with hisSecurity Officer. Belatedly he got the expected answer: 'You have seen nothing,heard nothing, and you sure as s--- can sign nothing!' That was the final word. According to my informant, plus the testimony of two secondhand witnessesdescribed in Abstracts #6 and #7 of my first paper, 1953 was either an active yearfor several UFO crashes; or all three were describing one event. All three describethe area of impact in a desert region and two named Arizona as the site.\"Continued in Part 2 - Case A-2, 1973, Non-human bodiesCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
