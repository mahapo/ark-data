ESA said, \"It apparently shows short, stubby drainagechannels leading to a shoreline.\" It was taken with the Descent Imager/SpectralRadiometer, one of two NASA instruments on the probe.The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European SpaceAgency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of theCalifornia Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission forNASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its twoonboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The DescentImager/Spectral team is based at the University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona.Huygens at Titan 2 - 8 Kilometers Above Titan's Surface.January 14, 2005"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Huygens raw image at 8 kilometers above Titan's surface.Credit: ESA/NASA/University of Arizona.Raw image returned by the European Space Agency's Huygens probe at 8 kilometers fromTitan's surface, with a resolution of 20 meters per pixel.
