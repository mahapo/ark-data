The series of status reports, I through VII,were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report IIIbegins at Earthfiles. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. For all theprevious status reports, see Earthfiles Archives. \"CASE A-2 Significant in this case is that the testimony from a secondhand source ofinformation was substantiated when I reached the firsthand source. To achieve thistook time and a stroke of strategy and luck in reaching the real source for acommitment. This case was first reported in Abstract # 16 of my previous paper(Status Report I) to be reprinted in upcoming Earthfiles, the erstwhile informantbeing the wife referred to as SI. In review, her information revealed to me in August1977 follows: The year was 1973 when Carl, a Sergeant and Air Policeman in the U. S. Air Force,was called to duty during the night. He was driven to a certain location, then wasblindfolded. She said he recalled that he was led across a field of wet grass and thenwas helped down a flight of stairs and escorted through a long corridor. At a certainpoint, he was halted and his blindfold removed. There, he was issued instructionsabout his mission and where to stand guard. To his shock, he was in a room withranking officers and plainclothes specialists who were viewing three small humanoidbodies. The aliens were dead and were stretched out on a table. She remembers Carltelling her that the bodies were about 3 feet tall, their heads abnormally large, andthey seemed to have short fuzz on the top of their heads. The skin, she said, was anoff-white or cream. She could recall no other facial features described by Carl,admitting that the only time Carl had talked about his experience was while theywere courting. That was in 1975. At that time, she said, he seemed shaken by it. 'I believe he was dramatically affected,' she said. 'One time he told his sister about itand she just laughed. Since then, he refuses to discuss the matter with anyone, evenme.' On several later occasions when I called Mrs. SI, I asked to speak to Carl. One nighthe was present, sitting at a table drinking coffee, when I called. I remember sheasked him if he would be willing to talk with me about his experience, but hedeclined. Said SI when she returned to the phone, 'He said he's not allowed to talkabout it and that he will tell everything he knows after President Carter makes anannouncement.' Because of her illness and SI's wish not to be involved in UFOs again, a long gap oftime elapsed before I chanced a call to check on her well being. Her health restoredand sounding cheerful, I then brought her up to date on my successes and failures in"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the pursuit of retrieval stories. But when I asked to speak to Carl, she reiterated hisreluctance to talk about his 1973 experience. 'He won't talk,' she said. 'He was tooemotionally affected.' Already knowing of Carl's place of employment and that his on-duty schedule wassubject to change, I asked her for the time of day he could be conveniently reached.I hinted that I might call him 'on a long shot.' She obliged, but offered noencouragement. On October 17, 1978, a well-timed call reached Carl at work during a coffee break.Without hesitation, I announced my purpose and cited some strong data from othersources relative to his experience and assured him that his name or identity wouldnever be disclosed. After a long silence, Carl reluctantly confirmed his experienceand described the scene he witnessed while on guard duty. While his informationgenerally agreed with that expressed by his wife, he also revealed that the facialcharacteristics of all three entities were similar and that the skin was the same coloras a 'drowned cadaver just brought out of the water.' When asked about his reaction to the event, he said in a low voice, 'I was shocked.I'd rather forget it.' He offered nothing more, nor did I want to press the issue. I feltthat I had achieved a real breakthrough. Carl was now a firsthand witness. COMMENT: My informant, Carl, had no information concerning the actual retrieval operation,but undoubtedly the recovered bodies came from a recent crash incident. I have noreason to question Carl's veracity. His behavioral reaction to my questions and voiceintonation told the truth. Carl does not want any part of active UFO research andprefers to be left alone and not bothered by the subject. When I later checked forconfirmation with an Intelligence source about the 1973 retrieval, I got, 'Nocomment.' CASE A-3 On June 29, 1978, my son-in-law, Jeffrey Sparks, then an Assistant Professor at St.Leo College, Dade City, Florida, informed me that he had talked with a person whohad witnessed the alien humanoids at Wright-Patterson AFB in 1966. According toJeff, his contact held a responsible position in a financial capacity with a private firmin Tampa, Florida, and had formerly served in Army Intelligence. He gave me theindividual's name and where he could be reached. On July 5, 1978, I talked with Mr. JK at length concerning his functions inIntelligence and what he had observed at Wright-Patterson AFB, plus many otheraspects of UFO crashes and retrieval operations. He also made reference to thecomputer bank, or 'dump file,' which contains secret information about UFOs datingback to 1948. JK, whose duties were connected with the Nike Missile, related to me the followingdata: - He observed nine deceased alien bodies preserved in deep freeze conditions underwell-lighted, thick glass enclosures. The bodies were short in stature, about 4 feet inheight. They appeared under lighting to be grayish color in skin tone. The areawhere the bodies were preserved was under heavy guard, inside and out. He wastold while viewing the subjects that 30 bodies were held in preservation at that timeat the air base. - He did not see firsthand the alien craft stored at Wright-Patterson AFB, but wastold that such craft were on the base. He was also told that an alien craft was held atLangley AFB, Virginia, and another at McDill AFB in Florida. - He knew of three key areas in the 1960s where certain secret UFO researchoperations were conducted other than at Wright-Patterson AFB. Bases cited wereLangley, Avon Bombing Range - a part of the McDill AFB complex near Sebring,Florida; and at Seymour-Johnson AFB in Goldsboro, North Carolina. - At certain military bases, highly trained mobilized units were in a constant 'ready'state for dispatch to any area in the U.S.A. to recover downed or crashed UFOs.These special forces at the time were known as the 'Blue Berets' which can operatesecretly and effectively by using diversionary tactics to prevent public interference.Such diversions include creating power blackouts."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" - During JK's tenure of service in the Vietnam crisis, five crashes of UFOs occurredbetween 1966-1968 in the Tri-State area of Ohio, Indiana (near Evansville) andKentucky. There was one known incident of a retrieval of three alien bodies. Duringthis alleged incident, there occurred a skirmish with the alien forces by our militaryunits. this was triggered by the uncertainty of the aliens' intent. Hostility waspresumed, said JK. The location or time of these incidents were not disclosed. - Said JK, 'Since 1948, secret information concerning UFO activity involving the U.S. military has been contained in a computer center at Wright-Patterson AFB. Atthis base, a master computer file is maintained with duplicate support backup filessecreted at other military installations.' JK also said, 'Get the complete 'dump file,'both the master and the support backup files, and you've got all the hidden UFOdata.' Thus, substantive UFO data are not available through the Freedom of InformationAct, nor on file at the National Archives in Washington, D. C. COMMENT: I have had a number of long talks with JK since July 1978, which was reported inAbstract # 21 of my first paper (Status Report I). Some additional information herelated concerning certain technical phases of his former work is not included hereon his request. One of our chats revealed that he was stationed at Wright-PattersonAFB when Barry Goldwater had visited the base hoping to get permission fromGeneral Curtis Lemay to see the UFO evidence stored there, but was denied. JKsaid, 'This refusal caused quite a fiasco on the base.' While visiting the University in Dade City, Florida, for a lecture in April 1979, I wasunable to meet JK, as arranged. However, I was surprised that following my talk,waiting to see me privately was a former member of the elite 'Blue Berets.' Iremembered JK had pointed out the functions of this covert service. The next day, CAM - the ex-'Blue Beret' - visited my daughter's home. Alone, wetalked about the elite force, its make-up and functions and some of his experiencesin Vietnam behind enemy lines. Although he had never participated in a UFOcrash/retrieval, he was aware that one of his fellow members had had theexperience. Details were scanty, but CAM recalls that his friend referred to hisparticipation in the recovery of a 'big head' from an alien craft. My last talk with JK was September 12, 1979, at which time he was doing well asproprietor of his own business. He reaffirmed as true all of his past claims. CASE A-4 My informant is self-employed after serving a long career with the U. S. Air Force,retiring with the rank of Major. He was a pilot as well as filling other specialassignments. During the mid-1950s, he served in an official capacity with theGround Observers Corp (GOC), at which time I was asked by the Air DefenseCommand to screen and report UFO activity by code name, FOX TROT KILO 3-0BLUE. During this active period, I was often in communication with the Major. My informant called me in the winter of 1979 when he learned from Tom Shell,newsman for ABC-TV in Los Angeles, that I had been considered by that networkto be interviewed for a major TV production featuring the UFO. My informant saidhe recommended me, having known of my former work in the GOC and as publisherof OBIT in the late 1950s. during one of our several discussions of the UFO problem,when I cited some of the medical information relative to the recovered alienhumanoids, he confided that in 1952 he had attended a high-level secret meeting atWright-Patterson AFB and saw in an underground chamber one of the deceasedalien bodies in deep-freeze preservation. My informant recalls some of the physiological characteristics of the corpse from hisyesteryear observation, but admits details are vague. He said the body, with its longarms positioned straight down alongside it, was about 4 feet tall. The head was largeby human standards and the skin on the face appeared smooth and gray. No bonestructure was evident. Eyes were open, no hair. The feet, he said, were like anorangutan. My informant stated he had visited the Air Force's underground complex inColorado Springs and that some of the UFO material that had been stored at the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Wright-Patterson depository had been transferred there. He also admits having seena portion of an air Force movie which showed an alien craft embedded in the sandof a desert-like region. Aware of this film, I asked if he saw the portion showing thedeceased bodies. (See Case A-9.) He said that at the time of the movie review, hewas preoccupied with other business and missed seeing that portion. My informant disclosed that he is aware of secret Air Force orders in the early1950s which directed pilots on UFO intercept missions to shoot down or ram theirtarget. He did not know of any successful mission of this kind which forced down orcaused a UFO to crash. In one instance, he said, he was aware of an incident when aUFO was surrounded by jets, but escaped by its highly evasive tactics. COMMENT: In support of the Major's information concerning tactical operations involving theUFO and interceptors of the USAF, Mildred Biesele of Salt Lake City, Utah, whoserves as contributing Editor for the MUFON UFO Journal, sent me the followingitem which is typical of other reports known to me since the early 1950s. Her letterof October 2, 1979, is quoted in part below:Letter from Mildred Biesele, October 2, 1979: 'I heard you speak at the MUFON Symposium in Dayton last year and I aminterested in your research on 'Retrievals of the third Kind.' ...I gave a talk at alocal library last week and in the discussion period following, a fellow told methat when he was a gunner in the U. S. Air Force, he had emptied his guns ona UFO and had taken pictures with his gun camera that clearly showed theshells exploding against the side of the craft. He said the camera was taken offthe wing of his plane when he landed and the pictures were developed. At 2a.m., a couple of military policemen came and got him out of bed and tookhim to the base auditorium. They ran the 17 seconds of movie of the UFOover and over and questioned him, and two other crew members until 10 a.m.He was warned never to tell anyone what had happened. ...He said he had awife and family, a good job, and a lot to lose. He seemed afraid of the C.I.A.,and would not even give me his name.' CASE A-5 Following my second lecture, April 6, 1978, before the Cincinnati Chapter of theWorld Wings Association, a gathering of 50 or more pilots, I was approached by amember of the association who knew of a 'person at work' who knew about crashedUFOs and occupants. As reported in Abstract # 19 (Status Report I) of my previouspaper, I promptly got in touch. On April 18, 1978, I talked with former Air Force Sergeant MS of the 97th BomberWing. He was prepared to relate information from a high-ranking intelligence sourcerelative to the retrieval of alien craft and humanoid occupants allegedly maintainedat Wright-Patterson AFB. He also related a sobering story about a landing on an AirForce base, also from the same source. MS, while serving at Wright-Patterson AFBin 1977, made close acquaintance with Major General 'T,' who was assigned atWright-Patterson for top security work in the Logistics Command. His rank and thenature of his work entitled him to a plane at his disposal at all times. He and theGeneral's daughter (name known to me) were seriously lovelorn, and on that basiswere frequently together. This allowed MS to be a guest at the General's homewhere he and the general had private chats. From General 'T,' according to my informant, details were disclosed concerning aUFO that had crashed in the southwest region of the United States in 1957. At thattime, General 'T' was a Lt. Colonel. According to the General, radar had confirmedthat an alien craft had crossed the skies over the United States at great speed. It wastracked to the point of its crash. The area, as in most cases, was 'roped off,' and amilitary unit summoned (with canines) for maximum security. From the damaged craft, four humanoid bodies were recovered with great difficultybecause of the inability to penetrate the craft's metal structure. The deceased bodieswere found badly burned, some parts so severely that certain features wereindistinguishable. However, the suits they wore - appearing silver - were notdamaged by the obviously intense heat endured inside the craft. Said the General,'The suits were fused to the flesh.'"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" According to the General, the four bodies - approximately 5 feet in height - weresent to Wright-Patterson AFB where he had seen them in a deep-freeze morguewhich was kept at approximately 120 degrees F. below zero for preservation. Theonly other anatomical feature described by General 'T' was that the heads of thealiens were large by human standards. Facial features were erased by the heatfactor. The craft? The General related that scientists assigned to the task of dismantling itran into difficulty. To get inside, they concentrated on an area where a fissure orcrack had resulted, probably from impact. Shipment to Wright-Patterson, he said,quoting the General, 'Was by rail, using two military conveyance rocket cars,properly camouflaged and classified as 'rockets.' On another occasion, MS was a guest of the General at his home. While alone withthe General, MS was shown a Top Secret document concerning a landed UFO. Theincident occurred at Nellis AFB in Nevada in 1968. MS expressed disbelief when heread the report. Stamped TOP SECRET, it read in part: Large UFO hovered overNellis AFB for three days. Three small alien craft were observed separating (orbeing ejected) from parent craft. One landed on the air base grounds. Sent to greetthe landed craft was a Colonel with security detachment properly armed. There wasno mention of an attempt to assault the craft. While waiting for a sign of intent, ahumanoid was observed to disembark from the craft and was described as 'short andstocky.' Then a beam of light was directed at the Colonel. The Colonel was instantlyparalyzed, according to the report. Orders then came from the officer next incommand for his detachment to fire, but their weapons jammed. The UFO wasobserved to retreat to its parent craft and then departed. The Colonel washospitalized. The only recall by the Colonel, as MS remembers from the report, wasthat he could recount the event only in terms of mathematics, as though an attemptat communications had been conducted in this manner. COMMENT: I made a check on General 'T' at Wright-Patterson AFB. They had no entry of hisname as having been stationed there. However, when MS (and a witness) called theAccounting and Finance Section at Lowry AFB, Denver, Colorado, to obtain theGeneral's new address in the area he had planned to retire, he was refused ongrounds of the Privacy Act. But the General's name was on record. To authenticatethe General's report on the Nellis AFB incident, I checked with an Intelligencesource and obtained confirmation. (See Case A-6). During August of 1978, MS tried several times through other military friends tomake personal contact with the General, but to no avail. On September 28, 1978, tocheck on a detail about MS's personal life, I called his employer and talked with thecomptroller, the person who arranged our contact initially, and learned to mysurprise that my informant had suddenly left his job three weeks before. TheComptroller said that MS had a service-related back disability and had gone toWright-Patterson AFB for corrective surgery. MS has since become unreachable,having left no new home address or phone number.\" Continued in Part 3 - 1962 Crashed UFO in New MexicoCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
