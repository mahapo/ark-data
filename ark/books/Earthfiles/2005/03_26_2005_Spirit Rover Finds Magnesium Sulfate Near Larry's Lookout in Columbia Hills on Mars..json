D., Mars Spirit Rover Mission and Research Curator, who receives datafrom Spirit and designs maps based on rover data. Dr. Crumpler is based in theVolcanology and Space Science Department at the New Mexico Museum of NaturalHistory and Science in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He is the scientist after whom \"Larry'sLookout\" was named in the Gusev Crater's Columbia Hills. This week he emailed me twice about Spirit's long trek across the Columbia Hills andincluded the stunning image of Martian soil rich in magnesium sulfate. No question thatMars was wetter when the Columbia Hills rocks were deposited before the Martian climatesuddenly changed very early in the red planet's history to greater dryness. See moreinformation in Earthfiles 022505.

Martian Dust Devil Cleaned Off Spirit Rover's Red Dust?\"A panorama on sol 421 captured a dust devil out on the plains. Given that was the daythatwe got an energy surge, probably from a dust cleaning from the solar panels, it seemslikely that dustdevils were active and one passed over us. Paso Robles was after magnesium sulfate-richPeace Rockand on the way to Larry's Lookout. We returned to it at the beginning of last week to dosome moreinvestigation after the Lookout work was done.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Mars Spirit Rover on Sol 421, images a Martian dust devil (red arrow)suspected of blowing off the red dust on the rover and causing Spirit'ssolar energy to increase. Image courtesy NASA. E-Mail March 25, 2005\"Sol 434, Spirit back at Larry's Lookout temporarily. Spirit enjoyed the Lookout so much(where it got a solar panel cleaning from a big gust of wind) that it did a U-turn andreturned to it yesterday afternoon.\"Actually, Spirit had backtracked downhill to visit a soil patch (\"PasoRobles\") that was recognized as one of the saltiest soils (magnesium sulfate) encountered(above) -after we had driven up hill to the Lookout. After the work at the Lookout,we RATted a rock (\"Watchtower\"). The solar panels were cleaned onsol 420 by a big gust of wind and Spirit drove back downhill with more solar energy to dosomemore work on the soils.\"Following the solar panel cleaning on sol 420, power jumped from 60 percentoutput to 91 percent out put. Whereas power was at about 420 W-hrs before,we now have over 800 W-hrs of power. Activities have ramped up accordingly.Also, at this time dust devils have become commonplace out on the plains.Every sol we do dust devil pans looking west to capture them."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Spirit's self portraits show its solar panels on Sol 327 covered with red Martian dust,but cleaned off on Sol 432, the same day power jumped from 60 percent output to 91 percent out put,over 800 W-hours of power. Before then, power was at about 420 W-hours. Images courtesy NASA.\"Then, yesterday, Spirit drove back to the Lookout because the rover driversfelt that that was the best place to begin the long ascent towards thesummit. That makes the path between Paso Robles and Larry's Lookout the mostheavily travel route on Mars: 3 sets of tracks. That's heavy traffic onMars.\"Today, sol 436, a 35 meter drive is planned that will take us south along theyellow path marked on this Navcam panorama.Thursday, March 24, 2005, Sol 434, the view from the Mars Spirit rover as it drove in the Columbia Hillsof Gusev Crater past Larry's Lookout, a high point above a small crater. (See below) All images courtesyNASA.\"That drive will execute by the end of Friday, March 25, (Earth time, middle of day Marslocal).We just uplinked that plan this morning, or will as soon as the sun comes up at Gusev.\"The mega-Pancam color panorama that was acquired at the Lookout is in roughform right now. As soon as the clean version is available I will either postthat or indicate where to get it. Pretty spectacular. (Upcoming at Earthfiles.) Spirit Rover Holds Record in Martian Vertical Ascent\"Two sols ago, Opportunity did a record-breaking drive in excess of 219 metersin the 'parking lot' plains of Meridiani. With that drive the total odometryfor Opportunity exceeded the odometry of Spirit. But Spirit still holds therecord in vertical ascent, having ascending about 80 meters above theelevation of the landing site. In the coming weeks the view should getspectacular as Spirit starts to creep along the ridge towards the summit ofthe Columbia Hills. It should get windy up there since the spring winds arereally whipping up now.\"Below is the Mission Manager's report for the past week:After a very busy weekend, Spirit packed up the IDD and headed away fromPaso Robles. Currently Spirit is back at Larry's Lookout before continuingto drive uphill on Friday, March 25, 2005.. Spirit is currently in restricted mode, so she'sonly been able to drive every other sol. ['Restricted sol' refers to thecase when downlink is too late in the Earth day to build a detailed activityplan for the next sol.-LSC] Unrestricted sols resume this Friday, andSpirit should be able to make good progress towards the Husband Hill summit,using as much of the abundant solar energy as she can.Mission Manager's Sol Details:Sol 430: MB Integration on Paso Dark, Atmospheric Science, Targeted Pancamand MTES, Overnight APXS on light/dark soil mixSol 431: MI on Solar Panel, Undisturbed soil, Paso Dark (post-MB), shortMB integration on Paso Dark, stow IDD.
