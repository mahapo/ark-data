February 25, 2005 Albuquerque, New Mexico - There was a discovery by the SpiritRover on Mars which thrilled NASA scientists in the summer of 2004. Both rovers, Spiritand Opportunity, have been looking for hard geological evidence that Mars had a waterypast. Spirit's discovery would hold up in a \"court room\" as solid evidence of water, onegeologist told me. And if there was once a lot of water on the Martian surface, was therelife in that water? If organisms did live in Martian water, could they still be frozen insurface ice - or even living today underground and in caves on Mars? Could livingorganisms explain methane, formaldehyde and water vapor reported in the Martianatmosphere?This week I have talked with scientists studying those questions at the European SpaceAgency's 1st Mars Express Orbiter conference in Holland and with the only geologist inNew Mexico working the Spirit Rover mission on Mars. All of the scientists are intriguedby the growing pattern of discoveries from the ground-based rovers and the Mars ExpressOrbiter that add up to a lot of liquid water on Mars in the past and tantalizing atmosphericgases that might be linked to present subterranean living organisms.I would like to take share my research journey the past several days that began down atthe New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science where geologist Larry Crumpler,Ph.D., receives data from the Spirit Rover on Mars and designs maps.True color panorama from NASA's Spirit Rover inside Gusev Crater on Mars a few days afterJanuary 3, 2004, landing.

Spirit had landed south of a smaller crater inside the huge Gusev crater andscientists decided to drive Spirit over to take a look inside what came to be known as\"Bonneville Crater.\"Above : Spirit approaching 656-diameter \"Bonneville Crater.\"Below: Graphic interpretation of Spirit Rover at Bonneville Crater rim.Images and graphic credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell.It took 90 Martian days, called \"sols,\" to get from the landing site, around the BonnevilleCrater rim, and investigate rocks. A Martian sol is 24 hours and 37 minutes. Our day onEarth is a little shorter than 24 hours. So 90 sols on Mars is equivalent to about 92 Earthdays, or three months.That's why last March, there was a lot of media attention to Spirit's drive around the rim ofthe 656-foot-diameter Bonneville Crater. But for Dr. Crumpler - who is Research Curatorfor Volcanology and Space Science at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History andScience - he was frustrated that the only ground Spirit was rolling over was lava laid downin the recent past. In Spirit's search for geological evidence of water on Mars, Dr.Crumpler and other scientists wanted to move on further to distant hills rising out of GusevCrater. Spirit's Long Drive from Bonneville Crater to Columbia Hills-Sol 90 to Sol 156 (158 Earth Days, April through August 2004)Spirit took off across the Gusev's lava plain into the hills and has been climbing ever since.Today on February 25, 2005, Spirit has completed its 406th sol on Mars and has shownNASA geologists what they originally set out to find: Martian rocks exposed to a lot ofwater. One discovered in mid-January in the Columbia Hills was named the \"Peace\" rockand has such a high concentration of magnesium sulfate that it provoked Dr. Crumpler tosay, \"It must have soaked in water.\" All this happened after the 90th Sol when the decisionwas made to explore higher ground in the hills.The yellow line distance of Spirit's path from the Bonneville Crater's rim to the Columbia Hills"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"rising up out of the Gusev Crater floor was 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles).

D., Mars Spirit Rover Mission and Research Curator,Volcanology and Space Science, New Mexico Museum of Natural History andScience, Albuquerque, New Mexico: \"Because then, we started doing the really excitingstuff, the real Lewis and Clark on Mars type stuff. We basically realized at the end of thebasic mission, we're out in the middle of these plains that were not going to provide us withthe evidence for the ancient history of Mars that we were looking for because these wereclearly younger lava flows. And we could see these ancient rocks sticking up we called the'Columbia Hills' way to the southeast. Those would potentially be much older rocks fromthe ages we think was a time period of a lot of water on Mars or some water at least.So, we wanted to go there. The problem was they were 2.5 kilometers away, about a mileaway from where we were on the rim of Bonneville. Anyway, at the end of 90 sols, we justsaid we're going to go there, do or die, we are going to do a death march across the plainsand get to Columbia Hills and find out what is there. We turned the Spirit rover on aheading of 130 degrees southeast from north and started driving.Arrow points at Columbia Hills a mile and a half beyond Spirit's location on the rim of Bonneville Craterthe end of March 2004. Image credit NASA/JPL/Cornell.We finally made it to Columbia Hills about Sol 150 we were approaching them and it wasquite spectacular. Because as we approached it, the terrain became much rougher. It waslike surf, lapping on to a new continent. We started going through undulations. They werecausing a lot of rover difficulty. We were having trouble over-tilting and would time out.We would have to re-set and go again the next day. As we approached it within the last 50meters or so, it was like approaching a new world and we were wading ashore from thesurf."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Rough, undulating Gusev crater lava stretching to the much older Columbia Hillsthat rise out of the crater floor.

On the left is the rising base of the \"Columbia Hills,\" land that is about a billion yearsolder than the lavaand is filled with ancient rocks that were soaked a long time, most probably in water. Image credit:NASA/JPL/Cornell.We finally made it on Sol 156. We rolled off, literally rolled across the contact from theplains onto the Columbia Hills and basically the whole mission changed because at thatpoint we were in rocks that were totally different, a totally different age, much older, muchmore evidence for alteration. Also, the terrain changed. Suddenly we weren't in the plainsanymore. We were in mountains and as of this moment we are climbing up the side of thismountain. We're seeing things that haven't been seen before. We're in a new geology.COLUMBIA HILLS TENDS TO SUPPORT AT LEAST THE IDEA THAT THESEROCKS WERE UNDER WATER FOR A LONG TIME.Yeah, they could have been underwater or underground where there was a ground watersystem even if the surface was dry. The water could have been in any number of formsand present any number of time periods. But the point is: if you had to compare it to stuffon the Earth, for an Earth rock to be that altered (sulfur), you would have to soak it inacidic water for hundreds or thousands of years.The rocks in the Columbia Hills - they've seen a lot of water! They've been soaked, they've"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"been altered, there is all sort of evidence that it was a different Mars when those rockswere laid down. It's hard to find a boundary here on the Earth that you can walk across. \"Peace\" Rock's Important Water EvidenceTHAT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY STEVE SQUYRES (Director of Spirit and OpportunityRover Mission) SAID THAT THE PEACE ROCK WAS, FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW,THE MOST IMPORTANT ROCK THAT HAD BEEN INVESTIGATED WITH THEMOSSBAUER UP TO THE MIDDLE OF JANUARY 2005?\"Peace\" rock on \"Husband Hill\" during the rover's 369th Martian day, or sol (Jan. 5, 2005) during explorationof Columbia Hills. Spirit subsequently used its robotic arm to drill into the soft, eroded rock. The white-greyis thetrue color of the magnesium sulfate-rich rock which must have soaked in water for a long time about 3 billionyears ago, a billion years older than Gusev's lava plains. Image credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell.That's right. We'd seen magnesium sulfates before and hematite and things like that whichall indicated water. But this is so pervasive in the \"Peace\" rock and the rock is so soft androtten looking, that it really requires a lot of this fluid present to do this to such a largemassive rock. This is scientific evidence for lots of water. We pretty well suspected thatfrom what we've seen so far in Columbia Hills. This is evidence you can take to the courtroom, as it were, and prove that Mars was probably wet. [Editor's Note: Spirit's Mossbauerinstrument has also found soil in Columbia Hills that looks like sugar spilled in red sandand data indicate the soil could be 25% sulfur or magnesium sulfate.]So, Mars was wetter when these rocks (in Columbia Hills) were deposited and to me that'sthe greatest accomplishment of this mission that we walked across that boundary. We sawwhat the Middle Ages of Mars were like out there on the plains and now we know whatthe Early Age or at least the latest early ages on Mars were like. They are totally different.The early Mars was really wet and suddenly that climate just changed very early in thehistory and things have been a lot drier since. Did All the Surface Water Go Underground and Into Ice?ABOUT HOW FAR BACK IN TIME DO YOU THINK THAT CHANGE OCCURRED?That's the big question, too. We don't have any age date on any of the materials on Mars.We haven't brought any samples back we can run through a lab and get a date on. So, wehave to kind of estimate what we think ages are.Probably the ages we are talking about for Columbia Hills as opposed to the plains is abillion years differences in age. Three and a half billion (Columbia Hills) as opposed to 2.5billion.THE HYPOTHESIS HAS BEEN THAT IF THERE WAS A LOT OF WATER ANDMAYBE IT'S GONE UNDERGROUND DEEP IN MARS BELOW THE PERMASFROSTWHERE IT'S WARMER AND THERE MAY BE ORGANISMS THAT ARERELEASING METHANE AND FORMALDEHYDE?That's something that makes a lot of sense, but you don't have any data to say whethermaking sense is correct sense. But it makes a lot of sense because we know there's been alot of water, the water has gone some place. If water has soaked into the ground, there's alot of places for the water to go and there's a lot of warmth inside Mars where the water"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"could stay unfrozen, circulate. So, it's not radically inconceivable that you could develop abiota that was micro-organisms that lived in the substrate, deep underground. It's entirelyplausible. We don't have evidence for that and I guess the methane business is one littlespike in the efforts to suggest that might be the case. What we need is many data pointsthat really compel us to believe that. It's such a radical idea, concept, that there is life andit's underground.But we need more data, as we always say! (laughs) More data means more missions!\"The next planned NASA rover mission to Mars is set to launch in 2009. It's called the MarsScience Laboratory Project. currently the next planned rover mission to the red planet,launching in 2009.More Information:Martian crust is about 30 miles (50 kilometers) deep. Most of the Northern Hemispherelies at a lower elevation that the Southern Hemisphere. So, the northern crust might bethinner than the southern.The main source of heat inside Mars must be the same as that inside Earth: radioactivedecay, the breakup of the nuclei of atoms of elements such as uranium, potassium andthorium. Due to radioactive heating, the average temperature of the Martian mantle mightbe roughly 2700 degrees F. (1500 degrees C.)Mars probably has a core composed of iron, nickel and sulfur, probably 1800 to 2400miles in diameter. Unlike Earth's core, which is partially melted, the core of Mars probablyis solid because Mars does not have a significant magnetic field. On Earth, motion with inthe molten iron core makes Earth's magnetic fields.Mars Express Orbiter Deep Ground-PenetratingRadar Will Be Turned on in May 2005The MARIS deep groud-penetrating radar will be able to detect ice that is more than50 meters thick and will help map the Elysium Planetia and other areas. If ice - or even deep undergroundliquid water - is detected, the location of methane and other gas concentrations in the atmosphere can becompared for overlaps.Overlaps might identify locations for underground gas emissions.
