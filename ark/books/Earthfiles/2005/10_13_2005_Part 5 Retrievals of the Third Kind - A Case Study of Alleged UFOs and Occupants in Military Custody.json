Stringfield: \"ABSTRACT 17 On June 29, 1978, my son-in-law, Jeffrey Sparks, Assistant Professor of TheaterArts at St. Leo's College, Dade City, Florida, informed me that he had talked with aperson who had witnessed the alien humanoids at Wright-Patterson AFB in 1966.According to my son-in-law, his contact holds a responsible position in a financialcapacity with a private firm in Tampa and had formerly served in militaryIntelligence. He gave me the individual's name and where he could be reached. On July 5, 1978, I talked with Mr. JK at length concerning his functions in militaryIntelligence; what he had observed at Wright-Patterson, and many other aspects ofcrashed alien craft. He also made reference to the computer bank, or 'dump file'which contains secret information about UFOs dating back to 1948. JK, who served in Nike Missile Air Intelligence (ADCAP), related to me thefollowing data:1. He observed nine deceased alien bodies preserved in deep freeze conditionsunder well-lighted, thick glass enclosures. The bodies were short in stature,about four feet in height. They appeared, under the lighting, to be of grayishcolor in skin tone. The research area where the bodies were preserved wasunder heavy guard, inside and out. He was told while viewing the subjects that30 bodies were held in preservation at that time in the Air Base. 2. He did not see firsthand alien craft stored at Wright-Patterson, but was toldthat such craft were on the base. He was also told that an alien craft was heldat Langley AFB in Virginia and another at McDill AFB in Florida. 3. JK knew of three key areas in the 1960s where certain secret UFOoperations were conducted other than at Wright-Patterson AFB. Bases citedwere Langley, Avon Bombing Range - a part of the McDill AFB complex nearSebring, Florida; and at Seymour-Johnson, a Navy Training Center inGoldsboro, South Carolina. 4. At certain military bases, highly trained mobilized units were in a constant'ready' state for dispatch to any area in the U. S. to recover downed or crashedUFOs. 5. During the Vietnam crisis, during JK's tenure of service (1966-1968), five"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"crashes of UFOs occurred in the Tri-State area of Ohio, Indiana andKentucky. There was one known incident of a retrieval of three alien bodies.During this latter incident, there occurred an alleged shooting with the alienforces by our military units. This was triggered by the uncertainty of thealien's intent. Hostility was presumed, said JK. The location or time of theseincidents were not disclosed. 6. Said JK, 'Since 1948, secret information concerning UFO activity involvingthe U. S. military has been contained in a Computer Center at Wright-Patterson. At this base, a master file, written in computer language, ismaintained with duplicate support backup files secreted at other militaryinstallations.' Said JK, 'Get the complete 'file dump,' both the master and thesupport backup files and you've got all the hidden UFO data.' COMMENT: Obviously, the UFO files available to the public at the National Archives inWashington, D. C., do not reveal the hard facts regarding UFO military cases. Concerning JK's disclosures relative to military units subject to dispatch to UFOretrieval areas, I have been aware from other military sources that special forceshave been maintained for emergency situations such as UFO retrievals or otherconditions, including riots. These special forces, known as 'Blue Berets' can operatesecretly and effectively by using 'diversionary tactics' to prevent public interference.Such diversions include creating power blackouts. ABSTRACT 18 This abstract concerns limited biological data with Exhibits A and B which reliableinformants have described concerning the alien humanoids held in institutions in theU. S. where special examinations were conducted. Because this information treats asensitive area within the framework of secrecy such as the names of the medicalcenters, the identity of the informants will not be disclosed at this time. Data mentioned in a number of the previous abstracts have been correlated by me toestablish only a general anatomical configuration of the alien beings. Needless tosay, the general features of the alien are akin to Earth's Homo sapiens. That is tosay, the alien has a head, torso, arms, hands and is bipedal. There, the likeness ends.From anonymous medical and military sources, the following composite or generaldata were obtained:1. The approximate height of the alien humanoid is 3.5 to 4.5 feet tall. Onesource approximated 5 feet. 2. The head, by human standards, is large when compared with the size of thetorso and limbs. (See drawing of head, Exhibit A.) 3. The facial features show a pair of eyes described variously as large, sunkenor deep set, far apart or distended more than human; and slightly slanted,appearing 'Oriental' or 'Mongoloid.' 4. No ear lobes or flesh extending beyond apertures on each side of the head. 5. Nose is vague. Aperture or nares are indicated with slight protuberance.One, and two nares, have been mentioned. 6. Mouth is indicated as a small 'slit.' In some instances, no mouth described.Mouth appears not to function as a means for communication or as orifice forfood ingestion. 7. Neck. Described as being thin; and in some instances, not being visiblebecause of garment in that section of body. 8. Hair. Some observers describe the humanoids as hairless. Some say that thepate shows a slight fuzz. Bodies are described as hairless. 9. Torso. Small and thin fits the general description. In many instances, thebody was observed wearing a garment. From medical authorities, nocomment. No abdominal naval indicated. 10. Arms are described as long and thin and reaching down to the kneesection."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 11. Hands. Four fingers, no thumb. Two fingers appear longer than others.Some observers had seen fingernails; others without. A webbing effectbetween fingers was noted by three authoritative observers. (See drawing ofhand, Exhibit B, and testimonial letter from Mr. Ted Phillips, Exhibit C.Phillips is specialist for MUFON and CUFOS in investigation of UFO traceevidence.) 12. No description available of legs or feet. 13. Skin description is NOT green. It is of rough texture and gray according tomost observers. Some claim beige, tan, brown, or tannish or pinkish-gray andone said it looked almost 'bluish-gray' under deep freeze lights. In oneinstance, the bodies were charred to a dark brown. 14. Teeth unknown. No data from dental authorities. 15. Reproductive organs. This biological region is 'sensitive' - meaning 'secret.'One observer claims no male or female organs were identified. No genitalia.In my nonprofessional judgment, the absence of sexual organs suggests someof the aliens, and perhaps all, do not reproduce as do the Homo sapiens.Perhaps some of the bodies studied are produced by a system of cloning orother unknown means. 16. In some incidents of retrieval, the humanoids appear to be 'formed out of amold,' or share identical biological characteristics. 17. Brain capacity. Unknown. 18. Blood. Liquid is prevalent, but not blood as we know it. 19. Sustenance for existence. No food or water intake is known. No foodfound on craft in one known retrieval. No alimentary canal or rectal areadescribed. 20. Humanoid types. Unknown. Descriptive variations of anatomy might beno more diverse than those known among Earth Homo sapiens. Other alientypes, reportedly varying in range from human to more grotesqueconfigurations, are unknown to me. Speculatively, if these types exist, theymight have their origins in other solar systems or have roots on differentplanets within one solar system. 21. I know of the names of two major medical centers in the eastern UnitedStates where continuing specialized intensive research is conducted ondeceased alien bodies. Other hospitals where research reportedly has beenconducted are in Indiana, Illinois, Texas, Southeastern and Western U.S.A. SUMMARY: It is beyond the scope of this paper to treat all the stories and rumors of stories stillemerging to this writer, each alleging the occurrence of a UFO crash, with or withoutoccupants, and its subsequent hush-hush military retrieval. As of July 20, 1978, for the record, I am aware of more than 50 sources who bearinformation relative to the subject of retrievals or storage of alien craft, and/or thedeceased alien humanoids recovered from the craft. From this number, I haveselected 18 of these sources whose testimony is reviewed in this paper. Most otherslack sufficient data and a few have 'dried up,' so to speak, out of fear of militaryreprisal or public ridicule. Stories of long ago and as recently as 1977 clearly show that the U.S.A. is not theonly territory in the world where UFOs and crews err in their tactical mission andcrash to meet their doom. On foreign soil, we have a number of reported crashes. One allegedly occurred onthe island of Spitzbergen in 1952, which was secretly recovered by Norwegianmilitary authorities. Another UFO crash and retrieval report was contained in a special dispatch from thelate columnist Dorothy Kilgallen, datelined May 23, 1955, London, England, INS, asfollows."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" May 23, 1955 news report from Dorothy Kilgallen, London, England: \"Britishscientists and airmen, after examining the wreckage of one mysterious flying ship,are convinced that these strange aerial objects are flying saucers from anotherplanet. The source of my information is a British official of Cabinet rank. He toldme: 'We believe, on the basis of our inquiries thus far, that the saucers were staffedby small men - probably under four feet. It's frightening, but there's no denying thatflying saucers are from another planet.' This official quoted scientists as saying aflying ship of this type could not have been constructed on Earth. The BritishGovernment, I learned, is withholding an official report on the flying saucerexamination at this time, possibly because it does not want to frighten the public.\" Still other foreign reports in the past and of recent times tell of objects falling toEarth looking like fireballs, of objects exploding on impact. Many crashes haveconventional explanations, but others do not, such as the circular craft that allegedlycrashed in Nauta, Peru, on November 11, 1975. This object, according to RobertBarry, measured 12 feet, eight inches in diameter, which featured a strange metalliccoating. Other reported crashes have occurred in Australia, May 1976; in Mexico,August 1977; and in Bolivia, May 1978. One report of a UFO crash, with recoveredhumanoid occupants, stands out above the others. Occurring in 1953, a hundredmiles outside of Johannesburg, South Africa, the incident prompted investigation bya U. S. Air Force General. Larry Moyers, MUFON State Director of Ohio,uncovered the case and I recently had it confirmed from an Intelligence source. Perhaps the most significant of the reported foreign UFO crashes are those in theCommunist world. My informant, Robert Barry, has learned from a reliableIntelligence source that Red China has two 'downed' UFOs, one of which landed inwater without occupants; and two, possibly three, crashes and retrievals in Russia. In the U. S., reports of UFO crash and retrievals continue through the 1970s. Onerecent incident, for example, not yet substantiated, came to light from reliablesources not to be named at this time as our search for data continues. This incident,allegedly occurring in the Spring of 1977 in a rural area of southwestern Ohio,involved a landed craft, perhaps disabled, and a number of its occupants whoengaged a military unit dispatched to the scene. Whatever happened during thisEncounter of Third Kind, the sketchy data we have thus far, suggests violence.Reportedly, eleven members of the U. S. military detachment were either injured orkilled. There was no word of alien casualties. The story is traceable through ahandful of qualified researchers, then it stops at a dead end. Unreachable is amedical specialist supposedly called in by the military authorities to perform hisexpertise. In the Fall of 1977, I was approached by a Cincinnati researcher and told that hehad learned from a source who worked at Wright-Patterson that in the Spring of1977, military personnel had carried into a certain area on the base, several litterswith little alien bodies from an undisclosed location. Perhaps in time, new data might appear to give credence to one or both of thesepossibly connected stories. Indeed, a pitched land battle between U. S. military andalien forces seems more like fantasy. But if true, then it would be reasonable toassume that the secrecy lid would come down hard on it! The effects from such adisclosure would certainly create more than a 'cultural shock.'\" ontinued in Part 6 - Drawings Exhibits A and B of alien head and hand.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
