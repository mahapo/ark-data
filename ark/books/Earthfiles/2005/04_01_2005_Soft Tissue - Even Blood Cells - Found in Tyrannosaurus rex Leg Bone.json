Painting © by Mark Hallet in Dinosaur Illustrations.April 1, 2005 Raleigh, North Carolina - One of the most awesome creatures that everwalked on Earth was the 20-foot-tall Tyrannosaurus rex, or T-rex. It was a big meat eaterwith many sharp teeth as long as six inches in a head that could be five feet long.Sixty-five million years ago, the big dinosaurs were roaming what is now called the HellCreek Formation in the state of Montana when an asteroid, maybe 6 miles in diameter, hitthe Earth near the Yucatan Peninsula. That violent impact and its subsequent fires and dustblocked sunlight around the world for months and killed off more than 75% of all Earthlife. Thirty-one dinosaur skeletons have been found at the Hell Creek Formation in thepast four years by Montana State University paleontologist, Jack Horner. And one of thoseis the first dinosaur remains to have stretchy tissue and even what appears to be blood cellsinside one of its leg bones. This astonishing discovery recently published in the March2005 journal, Science, was made by biologist and paleontologist, Mary Higby Schweitzer,Ph.D., at North Carolina State University's Dept. of Marine Earth and AtmosphericSciences.Hell Creek Formation, in Hell Creek State Park, near Fort Peck in northeastern Montana,is a blanket of Cretaceous rocks that stretches from eastern Montana into the Dakotas.It all started in 2000 when a fossil prospector named Bob Harmon was searching aroundthe Hell Creek Formation in Montana and sat down to eat lunch. He saw some bonessticking out at the base of a cliff and realized it was the foot of a Tyrannosaurus rex. Butthere were so many thick sedimentary layers covering the skeleton that it was not until2003 that Prof. Horner had managed to extract the skeleton and the bones reached Prof.Schweitzer's lab. She applied a solution to dissolve minerals from part of the leg bone for"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"more detailed study.Interview:Assistant Professor of Paleontology, Mary Higby Schweitzer, Ph.D.,North Carolina State University, Raleigh, uses molecular biology tools to study fossils.She was photographed in front of a slide of soft tissue vessel structure that she removed froma Hell Creek Formation T-Rex. Photograph courtesy North Carolina State University.Mary Higby Schweitzer, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Department of Marine Earth andAtmospheric Sciences, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina: \"Inmodern bone, if you remove the minerals the mineral in bone is what makes your bonehard. If you didn't have the minerals, you probably would not be able to walk becausewhat is left is kind of soft and flexible. You can try this by taking a chicken bone andputting it in a jar of vinegar and letting it sit for a couple of weeks. When you take thebone out, it doesn't look all that different, but you can tie it in a knot.So, what you've done is use the acid in vinegar to remove the minerals and you leavebehind protein. But with fossil bone, of course, no one expects there to be anything leftwhen you remove the minerals. So, we were trying to do this rather slowly. The moremineral we removed, the weirder it got because the bone was not going away like itshould. It was becoming really stretchy and that was our first indication that somethingreally strange was going on with this bone.YOUR IMAGES IN THE SCIENCE ARTICLE SHOW CELLS WITH NUCLEI ANDMAYBE EVEN HEMOGLOBIN?Yes, we do see what appears to be cells. And they do indeed contain nuclei. And there ismore than one type. But if they are really cells or not, we have to await the analysis. I'mnot willing to say they are cells, even though they look and act like cells until I've done thecharacterization of them.Tyrannosaurus rex Blood Vessels, Blood Cells and Endothelial Nuclei?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Above: Recovered from inside T-Rex leg bone, published in the journal Science, what appears to beblood vessels with endothelial nuclei visible.

Could T-rex Cells Be Cloned?IF THERE ARE CELLS AND IT IS T-REX TISSUE, IS IT POSSIBLE THAT DNAMIGHT BE ABLE TO BE RECOVERED?Well, if our studies show they are cells and that it is dinosaur tissue, there is a remotechance we could. But the problem is that DNA as a molecule degrades quicker than mostother molecules. And so, we might have, for example, fragments of protein, but no DNA.We haven't even proven that we have protein yet. So, DNA is not the focus of ourresearch. It's not the focus of my study. It's down the list of things I will be looking for. Butwe've always been told that soft tissues in dinosaurs are not possible either. So, at thispoint, I won't rule anything out, except for cloning of a dinosaur.IF THERE WAS DNA AND IT WAS VIABLE, THEN CLONING A T-REX MIGHT BEPOSSIBLE IN SOME FUTURE?No. It's not just about the DNA in order to clone an extinct organism, especially one thathas been extinct for 65 million years. If we were able to recover DNA from aTyrannosaurus rex, realize that it would be chunked up into little tiny fragments. We'retalking eight to ten orders of magnitude less than what you need for a complete genome ofany vertebrate today. That's orders of magnitude less.Then to make a functional organism, we would have to figure out how to put those alltogether. But you would have to figure out how to put them together in exactly the rightorder. Because if you mess up the order, you're going to mess up the organism. Since wedon't have any living dinosaurs, we have nothing to compare it to, except birds. Birds havecontinued to evolve for millions of years since the dinosaurs stopped. So they might notgive us what we need.But even if you could figure out how to put all of those pieces together in a correct order,they have to be arranged on chromosomes. And we have no idea how many chromosomesa dinosaur had. Even if you could figure that out, then you would have to figure out howto put those in the appropriate environment inside a cell so that it could get all thehormonal and environmental cues to turn those genes on and off, again in the correct orderand correct sequence for the correct length.We have absolutely no idea what those hormonal and chemical cues are to do that for adinosaur. So, to get to the point you can clone a dinosaur, the easiest part is going to begetting the DNA out. We have not done that yet and I'm not willing to say that is possibleright now. So, no! Dinosaur cloning is not in the future."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"BUT IN YOUR PAPER, YOU ARE PRESENTING IMAGES OF WHAT APPEARS TOBE CELLS. WOULDN'T CELLS CONTAIN CHROMOSOMES?At one point in time, yes. But cells degrade. And even if they are not visibly degraded,they are chemically degraded.WHAT IS AT THE TOP OF YOUR RESEARCH LIST?Figuring out what they are. I mean, they look like vessels and they are transparent andthey are stretchy and they are where vessels are supposed to be and they are hollow. Butwe don't know that they really are blood vessels. In order to determine that, we are goingto need to determine what they are made of. And we have to do the same thing for thepopulation of cells that we have.And the reason that it's so exciting, I guess, is this is the first time let me back up a little bit there has been an awful lot of analytical and experimental studies about how cells andtissues degrade after death. We know the chemical cascades involved. We know themolecules involved and we know what happens to cells and tissues during degradation.Knowing that, knowing the chemistry, soft tissues will go away easily within 100 years ofdeath. Easily, except in very rare cases where you have things mummified, for example, orthings frozen in ice. That is not the case for dinosaurs. So, knowing that, based upon thechemistry and experiments and everything else, it is not possible according to our currenttheories to have dinosaur soft tissues remain soft and flexible for this long, which is whyI'm not willing to say that's what they are yet until I study them further.AND THE IMPLICATION IS: IF THEY ARE BLOOD VESSELS, THEN THEREMIGHT BE SOMETHING IN THE ORIGINAL DINOSAUR CHEMISTRY THAT ISDIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE UNDERSTAND ABOUT LIFE TODAY THAT MAYHAVE MADE THE ABILITY OF THESE TISSUES TO LAST FOR 69 TO 65 MILLIONYEARS?Maybe. I guess that's one thing to look at.THEN WHAT WOULD THAT BE?I have no idea.\"More Information:See other Earthfiles reports concerning Tyrannosaurus rex and dinosaurs:· 09/02/2003 -- Updated - Astronomers Don't Think Asteroid Will Hit Earth in 2014· 05/30/2003 -- Scientists Surprised by Common House Fly Fossils in Antarctica· 05/17/2003 -- Major Study Reports Only 10% of Large Ocean Fish Remain· 11/14/2002 -- What Happened 12,000 Years Ago That Killed So Many Animals?· 10/22/2002 -- What Is the Huge Bird Flying Over Manokotak, Alaska?· 03/09/2002 -- Dinosaur Feathers - Even On Tyrannosaurus rex?· 12/22/2001 -- Scientists Warn That Climate and Earth Life Can Change Rapidly· 10/28/2001 -- 12,000-Year-Old Human Hair DNA Has No Match With ModernHumans· 01/07/2001 -- Dinosaur-Killing Asteroid Punched 22 Miles Through Earth's EntireCrust· 04/30/2000 -- A Dinosaur with A Warm-Blooded HeartWebsites:Hell Creek Formation: http://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/cretaceous/hell.htmlTyrannosaurus rex: http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/trex/specialtrex2.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Refund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
