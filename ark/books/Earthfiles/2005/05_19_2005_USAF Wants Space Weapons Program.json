Illustration © 2005 by IEEE. May 19, 2005 Washington, D. C. - A year ago in June 2004, I reported about Germanphysicist Werner Von Braun's warning before he died in 1977 that space above planetEarth and beyond should not be used for weapons and war. Dr. Von Braun, who hadworked in America's early rocket program at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico,told a woman named Carol Rosin who worked for him shortly before his death, \"that wemust prevent the weaponization of space from happening because it will end up destroyinghumanity.\" Dr. Von Braun also told Carol Rosin that he knew there was other life in theuniverse and we would jeopardize contact with them if we persisted with weaponizingspace.This week, The New York Times headlined \"Air Force Seeks Bush's Approval for SpaceWeapons Programs.\" The article stated, \"The U.S. Air Force, saying it must secure space toprotect the nation from attack, is seeking President Bush's approval of a national-securitydirective that could move the United States closer to fielding offensive and defensivespace weapons, according to White House and Air Force officials. ... With little publicdebate, the Pentagon has already spent billions of dollars developing space weapons andpreparing plans to deploy them.\"Four space weapons systems are listed in The New York Times article and this week Italked about what they are and what they could do with Theresa Hitchens, Vice Presidentof the non-profit Center for Defense Information (CDI) in Washington, D. C. Ms. Hitchensworked as a reporter for twenty years writing and editing about space and militaryweapons issues for Defense News and other defense journals.I began our interview by asking about the USAF's April 2005 launch of the XSS-11, anexperimental microsatellite which The New York Times describes as having \"the technicalability to disrupt other nations' military reconnaissance and communications satellites.\"Interview:XSS-11 MicrosatelliteIllustration of XSS-11 microsatellite in orbit around Earth.Copyright © 2005 Jos Heyman."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Theresa Hitchens, Vice President, non-profit Center for Defense Information (CDI),Washington, D. C.: \"The XSS-11 is part of an experimental series. There was a satellitelaunched a few years ago, the XSS-10, which is the predecessor of microsatellites.Microsatellites are something that weighs under 100 kilograms. They are still big, but theyare smaller than a lot of current satellites that weigh in the many tons. The idea behind thisprogram was to establish that a microsatellite could be launched and it could control itselfin maneuvering around a larger satellite.Now, there are a number of reasons why you might want to do that, not all of them deadly.You might want to take pictures of your own satellite to see if it's been damaged to dodamage assessment. You might want to take pictures of someone else's satellite to see if it'sreally what it says it's supposed to be, right?On the other hand, if you have a little satellite like the XSS-11 that can maneuver around asatellite because it has fuel and little thrusters and it can actually move in close to asatellite, it can also be used as a weapon. It could use its thrusters to simply run intoanother satellite in orbit and use kinetic energy to damage it. Or it could carry an explosivepayload.AND THE NY TIMES SAYS 'TO DISRUPT OTHER NATIONS' MILITARYRECONNAISSANCE AND COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITES.' THAT SOUNDS AS IFIT COULD INTERFERE IN SOME SIGNAL WAY?It could do that, too, depending on if it had an IRF, or radio frequency, jammer onboard.IS THAT XXS-11 LAUNCHED IN APRIL 2005 NOW UP THERE WORKING FOR THEUNITED STATE S?It's up there being tested. The test that has designed for this little experimental satellite isnot a weapons test. The test that is being done is it's taking pictures of a satellite. They aretrying to test out the technology of its ability to move and to move precisely in orbit and beable to maneuver. So, they are doing testing of the maneuverability of such a type ofsatellite.ANY FEEDBACK ON THE SUCCESS YET?So far, it's been successful. And the XSS-10 was quite successful. I think what wasimportant in The New York Times story was that it technically could be (a weapon). Now,the USAF has actually studied these types of satellites as potential weapons systems. Theyhave done internal studies that looked at the microsatellites and said these would makegood anti-satellite weapons. So, it's not like the USAF is not looking at this with certainintentions down the road.And it is true that any satellite that can do what the XSS-11 is doing today on orbit couldalso be used as an anti-satellite weapon. Rods From God"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Rods of tungsten, stored on an orbiting platform [top], would be releasedto strike buried targets on Earth. However, each rod would take several minutes to reachits target and would be difficult to steer, limiting the weapon to attacking fixed positions. There is alsoan upper bound on the rods' velocity, which means their destructive force would be similarto that of cheaper conventional explosives. Illustration © 2005 by IEEE.ANOTHER AIR FORCE SPACE PROGRAM NICKNAMED 'RODS FROM GOD,' THENEW YORK TIMES SAYS, \"AIMS TO HURL CYLINDERS OF TUNGSTEN, TITANIUMOR URANIUM FROM THE EDGE OF SPACE TO DESTROY TARGETS ON THEGROUND, STRIKING AT SPEEDS OF ABOUT 7,200 MILES AN HOUR WITH THEFORCE OF A SMALL NUCLEAR WEAPON.\"IS THERE ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN THIS EXPERIMENTAL WORK NOWWITH THE XSS-11 AND THIS AMAZINGLY TITLED 'RODS FROM GOD'?Not really. They are for different missions. The USAF has also been studying that conceptwhich is formally known now as the 'Hyper Velocity Rod Bundles.' Since the late 1980s toearly 1990s, when I was at Defense News, I did a story on one of the programs. It was atthat time called the 'Long Rod Penetrator Program' and the idea is that you have thetungsten rods that would hurtle out of space and supposedly be able to bury themselvesdeep in the ground and hit hard at a target. It's actually not very simple to do that. Thelaws of physics are against you in many ways. You have to go so fast to get down, but ifyou are going too fast you are not going to be able to penetrate because you're going toburn up in the atmosphere. So, there are a lot of physical problems with that and it's not anew concept. It's something the USAF did study in the 1990s and sort of put away on theshelf and said this is not doable.It's now been resurrected in some papers of the USAF. The mention of this system comesfrom something called the \"FY2003 US Transformation Flight Plan,\" which is a documentthe USAF does every year that looks at where they intend to be ten to fifteen or twentyyears down the road, the kind of capabilities they want to have. This system was cited inthe 2003 document as something the USAF would like to have in the 2015 to 2030 timeframe.I don't know of monies being spent on this program in the same way as the XSS-11 hasalready been spent and is operating. I don't know of any monies in the budget for the RodsFrom God that are in a planning paper.DO YOU KNOW WHO NAMED IT?(laughs) Well, the nickname has been around forever. That's not its real name. Its realname is Hyper Velocity Rod Bundles (HVRB) and it used to be called the Long RodPenetrator (LRP). But even back in the 1990s, the nickname for it was the Rods From"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"God.WHICH GIVES THE IDEA OF A METAPHOR OF JUPITER UP THERE THROWINGDOWN...Throwing down lightning bolts, exactly! I think that's exactly why it was nicknamed that. Idon't think it's an official USAF nickname. High-Altitude Airships for Laser WeaponsSpace-based lasers would destroy targets by heating them with a powerful beam generatedby a chemical reaction between hydrogen and fluorine. However, many such lasers would be required forglobalcoverage; clouds and smoke block the beam; and keeping the beam on target long enough to causedamage is difficult.

COULD YOU FLESH THAT ONE OUT?Sure. This is a program that is actually getting money. It's something called EAGLE.[Editor's Note: Evolutionary Air and Space Global Laser Engagement (EAGLE)Airship Relay Mirrors: Significantly extends the range of both the Airborne Laserand Ground-Based Laser by using airborne, terrestrial or space-based lasers inconjunction with space-based relay mirrors to project different laser powers andfrequencies to achieve a broad range of effects from illumination to destruction.] The idea here is that you could have your ground-based laser, or in particular the USAF islooking at the airborne laser, which is a program they have been working on for missiledefense to shoot down missiles using a laser that is shot off of an aircraft. The idea is thatyou could use these optical mirrors to bounce the laser beam and give it more range. Therange of laser beams depends on how much power output you have and how well you canfocus the laser beam.Components of the high-altitude airship relay-mirror system.Illustration © 2004 by Air & Space Power Journal.It would require quite sophisticated optical lenses and very difficult software manipulation:a very difficult program. But it is something that is being funded in the Missile DefenseAgency budget for early experiments.The airborne laser you would use it is being done by the Missile Defense Agency. It is alsoin incredibly early stages. They have built a prototype, but the prototype is in a laboratoryon the ground. They have never flown the prototype laser and they are having with itspower capabilities, its power output. It's very large, too large to put on a Boeing 747 which"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"is the platform they chose for it. Until they can figure out a way to make the power sourcessmaller and have yet more power, that particular weapons system is not going to goanywhere. There has been work with ground-based lasers, but again, you are talking aboutstuff that is relatively early stages of experimentation. Radio Jamming and Electromagnetic PulseTHIS GOES TO THE FOURTH CITED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES, 'SEEKS TO TURNRADIO WAVES INTO WEAPONS WHOSE POWERS COULD RANGE 'FROM A TAPON THE SHOULDER TO TOAST,' IN THE WORDS OF AN AIR FORCE PLAN. WHATIS THIS?Right. The concept is that you can use both radio frequency waves and electromagneticpulse as well as lasers all kinds of directed energy to harm or disrupt satellites.[Editor's Note: National Security Space Architect describes High Power RFWeapons Technology: \"The Radio Frequency (RF) Weapons Thrust develops andtransitions high power microwave weapons technology into the AF operationalinventory and protects U.S. systems against potential radio frequency (RF) weaponsthreats. Efforts include technology development and demonstrations of advancedHigh Power Microwave (HPM) weapons, and development and transition of RFhardening techniques to AF Product Centers and industry. \"The goal of the Radio Frequency (RF) Weapons Thrust is to develop and transitionhigh power microwave (HPM) weapons technology into the AF operationalinventory and to protect U.S. systems against potential radio frequency (RF)weapons threats. Efforts include technology development and demonstrations ofadvanced HPM weapons, and development and transition of RF hardeningtechniques to AF Product Centers and industry. Major milestones have beenattained in demonstrating high power RF sources for a variety of wide- andnarrow-band weapon applications including aircraft self protection (ASP),suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD), command and control warfare(C2W/IW), and AF Space Control.\"]Communication satellites use radio frequency signals, both from the ground up to thesatellite that tell the satellite what to do and from the satellite down, so when youbroadcast down your television and internet broadcasts, those are radio frequency signals.All satellites use radio frequency signals going up to maintain their orbits. Satellite controlis done by radio frequency.It is possible today from the ground to jam radio frequency signals. You simply have tooverpower them with noise, with more powerful radio frequency signals. That's how youjam a satellite.THIS MEANS WHEN IT SAYS, 'FROM A TAP ON THE SHOULDER TO TOAST.'Toast. That you can do that in such a way that you simply jam the satellite for a shortperiod of a time. But if your power output, particularly high-powered microwaves, is highenough you could kill it, you could fry the satellite's circuitry.So, the goal of these offensive weapons against satellites satellite weapons is essentially toprevent other nations from doing the same thing in space militarily that we (USAF) can donow. The idea is that we don't want to let anybody else have the same capabilities, or closeto the same capabilities as us. The problem with that is most other countries do not havededicated military satellite systems. They use commercial and civilian satellites for theirmilitary needs. So, for example, most countries don't have dedicated militarycommunication satellites. They use commercial providers. They use the same satellites thatpeople on the ground use for telephones. They are not dedicated military satellites. Theyare not even in some instances government owned. They are owned by internationalconsortia companies. American Pre-emptive Strike StrategyWHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT THE U. S. MILITARY WANTS TO BE THE800-POUND GORILLA IN SPACE AND WANTS TO REMAIN THERE.Right.AND AS I UNDERSTAND FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE, IT WAS JUST"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"LAST MONTH THAT YOU APPEARED BEFORE THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGNRELATIONS TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE AMERICANMILITARY DESIRE TO DOMINATE SPACE AND SPACE WEAPONRY VERSUS THEPERSPECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, CANADA, CHINA AND RUSSIA.COULD YOU SUMMARIZE WHAT YOU TOLD THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGNRELATIONS?In essence, I said that most other countries of the world are against the idea of puttingweapons in space. There has been a vote in the U. N. General Assembly for the last 20years in which most of the other nations of the world have called for a ban on weapons inspace. Under the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which is the U. S. is a party to, space isconsidered a global commons. In other words, no one can own space. That treaty stipulatesthat no one can own space. Everyone has the right to use space, to transit through space.Nobody can claim territory in space or on the moon. That's what that treaty does and itexists.Now, the 1967 treaty does not prohibit conventional weapons in space, but it does prohibitpeople from owning space. Other nations of the world see this space-domination strategyas an effort by the United States to own space and to prevent other people from usingspace in the ways they see fit. Other countries see this as part and parcel of the BushAdministration's over arching national security strategy which is a strategy based ondominant military power and the threat of pre-emption to prevent war. That concept is infact embedded in USAF doctrine documents covering how they would fight space wars.They talk about the possibility of pre-emptively taking out someone else's satellite; orpre-emptively striking from space at targets on the ground. That's very frightening to othernations of the world, including our allies. For example, currently if you are France or theU. K., the United States has to get permission to fly over those countries with a bomber. Itcan't just show up in French air space with a bomber, even if it's not aimed at France, likeit's going to Iraq or whatever. It has to get permission.When you think about the concept of Rods From God, or any other concept that basesweapons in space aimed at the Earth, you are talking about having something up there24/7 that every ten minutes could be over somebody's country with a weapon pointeddown.THE AMERICAN 'DEATH STAR.'Yeah. That's pretty scary to other nations and I don't blame them. I would find itfrightening if other nations had a similar Death Star over Washington, D. C. every 10minutes!It seems to me that by pushing forward with this space warfare strategy although we mightget an increased military capability in the short term, we are harming ourselves in the longterm. But it does not make sense from a national security viewpoint in the long termbecause you've just prompted other people to try to do the same thing.COULD WE POSSIBLY, SECRETLY, HAVE DEVELOPED THESE WEAPONS THATARE BEING DESCRIBED NOW AS R & D AND ALREADY HAVE SOMETHING INTHE WINGS AND WE JUST WANT TO HAVE OFFICIAL AUTHORITY TO USETHEM?Well, that could be. The overall Dept. of Defense space budget, the budget DOD hasannually for all space programs and that includes things like spy satellites fully HALF OFIT IS CLASSIFIED. So half of the U. S. space budget is classified which means I don'tknow what's in that. So, maybe other nations would suspect that this is simply putting apolitical cap on something that we (U.S.) intend to unveil down the road.RIGHT, EXACTLY.I don't think that is true. I don't think we have a Death Star sitting out at Area 51 ready togo. That said, I can't say that with 100% certainty because I have no insight as to whatgoes on in the classified realm.ANY LEAKS COME TO YOU FROM PEOPLE FRUSTRATED IN THE PENTAGON?(laughs) I don't think I would be wise to answer that! I can say to you that not everyone inthe Pentagon or military services thinks that a space weapons strategy is a good idea.\" What Will Congress and Other Nations Do?The next political step is in June when the House of Representatives will have a spaceprogram subcommittee budget hearing about the USAF request. Theresa Hitchens expects"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"serious Capitol Hill debate leading up to the President's submission of the DefenseDepartment's budget in February 2006.She also expects highly negative political reaction from the rest of the world. Sheanticipates that the European Union could even try to punish the United Stateseconomically by blocking licensing of American commercial satellites and refusing to buyU. S. satellite technology.More Information:BackgroundTheresa Hitchens: \"The U. S. has had an ambivalent policy with regard to the military useof space since the dawn of the Space Age. Pres. Dwight Eisenhower very deliberately setup a policy that separated military space from civil space and put the emphasis on peacefuluses of space.Since that time, that traditionally was the U. S. policy. We've taken a rather reluctant viewof the possibility of weaponizing space. That does not mean that the U. S. Air Force hasnot been pushing for that since the dawn of the Space Age. At least some elements of theUSAF have long believed that we need to take the 'high ground' so to speak to continueour military edge into the 21st Century. So there has been a long tradition in the Air Forceof agitation and support for a space warfare strategy.We tested anti-satellite weapons in the 1980s successfully. We tested an F-15 with amissile that shot and hit a dead satellite in low Earth orbit. The Soviets were also testingmany satellite weapons at that time, too. Both sides although they failed to negotiate atreaty to ban anti-satellite weapons - both sides pretty much stopped work sort of asunilateral moratoriums because they decided that space weapons were bad forinternational security. They might lead to accidental nuclear war because if the other side'searly warning system were targeted by space weapons, it would stop the ability for eachside to stop concern it would be targeted with nuclear weapons.So, there was a concern about crisis instability at that time. The U. S. pretty much stoppedits testing programs and the Soviets stopped theirs.The next time space weapons came to the fore was during the Reagan Administration andthe Star Wars program. Ronald Reagan was primarily interested in the use of space formissile defense. But at that time, the USAF also got approval to begin pursuing someanti-satellite options. So, there was a mix. It's hard to develop technology that is purelydefensive. Any missile defense technology based in space would actually have offensivecapabilities. Such a network of space-based interceptors would inherently be able to targetsatellites. It would just be a question of what they are looking at.That was the next period of time when anti-satellite weapon systems were getting attentionat least internally in the military, although not really publicly because the public eye wasfocused on the missile defense issue, right?So, when George Bush, the first, came in, there was a ratcheting back of the missiledefense program particularly the space arm and ratcheting back of any R & D that wasongoing on satellite systems. When Pres. Clinton came in and actually killed all of theprograms, with the exception of one, that might actually have space weapons application.So, he killed a number of programs that were legacy programs from SDI (Reagan StarWars). He let one laser test go through and it was a laser against a dead satellite. He letthat go through because Clinton was convinced by the folks doing the testing that it wasdesigned to show satellite vulnerability to lasers, not laser ability to attack a satellite. Thetest was configured and at least sold as being a test of our defensive capabilities. But thatwas the only thing that Clinton go through. He killed all the other programs.President Bill Clinton is responsible for the current 1996 National Space Policy that thisBush Administration intends to re-write. That policy, like the Eisenhower policy, also putthe primacy on peaceful uses of space. However, it raises the possibility that the U. S.might need to engage in 'space control,' both defensive and offensive in the text. That wasnever implemented, but it is in the text (of the 1996 policy.) So, even after Clinton, theUSAF was able to push through some of the verbiage that it wanted to untie its hands.\"Websites:1996 National Space Policy: http://www.ostp.gov/NSTC/html/fs/fs-5.htmlIEEE: http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/WEBONLY/publicfeature/mar05/0305star.html#f2"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"CDI: http://www.cdi.org/index.cfmXSS-11: http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/xss-11.htmCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
