Photograph © 2005 by Michael Johnson.September 21, 2005 Fairborn, Ohio - On Monday night September 19, 2005, around10:30 p.m. in Ohio, Michael Johnson and his wife heard a surprising and unexpected deeprumble of thunder. Both are radio ham operators and members of the Dayton Sky Warngroup which watches the sky for unusual weather and sends out alerts. No thunderstormwas expected as far as they knew. But Mike grabbed his digital camera as he usually doesin storms to photograph unusual lightning or other notable storm features.Interview:Michael Johnson, Retired G.E. Aircraft Parts Shop Manager, Fairborn, GreeneCounty, Ohio: \"What I wanted to do, number one, was just go out and make anobservation to see what the intensity level of the storm was. Over the years, I have oftentaken photographs of weather phenomena. I stepped out on the porch because thelightning was rather fierce and very intense. The entire storm caught me unawares.I've had a new digital camera for about the past seven months. I wanted to see if I couldchange some of the settings on it and capture the lightning as it flashed in the sky becausethis was the type of lightning that kind of pulsated, so I knew I would have an opportunityto catch something on the camera.SO YOU WERE TRYING TO ADJUST THE EXPOSURE TIME ON THE CAMERA?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The interesting thing on one of these cameras and this happens to be a Sony Cybershot.The Model Number is: DSCP-150. They've kind of dumbed it down for guys like me. Whatthey do is rather than have all the settings to open your aperture and the film speed and allthat, they have little symbols. One of the symbols on the camera is for night shots and Iassume it opens the aperture a little bit longer. They have a symbol of fireworks for thenight shot, like in the daytime, there is a symbol of someone standing on the beach. Youdon't have to be real smart about it. You just know what the light condition is and set yoursetting for that picture. [ Editor's Note: So, exact fraction of time for image not known. ]DID YOU SET THE CAMERA UP ON A TRIPOD, OR WERE YOU HANDHOLDING?It sounds kind of silly, but I did not have a tripod. I actually pressed the back of thecamera to my forehead and then with my finger on the button. I think that gave it somestability. I had my back up against the wall. I would look in the direction I thought theremight be another flash of lightning.Digital frame 64 (cropped), lightning above Michael Johnson's Fairborn, Ohio, home,around 10:30 p.m., on Monday night, September 19, 2005. This frame was taken after the imageof the unidentified triangle craft. Digital image © 2005 by Michael Johnson.As I was looking, I saw this object. It surprised me that this thing was flying in such fierceweather and that's when I was trying to photograph. I actually pulled it down from myforehead, but was holding it very tightly and tried to focus in on that object.SO YOU'VE GOT ONE WIDE SHOT AND ONE CLOSE-UP?I only had the one wide shot. Then, what I did when I downloaded this to my camera,that's when I noticed that little white dot that was trailing the group of three lights. I didn'teven see that when I took the picture. But I downloaded it at my computer and I have asoftware program called Photo Studio 2000. I was going to crop my photo and send it tomy son, who is a pilot. I went ahead on the original picture, I just took one picture andblew that up and then captured it, saved it. I did not change the original. I just saved thatzoomed portion of the picture. That's how I ended up with the two pictures: one is I havethe original intact as it was downloaded and then I have also the one I captured that waszoomed in the Photo Studio 2000.Digital frame 64 (full and as taken, not enhanced), unidentified aerial craft followed by white light to the farleft of frame.Time was around 10:30 p.m., on Monday night, September 19, 2005, in Fairborn, Ohio.

Enhanced Wide Shot and ZoomAbove: When original digital frame 63 is enhanced in PhotoShop, four more dots of dim lightsappear below the red and white triangle. The trailing light is at far left.Below: Michael Johnson's computer zoom sli ghtly enhanced.WHY IS IT THAT YOU TOOK ONLY ONE PHOTOGRAPH?That's a real good question. When I saw the lights I would say the cloud ceiling was in theneighborhood between 1500 to 2000 feet. We need to check with the Weather Service.But there was a lot of scud layer beneath the cloud base. And this aerial object moved inand out of the cloud layer. I saw it probably for maybe ten to fifteen seconds, maybetwenty, and then it just passed on slowly and went into the clouds.DID YOU TAKE THE PHOTOGRAPH AT THE BEGINNING OF SEEING IT ANDTHEN WATCH IT? OR DID YOU WATCH IT AND THEN TAKE THE PHOTOGRAPH?You have to keep in mind what I was doing. I was trying to photograph the lightning. So Ihad stopped the camera button down about half way and you get this little figure thatflashes on the LED screen that indicates 'You can take a picture now.' So, I held that andas soon as I saw a flash of light, I would just push that button down to capture the image."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"As I was holding the button, I was looking almost due east. That's the direction of back ofmy home faces. This came out slightly out of my field of view and came into my field ofview, I would say from the northeast and at probably 75 to 80 degrees off the horizon. So,I just slowly turned (at seeing motion) and snapped the picture because the button wasready to take a photograph.THEN YOU TOOK THAT SHOT AND WATCHED IT FOR THE NEXT TEN ORFIFTEEN SECONDS?Actually, I would say in the entire time frame, I might have caught it out of the corner ofmy eye and turned and then in two or three or four seconds took the shot. By the time Iframed it up and took the shot and by the time I could reposition to take anymore shots, itwas gone.THE TRIANGLE WENT AWAY BY APPARENTLY RISING INTO THE CLOUDS - ORTHE CLOUDS DESCENDED AROUND IT?Yes, that's what I believe. I'm thinking it was doing what a pilot calls 'scud running' (flyingjust below the cloud ceiling). So I'm thinking this object as photographed was somewherebetween 1,000 and 1500 feet in the air above my house. Silent Triangle of Lights Flew Into Fierce ThunderstormThe thing that made this thing (aerial triangle) different was:Number one: it was low.Number two: it was flying into what I considered a very fierce part of the storm, which ishighly unusual for any pilot. My son is a pilot and I know what they do and do not do.Flying directly into a thunderstorm of this nature would not be advisable for most aircraft.So, that's why I thought this was unusual.Plus three: as I stood there sound out here, I live in the country and sound travels fairlywell, especially when it's damp in the evening. You could not hear anything. You could nothear this craft, this object, I don't know what it was you could not hear it making anynoise.GIVEN YOUR FAMILIARITY WITH WHAT IS COMING IN AND OUT OF WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB AND THE NATIONAL GUARD FIELD, WOULD YOU SAY THATYOU HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS PARTICULAR PATTERN OF LIGHTS BEFORE?Yes, but I have seen some very strange lights in this area and I've always just assumed itwas some military. You see them during the day, a lot of regular aircraft, but at night, yousee some different lighting configurations. I would not say it was completely different thanany I have seen, but I have never observed one that did not make noise.But four: what was also unusual when I downloaded that picture I captured, there was thatlittle trailing light that would have been to the left-hand side of the picture, or north in myorientation here at the house. I have never seen anything trailing another aircraft like that. Fairborn Between Wright-Patterson AFBand Springfield National Guard BaseTo give you some logistical information about where Fairborn is located, it makes it aninteresting spot. But it also lends to some credibility to what I'm reporting because I'm veryfamiliar with seeing aircraft.Just due west of my position is Wright-Patterson AFB. And about 4 to 5 miles due east ofmy house is the Springfield National Guard base. I'm almost in between. So I see a lot ofair traffic. I've seen the stealth fighters fly in here at night. They do that often. I think theygo fly around Wright-Patterson. I've been fortunate enough to stand under what I thoughtwas a B-1 bomber as it took an irregular path into the Wright-Patterson AFB, but flyingvery low and slow literally right over the top of my house. I see planes out here on a dailybasis. It's not uncommon when a storm approaches to see a lot of planes start coming in,usually to the Wright-Patterson AFB. You'll see them taking a pattern in and landingprobably to avoid the storm.\" Mysterious Triangles Over Belgium, 1989-1991"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Above: Picture of a triangular UFO photographed at Petit Rechain near Lieges, Belgium,the beginning of April 1990. Between 1989 and at least 1991, thousands of people reported such unidentifiedtriangular aerial craft to military and authorities. Photographer requested anonymity.Below: The same photograph enhanced for Army military study. THE SILENT, TRIANGULAR OBJECT THAT YOU PHOTOGRAPHED LOOKSSIMILAR TO THOSE REPORTED IN BELGIUM IN 1989 UNTIL AT LEAST 1991.THEY WERE CLASSIFIED AS UNIDENTIFIED. SOME AUTHORITIES WENT SOFAR AS TO SAY THAT THEY MIGHT BE SOMETHING FROM OFF PLANET. WHATIS YOU REACTION TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT WHAT YOU HAVEPHOTOGRAPHED IS SOME VERY ADVANCED EXTRATERRESTRIALTECHNOLOGY?I'm open to that thought process, but I'm also very open to the fact that our governmentprobably has a lot of aircraft that we're not aware of and sometimes we become aware of ittwenty years after the fact. I don't know. I'm not saying 'flying saucer,' but I am saying'UFO' (unidentified flying object) because I don't know what it was. What I saw, I do knowwas unlike anything I have seen in this area. But to make a determination that it was of analien nature not from this planet, I could not make that determination.BUT BEING SILENT AND FLYING INTO A VIOLENT THUNDERSTORM IS NOTWHAT HUMAN PILOTS DO, OR SILENCE IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH OURAERIAL EQUIPMENT.I think that's a perfect observation and that is the same I made. This is the first time I wascompelled to take a picture of lights in the sky. I take night shots all the time of the moonand stars, and this is the first time I was compelled to take a photograph of an aerialobject.\"More Information:September 21, 2005 E-mail from Michael Johnson about his camera:\"Linda,"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The 'long shot' is the only picture that was taken of the object. I used Photo Studio2000 to do a tight shot of the same object. These files are just as they weredownloaded to my computer. I think I mentioned to you that I did not notice thesingle small light behind (north of) the grouping of three lights,until I downloadedthe file. Logistically...I live five miles to the southeast of Wright Patterson Air Force Base. Ialso live five miles, due west of the Springfield National Guard base. This wouldalmost beg one to conclude what I saw was an aircraft. However, you must factor inthat I have lived here for eight years and am very familiar with most known aircraftand their flight patterns; into and out of both bases. I have watched Stealth fightersfly over on many nights and I have had the pleasure of being directly beneath a B1bomber as it made an unusual and low approach to WPAFB. As I told you, I havenever before felt compelled to photograph lights in the sky that are frequently seenin this area. What I saw was different! This object flew fairly low overhead and was not making any sound that wasdiscernible from my location. The object was also flying directly into what I wouldconsider the fiercest part of the storm. I have never witnessed any aircraft flydirectly into harms way as this object appeared to do. Hopefully you have access totechnology that can discern what I saw that night.
