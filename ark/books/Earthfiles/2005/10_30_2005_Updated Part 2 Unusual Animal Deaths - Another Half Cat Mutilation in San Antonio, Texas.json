It just did not seem possible that apredator animal could do that.” - Robert Casell, San Antonio residentand former Los Angeles policeman Half cat discovered October 17, 2005, San Antonio, Texas.Image provided to Earthfiles by resident, Robert Casell. Updated October 30, 2005 San Antonio, Texas - Back in October 1999 in Fort Worth,Texas, five mutilated cats were discovered. The strange deaths included half cats, a catthat had been skinned, and another that had its tail sliced in two halves down its length.Also in October 1999, bloodlessly decapitated and half cats were found in San Jose,California; London, England; and Toronto, Canada. Other 1999 cases involved excisionsof paws and/or back leg from cats in Tucson, Arizona occurred in March and June. Texas was also hit by the cat mutilators in March 2001, when at least a dozen cats werefound cut in half behind their front legs in the northwestern residential area of Austin,Texas. The internal organs and spine sections were cleanly severed, but there was verylittle if any blood at the scene and no signs of struggle, leading investigators to speculatethat the cats were cut up somewhere else and then returned to their home vicinity. TheAustin Police Department and the Travis County Sheriff's Office investigated and a largemonetary reward was offered for any information about the perpetrators. But there wereno arrests and law enforcement officials were baffled."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Half-cat photographed by Plano, Texas Police Officer forIncident Report No. 91-44994, August 31, 1991. Another hot spot for half cat mutilations in Texas has been Plano, Texas, north of Dallas.And now another half cat has been reported in San Antonio, Texas, by resident RobertCasell, a customer care representative for Malin Integrated Handling Solutions and Design(forklift manufacturer). Mr. Casell also worked as a policeman in Los Angeles beforemoving to San Antonio where he and his family have lived for nine years in awell-established neighborhood. Nothing dramatic had ever happened around the Casellresidence until the early morning of Monday, October 17, 2005.Interview:Robert Casell, Customer Care Rep., Malin Integrated Handling Solutions and Designand former Los Angeles policeman, San Antonio, Texas: \"I had a prior commitment toattend some church services early Monday morning (October 17, 2005), and when I camehome around 7:30 a.m., I noticed something in my front yard. It did not strike me that Ihad seen it earlier, even though it was darker. So I went over and looked at it. ImmediatelyI was puzzled because I saw half of a cat.I was going to take my children to school in the neighborhood about a mile away and didnot want them to see it. In the middle of the day, I decided I would look into the half catfurther and got my camera and took a few pictures. But I really wanted to get rid of itbecause I did not want my children to see it later in the day.It kind of startled me because our neighborhood is pretty quiet. We have an occasional dogthat gets loose, but none of the dogs that do that are very large. So, my initial thought was,'What kind of crazy person would do this?' I took the pictures and decided I was going toe-mail the police department, which I did but got no response. I thought I would, but I didnot.Robert Casell took photographs from different anglesand turned cat to see that all the organs had been removed inside upperhalf of cat. 2005 images provided to Earthfiles by Robert Casell.What struck me odd about this particular cat was that it had been cut in half and it lookedlike it had been gutted. It just did not seem possible that a predator animal could do that.The more I thought about it, the more I realized that if I was a predator animal, I'm notgoing to go to that much length to try to kill the animals if I'm doing it for sport or a meal.WAS THERE ANY PRESENCE OF BITE OR CLAW MARKS?I did not see any on the front end of the cat that remained there. It did not look like the cathad gone through any trauma other than obviously the cutting in half, which struck me as"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"odd. These are just cats that hang around in the neighborhood. We have quite a few ofthem. But it did not look like this cat had gotten into a fight. If you see a stray that's beenaround for awhile, you'll see a missing part of an ear or you'll see other marks on the cat.This looked like a house cat, but it didn't look familiar to me.WERE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE HALF CAT CONCEPT FROM ANY OF MYINVESTIGATIVE WORK?No, but it struck me as so odd and that's why I eventually went on the internet to see whatI could learn and saw that you and Earthfiles had done a lot of reporting about cats likethat. At first I thought it had to be a predator animal, but then I thought it might be aSatanic cult cutting cats in half and taking out the organs. But it struck me as so odd.WHERE IS THE BLOOD AND WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE OF STRUGGLE?Right. I wondered where the other half was and I walked around my yard and myneighbors , but I did not find the other half to it.THAT MUST HAVE BEEN PECULIAR?Yes, it was. Usually you would think you could find something nearby. Our neighborhoodhas been around for 25 years and it's not like we're in a newer subdivision encroachingupon wooded areas, I would think of predators like coyotes or wolves. But that's not thecase in this area.YOU DON'T HAVE COYOTES AND WOLVES RUNNING AROUND IN YOURNEIGHBORHOOD.Not in this neighborhood. I haven't seen any. When I took those pictures and I kind ofenlarged them using a zoom feature, I noticed that the cutting on the bone it didn't looklike it was pulled. It did look like it was cut, but with what I have no idea. It looked like ithad to be done with a very sharp blade. There was a little dried, congealed blood aroundthe cut area, but none on the grass.WHY DO YOU THINK THE POLICE DID NOT COME?I just e-mailed the police department. This is not something that's a high priority for thepolice. We live in a big metropolitan city in San Antonio. And I was an ex-police officer inLos Angeles and I kind of know what priorities are for the police department. It's not reallya high priority. My main concern is that I'm going to report it in an e-mail and if there aresome other people who had made some reports, maybe there is something to it.DID YOU THINK ABOUT ANIMAL CONTROL?Yes, but it was easy enough for me to pick up with a trash bag and throw it away, ratherthan have them get involved. Quite frankly, it's not like they are going to investigate anycriminal activity that I'm aware of.UNLE SS THE Y HAVE A LOT OF CASES?Exactly.\"October 30, 2005 - KABC-TV Los Angeles\"Cats Found MutilatedLOS ANGELES - Some cats were found mutilated recently in aneighborhood near West Hollywood, and an animal-care organization said it isoffering a $1,000 reward for information leading to a suspect.\"My two cats now are locked inside, where they've never had to be lockedinside before,\" neighborhood resident Ted Frost said in a broadcast report.\"They don't understand what's going on.

Croft Ave. and asked"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"for his help. He said he contacted the animal-care group after the HollywoodDivision of the Los Angeles Police Department referred the matter to the citysanitation division.'The girl had wrapped it up. It just didn't look right to me. We needed a policeofficer, but I was told that police don't do that. They gave me the sanitationdivision to come and pick up the remains,' Frost said. Frost said one of theauthorities he first talked to indicated the cat had probably been mutilated bycoyotes.He then contacted the nonprofit agency.'They responded on the spot.
