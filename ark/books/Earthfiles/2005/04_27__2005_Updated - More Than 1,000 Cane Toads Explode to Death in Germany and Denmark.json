Originally native to Venezuela, cane toads have poisonous sacson the back of their heads which can kill crocodiles, snakes and otheranimals in minutes. Photograph courtesy of USGS. April 27, 2005 Hamburg, Germany - At first, the idea that poisonous cane toadsoriginally from Venezuela, South America would crawl out of a lake near Hamburg,Germany, and explode to death, sounds like a Monty Python comedy.But over five days between April 3 and April 7, 2005, an estimated 1,000 poisonous canetoads did exactly that. This week I talked to Werner Smolnik, the Hamburg, Germany,Project Leader for NABU, the oldest German society for protection of plants and animals.He went to Altona Lake and watched the baffling phenomenon for himself.Mr. Smolnik told me: \"The animals, they came out of the water on to the land and in thetime of 10 minutes, they increased to nearly four times their normal size and thenexploded. I have seen the toad intestines flying 1 meter.\"Several exploded toad carcasses were delivered to local Hamburg city veterinarian, OttoHorst, D.V.M. He told me he had never seen such toad explosions before and confirmedthat so far no chemicals, pesticides, bacteria or viruses have been found that might explainthe toad explosions.Mr. Smolnik said he was trying to research a rumor that similar cane toad explosionsoccurred in South America in 2002 to 2003, but neither of us so far have been able to findany news reports. One theory was that horses were transporting a toxic yeast frommushrooms into river and lake water. But Dr. Horst told me he does not think that is theexplanation in Hamburg, Germany. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"More Cane Toads Explode in Aarhus County, DenmarkMr. Smolnik said he had not received any more exploding toad reports in Hamburg afterApril 7. But on April 25, about 200 miles north of Hamburg in Aarhus County, Denmark,the Ritzau news agency reported that \"a large number of toads in Laasby, Middle Jutland,(northwest of Copenhagen) have begun to climb on land, whereafter they swell up andexplode. The toad's intestines are thrown almost 1 meter in the air when they explode.Investigators found a rock covered with the bodies of many dead, exploded toads. Thetoads seem to be exploding between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. in the night.\" Cane Toads Unpopular Wherever They GoPerhaps the exploding cane toads is a deliberate and insidious toxin perpetrated by humanrevenge? Anywhere the poisonous toads turn up, people begin wanting to kill them. Fivemonths ago on November 4, 2004, David Tollner, a member of the Australian parliament,used his official post to call for the \"bashing of poisonous cane toads with cricket bats andgolf clubs.\" Cane toads were brought to Queensland from Venezuela, South America, inthe 1930s to try to control beetles that were destroying sugar cane fields on the northernAustralian coasts. But the cane toads, which have poisonous sacs on the back of theirheads that can kill crocodiles, snakes and other animals in minutes, spread rapidly and nownumber in the millions. The Australian Northern Territory government authorized a milliondollars to research biotechnological remedies to the toad invasion. Maybe someone istesting one of the remedies in the German and Denmark waters?Update:April 29, 2005 - Since my above phone conversations with Mr. Smolnik and Dr. Horst, theGerman media has been told that all the estimated thousand exploded toads are missingtheir livers (but only a few have been examined). Further, the theory for the phenomenonnow being discussed is that crows are attacking the cane toads, plucking the livers out ofthe toads' backs between shoulders, causing the blood vessels and lungs to burst.My question is this: if the back of the cane toad is where its very poisonous sac ispositioned with toxin so lethal the cane toad can kill crocodiles, how do crows suddenlyknow where to pluck out specifically the liver without poisoning themselves? So far, nodead crows have been reported in either Germany or Denmark in association with theexploding toad phenomenon.Information Source: Wulf Ladehoff, Office for Veterinary and Food Affairs, Hamburg, Germany, KRT.Websites:http://www.amonline.net.au/factsheets/canetoad.htmhttp://www.news24.com/News24/AnanziArticle/0,6935,2-13-1443_1687962,00.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
