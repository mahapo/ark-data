Here begins Part 6of Status Report I, written July 29, 1978. The series of status reports, I through VII, werewritten by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report II begins atEarthfiles. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. For all the previous statusreports, see Earthfiles Archives. Leonard H. Stringfield: Completion of Status Report I, Final Summary and Conclusion. \"Still another factor that has raised some questions is about the geographical locationof UFO crashes. In the United States, especially in the 1950s, crashes have mainlybeen reported in the western or southwestern desert regions where militaryexperimental installations abound. Logically, one might ask: Is the flying saucer asuper secret U. S. weapon? But the negative answers are overwhelming. As point outearlier, UFO crashes have occurred on foreign soil beyond the range of the U. S.experimental aircraft. And, as known to all research, UFOs have repeatedlyreconnoitered U. S. and foreign military installations and other sensitive areas wherethey sometimes act in a menacing manner. On the premise that humanoid aliens have been preserved in deep freeze conditionsat Wright-Patterson AFB and at several medical centers for research, I believe it issafe to postulate that these entities associated with the UFO are physical and are notan apparition from another dimension. My point here is not to derogate the extra-dimensional entity, for there is much evidence to suggest that it, too, plays a part inthe UFO mystery. It is beyond the scope of this paper to rationalize each and everykind of alien intruder during a live encounter. This subject belongs to my colleague,Ted Bloecher, who has made a scholarly study of this phase of research. In summary, the information treated in this paper, while it might seem provocativeto the media and to the average researcher, does not, admittedly, constitute the finalproof that UFOs are of extraterrestrial origin. But, indeed, if my data from reliableand diverse sources are received with an objective and unbiased mind, then thehypothesis surely is strengthened. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"It seems no matter how hard we might want to disbelieve the data presented in theforegoing abstracts, it will be difficult to explain away the correlative physicalsimilarities of the recovered humanoids. Despite my long experience in UFO research, I must admit that I feel a sense ofhuman uneasiness as vital data continue to reach me from responsible sources. Asthe pieces of the puzzle suddenly fall into place for me, each a corroborative clue, Irealize - like a smack in the face - that our giant Intelligence community, bothmilitary and covert agencies, have been sitting atop a real Pandora's Box with somerighteous cause. I am not condoning our Intelligence forces for their harsh and tricky actions ormethods in suppressing the hidden facts for so many years, but I can now appreciatethe problem they might have had in trying to find a reasonable way out of a dilemmato relate all the sobering data to a benighted world public. How would the publicreact to a sudden official disclosure of even the scantest details relevant to thehumanoid which I have released in this paper? And, the humanoid factor is just asmall segment in the overall sobering UFO data. And, there is still another sensitive aspect to consider: The intent of the UFO! It ismy belief that our Intelligence community does not know the intent of the UFO. Forour government to suddenly release only the known data in a major pronouncementcould pose some new social risks. In my opinion, to release part of the UFO story,and be unable to define the UFO's intent could create an even greater concern in theunpredictable public mind. Perhaps the human mind is ready to hear the truth. Our minds have survived inmany hot wars and a long cold war with the threat of nuclear destruction, plus all thesocial upheavals of the late 1960s and 1970s. I believe we are ready for the truth. Who are these mortals whose imperfect craft have crashed into the foreign soil ofEarth? From what star system do they come where evolutionary life is not toodifferent than our Earth's? Is there a missing link in our primeval pasts, or lost in ourarchaeological wonders which might reveal a human kinship? I do not profess to know the locked away secrets, or the final answer to the UFOmystery, nor do I know what other great secrets might be hidden away with thealleged retrieved craft and deceased aliens. Perhaps, President Jimmy Carter knows these secrets, or some of them. Thus, myplea, here and now, is addressed to the President of the United States to seriouslyreview the testimony I have recorded in this paper. With his conscience as his guide,I trust that the President of the United States will tell this great nation and the worldthe truth about the greatest story of our time.\" Leonard H.
