And I'll tell you it has every sign of being that. It has all theaccouterments. I mean, those kinds of directional antennas don't just show up in the middleof a little U. S. Forest Service Research Station, for God's sake! That's actually thebeginning of a satellite uplink.AND THE FACT THAT AT 9/11 THIS PLACE CAME ALIVE?This place came alive after 9/11. Three or four days later, we were here down on thelakebed and this place was lit up like a Christmas tree! In every single building, the lightswere on.Steve was surprised to find new solar panels, new doors, new locks, new antenna, big airvents, and other signs that the seemingly abandoned, deteriorating place hiding in plainsight.Steve Jones at solar panels: \"What we're looking at here is a brand new solar panel arraythat has been installed on this facility out in the middle of nowhere. Just to give you anidea of cost on this each one of these rectangles on these big panels here they are roughly18 by 48 inches. Those are probably about $1500 a piece. So, in other words, each one ofthese bigger panels is approximately $50,000. So what you are looking at here is a littleover $100,000 of solar panel array that is set up in the middle of this facility in the middleof nowhere. Why?\"Steve Jones on porch next to new door with new locks amid peeling paint: \"The aerialphotographs were taken with the impact site over on this lake bed being the center of theaerial photographs. They took a grid pattern of aerial photographs on June 11, 1953, about50 to 75 miles in every direction with this being the center, indicating to me they had avery keen interest on what's going on in this particular area. It intrigued me. I thought therehas to be some connection between this place (DRES) and that impact (triangle).STEVE, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE STRONGEST EVIDENCE THERE MIGHT BEAN EXTRATERRESTRIAL VEHICLE BURIED UNDER THAT DRY LAKE?Again, the size of the impact. If you take a look at not only the aerial photographs thatwere taken I strongly believe these were taken by the U. S. Air Force because of what theylook like. These photos were 24 inches x 24 inches, single shot aerial photographs on oldphotographic style paper and they were not cut and pasted together. I've seen aerialphotographs before as early as the early 1960s and I know what they look like.I have personally seen the crash debris field of a B-52 which put down in Sacramento,California, in the 1980s. I know what an aircraft debris field looks like. This was not anaircraft. Whatever it was, was very large. What I suspect is that it had a shallow, roundundercarriage to it and when it slid down this incline into the lake bed, it created havoc. Itreally just rained debris down field in a massive way. I've taken a look at the terra serverimages you can go on terra server to this day and take a look at this impact site. It has notsubstantially changed in over 50 years."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Left: July 20, 1997, United States Geological Survey TerraServer satellite imageof the DRES lakebed triangle at (113W 40'29.83\" by 38N 37').Right: High altitude aerial image of triangle feature in lake bed, June 11, 1953.Length of triangle feature is 4,400 by 2,700 feet wide.WHY IS IT TRIANGULAR?Why is it triangular? My feeling is that it was the shape of the craft that dictated the way and angle of impact, the way it hit the lakebed is what created that V-shaped pattern.And these were intelligence photographs, obviously from the way they were made up.That really impressed me and I thought, 'Why would they make this kind of effort todocument and observe this particular area?' It's out in the middle of nowhere! We aresitting in a valley that is probably one of the most desolate parts of the United States. Thisvalley is 110 miles long, 20 miles wide, and there are only two ranches around here. Youwould have to go 50 miles to see another human being.Out in the middle of this valley is this little village in which we are sitting that was set uporiginally back in 1933, built as a CCC project, and it became a Desert ResearchExperimental Station. But yet, based on the log book, we've got military intelligencepeople, for God's sake, coming to this place. Why? I mean, that asks some big questions.Talking to the locals, they know something is going on out here. I've actually interviewed aperson in a little town about 30 miles from here who said he was awakened from a deepsleep when he was 12 years old, that would have placed it right around 1953, the middle ofthe night. The sky lit up, the ground shook for 15 minutes. It scared the heck out of hismother. She thought it was the end of the world. Something happened out here.\" Baker Resident Described Night Time Crash In Early 1950sAlleged UFO eyewitness, Bart Wright, lived in Baker, Nevada, in 1953.In 1953, a boy named Bart Wright was about 12-years-old, living with his large family of adozen siblings on the outskirts of Baker, Nevada. Baker is a small community about 45minutes by car from the Desert Research Experimental Station. In 2001, Rex Leonard wasmanager of The Outlaw Bar in Baker. He hired Bart Wright to be a bartender. Bart toldRex about a haunting memory he had from around 1953.Rex Leonard, former manager of The Outlaw Bar, Baker, Nevada, July 20, 2005: \"Itwas after dark and this thing came flying across the valley and landed on the other side ofthe mountain which would put it down near where Steve (Jones) was looking at the crashsite."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"DID HE DESCRIBE ANYTHING ABOUT THE COLOR?I think he said it had a kind of pervasive blue color, like an electric light, you know? I doremember him talking about it as a little kid when he saw this thing. And the time the date,1953, I think would coincide with the object Steve (Jones) is convinced landed, fell, hit orcrashed out there in that dry lake on the other side of the mountain from where Bart wasliving then when he was growing up that he (Bart) saw it in the eyes of a 12-year-old. Itwas just a bright light and when it hit, the ground rumbled and as you say, he probably didrun to his mother. It seems like he said there were people from the government camearound to talk to people all over the valley after that.\"One of the fourth generation settlers in the town of Garrison nearest DRES is 90-year-oldLadd Davies. He told Rex Leonard that once \"long ago\" while Ladd was riding at sunup,he saw \"a UFO not more than a hundred yards away. It was making absolutely no soundand when it went by, the color was black as if light was being sucked into it. Ladd said itwas like you could look into infinity looking inside of it.\" Geology Research With Ultrasoundand Magnetometer in August 1999Steve Jones wanted to know if he could find any evidence of a large buried object insidethe lakebed triangle. So, in 1999, he and his colleague, Les Velez, hired Salt Lake Citygeologist Lamont Sorenson. Mr. Sorenson, through his company, LGS Geophysics, Inc.,examined the aerial photographs of the peculiar triangle feature and studied two ends ofthe lakebed site with a magnetometer and ultrasound. Mr. Sorenson's report was entitled\"Results of Geophysical Investigations, Vicinity of Desert Range Experimental Station,Baker, Millard County, Utah.\"Cover of August 1999 geology report about DRES triangle researchby Lamont Sorenson (deceased spring 2005), LGS Geophysics, Inc., Salt Lake City, Utah.Mr. Sorenson could not find any anomalies in the end sections of the triangle that weresearched for an underground anomaly, indicated in his diagram by the vertical straightlines. But he told Steve Jones that the triangle pattern, so vivid from the air and yet sodifficult to detect on the ground, was \"not made by Nature.\" The triangle was not the resultof natural events such as flooding or meteor impacts. The implication is that an artificialdigging process might have taken place, perhaps to bury a large object that could not betransported?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Diagram of 1999 lakebed ultrasound and magnetometer research in end portions of trianglewhich is 4,400 long and 2,700 feet wide. Diagram drawn by Lamont Sorenson for Steve Jones and LesterVe l ez.Steve Jones, July 17, 2005, at the DRES facility, Utah: \"I have had a field geologist(Lamont Sorensen) come with us out here that had the EG&G ultrasound testingequipment. He was a petroleum geologist and he told me, 'This is not a natural occurringfeature.' We showed him the aerial photographs. We took him out on site. He said, 'This isnot a naturally occurring feature.'WHAT DID THE GEOLOGIST SAY ABOUT THE ARTIFICIALITY OF THETRIANGULAR SHAPE?He told me that it's not something that was made by the weather, it's not something thatwas made by he's seen bolides and a bolide crater. Those type of craters make a differentpattern. It's just that it was not made like if they had a flash flood come down the side ofthis valley and into the lake bed. It was not made that way.I have tried various methods we started out with the ultrasound. We have used fieldmagnetometers on it. We have gone out and punched holes in the ground just to see howfar down we could go before we hit solid hard pan or anything like that. It's a tough nut tocrack. It really is. But my guess is that the best way to do it would be thermal infrared andan overflight to do an infrared of the area to see if there is anything buried out there thatwould show up.I mean, consider the logistics of the time, what they had to work with. If you have a craft,for example, that is made out of material like titanium and they did not have the plasmatorches and that kind of technology to cut them up into pieces and haul them out. I mean,that's about the only option they have is to dig a big hole and leave it there.STEVE, ISN'T THE IMPLICATION THAT IF SOMETHING SO BIG CAME DOWN ONTHAT DRY LAKEBED NEAR THE DRES, THAT IT HAD TO BE BURIED? THEYWOULD HAVE TO BRING IN SCIENTISTS HERE. THEY WOULD HAVE TO BRINGIN THE CHEMISTS AND METALLURGISTS HERE BECAUSE THEY COULD NOTTAKE IT ANYWHERE ELSE?Correct. My feeling was that they had to either build a very large underground facility orhave access to it in stealth to keep the local population from talking about it. The logisticsare doable. The impact zone is only 3 miles away (from DRES) and here you have afacility that is perfectly suitable for doing something like that. The plant biologists thatcome out here don't come out that often. All the government has to do is shut off accessfor a little while, bring in a group of scientists and even if they built a tunnel down there toget access to where they buried it. Logistically, it would be beautiful because they couldkeep it secret and prevent I mean, you know that the Soviets were keeping an eye on usjust as we were on them. Anything like this would have set off alarms especially thinkingthe way the military does about this. They would really have to keep it under wraps. Thisis perfect. You have a station that is set up as a scientific research station. You could bringin engineers, biologists and physicists and house them in this facility and no one wouldknow the better. I mean, they would not know.\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" USAF Former C-141 Pilot, October 7, 2005Now I would like to share excerpts from a recent interview I did by phone on October 7,2005, with a former USAF pilot who has asked for anonymity. He says he has firsthandknowledge from 1993 of an underground facility below the triangular pattern in thelakebed that was connected by a tunnel to the DRES buildings. He asserts that he also hasfirsthand knowledge of a thirty foot vertical by a hundred fifty-foot-long oval-shaped\"extraterrestrial vehicle\" which crashed in the lakebed and was buried in 1953, beneaththe odd triangle ground pattern. According to the retired Air Force pilot, the craft was stillunderground at the DRES lakebed as recently as the mid-1990s.USAF former C-141 pilot: \"WHAT I UNDERSTAND FROM STEVE JONES IS THATYOU WERE ON A RECOVERY TEAM?Well, in the Air Force which I'm not going to talk about were all kinds of things. I can't talkabout it. They will shoot me.WERE THOSE THINGS RELATED TO THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICALENTITY PHENOMENON?You're making it hard. I can't talk about that stuff. They weren't from this world, let me putit that way.WHAT IS YOUR PERSONAL FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE DRY LAKEBED TRIANGLE THAT IS IN THE HIGH ALTITUDE PHOTOGRAPHS DATED JUNE11, 1953?That's a crash that happened back in late 1952 or early 1953. I don't remember the exactdate now, but it crashed there (DRES facility, Utah), and not in Kingman. They buried itthere.DO YOU KNOW FOR A FACT THAT SOME SORT OF EXTRATERRESTRIALVEHICLE WAS BURIED INSIDE OF THAT AREA THAT IS THE TRIANGULARPATTERN NEAR THE DRES FACILITY?The ship was 150 feet in diameter. It was an oblong ship that was about 3 stories high. Youcan't pack that up on a car and drive it off. You can't helicopter it out and the metal theycouldn't cut it up. So, they had to put it somewhere.WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF YOUR INFORMATION?(long pause) That ought to tell you.WHAT DID OUR GOVERNMENT DO?Start digging a big hole!HOW DID THEY DO THAT?With a lot of Army guys with shovels. I mean, they dug for days and days and days. It'spretty sandy out there, so it's pretty easy. Bulldozers and what not.BURYING SOMETHING THAT'S 3 STORIES HIGH AT LEAST 30 FEET HIGH BY ?150ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FEET IN DIAMETER. THAT'S PRETTY BIG.Half of it was already buried after it finally settled down. So, they had to dig the other halfout.AND IT'S STILL BURIED IN OCTOBER 2005, AS FAR AS YOU KNOW?As far as I know, yeah. I haven't been there in a good ten years or so. It was there when Iwas there last.IS THE DRES FACILITY A HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONIN WHICH THERE ARE UNDERGROUND FACILITIES TO ACCESS THE BURIEDCRAFT?It used to be. It's not active anymore. There used to be some underground walkways to thesite and into the ship."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"YOU KNOW THAT FIRSTHAND?I walked into the ship myself.DO YOU KNOW WHICH TYPE OF ENTITY IT'S LINKED WITH?The Zeta Reticulan.THE GREY-SKINNED ONES WITH THE VERTICAL PUPIL, REPTILIAN EYES?The small grey, you can call them. They are not really reptilian eyes, but OK. Big round,black eyes.DO YOU HAVE ANY UNDERSTANDING WHY THE 1953 AERIAL THAT WASTAKEN ON JUNE 11, 1953, SHOWS A LARGE TRIANGULAR, UNNATURALPATTERN? WHY A TRIANGLE?Who knows. Those people did all kinds of weird things.IN OTHER WORDS, THE DIGGING AND THE BURYING LEAVING THATTRIANGULAR PATTERN MIGHT HAVE BEEN FOR SOME REASON?Probably some aerial reasons for the other ships to come in and land, most likely, would bemy guess.\"Continued in Part 4 - Remote viewing of DRES by Joe McMoneagle, IntuitiveIntelligence Applications, Inc.More information:Also, see other Earthfiles UFO crash retrieval reports:Â· 07/29/2005 -- Bentwaters and Rendlesham Forest Mystery Beyond December 1980Â· 04/14/2005 -- \"Battle of Los Angeles\" On February 25, 1942Â· 02/13/2005 -- Part 1: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report IV - Fatal Encounter AtFt.
