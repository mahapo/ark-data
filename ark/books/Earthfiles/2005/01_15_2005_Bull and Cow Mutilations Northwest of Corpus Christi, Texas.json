S. Army Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso told me thathe had seen with his own eyes, during his work for the Eisenhower and KennedyAdministrations, highly classified documents about unusual and bloodless animal deathsaround the world dated as early as 1951. That would be only four years after the Roswell,New Mexico, headlines about an unidentified flying disc that had crashed near Corona.In the early 1990s, documents were leaked about a small group called Majestic 12,allegedly appointed by President Harry S. Truman to study the \"interplanetary\" mystery.At that 1947 Corona, New Mexico, UFO crash site, bodies were allegedly found \"dissectedas you would a frog.\" But the documents do not make clear if the dissected bodies wereanimals, humans or non-humans.See these other Earthfiles reports:-12/10/2004 - Part 4: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOBRetaliation?-05/16/2004 - Part 8: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report VI © July 1991 byLeonard H. Stringfield.-03/17/2004 - Part 2 - \"Horrible Secret,\" UFO Crash Retrievals Near Roswell,New Mexico, July 1947?However, in the same paragraph about dissected bodies, one document says that atanother 1947 UFO crash site on the White Sands Missile Proving Ground, \"Animal partswere reportedly discovered inside the craft.\"If the U. S. government has linked extraterrestrial biological entities to the worldwideanimal mutilation phenomenon since at least 1947, the fact that the mutilations continue tooccur to this day means that the government has no control over the mutilators. January 5, 2005, Bull and Cow Mutilations in Sandia, TexasSandi a, Texas, northw est of Corpus Chri sti .And the animal mutilations continue worldwide to date. On January 5th, James Lund wastraveling with his nephew, Chris, near Sandia, Texas, northwest of Corpus Christi. Mr.Lund owns a direct satellite installation company called Exodus Communications Co. andwas making repairs. The men were on Route 359 just south of Sandia when Chris noticed acow down in the pasture about 150 yards from the road. The ranch's owner is stillunknown and no necropsies were done under rancher's or Jim Wells County Sheriff'srequests, but I talked with James Lund this week about why the cow lying there looked sostrange to them.Interview: (Chris Lund photographs will be added when available.)James Lund, Owner, Exodus Communications Co., Orange Grove, Texas: \"I thought itwas kind of strange because there were a lot of buzzards hanging around and none of thebuzzards were touching the cow. Normally they would be all over it. I was thinking thecow was down pretty fresh and maybe it's not decayed enough."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"So, we went on to take care of the work and on the way back, we decided to stop andcheck out the cow and see what might have killed it maybe animals or disease orsomething like that. So, we hopped over and as we were approaching towards that cow, wecame across another one that was down it was a bull. The bull was probably 150 yardssouth of the cow. We went up to the bull to see what might have brought it down andwhen we got up to it, it was a crazy sight.It did not look like any animals had taken it down. There were no bite marks on the legs oranything like that. But they (bull and cow) were dead and the bull had a hole in its chest,probably 8-inches in diameter, perfectly round. It looked like it had been cauterized as ithad been cut into the chest of the bull. The hide and everything were gone.Oct. 7, 1977 Cow Chest Hole, Sterling, Colorado8-inch-diameter, bloodless chest hole was photographed in mutilated cow on the Carl Sherwinranch in Sterling, Colorado, on October 5, 1977. Polaroid photograph by Logan County Sheriff, Tex Graves.Sandia, Texas Bull's ExcisionsIt also had all its reproductive organs were removed. The eyes were removed. The tongueand teeth were removed. They had some strange cuts in the forearms. They had circularcuts as well, maybe two inches in diameter. They looked like they were cut out with areally sharp cookie cutter or something. They were also cauterized as they went in becausethere wasn't a drop of blood anywhere near or on this animal.AS YOU'RE STANDING THERE AT THE BULL, HOW FAR IS IT TO THE COW?About 150 yards.WHEN YOU WALK THAT APPROXIMATELY 300 FEET OVER TO THE COW, CANYOU GIVE A SIMILAR DETAILED DESCRIPTION STARTING WITH THE EARSAND GOING TO THE BACK OF THE BODY ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED TOTHE COW? Cow's ExcisionsWhen we walked from the bull over to the cow it was a straight walk, I mean they werepretty much parallel to each other true north and south. We walked over to the cow and itwas laying in the exact same position the bull was laying in. It's head was facing the sameexact direction, it was laying in the same fashion. The cow did not have the cut in thechest, but its tongue and teeth were missing; its eyes were gone. That one still had the ears.It had a hole in its arm where it was taken out there and the back of the cow, from theudders would be, gone, the same as the bull. And also a gaping hole in the rear.WHERE IS THIS HOLE IN THE LEG?It would be on the lower part of the cow's leg, on the front, right leg. Like below theelbow, if you think of it like an elbow on a cow.HOW BIG WAS THIS?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The hole? About two inches in diameter.WAS IT ALMOST LIKE A PERFECT CIRCLE? OR AN OVAL?It was a perfect circle.SO YOU ARE LOOKING AT A 2-INCH DIAMETER PERFECT CIRCLE GOING INTOTHE FRONT LEG OF THIS COW, ABOUT HOW DEEPLY?To the bone.YOU COULD SEE THE BONE?Yes. You could see - if the cow had been laying there for a number of days, so the fleshinside had kind of receded back. That might have been what exposed the bone, but youcould see the bone, yes.SO THE COW AND THE BULL BOTH HAD A 2-INCH DIAMETER CIRCULARHOLE IN THEIR FRONT, RIGHT LEGS?Ye s .THAT'S VERY UNUSUAL. IN THE UDDER, WAS ANY PART OF THE UDDER STILLTHERE IN THE BELLY, OR HAD THE WHOLE THING BEEN REMOVED SORT OFFLAT TO THE HIDE?Flat to the hide. It was all gone.WITH ANOTHER BOWLING BALL-SIZED HOLE IN THE REAR (OF COW)?Ye s .WA S H E R TA I L T H E R E ?Yes, I think the tails were still there. No Maggots, Fire Ants or Natural PredatorsThe strangest thing in the story is this: there was some buzzards hanging around in thearea, but none would approach this animal. This animal was decayed enough that buzzardswould definitely have been eating on it.DO YOU MEAN THE BULL OR THE COW OR BOTH?Both. Neither of the animals was being touched by the birds. They wouldn't have anythingto do with them. And to compound that, there were no flies near the animal, either one ofthem. There was not one fly in the area and not one maggot on the animals. There were noants. There are probably 1,000 ant beds in that area. You see them when you look acrossthe field, that's all you see. They are fire ants. I don't know if you are familiar with fireants, but these things can devour an animal very quickly. They weren't anywhere neareither of these animals. The fire ants wouldn't touch them either.FROM MAGGOTS TO THE FIRE ANTS TO PREDATION NONE OF THAT WASNORMAL.Absolutely not, it wasn't normal at all. Those cattle should have been devoured by animalsand insects and nothing would touch them. Nothing at all.If a mother cow gives birth to a baby out in a pasture and she doesn't get that baby up onits feet, fire ants will kill it and then they will consume it. And they will do it very rapidly.In a couple of weeks, a baby calf could be gone.SO, WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT YOU HAVE COME ACROSS A MUTILATEDBULL AND A MUTILATED COW IN A PASTURE, NOT KNOWING EXACTLYWHEN THEY DIED, BUT IN THAT AREA OF TEXAS THOSE FIRE ANTS SHOULDHAVE CONSUMED THOSE BODIES?Absolutely.WHAT ALL OF US WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS: WHAT IS IT THAT HAPPENS TOTHESE ANIMALS THAT KEEPS PREDATORS AWAY AND NOW EVEN KEEPS FIREA N TS AWAY ?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I really don't know. I've thought about it a lot since we found these animals, we were soclose to them. I wonder if we should have got so close to these animals because we don'tknow what killed them and we don't know why nothing else will have anything to do witheating them.\"More Information:For more information about the persistent worldwide animal mutilationphenomenon, please see previous Earthfiles reports:· 12/22/2004 -- Part 1: \"Reasons Why U.S. Government CAN'T Release Truth AboutUFOs!\"· 12/22/2004 -- Part 2: \"Reasons Why U.S. Government CAN'T Release Truth AboutUFOs!\"· 12/10/2004 -- Part 4: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation?· 12/10/2004 -- Part 3: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation?· 12/07/2004 -- Part 2: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation?· 12/04/2004 -- Part 1: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation?· 09/25/2004 -- Part 6: \"Clearview\" Report Investigation of UFO Experiences on ARocky Mountain Ranch· 09/13/2004 -- Part 1: \"Clearview\" Report Investigation of UFO Experiences on ARocky Mountain Ranch· 08/11/2004 -- Newborn Heifer Mutilation in Anderson, California, on August 7,2004· 07/27/2004 -- Part 12: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report VI © July 1991 byLeonard H.
