Stringfield: \"PART II: NEW SUPPORT DATA I, or any of my research contemporaries, might never live to see the day when all thefacts are bared to either verify or completely quash the story of UFO crashes,retrievals, and of the little nondescript bipeds that are kept under official wraps incryogenic catacombs. The whole truth is beyond my meager range of inquiry. Thedata I present here are hardly sufficient to change the hard crust of our scientificcommunity. And, if everything I know is true, then perhaps it is also true that otherinformation unknown to me would 'blow the mind,' as the former C.I.A. employeeonce commented on tape. If, then, the real facts are so unsettling, is it socially wiseto hide the truth until the day may come when disaster strikes or a docile segment ofour humanity is converted to fear or worship a fetish that does not even exist? In the meantime, until the official facts can be bared of what I have revealed can bebelieved, then UFOlogy must continue to live with the UFO Crash/RetrievalSyndrome until its frustrations can be relieved by seeing a humanoid like King Tuton exhibition. But my story is not yet finished. It is not all dominated by anonymousfirsthand informants whose reports of a UFO crash/retrieval might be diagnosed assyndrome of a sick mind. There are others of a growing legion of credible peoplewho have provided valuable data. Consider the following: ITEM B-1 (REVISED) Kecksburg, Pennsylvania - December 9, 1965 "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Kecksburg, Pennsyl vani a, i s about 35 mil es southeast of Pi ttsbur gh, Pennsyl vani a. Clark McClelland, formerly Director of NICAP, Florida Unit-3, during the period heworked at the Kennedy Space Center as a member of the Apollo program, informedme on October 5, 1979, of an alleged UFO crash/retrieval incident occurring nearKecksburg, Pennsylvania, December 9, 1965. McClelland has since correlated oldand newly acquired data, relative to the incident, which is contained in the followingreport for this paper: Clark McClelland, January 17, 1980:'Just before sunset on the evening of December 9, 1965, a fiery object causinga brilliant glow was observed by thousands of frightened and mystifiedresidents of Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Yorkand Ontario, Canada. A loud aerial explosion occurred causing several shockwaves that were experienced by private and commercial aircraft pilots flyingover Michigan and Lake St. Clair, east of Detroit. During the explosion, pilotsand people on the ground observed something detach from the glowing formand fall to earth near Lapeer, Michigan. Other parts of the object eventuallycame to earth near Elyria, Ohio; Midland, Pennsylvania; and finally theremainder fell into a rural wooded area near Kecksburg in southwesternPennsylvania. Witnesses claim to have seen a metallic acorn-shaped objectwith strange markings in the Kecksburg, Pennsylvania woods on December 9, 1965.Drawing by Charles Hanna © 1998 by Stan Gordon Productions. Retracing the flight of this unidentified flying object reveals some startlingfacts. One can trace the object's path in a straight line from its initialobservation above Lapeer, Michigan, and as it continued over Lake St. Clair,to Elyria, Ohio, in a southeasterly trajectory. As the UFO flew over Elyria, itmade an apparent course change of twenty-five degrees which appeared to bea controlled adjustment. This would obviously kill the usual explanation that itwas a meteor or a bolide. This conclusion was later advanced by Dr. PaulAnnear, Professor of Astronomy at Baldwin-Wallace University, andimmediately drew agreement from some Pentagon sources, even though thewitnessed fall of physical material from the object to the ground over severalcities verified the actual flight path. Calculations show that the UFO was most probably between 40 and 60 milesaltitude when first observed over Michigan. Assuming the object was 60 mileshigh, it could have easily been observed from Indiana to Ontario, Canada. Amassing all the distances where witnesses claimed to have observed theglowing mass, we find that it was puttering along at about 17 miles a minute or1,062.5 miles an hour. This is considerably slower than the astronomicallyrecorded minimum speed of 27,000 mph or the maximum, 144,000 mph thatmeteors have been measured to be traveling during their plunges to earth. So"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"the college professor and the Pentagon called this mysterious object a meteoror bolide. Hah! Ask yourself - who is kidding whom? Another possibility exists to explain the mystery object. An inquiry wasrecently made through the records maintained by the United States Air ForceSpace Defense Center which is the headquarters of the North American AirDefense Command (NORAD) in Colorado. On January 11, 1980, Mr. DelKinchey, the Base Public Information Officer, assisted in searching thesatellite and space debris re-entry archives for recorded tracking data on thedate of the Kecksburg impact. He discovered that on November 23, 1965, theSoviet Union launched one of their spy satellite series designated Cosmos 96.What is interesting about this is that it either aborted or was recalled tore-enter into the earth's atmosphere sixteen days later on the day of theKecksburg incident, December 9, 1965. Further inquiry concerning there-entry data where the Air Force expected the device to impact will beforthcoming in a future edition of this publication. Even if this does prove to be an explanation for the Kecksburg object, it iscommon knowledge by those experienced in aerospace science and rocketdevelopment that no spacecraft or nose cone in 1965 had the capability of a25-degree adjustment in flight direction during earth re-entry. Within an hour following the impact of the object at Kecksburg, a largecontingent of military specialists arrived at the scene almost as swiftly as thePennsylvania State Police and local volunteer fire groups. They quicklycordoned off the area and ordered all on-lookers to leave. One armed forcesspokesman was reported to have said, 'We don't know what we have, butthere is an unidentified flying object in the woods.' On January 11, 1980, James Mayes, former Assistant Fire Chief, and MelvinReese, former fireman for the Kecksburg Volunteer Fire unit at the time of theimpact were interviewed. They had both accompanied an unidentifiedPennsylvania State Policeman to within 75 yards of the wooded hollow wherethe crash occurred. Both men report seeing an object flashing. They could notdetermine the exact shape of the object. Both men agree that there was no fireassociated with the impact. James Mayes also recalls that the military unit didset up a command post at the Kecksburg Volunteer Fire Hall. He said thatinformation concerning the affair was relayed to an Air Force Base west ofPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, possibly Wright-Patterson in Dayton, Ohio. Mr.Mayes was not positive, so this disclosure is uncertain. Mr. Mayes also said he had heard that a large military truck was cleared toenter the restricted area and that hours later the truck reappeared with a largeobject under a tarpaulin. Other residents of the area recall hearing of the truckhauling something during the night. The truck rumor was unsubstantiated until Robert Bitner, the Fire Chief in1965, offered the following information. Mr. Bitner was working at the timeof the fall and arrived later than other volunteers who were assisting the StatePolice and military unit. Later, during the night, Bitner was present near theimpact site when a large 10 ton military truck appeared coming from thewooded area. It had a tarpaulin spread over a large object that appeared to be6 feet high, 7 feet wide and 17 feet long. Mr. Bitner was approximately 25feet from the truck and the military had personnel standing guard around theentire vehicle. Eventually the truck, under escort, left for an undiscloseddestination. Was that place Wright-Patterson AFB or someplace else? No oneknows. The Kecksburg incident was not caused by a meteor or anything astronomical.Of this we can be sure. Perhaps further study of re-entry data will determinean association with the Cosmos-96 that returned to Earth on December 9,1965. This remains to be proven. Was it a craft alien to earth? Informationgained so far may eventually favor this theory. What is certain is thatsomething important was apparently retrieved by the military and as yet, theobject and its origin remain a mystery.* Clark McClelland, January 17, 1980.'* Stringfield Footnote:On November 16, 1979, I was interviewed on the John Signa Show, Radio StationKDKA, Pittsburgh. Other guests were Clark McClelland, Betty Hill and TravisWalton. During the 3-hour session, the Kecksburg retrieval incident was aired. Toour surprise, we received four calls from people who allegedly were at the sitefollowing the crash. Some claim they saw the flatbed truck under tarp leave the area.Another later saw the hole caused by impact. Three witnessed the military security"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"team who sealed off the area. One, who got too close, was ordered to leave.Although one military spokesman said the retrieved object was as 'meteorite,'McClelland emphasized that he was aware of the UFO's flight pattern prior to thecrash which ruled out that explanation. [ Editor's Note: Also see · 10/25/2003 Earthfiles Part 1 - What Does NASAKnow About 1965 Aerial Vehicle Crash in Kecksburg, Pennsylvania? ] ITEM B-2 Modesto, California - September 10, 1979 Randall Clement serves as Dispatcher in a Communications Center for a lawenforcement agency in Northern California. He told me on September 11, 1979, thata possible UFO crash or landing had occurred on the previous evening atapproximately 7 p.m. in the general area of Modesto, California. He was on duty atthe time when two officers of his unit observed a green, luminous object flying atlow-level over Shasta County, descending gradually in a southerly course. Whilelinked by phone with the National Alert Warning System, Clement heard that theUFO was confirmed by radar at Vandenberg AFB and that jets were scrambled froman air base. The UFO was described by observers as wobbling in its flight like apendulum. This he referred to as the 'falling leaf syndrome,' a behavior that isspeculated to be associated with a malfunctioning UFO. From other sources, too, Ihave learned that the wobbling effect, possibly indicating a troubled UFO, is alsodiscernible by certain effects appearing on radar. ITEM B-3 Colorado Springs, Colorado - Early 1970s? Randall Clement first contacted me by letter in January 1978, to relate a meetingwith a friend several years ago who had served in the Air Force as a technician. Thatwork brought him to the underground facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. There,for reasons unexplained, he claims to have seen a dismembered and charred body ofan alien humanoid. Efforts are being made to elicit more details. ITEM B-4 Ohio/Michigan Border - Spring 1975 Bette Shilling, working on a college UFO project, first heard of my 'Retrieval' paperwhen I was interviewed on a Los Angeles radio station in Fall 1978. She wrote to meand I responded by phone when I learned that her friend, an Air force officer, hadtold her that he knew of a crashed alien craft occurring in the Spring of 1975. At thattime, she said, he was Communications Officer at a 'station' in Detroit, and wasresponsible for transmission of a coded message to the Commanding Officer atanother base in Ohio (Wright-Patterson?) about a crash in a rural area near the Ohioborder in Michigan. Two dead bodies, and one still alive, were retrieved. Namewithheld by request. ITEM B-5 Naval Air Station, Sunnyvale, California - 1952 William D. Leet of Texarkana, Arkansas, was long-time respected researcher,former Major, Air Force pilot in WWII and Korea, and co-author of To R u l e T h eSky. He knew of my UFO crash/retrieval research and reached me by letter inDecember 1978, to relate that he had a lead from Mr. Lynn Ward, which concerneda relative who had seen a captured flying saucer in a Navy hangar in 1950. Thewitness was Durward 'Buddy' Haak, CPO Radar Observer, while stationed at aNaval Air Station in Sunnyvale, California. In 1952, Buddy Haak was on an ill-fatedflight out of San Diego. His aircraft disappeared; no trace of it was ever found. Buddy Haak, according to testimony received from members of his family, hadaccidentally entered a door of a large hangar that was temporarily unguarded. Hesaw a huge, round, saucer-shaped craft with a row of windows. A guard shut thedoor in his face and ordered him to forget what he had seen, or else. By June 1979,through the efforts of Bill Leet, I had received written statements from two membersof the family who recalled the story and managed to get the phone number of"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Durward Haak's mother. On June 25, 1979, I called Mrs. Haak, who requested thather full name and address be withheld. She recalled her son's concern about seeingthe flying saucer. 'It was certainly no aircraft of ours,' she remembers him saying.Although other members of the family connect Buddy's strange disappearance withhis knowledge of the UFO, Mrs. Haak did not. ITEM B-6 Dayton, Ohio, Wright-Patterson AFB - 1953 Richard Hall, Editor of the MUFON UFO Journal wrote in a letter dated March 23,1979:'...Don Berliner (aviation writer) just returned from visiting an aviation historianfriend in Illinois named Truman Weaver. While there, Weaver showed him a copy ofa letter dated March 1978, from a good friend of Weaver's in the aviation business ...who worked as a technician at Wright-Patterson, retiring in 1954. This gentlemansaid that he worked 'across the alley' from where they kept the bodies. He said thatin 1953, they had 13 of them in a room on the third floor. A strong odor used to waftacross the way. Upon inquiring, they were told it was embalming fluid. The bodies,he said, are now stored at a small Air Force Base (Langley) at Hampton Roads,Virginia...' On April 3, 1979, I called Truman Weaver, a former Air Force Major, who himselfhad a UFO experience while flying in Korea in 1952. He and crew saw a daylightdisc that was 12 feet in diameter under intelligent control off his wingtip. Withouthesitation, Weaver gave me the phone number of his friend, Robert Thompson,whom he knew through mutual aviation interests. On the same day, I phonedThompson. He confirmed the data Berliner had related to Hall about his work atWright-Patterson. He added, 'Suddenly, the building nearby became very busy,trucks drove up and right into the building. This was before air conditioning wasinstalled and with windows open, I could smell the strong odor of formaldehyde. Itwas sickening.' Thompson said he never saw a flying saucer or a little body personally, but he didclaim to see what he called an 'interim report.' His boss named McAdams showed itto him and fellow workers, which he said confirmed the rumors that alien craft andbodies were on the base. The next day, he said the paper was snatched fromMcAdams and officials denied it even existed. Thompson could not remember if thereport was on official stationary or marked SECRET or if it was mimeographed.Curious, I called Weaver about such a document. He was not aware of such a reportfor general circulation unless it was a document that leaked out withoutauthorization. On April 5, Thompson sent me a note which stated briefly: 'Thebuilding number was 18F, 3rd floor. The 13 bodies and 2 saucers are at a small airbase at Hampton Roads, Virginia, if they have not been moved again. Thompsonsaid he heard about the transfer to Hampton Roads from a source now in Canadaand unreachable. ITEM B-7 Del Rio, Texas - 1950 On June 25, 1978, James Minton, his wife and I, breakfasted together in a motel inCarlyle, Illinois, on the day Betty Hill, Charles Hickson, and I each addressed theUFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis, hosted by Mrs. Rosetta Holmes, at the FishHatchery grounds. Jim and I, over several coffees, discussed our respective interestsin the UFO and have since that day 'kept in touch' as I continued to develop newmaterial about the UFO crash/retrieval syndrome. In September 1979, Jim called torelate that he had talked with a former Air Force friend named William Draeger ofAustin, Texas, who had uncovered some information about a 1950 craft incidentoccurring in Mexico. I knew the incident well. It had been disputed by some researchers. However, I hadnot pursued the case beyond having referred to the alleged crash in my previouspaper (Status Report I to be reprinted in upcoming Earthfiles.) At that time, I hadused information related by Todd Zechel to the Midnight Globe. Since then, furtherresearch into the case by Zechel and others has revealed that not only the year ofthe incident was wrong - it was changed from 1948 to 1950 - but also the crash sitechanged. Whatever the status of the case, I was eager to learn anything new. So, Minton made"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"arrangements for me to call Draeger the same day. One call led to another asDraeger had hoped to gather information from still another backup source. Like hisfriend Minton, he was willing and able to probe and was resourceful. Being alsohonest, Draeger said he was unable to get his other source to talk, but agreed tosubmit a statement for this paper relative to his investigation in Mexico (nameswithheld). His letter, dated October 11, 1979, follows: October 11, 1979, Statement by William Draeger of Austin Texas:'Todd Zechel called me in Austin, Texas, on Sunday, August 13, 1979. He wasacting as consultant to a Japanese television crew from Nippon TelevisionNetwork taping a UFO documentary. They were in Del Rio, Texas,researching the alleged UFO crash which occurred in 1950 (and has at timesbeen erroneously reported as having occurred near Laredo, Texas). OnMonday, August 14, I was employed as interpreter for the Japanese crew dueto the fact that I was raised in Del Rio and speak Spanish fluently. The retiredColonel, who witnessed the UFO in the air and later on the ground, was also inDel Rio with Todd and reported that the soldiers surrounding the crashed craftwere Mexican troops. I contacted the Mexican Army General who hadcommand of that specific area of the border and initially talked with him bytelephone. I identified myself and my position and related that in 1950 a UFOwas reported to have crashed 30 miles northwest of Del Rio. We had along apilot who had seen it in the air and later on the ground being guarded byMexican troops until American Air Force units arrived to retrieve the craftand a body that was found aboard. Without pause, the General answered inSpanish: 'Yes, I know about that. I don't have any papers or documents toprove it, but due to my position, I know about that.' When I asked if he would consent to an interview, he paused and said hewould be busy for 30 minutes, but afterwards would be free for an interviewat his home. when the 7-man crew, the retired colonel and myself arrived andwe talked with him, he totally denied any knowledge of the incident and oncamera he denied and evaded any questions dealing with the incident andUFOs. The General is a military celebrity and began his career as a youngLieutenant serving under Pancho villa during the Mexican Revolution. He wasacquainted with several movie stars, like John Wayne, and became friendswith General George Patton when he was stationed at Fort Clark, 35 milesfrom the border. They played polo together. I believe the General is beyondreproach and that he 'slipped' on the telephone, but maintained strict securityfor the interview. I, William H. Draeger, do hereby swear to God that the above statement is thetruth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. (signed) William H. Draeger' \" To be continued in Part 8 - U. S.
