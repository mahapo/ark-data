Here begins Part 4of Status Report II, written in January 1980. The series of status reports, I through VII,were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report IIIbegins at Earthfiles. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. For all theprevious status reports, see Earthfiles Archives. Leonard H. Stringfield: \"CASE A-7 This entry concerns the medical phase of my inquiry into the study of the alienoccupants allegedly recovered from crashes of their vehicles. My first meeting witha prime medical contact came in June 1978, while working on my first status report(reprinted in upcoming Earthfiles) for release in Dayton, Ohio. It was arranged by aveteran researcher of long acquaintance who was aware of my quest for UFOcrash/retrieval information. He also knew that I had acquired certain basicpathological information from other sources. Over our dinner, information from thedoctor, who served on the staff of a major hospital, came slowly and cautiously. Hemade references to a colleague who performed an autopsy on an alien body in theearly 1950s, but in the main, not much new data were revealed beyond generalexterior anatomy. Significant, however, was that certain characteristics, someambiguously described by other sources, were surprisingly corroborated. Of course,I asked many questions. Most were unanswered. Later that evening, I met myinformant's charming wife and we all agreed that our subject was not only bizarre,but almost too incredible for the general public's acceptance. Departing, the doctorwas agreeable to further meetings. Communications continued along with a developing mutual trust in our exchange ofinformation. The doctor's next move was for us to meet privately in Dayton,following my scheduled talk. I met him briefly in the lobby of the ConventionCenter before the program commenced and agreed to rejoin him at a certain time inmy room at the Stouffer's Inn. However, because of the intervention of the threats,which caused a sudden shift of my room for my safety, he was unable to reach me. Ilater learned that even his note that he had pushed under the door of my formerroom went mysteriously astray. It seemed logical that the new occupant, seeminglydistressed by the transfer, could have notified the hotel of the note and they in turncould have made an attempt to reach me in the room to which I had beenreassigned. But the new occupant did not and the Dayton affair was full of mysteriesthat might go forever unexplained. Soon, normal liaison with the doctor resumed. In time, as new information relative toUFO crashes reached me from several new sources, so did new vital data about the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"alien's physiology. Emerging was a new source, a noted doctor, who was willing toreceive and answer some of my questions. I was to know him as a specialist who, inhis area of expertise, had performed an autopsy on an alien being in the early 1950s.From him over time, I was able to envision the body entirely. The more I learned ofits internal chemistry and some of its organs - or by human equation the lack oforgans - I realized that our captured mortal member of the universe was beyond thelimits of my non-professional evaluation. During 1979, my sole objective in UFO research has been to release newly acquireddata concerning whatever is obtainable from creditable sources about the continuingstudy of the recovered alien bodies. In the main, it has come from medical people. Itis, therefore, important in this status report to first review the general data I havecorrelated collectively from several sources in the compendium that follows: Leonard Stringfield Summary of At Least One Non-Human TypeAs Described by Medical Doctors: - The approximate height of the alien humanoid is 3.5 to 4.5 feet all. One sourceapproximated 5 feet. The weight is approximately 40 pounds.- Two round eyes without pupils. Under heavy brow ridge, eyes described variouslyas large, almond-shaped, elongated, sunken or deep set, far apart, slightly slanted,appearing 'Oriental' or 'Mongoloid.'- The head, by human standards, is large when compared with the size of the torsoand limbs. 'Take a look at a 5-month-old human fetus,' I was told. Five-month-old fetus © Prenatal Sectionof the Life Exhibit, Chicago Museum of Science and Industry.- No ear lobes or protrusive flesh extending beyond apertures on each side ofhead.- Nose is vague. Two nares are indicated with only slight protuberance.- Mouth is indicated as a small 'slit' without lips, opening into a small cavity.Mouth appears not to function as a means of communication or as an orificefor food ingestion.- Neck described as being thin. In some instances, not being visible becauseof garment on that section of body.- Most observers describe the head of the humanoids as hairless. One saidthat the pate showed a slight fuzz. Bodies are described as hairless.- Small and thin, fits the general description of the torso. In most instances,the body was observed wearing a metallic, but flexible garment.- Arms are described as long and thin and reaching down to the knee section.- One type of hands has four fingers, no thumb. Two fingers appear longerthan others. Some observers had seen fingernails; others without. A slightwebbing effect between fingers was noted by three authoritative observers.(See Attachment 3 in Earthfiles Part 3).). Other reports indicate types withless or more than four fingers.- Legs short and thin. Feet of one type described as having no toes. Mostobservers describe feet as covered. One source said foot looked like anorangutan's.- Skin description is NOT green. Some claim beige, tan, brown, or tannish orpinkish gray and one said it looked almost 'bluish gray' under deep freeze"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"lights. In two instances, the bodies were charred to a dark brown. The textureis described as scaly or reptilian, and as stretchable, elastic or mobile oversmooth muscle or skeletal tissue. No striated muscle. No perspiration, no bodyodor.*[ * In November 1979, additional word was received from the medicalauthority concerning the nature of alien skin. Under magnification, Iwas told, the tissue structure appears mesh-like or like a grid's networkof horizontal and perpendicular lines. Clarifying an earlier referencewhich describes the skin of the entity as 'reptilian,' this new informationsuggests that the texture of the granular-skinned lizards, such as theiguana and chameleons, might be similar to at least one type of alienhumanoid. ]- No teeth.- No apparent reproductive organs. Perhaps atrophied by evolutionarydegeneration. No genitalia. In my non-professional judgment, the absence ofsexual organs suggests that some of the aliens, and perhaps all, do notreproduce as do the Homo sapiens. Perhaps some of the bodies studied areproduced by a system of cloning or other unknown means.- To most observers, the humanoids appear to be 'formed out of a mold,' orshare identical facial characteristics.- Brain and its capacity, unknown.- Colorless liquid prevalent in body without red cells. No lymphocytes. Not acarrier of oxygen. No food or water intake is known. No food found aboardcraft in one known retrieval. No digestive system or GI tract. No intestinal oralimentary canal or rectal area described.- More than one humanoid type. Life span unknown. Descriptive variationsof anatomy might be no more diverse than those known among Earth's Homosapiens. Other recovered alien types of human or other grotesqueconfigurations are unknown to me. Origin unknown.After several months of negotiation with my major medical sources, hoping to getmore specific physiological data, I received the following typewritten statement inthe mail on July 2, 1979. It was from the doctor who had performed the autopsy inthe early 1950s. June 2, 1979 statement from doctor who performedalien autopsy in early 1950s: ' SIZE - The specimen observed was four feet, three and three-eighths inchesin length. I can't remember the weight. It has been so long and my files do notcontain the weight. I recall the length well because we had a disagreement andeveryone took their turn at measuring. HEAD - The head was pear-shaped in appearance and oversized by humanstandards for the body. The eyes were Mongoloid in appearance. The ends ofthe eyes furthest from the nasal cavity slanted upward at about a ten degreeangle. The eyes were recessed into the head. There seemed to be no visibleeyelids, only what seemed like a fold. Oriental eyes without lids. There were no human type lips as such - just a slit that opened into an oralcavity about two inches deep. A membrane along the rear of the cavityseparated it from what would be the digestive tract. The tongue seemed to beatrophied into almost a membrane. No teeth were observed. X-rays revealed amaxilla and mandible as well a cranial bone structure. The outer 'ear lobes' didnot exist. The auditory orifices present were similar to our middle and innerear canals. The head contained no hair follicles. The skin seemed grayish incolor and seemed mobile when moved. The above observations are from general anatomical observations. I did notautopsy or study the head portion in any great detail since this was not myarea of specialty. NOTE: Your drawing [ See in Earthfiles Part 3) of the head should have thecheek bones removed or a smoother contour. The eyes in the nasal cavity areaare not right. The recess and fold is continuous across the forehead. The neckseems too long, but the shoulders do not slope as prominently. This might give"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"you this effect. The arms are oversized in length by human standards. Therewas no thumb. The index finger in your drawing is longer than the middlefinger. I don't believe this is correct, but my memory is hazy at this point. Thechest area contained what seemed like two atrophied mammary gland nipples.The sexual organs were atrophied. Some other investigators have observedfemale specimens. I have not had this opportunity. The legs were short andthin. The feet did not show any toes. The skin covered the foot in such a waythat it gave the appearance of wearing a sock. However, X-ray examinationshowed normal bone structure underneath. ' STRINGFIELD COMMENT: The statement received from the doctor, which I had requested for this status report,is indeed a breakthrough. Knowing the doctor's area of medical expertise and thehospital in which he continues his specialized work, it is my belief that his claim tohaving conducted an autopsy is true. Knowledgeable of other activity at the medicalcenter, plus his comments relative to a specific study, I hasten to say that I can findno hints or obvious loose ends that would indicate a hoax. Moreover, some of theinformation he had related in the past year, not included in his statement, wascorroborated by another source, also a doctor. Although this latter source issecondhand, the information shared contains an important detail about a skincharacteristic. Noteworthy is that many questions asked of my medical person have goneunanswered. For some reason, it took several months to get his response to describethe alien's foot. When it came to me through his colleague (prior to his writtenstatement), he said that there were no distinct toes. Instead, a 'fusion of small bonesthat indicated evolutionary degeneration.' Later, when I pointed out that distinct toeshad been mentioned in a report from another source, he checked with a colleagueand got confirmation. 'There are more than one type,' he said. Significant, too, is thatstill another of my sources, the Air Force Major (See Status Report II, Case A-4)told me that the one body he had seen had toes 'like an orangutan.' Also relative tothe foot, when I asked Robert Barry for information about the foot from his formerC. I. A. source, I was told that he was unable to disclose that detail. Later, when Ilearned of this detail from my medical source, Barry was able to confirm it. Getting information about the brain, if any exists as we know it, is without results.No one seems to know. My medical source either doesn't know or is reluctant tocomment. Other specific questions about the alien's internal organs, or specificdetails about its circulatory or reproductive systems are also circumvented. Oneexception, however, to a question I had relative to a device allegedly worn by someof the recovered alien entities concerned a so-called head band. Originally, I heardof it from a former NASA source as a 'translator,' used to communicate in alllanguages with people on Earth. The source, known through a technical person atBell Laboratories, would not come forward for an interview. Barry's source referredto it as a 'transceiver,' adding cryptically that it was used in the 'projection of brainwaves.' One sample of the band, he said, was procured in the 1962 crash, and hassince been analyzed and developed by the Air Force in an attempt to 'talk themdown (UFOs) into landing.' Finally, on this perplexing issue, I asked my medicalsource if such a gadget existed. In time, I learned that he was aware of it, but hadnot seen it. He offered no details. Of course, in research it is known that a headband, or similar unit, worn on the chest or waist, is described during encounters withlive entities. Photographs showing the deceased humanoids have been seen by my medicalsources. In these, a metallic, one-piece suit was worn. Also, in my first paper, astatement was reviewed from Ted Phillips, a prominent MUFON and CUFOSresearcher, specializing in the investigation of physical traces at UFO landing sites,which states that he was privileged to have seen a photo showing the body entirely.At a meeting November 27, 1978, in New York during our visit to the UnitedNations (with Drs. Hynek, Saunders, Vallee, Poher, and Gordon Cooper and LeeSpiegel to present the UFO problem to Secretary General Kurt Waldheim), he toldme that he was shocked when he saw my drawing of the alien hand. It was strikinglysimilar to the hand he had seen in the photograph. (See Attachment 3 in EarthfilesPart 3)."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Photograph July 14, 1978, United Nation hearings on UFO matters, initiated by country of Granada.Left to right: Dr. Claude Poher (GEPAN, France); Sir Eric Gairy (Granada, initiator of the hearings);Kurt Waldheim (Austria, at the time Secretary General of the UN); Gordon Cooper (US astronaut,UFO witness as pilot in the 1950s); Dr. J.
