Leonard Stringfield: \"'THE MORICHES BAY 'RETRIEVAL' While the spotlight of the research community shines on the illustrious probes anddetective work that brought the Roswell and Kecksburg cases to the forefront, anotherincident that happened on September 28, 1989, involved a mysterious 'retrieval-of-something' from the watery depths of Moriches Bay off Long Island, N. Y. Except forthe local witnesses of the event in the Bay area to to those beyond in New York State andNew England, who were aware of a UFO flap during that time-frame, the major researchgroups gave it no more than a glancing interest. But, thanks to John Ford, head of the LongIsland UFO Network, his probes into the retrieval events finally led to a full scaleinvestigation. The LIUFON report is long and tedious reading - evidence that it was a time-consumingand costly effort to get to the bottom of a series of undercover events in the Moriches Bayarea. A UFO crash/retrieval? I cannot say, but the report is worthy of study. To me, itappears that LIUFON may have been subjected to the ploys of disinformation. Len Stringfield's reprint of report from Long Island UFO Network (LIUFON), New York: Long Island UFO Network (LIUFON), New York: 'INTRODUCTION 'The Long Island UFO Network has publicly stated since October 1989, that a UFOincident occurred over Moriches Bay in the northwest quadrant of this shallow bodyof water on the South Shore of Long Island. Located adjacent to this Bay are theareas of Shirley, Mastic, Mastic Beach, Center Moriches, Moriches, East Moriches,South Hampton, Quogue and Smith's Point Beach. This body of water and itsadjoining communities are also the highest areas of the UFO activity in SuffolkCounty. 'The Long Island UFO Network, Inc., and its staff have investigated this case forsome 12 months. The Network has interviewed to date some 16 witnesses who havehad either eyewitness knowledge of the actual sighting or related contributinginformation to this continuing investigation. These witnesses have either beenpersonally interviewed at either their homes or by phone. Some have only briefly"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"related their information to us and then declined further cooperation out of fear orgovernment reprisals. 'It is the purpose of this paper to bring a concise report of The Long Island UFONetwork's investigation to date so as to better inform the membership and public asto the findings surrounding this event. Based on the accumulated circumstantialevidence, we maintain that the United States Government, through the actions of thearmed forces and the intelligence services, intercepted and retrieved an alienspacecraft from the waters of Moriches Bay on September 28, 1989. This action wasa carefully planned and executed operation that was meticulously formulated somesix months in advance. THE CONNECTICUT SIGHTINGS 'At 7:10 p.m. (Eastern) on the night of September 28, 1989, a young aerospaceengineer in Torrington reported to noted UFO investigator, Philip Imbrogno, that hehad observed a half-circle of very bright lights in the distance. Observing them fromhis home, he studied them through binoculars and determined that the object and itslight were at an altitude of at least fifteen hundred feet at a distance of at least a mileand a half away. He stated that the object was hovering and that he observed it forat least several minutes. He saw the object eventually move, heading towards theNorth. 'Some thirty miles to the North in and around Torrington, motorists on Interstate 91reported seeing a dark mass at low altitude composed of six to eight very brightamber lights slowly moving above them. These witnesses reported to PhilipImbrogno that the object was silent and blended into the night sky. They also statedthat it was huge and larger than a football field in size. This is based on thetestimony of witnesses who stated that the object was able to blot out the night skyas it passed over the highway. It so startled them that they had to pull their cars overto watch it pass. 'Later, there were reports that the object was seen in and around Hartford and WestHartford between 7:50 PM and 8:00 PM. Again, witnesses described an objectcomposed of six to eight very large, bright amber lights. 'Later, at Hartford's International Airport, around 8:10 PM, airport workers observeda large boomerang object hovering above an unused tarmac at the airport that night.They watched as it lowered five alien creatures in a blue beam of light onto theground. It is reported that they gave chase to one of the creatures and watched as itwas lifted upwards into the object by another blue beam of light. Later that night,they are instructed by F.A.A. officials to keep silent about the incident. Severalweeks later, a confidential source gave the information to Phil Imbrogno on theprovision that his identity was never to be revealed. The object was described as alarge boomerang, greater in size than a football field. It also had six large amberlights. 'At 8:05 PM, it was reported at Merrington. At 8:15 PM, in Trumbul, Milford andEaston. At 8:25 PM in Bridgeport, it was reportedly seen by motorists heading on aNorth-East course heading in the direction of Long Island. Heading on a South-easterly course, it would be in the area of eastern Long Island in a matter of minutes. 'With all these sightings in Connecticut, the news media paid scant notice to themany incidents. In all, Philip Imbrogno stated that he talked to some thirty-threewitnesses. The description was the same in all cases. A very large object composedof six to eight large amber lights of tremendous magnitude was the commondescription. 'In October of 1989, John Ford told Phil Imbrogno of the incident on Long Island. Inthe course of conversation, it was agreed by Imbrogno and Ford not to publiclymention the airport incident or the type of object involved. This was to be kept asecret to serve as a litmus test in order to use its exact description as a yardstick tojudge any witness or government statement concerning the sightings on Long Islandas valid. Only a handful in LIUFON knew that the shape of the object was atriangular or boomerang type of object. It served its purpose well. IN THE BEGINNING 'The date was September 4, 1989. It was twenty-four days before the Moriches Bayincident occurred. John Fitzgerald and his son, Patrick, live in Bayshore. This wasLabor Day, the last day of summer vacation before school began for 15-year-oldPatrick. His father, John, decided that he and Patrick along with his two younger"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"brothers, ages 9 and 11, should go jogging this day. They decided that Gardner'sState Park would be the ideal place for an afternoon run. Piling the boys into thefamily station wagon, John drove the kids over to the nature trail in the park. 'It was about 12:04 PM when John and Patrick were on the trail. John stated that hehad no reason as to why he should have looked behind him when he observed theobject. Patrick states that he turned to look as to where his two younger brotherswere on the trail. 'John related to LIUFON investigators that he believes what he saw came in fromthe northwest heading southeast. He saw a giant, dark-colored boomerang object ofimmense size hovering briefly over an over pass of nearby Sunrise Highway. It wasslowly moving towards them, gliding as he would say, not actually flying like aplane. He also had the impression that the object was floating since it bobbed up anddown slightly. It was dark-colored, either black or dark grey, with no markings. Asthe craft passed overhead, he saw neither windows nor engine nacelles on the craft.Its surface was perfectly smooth. He also noticed that it was unusually quiet whenthe object drew near. There were no bird or insect noises. He estimated that thesighting was about one minute. 'Patrick, when interviewed by LIUFON investigators, related that he looked up tolook for his brothers who were some distance behind them. As he looked, he sawwhat appeared to be a large boomerang object directly above them. It was darkcolored, maybe black. It was smooth surfaced with no markings or windows. It wasabsolutely silent. He noticed that all the normal sounds of bird and insect activityhad ceased which was exactly what his father had reported in his statement toLIUFON. 'The object then passed over them and disappeared. The father later recounted thathe thought he saw a copy of the old YB-49 (Flying Wing), which was developed inthe forties and fifties. This was an impossibility, since that aircraft was terminated inits development in the early fifties. It was, however, the best description he couldgive of what it reminded him of. His son, Patrick, a military scale model enthusiast,described it as possibly being the B-1 (Stealth Bomber) aircraft. Both he and hisfather lacked any real in-depth knowledge of the UFO phenomenon and decidedthat what they saw was a test flight of the B-1 Bomber. It was not until the fall of1990 that they decided to contact LIUFON and make a report, especially when theyread about the Moriches Bay case in local papers. [Editor's Note: The B-1 bomber was never tested officially over Long Island, NewYork. It was produced by Rockwell in Palmdale, California, and tested mostly atEdwards AFB, California. Boeing writes about North American aviation history:\"The B-1 Lancer is a swing-wing bomber intended for high-speed, low-altitudepenetration missions. By the end of 1977, three B-1As had made 118 flights withmore than 21 hours at supersonic speeds. The next version was the B-1B. It firstflew Oct. 18, 1984, could operate at 60,000 feet and had a range of more than 7,000miles.B-1 Bomber, first flight was Dec. 23, 1974.

On Oct. 1, 1986, the B-1B achievedInitial Operational Capability and B-1Bs were based at DyessAFB, Texas; Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota; McConnell AFB,Kansas; Robins AFB, Georgia; and Mountain Home AFB, Idaho.The first combat use of the B-1B was in December 1998 duringoperation Desert Fox, where the aircraft penetrated Iraqi airdefenses to destroy Republican Guard barracks.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"B-2 Bomber, first public flight was 1993. Image courtesy of USAF andNorthrup Grumman.About the B-2 bomber, manufacturer Northrup Grumman says:\"21 B-2s were delivered to Whiteman Air Force Base inMissouri, the first in December 1993.\" Where the B-2 Bomberwas test flown is unknown.]LIUFON Report continues: 'The significance of this case will bemore apparent as the reader of this special report continues toread on. The scientist from Brookhaven Laboratory, in his twomeetings with John Ford, reported that the government wastracking this object since it had been reported in various areas ofthe metropolitan area. The scientist met with Ford in April andJuly of 1990. This case was reported and investigated inNovember of 1990. There was no way he could have known ofthe existence of this case, since LIUFON had not published thisreport until the November issue of the Long Island UFO Update.It was not public knowledge. 'The added significance of this sighting only serves to establish the fact that thescientist was right. There were sightings of large boomerang objects weeks beforethe Moriches Bay incident. SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1989: MORICHES BAY, LONG ISLAND 'Martha and Bruce Richardson are LIUFON investigators. As a husband and wifeteam, they are perhaps the best set of investigators in LIUFON. They are also avidboaters. 'They own a small cabin cruiser which is moored in the Moriches Bay Yacht Clubbasin during boating season. On this particular day, they decided to spend the warmSeptember Sunday out on their boat. 'About 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon, Bruce noticed a group of at least five militaryhelicopters in flight from the East. They were Army Huey helicopters which werepainted dark green. 'As they roared in over the Bay, they formed a single line formation and began to flya counter-clockwise flight rotation around the Bay and over the Dune area ofSmith's Point Beach. This lasted for at least one hour before they left the area on awesterly heading. Both Martha and Bruce felt that this was some sort of trainingexercise, but for what purpose? SMITH'S POINT BEACH, AUGUST 1989 'The government of Suffolk County, New York, through the office of CountyExecutive Halpern, announced in late August of that year the early closing ofSmith's Point Beach County Campgrounds immediately after Labor Day in 1989.The announced reason for the early closing, the first in over 18 years, was due to thecontinuing budgetary crisis in the county government. There was not enough moneyto pay for keeping the campgrounds open past Labor Day. Usually, the practice hasbeen to keep the campgrounds open until late October. 'As a result, there was a hue and a cry from Suffolk campers. Newsday, along withlocal papers ran articles about the crisis. Channels 12 and 55 gave top coverage tothis unfortunate chain of events. 'On the night of September 28, 1989, there would be no campers in the campgroundsto observe the alleged UFO event. There would, however, be isolated surf fisherswho would see something and later talk to LIUFON."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 'During the fall of 1990, the campgrounds were kept open past Labor Day well intolate October as was the usual practice. THE WEST HAMPTON AIR NATIONAL GUARD FACILITY 'The news media in the metropolitan area ran major stories about the trainingprogram. The New York Daily News, The New York Post, The New York Times andNewsday ran major articles about the unique training that the New York State AirNational Guard/Sea Rescue Unit at West Hampton was performing. 'Channels 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 12, and 55 gave coverage to this major honor on the eve ofthe resumption of the nation's Space Shuttle flights. It even showed the Air Guardtraining by jumping out of planes into the ocean off the South shore for the proposedevent. It was major news for Long Island. It was part of the nation's space programagain. 'It seems that Long Island's own was training to recover a spaceship from outside theEarth's atmosphere in case it ditched off the East coast upon takeoff or re-entry. Amajor contract was awarded by NASA to the guard unit to perform the function ofrescuing the crew in case it went down off the East coast. CENTER MORICHES, LONG ISLAND, NEW YORK 'Residents in Center Moriches, who were questioned about the UFO incident in atwelve-block radius from the shoreline of Moriches Bay, reported to LIUFON talesof strange phenomena and unusual military activity. 'Many residents reported that summer periodic outages of their cable TV system andelectric power from the Long Island Power Company. No satisfactory explanationwas given by either company to subscribers. 'Some residents reported that on the night of the incident that they saw strange lightsover the Bay which they thought were parachute flares dropped by the Air Force. 'It was not odd for the residents to say this since many of them were use to theconstant army and air force training drills that summer which had been conductedmuch to the annoyance of the residents over Moriches Bay. Many took it to be theAir Guard training for the space shuttle missions which were to commence that fall. RICHARD STOUT 'Richard Stout is the co-founder of the Long Island UFO Network, Inc. He lives inCenter Moriches, some twelve blocks from the Bay. When he and John Fordestablished the organization in April 1988, they spent thousands of dollarspurchasing photographic and video equipment for the purpose of photographingUFOs. Mr. Stout, alone, spent some $5,000 on extreme low-light sensitivephotographic equipment, along with professional quality 35mm cameras andtelephoto lenses. 'In early September of that year, Mr. Stout's home was burglarized and all hisphotographic and video equipment were taken. A considerable amount of jewelrywas also taken from the home. The other homes were also hit in the neighborhoodthat day by a young man driving an old Pontiac sedan. The police have never caughthim. 'On the night of the incident, both Ford and Stout were some twelve blocks away atthe Stout residence near the Bay. The two did not proceed to the Bay area toinvestigate since the cameras belonging to Stout had been stolen. KINGS PARK, LONG ISLAND, 5:30 PM, SEPTEMBER 28, 1989 'Mrs. Mary McLaughlin is a young housewife with two young boys. She and herhusband live in the Kings Park section of Suffolk County, Long Island. Located onthe North Shore of Long Island, Kings Park is a quiet middle class residential sectionof Suffolk County. 'That afternoon, Mary had the two boys home from school They were in the back ofthe house watching TV in the den. Mary was cleaning the house while dinner wascooking on the kitchen stove. Mary's routine was broken when she responded to theboys' calls to hurry to the den's rear window."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"'One of the boys had observed during the afternoon television session two largeobjects to the North from their house. He brought it to the attention of his youngerbrother who in turn watched them with his older brother. In bewilderment, theycalled for their mother to join them. 'Upon entering the room, Mary observed the two objects from the rear window.What they were, baffled her. There, at a distance of perhaps a mile and a half, weretwo large, triangular objects hovering in the sky. They were motionless, made nosound. She saw no windows, engines, wings or lights on the objects. Their surfaceswere smooth and jet black. One of the objects was to the West while the other wasin the East. The distance between the two was about a mile. In an instant, one objectin the East, moved and joined the westerly object. It had moved up at an angle of 45degrees and covered the distance in a second. 'In October 1990, her husband contacted us. Mary was afraid to talk to LIUFON forfear of ridicule. Instead, her husband John called in the report. 'The estimated size of the objects as seen from their house on Patiky Street in KingsPark was equal to that of an airliner seen at that distance. The objects were of equaldimensions. Both John and Mary are certain it was September 28, 1989, as the dateof the occurrence. 'If correct, this sighting has changed the scope of the entire Moriches Bay incident'sinvestigation. It places two large, triangular objects along the North Shore of LongIsland about two hours before being seen throughout Connecticut. The aerialperformance was beyond the capabilities of known aircraft. EAST MORICHES COAST GUARD STATION 'Beginning about six o'clock on the evening of September 28, 1989, witnesses wholive near the East Moriches Coast Station in East Moriches, Long Island, reportedunusual activity at the Coast Guard Base. Information supplied to LIUFONinvestigators indicate that a heavy influx of both military vehicles and civilian carswere seen along the entrance road to the Base compound. 'Many of the vehicles were left parked along the shoulder of the road when the baseparking lot became filled. The vehicles remained there until late in the night. 'Information indicates that a military road block was imposed on the entrance roadto the base to keep all civilian traffic from entering the area. If this information istrue, a major military activity was underway that night. SHOREHAM, LONG ISLAND'S NORTH SHORE, 8:00 PM, 9/28/91 'Mona Rowe was driving home from an amateur orchestra rehearsal in Shoreham.She was on Route 25 heading West-bound to her home in Setauket. She observed tothe North a formation of large amber lights in the sky. She paid no particularattention to them since she thought that they were either aircraft lights or flares. Thelights just remained motionless in the sky. 'It was not until the month of April 1990 that she was contacted by Cheryl Clark ofThe News Review which is published in Riverhead, Long Island. The purpose was toconfirm the involvement of Brookhaven Laboratories in the Moriches Bay incident.This was due to the story reportedly told by John Ford to a packed audience atRiverhead Library about the incident at a lecture on April 24, 1990. 'It was not until that time when she spoke to Miss Clark did Mrs. Rowe make theconnection of the lights to the Moriches Bay incident. In her official capacity as apublic relations official for Brookhaven Laboratories, she answered questions aboutthe allegations made by Ford. 'Mrs. Rowe also witnessed the Moriches Bay object in its flight over Long Island'snight-time sky. Mrs. Rowe was quoted in the April 26, 1990, edition of The NewsReview's story about the Moriches Bay incident. CALVERTON, LONG ISLAND, 8:00 PM, 9/28/89 'Mrs. P. G. and her fifteen-year-old son were on their way home from Hicksville onthe night of September 28, 1989. P. G. had gone into Hicksville to pick up herteenage son who had spent the day with relatives in the area. They were on the LongIsland Expressway, in the area of Calverton, Long Island, a very rural area of theIsland with some farmland and woods."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 'They were eastbound towards their home in Riverhead when Mrs. P. G. noticed sixlarge, bright amber lights over a field in the southeast from the expressway. Thelights she first thought were similar to headlights, but were very large. 'It wasn't until she and her son got closer that she noticed the lights belonged to avery large triangular object. It was silhouetted against the night sky and appeared tobe at least twice the size of a football field. The surface of the object appeared to beof a very dark texture, but the surrounding light from the area illuminated itsufficiently to give an outline of the object. She and her son were under theimpression that it was something flown out of the Grumman Test Facility inCalverton a few miles away. 'P. G. and her son continued on their way to Riverhead. It wasn't until after the April1989 Riverhead Library talk given by LIUFON that she gave a brief report to JohnFord. She refused to submit a sighting report, but gave a drawing of the object toFord along with a brief summary of the sighting. She also positively identified thephotographs of the Moriches Bay object as being the same thing she saw overCalverton that night. 'P. G.'s identity is known to LIUFON. She lives in the Riverhead area of Long Islandand is a New York State Civil Service employee. A reluctant witness, her sighting istaken seriously and places at least one of the objects in the Calverton area at leastone hour before the incident over Moriches Bay. SOUTHHAMPTON COLLEGE, 8:00-8:30 PM, 9/28/89 'Susan G. is a reluctant witness. Her cooperation has been limited in thisinvestigation. She did talk to LIUFON twice this year over the phone concerning herinvolvement in this incident. 'Susan states that she was driving home with her young daughter from Water Millwhere she had been performing in a children's dance recital that evening. She wasdriving home a little after 8:00 PM on North Highway in Southhampton. She washeading West when she saw about a mile before Southhampton College a half circleof six to eight very large amber lights hovering over the highway. The lights were asintense as stadium lights. She could not see a structure behind the lights, but saw adark mass and assumed that the lights were attached to it since they moved together. 'She stopped the car and swung it around to follow the object and learn what it was.It was South of her position and was very high in the sky. She estimated it at least500 feet minimum altitude. The size of the thing she estimated to be at least 500 to1,000 feet across. She, her husband and children live on a one acre lot inSouthhampton and the object's size was greater than the width of her home plot. 'Pursuing the eastbound object, she reached the intersection of Tuccohoe Lanewhere she turned South and followed it to the shoreline. As she neared the end ofTuccohoe Lane near the water, the lights of the object turned off and whatever itwas blended away into the night sky. It was gone. 'Susan related that the object blended in with the night sky and was totally silentwith no engine sounds discernible. Susan reported the lights were unnaturally brightand lit up the night sky. 'Her sighting is important since what she saw was one of the two objects involved inthe incident. It also places one of the objects off the coastline of the Southhamptonand West Southhampton area where later an intense military air-sea rescue operationwould be undertaken which was confirmed by government documents andeyewitnesses.'\"ontinued in Part 24 - Eyewitness Describes Moriches Bay 'UFO Retrieval'Credits"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
