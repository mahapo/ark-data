Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. Leonard H. Stringfield: \"Epilogue: The Credentials Factor: Narrowing the Gap On this day, June 1, 1982, as I write the Epilogue for this Status Report III, I mustretrogress to say that at times when new, substantive information emerged, I felt I was onthe brink of breakthrough. But deep inside, I knew that to even hint of a breakthrough inthis status report - no matter how great the source or the testimony - would be too brash ofan assumption. Testimony is subject to human interpretive error, to say the least, andtestimony alone is not proof. Rest assured, however, I do have my opinions on the subjectof UFO Crash/Retrievals and gut feelings about each of my sources. But to borrow a pagefrom scientific rationale, I offer no conclusion. Also, no apologies for withholding the names of my sources and some of their supportdata. My grounds for not doing so are ethical, legal and, in some instances, a matter ofnational security. Nonetheless, just for the hell of it, let us suppose that I did resort toperfidy and named some, or all, of my key sources. With the tables turned, I am sure thatmany in responsible positions would be left with no alternative but to deny their testimony,fearing reprisal and/or invasion of privacy and exploitation by opportunists. Countlessothers who might come forward never would Without names, I realize that my published works can simply be relegated to hearsay.However, there are other ways to present and keep alive a credible case for UFOCrash/Retrievals. One is found in the following statement written and signed in mypresence by researchers of respectful credentials which, I believe, speaks adequately formy endeavor: 'Dear Len ... We want to thank you and Dell (wife) for your hospitality during theMarch 20-21, 1982, weekend, when you reviewed with us certain documents,letters, tapes and other information from sources claiming some knowledge of UFOcrash/retrievals. You also arranged for us to talk with or hear two first-handclaimants and one intermediary. We would like to make the following points, whichyou may quote in full or part: 1) We affirm that the information you are receiving is substantial and credible, inthat much of it emanates from persons in responsible positions, usually present orformer military officers or enlisted men with Intelligence or Security units. 2) As you discussed with us, you are aware that any given case could be a hoax or adisinformation ploy by people whose interest is to suppress the truth or confuse theissue. However, we agree that it is extremely unlikely all of the information from somany independent sources over so many years could be a hoax. 3) As you demonstrated to us, you have investigated within the resources available"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"to you background information about the people and events implicated in thecrash/retrieval reports, and your intent in publishing the reports is to help prove ordisprove them, individually and collectively. 4) We ourselves have provide crash/retrieval leads or other information to you andassisted you in checking facts or details in some cases. 5) We feel that the work you are doing is vitally important and should continue, andthat other researchers should support your efforts in every way possible. 6) Some researchers who criticize you underestimate the complexity,time-consuming nature and costliness of trying to elicit information from reluctantand fearful witnesses, many of whom fear reprisals. These critics show a lack ofappreciation for the sensitive nature of your investigations and the possibleconsequences for some of the informants. 7) Finally, we both respect and commend your firmness in refusing to releasewitnesses names. This appears to us to be the correct, ethical and humane approachunder difficult circumstances, and the one most likely to yield significantinformation. Peter Rank, M.
