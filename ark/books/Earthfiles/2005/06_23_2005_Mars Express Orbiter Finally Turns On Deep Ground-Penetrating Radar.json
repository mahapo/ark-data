Illustration by ESA. June 23, 2005 Darmstadt, Germany - I learned something amazing today from the MarsExpress Orbiter Spacecraft Operations Manager. He is Michel Denis based at theEuropean Space Agency's office in Darmstadt, Germany. I was getting an update about theplans for the deep ground-penetrating radar on ESA's Mars Express Orbiter which wasturned on for the first time at 3 p.m. Pacific. The amazing fact I learned was that a monthago on May 7th, the Mars Express Orbiter and NASA's two spacecraft, the Odyssey andthe Mars Global Surveyor could have collided!Mr. Denis said ESA received a call from NASA on April 29th about calculations thatshowed all three spacecraft orbiters would be going to their lowest point in orbit about 250to 300 kilometers above the Mars surface. And there could be an intersection point orcollision on May 7th. NASA asked ESA if they would change the orbit of the MarsExpress Orbiter slightly to avoid the potential catastrophe and so they did. But who wouldthink that only three orbiters on Mars could periodically face a traffic jam?!In April, NASA's Mars Global Surveyor actually photographed NASA's Mars Odyssey andESA's Mars Express.This image of the European Space Agency's Mars Express spacecraft was takenby the Mars Orbiter Camera on NASA's Mars Global Surveyor in April 2005.

He has shared the science team'sfrustration that it has taken an entire year to finally deploy the three radar booms whichwere supposed to have been operational in April 2004. The radar are composed of two20-meter antennae and one 7-meter antenna made out of fiberglass and kevlar. Themanufacturer was afraid that computer simulations showed the unfurling of the radarmight have damaged the Mars Express Orbiter and jeopardized all the other importantscientific instruments onboard. So software was tweaked over the past 12 months andfinally today was the day for the first radar operation.Now for the next ten days, the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and IonosphereSounding known more simply as the MARSIS antennas will be turned on three times a dayto calibrate the complicated instrument. The goals is to use the MARSIS radar to \"see\" intotop 3 miles or 5 kilometers - of the Martian crust to look for water ice, or even liquid waterunder pressure. Atmospheric scientists - such as Vittorio Formisano in Italy want to see ifthe radar finds any underground structures that might contain ice or water to see if there isany match to what has been seen in the Martian atmosphere. Dr. Formisano, for example,has reported higher water molecule, methane and possibly formaldehyde gasconcentrations in the atmosphere above three regions along the Martian equator. He thinksthose concentrations might indicate sub-surface ice or even water at pressurized depths.But now there's another problem. In order to do reasonably accurate deep ground-penetrating radar investigation, the radar needs to be turned on when the Mars ExpressOrbiter is at its closest to the Martian surface. That's about 270 kilometers and onlyhappens periodically in the orbiter's very elliptical orbit which swings all the way out to10,000 kilometers and then back to the 270 kilometers. And when the orbiter is closest tothe Martian ground, it needs to be night time so the sunlight won't ionize the atmosphereand interfere with the radar's clarity. However, by mid-July, when the orbiter is at itslowest orbital spots, it will be in Martian sunlight. It won't be until early December that thelowest points of the Mars Express orbiter will finally match up with Martian nights. Andthat's when the real science will begin.I asked Michael McKay this week if he personally expected the MARSIS radar would finda lot of water ice underground in the three miles of Martian crust the radar can explore?Interview:Michael McKay, Flight Operations Director, European Space Agency, Darmstadt,Germany: \"Personally I can give a personal opinion here. I believe so. I think there is stilla lot of ice in the upper surface of Mars. We've seen it around the South Pole, so we've had"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"quite a bit of permafrost. And there are also indications of water vapor and methane incombination around the equator. I think this radar will take the understanding of planets toanother level whenever it operates.AND IF THERE IS LIQUID WATER, WILL THE RADAR BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISHBETWEEN LIQUID WATER AND WATER ICE?The radar looks at the reflection between different surfaces between rock or ice or rockand water. And it's based on interpreting that reflection. Liquid water would only exist onMars when it's under substantial pressure. The atmosphere on Mars is 1/6000th of what wehave here on Earth. So consequently, the ice would go straight from ice form to vapor. Itwon't go through a liquid phase.ON THE SURFACE.On the surface. It requires enormous pressure. So, if there is sufficient pressure under thesurface of Mars and whatever ice is there is at the right temperature, then yes it could existin liquid form.AND 5 KILOMETERS DOWN, WOULD THE PRESSURE BE ENOUGH THAT IFTHERE IS ICE THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED INTO LIQUID WATER ATTHAT DEPTH?It is possible.THAT'S WHERE THE POSSIBILITY OF THE METHANE CONCENTRATIONS ANDOTHER GASES IN THREE AREAS THAT DR. FORMISANO''S WORK AND OTHERSHAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM? THE IDEA IS CAN YOU LOOK BELOW ANDSEE IF LIQUID ICE OR WATER ARE IN THOSE AREAS?[ Editor's Note: The three regions over which Vittorio Formisano, Ph.D., (head of thePSF atmospheric molecule analysis on Mars Express Orbiter) reported finding higherconcentrations of water molecules, methane and possibly formaldehyde are: ArabiaTerra; Elysium Planum; and Arcadia-Memnonia. ]Arabia Terra, Elysium Planum and Arcadia-Memnonia (not shown in this map) are regions near the Martianequator.That is what we are hoping to achieve. To understand exactly what lies below the surfaceof Mars and in what regions. As I said earlier, there are some very significant high prioritytargets that I'm sure from a scientific interest point of view, we will want to go over andexamine very carefully with the radar to try to put a better picture together not justmapping the atmosphere and looking at the surface with a stereo camera, but also putting anew dimension to what is lying below and might be responsible for forming the featuresthat we see only on the surface at the moment.\" MARSIS Radar \"Detects Interfaces, Changes In Structure\"Michelle Denis: \"MARSIS is not technically looking for liquid water under pressure orwater ice. It detects interfaces, changes in structure, from something that is soft tosomething that is hard, from something of a certain density to something to a differentdensity. If you think of rocks on the Earth, it will differentiate between sediment andvolcanic lava. So, MARSIS even if it does not find water ice or liquid water, it might revealall sorts of complex structures at various depths inside the Martian ground which inanalogy with the Earth. That is what the MARSIS ground-penetrating radar is all about:"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"telling you there is a change of structure and under the surface can distinguish a hill from avalley or canyon.WITHIN THE UPPER 3 MILES (5 KILOMETERS) OF MARTIAN CRUST, WEWOULD BE ABLE TO TELL IF THERE WERE SUBTERRANEAN CAVERNS?Oh, yes. If there were big hollows and tunnels in the crust on Mars, MARSIS should beable to differentiate, but it would appear only as transitions and structures in the radar. Sowe would have to go there to know for sure.\" Mars Express Orbiter Budget To BeExtended Until December 2007Because of the year delay in getting the MARSIS radar operational, the European SpaceAgency's 15 nation constituency will soon vote to authorize more funding for another twoyears. The life time left in the batteries on Mars Orbiter Express might also expire in twoto three years.Websites: ESA Mars Express: http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Mars_Express/index.html NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/mgs-images.html Vittorio Formisano: http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMAK21XDYD_Life_0.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
