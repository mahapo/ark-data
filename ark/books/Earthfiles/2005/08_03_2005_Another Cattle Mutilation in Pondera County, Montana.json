Twenty-seven years ago in 1975-1976,one center of animal mutilation activity was around Great Falls, MalmstromAFB and the Minuteman missile sites in Cascade County.14 Cattle Mutilations Reported to Pondera County Sheriff's Office(6 more unofficially reported) in 2001: June 12, 2001 - Don Reishus, Depuyer (Pondera County) - Mutilated cow.June 12, 2001 - Karl Rappold, Depuyer (Pondera County) - Alive bull withsevered tail.June 26, 2001 - Mark Taliaferro, Depuyer (Pondera County) - Mutilated cowwith blue-green color on jaw tissue.August 6, 2001 - Steve Young, Fort Shaw (Cascade County) - Mutilated cow.August 15, 2001 - Larry Elings, Browning (Glacier County) - Mutilatedyearling.August 15, 2001 - Doug Banka, Belt (Cascade County) - Mutilated cow.August 31, 2001 - Gerald Miller, Conrad (Pondera County) - Mutilated cow.September 24, 2001 - Jim Vandenbos, Conrad (Pondera County ) - Mutilatedcow with \"burned off\" hair.October 6, 2001 - Everett King, Valier (Pondera County) - MutilatedCharolais cow in impact crater.October 21, 2001 - New Miami Hutterite Colony, Dupuyer (Pondera County)- TWO mutilated cows.October 28, 2001 - Robert Lettenga, Conrad (Pondera County) - Mutilatedcow.November 1, 2001 - Glen Bouma, Conrad (Pondera County) - Mutilated8-month-old steer calf.December 8, 2001 - Dan Majerus, Conrad (Pondera County) - Mutilated13-year-old cow. August 3, 2005 Conrad, Montana - Cattle mutilations have started again in PonderaCounty, Montana. Back in 2001, the county's sheriff had received fourteen official reports,knew that other surrounding counties were experiencing the phenomenon, and suspectedthat many more mutilations had occurred in the Pondera region that were not being"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"officially reported. One of the Pondera County ranching families, Mark and SaraTaliaferro, had an unusual cow death in June 2001 on their Depuyer, Montana ranch westof Conrad.

Photograph © 2001 by Pondera County Sheriff's Office.Then on June 9, 2005, Mark found one of his steer calves dead in a pasture less than twomiles from his family's ranch house. He called the Pondera Sheriff's office and Sheriff TomKuka visited to see the animal and take photographs. Sheriff Kuka was elected inNovember 2004, and has worked in law enforcement the past twenty-two years afterattending the Law Enforcement Academy in Bozman, Montana. He called me last week infrustration about the many animals lost to the mutilation phenomenon four years ago, nowanother steer calf, and the question: how many more could die with the bizarre, bloodlesscuts yet this year?Interview:Sheriff Thomas A. Kuka, Pondera County Sheriff's Office, Conrad, Montana: \"Thislatest June 2005, mutilated steer calf was also on the Mark Taliaferro ranch in Depuyer,but a little south of that last one there in June 2001. This one was still within less than twomiles from their ranch house. This seems to be common. Even though the mutilations areclose to a residence, no one seems to see or hear anything. Or at least nothing out of theordinary and nothing to alarm them at the time.\"I w as not cal l ed in ti me to see w here rancher Mark Tal i aferr o had found hi m i n the pasture.When I got there, they had loaded the animal into the back of a pickup truck and brought him to the yard.But the steer calf was killed in the general vicinity of the last mutilation they had in 2001.\"Investigated and photographed by Pondera County Sheriff Tom Kuka.As I was walking up to the truck, it seemed to be a fairly recent death. There wasn't muchrigor set in. The animal was not swollen or changed much from being alive. They musthave found it very recently. There weren't any flies. That seemed odd to me. It was asunny morning when I got there and it was fairly warm out. There should have been moreflies around.WHAT DID MARK TALIAFERRO AND SARA TELL YOU ABOUT WHEN THEYHAD LAST SEEN THE STEER CALF ALIVE AND HOW LONG THEY THOUGHT ITHAD BEEN DEAD?The steer calf was with a lot of other ones and I'm not sure they actually saw this one. Ifyou look at one of the photos, he has an I.D. in his ear '304.' If they saw calf 304, theydidn't know when that was. But all the cattle had been in that pasture together and the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Taliaferros had put them up pretty recently. That was probably a breeding pasture and theywould have been keeping a close watch over them. In fact, the ranchers were fixing fenceup there and that's why they noticed it right away when they saw it was down.In fact, I think it was the mother of the calf that was causing all sorts of commotion andbrought attention to herself and they checked out what she was doing and found the deadcalf.IF IT WERE A WEEK OLD, THE LACK OF FLIES AND THE GOOD PRESERVATIONOF THE CALF WOULD BE REMARKABLE. IF IT WAS JUST THE NIGHT BEFORE,THEN THAT WOULD PLACE THE UNUSUAL DEATH BETWEEN JUNE 8 ANDJUNE 9, 2005?My idea when I handled the animal was that it happened the night before the deathbecause there was no rigor, there was nothing. We had that other one at Taliaferros back in2001 and they seemed to decompose quite a bit by the time we've always gotten to thembefore, where this one had not. So, it had to be relatively fresh. There was no bad odorsyet. It was quite fresh. Circular, Deep Excision of Rectal Tissue - Cauterized?Circular, deep excision of rectal and internal tissue from Mark Taliaferro's steer calf.Photograph by Pondera County Sheriff Tom Kuka.My photograph of the rectum area of the calf - the hole was shifted somewhat by the waythe animal was laying on that tailgate. But to me, it was just an almost perfectly round,surgical cut. It was almost as if it was cauterized. There was no bleeding and didn't appearto be any disturbance of other tissues just straight in as far as we could see into it.THE HOLE APPEARS TO HAVE A DARKENED EDGE?It did. It's almost as if they were cutting and cauterized it. Is there equipment available todo that?THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF THE CONFUSIONS BECAUSE WHEN DR. JOHNALTSHULER IN DENVER WAS HELPING ME DO ANALYSIS ON MUTILATEDANIMAL TISSUES, HE WENT TO A GYNECOLOGIST TO GET SLIDES OF KNOWNLASER SURGERY. WHEN WE LOOKED UNDER A MICROSCOPE ANDCOMPARED THE KNOWN LASER SURGERY TO THE TISSUE I WAS COLLECTINGFROM THE FIELD, THIS WAS THE PUZZLE. WE ALWAYS FOUND CARBONRESIDUE IN THE SURGERIES THAT HAD BEEN DONE BY KNOWN LASEREQUIPMENT. BUT IN THE ANIMAL MUTILATIONS, WE NEVER FOUND CARBONRESIDUE. THAT PROVOKED DR. ALTSHULER TO SAY HE DID NOT KNOW WHATTHE CUTTING INSTRUMENT IS.It looks odd to me. I grew up on a ranch. I've seen what happens to these animals afterbirds of prey, coyotes or whatever else you might have around there. There is never anydamage like that. Nothing that those animals do look like this photograph. There wouldhave been way more cutting marks. I think there would have been blood and other tissuesdestroyed. But there was nothing else touched or damaged. You have to have quite a bit ofprecision to do that."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Hole Where Castrated Scrotum Had Been.Was Penis Removed Also?Taliaferros had previously castrated calf, but remaining scrotum tissue - and possibly entire penis tissueinside belly? - were excised at hole near the steer calf's undeveloped teats. Photograph by Pondera CountySheriff Tom Kuka.Another photo I took is of the groin area of the steer calf. It was rather odd that they choseto make a hole there. Once again, you can see by the way the animal is laying there thatthe hole was probably more rounded when I was there to look at it, but in the photograph,they had moved the calf. But this animal had been castrated shortly after birth. I think theyput a rubber band on the testicles and there would have been nothing there.Those four small teats, steers still have small, undeveloped teats. They never develop morethan what's in the photo. But the scrotum and testicles were gone and I'm not sure what themutilators were trying to get there. If the penis was gone, too, I'm not medically inclinedenough to go in there and look, I guess. In the photo, I'm casting a shadow on the bellywhere the penis should have been with my hand. It's hard to see. If it's there or not, I wishI could say and studied more.THE PENIS ITSELF WOULD HAVE EXITED THE CALF FROM WHERE YOURHAND SHADOW IS, SORT OF NEAR THE MID-BELLY. BUT THE QUESTION ISWHETHER OR NOT THE HOLE WHERE THE UNDEVELOPED TEATS AREWOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO PULL THE PENIS OUT AND CUT IT OFF?Right, but even the picture of the calf on the tailgate where you can see the whole calf - ifyou look dead center, you can see where the tuft of hair is around urination hole. But Idon't know if penis was there or not.Close-up of hair around urination hole at middle of steer calf's belly.No necropsy done, so not known if penis removed inside abdomen.Photo by Pondera County Sheriff Tom Kuka.The way we castrate our calves, we leave that scrotum in place. We have a device thatcuts the cord off to the testicles while they are still intact and leaves the scrotum there andeventually, they disintegrate inside there.But you can feel right above the testicles (going toward mid-belly) where the penis is andyou have to be extremely careful not to pinch that with the testicle cord-cutting device oryou'll stop the urination tract and the animal will die. So, it's very important not to crushthere and that's right where the hole is in the calf in the photograph."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Right Eyeball, Optic Nerve and Bone \"Cored Out\"Right eyeball, optic nerve and bone \"cored out\" of steer calf.Photograph by Pondera County Sheriff Tom Kuka.If you look at the photo that shows the head with the ear tag, 304, on it, that right eye isgone. We also rolled the steer over and out of that empty eye socket poured 8 ccsapproximately of blood. That was odd because all the other mutilated animals I've workedwith never had any blood in the eye sockets. Once again, it was like the same tool wasused in the eye. It was precisely, surgically removed, it appeared to me. It was a veryround, cylindrical cut straight in - the mutilators would have gotten the eyeball and maybesome of the nerve behind it? Is that a common practice they do?YES, NECROPSIES ON OTHER MUTILATED ANIMALS HAVE CONFIRMED THEOPTIC NERVE WAS TAKEN AS WELL AS EYEBALL.I don't know if you are familiar with a hole saw you would use to drill a hole in a door toput a doorknob in? It was something similar to that. It looked as though an instrument wentin, cut, cauterized, and removed this like a core sample from this animal. It apparentlycaused some bleeding because when we rolled it over, the blood poured out.ONLY FROM THE EYE.Only from the eye.WHEN YOU LOOKED DOWN INSIDE THE EYE SOCKET, IT LOOKED AS IFSOMETHING LIKE A BIOPSY INSTRUMENT HAD PENETRATED INTO THESOCKET BONE BEHIND THE EYEBALL TISSUE?Yes, everything was removed. I've hunted all my life and had to field dress animals. I'vecut animals for the meat and steaks. All of these cuts nothing could I do that wouldduplicate this! When they drilled in there, they cut it off and removed a core and then itdid not bleed, or very little. They did it so symmetrically there is no way a human could doit with a knife. You would need pretty precise equipment.From my own experience, you can't remove anything like that in that exact size withoutdoing other damage to that head area. The hole went down in there at least 3 inches, if notfurther. You can't just stick a knife in there and cut around that hole and remove it thatway because you are going to pry on the edge and the eyelid is going to get damaged. It'sphysically impossible, at least for me to do it.Left side of steer's head totally untouched.Photograph by Pondera County Sheriff Tom Kuka."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The other thing I noticed on this animal was that no hide skin was missing on the head orneck. All the other animals we have investigated always had that missing hide from the jaw I guess it was the left side usually?IT COULD BE THE LEFT SIDE OR RIGHT SIDE. BUT I AGREE THAT IN THECLASSIC MUTILATIONS OF THE PAST 50 YEARS, ALMOST ALWAYS SOME OFTHE TISSUE IS TAKEN FROM ONE SIDE OF THE JAW, OR BOTH SIDES, ORAROUND THE MUZZLE. BUT IN THIS STEER CALF, THE FACE IS SO CLEAN ANDIT APPEARS THAT ONLY THE EYE ON THE RIGHT SIDE HAS BEEN REMOVED,ALONG WITH THE OPTIC NERVE AND BONE GOING INSIDE. BUT THERE ISALSO THE SEVERED TONGUE. Tip of Tongue Cut Off At 45 Degree AngleTip of steer calf's tongue cut off on 45 degree angle, according to PonderaCounty Sheriff Tom Kuka, who took this photograph.Yes, the tongue was interesting. It was cut at almost a 45 degree angle across there. Sorrymy photo doesn't show it so clearly. The other mutilations we have seen, the tongues weregone completely deep in the throat. Why did they just take the tip of this one and at thatangle? I'm at a loss again.INSTEAD OF A SHARP INSTRUMENT CUTTING THE TONGUE AT A 45 DEGREEANGLE, COULD IT HAVE BEEN A MAGPIE?No, no. I don't see any reason to believe a natural predator could have done that. Law Enforcement Theories About Mutilators?Greeley Tribune, Greeley, Colorado, Sunday, November 2, 1980.WHEN YOU ARE TOGETHER WITH OTHER DEPUTIES AND SHERIFFS, WHAT DOYOU PRIVATELY TALK ABOUT AS POSSIBLE PERPETRATORS BEHIND THEUNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHS?Of course, there is always the idea that it's aliens. Usually there is a lot of joking about itgoing on.DO YOU THINK THERE IS ENOUGH HIGH STRANGENESS TO JUSTIFY THAT AS"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"AN EXPLANATION?I do, yes. I guess I'm not thoroughly convinced of it, but there has to be some sort ofexplanation for this. That certainly is possible. Where we are is a fairly sparsely populatedarea. There could be a lot of things that happen and nobody ever sees it. But where this isgoing on is right next to these peoples' houses. There are no obstructions due to trees. Alittle bit of rolling hills. But if you weren't flying, you would have to use the roads that goright by the houses. The people would notice. There would be evidence of vehicles. Butthere is no evidence of that here.USUALLY RANCHERS HAVE DOGS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS IMPRESSEDME IS HOW MANY TIMES THERE HAVE BEEN MUTILATIONS FOUND CLOSE TORANCH HOUSES WHERE THERE WERE DOGS IN THE HOUSE AT NIGHT. BUTTHE DOGS DON'T BARK.Nothing has brought attention in the mutilations here either. In this instance of the steercalf, it was the mother's crying and agitation that caused the ranchers to pay attentionwhile they were fixing the fence. The biggest thing I want to know is: what could youpossibly gain from this? I guess that's my biggest thing: why is this happening?WHY HAS IT BEEN HAPPENING FOR SO LONG TOTALLY UNSTOPPED ANDTHERE HAS NOT BEEN A SINGLE ARREST OR ARRAIGNMENT IN ANYCOUNTRY ON THIS PLANET ON A CATTLE MUTILATION CHARGE. THE OTHERSUGGESTION HAS BEEN THAT THE REASON FOR THIS, IF WE ARE DEALINGWITH ANOTHER INTELLIGENCE, IS A GENETIC HARVEST. THAT'S WHAT THEYWANT, THE GENETIC MATERIAL OR FOOD.Why return the animal? Why not take the whole thing?IT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION. I BEGAN ASKING THE SAME THING 26 YEARSAGO AND THE ONLY CONSENSUS AMONG LAW ENFORCEMENT I'VE TALKEDTO AND AMONG OTHER RESEARCHERS IS IT'S LIKE A CALLING CARD, ACOMMUNICATION, THAT WHATEVER IS DOING THIS IS SAYING, 'THIS IS WHATWE CAN DO AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO STOP IT.' SO IT'S SORTOF INTIMIDATING.Very possible.
