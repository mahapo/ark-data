And they (alien beings)proceeded to take these machines and go into different areas of the body and cutthem and extract the blood out for food.\"- Roger Vail, Musician July 4, 2005 Mid-West - Roger Vail was born in the mid-West in 1944 and joined the U.S. Navy in 1963. He went through electronic technician school and intended to have amilitary career. But an injury in his first military year meant an early honorable dischargein 1964. After that, he went to Western Illinois University to work on a physics major, butswitched to a Mass Communications major. Then, music and travel pulled him awaybefore he completed his undergraduate degree, and Roger spent the next 21 years playingguitar and bass. Finally, in 1985, he finished his B. A. with an emphasis on radio and TVproduction.Through it all, Roger Vail was haunted by a conscious experience he had in the early 1970son a car trip with a friend through Colorado to California. The two had stopped to campnear Cheyenne Mountain above Colorado Springs. The local media was reporting aboutmysterious, unsolved deaths of cattle, horses and other farm animals that law enforcementcalled \"mutilations\" because ears, eyes, jaw flesh, tongues, genitals and rectal tissue were\"surgically excised\" without blood from hundreds, if not thousands, of animals. Roger Vailcontacted me recently about what happened on that camp out in the early 1970s.Interview:Roger Vail, Musician, Mid-West: \"I had studied Tibetan telepathy a lot and I sat there(camp site) for about an hour mentally communicating, trying to find out what was goingon with the animal mutilations. I saw this light came down and the next thing I knew, I wasinside the craft and being given a tour. That's the way it started. I had full hair down to mywaist and a beard, like a hippy. So, I was strange to the beings on board the craft becausemost humans aren't hairy like that.WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THE LIGHT?The light was like a cyan color, greenish-blue, slightly yellow and it had very distinct edgeson it. It was sort of like a conduit of light not a laser. It was like it would cut around themolecules, or this is how the ETs explained it to me, and that they used the light as awaveguide and anything inside that light, they could bring up and down.YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT SEEING A BEAM OF LIGHT COMING OUT OF THEMOVING LIGHT THAT STOPS AND THEN THE COW ROSE UP IN THE BEAM OFLIGHT?No, I was aboard the ship when they brought the cow in.THEN LET'S GO BACK TO WHERE YOU WERE IN MEDITATION AND PLEASETRY TO GIVE ME MORE OF A SECOND-BY-SECOND DESCRIPTION FROM THETIME THAT YOU SEE THE LIGHT IN THE SKY AND WHAT HAPPENS.OK, I was sitting there and I just got the sense that they were communicating back to meand all of a sudden, I saw the silvery craft at maybe a 45-degree angle from me. Then thelight came all over me and I went up there into the ship and was there.DID YOU GO UP INTO THE SHIP INSIDE A BEAM OF LIGHT?Yeah.CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT YOUR EYES COULD SEE WHEN YOU WERE INTHAT BEAM OF LIGHT?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"It was sort of like a mist. It was like I was inside a colored tube of light. I could see themist around me. You could see a slight barrier around the outer edges and I was right in themiddle of the light and it was pretty big maybe 3 to 4 meters in diameter.WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THE LIGHT?From the inside, it was a little bit more green and yellow than the blue from the outside. Itlooked different on the outside than it did from the inside. It was very similar to the colorsyou have on computers. I'm looking at mine right now and it was very similar to that color,but not quite as green more yellow.HOW DID YOU GET FROM THE GROUND IN MEDITATION TO INSIDE THE TUBEOF LIGHT?It came and got me. I saw the light and it got smaller and then bigger. It started out as apoint and then came right around me and I went right up inside it.WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE TO YOUR SKIN AND MIND BEING INSIDE THAT BEAMOF LIGHT?My skin kind of tingled a little bit - more of a chill. A slight cold, kind of a rushing breezyeffect, but no wind. I was just real curious what was going on with the cattle mutilations.SO, WHEN YOU WERE INSIDE THE TUBE OF BLUISH-GREENISH-YELLOWLIGHT, YOU ACTUALLY FELT A COLD TEMPERATURE?Yes, it was cool. And there was no stress on me at all.HOW FAST DID YOU RISE IN THAT BEAM OF LIGHT?Like complete acceleration from zero to 200 in a matter of second. Then I stopped just asquickly. I had no inertia. You could barely feel it take off. There wasn't that big of a pull tostart with and then when it stopped, there wasn't any stop inertia less than an elevator.WHEN YOU WERE GOING IN THE BEAM UP TO THE CRAFT SO RAPIDLY, DIDYOU HAVE ANY LOOK DOWN EITHER THROUGH THE BEAM OR FROM THECRAFT AND DOWN TO THE GROUND WHERE YOU HAD JUST BEEN SITTING?No. It was like opaque from the inside of the light. You couldn't see through it. Then I wascoming through into an area and having doors open and walking in.WHAT WAS THE SHAPE OF THE DOORS?They were like square with rounded corners on top. In the middle, they just sort of openedup.HOW BIG WERE THEY?Maybe 7 feet tall by 7 or 8 feet wide. The doors slid apart and I walked through with twobeings with me.DID YOU OR A BEING OPEN A KNOB IN THE DOOR?No, they had sensors or something. There was a pad on the floor like a black area. Whenyou hit the black area on the floor, the door opened. Grey-Skinned Beings and A Tall, Snake-Skinned \"Leader\"CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE TWO BEINGS ON EITHER SIDE OF YOU?The two ones that came in with me were kind of like what people call the greys, but theirheads weren't shaped the same. They didn't have any necks that moved. The heads andshoulders were connected together. I was looking forward into the door and it was more ofa thought communication. There was kind of like a hospital smell, a disinfectant type ofsmell, in the first room.WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN AND WERE THEY WEARING ANYKIND OF GARMENTS?These two were kind of greyish-brown. They seemed to have a loose-fitting hood thatwent all the way down to the floor like a robe."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THE FITTED ROBE?A dark brown.DID THE HOOD COME DOWN OVER THEIR HEAD OR COULD YOU SEE THEIRFA C E ?I could see them out of my peripheral vision. I could see just a slight image of their face. Ididn't really turn sideways and look. I was dumbfounded and looked straight ahead.WHAT WERE THEIR EYES LIKE?They were kind of recessed. They could have had some kind of protective suit on. It didn'tlook like organic skin. It was kind of like a plastic mask type thing on.LIKE THEY WERE WEARING A TIGHT BODY LEOTARD?Not as tight as a leotard. Maybe like a 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick foam padded hood type thing,kind of like a hockey mask, but real smooth and no marks on it. There was nothing for themouth, no opening at all. Those two were different than the ones that were inside.YOU ARE AT THIS SQUARE DOOR. THESE ODDLY CLOAKED AND POSSIBLYMASKED BEINGS ARE ON EITHER SIDE OF YOU. HOW TALL WERE THEYCOMPARED TO YOU?Just about my height (6 feet), maybe a couple of inches shorter around 5' 8\" to 5'10\". Thedoor opened up into this other room and we went through. It was like a main room of thespaceship.WAS IT ROUND OR SQUARE?It was a round, domed room. It was maybe 12 feet high and round.COLOR?Ta n - w h i t e .WAS THERE LIGHT?Yeah, there was light everywhere. It was just there. There wasn't any shadows on anything.WHO IS IN THAT ROOM?I would say there were probably eight to ten different beings in there. There was also abank of six sort of like phone booths with beings sitting inside of them, like little hoodedplastic phone booths that you could stand in to talk. They were up against the wall and thebeings were in there operating some things. They didn't turn around. They were just in thatarea doing their work. TelepathyThere were also three beings that came up and was talking to me, but without making asound, just talking about me while they were talking to me at the same time!CAN YOU EXPLAIN?They were discussing among themselves using telepathy asking me if I was like the normalhuman, but saying 'This guy is different.' They were talking to me and about me at thesame time a discussion about why I asked to come aboard and why the animal mutilations.WHAT DID THESE BEINGS LOOK LIKE? Tall Snake-Skinned BeingThey were kind of different. One was completely different than the rest of them. He wastaller than I was and had like a pointed-shaped head and was more like a purple reptilianlook, like purple scales and a round mouth. His head didn't turn on his shoulders, either. Hejust turned his shoulders.He seemed to be the leader of it. He had a different kind of uniform a kind of plastic-type"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"cloth. The other two were in lighter colored robes.THE SKIN OF THIS SCALY BEING, WHEN YOU SAY IT WAS PURPLE, COULDYOU GIVE ME A COLOR I MIGHT RECOGNIZE?Iridescent purple. I can't think of anything that would be the same color. It was a darkbrownish-red purple.WHAT ABOUT THE EYES?They were kind of a little inset and pointed upward on the outer edge. They were kind ofblack all the way, with maybe a slight yellow iris. There might have been a little bit of redthere, too.DID THEY HAVE PUPILS THAT WERE VERTICAL LIKE A CROCODILE'S?No. They were just more round, oval up and down, and you could see the eyes wereslanted. When they opened their eyelids, you could see how they opened and closed.COULD YOU SEE A PUPIL AND IRIS LIKE YOU CAN IN A HUMAN EYE?There seemed to be a dark brown outer edge in the black and then the color red andyellow in the middle.DID YOU SEE ANY PUPIL AT ALL?Yeah, I guess. There was a pupil that was getting bigger and littler because the eyelidswere closing up and down, sort of squinting and opening them up.WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THOSE EYELIDS?More brown than purple, not quite as scaly - but more leathery than the other beings.Maybe it was a matter of age. I don't know.THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SCALED SNAKES, SOME WITH BIGGER SCALESAND OTHERS THAT ARE REALLY SMOOTH SNAKES. WHAT WOULD THISBEING BE CLOSEST TO IN SNAKE SCALES?Oh, it would be more like the common garden snake. The scales were kind of connectedtogether, maybe the biggest scale was a quarter-inch. It just seemed like it was facetedmore than scales with membranes between those areas that looked like scales. More of ahexagon with a rounded bottom, like a half a hexagon with a rounded bottom.Garden snake image © by jackrabit4.COULD YOU SEE THE ENDS OF THE HANDS? HOW MANY DIGITS WERETHERE?I don't recall seeing the hand on these guys. They had long robes that covered their wholearms. Dark, Multi-Colored, Hooded CloakOn Snake-Skinned BeingTHE REDDISH-BROWN-PURPLE SNAKE-SKINNED BEING ALSO HAD ON AHOODED CLOAK?Yes, they all had these hoods, long and flowing and hanging down over their limbs. Youcouldn't see the end of their limbs."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THE SNAKE-SKINNED BEING'S HOODED CLOAK?It was more like blackish-brown with some purple, the same color as his skin.COULD YOU SEE THE LEGS AND FEET?Nope. I couldn't see that part of him.ARE YOU STANDING IN FRONT OF THIS VERY TALL SNAKE-SKINNED BEING?Ye s .WHAT HAPPENS?He was just asking me what I knew and what I wanted to know. It's kind of like: 'Youasked to be here. What do you want to know?' They seemed to know that I had quite asignificant scientific background so they could explain things to me and I just wanted toknow what they were using the cattle for.\"To be continued in Part 2.More Information:The Testament of Amram, Dead Sea Scrolls, translated by Prof. Robert Eisenman:\"I saw Watchers in my vision, the dream-vision. Two men were fighting over me ...holding a great contest over me. I asked them, \"Who are you, that you are thusempowered over me?\" They answered, \"We have been empowered and rule over allmankind.\" They said to me, \"Which of us do you choose to rule you?\" I raised myeyes and looked. One of them was terrifying in his appearance, like a serpent, hiscloak, many-colored yet very dark. ... And I looked again, and in his appearance, hisvisage like a viper. ... I replied to him, \"This Watcher, who is he?\" He answered,\"This Watcher ... his three names are Belial and Prince of Darkness and King ofEvil.\" I said (to the other Watcher), \"My lord, what dominion (have you?)\" Heanswered, \"You saw (the viper), and he is empowered over all Darkness, while I (amempowered over all Light.) ... My three names are Michael, Prince of Light andKing of Righteousness.\" For more information about the animal mutilation and non-human entity phenomena,please see books An Alien Harvest and Glimpses of Other Realities, Volumes I and IIlisted in Earthfiles Shop.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
