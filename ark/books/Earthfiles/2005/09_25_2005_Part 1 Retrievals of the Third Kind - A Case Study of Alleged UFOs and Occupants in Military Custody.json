Here begins Part 1of Status Report I, written July 29, 1978. The series of status reports, I through VII, werewritten by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report II begins atEarthfiles. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. For all the previous statusreports, see Earthfiles Archives. Leonard H. Stringfield: \"Since the advent of the UFO, dating back to World War II when there was officialrecognition of the 'foo fighter,' one hard fact stands out: the world public at large still"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"disbelievers in its existence. Another fact: most of our world's scientific communitydoes not believe in UFOs either, although a small number of its Fellowship todaywill admit their puzzlement and sometimes curiosity over the persistence of UFOreports. For those of us dedicated to serious UFO research, working in all professional levels,there is no doubt that a real interloper from somewhere exists! Knowing this isfrustrating. In 31 years of prodigious effort, our research has failed to discover, oruncover, the real UFO's nature, its origin or intent - and I hasten to add, to forceopen the door of alleged official secrecy behind which might be concealed the hardevidence; or if you will, the extraordinary and sobering proof we have all sought. Today, considering the long, evasive history of the UFO and an equally evasiveofficial posture, our research stands at a critical crossroad. Here we find a two-waysplit off, a growing and sharpening divergence of opinion about the nature and originof the UFO. One view entertains the notion that the UFO is a paraphysical or psychical visitantfrom another realm or of another dimension and that all the paranormal evidencereportedly associated with the UFO precludes a simple 'nuts and bolts' physicalexplanation. This hypothesis, in the view of some researchers, rules out theinterplanetary 'nuts and bolts' spaceship. The other major hypothesis, and now considered a conservative view, postulatesthat the UFO is a structured machine and comes from across the vast reaches ofspace and time from another solar system. This belief maintains that theextraterrestrial race has, by virtue of its advanced technology, overcome theproblem of spatial distance and has developed great psychical powers by which itcan manipulate man's mind when it sees fit to do so. Thus, in this postulation, thereported paranormal events can also be explained. Of course, there are many other provocative splinter theories, some interlacing thetwo major hypotheses and some radically disregarding the known facts. Theories arefree, and are a dime a dozen. In its honest endeavor to proceed down either hypothetical path, research todaycontinues to investigate UFO reports, correlate and compute the reported data,computerize photographs, conduct conferences and symposia, and drudge over13,000 UFO reports released by the U. S. Air Force's former Project Bluebookwhich have been made available for public study at the National Archives inWashington, D. C. Therefore, it's not by accident that UFO researchers haveprovided for its brethren a convenient language by which to describe events and,more specifically, a terminology so that UFO reports can be classified. Speaking of terminology, we borrow a page from the eminent Dr. J. Allen Hynek'sbook, The UFO Experience, A Scientific Inquiry. From this major work, we nowhave Close Encounters of the First, Second and Third Kind, which are labelscovering a hypothetical set of conditions wherein the human witness observes orexperiences a UFO at close range. These include physical or electromagnetic effectsto a witness or his surroundings or an encounter with a strange alien being. Popularized by the movie of the same name, Close Encounters of the Third Kind,has become a household term. Now anybody and everybody can share in anawareness of these rare and bizarre events. But there is another event of the AlienThird Kind. This is an event known mainly through rumor. Even knowledgeableresearchers admit they know of it only from shadowy sources, and when pursued,found sudden dead ends. Through patience, perseverance and careful, courteous diplomacy, I have wendedmy way through the many shadowy mazes and found, to my surprise, sources oflight at many of the so-called dead ends. What I have learned from these sourcesdescribes an event which I shall call Retrievals of the Third Kind. Retrievals of the Third Kind relate primarily to the alien being. To be more precise, Irefer to incidents where a UFO had allegedly crashed and both it and the occupantswere retrieved by military personnel who were dispatched to the scene. Accordingto my sources, these immobilized craft and deceased occupants, described ashumanoid, have been placed in custody at certain military installations where theywere studied under the highest security measures. Now, for the first time, sufficient data have been amassed to lend support to some ofthe old retrieval claims. But, looking back to the 1950s, there was little or no desire"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"then to pursue the reported claims. At that time, active researchers - includingmyself - did little more than scoff. We thought we had good reason. Our collective 'scoffing' was the result of an alleged grand hoax. Here, I refer to abook, Behind the Flying Saucer, by the late Frank Scully, published in 1950.Briefly, it told about a reported saucer crash in Aztec, New Mexico, in 1948. Scullywent on to relate that a scientist he had met had possession of metal artifacts takenfrom inside the craft which was proof that the saucer was from outer space.Investigation, however, revealed Scully's scientist was a fraud. With the book'ssubsequent exposure as a hoax, which got a lot of publicity, it became unfashionablefor any objective researcher to write or talk about crashed UFOs and their alleged'little men.' Adding fuel to the fire of a condemned book were strong Air Force denials in 1954that a retrieved UFO was in hiding at Wright-Patterson AFB. I remember calling Lt.Colonel John O'Mara, Chief of Intelligence at the air base, inquiring about thealleged retrievals. His reply in part was, 'Ridiculous!' So completely was Scully's retrievals story put down that some researchers todaywonder, in retrospect, if the book and/or its exposure were contrived (asmisinformation to keep the public and media away from the facts). But despitedenials and the suspicions of research, the crash and retrievals stories persisted.Then, like a bolt from the blue, while preparing the manuscript for my book,Situation Red, The UFO Siege (published by Doubleday), some new reliable sourcesopened up. Then once again, to my surprise, after the release of my book in 1977,still more sources surfaced to talk about what they knew. Then one by one, thejigsaw pieces began to fit together and a picture emerged. Now I believe this is the time and place - Dayton, Ohio, close to Wright-PattersonAFB - that we must face this greatest of issues head-on. We must now take a newand honest look at the old rumors. And we must also take a new look at thepossibility of a grand official cover-up, and why. If anyone of the retrieval incidents is true, or if only one of my informants is tellingthe truth, then humankind is in for a shock. The impact of its sudden revelation - orforced admission through official pronouncement - would probably shake uphumankind's lifestyle, philosophies and even economy. And if it is true that alien humanoids have been retrieved and are held in a preservedstate at one or more military installations, then our government and all consortinggovernments responsible for this concealment, will have to explain their policy ofprolonged secrecy. We might then rightly ask what else is hidden about the UFO of amore frightening nature? Probably following any official pronouncement of this magnitude, there would bestrong public reaction. There would be demands for more hidden facts. As always,some one or some agency would have to be pinned with the blame. Certainly at thetop of the list would be the military establishment and covert intelligence agencies. Also to blame would be the media. Where was their prowess to probe for the truth?It seems strange that some of its audacious members who helped bring down apresident failed to reach the right people with the right UFO facts - or were they,too, in certain key areas a part of the big cover-up? And UFO researchers, too, can share in some of the blame. Too much disunityamong the major research groups is one factor. Perhaps a more concerted actionwould have carried more weight at critical moments when pressures were put tobear in areas of known cover-up. Also, perhaps too much time has been spent byinfluential researchers looking for a paranormal answer for the UFO. One fact hasstood out for years. The average reported UFO appears to be a metallic, structuredcraft with windows and when in a landing position, sometimes uses tripods. Whilethis general description might apply to a vehicle from any other mysterious realm, itdoes suggest that the design is more a feat of engineering than of psychical orspiritual manifestation. Now for an academic thought. Is it right or wise for research - or myself - to try andpry open the lid of a possible Pandora's Box? Is it not morally right to know aboutthe crashed UFO and its alien occupants? Is there something sinister about thecontinuing surveillance of Earth? And what, you might ask, is my own opinion of my informants endowed with suchpowerful testimony? Frankly, I cannot refute the credibility of any of my informants."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"They are from scattered areas, many of whom I have pursued with great effort.Knowing something about the character of each suggests that none is hoaxing and itis difficult to believe that anyone of them was a 'plant.' Even if one or two were,what about the others? I might ask, why plant the kind of information that couldwork against the official position which is to play down the notion of secrecy aboutUFOs? It is with equal candor that I must state that I am not in a providential position topass a positive or final judgment on the retrieval stories or on my informants. On thistenuous ground, I must allow for some marginal error in observation or tiny flaw inhuman judgment for each reported account. However, let me quote an old adage,'Wherever there is smoke, there is fire.' From my position, I certainly can see ahelluva lot of smoke! Now, let me switch from my beliefs to yours and consider what you might thinkabout me relative to my expose. To help guide your appraisal, allow me to state thatI personally have not seen a retrieved UFO, parts of one, or its occupants. Also, for the record, I do not possess a single affidavit to prove that any one of myinformants has seen a retrieved craft or its occupants. I have only their names andtheir testimony. Unfortunately, I cannot use these names. Anonymity has beenrequested and will be respected. The reasons should be obvious to all. In essence,therefore, the cases I present in this paper without names to back up the informant'stestimony can be construed as hearsay. If perchance, hearsay is to be my undoing, then I must make my stand on the meritsof my own credibility which I trust has already been established in my 29 years ofUFO research. You are the judge and the jury. I will now proceed with the testimonyof my informants concerning Retrievals of the Third Kind in the following abstracts. ABSTRACT 1 In 1948, according to reports from hazy sources, a UFO with occupants numberinganywhere from one to sixteen, had crashed in a desert region of southwestern UnitedStates or Mexico and was retrieved by U. S. military authorities. But the reportsnever got beyond rumor because 1948 was the year when Frank Scully's bookunloaded an alleged hoax on the public about a crashed UFO in Aztec, New Mexico. In the Fall of 1977, new word of a 1948 crash came to me from a well-informedmilitary source. His information, however, was scanty. He had heard from other'inside' military sources that a metallic disc had crashed somewhere in a desertregion. His only details indicated that the craft had suffered severe damage onimpact and was retrieved by military units. By coincidence, months later in 1977, I was to learn more about a crashed discoccurring in 1948. This came from researcher Todd Zechel, whom I had knownsince 1975 when he became Research Director of Ground Saucer Watch. Formerlywith the National Security Agency, Zechel stated that a U. S. Air Force techniciantold him that his uncle, then a Provost Marshall at Carswell Air Force Base near Ft.Worth, Texas, had taken part in the 1948 recovery of a crashed (New Mexico) UFOwhich was described as a metallic disc, 90 feet in diameter. The crash occurred about 30 miles inside the Mexican border across from Laredo,Texas, and was recovered by U. S. troops after it was tracked on radar screens. Thejob assigned the Provost Marshall, now a retired Colonel, was to cordon off thecrash site. The retired Colonel, now living in Florida, was tracked by Zechel. Among otherfacts revealed by the Colonel was that one dead alien was found aboard the craftwhich was described as about 4 feet, 6 inches tall, completely hairless, with handsthat had no thumbs. Zechel learned from his source that the troops involved in the retrieval were warnedthat if they said a word about the incident they would be the 'sorriest people around.' Continuing his investigation, Zechel pieced together other eyewitnesses to the 1948crash event. In his statement, Zechel relates the following: 'I tracked another AirForce Colonel, now retired in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He had seen the UFO inflight. He was flying an F-94 fighter out of Dias Air Force Base in Texas and wasover Albuquerque, New Mexico, when reports came of a UFO on the West Coast,flying over Washington state. Radars clocked its speed at 2,000 miles per hour."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"'It made a 90-degree turn and flew east over Texas.' The Colonel, then a Captainpilot, actually saw it as it passed. Then suddenly, it disappeared from radar screens.At Dias Base, the radar operators plotted its course and decided it had crashed some30 miles across the Mexican border from Laredo. When the Captain got back tobase, he and a fellow pilot got into a small plane and took off over the border afterthe UFO. When they landed in the desert at the crash site, U. S. troops were therebefore them. 'The craft was covered with a canopy and the two pilots were not allowed to see it.They were then called to Washington, D. C., for debriefing and sworn to secrecyabout the whole event.' Zechel also traced a U. S. Naval Intelligence officer who was in Mexico City at thetime of the crash. He was rushed to the spot, but got there just as the craft was beingloaded onto military trucks. COMMENT: Todd Zechel related to me by phone on March 15, 1978, that additional detailspertinent to this 1948 incident will be made known in his forthcoming 1978 book,Under Intelligent Control. Zechel also related that he has a signed affidavit by theretired Air Force Colonel who was involved in the cordoning-off operations. ABSTRACT 2 In 1952, the year of the great wave of UFO sightings throughout the U. S., can alsoshare in the history of retrieval data. My information for one known UFO crashincident in 1952 comes from a reliable person in a technical position at a largeGeneral Electric plant. His brother, who wishes to be unnamed, was on duty as aradar specialist at Edwards Air Force Base, California, in 1952, when he saw a UFOdescending toward Earth at great speed across his radar screen. When the UFO hadbeen confirmed to have crashed, the Captain on duty gave him instructions, 'You didnot see anything!' The specialist a short time later learned from base officials that an unidentified craftdid crash in a nearby remote desert area. The retrieved craft was more than 50 feetin diameter with a row of windows around its equator. Its metallic surface was in aburned-blackened condition. He also had heard that the craft was occupied by deadhumanoid bodies approximately 4.5 feet tall. Also, the specialist recalls that he heard reports that the damaged craft was heldtemporarily in a hangar at Edwards Air Force Base before it was shipped by truck toWright-Patterson Air Force Base. COMMENT: I had asked my informant if I could discuss this incident with his brother. But whenhe checked by phone, he was reminded that the incident was classified as secret andhe would not be in a position to disclose further details. In possible conjunction with this 1952 event, I have talked with two sources whohad witnessed a large military vehicle or lo-boy drag a suspicious cargo undertarpaulin destined for Wright-Patterson AFB. One observer was Quartermaster atGodman Field, Kentucky, when the lo-boy, under heavy guard at night, made atransient stop there. Word on the base was that its hidden cargo was a crashed UFO. Other witnesses, who had observed a strange cargo being transported on a lo-boyinto Wright-Patterson AFB in 1952, were a man and wife then residing inCircleville, Ohio. By telephone in 1952, they claimed while driving their car near thebase that traffic was stalled. Escorting the vehicle, they said, was a motorcade ofmilitary police. ABSTRACT 3 Additional testimony in support of a crashed UFO incident in 1952 comes from anunquestionable source: John Schuessler, Deputy Director of MUFON, and engineerfor McDonnell Douglas at NASA. His data came from his father and stepmother,who secured their data in 1968 from a firsthand source, who was their neighbor in asmall town in Pennsylvania. According to John Schuessler, his family's close friend was formerly a civilian guardserving at a Receiving Gate for Internal Security at Wright-Patterson AFB. While on"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"duty, sometime in 1952, he witnessed a tractor with lo-boy hauling a tarpaulin-covered craft into a tight security area at the base. The guard also had told Schuessler that he witnessed at the Receiving Gate thedeceased bodies recovered from the crashed UFO at a site vaguely referred to assomewhere in the U. S. Southwest. Packed in crates, the guard described the bodies as being 'little people' or humanoid.It is not known whether or not the bodies arrived at the same time at the base as thecraft on the lo-boy or at another time by other means. One point he did make clearabout the area in which he worked to his Schuessler friends, 'Everything deliveredhad to pass by me.' John Schuessler said he tried to follow up to get more information by arranging ameeting with the former guard through the influence of his parents, but his effortswere futile. Said John, 'He refused to talk about it, even to me.' COMMENT: The brief testimony of the Security Guard at Wright-Patterson AFB and that of theRadar Specialist at Edwards AFB (cited in Abstract # 2) suggests that the officialcover-up of vital UFO data is so great that some of it which concerns the captivecraft and occupants is under a special system of files - and has always beenindependent of those maintained by Project Blue Book, and perhaps are withoutclassification so that even the Freedom of Information Act cannot reach them. Probably the area in which the security guard had served his tenure of duty from thelate 1940s to the mid 1950s was the same as that referred to by U. S. Senator BarryGoldwater in his letter to me dated December 3, 1974, in which the Senator stated, 'Imade an effort to get in the room at Wright-Patterson where the information wasstored, and I was denied that request.' ABSTRACT 4 Mr. T., who holds a high technical position in civilian life today, was in the Spring of1953, at the age of 20, a radar specialist with secret security clearance. Whilestationed in Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey, in 1953, he and a small, select number ofradar specialists were summoned to view a special film at the base theater. Without any briefing, the 16mm movie projector was flicked on and the film beganto roll on the screen, showing the usual flaws and scratches found in combatphotograph film. Suddenly, without any titles or credits or music, there appeared adesert scene dominated by a silver disc-shaped object embedded in the sand with adomed section at the top. At the bottom was a hatch or door that was open. In the next scene, Mr. T. recalls seeing ten to fifteen military personnel all dressed infatigues, and without identification patches, standing around what appeared to bethe disabled craft. By judging their height against the UFO, Mr. T. determined thatits width was approximately fifteen to twenty feet in diameter and that an openhatch or door at the bottom was about 1.5 feet wide and perhaps 3 feet high. At thispoint, Mr. T had no idea of the movie's purpose. I asked about the activity of thepersonnel. He said, 'They were just looking at the object.' Then the movie switched to what appeared to be the interior of the craft. A panelwith a few simple levers was shown. He remembers being impressed by the mutedpastel colors and sudden glares of white - the sign of poor photography.Again there was a change of scenes. Now in view were two tables, probably takeninside a tent. To his surprise, there were dead bodies on the tables. Two were on onetable and one on another. Mr. T said the bodies appeared little by human standards and most notable were theheads, all looking alike, and all being large compared to their body sizes. Theylooked mongoloid, he thought, with small noses, mouths and eyes that were shut. Hedid not recall seeing ears or hair. The skin, he said, was leathery and ashen in color.Each wore a tight-fitting suit in a pastel color. The sight of the dead bodies was the end of the movie. As most military moviescredit the Signal Corps or some other source, this one 'stopped cold,' said Mr. T.When the lights came on in the theater, the officer in charge stood up and instructedthe viewers to 'think about the movie,' and added firmly, 'Don't relate its contents toanyone.' Mr. T said, in good faith, he did not even tell his wife who lived near thebase."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" To Mr. T's surprise, two weeks later, he was approached by an intelligence officer onthe base and told, 'Forget the movie you saw. It was a hoax.' Shortly after seeing the movie, he heard from a couple of top security officers on thebase that a UFO had crashed in New Mexico, and had been recovered with itsoccupants. The date of the crash was 1952, said Mr. T. Commented my informant: 'The 5-minute-long movie certainly was not a WaltDisney production. It was probably shot by an inexperienced cameraman because itwas full of scratches and had poor coloring and texture.' Mr. T., when asked about his interest in UFOs, claimed that he was not interested -then or now , but he has always been curious about the purpose of the film inrelation to his work in radar. Years later, he met an old Army acquaintance who alsowas a radar specialist. To T's surprise, he learned from this man that he, too, hadseen the same film at another base under similar hush-hush conditions. COMMENT: Considering the credibility status of my informant, I believe he saw the movie anddescribes the subject matter to the best of his recollection. Regarding the subjectmatter, he believes that the crashed craft and the dead bodies, were bona fide. Itwould have been difficult, even by a major Hollywood studio, to have made dummybodies look so real for use in an otherwise make-shift film. And for what morbidpurpose?\" Continued in Part 2 - Kingman, Arizona UFO Crash/RetrievalCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
