Bicyclist Reports Mysterious, Low Hovering Objects Bending Wheat© 2005 by Linda Moulton Howe \"...I am certain that there is some other form of intelligence, either on this planet orvisiting the crops from somewhere else. I have no doubt about that after seeingwhat I saw.\"- Mike Booth, Marlborough, U. K. Resident Marlborough is northeast of Lockeridge in Wiltshire County, England.July 1, 2005 Lockeridge, Wiltshire, England - Mike Booth has spent much of hisforty-five years designing for race cars and planes. He received his British NationalDiploma in Art from Buckinghamshire's Amersham School of Art and Design in 1979. In his spare time, he also writes songs and tries every other night to ride his mountain bikefrom his home near Marlborough out the road from Lockeridge, past Boreham Down andthe West Woods on to Alton Barnes. The road goes right through the heart of Wiltshire'scrop circle country, but Mike had never seen anything especially unusual until 6:30 p.m.on Tuesday, June 21, 2005, as he was riding next to Boreham Down.Interview:Mike Booth, Designer, Artist and Musician, Marlborough, Wiltshire, England: \"Myattention was caught by three objects in the field on the left hand side of the road. Iimmediately stopped because I realized straight away that I was looking at something that Ihad never seen before.These objects were about 4 feet wide, about 6 feet in length with about two to three feet ofa curved top showing above the tops of the wheat where they were. At this point in time inthe U. K., the wheat is green. So, it was very obvious that these white, metallic objects, as Iwould describe them, were very noticeable in the green crop.THEY WERE ABOUT 2 TO 3 FEET ABOVE THE CROP?No, they were sort of within the tops of the crop. It was obvious to me that they were noton the ground. The field actually slopes away up to my left, so it was very easy to seethese objects, or craft, or whatever they were.DO YOU MEAN THEY WERE SORT OF DOWN INSIDE THE WHEAT HEADSTHEMSELVES?Yes, I would say they were suspended. They weren't on the ground, but they were about 6to 9 inches down into the top of the crop. They were brushing the wheat heads down very"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"slowly and making a trail in the crop not in any particular pattern. Two of the craft were nomore than 30 feet apart. A third one was about 50 yards further to my right as I'm lookingup the hill. There might have been a fourth one because the following day (Wednesday,June 22) when I went back to take some photographs, there was a fourth path in the wheatthat I couldn't see before because of the lay of the land.Computer-generated white objects placed by Mike Booth against one of his actual Boreham Downwheat field photographs to illustrate what he saw at 6:30 p.m. on June 21, 2005,from his bike. Image © 2005 by Mike Booth.YOU WERE SEEING THE WHEAT GOING DOWN FLAT?Not flat. The machines were brushing through the top depressing the heads of the wheat,so there was a very obvious trail about 9 or 10 inches lower than the rest of the crop in thefield.Above and below photos © 2005 by Mike Booth: \"I took some pictures looking downthe trail with my car in the background to give some scale and show exactlythe position of where I was in the distance (on bike) from the objects.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"COULD YOU DESCRIBE THE THREE OBJECTS MORE?They were very simple form. No edges or contours. They were slightly oblong in shape.They were longer than wide, about 4 feet wide and about 6 feet long. The best way todescribe them, the best analogy is over here in England I'm sure you have them in theStates we have what we call 'top boxes' on the roof rack of cars. It was very similar to thatshape, sort of oblong but in a domed, almost molded form. I've done a great deal ofmolding work and back-forming in the past in my design work. And they looked exactlylike they had been molded. No edges, smooth contours not unlike the mouse you get for aPC or MAC keyboard. That kind of form.\"Computer mouse\"-shaped objects Mike Booth saw moving along the wheat heads atBoreham Down, Wiltshire, England, at 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday, June 21, 2005.Computer-generated illustration © 2005 by Mike Booth.COLOR?Apparent white, but with a metallic hue to it. It was a beautiful evening and the sun wasreflecting off them. I've seen nothing like it. I've done a great deal of flying myself in thepast, so I'm very conscious of the fact that categorically what I saw, I have never seen thelikes of before. I considered the possibilities that they were farming equipment or scientifictest equipment or even hoaxers underneath some form of molded structure.But it was very apparent to me that it was none of those. It's very evident that the vehiclesor objects weren't on the ground because the wheat was leaning over, but if the objects hadbeen on the ground the way they were manipulating the wheat, it would have flattened thestems. Two craft in particular were on either side of the (tramline) track. So, I'm thinkingno farmer would break down his own crop just randomly. Next Day, Boreham Down Crop Formation Reported"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Crop formation reported June 22, 2005, in Boreham Down wheat field near Lockeridge,Wiltshire, below the West Woods. The night before on June 21, 2005, at 6:30 p.m., 200 yards from pattern'ssite, bicyclist Mike Booth was on the road near field when he saw three white, metallic, objects movingslowly at height of wheat heads which bent over as the machines passed. Aerial photo© 2005 by Lucy Pringle. Also see: Cropcircleconnector.comThe objects I saw were NOT making a crop circle at that time on Tuesday night like theone that was reported subsequently in that field. I've had an open mind over the years withregards to crop circles. You know, some of them are huge and complicated and Ipersonally fail to see how people could do that at night with lasers or ropes.But the objects I was looking at, I cannot relate directly to that Boreham Down crop circle,but they were moving down the hill slowly and pushing down the wheat behind. There's nodoubt about that. I've got the photos to prove it.What I did was drive my car back the next day and stop in exactly the same spot that I saton my mountain bike and took photos from that perspective at the trails that were stillthere in the wheat. Then I walked up the side of the hill, wishing I had done that at thetime (the craft were there) and realized how close I would have gotten to the objects, tocertainly one of them. Then I walked around to the rear of where the trails started becauseas I described to you before, it's set aside land so it's just grass on the sides of the wheat.You can actually walk around the back where these craft or vehicles entered the wheat. Itook some pictures looking down the trail with my car in the background to give somescale and show exactly the position of where I was in the distance (on my bike) from theobjects.And those objects were doing something completely different than making crop circles.They were in the wheat leaving a trail behind them, but they weren't making a designatedshape. When I went back to take the photographs, the trails were no further progressed inthe wheat than when I left them (on Tuesday, June 21, at 6:30 p.m.). It kind of raises thequestion: where did they go? Did they reverse? Why isn't the wheat laying back the otherway? And the only other option is they could go up. The trails stop within the crop andthere is nothing else that disturbs beside or in front of the trails.DID YOU SEE ANYTHING LEAVE THE FIELD?No, I took one last glance as I was riding away and saw the third object I noticed it stillhad not moved. What I missed out is that they were moving down the hill when I first sawthem and I became very aware of the fact that they stopped particularly two of them. I gota sense that they, or It, became aware of the fact that I was at the bottom of the hill andthat's why they stopped. That's how it felt at the time. When I rode on further and I had toride up the side of a very large hill, I considered when I got to the top looking back to seeif they were still there but unfortunately again, because of the lay of the land and the hillsand valleys, when I got to the top of the hill I could not see the field that the three whiteobjects had been in.I then just continued my ride back to Marlborough the way I do. I would not have beenable to see the crop circle that is there now, even if it was there Tuesday night. It's onlywhen you turn around on the road about half a mile further along and come back towardsMarlborough (opposite of the way I was going) that you can see the shallow dip in thefield."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Red dot is where Boreham Down crop formation was reported on Wednesday, June 22; the three purple dotsrepresent the three objects where Mike Booth saw them in the wheat field. He stopped his bike on the yellowcoloredroad nearest the first two white objects. Even if the crop pattern had been in the field on Tuesday evening, hewouldnot have been able to see it because of the hill and vale nature of the land. Map © 2005 by Mike Booth.Mike Booth Wonders Why He Did NotApproach the Strange ObjectsThe other thing that has become apparent to me is the fact that I'm naturally a veryanalytical inquirer. So, I can't understand why I made the decisions I made. I was sopassive about the whole thing. Yet, I had a cell phone in my pocket with a camera. But Ididn't take any pictures, even though I vaguely considered doing that. Aside from the factthat I was looking at something I'd never seen before, but also we have a lot of 'set aside'policy in farming here where they reduce the size of fields down so it's not all crop. There'sabout several yards on either side of the boundaries where they leave it to reduce theoverall output. This was just normal grass and it would have been incredibly easy to get offmy back and walk up the side of the field and get within just a few feet of one of theseobjects. But I cannot understand why every time I considered this, I just in a passive sensethought, 'No, I won't do that.'Ultimately, I rode off on my bike after about three minutes of observing what was goingon. I was in such an accepting mood. I could not understand it. This has really troubled mesince because I'm not of that nature, you know especially if you see something you'venever seen before! It sounds almost comical now. I should have photographed it.MIKE, HOW FAR WERE YOU FROM THE THREE OBJECTS?No further away than 200 yards at the very most. The slope was rising up, the gradient, soit's not as if they were like sort of flat. They were on the hill and very easy to see, perfectlyin a position to see on the side of a hill like that. So it was very close. I think that's one ofthe things that made me stop in my tracks and made me think that I wasn't going to walkup the side of the hill. I could have touched one of them if I wanted to because they werewithin the crop only about 6 or 8 feet away from the boundary where the crop stops fromthis set aside land.THAT YOU COULD HAVE WALKED UP TO GET CLOSER, BUT SOMETHING KEPTYOU FROM DOING THAT?Yes, and that's what unsettled me. With the background I've had in design and engineering,I'm naturally inquiring. If it was anything else, I would like to know what size engine it hadand how it was made and the rest of it. I cannot understand why I was so passive andaccepting about the whole thing.AS IF YOU HAD BEEN CONTROLLED BY SOMETHING OUT OF YOUR WILL.Absolutely. I offset that against my own mind saying to me, 'Mike, you are not going to beable to cope with what you are looking at if you get that close, so just leave it alone andcarry on riding.' It could be that, or manipulation (from outside). I don't know. It'scompletely out of character for me to accept something that I'm looking at that I've neverseen before and continue on a leisure ride in the evening.IF ONLY YOU HAD PICKED UP YOUR CELL PHONE AND TAKEN APHOTOGRAPH OF THOSE THINGS.I know. I could have kicked myself afterward. I can laugh at it now, as I do a huge amountof photography and I, like anyone else, would have wanted the defining photo of some sortof craft that says we are being visited by another intelligence. Although I didn't take the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"pictures this time with no understanding why I didn't do that - I assure you the story is true,it happened, and it's left me feeling perplexed. But also I am certain that there is someother form of intelligence, either on this planet or visiting the crops from somewhere else.
