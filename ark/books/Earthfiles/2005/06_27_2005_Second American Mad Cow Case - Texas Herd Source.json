Photographs courtesy www.mad-cow.org. June 27, 2005 Washington, D. C. - The U. S. Department of Agriculture confirmed onJune 25, 2005, that the second U. S. cow in 18 months has tested positive for bovinespongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, also known as Mad Cow disease. The first case ofMad Cow found in the U.S. was in December 2003 in a Washington state dairy cow thathad been imported from Canada.This 2005 infected cow was at least 8 years-old andrumors in the cattle industry are that the animal was born and raised in Texas. If so, thiswould be the first confirmation that the always fatal BSE prion disease that destroys brainsand nervous systems is in some American cattle and not solely linked to imported animals,as once previously thought. In the mid-1990s, Great Britain had an outbreak of the deadly prion disease in cattle whichspread to humans through a destructive protein called \"variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.\"The word \"variant\" means the disease which is linked to eating contaminated cow meat isvery similar to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which has long been known to cause brain andnervous system deterioration and death in people. The global human death toll now from\"variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob\" is more than 150. On the left is the normal prion protein, PrP-C. On the right is the abnormal, misshapen PrP-SC.These diagrams are from Huang, Z., Prusiner, Stanley B. and Cohen, Fred E. from \"Structures of PrionProteinsand Conformational Models for Prion Diseases in Prions,\" (ed. S.B. Prusiner) Berlin: Springer-Verlag, ©1996. Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns told a press conference, \"This (2005) animal wasblocked from entering the food supply because of the firewalls we have in place.Americans have every reason to continue to be confident in the safety of our Americanbeef.\" Chronic Wasting Disease (Prion) Confirmed"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"in Two New Mexico Deer Mule deer. Photograph © by Peter Eades. Another deadly prion disease attacks deer and elk. The New Mexico State Dept. of Gameand Fish reported today that two mule deer captured in the Organ Mountains near LasCruces have tested positive for CWD. That means eleven animals in that same southernNew Mexico area have been infected with the prion disease since 2002. Deer and elk with CWD loose weight, shake, can't walk without falling down, lose bodilyfunctions and die. So far the devastating prion disease has been found in wild and captivedeer and elk in eight states and two Canadian provinces. New Mexico Game and Fish is encouraging hunters to bring in freshly killed elk or deer toa government office where the brain stem can be removed for testing.
