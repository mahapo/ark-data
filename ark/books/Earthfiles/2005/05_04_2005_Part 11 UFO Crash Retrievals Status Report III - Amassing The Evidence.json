Here begins Part 11of Status Report III, written in June 1982. The series of status reports, I through VII, werewritten by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report IV begins atEarthfiles 021205. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. Leonard H. Stringfield: CASE B-12: Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, July 1964 Perhaps the most exotic, if not the most macabre case in my first person report files, wasreceived by phone from Mrs. C. K., January 8, 1980, during a local radio interview. Thesetting is Wright-Patterson AFB, July 1964, in the Children's Ward of the base hospital.According to Mrs. C. K., her husband, an Air Force serviceman stationed at Wright-Patterson, was away on duty when she admitted her 18-month-old son to the hospital for apediatric examination. While waiting in the lounge, her fidgeting child suddenly streakedoff down the corridor and managed to squeeze through a swinging door into a roommarked, 'Isolation. Keep Out!' Mrs. C. K. went after him, opened the door to behold a sightshe will never forget. On the bed, without sheets or pillows, was a torso-like hulk of flesh which CK described aslooking like an uncooked pot roast. Without arms or legs, she said it had a crease down themiddle and inserted at each end was a tube running from an intravenous apparatus holdinga bottle of clear fluid. The windows were shut, she said, and there were no chairs and onlya dim light coming from a wall. 'I was horrified,' said Mrs. C. K., who had stood about 6 feet away from the bed as herchild tugged to get away. Suddenly a nurse bolted into the room and harshly advised themto leave immediately. Mrs. C. K. noticed when she returned to the lounge, there was aflurry of activity in the hallway outside the room. But she could not hear what the nurseand another attendant were saying. The next day, Mrs. C. K. returned to the Children's Ward by appointment and when shechose to apologize again for the 'fuss' her child had caused the day before, she wassurprised to find the nurse in a friendlier mood and even more surprised when she usheredher to the room, now without the 'Isolation' sign. Now it was unoccupied and had theappearance of being quite normal - with the sheets and pillows on the bed, chairs, and theblinds wide open. The nurse, however, did not volunteer a comment on the room's'occupant' and Mrs. C. K. was too scared to ask. COMMENT: While Mrs. CK's mysterious 'whatzit' might provoke only a good laugh, thepoint here is that she understandably was shocked by the sight of something seemingly outof place. Her guess was that it might have been the limbless body of an alien put therewhere it would cause the least suspicion. Whatever the case, 'The Thing' will remain amystery unless the doctor in charge should some day confess that he and cohorts wereintravenously feeding Worcestirshire sauce to a pot roast for a clandestine feast. CASE B-13: Aztec, New Mexico, 1948 "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"When Prof. John Spencer Carr of Clearwater, Florida, hit the news wires in 1974 with his'little men' story, his was a voice in the wilderness. He stood quite alone, undaunted in aworld of disbelief. It included ufologists who had not forgotten Scully. (See Item B-12,Status Report II. To be reprinted in future Earthfiles). His disclosure, like Scully's, dealtwith the 1948 Aztec, New Mexico, crash/retrieval incident. Speaking in Palm Beach,Florida, Carr claimed he had strong testimonial back-up from five sources, including anurse and high ranking Air Force officer. He declined to name his sources. Since 1974, I have discussed the Aztec event several times with Prof. Carr, always hopinghe would share a name or two, but he would not budge. Surprisingly, on February 6, 1982, Prof. Carr called me to request a copy of my StatusReport II and to wish me well in my research. Again, I asked about his sources. This time,on the premise that our ages give us little time tolerance in our search for truth. Said Carrin his usual eloquence, 'You are one of the anointed few in research and you should knowthe truth. I might not be around very long and I believe now is the time to identify my keywitness.' When Prof. Carr named his source, I sat back dumbfounded. I knew his name well inresearch and recalled some of the source's comments on UFOs while he served as an AirForce officer. But Carr was quick to tie a string to his disclosure, stating, 'Please, Len,keep the name to yourself. Please spare me any trouble as long as I live.' Added Prof. Carr: 'My key witness participated in the 1948 retrieval and saw the alienbodies on location.' COMMENT: Of course, I must uphold Prof. Carr's request and, as promised, protect theofficer who allegedly went to the Aztec retrieval site. Personally, I had never placed muchcredence in the Aztec case as I understood its particulars from Scully to Carr. However,since the private disclosure of the identity of the key witness, I find that I must againre-evaluate the whole affair. It seems that no matter how hard one tries to dismiss oneevent or another, a new affirmative clue always seems to surface. Still another provocativedisclosure possibly related to the Aztec case is in the following item, B-14. Also of note isthat Prof. Carr's disclosure about the Aztec case coincides with the year 1974, whenallegedly the U. S. government was to announce that UFOs were extraterrestrial (See CaseB-3 in this Status Report III). Was Carr's revelation a trial balloon? CASE B-14: Aztec, New Mexico, 1948 The 1948 Aztec, New Mexico case, long disputed, keeps coming back to life as new bitsand pieces circuitously surface. among Tommy Blann's research acquaintances is RonaldWest of Dallas, Texas, who offered the following comment by letter dated April 15, 1982: 'As you asked in our phone conversation last week, I am relating some incidentspertaining to UFOs given me by a friend that I consider to be completely reliable andof sound mind. The incidents were related during a private group meeting, whichwas taped and referred to before the writing of this letter. The tape was madeFebruary 13, 1976. A craft was discovered close to Mr. Francisco in Arizona, the specific date notmentioned, but concluded to precede any knowledge or interest on the part of thespeaker concerning UFOs, which very well might have been thirty years prior to thisgathering. The craft had come to a bad end, apparently crashed, although physicallyundamaged with the exception of a crack in one porthole. An investigation wasconducted by military personnel and scientists, among whom was Silas Newton, ascientist and very wealthy oil man. Fourteen little bodies were found within the craftand were subsequently sent to St. Louis for dissection. (All of which has beenpreviously published.) The speaker before our assembled group described a personal relationship betweenSilas Newton and himself, plus a third party who had access to certain recordscontained within Project Blue Book. Certain of these records revealed dataconcerning twenty-seven separate craft that had come to a bad end, presumablycrashed at different times and locations around the globe. Of those craft that weredowned within the United States, names of clergymen and chaplains whoadministered burial rites under requirement of law were recorded. The burial riteswee performed in various centers in the United States for 'little people,' 'normal-sizedpeople' and 'big people.' COMMENT: West's informant, who claims to know the identities of some of theclergymen involved in the administration of burial rites, has held a key position with a"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"well-known industrialist. Questionable in the eyes of research is Silas Newton, the wealthyoil mogul whose role in the case (described by Frank Scully) had been subsequentlydiscredited. Of course, my UFO files show others like Newton with sensitive informationwho have emerged to tell the truth and have also been discredited. ADDENDUM: Also of interest i respect to the Aztec case is information sent to me byletter dated May 4, 1982, from Richard W. Heiden, MUFON, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Withextensive correspondence with researchers in Spanish-speaking countries, his letter fromAntonio Ribera of Barcelona, Spain, states: 'In Mexico in 1970, my friend Guillermo Mendizbal Fizalde, who is a publisher, toldme that he attended a gathering where Licenciado (a title given to someone holdinga Master's Degree), Miguel Aleman, who had been President of Mexico, waspresent. The subject of conversation was flying saucers and Miguel Aleman waslistening in silence. One of those present asked him what his opinion of the subjectwas. Then Aleman said that when he was President, General Eisenhower - at thattime President of the United States - visited Mexico. President-to-President,Eisenhower told him that he once visited an air base in the Southwest United Stateswhere they showed him a flying disc and the cadavers of several of its crewmembers. This information seems very interesting to me, as it confirms everythingthat Stringfield has uncovered.' COMMENT: As Prof. Robert S. Carr and others have related, President Eisenhower wascalled to the Muroc air base (later Edwards AFB) in 1948 to see firsthand the captive craftfrom Aztec. It was on his command that the secrecy lid was clamped on UFOs and rigidlyenforced. In 1979, Carr gave me a luridly detailed account of the Eisenhower visit to theair base according to one of his firsthand witnesses. Heiden commented on the Riberastory and points out that Aleman left the presidency of Mexico on December 1, 1952, oneand a half months before Ike became President of the United States. 'Maybe,' statesHeiden, 'the meeting was really president-to-ex-president.' CASE B-15: Naval Air Base, Yuma, Arizona, 1967 What seemed to be a case of great potential, including the emergence of photographs of a'saucer' in military custody, became less so with the passing of time. Following a series ofalleged interferences, my sources said they feared even greater consequences and backedoff into oblivion. My source, AF, acted as intermediary for his brother, Pete. Pete was a former marine whosurreptitiously snapped the photographs. AF first called me from Kingston, New York,early in December 1981. According to AF, his brother who resided 'somewhere' in Floridawould soon visit Kingston. Together, if necessary, they would be willing to fly toCincinnati to see me in person with photographs and other back-up material. Of primeinterest were six photographs, said AF, two of which were taken by Pete with help from abuddy, T.O. The photographs were said to show a saucer-like craft in a hangar at a NavalAir Base in Yuma, Arizona in 1967. AF said that Pete, who got into trouble over thephotos, went AWOL and fled to Mexico, but was safe now 'out of reach of the authorities'aboard a shrimp boat. Keeping his brother in low profile, AF decided in the interim to send me copies of twophotos by mail. But they never arrived, nor did the second set which he mailed December27, 1981. On January 12, 1982, AF was reached by phone by a trusted colleague to check on thephotographs he promised to send. AF not only expressed concern for the postalirregularities, but revealed that his home had been rifled 'with certain pieces of informationremoved concerning matters discussed with Len.' He went on to relate, quoting from mycolleague's notes, 'I'm becoming paranoid and so is y brother. Pete's here in New York withme. We don't know why we're being persecuted, but we are. ...Maybe I should not havetalked with Len, but I did and we're being harassed. ...Tell Len that I will not send anymoreinformation by phone, telegram or mail. Tell him we're out purchasing tickets for crosscountry. Just lay back and we'll be in contact.' Commented my colleague, 'Throughout this conversation, his voice had a decided agitatededge to it, as if he really was experiencing distress of some sort.' AF was unreachable by phone during the remainder of January 1982 and his two sets ofphotos that he said he mailed in December 1981, never arrived. At one point, I hadsuggested that he try registered mail. He agreed and suggested I call back by February 20,1982, to allow ample time. But the date went by. Nothing."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"On February 23, luckily, I reached him by phone. AF was obviously disturbed, his voicebreaking as he said, 'I've got bad news, Len. Pete and my Dad are here and we came to adecision.' Taking a deep breath, he continued, 'We decided to drop the whole matter.Frankly, we're scared. Pete's been approached by an agency and wants to avoid attention.' Then after a long pause, he asked, 'Did you get my registered letters?' When I replied that Ihad not, his voice dropped in disbelief. 'I sent you two registered letters,' he said. 'Thatmakes four letters I sent you. I can't believe it.' Of course, I asked him to send e his half of the stubs bearing my name and address so thatI could follow-up on tracing the letters from this end. But he confessed to mislaying them.Feeling a mixture of chagrin and puzzlement, I switched my subject to inquire about the'agency' who caught up with Pete. AF's response was quick. 'They got to him through my father who works at a veteranshospital in Florida. The agent told Dad he was with the IRS, but that was just a front toreach Pete.' When I asked him to be more specific, he declined to answer. Something hadhappened to scare the 'F' family, something not being told over the phone. AF's last wordswere that he would make one more attempt to send me the two photos. 'Give me a month,'he said. 'I think i have a sure way.' COMMENT: The letter he was to send a 'sure way' never arrived. The AF case, if not aploy, bears semblance in some respects to Case A-5 in this Status Report III. If suchconspiracies are real, then it suggests that the perpetrators will resort to any means toferret out - or snuff out - the informant who has vital UFO information.\" Continued in Part 12 - Other UFO Crash/Retrieval Case NotesCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
