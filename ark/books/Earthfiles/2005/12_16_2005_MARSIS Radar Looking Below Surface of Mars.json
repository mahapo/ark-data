December 16, 2005 Pasadena, California - Far from Earth is a mystery that scientistsare trying to solve from an orbiting spacecraft that is now looking below the surface ofMars with deep ground-penetrating radar. It's called \"MARSIS,\" which stands for MarsAdvanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding.The mystery is where did all the water go from the surface of Mars? Martian orbiterphotographs show large meandering valleys that look like dry river beds on Earth. Did thewater evaporate into space? Or did it go underground? If Martian water is underground,can we find evidence of large ice layers? Or even liquid water deep enough undergroundwhere the temperature might be warmer?For the first time in human history, Earth scientists have technology to look undergroundon Mars for answers to those questions. The MARSIS radar was built to penetrate at least5 kilometers of the Martian surface. To the surprise of MARSIS mission scientists, theradar has penetrated so easily through one underground crater apparently filled with icethat MARSIS might be able to see 10 kilometers below the Martian surface if the locationis filled with ice that is transparent to the radar.The MARSIS deep ground penetrating radar was supposed to be turned on in the spring of2004. But the European Space Agency (ESA) responsible for the orbiting spacecraft'soperation decided it might be too risky to unfold the big solar panels that provide power.After a year of computer modeling tests, ESA and NASA went forward in June of 2005and turned the MARSIS radar on for the first time. The solar panels unfurled and the radarwent to work. Since MARSIS operates best in night time and the orbiter only has nighttime windows every five or six months, the first radar look into the Martian undergroundlasted only a few weeks into July 2005. From that work, JPL scientists published their firstresults in the November 30, 2005, issue of Science. The lead author and Co-PrincipalInvestigator for MARSIS is Jeffrey Plaut, Ph.D., at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory inPasadena, California. I talked with him this week about what the MARSIS radar has foundso far.Interview:Jeffrey Plaut, Ph.D., Co-Principal Investigator for MARSIS and Project Scientist on2001 Mars Odyssey Project, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California: \"Inthe polar regions, we saw a signal from the radar echoes that indicted the layered depositsconsist of basically pure ice, with only a small amount of dust mixed in. This particularcomposition was not known. It was widely assumed that these deposits were mostly ice,but our measurements indicate there is hardly any contamination by soil in those layereddeposits."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"MARSIS radargram of north polar layered water ice deposits. Water ice deposits appear as layers on therightof the upper black and white image. ESA: \"Two strong and distinct echoes coming from the area correspond toasurface reflection and subsurface interface between two different materials.\" By analysis of the two echoes,scientistsconcluded there is a \"nearly pure, cold water-ice layer about 1.8 kilometers thick, overlying a deeper layer ofbasalticregolith.\" No liquid water reflection. Image by: ASI/NASA/ESA/UnivRome/JPL/MOLA Science Team.HAS THERE BEEN ANY DEEP GROUND PENETRATING RADAR OF THE SOUTHPOLE?That's something we're working on at the moment. We don't have any results to report rightnow.WHAT ABOUT THE CRATER?It's been widely recognized that in the northern plains of Mars, there is a buried populationof impact craters from a previous surface before the northern plains were re-surfaced.What we were able to do with our ground penetrating system was to identify a fairly large200 to 300 kilometer diameter (125 to 187 miles diameter) structure we believe to be animpact basin that was not recognizable from any surface measurements. Liquid Water Reflection?MARSIS images from two different overhead passes reveal a 200 to 300 kilometer-wide (125 to 187 milesdiameter) crater burieda few hundred meters below surface deposits. In the lower image, a linear reflection parallel to the surface isseen in the arcs.Could it be liquid water? Image by: ASI/NASA/ESA/UnivRome/JPL.HOW DEEP IS THE BURIED CRATER?We believe the rim structure is very shallow buried, just a few hundred meters perhaps."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"But we also made a detection of a buried layer fairly deep about 2 to 2.5 kilometers deepthat is either the floor of the basin, or some other intermediate layer of basin fill material.We don't have any indication of liquid water from any of these observations. But it is veryinteresting that the signal penetrated quite easily through about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) ofmaterial in the crater and that suggests to us that material is probably ice-rich. So, althoughwe don't have signs of current liquid water, it's likely that at one time, this crater was filledwith liquid water that quickly froze over and was trapped in the Martian sub-surfaceprobably for several billion years.HOW MANY OF THOSE UNDERGROUND CRATERS MIGHT THERE BE?This particular crater feature is right at the mouth of several of the major outflow channels.It makes sense that this could be a place where water could get trapped. But whether that'sjust an accident of the location or whether it's a process that's common over much of thenorthern plains, we don't know yet.WHAT IS IT THAT COVERED UP THE LAYER OF CRATERS?There's debate about that. Some kind of layer of material. I guess the debate rages overwhether that material was deposited by volcanoes, by additional flows of water depositingsediment, or by wind activity moving dust around. There is no uniform agreement in the(science) community as to exactly what buried the Northern Plains. MARSIS Could See 10 Kilometers Through Pure IceIF YOU WERE SENDING RADAR INTO AN AREA WHERE THERE WAS LIQUIDWATER DEEP IN MARS. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT MARSIS CANPENETRATE AT LEAST 5 KILOMETERS UNDERGROUND, RIGHT?The penetration depth depends on several factors. One is very important: the material youare penetrating through. We've shown that ice is actually fairly transparent to the radar.We could probably see 10 kilometers through pure ice. If there is a substantial amount ofrock or soil, the penetration depths are much less. As to the question of detecting liquidwater: if the liquid water is in the first few kilometers of the sub-surface, we couldprobably see it. But again, it depends on what lies between the surface and any liquid layeror aquifer. But to date, we don't have any evidence that we've detected any liquid water inthe sub-surface, but the search is really just beginning because we haven't had a significantamount of time to observe under optimal conditions. Water Would Strongly Reflect Back MARSIS RadarWHAT WOULD BE THE DIFFERENCE TO YOUR TRAINED EYE BETWEEN THERADAR GOING THROUGH ICE VERSUS WATER?The radar will not penetrate through water. It will reflect off of water. So water is justabout the most reflective kind of material we might expect to find on Mars. So, if weshould detect a very strong reflection in the sub-surface, we can apply some analysis to thequantitative values of those radar echoes and make some kind of statement about whetherit's possibly water. But again, we haven't reached that point yet.What we have seen in the case of the impact crater is a possible again, this is only apossibility and it needs further analysis and more observations but a possible indicationthat this crater was at one time filled with water which has since frozen over. If that is acommon process in the northern plains of Mars, then that's a potential reservoir foradditional water that hasn't been identified yet because it's buried. We're a few steps awayfrom saying that we've identified a new or previously unknown reservoir of H2O. Martian Water for Future Manned Mission?PRESIDENT BUSH HAS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE AMANNED MISSION TO MARS IN A COUPLE OF DECADES. WHAT YOU AREFINDING SO FAR, WOULD WE BE ABLE TO GO TO MARS AND ACCESS THE ICEIN THAT BURIED CRATER AND USE IT SUCCESSFULLY FOR A MARTIAN BASE?You have to have several sort of 'if thens' (laughs) to answer that question! If we arecorrect and there is water ice in that crater, we suspect it's fairly shallow, a few hundred"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"meters. But, that could be much too deep for access by any kind of equipment that may beput down on Mars. You need some sort of drill rig.SO IDEALLY, IF YOU COULD FIND AN UNDERGROUND CRATER CLOSE TO THESURFACE AT THE EQUATOR THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ICE, THAT WOULD BEIDEAL?Yeah, I think so. I have heard discussions about accessible water, whether it's liquid or iceas being an important factor for a manned mission. So, yeah, sure, if there were confirmeddeposits of water ice at the low or mid-latitudes, that could be important for future mannedmissions. MARSIS Mission Budgeted by ESA Until End of 2007For the next six months or so, we'll be focusing on the Southern Hemisphere. Then weenter a period when the orbit is on the day side and we have to back off from ourobservations. Then toward the end of 2006, we'll get back into the night side in theNorthern Hemisphere.HOW LONG WILL MARSIS OPERATE?The mission is slated to continue for two more Earth years.ENDING IN 2007?We hope that's not the end, but right now the current mission plan runs out at the end of2007.IS THE LIMITATION ANYTHING TO DO WITH ENERGY AND POWER?Everything on the spacecraft is powered by solar energy, so the mission duration is set bythe program that manages the project, that's the European Space Agency.MEANING, THE SOLAR ENERGY WILL CONTINUE, BUT IT'S FUNDING TO KEEPDOING RESEARCH IS LIMITED?Yes, that's the limitation that all the agencies deal with when they have spacecraft thatkeep on going and going. So, they have to renew the mission periodically what they call'extended missions.' Right now, MARSIS is entering its first extended mission right now onthe books which is slated to last two years. When that period is up, the ESA will have tomake a decision as to whether to extend it again.\" European Space Agency Description of MARSIS\"MARSIS (Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding) is a lowfrequency, nadir-looking pulse limited radar sounder and altimeter with ground penetrationcapabilities, which uses synthetic aperture techniques and a secondary receiving antennato isolate subsurface reflections.\"The operation altitudes for MARSIS are up to 800 km above the Martian surface forsubsurface sounding and up to 1200 km for ionospheric sounding. In its standard operatingmode, the instrument is capable of making measurements in 1 MHz wide bands centered at1.8, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 MHz.\"MARSIS functions by transmitting a linear frequency modulated chirp using a nadir-looking dipole antenna. The return signal is received on both the dipole antenna and asecondary monopole antenna oriented along the nadir axis. The secondary antenna has anull in the nadir direction and receives primarily the off-nadir surface reflections. Thissignal can be subtracted from the main received signal during ground processing to reducesurface clutter. Both received signals are down converted to range offset video signalsbefore being passed to an analogue to digital converter. The resultant data are formattedby the MARSIS on-board digital processor and passed to the spacecraft for transmission toEarth.\"MARSIS operates in the following modes:* Subsurface Sounding* Active Ionospheric Sounding* Receive Only* Calibration"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"\"MARSIS will perform Subsurface Sounding when the spacecraft is less than 800 kmabove the Martian surface. In the highly eccentric orbit selected for Mars Express, thiscorresponds to a period of about 26 minutes, allowing mapping of about 100 degrees of arcon the Martian surface per orbit. Over the nominal mission lifetime, extensive coverage atall latitudes will be possible. To achieve this global coverage MARSIS supports bothdayside and nightside operations, although performance is maximized during the night(solar zenith angle above 80 degrees) when the ionosphere plasma frequency dropssignificantly and the lower frequency bands, which have greater ground penetrationcapabilities, can be used.\"Active Ionospheric Sounding will be carried out during certain orbital passes when theorbiter is less than 1200 km above the surface, in order to gather scientific data on theMartian ionosphere.\"More Information:For more about Mars, please see reports below in Earthfiles Archives :Â· 11/18/2005 -- Is the Sun Heating Up?Â· 11/09/2005 -- Dust Storm On Mars, Cosmic First Light and Black Hole At OurGalaxy's CenterÂ· 08/24/2005 -- Dust Devils and \"Lemon Rinds\" on MarsÂ· 06/23/2005 -- Mars Express Orbiter Finally Turns On Deep Ground-PenetratingRadarÂ· 03/26/2005 -- Spirit Rover Finds Magnesium Sulfate Near \"Larry's Lookout\" inColumbia Hills on Mars.Â· 03/20/2005 -- Astronaut John Young: \"The Moon Can Save Earth's Civilization.\"Â· 03/04/2005 -- Subterranean Life On Earth - and Mars?Â· 02/26/2005 -- Mars Spirit Rover Discovered Boundary Between Gusev Lava andOlder, Water-Soaked RocksÂ· 02/22/2005 -- Frozen Sea Near Martian Equator Size of Lake MichiganÂ· 09/21/2004 -- Part 2: Martian Water Ice and Organic MoleculesÂ· 09/20/2004 -- Part 1: Martian Water Vapor and Methane Overlap in EquatorialRegionsÂ· 05/06/2004 -- Formaldehyde, Ammonia and Benzene Molecules on Mars?
