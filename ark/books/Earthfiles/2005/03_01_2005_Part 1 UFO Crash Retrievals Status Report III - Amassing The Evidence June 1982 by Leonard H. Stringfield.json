Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. \"PROLOGUE: THE BIGGEST STORY EVER, NEVER TOLD \"Ever since World War II when the first UFOs, dubbed 'foo fighters,' becameofficially recognized, the mystery of their origin and intent has haunted the minds ofman. Most ponder the puzzlement skeptically amused; others want to believe andstraddle a philosophic fence guessing for answers. As we head into the decade of the1980s, serious research has not found the answer either, or the proof to qualify ananswer. Officially, the mystery remains ostensibly irresolvable. To those wary andwho have taken the time to probe, the official position is as mysterious as the UFOitself. In the decade of the 1970s, it was the big flap of 1973 that got national attention.Then, even the media got emoted over the number of close encounters. But officialWashington was ostensibly unmoved. The press cooled off and so did the public;both turned from curiosity to apathy. Research, learning from the experience,became better organized, but remained on square one, still debating the classicalencounters, EM effects, MIBs and still chasing down reports of lights in the sky. Then in the late 1970s, the stimulus of abductions in ever increasing number stirredup new controversies. Questioned was the efficacy of regressive hypnosis as ameans to determine hidden events during the inevitable time lapse. Seeking a meaning to all the seeming fantasies, research foundered with the popularextraterrestrial hypothesis and got nowhere in search for proof. Then it went off thedeep end to seek more exotic explanations where it still founders. In its frustration,even the old U. S. secret weapon answer has been resurrected. Officially,Washington said nothing; ostensibly it was not interested. The factor of time had notprovided the answer. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Whatever the 1980s bring, UFO landing en masse or gradual withdrawal, the past isa matter of record and the record - as most in research will agree - is hidden underan official lid of lead. For some cogent or conspiratorial reason, the real, raw facts -however they might stack up to form the answer - have not been bared. And asresearcher know, they cannot be secured through the Freedom of Information Act. I believe I know some of the real, raw facts about the hidden evidence. Each mightbe a piece to the puzzle. Yes, the facts, or alleged facts, are incredible. By humanstandards, maybe even ridiculous. For certain they are rooted in a legend that nagsresearch even today and looms as myth to the rest of the world. And so, it all beganas a rumor - a terse, unembellished rumor about a saucer and its crew of little menon ice at Wright-Patterson! But the notion was so improbable, it became funny. Tomake it funnier, some said the little critters were even green. Even research thoughtit was far out, so much so that it was simply unfashionable for anyone respectable inits ranks to even soberly talk about the possibility, let alone go on record to writeabout it. Everyone who had done their research spade work remembered FrankScully, who in the early 1950s wrote a book about a saucer crash in 1948 in Aztec,New Mexico. The book, using some allegedly shady characters, was declared a hoaxand Scully was axed into disgrace. But the Aztec story did not die. Over the long years, new rumors about other crashesemerged. According to witnesses untraceable, UFOs have crash landed. Or, as onesource avers, have even been 'shot down' by U. S. Air Force interceptors andretrieved under the highest degree of secrecy. I decided to dig into the rumors. In my book, Situation Red, The UFO Siege(Doubleday 1977), I made light mention of the UFO crash/retrieval subject. To mysurprise, my first live source surfaced to tell his story. A pilot in the militaryreserves, he seemed sincere, had no axe to grind or money to gain and he preferredanonymity. My new first person report and others, mostly secondhand, were included in my firstpaper, Retrievals of the third Kind which I presented as speaker at the Ninth AnnualMUFON Symposium in Dayton, Ohio, July 1978. Surprisingly, my proposed papergot unusual publicity. A story released through United Press wires was picked up byABC radio nationwide and into Canada. Just as surprisingly, after my talk: deadsilence. When I checked with ABC in New York, I was told they were moreinterested in Pete Rose of the Cincinnati Reds, who was trying to break a hittingrecord. Fortunately, however, what had been aired earlier was sufficient to open theproverbial flood gates. Emerging were more incredible data from new, independentand credible first person sources, each offering a substantive clue about a militaryretrieval operation, or information about his observation of the craft or preservedalien cadavers. All, fearful of reprisal and/or wanting no invasion of privacy, insistedon anonymity. Foremost of my informants during this climactic period, was a medical doctor onstaff of a major medical center, who alleged by letter to me (unsigned byprearrangement), that he performed an autopsy on an alien being in the early 1950s.Another informant, through an intermediary, was a CIA employee who guardedlyprovided some useful data in response to my questions. He also advised some dosand don'ts for me to use as a guide. Convinced that my pursuit into the UFO Crash/Retrieval subject was substantive -and despite the realization that I invited criticism for hearsay by not revealing theidentities of my sources - I released for publication my second paper throughMUFON entitled, The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome, Status Report II, January1980. My persistent probes into this strange and sensitive realm since 1980 have producedsome surprisingly sobering information and expectedly, some unpleasantries andfrustration. The latter, caused mainly by a series of rapid setbacks in the flow ofinformation first became apparent at some point in time during the late summer of1980 when some of my key first person informants, who had allegedly seen eitherthe alien craft or the cadavers, became mysteriously unreachable by any means ofcommunication. By the end of October 1980, after repeated and futile probes to reach these sources,I felt convinced that my pipelines had been deliberately cut. Also, in this time frame,my two key respondents - one medical and the other the CIA employee - admittedthey could no longer relate information to me. Implied was a tightening of security.Both would know, as both were still active in secret UFO projects. Even some newsources through intermediaries - who had promised information in person or by mail"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"- faded into sudden oblivion. As the erosive draught of information on this subject continued through 1981, thenegative noise of critics and rumor-mongers grew louder as they belittled my workor attacked my credibility. Feeling neutralized, I decided to withdraw into silenceand to watch and wait. Perhaps, I reasoned, there might be just one interloper tobreak through the web. Or maybe, there would be a signal, for good or bad. Butnothing. Unlike the two previous productive years when I gathered information and publishedtwo monographs with only minor interference, most of my efforts in 1981 resulted indisappointment. Aborted was my plan to publish my third paper slated for that year. Suddenly, starting in September 1981, the long silence was broken. As thoughsomebody pressed a button to 'On,' new sources emerged - eight, in fact - all in shortorder to each other. Encouraged by the sudden influx of new contacts, I negotiatedwith each for the next move. As before, I promised anonymity and then I waited.Three promptly became good first person reports. The others, however, faltered. Intime, like Cheshire cats, one by one each faded away. Soon realizing that theupsurge was not the beginning of a boom, I reclined again to re-evaluate my positionand the amassing material on hand and decided to start writing Status Report IIIwithout delay. During this period of resurgence, fortuitously news came from an unexpectedsource: a new letter surfaced from Barry Goldwater, U. S. Senator, Arizona.Underscoring his apparent distaste for UFO secrecy, it came in response to a lettersent by researcher, Lee Graham, of Aerojet Electric Systems, Azusa, California,who had written to him before without answers. As reminders this time, Graham hadenclosed copies of three previously published letters which had appeared in StatusReport II, all of which told of an Air Force denial to grant him access to a 'room' atWright-Patterson which stored UFO secrets. Significantly in this letter, datedOctober 19, 1981, quoted below, Goldwater went a step further, making referenceto the secret storage facility as the 'blue room':October 19, 1981 Letter from U. S. Senator Barry Goldwater,(R-Arizona) to UFO Investigator, Lee Graham: 'First, let me tell you that Ihave long since given up acquiring access to the so-called blue room atWright-Patterson, as I have had one long string of denials from chief afterchief, so I have given up. In answer to your questions, one is essentially correct. I don't know of anyonewho has access to the blue room, nor am I aware of its contents and I am notaware of anything having been relocated. I can't answer your question six, infact, I can't find anyone who would answer it. To tell you the truth, Mr. Graham, this thing has gotten so highly classified,even though I will admit there is a lot of it that has been released, it is justimpossible to get anything on it. I am returning your papers because I know they are of value to you.' Goldwater's reference to a 'blue room' at Wright-Patterson suggests a more in-depthoperation concealed behind the small front office of Project Bluebook. Curiously,the color blue brings to mind the 'blue berets' (See Case A-3, Status Report II) and'blue boys,' described in Case A-9 of this Status Report III. THE WITNESS MODEL The first person witness in crash/retrieval research might suddenly surface from outof Anywhere, U. S. A. Such a person, if his or her credentials are good, plays acrucial role because what he or she tells might provide a clue, or a corroborativelink, to lend credibility to the greatest story ever, never told. First person witnesses are rare. Even rarer are those allowing use of their identities.It seems there are risks in talking too much. They stress it; I sense it. When they talkfor the first time, I note every word carefully. There might be no second chance. Also noted is the witness's concern for matters of personal security. Usually in thesame breath, assurances are requested for anonymity and measures to prevent theinvasion of privacy. Simple requests, indeed, and I have honored them even at theexpense of my own reportorial credibility. And interestingly, in most instances,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"witnesses are not ufologists; curious, yes, but they do not want to be involved in thecrossfire of the skeptical media or undisciplined researchers. Paramount to the objectives of research and to me on its behalf is to establishcredibility for the witness. Is the witness sincere? Is his report accurate? And if oneor two are not, what of the others? Or we might ask: Are all reports perpetrated byhoaxers, the mentally sick, or by cells of manipulators peddling a package ofdisinformation? Investigation, even with adequate funds, cannot provide a readyanswer. On this premise, I suppose, we could challenge the veracity of any or allUFO reports in reputable research files - some of which are far more outlandish thana crash landed UFO. Sometimes in research, one can learn more about the sincerity of a person, whoclaims to know a secret, by what is unsaid. His or her true fidelity might reveal itselfthrough body chemistry, a dart of an eye, the twist of a smile, a play of the hand, orthe repetitive use of 'you know' to emphasize a point. But, as it is my work, theperson with sensitive information is not always personally available for an eyeball-to-eyeball evaluation. Most, for reasons of security, usually prefer the shield of anintermediary. Safe and pivotal, this go-between feels fewer pressures and knows thathe does not have to identify his source and can stop the dialogue at any time if theconditions of his source are not met. In this instance, I have only secondhand'chemistry.' And if the approach is made by phone, which is the way it usually is inresearch, then I have only a voice and its intonations. However, most intermediariesreaching me essentially pass the on-sight or telephone tests. Most, in short time, ifthe conditions are right, will provide credentials for themselves and often theirsources. While much can be debated about witness integrity, the model by which it ispresented for public review can also be debated. In this matter, I have had alldegrees of criticism from pockets of research. There is no argument againstconstructive criticism. I favor it. But, hurrah to the day when this subject can befully aired. Or when the Pied Piper can lead very witness to the point of signing anaffidavit or appear on TV without a stocking stretched over his face. But as one'insider' told me: even those steps would NOT be proof. To help clarify my position,Dr. Peter Rank, Chief of the Department of Radiology, Methodist Hospital,Madison, Wisconsin, who had heard all the complaints, explains his views in a letterpublished in the MUFON UFO Journal (March 1982) as follows:March 1982, Peter Rank, M. D., Radiologist: 'I would like to comment onthe reliability of information and method of presentation surrounding thepaper, The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome, made public by LeonardStringfield in January 1980. There has been some controversy about thereliability of Stringfield's data with special reference to his reluctance to gopublic with the names of his witnesses and informants. His failure to identifythe sources of information has been sued to cause some doubt upon thereliability of his data. This seems to be unfair. Perhaps the followingexplanation will help. For a generation now, ufologists have been unconsciously assuming that theJournalistic Model of reporting is the one which demands the most credence.Information published in the media demands that such stories reveal the who,what, where, when and why of the incident reported. It is assumed that suchcomplete disclosure lends authenticity to the story involved and indeed is arequirement for believability. Most ufologists have adhered to this principlewhenever possible. Such full disclosure according to the Journalistic Modelhas been counter-productive. In many cases, foreknowledge that their nameswould be published in the popular media has driven away UFO witnesses andcertainly has driven away any informants who cared to commentanonymously about the Crash/Retrieval Syndrome. It should now be clear to all dedicated ufologists more than a generation afterKenneth Arnold's sighting, that a different manner of reporting UFOinformation than the Journalistic Model is required. Perhaps anotheralternative should be adopted, specifically the Medical Model of reportingscientific information, and do so in accordance with case history technique.Medical literature frequently has need of describing objective and verypersonal information about patients. The literature is replete with such casehistories. In all cases the patient's anonymity is respected and the patientidentified only by initials. These case histories are never challenged on thegrounds that the patient's full name is not disclosed, and the underlyingintegrity of reporting is assumed as a matter of fact."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Might it not be useful for us to adopt a similar approach? Both witnesses andinformants would thereby be protected. Witnesses could then report all theirdata to serious researchers with the clear knowledge that they and theirfamilies would never be identified in any publication which might provoke thepopular media to descend upon them like locusts at a feast. Informants, manyof whom are discussing information that is highly classified, perhaps severallevels above the well known 'Top Secret' category, may then feel free to 'gopublic' with their information without fear of retribution. This wouldencourage others to come out of the closet and allow considerably moreinformation to develop about the Crash/Retrieval Syndrome. There is obvious journalistic precedent for this practice. Journalists are, andalways have been, very protective of their sources and have insisted in courtsof law that their sources remain anonymous. Legal attempts to forcejournalists to reveal sources of their information have failed. This guaranteedanonymity has served as a mighty bulwark of a free journalism. it could alsoserve as a mighty bulwark for a more liberated investigative ufology. I do not think that the criticisms by Stanton Friedman and William Moorehave merit. Their criticisms of Stringfield's desire to protect the anonymity andsafety of his sources stands outside the bounds of all reasonableness for avariety of reasons. Let me be clear that I respect their work. Still, I havepersonally talked to a UFO witness, a CE-III subject, and several militarytypes, and most seek to guard their privacy. It is quite clear that our firstresponsibility is to consider these people as 'patients' who first of all need ourassistance and support, and who second of all, need our guarantee that theirprivacy and good faith will not be abused.'\" Continued in Part 2 - Classified \"A\" Report and Hangar 18, Roswell, New MexicoCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
