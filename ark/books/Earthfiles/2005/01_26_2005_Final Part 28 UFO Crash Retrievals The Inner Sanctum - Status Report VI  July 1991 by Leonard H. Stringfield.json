Leonard Stringfield: (PHOTO PHANTASIES continued) \"3) Sensation and mystery were the names of the game when a real looking alienphoto made its rounds in Europe in late 1990. First to burst on the scene was a blackand white photo that surfaced from a Russian source which showed a front view of achubby-faced dead 'alien' with slanting eyelids covering a large pair of eyes. According to Michael Hesemann in Germany, who got an exclusive copy from areliable Russian source, the photo had a 'Canadian connection,' rumored to be ascientist who had sent a copy to the late Felix Zigel in Russia. Zigel, a scientistknown to the Western nations, was the Soviet's leading UFO researcher going backinto the 1970s. I published some of his findings in Situation Red: The UFO Siege. Also, it was rumored that the alien in the photo had a Roswell connection. Suddenly,its aura of mystery became important. Hesemann, sensing its importance, trustinglysent three or four copies to American researchers for examination and, as always,copies were soon in the hands of everybody. As research pondered its significance, a few willing to accept it as 'proof,' anotherphoto in color, showing a face similar to the black and white copy, began tomushroom in Europe. I got a copy from Rene Erik Olsen, a researcher inCopenhagen, Denmark, in December 1990. When I called him to learn his source,he could only say that it came from England. The mystery was soon solved. When I called Christian Page in Canada, requestingdata on the Carp crash case, we talked about other subjects, too, including alienphotos such as the rib cage phony and the photo that was currently circulatingshowing the fat-faced alien. Page, disturbed that it was making news, came outforthright to say that he was the person who took the colored photo in 1979 at aMontreal exhibition. Said Page in his letter of May 30, 1991, quoted in part: '... The humanoid in the picture, despite its amazing realism, was simply a waxreproduction that I had photographed at the Pavillon de 1 insolite, inMontreal, one of the permanent exhibits built for the Universal Exposition in1967.' Page further stated that the dummy was real-sized and dressed in a metallic suit (inreality, a scuba diver suit) and rested lengthwise under a plexiglass cylinder. So endsthe speculation and the mystery.

Small photo,courtesy of Michael Hesemann, Munich, Germany.\" A FINAL THOUGHT ABOUT THE INNER SANCTUM William Safire, in his nationally syndicated column on August 1, 1991, describes thestrange world of espionage as a 'surreal but real world replete with mystery,violence, hall-of-mirrors deception, the suspension of morality and the interplay ofhuman intelligence.' Analogously, it seems to fit the operations of the InnerSanctum, a metaphorical label I use to identify the clandestine forces who controlevery aspect of the UFO problem. I have become a part of this surreal world by both circumstance and choice, thelatter of which I exemplify by publishing Status Report VI. In summary, I believethat the so-called Inner Sanctum has substantial evidence of alien artifacts and lifeforms behind its walls. To announce all of its sobering secrets would be a risk thatcould re-shape our philosophies. In some ways, I can sympathize with the enormityof this public relations problem. Special to Status Report VI OPERATION DESERT STORM'S 'BAGHDAD BILLY' -- SHADES OF THE'FOO FIGHTER' OF WORLD WAR II The following disclosure, received from a reliable source requestinganonymity, is an analogy of the UFO's past and current behavior duringwartime. Pilots flying nighttime combat missions over Iraq, during Operation DesertStorm, encountered aerial interlopers which they eventually dubbed 'BaghdadBilly.' Although an object did not appear on radar, pilots described 'BaghdadBilly' as a steady white light which suddenly focused on their aircraft while itssource flew parallel off either wingtip. Each incident was of short duration.While totally unsettling to the pilots during the initial encounters, there wereno known hostile incidents. EPILOGUE: The Mixed Bag of Information As I prepare the final copy of this manuscript for the printer, I find writing theEpilogue is like sorting out worms from a can as new information, some of itdisconcerting, continues to come in from diverse sources."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"One caller aired his frustration over the inability to get a prospective 'inside'crash/retrieval source to talk. Three others called to relate that they had tried andfailed to get additional information from their firsthand sources whose stories areincluded in this report. While most contributors spoke reassuringly about theirdisclosures, two, however, gave me cause for concern, reporting that they havereason to suspect certain acts of mischief, perhaps as a 'warning message,' that couldaffect their livelihoods. One of the concerned informants called also to relate that he had been reliablyinformed of some new and nagging information that is in concurrence with the early,critical days of the foofighters, ghost rockets, green fireballs and the New Mexicansaucer crashes, all of which might have a German World War II connection. Oneitem of note was that a saucer had crashed in July of 1947 that had ties with a U. S.'biological experiment.' Incongruously, another item - according to my source - madereference to a retrieved saucer with artifacts exhibiting 'paleo-Hebraic' inscriptions.But, the gist of his revelations was that the reported crashes of UFOs with 'alien'bodies in 1947 was the beginning of a colossal cover-up to hide secret U. S. rocketexperiments. I've expressed my thoughts before about the alleged German scientists connectionand I ask again: why should maximum secrecy prevail today to hide outmodedrocket and aircraft experiments in the late 1940s? To have had a craft that couldperform like a foofighter, why was it not used in the Korean or Vietnam wars or torescue American hostages in Iran instead of helicopters? Details of the nature of the 'mischiefs' affecting both contributors must go unsaid atthis time. But it is noteworthy that both calls came to me within a two-day period,July 26-27, and if they are UFO-connected, it would certainly dampen the hopes foran officially relaxed policy. Setting aside for the moment the diversions of human frustration, nagging theory andseeming intrigue, let us now join Cheri Manet, a lady in Texas I feel that I can trust.She revealed to me that she had a close friend, a Major General in the U.S. Air Forcewith need-to-know credentials. According to Cheri, he told her piecemeal, over aperiod of years, the real story of the UFO without once compromising details tobreach his secrecy oath. Faithfully, she kept notes of his disclosures until his deathin 1987. Our acquaintance began as a result of a relative who had an unusual UFOsighting and she got my name from a researcher who had read Situation Red, TheUFO Siege. When Cheri mentioned her stored away notes, I expressed my interest.Although her family at first advised that she not share her notes with anybody, intime after many chats, she relented on the condition that I would not reveal theGeneral's identity or the names of the air bases where he had served as CommandingOfficer. I pledged my confidentiality. Her letter of June 4, 1991, with deletions,follows: Cheri Manet's Notes: ' ...I met the general during the summer of 1976 at afunction I attended on behalf of my company, Southwestern Bell. A few dayslater he called, asking me out to lunch. I went and it was the beginning of along and beautiful friendship. Even though there was over 25 years differencein our ages, we seemed to be on the same wave length. We stayed close untilhis death in 1987. ...After World War II, he was Commanding Officer of a European air base andlater was C. O. at a western base in the USA. He had retired just before wemet, but the Air Force still included him in meetings of high level importancewhich he called 'gray out' meetings. Of course, he could not tell me what theywere about. Not long after we met, we briefly discussed UFOs. I don't remember exactlyhow it came about, but I told him about my family's experience ... I remembersaying to him that I always wondered if the Air Force covered up sightings.He just smiled and never said a word. I asked if he personally believed inUFOs and aliens and he said that he did without a doubt and couldn'tunderstand how any thinking person could not believe. It was well over a year before he trusted me enough to talk about the subject.However, when he became a director of a museum, we talked a lot aboutspace and the UFOs. I remember once when he called, telling me about hismeeting with astronauts Armstrong and Stafford and how their lives had beenforever changed by what they had seen and heard. Some of the astronauts, hesaid, were having trouble dealing with some of the new concepts they mustaccept. He didn't go into detail."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" The following is in bits and pieces from our conversations over the years. Hementioned UFO crashes with aliens dead and alive. He told me there was avery high-level cover-up and that it went all the way to the highest office inthe land. Most of the information was in a Pentagon file that might one day beseen, but it was not the important stuff. It was kept separate and would neversee the light of day. When I asked why it was so secret, he said that thegeneral public couldn't handle what we knew. I told him that I was generalpublic and that I thought I could handle it. He said, perhaps I could, but itwould shake even my belief system were I to know all the facts. He also told me that many of the UFO sightings were our own experimentalships and that the United States has had its own flying saucer-type aircraft forquite awhile. I asked if he had seen them and, if so, where. He said, yes, andon more than one occasion at a base in the western part of the U. S. He asked me if I had ever heard of the crash at Roswell, New Mexico? At thetime, I had very little information on the crash, just some vague things Icouldn't even remember where I heard them. He said that in the summer of1947, a saucer had crashed on a man's ranch outside of Roswell. He said someof the material taken from the crash went to Ft. Worth and when tested, it wasbeyond our technology. Some pieces, he said, had symbols inscribed thatlooked like Egyptian hieroglyphics to him. He told me that he had seen thefilm explaining the whole case and it was top secret at the time. Some of theinformation has leaked out, he said, but even so, the government will never gopublic with it because they would have to explain the cover-up and that wouldopen the door to more questions. He said there had been other crashes like Roswell, some with dead aliens andsome not. ...On one occasion, he had been taken to a base in a western statewhere he saw, firsthand, a UFO that had crashed in the 1960s which had onlyminor structural damage. He said he was amazed to see such a thing,describing it as 100 feet long and 30 feet wide, with small windows around thebottom, but he was not allowed to board it. According to my notes, he also told me that we had a live alien taken from acrash site that had been studied at a base in California. He heard this from ahigh-ranking friend who had been involved in the study. He preferred not toelaborate. He later even seemed a little uneasy that he had mentioned it. When I asked him how long did he think the government could keep it allsecret, he replied as long as it wishes. He said that it involves national securityand how we deal with other countries. He pointed out that years ago, UFOswere spotted over the White House, and we were helpless to do anythingabout it. If that were to be common knowledge, we could lose control. Theincident got some coverage at the time, he said, but it was quickly coveredup.' Len Stringfield: \"On July 14, 1991, John Lear called me from his home in LasVegas to ask about the progress of my status report that I had discussed with him inApril. He asked if I had made any references to his friend, Bob Lazar, a scientistwell-known for his bold revelations in 1989 relating to his work at a secretinstallation in Area 51 at Groom Lake, Nevada. I replied that I had not on the basisthat I had not heard anything new from him for more than a year. Lear explainedthat Bob preferred not to get involved with researchers and the media, but he wouldtry to arrange for him to talk with me soon. The next day, Bob called me from hishome, explaining that he had only a few minutes to answer some questions I hadprepared. Most of his answers to my questions provided nothing new on subjects such asElement 115, the time dilation factor, the pressure of working and living underconstant surveillance, and the threats he endured when he went public. Of specific interest, I questioned him if he had seen, or had knowledge of, the use oflarge crystals as focusing elements for the propulsion drive of the craft. He repliedthat he had not seen crystals in the craft to which he had access, nor had he heard ofthe use of crystals. I asked because I was told by an 'inside' source, identified as Dr.Nick, that crystals were very much in evidence in an alien craft that had undergoneextensive studies at Wright-Patterson AFB in 1976. Dr. Nick, who was introduced tome by John Ford of LIUFON, revealed to me in a tape received July 14, 1991, thathe was sent to the base to study the electronic systems of the craft."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"In an earlier interview with Ford, during which time he also disclosed that he hadbeen involved in the Moriches Bay retrieval operation, Dr. Nick stated, '... the drivefor the craft is anti-gravity in nature and the crystals help in tuning in the rightfrequencies for the drive to work.' He added, 'The wide use of crystals in theirinstruments indicates that one or several crystals perform entire functions ofcomputer chips ...' With such an elaborate array of crystals in one alien craft and to the contrary, nocrystalline evidence in any of the craft visible to Bob Lazar, I could not help butwonder if the aliens were utilizing radically different drive systems. Or, if the crystalsystem represented the technology of another alien origin? Or if the crystals wererigged up as a dummy for Dr. Nick for purposes of disinformation? Or, was thegadgetry a secret U. S. experiment which needed his expertise? Of course, we don'tknow the whole Bob Lazar story either. But, it is a point to be seriously considered. Now, back to Lazar. I asked about the storage facilities on the craft for food or othermeans of sustenance and the accommodations for body wastes. He said he sawnone. I asked about the size of seats near the control panel. 'Small,' he said, andadded, 'The size to hold an infant aged about 18 months.' Then, to wrap up our chat,I asked if he still stood by all the statements he had made publicly. His response:'Yes, indeed.' And finally, I asked if Lear still believed that the nine craft Lazar saidhe had seen in Area 51 were of extraterrestrial origin? 'Absolutely, positively,' Learanswered. Where do I stand at this point in time in relation to the voluminous pile ofinformation I have received in recent months? I must say that my special researchinto UFO crash/retrievals seems to be sensitively close to reality. Bill Moore, a pastcritic of my work, stated in his September 30, 1989, issue of Focus, quoted in part: Bill Moore, Focus, September 30, 1989: 'Drawing from my own knowledgeand experience, I can summarize the individuals and organizations who werethe subject of intelligence community interest between 1980 and 1984. It isimportant to remember here that in some cases, I was not personally involved,but rather only aware of these goings-on through conversations with others....Stringfield remained the subject of some interest through 1983, after which Iheard very little about him. The C/I people seemed to know a lot about Lenand his sources. The impression I had was that someone else much closer tohim than I was keeping tabs on his activities, but of course, I never knew forcertain.' Fortunately, I have other sources today who seem to know that I am currently asubject of interest to the intelligence community. If I could draw any conclusionsfrom the travails of my past experiences, then I am also being subjected to bothgood information and disinformation to use in this report. To get a balance of views, I flipped over the proverbial coin to Dick Hall, a boardmember of the Fund for UFO Research and a trusted colleague since 1954, for hiscritique of my finished manuscript. His response to the revelations of some of myinformants, as expected, was on the line with no punches pulled. 'Barnabas' was the first target. Said Dick, 'Who is Albert Collins (alias Barnabas)?He has no credentials. Why should we believe anything he says? Statements aboutRand, the CIA and the Vatican sound like something the other Cooper (William)would cook up.' Next, the Air Force Colonel (via Tim Cooper): Said Dick, 'Though the Colonel'sstatements contain some nuggets of truth, others about science, technology andmilitary affairs sound questionable.' Regarding Dr. Epigoni, Dick was bothered by some of the statements he made inone interview which were in obvious conflict with those he made later. 'Dr. Nick,' said Dick, 'does not inspire confidence at all, engaging in pseudo-scienceand gobbledygook. For example, the Doppler Radar System is for traffic control tospot storm systems and to term it a 'weapon' is outrageously false. I am willing to betthat he is a fraud or disinformation specialist. Finally I ask: If disinformation is as rampant as it seems, what are the orchestratershiding/ considering the time and money spent on hall-of-mirror distortion of facts toconfuse researchers, there must be a purpose. Is hiding the truth, as the MajorGeneral told Cheri Manet, truly in mankind's best interest?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Veritas Vincet Leonard H.
