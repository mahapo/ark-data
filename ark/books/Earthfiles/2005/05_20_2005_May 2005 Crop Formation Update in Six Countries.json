[See 052204Earthfiles.]The list included:- four patterns in yellow flowering oil seed rape in Germany;- four patterns in oil seed rape in England;- one pattern of grass circles in Hoeven, Holland;- one circle geometry of wheat in Poland;- one pattern of circles laid down in tall pasture grass in Queensland, Australia;- and randomly downed wheat along straight lines in Mexico.So far in 2005, there have been 16 patterns reported in six countries, with some unusualrandomly downed crop patterns in the United States and Mexico.1) GermanyReporting one genuinely anomalous pattern in oilseed rape and three as human-made.May 6, 2005 - Sinsheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Berwangen/MassenbachhausenAbove : Sinsheim in Baden-Wurttemberg Province of Germany, a region wherecrop formations have reoccurred over the past ten years.Below: Pattern and measurements of circles reported in oilseed rape on May 6, 2005.Diagram © 2005 by Andreas Mueller, www.kornkreise-forschung.de.2) EnglandReporting eight geometric patterns in oilseed rape in six counties: South Yorkshire County,Oxfordshire County, Wiltshire County, Hampshire County (Hants), Dorset County andEast Sussex County."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"South Yorkshire County, Oxfordshire County, Wiltshire County, Hampshire County (Hants), Dorset Countyand East Sussex County are highlighted in yellow where crop formations have emerged so farby May 20, 2005.

It was found some time after a UFO was witnessed by a numberof people (\"Are they here?\" April 29, 2005, Cypress Mail).\"Are they here?By Jean Christou(Copyright © Cyprus Mail 2005 Archive Article - Friday, April 29, 2005)Wednesday's 'UFO sighting' reopens the caseA BRITISH resident in Cyprus yesterday reported seeing a UFO as hetraveled along the Nicosia-Larnaca highway on Wednesday night.The man, who did not wish to be identified, said the UFO had been witnessed"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"by several other motorists who had all slowed down their vehicles to watchthe spectacle at around 8.45pm.\"At first I thought it was a helicopter. It was in front of me and as soon as sawit I started slowing down and so did the people in front of me and then itspeeded up at an incredible speed, hundreds of miles an hour in seconds andliterally disappeared in front of our eyes,\" the man said.He said the sighting happened at around 8.45pm. He said al the cars in front ofhim had slowed down trying to digest what they had seen.\"It was amazing. I don't know what it was but it was bizarre. It was up in thesky. It looked like the kind of height of a low-flying plane or a helicopter.That's why I didn't immediately think it was odd and then as it started to moveand speed up I thought, 'This is weird'. It was bright white sphere of lighthovering slowly,\"The man said he checked online yesterday morning and found that UFOsightings were not all that uncommon in Cyprus.\"I had heard about UFOs. I'm not a skeptic but I think you can't reallycomment unless you have had an experience and for me when I can't have asane explanation for what I see I can't think of anything else it could be. Itwas not the kind of thing you could miss. It was incredible,\" he added.Police said yesterday no one had reported any UFO sighting, as did theLarnaca Airport Control Tower.\"The only thing written in the log book for that time last night is 'We need newchairs for the control tower',\" said one Civil Aviation official.The official said however that the radar does regularly register what seem tobe aircraft but which disappear after three revolutions of the radar.\"We call them Angels,\" said the official adding that they generally put these'phantoms' down to weather interference. \"Of course we are angels hereourselves,\" he said.Ioannis Fakas from the Fakas Institute of Astronomy said nothing had beenreported to him either. In fact he said he had been called to Limassol to lookat a reported crop circle in a field outside the town.He decided however that the crop circle, which was around 150 metres wide,was probably man-made. Crop circles, which are said to be mathematicallyprecise designs imprinted into a field of crops without actually damaging orkilling the plants, are often associated with aliens.Fakas said he believes people see UFO's but does not believe they are of alienorigin. As an astronomer he said he does think it's logical that life must existelsewhere in the universe, but does not believe they visit earth.He said that research has shown that 93 per cent of all UFO sightings areexplainable.\"I don't believe men from other worlds would come all the way here and thentry to hide from us,\" he said.Whatever they are, UFOs have been spotted over Cyprus on many occasionsin the past. In March 2002 a Swiss playwright who had just retired to Paphos,said he spotted a silver, saucer-shaped object 'emerging from the clouds' as hewalked along the beach. The UFO apparently hovered before 'floating down'and disappearing behind some rocks.\"Linda Leblanc said she and John Knowles, her partner at the Paphos-basedPyschognosia, which looks into paranormal incidents, said they had seenUFOs on several occasions over Coral Bay.She said Wednesday's sighting by the British resident was interesting as thereappear to have been other witnesses. \"We keep a roving eye on things and ofcourse we are always looking ourselves,\" she said.\"There is plenty of good evidence to support UFOs. There is no doubt in ourminds that something is going on so we're not surprised to hear about this. Wedon't really know what they are but there have been some links to the military.You see a lot of sighting around bases. It could be testing new technology.\"Knowles said it was useful for people to report such incidents. \"What is"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"necessary is to have multiple witnesses and they should record the exactdetails and have everyone sign it. I'd be happy to pass it on to Mutual UFONetwork,\" he said.\"There is too much of a tendency on the part of the establishment to sneer anddisdainfully dismiss everything. It always helps to have more and moreevidence.\"Knowles confirmed that sightings are fairly common in Cyprus. \"I've had acouple of sightings myself,\" he said. 5) MexicoA randomly downed pattern in oats; and a second formation yet to be updated.Randomly downed pattern in oats reported May 1, 2005, in Morelia,Michoacan, Mexico. Photograph © 2005 by www.laesferaazul.com. 6) United StatesThere have been at least three reports of randomly downed crops in Oregon, NorthCarolina and Arizona. The most recent this week in Arizona outside Phoenix is estimatedto be about 600 feet long made up of three long parallel strips laid down in wheat.May 18, 2005 - Tolleson near Phoenix, ArizonaThree long, parallel strips were reported laid down in a wheat field near Lower BuckeyeRoad and 75th Avenue in Phoenix, Arizona. Jeffrey Wilson, Director of the IndependentCrop Circle Researchers' Association (ICCRA) in Ohio, reports that ICCRA member,Ruben Uriarte, learned about the Tolleson crop anomaly from Salvador Estrada and VictorCamacho after they called a Spanish-language radio station with news about the cropanomaly. Jeff Wilson asked Rod Bearcloud Berry to investigate and e-mailed, \"Bearcloudreports that there are three linear flattened pathways approximately 525 to 600 feet inlength that are parallel to the power lines and the road. Interspersed between the threepathways are a series of irregular flattened shapes, none of which cross any tramlines.\"Jeff further searched Google Maps and found that \"their satellite photography shows anunusual ground feature in the same region: three linear, nearly parallel strips with novegetation. We don't know when these satellite photos were taken, and the orientation ofthe 3 lines is different than what Bearcloud has discovered flattened in Tolleson on May19, 2005. But it appears that both events have occurred in the same field. We don't knowwhat this feature is yet that appears on the Google satellite photos.\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Google Map satellite photos above and below show three parallel long strips in upper left field.In lower right field, there are a series of \"dots\" along tramlines that are also unexplained.Below is close-up of parallel strips in satellite image.Ground photograph of one of the three long strips in Tolleson wheat fieldtaken May 19, 2005, © 2005 by Rod Bearcloud Berry.May 15, 2005 - Hickory, North CarolinaDowned barley in three fields that cover 25 acres about 1.5 miles down Robinson Roadfrom U.

In that area, only someof the grass is compressed, while large swaths and small tufts still stand tall.No noticeable paths lead from one squashed spot to another.
