Fish and Wildlife Service Yellow spot marks the site in the Shark Slough about 3 to 4 miles NNW of Pay-hay-okee Overlookin Everglades National Park where a partly digested 6.5-foot-long American alligator was found onSeptember 26, 2005, hanging out of a headless, 13-foot-long Burmese python's belly. American alligators in the Everglades National Park (ENP) can grow ten to fifteen feet long. Photographcourtesy ENP. October 21, 2005 Homestead, Florida - Until recently, the top predator in the FloridaEverglades has been the American alligator. The males can grow to nearly fifteen feet longand a couple of feet wide. The females are a little smaller, around ten feet. Their long teethand claws are lethal weapons and their jaws are like steel traps. Nothing wanted to takethem on until people started throwing their unwanted adult Burmese python \"pet\" snakesin the Everglades to get rid of the uncontrollable monsters which can grow to twenty feetlong, or more. The python has a hinged jaw that allows it to swallow large prey after it hassqueezed its victim to death. A small child is as vulnerable as a house cat. Burmese python, originally native to Burma and southeast Asia,can grow to 25 feet and has an appetite for anything it can get its hinged jaws around.Since 2003. there have been at least four known python battles with American alligators."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Two resulted in a draw and two seemed to favor the alligator. The last encounter wasdefinitely a draw when both creatures died. That's the photograph that went around theworld in early October of a python body partially engulfing an alligator. The python's headwas missing and its belly seemed to have burst perhaps from indigestion after swallowingmost, or all, of the alligator. The location was in the Shark Slough about 3 to 4 miles north,northwest of the Pay-hay-okee Overlook, which means \"River of Grass\" in SeminoleIndian language.

Originally, the two men had hoped to fly the python and alligator to alab, but their flesh was too soft from decomposition after death. Some wondered if thealligator had been alive when it was swallowed and might have clawed its way out of thesnake's belly. But Skip Snow told me this week he found definite evidence that the6.5-foot-long alligator had been inside the 13-foot-long python.September 26, 2005, photographs © 2005 by Michael Barron, Everglades National Park helicopter pilot."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Interview:Skip Snow, M. S., Wildlife Biologist, Everglades National Park, Homestead, Florida:\"It was quite extraordinary. I had never seen anything like that. We had seen otherencounters before, but certainly not one where we could confirm a snake had the alligatorentirely within the digestive track which is what we deduced from looking at the intestinaltract. At one point, the alligator was indeed all the way inside the snake, but then for somereason that is not fully known, the side split and burst. So, here was sort of half alligator,half snake creature...SO FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW HAVING WORKED IN THE FLORIDAEVERGLADES FOR A LONG TIME, YOU HAD NEVER SEEN SOMETHING LIKE APYTHON TRY TO EAT AN ALLIGATOR BEFORE?No, we've never witnessed that. When I opened the snake, the tissue was quite soft. It wasnot too difficult to dissect the lower portion of it and the gut and see if the head andshoulders were still wrapped by the python's stomach muscle. That was pretty clear that ithad been in the digestive tract. Missing Python's HeadWHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THE PYTHON'S HEAD?I don't know for sure, but my best guess having looked at other carcasses especially inwetland systems or water once the carcass floats, is bloated and is floating, the head isdenser and doesn't float as well as the rest of the body and is the first to hang down in thewater. I believe the absence of the head was post mortem after the snake's death andprobably was the result of scavenging turtles, some kinds of fish such as crayfish, andthings like that which came and nibbled away at the head hanging down in the water.It certainly was one of the most extraordinary things I've seen. More than that,underscored by the fact that here is this large, extraordinarily large predator that has neverbefore occurred in the wild in the North American continent. Now we are faced with thefact that it's breeding, it's out in the wild, it almost borders on the absurd that I even haveto deal with it! It's now a condition of part of my job to have to consider what to do withthis. It's almost beyond thinking sometimes to look at this. \"Absurdity\" of Burmese PythonsLet Loose in North AmericaTHAT YOU ARE NOW HAVING TO DEAL WITH AN ASIAN BURMESE PYTHON INADDITION TO THE BIG AMERICAN ALLIGATOR.The big alligator is not a problem. That's a known because it's a native here. The absurdityof it is the size and scale of this predatory animal being the python which has beenintroduced. And it's really something \"we\" the human collective \"we\" have done toourselves. It's not like these snakes have stowed away and come over unbeknownst to usand made their way like an exotic flu virus. We did this to ourselves. We trade in theseanimals. We sell, we breed, we move animals about and within the pet trade at large, we"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"always run the risk of this occurring. Now, it's the extreme absurd end of it.If you were to look at it as a willful act, thinking about how absurd it would be if someonecame to me as a park biologist and proposed, 'We should introduce tigers to theEverglades. It's a large, predatory top-of-the-line animal. Let's introduce tigers.' Think howabsurd that is. Well, it's the same idea, just a different class of animal. But some days,that's how it strikes me when I see encounters, things like this most recent incident. Part ofme just thinks how absurd and I have to deal with it.RIGHT. AND THAT THESE WERE BASICALLY THROWN AWAY PETS THATBECAME TOO MUCH FOR THEIR OWNERS.Yes. We believe for the most part is what we're dealing with is a result of the number ofyears of intentional releases from unwanted pets. There is always the possibility that somehave come as unintentional escapees or releases. But by and large, we feel that most ofwhat we're dealing with are results of pythons that have gotten too big. They have wornout their welcome, they've exceeded the economic ability of people who have ownedthem, or people have moved, or the spouses can no longer tolerate. Whatever the situationmight be, these animals have been turned loose over time and now we're faced with abreeding population.\" Breeding Burmese Pythons Threaten Everglade EcosystemAnother scientist who has been working in the Everglades since the early 1970s is FrankMazotti, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Wildlife Ecology at the University of Florida in Ft.Lauderdale. Prof. Mazotti is extremely alarmed at the rapidly spreading population ofBurmese pythons that are not supposed to be in Florida, let alone North America. Nearly200 Burmese pythons have been killed, or removed from, the Everglades since 2002.When their bellies have been opened in necropsies to see what the big snakes have beeneating, endangered species have been found, including the beautiful White Ibis that theEverglades park has tried so hard to protect. Pythons also like to go after bird eggs. Dr.Mazotti points his finger at the exotic pet trade and says unless it is stopped or stronglycurtailed, the Burmese python will continue to spread and wreak havoc on the Evergladesecology.Frank Mazotti, Ph.D., Associate Prof. of Wildlife Ecology, University of Florida, Ft.Lauderdale, Florida: \"Burmese pythons are incredibly popular in the pet trade becausethey are so easy to breed and because they have their mystique of being a python. So, it'safter all of these years repeated over and over again, getting more frequently, it reallydramatically got everyone's attention in the last two years.IN JUST THE LAST TWO YEARS?In just the first two years. You can look at the last 20 years and I'll be you 90% of thepythons caught in the park certainly more than 80% - have been captured in the past 2years. Part of that is because repeatedly letting go these pet snakes, boy snakes met girlsnakes and now we've got baby snakes and now they are breeding. Once they startedbreeding, that's when the numbers started skyrocketing.HOW DO YOU THINK THIS RECENT BURMESE PYTHON ATTACKED THEALLIGATOR IN THE FIRST PLACE? WOULD IT HAVE TRIED TO KILL IT FIRSTBEFORE INGESTION?Nobody has seen one of these fights start. What I think happens is that they both like theedges of wet and dry areas and that's where they are likely to encounter each other. In oneinstance, it was in a small pool near a culvert underneath the road and the alligator wasobserved right after it had grabbed a python and the python was still alive. Under thosecircumstances though, the alligator was able to I think it was about an 8 foot alligator and9 foot python. The alligator was able to subdue the python and swallow it after - it tookawhile for the alligator to get the python down.And then in 2004, on one of the park trails, a number of park visitors witnessed a battlebetween a python and an alligator that they don't know how it ended, but the alligatorswam away with the python in its jaws.The 4th one was in 2003 and that was along another park trail and it was another battleencounter and in that circumstance, it looked like the alligator had won. But it let go of thepython and the python swam away. There was no evidence that the python had died as aresult of the encounter: that is, they did not find any bodies.In one, the alligator clearly won. One where the alligator probably won. One that was adraw. And one where I guess there were two that were a draw. Because although the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"python swallowed the alligator, it does not look like the python was a winner in that one.HOW DID THAT PYTHON LOSE ITS HEAD?Probably another predator. It could even have been another alligator. It depends on howdecomposed it was. After they start decomposing, turtles and crayfish and lots of smalleranimals can get involved.SO, IF WE HAD BEEN THERE WITH A HIDDEN CAMERA, WE MIGHT HAVESEEN A STRUGGLE. THE SNAKE SOME HOW ENGORGES...You might have seen a python attack an alligator, only to be subsequently attacked by abigger alligator which would have I would like to be shopping around that footage.AND THAT CONTRARY TO THE FIRST NEWS REPORTS, IF THE SNAKE HADGOTTEN ITSELF AROUND THAT ALLIGATOR AND EVEN IF THE ALLIGATORWAS HAVING THOSE REFLEXES OF CLAWING INSIDE THE SNAKE IT WAS NOTTHAT THE ALLIGATOR GOT OUT OR THAT THE SNAKE EXPLODED?That's my I think that is the most likely scenario I'm going to give you a caveat here. That'swhere the snake swallowed the alligator, doesn't digest it, dies and they both start todecompose. But I would not call it an explosion. Say you have a balloon in your hand. Itwouldn't be a bang, it would be a fizz.SORT OF LIKE THE TISSUE DETERIORATING AWAY.Right, and all the gases start getting out in more of a puff than a bang. I think rupturewould be a more accurate term than explode. But if you're on the 6 o'clock news, the term'explode' sounds a whole lot better. Invasion of Non-Local Animals\"Greatest Environmental Threat in United States\"STEVEN WILLIAMS, WHO IS DIRECTOR OF THE U. S. FISH AND WILDLIFESERVICE, SAYS THAT THE INVASION OF NON-LOCAL ANIMALS SUCH AS THISASIAN BURMESE PYTHON BEGINNING NOW TO POPULATE THE FLORIDAEVERGLADES IS 'ONE OF THE GREATEST ENVIRONMENTAL THREATS IN THEUNITED STATES.' I WONDERED IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON HIS STATEMENT?That is absolutely true. Almost everywhere you go, there is some non-native species that iscausing major problems and costing lots of money for control. Certainly, right up therewith loss of habitat and pollution. In fact, I would say that invasion by non-native speciesis biological pollution. And it's just as deadly as the chemical kind.WHAT IS THE WORST CASE WITH THIS POPULATION EXPLOSION OF BURMESEPYTHONS IN THE EVERGLADES?The worst case is it's going to have tremendous ecological impact as a top-down predator.Clearly, it's staking a claim to be at least an equal to the alligator. That means it affectsevery other animal than it's bigger than it can eat. It can compete with other native speciessuch as Indigo snakes, which are endangered. Indigo snakes also get very large 7 to 8 feet.So, for a large part of its life, Indigo snakes will be competing with Burmese pythons forfood.THE BURMESE PYTHON CAN GET UP TO 20 TO 25 FEET.And then they can start eating Indigo snakes. So, not only is it a competitor, but it's apotential predator. One of the things that worries everybody about Burmese pythons is thatthey are very much a generalist in their diet. That means they will eat whatever isavailable. They eat mammals and birds and other reptiles. There are lots of endangeredspecies in the Everglades, I think more endangered species in Florida than any other stateexcept maybe California. If the pythons get established and they start eating everything, itcould be a big problem.WHAT YOU MEAN IS: IT'S ALMOST LIKE A MONSTER IN A MOVIE THAT IT ISPOPULATING IN THE EVERGLADES -ORIGINATING FROM ASIA - AND CAN EATJUST ABOUT ANYTHING THAT IT WANTS TO.That's correct. Since they get bigger than 20 feet, it's pretty much (they can eat) what theywant."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Human Children As Python Prey?WHAT ABOUT THE VULNERABILITY OF CHILDREN?Anything small is always the most vulnerable to a predator. Small children are morevulnerable to alligators and certainly it is no different to pythons. The size makes themattractive. The way they behave makes them attractive, walking down to the water's edgeand splashing around. You're a python, you go yum! no hair. What Can Be Done to Control EvergladesBurmese Python Population Explosion?WHAT IS IT THAT THE STATE OF FLORIDA OR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AREDOING NOW TO CONTROL THIS BURMESE PYTHON POPULATION EXPLOSION?I think there are two critical steps that the state and federal governments need to engagein. One is to ask the question and hope answer it: what can we do to stop pythons beingreleased? There is no control method that is going to be successful if people keep releasingpythons. That's why we're in this problem. We can't keep doing it and hope to solve theproblem. So, that's the first step and that's probably the responsibility of the state.Then the second issue is: what are we going to do to get rid of the pythons that are outthere already? I think it focuses on pythons in the Everglades National Park. I think whatwe need to do is have an integrated research and control methodology put into place so westart removing pythons that are out there, but at the same time, we learn how to do itbetter and smarter and less expensively.HOW DO YOU THINK THAT SHOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED?I think we need to follow very much the same procedures they followed in coming up withthe control methods for plants, like Brazilian pepper. You need to understand how theanimal makes a living. You need to understand what it's vulnerable to. You need tounderstand where it lives, when it moves all the things that make your ability to traffic andremove the snakes more successful. Those are really on the top of the list of theinformation we need to have.IF THEY ARE TRAPPED AND REMOVED, WHERE DO YOU TAKE THEM TO?When you have a large non-native species like this, really almost your only alternative isto euthanize it. Nobody wants that's why they let the snakes go in the first place. Youmight say, 'Oh, I'll get this python at 3 feet and grow it up to 12 feet and then I'll donate itto a zoo.' Zoos don't want those animals. They have all the animals of that size that theyneed already. So it's impossible to get rid of snakes those sizes. And one that has grown upin the wild will never become accustomed to humans so it's never going to make a goodpet. So, the regretful situation that we're placed in is that we have to euthanize the snakesthat we capture and remove.SO BASICALLY THE ONLY PROGRAM IS CAPTURING THE PYTHONS ANDKILLING THEM?That's correct.\"More Information:Skip Snow is also working on control efforts: \"There are a number of things we are tryingto do to control the python spread. One is to ensure there are no more snakes released. So,the park is promoting a slogan and materials that revolve around the idea: 'Don't let itloose, be a responsible pet owner.' We are trying to get people to consider that and findother alternatives other than releasing animals when they are no longer wanted. Plus, learnbeforehand what they are getting into before they make those 'pet' purchases.\"We're also working on ways to prove our ability to remove the animals that are here. Thatinvolves a couple of things. We have a proposal to try and adequately research and designeffective traps which might be baited. We might use artificial lures in traps that could workin both flooded and dry land environments. Also, we are working on training dogs to sniffout pythons. A dog, or dogs, might alert us to the presence of pythons which we can thenhand capture and remove. Dogs are used to sniff out exotic snakes such as the brown treesnake in Guam and Hawaii.\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Website: National Park Service: http://www2.nature.nps.gov/YearinReview/02_B.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
