Barry, Director of 20th C. UFO Bureau Return to previous Part 2To be more computer-friendly, the reprint has been divided into parts. Here begins Part 3of Status Report II, written in January 1980. The series of status reports, I through VII,were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report IIIbegins at Earthfiles. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. For all theprevious status reports, see Earthfiles Archives. Leonard H. Stringfield:\"CASE A-6 Reporting information from a firsthand witness is a criterion of this second paper.However, in this instance, I must rely on an intermediary of trust and his willingnessto replay a number of informative tapes over a period of 18 months for me,recording the voice of a former C.I.A. employee. Normally, this reporting proceduremight raise doubts about any such informant, but it is my judgment based on a longperiod of communication by phone, correspondence, and tape that my intermediaryis an honest person. To this date, there is no hint of deception in his role. Just as certain in my belief that my intermediary has been honest with me, I musttherefore believe that this informant friend, the former C.I.A. employee is what heposes to be. Hopefully, the information he relates is true. I have heard his voice andhis revelations a number of times on tape. At this writing I feel I know him as aperson of authority, yet personable; crisp of tongue, leaving more questionsunanswered than answered; and a person whose voice intonations hint that he has akeen sense of wit. In short, I feel that both he and his taped voice I have heard arebona fide. My intermediary is Robert D. Barry. He is Director of the 20th Century UFOBureau, residing in Yoe, Pennsylvania, and he's been a UFO researcher and lecturersince 1957. My first contact with Barry came in March 1978, when I learned of hisknowledge of a crashed UFO with occupants. I reached him by phone, explainedthat I was working on a paper to be addressed to the MUFON Symposium inDayton, Ohio, and was asked to submit a letter to further identify myself and myobjectives. In response, Barry sent me the following letter which I had quoted in partin Abstract # 14 of my first paper:1978 Letter from Robert D. Barry: ' ... My sources of information on thecrashed UFO subject involve quite a few, but my major sources number four,including one within Intelligence circles as well as a scientist. As it relates tothe crashed UFO of 1962, it occurred in the state of New Mexico. The craftexperienced flight difficulty at a time it was being tracked on military radar. Itwas tracked across two southwestern states before coming in over NewMexico. Military jets were sent up for intercept. As the craft moved in overthe state of New Mexico, it lost altitude and continued to experience flightdifficulty. It impacted on desert sands at an estimated 90 m.p.h. Its undersidehit the sand as a plane coming in for a landing. Its landing gear was not downand its flight pattern at impact gave the indication that the two occupants in"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the craft were evidently dead at the time of the crash ... hence the flightdifficulty experienced by the craft. The craft was 68 feet in diameter and 13 feet in height ... typically circular.The two beings discovered inside the craft were 42 inches each in height.Each being was donned in a one-piece suit that contained no buttons orzippers. The occupants were removed the following day after impact to amajor medical university hospital in the U. S. where skin tests and otherscientific analyses were performed. Skin color was gray-pink. Head slightlylarger for a size of the body. Eyes somewhat larger than normal, but the nosewas small with little protrusions. ...No ear lobes, but a hole at each side of thehead where we have ears.Then, of course, inside the hole area was the innerear portion. Mouth very small and thin lips. The circular-shaped craft wasdescribed as exploratory and was removed to a major military base in thesouthwest where scientists and engineers were assigned to work on the craft inan attempt to discover its power of propulsion. On this particular case, a totalof twenty individuals were involved in the investigation and research. Sincethat time, three of them have died of natural causes, leaving a total of 17familiar with the incident and follow-up research.' As it turned out, I invited Bob Barry to accompany me in Dayton to air a letter hehad received allegedly from the C.I.A. The letter, using a C.I.A. masthead,concerned Barry's recent involvement in producing material about the 1962 crashfor a documentary film about UFOs being made by Sun Classic Films. In summary,because of the sensitivity of some of the material about the crash incident, the letterdirected Barry to visit the C.I.A. offices for consultation. However, when Barrychecked with the C.I.A. for affirmation, they claimed no knowledge of the letter.Mystified, Barry nonetheless felt that the letter deserved more than a brush-off anddespite the C.I.A.'s denial as its sender, there were certain aspects of the letter'scharacter and content that warranted further investigations. After many discussions of the letter's pros and cons with Barry, I felt that itscontents - inasmuch as it tied in with the 1962 crash case - should be aired for publicview. Through June and early July 1978, Barry and I oftentimes questioned theC.I.A. letter's validity. We tried to rationalize its content, or to find a hidden sinistermotive, and guess who, if not official, had the effrontery to use a C.I.A. mastheadfor spurious purposes. We guessed at a few likely researchers as the culprit. Butagain, we agreed to air the letter in Dayton. Then, in mid-July, Barry called me to relate that his C.I.A. friend had advised himnot to air the alleged C.I.A. letter. In his opinion, it was not genuine. But because ofthe commitment to air the letter and still uncertain of a possible C.I.A. covertmotive, we felt it was too late to back down. To back down would create even moresuspicion in the eyes of research. On July 29, 1978, Barry exposed the letter and, as expected, some researchers werecritical of Barry for presenting it and of me for allowing it. For me, however,regardless of the letter's intent or authenticity, Barry's C.I.A. friend had made anhonest evaluation. That, and many subsequent events, helped substantiate my faithin Barry's informant. Following is a sampling of other C.I.A. revelations from Aprilthrough July 29, 1978, during the critical period while preparing my first paper, andfollowing the threat-on-my-life episode in Dayton. Len Stringfield Summary of April through July 29, 1978 Information fromRobert D. Barry, Director of the 20th Century UFO Bureau, Yoe,Pennsylvania: - Barry learned that UFOs seemed to have helped influence Israeli forces in atactical maneuver to victory over the Arabs during the 1967 war. Barry told aboutthe events and brought in his religious view in an interview that was carried by awire service worldwide. Eventually, the Midnight Globe, October 11, 1977,published the story which was edited to their liking. When it was announced thatBarry was to accompany me in Dayton, the article was sent to me from researcherswith a variety of comments. - When it first became known by the C.I.A. that I (Len Stringfield) had plans tofeature certain data about UFO crashes and retrieval operations, I was advised of therisks and to be careful. In April 1978, for instance, it was suggested that I avoid themention of a retrieval by U. S. military forces of a crashed UFO on Mexican soil. Onone tape, there were witty comments that it would be wise to 'stay out of dark alleys'"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"and 'stay in crowds.' There were no direct threats. - Referring to my talk in Dayton, he advised that I might expect 'agitators there.' Onanother tape I was told that agents (unidentified) would be there in case of trouble. Iconstrued this to mean for my protection. Following the threats on my life on July29, 1978, in Dayton, Ohio, Barry came to my room and called his C.I.A. contact. Hewas told, 'I told you there might be trouble.' - When I heard from a new source of the alleged existence of a human-like cyborgand was put on standby to receive proof of it to be displayed in Dayton, I asked foradvisement. One response, 'I have no information about a cyborg. Maybe it's ahoax.' On another occasion, when my 'cyborg' source asked me to be prepared toreceive from him x-rays as proof at the site of my scheduled lecture for the St. Louisresearch group in Carlyle, Illinois (June 1978), the former C.I.A. informant stated ontape, 'Do not use it unless you have medics nearby. You might end up in the river.'He also said having information like that, if true, 'can cause airplanes to crash.'Indeed, I thought about that during my flight to St. Louis. As a footnote, my contactwith his 'drop' of proof, did not show up. - Informed to be alert for two foreign agents in Dayton. Also, C.I.A. and F.B.I.would be there. My comment, 'I hope so.' - Revealed that a scientist, whom he named, would be present in Dayton and wouldbe prepared for public comment in the event I would disclose data (names, places,etc.) beyond the prepared script in my paper. Later, I heard the comment,'Stringfield did not come across with the hot stuff, so he (the scientist) did not haveto comment.' - In early July, he commented, '80% of your paper is correct ... use only cases withfirsthand witnesses ... discount the others.' Asked about the Kingman, Arizona,retrieval of 1953, he said, 'A lot of it is just story. Don't use it.'[ Stringfield footnote: The Kingman, Arizona UFO crash case of (May 20)1953 was reviewed in Retrievals of the Third Kind based on information fromresearcher Ray Fowler. Although the C.I.A. employee commented that muchof the Kingman report was 'just story,' he did not deny its occurrence. DuringNovember 1979, a new credible source in Las Vegas, Nevada, surfaced torelate new data about the incident, including a firsthand law enforcementwitness. Other new sources, according to my informant, are beinginvestigated. Also see Case A-1 and other 1953 reports in 'Retrievals of theThird Kind' (Status Report I to be reprinted next at Earthfiles.) ] - On July 6, 1978, during the last hectic days before Dayton, I was advised that he(Robert Barry) had been called to an urgent meeting in Washington. Earlier, I hadsubmitted five different drawings of the alien head, based on composite information,and a drawing of the alien hand, for his review and comment. His final comment:'Use head number two. That's close enough.' And regarding the hand, wherein I hadindicated a stub where the thumb would be, he said, 'remove the stub.' (See 5attachments below.) Then he said tersely, 'Please don't contact me anymore. I can'ttalk.' - On August 4, after the MUFON Symposium, word came, 'Everybody did a goodjob.' He further indicated that the plan was a 'test of media and public reaction.'Finally, he gave his version of the cause of alleged threats on my life in Dayton, anissue that has not been clear to this time of writing. Belatedly, he related that theculprits were members or henchmen of a New York movie studio (not Scotia Filmsor Sun Classic) that had in their possession secret documents and film purporting tovalidate the existence of retrieved alien craft and occupants. They feared that mytalk might include some of their material, or more, he said, and that it was necessaryto intimidate me hoping I would shy off. - During the period between April to July 29, he acknowledged and/or confirmedthe Ft. Riley retrieval, the Nellis AFB confrontation, and a retrieval report nearJohannesburg, South Africa. Of the latter, he provided the year of the incident as1953. He did not, however, confirm my reference in my first paper of aconfrontation near Lumberton, Ohio. He also had a 'No Comment' for the 1973retrieval in Case A-2."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"- When I first talked with Barry about the 1962 retrieval incident in New Mexico,he indicated that his C.I.A. informant had been one of the first officials at the crashsite and also had been first to go inside the craft to recover the two alien bodies. InAugust 1979, when I talked with Barry and heard the replay of the tape, theinformation was corrected. Said the former C.I.A. informant, clarifying the issue ofhis participation, he was the first person to look inside through the hatch of the craft,but was NOT inside the craft. This attempt to be factual again pointed out to me thatour tripartite exchange of information was not only of sound footing, but perhapsone means by which some of the hidden data could be safely released to test publicreaction, or for other ulterior purposes. COMMENT: In anticipation of any contrary opinion, I believe Barry's former C.I.A. source islegitimate. I repeat, I have been in touch with Barry for too long a period to argueover his research objectives or to fault his religious views, or to be concerned aboutthe methods he employs in pursuing a UFO case. Barry and I have speculated on allissues of the UFO problem and also about certain aspects of his C.I.A. informant'sanswers to our questions. I find that most information received from his primesource does tally with information I have from other diverse sources. Concerning the controversial C.I.A. letter, researcher Richard Hall has informed methat he knows the identity of the person who perpetrated the prank. While this fakeletter will be forgotten in the annals of the UFO, the 1962 crash report will bestrengthened, however, by new data perhaps related by Barry in the future.\" FIVE ATTACHMENTS: Attachment 1. Drawing of humanoid based on information received from doctor who performedautopsy. Data, concerning relative size of head, torso and limbs and other details,were gathered over a period of several months in 1979, during which time fourseparate drawings were submitted for comment. On my first drawing, he drew aheavy ridge of brow over the eyes and indicated less length of neck and lessdrooping shoulders. After third drawing, he commented: 'Check a 5-month fetus toget proportionate size of head and body.' For the final rendition above, he said, 'Theproportions are right.' October 29, 1979 Attachment 2. Composite drawing of Humanoid Head from reports by firsthand witnesses. Thisillustration was one of five submitted to former C.I.A. employee for review andcomment.
