Here begins Part 3of Status Report IV, written for the June 28-30, 1985, MUFON 1985 UFO SymposiumProceedings in conjunction with the national MUFON conference held in Saint Louis,Missouri. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H.Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report V begins at Earthfiles 012805.Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994.Leonard H. Stringfield: \"3. The Retrieval Operation. It was maximum security, said Morse, who alone in his patrol car received word by radiothat a state of alert was in effect at McGuire AFB as a result of the shooting incident. Hewas ordered to Gate # 5 to answer the request of a state police officer who had been'running code' with the MP during his encounter at Ft. Dix and wanted admission to theairbase. Morse was ordered to 'comply,' but when the trooper wanted to get closer to therunway he was not allowed to do so, and he was angry. On orders by radio, Morse wastold that all personnel - including other members of his security police unit and Morse -were restricted from entry into the roped-off zone. [After the shooting of the non-humanentity], taking command was a new and unfamiliar team of Blue Berets that suddenlydescended onto the scene, just moments after the runway had been cordoned off. Withspeed and efficiency, 'they took over,' he said, 'and when asked who they were, we weretold nothing and ordered to stay outside the ropes.' Perplexed by this covert action, Morsenoted that all of them were staff sergeants and up, wearing fatigues without patches orinsignia. And for headgear, he said, 'they wore blue berets just like mine.'"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" In one letter, Morse vaguely speculated they were 'undercover cops' and by phone he saidhe felt certain 'they' were stationed somewhere at McGuire to account for their quickdeployment to the runway. In support of this, when asked if helicopters were seen or heardoverhead or landed on or near the scene, his reply was negative. This, it seems, would ruleout any notion that they had been transferred from an outside base. It also strengthened hisbelief and mine that a UFO had not crashed or been disabled nearby requiring closetactical air support. But what of a landed craft, perhaps one that touch-landed earlier at Ft.Dix? Could it have deployed one or more of its kind to perform a duty, forever unknown,at one or both of the adjoining military installations? The book, Clear Intent © 1984 byLawrence Fawcett and Barry Greenwood published by Prentice-Hall, relates many reportsof UFO surveillance over airbases in 1975-1976 and I know of many more hidden underthe lid of secrecy. At McGuire, once the sensitive area had been roped off and ECP (Entry Control Point)was established, a generator unit was brought in for better lighting. At least a dozen men,said Morse, armed with M-16s were assigned to guard at the ropes and no one was allowedto enter except the base commander, the security police squadron commander, 1st Lt. WSof the security police squadron, and a base photographer. While on patrol, Morse watched the Blue Beret specialists spray the corpse from aportable tank and cover it with a white sheet. Before daybreak, the body was carefullyplaced onto a platform and a wooden frame built around it. This was finally placed into alarge square silver metal container about 10 x 10 feet with undistinguishable bluemarkings. Before going off duty, Morse and others watched the silver box forklifted into a C-141which arrived about 7 a.m. from Wright-Patterson AFB (identified by special markings)and later at a distance, he said he watched the plane and its secret cargo soar aloft intolimbo, presumed destination was Dayton, Ohio. For Sgt. Morse and others of the Blue Beret regulars at McGuire AFB, it was far from overwhen the C-141 with corpse took off. Two days later he and three others he named werealso on a C-141 on orders to report to Wright-Patterson, the base of many sancta. Thesetting at Wright-Patterson was like that of a court martial. There were a table and chairsin an unadorned room which Morse described as follows: 'While there, we were alltogether except for actual interrogations. Mine had two men, one apparently a civilian withpipe and beard who never spoke. At one point, there were three men. One played nice guyand one mean guy, plus the silent civilian. All they wanted to know was the nature of theincident, what I knew and then told me about my duty to keep my mouth shut. ...I signed aform and it is supposed to bind me for life.' Never once, as Morse recalls, did any of the interrogators offer information or anexplanation of the incident. Nor did anyone ever refer to the retrieved dead body orsuggest that it might have been of extraterrestrial origin. Said Morse: 'They beat around thebush. All references to it were indirect.' The day after the interrogation, Morse returned toMcGuire AFB, was debriefed by his Commanding Officer, Lt. Col. FM, and released fornormal duty. The incident, he said, was not discussed again by anyone as though it neverhappened. The names of the officers at Wright-Patterson, including a Brigadier General who Morsehad confirmed by a source still in the military, have been known to me since our firsttelephone chat. Although I agreed not to publish these names in respect to security, I didinsist they be authenticated by someone other than myself in order to give credence to thecase. With permission, I gave the names to Richard Hall, who had access to such recordsat the Library of Congress. For the most part, his time and effort were not in vain. Although the U. S. Air ForceRegister for 1978 was 'off the shelf,' he said he was able to find in the 1979 edition a statusentry for each officer - except one: a Colonel B who Morse had said played the 'bad guy.'Hall speculated that Colonel B might have been with the CIA, but according to Morse, allthe officers including the questionable Colonel were in civilian clothes. Each wasidentified with a name plate showing his rank in parentheses. Whatever the Colonel's role,we are left to conclude that the silent, bearded man with a pipe who - according to Morsewas without a name plate - might have been with the CIA or another covert agency. Tostem any suspicion, I had Morse check a picture of Dr. J. Allen Hynek, well-known forpipe and beard. His comment: 'Some similarities, but my man was about 50 and his beardwas flat, not a goatee. Don't think it was Hynek.' (Note 6: On my suggestion, Morseobtained a copy of the Feb. 1985 issue of OMNI magazine which featured an article aboutDr. Hynek with current pictures. Oddly, a letter sent to Morse on January 12, 1985, withvarious enclosures - including pictures of Dr. Hynek vintage 1978 for his comments - wasnever received.)"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" For the record, the officers at McGuire were also checked out and confirmed, butunfortunately as Hall explained, the assignments for the time and place of the Wright-Patterson officers were not obtainable in the U. S. Air Force Register nor in any otherimmediately available record. Also, it was disappointing that there was no direct way tocheck on the enlisted men named in the Incident/Complaint Report without having theidentification of a social security or military serial number. 4. Surveillance? Morse believes that his problem of living under the burden of surveillance began with hisfirst letter to me from overseas. If we can assume for a moment that Morse's story is true,then we can also assume that such UFO-related military incidents are safeguarded by anymeans necessary to maintain optimum secrecy. Thus, Morse was a risk and had his mailmonitored. Needless to say, at this point when his breach of security was discovered, hismail and perhaps mine in 1980 suffered interference which led to his having visitors withwarnings. An example of bugging Morse psychologically and/or electronically occurred January 12,1984, when I called him and got only 'yes' and 'no' to my questions. In his letter written thesame day to explain his evasiveness, he said: Morse Letter January 12, 1984: 'Sorry for waiting so long on reply to your letter....There was a Government car on the street the day I got it. I don't think it's related,but I don't want to take any chances. ...I don't know if it (surveillance) is relaxedanymore or if it ever was. ...I must also mention that we had much trouble with ourphone in the past two weeks and several different repairmen have corrected thesame problems each time. That is why I hesitated to speak to you today on thephone.' Leonard Stringfield: It is no wonder that Morse might have had some second thoughtsabout reaching me until 1983. But, his affairs were not to get better. In early 1984, I had expressed my desire again to visit Morse, but this overture fell shortwhen he announced in March that he planned a visit to the West Coast. While there, hesaid he hoped to see someone who might provide the back-up information I needed. Sevenmonths passed, again in silence. Finally on October 4, 1984, he answered my letter of September 4, and said briefly that hehad a new problem. This time it was related to his application for a position in lawenforcement with a Government service. Commented Morse, in part: '...the Government isgiving me a hard time. ...First, they would not let me have the job. I took them to FederalAppeals Court and they were ordered to hire me. They're appealing the decision. I guesswe know why this is happening. ...' Later by phone in December 1984, I was to learn that Morse had received a call from anattorney in the Justice Department (name on file), who stated during their discussion onMorse's employment: 'Your acquaintance with Mr. Stringfield did not help!' Then, by a December 31, 1984 letter, Morse wrote: Morse Letter December 31, 1984: 'I was approached by a person wearing a blacksuit in my parking lot who mentioned things might go my way if I deny this incident(McGuire alien shooting). I just received notice by registered mail that theDepartment of Justice has decided to make me eligible for hire. I feel these twothings are related.' 5. Analogy: The Ellsworth Case. In a James Bond movie, we all can recognize James Bond. But in UFO research we cannotalways identify the real Bond from a bogus Bond. For certain, however, intrigue is highlyvisible in Bond of fiction and in some areas of UFO research, especially in the sensitivearea of crash/retrievals. While Morse's disclosures might seem fictitious, there is oneparallel case of violence that probably is just that - fictitious - and it deserves a hearing inthis report. This one is known as the Ellsworth Case because the missile site where itallegedly occurred is under the command of Ellsworth AFB near Rapid City, SouthDakota. The story begins with an unsigned note directed to the National Enquirer on January 29,1978. It reads, in part, as follows: 'The incident stated in the attached report actuallyoccurred. The U. S. Air Force appointed a special team to investigate the incident. I wasone of those individuals. I am still on active duty and so I cannot state my name at this"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"time. ...the incident occurred on 16 November 1977 ... was classified Top Secret 2December 1977. At that time, I obtained a copy of the original report. ...\" At the National Enquirer, reporter and Ufologist Robert Pratt and a team of fellowreporters first thought the letter was a hoax. However, when they made a number of callsto Ellsworth and Rapid City to find that the men named in the report existed, they decidedto fly to the site for a firsthand investigation. The case quickly collapsed. By the time theyfinished their interviews with all concerned in the report - with the help of Ellsworth'sInformation Officer - and checked on each person's story, they were convinced that theincident was a hoax. Never published in the Enquirer, the story was scrapped until it wasrevived by some UFO enthusiasts circulating rumors that it was true and cleverly coveredup. To put it to rest, when Pratt was editor of the MUFON UFO Journal, he published his'Anatomy of a Hoax' in the January 1984 issue. The Ellsworth case, although its Incident/Complaint Report predates the Ft. Dix-McGuireencounter, differs appreciably in that its source was so slipshod in handling of easilycheckable facts about the personnel. Says Pratt in his expose, 'We found more than 20discrepancies or errors in the report - wrong names, numbers, occupations, physicallayouts and so on. ...It would be easy to say the Air Force falsified numerous documents,muzzled everyone on the base, published a phony high school yearbook. But that is highlyunlikely. We spent a total of 44 man-days investigating this at a cost of more than $15,000.We had no doubt that the incident in the so-called report never occurred.' Morse, who has survived all of his ordeals since his story was published in Status ReportIII, remains openly agreeable to the investigation of his case. Cooperatively, he did notquestion my challenge to have the officers names at Wright-Patterson or the personnel atMcGuire checked out. He welcomed the chance to meet and be interviewed on all issuedby one of my more critical colleagues, Richard Hall. For the record, Morse was made fully aware of the Ellsworth case with a xeroxed copysent to him for appraisal. He replied that the terminology used was pretty accurate, noting:'The form you see is probably a back office copy. It could have been rewritten.' In a latercomment he said, 'Without firsthand information, the case doesn't mean much.' In short,what Morse was saying was, 'Where's the source?' 6. Jeffrey Morse: The Person. In the Ellsworth case, the informant who never surfaced was remiss with facts in hisIncident/Complaint Report. In the Ft. Dix-McGuire case, however, its bedrock of strengthis not wholly reliant on the report, which was obtained for him by another source in hissquadron. It is Jeffrey Morse himself. It is the Morse who once wrote to me: 'The publicshould know the truth.' Through many letters and mostly by phone, I got to know Morse as amiable, bright andalert and inclined toward reticence, never resorting to glib, idle chatter. When questionedon critical or touch issues, he was trigger-quick to respond in convincing detail. But in themain, he always spoke guardedly, revealing little personal emotion over his dramaticexperiences. Sometimes I felt that behind this stoic reserve and his admission that he didnot have answers to many of my questions, he might have known more than he wassaying. Above all, however, Morse never once contradicted himself with the informationhe chose to offer. From experience, I knew all along that my one-to-one contact with my key source whowould remain anonymous to research was not sufficient. I also knew for good reasons thatmy time to get a second witness with an objective appraisal was running out. Foremost inmind was the 'deal' proposed to Morse by a stranger in a parking lot which, if affected,could possibly stall or even prevent any further contact. Also, having selected Case A-3 asmy topic for the MUFON symposium in St. Louis, I had no time to spare. My deadline forfinal copy was March 1st. Phone calls brought quick results. Morse and Hall met January13, 1985, at a mall near Washington, D. C. Hall - with finesse in the role of playing 'devil'sadvocate,' agreed that the character of Morse was of greater importance than rehashing thedetails of the incident. In this manner, Hall watched and listened. Following are commentsfrom his letter dated January 13, 1985: Richard Hall Letter of January 13, 1985: 'I did not pursue any hard line ofquestioning, mainly wanting to gain his confidence and form some impression of hiscredibility. I broke the ice by showing him the typed list of name checks which wediscussed for awhile and he spoke easily after that. ...Personally, A-3 waswell-groomed, friendly, relaxed, calm, articulate. He spoke confidently and withouthesitation in answer to questions and did not come across at all as someone who hasconcocted a tall tale and might contradict himself or get caught in some sort of trapif he weren't careful. He showed no mannerisms that would betray any obvious"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"psychoses or 'hang-up.' Other than a healthy dose of disdain for authorities for whichhe apparently had good reason, he did not have any obvious axe to grind. 'He explained his personal situation and repeated to me what he told you in case hesuddenly denied the story. ...He professes not to be interested in UFOs and that heput the experience behind him without any lingering trauma. ...Overall, I detectednothing in his manner or story to cause skepticism. To the contrary, he seemed verycredible to me. He also spoke easily about his family and relatives toward the end ofour interview, and was not at all 'full' of the story and wanting only to talk about it -no obsession. Pending further investigation, I would tend to give him very highmarks. I kept a mental picture of other possible explanations, but they did not fit hisimage, style or demeanor.' SUMMARY COMMENTS Leonard Stringfield: In bringing my report to a close, I recognize the need for moreinformation about the shooting episode at Ft. Dix and the nature of the body retrievedfrom McGuire. But for the moment, the testimony of the one and only available witnessmust carry the so-called burden of proof. Hall's informative meeting and my manyexchanges by letter and phone certainly establish a strong base for Morse's integrity. In closing, I must note that in character with his downplaying of events, Morse never oncestated to me that the entity he saw, despite its alien anatomy, was of extraterrestrial originor that it might have come from one of the UFOs he saw overhead on that fatal night ofJanuary 18, 1978. At this point, with so much at stake on the testimony of one witness, we must go beyondthe anecdote and the support data and take a closer look at the witness himself. What kindof person is Jeffrey Morse? Born September 10, 1958, he was 20 years old at the time ofthe incident. After high school he attended various universities taking prep courses, finallymajoring in computer science. A Catholic by faith, he attends church regularly and inkeeping with his interest in law enforcement, he is a member of the Fraternal Order ofPolice. Among his hobbies and for recreation, he is into video taping, foreign languages,plays softball, touch football and is a coach in youth sporting activities. Morse is not a UFO buff. He is not aware of most UFO events or nationally knownresearchers and authors. To this end, I submitted fifteen names to him for his comment, buthe could not identify any one of them. When I mentioned this detail to one of my moreperceptive contemporaries, he remarked, 'You should expect this kind of pretendedignorance from a plant setting you up with false information.' A point indeed, but it's a weak point. I know of no good reason for an undercover agent tocontinue to play games long after his story was published in my 19892 Status Report.Certainly if it were contrived to expose my gullibility and thus, discredit my work, whyhave the conspirators not unleash their stooges to flaunt their spoils of triumph by now?Moreover, Morse knows that I have no intention to present his case in this paper as proof. Status Report IV is purely an analysis of events encompassing one case worthy of seriousreview. I believe the data I present here offer substantially more than other encounters orretrievals published in my series of status reports. Significantly inadequate by comparisonis the Nellis AFB affair in 1968 in Case A-5 Status Report II (to be reprinted in upcomingEarthfiles), and the Lumberton (or Wilmington), Ohio, skirmish in Case B-13 of the samepaper and updated on Page 44 of Status Report III. The only commonality it seems is thatthey all carry a burden of proof as do all cases in UFO lore! Since 1982, new sources have emerged and vanished on the horizon of my research, noneworthy of a monograph. I think Jeffrey Morse's case is special and, if we like to ramble inour thoughts seeking answers, or feel inclined to speculate into the shadowy realms ofintrigue, perhaps there is another side to secrecy - the side that occasionally leaks the truthfor the simple reason that it is long overdue.\" USAF and U.S. Army Repliesto Leonard Stringfield's FOIA Requests "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Beginning soon - Status Report III - UFO Crash/Retrievals: Amassing the EvidenceCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
