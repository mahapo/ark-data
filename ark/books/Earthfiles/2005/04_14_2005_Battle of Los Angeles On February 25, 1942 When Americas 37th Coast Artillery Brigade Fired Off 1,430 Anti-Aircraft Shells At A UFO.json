April 14, 2005 Los Angeles, California - Sixty three years ago on February 24-25, 1942,all of southern California from the San Juaquin Valley to the Mexico border were blacked"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"out. Fearing a WWII Japanese invasion attack, air raid sirens had gone on and off theevening of February 24, as intermittent unidentified aerial lights were reported. Then at2:25 a.m. on February 25, most of the greater Los Angeles region's three millionpopulation was awakened by loud air raid sirens that kept wailing for the next thirty-eightminutes. Powerful searchlights were aimed at a glowing unidentified aerial object over theSanta Monica Mountains that was shaped like a \"lozenge.\" Moments later, America's 37thCoast Artillery Brigade fired off 1,430 anti-aircraft shells at the UFO.An eyewitness, who was 8-years-old that night, is C. Scott Littleton. As Professor ofAnthropology Emeritus at Occidental College, in 2003 he wrote about what he recalled:Prof. Scott Littleton: \"I was an eyewitness to the events of that unforgettableFebruary morning in February 25 of 1942. I was eight-years-old at the time, and myparents lived at 2500 Strand in Hermosa Beach, right on the beach. We thus had agrandstand seat. While my father went about his air-raid warden duties, my latemother and I watched the glowing object, which was caught in the glare ofsearchlights from both Palos Verdes and Malibu/Pacific/Palisades and surrounded bythe puffs of ineffectual anti-aircraft fire, as it slowly flew across the ocean fromnorthwest to southeast. It headed inland over Redondo Beach a couple of miles tothe south of our vantage point, and eventually disappeared over the eastern end ofthe Palos Verdes Hills, what's today called Rancho Palos Verdes. The whole incidentlasted, at least from our perspective, about half an hour, although we didn't time it.Like other kids in the neighborhood, I spent the next morning picking up pieces ofshrapnel on the beach. Indeed, it's a wonder more people weren't injured by thestuff, as we were far from the only folks standing outside watching the action.[Editor's Note: Six people died during the event from injury and heart attacks.] \"In any case, I don't recall seeing any truly discernible configuration - just a small,glowing, slight lozenge-shaped blob of light - a single blob. We only saw one object,not several as some witnesses later reported. At the time, we were convinced that itwas a 'Jap' reconnaissance plane, and that L. A. might be due for a major air-raid inthe near future. Remember, this was less than three months after Pearl Harbor. \"...And yes, I'm pretty sure it was a UFO. However, what might at first glance betaken for a 'bubble' similar to those often reported atop disk-shaped UFOs is, Istrongly suspect, simply an anti-aircraft burst that occurred a second or so before thepicture was snapped. Also, as I think about it, the searchlight beams we saw simplyconverged on the object and did not extend beyond it, although after sixty-oneyears, I can't be certain. And the fuzzy lozenge shape I remember seeing does jibewith the much closer image in the photograph. By the way, did he (Calvert) use atelescopic lens? I strongly suspect he did, as they were available in the early 1940s,though not for Speed Graphics, which would mean that he used his private camera,perhaps a Leica. In this connection, I'm willing to be that at least one other personhad the presence of mind to photograph the object during t hour r so t was visiblefrom Santa Monica to Orange County. Indeed, one or more pictures of it might stillbe lurking in local family albums. Maybe we should put out a call on the internetasking for folks in Southern California to search their family albums and snapshotcollections from that era.\" To be continued in Part 2 with photo analysis by Navy Physicist, Bruce Maccabee.More Information:See other Earthfiles reports about unidentified aerial craft:· 04/13/2005 -- Highly Strange Dog Death in Arkansas· 04/05/2005 -- Part 8: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - © June 1982 byLeonard H.
