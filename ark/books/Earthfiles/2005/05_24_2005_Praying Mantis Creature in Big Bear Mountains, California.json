She had grown up in Omaha,Nebraska, where she was born thirty-five years ago in 1970. She graduated from highschool with an interest in art and studied for one and a half years in a community college.By April 1996, her marriage was deteriorating toward divorce and her health was bad. Forrelief, Amy decided to go camping with a friend in the Big Bear Mountains near Big BearLake east of San Bernardino. The first morning around 8 a.m., she stepped out of the tentand was overwhelmed by the beauty of the trees, mountains and sunlight. So, she got her35mm camera, loaded it with a 24-frame roll of 400 ASA Kodak film, and clicked off fiveshots as she randomly aimed the lens at what appealed to her. During the camp outing, shefinished off the roll, had the prints developed and put them in a box. Amy and her husbanddivorced and she moved back to Omaha to be close to her family parents.In 2004, she heard a Coast to Coast AM radio program in which I was interviewing peopleabout photographs that had translucent or opaque small orbs in them, even though thephotographers had not seen any orbs with their eyes. Amy decided to look through the boxof photographs she had been accumulating over the years to see if there were any orbs. Toher surprise, she found several orbs in her old photographs - and something else in one ofthe 1996 photographs from the Big Bear Mountain camping trip that scared her .Interview:Amy Brockman, Medical Insurance Claims Specialist, Omaha, Nebraska: \"I don'tknow if it was because my mind was opening up to things, that I was being more intent inlooking at the pictures very carefully in the box, but I just ran across this very strangefigure that was by the tree. I remembered being out in that camping area and I don'tremember seeing anything like this. And it scared me at first. So I started looking a little bitcloser and the next day, I took them into (Kinko's) and blew up the pictures. The rest ishistory because I did not know what it was.HOW MANY PHOTOS DID YOU PRINT FROM THAT ROLL?I'm going to say a 24 frame roll and I took 6 pictures that morning, no 5. It's funny becauseI was just kind of aiming the camera around and I ended up taking two pictures of thesame spot. One picture where the dead tree trunk is just sitting there by the pine tree andthere is absolutely nothing standing by it. The next picture I took, the white figure isstanding there.BUT YOU DID NOT SEE IT AT THE TIME YOU WERE PHOTOGRAPHING?No, that's why I'm so shocked. I'm an artist. I pay attention to things, to details. I don'tknow why I did not see that."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Above: April 1996 photograph taken at Big Bear Mountain camp ground around 8 a.m. by Amy Brockmanupon waking up and stepping outside tent.

It was just absolutely stunning to me because I had never spent any time insuch a beautiful place.SO YOU WERE NOT AWARE OF ANYTHING ANOMALOUS AROUND YOU?Not at all.HOW DID YOU DISCOVER THIS VERY ODD PRAYING MANTIS-LIKE CREATUREIN THE PHOTOGRAPH?I noticed it in 2004. I was listening to Coast to Coast AM and I was hearing people talkingabout orbs that were in their pictures. So I got interested and I sat down with all my oldphotographs and I started looking through them. I saw lots of orbs and that made me evenmore interested and kept looking and ran across these pictures from our camping trip. Ihad not seen them in years (9 years). They were in a box tucked away.YOU ARE 35 YEARS OLD NOW. DO YOU HAVE ANY MEMORIES AS A CHILD OFHEARING BUZZING NOISES, OR CLICKING NOISES, OR LIGHTS IN THE ROOM,OR ANYTHING THAT WOULD FALL INTO THE POSSIBLE CATEGORY OFSOMETHING NON-HUMAN INTERACTING WITH YOU?No, not when I was really young. I've had several things happen when I was in my collegeyears, my early twenties. I would not say I've heard clicking or anything like that. I've justhad strange things happen around me. I don't know if they would relate.ANYTHING IN WHICH YOU HAVE HAD A VIVID DREAM IN WHICH SOMETHINGLIKE A PRAYING MANTIS HAS APPEARED?No, and I lucid dream, so I would remember that. I have very vivid dreams.WHEN YOU FINALLY GOT THESE PHOTOS OUT AGAIN LOOKING FOR THEORBS AND YOU WERE LOOKING AT THIS IMAGE FOR THE FIRST TIME,REALIZING THAT YOU WERE SEEING SOMETHING YOU HAD NOT SEEN IN THEPHOTO BEFORE, WHAT WAS YOUR IMMEDIATE REACTION TO SEEING THEWHITE FIGURE?Fear.WHEN YOU THINK OF A PRAYING MANTIS, WHAT COMES INTO YOUR MINDIMMEDIATELY?I'm scare of that because I am scared (to realize) I was out in the middle of nowhere andthee was something there and I did not sense it. Now that I look at the pictures, it makesme feel it's really scary! Usually I'm more intuitive with my environment, like peoplearound me, I can feel. I can feel if you are angry or if there are bad vibes around, I canusually pick up on that. So, I didn't pick up on that out there.. But when I looked at thepicture, I felt horrified, I felt scared, fear, definite fear because it's unusual. It's strange. It'snot something you expect to see in a picture! It's even strange to talk about it these manyyears later, but it's something that is haunting me and I want to know what it is.ONE OF THE THINGS THAT INTRIGUES ME ABOUT THIS PHOTO IS THAT THE"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"PRAYING MANTIS CREATURE IS SO WHITE, SO DRENCHED OF ANY COLOR, INTHE ENVIRONMENT WHICH OTHERWISE HAS A LOT OF GREEN AND COLORIN IT.Yeah, and I think that the head on this particular creature is outstanding. You can tell sowell that it's got that prominent chin on it. It looks so much to me like a praying mantishead.I looked at the long arm and thought, 'My goodness!' For awhile, I took this picture in andtalked about it with some people at a metaphysical book store here in town and asked,'What do you think this is?' And an older lady in there said, 'That looks like an angelbecause it looks like it has archangel wings behind it, kind of just perched up on its back.'ANOTHER INTERESTING THING ABOUT THE PRAYING MANTIS CREATURES ISTHAT PEOPLE HAVE ENCOUNTERED THEM OUTSIDE, LIKE NEAR A BARN,AND DESCRIPTIONS AND DRAWINGS ARE OF A GLOWING LIGHT AROUNDTHE HEAD OR UPPER PART OF THE BODY.That might explain the bright white face and 'wings.'\"Praying mantis-creature encountered by David Huggins at Georgia farmwhen he was eight in 1950. He associated entity with small, grey beings which Davidthought were androids programmed to do work for the praying mantis and tall humanoids.Drawing © by David Huggins, included in Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I:Facts & Eyewitnesses © 1994 by Linda Moulton Howe.
