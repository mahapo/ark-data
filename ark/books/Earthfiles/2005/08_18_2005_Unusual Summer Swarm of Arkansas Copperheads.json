There was a swarm of atleast sixty copperheads in the back yard of Yellville, Arkansas, resident, Chuck Miller.After five years of living on his forested ridge property, Mr. Miller knew it was too earlyand he'd never seen so many snakes together before. Copperheads don't usually move intogroups, or \"aggregates,\" until late September to October for hibernation. Chuck Miller knew people wouldn't believe what was happening unless he caught some ofthe snakes as proof. So he went out at dusk and stood in one place to catch some. Thecopperheads were moving through his yard in and around several sites on his property, butespecially around a cedar tree where Mr. Miller caught sixty. Prof. Trauth sent one of hisstudents to see who reported back, \"Sure enough, lots of copperheads!\" Chuck Miller, 35, of rural Marion County captures a copperhead the night of August 17, 2005,next to a cedar tree on his property. Miller and Prof. Stan Trauth, have documented nearly 100 copperheadsso far in Miller's back yard, but no one knows why the snakes began gathering in such large numbersin mid-July instead of late September to October before normal denning.Photograph © 2005 by The Baxter Bulletin.Interview:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Stan Trauth, Ph.D., Prof. of Zoology and Director of the Electron MicroscopeFacility, Arkansas State University, Dept. of Biological Sciences, Jonesboro,Arkansas: \"The copperheads are moving a lot earlier than normal. Their normalmovements for hibernation dens occur usually in the middle to late fall, usually byOctober. But this year, this Yellville congregation of copperheads began in mid-July, threemonths earlier than expected. In the photograph above, the copperhead is near the base ofthe cedar tree (on cedar needles) when I went to investigate. I couldn't photographdirectly at the base of the tree without great disturbance to the setting. But in thephotograph below, these were some of the copperheads gathered by Chuck Miller andcontained in a box at my ASU laboratory.Some of the sixty snakes that Chuck Miller collected in his back yard which w ere studiedby Prof. Stan Trauth at Arkansas State University and released back into the wild.Photograph © 2005 by Stan Trauth, Ph.D. No Adult Female Copperheads in SwarmWe've sort of ruled out the feeding or breeding aggregation because the animals we havegotten so far, which I have processed and we have returned many of them back to thewild, are mostly adult males and juvenile males and only juvenile females. No adultfemales are present.The adult females are probably at birthing dens. Females aggregate together at birthingdens which may be a hibernation den also. They are going to be giving birth to live younghere any day now.WHY SHOULD ALL OF THESE MALE ADULTS AND JUVENILE MALES ANDJUVENILE FEMALES BE CONGREGATING IN SUCH NUMBERS IN MR. MILLER'SBACK YARD IN JULY?Well, that's the $64,000 question. You're asking something that we can only speculate on.First of all, the snakes tend to be following each other. That's my take on it. These snakeslay down scent trails with their cloaca glands. The secretions from those glands allow forthe snakes to follow one another. This is normal with snakes. They flick their tongue andare sensing the environment all the time. So, they can pick up the secretions of the otherindividuals within their own species and other species at the same time. I'm guessing thatthey are following these trails. Unusual Sniffing BehaviorDO YOU HAVE ANY SPECULATION ABOUT WHAT THE COPPERHEADS COULDBE PICKING UP IN THE ENVIRONMENT?This is something that my students have observed at the Chuck Miller site. The snakestend, as they move toward the cedar tree, they have been exhibiting unusual behaviorwhich has not been described before in copperheads. They raise their heads and it lookslike they are sniffing the air. Then they go down to the surface of the ground and rub thesides of their heads against the soil and then move up into the air again, like they are tryingto sense something. They do this around the cedar tree. Afterward, they move off inalmost a direct line up to the top of the ridge.This has not been described (in the literature) before as far as I know, and we would like toget this on videotape to see if we can analyze that type of behavior.Every once in awhile we have a large outbreak of cicadas that might attract snakes. Butthis year, we do not have a cicada outbreak, but perhaps the snakes are following historic"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"trails through the woods anyway to look for food.WHAT IF IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH A BIG WEATHER CHANGE COMING?Maybe more advanced, large vertebrates can detect that kind of thing, but I don't believewe can assign that to snakes now. We don't have that kind of information about theirabilities, their instincts to detect climatic changes or anything like that. So I would be veryhesitant to go that way.WHAT ABOUT THE BIG EARTHQUAKE FAULT THAT YOU SIT ON IN THAT AREA(NEW MADRID)? HAVE SNAKES EVER BEEN SEEN IN THE PAST TO MOVE INANTICIPATION OF LARGE EARTHQUAKES?Somebody asked me that via an email from Tennessee today. Of course, I told them thatthis aggregate we've seen is only about 150 miles from the New Madrid fault. We have notobserved any type of unusual lower vertebrate or reptilian behavior associated withearthquakes. That has not been observed.IS THERE ANYTHING THAT SNAKES ARE LINKED TO IN TERMS OFANTICIPATION OF SOMETHING ABOUT TO OCCUR IN THE ENVIRONMENT?Not that I know of. We know that snakes will aggregate around large numbers of prey inassociation with feeding and that they do have mating aggregates which are normally inlate fall. We have no evidence that snakes can detect any weather related or globalgeological type events at this time. It would be interesting to see that if it occurred andthen begin to study something like that. Any Link to Global Warming Changes?COULD IT POSSIBLY RELATE TO GLOBAL WARMING? SINCE IT'S THREEMONTHS EARLIER THAN NORMAL, IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE COPPERHEADSARE SENSING SOMETHING COMING SUCH AS BAD WEATHER? OR WHOKNOWS WHAT? AND THEY ARE TRYING TO GET INTO DENS EARLIER THANNORMAL?Since this article came out and this information went nationwide, I've gotten calls fromother parts of the country talking about maybe not quite the number, but similar types ofaggregations and movements in the summertime. So, I've had several reports, but nothinglike the numbers we've seen at this Arkansas site. To attach that to global warming or tosay something about why the snakes are doing what they are doing right now would be justpure speculation.IF THE SNAKES WERE SENSING SOMETHING IN A BIG GLOBAL WARMINGCHANGE THAT WAS UNPRECEDENTED TO US HUMANS AND WE DIDN'T KNOWANYTHING ABOUT IT, THE SNAKES GENETICALLY MIGHT BE PICKING UP ONSOMETHING?That is possible because we know these animals have been around a long time and we'vegone through these types of perturbations in the climate in the past, various ice ages andwarmings we've had. There could be something to it.BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE AS A ZOOLOGIST, DO SNAKES PICK UP ONUPCOMING WEATHER TRENDS?Not that I know of. We do know that these particular types of snakes are diurnal (day)during the springtime. They are active during the day. But as the summer months enter andthe weather gets much warmer, they become nocturnal. They move about possibly goingafter prey during the night time. By late summer, females give birth. The rest of theanimals begin to move toward their historic denning sites. That's what they do.Now, why Mr. Miller has so many on his property, we can only speculate. There is nothingspecial about the property except that it is on top of a ridge. These snakes are known toseek hibernation dens that typically face south and west at the tops of ridges, rocky ridgesmost of the time. But we don't really know why this particular site is drawing the snakes in.MR. MILLER SAID THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN COPPERHEADS GATHER IN THISNUMBER AND NOT THIS EARLY IN THE TIME HE'S BEEN ON THE PROPERTY.Ye s , h e s a id t h a t .HAVE YOU IN YOUR EXPERIENCE EVER KNOWN THIS NUMBER OFCOPPERHEAD SNAKES TO GATHER IN JULY?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Not this number, no. Not for a terrestrial snake and certainly not for a pit viper. We knowthat copperheads do move about in late summer. But I don't think anyone has ever stayedin one area and followed snakes crossing at a particular site, at least not in the easterndeciduous forests. So, no one has come forth with any solid information regarding what isgoing on. Other Unusual Snake Movements in U. S.?WHAT ABOUT OTHER PLACES IN THE UNITED STATES WHERE THERE HASBEEN AN INCREASE OF SNAKES MOVING INTO A DEN MODE? WHERE HASTHAT OCCURRED AND WHAT HAVE PEOPLE SAID THERE?Yes, I received an e-mail and article regarding a place in Pennsylvania where somebodyhad seen a large number of snakes which I think were copperheads. They were movingand somebody was bitten and there was the concern about the movement of the numbersof snakes they had seen. I think by this information getting out that if there are otherobservations by others, they will let me know. I will probably open this up toherpetologists. I'm not certain it's a generally peculiar phenomenon yet, but it's definitelypeculiar to Chuck Miller's Yellville backyard.BUT YOU'VE BEEN A PROFESSOR OF ZOOLOGY AT ARKANSAS STATEUNIVERSITY FOR 21 YEARS AND YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF THIS BEFORE.That is correct.SO THAT MAKES THIS PRETTY UNUSUAL?Yes, I would say so. Certainly we responded immediately once we found out about thisparticular event taking place. So, it's been a very interesting series of discoveries as we'vecontinued to study this particular site.\"More Information:If you have any information, please contact Prof. Trauth by e-mail or through his website:e-mail: strauth@astate.eduStan Trauth, Ph.D. Website: http://biology.astate.edu/faculty/strauth/Dr_%20Stanley%20Trauth.htmE-Mail to Prof. Trauth: \"From: R M Peterson, Oakland, ArkansasSent: Tuesday, August 16, 2005 12:18 PMTo : STAN TRAUTHSubject: Copperhead phenomenaDr Trauth,Read of your research re: Miller Copperheads, courtesy of<http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/nat-gen/2005/aug/16/081601086.html>- also in LA Times. Same thing with copperheads up here across the Bull Shoals lakein the Oakland Area (still Marion County) approx. 30 mi. line of sight from Miller'slocation. Late July thru early Aug, had to dispose of 8 copperheads near our house(with a large cedar tree, hedges and several flower box areas). Normal encountersince ca. 1980 is a MAX of 3 a year, and some years none at all. With the drought,suspect the creeks have dried up and they are moving uphill to moister digs withcicada, toad and other food sources more abundant. Good luck figuring this one out. They sure kept us busy protecting our pets (andourselves) from serious vet bills this year.\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Republication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
