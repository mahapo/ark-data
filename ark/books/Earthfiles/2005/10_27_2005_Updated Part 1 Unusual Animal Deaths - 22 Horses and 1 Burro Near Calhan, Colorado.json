All the yellow-colored areas are siteswhere I have investigated unusual animal deaths since 1979. October 27, 2005 Calhan, Colorado - Since October 11, 2005, I have received reports ofunusual animal deaths in San Antonio, Texas; Dartmoor, England; and Calhan, Colorado.The San Antonio case is another bloodless half cat. In England, six sheep were found withclassic mutilation excisions without blood or signs of struggle. And in Calhan, Colorado,six horses and a burro were found dead on October 11. Then, eleven days later on October22, sixteen more horses were found dead not far from the first unusual animal deaths. Six of sixteen horses on DeWitt ranch found dead October 22, after six horsesand one burro on Sixkiller ranch found dead on October 11, 2005, all near Calhan, Colorado.Photograph © 2005 by Chuck Bigger/The Denver Post."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"In Colorado, the story began to unfold on the early morning of Tuesday, October 11, whena police officer driving in the ranchlands of Calhan southeast of Denver, saw a dead horsenear a windbreak. There had been a two-day blizzard and the snow was thick, except forthe ground behind the V-shaped windbreak where the horse was down. Law enforcementcontacted the ranch owner, Ned Sixkiller, who got to the scene around 4:30 p.m. that sameday.Behind the windbreak there were five female horses of varying ages and one male. Ahundred yards away, Ned also found one of his burros. The burro and six horses were deadand had unexplained, bloodless puncture holes in their hides. Adding to the highstrangeness, there was one young filly alive without any marks on her, but she seemedtraumatized by whatever had happened.Interview:Ned Sixkiller, rancher since 1982 in Calhan, Colorado region: \"When they autopsiedours, they said it was definitely not a storm-related, blizzard-related death. I had somecattle just south of there two miles and we did not lose any cattle. So, I sure don't think itwas the storm.WHAT DID THE BODIES LOOK LIKE WHEN YOU FIRST FOUND THEM?On our horses, we found some puncture wounds. And the veterinarian and Sheriff's Dept.at first glance, they said they had been shot. Then after they autopsied them and stuff, theycould not find any bullets to go with the puncture wounds. So they don't have anyexplanation for any of it.I'M CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY THE SIZES OF THE PUNCTURE HOLESWERE?A quarter-inch hole about the size of a pencil and the one horse that we thought sure itbasically had a hole right between the eyes.THE HOLE WAS RIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES?Ye s .PENETRATING THROUGH SKULL BONE?No, it didn't go through the skull bone, just to the bone.WHERE WERE THE HOLES ON THE OTHER HORSES?I know the blue mare she had a hole right between her eyes. And there were two others:one in her knee and one in her ribs.The 2-year-old colt had a mark between her eyes. You know, they (vet/sheriff) thought itwas a bullet hole and then they found (otherwise). But she had a mark between her eyes. Idon't know if they thought it was a puncture wound or not. But I did.And then the others was just a variation. Like there was a couple of them in their legs. Thelittle colt no, I don't think we ever did find anything in her. But by the time they got to her,it was muddy and the snow had melted and it was really hard to tell from where she waslaying.THEN THE ALIVE FILLY.As far as I know, there was nothing in her at all.THE BURRO? WHERE WAS THE HOLE IN THE BURRO?It seems to me they found a deal in the burro's neck or head.COULD YOU LIST FOR ME AGAIN THE SEXES AND AGES? IT WAS SIX HORSESAND ONE BURRO, RIGHT?Yeah, the burro I have no idea how old he would be. There was three brood mares rangingfrom probably 4 to 10. And there were two weaning colts which would be about 6 or 7months old now.WHAT WERE THEIR SEXES?One was a stud and one was a filly. And there was a 2-year-old female."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"SO, OF THE SIX HORSES, ONLY ONE WAS MALE.Yeah, there was only one stud colt in there. There was also one filly colt that was alive.She was the same age as the other colts 6 to 7 months old.SHE WAS ALIVE WHEN YOU GOT THERE?Ye p .DID YOU GO UP AND EXAMINE HER?Yeah, we looked her over good and it was getting close to dark and someone calledbecause that colt was alive there. But there wasn't anything we could do after dark. Thecolt wasn't caught. So it wasn't until the next morning that we got around and got hercaught and got everything looked over.That was the deal when they first come out (sheriff and vet). They said they was shot. Andthe reason is it did appear that way. I called to get a sheriff's car and they wouldn't evensend a car out there until it was confirmed that they had been shot. Then the vet looked atthem and he said, 'I'm sure they've been shot.' Then the Sheriff's Dept. shows up and saysthey've been shot. But then when they go to looking at them closer, they couldn't find anybullets. So they kind of ruled that and just called it 'puncture wounds.'WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT LIVE COLT?We have her here in the corral.DOES SHE HAVE A HOLE IN HER STILL?She never had a hole in her.WHY WAS THAT FILLY UNTOUCHED, I WONDER?No one has any idea about that either. Could Sixkiller's 6 Horses and 1 BurroHave Been Dropped from the Air Onto Snow?DID IT LOOK AS IF THEY HAD BEEN DROPPED FROM THE AIR?Well, I don't think so. It didn't look like that to me. It was just like they laid down. In thisdeal, the strange part is the way it looks to me that when these horses ended up dead, itwas right in the middle of a freak severe blizzard where nobody was going anywhere, youknow?YEAH. AND IF THERE WAS A BLIZZARD, WERE THEY LAYING ON TOP OF THESNOW? OR WERE THEY COVERED WITH SNOW?They had some snow blew up on part of them, but they was pretty much laying on top ofthe snow. And those V-windbreaks split the snow, so those horses were basically laying onthe ground, you know?THOSE V-WINDBREAKS ARE MADE OUT OF WHAT?This was just made out of wood, like boards.SO, WERE ALL 6 HORSES AND BURRO PRETTY MUCH ON THE GROUNDBEHIND THE WINDBREAKS?Five of them was and two of them was over in a little draw about 100 yards right next tothe highway.IN THAT DRAW, WERE THEY ON TOP OF SNOW?Ye s .SO THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT WHATEVER IT WAS THAT KILLED ANDPUNCTURED THESE ANIMALS, IT OCCURRED SOMEHOW AFTER THEBLIZZARD?After, or maybe it snowed a little after they were dead. I think that's what they said."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"HOW LONG DID THAT STORM LAST?It started snowing on Sunday evening until Monday evening around 8 p.m.YOU FOUND THE ANIMALS AROUND 4:30 P.M. TUESDAY, OCTOBER 11.Yeah.WERE YOU INSIDE OF YOUR RANCHHOUSE DURING THAT WHOLE BLIZZARD?Yes, and it's probably 1.5 miles from where these horses (and burro) were.YOU NEVER HEARD ANYTHING?No, all you could hear was the wind. We lost power at 9 o'clock on Sunday evening and itnever came back on until 4 p.m. Monday.WHY JUST THE PUNCTURE WOUNDS?Ye s .DID THE VET OR SHERIFF MAKE ANY COMMENTS?Yeah, they are all baffled. They can't figure nothing out. The only thing I can tell you forsure is that it's pretty much a big mystery about the whole deal and the horses are dead.That's about all I can tell you for sure.\" Veterinarian Baffled by Puncture Holesand No Blood ClottingEleven days later on October 22, 16 more horses were found dead on the William DeWittranch not far from the Sixkiller pastures. The same veterinarian who investigated thehorses and burro also examined the 16 horses. He is Dr. John Heikkila, (HAY-cue-luh) D.V. M., who has worked in Colorado since graduating from Colorado State University in1990 with his veterinarian degree. He told me this week he thought the 16 DeWitt horseswere from lightning strike in a storm that occurred around October 18 to 19. But the sixhorses and burro on the Sixkiller ranch have him completely baffled because the punctureholes are unexplained and so is the lack of blood clotting in the hearts, veins and arteriesof the animals he examined.John Heikkila, D.V.M., Veterinarian in Calhan region since 1982, Calhan, Colorado:\"At present I do not have any explanation for the puncture holes in the Sixkiller horses andburro. Again, the description of them: they were about a quarter-inch puncture through theskin. When the skin was reflected and your analogy of a hole punch or paper punch theinside was a perfectly round hole, approximately one-quarter inch in diameter and that's onthe inside of the skin. I had a bruise immediately underneath.Of course, we suspected gunshots immediately and called the Sheriff's Department. Andwe were suspicious of some crime because of the number of horses in close proximity.Once the Sheriff's Department got there, I dissected the bruises and this initial puncturewound was over the skull of this horse (mare). Once you dissected the bruise off, therewas not any wound or mark on the skull plate itself to be found.I also found additional puncture wounds on the hocks (legs) and in the same instance, hada bruise that might extend half to three-quarters of an inch in depth. But no damage tobone or tissue any deeper than that. In one knee of a horse, I did remove that (hole) andtook it in for x-ray looking for lead fragments and there were no indication of leadfragments in that x-ray.HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANY OF THESE HOLES WITH THE BRUISING?No.THIS IS THE FIRST TIME?And I've been in the area over in Limon since 1992 and I've never observed those holesthere either. Could Unidentified Puncture Holes"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Be Biopsy Punch Samples from Hide?HAVE YOU AS A VETERINARIAN EVER TAKEN A BIOPSY SAMPLE FROM ANANIMAL AND DONE THE BIOPSY WITH SOME KIND OF PUNCHING TOOL THATWOULD LEAVE A HOLE A QUARTER-INCH BY AN INCH DEEP?Certainly, there is a biopsy instrument a punch graft for punch skin grafts. That's about thesize of the punch skin graft biopsy instrument.THAT WOULD BE LOOKING ONLY FOR SOMETHING IN THE HIDE OF ANANIMAL?Yes, in the immediate skin or more specifically, you are generally taking that punchedpiece of skin and transplanting that over to a wound area to try to get simulation ofepitheliation and healing.THE HOLE, THE ROUND PIECE OF TISSUE, WOULD BE USED TO GENERATETISSUE ON SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN BURNED OR HURT?Yes, in a burn wound or an extensive scarring over granulation tissue, in particular inhorses. Normal healing, you form granulation tissue and then the skin in regeneration, youhave epitheliation migration of the epithelial cells. I crossed that granulation tissue fromthe skin margins, but all part of normal healing. In a large wound, to speed up the healingor in one where epitheliation has been inadequate, you can take an autogenous graft froman animal, take a punch biopsy and put that in the granulation tissue embedded in thegranulation tissue to get epitheliation all across the scar or wound area.WHICH WOULD BE LIKE A SKIN GRAFT?Yes, essentially it's a skin graft.SO, THE ONLY ANOMALY ON THE SIX HORSES AND BURRO AT NEDSIXKILLER'S, FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW, ARE THE HOLES WITH BRUISING?That and lack of coagulation in the blood. Dr. Heikkila Convinced the 16 HorsesOn DeWitt Ranch Were Killed by Lightning StrikeHOW DID THE SIXKILLER ANIMAL DEATHS COMPARE TO THE 16 HORSES ONTHE DE WITT RANCH?Mr. Sixkiller's I do not think that is lightning strike at all. But Mr. De Witt's, I do think thatis lightning strike.WHAT IS THE STRONGEST EVIDENCE ON THE DE WITT RANCH THAT IT WASLIGHTING STRIKE?A lot of the positioning of the horses showing sudden strike is real consistent. Also,advanced rate of decomposition of the tissues. A couple of suspected burn marks, but notconfirmed. And the rupture of ocular globes with remaining tissues. Essentially thevitreous fluid of the eye boiled and boiled out.SO, THE EYE TISSUE IS THERE AND NOT COMPLETELY CUT OUT AS IS THECASE IN THE LARGE ANIMAL MUTILATION MYSTERY?The tissue was there. I initially on a first walk by thought there was a lot of bird predationon the carcasses and typically birds will clean the eye out down to the bone. On the returnand getting closer evaluation, I did find tissue collapsed into the eye socket in each andevery case where the eye was ruptured.WAS THAT IN ALL 16 HORSES?No, it wasn't in all 16 horses, but it was in a large percentage of the horses a largerpercentage of the horses than I normally find with lightning strikes.\" Other Unreported Unusual Horse Deathsin Calhan, Colorado, Area in 2005"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"\"HAVE THERE BEEN ANY OTHER CASES OF UNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHS IN ELPASO OR E LBERT COUNTIES THIS YE AR?Ned Sixkiller: \"Oh, yeah, there was another horse that come up dead. And then down inEllicott like earlier, and that's what they said about it. If I remember right they sure saidthat horse had been shot. But according to what I understand, they did not find any bulletsin it either. And then there have been quite a few horses around you get to talking withpeople that's come up with a dead horse that's unexplainable. They never thought muchabout it, but it just died. It was kind of strange that it died because there wasn't anythingwrong like that morning and they just found him dead that night.HOW MANY OF THOSE CASES, DO YOU THINK?Oh, I think there's been half a dozen anyway.\" Calhan, Colorado, Has Long Historyof Unusual Animal DeathsToday I was looking at my old maps I used during my television documentary, A StrangeHarvest (Se e: Earthfiles Shop) to investigate the animal mutilation mystery in Coloradobeginning back in September 1979. Calhan, Colorado was one of the places where animalmutilations kept repeating in cycles since at least the early 1970s. I remember severaldiscussions with Colorado law enforcement about quarter-inch wide by one-inch deepbloodless holes in the neck, brisket or legs that one sheriff back then referred to as \"biopsypunches.\" Why are some pastures and towns such as Calhan the target of the unusual andrepeating animal death phenomenon more than others?To date, I don't have an answer. But I can say with certainty from my own field researchand interviews I have done with hundreds of ranchers and law enforcement: unusualanimal deaths have long been associated with odd silent, black helicopters that havedissolved into misty clouds and unidentified lights and beams in the sky and pastures.Retired and now deceased Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso told me in 1997 that when he wasstationed in Washington, D. C., after WWII to work in Army Research and Developmentin the Pentagon, he saw with his own eyes highly classified documents about worldwideunusual animal deaths that were bloodless and without signs of struggle. He said that theperpetrators of the animal deaths in the documents were specified as \"extraterrestrialbiological entities.\"Maybe lighting did kill the sixteen horses on the William DeWitt ranch. But couldSomething non-human have been involved in the Ned Sixkiller incident that took the livesof six horses and one burro without a clear cause of death? What made all those puncturewounds? Why was the blood in the animals not clotting? New Book and Conference About UFO Crash/RetrievalsIf extraterrestrial biological entities are truly responsible for global unusual animal deaths,what is the agenda? No one yet seems to have that answer, but in documents leaked toBob and Ryan Wood over the past decade, there are references to animal parts beingfound INSIDE at least one wedge-shaped craft that came down or crashed near the TrinitySite at White Sands Missile Range in early July 1947. Ryan has been working for sometime on a new book based on direct and circumstantial evidence that beyond Roswell,there were at least 73 other UFO crashes and retrieval operations by the U. S. governmentand others. Ryan's new and important book is entitled, MAJIC Eyes Only: Earth'sEncounters with Extraterrestrial Technology."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Click on book to order.The book will be released next weekend, November 4 to 6, at the 3rd Annual UFOcrash/retrieval conference in Las Vegas, at the Embassy Suites Hotel and ConventionCenter. I will also be presenting information about an early 1950s crash I have notdiscussed before. For conference tickets, go to www.majesticdocuments.com.This week I talked with Ryan about the 74 UFO crash retrievals that unfoldchronologically in his book and the fact that in 1947, in addition to Roswell, there wereseven other cases ranging from Arizona to Washington State, Kiev in the Ukraine and thenation of Mexico. I asked Ryan why he thinks our American government has worked sohard to keep from the public and media what its learned concerning a non-human presenceinteracting with our planet?Ryan S. Wood, Owner and Producer, www.majesticdocuments.com, President,Plugloads, energy conservation equipment solutions and author of MAJIC Eyes Only:Earth's Encounters with Extraterrestrial Technology, Broomfield, Colorado: \"In mymind it goes back to authority: who is really in charge? Telling the truth and explainingthings could create all sorts of social, religious, political turmoil and they can do studiesand better understand the implications of what would happen if they told the truth. But itwould be an inflection point in history like 9/11. We saw 9/11 happen, but we had no ideahow the events of the future years would unfold and the aggressive war on terror and theinvasion into Iraq, if it was even linked. The same thing is true here with the UFO truth ifthey were to share part, it would take a few years and then the flood gates of informationwould open and trust in our government would continue to dwindle. They don't knowwhere it would go.BUT THEY ARE LIVING A LIE AND HAVE BEEN LIVING A LIE SINCE AT LEASTTHE ROOSEVELT ADMINISTRATION.Oh, yes, completely.BUT WHEN DOES SUSTAINING A HUGE LIE BECOME MORE DESTRUCTIVETHAN A POLICY OF DENIAL IN THE INTERESTS OF NATIONAL SECURITY?Well, that's the $64,000 question. I believe we have already passed that point and thesimple test for that is: if you have an artifact from the future or from a UFO. Can ahundred bright scientists learn more about it than a million scientists and engineers aroundthe world? It's no contest. That's the hubris and the crime against all of science andhumanity that they are perpetrating. Now they may say, 'Hey, we've been leaking littlestuff here and there.' But we just can't imagine the impact of if you had an alien cadaveron the table in 1950, let's say, or 1960, how many of Ph.D.s in exobiology you might haveand how far the world would have come in understanding biology and cancer and healthand life span and intelligence and so forth, but it seems logical they might have made a lotmore progress than they've made.\"Continued in Part 2: Unusual Animal Deaths - Half Cat in San Antonio, TexasMore information:I welcome any similar reports or information from Earthfiles viewers about unusual animaldeaths in your area.

I brought along a yellow pencil aboutone-quarter of an inch in diameter to see if it would fit in the holes. Larry was quickly ableto find one of the two holes he had puzzled over and it was too small for the pencil toenter.Above: Rancher Larry Jurjens tries to insert one-quarter-inch diameter pencil into holeon mutilated cow's chest.

Photograph © 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe.\"The diameter was closer to one-eighth of an inch. There was a clearly defined raised edgeencircling the hole. In past animal mutilation investigations when I've been able to havetissue analyzed by pathologists, those raised edges of mutilation cuts have shown evidenceof high heat, hot enough to cook the hemoglobin and collagen. So, Larry Jurjens helped mecut out the one hole we could find and I put it in an alcohol/distilled water mixture forpreservation and analysis. The second hole that he said was one inch from the other holewe could never find. There were a lot of worms and maggots embedded in the hide itselfby then and might have filled the second hole.\"Also, see other Earthfiles reports about unusual animal deaths: · 10/22/2005 -- A Lifting Beam Technology in Colorado Human Abduction"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"· 10/03/2005 -- 2005 Horse Mutilation in France· 09/15/2005 -- Animal Mutilations Reported in Switzerland, Hollywood and Kansas· 08/26/2005 -- Another Cattle Mutilation in Canada· 08/22/2005 -- More Half Cat Reports: San Jose and Seattle· 08/13/2005 -- Mystery of Bloodless, Decapitated Kangaroos in Melbourne,Australia· 08/11/2005 -- Part 4: Two Men See Cow Mutilated in Light Beam· 08/03/2005 -- Another Cattle Mutilation in Pondera County, Montana· 08/03/2005 -- Part 3: Two Men See Cow Mutilated in Light Beam· 08/02/2005 -- Part 1: Anomalies Confirmed in Pennsylvania and Arizona RandomlyDowned Crops· 07/28/2005 -- Feedback on Half Cat Mystery· 07/26/2005 -- Part 2: Two Men See Cow Mutilated in Light Beam· 07/22/2005 -- Part 1: Two Men See Cow Mutilated in Light Beam· 07/14/2005 -- More Half Cat Mutilations in Seattle, Washington Region· 07/07/2005 -- Part 2: Eyewitness Description of Cattle Mutilation· 07/04/2005 -- Part 1: Eyewitness Description of Cattle Mutilation· 07/01/2005 -- U.
