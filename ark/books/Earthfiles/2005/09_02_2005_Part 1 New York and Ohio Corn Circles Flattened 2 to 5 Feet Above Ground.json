There are five new reports. There were two newformations that were discovered August 12, 2005. The first one was in Canisteo, SteubenCounty, New York. One of the senior meteorologists for the National Weather Service inthat area reported that there were two circular areas that were found flattened in corn. Hefound them while he was investigating damage from an F-1 tornado that went through thearea. The circular flattened areas were off the main track of the tornado by about 30 to 40yards. The larger circle was approximately 30 feet in diameter and the smaller one about16 feet in diameter. The circular areas were not flattened all the way to the ground. Theywere only partially bent over.The tornado damage investigator went to look at the tornado track. Tornadoes leave a veryspecific and defined path when they touch down on the ground. This one was confined andthe track crossed through some trees down in a valley that had a creek. The tornadocrossed a corn field, clipped the corner of the field, took off a barn roof and went backinto the sky. The investigator could not understand what produced the circles in corn 100to 150 feet away from the tornado's path.Interview:Jeffrey Wilson, Director, Independent Crop Circle Researchers Association(ICCRA), Williamsburg, Ohio:Canisteo, Steuben County, New YorkAugust 12, 2005 - CornCanisteo, Steuben County, New York, is west of Elmira and southeast of Buffalo."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"One of two corn circles in which plants were bent two feet off the ground, as shown in this photo,up to five feet above ground in interlaced \"canopies.\" Canisteo, Steuben County, New York, discoveredon August 12, 2005.

The partially bentareas were very circular.The National Weather Service meteorologist said he had never seen anything like it, evenwhen he was in his training on what storm damage does to crops. He spent quite a bit oftime out looking in fields in Nebraska and what storm damage does to fields out there. Hesaid he had never seen anything that appeared like this in Canisteo, which is why heremarked they must be crop circles. So, it's definitely unusual. Greene County, OhioAugust 12, 2005 - CornTwo 2005 unusual crop formations in Greene County, Ohio, have both been east of Dayton,the home of Wright-Patterson AFB. The August 12, 2005, corn event was near Yellow Spring. The July 5,2005,\"herringbone weave\" was south of New Jasper. Both are east of the Miamisburg Mound, a large ancientearthwork in Ohio where the large corn formation below was reported on September 1, 2004.Miamisburg, Ohio, pattern in 8-foot-tall corn reported on September 1, 2004.Length is 222 feet.

It was discovered by aphotographer on a routine photo flight and it took a couple of weeks for the information toreach me. But I visited the formation August 28, and that formation is so extensive. Itcovers a substantial portion of the field. The randomly downed corn also seems to beraised up anywhere from 2 inches to 6 feet above the ground and this has resulted increating several woven canopies, which you can actually walk underneath. In some places,such as the radial lay photo below, the plants were about two feet off the ground and Icould walk on top.Nine-foot-tall corn partially laid over up to six feet above groundin a variety of patterns, including a radial lay from the center outward, Greene County, Ohio,discovered August 12, 2005.

Photograph © 2005 by Jeffrey Wilson, ICCRA.It is incredible! Unfortunately, the farm owners do not want their names or locationreleased to the public. We're run into that this year because people are afraid of ridicule.It's sad because this year in the United States there have been several remarkableanomalies, including these similar above-ground patterns found on the same day in twodifferent states.AS YOU WERE LOOKING AT CORN THAT WAS BENT OVER AND ARCHED ASMUCH AS 6 FEET OFF THE GROUND, WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR HEADABOUT HOW THAT COULD HAVE OCCURRED?I've never seen anything like it before. I've seen weather damage in fields before. I've seenwhat people do to hoax circles. I have not seen this kind of bending in corn fields prior tothis. First of all, the length of the area that is flattened in a straight line is about 3/4 of amile in length and probably close to 30 feet wide.AND ALL OF THAT WOULD BE RAISED UP OFF THE GROUND, JEFF?Yes, in certain places, anywhere from 2 inches off the ground up to 6 feet off the ground.BUT FOR 3/4'S OF A MILE!That's only one side of the field. Then there are, the line kind of turns and makes a90-degree angle and goes up the other side of the field. Although that line is not quite aswide, that line has the higher flattening of the canopy effect.To be honest with you, it was the most strenuous effort to get through this field that I hadever experienced. I thought the worse was trying to cut through soybeans when you haveto rip your way through it. but this was even more difficult than that. My legs from myknees down are just so cut up right now from having to try to wade my way through thatstuff. It really took a toll on my body just trying to get through it.WHAT DO YOU THINK MADE THOSE CANOPIES? HOW?I could not begin to explain it unless whatever the energy was came down and somethingkind of interfered with it and created the scatter shot across the field that resulted in thisnot flattening all the way down. It is enormous. I can say this with some certainty it is thelargest area of flattening that I've had to go through with any formation. It's really, reallyenormous!The aerial photo will give you an idea of the areas that were flattened, including thepockmarked effect across the entire field. If I had not seen the aerial photograph before Iwalked into the field, I would not even begin to have an idea what it would look like. Theaerial I have does not quite show the radial effect in the one corner of the field because itwas taken on an angle at the far edge at the back of the field. There is definitely somereally unusual stuff in this field.Northwood, Grand Forks County, North DakotaAugust 19, 2005 - Wheat"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"\"Thought bubble\" of five wheat circles, Northwood, North Dakota, reported on August 26, 2005.All five circles swirled counter-clockwise.

There was a series of five circles in wheat creating a 'thoughtbubble'-type design. It was found in the day time by a pilot flying from the nearbymunicipal airport. The five circles are all swirled counter-clockwise, with the swirledcenters actually being several feet off from the true centers. The circle sizes are from largeto small: the first one is about 68 feet in diameter. The second circle is 31 feet in diameter.The third one is about 18 feet in diameter. The fourth one is 9 feet in diameter. And thefifth and smallest circle is about 6.5 feet in diameter.There were no tracks leading into the field that anybody can see originally. But there wasno unusual plant damage reported so far no expulsion cavities, no node elongations, thatkind of thing.THE FACT THERE ARE NO EXPULSION CAVITIES OR LENGTHENING OF THEGROWTH NODES DOES THAT SUGGEST TO YOU THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEENEITHER METEOROLOGICAL OR PEOPLE?It's hard to say in this case. The wheat is so dry at this point. If there was some energy toaffect the crop, it might not elongate the nodes because they have been dried out.This 2005 formation is very similar to another that appeared about 300 miles to thesoutheast in Owatonna, Steele County, Minnesota in wheat on August 1, 2000.Seven-circle wheat \"thought bubble\" was reported on August 1, 2000, inOwatonna, Minnesota.
