Â© 2005 by Linda Moulton Howe \"It does look like the sun has been more active in the last 50 years than it has been for along time.One estimate is that there has not been this long a time period of high activity insomething like 8,000 years.\"- David Hathaway, Ph.D., NASA Left: Giant sunspot 720 erupted for seventh time on Jan. 20, 2005, unleashing a powerful X 7-class solarflare.The blast hurled a coronal mass ejection (CME) into space and sparked the strongest radiation storm sinceOctober 1989.Jack Newton of Arizona photographed the sunspot rotating toward the sun's limb and other side on Jan. 19th.Right: Bright auroras spread across northern Europe on January 21st soon after 720's coronal mass ejectioncrashed into Earth's magnetic field.

February 11, 2005 Huntsville, Alabama - On Saturday, January 15, the Sun eruptedwith three strong solar flares. The next day, the Sun erupted again. The Space Weatheroffice at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Boulder,Colorado, released warnings about intense radiation storms that could damage satellitesand interrupt radio communications. By Monday, January 17th, the Sun erupted yet againwith a strong solar flare and some of the brightest auroras in years were beingphotographed over the northern latitudes. The next day there was yet another strong solarflare, totaling six major eruptions in four days.Then on Wednesday, January 20th, the Sun let loose with a powerful X 7-class solar flare -the strongest radiation storm since October 1989. The high energy proton release wasgreater than 100 Mega Volts, equivalent to something like a million megatons of TNT."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Region 720 flaring brightly on the right side of the Sun on January 20, 2005, at 15:25Universal Time. Filter by the Solar & Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO).The seven intense solar flares were coming from a region on the Sun called \"720\" thatgrew in size rapidly from a small spot to a massive cluster of sunspots as big as ten Earthsin only a few days. That's only happened half a dozen times in the last 130 years of solarmonitoring.How could this happen if the Sun is supposed to be near Solar Minimum? That means it'ssupposed to be near the quietest sunspot time in its regular 11-year-cycle of decreasing andincreasing sunspot activity. In fact, by the end of this year, the sun should be its calmestbefore sunspots begin increasing for the next Solar Maximum expected to peak in 2010 to2012.Yet, our Sun has continued to erupt with strong X solar flares since the major severecategory outbreak at Halloween time in 2003. This week I talked with David Hathaway,Solar Physics Group Leader at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville,Alabama. I asked Dr. Hathaway about our surprisingly energetic sun and the recent andgigantic Region 720, which has now deteriorated, but leaves the question: why is the Sunstill so active?Interview:David Hathaway, Solar Physics Group Leader, NASA's Marshall Space FlightCenter, Huntsville, Alabama: \"The surprising thing with this one was how rapidly it grewin size. Very quickly, within a day becoming the size of the Earth; then in two days twicethat size again.We've only seen a few in the past 130 years that have grown as fast as this one. Most thatgrow this fast end up producing what we call a lot of solar activity flares, huge explosionson the surface of the Sun that release the energy equivalent of a million megatons of TNTwithin a matter of seconds and blow off material from the Sun in the form of what we calla Coronal Mass Ejection (CME). These are clouds of material, a billion tons of matter thatstream through the solar system at about a million miles an hour. When that cloud ofmaterial hits the Earth, it can shake our magnetic field and shower our polar regions withparticles that produce things like the aurora borealis.WHAT'S THE CURRENT HYPOTHESIS ABOUT WHAT WOULD CAUSE THISSTORM ON THE SUN TO BECOME SO LARGE SO RAPIDLY TEN EARTH SIZES INA MATTER OF A FEW DAYS?We know that magnetic fields are what make sunspots, very intense magnetic fields thousands of times stronger than the Earth's field. We are quite sure that those magneticfields are produced deep within the Sun where they are stretched by fluid flows within thesun. When they get strong enough, they become buoyant and push aside the surroundinggases and are lighter and rise to the surface. The stronger the fields are, the faster they riseand the bigger the sunspots they make. So, apparently this was one that had been buildingfor awhile and once it let lose from inside the sun, rapidly came to the surface and againgrew at a pretty phenomenal rate over the course of just a few days."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"IF THIS YEAR IN 2005, A YEAR BEFORE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO GET TO THEBOTTOM OF THE SOLAR MINIMUM (CYCLE 23) BEFORE IT STARTSINCREASING AGAIN (INTO CYCLE 24), IF THERE WAS ANOTHER EVENT SUCHAS THE 720 SUNSPOT COMPLEX, WOULD THAT BE UNUSUAL ENOUGH FORSOLAR PHYSICISTS TO ASK, 'WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE SUN?' SOMEPEOPLE THINK IT IS MORE ACTIVE THAN IT SHOULD BE.Certainly if we have another outburst like this, we'll have to look closely as to ourunderstanding of how it happens and why it should happen repeatedly like this so late inthe solar cycle. Sun More Active in Past 50 YearsThan Has Been for 8,000 YearsDO YOU YOURSELF THINK THAT THERE ARE ANY ANOMALIES ABOUT THESUN'S ACTIVITIES NOW? SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT THERE HAS BEEN MOREENERGY RELEASED AND OTHERS ARGUE IT'S BEEN LESS. IT'S AS IF THERE ISA CONFUSING PICTURE ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SUN'SENERGY AND THE EARTH?Certainly there is a fair amount of controversy as to the total output from the sun howbright it is when you add it up over all its different colors and how that affects our climatehere on Earth. I think there is very good evidence that solar activity does influence Earth'sclimate, but not at the level that would explain the latest warming in the last 50 years butmight contribute to it. There have been recent studies that looked at radioisotopes in icethat are produced by cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere. The sun modulates the cosmicrays that come in, so we can basically look at solar activity going back for severalthousand years now. It does look like the sun has been more active in the last 50 yearsthan it has been for a long time. One estimate is that there has not been this long a timeperiod of high activity in something like 8,000 years. What Happens in Solar Maximum of 2010-2012?WITH THAT CONTEXT, DO YOU AS A PERSON WHO STUDIES THE SUN ANDSOLAR PHYSICS HAVE ANY EXPECTATION FOR WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN THISNEXT SOLAR MAXIMUM?By the end of 2005 to 2006 the Sun will reach its solar minimum. Then we're suspecting bylate 2006, we'll start to see the rise in sunspots again toward the next solar maximumaround 2010 - 2012, we suspect. Certainly there is controversy there. I have colleagueswho think the next maximum is going to be much smaller than this one. But the indicationsthat we've looked at suggest that it ought to be at least the size of this one, if not somewhatlarger.There have also been periods in the Sun's history where it's been dormant, where it has notproduced sunspots for many decades so the sunspot cycle basically stops. Some of mycolleagues are even suggesting that we might be heading for one of those. It's called a'Grand Minimum.' Again, there are few sunspots. The last big one was from mid-1600s tothe early 1700s, where the Sun went for 70 years with hardly any sunspots at all.AND THAT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LITTLE ICE AGE, RIGHT?That's right.\"[Editor's Note: Geoscience Research Institute states: \"The Little Ice Age is notcharacterized by similar amounts of polar ice so far south, but rather by a period of severalhundred years in which the winters were particularly severe in the Northern Hemisphere.In addition, other climatic features such as cooler summer temperatures, changes in theamount of rainfall and major shifts in wind patterns were observed. There were significantchanges in the size of glaciers in the mountains. \"The period just before the Little Ice Age - 1100-1300 - also was a weather anomaly. Itwas characteristically different from the present day in that average temperatures werehigher. Thus a more marked shift to a colder time is more visible in the historical record.\"See temperature and ice graphs below.]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"From 1100 to 1900, estimated mean yearly temperatures based on a variety of climatic, politicaland social indicators.

YOUR PROJECTIONTHAT IT MIGHT BE AN EVEN MORE ACTIVE SOLAR MAXIMUM WOULDINTUITIVELY SEEM MORE CORRECT. IF IT WERE, WHAT WOULD THECONSEQUENCES BE FOR SPACE WEATHER, SATELLITES AND SO FORTH?The various predictions are based on different measurements of the Sun, different ways oflooking at the Sun. Different pieces of information give a different story.What we've looked at is how fast the flows are on the surface of the Sun. When we lookback over the past 130 years and see how the speed of those flows are related to solaractivity, we found that when it's fast, you tend to get a large cycle for one or two cyclesinto the future. What we found was that the cycle before last, the flow was very fast. Itshould have built up strong magnetic fields near the poles that would be dragged down intothe Sun and should produce a large cycle for the next Solar Maximum Cycle 24.If the Sun is more active, then we do have the problems associated with solar activity radiation from the Sun, particles that come out of flares and CMEs can damage satellites inspace. They can cause sickness to astronauts that are outside the protection of aspacecraft; they can cause power outages here on the ground like they did back in 1989when it caused a surge of power through powerlines that can take out transformers andknock out power on the ground as well.\"If Dr. Hathaway and his colleagues are not right about the next solar maximum (cycle 24)being intense yet again - and the sun goes the opposite direction and produces very few, ifany, sunspots, would the Earth go into another \"Little Ice Age,\" as it did during the lastGrand Minimum more than 300 years ago? Whatever the answer is, we'll all know inanother two or three years when the sun should start cycling back to Solar Maximum -either with, or without, increasing sunspots.Websites:http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/http://www.grisda.org/origins/10051.htmhttp://science.nasa.gov/ssl/pad/solar/greenwch.htmDavid Hathaway's Solar History Research: http://science.nasa.gov/ssl/pad/solar/Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
