Dr.Jerome Hunsaker (MJ-7) was director of NACA in 1947.NASA National Aeronautics and Space Administration evolved from NACA in 1957.NAVSPASUR Acronym for the Naval Space Surveillance System constructed in1959 as a dedicated space surveillance system with transmitters at Lake Kickapoo, Texas;Gila River, Arizona; and Jordan Lake, Arkansas.NBS National Bureau of Standards, that housed the Central Radio (Wave) PropagationLaboratory (CRPL), Boulder, Colorado.NDRC National Defense Research Council of OSRD.\"NEPA\" Proword for a space nuclear propulsion project of the Atomic EnergyCommission in 1946 through 1948.NORAD North American Aerospace Defense Command is a joint United States andCanadian organization which provides aerospace warning and aerospace control for NorthAmerica. It was founded on May 12, 1958, under the name North American Air DefenseCommand. Since 1963, NORAD's main technical facility has been located insideCheyenne Mountain near Colorado Springs, Colorado. While the terms \"NORAD\" and\"Cheyenne Mountain\" are often used interchangeably to describe the facility, NORAD isthe name of the Command, while Cheyenne Mountain is the name of the facility. Thefacility is hosted by the U.S. Air Force, under the command of the 721st Mission SupportGroup, part of the 21st Space Wing, headquartered out of Peterson Air Force Base.NRL Naval Research Laboratory. Stennis Space Center, Mississippi, 45 miles northeastof New Orleans, Louisiana, (NRL-SSC) is the major center for in-house Navy research anddevelopment in oceanography, marine geology, geophysics, geoacoustics, andgeotechnology. Stennis Space Center is NASA's primary center for rocket propulsiontesting and home to NASA's Applied Sciences Directorate. Another NRL facility is inMonterey, California: the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center whichis the only scientific center in the Navy wholly dedicated to atmospheric research. AnotherNRL facility is the Chesapeake Bay Detachment (CBD), which provides facilities andsupport services for research in radar, electronic warfare, optical devices, materials,communications, and fire research. CBD also hosts facilities of the Navy TechnologyCenter for Safety and Survivability, which conducts fire research on simulated carrier,surface, and submarine platforms."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"NRO National Reconnaissance Office jointly operated since 1961 by NSA, CIA, AirForce Systems Command under the National Security Council (NSC) to design, construct,operate and maintain high altitude aircraft, satellites and other national technical means toconduct strategic surveillance and espionage. NRO was created under the KennedyAdministration in a push to create a permanent reconnaissance organization. Secretary ofDefense Robert McNamara and his deputy, Roswell Gilpatric, produced a September 9,1961, letter to the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) Allen Dulles established theNational Reconnaissance Office (NRO). NRO was to be responsible for all satellite andaerial overflights over denied territory, including the CORONA, ARGON, LANYARD,GAMBIT, and SAMOS satellite programs and U-2, A-12, ST/POLY overflight programs.Two key features of the early NRO were the joint directorship and the lack of specialassignment of functions to the Air Force and CIA. The joint directorship was a result, inpart, of Dulles' fear that the CIA would be held liable for actions taken by Air Forcepersonnel. NRO and NSA operate ground and space based sensors to track and catalogspace borne objects as well as SDOC (Space Defense Operations Center). Many insidesources describe NRO as directly involved with monitoring and interacting with the UFOphenomenon.NSA National Security Agency. On July 26, 1947, only three weeks after one or morediscs allegedly crashed in the Roswell, New Mexico region, President Harry Trumansigned the National Security Act of 1947, establishing a new post-WWII focus onAmerica's perceived national security issues. One of the agencies that evolved from thatact was the Armed Forces Security Agency (AFSA) that had been created on May 20,1949, in the Department of Defense under the command of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. TheAFSA was to be responsible for directing the communications and electronic intelligenceactivities of military intelligence units such as the Army Security Agency, Naval SecurityGroup and the Air Force Security Service. However, the agency had little power andlacked a centralized coordination mechanism. So, the idea for NSA began in a December10, 1951, memo sent by Walter Bedell Smith to James B. Lay, Executive Secretary of theNational Security Council. The super spy agency was official on June 13, 1952, by anExecutive Order of President Harry S. Truman which was classified.NSC National Security Council. Also emerging from the National Security Act of 1947,the NSC held its first meeting on September 24, 1947 at the White House. That very day,and likely in that same meeting, the MJ-12 document discusses an executive order byPresident Truman to create the MJ-12 Special Studies Group.NSF National Science Foundation. The NSF also evolved from a National Security Actprovision for funding basic research into the applied sciences to allow any programoperated by NSF that discovered a physical principal, event or relationship that mightapply to the national security interests of the U. S. to be immediately \"militarized.\" Such anational security classification would automatically put the discovery under the directcontrol of the Research and Development Board (RDB) of the Secretary of Defense in thePentagon. NSF was established on May 10, 1950.ONR Office of Naval Research.ORI Office of Research and Innovations, U. S. Navy.OSI Office of Scientific Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).OSRD Office of Scientific Research and Development of the Office of EmergencyManagement in the Executive Office of the President. From 1940 to 1947, OSRD wasdirected by Dr. Vannevar Bush (MJ-2) who was President of the Carnegie Institution inWashington, D. C. Dr. James Conant, President of Harvard College in Cambridge,Massachusetts, served as Deputy Director. Dr. Lloyd Berkner (MJ-12) served as deputyfollowing Dr. Conant's return to Harvard. Dr. Detlev Bronk (MJ-6) was OSRD's principalmanager of medical research and worked with General Twining's (MJ-4) AMC, especiallyon matters related to high altitude research and human physiology. All V-2 rocket testingand the establishment of White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico was the directresponsibility of OSRD.OSS Office of Strategic Services of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during WWII.PAC B AR Pacific Barrier Radar, constructed in 1983 for satellite tracking at SanMiguel, Philippines and Saipan."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"PAV E PAWS A system of LPAR (FPS-115) UHF space sensors to detect spacevehicles, constructed in the 1980s at Beale AFB, California; Otis AFB, Massachusetts;Robins AFB, Georgia; Goodfellow AFB, Eldorado, Texas.Phillips Laboratory A division of U.S. Air Force Systems Command, HanscomAFB, Massachusetts, and Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, New Mexico.

RAND has had a \"special relationship\" with U. S. Air Force Systems Commandand the Aerospace Corporation. In July 1948, it developed another special relationship,one with the Atomic Energy Commission in RAND's Physics Department which wasphysically separated from other RAND divisions and required an AEC \"Q\" clearance foraccess. Later RAND developed other special relationships with the Ford Foundation, theCarnegie Institution in Washington, D. C., and with the Rockefeller Institute. RAND's onlyclients in its first two decades of existence were the U. S. Air Force and the Atomic EnergyCommission. [ Source: The RAND Corporation Â© 1966 by Bruce L. R. Smith, HarvardUniv.
