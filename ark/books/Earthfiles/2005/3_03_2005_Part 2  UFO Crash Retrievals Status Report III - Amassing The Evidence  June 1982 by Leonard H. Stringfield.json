Here begins Part 2of Status Report III, written in June 1982. The series of status reports, I through VII, werewritten by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report IV begins atEarthfiles 021205. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. \"THE FIRST PERSON REPORT: CLASSIFIED 'A' This paper follows the reportorial pattern established in The UFO Crash/RetrievalSyndrome, Status Report II, published by MUFON in January 1980. As before, casehistory reports are divided into two parts. Reports from first person witnesses areclassified as 'A,' while 'B' reports concern secondhand or intermediary informationand other relative data submitted by researchers. CASE A-1: HJ retired, resides near Greensburg, Pennsylvania, with wife and family. Served inU. S. Army, saw duty as Sergeant in Korea with 24th Infantry where he was injured.Out-Patient at V. A. hospital. Initial research in this case was capably conducted by Lois Kukick of Irwin,Pennsylvania (a member of PCUFOR), who visited HJ in November 1978, and againin April 1980, as a prelude to my investigation. Copies of her two reports were sentto me for evaluation and follow-up. During 1980, I talked by phone with HJ severaltimes, although there were interrupted periods when he had been hospitalized. Hisfirsthand observation of a military retrieval operation follows: As a private in B Company (age 17), HJ and his unit, under command of Sgt. R. S.(name withheld) were on maneuvers near camp Polk, Louisiana, in the summer of1953. At dusk, a patrol watched an egg-shaped object crash land into soft sandy soil.According to HJ, authorities were notified and both A and B Companies wereordered to remain at the site until relieved. A special detachment was rushed to thescene, later followed by an ambulance and other special equipment. HJ said he gotwithin 15 yards of the object before he and others of Company B were ordered byLt. W. (name withheld) to pull back to about 100 yards. 'Peons like me,' he said,'had to get out of the way.' According to HJ, the large ovoid object was without windows or lights and wassurrounded by a fin-like protrusion at its equator which was still rotating. Theground around it, he said, was burned into a powdery substance like crushed brickand was still hot. Soon to arrive at the site were top brass and medics. He remembers them going tothe hatch on the side of the craft which was open. After awhile, he watched as twomedics carried away a stretcher containing a body to the ambulance. Then threeothers of the (craft's) crew emerged and were aided by the medics as though injured.'One of them,' he said, 'kept looking at the one in the litter and made strange noises. Icouldn't believe what I was seeing.'"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" According to HJ, softening his voice when he told me his story the first time, theoccupants of the craft were only three and a half to four feet tall, of very slight buildand walked as though they had no knees - very stiff, bending only at the hips. From his vantage point, said HJ, he could not distinguish any features of the handsand commented: 'They looked like they were wearing mittens.' The large heads, alsowithout features, he believed were covered by a helmet. Their uniform, tight-fitting,he described as dull metallic green. He later heard that the survivors had been sent to a hospital and 'put into isolation,'but all had soon died. He also heard that their cadavers were sent to a medicalcenter near Washington, D. C. The crash site, said HJ, was roped off for a 50 mile radius. MPs were put on guardeverywhere. Restricted to the post for two days, the men of Company B were thencalled into an Intelligence office and told that what they had witnessed was a secretArmy experiment and they were warned not to talk about it. According to HJ in his testimony before Lois Kukick in person and to me by phone,every person who had anything to do with the retrieval operation was subjected to'every kind of test' for three days at the base hospital. In her report to me, Lois Kukick commented: 'I think we're on to something big. Hewas reluctant to talk about it to me at first, but agreed when I told him it would beheld in confidence. He does not want publicity.' To help better understand and clarify some issues in the incredible story told by HJto Lois Kukick and me, and to refute the occasional charge that my C/R cases arehearsay, I got his approval to allow Dr. Peter Rank (see 'The Witness Model') to callhim at home at anytime and to freely question both his case and HJ personally on amedical level. Dr. Rank's letter to me dated March 15, 1982 follows:March 15, 1982 Letter from Dr. Peter Rank: 'Dear Len ... I hasten to reply to your request about my telephone call to HJ. Icalled Mr. J on a Sunday early in December and had an extensive hour longconversation with him. Mr. J. is, by his own admission, now in his early fifties. In 1953, he was ayoung man in the U. S. Army Infantry undergoing basic training at Fort Polk,Louisiana. I believe it was in July. His basic training over, the last trainingexercises included full scale maneuvers using the uninhabited militaryreservation near Camp Polk. One evening, at approximately 7:00 p.m., he was on maneuvers with hisplatoon which was comprised of approximately 8 or 9 men. All the infantrymen in the area were divided into the red and blue teams and given militaryassignments. He and his platoon saw an unidentified flying object land 'out in theboondocks' and just sit there. It was as wide as a three bedroom single storyranch house. Using their walkie talkies, the platoon contacted headquartersand advised them of same. Shortly thereafter, medics, military police and high ranking brass appeared.Mr. J and his platoon saw the medics carry one small humanoid out of theunidentified flying object on a stretcher and assist the others walking out ofthe unidentified flying object. A portion of the UFO fell away revealing aramp which permitted access to the interior. All the individuals in the platoon were strictly warned not to discuss theincident. He and his platoon were not given terminal leave following trainingand were sent immediately thereafter to Korea. Mr. J. is a relatively unsophisticated and uneducated man. It is my judgmentthat he does not have sufficient imagination to make up this story, andfurthermore, to maintain this story over a period of nearly 30 years. He alsoprovided corroborating names and addresses, although the addresses areprobably outdated. In relating his story, Mr. J. provided the ring of authenticity. In my judgment,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"he has no secondary gain. He is not a hoaxer. He is too naive to manufacturethis story and, indeed, too unsophisticated to appreciate its true significance. All the details provided to me by him have a close corroboration with othersimilar UFO incidents. Mr. J. has also indicated that he has never readanything on UFOs. Indeed, I doubt whether he can read very well at all.' Leonard Stringfield Comment: During our many phone calls, HJ mentioned thathe had the names and addresses of other Company B personnel 'tucked away' withother army-day papers, which he could not readily find. Eventually, he found themand on my request, he sent them to Dr. Rank who in turn sent them to me for followup. I also requested during phone calls in September and October 1981, that heconsider sending me a signed statement highlighting his retrieval experience. Heconsented, wrote three pages, and signed his name. His wife mailed the letter at thelocal Post Office on October 3rd or 4th. It never arrived. On February 3, 1982, Icalled HJ to inquire about his health and to advise him to send another statement byregistered mail. His phone had been disconnected. CASE A-2: KA is married, retired and resides in New York City. Served in U. S. Air Force, 1954-1955, member of local astronomy group; won achievement award. Initial investigation into this case was commendably conducted by researchers FredSchaefer, Gerald Miskar and Linda Robinson, all in New Jersey. Included in a34-page report prepared by the Schaefer Group is a first person account of KA'smission in a military retrieval operation of a crashed UFO in New Mexico in 1954, astate map showing the approximate crash site, and a drawing by KA showing theposition of the crashed craft in relation to four alien fatalities strewn outside thecraft and attempts by Schaefer to obtain verification of certain data and his group'sevaluation of the case. The Schaefer Group first learned of the incident on February 28, 1981, whileattending a lecture given by James Mullaney at the Edmund Scientific Co. inBarrington, New Jersey. It was during intermission that KA came forward to Mullaney, hoping to findsomeone he could trust to relate his UFO experience. Schaefer, having Mullaney'sacquaintance, was introduced to KA, who preferred to remain unidentified at thattime. With time pressing, arrangements were made to meet again on March 7, 1981.But KA stressed one condition: Schaefer must agree to swear on a Bible that hewould never divulge his name or address to anyone. Through the cooperation of Clark McClelland of Pittsburgh, channels were clearedfor me to receive the Schaefer report on October 1981, and through negotiation withSchaefer, I was able to make direct contact with KA in December 1981. Bymaintaining a close liaison with KA and the Schaefer Group, I have been able togain more information. Following is a reconstruction of KA's oral statements, in first person, as prepared bythe Schaefer Group:KA, former USAF 1954-1955 about UFO crash near Roswell, NM onApril 12, 1954: 'Early in 1954, I joined the U.S. Air Force. Even though I wasonly eighteen years old, I had acquired a good knowledge of cameras. Myreason for joining the Air Force was to make use of this knowledge in the fieldof aerial photography. I took my basic training at Sampson Air Force Base near Geneva, New York.After completing about one month of basic training, I was approached by anofficer who told me to pack my gear because I was being reassigned toanother base for special training. That same day, four other airmen and I wereflown via Mohawk Airlines (charter) from Sampson to what is now KennedyInternational Airport in New York City. There we boarded another charteredairliner (airline unknown) and were flown to Roswell, New Mexico (WalkerAir Force Base). There I began special training in the Sikorsky H-19helicopter, also known as the 'Flying Bathtub.' This training was conducted inrelation to desert search and rescue operations. On April 12, 1954, between 6:30 and 7:15 p.m., I was playing ping-pong withmy fellow crew members when we were ordered by an officer to pack our"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"gear in 15 minutes and report to the flight line, as there had been a crash in thedesert and it was our mission. (Our crew was known as Rescue 4.) When I arrived at the flight line, our chopper was ready to depart. As we weretaking off, an unfamiliar voice said over the intercom, 'Men, this is not a drill.This is a red alert scramble.' It was then that I realized that someone in thecockpit, other than a regular crew member, was in complete command of theaircraft and was giving orders. As I remember, we headed north with Route 285 to my right. We flewapproximately 25 to 30 miles, passing over a lake at that point, and thenchanged course to the northwest. We continued heading in this new direction for about 10 miles, where wecleared a small cliff. Suddenly, below and slightly ahead of us, we saw whatappeared to be brightly flashing red, blue and yellow-white lights. As we flewoverhead at an altitude of approximately forty feet, we could plainly seebelow us the outline of a round silvery object. After hovering for a fewminutes, we descended to thirty feet. At this point, the 'stranger' in the cockpitgave the order to turn on the spotlight. When the light was turned on, we sawbelow us a round, metallic, saucer-like object, approximately 40 to 50 feet indiameter. The craft appeared to have crashed edgewise into the sand. The saucer-like object had a stationary dome in the center, but the outer rimwas still spinning in a counter-clockwise direction, and the lights on this outeredge were rotating in the same direction. But what startled us more was thesight of four small bodies scattered outside the craft. They were motionlessand appeared to be dead. Even from our altitude (thirty feet), it was obviousthat these bodies were abnormally proportioned. They were small in size,approximately 4 to 4.5 feet tall, with extremely large heads which were out ofproportion to the rest of their bodies. They were dressed the same, in tight-fitting, dark blue uniforms. They wore no helmets. Even with the spotlightshining on them, their faces seemed to have a light green, luminous tint. Afterobserving the incredible sight below us for several minutes, we just looked ateach other in disbelief. At this time, I was ordered to take several pictures from different angles whilethe helicopter hovered at thirty feet. Then the order was given to land, and ourhelicopter touched down approximately one hundred feet away from theobject. After I jumped out of the chopper, two things immediately became obvious:(1) the overpowering stench, like that of automobile battery acid thatpermeated the area; (2) the headlights of several approaching ground vehicles.As these ground vehicles came nearer, I glanced at the cockpit of ourhelicopter in order to get a look at the 'stranger' who was giving the orders.Unfortunately, the dim lights of the control panel revealed only the head andshoulders of a man. At this time, the ground vehicles, which included several trucks, arrived onthe scene. Approximately fifteen to twenty men dressed in fatigues emergedfrom the vehicles. Some of these men were wearing side arms, but I did notnotice any rifles or automatic weapons. As we walked toward the site, one ofthe members of the ground crew stopped us about forty feet from the objectand informed us that we could go no closer. by this time, the stench was sobad that one of the ground crew members vomited right in front of me. I wasthen ordered to take several pictures of the crashed object and the alienbodies, but I was not allowed to move any closer than forty feet. While I was taking these pictures, the ground crew began very carefully to puttags on the object and on the bodies. During this time, I got into a briefconversation with a member of the ground crew. He told me that on the sideof the craft opposite us was a small open hatchway. He said that he hadlooked inside this hatchway and saw to more dead bodies similar inappearance to the four lying outside the craft. He said that the manner inwhich these bodies were positioned indicated that the aliens had tried to crawlout of the craft on their hands and knees. After I had finished taking pictures, we were ordered to return to Roswell.Just before landing at Roswell, we were instructed not to leave the helicopteruntil ordered to do so. As we were landing, our helicopter was approached byseveral staff cars. After we touched down, our crew was divided into two"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"groups of two. Each pair entered a staff car and was driven to an oldbarracks-like building known as Building # 5. And here is where three days ofwhat we called 'a living hell' began. When we reached Building # 5, we were put into separate rooms andrestricted there. Soon after, four men dressed in civilian clothes and wearingblack ties entered my room. they identified themselves as 'Intelligenceofficers.' Three of these men then left the room. The man who remained askedme to tell him exactly what had occurred in the desert. After I had related myexperience to this man,m he left the room, but was replaced by two of theothers who proceeded to tell me 'what I did not see.' When these mendeparted, the fourth man entered, carrying some type of written material. Hetold me to pay close attention to what he was about to read. He then readwhat sounded like some kind of military law that referred to the penalties thatwould be imposed upon me - fine, imprisonment at hard labor, and generaldischarge - if I were to reveal my experience regarding the mission in thedesert to anyone. After this man had finished reading this information, he leftthe room and was replaced by the first Intelligence officer. This procedurelasted from three to four and a half hours on the first day, and continuedthroughout the next day and the following day. (April 12, 13, and 14, 1954.)The other members of my crew were experiencing the same ordeal at thesame time in their separate rooms. Retrieved Disc Stored in Hangar 18,Roswell, New Mexico While we were being interrogated, scuttlebutt had it that the 'saucer' wasbrought onto the base and an attempt was made to house the object in Hangar46. However, Hangar 46 was too small, so the craft was eventually stored inHangar 18. The day after we were released from interrogation, we were flown byhelicopter to the crash site. As we hovered, one of the four Intelligenceofficers who interrogated us pointed to the ground and said, 'See, I told youguys that you didn't see anything.' As I looked over the area, it appeared as ifthe site had been 'gone over with a fine-tooth comb.' It looked as if nothinghad ever crashed there. I couldn't even see the impact area! After this flight,we were released to our barracks. Shortly after we returned to our barracks, the pilot of my crew went to hislocker and grabbed an ULTRA F-5 camera that he had stored in his locker(but which he was not authorized to have in his possession). He then went intothe latrine, stood on the commode, and began taking pictures through thewindow of the activity around Hanger 18. As for me, I was so exhausted from the ordeal of the past three days that Iflopped down on my bunk and immediately fell asleep. When I awoke thenext morning, the pilot, his gear and the camera were gone - and I never sawhim again! From that time on, activity around Hangar 18 was top security. No one but thetop brass could enter or leave the area. The hangar itself underwentreconstruction and modification in the following two weeks. According to aconstruction worker I spoke to, Hangar 18 was expanded 'to a width of ninestories and a depth of eleven stories.' Heavy refrigeration equipment, radarequipment and sophisticated computers were installed. During this time rumor had it that another UFO crashed near Bandelier, NewMexico, on April 24, 1954. After an undetermined period of time elapsed, we were sent back to SampsonAFB. Upon arrival at my barracks, I was immediately confronted by mysergeant who was furious about my absence. He accused me of going AWOLand assigned me every possible extra duty he could think of. After a brief period of this unwarranted discipline, I could take no more. Ifinally broke down and told the sergeant where I had been and what I haddone during my absence. But he did not believe me. At that point, my mindsnapped and I had a nervous breakdown. I was immediately placed in the basehospital where I remained for at least three months."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" During my stay in the hospital, I remember a doctor injecting me with a largeneedle, which made me feel as though I were in a drunken stupor. I was thenled to a room where four or five people were seated around a table. On thetable was a large microphone (similar to the microphone used during myinterrogation in Building # 5 at Roswell). These people then began to ask mequestions about the UFO retrieval incident in the desert in New Mexico.Because of the effect of the injection, God only knows how I answered thequestions. The shot also affected my vision, as I could not clearly see thefaces of the individuals who wee interrogating me. On the day I was released from the base hospital (approximately three monthslater), I was told to report in uniform to the base commander's office. Underescort, I entered a room and was faced by a colonel seated behind a desk.After I saluted him, he returned the salute, rose to his feet, handed me amanila envelope and said, 'this is your general discharge. As of this datestamped thereon (March 7, 1955), you are no longer a member of the UnitedStates Air Force.' I stood there with my mouth open and asked why. the Colonel replied, 'Youwere told not to reveal any information about the incident in the desert.However, against orders, you did reveal details about the incident to yoursergeant. Thank God, for your sake, you revealed this information to anothermember of the Air Force. Had you spoken to a civilian, you would have beenfined and sentenced to prison.' I protested and explained that my sergeant had accused me of going AWOL!The Colonel interrupted and said, 'You are dismissed!' We saluted and that was the end of my Air Force career - but not the end ofmy torment.'\" Continued in Part 3 - KA's Nightmares After USAF Discharge and Case A-3Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
