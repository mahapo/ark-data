Stringfield: \"ABSTRACT 13 Mrs. SI called me August 3, 1977, to relate her growing interest in the UFO. She hadread my book, Situation Red, and expressed a desire to attend the future meetings ofthe local OUFOIL research group. To its director, Charles Wilhelm, she confidedthat her husband, Carl, while in the U. S. Air Force as a member of the Air Police atWright-Patterson, was called to duty one night to stand guard in a secret area wherehe witnessed three dead alien bodies that had just arrived. I was tipped off about thisinformation by Wilhelm. So, on August 3, 1977, I was prepared to ask some carefulquestions. During our first chat, I was able to extract some strong data. She explained that shebelieved that it was the year 1973 when Carl was called to duty during the night. hewas driven to a certain location, then was blindfolded. She said he recalled that hewas led across a field of wet grass, then was helped down a flight of stairs andescorted through a long corridor. At a certain point, he was halted and his blindfoldremoved. There, he was issued instructions about his mission and where to standguard. To his shock, he was in a room with other ranking officers and a fewscientists who were viewing three small humanoid bodies. The aliens were dead andwere stretched out on a refrigerated table. She remembers Carl telling her that thebodies were about three feet tall, their heads were abnormally large, and theyseemed to have a short fuzz on the top of their heads. The skin, she said, was anoff-white or cream. She could recall no other facial features described by Carl,admitting that the only time Carl had talked about his experience was while theywere courting. That was in 1975. At that time, she said, he seemed shaken by it. 'I believe he was dramatically effected,' she said, adding, 'One time he told his sisterabout it and she just laughed. Since then, he refuses to discuss the matter withanyone, even me.' On several later occasions when I called Mrs. SI, I asked to speak to Carl. One nighthe was present, sitting at a table drinking coffee, when I called. I remember sheasked him if he would be willing to talk with me about his experience, but hedeclined. Said SI when she returned to the phone, 'He said he's not allowed to talkabout it, and that he will tell everything he knows after President Carter makes anannouncement.' "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"In the Fall of 1977, Mrs. SI became so obsessed in her UFO pursuits that she becameill, followed by a long period when she did not communicate. Then one evening, shecalled and politely announced that she had abandoned her interest in UFOs. Shethanked me for my offers to help during her period of stress and again reminded methat Carl would not talk about his affair at Wright-Patterson. COMMENT: No one can blame Carl for upholding his sworn oath to secrecy. i believe that theinformation recounted by his wife is accurate. The year, 1973, when the incidentoccurred, was confirmed by an Intelligence source, but no details were given. ABSTRACT 14 On April 7, 1978, Steve Tom, NBC radio newsman in Chicago, and I were linked upby phone for an interview with a former Air Force Intelligence Officer, Major J. M.residing in Houma, Louisiana. Major J. M., I learned, shared some common groundswith me. He had also served in the 5th Air Force in the Pacific Theater during WorldWar II, and had been in several combat areas such as Leyte, Philippine Island,where I had been assigned. The purpose of our call was to obtain firsthand, the Major's role in the retrieval of analleged crashed UFO northwest of Roswell, New Mexico, in the Summer of 1947. The debris of an apparent metallic aerial device, or craft, that had exploded in theair, or crashed, was first made known by a sheep rancher who found fragments ofmetal and other material on his 8000 acre property. When he informed the Air Forcebase in Roswell of his discovery, Major J. M. and aides were dispatched to the areafor investigation. There, he found many metal fragments and what appeared to be'parchment' strewn in a one mile square area. 'The metal fragments,' said the Major,'varied in size up to six inches in length, but were of the thickness of tinfoil. Thefragments were unusual,' he continued, 'because they were of great strength. Theycould not be bent or broken, no matter what pressure was applied by hand.' The area was thoroughly checked, he said, but no fresh impact depressions in thesand were found. The area was not radioactive. The fragments, he added, weretransported by military carry-all to the Air Base in Roswell and from that point hewas instructed by General Ramey to deliver the 'hardware' to Ft. Worth, to beforwarded to Wright-Patterson Field for analysis. When the press learned of this retrieval operation and wanted a story, Major J. M.stated, 'To get them off my back, I told them we were recovering a downed weatherballoon.' When the Major was asked for his opinion as to the identification of the fragments,he was certain they were not from a balloon, aircraft or rocket. He said that becauseof his technical background, he was certain that the metal and 'parchment' were nota part of any military aerial device known at that time. COMMENT: The retrieval of 'unusual' fragments in secrecy suggests they were a part of anunknown aerial device or craft. Manned, or not, the Major did not know. If therewere entities aboard, no evidence was found. Had there been any bodies aboard,they would have been destroyed in what appeared to be an aerial explosion. It is significant to note in this instance the year 1947 - the year of the first greatwave of UFO reports. Also, the area of this retrieval was in the path of some of thegreen fireball phenomena observed from 1947 to 1948. ABSTRACT 15 Following my lecture on April 6, 1978, before the Cincinnati Chapter of WorldWings Association, a gathering of 50 or more pilots, I was approached by a highlyreputable member of the association who knew of a 'person at work' who, in turn,knew about crashed UFOs and occupants. I promptly got in touch. On April 18, 1978, I talked with former Air Force Sergeant M. S. of the 97thBomber Wing. He was prepared to relate the data from a high Intelligence sourcerelative to the retrieval of an alien craft and humanoid occupants maintained atWright-Patterson AFB. He also related a sobering story about a landing on an AirForce base, also from the same high source."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" M. S., while serving at Wright-Patterson in 1977, made close acquaintance with aMajor General whose last name begins with the letter 'T,' who was assigned atWright-Patterson for top security work in the Logistics Command. His rank and thenature of his work entitled him to a plane at his disposal at all times. The General's daughter, (name known to me) and M. S. were seriously lovelorn, andon that basis were frequently together. This allowed M. S. to be the guest at theGeneral's home where he and the General had private chats. Both being endowedwith the highest security ratings, they discussed UFOs. From General 'T,' my informant related details that were disclosed concerning aUFO that had crashed in the southwest region of the United States in 1957. At thattime, General 'T,' was Lt. Colonel 'T.' According to the General, radar had confirmedthat an alien craft had crossed the skies over the United States at great speed. It wastracked to the point of its crash. The area, as in most cases, was 'roped off,' and theNational Guard summoned (with canines) for maximum security. From the damaged craft, four humanoid bodies were recovered with great difficultybecause of the inability to penetrate the craft's metal structure. The deceased bodieswere found badly burned, some parts so severely that certain features wereindistinguishable. However, the suits they wore - appearing silver - were notdamaged by the obvious intense heat endured inside the craft. Said the General, 'Thesuits were fused to the flesh.' M. S. said, according to the General, the four bodies were approximately 5 feet inheight and were sent to Wright-Patterson AFB where General 'T' had seen them in adeep freeze morgue, kept at approximately 120 degrees below zero for preservation. The only other anatomical feature described by General 'T' was that the heads of thealiens were, by human standards, larger proportionately than the bodies. Facialfeatures were erased by the heat factor. The craft? The General related that scientists assigned to the task of dismantling itran into difficulty. To get inside, they concentrated in an area where a fissure orcrack had resulted, probably from impact. Shipment (of the UFO) to Wright-Patterson, said the General, 'was by rail, using two military conveyance rocket cars,properly camouflaged and classified as 'rockets.' On another occasion, M. S. was a guest of General 'T' at his home. While alone, M.S. was shown a top Secret document concerning a landed UFO. The incidentoccurred at Nellis AFB, Nevada, in 1968, and M. S. expressed disbelief when heread the report. Stamped TOP SECRET, it read in part: 'Large UFO hovered overNellis AFB for three days. Three small alien craft were observed separating (orbeing ejected) from parent craft. One landed on the Air Base grounds. Sent to greetthe landed craft was a Colonel with security detachment properly armed. There wasno mention of an attempt to assault the craft. While waiting for a sign of intent, ahumanoid was observed to disembark from the UFO craft, which was described as'short and stocky.' Then a beam of light was directed at the Colonel. The Colonelwas instantly paralyzed, according to the report. Orders then came from the officernext in command for his troops of the security detachment to fire, but their weaponswere mysteriously jammed. The Colonel was recovered and hospitalized. The onlyrecall by the Colonel, as M. S. remembers from the report, was that he couldrationalize the event only in terms of mathematics as though an attempt atcommunications was conducted in this manner. The UFO was observed to retreat toits parent craft and then departed. COMMENT: I made a check on General 'T' at Wright-Patterson. They had no entry on his secretassignment there. However, a check at another Air Base through the Accountingand Finance Section confirmed his existence. No address was released on grounds ofPrivacy Act. However, M. S. knows where the General was to make his residenceafter retirement. Making a further check on the authenticity of the General and his knowledge ofsecret UFO reports, I checked with another Intelligence source and obtainedadditional corroborative information concerning the Nellis AFB incident. ABSTRACT 16 'Your book, Situation Red, The UFO Siege, really did it,' said AK, calling me from"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"California on June 19, 1978. 'It convinced me that I should tell my story to youabout a UFO that landed, or had maybe crashed, at Ft. Riley, Kansas.' Needless to say, i was receptive to hear AK's story. He, of course, asked to keep hisname confidential because he recalled a General's warning, who was on the scene ofthe landing, that he would have his 'expletives' shot off if he talked. The incident occurred on a crisp, cold night on December 10, 1964. At 2:00 a.m.,AK, a PFC on guard duty at the Motor Pool, and three other Army personnel of the1st Division on regular guard duty, were summoned by the Officer of the Day, Lt.H., to join him by vehicle to a remote area on the base described as a training area inCamp Forsyte, which is part of the Ft. Riley complex. On departure to this area, hewas issued an extra clip for his M14 rifle. 'I was scared,' admitted AK. 'In fact, I'm trembling right now as I'm telling you this.' Itold AK that I was aware of a number of UFO landings and crashes on or nearmilitary installations and that he could trust me regarding the confidentiality of hisname. After driving a good distance, Lt. H. parked his vehicle alongside the road. He, AKand the other guards, were ordered to hike about a half mile across an open flatfield. Before him, AK watched the searchlight beam from an overhead Hueyhelicopter playing down on the field. It was focused on a large round object restingon the ground. PFC AK and his comrades stood in shock. He remembers that heshouted, 'GOD DAMN, a Flying Saucer!' Already on the scene were about 10 Army personnel of various ranks, including aMajor General. Promptly, AK was asked for his ID and given a direct order by theGeneral to patrol the grounded craft by circling around it and to 'shoot anyone ifthey tried to force their way to the craft.' At this time, PFC AK was sharply admonished about keeping the incident secret.Comments AK, 'When I was in the Army, when a General told you something, youobey!' The lone Huey chopper continuously flew overhead while certain personnel on handchecked the object with instruments and maintained communication by field radiowith head phones. Nearby, a 5-ton truck was parked with lights off. On twooccasions, the Huey chopper flew over parts of the field, said AK, as though lookingfor other evidence. When the Huey was away, a 'deathly quiet' prevailed, he said. 'Itwas eerie!' Said AK on several occasions during his 2.5 hours of guard duty, he got close to themetallic craft. 'The air was much warmer when I got close.' he said. The grounded UFO, said AK, which had impacted into the soil and stood at a tilt,was approximately 35 to 48 feet in diameter and 12 to 18 feet in height. It wasperfectly round, shaped like a hamburger bun. In the middle, or at the equator, of itssmooth aluminum-like surface, was a black band made up of squares, each juttingout about ten inches. AK could not determine if the squares were windows or whatpurpose they served. The only protruding part on the UFO, said AK, was a fin-likedevice and beneath it an aperture which might have been an exhaust unit. Said AK, the UFO was not lighted. He sensed no vibrations from its power systemand smelled no odors. 'It was dead,' he said. Asked about recovery of occupantsfrom the craft, he replied, 'Sorry to disappoint you, but I was not aware of any lifeinside the craft, or if any bodies were taken out of it later.' The next morning, said AK, 'I had a headache, but this was probably caused by theexcitement and fatigue.' AK said he heard from other sources on the Army base that UFOs were sighted inthe area prior to the landing. He recalls no details. AK, on my request, sent me two drawings of the grounded UFO showing rear andfront views. The drawings also show the Huey helicopter hovering over the UFO,which are used as Exhibits A and B below in this report."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"On June 18, 1978, AK drew for Leonard Stringfield the front view above and the rear view be low ofthe Huey helicopterhovering over the \"hamburger-shaped\" UFO at Ft. Riley's Camp Forsyte, Kansas, in December 1964. COMMENT: PFC AK was unable to determine if the UFO had crashed or landed, but from hisobservation of the craft for 2.5 hours, he believed that it had probablymalfunctioned and was immobilized. He was unable to learn more details about theincident from the local military base and too frightened by the General's threats tobring the matter up. With the presence of a helicopter and a large truck, it is mybelief that the craft was hauled away in secrecy and perhaps with it, the occupants. I checked further with an Intelligence source who was 'aware' of this incident. Since my phone conversation with AK, I have received a tape from him recordinghis experience and a signed letter. The tape, Exhibit C, is available for publichearing during the MUFON Symposium.\"ontinued in Part 5 - Nine non-human bodies in Wright-Patterson deep freeze.More Information: See these other Earthfiles reports for more information about Ft.
