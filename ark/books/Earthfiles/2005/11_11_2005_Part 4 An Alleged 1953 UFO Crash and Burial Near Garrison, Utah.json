I prepared a sealed envelope that had only axerox of a June 11, 1953, aerial photograph of the triangle in the DRES lakebed and thelatitude and longitude coordinates of the triangle. (113W 40'29.83\" by 38N 37'). Laterafter the work was completed, the sealed envelope was returned to me unopened, tapedand marked with lines that would have torn if the envelope had been opened.Joe's first remote viewing sketch on October 13, 2005, stunned me. He drew a triangle andindicated the pattern is in a desert location with the point headed toward mountains on thehorizon. That's true.With his sketch, he provided a typed list of impressions:But the dimensions Joe referenced from his remote viewing were \"60 meters (or feet) on aside,\" which is much smaller than the actual measured dimensions of 4,400 feet on a sideand 2,700 feet wide. Why that size discrepancy? No one knows. This is pure speculation,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"but perhaps Joe was picking up on a previous crash in the lakebed of a smaller object thatmight have happened in the 1940s?In answer to the question about what created the lakebed triangle, Joe wrote:Another discrepancy is the timeline. Is the remote viewer picking up on something elsethat happened in the 1940s at the DRES lakebed site? Other remote viewing comments and drawings:"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"More information: Also, see other Earthfiles UFO crash retrieval reports: · 07/29/2005 -- Bentwaters and Rendlesham Forest Mystery Beyond December 1980· 04/14/2005 -- \"Battle of Los Angeles\" On February 25, 1942· 02/13/2005 -- Part 1: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report IV - Fatal Encounter AtFt.
