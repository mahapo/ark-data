Leonard Stringfield: \"PHOTO PHANTASIES In recent years, photographs purporting to show alien spacecraft fail to excite theserious researcher. Good reason: most can be simply explained as conventionalaerial objects - and in the heap, there are some good fakes. The most likely fakes arealso the most dazzling, usually showing a sharply contoured disc or boomerang ormaybe an ellipsoid or a spheroid. Some have domes and windows and otherimposing details. Trick, high-tech photography today can produce an impressiveUFO! But not necessarily faked are most nocturnal photos which usually show a pinheadlight or a luminous blob streaking across the sky. In most cases, the witness -probably a novice with camera - simply cannot identify the light's source in a trickynight sky. Photos which are claimed to depict the alien entity are the worst offenders toresearch. Most are so indistinct, they are worthless. Then there are the oddballphotos that show teasing portions of a weird anatomy of 'something' that might haveits origin tied to P. T. Barnum of circus fame. But, to make the alien photo galleryeven more disreputable, is one known case of a photo taken of a simulated aliendummy at an exhibition, with no intention of deception, that got into the wronghands. It's still being passed around as authentic. Let's review three samples ofspurious spacemen:Photos 1 In Status Report III (1982), Page 47 (to be reprinted at Earthfiles), I published twoquestionable photos showing a strange assembly of bones, including a rib cage,clavicle and one arm in view, bent at the elbow with a claw-like hand. But the photoshows no head. The sender, Mack, stated that the creature was a fossilized specimendiscovered in a bed of shale in Florida and that it was stored secretly in thebasement at the University of Pennsylvnia. According to Mack, there were hints thatit had an alien-human evolutionary connection. Being more curious about Mack as aperson than his anthropological wisdom, I requested a photo showing the head andthe lower portion of the body. Well, a second photo arrived which showed a part of a rod-like, right arm - still nohead. Later, to keep researchers who had seen the first photo informed, I decided topublish both copies, side-by-side, hoping that its embarrassing display would flushout at least an explanation for the missing body parts. But nothing more was heard"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"from Mack. At this point in our 'collaboration,' I am sure looking back that he haddetected my suspicions about his modus operandi. It was in 1988 that a researcher, R. M. Mills of Armonk, New York - who had readmy Status Report III - sent me a copy of a picture of the ribbed cage creature, with ahead and the bottom. He discovered it in the July 1978 special edition of AncientAstronauts, published by Official UFO magazine. Then a second version of the head - slightly different - -came from Christian Page inCanada in May 1991, along with the Carp crash report I had requested. But to myastonishment, both Mills' and Page's renditions revealed the lower portion of thecreature's body - with a mermaid's fishtail! No wonder Mack did not send me themissing head. Thanks to the efficiency of his filing system, Page refreshed my memory by sendingme a duplicate copy of a letter sent to me originally in May 1989 from his friend,Marc Peloquin, a professional photographer in Natick, Massachusetts. It reads inpart:'Of interest to me are the photos on page 47 (Status Report III, 1982) entitled, TheAlien Hand ... I am enclosing a copy of my resume to highlight my eight years as aBiomedical Photographer for the Nobel Prize Laureate, Dr. David Hubel of theDepartment of Neurobiology, Harvard Medical School. It is my responsibility tophotograph various biological specimens related to Dr. Hubel's research. 'Regarding the photos, it is very difficult for me to believe that the artifact is, indeed,a fossil. The bone structure of the limb is nothing familiar to me ... but moresignificant are the lines between the 'rib bones' and the line of the 'elbow.' I amconvinced this is man-made. 'Curiously enough, I recall seeing a display of odd man-made items at Harvard'sPeabody Museum. Some years ago, there was a display of weird and faked itemsonce exhibited by P. T. Barnum. One item called a 'Mermaid,' closely resembles theobject photographed on page 47 ...' For a comparison with the photo published in Status Report III, both the xeroxedcopy of the creature from Official UFO and a photograph received from ChristianPage are reproduced here. What Are These? Mermaids?

Below: Illustration from R. M. Mills in 1988, found in the July 1978 issue of Ancient Astronauts,reveals one version of the 'missing' head and the 'mermaid' tail. Photos 2 The 'missing parts' photo story is strange, but no more so than the rest of the storyabout Mack and his cohort, Jack, both New Englanders. For a capsule review of thisepisode, I must say that I already had a strong suspicion about their melodramaticbehavior when we met in Erie, Pennsylvania, to discuss the super-sensitive, topsecret photos they hoped I might be tempted to use to expose the UFO cover-up. There was a tense moment of silence as Mack opened his briefcase and then, presto,like a magician, he whisked out several black and white, 8 x 10 photos. In front ofme, alas, was photographic evidence of the alien, a cadaver inside a rectangularglass case. Lying prone, with its long arms stretched down to the knee joint, thebody was that of a humanoid, looking almost human. Its muscled arms and legs andportions of the chest and abdomen glared, reflecting the hidden light from above.The head, curiously, was not human or like the big, fetal-shaped kind so oftenassociated with the little grays. Only in the photo, which showed the head closelyenough, were the eyes in view, looking large and cavernous. The nose was just a dotof light and the mouth was just a slit. On the floor of the case, sitting on either sideof the head, were beakers emitting a swirl of vapor and at the base, surrounding thebody, were vents. One hazy photo, out of conformity with the others, showed whatappeared to be a mangled or twisted body inside a glass case of the same model asthe others. Still another photo showed a body obviously retouched. It was alsoobvious that all the photos were several generation reprints - hardly the kind thatany proud secret agency would keep on file. Mack did say that the photos had beenlifted from CIA files. If I played Mack's and Jack's game, I was to be the one to show and tell the world -the indisputable proof of a UFO cover-up. Here it was in a neat package - photos,plus a copy of a Government Memorandum to a federal judge, advising him thatMack was a national security risk facing trial for espionage. The time and place for my shocking announcement was to be at the MUFONSymposium in Houston in June 1980, which I had already planned to attend. If allwent well, which according to their plan, meant that I would have to show the mediathe photos and document and try to get maximum publicity. Then, lo and behold, Iwould be richly rewarded with more alien photos - in color! On the way to Houston in a van with my close research friends, Dick Hall and TomDeuley, I thought long and hard about my dilemma. My choices were agonizinglysimple: go the full nine yard with the hope of getting more information from Mackand Jack about their modus operandi, their sources, their game - and the coloredphotos - or renege and later regret that my own little counter-intelligence ploy mighthave been productive. Summing it up, I told Dick, 'I'll be damned if I do and damned"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"if I don't.' With permission from Walt Andrus, my important announcement led off themorning's program. But I kept only part of the bargain, stating that I had photos inmy possession allegedly showing preserved dead aliens which needed further studybefore making them public. I did not show them to the audience or to the media.(See MUFON UFO Journal, July 1980 issue, Page 15, for text of my statement.) Looking back, I was surprised - not shocked - to learn that a full-page photoshowing an encased alien similar to Mack's appeared in the July issue of a new pulpmagazine named UFO Sightings, Vol. 1, No. 1, published by the Fass Brothers inNew York. Featured was an article by David McCarthy (who is he?) entitled, TheQuestion of Teleportation. The caption under the photo read, 'A prototype of acryogenic freeze chamber. The 'person' inside is actually a mannequin encased in aspecial mylar foil.' The special Vol. 1, No. 1, edition of a new magazine waswell-timed to coincide with my announcement in Houston. But, there was still more to be revealed that might be a shock to the uninitiated UFObuff. Shortly after leaving Houston, John Schuessler, Deputy Director of MUFON,called to inform me that he found in his magazine files a copy of Ancient Astronauts,December 1977 issue, featuring on its cover the picture of a retouched alien underglass - the same photo that Mack had given me from \"CIA\" files. Headlined, 'SecretChamber Beneath the Empire State Building,' the story raved over the discovery ofan alien body underground in cryogenic suspension. The publisher: The FassBrothers. Unless I am suffering from paranoia, it is in my judgment that Mack and Jack andmaybe even the Fass Brothers, who used phony alien photos to back up phonymagazine stories, all might have had undercover ties with the Inner Sanctum whosepurpose, at that time, was to discredit my research into crash/retrievals. The whole story about this photo-based misadventure is too long and too twisted bypersonalities to recount in this report. Pertinent, perhaps, to illustrate Mack'sapparent deep-throated complicity in trying to discredit my work, I think back to thealleged Government Memorandum that was sent to the federal judge who was to tryhim on charges of espionage. Maybe Mack was tried in court and sentenced to jail,as he had admitted to me. Maybe, too - and it's just a thought - that he might havebeen released on the condition that he could atone himself by playing a game ofintrigue with me. Or, maybe he was brainwashed into doing the deed. Or maybe hewas an intelligence agent, and in that event, the government memo was a fake.Another thought: how could he have access to such a secret memo? Whatever itsstatus, the memo was published in Status Report III (See page 40). [To be reprintedby Earthfiles.com.] If, indeed, the 'mermaid' and the encased aliens were used by Mack and Jack withthe intention to snare me into a trap, then their part might have been only onemaneuver of an overall, orchestrated scheme to denigrate my crash/retrieval work. Suddenly and inexplicably after Houston MUFON, I became the target of aconcentrated 'Siege' of vicious attacks, some coming from expected quarters. A fewcame from the unexpected. Even stranger was the coincidental cut-off ofdependable 'insiders' and most of my firsthand sources who had shared theirknowledge or experiences with retrieved UFOs and the remains of alien crews. Itwas unthinkable to me that I could not reach over a dozen contacts by mail who leftno forwarding addresses and could not reach them by phone, which in severalinstanced had been disconnected. I suppose if there is a lesson to be gained from photographic phantasies, I for one -as a researcher - should have been a more faithful reader of all the far-out storieswith pictures published in the sleazy UFO magazines of that period - especially the1977 issue of Ancient Astronauts which showed the retouched photo on its cover.Lessons of the past apply today.\" ontinued in Final Part 28 - Photo 3 and Status Report VI, Inner Sanctum, ends.Soon to follow, Status Report V.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"earthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
