August 24, 2005 Pasadena, California - For twenty months now, the robotic explorer,Spirit, has been exploring the Gusev Crater on Mars, while its twin rover, Opportunity, hasbeen exploring the Meridiana Planum. The two sites are 6,600 miles from each other in theequatorial region.Spirit Photographs Several MartianDust Devils in Gusev CraterNASA reports that Spirit videotaped from a hill \"several dust devils crossing a plain insideMars' Gusev Crater. The clip consists of frames taken by Spirit's navigation camera duringthe rover's 543rd martian day, or sol (July 13, 2005).\"See dust devils in action in NASA video.\"Spirit began seeing dust devil activity around the beginning of Mars' spring season.Activity increased as spring continued, but fell off again for about two weeks during a duststorm. As the dust storm faded away, dust devil activity came back. In the mid-afternoonsas the summer solstice approached, dust devils were a very common occurrence on thefloor of Gusev crater. The early-spring dust devils tended to move southwest-to-northeast,across the dust devil streaks in Gusev seen from orbit. Increasingly as the seasonprogresses, the dust devils are seen moving northwest-to-southeast, in the same directionas the streaks. Scientists are watching for the big dust devils that leave those streaks.\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Opportunity Photographs \"Lemon Rind\"At Meridiani Planum OutcropNASA reports: \"After months spent roving across a sea of rippled sands, Opportunityreached an outcrop in August 2005 and began investigating exposures of sedimentaryrocks, intriguing rind-like features that appear to cap the rocks, and cobbles that dot themartian surface locally. Opportunity spent several sols analyzing a feature called \"LemonRind,\" a thin surface layer covering portions of outcrop rocks poking through the sandnorth of \"Erebus Crater.\" In images from the panoramic camera, Lemon Rind appearsslightly different in color than surrounding rocks. It also appears to be slightly moreresistant to wind erosion than the outcrop's interior. To obtain information on how thissurface layer (or weathering rind) may have formed and how it compares to previouslyanalyzed outcrops, Opportunity is using the microscopic imager, alpha particle X-rayspectrometer and Moessbauer spectrometer to analyze surfaces that have been brushedand ground with the rock abrasion tool. Scientists will compare these measurements withsimilar measurements made on the underlying rock material.\"\"Lemon Rind\" surface layers of different colored and more erosion-resistant sedimentary rocksdiscovered in August 2005 atop the Martian surface where the Opportunity rover is currently exploring in theMeridiani Planum on the Martian equator 6,600 miles from its brother rover, Spirit. Image credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell.\"This is a false-color composite generated by draping enhanced red-green-blue color fromthe panoramic camera's 753-nanometer, 535-nanometer and 482-nanometer filters over ahigh-fidelity violet, 432-nanometer-filter image. The image was acquired on martian day,or sol 552 (Aug. 13, 2005) around 11:55 a.m. local true solar time. In this representation,bright sulfur-bearing sedimentary rocks appear light tan to brown, depending on theirdegree of dust contamination, and small dark \"blueberries\" and other much less dusty rockfragments appear as different shades of blue. Draping the color derived from the blue tonear-infrared filters over the violet filter image results in a false color view with thesharpest color and morphology contrasts.\"More Information:For other Earthfiles reports about rover explorations on Mars, see Earthfiles Archives:· 03/26/2005 -- Spirit Rover Finds Magnesium Sulfate Near \"Larry's Lookout\" inColumbia Hills on Mars.· 03/20/2005 -- Astronaut John Young: \"The Moon Can Save Earth's Civilization.\"· 04/02/2004 -- Updates on Spirit and Opportunity Rovers· 03/11/2004 -- Updated - Mars Spirit and Opportunity Sol 65 and Sol 46· 03/05/2004 -- Part 3 - Mars: A Sulfate Salty Planet - Could It Have Sulfate-LovingMicrobes?· 03/03/2004 -- Part 1 - Mars: Meridiani Planum Was Once \"Drenched With Waterand Habitable\"· 03/03/2004 -- Part 2 - Mars: Scientific Challenge of Identifying Substances· 02/21/2004 -- Update On Mars with Cornell Astronomer Steve Squyers, MarsRover Missions· 02/18/2004 -- Distorted Distance Perspective in Martian Rover Camera Images· 02/11/2004 -- Opportunity Finds Martian Bedrock Has Lots of Sulfur and SmallSpherical Rocks· 02/03/2004 -- Planet 150 Light Years from Earth Has Oxygen and CarbonAtmosphere· 01/31/2004 -- Is There Living Green Algae in the Gusev Crater on Mars?· 01/31/2004 -- Opportunity Rolls Onto Martian Soil and Confirms Hematite· 01/28/2004 -- Mars - First Bedrock Seen Beyond Earth· 01/09/2004 -- Robotic \"Geologists\" on Mars"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"· 01/28/2004 -- Mars - First Bedrock Seen Beyond EarthWebsite:http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
