Dix-McGuire: A Case Study: Status Report IV\" © 1985 by Leonard H. Stringfield.To be more computer-friendly, the reprint has been divided into parts. Here begins Part 1of Status Report IV, written for the June 28-30, 1985, MUFON 1985 UFO SymposiumProceedings in conjunction with the national MUFON conference held in Saint Louis,Missouri. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H.Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report V begins at Earthfiles 012805.Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. \"ABSTRACTLeonard H. Stringfield: New testimonial evidence and a document are baredin Status Report IV, following the re-emergence in 1983 of the informantwhose experience, as a witness, was first disclosed three years earlier andpublished as Case A3 in Status Report III, 1982. The source, a sergeant in theU. S. Air Force Security Police at McGuire AFB, adds substantive informationrelative to the reported fatal encounter on January 18, 1978, between analleged alien entity and a Ft. Dix MP and relates his firsthand observation,while on duty, when the slain entity was found on an abandoned runway atMcGuire AFB. The source also reveals his sensitive involvement withauthorities in various agencies following his discharge from service because ofhis disclosures to this writer. Also reported are the communications with thesource since 1980 and an arranged meeting between the source and acolleague to lend back-up credibility to the case. Investigation continues. PROLOGUE: THE BURDEN OF PROOF Proof! The burden of this one word, and perhaps its ambiguity, has haunted andfrustrated UFO research since businessman-pilot, Ken Arnold, sighted ninesaucer-like things over Mt. Rainier in 1947. Proof! Its implications burden all of uswho try to convince the skeptic that unidentified objects, flying under apparentintelligent control, have intruded into Earth's air space and sometimes allegedly landand, on rare occasions, crash. All factors considered, I believe we, in the domain of public research, do not havethat exalted proof to exhibit for any of the foregoing anomalous UFO events. As Dr.J. Allen Hynek of CUFOS would say, we do have 'reports' describing such events.And as we all will agree, many are made by credible people. Yes, our researchtreasury has thousands of reports of UFO encounters of all kinds providing stacks of"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"circumstantial, but highly suggestive evidence. Alas, these are not proof. Nor do affidavits, nor 'leaked' government documents, norphotographs constitute proof. Regrettably, experience has taught us that any ofthese so-called proofs might well be fakes. Even a released document through theFreedom of Information Act (FOIAS) is not proof, for the subject it treats too oftencontains precious little of value, due to censored deletions, vague phraseology, orreferences rendered meaningless without additional support data which are nevermade available. So, what is that proof that remains so elusive from public view? According toscientific discipline, proof - in the case of UFOs - -can be reduced simply to thepossession of a captive craft or artifact or a cadaver that can be seen, touched, andsmelled. To please Phil Klass, the world's foremost debunker, we might include even'tasted.' I must, therefore, face the inevitable questions in my special research: Hassuch a nondescript craft been retrieved and studied and, to stretch a point,duplicated at some secret base? And has a crew member of exotic anatomy beensecretly examined and maintained in chemical preservation at some medical facility? In spite of all the known evidence, including the testimony I have published in myseries of monographs, I can offer no proof, by my definition, of the recovery of analien craft or its occupants. So be it for me in the public sector. Then there is the 'official' sector whose military spokespeople from the outset havedenied the existence of the UFO. Why? By now, it should be obvious to everyresearcher that behind the denials, something 'above top secret,' as Senator BarryGoldwater has said, is being hidden. Perhaps it is something big enough to shake upour societal patterns. Whatever we might think of its implications for mankind, we do know that muchinformation has been bared since World War II by credible military sources aboutUFO intercept missions, aircraft losses, visual sightings confirmed by radar and, yes,UFO landings on military installations and a crash - among several - one dating backto 1947. On the other hand, if all UFOs have simple explanations as the U.S. AirForce contends (and as a Wright-Patterson AFB spokesman once commented: 'Weare hiding nothing.') - then why enforce such high degree of secrecy to hide nothing? Logically, we might ask: What is it that must be hidden at all costs? Is it alienhardware? Alien cadavers? If so, why not tell the world? Why the long, agonizingsecrecy? Here again, we can only guess, but a likely one is that to face the media ofthe world, they had better have answers for the UFOs' origin and intent. Withoutanswers after so many years, the credibility gap of our Government and its scientificadvisers would greatly suffer. Without answers, the experts in the military, the CIA,the NSA, NRO and NASA, who help form policy, will continue their secret probesin silence. It seems fair to say that we all have our proof problems. I would like to be assured that governments worldwide, including Russia, andespecially our own National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) are working on theseproblems. In good faith, I address these problems with new evidence for Case A3,published in Status Report III, UFO Crash Retrievals: Amassing The Evidence(1982). THE EVIDENCE AND ITS BURDEN OF PROOF September 23, 1980, was to become more than just a typically busy day for me inUFO matters. According to my UFOLOG, I note that I had communications byphone and mail with Joe Brill, Michael Dougan, Bob Gribble, Diane Saghe, and ajournalist in Japan. There was also an envelope with an APO San Francisco returnaddress. Of interest, of course, was Gribble's call concerning a new source, a trucker whoreported that he had transported something secret for the military from Aztec, NewMexico, in the late 1940s, and a response to a letter I had sent to Saghe seekinginformation from a source she knew who had seen a captured saucer at a Texasairbase. But, standing out above all else, was the letter, APO San Francisco, datedSeptember 16, 1980. It was typed in proper military format on stationery withofficial letterhead. See Figure 1 below. Note that I have deleted the Security PoliceSquadron number. The name of the sender has been changed to 'Jeffrey Morse' inthis Status IV report."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Figure 1: U. S. Department of the Air Force Security Policeman's letter to Len Stringfield,dated September 16, 1980, San Francisco APO postmark. McGuire AFB and Fort Dix Military Reservation near Wrightstown, New Jersey, are near the U. S.Naval Air Stationin Lakehurst, New Jersey. The bases are about 45 miles east of Philadelphia, 50 miles south of NewYork City,60 miles north of Atlantic City and 10 miles west of the Atlantic ocean. The Fort Dix / McGuireAir Force Base / Lakehurst Naval Air Station complex covers 42,000 acres.Needless to say, I was stunned by the sergeant's bold disclosure of a militaryincident of fatal consequences at McGuire AFB, New Jersey. My first reaction wasthat it was a hoax, perhaps designed - if it were published - to embarrass or discreditmy probes into UFO crash/retrievals. Still fresh in mind was another episode in 1980involving questionable photographs received from a source under clandestinearrangements requiring my travel to another state. In this case, although my initialrole was to have the photographs studied and authenticated, I made the mistake ofannouncing their acquisition at the 1980 MUFON symposium in Houston. Thanks toa swift and well-orchestrated smear campaign, researchers by and large becameconfused and questioned both the photographs and my credibility. A hoax? Astratagem to set me up? Probably, but a lesson was learned. (Note 1: See StatusReport III, 1982, pages 40-41; also articles published in MUFON UFO Journal,Dec. 1980 and Sept. 1981.) During this fragile period, being suspicious of any stranger with information to offer,I read Morse's letter over and over, and in between the lines, looking for anythingdetectably wrong. But I could find nothing wrong. The letterhead was real, themilitary format was correct, the writer told his story as fact without emotionalembellishment. Maybe, I reasoned, it was the sobriety of the official letterhead thatmade the story itself seem out of place with the real world. Like so many otherstories of UFO close encounters, it sounded like borderline fantasy. Other cases alsoinvolved the military, such as the British Rendlesham Forest Case. (Note 2: Alsoknown as the Bentwaters Case, site of U. S. air base in the Rendlesham Forest. SeeSky Crash by British authors Brenda Butler, Dot Street and Jenny Randles © 1984,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"published by Neville Spearman, U. K. I must, however, note that these authors are inerror on page 213 where they state: 'Stringfield was too scared to travel to theconference [at Univ. of Nebraska, Nov. 1983, where my paper UFO C/R Updatewas read by Ray Boeche.] He (Stringfield) believed he was in danger following hisresearch.' Not true. There was no basis whatsoever for being scared. My reasonsimply was that I had no important information in my brief report that warranted mypresence or the expense of travel.) Time will tell, I assured myself. Soon, Sgt. Morse would return home and if he hadsomething of substance to back his claims, it would be the big breakthrough. I wasdetermined to see this one case through, disregarding time, energy and cost. Provingit, however, would be a monumental burden. To better understand the incident and its ramifications, some of which later followedmy source into civilian life, I believe it is essential to report verbatim most of myearly exchanges of communications with him (USAF Security Policeman). Thiscovers a span of time from Morse's initial letter in 1980 into a period of apparentmail interference and then through his long interval of silence into his re-emergencein 1983. As advised in Morse's overseas letter, my reply of September 27, 1980, was mailedto his home address. In the main, it was a message to establish a rapport of trustbetween us, one in which he could feel comfortable in sharing the burden of hisexperience and to allay any anxieties he might have had about my researchbackground. My questions were few and simple. One, for instance, asked for moredescriptive detail of the recovered body. Another asked how the body was removedfrom the scene and by whom. Still another, if he could reveal any names of thepersonnel assigned to the area. I ended my letter with this thought: 'Hope to hearfrom you soon and will follow your mailing instructions. Your letter will remainconfidential at this time and, of course, your name will not be used in anyway.' Sgt. Morse, who was to be discharged and back home in November 1980, did notacknowledge my letter. Considering the time lapse as critical, I sent another letter onNovember 18, 1980, quoted in part here: Stringfield letter excerpts dated November 18, 1980: '...Hope by nowyou're out of the service as you indicated in your letter from APO address....On September 27, I sent you a letter concerning my research endeavorswhich I trust you received at your home address. The incident you describe is,indeed, of interest to me and I hope you may find time soon to reach me byletter or phone, or, perhaps, to meet me at your convenience. You arecertainly welcome to visit my home. ...I tried reaching you by phone lastweek, but your number is unlisted. ...' Morse's reply to Stringfield dated November 27, 1980: 'Sorry to have hadsuch a delay in my response to you. I'm sorry to say I did not receive yourletter of 27 September 1980. I haven't received any mail since August 1980. Idon't know why. I am now out of the service and am home. I am prepared toanswer your questions. I believe, however, I told you everything I know, butI'm not sure it was much to go on. But, I hope it leads you to someone whoknows more about it. I'm sorry I can't recall too many names. The desksergeant that night was Sgt. C (last name only) and he would know much moreas fact. That's all I know of his name, however, I do remember that he wasrather dedicated and may still be in the USAF. Well, I would like your nextresponse ASAP and will try to give you my phone number by then.'Stringfield memorandum to Morse dated December 4, 1980: 'Your letter ofNovember 27, arrived yesterday. I was surprised to learn that my letter ofSeptember 27 did not reach you. Fortunately, I kept a xeroxed copy which Ihave duplicated and enclosed for your consideration. Hope you can send meyour phone number. Enclosed is a gratis copy of my recently published StatusReport II, [to be reprinted in future Earthfiles] which shows the scope of myresearch.' Again for unknown reasons, Morse did not answer. Considering his expressedinterest in my research and even allowing for other personal diversions, I thoughtthat 2 1/2 months were enough time for him to respond. On February 16, 1981, Iwrote again, expressing my concern and asked for a prompt reply as evidence of hissincerity. No answer. Had it not been for Morse's brief letter of November 27, in which he asked for me torespond 'ASAP,' I would have dismissed his disclosure of the incident asquestionable. But something was amiss. Or was the mail sent to his home being lost"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"through negligence? Or lifted t his post office by directive to the Postmaster fromone of the intelligence agencies? Whatever the method used to silence JeffreyMorse, I reasoned, it was effective. All communications ceased.
