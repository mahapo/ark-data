March 11, 2005 Science and Nature Section \"Hobbit's habits under microscope EVIDENCE is mounting that the Hobbit is a new human species and oneof the most significant finds in the past 100 years. But just who the littlehominid was and what she got up to remains unclear and contentious.Many questions await further exploration and study:Were the Hobbits direct descendants of an ancient human called Homo erectusor an even a more distant ancestor called Australopithecus who lived in Africaabout 3 million years ago? Or was the Hobbit - as a small group of critics claim- not a member of a unique human group at all, but a modern pygmy with agenetic deformity known as microcephaly?\" March 11, 2005 Tallahassee, Florida - Today The Australian newspaper headlined theabove article about the controversy surrounding the September 2004 discovery on theIndonesian island of Flores of a complete skull, a nearly complete skeleton and otherbones from eight individuals nicknamed \"Hobbit\" after A. J. Tolkien's famous trilogy aboutthe mythological saga of small people. In the same Australian edition, there is anotherarticle about the Hobbit skeleton \"damaged\" by a prominent Indonesia paleoanthropologistnamed Teuku Jacob of Gadjah Mada University in Yogjakarta. 79-year-old Jacob hasargued with archaeologist Mike Morwood of the University of New England in Armidale,NSW, Australia, that the 8,000-year-old bones - or 12,000 year old bones - or 18,000-year-old bones (depending on varying Mass spectrometry reports) are not a new species ofhominids, but are the remains of individuals who suffered from the genetic malady of smallbrain known as microcephaly. The young ages mean that H. floresiensis was alive longafter the last Neanderthals are thought to have gone extinct in Europe and western Asiaabout 28,000 years ago. In a formal letter, Dr. Morwood has accused Dr. Jacob of engaging in \"totallyunprofessional\" behavior in handling the skeletal remains and Dr. Jacob denies theaccusation. The implication is that Dr. Jacob might have deliberately damaged the physical"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"evidence because of his bias that the sensational skeletal discovery is not a breakthroughchallenge to traditional evolutionary theory. Further, Dr. Morwood and his colleague, Dr. Peter Brown, are reporting another discoveryon Flores Island of stone tools linked to big game hunting and use of fire and cookingdating back to 840,000 years. Also this week, in the respected journal Science's electronic web publication,Sciencexpress, is a detailed report from Dean Falk, Ph.D., Hale G. Smith Prof. ofAnthropology and Chair, Department of Anthropology, Florida State University inTallahassee, Florida, about her examination of the impressions left inside the Hobbit skulland endocast comparisons to Homo erectus, Australopthecus africanus, Paranthropusaethioppicus, a Homo sapiens pygmy and a human microcephalic. Dr. Falk told me thisweek, \"What we determined is that the Hobbit, or LB1, brain was unique. It looks unlikeanything else, but it was not pathological.

Smith Prof. of Anthropology and Chair, Department ofAnthropology, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida.: \"What triggered mywork is that one of my specialties is studying brain evolution. I've spent a number of yearsstudying our relatives or fossil ancestors which can be done by taking impressions of thebrain case. The main point of the work was to ask the question: what was the brain of a\"Hobbit\" like? There was also the issue of whether or not it might be a pathologicalindividual suffering from microcephaly. That was one of the things we also addressed.WHAT IS IT YOU FOUND THAT REINFORCED THAT THE LB1, OR HOBBIT,SPECIMENS ARE SOMETHING QUITE UNIQUE?When an animal is alive, its brain leaves impressions within the brain case. After it dies,one can make a cast of the interior of the brain case and that cast, which is called anendocast, will reflect the external form of the brain. It will actually have the shape of thebrain and reproduce details of blood vessels and where the sutures of the skull bonesclosed. And if you are lucky, details about convolutions about the outside part of the brain,the cerebral cortex.So what we did was study endocasts. Doing that, we wanted to know if the little 'Hobbit' -as it has been nicknamed - if its brain looked anything like those of other relatives of ours?Or if it looks like brains of living people? Or living chimpanzees? So we compared it to avariety of other endocasts.What we determined is that the Hobbit, or LB1, brain was unique. It looks unlike anythingelse, but it was not pathological. It had some special features which are very advanced thatwe see in humans and it had some primitive features that we see in other ancestors. So,there was nothing about it that indicated that it was a pathological specimen only that it isunique and unlike anything I had ever seen before.THAT'S WHY IT WOULD FALL INTO THE CATEGORY OF BEING ITS OWNSP ECIE S?Yes. We found that the endocast has a shape that is nearest that of Homo erectus. It's notexactly like Homo erectus, but overall, it looks more like the brain shape of Homo erectusthan any other specimen that we compared it with. LB1 Hobbit - Physical CharacteristicsCAN YOU DESCRIBE THE 'HOBBIT' WHAT IT WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE INITS FULL STANDING POSITION AS THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT SOFAR FROM THE BONES?It was short. This particular skeleton was from an adult female and she was very short, alittle over a meter tall (39.37 inches). So not much taller than 3 feet. She had relativelylong arms. Some of the bones such as those in the pelvis are not shaped exactly like ours.But there is enough of the skeleton to tell that she did walk on two legs. So, she wasbi-pedal. Her skull has features that resemble other earlier relatives, some of which livedmillions of years ago. But it also has features of modern people. So, it's a combination offeatures in the skull.WHY ARE YOU ARE CONVINCED THE HOBBIT BRAIN WAS VERY MUCHCLOSER TO HOMO ERECTUS?Yes, if you look at the paper, there are figures in there Figure 1 of the Scientific Expressarticle shows you a couple of views of the Hobbit endocast at the center. You see a topview and one of the side views. It's compared to a representative endocast for an adulthuman female (Hs), a female chimpanzee (Pt), an adult female Homo erectus (He), and amicrocephalic (mcHs). LB Hobbit Compared to Microcephalic Brain And Others"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"A) above: Dorsal view comparisons of virtual endocasts of LB1 in centerwith Hs, Homo sapiens female; Pt, Pan troglodytes chimpanzee; mc Hs, a human microcephalic; He, Homoerectus.B) below: Right lateral views of virtual endocasts of LB1 in center.From Sciencexpress paper, March 3, 2005, © 2005 by Dean Falk, Ph.D., et al.In overall contours and shape, it very much looks but not completely looks like Homoerectus and that's a distinctive shape. We also did major component analysis. We didstatistical studies in order to quantify observations and that verified what your eyes cansee. So, it's an overall shape feature, some of which are derived and specialized and mostresemble Homo erectus. But there are differences. It does not look exactly like Homoerectus. In fact, the Hobbit has some features that are fancier, or more specialized than inHomo erectus. So, in some ways, it's more advanced. But in some ways, it's more primitive much smaller than Homo erectus. There is a shape feature at the very back end where it'snot as derived and specialized as Homo erectus.So, although in overall form, the Hobbit looks most like Homo erectus, it is its owncreature with a suite of some primitive characteristics and some startling advancedcharacteristics which make it clear: this is its own creature and it was wired differentlythan other hominids whose endocasts we have studied. [Editor's Note: The Hominids(Hominidae) are a biological family which includes human. Any living or extinct memberof the family Hominidae whose members can interbreed species of humanlike creaturesand the other great apes: chimpanzee, bonobo, and gorilla.]Microcephalic CharacteristicsIn terms of microcephaly, one of the things that my team did was to acquire a skull from atrue microcephalic, or a primary microcephalic. This is a condition that is understoodgenetically fairly well and it's associated with a suite of diagnostic cranial features. This istrue around the world. With true microcephalics, they have brain cases that are very tinycompared to the size of the face. Their foreheads are very narrow and slope sharply back.And the top of the head is somewhat pointed. That's the signature shape of themicrocephalic skull.We found a true microcephalic skull and prepared from it an endocast and compared itsshape to the endocast of LB1 and they are totally different. So, even though we are notpretending to do a full study of microcephaly, we are confident that LB1 is not a truemicrocephalic. Other works have said, 'Well, maybe she was a secondary microcephalic.'That's a little harder to address because the term 'secondary microcephaly' is a catch-allterm as much as the terms cancer and autism are. It's not associated with a definitive suiteof cranial characteristics. Rather, the one definition is that secondary microcephaly if youtake the circumference of the head, it is very small. In fact, it is less than two standarddeviations below the mean for that sex for that population. That would be the definition ofsecondary microcephaly.Well, for LB1, we don't have a population of skulls with which to test that hypothesis. It'snot our hypothesis either because there are other reasons we do not believe that LB1 is a"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"microcephalic. For one thing, she is part of a bigger population. There are remains of atleast eight individuals. So, we say to these people who are saying, 'It's secondarymicrocephalic' the burden of proof is on them to test their hypothesis. The way they shoulddo that is to find a microcephalic in a neighboring population and they have said they thinkthey exist. Image that individual and compare its brain shape to that of Hobbit. What Is Relationship of LB1 Hobbitto Other Hominid Evolution on Earth?IN RELATIONSHIP TO EVOLUTIONARY THEORY OF HOMO SAPIENS SAPIENS ONTHE PLANET, WHAT IS YOUR OWN THINKING ABOUT THIS SPECIES HOW ITCAME TO BE?I started out skeptical. When I first read the reports, I really thought based on a lot of workon endocasts that what we would see was a little brain that would look like other primatebrains its size; namely, like chimpanzees.It turns out I was wrong. I grew to very much respect the initial reports that appeared inNature of Mike Morwood and Peter Brown and their colleagues in Australia andIndonesia. I think they've got it right. This brain is so unique and advanced in some waysthat I believe they have correctly placed it in the genus Homo, and yet it does not lookexactly like anything else. So, I think it is properly put in a new species, Homo floresiensis.Now, they suggested two possibilities:1) That this is a direct descendant of bigger-bodied Homo erectus, and it had becomeminiaturized in an island setting, as often happens. It's called insular dwarfing and this is away populations can continue to exist in the case of limited food supply.2) Peter Brown also suggested a second possible hypothesis: if it was not due to insulardwarfing, perhaps the 'Hobbits' were descended from some unknown small-bodiedancestor.What our team concluded is that we need to consider not just the first hypothesis, but alsowe need to take a really hard look at the second hypothesis. If that turned out to be true, itwould suggest that both Homo erectus and the Hobbit were descended from a commonancestor who would have been small-bodied. Those individuals would have gottenthemselves onto the Island of Flores who knows how long ago where they would havehappily thrived and gone in their own evolutionary direction. So, we hold that out as asecond possibility. 840,000-Year-Old Stone Tools on Flores IslandStone tools found near excavated Hobbit skeletal bones on Flores Island,Indonesia. Photograph © 2005 by Michael Morwood.More work is needed. I know Prof. Morwood is out there hunting for more individuals andthat on the Island of Flores, they found stone tools that are over 800,000 years old(840,000). Now, what they need is to find the bodies that go with those tools. The questionis: will those bodies be big like Homo erectus? Or will they be small like Homofloresiensis? They don't know the answer. They are open to either and I think it's going tobe really exciting to learn which is true.In any event, what we learned from this is that around 18,000 years ago contrary to whatwe all thought there was not only one species of human on the planet, Homo sapiens. Wehave at least one other, Homo floresiensis.I HEARD THE SCIENTISTS IN THEIR FIRST RADIO INTERVIEW RIGHT AFTERTHE PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT IIN WHICH ONE SAID SOME OF THE HOBBITBONES DATED AS RECENTLY AS 8,000 YEARS AGO."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The earliest date I have is 12,000 years ago, when they might have died out because ofvolcanic activity. So you might have more recent information than I do. In any event, if itis 8,000 or 12,000 years ago, either way it is incredibly recent when you look at the wholegeological record.There are other hominids at that time and even older. And in Java, you have them then andyou have them nearly at 2 million years old. And Java is not that far away. You havehominids, but the question is: what kind of hominids? That's sort of up for grabs now. Weknow that there were larger Homo erectus specimens in mainland Asia. For instance, up inChina, you have over 400,000 years ago bigger-bodied Homo erectus specimens. We knowthat in the very earliest part of the fossil records many millions of years ago, in Africa, youhave what we call Australopithecines that were very small and had long arms, the same asLucy. She is dated at 3.2 million years ago and she's little just about the same size withlong arms. [Editor's Note: Australopithecine = Any of several extinct humanlike primatesof the genus Australopithecus, known chiefly from Pleistocene fossil remains found insouthern and eastern Africa.]IF THE BRAIN FEATURES IN THE HOBBIT SPECIES ARE CONSISTENT WITHHIGHER COGNITIVE ABILITIES, WOULD THAT THEN LINK TO THE DISCOVERYNOW OF TOOLS ON THE ISLAND THAT GO BACK 840,000 YEARS?That's what everyone wants to know. The archaeologist, Mike Morwood and his team,found advanced tools and signs of big game hunting and use of fire and cooking inassociation with these bones. That means they are roughly in the same place. But you cannever be positive. Some have suggested there were other hominids out there. But theyhave not found those other hominids. So, they have hypothesized the Hobbit was capableof these behaviors.Now, I was skeptical when I began this study. However, having seen the endocasts, I cansay there is nothing in this Hobbit brain to contradict their interpretation. In fact, there aresome features that are consistent with it. But we brain people don't like to be moreadventuresome than that. But I'm receptive now to their hypothesis and I look forward toMike Morwood and hunting in the older part of that island. They had tools at 840,000years ago! They want to see what hominids made those tools and they are hunting forthem. I think they will probably find them and I can't wait to see. Parallel Lives of Homo erectus and Homo floresiensisIS THE BOTTOM LINE THAT NOW IT WOULD APPEAR THERE HAVE BEEN TWOPARALLEL LINES OF INTELLIGENT HOMINIDS ONE THAT BECAMENEANDERTHALS AND CRO-MAGNON, TALL WITH A LARGE BRAIN CAVITY -AND THIS OTHER HOBBIT THAT WAS INTELLIGENT AND A STONE TOOLMAKER, BUT CAME FROM A GENETIC EVOLUTION OF SMALL BEINGS?Yes, we all came from small beings at one point because the first hominids were small. Thequestion is: when do you get branching? And how many branches? But yes, we know thatcertainly by 1.8 million years ago, we know we have not just small beings but we have abeautiful skeleton of a Homo erectus in Africa. And it's tall and proportioned much asmodern people are. So by then, we have at least two forms. But what's not known is whatis the breadth of the radiation there? How many species are there? What is theirrelationship to each other? How exactly do we account for this new discovery? At thispoint, I think all we can do is formulate hypotheses and more data are needed!HOW TALL WAS THE HOMO ERECTUS THAT WAS THE FULL SKELETON?It was the full skeleton of a lad, a boy who might have been 9 to 12 years old, and he wasalready 5 feet 5 inches and projected to grow to an adult height of over 6 feet. His bodyproportions were very modern, much like ours. So he didn't have the long arms. In otherwords, he was not 3 ft. 6 inches tall with long ape-like arms. He was tall and looked likecontemporary people with those body proportions.AS YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THIS AS SOMEONE WHO HAS SPENT YOUR LIFETRYING TO FIGURE OUT SOME OF THESE MYSTERIES OF EVOLUTION ON THEPLANET, HOW DOS THIS NEW HOBBIT DISCOVERY AFFECT YOU MOST?For me, because it was the brain I was looking at, the most startling thing was this itshowed me more than I realized how important not just brain size is and believe me brainsize is important during evolution of various mammals including hominids but it also showsme that the wiring, the internal organization of the brain, can be really important in and ofitself and we can't discount that. We need to give proper weight to that and think of brain"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"evolution as having two possible vectors; the size vector and then the wiring vector.Within those two vectors, we get a range of variation in terms of size and wiring. For me,that's a new kind of lesson.THAT MEANS YOU COULD HAVE A SMALL BRAIN CASING, BUT BECAUSE ITWAS WIRED IN THE WAY YOU HAVE FOUND IN THE HOBBIT BRAIN, THEYCOULD BE VERY SOPHISTICATED?That's a hypothesis we are operating under now, yes. I think Mike Morwood and his teamhave made a major discovery here. But unfortunately through history, there is always asmall group or individual that says, 'No, no, it is not a new species. It's pathological.' Thathappened when Neanderthals were discovered, when Homo erectus was discovered, whenAustralopithecines were discovered. So it's sort of like when discoveries are made, 'It's adirty job and somebody has to do it.' We see that going on even now with the Hobbitcontroversy. What we really need is for people to take a scientific approach and putforward their hypotheses in a way that is testable and then test them.THE HISTORY OF HOMINIDS ON THIS EARTH HAS BEEN QUITE DIFFERENTTHAN WE HAVE SUSPECTED?The field has been very polarized on exactly what that history is anyway. There have beenraging debates about that and those debates will continue. Each side will somehowincorporate these new data into their preconceived ideas and so the debates will rage on.\"Website:http://www.sciencexpress.org.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_evolutionhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/humans/humankind/f.htmlhttp://www.skullsnfossils.com/site/1255489/page/468123Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
