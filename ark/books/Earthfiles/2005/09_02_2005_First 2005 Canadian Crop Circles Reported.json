Large circlewith surrounding outer ring in barley, found August 28, 2005. Circle is said to beabout 18 meters (60 feet) in diameter, with ring about 7.6 meters wide (25 feet). Thetotal diameter is about 49 to 55 meters (160 to 180 feet), based on initial estimates. \"Some multi-directional lay in circle. Counterclockwise lay in ring. Land is gentlyhilly in the field. Barley is still quite green, may not be swathed for a couple ofweeks yet. \"The formation has already been visited by a number of people. No tracksreportedly were seen initially, but there are not quite a few from all the visitors. Theland manager (not owner) is calling it 'vandalism,' so he does not want any publicity.A few people reported cell phone problems inside the formation.\"High River, Alberta, Canada, ringed circle, reported August 28, 2005.

This 2005 circle is near two other simple circles found in 2003.Simple circle reported August 27, 2005, near Steelman, Saskatchewan.Aerial photograph © 2005 by Lois Baillie, CCCRN Saskatchewan.In 2003, Paul Anderson's CCCRN Website reported about two simple circles that werediscovered near Steelman on nearly the same date as the August 27, 2005, circle.\"The second formation of this 2003 year was near the Midale \"hot spot\" region ofSaskatchewan and was another classic simple circle. ...It was first spotted on August25 by pilot and CCCRN field research assistant John Erickson from nearby Estevan. \"On August 25, 2003, a simple single circle, the formation was again close to theedge of a road. The size of the circle was almost exactly the same as the first one,the diameter varying slightly from 16 meters (52 feet) to 16.25 meters (53 feet), withthe mature wheat plants again flattened counterclockwise in an impressive tight, flat"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"spiral pattern. It was like a carbon copy of the first circle in Steelman (this year),although in this case the field had already been harvested. With the plants pressedflat to the ground however, the circle itself was still quite intact and in goodcondition by the time of our investigation. ...While stretched nodes or nodes withexpulsion cavities weren't found, stems with twisting below the seed heads were,similar to other cases in Canada this year at Revenue, Saskatchewan andWallacetown, Ontario and in Canada and other countries in other recent years.\"Second simple wheat circle reported on August 25, 2003, near Steelman, Saskatchewan,Canada, was one of two in same area that year. Now on August 27, 2005, another simple circlewas reported in Steelman. Aerial photograph © 2003 by Paul Anderson. Aneroid, SaskatchewanAugust 14, 2005 - PeasA rancher was harvesting two pea fields on opposite sides of a road on August 14, 2005,when he found a downed circle of plants in each field. The two fields were an eighth of amile apart. The rancher walked off each circle at about 39 feet in diameter. Four dayslater, on August 18, 2005, his brother found one of their best 4-month-old bull calves deadand mutilated. That pasture is about eighteen miles from the pea fields.
