Right: Titan is Saturn's biggest moon andsecond largestmoon in the Solar System (after Jupiter's Ganymede). It is larger than the planets, Mercury and Pluto. Titan hasa thickatmosphere (mostly nitrogen with some methane) and an atmospheric pressure of 1.6 bars (60 percent greaterthan the Earth's). This atmosphere with its heavy clouds obscures the moon's surface. It may rain liquidmethane. The surface temperature is about -178°C = -289°F. Images courtesy NASA/JPL.

Photograph courtesy European Space Agency(ESA).January 21, 2005 Tucson, Arizona - On January 14, 2005, the European Space Agency's(ESA) Huygens probe finally landed on the surface of Saturn's mysterious and cloud-covered moon, Titan. ESA engineers said Huygens is \"the furthest human-made object thathas touched down on an alien world, the only moon in the solar system with a thickatmosphere.\" Titan is Saturn's largest moon of at least 33 moons counted so far and islarger than the planets, Mercury and Pluto. As the Huygens probe fell by parachutethrough the strange moon's atmosphere at speeds ranging from 150 meters per seconddown to 5 meters per second, earth scientists were surprised that the probe kept losingorientation lock on the sun. Later it was decided that the lock problem and whooshingsounds from the probe's microphone were caused by winds on the moon that buffetedHuygens as it descended. That means Titan even has weather.Huygens batteries lasted only a few hours, but it was able to send back to Earth 350images and spectra of the bizarre dark and light surface. That spectrum reached scientistson January 17th. The Deputy Principal Investigator for the Descent Imager SpectralRadiometer (DISR) experiments on the Huygens probe is astronomer, Lyn Doose, in SpaceSciences at the University of Arizona in Tucson. I asked Dr. Doose this week what the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"spectra showed so far.Interview:Lyn Doose, Ph.D., Deputy Principal Investigator, DISR Experiments on the HuygensProbe (Descent Imager Spectral Radiometer), Space Sciences, University of Arizona,Tucson, Arizona: \"It's being analyzed by our French colleagues and they basically see asignature in the spectrum of water ice. So there is definitely water ice on the surface ofTitan. But they also say it looks unlike anything they've seen before. They have a library ofspectral signatures of different molecules, different elements. So, they are busyinterpreting it, but we think it's consistent with a layer of complex hydrocarbons. Thatremains to be confirmed, but that would kind of fit in the picture overall of hydrocarbonsfalling out of the atmosphere of Titan, perhaps collecting on the mountains all over thesurface of Titan.There is also new evidence for weather on Titan. We saw the spin rate of the probeincrease at various times during the descent which it would not have done unless therewere updrafts in the atmosphere. Updrafts imply weather systems. Methane Rain on TitanSo, the picture that is emerging is one of possible infrequent rainfall. Methane rain fallsdown on the surface, washes these hydrocarbons which are constantly falling out of theatmosphere down into the lower regions. That's why we see this stuff collecting in thestream beds and river beds. Some of it gets washed out into the lowest regions and thoseare the areas that look like big, dark lakes. We now think we landed in one of those lakesand it's actually not liquid. But there is evidence from another experiment from the surfacescience package that the lake really consists of an area a couple of inches of hard material.Underneath that, it's much softer and much squishier and circumstantial evidence for liquidunderneath the surface.IS THAT WHY ONE OF THE SCIENTISTS COMPARED IT TO A CREME BRULEETHAT WOULD HAVE A HARD SUGAR CRUST AND VERY SOFT UNDERNEATH?That's exactly right. That's right. It certainly made the news, that analogy certainly madethe news.WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD ONE. I'M CURIOUS IN THIS NEW DATAANALYSIS WHERE THEY ARE SAYING THEY'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKETHIS BEFORE, CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUTWHAT IS SO UNUSUAL?We have these colleagues in France and what they do is make surfaces at very lowtemperatures, Titan-like temperatures. They take spectra of those surfaces in thelaboratory. But usually, they make spectra with just one molecule involved. They'll freezesome methane and make a spectra of that. Or freeze some ethane and there are signaturesin those spectra which we don't see. So, we are thinking that because we don't see thesespecific signatures, maybe we are seeing a combination of many different types ofhydrocarbons. Orange \"Smog\" of Titan Added to Water Makes AminoAcids"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"First color view of Titan's surface covered by \"boulders\" most likely made of frozen methane.The atmosphere of Titan is orange because of aerosols, almost smog-like particles thatform because of the interaction of methane which is unique on Titan compared to anymoon in the solar system. There is no other moon in our solar system that has anatmosphere like Titan does. This methane is hit by sunlight where it's broken apart andthen it recombines with other pieces of methane atoms and forms a substance which CarlSagan called 20 years ago 'tholins.'[Editor's Note: Many experiments have been carried out in order to mimic the chemistry ofTitan's atmosphere, most notably the aerosols analogs named \"tholins\" by Carl Sagan'sgroup. It seems that tholins could be involved in the origin of life. Indeed, hydrolysis ofthese Titan aerosol analogs gives rise to the formation of amino acids, the precursors oflife.]In fact, Carl took some methane, put it in a tube and put sunlight on it for a long time andlo' and behold, it started making this orange material. So, it's basically made ofhydrocarbons and nitriles. Some examples of nitriles are methyl cyanide, ethyl cyanide,propyl cyanide and isopropyl cyanide.[Editor's Note: Nitriles contain a carbon - nitrogen triple bond (R-CºN or R-CN). They areindirectly related to amides (by the loss of H2O from a primary amide), and react similar tocarboxylic acids and their derivatives.They are two different chemical species. They include things like benzene. There are manyother species. Some of them are quite interesting because they are thought to be pre-bioticmolecules. You can actually take some of this \"tholen\" material that Carl Sagan made,drop it in water, and lo and behold, after a short time, you get amino acids which are sortof precursors to life. Could There Be Life on Titan?DOES THAT MEAN THAT ON TITAN RIGHT NOW THAT THE PRECURSORS ARETHERE? OR THAT LIFE OF SOME SORT COULD BE THERE?It's really very cold on Titan. It's a couple of hundred degrees below zero. It's probably toocold for life to really live. So, we talk about Titan as kind of an Earth-like place that gotfrozen in time. I don't think there is life there now, but there are clues perhaps to how lifeformed on the Earth. We also have some evidence that we might be seeing ground fog.This is pretty much speculation at this point.YOU'RE SAYING GROUND FOG?Yeah, ground fog and it would be methane condensed into a cloud that is kind of hangingaround the surface. So, there is this picture emerging of methane gas perhaps leaking outof the surface of Titan.WHY WOULD THERE BE SO MUCH METHANE ON THIS MOON?It's a bit of a mystery. Titan is unlike any other moon in the solar system. It doesn't haveenough gravity to hold an atmosphere. Yet, it has one. That means there has to be areservoir, probably of methane and nitrogen, underneath the surface. We don't know rightnow why that is. What makes it unique?SINCE ON THE EARTH WE HAVE FOUND LIFE AT THE REALLY FAR EXTREMESOF TEMPERATURE, BOTH IN THE VERY COLD AND VERY HOT, IS IT POSSIBLE"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THERE ARE SOME KIND OF LIFE FORMS EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A COLD MOONWITH A LOT OF METHANE IN IT?It would be tough. There is virtually no free oxygen. There is a lot of water there that'sreally frozen hard. Underneath the surface, it gets warmer and it's possible that somethingis happening there. But I would say on the surface, it's unlikely that it's ever warm enoughfor the chemistry of life to get going.AND SO IN A WAY, YOU'RE SAYING THIS IS LIKE A FREEZE-DRIED PLACE,MAYBE SIMILAR TO THE BEGINNING OF OUR EARTH WHERE IF IT DID HAVEWARMTH, IT HAS ALL THE INGREDIENTS TO MAKE AMINO ACIDS AND LIFE?I think so, yeah. The Earth once did not have free oxygen, or at least not much freeoxygen in the atmosphere. When life started or the precursors to life started photosynthesis started up and that started to produce oxygen. That's basically why wehave an oxygen-rich atmosphere today. Methane Drainage Channels and SeasWHAT IS THE ONE THING THAT HAS SURPRISED YOU THE MOST?I think the biggest thing are the drainage channels. We really did not expect to see thingsthat looked like stream beds, river beds. Titan looks completely unlike any other moon inthe solar system. It looks a whole lot like the Earth. There is apparently some kind of liquidthat is either flowing now or flows occasionally or flowed in the past. That's not present onany other moon in the solar system. In fact, no other moon has an atmosphere. Titan is justa very unique place in our solar system.Dark \"channels,\" perhaps draini ng dow n into dark \"methane sea\" at bottom, in image takenfrom about 8 kilometers altitude with a resolution of about 20 meters per pixel shows boundary between high,lighter-colored terrain and and darker lowland area on Titan. This composite was produced from imagesreturnedJanuary 14, 2005, by ESA's Huygens probe. Image source: ESA/NASA/JPL/University of Arizona.WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT LIQUID METHANE?Liquid methane it freezes a little bit below the 93 degrees Kelvin. In fact, there is a placein the atmosphere (of Titan) where the temperature gets to about 70 degrees Kelvin and it'spossible in fact, may be likely that methane is freezing out into cloud particles, or at leastforming into liquid cloud particles somewhere around 18 to 20 kilometers above thesurface.We started taking pictures looking downward trying to see the surface from an altitude ofabout 148 kilometers. For a long time, we saw nothing. Finally, we got down to about 17kilometers, and all of a sudden, everything cleared up and there was the surface. So we fellout of the haze, we fell out of any cloud that was there, and got to see the surface. Thankgoodness!We're not exactly sure where the methane is coming from. It seems to be kind of seepingout of the ground. It would then go up in the atmosphere. Perhaps it would get cold enoughto form droplets, some of which would rain back on Titan, some of which would remainsuspended around this 18-20 kilometers altitude. Above that, we have the photochemicalhaze, the hydrocarbons and nitrile haze.THE RAIN- WHAT WOULD A METHANE RAIN BE LIKE?Certainly very cold. One interesting thing about methane rain is it doesn't really require theformation of a cloud. I believe the droplets can form so fast that basically even without a"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"cloud of methane, you can get methane falling from the sky. It would be kind of an oddthing on Earth if we saw rain and there were no clouds in the sky. What Keeps Titan's Flammable Surface From Catching Fire?IF SOMETHING FIERY FROM OUTER SPACE CAME AND HIT TITAN WITH ALLOF THE METHANE AND OTHER HYDROCARBONS, COULD IT CATCH FIRE?Yes. We could get a big meteorite impact, hits the surface of Titan, melts the ice, makesliquid water, combines with the hydrocarbons. Maybe there are some amino acids on thesurface of Titan, but after a relatively short time I think it would get very cold again andeverything freezes up.COULD THE WHOLE METHANE-SATURATED MOON TURN INTO A FIERYSURFACE?Well, there is no free oxygen. For combustion to occur, there has to be free oxygen. Thereis oxygen tied up as part of water, H2O. But for just O2, oxygen, it's essentially not onTit a n .SO, TITAN SITS OUT THERE A WONDERFUL ENERGY DEPOSIT TO BE USED FORWHO KNOWS WHAT AS WE MOVE OUT INTO THE SOLAR SYSTEM?Yes. Certainly there is plenty of methane on Titan. But the gas giant planets Jupiter,Saturn, Neptune have much more methane in them. If we could find a way to tap that, wecould burn methane. I guess one thing your question is leading to is if we landed on Titan,could we use methane as an energy source. And if we brought some oxygen, we certainlycould.\"More Information:European Space Agency scientists celebrated ton January 14, 2005, after the first rawimages of the Cassini/Huygen space probe sent back the first images of Saturn's moon,Titan, which has been shrouded by thick atmosphere until now.
