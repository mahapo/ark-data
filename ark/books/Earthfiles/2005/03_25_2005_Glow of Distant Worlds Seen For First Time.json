That is really an incredibly profound advance inscience.\" - Alan Ball, Ph.D., Carnegie Institution Infrared detection not currently in image form, so this isartist's version of what the distant worlds might look like in infrared.Artwork courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech/R. Hurt. March 25, 2005 Washington, D. C - NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, launched inAugust 2003, is the largest infrared telescope ever placed in space to orbit the sun. Now,for the first time, the Spitzer Space Telescope has captured the light and heat from twoplanets orbiting very distant stars, one 150 light years away and the other 500 light-years.The findings mark the beginning of a new age for planetary science, in which \"extrasolar\"planets can be directly measured and compared. In order for the Spitzer telescope to seethe heat from such distant planets, the telescope must be cooled to near absolute zero(-459 degrees Fahrenheit or -273 degrees Celsius) so that it can observe infrared signalsfrom space without interference from the telescope's own heat. Also, the telescope must beprotected from our Sun's heat and the infrared radiation put out by the Earth. To do this,Spitzer carries a solar shield and was launched into a special orbit which places Spitzer farenough away from the Earth to allow the telescope to stay cold without having to carrylarge amounts of cryogen coolant. NASA Spitzer Space Telescope, launched on August 25, 2003,is the largest infrared telescope put into space. Like the Earth, it orbits the sun, but with a heat shieldand special orbit that helps keep it near absolute zero temperature so it can \"see\"clearly in infrared. Artist's rendering courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech.Prior to this revolutionary breakthrough, about 130 extrasolar planets had been discoveredindirectly. Until now, astronomers studied intermittent dimming in distant suns presumedto be caused by orbiting planets. Astronomers also have detected wobbles in stars causedby gravitational tugs of orbiting planets. But no planets could be seen.Now, Spitzer has directly observed the warm infrared glows of two previously detectedplanets the size of Jupiter, designated HD 209458b and TrES-1. \"Hot Jupiters\" areextrasolar gas giants that orbit closely around their parent stars. NASA says, \"From theirtoasty orbits, they soak up ample starlight and shine brightly in infrared wavelengths.\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"But from Earth over all those light-years, how can scientists distinguish between the heatof the distant suns and their orbiting planets? I talked about that question with a planetformation theorist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, D. C. Dr. Alan Boss hasworked at the Carnegie Institution for 24 years. Interview: Alan Boss, Ph.D., Research Staff Member in Planet Formation Theory, CarnegieInstitution of Washington, Dept. of Terrestrial Magnetism, Washington, D. C.:\"What's happened is that 2005 is going to go down in the history books as the year inwhich we have our first strong evidence of actually detecting light directly from a planetoutside of our solar system. As of ten years ago, we really had no evidence for planetsoutside our solar system. But in 1995, the first indirect evidence for finding a planetoutside our solar system at least around a sun-like star was developed. In the past tenyears, we've been able to find evidence for roughly 130 or so planets outside of our solarsystem, which is a remarkable advance. But it has still taken ten years to get to the pointwhere we can actually see these planets. In the past, we've been able to infer theirpresence by the affect they have on their host star. But now we're actually able to see thatthe light from the planet, which is distinct from the light of the star, is a major advance.HOW IS THAT ACCOMPLISHED?The measurements were done by the Spitzer Space Telescope which is an infraredwavelength telescope operating in orbit around the sun. What was happening is that theplanet as it goes behind the other star, its own sun, the amount of light emitted by the totalsystem the star plus the planet decreases somewhat. So, when the planet comes back outagain (from behind the star), we see the amount of light come up again which tells us thatwe can actually separate the light of the star from the light of a planet. We can see theoverall system get dimmer when the planet is hidden (behind the star) and we can see itbrighten up again when the planet is revealed. So we can subtract the two amounts of lightand see exactly how much light came from the planet. And that has never been donebefore. Looking for Earth-like PlanetsI think the most amazing thing about what's happened in the last ten years and I think fewpeople appreciate it is that we are on the verge of finding evidence for other Earth-likeplanets in the neighborhood of our galaxy. That is really an incredibly profound advance inscience. If we are actually able to find some planets nearby which look inhabitable or looklike they might even show signs of being inhabited, I think we will have a most significantimpact on all human consciousness to realize that our planet is not unique. There might beother planets out there resembling our own, but perhaps in different states of development.IN ONE OF THE NEWS RELEASES, IT SEEMED TO SUGGEST THAT NOT ONLYLIGHT BUT SCIENTISTS WERE ABLE TO PROBE TEMPERATURES, EMISSIONSFROM THE PLANETS AND YOU MIGHT EVEN BE ABLE TO MEASURE WINDFROM FAR EXTRASOLAR PLANETS?That's true. The two teams of scientists lead by David Charbonneau (Harvard-SmithsonianCenter for Astrophysics (CFA), and Drake Demming (NASA's Goddard Space FlightCenter) they have been able to interpret their observations of these two planets in thesense of trying to understand exactly how bright the planet has to be in order to give offthe amount of light that is seen. From a fairly simple calculation, they can figure out thetemperature the planet has to have to give off that amount of light. That temperature thentells you something very important about what is happening in the upper atmosphere onthe planet and tells you something about the wind speeds and what is happening in theplanet's atmosphere, which is a whole new way of probing the planets. We are learningmore about what they might be like if you could be on one of them.IF THERE WAS AN EXTRASOLAR PLANET THAT HAD OCEANS SIMILAR TO THEEARTH, WOULD WE WITH THE NEW INSTRUMENTATION BE ABLE TO TELL IFTHERE WAS LIQUID WATER ON A FAR AWAY PLANET?That is one of the major goals for the spacecraft that NASA and the European SpaceAgency are planning on launching in the next ten years or so. They will be able to detectthe presence of water vapor in the atmosphere in the planets that they see. We know thatwater is a prerequisite for life as we know it, so that is one of the major thrusts for beingable to characterize planets around other stars to try to see not only what the planet is like,but in terms of mass and orbit to see if that orbit is orbiting where water would remain"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"liquid. We also want to see direct evidence for water in the atmosphere of that planet.IT'S IRONIC, ISN'T IT, THAT WE WILL HAVE THE CHALLENGE OF LOOKINGFOR WATER ON EXTRASOLAR PLANETS LIGHT YEARS FROM OUR SOLARSYSTEM, WHILE WE ARE CHALLENGED BY TRYING TO EVEN UNDERSTANDTHE MARTIAN WATER HISTORY?Exactly right. We certainly will make tremendous progress on Mars because NASA hasreally focused on following the water on Mars and now has a rather major programunderway for a series of rovers that will be going to Mars. Eventually, hopefully, someastronauts will be walking as well there. So, the time has come in the history of humanevolution for us to reach out beyond the Earth moon system to go beyond the events of1969 when Neil Armstrong first stepped on another body in our solar system and move onto the phase where we begin exploring beyond Earth moon orbit and understand moreabout the possible prevalence of life in our solar system.OF THE 130 EXTRASOLAR PLANETS ORBITING AROUND OTHER SUNS, WHATIS THE CLOSEST SYSTEM WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DETECT AS HAVING OTHERPLANETS?I think the closest planets are maybe 30 light years away something of that order. They arenot terribly close. We are continuing to search the very closest stars because the closeststars are the ones that would be where we could take the closest pictures. So we haven'tgotten any close by planets so far, but it's in part because we don't really have thetechniques available to do an in-depth survey.NASA is planning on launching several very capable telescopes in the next ten years whichwill be able to search the very closest stars and take pictures of their planets if they arethere.THE CLOSEST STAR THAT I REMEMBER IS ABOUT 4 LIGHT YEARS FROM THEEARTH?That's right called Proxima Centauri. It's a member of a triple star system (Alpha CentauriA, Alpha Centauri B and Proxima Centauri) and that will be a prime example to look at tosee if it has planets around it. So far people have been looking at it by the indirect method,but they haven't found any evidence yet for any large planets. But there could very well besome low mass planets that cannot be seen by current techniques. But we might find themeventually.The closest stars to our solar system are 4.22 light-years away.Alpha Centauri A, Alpha Centauri B and Proxima Centauri are too dim to be seen with the naked eye.Proxima is not much bigger than our own solar system's Jupiter. The two stars, Alpha Centauri A and B, are alittlefarther away at about 4.36 light-years. Alpha Centaur A and B form a close binary that is separatedby only about 24 times the Earth-Sun distance -- 23.7 astronomical units (AUs) -- only slightly greaterthan the distance between Uranus and the Sun. Graphic © Laro Schatzer.Only Jupiter-Size Planets Detected So FarIN TERMS OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE PLANETS WE'VE SEEN SO FAR, AREALL OF THEM JUPITER SIZE OR LARGER?Most of the planets are, yes, very large, comparable to the Jupiter and Saturn in our solarsystem. But just last fall, several groups of astronomers were able to detect the presenceindirectly of planets as low in mass as 15 times the mass of Earth. So, they are gettingdown now in the range of what we might start calling a 'terrestrial-like' or rocky planet. Wedon't really know for those objects what their composition is. We hope to find out someday. But if they truly are roughly 15 Earth masses and are composed primarily of rock,then I think we have actually discovered a brand new class of planet that is, planets muchlike the Earth and will give us even more excitement and impetus to search for Earth-likeplanets which are closer in size to Earth.WE HAVE NOT HAD ANY INSTRUMENT THAT COULD FIND AN EARTH-SIZEDPLANET YET?That's exactly right. For all we know, a number of nearby stars could have solar systems"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"very much like our own including even the giant planets. We are just getting now to wheresearches have been going on long enough to reveal the rather long-term effects that aJupiter-sized planet would have on its host star. You basically have to follow stars for 12years or so because that's the period of Jupiter's orbit. We are just now getting far enoughinto the research that we can hope to find nearby stars that have large Jupiter planets.But in addition, we have no capability whatsoever of finding Earth-mass planets inEarth-like orbits. That is going to be a task for the future and NASA is planning severalmissions which will be able to do that. So, in the next 10 years or so, we should be able tosee if there are Earth-like planets around nearby stars, as well as more distant stars. Planet Formation - The Mystery of Saturn's Iapetus MoonI JUST CAME BACK FROM THE LUNAR AND PLANETARY INSTITUTEWEEK-LONG CONFERENCE IN HOUSTON. ONE OF THE BIGGEST MYSTERIESIN TERMS OF THE EVOLUTION OF OUR OWN SOLAR SYSTEM ARE ALL THOSEMOONS AROUND SATURN AND SPECIFICALLY IAPETUS WHICH SEEMS TOHAVE A 12-MILE-HIGH RING THAT GOES AROUND THE MOON'S EQUATOR.HAVE YOU STUDIED THAT AND WOULD YOU HAVE ANY HYPOTHESIS AS APLANET-FORMATION THEORIST ABOUT HOW THAT COULD HAVE FORMED?I don't have any explanation for Iapetus's equator ring. That is certainly a major mystery.But as far as we know, the extrasolar planetary systems are going to have planets whichhave satellite systems around them and rings and so on, just like the planets in our solarsystem. But those will be even more difficult to detect. But there is no reason why weshould not expect to find them.As a theorist, I should point out that those of us who worry about planet formation prettymuch have our hands full just trying to understand how the planets formed. We haven'tquite gotten to the point where we can understand in general the formation of their satellitesystems. In case of the Earth's moon, there is a very good theory that has evolved abouthow the moon was formed. But in terms of forming the regular and irregular satellites ofthe outer planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune we are just beginning to scratch thatproblem. Did Our Moon Eject From A Violent Impact On Earth?DO YOU THINK THE MOON THAT ORBITS EARTH CAME FROM OUR OWNPLANET IN SOME VIOLENT EVENT?Yes, back in the early 1980s, there was a major conference in Hawaii the KonaConference that produced a consensus about the origin of our moon, that it arose from agiant impact an impact between a roughly Mars-sized body with the growing Earth. That'sbecome essentially the conventional wisdom and has not been challenged since. So, for thepast 20 years, everyone who worries about formation of the moon has been working in thecontext of understanding how these gigantic impacts could produce a moon-like satellite tothe Earth. Will We Find Other Life in the Universe This Century?DO YOU THINK IN THIS CENTURY THAT WE WILL SEE THOSE HEADLINES,'LIFE ON MARS' OR 'LIFE ON ANOTHER PLANET'?Oh, most definitely! This century is quite young, this being only 2005. So, if you give me95 years in scientific terms, that's an incredible amount of time. If you try to go back 95years in time, think what we knew 95 years ago? We knew very little. And the amount ofknowledge we have is growing in an exponential fashion. That means we certainly we willbe able to have information about planets outside our solar system and what theiratmospheres are like within the next ten or twenty years at the most. The plans for gettingto Mars to understand Mars are certainly going to come to fruition in the next fewdecades. So, if you give me a 95 year time interval, I would say, 'Yes,' we will most likelyknow in that time period if we are alone in the solar system or universe or not.THE NASA SEARCH FOR EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCE, KNOWN ASSETI, AND NOW OPERATING AS AN INDEPENDENT BODY, HAS BEENLOOKING FOR A VARIETY OF RADIO SIGNALS AND CHEMISTRY SIGNALS FORA LONG TIME. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE PUTTING TV AND"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"RADIO SIGNALS AND ALL OF THAT OUT FROM THE EARTH INTO THEUNIVERSE ON A CONSTANT BASIS. WHY DO YOU THINK THAT WE HAVE NOTSEEN SIGNS OF SOME OTHER KIND OF RADIO SIGNALS THAT WOULD FALLINTO THE CATEGORY OF INTELLIGENCE?It's very difficult to detect radio or TV signals from another planet because the signals eventhough they are leaving the Earth are actually quite weak. They were not intended to bebeamed out into space. So even though an advanced civilization on a nearby star might benow watching many years of 'I Love Lucy' reruns, in fact, they would have to have anincredibly huge telescope to detect those. To be able to detect signals from atechnologically advanced civilization, they would have to be beaming a signal directlytoward us with a rather large radio telescope of their own. They would have tointentionally be sending radiation right in our direction so we could pick it up.Even if we want to do that ourselves if we wanted to broadcast our presence to the rest ofthe galaxy, we would have to have a large number of dedicated radio telescopes sweepingthrough the galaxy looking at literally billions of stars and pinpointing them one after theother and sending them a signal and hoping that some of them might happen to be listeningat the same time. So, if you think about the immensity of the galaxy and the number ofstars and not knowing ahead of time where life is, it's really a quite difficult problem toexpect to have heard from another civilization by now. Or to expect another civilization tohear from us. That's not to say it can't be done. Definitely the search should be continued,but it's not that surprising that we have not heard yet.THERE WAS A SCIENCE FRIEND OF MINE WHO SAID IN A KIND OF IRONICWAY, BUT IT MADE ME THINK. HE SAID WE DON'T KNOW WHATINTELLIGENCE WOULD BE LIKE ON ANOTHER PLANET AND IF THEY WEREALL TELEPATHIC, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ANY NEED FOR COMMUNICATINGWITH RADIO SIGNALS.(laughs) I wouldn't want to suggest telepathy as a replacement for direct communication.But certainly one has to worry about whether or not civilizations want to communicate? Orwhether they have finite lifetimes? There is always the problem that if we somehowmanage to do ourselves in through global warming or through a comet impact or somethinglike that, then perhaps we aren't going to be around much longer at least not in a state to beable to have high technology radio communication devices. Perhaps the problem nothearing from Someone Else out there is simply due to the finite lifetime of civilizations.That's a pretty apocalyptic approach to things. I tend to be more cheerful than that in life,so I hope that some day we will actually find a signal.WHAT YOU MEAN IS THAT THERE COULD ALREADY HAVE BEENSOPHISTICATED CIVILIZATIONS THAT AROSE ON THE BELL SHAPED CURVEOF SURVIVAL AND WENT EXTINCT?I think that's most likely the case. If it really is true that life can evolve elsewhere, then it'shard to imagine that that has not happened.THAT THERE COULD BE PLANETS OUT THERE WITH LIFE WHERE OUR LIFEWAS MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO STARTING ON THEIR UPWARDARC AND THAT WE HUMANS KEEP WANTING TO FIND OURSELVESSOMEWHERE ON ANOTHER PLANET REFLECTED IN THE UNIVERSE. BUT INFACT, THE UNIVERSE MIGHT BE A BUZZING, BOOMING PLACE OF SO MANYDIFFERENT STAGES OF LIFE.Absolutely. That's certainly true. The rise of life and intelligence of life on our planet tookhundreds of millions of years. There is no reason to think that all of the planets aresynchronized in their life evolution process. So, we should expect if we can sample anumber of such planets, to find them in all stages of evolution. We should find some thatare certain zoological parks of early creatures are beginning to crawl around. We shouldfind some that are more archaeological sites where one could go and examine what hadhappened in a distant past.AND STRING THEORY AND QUANTUM PHYSICS KEEP COMING UP WITHPROVOCATIVE POTENTIALS ABOUT TIME TRAVEL INTO THE FUTURE AND ANIMPLICATION THAT THERE COULD BE OTHER CIVILIZATIONS THAT ARE VERYADVANCED AT A DIFFERENT AREA IN THE TIME LINE AND THAT THEYCOULD BE TIME TRAVELERS TO US.(laughs) I don't think I really want to go there! (laughs again) I'm too much of a hard nosedphysicist to believe in time travel, I'm afraid.BUT YOU DO KNOW THAT IS DISCUSSED BY PEOPLE WHO ARE WRITING INSTRING THEORY AND QUANTUM PHYSICS?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Yes, and that's not a physics I participate in. I tend to work in physics that is a little moregrounded in reality. String theory is still an extraordinary hypothetical by definition. Ialways thought working on extrasolar planets was a pretty far flung enterprise. But itturned out to be grounded in reality. That's where I prefer to devote my efforts.WELL, LOOK HOW MAIN STREAM YOU HAVE BECOME.(laughs) Exactly!WHILE STRING THEORY AND QUANTUM PHYSICISTS ARE STILL DESCRIBINGTHINGS THAT MIGHT BECOME JUST AS MAIN STREAM IN THE FUTURE.That's certainly true. Quantum physics is still very rooted in observational experiments thatscientists can perform in the lab. I think string theory is yet to be able to show it can makea prediction perhaps that could be observationally verifiable. That would be something tolook forward in the future if it can be done.The next major event perhaps will be the launch of NASA's Kepler Telescope roughly in2007 or so.[Editor's Note: German astronomer, Johann Kepler. Publication of his MysteriumCosmographicum in 1597 explained the spacings of the planets and establishedKepler's reputation as a leading astronomer. The Kepler Mission is a special purposespace mission in the NASA Headquarters Discovery Program for detecting terrestrialplanets, that is, rocky and Earth-size, around other stars.]The Kepler Mission will be designed to find Earth-like planets by transit, that is bywatching a planet pass in front of a star and dim the starlight for a short period of time andthen periodically come back and dim it again and again as the orbit goes around andaround. So, Kepler will hopefully by the year 2009 or 2010 or so give us some indicationof how many Earth-like planets are out there. That is Earth-mass planets orbiting on aone-year period around a sun-like star. That will be a very important number to knowbecause if it turns out that Earth-like planets are quite frequent and commonplace, then itwill be quite easy to find them to go to the next step. But if it turns out that Earth-likeplanets are somewhat rare, that means it will be quite more difficult to detect them.\"More Information:2005 - The Allen Telescope Array, Hat Creek, CaliforniaComing on line this year, financed by Paul Allen and Nathan Myhrvold, who made theirfortunes at Microsoft, is the Allen Telescope Array being constructed at the Hat CreekRadio Observatory in northern California where the University of California currentlyoperates an array that observes at millimeter-wavelengths. This new Allen Telescope Arrayjoins the search for extraterrestrial intelligence in the universe and will consist of 350individual 20-foot antennas linked to form the equivalent of a single large antenna. Whenfully operational, the Allen Telescope Array will have more collecting area than the newlycompleted Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, and better resolution than the Arecibodish in Puerto Rico that has that has long been used by SETI to \"search for extraterrestriallife in the universe.\"2007 - NASA's Kepler Telescope"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" The Kepler Mission will be designed to find Earth-like planets by transit, that is bywatching a planet pass in front of a star and dim the starlight for a short period of time andthen periodically come back and dim it again and again as the orbit goes around andaround.

It will find them indirectly. SIM will seethe effects of the planet's mass on the star, in the sense that the star has to wobble aroundthe center mass of the star/planet system. So, SIM will be looking for wobbling stars andwhen they start wobbling with just the right wobble that a 10-Earth-mass planet wouldinduce in them, then we'll have indirect evidence for Earth-like planets around those stars.2015 - Terrestrial Planet Finder Coronograph (TPFC)That telescope will be a very large optical telescope in space which will be able to takepictures of a planet and separate out the starlight from that of the host star. That will notonly take a picture of the planet, but also tell us a little about what its atmosphere is like. Itwill be able to resolve the planet into a spectrum, that is the amount of light given off asfunction of wavelength. By looking at the planet's spectrum, we can say something aboutwhat sort of molecules are in its atmosphere; for example, water, carbon dioxide, evenoxygen perhaps. With those signatures of the atmospheric composition, we will be able tosay something profound about whether that planet is habitable or perhaps even if it isinhabited.Websites:Spitzer Space Telescope: http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/about/index.shtml"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Kepler's Telescope: http://www.kepler.arc.nasa.gov/spacecraft.htmlTerrestrial Planet Finder: http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/TPF/tpf_index.htmlSpace Interferometer Mission (SIM): http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/SIM/sim_index.htmlAllen Telescope Array: http://www.seti.org/site/pp.asp?c=ktJ2J9MMIsE&b=178025Alpha Centauri 3: http://www.solstation.com/stars/alp-cent3.htmCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
