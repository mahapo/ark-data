Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994.CASE A-11: 1965, Air Force Museum, Fairborn, Ohio: The Air Force Museum is in Fairborn, Ohio, near Dayton.Fairborn is also the location for Wright-Patterson AFB. RM has been in government service for 23 years, is married with family, resides nearCincinnati, Ohio. This extraordinary case is fact, according to the witness, RM, and if whathe encountered is indeed fact, then we as appraisers can either accept it as possible, orprobable, or reject it utterly as fantasy as we can do with all UFO events of highstrangeness. RM, referred to me by a Cincinnatian who can vouch for his integrity, prefersanonymity because of his long service with a government office. The story goes back toabout 1965, said RM, during a Sunday visit with his wife to the Air Force Museum inFairborn, Ohio (suburb of Dayton). While his wife became engrossed in examining a German V-2 rocket on display, RMwandered off and found that he had gone down a corridor, got disoriented, went through adouble-door marked 'Off Limits' and then suddenly came face to face with a being soincredible-looking that all he can remember in his numb state was saying, 'Hi,' to which hegot no response. The being was dressed much like an astronaut in a silver suit with support pack. It was adiminutive figure, about 4.5 feet all which had a translucent dome over a large head. 'It wasn't human,' said RM. 'Its eyes were large under a heavy brow and there was no noseand only a slit of a mouth. The skin was bluish - or at least that's the way it looked throughthe dome.' RM said when the space-suited creature walked, its gait was different. Itshuffled forward without bending its knees. At one point during the brief encounter, RMsaid the entity stopped, held out both arms mechanically toward him and pointed its longelongated fingers into his face. Then the alarm system sounded. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"While red lights flashed everywhere, RM somehow found the corridor and made a fastexit. As the loudspeakers announced an emergency evacuation, MPs were ushering peopleto the exits. RM said there was no panic and although the MPs were polite, there was afeeling of anxiety. The cause for the emergency evacuation he thought was withoutquestion about the creature who probably had escaped from its confinement. In 1970 or 1971, RM said because of his work, he met a retired Air Force Colonel towhom he related his experience. Having once served in a top secret capacity at Wright-Patterson, the Colonel replied to RM's surprise: 'If you know that much, I'll tell you therest.' According to RM's informant, two live alien beings were in captivity. Scientists haddeveloped a benign incubative atmosphere to sustain their life, at least for awhile. TheColonel also revealed that he was aware of a crash in 1969 of a 'two-man-sized' craft nearWhitewater Lake in Indiana. The cause was electrical disturbance. No other details wererevealed. RM said, 'The Colonel made it clear that he did not want his name or his disclosures madeknown as long as he lived. However, shortly after RM got the information about twocaptive aliens, his source died of cancer. RM called his friend 'Colonel Schmitz,' which at alater time RM admitted was a false name he used to protect the family of the Colonel. COMMENT: Live aliens! Loose in the Air Force Museum? Fantastic, of course, but theWright-Patterson complex is vast and so are its underground facilities. It is conceivable, iftruly live aliens exist, that one might have slipped by the guards into the passageways andsurfaced in an upper chamber of the Museum. This story recalls another of seemingfantasy published in Situation Red, The UFO Siege, based on information related to me bySherman Larsen of CUFOS. In that case, alien cadavers were purportedly stored in theScience and Industry Museum, Chicago, and were witnessed accidentally by a ministerand son who went down a wrong corridor. CASE A-12: 1944, Kaneohe, Oahu, Hawaii E.L. of Los Angeles, married, has daughter, grandchild, is retired. Served as CarpenterMate, 1st Class, Hqt. Co. 112th Construction Battalion, WWII. This case dating back to 1944, allegedly involves a landed or disabled alien craftdiscovered by a Seabee, E.L., near the beach of Kaneohe, Oahu, Hawaii. The year of theevent is not only difficult to accept, but so is the story, mainly because of the fictionishanachronisms EL related during certain CE III phases of his experience. Lucius Farish,author of \"In Other Words\" in MUFON UFO Journal, referred me to the source. Louagrees that while the story is fantastic, and probably beyond verification, it is nonetheless acase that just might have happened - or some of it - and should be recorded. EL, during three interviews by phone, related his experience cooperatively when assuredof anonymity. He explained that only his offspring and one other researcher, Don Worleyof APRO, had heard his story firsthand. He admitted that no one would ever believe hisstory and at 66 years of age, he seemed relieved when I told him I planned to publish partof his story for research records. EL's story begins with a stroll along the Kenoehe beaches on a Sunday morning to look forshells. Suddenly, his eye caught a glint of metal reflecting sunlight near a wooded ridge notfar from a radar installation. Curious, EL went to look and was faced with a strangeglobular object about 50 feet in diameter. 'It looked like an igloo,' he said, 'except on thetop was a clear glass dome about a foot high with a gold device, like a weather vane,spinning inside.' Outside were a group of people, EL said, all dressed in tight-fitting green uniforms. Acloser look to his surprise revealed they were short, or 'scaled down' people, about 4.5 feettall, of exceedingly slight build with no buttocks. Their faces were human-like with headstopped with short, lush black hair, large dark eyes, heavy eyebrows. One featured large,fanged teeth. This one, EL was told later, was a female. Each wore a heavy belt with abox-like apparatus attached in front. Two of the group of seven were sitting on the ship'sramp, four at regular intervals around it and one was out front, just 20 feet away from him.'All were staring at me,' he said. 'The nearest one, probably the leader, acted like he waswaiting for me. I still had no fear because I thought they were just small Navy people usedin submarine duty.' Then the man nearest to EL spoke. It was in heavy accent, but the voice was too deep forhis size. While the others remained silent, one of them suddenly reached down to theapparatus on his belt, pressed a button which instantly made EL dizzy and nauseous. Then"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"he lunged at EL with a sword-like weapon drawn from a scabbard. EL resisted, drew hisknife and a battle for 'life or death' ensued. But EL managed to overcome his assailantforcing him to the ground. Then to EL's amazement, the others jumped into the fray andslew their own comrade. EL, who was dazed by it all, was told by the leader to return thenext morning to talk by a large black rock near the water's edge. Said EL, 'They didn'tknow it, but I took the box from the dead man's belt.' Meeting at the black rock, EL was told of the wondrous world from whence the alienscame, 21 light years away. The leader also explained that this was the beginning of aperiod of world visits to check on the Earth they colonized eons ago. But EL's accord with the space people did not last long. A 'Navy swabbie,' who hadwitnessed EL's meeting with the strange men dressed in green, reported his activity toNaval Intelligence. According to EL, he was promptly summoned to Intelligence to explainhis escapade to a Lt. Lewis. After lengthy interrogation by Naval Intelligence, OSS and theFBI, who had been called in, E. L. was forced to surrender the so-called Black Box and todesignate the location of the alien craft. By some crafty maneuvers, they managed tocapture the female entity who was heavily guarded until she was sent to the U. S.mainland. Then EL learned that Naval aircraft shot down the alien ship as it tried to takeoff and it fell into the ocean. It was towed, he said, using nets to San Diego. The remainingcrew of six probably rotted inside because the Navy could not penetrate the craft's metalskin with conventional tools. According to EL, the Black Box was the subject of great interest to the OSS and NavalIntelligence. While in the office, its great power was luridly demonstrated on a pet cat.Pressing one of its three buttons, the cat faced the object's invisible wave and fell deadinstantly, its bones liquefying into jelly. Even the desk upon which the box sat was searedthrough the varnish and into the wood which caused a foul odor. EL, of course, signed an oath of secrecy and was threatened by one of the plain-clothesagents who 'looked like President Johnson.' If he talked about the incident, he was told, hecould be charged with murder of the ship's crew member. He had been framed, EL said. COMMENT: EL's complete story, which includes voluminous CEIII data, is beyond thescope of this paper. My notes cover several pages. Before my investigation, Don Worleyof APRO in 1974 had made extensive efforts by mail to get the facts. But Don gave upwhen many of his questions went unanswered. The story is difficult to believe, especiallythe phase when EL does battle in medieval style with an alien. Such an anachronism, onthe other hand, might have been staged using hypnotic techniques, for reasons that willremain inexplicable. THE INTERMEDIARY REPORT: CLASSIFIED 'B' In this section of 'B' material is support information from various sources, mainlyintermediaries who in most instances have been advised by their first person source of apreference for anonymity. In most of these cases, I have been privileged to know the nameof the informant. However, because of alleged deep fears a few will not allow biographicalclues to go beyond their trusted go-between. Section 'B' also includes other general C/Rinformation that I consider useful in helping the reader understand the scope of thisresearch and its seeming sensitivities. CASE B-1: 1950s, Wright-Patterson AFB, Fairborn, Ohio YR is retired on medical pension, served in the U. S. Army, WWII, was chauffeur forGeneral Patton; worked as millwright at General Electric. Resides near Cincinnati. YR, a government pensioned retiree, a patient who has long suffered from radiationexposure, and one of a few non-military, non-scientific people to see the bodies at Wright-Patterson. He was made known to me through his daughter who lives near Cincinnati. The daughter told me: 'Dad was working at Wright-Patterson in the early 1950s. He wouldnot pin down the year. He was gone from home for more than a week to do some secretwork at the Air Base. He would not discuss it with anybody, except Mom (now deceased),not even me. Then, after all these years, he saw you on WLW-TV talking about crashedUFOs and said, 'That man knows what he's talking about!' That was the wedge I needed,the chance to ask him what he did there.' In the course of the next several months, the daughter managed to ferret out bits andpieces of information. YR, employed by General Electric as a millwright, accepted the jobassignment at Wright-Patterson knowing beforehand of its sensitivity. As far as his"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"daughter could ascertain, it involved the installation of a radiation device (a furnace?)which was used in some unexplained way in a secret section in or near the room whichstored seven alien cadavers. According to her father, when he and his black assistant, Mr. W., reported to the Wright-Patterson office for their assignment, they were transported by limousine with darkcurtains pulled shut across the windows. It reminded him of a hearse. Then, blindfoldedand turned around several times for disorientation, he and 'W' were escorted to anunderground level by elevator and then on to the work area. Once in the chamber or'morgue,' which he described as 'icy cold' and exuding a strange offensive odor, he wasgiven work instructions. Every move he made, he said, was watched by guards. Oncewhen he peeked over to look at one of the corpses, each inside a glass case resting on amarble slab, a guard pulled a sheet over the top. On the side of each case were jalousies,usually shut. Occasionally, the glass would fog up. Asked about the bodies, his daughter said her father would not say much, probablyconscious of his oath. But with time and patience, she learned that the humanoids wereshort, had large heads and looked 'clammy with the skin of a reptile.' the head had skin thatreminded him of a frog. Yes, he said the hands had webs, but he didn't remember thenumber of fingers. To his daughter's dismay, she was told that as a security measure, his lodging there at thebase was a cell-like room (he called it 'his jail') without communications to the outsideworld. Among other discomforts, 'was the dangdest odor he ever smelled.' It was so badthat he asked for a fan. They obliged, but the stench made his nostrils itch. On the plusside, he said, 'The food was good - steaks, everything. I even had a TV set.' YR said thathis exposure to radiation on the job concerned the officials. He had to change his workclothes regularly and they took a radiation count not only when he left the premises, but hecontinues to report to medical authorities for check-ups. 'Dad took early retirement because of radiation sickness,' the daughter said. 'His health ispoor despite surgery and continuous medical care.' Mr. W., his black helper, was alsoexposed, was retired early on a good pension and died of cancer several years ago. COMMENT: YR uses 'soda pop' phraseology which, like body chemistry, can beconvincing. Examples: 'his jail,' and 'blindfolded and turned around several times.' At thistime of writing, he will not become a first-person statistic for me, fearing loss of hispension. His daughter, whose word I trust, is still trying to get answers to 'our' manyquestions. CASE B-2: 1968, U. S. Army Intelligence School, Near Big Spring, Texas Bi g Spri ng, Texas northeast of Midl and, al l egedly 50 mil es fromsecret Army Intelligence training base and 16 acre Air Force 'facility' in 1968. Thomas Olsen of Phoenix, Arizona, veteran UFO researcher and nuclear engineer byprofession, is credited in securing this unusual report for this paper from Larry W. Thisreport, like so many others, suggests that the highest degree of secrecy hides somesensational or sinister truth. Following is Larry's letter to me, dated December 14, 1980,abbreviated without alteration of text. December 14, 1980, letter from Larry W.: 'I applaud your efforts to shed somelight on the UFO riddle; perhaps my letter will be some assistance in this regard.Before I begin, let me emphasize that every detail of which I can be reasonablycertain is included in this letter."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The following narrative is based upon my best recollections of an eyewitnessaccount told to me some five years ago. For the most part, these recollections aregleaned from several pages of 'dog-earred' notes and sketches made at that time. In 1975, I was majoring in engineering at Arizona State University in Tempe,Arizona. I was employed by the university as a classroom assistant tutoring studentsin an Engineering Graphics class. It was during one of these sessions that asophomore student, Mr. DR, first told me about his personal observations of a UFO'capture or retrieval.' He began telling me that in 1968, he was in the U. S. Army attending an 'Intelligence'school in a remote desert area of Texas. He told me that the nearest town, BigSpring, was approximately '50 or so miles away.' About one mile from the Armycompound was a small 16 acre Air Force 'facility.' DR stressed that it could not beconsidered a 'full-fledged base.' Apparently, this whole area was restricted. Eachinstallation was quite 'well-guarded and patrolled.' DR pointed out, however, that theAir Force 'facility' was particularly secure.\" Continued in Part 7 - Military Helicopters and UFO Crash Retrieval?Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
