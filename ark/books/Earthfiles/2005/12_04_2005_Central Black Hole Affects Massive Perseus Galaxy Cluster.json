Chandra X-rayObservatory image credit: NASA/CXC/IoA/A. Fabian et al. December 4, 2005 Cambridge, Massachusetts - Chandra X-Ray Observatory inCambridge, Massachusetts reports: \"An accumulation of 270 hours of Chandraobservations of the central regions of the Perseus galaxy cluster reveals evidence of theturmoil that has wracked the cluster for hundreds of millions of years. One of the mostmassive objects in the universe, the cluster contains thousands of galaxies immersed in avast cloud of multimillion degree gas with the mass equivalent of trillions of suns.\"Enormous bright loops, ripples, and jet-like streaks are apparent in the image. The darkblue filaments in the center are likely due to a galaxy that has been torn apart and is fallinginto NGC 1275, a.k.a. Perseus A, the giant galaxy that lies at the center of the cluster. Chandra image of Perseus cluster with overlay of low pressure region."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Special processing designed to bring out low and high pressure regions in the hot gas has uncoveredhuge low pressure regions (shown in purple in the accompanying image overlay, and outlined with the whitecontour).These low pressure regions appear as expanding plumes that extend outward 300,000 light yearsfrom the supermassive black hole in NGC 1275.\"The hot gas pressure is assumed to be low in the plumes because unseen bubbles ofhigh-energy particles have displaced the gas. The plumes are due to explosive venting fromthe vicinity of the supermassive black hole.The venting produces sound waves which heat the gas throughout the inner regions of thecluster and prevent the gas from cooling and making stars at a high rate. This process hasslowed the growth of one of the largest galaxies in the Universe. The Perseus galaxycluster is a dramatic example of how a relatively tiny, but massive, black hole at the centerof a galaxy can control the heating and cooling behavior of gas far beyond the confines ofthe galaxy. \"More Information:For more about black holes, please see reports below in Earthfiles Archives :· 11/09/2005 -- Dust Storm On Mars, Cosmic First Light and Black Hole At OurGalaxy's Center· 03/03/2005 -- What Made Five Strong Radio Bursts At the Center of Our Galaxy?· 05/14/2003 -- Hubble Telescope Finds \"Ashes\" of First Stars in This Universe· 09/12/2000 -- Black Holes - A Surprising Mass in the M82 Galaxy· 09/06/2000 -- Hubble Photographs Mystery Object in Centaurus Constellation· 04/24/2000 -- A Black Hole in the Big Dipper?· 01/28/2000 -- Black Hole Mystery at the Center of the Andromeda Galaxy· 01/17/2000 -- Chandra Telescope Helps Solve X-Ray Mystery· 08/28/1999 -- Oddball Quasar and Salt Water Inside Meteorite· 02/01/1999 -- Astronomy Updates with Brian Marsden and John Huchra, HarvardWebsite:http://chandra.harvard.edu/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2010 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2010, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
