Here begins Part 4of Status Report III, written in June 1982. The series of status reports, I through VII, werewritten by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report IV begins atEarthfiles 021205. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994.Leonard Stringfield: \"In 1979, RC got my name from a former Cincinnati resident,a retired Air Force colonel in Las Vegas, who knew of my research since themid-1950s. In 1980, RC formed APRON, a local group, and asked for my guidelinesand to be its chief consultant. During this period, he asked that I call his fiance toconvince her that his time was well spent in UFO research. He later told me that mycall 'really helped' and he was encouraged to keep up his work. Shortly after the RT disclosures, however, the enthusiasm of RC suddenly droppedto zero. When I called him on August 20, 1980, he said grimly, 'I've been warned tolay off RT.' Cryptically, without giving me details, he said that he was disbanding APRON,getting out of research and planned to move to Texas or Florida and that he wouldcall me from wherever he settled. When I pressed for an explanation, he paused andthen asked that I call back later. When I did, he said that his fiance's car had beenforced off the road in Las Vegas and that his apartment had been burglarized. 'Onlythings missing,' he said, 'are your (Stringfield's) books, Situation Red, 3-0 Blue andStatus Report II, along with notes I had on the RT case, and a photo of you. Nothingelse.' When I called RC on September 9, 1980, he was ready to leave next week forFlorida and advised that I not tell anybody. He said he had not received any newthreats and he assured me that his fiance was 'okay.' On October 10, 19880, RC wrote to me stating that he and his fiance had settled inPensacola, Florida. In his letter of October 29, 1980, he requested new copies of mybooks that had been stolen. He added, 'I had no problems until I started interviewingRT. I'm OK now.' In his letter of December 3, 1980, he acknowledged receipt of thebooks I sent and said, 'My friend CJ said that he is going to do some research on the1953 Kingman incident. Len, he would like to make direct contact with you. Hedoes respect what you're doing.' In his typewritten letter, February 19, 1981, RCwrote in part: 'I have not heard from my contact yet. However, his wife said that hewanted to talk to me as soon as he got back from Washington ... will relate to you allthat I get from him.' The next news from RC came as a shock. His fiance had been killed in a caraccident near Singing Sands, Florida. She had been traveling alone, he said, fromPensacola, when a car had apparently forced her off the road, leaving only blackpaint marks on the side of her car. 'It was hit and run,' he said. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Months later in 1981, I heard from a mutual research friend of RC's in Las Vegas,that RC had made arrangements to meet three men at an airport concerning UFOs.Since then, silence. CASE A-6. PJ of Dallas, Texas, Captain, U. S. Navy, USNR, Military Flight hours, 6100; civilian7500 hours, test pilot: Ling Tempco Vought, F8s and A7s. Presently commercialairline pilot. In the sensitive realm of witness credibility, PJ ranks highest on the scale - notablyin this case, for his credentials are in both military and commercial aviation.Although he prefers to be anonymous in this paper because of his current status asairline pilot, he is refreshingly devoid of mystery and without the hang-up of beingstalked by fears of reprisal. In this case, as in some others of significance, my initialcontact was Tommy Blann (See Case A-9 this paper) who made arrangements forme to reach PJ for his first person report. It was New Year's Eve, 1981, when I first reached PJ at his Dallas home duringwhich time he highlighted his observation of a saucer-like craft at Wright-Pattersonin 1962. Since then, I have talked to PJ by phone several times, received a copy ofhis taped interview with Blann, and received a signed letter dated April 13, 1982,which essentially describes his experience as follows:PJ, Dallas, Texas, transcript of taped interview from Tommy Blann inApril 13, 1982 correspondence: 'In April of 1962, while attached to the 354th TAC Fighter Wing as anExchange pilot, the 352nd Tactical Fighter Squadron deployed to Wright-Patterson AFB on a Hurricane Evacuation from Myrtle Beach AFB, S. C. As Flight Commander of the 'B' Flight Bluebirds, it was my policy to keep mymen physically and mentally tough by enforcing a program of running, playingtouch football or handball. Wright Patterson Air Force Base northeast of Dayton, Ohio.On the first day of our five day deployment, I led my flight crew of five on arunning trip through the (Wright-Patterson) Air Base, looking for a gym whichis usually tucked away in a hangar of sorts along the portable handball courtsusing two walls of the hangar and erecting two portable walls to complete afour wall handball court. As we crossed two baseball fields, we approached the first hangar which,without hesitating, we guessed was the Special Services Hangar. We bustedthrough both doors on a full sprint to look for the equipment room checkoutfor gear. Once inside, we were stunned by dead silence and was approachedby an air police sentry with a sub-machine gun. Standing about eight feet away was a strange looking object. It was about 12to 15 feet long and eight feet deep and resembled two plates stuck together -or to a track and field man, it was a large discus. It was suspended off theground by two engine test stands. There were no markings or insignia, butmost noticeable, it was without rivets. The object was roped off and eightguards stood parade rest around it. The guard challenged by saying, 'I don't think you're supposed to be here, Sir.'"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I replied to the affirmative and we turned about face and departed mumblingto ourselves. Once outside, we had reassured each other that the good old U.S. had developed, or had all along, flying saucers in service. On our return to Myrtle Beach AFB, S. C., a week later, I was requested toreport to the Brig. General of the Combat Wing. The debriefing was veryshort. He informed me that I had broken security. He only asked one question:'What did you see?' My reply was, 'Nothing!' His answer was, 'You have theright answer to the question' and I was dismissed. The incident caused me to research fully the object we had seen. Having aTOP SECRET clearance enabled me to gain valuable information thatotherwise would be impossible to obtain. I could go on forever on what isconsidered 'hearsay' or secondhand information, but for a brief thirty seconds,a disc-shaped object of metallic color, 15 feet wide and eight feet deep wasseen. I cannot confirm anything other than it was there. One thing that has always puzzled me was the lack of security. It was not evenlocated in the test facility of Wright-Patterson AFB. It was near the flight linehaving just arrived or was awaiting deployment. That is just my guess.' COMMENT: Names of the officers involved in this case are withheld on PJ'srequest, for obvious reasons. If the craft observed by the witness was freshlyretrieved, the year 1962 is significant, considering we have crash/retrievals reportedin Cases A-6 in Status Report II (to be reprinted in future Earthfiles) and in B-4, inthis paper. CASE A-7: RK of Columbus, Ohio, was an instructor in Gunnery School with E-4 Grade, GreatLakes Naval Base, March 1973-September 1974, and was being groomed, he said,for Intelligence School. At first glance, the UFO in this case seems to be a military device, perhaps one of U.S. manufacture or by some foreign power. Whatever it was, according to RK, theUFO caused enough concern to the U. S. Navy to shoot it down with a surface-to-airmissile, retrieve it from the ocean and ship it secretly by rail to the Great LakesNaval base where it was put under heavy guard. My informant, RK, who came to my home with researcher Don Jernigan ofColumbus, Ohio, July 14, 1980, to relate his role in this case, said he believed that itwas 'by coincidence' that he guarded the same object in Chicago allegedly shot downby a Navy destroyer in the Pacific. In September 1973, according to RK, while an Instructor in Gunnery School, he wasassigned to guard the premises of a large quonset hut at Great Lakes Naval Base,with orders not to let anybody within 100 yards. At one point while on duty, he was approached by an officer in a jeep who handedhim a sealed envelope and was directed to deliver it to the Commandant in thequonset hut. Passing other guards inside, he was surprised to see a strange metalliccraft, 30 feet long and 10 feet high, resting on a wooden platform. 'It was light silvery blue and shimmering,' said RK. He added: 'It tapered like atear-drop with a flange running along its topside from one end to the other and therewere no windows.' With guards watching, he said, he could not linger for a betterlook. Delivering the sealed envelop, he got the Commandant's signature of receipt,saluted and returned to his post, feeling puzzled. Immediately coming to mind was astory he had heard from a sailor he met in San Diego, just weeks earlier while onspecial assignment there. Said RK, 'The object was strikingly similar to one he wasguarding, according to the sailor (name not recalled by RK), that was shot down bya missile between Hawaii and the mainland in June 1973. The UFO was picked upby his destroyer's radar and came into view making three close passes and onedirectly over the vessel. It was a lucky hit ,said the sailor, causing the UFO to crashinto waters that were about 350 feet deep. According to RK's informant, the objectwas retrieved by a Glomar Explorer shipped to Hawaii and then sent Stateside andfinally to Chicago. A sketch of the craft was drawn by the sailor and, according toRK, there was 'little doubt' that it was the same object he had seen in the quonsethut. COMMENT: Viewing RK's sketch of the object, it certainly was not the typical"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"discoidal or ellipsoidal UFO. If true that the UFO passed menacingly over a U. S.warship, it seems to rule out a secret U. S. aircraft. And if it were a robot device,used for missile practice, why the retrieval operation and subsequent secrecy?Russian? Hardly. It would be extremely risky for a surveillance device to fly so closeto a U. S. warship in waters near the U.S.A. When I mentioned this incident to aperson who claimed to be an 'Insider' (at one time at Wright-Patterson), I was toldthat he knew of no incident where a UFO had been shot down by U. S. warships atsea. RK described his sailor source as being a credible person. Perhaps his sourcewas actually performing in an Intelligence role as a test for RK's later position inNavy Intelligence. CASE A-8: Hillsdale and Dexter, Michigan, famous for the misinformation of \"swamp gas\"explanation used by astronomer and Project Blue Book consultant, J. Allen Hynek, Ph.D.,to explain 100-foot-diameter glowing disc/s seen in 1966. This case, occurring in Hillsdale and Dexter, Michigan, 1966, is better rememberedin UFO research lore for its cover-up explanation: 'Swamp Gas.' The alleged UFOlandings there had many ramifications. There was embarrassment for Dr. J. AllenHynek, then U.S. Air Force consultant on Project Blue Book, for the mix-up over hisreferences to 'swamp gas' at a press conference. There was also Gerald Ford'sdissatisfaction with the official explanation and his request for a Congressionalinquiry. This, in turn, so say UFO analysts, helped bring into being the ColoradoProject (headed by Dr. Condon) which led to the demise of Project Bluebook.Although this case is well known to research, only a few might know some of thebehind-scenes operations. My informant who knew firsthand the behind scenes story of the landed craft inDexter, and the methods employed in its cover-up, is FB - a former law enforcementofficer (name withheld on request). Arrangements for me to discuss his first personrole, March 12, 1980, were made by James Minton, a pharmacist in Norris City,Illinois. According to FB, on March 21, 1966, at 6:20 p.m., he and officer 'C' on patrol, werefirst to see the alien craft on the ground of farm property in a clearing of swamp.From a distance of about 150 yards, they estimated that the object was about 100feet in diameter. They also observed that cattle in the area were restless and noisy,some scampering among the herd. FB reported the landing to the Sheriff (namewithheld) who put in an urgent call to Selfridge AFB. In quick response, elements ofthe National Guard and Air Force personnel were rushed to the area - many arrivingby helicopter. Some were assigned to control highway traffic; others to prevent amob of curious people who heard about the UFO, from trying to reach the site. Theclearing in the swamp was hard to reach by road, said FB, but he knew the area wellas he had hunted there - and, yes, he was aware of 'fox fire' or 'swamp gas.' 'What I saw was not fox fire,' he emphasized. 'This was definitely a large craft, like apot, with a dull glow and no windows.' He added, 'A pool of water near it sizzled,causing vapor to rise.' Asked about a sound, he said: 'Sounded like a turbine, a lowwhine or hum.' When the Air Force came and took charge about 7:30 p.m., they ordered all thepolice at the site to withdraw and stay away. MPs were everywhere, he said, andwell armed. Photos were taken by one officer who waded into the marsh for aclose-up had his film confiscated. Said FB, Air Force officers, however, took manyphotographs, including shots from a helicopter."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Nothing was left undone, said FB, where it concerned security. The area wasbarricaded, or roped off, for three weeks and the farmer was ordered to stay away.Maybe because it was contaminated, he said. Where the object landed, there was acircle in a soybean plot that was burned. Soil samples were taken. Then the wholearea was bulldozed, including the soybean field. Everything was hush-hush, said FB.Police reports, his report and the records in the sheriff's office disappeared. Then,everyone in the force, including him and 'C,' were transferred to other parts of thecountry. The UFO was not disabled, as far as FB knew, although there was a suspicion that itmight be and that it could be captured. 'But no one got it,' he said. 'I saw it take offand climb straight up into the sky and disappear. Swamp gas does not do that,' saidFB. COMMENT: No crashed UFO; no retrieval in Dexter, Michigan. If the craft wasdisabled to account for its long stay, it was not seriously impaired. This case pointsout, however, the extenuating security measures taken by the U. S. Air Force at alanding or crash site. CASE A-9: The complexity of the UFO mystery is well illustrated in this report by veteranresearcher, Tommy Blann of Lewisville, Texas. His ability to dig deeper, beyond topsoil, for facts is self-evident in the following report dated March 30, 1982, whichsheds new light on joint UFO and helicopter activity observed in Texas.Tommy Blann, March 30, 1982: 'There have been a number of incrediblestories surfacing over the years by active military personnel on duty at FortHood and by civilians employed at the base or their immediate familymembers about a huge underground complex built in the side of a small hill inwhich a camouflaged section of land opens up like 'sliding doors' to reveal anentrance to this secret installation. Over the years, I ran into several individuals who told me bits and piecesabout this secret underground complex and others scattered across the U. S.,none of them knowing each other nor what the others had related to me. Thisinformation, like a lot of information in the possession of individualresearchers, was recorded and filed away as confidential for future reference.It was not until certain information surfaced about 'crashed discs' by LeonardStringfield and other less known individuals, plus the recent Cash/Landrumincident investigated by John Schuessler that I felt compelled to release thisinformation publicly. It is my personal opinion that these individuals have told me the truth as theyknow it, and it would be hard to conceive how a number of individuals couldconcoct such stories in identical detail unless there is some truth in the basis oftheir claims. There are also three incidents involving helicopters around lowlevel UFOs, one incident which I personally witnessed, that adds furthercredence to the claims made in this report. Located in Central Texas is a large Army military reservation known as FortHood which covers approximately 160,000 acres and is surrounded by severalsmall towns such as Copperas Cove, Gatesville, Killeen, Temple and Belton. Itwas originally named Camp Hood, after John Bell Hood, and during WorldWar II served as a training center for tank destroyers. It is well-known for itsmilitary training for ground troops, heavy artillery exercises and war gameswhich have been viewed by a number of dignitaries and presidents over theyears. Within Fort Hood is Gray AAF, known as Robert Gray Field, where AFpersonnel are attached while at Fort Hood. Little is known about the activitiesat Gray AAF as it is not a major AFB and is not listed in either the Air ForceOfficer's Guide or the Air Force Almanac."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Gray Air Force Base shown in 1979 Atlas. An Air Force Captain, while stationed at Fort Hood in 1972, told me that inthe late 1960s a pilot had to make a forced landing over this restricted aircorridor (at Gray) and as his small private plane came in for a landing on adusty field, the next thing he saw was an approaching jeep with armed MPswhich seemed to have appeared out of nowhere. On further observation bythe pilot, he saw a huge section of land separating like 'giant sliding doors'with vegetation intact revealing a huge corridor inside. The startled pilot was then met with weapons trained on him and ordered outof the plane where he was immediately blindfolded and taken in the jeep towhat he thought was this underground complex. He was taken down a longcorridor and led into a room where his blindfold was taken off. Inside theroom, which reminded him of a modern conference room without windows,he was interrogated by a couple of men. A few hours later was blindfoldedagain and taken outside to his aircraft which had been refueled and was nowoperating. He was warned not to speak of this incident as they helped him intothe aircraft and watched him take off.\" Continued in Part 5 - Fort Hood's Link to Other UFO IncidentsCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
