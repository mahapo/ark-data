But now there is a new book recentlypublished by VH1 and Pocket Books entitled Alien Rock: The Rock 'n' RollExtraterrestrial Connection by Michael Luckman. Mr. Luckman grew up in New Yorkand in the early 1970s was Director of Publications for the New School for SocialResearch in Manhattan. He also taught a college level course there about rock music andedited a newspaper called The New York Daily Planet. The 1970s were full of UFO andhuman abduction stories and Michael Luckman started collecting reports including insidertales about the link between some of the greatest rock stars and UFOs. Now he is Directorof the New York Center for Extraterrestrial Research.This week I asked him which rock star he thinks has had the strongest link to anextraterrestrial presence.Interview:Michael Luckman, Author, Alien Rock: The Rock 'n' Roll Extraterrestrial Connection,and Director of the New York Center for Extraterrestrial Research, New York, NewYo r k: \"The strongest link and there are many strong links but the strongest link if I had topick one is Elvis Presley. That coincides with the 50 year-plus rock and roll extraterrestrialconnection I talk about in my book, Alien Rock.Elvis Presley's Encounter with \"Beings of Light\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Rock star, Elvis Aaron Presley, January 8, 1935 - August 16, 1977.Photo and statistics from Fiftiesweb.com.\"- Elvis Presley is the best selling solo artist In U.S. History.- Elvis charted more songs on Billboard's Hot 100 than any other artist.

It started when he was born, according toVernon Presley, his father. There was a strange blue light seen over his home in Tupelo,Mississippi, at the exact moment that he came into this world, perhaps from another world.Elvis had UFO sightings throughout his lifetime, many more than the average person wouldhope to have. Elvis, as a child, was communicated to, apparently, by two cosmic beings oflight, maybe when Elvis was six or seven. This according to Wanda June Hill, who was avery close friend of Elvis one of the last people to talk to him before he died. Wandainterviewed Elvis over the phone and there are audiotapes that exist of those discussions.WHAT WERE THE DETAILS OF THE FIRST CHILDHOOD ENCOUNTER WITH THELIGHT BEINGS?They were beings of light that showed him what the future would be like. As a child, hedidn't realize what he was seeing, but they showed him like a motion picture, a littlesnippet of what his future would be like. He sees a man on stage in a white jumpsuit and hedoes not realize it, but figures out later that's himself. It also showed someone who wasinvolved with karate. There was enough there that he began to understand it was him hewas actually seeing. They informed him, and he believed, that he came from a blue starplanet located in the Orion constellation.When this story got out, some of the die-hard Elvis fans and media were playing aroundwith it and trying to suggest that Elvis was an alien. Well, no one's saying he's an alien, buthe did believe he did have origin from off planet Earth.WHAT DID HE UNDERSTAND THE BEINGS TO BE EXACTLY AND WHY WERETHEY FOCUSING ON HIM HERE ON EARTH?I don't think he had a clue when he was a child, but what he came to believe was that theywere monitoring us and that they were essentially representatives of God.AND YET, THEY TOLD HIM THAT HE AND THE BEINGS WERE FROM A BLUESTAR SYSTEM IN ORION?That's correct.GIVEN THE FACT THAT SUGGESTS A SOLAR SYSTEM AND NOT THE WHOLE"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"UNIVERSE AT A GOD LEVEL, WHAT DID HE SAY LATER ABOUT THIS ISSUE OFEXTRATERRESTRIALS BEING INVOLVED WITH THIS PLANET AND WITH HIM?Elvis wanted to be what amounts to a modern day musical Messiah. He was not using thatword, but he would go and wanted to go to the Middle East and try to use his status to tryto bring about peace in the Middle East and put his show business career on hold. This wasthe very thing that Col. Tom Parker was so upset about.His (Elvis's) interest, by the way, extended to according to Wanda June Hill, who I believeis legitimate the apparent ability to physically move objects. She claimed he was at hishome in Graceland and actually was able to move a large green ashtray which she still hasfrom one end of the coffee table to the other. This was after she asked Elvis about whetherhe believed in levitation.AND HE JUST DEMONSTRATED.And he demonstrated it.DID HE GIVE ANY DETAILS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN HE WAS 6 OR 7YEARS OLD, WHAT WAS HE DOING WHEN THE BEINGS FIRST SHOWED UP?When he was a kid, he felt he had been communicated to by Jesus. He started to say thatand his parents I think, his father, punished him and put him in a closet, a cloths closet, topunish him because he was saying this. They did not believe his words. But he said, 'I'veseen Jesus.'IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE SHOWING HIM A MOVIE IN HIS HEAD OF WHAT HEINTERPRETED TO BE HIS LIFE?Ye s .

Jerry Garcia reported that for two days, he waslocked in what he called 'a futuristic spaceship with insectoid presences.'INSECTOIDS.Insectoids. He described them as rather large beings and I imagine that what he meant wassomething along the line of large praying mantis-type beings or something like that whichhas been reported from time to time.THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE HAVEDESCRIBED THE SO-CALLED ANT BEINGS AS TALL, THIN GREYS. BUT THEPRAYING MANTIS IS A DIFFERENT GROUP. I WONDER IF HE DREW ANYTHINGOR MADE ANY OTHER DETAILS?He did not draw anything, but he spoke about he was asked when he was interviewed hisexperience and connection with DMT. DMT is a substance that is a heavy psychedelicsubstance. There has been a study done of individuals who were put on DMT with theapproval of the FDA for experimental purposes. What was found was that the DMTreplicates the pineal gland. What they found was that almost every person who was part ofthe experiment reported having real or felt were real contact experiences with alien beings.DID THEY DESCRIBE ALWAYS THE SAME TYPE?I think they did, but I don't know if it matched what Garcia was talking about.WHAT YEAR WAS HIS ABDUCTION?I would say it was most likely in the 1970s. He also talked about having communication whether from that encounter or other encounters with beings that he felt were highlyadvanced.DID HE DESCRIBE THEM?No, he did not describe them.Jimi Hendrix and Band Saved ByTall Being from Acorn-Shaped UFORock star, Jimi Hendrix, November 27, 1942 - September 18, 1970.Photo from Allposte rs.com.

Over 300 previously unreleased piecesof material, have appeared and more to come.\"\"Jimmy Hendrix was involved with the subject so much that when he passed on, hisfather, Al Hendrix, commissioned a sculpture. I don't know where that sculpture ispresently. But it was originally intended for his grave site. It was a sculpture of a flyingsaucer, a large metallic sculpture. So, he was very much into this from the time he was ingrade school and on. He saw a UFO at the time and many people did during the filming ofthe Rainbow Bridge Concert in Hawaii.There was another incident that happened that was more shocking that happenedapparently in Woodstock, New York not connected to the concert. But the band wasreturning home. It was a winter night and the car was stalled in a snowstorm. Thetemperature was going lower and they did not know what they were going to do. Theywere even worried about whether they would survive it.According to Curtis Knight, who was very close to Jimmy one of the band people and whodiscovered Jimmy when he had a group called \"Curtis Knight and the Squires\" it was anacorn-shaped UFO landed near the car several hundred yards away. A very tall being ofsome kind came out, sort of glided toward the car. At that point, they felt the temperaturewas getting warmer and then hotter. All the snow melted. The being was seen apparentlylooking at Jimmy and Jimmy looking at the being through the car window and the feelingwas that there was some kind of telepathic communication going on.The being then left and got back into the craft and the craft disappeared and Curtis Knightfelt this literally saved their lives.AND DID JIMMY HENDRIX SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT WAS THETELEPATHIC DOWNLOAD?No, he never did.

They started the band shortlythereafter,due to their mutual love of rock & roll and blues.- Jagger then attended the London School of Economics, where he studiedHistory and Literature (and not Economics as widely believed).- During the 1960s he was linked romantically with Chrissie Shrimpton,(the sister of supermodel Jean Shrimpton) and then with singer Marianne Faithfull, forwhomJagger and Richards composed several songs, including her signature tune, As Tears GoBy. They remaineda couple until late 1969, when Jagger and Faithfull traveled to Australia to star in the TonyRichardsonfilm Ned Kelly.

But hecertainly did have an experience when he was out with his then girlfriend, MarianneFaithful, on a skywatch in the English countryside. They saw, and there were otherwitnesses, a wide cigar-shaped mothership that other people saw as well. He had a UFOdetector in one of his estates in England. They were popular at the time.

Both of his parents had musicalbackgrounds and experience, though neither pursued them seriously.- Lennon developed severe myopia as he grew up, and was obliged to wear glasses inorder to see clearly.During his early Beatle career, Lennon wore contacts or prescription sunglasses (or simply\"toughed it out\"without them). In 1966, on the set of How I Won Th e War, Lennon was issued a pair ofNational Health spectacles.He continued to wear these round, wire-rimmed glasses which became part of his iconicpublic image.- John's mother, Julia, was responsible for introducing her son to a lifelong interest inmusicby teaching him how to play the banjo. On July 15, 1958 - when Lennon was 17 - hismother was killedafter she was struck by a car driven by a drunken off-duty police officer, and he had to goto the morgue to identifyher body. Julia's death was one of the factors that cemented his friendship with PaulMcCartney, who had lost his own mother to breast cancer in 1956, when Paul was 14.Years later, Lennon wrote the songs \"Julia\", \"Mother\" and \"My Mummy's Dead\" regardinghis mother, as well as naming his firstborn son, Julian, after her.- John devoted himself to music, inspired by American Rock 'n' Roll and singers like ElvisPresley,Chuck Berry and Buddy Holly. He'd started a skiffle band in grammar school called theQuarry Men(after his alma mater, Quarry Bank). With the addition of Paul McCartney and GeorgeHarrison, the bandchanged to playing rock 'n' roll, taking the name \"Johnny and the Moondogs\", followed by\"The Silver Beetles\"(a tribute to Buddy Holly's Crickets), which was later shortened to The Beatles.- In early 1960s, John Lennon had a profound influence on rock and roll and in expandingthe genre'sboundaries. He is widely considered, along with songwriting partner Paul McCartney, asone of themost influential singer-songwriter-musicians of the 20th century. Many of the songswritten by Lennon,however, are more introspective - often in the first person - and personal thanMcCartney's. His mostsurreal pieces of songwriting, \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" and \"I Am the Walrus\",are fine examples of his unique style.- Lennon often spoke his mind freely to the press. On March 4, 1966, in an interview fortheLondon Evening Standard with reporter Maureen Cleave, who was a friend of his, Lennonmade an off the cuff remark regarding religion. The article was printed and nothing cameof it, until five months later when a teen magazine reprinted the words: \"I don't know whatwill go first - Rock and Roll or Christianity. We're more popular than Jesus now.\"- Of the four former Beatles, Lennon had perhaps the most varied recording career. Whilehe was still a Beatle,"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Lennon and Ono recorded three albums of experimental and difficult electronic music,Unfinished Music No.1:Two Vi r g i n s, Unfinished Music No.2: Life with the Lions, and Wedding Album. His first'solo' album of popularmusic was Live Peace in Toronto 1969, recorded in 1969 (prior to the breakup of theBeatles) at the Rock 'n' RollFestival in Toronto with The Plastic Ono Band, which included Eric Clapton and KlausVoormann. He also recordedthree singles in his initial solo phase, the anti-war anthem \"Give Peace a Chance\", \"ColdTurke y\"(about his struggles with heroin addiction) and \"Instant Karma!\".- In the late afternoon of December 8, 1980, in New York City, deranged fan Mark DavidChapmanassassinated John Lennon near John and Yoko Ono's Dakota apartment.\"\"John Lennon subscribed to flying saucer magazines for a very long period of time. Hefelt very much different than a lot of people and he thought he might have perhaps been anabductee himself, although there was nothing specific to connect him to that. But he feltthat perhaps he was.He had a sighting when he was living with his then girlfriend, Mai Ping, on Manhattan'sUpper East Side. The two of them happened to be dressed and they saw from theirpenthouse rooftop apartment a flying saucer at very close range, maybe several hundredfeet long. It was quite large. He described it as being saucer-shaped with lights around therim and a red light on top, capable of holding perhaps two human-sized passengers. He wasvery excited about it. He could not stop yelling, 'I've seen a flying saucer! I've seen a flyingsaucer!' He could not get over it. He called the local newspapers. There had been a fewreports of a UFO that night. They took some pictures, but unfortunately, they did not turnout. He went to great lengths to say that he was not on any substance at the time thathappened. He was very strongly into the subject. He mentions on one of his albums thatthere are UFOs over New York, 'and I ain't too surprised' were the exact words that heused.'I AIN'T TOO SURPRISED.' MEANING HE EXPECTS THEM TO BE THERESOMEWHERE.Yes. Now, there was a more extraordinary, more recent sighting that happened to John,according to Uri Geller, the psychic. It's an amazing story and I don't know what to makeof it, frankly. But Uri claims that John told him they were close friends that John wasasleep at the Dakota (apartments) and he saw a light coming through from around the doorof his apartment. Yoko Ono, his wife, was asleep in bed. He got out of bed and opened thedoor and was met by three or four small alien beings, presumably greys, with spindly armsand legs. They had some kind of communication with him. It's not exactly clear what wascommunicated, but they gave him a gift, if you will. They left him with something, anobject, which he gave to Uri Geller. This all happened weeks before he was assassinated.The object is a small, smooth, round, egg-shaped ball, metallic. Uri still has it. So far, hestill hasn't been willing to have it analyzed. I think that's a mistake because if it issomething real and is not on the Periodic Table of Elements and it's by its nature,extraterrestrial, then it's the ultimate extraterrestrial evidence. He hasn't been willing tohave it tested. That's a mistake.DID URI GELLER SHOW YOU THE OBJECT?No, he hasn't shown me the object, but I've seen a photograph of him holding the object.It's quite small, maybe a couple of inches tall. It's a metallic, brass-color, egg-shapedobject.SO IT SITS SORT OF VERTICALLY AS OPPOSED TO HORIZONTALLY?That's right.DID HE, URI GELLER, SUGGEST THAT HE KNOWS, OR JOHN LENNON TOLDHIM, WHAT THIS OBJECT IS SUPPOSED TO DO?He said that he felt there was more to it, that John had not told him much about it, but thatUri thought it had some deep meaning, but he never got it out of John.WHY WOULD JOHN LENNON HAVE GIVEN A GIFT FROM EXTRATERRESTRIALGREYS TO URI GELLER?That's a very good question. I'll have to ask Uri that. I have no idea. they were very, very"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"close. In fact, they used to meet once a week at the Sherry Netherlands restaurant todiscuss UFOs and the paranormal.WAS THERE ANY CONSENSUS OUT OF THIS RESEARCH ABOUT ROCK STARSHAVING INTERACTIONS WITH PERCEIVED NON-HUMANS, A CONSENSUSABOUT WHAT IT IS THAT THE NON-HUMANS WANT AND WHY DON'T THEYJUST PHYSICALLY SHOW UP HERE?I think they are involved in a process. In one chapter, I call 'EMF, or ExtraterrestrialMusical Forces,' which is a term I coined it turns out that many major rock stars describedthe song writing process as not only being mystical, but furthermore, that they feel they arechanneling the music. this includes the Beatles. Paul McCartney cannot read or writemusic. Jimmy Hendrix could not read or write music. This includes a whole lot of people.Not only are they channeling the music and not knowing where the music and lyrics arecoming from, but they are also over and over again, you have major artists talking abouthow the music on stage when they are doing a performance, how they are not in control ofit. They are along for the ride. You hear that repeated over and over again. This goes on tothe extreme of people on stage in a major band, or bands, where there might be 6 or 8musicians on stage where music is being played. They have no idea where the music iscoming from. They know where some of the music is coming from, but there is other musicthat they don't feel they are creating.IF THE MAJOR ROCK STAR GROUPS WERE CHANNELING INFORMATION FROMEXTRATERRESTRIALS OR OTHER DIMENSIONALS, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IN2005 IS THE LEGACY OF ALL THAT CHANNELED MUSIC?I really don't know. That is the billion dollar question. I think that it's something that has toplay out. My hunch is that it's going to play out in the near future.\"More Information:Michael Luckman's newly released book is available now at amazon.com, Barnes & Nobleand local bookstores.Alien Rock: The Rock 'n' Roll ExtraterrestrialConnection © 2005 by Michael Luckman.
