Andrew KissnerReturn to Part 1Update: I received the e-mail below from an Earthfiles reader who has researchedextensively the history of rocket development in the United States. E-mail December 22, 2005 to Earthfiles: \"Top Sail Island, North Carolina, was the first location that the military tested therocket program pre-dating White Sands by some years. The military wants us tothink that the first rockets were tested at White Sands, but \"Project Bumblebee\"shows that the U.S. had missiles long before they got to White Sands.\"This would probably be the first time that has ever been reported and I feel it ismost important because if you and anyone would try to establish that the military\"shot\" the UFO's down, someone on the skeptical side would say \"we did not haverockets that were that advanced back then\". I've heard people say that before. Thiswould also back up all of Andy's good work as well.\"I traveled out to Top Sail Island a few years ago. The old bunkers and viewingtowers are still there as well as a museum that has a very nice display and a moviethat shows the old rocket tests. I asked the curator of the museum if most people areshocked to learn that White Sands was NOT the first test site and he told me thateven retired military people from that time frame are shocked and fascinated whenthey learn how much rocket research and development went on there. The operationwas run by John Hopkins University as a cover back then.\"The reason they moved to White Sands was the fact that the rockets were gettingso advanced they were in danger of hitting the fishing fleets of the coast !!!!! ( theyfelt they could not keep it a secret with the new range of the new technology.\" Also see: December 4, 2004, Earthfiles about Project Bumblebee: According to history written by the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum,\"In July 1944, the Navy's Bureau of Ordnance requested Section T of the Office ofScientific Research and Development (OSRD) to study anti-aircraft missiles tocounteract the Japanese Ohka piloted bombs and other suicide weapons sent againstthe United States in the Pacific. The requirement was for a missile to shoot down aplane at a range of 20,000 yards at an altitude of 30,000 feet.\" Four months later by November 1944, the Navy's Bureau of Ordnance assigned theApplied Physics Laboratory of the Johns Hopkins University in Silver Spring,Maryland, to undertake the development of radar-guided surface-to-air missiles.This project became known as Bumblebee which produced several ramjet-poweredmissiles which evolved from the 1945 STV to the 1951 Terrier to the 1958 Talos."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Original full-scale replica of America's first surface-to-air missile, the Supersonic Test Vehicle (STV),called Bumblebee, or the \"Flying Stovepipe.\" Demonstration flight was on October 16, 1945, Island Beach,New Jersey,and reached 1400 mph. Produced by Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Baltimore,Maryland.J. Andrew Kissner Introduction from Part 1, Peculiar Phenomenon, continued: The Air Force's 1994 \"Research Regarding the Roswell incident\" did not mention severalinteresting points of fact that haven't been mentioned by anyone for half a century. Evenin 1947, few heard about these details. They were only reported in local area newspapers.These stories for some reason never found their way to the national or even regionalmedia.A commander of a U. S. Army installation, 120 miles south of the Roswell crash site,reported six days before Mac Brazel found a crashed flying disc that two U. S. Armypersonnel had seen two different flying discs about to crash. One was observed lessthan 60 miles south of the Mac Brazel ranch crash site.The same commander reported that he had ordered U. S. Army search parties to findtwo crashed flying discs outside the perimeter of his installation six days before MacBrazel found his.The U. S. Air Force asserted in their 1994 report that no U. S. Army Air Forceaircraft were involved in accidents in the Roswell area during the July 1947 period.However, research reveals that a U. S. Air Force P-80A jet fighter, serial numbereither PN-343 or PN-349, attempted to take off from an improvised landing strip ona New Mexico state highway less than 25 miles from the flying disc crash site. Thejet failed to gain altitude on take off and flew directly into a gas station killing thepilot, a civilian and injuring three other civilians. That location was Carrizozo.The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) sponsored a meeting with all local arealaw enforcement officers covering a four county area of rural, central New Mexicoon July 21, 1947. The meeting location was near the Roswell flying disc crash siteand where the P-80 crashed. The FBI encouraged local police to cooperate withfederal initiatives in the area.The Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) announced three days after the recoveryoperation was under way north of Carrizozo that the public was not invited into thearea due to \"continuing radiation studies.\"The Air Material Command (AMC) based at Wright Field, Ohio, deployed theUnited States's first surface-to-air missile system to southern New Mexico and westTexas during this same period from a test site at Wendover Field, Utah.The U. S.'s first operational surface-to-air missile battalion was activated at least 60days prior to the reported flying disc crashes in central New Mexico at a site lessthan 150 miles south of the crash sites.That control of Alamogordo Army Air Field 80 miles south of the purported flyingdisc crash site was transferred to the AMC in the summer of 1947.The Commanding General responsible for the new surface-to-air missile system wastransferred to the U. S. Special Weapons Project at Sandia Base in Albuquerque. The"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"General was responsible for \"special weapons\" security four days after thepurported flying disc crash at Corona.The Commander of White Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico, Lt.

General.U. S. Army Ordnance's elite weapons intelligence unit, Enemy EquipmentIntelligence Section (EEIS), was based at Ft. Bliss, Texas, and White Sands ProvingGround, New Mexico, in 1947. Its sole purpose was and is to \"collect\" advancedforeign technology for U. S. government researchers. The technology was analyzedto determine performance characteristics so that technological advances could beeventually integrated into U. S. weapons systems. The U. S. V-2 program, theprecursor to both the U. S. space program and U. S. effort to build and deployintercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) was a project area of EEIS, headed by thelegendary Col. Holger Toftoy at Ft. Bliss, Texas, in the summer of 1947.[ Editor's Note: Colonel Holger N. Toftoy was the Chief of Ordnance TechnicalIntelligence for the U. S. in Paris at the end of World War II. Col. Toftoycommanded the transfer of rocket hardware and documents from German scientiststo the United States. That process included one-year contracts from the U. S. Armyto German physicist, Werner von Braun, and his 126 colleagues in what was firstcalled Project Overcast and later Project Paperclip. Most of the 127 Germanscientists were transported to Fort Bliss, Texas, by December 1945, where the U. S.Army established a guided missile proving ground that worked closely with theWhite Sands Missile Range in southern New Mexico. Then Col.

That panel was the Upper Atmosphere Rocket ResearchPanel, the same group responsible for V-2 rocket testing at White Sands ProvingGround, New Mexico, in the summer of 1947.Historical research suggests something even more controversial.

Whatever flying discs were, or are, they were not, and are not,defenseless. Their \"special weapons\" were unconventional by every definition.Flying discs were immediately defined by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1947 asadvanced \"foreign weapons systems.\" due to flying disc performance characteristics,it was immediately assumed they were nuclear powered.1946: Planes, Rockets, SatellitesDiagram © RMC,Time Magazine, September 2, 1946. The \"Roswell/Corona UFO crash\" was one of the first catastrophic military encounterswith the alien technology and is the most well-documented case of U. S. governmentinvolvement available in the public domain. Flying discs were believed to have beendefined by the Joint Chiefs of Staff before the Roswell incident as an advanced \"foreignweapons system.\" This definition immediately cloaked the phenomenon in the highestcompartmentalized security classification in the United States lexicon concerning nationalsecurity: a foreign, probably nuclear powered, weapons system. Let's assume that a flying disc did crash southeast of Corona, New Mexico. Why did itcrash? Who were the military personnel and civilians at the scene? How did it get there?Where did it go? Who has it now? Some answers to those questions emerge in PeculiarPhenomenon."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Also consider how important such a discovery might have been. On a scale of one to tenwith ten being the most significant, how important is the knowledge that non-humanintelligent life exits? Let's assume the non-humans control technology that is moreadvanced than our own. would it be a three or a seven on the significance scale? Or is itpossible that our national leadership might consider the discovery so important andpotentially so threatening to the U. S. national security that the U. S. would create anentirely new military/security system to maintain that secret? Throw in the additional consideration that the technology can appear anywhere at anytime without regard to national borders, security systems, defensive weapons, weather, orany other apparent physical constraints. How important do you think that kind ofdiscovery would be? What level of classification would you give that knowledge? Let usassume one other thing: that flying discs possess offensive weapons that we did not, andstill do not, totally understand. In addition, assume that they have demonstrated awillingness to use them - not randomly - but specifically against the United States. Howimportant is this knowledge? How threatening is this knowledge? These questions revealthe perspective of American national security policy makers since at least the 1940s. Peculiar Phenomenon is the result of my research project intended to provide an overviewof a five month period: May, June, July, August and September 1947. This researchintroduces the principals, complete with motives, involved in covert actions to collect andanalyze the enigma known as flying discs, flying saucers, photographic meteorites, upperatmospheric anomalies, UFOs, UFObs, Unidentified Aerial Vehicles (AEVs), UnidentifiedAerial Craft (AECs) or whatever other term is applicable. This book is intended toestablish a framework for understanding the U. S. government's involvement. The story isbased upon published accounts of the period, coupled with selected other materials thathave only been publicly available beginning in the early 1990s. I have learned that truth isstranger than fiction. The term \"flying disc\" is used exclusively throughout this work. It is descriptive and wasthe original term employed by eyewitnesses to describe what had been observed.Beginning on June 24, 1947, and continuing through mid-July 1947, eyewitnesses in thewestern United States and then the rest of North America were describing \"flying discs.\" In daylight sightings, flying discs were described as being lens-shaped, like two convexlenses fitted together at their outer edges. When not illuminated, the flying discs weredescribed as looking like \"brushed aluminum,\" stainless steel or other silver or graymetallic material. When traveling at high speed, the discs would sometimes emit an orangeor white glow and occasionally a blue, glowing tail. When hovering, the discs moved in apeculiar weaving motion, \"like the tail of a kite\" or \"falling lea,\" skipping from onelocation to another in the sky at very high speed. at night, the discs were often described aslooking like the headlight of an automobile, a full moon, or a star. The discs could hover,move slowly or at hyper-velocity. Some would hover for several minutes and then gainaltitude with incredible acceleration and disappear, only to reappear again. Others wereseen with a row of lights on the upper convex surface when viewed at close range. Attimes, one large flying disc would appear to burst into three or more separate piecesheading off in different directions. At times, in both total daylight and at night, the discswould be so bright that eyewitnesses thought the light would blind them. In all cases, thediscs emitted no audible sound, either from a propulsion system, or when the discsaccelerated. There was no confusion regarding the physical phenomenon: people said theysaw \"flying discs.\" Only toward the middle of the \"great flying disc scare\" of 1947 was the term \"flyingsaucer\" coined by General Nathan Twining (MJ-4) and the U. S. Army Air Forces. Muchlater, they were referred to by the U. S. Air Force as \"Unidentified Flying Objects(UFObs),\" a much less precise term. It appears that flying discs were photographed,inspected, disassembled, blueprinted and warehoused by representatives of the President,the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Atomic Energy commission in 1947. All that was retrievedhas remained in U. S. custody for more than half a century. In many respects, efforts to explain the flying discs crash at Corona (Roswell) orelsewhere tend to overlook the obvious. Who is responsible for collecting all foreignweapons technology flying disc or otherwise? Military intelligence organizationssupported by specialized military units. Who is responsible for analyzing all high, foreign,weapons technology? Relevant government research laboratories in collaboration withprivate and university labs. Who was made responsible for all nuclear weapons, nucleartechnology and nuclear materials in the U. S. in the first four decades of the nuclearera? The Atomic Energy Commission by authority of the Atomic Energy Act of August 1,1946, and subsequent amendments (See Appendix VII). The U. S. Department of Energy"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"subsequently assumed the AEC's role within the past decade. Obfuscation of thesefundamental responsibilities serves the interest of those keeping this secret. The answer tothe question is a specialized military unit supported by a scientific group, working with alaboratory administered by the AEC or, at a higher level, the National Security Council or,one level higher still, either the Office of the Executive Secretary of the National SecurityCouncil (NSC) or its Chairman. The NSC, discussed also as the \"permanent staff\" of theWhite House, is the ultimate organization, created one month after the recovery of theNew Mexico flying discs, who is responsible for managing and maintaining U. S. nationalsecurity interests (See Appendix VIII.) Flying discs organizationally appear to hover inclose proximity to the permanent staff to the White House. What else would you expect? This is not the approach used in this project, but it does simplify the question. Rather thehistory of the era has been dissected and reassembled using published reports from\"newspapers of record\" correlated with recently declassified government documents andnewly published authorized histories of several national research institutions. Correlation,as a research technique, is particularly useful when the subject being considered deals withgovernment decision makers, who normally leave published detailed biographies and withthe formation of public policy that, under normal circumstances, generates volumes ofdocumentation. Applying this technique, the researcher possesses one overall assumption observed eventsoccur that require explanation at the time of the event. The physical description of theevent can be assumed to be relatively accurate, but the explanation of the cause of theevent might be assumed to be inaccurate and possibly intentionally misleading. Using thetechnique, comparing the observed physical events of 1947 to the explanations availabletoday, yields a somewhat more coherent understanding of the eras history than wasprovided to the public in 1947. It is particularly useful when two official documents orsources of information are at odds with each other - it points to an event, a relationship, orinformation that is potentially intentionally misrepresented and because it is beingintentionally misrepresented it might be significant in explaining what actually occurred. It appears that beginning in early June 1947, there was a major misinformation campaignwaged by the U. S. Army's Psychological Strategy Board, authorized initially by the JointChiefs of Staff (JCS) and eventually by the President. By June 25, 1947, significant eventswere occurring, reported in local newspapers, that weren't reported in the national media.Specifically this relates to reports of aircraft accidents. The footprints left by thoseengaged in this activity are visible today. It was organized at the national level. Interviewsconducted in the field confirm that instructions were given by military officials to civilianeyewitnesses not to report what they had seen, that the event was a matter of nationalsecurity - it was, to quote a local New Mexico weekly newspaper published during thoseweeks - a \"military emergency.\" There is little question that due to the inherent weaknesses of the correlation analyticaltechnique, which necessarily generates rather broad associations, there could be someinterpretive inaccuracies. The strength of the technique, however, is that it points to majorpotential relationships that should be considered by the reader. It should be rememberedthat this process is similar to putting a jigsaw puzzle together without benefit of having apicture of the assembled puzzle. There is no question that it's bizarre. There is also noquestion that by mid-June 1947, in the words of one unidentified White House assistant toPresident Truman, \"something is radically wrong.\" Examining events which occurred in mid-1947 yielded a clearer understanding than laterperiods because the intelligence infrastructure created to suppress public accounts of thisphenomenon was not in place back then. Later attempts to cover-up what had beenpublished in the open literature in the summer of 1947 were not totally successful. Veryfew during this early period knew what the peculiar phenomenon was and had no ideaabout what was to be discovered. Also, the level of classification associated with the cover-up project - which was operateddirectly under the President and the Joint chiefs of Staff from the very beginning -precluded others from \"being in the loop\" at the time of events and for decades afterward.Project management at the level of the JCS and the Office of Scientific Research andDevelopment (OSRD) within the Executive Office of the President, explains why a Majorin U. S. Army Air Forces Intelligence at Walker Field in Roswell, New Mexico, with the509th Bomb Group (America's elite atomic bomb squadron) would not have beeninformed by his superiors that something useful was recovered after the Major discovereda crashed flying disc. The policy of denial was already operating at the level of the JointChiefs of Staff and the President. The notion that a mild form of mass hysteria or dementia created the illusion of flying discsin some people is fiction that was first disseminated by General Curtis LeMay and hispsychological advisor. General LeMay was Director for Research and Development for"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the Air Staff when on July 5, 1947, he had a press conference to discuss flying discsightings - at the same time that one or more flying discs were crashing near Roswell.General LeMay suggested disc reports were caused by mass hysteria.[ Editor's Note: The USAF Military Museum states: \"In October 1947 GeneralLeMay was selected to command the U.S. Air Forces in Europe with headquarters atWiesbaden, Germany. He organized air operations for the Berlin Airlift. A year laterhe returned to the United States, assumed command of the newly formed StrategicAir Command, and established its headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. \"Commanding SAC for nearly nine years, General LeMay built from the remnantsof World War II an all-jet bomber force, manned and supported by professionalairmen dedicated to the preservation of peace. Under his leadership and supervision,plans were laid for the development and integration of an intercontinental ballisticmissile (ICBM) capability. \"In July 1957, the general was appointed Vice Chief of Staff of the United States AirForce and served in that capacity until July 1961, at which time he was appointedChief of Staff.\" ] November 15, 1906 - October 1, 1990.USAF General Curtis Emerson LeMay.The U. S. government's misinformation effort was considered necessary for at least threeprimary reasons: 1) to dissuade researchers from examining hard evidence left in the wake of our fistmajor and rather \"messy\" encounter with the phenomenon. The physical evidenceexisted in 1947 and exists today. 2) America's integrated command (IC) of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had a mission to\"collect\" several flying discs in central New Mexico during the summer of 1947. 3) The U. S. did not want to inform our primary early adversaries that the U. S. hadsucceeded in collecting an advanced \"foreign, possibly nuclear, weapons system.\"Public announcement would have alerted the military and scientific communityabout possible technical innovations that could be accomplished if the phenomenonwas seriously studied. Perhaps Peculiar Phenomenon can help dissipate some of the government-induced stigmaassociated with honest inquiry about \"extraterrestrial biological entities\" and theiradvanced technologies. How many other events in human history have been witnessed bythousands of thoughtful people over weeks and months? Hundreds of eyewitnesses havebeen dismissed by simply saying, \"No, it did not happen.\" Or, \"No, you really did not seethat. It was something else - maybe swamp gas or retina blood or a large ice crystal or ahail stone gliding to earth.\" The reader should appreciate that this work was reviewed by a number of individualsemployed within the space research area of the United States government. Those insidersshare a general sense of unease and disagreement with official U. S. policy of denial aboutthe UFO phenomenon. Those people, who cannot speak publicly on the record, applaudthe release of the material in this book.
