July 23, 2005 Williamsburg, Ohio - Beginning on June 13, 2005, a series of six circlepatterns in North Carolina grasses began to emerge, all at elevations above 2,000 feet.American crop circle investigator, Jeffrey Wilson, told me this week: \"We really have notseen crop circles in locations at this kind of elevation before, so I think this is notable.\"Jeff is Director of the Independent Crop Circle Researchers' Association (ICCRA) in Ohio.Other investigators included Delsey Knoechelman, Ted Robertson and Roger Sugden, andMike and Jackie Price. Jeff has gathered over 500 reports related to crop formation eventsin the United States from 1880 to 2005. The majority of American crop formations haveoccurred east of the Mississippi River - and Ohio has had the most, at least 35 cropformations.But this 2005 summer, it is North Carolina that has provoked Jeff and his colleagues tomake several trips to the mountain country around Asheville between Jupiter and MarsHill to Burnsville and Green Mountain. Like last year in Ohio when Jeff reported cropformations there lining up on two straight lines that intersected, this year Jeff has foundthat all six of the North Carolina grass patterns also are on a line. Further, the lineintersects in Oakvale, West Virginia, with another straight line-up of crop formations thatextends to the 2004 Ohio formations on a straight line from Miamisburg to Rardon, Ohio,down to Oakvale, West Virginia. Oakvale is also famous for several unidentified flyingobjects in the fall of 2003, followed by a grass circle in April 2004.Above: Oakvale, West Virginia, is 145 miles north of Charlotte, North Carolina.Below: Grass circle reported in late April 2004, near Oakvale."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"On September 24, 2003, six eyewitnesses in Oakvale, West Virginia, reported to UFOs Northwe stseveral unidentified flying objects and one took the above photo on his digital camera.No one has a definitive answer about why there are straight line-ups of crop formations.But I asked Jeff to describe the straight line phenomenon so far in North Carolina and hisICCRA investigation of a 4-circle pattern in 6-foot-tall hay in Leicester, where the farmowners and neighbors reported \"a blinding white light\" before midnight on June 21, 2005.Interview: North Carolina's first discovered 2005 grass circle was in Green Mountain, Yancey County,reported June 13, 2005 by Steve Hardin.

We got a pilot and a plane and we wentback down to North Carolina the following week after we visited the first one and we flewalong a heading after plotting out onto a GPS, we flew along that line and we discoveredtwo additional formations that were right on that line."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Mars Hill, Jupiter (nearby but not on map), Burnsville in the southwest of the straight linethat extends through Virginia, and eventually to Oakvale, West Virginia, where another straight line of 2004Ohio crop formations intersects the 2005 North Carolina line. Map by Jeffrey Wilson. ICCRA.Two Grass Circles Discovered by ICCRAWhile Flying Straight LineThe first one we discovered is in a little town just to the northwest of Jupiter called MarsHill. That is in Madison County. Delsey Knoechelman spotted this circle out of the plane.It had already been harvested in hay. It was approximately 20 feet in diameter.As we continued to fly a line up toward Green Mountain, we got to Burnsville and Ispotted the last of the six formations, again in grass. This is actually the largest of all theformations. It's about 110 feet across. It's a single ring, large 110-foot-ring, with a straightline half way to the center where there is a 23-foot swirled circle in the center of that ringformation.Large 110-foot-diameter ring surrounding pathway to 23-foot-diameter central swirled circlein Burnsville, North Carolina. Discovered by ICCRA while flying straight line.Photograph © 2005 by Jeffrey Wilson, ICCRA.We landed the plane, drove up to that site first and the landowner knew nothing about it,even though it was pretty adjacent to his house. I have to say that these formations were insome of the most obscure, hard-to-reach places. All of these crop circles in North Carolinaare above 2200 feet elevation. They are way up in the mountains. This area of NorthCarolina and into West Virginia are the highest mountains east of the Mississippi River. Wereally have not seen crop circles in locations at this kind of elevation before, so I think thatis notable. 'Blinding White Light' Seen Where"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Leicester Hay Formation FoundJune 21, 2005, Leicester, North CarolinaFour-circle pattern in tall hay reported in Leicester, Buncombe County, North Carolina, on June 21, 2005.Large central circle was about 75 feet in diameter. Three outside circles were spaced in triangle patternand ranged from ten to nineteen feet in diameter. Photograph © 2005 by Jeffrey Wilson, ICCRA.The third crop circle that was reported in North Carolina was at a place called Leicester,which is in Buncombe County to the southwest of Yancey County. There was a 4-circleformation found there in six to seven foot high hay the morning after more than a dozenpeople, including the landowner, observed a blinding white light lasting for several secondsaround 11:15 p.m. on June 21, 2005, about a week after the first two in Green Mountain,North Carolina.Witnesses from about ten miles around the Leicester, North Carolina, formation reportedseeing light. Animals in all those locations were reported as extremely agitated. The landowner's dog was in the basement, they call it the 'cow dog' for herding cows. It was lockedup in the basement and tried to rip the door off when this light appeared. The other dogupstairs also sort of went nuts.No tracks were found leading into this 4-circle formation, which is made up of a large,single central circle about 75 feet across and three separate circles between 10 and 19 feetin diameter circles, tangent to the main circle sort of spaced apart in a triangle pattern.We went to the Leicester formation which we found to be one of the most intriguing onesbecause of the eyewitness report and seeing the brilliant white light. It turns out that thoseland owners who really wish to remain unidentified at this point, they don't want anyattention. They just want to understand what is happening in their field. They refused toeven report their crop circle to the local press because the local press had reported on theGreen Mountain formation. The press did a pretty good ridicule job of it, so they did notwant to go through that kind of a wringer. Updated - Unusual Double S-Shaped Swirl in Main CircleAbove: Unusual double-S plant lay not seen before in grass and crop formations"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"investigated by ICCRA. Be low: Graphic overlay to show double-S pattern.Photographs © 2005 by Jeffrey Wilson, ICCRA.WHAT DID YOU SEE WITH YOUR EDUCATED EYES IN THAT GRASS THAT YOUTHOUGHT MIGHT BE ANOMALOUS?The main circle has an extremely unusual double-S-shaped swirl in the main circle. Thatmeans it doesn't start in the center and swirls outward, like a whirlpool or like a big giantswirl. This has got a double-S to it so the grass goes in multiple different directions. Atfirst, it just looked like a mess, but to understand how this was actually swirled down isvery complicated. That really struck us right away that it was really unusual.DID THE SWIRLS INVOLVE MULTIPLE LAYERS?Only in a couple of cases. There are only a couple of areas where there are over-lappingplaces where the grass was in layers.WERE THEY IN 90 DEGREE ANGLES?More like 180 degrees where the direction reversed flow 180 degrees.HAD YOU SEEN THAT BEFORE?I've not seen a double S-shape before. I've seen single S shapes, but I've never seen adouble S shape before. And I can't recall in the literature of seeing it reported elsewhere. Burned Centers in Three Smaller Circlesof Leicester, North Carolina, 4-Circle Grass PatternBurned center in each of the three circles surrounding large central circlein Leicester, North Carolina. Photograph © 2005 by landowner.There was another very interesting thing about the smaller tangent circles to the maincircle. These circles are only between 10 and 18 or 19 feet in diameter. When thelandowners woke up in the morning after the bright light and saw the crop circles out therein their field, they sent their son out to look at them. He drove his 4-wheeler out into thefield next to the formation and he reported that the area smelled like a camp fire that hadjust been put out. And when he walked into the formation, in the three smaller circles, he"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"reported they were burned in the centers and he did take photographs of that. So, thecenters of those circles appear to have been burned.WERE YOU ABLE TO EXAMINE THOSE BURNED AREAS YOURSELF?We did examine the areas that he reported the burns in, but we had gotten there about 9days after the formation happened. They had rain for the previous 3 days, and had like 7inches of rain. So a lot of that evidence disappeared or melted away. But we did find sometrace evidence of what appears to be burned stems of grass and we did collect samples ofthat. But his original photographs show that burn.THAT WOULD BE HIGHLY UNUSUAL IN THE WHOLE HISTORY OF CROPFORMATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. BURNING. THERE HASN'T BEEN MUCHBURNING OR SCORCHING ANYWHERE.Yes, there really has not been. It's very rarely reported, but it does get reported from timeto time. Elongated Growth Nodes in Leicester HayDO YOU HAVE ANY LAB ANALYSIS BACK ON THIS FORMATION OR ANY OFTHE SIX YET?Yes, we were able to sample three of the six. The other three had already been cut. We'vehad time now to do only a node elongation measurement test on the Leicester circleformation and it does come up positive that we do have elongated nodes in the grass fromthe Leicester formation. Nearby Randomly Downed Rye Grass in Triangle PatternTriangle of randomly downed rye inside a triangle-shaped larger field near the Leicester 4-circle pattern.Aerial photograph © 2005 by Jeffrey Wilson, ICCRA.Just at the road near the Leicester, North Carolina, 4-circle formation was a triangular-shaped field of rye grass which was pretty ready for harvest. In fact, I had never seen ryegrass so tall, about 7 feet all. This grass was flattened like a randomly downed formation,but in the shape of the triangle-shaped field.SO LIKE AN ECHO OF THE BIG FIELD?Correct. That field also appears to be on the same line as all the other six geometricformations. That was when we went down the first time.

Aerial photograph© 2005 by Jeffrey Wilson, ICCRA.Just across the street from the Leicester 4-circle hay pattern is a corn field. When we wentdown there the first time, it was intact. But when we flew over it on our second trip downthere, we discovered the corn field now has been flattened in a randomly downed patchand that corn is flattened so hard to the ground, it's like impacted. The flattened corn alsoappears to fit on the straight line.

Burnsville Pattern On Steep Hillof Grass and Blackberry Bushes"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Flattened blackberry bush in the middle of grass ring formation in Burnsville, North Carolina,discovered end of June when ICRRA flying straight line. A puzzle is that the berrieswere not damaged. Photograph © 2005 by Jeffrey Wilson.If we go to the Burnsville formation, which was in grass the large ring with the circle in thecenter with a pathway, that formation was really unusual in the sense that I've never comeacross a crop formation that was on such a severe slope. This slope was at about a 45 to 50degree angle, very severe slope. Unusually, this is the first formation I've run across inwhich the field grass, there were blackberry bushes. One of those blackberry bushes is alsoflattened in the middle of the ring and none of the berries were damaged.IF YOU PUT DOWN BERRIES AND THEY ARE FLATTENED AND NOTHING HASHAPPENED TO THE BERRIES, THAT SUGGESTS SOME KIND OF PRESSURE THATIS NOT PHYSICAL MEANING, NOT HARD MECHANICAL PHYSICAL.Right. It wasn't as if someone flattened this with a garden roller because that would haveleft clear damage on the fragile berries.RIGHT. SO THIS IS VERY SIGNIFICANT.It was certainly unusual, yes. We did take samples of the berries that were flattened andwe did take samples of the berries that were out in the rest of the field. So perhapsbiophysicist W. C. Levengood can try a germination of those and find somethinginteresting. Radioactivity in Burnsville and Leicester FormationsIS THERE ANYTHING ELSE ANOMALOUS?Well, we did take radiation readings in both the Burnsville formation and the Leicesterformation. At this point, I've got some additional work to make a confirmation on it, but atthis point it appears that both of those formations had elevated radiation readings.AND COMPARED TO THE ABOVE BACKGROUND READING THAT YOU HAD INOHIO, I THINK, IN ONE OF THE FORMATIONS THERE, HOW WOULD THIS ONECOMPARE?About twice as much.IS THIS THEN THE HIGHEST RADIOACTIVE READING YOU'VE GOTTEN IN ACROP FORMATION?No, not by far. It is above the statistical background.THE HIGHEST RADIOACTIVE READING THAT YOU'VE GOT WAS WHERE?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"I would have to say that was Paulding, Ohio back in 1996. That was about ten times thebackground radioactivity.IN ANY OF THESE FORMATIONS WHERE YOU HAVE GOTTEN RADIOACTIVEREADINGS, HAVE YOU EVER HAD ANY EXPLANATION FOR WHY THEREWOULD BE RADIOACTIVITY IN A CROP FORMATION IN ANY OF THESEFIELDS?No. There is not really a known physical process that can generate the radioactivity thatwe see for the amount of time that it seems to last. It never seems to last longer than 10 or11 days, and there isn't really any radioactive isotopes that decrease their radiation in thatlength of time. So, either something is continuously generating radioactivity and then juststops. Or, this is something that we really aren't sure what's going on.W. C. LEVENGOOD HAS ALWAYS SAID FROM HIS HYPOTHESIS POINT OF VIEW,IT'S A SPINNING PLASMA WITH A VERY COMPLEX RANGE OF ENERGIES. ONECOULD INCLUDE WHAT? SOME FORM OF GAMMA RAY OR X-RAY ORSOMETHING THAT COULD CAUSE SOME KIND OF RADIATION?That's possible, but we're picking up the radiation across all the bands: alpha, beta andgamma. So, that makes it even more difficult to determine what the isotopes might be.DO YOU HAVE ANY HYPOTHESIS?We haven't really come to one at this point because so much of the data that we're seeingis so puzzling. There seems to be so many unknown factors included here that we're prettymuch staying away from one hypothesis right now. We're keeping our minds open. Who? or What? Is Making Anomalous FormationsAT THIS POINT, YOU'VE BEEN STUDYING THESE CROP FORMATIONS FOR ALONG TIME, ESPECIALLY IN THE UNITED STATES. PRIVATELY, YOUR OWNINTUITIVE CUT, WHAT DO YOU THINK COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THESETHAT ARE ANOMALOUS?That's generally the million dollar question, isn't it? The idea of forming a hypothesis hasgone in and out of my mind over the last 10 years. What I've found is that just as we seemto be approaching something that resembles an answer that we could postulate, some newevidence comes up that we have to go back to square one. So, I've sort of learned torefrain from committing to any gut type hypothesis because the data is just so varied thatwe really can't commit to one.DOES THAT FACT ALONE SUGGEST THAT HUMANS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE?Well, it certainly the evidence is pretty clear and convincing and documented that NOTALL crop circles are being made mechanically by people. That's absolutely clear. Thereare certainly ones that people are making and the hoaxing teams have been out there andare getting pretty good and have been doing it for awhile. But, there is this large populationof crop circles out there that have enough evidence that shows the typical hoaxingmethods just cannot produce the kinds of things we are seeing.\"To report grass or crop formations, contact Jeffrey Wilson, ICCRA, in Ohio:Ph: 734-891-2689E-mail: jeff.wilson@adelphia.netOr e-mail: earthfiles@earthfiles.comMore Information:Across the Atlantic Ocean in Poland, the Czech Republic and England, crop formationsare being reported at least 13 in July so far for England and in 6 different counties:- Wiltshire County- West Sussex- Kent- Hampshire- Oxfordshire- North Somerset."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"One in Garsington, Oxfordshire, was at least 500 feet in diameter, reported on July 15th.It's 12 circles joined at the edges in a large circle around a central 13th circle.

He wrote:\"This new one shows, I think, the precession of Mercury about our Sun: four times ayear it becomes visible above the western horizon (two weeks ago for example):hence four white circles.Einstein used the slow advance of Mercury's elliptical orbit (as shown) to deduce histheory of general relativity:namely that motional gravity is slightly stronger than gravity at rest, by a factor of (1+ v2/c2).Converting from acceleration to velocity to distance, by a applying tripletime-integral, we get (1 + v2/c2)**3 = (1 + 3 x v2/c2) for small v / c, just as shownin the drawing. For example, the number 1.001 when cubed becomes 1.003 if v / c =0.001.The angular factor for light bending around our Sun remains (1 + v2/c2) = 1 + 1 = 2,because there it is only acceleration, and v = c.Very intelligent indeed, in my view at least.\" 2003-2004 Alignments of Ohio Crop FormationsOhio Crop Formation Alignments Map for 2003 (blue line) and 2004 (yellow line) which cross near Ohio'sGreat Serpent Mound © 2004 by Jeffrey Wilson, ICCRA.Jeffrey Wilson: \"My Ohio Crop Formation Alignments Map is for the last two seasons of2003 to 2004 of crop formations reported in Ohio and Kentucky. That map with the two"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"alignments of crop formations, and not earth mounds, from the past two years got startedlast year because we went to several crop circles in Ohio, beginning with a formation thatappeared near the Great Serpent Mound (Locust Grove and Peebles). See: 09-05-03Earthfiles. There were several formations one in West Union (Adams County) and onenear Bainbridge (Ross County, Ohio). So, yellow line represents 2004 formations fromMiamisburg through Cuba, Ohio (blue circle above Blanchester) through Hillsboro andends on the map near Peebles at the last 2004 formation which was in Scioto County. (Seeother 2004 Earthfiles reports below.)Before in 2003, we received a report from a place called Hilltop, Kentucky, which issouthwest of Flemmingsburg, Kentucky. It appeared that all of the 2003 formations fromKentucky to Ohio fell along a pretty straight line if you connected the dots from Maysvilleto the Seip Mound. That struck us as being unusual. So, the blue line on the map connectsthe 2003 crop formations in Hilltop, Kentucky; West Union, Ohio; Serpent Moundformation in Locust Grove near Peebles; to the last formation in Bainbridge near the SeipMound. The blue line does not go directly through the Seip mound.We held a meeting earlier this year with several members of the ICCRA and one of thosemembers, Roger Sugden, was looking on the map at where we had held that meeting,which was near Cuba, Ohio. That is the blue dot on your map above Blanchester. Henoticed that there was also an alignment between the Miamisburg Mound and the TremperMound to the southeast in Portsmouth, Ohio. 2003 and 2004 Alignments Cross NearOhio's Great Serpent MoundHe had drawn a line on his paper map that only those of us at that small 12-person meetinglooked at. Subsequently, all of the crop circle formations in 2004 have fallen pretty muchon that line from the Tremper Mound to Miamisburg Mound. If you connect a linebetween the two, it would not fall exactly on the line, but if you connect all the cropformations that came down this year, they do fall on a line that crosses the 2003 line nearthe Great Serpent Mound.HAVE YOU TRIED TO EXTEND THE LINES TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY GOUP FURTHER THROUGH THE UNITED STATES AND INTO CANADA TO SEE IFTHERE ARE SIMILAR ALIGNMENTS FOLLOWING ALONG THOSE TWOALIGNMENTS?Yes, I did. I blew the line out to the southeast, all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. And Idrew the line going to the northwest all the way to the Pacific Ocean. My mappingprogram follows the curvature of the Earth so you get a nice smooth line. It goes all theway from coast to coast. I don't have all of Paul Anderson's data base map yet, so I can'ttell if his Canadian formations are connected on my U. S. line. But I will tell you that indrawing that specific line, there are about fifteen crop circles from the historical data in theUnited States falls upon.\"Other Earthfiles Reports About Crop Formations, 1999 to 2004, see EarthfilesArchives:· 09/22/2004 -- Miamisburg and Serpent Mound, Ohio Crop Formations: GeometriesCompared· 09/17/2004 -- Updated: Part 1 - High Strangeness in Canadian Cattle Corn· 09/12/2004 -- Part 2 - High Strangeness in Canadian Cattle Corn· 09/10/2004 -- Update on Miamisburg, Ohio, Corn Pictogram - Balls of Light?· 09/05/2004 -- Part 2 - Hillsboro, Ohio Corn Plant Anomalies· 09/04/2004 -- Hillsboro, Ohio Corn Formation - High Strangeness in Soil andPlants· 09/02/2004 -- Updated Photos: Big, Impressive New Corn Formation inMiamisburg, Ohio· 08/12/2004 -- Circles in Belgium and Holland· 08/09/2004 -- Pictograms in Poland· 07/26/2004 -- Crop Circles in Tilden, Wisconsin Oats and 90-Degree Angles inLitchfield, Minnesota Barley· 07/25/2004 -- 2004 Canadian Crop Formations: Scorched Soybeans and \"Dirt\"Pattern in Barley· 07/15/2004 -- Updated: Part 1-Beyond Hillsboro, Ohio, More Corn Down in NewMilford, Connecticut· 07/06/2004 -- Mysteriously Downed Oat Plants in Eagle Grove, Iowa, and DownedCorn in Hillsboro, Ohio· 07/06/2004 -- Additions to Spanish Fork, Utah Formation and Mysterious Lights"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Seen· 07/04/2004 -- Crop Formation in Spanish Fork, Utah· 06/17/2004 -- More 2004 Holland and Poland Crop Formations· 06/16/2004 -- England: 2004 Crop Formations and 2003 Research· 06/02/2004 -- 2004 Peach Orchard, Arkansas Crop Formation· 05/24/2004 -- Biophysicist W.
