Air Force Colonel Return to previous Part 5To be more computer-friendly, the reprint has been divided into parts. Here begins Part 6of Status Report II, written in January 1980. The series of status reports, I through VII,were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report IIIbegins at Earthfiles. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. For all theprevious status reports, see Earthfiles Archives. Leonard H. Stringfield: \"CASE A-9: This case, with new supporting information, refers to independent sources who havewitnessed the same secret movie at different bases, showing an alleged crashed discin a desert region and their deceased alien bodies lying on tables, probably in amakeshift state at the same crash site. First, for the record, is edited copy fromAbstract # 5 which appeared in my previous paper.Excerpt from Abstract # 5, Status Report I (to be reprinted in upcomingEarthfiles): U. S. Air Force Radar Specialist, Spring 1953: 'Mr. TE, who holds atechnical position in today's civilian life, at age twenty was a U. S. Air Forceradar specialist with Secret security clearance stationed in Ft. Monmouth,New Jersey. In the spring of 1953, he and a small, select number of radarspecialists were summoned to view a film at the base theater. Without anybriefing, the 16mm movie projector was flicked on and the film began to rollon the screen. Without any titles or credits that he could recall, the filmshowed a desert scene dominated by a silver disc-shaped object embedded inthe sand with a domed section at the top. At the bottom was a hatch or doorthat was open. In the next scene, TE recalls seeing 10 to 15 military personnel dressed infatigues and without identification patches, standing around what appeared tobe a disabled craft. By judging their height against the UFO, TE determinedthat the disc's width was approximately 15 to 20 feet in diameter and that anopen hatch or door at the bottom was about 2.5 feet wide and perhaps 3 feethigh. At this point, TE had no idea of the movie's purpose. I asked about theactivity of the personnel. 'They were just looking at the object,' he said. Then the movie switched to what appeared to be the interior of the craft. Apanel with a few simple levers was shown. He remembers being impressed bythe muted pastel colors and sudden glares of white - the sign of poorphotography. Again there was a change of scenes. Now in view were twotables, probably taken inside a tent on which to his surprise were dead bodies.Two were on one table; one on the other. TE said the bodies appeared little byhuman standards and most notable were the heads. All heads looked alike andall were large compared to their body sizes. They looked Mongoloid, hethought, with small noses, mouths and eyes that were shut. He did not recallseeing ears or hair. The skin, he said, was ashen in color. Each wore a tight-"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"fitting suit in a pastel color ... yellow was mentioned. The scene of the dead bodies was the end of the movie. When the lights cameon in the theater, the officer in charge stood up and instructed the viewers to'think about the movie,' and added firmly, 'don't relate its contents to anyone.'TE said, in good faith, he did not even tell his wife. To TE's surprise, twoweeks later he was approached by an Intelligence Officer on the base and wastold, 'Forget the movie you saw. It was a hoax.' Shortly after seeing the movie,he heard from a couple of top security officers on the base that a UFO hadcrashed in New Mexico and had been recovered with its occupants. The dataof the crash was 1952. Commented my informant, 'The 5-minute-long movie certainly was not a WaltDisney production. It was probably shot by an inexperienced cameramanbecause it was full of scratches and had poor coloring and texture.' TE, when asked about his interest in UFOs, claimed that he was not interestedthen or now. But he has always been curious about the purpose of the film inrelation to his work in radar. Years later, he met an old army acquaintancewho was also a radar specialist. To TE's surprise, he learned from this manthat he, too, had seen the same film at another base under similar hush-hushconditions. My informant believes that the corpses and crashed craft shown inthe movie film were bona fide. We agreed that it would have been ridiculousfor a professional studio to have made dummy bodies to look so real in anotherwise ill-prepared and shoddy film.' Following my talk in Dayton, copies of my paper were xeroxed and distributed tokey researchers and, in turn, were again amply reproduced for an endless chain ofpeople. As a result, word has come from far afield of others having knowledge of thesecret movie film, but one of the more cooperative and well-informed researchers -Mrs. Joan Jeffers of Bradford, Pennsylvania (former RN with degrees in socialsciences) - was quick to come to the challenge for help. When she read the TEreport, she discussed it with a former high ranking military officer who was a friendof hers. He acknowledged that he, too, had seen the same film. Furthermore, sheobliged by getting testimony from the officer for use in this Status Report II. Thattestimony was dated February 6, 1979, and is reprinted below: February 6, 1979, Retired U. S. Air Force Colonel: ' Dear Len ... At last I am able to put this information in a letter to you. Youhave my permission to use it in publication of your work. Last summer while I was relating some of the reported highlights of theMUFON symposium, I mentioned the movie of the crashed disc and alienbeings. An acquaintance of mine offered a few additional details, but it tookseveral more weeks to get more information from him. This man is a retired Air Force Colonel, who enlisted in the early 1940s andretired about 1970. He entered the cadet program and the major portion of hismilitary career was as a pilot, though he held several other jobs during themany years. He does not want his name released. Therefore, I must leave outsome identifying details, but they are in my files. When stationed at a MaineAF radar facility (which is now strictly a Navy Air Station), this man wasrequired to attend weekly 'Commander's Call.' One week (probably) in 1956,the men were shown a movie 'filmed by the USAF' - no further credits. Themovie showed a circular, metal silvery disc on the ground. The inside was welllighted, of a light color and with smooth walls. The scene shifted to show atleast three bodies lying on tables. The beings were short, all looked alike anddid not have any ears (external) or hair. All appeared to be dead. When Iasked the color of their skin, the reply was 'ashen or gray.' I asked the numberof digits on their hands and he held up four fingers with his thumb tucked outof sight. I asked if they did not have a thumb and his reply was affirmative. Next, I questioned him about the clothing and he said it was 'pale green andyellow.' I asked several other general questions, but he refused to answer, orsaid he did not recall. I asked if the men were told anything about the moviebefore, during or after the showing. He said they were not. I asked thereaction of the men who had viewed the movie with him. He said, 'Weprobably laughed about it and left.' He does not recall ever discussing it with"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"any of the others. All material presented at these meetings was consideredmilitary business and not to be discussed. Some weeks later, I again asked himwhy they had shown that particular group the movie and his response was thata UFO we were tracking had crashed. That was all I could get out of him. This event was 23 or more years ago, but this man has good recall of otherevents and incidents from that time. He has held responsible positions in localbusiness and is generally of good character. He is retired as disabled. Thoughhe does not believe the government would arrest or fine him, he will notreveal anything more, although I do know from past conversations that he hasa great deal of information about AF investigations of UFOs. I have supplied you with the name and possible present location of the manwho was commander of this base ... Joan Jeffers (signed) ' STRINGFIELD COMMENT: With only the slightest variances, both the Colonel's and TE's reports described thesame film. Showing of the film might have been to limited personnel on a 'need toknow' basis, but it seems that it appeared at a number of military bases. Not, too,that the Air Force Major (Case A-4) recalls having witnessed part of the film at anundisclosed base. Other former military personnel who might have seen the filmhave been named by Mrs. Jeffers from her source for follow-up. One, a Lt. Colonel,was reached by researcher Stan Friedman. But he did not recall having seen themovie. However, he said, 'If your source would get in touch with me he mightrefresh my memory.' I called the other officer in May of 1979, who still works atWright-Patterson AFB following his military career. Evasively he responded, 'If Isaw it, I can't remember it.' I cannot believe that the movie used make-believe cadavers and was a trick on aselect group of personnel holding the highest degree of security clearance. Onceagain, the faces of the three humanoids in the movie were described as identical, acharacteristic noted by the Air Police Sergeant in Case A-2 and the former C.I.A.official in Case A-6. Of note, the C.I.A.-sponsored Robertson Panel met in January 1953, dictating thatall military UFO reports be suppressed. UFO retrieval operations and movies gotrigorous treatment which presumably still seal the lips of informants to this day. CASE A-10: In light of new information surfacing about an alleged crash and retrieval of an aliencraft near Roswell, New Mexico in 1947, the following case was published inAbstract # 18 of my previous Status Report I and is certainly not in itself unusual.But it merits review as it might provide useful testimony for researchers. On April 7, 1978, Steve Tom - an NBC radio newsman in Chicago - and I werelinked up by phone for an interview with a former Air Force Intelligence Officer,Major Jesse Marcel, who lived in Houma, Louisiana. Major Marcel, I learned,shared some common ground with me. He had also served in the 5th Air Force in thePacific Theater during World War II and had been in several combat areas such asLeyte, Philippine Islands, where I had been assigned. The purpose of our call was toobtain firsthand the Major's confirmation of his role in the retrieval of an allegedcrashed UFO northwest of Roswell, New Mexico, in the summer of 1947. The debris of an apparent metallic aerial device or craft that had exploded in the air,or crashed, was first made known by a sheep rancher (Mac Brazel) who foundfragments of metal and other material on his 8,000 acre property. When he informedthe Air Force base in Roswell of his discovery, Major Marcel and aides weredispatched to the area for investigation. There, he found many metal fragments andwhat appeared to be 'parchment' strewn in a 1-mile-square area. 'The metalfragments,' said the Major, 'varied in size up to 6 inches in length, but were of thethickness of tinfoil. the fragments were unusual,' he continued, 'because they wereof great strength. They could not be bent or broken, no matter what pressure weapplied by hand.' The area was thoroughly checked, he said, but no fresh impact depressions werefound in the sand. The area was not radioactive. The fragments, he added weretransported by a military carry-all to the Air Base in Roswell and from that point hewas instructed by General Roger A. Ramey, Chief of the Air Defense Command, todeliver the 'hardware' to Ft. Worth, Texas, to be forwarded to Wright-Patterson"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Field, Ohio, for analysis. When the press learned of this retrieval operation andwanted a story, Major Marcel stated, 'To get them off my back, I told them we wererecovering a downed weather balloon.' Since the Major's story got publicity, it has been said by some researchers that theretrieved fragments were possibly a part of the Skyhook balloon. At that time, it wasclassified as Secret. On October 5, 1979, I called Jesse Marcel and got thiscomment:Major Jesse Marcel, U. S. Air Force Intelligence Officer in 1947: 'Thematerial I gathered did not resemble anything off a balloon. A balloon of anykind could not have exploded and spread its debris over such a broad area. ...Iwas told later that a military team from my base was sent to rake the entirearea.' STRINGFIELD COMMENT: If there were entities aboard, they could have been destroyed in what appeared to bea violent aerial explosion. In 1979, the book The Philadelphia Experiment uncovered new data about anotherlegendary mystery concerning a warship being invisibly teleported during a Navyexperiment in 1943. The authors were Charles Berlitz and William Moore, who areready for another expose far removed from sea lore. The theme concerns an allegedcrash of a UFO in 1947 near Roswell, New Mexico. Thus, there might be a tie-inwith the account offered by Major Jesse Marcel. Bill Moore told me during a private meeting in Cincinnati in July 1979, that he haduncovered some good firsthand data about the 1947 crash. In trust, he related someof his material and if his informants are as reliable as he alleges, then the Air Forcelong ago had evidence to back up and make policy about the incursive UFO.\"To be continued in Part 7 - An update about the Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, UFOcrash/retrievalCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
