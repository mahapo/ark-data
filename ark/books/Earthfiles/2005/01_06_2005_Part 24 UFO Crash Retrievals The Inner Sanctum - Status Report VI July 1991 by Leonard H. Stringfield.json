Continued - Len Stringfield's reprint of report from Long Island UFO Network (LIUFON),New York: Long Island UFO Network (LIUFON), New York: 'EXIT 61, SUNRISE HIGHWAY, 8:15 PM, 9/28/89 'Dr. John Sykes is a dentist who lives in Quogue and practices in Babylon, LongIsland. He reported this incident to LIUFON in April of 1991. He states that at 8:15PM that night, he was traveling home on Sunrise near Exit 61 to egress for theEastport Road. He noticed to the South, some three miles away, a very bright amber light hoveringin the sky. He first thought that it was a parachute flare, since the Air Guard waspracticing for the shuttle landings. John continued his drive, now leaving Sunrise Highway, heading for the cut-off forthe Eastport Road. He could still see the light in his rearview mirror. It was at leasttwo minutes since he first saw the light and if it was a parachute flare, it was notdropping down from its high position in the sky. He began to wonder what it was,since there had been strong winds on his ride home from work. If it was a flare, itwould have been blown all over the place. It was also unusually bright for a flareand it was the wrong color for a phosphorous flare. They are usually white for anytype of air-sea rescue operation. John had experience in these things, since his Korean and Viet Nam War service inthe Marines taught him what flares looked like. This was strange, and in his opinion,it was not a flare. If John is correct, then this places one of the objects near Moriches Bay at 8:15 PM,near the time-frame when the Petersons reported the incident over Moriches Bay. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Moriches Bay and surrounding communities on Long Island, New York, south ofBrookhaven National Laboratory. Quogue is south of the Westhampton Air Guard facility.THE INCIDENT Paul Peterson was watching television in his living room. The time was around 8:45PM on the night of September 28, 1989. At that time, Paul reported that he observedthrough the glass panes of his Florida doors, strange amber lights over MorichesBay. First one, then two, then three, then four, five and six amber lights appeared tothe South of his home on Union Avenue in Center Moriches, L. I. They wereappearing in sequence. The lights were unusually, unnaturally brilliant, illuminatingthe night sky. In addition, he heard what sounded like very large military helicopterspassing over his home and the surrounding neighborhood. As they neared, he sawdark green Sikorsky helicopters. They were low over the trees turning to circle outover the Bay in the direction of the lights. Determined to record the transpiring events, Paul got his Panasonic three lux videocamera, turned it on and observed that there was no image of the lights in his viewfinder. He checked the camera again and observed that the power was on. Hequickly went inside the house and checked the camera against the illuminatedinterior of the living room and observed an image of his living room lamp. Thecamera was indeed working. Taking the video cassette out, it was quickly put into the home VCR. A rather quickreview of the recording indicated that the lights had not been picked up by thecamera even though the audio had recorded the helicopters' engine noise. He called for his son, Robert, who was upstairs, to join the family on the deck whilehe looked for his wife's instamatic camera. With camera and a spare roll of film, hereturned to the deck and asked his son to go with him down the street to the UnionAve. Town Dock. Taking the boy with him, the family's pickup truck would havethem there in minutes. Parking his truck at Union Ave. Dock, Paul and Robert Peterson arrived at the sceneto observe, some three hundred yards off the shore, a pair of very bright amberlights about 50-100 feet above the water. The lights were going on in sequence. Firstone light, then two, three and so on until there were six amber lights. From an extensive interview done on October 7, 1989, both Paul and his son relatedto LIUFON investigators the entire episodes of what occurred there over the bay. 1) They arrived at the dock between 9:00 and 9:15 PM. 2) The film in the Kodak disc instamatic they had was non-low light sensitive. Theonly major sources of light the pictures taken were the amber lights of the craft andthe searchlight of a helicopter. The street and house lights of the adjoiningcommunities around the Bay did not register on the film even though from variousangles, the camera should have at least registered some house lights on the film. Thefilm was 200 ASA Kodak disc, which is useless under such conditions even with theaid of the flash attachment. 3) The lights would appear high in the sky, then remain on and then shut off. Thenthey would reappear close to the surface and reappear in sequence. The photographsattest to this fact. 4) Paul and Robert Peterson both stated that when they arrived at the scene, anduntil the time they left, the object was continually surrounded by four to possibly sixAir Force and police helicopters. This lasted the entire time that they were downthere on the dock. 5) Both Paul and Robert described the helicopter operation as a counter-clockwise"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"flight rotation around the area of Moriches Bay. The helicopters would fly overSmith's Point Beach and the Dune Preserve taking them right over the Smith's PointBeach Camp Grounds. They would then swing East above the Dunes towards themouth of Moriches Inlet where they would swoop low over by the West Hamptonside turning on their searchlights to illuminate a very bright, blue-white pulsatinglight that illuminated the dunes and lit up the sky. The aircraft would then comearound giving a wide sweep to the object and begin their rotation again around theBay. This lasted the entire time that the object was in the Peterson's view over theBay. 6) One of the helicopters was definitely identified by Paul Peterson as a SuffolkCounty police helicopter. The others were large Sikorsky SH-55s used by the AirForce. 7) Paul and Robert related to LIUFON investigators that they saw an intenseblue-white light at the mouth of Moriches Inlet on the West Hampton Beachside thatlit up the night sky and the Dune Preserve. This is the light that the helicopters paidspecial interest to. 8) At one point, the lights of the object became so intense that both Paul and his sonwere blinded by the light. They had to squint in order to look at the object. 9) Both stated that they could not discern a shape or structure behind the lights.They at first thought from the beginning that they might be looking at a series ofindependent objects because of the lack of a definitive structure. 10) During the course of their stay which lasted somewhere from an hour and a halfto possibly two hours, both father and son took some thirty pictures of the object.They used up two full Kodak discs. 11) Both stated in their interviews that the Bay was rocked by intense wind guststhat night of between 25 and 30 mph. 12) Paul Peterson, who is a former Viet Nam era Airborne Ranger and has seencombat, stated the lights were not parachute flares. 13) During the entire incident, both father and son stated that they were terrified atthe spectacle they observed. 14) The Petersons stated that they saw no fixed wing aircraft operating over theNorthwest section of the Bay the entire night. They observed only helicopters. The Petersons stayed at the dock until roughly a little before 11:00 PM when theyobserved the object head out towards the East in the company of its helicopterescort. Paul stated that from about 11:15 PM on, it was all quiet. The lights were gone andso were the helicopters. Then, about 11:25 PM, he saw the lights again over the Bayand heard the helicopters again. He stood out on his deck and saw that the activityhad resumed over the Bay. He did not return to Union Ave. Dock again. This new activity lasted from about 11:15 PM for some twenty to twenty-fiveminutes up until 11:45 PM or 12:00 AM when suddenly everything stopped and itwas all quiet. On October 4, 1989, Christine contacted the LIUFON hotline number to report theincident. The family was, as stated before, interviewed on October 7, 1989, byLIUFON investigators. There are several additional points that surfaced during LIUFON's investigation withthe Petersons over the last two years. a) The Petersons did not see the object go down or the recovery of it.b) They did not see any brush fires in the Dunes (later this became very significant.)c) They did not see any boats or ships in the Bay that night.d) During the sighting, neither father nor son stated that they heard any insect oranimal sounds down by the shore. It was unusually silent.e) The Petersons stated that there were some fishermen at the Dock who wereleaving when they arrived. If it were not for the unusually unselfish cooperation by the Petersons, this casemight not have been brought to the attention of LIUFON."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" THE OLIVIERI FAMILY, SENEX CANAL, CENTER MORICHES, 9:00 PM9/28/89 Unbeknownst to the Petersons, there were indeed other witnesses who observed theincident that night. The two families have never met and probably never will. Thereis no way that they could have collaborated with the Petersons to produce a hoax. There were indeed three other very cooperative witnesses to this event. They werethe Olivieri family who live along the Senex Canal in Center Moriches. It began when Carol Olivieri was watching TV in her bedroom around 9:00 PM onthe night of September 28, 1989. She has a small atrium built onto the back of herbedroom with large glass panels to let in the sun for her many household plants. She noticed at first two, then three, large amber lights that illuminated the night skyabout a mile away over Moriches Bay. She also heard the noise of large helicoptersover their neighborhood. She then went into the living room on the other side of thehouse and called for her husband, Frank, to join her on the deck in the rear of thehouse. For an hour, Frank and Carol reported they saw a formation of three to five verylarge tremendously bright amber lights one mile distant over Moriches Bay., Thelights would first appear high in the sky and then would slowly descend below thetrees surrounding Moriches Bay's shoreline. The process after a minute or two wouldrepeat itself. In addition, they saw two or three Air Force helicopters flying past thelights when they would appear high in the sky. the lights were about the size of ahouse and lit up the night sky turning it into daylight. About 10:00 PM, their daughter, Jane, arrived home from a date. She went to theback to watch with her parents. Jane added that the lights were so bright that shecould see the Air Force markings on the side of the helicopters as they flew past. Frank, Carol and Jane all agree that the activity lasted until 11:00 PM, when all of asudden, the lights descended for a last time. Then at 11:05 PM, a much smallerbunch of lights appeared above the trees which appeared to be parachute flares.They could see smoke and parachutes. the lights were both significantly smaller andless brilliant. frank Oliveiri was a WWII Navy Armed Merchant Guardsman who had threemerchant ships torpedoed out from under him. He stated from his experience inWWII that the lights were not parachute flares, but something totally different. Thelast string of lights at 11:05 PM were definitely flares and he feels they weredropped by the Air Force, either because they were looking for something or theywanted the populace to think the other lights were flares, too. All agree that the activity stopped at 11:05 PM. After that, there were no more lightsor helicopters. BOX TREE ROAD, EAST QUOGUE, N. Y. 9:30-9:45 PM, 9/28/89 This incident involved Kathy O'Donnelly and her husband, Kevin. It occurred whilePaul Peterson was taking his photographs and the Olivieris were watching the lightsin the sky. Kathy works in Medford, L. I., as a secretary for a real estate and insurance officewhose office hours that night were until 9:00 PM. Kathy left work and proceededhome by way of Sunrise Highway to Exit 64 South. The trip usually took herbetween 30-45 minutes. As Kathy exited Sunrise onto Levis Road, she noticed a formation of six to eightvery bright amber lights at a high altitude above and behind her car. They weredropping quickly to tree top level and were following her car as she drove alongLewis Road. The light from the amber lights lit up the sky and it filled her car'sinterior. She became very frightened. Turning off from Lewis Road, she made a left turn onto her home street of Box TreeRoad. Kathy beeped her horn to alert her waiting husband, Kevin, as she entered thedriveway. Kathy turned and looked across the street. There above the potato farm,which is across from her home, she noticed the large amber lights hovering at treetop level above the field. The night sky was turned to daylight."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Just then, Kevin and a friend (who remains unidentified and refused to talk to us)came out the front door. They had been inside watching TV and upon hearingKathy's horn and car, went outside to investigate. They were further alarmed whenthey saw the bright amber lights across the street fill the darkened living room withlight. Once outside, they joined Kathy and watched the bright lights after a minute slowlylift up and move very slowly over the trees. Kathy and Kevin later stated that theycould not see a structure behind the lights, but had a feeling that the lights weredefinitely attached to something and it was huge. It was also totally silent and madeno noise. The field across the street is ten acres in size. Both Kathy and Kevin agree that thelights filled the area above the field from one end to the other. On February 4, 1990, Kevin and Kathy were interviewed by John Ford and KellyFreeman. At the interview session, the O'Donnellys both identified a displaysequence of twelve photographs of the Moriches Bay pictures as the object theyboth saw that night. This report places one of the two objects in the Quogue area. Italso places one of the objects near the West Hampton Air Guard facility that night. THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION,NASSAU-SUFFOLK COUNTY LINE, 9:00 PM, 9/28/89 This information comes from two confidential sources. The disclosure of theiridentities would jeopardize their employment. LIUFON has agreed not to disclosewho, how or by what means, this information came into our possession, but willstate for the record that it is factual. One person overheard the radio transmissionsand the other person was involved in logging in the flight plans with the F.A.A. That night, the West Hampton Air Guard facility alerted the Drug EnforcementAdministration offices in Manhattan to the effect that they had a large unidentifiedaircraft on their scope over Moriches Bay. Fearing an unregistered flight to be adrug smuggling operation, they requested the D. E. A. to launch an intercept team ofagents from Manhattan to investigate the incident. A heavily armed team of agents were dispatched by helicopter from Manhattan withthe directive to bring the suspicious aircraft into Brookhaven Town Airport inShirley for inspection. As the helicopter was over the Nassau-Suffolk County borderat 9:00 PM, the pilot was informed that the DEA's authority to operate overMoriches Bay had been suspended due to an on-going Air Force operation. Theairspace over Moriches Bay was closed to all civilian traffic and the D.E.A. agentswere under orders to return to Manhattan. As the pilot pressed for an explanation,he was told that if they attempted to enter the area, the U. S. Air Force wouldprevent them. The helicopter and the agents turned back towards Manhattan. The one helicopter that the Suffolk County Police had over the Bay that night,which is supported by flight logs released to LIUFON by the Suffolk Police, had toland at Islip Airport that night. Its purpose was to refuel. The time of the landing was9:05 PM. It was ordered to remain on the ground and await further orders if it wasneeded. It did not take off again that night. It took some high authority to preventthe D.E.A. from completing its mission and to ground the police rescue helicopter. FRANK D., QUOGUE, 12:00 AM, 9/28-29/89 Frank D. lives in Quogue near the shoreline of Moriches Bay. He is a New YorkState Court Officer employed in Nassau County District Court. He stated to LIUFON investigators that he was down by the shoreline of MorichesBay the night of the occurrence. He had driven down there in response to the manyparachute flares he observed being dropped out over the ocean by helicopters andC-1`30 aircraft. As he stood near the water that night, he had a clear view some several miles awaytowards the area of the mouth of Moriches Inlet. He observed an Air Force C-130come in over the Bay and drop a string of parachutists into the water. In the documents released by the Air Guard and the Coast Guard, no mention ismade of the dropping of paramedics into the waters of Moriches Bay that night. Thequestion is asked why was this omitted? THE FISHERMEN IN THE DUNES, 6:00-9:00 PM, 9/28/89"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Larry S. lives in Shirley, L. I. and is in the construction trades of the Island'sexpanding business and residential areas. He is also an avid sports fisherman. Thenight of the occurrence, he was fishing in the Dunes at the mouth of Moriches Bay. Larry, his son and an unidentified friend were in the Dunes that night to surf castfish on the seaward side of the Dunes. They arrived in the area at 8:00 PM thatnight. They could see from the Smith's Point Beach Bridge (all the) helicopter andaircraft activity to the East of the Inlet. They were positioned so that they would fish the seaward side of the Dunes. Thewinds were extremely brisk that night, gusting upwards to 30 mph making it veryhard to fish the seaward side. Later on, they moved to the Bay side of the Dunes.They had arrived at the location at 8:00 PM and would leave at roughly 11:00 PM.This is what they reported: 1) The first time they saw any aircraft was at 8:00 PM. 2) They reported that a Coast Guard helicopter landed at the mouth of MorichesBay at 8:00 PM to assist a stranded boat whose engine had failed. The boat is ownedby one Frank De Julio of Mastic Beach. After helping the stranded boat, the CoastGuard helicopter inquired if anyone had seen anything of a sinking boat in the area.With no affirmative reply, the crew boarded the helicopter and took off. 3) There were only two cursory helicopter passes over Moriches Bay as far as heremembers that night. 4) The bulk of the activity was to the East towards the direction of the WestHampton Beach side of the Inlet. This was in the direction of Dune Road. 5) He observed that there was a C-130 dropping flares in the area of West Hamptonfrom 8:00 PM to at least 11:00 PM that night. He estimated that at least forty to fiftyparachute flares were dropped by the C-130 during his stay in the Dunes. There wassome helicopter activity in the area simultaneously with the aircraft. He observedthat a couple of the helicopters did shine their searchlights over the Dunes in thatarea. 6) Larry stated that he saw no lights or helicopter activity in the area of the Bay nearSmith's Point Beach Bridge or the Park. 7) He stated that he did not notice any C-130s over the Bay at all that night. Thiswould contradict official statements made by the Coast Guard and the Air Force. 8) He stated that he did see amber lights towards the Northwest of the Bay. He sawhelicopter activity in that area all night long and that he was under the impressionthat the lights were parachute flares because they would first appear high in the skyand then drop down low; then, suddenly appear again resuming the entire process. 9) Larry stated that as far as he can remember, there were no military personnel inthe Dunes that night. He did not see any military vehicles in the parking lot, thecampgrounds or on the roads leading into the beach. He did not see any Ford vans inthe area of the mouth of the Inlet. 10) He did not see any blue-white pulsating light in the Dunes that night. 11) He noted that at 9:00 PM, one helicopter dropped flares into the mouth of theInlet. This was the only time he saw flares dropped in his vicinity. 12) The color of all flares dropped to the east that night were white phosphorous.They were of the parachute type only. 13) He noticed a black coastal type racing boat in the area of the Inlet about 9:00PM that night with no running lights. He estimated the boat to have been doing closeto 80 mph. 14) He noticed no fires in the Dunes nor fire engines nor fire personnel during theevening. 15) They had a CB with them and noticed no unusual radio communications on thechannel they were monitoring. 16) They had no portable scanner with them and, therefore, could not monitor Coast"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Guard or police frequencies. 17) As they left the area, they crossed the Smith's Point Beach Bridge about 11:05or 11:10 PM. They saw a helicopter to the Northwest drop a string of parachuteflares near the Senex Canal area. 18) Larry was more interested in the fishing than in what was going on and payingmore attention to the Activity to the East than to the Northwest. Larry is convinced that what he saw was a major federal activity to launch a majordrug bust. This was because of the blacked out racing boat he saw. He is convincedthat it was a government boat. He is also certain the activity to the Northwest wereparachute flares, even though the flares were amber in color. Larry's report is obviously from a person who was not interested in the events goingon around him. In the two conversations held with this man, LIUFON could findelements of his statement that corroborated other witnesses' testimonies and otherparts that were lacking evidence that was known to have existed out there in theDunes. Larry did prove one thing. This point he made clear to LIUFON and is a vital pieceof information. There indeed was an air sea rescue operation that night, but it wasnot where it was supposed to be as stated by the U.S. Air Force, Coast Guard andpolice. It was not over the Bay, but some two to three miles East and some twomiles South of West Hampton out over the ocean. They used a far greater amount offlares than stated in Air Force documents released to LIUFON and all the flareswere white phosphorous in the East. He did see the amber lights near the SenexCanal area and he still persists that they had to be flares also because what elsecould they have been. He did not see any military activity in the Dunes, but did seeactivity in every area around the Bay. He also did not see Peterson's blue light.'\" ontinued in Part 25 - Photo Analysis and Magnetic Disturbance in Moriches BayCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
