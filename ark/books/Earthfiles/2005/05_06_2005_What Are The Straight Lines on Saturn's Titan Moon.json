One of themany mysteries: what is the right angle structure beneath the white arrow? This composite wasproduced from imagesreturned January 14, 2005, by ESA's Huygens probe. Image source: ESA/NASA/JPL/University ofArizona. May 6, 2005 Tucson, Arizona - This week planetary scientists at the University ofArizona in Tucson submitted their first paper about the Cassini/Huygens probe images ofSaturn's huge moon, Titan, to the British journal, Nature. But the article, with many imagesand hypotheses about what the surface geology might be on the mysterious moon, won't bereleased until the end of 2005. One of the many surface features that have provoked scientists to wonder what they areseeing is what appears to be a straight-sided 90-degree angle at the left of a compositeimage released on January 14, 2005, soon after the Huygens probe had descended fromthe Cassini spacecraft to land on Titan. This week I asked one of the team members studying Titan's surface images to commenton the \"structure.\"Interview: Peter Smith, M.S., Research Scientist, Lunar and Planetary Lab, University ofArizona, Tucson, Arizona: \"That is what we think of as cryovolcanism. It's a dark lineand has a ghostly pattern around it that has right angle branching pattern and little stubbythings going of the side of it. [Editor's Note: The Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, Astronomy, and Spaceflightdescribes cryovolcanism as \"the eruption of water and other liquid or vapor-phasevolatiles, together with gas-driven solid fragments, onto the surface of a planet ormoon due to internal heating. It has been observed on only one world to date: Triton,the largest moon of Neptune. Geyser-like plumes of nitrogen were discovered onTriton during the flyby of Voyager 2. However, there is indirect evidence thatcryovolcanic processes may have taken place elsewhere in the outer Solar Systemand might even be active today on moons such as Europa and Enceladus.Ice-volcanic melt is the fluid or semi-fluid material associated with ice volcanism;like molten rock, it can have a wide variety of viscosities and other flow properties.\"(He laughs) But it's kind of speculation at this point. If you look carefully at the dark linethat is so straight, you'll see on either side of it there is a bright area unlike some of theother dark lines in dark fields. We have other images (submitted to Nature) that showbranches of this bright material going off and looking like something has flowed. Butinstead of a dark lane, you see a bright line. So, it's that bright material that suggests the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"cryovolcanism which I think has to be made of water and ammonia. These are thesubstances that really are dominant on Titan. The atmosphere is almost entirely nitrogenand that comes from the ammonia, I believe, which the moon was formed from. So thedominant materials are going to be the water and ammonia. When they combine, they canflow like a slow-moving river, viscous like a lava or flowing honey. Whereas the methane,it it was heated up and you tried to flow that, it would escape as a gas. So you wouldn'tcreate this type of feature.BUT WHY WOULD AMMONIA AND WATER FLOW IN STRAIGHT LINES WITH A90-DEGREE ANGLE AND ANOTHER STRAIGHT LINE?Apparently it's flowing down hill from another source to a low point and it just happens tobe on a constant flow, following the line of least resistance.NASA PREVIOUSLY OPERATED SETI, THE SEARCH FOR EXTRATERRESTRIALINTELLIGENCE, WHICH IS NOW OPERATED BY A PRIVATE GROUP. IS ITPOSSIBLE THAT TITAN COULD BE USED BY SOME NON-HUMANINTELLIGENCE AND THAT THESE ARE ACTUALLY CONSTRUCTED PIPES ORSOMETHING?Well that seems pretty unlikely to me. You know the temperature there is 90 degreesabove absolute zero. For us, that would be minus 200 to 300 degrees F. This is not a placethat is conducive to life forms.I'M NOT THINKING OF LIFE FORMS LIVING ON IT, BUT SOMETHING USING THESOLAR SYSTEM THE WAY WE MINE OUR PLANET. COULD TITAN BE USED TOHARVEST RESOURCES AND COULD THAT 90-DEGREE ANGLE BE ANARTIFICIAL STRUCTURE?Well, there are lots of 90-degree angles in nature. That's not the first conclusion you wouldcome to, in my opinion.IT STUCK OUT SO MUCH COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE VEIN-LIKE DARKNETWORK.We also think it's a different structure from the 'veins' you are talking about, but we think ithas more to do with cryovolcanism than some sort of alien pipeline.WHY WOULD CRYVOLCANISM GO STRAIGHT AND THEN MAKE A 90-DEGREETURN AND GO STRAIGHT AGAIN?Well, it's controlled by the terrain. If there is some sort of structure in the terrain thatslopes one way and then slopes another way, and it follows the slopes.ANY POSSIBILITY IT COULD BE ARTIFICIAL STRUCTURE?(Laughs) What kind of probability would you like to put on that? 1 in a billion? I'm not oneto say these things are not possible. It just seems very unlikely. It's not our first line ofthinking in this process, that's for sure. Other Mysterious Titan FeaturesIS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT THAT STRAIGHT LINE PATTERN IS UNUSUAL ENOUGHTO BE CONSIDERED MYSTERIOUS TO DATE?It's not the only mystery we have in this picture. I think when it comes to any of thestructures in the picture, they are all a little mysterious. Why are the lines dark? Whatmakes them darker than the surrounding terrain? There are a lot of mysteries here, but Idon't think any of the scientists on the team have been particularly struck by thestraightness of the lines. It's more: Why are they dark? Why is it surrounded by the brightmaterial? There are no end to mysteries in this picture.IF IT WERE A HYDROCARBON FLOW, IS IT POSSIBLE THOSE ARE CHANNELSTHE WAY WE THINK OF RIVERS OR SPRINGS ON THE EARTH WITH H2O. BUTINSTEAD, IT'S A DARK HYDROCARBON FLOWING IN THOSE DARK \"VEINS?\"What's probably flowing is liquid methane with maybe some ethane mixed in. Those arethe dominant liquids. Now, these liquids, like a river, they can have a lot of impurities andthose could be what the dark material is. So, probably there is some small fraction ofwhatever liquid flows in those channels is dark, tarry material. I would agree that'scertainly possible."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"THEN THE MYSTERY WOULD BE WHAT IS \"CUTTING\" THE NETWORK OFCHANNELS?Yes, it is apparently the same processes we see on the Earth. In other words, some sort ofrain, the way water ponds on Earth and flows down hill toward lakes and maybe even seasand maybe a dust sort of settling on things. All of the same processes, but instead of arocky hill or rock mountains that the water flows down, these are probably made out ofsolid ice. The liquid is probably methane, maybe a little ethane mixed in, and the darkmaterial is tholins.[Editor's Note: \"The tholins are hard, red-brownish substances made of complexorganic compounds. Earth's present oxidizing atmosphere does not allow tholinsynthesis. However, tholins can be made in the lab by subjecting mixtures ofmethane, ammonia, and water vapor to simulated lightning discharges. Comets andthe icy moons of the outer solar system may have reservoirs of tholins and otherpre-biotic organic chemicals. Simulation experiments and the ideas swirling around the discovery of organiccompounds extraterrestrially have fueled the new chemical discipline of \"abioticchemistry.\" Besides amino acids and other organic acids, experiments in abioticchemistry have yielded sugars, as well as purine and pyrimidine bases, some ofwhich are components of the nucleic acids DNA and RNA, and other biologicallysignificant substances. It seems very likely that these small organic molecules, that are now known to formreadily in the laboratory and appear to occur naturally extraterrestrially - that theseare the first building blocks of life. To what extent these substances arose on earth orwere brought in by the falling comets and asteroids that contributed to the finalaccretion of our planet is still being debated.\" Source: http://www.resa.net/nasa/xlife_intro.htm New mosaic with ground track drawn in taken by the Huygens probe from 4 kilometers altitude.Composite image source © March 2005 Lunar and Planetary Lab, University of Arizona, Tucson.More Information:See other Earthfiles about Saturn's Moons· 03/25/2005 -- Glow of Distant Worlds Seen For First Time· 03/20/2005 -- Astronaut John Young: \"The Moon Can Save Earth's Civilization.\"· 02/17/2005 -- Iapetus and Enceladus: Baffling Moons of Saturn· 01/22/2005 -- Titan - A Moon Where It Rains Methane Into Seas and Soils ofHydrocarbons· 01/14/2005 -- Updated - Cassini/Huygen's First Look At Titan's Surface· 11/25/2004 -- Closest Look At Mysterious Titan from Cassini Spacecraft· 06/11/2004 -- Cassini Spacecraft Will Rendezvous with Saturn July 1, 2004· 04/21/2004 -- At the X-Conference, Former Naval Intelligence Officer, C.
