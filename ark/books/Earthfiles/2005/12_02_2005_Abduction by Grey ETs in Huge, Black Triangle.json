The taller being kept telling me that time was onlyimportant to me.Time could be whatever they wanted it to be. And that size was irrelevant to them.\"- Bill Foster, Co-author, The Black Triangle Abduction December 2, 2005 Kittery, Maine - One of the most important unauthorized leaks ofalleged U. S. government information to investigators of the UFO/ET phenomena is atraining manual produced by the American War Department in April 1954 and entitled:\"Restricted SOM1-01 Majestic-12 Group Special Operations Manual: ExtraterrestrialEntities and Technology, Recovery and Disposal, TOP SECRET/MAJIC EYES ONLY. InChapter 2, Section 1, Paragraph 9, is the title: \"Description of Craft.\" Four categories aredetailed:a) Elliptical or disc shapeb) Fuselage or cigar shapec) Ovoid or circular shaped) Airfoil or triangular shapeWhite arrows point out side view and bottom view of extraterrestrial craft labeled,\"TYPE D: AIRFOIL OR TRIANGLE SHAPE\" on Page 20, MJ-12 SOM1-01 \"Extraterrestrial Entitiesand Technology, Recovery and Disposal.\" The bottom page text reads: \"Note: Illustrations in this diagram aregathered from documented sightings in Air Force and Central Intelligence and from examination of wreckagecollected from various sources years 1947-1953 inclusive.\" Leaked training manual distributedby Bob and Ryan Wood, www.majesticdocuments.com.Under Airfoil or triangular shape, the Majestic-12 SOM1-01 training manual states: \"Thiscraft is believed to be new technology due to the rarity and recency of the observations.Radar indicates an isosceles triangle profile, the longest side being nearly 300 feet inlength. Little is known about the performance of these craft due to the rarity of goodsightings, but they are believed capable of high speeds and abrupt maneuvers similar to or"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"exceeding the performance attributed to types 'a' and 'c'.\" Forty-three years after that SOM1-01 training manual was printed, on March 13, 1997, inthe early evening, a large triangle flew slowly in the sky over Phoenix, Arizona. Severaleyewitnesses estimated its size to be 2 miles long. And completely silent. To date, no onehas reported who, or what, was inside the series of aerial phenomena over Phoenix thatnight. But only four months before on November 16, 1996, around 10:45 p.m. in NorthCarolina, a retired sales manager of electronic equipment not only saw a huge triangleblock out the stars, he had other eyewitnesses with him which included his wife and twogood friends. Bill and Peggy Foster and the other couple, who wish to remain anonymous,had been partying at a social event outside Winston-Salem and were headed back home toYadkinville. The first thing that caught their attention were three red lights in the skycoming toward them very low, perhaps 100 feet above ground. Bill told me this week,\"You could see a straight edge and tons of stars on the outside of the edge. Butunderneath, apparently filled by the triangle, you could see nothing! It was totally black.\" Yadkinville was about a half-hour drive from the festivities in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The whole event lasted about seven minutes, Bill thought, and when he and Peggy gothome, they felt tired and went immediately to bed. The clock said 2 a.m. Later on, BillFoster could not understand how it could have been so late. In fact, perhaps two hourswere missing from their memories. Eventually the couple talked with Dr. John Mack in thePsychiatry Department at Harvard University, who had investigated the human abductionsyndrome and came to the conclusion that masses of people were not all sufferingdelusions and hallucinations. Dr. Mack took the human abduction syndrome seriously,following in the steps of pioneer and groundbreaker in the field, Budd Hopkins. Both Dr.Mack and Budd concluded that non-human intelligences with their own specific agendaswere interacting with Earth life. Dr. Mack recommended to Bill and Peggy Foster that they try to unlock the November 16,1996, missing time with hypnosis. The couple ended up working with Nadine Wheeler, alicensed hypnotherapist, who used hypnosis to help people with physical and emotionaltraumas. To everyone's surprise, in his first hypnosis session, Bill Foster began to sob. Hecould not believe that flashing through his mind were memories of at least elevenencounters with the big, black triangle in the sky between age 5 in 1946 and age 55 in1996. Further, inside the triangle craft were grey beings with \"huge blue-black liquidyeyes.\" The beings had egg-shaped heads where the narrow end was the chin. No ears,except holes. Small ridge for a nose and short slit for a mouth. There were no clothes oruniforms, only \"wet grey cement\"-colored skin that looked rough and wrinkled, but wasvery soft, \"like suede\" to touch. Bill and Peggy Foster worked with Nadine Wheeler to write about the unfolding hypnosisdiscoveries in a new book, The Black Triangle Abduction. Bill talked to me this weekabout his interactions with the entities. Interview: Bill Foster, 64-year-old retired sales manager of electronics company and co-author,The Black Triangle Abduction © 2005 by Bill Foster, Peggy Foster, and NadineWheeler: \"The beings were all about four feet except for what I termed the 'big guy.' I'venever had a name for this individual who was probably was max, 51/2 feet tall, whoseemed to tower above the other little guys. This seemed to be the one at that particularabduction and in all of mine (that I came up with subsequently) that was standing by myside, or I looked into his eyes quite a bit. He was much taller than the others.WHAT WERE HIS EYES LIKE?Very liquid pools. First of all, huge, pretty typical of the type that Whitley Strieber drew onthe cover of Communion. That egg-shaped, large eyes. But very dark blue, with a ripplingon the surface. No pupils, just one solid, dark cobalt blue with this liquidy ripple effectacross the top. I could never see an eyelash or eyelid to blink. Never saw a blink. But juststare into those eyes and I would get the most comforting I don't know - most comforting,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"warmest, happiest feeling in the world. I don't have great words to describe howcomforting and soothing that feeling is by just staring in the eyes. Telepathic CommunicationAnother interesting facet I've read that people say the greys communicated through ESP(telepathy). To me, that sounds wrong because it denotes 2-way communication and mostof these things just popped into my head. I found the best analogy that I could come upwith is if you've ever walked out of a room and forgot why you went to this other room,then you had to go back where you were to think about it again. And it just appears in yourbrain. You don't see a word or a picture or hear anything. You just have the memory inyour head. That sort of seems to be the way that I got communication. It just appeared as amemory in my mind.WHAT WAS THE MOST VIVID COMMUNICATION YOU REMEMBER OUT OFYOUR NEARLY DOZEN ABDUCTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE BEINGS WEREDOING?Oh, the continual mantra: 'Don't be afraid. We won't hurt you. Try not to be afraid.' The bigthing with me was 'Don't be afraid.' I was the world's most afraid. As a matter of fact, oneof the most unusual aspects I use a quote in the book I look back at the past abductionsand I ended up liking these guys. It bothered me that I actually liked them because itwould take some moments for me to recognize that I had been there before, like a wholedifferent life that you didn't know you had. And so when I told John Mack I felt badlyabout it, he said, 'Well, you probably feel like a traitor to the human race.' I said, 'That'sprobably right.' Why would I like them? After all, they hurt me. Painful Physical Probes by ETsTHEY HURT YOU HOW?The probes. I've gotten probes up the rear. I've gotten them over my genitals. I've gottenneedles in the back. I can remember some probes in my ear. They've put an implant up mynose, my left nostril, when I was about 12. So, I've had a lot of pain associated with them.So it isn't something you would normally like people for plus the fact that you're abductedwithout your knowledge. My biggest quandary is the fact that they can keep all of thisrepressed in your subconscious memory to where you do not remember consciously. It'samazing to me how well it can be buried in your mind!IF IT IS BURIED IN SECRET, DOES THAT MAKE YOU NERVOUS?It does because it seems like I have a whole different life that I don't know anything about!I had no conscious knowledge until four years ago that I ever had any contact with thissort of thing. I thought I was just a normal guy leading a normal life. My wife certainly didnot have any idea. I asked John Mack, 'When will this ever end?' And he said, 'Cradle tograve. It doesn't end.' Huge Triangle Over Phoenix, March 13, 1997Tim Ley and his family, looking north from their Phoenix home,were among hundreds of eyewitnesses who saw Phoenix \"lights.\" The Leys described forcomputer graphic artist above a large triangle-shaped aerial craft they watched move overheadon March 13, 1997, Phoenix, Arizona. Courtesy KSAZ-TV, Phoenix.WHEN I THINK OF LARGE TRIANGLES, I THINK OF THE MANY PEOPLE I HAVEINTERVIEWED OVER THE PAST 20 SOME YEARS, EITHER IN A MILITARYCONTEXT OR CIVILIAN CONTEXT, WHO HAVE SEEN THEM. THE ONE THATSTANDS OUT IS MARCH 13, 1997, OVER ARIZONA AND PHOENIX. THERE AREMULTIPLE EYEWITNESSES TO A LARGE TRIANGLE IN THE SKY. TWORESPONSIBLE REFERENCES COULD RELATE THE SIZE OF THE TRIANGLE TOSOMETHING ON THE GROUND AND ESTIMATED IT WAS ABOUT TWO MILES"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"LONG.YOUR DESCRIPTION WAS THAT MAYBE IT WAS THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALLFIELD, WHICH WOULD BE MAYBE 300 FEET IN DIAMETER. HAVE YOUTALKED WITH ANYONE WHO WAS AN EYEWITNESS TO THE MARCH 13, 1997,EVENT IN WHICH MULTIPLE PEOPLE SAW A GIGANTIC TRIANGLE ANDWOULD YOU THINK IT WAS THE SAME GREYS YOU HAVE ENCOUNTERED? ORSOMETHING E LSE ?No, as a matter of fact, I'm glad you brought that up because that original description (ofmine) that went out to all the original newspapers about the size of a football field wasapparently way wrong. This thing (Nov. 16, 1996) was very massive and probably twomiles long is not a bad description.When I first went into hypnosis and we were talking about the triangle, these bright lightscame on overhead not all at once. They seemed to be in some sort of random order a verywarm, not hot warm just a warming feeling and extremely bright. Then the car was liftedup. As a matter of fact, I was laughing to myself (under hypnosis) because I kept lookingover my shoulder at the road wondering if any traffic was going to hit me. I startedlaughing and the therapist asked, 'What are you laughing about?' I was hypnotized. And Isaid, 'I'm laughing because the car isn't even on the road! We're being lifted up and away atthe same time. It's pulling off to the left and taking us up with it.'And so this thing in looking up above us once the bright lights came on, I couldn't seeanything. But just prior to that, this thing was massive.IN THE CAR, COULD YOU LOOK THROUGH AND SEE LIKE A BEAM AROUNDYOUR CAR?No, what I saw was a series of what appeared to be little spot lights come on. If you took apeg board and you put a light above the pegboard and opened a few holes at a time untilall the little holes were shining light, that's sort of what they looked like. It was comingfrom all over the bottom of the thing until the whole area was so bright I couldn't tell whatI was looking at. But I had my eyes wide open and the bright light did not bother me at all.It was brighter than sunlight and I could stare right at it. 3-D Star Charts and \"Slide Show\"HAVE YOU EVER BEEN SHOWN A SCREEN WITH IMAGES ON IT?Oh, yeah, but it wasn't a screen. It was 283 pictures, but they were 3-D. It's like an Imax(movie theater) that you're in. At first, I thought I was looking at a slide show because theyjust whipped by, bam! bam! bam! The pictures went too fast. They kept telling me that Ihad to watch these during the instructional lessons when I was taken for the purpose ofwatching this slide show, or whatever you want to call it, until I understood. I thought Iwould never understand and finally one day I got it, whatever that means. In other words, Iguess I understood what I was supposed to learn from these. Oddly enough, and I domention this in the book, I started looking at the night sky when I went out. I'm noastronomer. I'm barely able to recognize the space station only because it's the brightestthing out there, along with the moon and Big Dipper. I would divide the sky into sectionsand I couldn't figure out why my mind was dividing the sky into sections. Then I realized itwas because of the star patterns, but the odd thing is and I can't even explain to you how Iknow this they are backwards! The ones that I was supposed to memorize or understand orwhatever the right word is for this, I saw them from the reverse side not from this (Earth)side from a space out there side. I don't know to this day what I'm supposed to know aboutthem except that these 283 slides went by faster than you can turn the pages in a book.ALL ASTRONOMICAL?No, one like the third one was a human nose. Now figure that out! I'm looking at a nose ona face, up close, a nose. Makes no sense to me at all. What am I looking at a nose for? The4th thing was like a planet, like a dying sun. You could tell there were maybe some coronaldischarges around the edges. It looked like a molten planet. The other 3 (slides) out of the5 were star charts.HAVE YOU DRAWN THE STAR CHARTS IN DETAIL?No, never tried.IT WOULD BE VERY INTERESTING TO COMPARE THEM TO BETTY ANDBARNEY HILL AND THE STAR CHART SHE DREW?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"That's true.[ Editor's Note: Star chart drawn by Betty Hill under hypnosis after she and herhusband, Barney, encountered craft and grey non-humans in the White Mountainsof New Hampshire on September 16, 1961. Star map drawn under hypnosis by alien abductee, Betty Hill, who said this was on a screenin the alien craft. Betty said the larger white circles with lines between were the distant binary starsystem,Zeta Reticuli 1 and 2. Yellow arrow points our our own Sun. Map by Betty Hill from book,The Interrupted Journey © 1966 by John Fuller. ] Alien Symbols On 8 Pillars Inside Triangle CraftAlien symbols placed vertically on one of 8 pillars inside largetriangle's \"hangar bay,\" as described by Bill Foster. Drawing © 2005 by Bill Foster.One of the things we did do was I remember seeing 8 posts, huge like 4 x 4 pillars orsomething in this hangar bay that the car was in. Anyway, at one point Nadine asked:'What's on those posts?' I said, 'There are symbols. They look sort of like Chinesecharacters or whatever. They are stacked one on top of the other, massive symbols goingall the way up the wall like 10 feet high. So, she took me out to a lighter hypnosis and hadme draw the symbols of this one post, which we put in the book. I was amazed I coulddraw them. I didn't remember them consciously at all.COMING BACK TO THE IDEA THAT YOU WERE LOOKING AT STAR CHARTSTHAT WERE THE OPPOSITE FROM THE WAY WE WOULD LOOK AT THEMFROM THE EARTH THAT YOU WERE LOOKING AT THEM FROM ANOTHERPOINT OF VIEW SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED THAT WE ARE DEALINGWITH ENTITIES FROM PARALLEL UNIVERSES, OTHER GALAXIES, OTHERDIMENSIONS. DOES ANY OF THAT SEEM POSSIBLE TO YOU WHEN YOU THINKABOUT THEIR SHOWING YOU STAR CHARTS THAT SEEM TO BE FROM AN"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"OPPOSITE PERSPECTIVE FROM OURS?Personally, I would much rather believe for the sake of my peace of mind that they comefrom \"another planet\" that is somewhere right out there you can put your finger on, asopposed to another dimension that is hard for me to grasp. The only way I can senseanother dimension is what I think I read from Stephen Hawking who said, 'If you want tosense another dimension, every time you put your hand inside your aquarium where yourfish are, you have come from another dimension and the fish think you have come fromanother dimension.' I can understand that. They can't see you without your hand in theaquarium. Grey Aliens Say Time and Size Are Not Relevant To ThemTHINKING OF THAT METAPHOR, IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THESEEXPERIENCES YOU'VE HAD WITH THE TALL GREY AND SHORT ONES THATLEAVES YOU WITH A RESIDUE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER INTUITIVELY ABOUTWHETHER THEY ARE FROM ANOTHER SOLAR SYSTEM OR GALAXY ORWHERE?No. I honestly don't have a feeling. That must be my most frequently asked question. I canlook back on each abduction and asked that a dozen times and never got an answer. Theonly things that I found fascinating that I did seem to get an answer to, or somehow is:time has no relevance to them. Time has no relevance to them. The taller being kept tellingme that time was only important to me. Time could be whatever they wanted it to be. Andthat size was irrelevant to them. I asked at one point how big their ship was because itlooked massive. He said, 'It's whatever size we need it to be.'[ Editor's Note: Stephen Hawking, Ph.D., Astrophysicist, is author of The Universein a Nutshell and A Brief History of Time. Stephen William Hawking was born on 8January 1942 (300 years after the death of Galileo) in Oxford, England. Since 1979,he has researched cosmology in the Department of Applied Mathematics andTheoretical Physics at Cambridge University and holds the post of LucasianProfessor of Mathematics, a post also held in 1663 by Isaac Newton. ProfessorHawking is the recipient of many awards, medals and prizes and is a Fellow of TheRoyal Society and a Member of the US National Academy of Sciences. Stephen Hawking has worked on the basic laws which govern the universe. WithRoger Penrose he showed that Einstein's General Theory of Relativity implied spaceand time would have a beginning in the Big Bang and an end in black holes. Hediscovered was that black holes should not be completely black, but should emitradiation and eventually evaporate and disappear. Another conjecture is that theuniverse has no edge or boundary in imaginary time. This would imply that the waythe universe began was completely determined by the laws of science. ]HOW DO YOU INTERPRET THE MEANINGLESS OF TIME IN THE ALIENS'CONTEXT?At one point, I think I discovered, or it was told to me, in our years if you wanted to pin anage, the tall grey was something like 400 (Earth) years old. And that the little guys, thehelper greys, were about 200 years old. He said, 'If our Earth time applied, which itdoesn't.'I don't know what to make of that other than if I wanted to think in terms of age, they musthave been around for a long time. And continue to be around a long time.WHY IS IT, IF TIME IS SO IMPORTANT TO US ON THIS PLANET, IT WOULD HAVENO RELEVANCE TO WHERE THEY COME FROM?Isn't that unusual? And actually, a lot of things to do with time, when I think about it, weimpose on ourselves. We wear watches. If you live on a desert island, time wouldn't meanmuch, except for light and dark.EXACTLY. WE HAVE THE ORBIT OF THE EARTH AROUND THE SUN AND DARKAND NIGHT. SO IF YOU CAME FROM A PLANET WHERE THERE WAS NO NIGHTAND IT WAS ALL BRIGHT, THEN MAYBE THERE WOULD BE NO SENSE OFTIME.That's true. You wouldn't have a cycle to worry about. And years are just markers we putin there.SO MAYBE THEY COME FROM A PLANET AROUND A COUPLE OF SUNS WHERETHERE IS NO DARKNESS AND YET, THE ISSUE IS: WHAT DO THEY WANT"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"HERE?Yeah. That is the question. What do they want? I have no idea, but I do get the sense thatthey are not here for our benefit. And the easy answer to that is: the reason they are nothere for our benefit is we're doing everything their way. That's why we're abducted and wedon't abduct them! So, obviously whatever they are doing benefits whatever they want todo, as opposed to anything we might have for wishes because whether you want theabductions to end or not, it doesn't end. So, they are in control of that.WHAT KNOWLEDGE DO GOVERNMENTS HAVE THAT KEEPS THIS ALL SOQUIET?That's the big question, isn't it? I mean, I can't believe that the government does not have agreat deal of knowledge about this. After all, if you believe the government's line that thereare no abductions and we're all just crazy, then this disease is worse than cancer. We oughtto have a charity in our name. Millions of us should be getting help from the government toget cured. But nobody offers any cures.AND IT DOESN'T STOP.And it doesn't stop.
