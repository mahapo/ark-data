Fifty minutes earlier, the spacecraft's probe had been run over by the comet.That collision kicked up plumes of ejected material, seen here streaming away from the back side of the comet.This image was taken by the flyby craft's high-resolution camera.

Now she is a senior research scientist and AssistantDirector of the McDonald Observatory in Austin. She and several hundred scientistsaround the world are helping to analyze the spectral data from the Deep Impact crash withComet Tempel I on July 3 to 4, 2005. That night, Dr. Cochran was in Hawaii at the Kech Itelescope, the largest in the world, watching to see if a light flare at the moment theimpactor hit the very dim magnitude 11 comet could be seen.Moment of impact on potato-shaped Comet Tempel I at 10:52 p.m. PDT, July 3, 2005 / 1:52 a.m. EDT, July 4,2005.Image by NASA, ESA, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab.Interview:Anita Cochran, Ph.D., Asst. Director, McDonald Observatory and Senior ResearchScientist, University of Texas, McDonald Observatory, Austin, Texas: \"We didn't see aflash. We saw a more gradual brightening and increase in the size of the brightness in theregion we were looking at.BUT YOU WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO SEE IN REAL TIME. THAT LITTLEIMPACTOR MACHINE WORKED. THE IDEA OF VELOCITY GIVING THEENERGY, INSTEAD OF AN EXPLOSION, IS GREAT."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"It is! It was a bold experiment, a very different approach than most astronomy, which isusually a passive science. We sit there to see what the universe hands us. This wasdifferent. We were being physicists. We were actually changing things (making a crater inTempel I comet).Virtually the whole astronomy community of the world (several hundred scientists) isinvolved with analyzing Comet Tempel I data at this point.\"We did not know if Comet Tempel I was going to get extremely bright upon Deep Impact'shit or just a little bit brighter. At the Kech I post in Hawaii, what we saw was the cometbrighten, not exactly at the time of impact, but a little bit later. What it looks like from thespectra is that the dust was the predominant trigger for the increase in brightness. Thiscomes about because as you increase the amount of dust around, you get an increase insurface area so there is more reflection of solar light. It's kind of like in the old fashioneddays when people would clap blackboard erasers together and get all this dust in the air.You would be able to see it because it reflected the light.NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured the Deep Impact collision with Comet Tempel Ias the 820-pound impactor crashed into the comet at 23,000 mph.

Feldman, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab. Data Analysis - Some Unknowns Amid the ExpectedSo, what we saw was a large increase in the light because of the increase in the surfacearea of the dust. And in the spectrum, it was a lot more subtle. We did see a change in theamounts of various species (of dust and gases) that we were seeing and we saw some newlines that appeared the first night in our spectrum that are telling us about something thatcame short-term. But as far as the Keck spectra are concerned, we still haven't identifiedwhat feature it is we were seeing. We did see it go away the next night. So we are seeing avery short-lived something that came about because of the impact. But I can't give you anymore definitive answer of what it is because WE haven't figured it out yet! (laughs)WHAT COULD BE TRANSIENT?It could be all sorts of things. It could be a heated bit of rock. It could be a fragment of amolecular species that did not live very long. Or it could be something that's reacting withthe Impactor and that's something we haven't eliminated yet as a possibility.CAN YOU GIVE A BREAK DOWN OF WHAT YOU'VE SEEN SO FAR IN SPECTRA?The comet before the impact was not very active and in some senses, it made it a littleharder for us because it wasn't very bright (only 11 magnitude). The spectra we've seen sofar is an increase in the normal species, but we've also seen an increase in:formaldehydea little bit of acetylenemethyl alcoholmaybe carbon monoxide (difficult to observe accurately because the Earth'satmosphere gets in the way)water, since the comet is probably 80% water iceSo, we see things we sort of expected to see, but there were transient species that we don'tknow yet what they were."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"4.5 Billion Years AgoWHAT DOES THAT TEACH US ABOUT THE SOLAR SYSTEM'S EVOLUTION?So far we haven't figured out what we're looking at. But once we know what we're lookingat, we can quantify how much of the material and get a much better picture of what thecomet's composition is. And the reason that we care is that the comet is made up of thebuilding blocks of the outer solar system. Comets ARE the building blocks of the outersolar system and they have not undergone a lot of change. So, what Comet Tempel I willtell us when we make sense of the data is what the conditions were like temperature,pressure, types of gases that existed when the planets formed.THAT IS GOING BACK 4.5 BILLION YEARS AGO?Right.DO WE NOT ALREADY KNOW THAT?We do not know that already. When we look at planets, they've undergone so muchchange that we would have to be incredibly good modelers to understand what they lookedlike in the beginning. Most people are aware of things like earthquakes, volcanoes, windand rain and things like that life on Earth has profound influence on the chemistry of theEarth. So, with any planet today, it looks very different that probably it looked when itformed, which is why we want to look at the small things that don't have a lot of changeson them (such as comets) because they are too small to have volcanoes, earthquakes andthings like that. Then we'll be able to understand the temperature and pressure conditions.Some of the big questions in our understanding of the early solar system is: how much ofthe material that formed the solar system was unchanged from when the stars firstproduced it? And how much of the material came from the original molecular cloud thatformed the sun? Because of the violent nature of forming the solar system, the originalmolecular cloud was actually changed quite a bit. Those are the kinds of questions we arestill asking.WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT TO KNOW?It's a curiosity-driven thing. We want to know where we came from and how we cameabout and where we fit into the whole universe picture. It's not like it's going to changehow we live day to day, but it's just man's quest to understand his origins.THE ISSUE OF HOW MUCH CHANGE THERE HAS BEEN OVER 4.5 BILLIONYEARS, HOW CAN THE TEMPEL I COMET GIVE INSIGHTS INTO THAT IF ITHASN'T CHANGED AT ALL?It gives us a starting view. Then as we look at other objects, we'll know how they started.And it's easier go from knowing both ends and try to figure out the middle than if you onlyknow one side. Instead of looking at the tail of the elephant and trying to figure out what itis, we'll have more pieces of the elephant. Comet Tempel I from Kuiper Belt"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Sun and solar system are drawn inside Pluto's Orbit which is inside the Kuiper Belt that beginsaround the orbit of Neptune and extends outward more than a billion miles toward the Oort Cloud made up ofbillions of icy comets. One of astronomy's great mysteries is why there is a defined boundary for the KuiperBelt,a clear separation from the more distant Oort Cloud. Illustration courtesy NASA and JPL.DO YOU KNOW IF TEMPEL I CAME FROM THE OORT CLOUD OR KUIPER BELT?It is most likely to have come from the Kuiper Belt.THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST IMMEDIATE MATERIAL FROM WHICH THESOLAR SYSTEM FORMED AND CONSOLIDATED FROM THE ORIGINAL GASES?Yes, the Kuiper Belt is a region that basically was formed from Neptune on outward andhas not moved from that region, whereas the Oort Cloud objects actually formed slightlycloser to the Sun. But because of all the stirring up of the orbits by the large planets, theywere thrown out to the Oort Cloud.Thus, the Kuiper Belt is actually the reservoir that's been pretty much where it is today forthe last 4.5 billion years. So, we understand much better where the Kuiper Belt objectshave been than the Oort cloud comets.On the other hand, Comet Tempel I has been in the inner solar system for many, manyorbits. That means the outer parts of Tempel I have been changed by heating from the Sun,which is exactly why the Deep Impact mission was trying to bash a big hole so we couldsee deeper down inside and go back to the fresher (older untouched) material. Earth Water Not from Comet Ice?DO YOU THINK THAT COMETS LIKE TEMPEL I AND OTHERS ARERESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THE OCEAN WATER ON OUR PLANET?No, and I think the vast majority of astronomers do not think that comets were the bringersof the vast majority of the water on Earth. We believe only 10% to 15% of the water onthe Earth could have come from comets.WHERE WOULD ALL THE REST HAVE COME FROM?That's still very much a debate. One possibility is that it came from objects in the outer partof the asteroid belt. The other part is that it was probably formed into the Earth early onand actually is original material.WOULD THAT MEAN THAT MARS MIGHT HAVE FORMED OUT OF THE SAMEMATERIAL AND THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN ITS EARLY WATER, TOO?That's a possibility, yes.I'VE ALWAYS ASSUMED OUR OCEANS WERE FROM COMETARY ICE.So have many astronomers, but that comets don't explain the Earth's water is new thinkingthat has come about in the last ten or fifteen years.WHY?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Because of our spectral studies. Instead of looking at just the big dominant features, we'velooked at some of the very fine details and we've learned that the Earth's water has a verydifferent signature of the isotope deuterium, which is essentially a heavy form ofhydrogen. That ratio of deuterium to hydrogen indicates that it is not likely that the cometswere the bringer of the water. Ten to fifteen percent might be linked to comets, but notmuch more.WHAT IS THE PROCESS OUT OF GAS TO SOLID BODIES THAT H2O COULDMAINTAIN SO MUCH WATER ON EARTH WITHOUT BOILING OFF ORDISAPPEARING?We think it was tied up in the rocks originally. We know that the universe is predominantlyhydrogen and then everything else after that is about 25% of the universe and most of thatis helium. But if you bring together oxygen with the hydrogen, they don't have to comeand form into the rocks as water. They can come as other species, but as the material washeated in the inner part of the planet (below the crust) because of radioactive decay, youcan get various species into the gas form. Then water is a logical thing to form at the righttemperatures.IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THERE IS SO MUCH WATER ON THIS PLANET.There is indeed. More About Deep Impact Data UpcomingWHEN WILL YOU HAVE MORE DEFINITIVE ANALYSIS ON THE UNKNOWNS?The data we collected at the Kech Observatory are as complicated as any data set in theworld because we were at extremely high resolution so we could see very, very fine detail.But as a result, the data are much harder to reduce than lower resolution data. So, my goalis to have it reduced enough to talk about it at the end of the summer in the Division ofPlanetary Sciences (AAAS) meeting in Cambridge, England beginning September 3,2005.4We've got a preliminary reduction that I don't trust yet from the night of the impact. buthopefully over the next couple of weeks from now, I'll be able to say more.IS THE CAMBRIDGE MEETING GOING TO BE THE FIRST PUBLICPRESENTATION ABOUT THE DEEP IMPACT DATA?No, actually there is a meeting on Asteroids, Comets and Meteors in Brazil beginningAugust 8, 2005.\"More Information:Deep Impact mission background: See 062905EarthfilesWebsites:NASA Deep ImpactComet Tempel 1: http://deepimpact.jpl.nasa.gov/science/tempel1.htmlhttp://deepimpact.umd.edu/amateur/where_is.shtmlhttp://spaceplace.jpl.nasa.gov/en/kids/deepimpact/deepimpact.shtmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
