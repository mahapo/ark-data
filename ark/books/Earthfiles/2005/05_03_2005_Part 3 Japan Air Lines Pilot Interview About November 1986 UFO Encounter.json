Return to Part 2 May 3, 2005 - Thurmont, Maryland - The following transcript is from an interviewconducted in January 1987 by the U. S. Federal Aviation Administration ChiefInvestigator, John Callahan, with Japan Air Lines Pilot, Kenju Terauchi, about his JALFlight 1628 encounter with a massive UFO on November 16, 1986. The transcript wasprovided to Earthfiles by U. S. Navy Research Physicist, Bruce Maccabee, Ph.D., after Dr.Maccabee obtained the case file records from the CIA. Transcript of Interview with JAL Pilot,Kenju Terauchi (cont):“Then three to seven seconds later, a fire like from jet engines stopped and becamea small circle of lights as they began to fly in level flight at the same speed as wewere, showing numerous numbers of exhaust pipes. However, the center area of theship where below an engine might be was invisible. The middle of the body of theship sparked an occasional stream of lights, like a charcoal fire, from right to left and"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"from left to right. Its shape was a square, flying 500 feet to 1,000 feet in front of us,very slightly higher in altitude than us. Its size was about the same size as the bodyof a DC-8 jet, but with numerous exhaust pipes. The firing of the exhaust jets varied,perhaps to maintain balance, some became stronger than others and some becameweaker than others, but seemed controlled automatically. We did not feel threatened or in danger because the spaceship moved so suddenly.We probably would have felt more in danger and would have been prepared toescape if the spaceships were shaking unsteadily or were unable to stop themselves.It is impossible for any man-made machine to make a sudden appearance in front ofa jumbo jet that is flying 910 kilometers per hour and to move along in a formationparalleling our aircraft. The ships moved in formation for about three to fiveminutes. Then two ships moved forward in a line, again slightly higher in altitudethan we were and 40 degrees to our left. We did not report this action to theAnchorage Center. Honestly, we were simply breathtaken. Communication Interference The VHF communication, both in transmitting and receiving, were extremelydifficult for ten or fifteen minutes while the little ships came close to us and ofteninterfered with communication from the Anchorage Center. However,communication conditions became just as good as soon as the ships left us. Therewere no abnormalities in the equipment or the aircraft. I have no idea why theycame so close to us. Also, there was a pale white flat light on the direction where the ships flew away,moving in a line along with us, in the same direction and same speed and in the samealtitude as we were. Anchorage Center Saw Nothing On Radar Again, we began communicating with the Anchorage Center. We said that we couldsee a light in the 10 o'clock position at the same altitude and wondered if they couldsee anything in their radar? The Anchorage Center replied that they saw nothing intheir radar. I thought it would be impossible to find anything on an aircraft radar if alarge, ground radar did not show anything. But I judged the distance of the objectvisually and it was not very far. I set the digital weather radar distance in 20 miles,radar angle to horizon. There it was on our JAL screen, a large, green and roundobject which had appeared seven or eight miles (13 to 15 kilometers) away, wherethe direction of the object was. We reported to the Anchorage Center that our aircraft radar caught the object withinseven or eight miles in 10 o'clock position. We asked if Anchorage could catch it ontheir ground radar, but it did not seem they could at all. Normally, it appears in redwhen an aircraft radar catches another aircraft. I wonder if the metal used in thespaceship is different from ours (that caused the color to be green)?While we were communicating with the Anchorage Center, the two pale white lightsgradually moved to the left side and to left diagonally back 30 degrees, as if theyunderstood our conversation and then when they were beside our aircraft, theytotally disappeared from our radar. When the lights were in front of us, the ships were positioned slightly higher inaltitude than we were. But now, they placed themselves slightly below the horizonwhere it was most difficult for us to see them. The distance between us was stillabout seven to eight miles visually. When we started to see Ft. Yukon diagonallybelow us at the right, the sun was setting down in the southwest, painting the sky ina slightly red stripe approximately two to three millimeters and gave a bit of light.But the east side was still pitch dark. Far in front of us, there were lights increasingfrom the U. S. Military Eielson AFB and Fairbanks. The lights were still following usat exactly the same distance. However, it was too dark to identify by only the lightswhether or not they were the same two spaceships that appeared in front of us a fewminutes ago. It seemed that we were flying in the lighter side and gave them theadvantage of being on the dark side. We had no fears so far, but began to worry since we had no idea about theirpurpose. When the lights from the Eielson AFB and Fairbanks became clear andbright, two very bright lights appeared suddenly from the north from a belt of lights,perhaps four or five mountains away. Confusion About Alaska Pipeline Lights"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" The extremely bright lights reflected on snow on the side of the mountains andseemed even brighter. We wondered if they were searching something on the groundsurface or were to (attract?) or lead something? The flight above Alaska territory isgenerally in the daytime and it is confusing to identify those kind of lights. It cannotbe a base for the spaceship? Is it a movie? There was something. Oh, yes, it is theAlaska pipeline. The lights must be a pump station for the pipeline. I got it(understood). 'Silhouette of Gigantic Spaceship' Causes Fear We arrived at the sky above the Eielson AFB and Fairbanks. It was a clear night.The lights were extremely bright to eyes that were used to the dark. How bright itwas! We were just above the bright city lights and we checked the pale white lightbehind us. Alas! There was a silhouette of a gigantic spaceship. We must run awayquickly! I radioed: 'Anchorage Center, this is JL 1628, requesting a change of course to right45 degrees.' It felt like a long time before we received permission. When wechecked our rear, there was still the (huge walnut-shaped) ship following us. 'This is JL 1628. Again, requesting for change the course 45 degrees to the right.' Wehad to get away from that object! 'JL 1628. This is the Anchorage Center. We advise you to continue and take 360degree turn.' 'JL 1628, thank you. We will continue 360 degree turn.' It was too slow to circle in the auto=pilot mode. Therefore, we switched to themanual mode and set to turn right on a 30 degrees bank. We looked to our rightforward, but did not see any light. We were relieved, thinking the object might haveleft us and returned to the level flight. But when we checked to our rear, the (huge)object was still there in exactly the same place. 'Anchorage Center, this is JL 1628. The object follows us in formation. We request achange in altitude, 31,000 feet, yes, 31,000 feet.' 'This is the Anchorage Center, JL 1628, ascend to 31,000 feet.' The consumption of fuel during this flight was almost as expected, but there wasonly 3,800 pounds left and as such was not enough for extra flying for runningaround. We have got to arrive at Anchorage. 'Anchorage Center, this is JL 1628. We request permission for the direct flight toTalkeetna.' 'JL 1628, this is the Anchorage Center. We authorize the direct flight to Talkeetna.' We checked behind us again. The ship was in formation and ascending with us. Wewondered and feared as to their purpose. 'JL 1628, this is the Anchorage Center. Would you like to request scramble forconfirmation?' 'The Anchorage Center, this is JL 1628. We would not request scramble.' We turnedthe offer down quickly. I knew that in the past, there was a U. S. military fighter called the mustang that hadflown up high for a confirmation and a tragedy had happened to it. Even the F-15with the newest technology had no guarantee of safety against the creature with anunknown degree of scientific technology. We flew toward Talkeetna at an altitude of31,000 feet. The spaceship was still following us, not leaving us at all. United Airline Pilot Sees Object Near JAL Plane About the same time, a United Airline passenger aircraft which left Anchorage toFairbanks flew into the same air zone and began communicating with the AnchorageCenter. We heard United transmitting that there was an object near JL 1628 andrequesting for confirmation. We heard that the Anchorage Center was saying to theUnited Airline aircraft that JL 1628 was at an altitude of 31,000 feet. It sounded as if"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Anchorage Center had the United Airline aircraft fly above the spaceship. We wereflying the east side of Mt. McKinley. The United Airline aircraft came close to us.The United Airline aircraft requested us to flash landing lights for visualconfirmation and we both confirmed our positions visually. The United Airlineaircraft was coming close to us. We knew that they were watching us. When theUnited plane came by our side, the spaceship disappeared suddenly and there wasnothing but the light of the moon. The strange encounter ended at 75 miles north of Talkeetna, 150 miles (276kilometers) away from Anchorage. It comprised approximately 50 minutes of flighttime.”Return to Part 1More Information:For further information about the worldwide UFO phenomena, please see EarthfilesArchive (partial list below) and my books, An Alien Harvest and the 2-volume Glimpsesof Other Realities in the Earthfiles Shop.· 04/28/2005 -- Dozens of Unidentified Aerial Objects Videotaped Over Sonora,California· 04/17/2005 -- 1949 Aerial Disc Covered-Up By Project Blue Book As \"Kite\"· 04/14/2005 -- \"Battle of Los Angeles,\" February 25, 1942· 04/13/2005 -- Highly Strange Dog Death in Arkansas; 2000-Pound Bull Dropped On LogPile· 03/08/2005 -- Flying Disc Paced Airliner Over Puget Sound Navy Yard· 02/21/2005 -- Update d - Bull and Cow Mutilations Northwe st of Corpus Christi, Te xas· 01/15/2005 -- Bull and Cow Mutilations Northwe st of Corpus Christi, Te xas· 12/10/2004 -- Part 3: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation?· 12/10/2004 -- Part 4: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation?· 10/29/2004 -- Part 2: Update On Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia, UFO Case.· 09/06/2004 -- Part 1: Terry Sherman - 1996 Interview About High Strangeness on FortDuche sne , Utah Ranch · 09/06/2004 -- Part 2: Terry Sherman - 1996 Interview AboutHigh Strangeness on Fort Duchesne, Utah Ranch· 08/29/2004 -- Another Pictogram in Poland· 08/09/2004 -- Pictograms in Poland· 07/07/2004 -- Fourth 2004 Crop Formation in Poland Has Multiple Parts· 06/17/2004 -- More 2004 Holland and Poland Crop Formations· 06/03/2004 -- Updated - Second 2004 Pictogram Crop Formation in Poland· 05/19/2004 -- Why Ball Lightning Does Not Explain Facts in Mexico Air Force Infraredand Radar Eve nt· 05/17/2004 -- Update d - Crop Formation Re porte d in Zabno, Poland· 02/14/2004 -- More High Strange ne ss in the Michigan Sky· 02/06/2004 -- Unidentified Aerial Objects - Again! - Over Michigan· 01/19/2004 -- Earthfiles and Radio Audience Feedback About Anomalous Sky Objects· 01/17/2004 -- High Strangene ss in the Napole on, Michigan Sky· 01/17/2004 -- Update on Horton, Michigan Ice Circle· 01/10/2004 -- Strange Unidentified Aerial Objects in Indiana and Pennsylvania· 10/17/2003 -- 2003 \"UFO Flap\" in Ohio· 04/22/2003 -- UFO Expe rie nce s Re porte d by Fore st Fire Lookouts· 02/01/2003 -- Six Unidentified Triangular Aerial Craft Over Uinta Mountains, Utah· 01/14/2003 -- Part 2: Cape Girardeau and Charlette Mann's 1991 Letter About HerG randfathe r's Expe rie nce· 11/03/2002 -- Strange Light Triggered Magnetic Alarm and Was Photographed inMontre al, Canada· 04/17/2002 -- Part 2 - Unidentified Aerial Craft Over Farmington and Aztec, NewMexico in Spring 1949· 03/16/2002 -- Part 1 - 'Huge Saucer Armada' Shocked Farmington, New Mexico 52Ye ars Ago· 01/19/2002 -- Nine Unidentified Aerial Objects Tracked at 8,000 mph on 1952 Radar· 02/06/2000 -- Large Yellow Sphere In Snohomish, Washington· 12/26/1999 -- Hubble Repair, Gamma Ray Bursts and Unidentified Aerial Objects· 12/22/1999 -- Update - Unidentified \"Arrowhead\"-Shaped Object in California Sky· 06/28/1999 -- Anothe r 90-Degre e Ae rial Turn Associate d with Contrail· 04/09/1999 -- Strange Lights In MissouriWebsites:JAL 1628 Over Alaska: http://www.ufoevidence.org/cases/case287.htmPhysicist Bruce Maccabee JAL Analysis: http://brumac.8k.com/JAL1628/JL1628.htmlMajestic 12 Documents: http://www.majesticdocuments.comAmerican Presidents: http://www.presidentialufo.com"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
