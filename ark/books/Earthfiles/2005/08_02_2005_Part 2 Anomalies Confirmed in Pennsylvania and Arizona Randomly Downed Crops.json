Return to Part 1 August 1, 2005 Grass Lake, Michigan - In the third week of May 2005, three long,parallel strips of wheat were reported by a Phoenix radio station to be laid down in a fieldnear Lower Buckeye Road and 75th Avenue in the Tolleson suburb of Phoenix, Arizona.Jeffrey Wilson, Director of the Independent Crop Circle Researchers' Association(ICCRA) in Ohio, asked Rod Bearcloud Berry to investigate which he did on May 19. Jeffe-mailed, \"Bearcloud reports that there are three linear flattened pathways approximately525 to 600 feet in length that are parallel to the power lines and the road. Interspersedbetween the three pathways are a series of irregular flattened shapes, none of which crossany tramlines.\" [ See 052605 Earthfiles. ] Other investigators confirmed there were three wheat fields in Tolleson similarly affectedwith straight, randomly downed crop. Phoenix resident, Kathy Doore, volunteered toosample the three fields for analysis by ICCRA and biophysicist W. C. Levengood of thePinelandia Biophysical Laboratory in Grass Lake, Michigan. ICCRA and Levengoodconfirmed that the wheat growth nodes of the downed and standing plants inside the oddpatterns were definitely elongated when compared to control plants collected from outsidethe randomly downed sections. W. C. Levengood also found other anomalies such as anode expulsion cavity, a deformed peduncle and magnetite particles sampled from therandomly downed soil. I talked with him last week about his formal report, which isincluded under More Information after interview.Interview: W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist, Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory, Grass Lake,Michigan: \"In plants well sampled from the three Phoenix (Tolleson) fields by Phoenixresident, Kathy Doore, I started off in the usual manner by looking at the node lengths onthe plants. After I collected the nodes for the lab exam, I realized that Kathy, whocollected field samples and controls, did so in a manner that gave us more information thanusual from the randomly downed and upright wheat plants. What she did was gather allstanding and downed crop samples together within five to ten feet of each other. Thatallowed us to break this study of the node lengths into three categories.

Then you do a statistical analysis on that to get the mean value and standarddeviation.What I found was that the downed plants had a high statistically significant increase innode expansion, compared to the controls of 54% increase. In the upright plants in theformation, a 37% increase. Both are statistically significant compared to the control plants."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"After seeing that, I saw that the energy that caused this was late in the development cycle.And I wondered if it had any effect on the seeds which were probably close todevelopment? If so, could I detect it? Seed Growth TestThat's why I did the study of the seed growth, the vigor factor that determinesdevelopment. The higher the factor, the more vigor in the seeds. But what I found wasalmost an inverse correlation.1) The downed plants in the formation had the lowest development factor of 1.47.Figure 3. Bioassay to Test Seed VigorDowned plants sampled in Tolleson, Arizona, wheat had lowest development factor of 1.47.All seed test photographs © 2005 by W. C.

Visually, the seeds looked perfectly normal. But"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"when you do this bioassay, I found their growth vigor was suppressed.WHY IS IT IN OTHER CROP FORMATIONS, THERE HAS BEEN ACCELERATEDGROWTH FROM SEEDS SAMPLED FROM INSIDE PATTERNS?OK, the reason for that is it depends on the stage of plant development in which theenergies interact - plus the complexity of the energies. Don't forget that microwave energyis not the only thing that hits the plants. There are ion electron avalanches which canenhance the growth. So, it's the ratio of the two microwaves and ion electron avalanches.You never know what that ratio is until you do a bioassay and look at the developmentfactor.SO, YOU CAN EITHER END UP WITH STUNTED SEEDS OR INVIGORATED SEEDS.Exactly. It all depends on the ratio and how the energies are made up. These are what wecall 'initial' or 'end point' energies. The two primary ones that do the damage that we canactually measure easily in the lab are the microwaves and the ion electron avalanches. Themicrowaves generally predominate in terms of damage to seed development. In terms ofaccelerated growth and higher vigor, that is the ion electron avalanches which cause moresubtle effects. Expulsion Cavities in Sampled Tolleson WheatThere is another factor that I would like to mention. I found that in addition to theelongated nodes, there were expulsion cavities in the sampled Tolleson wheat plants.Figure 2. Expulsion CavityExpulsion cavity formed at apical node in a fully mature wheat plant.Photograph © 2005 by W. C. Levengood.[ Editor's Note: Expulsion cavities are holes in the cellulose fibers in the outerepidermis of the growth nodes. The tough fibers are literally pushed apart fromwithin. That happens when there is a high pressure build up in the growth nodemoisture exposed to microwave energy emitted by the spinning plasma vorticeshypothesized to be the creating force of crop formations. ] IS THERE ANY ENERGY BESIDES MICROWAVE THAT COULD CAUSE THEEXPULSION CAVITIES? No, I don't think so. The first scientific paper I wrote about this was published in theinternational journal for plant biology, Physiologia Plantarum. A Deformed Peduncle Implies Wheat Interactedwith Energies Before Randomly Downed EventFigure 2. Deformed Peduncle"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Fig. 2, Deformed peduncle.Photograph © 2005 by W. C. Levengood.But, in addition to elongated nodes and expulsion cavities, there was a deformed peduncle.The interesting thing here is that the expulsion cavities occurred along with a deformedpeduncle, which is rare. The peduncle is the main stalk or stem bearing the solitary seedhead on plants such as wheat, corn, rye, barley and other grasses. Most people would callit a plant stem, like a stem on a flower. In the Phoenix fields, one of the plants sampledhad a deformed peduncle like those we have seen before from England and Montana.The problem here is that this was found in the same plant sample as the expulsion cavity.The incongruity comes with the fact that the expulsion cavity only forms when thosecellulose fibers on the outside of the plant become very tough in the late stages of the plantdevelopment.Yet, the peduncle must become deformed much earlier on when that particular plant tissueis in its early stage of development, when the cell division is very high, and it gets hit withthe spinning plasma energies. When the cell division is high, the cells are very subject tooutside energy influence. But, the rest of the plant develops normally. The interesting thingis here is the seed head which you would expect to be even more deformed because it's thegerminal tissue. But the seed head developed normally above the deformed pedunclebecause it is not ready yet to go through the stage of maximum cell development, ormitosis.So, what that means is the energy is extremely selective and hits fields at certain times,sometimes more than once, and whatever happens to be at a high development stage getsseverely altered in its developmental pattern. This particular Tolleson crop was hit at leasttwice with the microwave energies during the growing season of that barley.BECAUSE THE DISTORTED PEDUNCLE WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVEINTERACTED WITH THE ENERGIES EARLIER BEFORE THE WHEAT WENTDOWN WHILE THE PLANT WAS STILL GROWING TO MATURITY?Yes. This is a very interesting phenomenon. Magnetite In Tolleson Sampled SoilI also found a collection of magnetic particles in the Tolleson field soil. You never know ifyou're going to get magnetic particles or not. I think the reason for that is the magneticparticles are not really a part of the organized energy that produces crop formations. Theyare picked up along the way by the crop formation energies when they interact with cloudsof the meteoritic particles. The particles are very erratic. They follow meteorite showers.But they happen all the time.So, the crop formation energy can meet up with a cloud of meteoritic material. ResearcherGene Thomas has also learned that foundries can produce these magnetic particles andspew the micron-sized iron particles into the air.Gene has done some marvelous work in chasing this down and I have given him some of"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"my samples to do a magnetic drag on. Now, instead of taking soil and doing the magnetictest drag that is dirty and time-consuming, Gene would like to make a device that can goright into the field and pick up on very localized magnetic fields from the iron particles.That's a good idea and he could map out the whole area that way. He's still working ondesigning the instrument. Could Irrigation Water and Wind Have Causedthe Elongated Growth Nodes and Stunted Seed Vigor?Absolutely not. With irrigation, the plants do go down easier in the wind. But the reasonfor that is not that the plants are weaker. It's because the irrigation causes the root systemsto spread out along the surface of the soil. So, if the plants can get energy from the soilsurface, it's a conservation of energy in Nature. The plants don't bother sending a tap rootstraight down into the soil because they don't need to.They are uprooted more easily than a plant growing in a normal season that has rains andthen drought and then they have to send down a tap root to go down and get the moisturefrom lower depths.BUT THE IRRIGATION AND WINDS COLD NOT CAUSE NODE EXPULSIONS ORTHE EXPANSIONS IN THE LENGTHS OF THE GROWTH NODES?No.SO THE MEDIA SHOWED THE PUBLIC THE THREE PHOENIX FIELDS THATLOOKED AS IF THE PLANTS HAD BEEN LAID DOWN IN LINES AND THEFARMER SAID IT WAS IRRIGATION AND WIND. YOUR INVESTIGATION ISSAYING THAT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IRRIGATION AND WIND, BUT SOMEKIND OF COMPLEX ENERGY SYSTEM ALSO INTERACTED WITH THOSEFIELDS?Yes. If you looked at the lines of soil with an electrovolt meter, you'd probably find thatthe electric field around those berms were slightly different than in the flat soil. The reasonis that whenever you have a peak, or raised height, you concentrate the electric fieldenergy which is whenever you have a point or hill. That could direct the energy towardthese irrigation energies. So if there is a direction between the berms, it doesn't have to dowith the irrigation water. It has to do with the electric field configuration along the field. Why Geometric Crop Formations in Englandand Randomly Downed in United States?IF THIS SAME PLASMA VORTEX WITH COMPLEX ENERGIES IS INVOLVEDWITH CROP FORMATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, WHY IS IT THAT IN THETHREE ARIZONA FIELDS WE DID NOT FIND BEAUTIFUL GEOMETRIES?I think the reason why England has the very intricate geometric formations and the cropformations here in the United States are more scruffy and appear to be more random isbecause crop formations is that crop formations are often associated with stormy weather.The U. S. has a high degree of turbulence in its weather, from tornadoes to hurricanes.Let's say that the ion plasmas are coming down from the ionosphere toward the Earth andthey are being pinched by the magnetic pinch effect of the Earth's magnetic field. Whenthey reach the crop field, if nothing disturbs them, they can make a very intricategeometric pattern.But, if there are a lot of cross wind and all kinds of turbulence in the atmosphere, that canbreak the pattern up into all kinds of random shapes. Could Vortex Energies Be Manipulated by AdvancedIntelligences?WHAT ABOUT THE SOURCE OF THE SPINNING PLASMA VORTICES? DO YOUTHINK THERE'S ANY EVIDENCE OF AN ADVANCED INTELLIGENCE, PERHAPSEVEN USING NATURAL EARTH METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS TO MAKESPECIFIC CROP DESIGNS?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"A few years ago five or six years ago I would have said no. But, there have been thingsthat have come up more recently that I have not published and I think there might be somedirection to this. I can't say for sure, but let's say I'm weakening on my viewpoint there.THEN IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE THAT A NATURAL MECHANISM INVOLVING THEEARTH'S ION PLASMAS COULD BE MANIPULATED?Yes, it might be used by some other intelligence.\"More Information:Biophysicist W.
