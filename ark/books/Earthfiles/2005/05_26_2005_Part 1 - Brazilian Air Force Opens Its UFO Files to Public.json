This week I talked with Urandir Oliveira in Corguino. The Portuguese-to-Englishtranslation was provided by Brazilian businessman, Felipe Branco. Mr. Branco is anexecutive in his family's company, Castelo Branco Ltd. - a ranching and holding companywith offices in Rio de Janeiro, Campo Grande and Italy. Mr. Branco has taken a deepinterest in researching UFOs and close encounters with what seem to be non-human beingssince his own first experience with a tall, red-haired, green-eyed female in 1968. He was5-years-old then, living in Campo Grande. He and his family have a ranch there which isabout 60 miles (100 kilometers) southeast of Corguinho."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Sao Paulo, Brazil, has a population around 18 million. Campo Grande, in thestate of Mato Grosso Do Sul, has a population of about 850,000.Rochedo (\"Little Rock),\" the nearest town to Corguinho andUrandir Oliveira's farm, has a population of a few hundred people and isnearly two hours on rough, dirt roads from Campo Grande.In 1996, Felipe and his brother began traveling to Corguinho after they heard about thealleged UFO abductions of farmer Urandir Oliveira. Since then, Mr. Branco and his familyhave researched phenomena in the remote valley where he and many others have seenunidentified aerial craft and various types of non-human entities, and where recently hehad an encounter with what he calls a \"plasma ball\" which entered his body. More aboutthat later in this report. But first, the news from Brasilia. I asked Urandir Oliveira andFelipe Branco why the Brazilian Air Force now suddenly opened up UFO and othergovernment files to the public?Interview:Urandir Oliveira, Farmer and UFO Abductee, Corguinho, Mato Grosso Do Sul,Brazil, Translated by Felipe Branco, Castelo Branco Ltd., Campo Grande, MatoGrosso Do Sul, Brazil : \"Urandir says there is a Congressman in 2004 who started puttingpressure on the government. He said it is also policy from the Lulu government to open allits files not only UFOs, but also concerning the political prisoners in the early 1960s. Allsecret files, they want to open everything to the public like a general effort of disclosure ofall secret documents concerning all different fields not only UFOs. Also politicalpersecutions.SO WAS THIS INITIATED BY THE PRESIDENT OF BRAZIL?He is saying the Congressman last year started the pressure to specifically open Brazil's AirForce UFO files. Then he utilized the good will of Lulu's government to open all files andthen the Air Force proceeded to open its files on UFOs, apparently. As far as I understood,it only initiated with this Congressman Joae Caldas, who represents the State of Sao Pauloand the Liberal Front Party.IS THERE ANYTHING THAT HAS COME OUT THAT IS SURPRISING TOANYBODY?On Sunday, a couple of days ago, there is this TV program called Fantastico! and theyshowed this meeting in Brasilia with the Air Force headquarters. It was an interview withthe Brazil Air Force Commander and a couple of Air Marshals.
