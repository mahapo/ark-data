The red colors are produced by anthocyanin molecules.Research shows red maple anthocyanin can destroy other plant seeds. October 10, 2005 Hamilton, New York - Colgate University biology professor, FrankFrey, and graduate student, Maggie Eldridge, report new research about trees that producered leaves, such as maples and oaks, that might be trying to destroy all other tree seeds inthe area. \"Foliage changes color in autumn when chlorophyll in leaf cells (green color) breaks downand exposes the pigments that remain, such as carotenoid pigments which appear yellow ororange. But the story is different for maples and a handful of other trees whose leaves turnscarlet. The anthocyanin pigments in maple foliage are actually manufactured by the trees- rather than simply revealed - at a time of year when the organisms can't afford to use upa lot of metabolic energy for such a complex process.\" Prof. Frey and Eldridge decided to study why. Their investigation was focused on redmaple and yellow beech leaves. The team produced extracts from green maple leaves, redmaple leaves, green beech leaves and yellow beech leaves. The scientists poured each leafextract over lettuce seeds and measured the effect on germination and growth. Frey and Eldridge found that \"seeds treated with the red maple extract had dramaticallyreduced germination and growth compared to all other treatments. When scarlet-tintedautumn leaves are dropped in the fall, it appears that anthocyanins leach from the leavesinto the soil and protect seedlings and saplings from interspecific competition the followingspring. This seems a viable possibility, since the molecular structure of anthocyanin isnearly identical to catechin, a well-described toxin that causes root cells to self-destruct.\" Could Anthocyanins Inhibit Cancer Cell Growth? Prof. Frey thinks the implication from the red leaf investigation \"suggests thatanthocyanins might inhibit the growth of some vertebrate cancer cells.\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
