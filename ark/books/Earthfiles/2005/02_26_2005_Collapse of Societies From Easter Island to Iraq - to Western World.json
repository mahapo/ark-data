D. Approximatelyhalf of the total of 887 statues documented to date still remain in the immediate vicinity of Rano Raraku,the quarry in which they were produced. The statues were transported and erected with the leveragehelp of the island's once abundant tall palm trees which were eventuallyall cut down.

Easter Island is triangular-shaped and was created entirely from three volcaniceruptions over the past few million years. The entire island is only 9 miles long northto south, 1,670 feet high and covers only 66 square miles. February 26, 2005 Los Angeles, California - Among earth mysteries, some of thegreatest are the haunting remains of past civilizations such as the Mayan pyramids ofMexico and Central America; the elaborate, deserted temples of Angkor Wat inCambodia; and the huge and heavy stone statues on remote Easter Island, 2300 miles westof Chile' in South America. The island and its strange statues were not discovered untilEaster Day on April 5, 1722 by a Dutch explorer named Jacob Roggeveen. Like allsubsequent visitors, Roggeveen was puzzled about how the natives there had erected thelarge lava rock statues, one as tall as 39 feet. And why?Today after years of study by archaeologists, anthropologists, historians and geographerssuch as Jared Diamond, Professor of Geography at UCLA in Los Angeles, it appears thatEaster Islanders destroyed themselves by cutting down all the many trees that originallygrew on the island. Perhaps the natives appealed to the gods through the stone statues torestore the very land and food supply they were destroying in their unconscious ignorance."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Pulitzer Prize-winning author and professor, Dr. Jared Diamond, was so stunned by whathe learned about Easter Island that he focused an entire large chapter on the island'sdeterioration and extinctions in his latest book: Collapse, How Societies Choose to Fail orSucceed. (The 575-page book also examines many other failed human cultures, past andpresent.)Treeless Easter Island once was covered with tall palm forests, woody bushes and 25 nesting seabird species.But after all the trees were cut down to transport and erect the stone statues,the society collapsed. Photograph © Martin Gray.Dr. Diamond writes: \"No other site that I have visited made such a ghostly impression onme as Rano Raraku, the rock quarry on Easter Island where its famous gigantic stonestatues were carved. To begin with, the island is the most remote habitable scrap of land inthe world. The nearest lands are the coast of Chile 2,300 miles to the east and Polynesia'sPitcairn Islands 1,300 miles to the west.\"Today, Easter Island is governed by Chile in South America. But modern DNA analysis of12 skeletons found on Easter Island proved the Easter Island natives were Polynesian. Dr.Diamond concludes that Easter Island is \"the closest approximation that we have to anecological disaster unfolding in complete isolation.\"Easter Island is a triangular-shaped island made entirely from three volcanic eruptions overthe past few million years. The entire island is only 9 miles long north to south, is 1,670feet high and covers only 66 square miles. Even the surrounding Pacific Ocean is too coldin temperature to sustain many fish species. There isn't much fresh water and the windblows so steadily that the soil dries out. The only way to farm is to add rocks to dirt toretain moisture.Yet, around 900 A.D., some people from Polynesia islands arrived by boat and found asubtropical forest of tall palm trees, woody bushes and at least 25 nesting seabird specieswhich once made the island the \"richest breeding site in all of Polynesia and probably inthe whole Pacific.\" Eventually, as many as 20,000 to 30,000 people might have lived onEaster Island.But only a few centuries later around 1500, there were no more birds, no more trees, andthe natives were eating each other in cannibalism amid the tall stone statues produced bycompeting Easter Island political powers who wanted the biggest and best tributes to theancestors and gods. One of the unfinished statues in the Rano Raraku quarry was 66 feettall and weighed an estimated 300 tons."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Over time, the statues became more elaborate with large,mysterious head dresses. Photograph © Cliff Wassman.The very sad irony is that the carving of the stone statues in the volcanic quarries requiredlong wooden tree trunks to lift and transport the statues. The tall palms were the answer.Over time, like uncontrollable dominoes falling, when all the trees that had providedshade, protection and holding the fragile, dry soil together were all cut down - the birdsdisappeared along with the other few animals that could be eaten and the rock gardensfailed. The islanders had no wood left to build boats that could sail to other lands forescape. After smallpox came ashore with visitors in the late 1700s to 1800s, the diseasekilled so many natives that by 1872, there were only 111 Easter islanders left. It was thecomplete collapse of a once-thriving society. Could Easter Island-like Collapse Happen to U. S. andEurope?The arrogance of political leaders, who competed by building the statues, accelerated theextinction of the trees and the collapse. Could the same collapse and extinctions happen inthe United States and Europe?Prof. Diamond says there is a 50/50 chance the answer is yes. Already around the world,several countries such as Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti, Afghanistan and Iraq have alreadycollapsed. America and Europe have the huge challenge of propping up governments in aneffort to provide more political and economic stability in the world. Iraq alone has so farcost the United States taxpayers $280 billion, plus more than a thousand military lives.Prof. Diamond told me this week, \"If six more countries blow up, that requires double thenumber of troops that we've got. Six more countries blowing up the world can't cope withit.\"Interview:Jared Diamond, Ph.D., Prof. of Geography, University of California - Los Angeles(UCLA): \"\"In the past, societies that had not many people and with rather simpletechnology still managed to destroy their environments. For example, Easter Island withmaybe 20,000 people with just stone and wooden tools they did manage to deforest theisland and so doing, they destroyed their society. It took them 850 years to do it. Today,though, (on the Earth), we don't have 20,000 people. We have 6.5 billion and we havebulldozers and nuclear power, so we're far more people and far more potent anddestructive technology. We can destroy our environment much faster than the EasterIslanders. In fact, there are many parts of the world that have gotten de-forested withinhalf a dozen years, or within a few decades. That's what makes our present situationserious.I THINK I WAS STRUCK AT THE END OF YOUR BOOK WITH FEELING FOR THEFIRST TIME THAT EVEN IF THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE ARE STRONGAND VIGOROUS IN TERMS OF SOCIETY AND ECONOMICS RIGHT NOW, THATALL OF THE PROBLEMS WE ARE IN ONE SENSE CAUSING WITH POLLUTION.YOU MADE THE POINT OF THE INUIT NATIVES OF THE ARCTIC HAVING THEHIGHEST BLOOD LEVELS OF TOXIC CHEMICALS SUCH AS MERCURY COMINGFROM OUR INDUSTRY THE REST OF THE WORLD COULD START COLLAPSING"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"AND LIKE DOMINOES, IT WOULD LEAVE THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPEBEING PULLED DOWN.That's a very serious concern. It has already been happening. Somalia already collapsed in1991 and American troops went in there. It did not pull us down, but it did involve militaryintervention. Or what has happened in Afghanistan and Iraq, which are virtually collapsedgovernments particularly in the case of Afghanistan. Those are two countries that blew upand the result has been 200,000 American troops and $280 billion. That has not caused oureconomy to collapse yet, but it's an enormous drain on our economy. So, the United Statesand Europe we can't insulate ourselves. Another expression is that both the United Statesand Europe are getting lots of immigrants from collapsing countries, both legal and illegal.WHEN YOU COMBINE WHAT YOU'VE JUST SAID WITH WHAT HAS HAPPENEDTO US IN OUR COMMITMENTS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, YOU COULDARGUE ON ONE SIDE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO PREVENTFUTURE COLLAPSES BY SHORING UP THOSE COUNTRIES BY GETTING RID OFTERRORISTS. BUT THE ARGUMENT COULD ALSO BE MADE THAT WE MIGHTBE GETTING INTO A TAR PIT IN WHICH THE MONEY AND COMMITMENT ISGOING TO WEAKEN US SO MUCH ECONOMICALLY AT A TIME WHEN THEREST OF THE WORLD COULD ALSO BEGIN TO COLLAPSE FASTER THAN WEHAD EXPECTED. THAT GETS TO THE QUESTION: WHAT IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE- LOOKING INTO THE NEAR FUTURE, SAY 10 OR 15 YEARS - ABOUT WHETHEROR NOT THERE IS A REAL POTENTIAL THAT THE UNITED STATES COULDBEGIN TO COLLAPSE ECONOMICALLY?Of course, there is a real potential and lots of people in our government, manycongressmen and senators as well as a large fraction of the American population, is veryconcerned about the U. S.'s future both our power and our economy. The interventions inIraq and Afghanistan one can describe it as 'short term' attempts to solve the problem.They are not attempts to prevent a problem, but problems arose and they were met withshort term response. But there are literally dozens of countries out there with the potentialto become the next Iraq, Afghanistan and Somalia. It's perfectly obvious that the U. S. isnot rich enough to invest $280 billion into each of about 25 countries, countries justwaiting to blow up: Nepal, where there was a coup from the top within the last week;Haiti; Philippines; Indonesia; Solomon Islands; Rwanda; Burundi. So, the United States isgoing to have to get involved in long term problem solving that is, addressing theunderlying problems of environment, public health and population planning that causecountries to blow up. Climate Change Threatens the WorldAs Did Cutting Down Trees On Easter IslandYET, THE UNITED STATES HAS NOT JOINED IN EVEN THE KYOTO PROTOCOLTO TRY TO REDUCE CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS OF WHICH OUR COUNTRYIS THE GREATEST EMITTER.That's true. We are one of the two countries (in First World), along with Australia, that hasnot signed the Kyoto Protocol. But there again, it's helpful to remind ourselves that ourfederal government is not monolithic. Our president is opposed to signing the KyotoProtocol. But there are many Americans who are deadly serious about the importance ofdealing with climate change. For example, my wife and kids and I spend part of oursummers in Montana. In the state of Montana which gets water for agriculture fromirrigation the irrigation comes from the snow pack thanks to global warming and climatechange, the snow pack is melting. Glacier National Park is losing its glaciers and Montanaagriculture, in short order, is going to be in deep trouble because of climate change.RIGHT NOW, THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A LOT OF MOMENTUM MOVINGFORWARD AT LEAST IN THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION ABOUT TRYING TOSOLVE SOME MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS IN WHICH CO2 BUILD UPON THE PLANET WOULD BE NEAR THE TOP IN TERMS OF CAUSING GLOBALWARMING AND ALL OF THE CONSEQUENTIAL ISSUES OF CHANGINGCLIMATE, PERHAPS MORE VIOLENTLY SWINGING EXTREMES OF CLIMATE,THAT WILL CAUSE GREATER DAMAGE AND MEANS MORE AND MOREMONEY GOING INTO RECONSTRUCTION, ALL OF IT LIKE DOMINOES FALLING.All of what you say is what could make people pessimistic. And fortunately, there is moreto it than that. Elections are held every four years in the United States. We've gotCongressional elections coming up in a little less than 2 years. We've got all the state andlocal governments. The President's own party is not monolithically in agreement with hispolicies. So, the current policies preferred by the current leadership of the United States"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"they may not go on forever. I hope they don't.WHY DO YOU THINK THAT GLOBAL WARMING AND ALL OF THE POTENTIALCONSEQUENCES DOES NOT RISE GLOBALLY ABOVE POLITICS AND BECOMEA WORLD PRIORITY TO SOLVE BECAUSE IT WILL AFFECT EVERYONE?It's a problem of what is called 'creeping normalcy.' It's not something that exploded likethe Pinatubo Volcano in the Philippines, nor like September 11, 2001.[Editor's Note: In June 1991, Pinatubo Volcano in the Philippines erupted so violently thatmore than 5 billion cubic meters of ash and pyroclastic debris were ejected. Eruptioncolumns were 18 kilometers wide at the volcano's base and ash rose 30 kilometers into thesky.Mount Pinatubo had been dormant for 500 years. Then on July 16, 1990,a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck about 60 miles (100 kms.) northeast of Mount Pinatuboon the island of Luzon in the Philippines. A year later on June 15, 1991, the volcano explodedin a massive eruption that ejected more than 5 cubic kilometers of volcanic material.The ash cloud rose 22 miles (35 kilometers) into the air.847 people died, 184 were injured, 23 were missing, and more than one million peoplewere homeless. Hundreds of millions of dollars in private properties and infrastructure layin ruins which would require tens of billions of pesos and several years to rebuild. Formonths, the ejected volcanic ash circled the Earth and caused the world's temperature tofall by an average of 1 degree Celsius.]Prof. Diamond: \"Instead, the temperatures get a little warmer and then a little colder andthen warmer and then colder. It's been gradually creeping along and there hasn't been amoment in which someone said, 'My God, it's 10 degrees warmer this year. We've got tostart doing something.'That's the reason why it has taken 30 years for essentially every knowledgeableclimatologists to agree that global warming is a serious problem and that people are thecause of it. It's also why it's taken 30 years to get all, except the last two governments, toagree about its importance.BUT ISN'T GLOBAL WARMING, IN A WAY, THE SAME COMPARABLE KIND OFTHREAT TO SURVIVAL THAT THE CUTTING DOWN OF ALL THE TREES ONEASTER ISLAND ENDED UP BEING TO THE PEOPLE ON THAT ISLANDBECAUSE THAT ONE ACTION SET IN MOTION ALL THE OTHERCONSEQUENCES THAT ENDED UP IN THE TOTAL COLLAPSE OF EASTERISLAND?That's true. It's actually worse than that. You and I are flipping back and forth betweencauses for pessimism and optimism. A cause for pessimism is that global warming, ifunchecked, will be a mess for us. But it's not the only problem because even if we solvedglobal warming, but we did not solve the world's problems of water or of top soil or fish there are about a dozen problems, any one of which could drag us down. 50/50 Chance of Collapse for Whole World?I HAD THIS SENSE UPON COMPLETING YOUR BOOK THAT THE PROBLEMSFACING THE ENTIRE GLOBE RIGHT NOW ARE SO HUGE AND SO MANY THATIT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE IS A 50/50 CHANCE THAT THEY WON'T BESOLVE D."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"I would say you are roughly correct. One could argue whether the chance is 20/80 or80/20 or 50/50. But that's why I've used the metaphor of an exponentially acceleratinghorse race of unknown outcome. Yes, the damage is getting faster and faster. Also, theenvironmental movement is getting stronger and stronger. I can't predict which of thosetwo horses are going to win the race. Maybe the odds are 50/50. That would be anotherway of putting numbers on by saying we've got serious problems that will ruin us if wedon't solve them. But we could solve them if we chose to do so.WHAT DO YOU THINK IN THIS AGE OF TELEVISION AND RADIO AS YOU MAKETHE EXCELLENT POINT THAT WE ARE GETTING NEWS FROM EVERY SPOT ONTHE WORLD AND 24 NEWS CYCLES WHICH HELPS AT LEAST MAKE USAWARE. BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD BE THE FIRST SIGNS TO YOU THATCOLLAPSE WAS REALLY ONGOING AND IRRETRIEVABLE?Irretrievable it's going to be hard to judge when it's irretrievable. It's certainly notirretrievable at the moment. Ongoing collapse is already ongoing. Think of the countriesthat have already collapsed some of them rather close to the United States: the stategovernment in Haiti, which is within a couple of hundred miles of our shores. The stategovernment there is close to collapse. In Africa, the government collapsed in Rwanda; thegovernment has already collapsed in the Solomon Islands which has been propped up byNew Zealand and Australia troops.So, when you ask what would it take to convince me that collapse is ongoing it is alreadyongoing.IF IT'S ONGOING IN THOSE NATIONS THAT WE THINK OF AS IMPOVERISHEDAND POLITICALLY NOT DRIVING THE POLITICS OF THE WORLD, WHATWOULD IT TAKE TO START BRINGING DOWN EUROPE AND THE UNITEDSTATES?Oh, about five more countries exploding, requiring another $280 billion each. Theestimated cost of Iraq so far is $280 billion. Suppose Nepal, the Philippine Islands, Haiti very close to our shores, Rwanda, and Bangladesh all exploded that's 5 times $280 billion.That's $1.4 trillion. That would be more than the United States could stand.IF WE CAN'T PROP UP THE NATIONS YOU HAVE JUST LISTED AND WE CAN'TPROP UP OTHER COUNTRIES THAT MIGHT BE AFFECTED BY THE COLLAPSEAS IT KEPT EXPANDING, THAT WE REACH A POINT WHERE WE DON'T HAVEANY PLACE TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS?That's one we'll have other First World countries to sell our products to, but those FirstWorld countries as well as the United States economies are linked now. I would say that aplace to sell our products is just one of our problems. It's not the biggest of our problems.Other big problems include: military action, terrorists, getting cut off from essential importssuch as oil and metals. I would worry about those before I would worry about loss ofmarkets. Economists Are Worried About CollapseHAVE YOU TALKED OFF THE RECORD WITH SOMEBODY WHO IS DEALING ATTHE GLOBAL ECONOMIC LEVEL. I'M THINKING OF PAUL VOELKER. [Chairmanof the U. S. Federal Reserve during the Jimmy Carter Administration, 1976-1980.) HERECENTLY WROTE AN ARTICLE HAVING TO DO WITH HIS FEAR THAT THEDOLLAR COULD START GOING INTO A FREE FALL COLLAPSE WITHIN FIVEYEARS OF 2005, WHICH WOULD BE BY 2010. IT HAS TO DO WITH A SHIFT INGLOBAL ECONOMIES TO THE EURO AND OTHER CURRENCIES AND ISSUESAROUND PETROLEUM. HAVE YOU TALKED WITH ANYONE ABOUT THAT?Yes. I have not talked with Paul Voelker, but with other economists. I have had discussionswith the famous economist, Jeffrey Sachs, at Columbia University. His point of view isvery similar to mine. He regards as the biggest economic problem in the world today thenexus between public health problems and environmental problems and populationproblems. He has been going around the world advising countries about how to improvetheir economies, but also talking to First World countries about the importance of solvingthese problems.Another person I've talked to is a (Bush Administration) cabinet minister who I cannotname, but a cabinet minister of the current administration. This cabinet minister has a pointof view that is very different from that of our president. This cabinet minister read mybook, Guns, Germs and Steel and read my book, Collapse, and is convinced of the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"seriousness of these problems.POTENTIALLY WE COULD BE FACING A TOTAL COLLAPSE OF WORLDECONOMIES?That's the worst case scenario. The best case scenario is that potentially we could be facinggetting a grip on our problems and solving them in a way that the United States has madebig progress in dealing with our problems of air and water pollution, within the last 30years. Air and water quality are much better now, even though we've got far more peopleand far more cars. That's something that gives one optimism.COULD THE ULTIMATE TRIGGER POINT FOR GLOBAL COLLAPSE OF JUSTABOUT EVERYTHING BE OUR UNDERESTIMATING THE IMPACT THAT GLOBALWARMING AND CHANGING CLIMATE IS GOING TO HAVE ON EVERYTHINGFROM FOOD PRODUCTION TO SHORELINES?That's one of the many possible trigger points. I think there are other trigger points that willcome earlier than global warming, such as the collapses of half a dozen more countries. Orsuch as water wars, or such as the depletion of the world's remaining significant fisherieson which most people in the Third World depend for their protein. Can Other Collapsing Nations Drag U.S.and Europe Down With Them?WHAT COULD THE FIRST WORLD DO IF THERE WERE HALF A DOZEN MORETHIRD WORLD COUNTRY BLOW UPS?Not very much. We couldn't afford the money. We don't have the troops. The Americanarmy is not big enough. I think we've committed about one-third of our troops to Iraq andtherefore, if six more countries blow up, that requires double the number of troops thatwe've got. Six more countries blowing up the world can't cope with it.AND WHAT HAPPENS?What happens, it's a big mess! More than what we've got now. More immigrants. If sixcountries collapse, instead of one or two, we've got far more immigrants swamping ourability to deal with them. Bigger epidemics of emerging diseases and bigger economicproblems. The worst case scenario is that it would be a collapse similar to the collapse ofthe Western Roman Empire, or similar to the collapse of Easter Island, or similar to thecollapse of Haiti. A worse case scenario is that all the world gets to be like Haiti andSomalia. Somalia ripples out until much of Africa and Asia and then Europe is in acondition like Somalia. That's the worst case scenario.But whenever one says something pessimistic about that, let's reverse and say: it could goeither way. It could be that the rest of the world is going to end up like Scandinavia or TheNetherlands or Bhutan or Australia getting a grip on their environmental problems.ARE YOU OPTIMISTIC OR PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THIS COUNTRY'S FUTURE?The phrase I use is 'cautiously optimistic.' By that, I mean on the one hand, we do haveserious problems. And if the serious problems went on as they are going now, then we aregoing to be in deep trouble within the next several decades.On the other hand, the problems are all ones we are causing and we are perfectly capableof solving them. We don't need new technology. We could solve them if we chose to solvethem. That's what makes me cautiously optimistic neither pessimistic nor straight outoptimistic, but I would say, cautiously optimistic. We could solve our problems if we choseto do so. Whether we will, I can't predict.\"Prof. Diamond's last words in his book are:\" My remaining cause for hope is another consequence of the globalized modernworld's interconnectedness. Past societies lacked archaeologists and television.While the Easter Islanders were busy deforesting the highlands of theiroverpopulated island for agricultural plantations in the 1400s, they had no way ofknowing that thousands of miles to the east and west at the same time, GreenlandNorse society and the Khmer Empire were simultaneously in terminal decline,while the Anasazi had collapsed a few centuries earlier, Classic Maya society afew more centuries before that, and Mycenean Greece 2,000 years before that.Today, though, we turn on our television sets or radios or pick up our newspapers,and we see, hear, or read about what happened in Somalia or Afghanistan a few"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"hours earlier. Our television documentaries and books show us in graphic detailwhy the Easter Islanders, Classic Maya, and other past societies collapsed. Thus,we have the opportunity to learn from the mistakes of distant peoples and pastpeoples. That's an opportunity that no past society enjoyed to such a degree. Myhope in writing this book has been that enough people will choose to profit fromthat opportunity to make a difference.\"Click on cover to amazon.com.Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed © Jared Diamond, 2005,published by Viking Penguin Group (USA), Inc.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
