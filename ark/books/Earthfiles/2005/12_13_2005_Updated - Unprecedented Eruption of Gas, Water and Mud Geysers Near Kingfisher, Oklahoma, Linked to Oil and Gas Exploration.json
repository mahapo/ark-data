It's shooting anywhere from 7 to 10 feet in the air - water, mud and gasfumes. I've never seen anything like it. The Corporation Commission of Oklahomahas never seen anything like it.\" - John Crawford, Kingfisher, Oklahoma Fire Chief Kingfisher, population 4,500, and Okarche, population 2,000, are linked by the Winter Camp Creek(originally known as Dead Indian Creek). Between December 9 to 13, 2005, the gas and watereruptions had grownalong 12 miles of the creek and tributaries to within 1 mile of Kingfisher and about 7 miles fromOkarche. December 15, 2005 Update - Today, more methane gas bubbling has spread south towardOkarche. Yesterday, four more gas eruptions in a wheat field were discovered about twomiles from the city limits of Kingfisher, Oklahoma. The unprecedented - and so far,uncontrolled - eruptions of methane, water and mud on a 12-mile-long stretch of WinterCamp Creek and surrounding fields continues to frustrate authorities. Chesapeake EnergyCorp., an independent oil and gas exploration company, was drilling on December 9, abouteight miles from where the first gas and mud eruptions were reported in Section 2 ofKingfisher County. Today, Chesapeake said it would start flaring off some of the escapinggas and try to capture and sell more of it. What no one knows is whether this will reducethe underground pressure of the gas enough to slow down, or stop, the continuing gaseruptions that have occurred since the morning of December 9. Geologists are trying tofigure out what has happened and what can be done to control the potentially explosivesituation.December 13, 2005 Kingfisher, Oklahoma - The first to report the eruptions were acouple of hunters who noticed the gas, water and mud coming out of the ground in theSection 2 region of Kingfisher County early Friday morning, December 9. Each section isabout a square mile. The hunters called the game warden, who called the KingfisherCounty Sheriff's Department, who called the Kingfisher Fire Department. Fire chief, JohnCrawford, and his crew arrived at the scene of the first eruptions at 9 a.m. on Friday,December 9.Interview: John Crawford, Fire Chief, Kingfisher Fire Department, Kingfisher, Oklahoma: \"Itbasically looked like a big mud hole with water and mud and gas coming out of the ground.

We'vegot one point out southwest in the county there's an area there. And then there is nothingfor about 7 miles to the northwest. And then it starts showing up again in a creek bed wehave and continued down along the creek bed and along the sides of the banks. We've gotone spot out in the middle of a wheat field - it kind of looks like a geyser. It's shootinganywhere from 7 to 10 feet in the air - water, mud and gas fumes. I've never seen anythinglike it. The Corporation Commission of Oklahoma has never seen anything like it.Natural gas spews ground water 7 to 10 feet into the air from a farmer's wheat field southwestof Kingfisher on Monday, December 12, 2005.

That was our first thought eitherpipelines or oil wells that were either capped or alive, creating this problem. Or even thepossibility of a small earthquake tremor where the plates shifted enough for the gas toescape and find its weakest routes to the surface.HAVE YOU TALKED WITH USGS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF ANEARTHQUAKE?Yes, I think, I believe the Corporation Commission has dug into that information and frommy understanding, there hasn't been any sign of a tremor.FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE AS A FIRE CHIEF, DO YOU HAVE ANY PERSONALTHOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT COULD BE HAPPENING?The only thing I can think of is that something has caused pressure underneath the earth'ssurface that has created some kind of a fracture, like in a shell bed underneath the earththat caused some cracks or something and let the gas escape through it and find theweakest spots."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I've never seen anything like it. The Corporation Commission of Oklahoma has never seenanything like it. All the experts, engineers, in the field have never seen anything like it.Geologists are digging and trying to find maps for the information under the earth crust tosee if they can pinpoint what the situation is.HOW MUCH NATURAL GAS IS COMING UP IN THE AREA?There's no way of measuring it. I would have to say that the best description is hugeamounts of gas. I mean, we've got gas pockets coming up out of the middle of a creek. Thecreek looks kind of like a Jacuzzi. Just big boils all up and down the creek and on the sidesof the banks, in the middle of the wheat field. There is no way of measuring it, but I wouldhave to say that a tremendous amount of gas is expelling from the earth right now. Gas Concentrations in \"Explosive Range\"We've had to shut our cell phones and pagers off because of the explosive limits of themethane and gas coming up out of the ground.SO IT'S REALLY DANGEROUS FOR ALL OF YOU TO BE OUT THERE WHENTHERE'S THIS MUCH METHANE COMING FROM THE GROUND?They are at explosive limits. The explosive limit is level 10 and sometimes you might readthe level at 2 or 3; it could be 12 or 14. We've had it as high as 37.WHERE WAS THAT LEVEL 37?Section 2.THAT WAS ON FRIDAY?No, that reading was yesterday. Section 2's scene has been going on ever since Fridaymorning.IF IT WENT UP TO 37, DOESN'T THAT MEAN THAT MORE GAS IS COMING OUTOF SECTION 2 THAN IT WAS ON FRIDAY?Yes, but you have to think of moisture content, you have to think of humidity. Like lastnight when it was tested, it was very calm weather, no wind. Today, we've got probably 30mph winds out of the south, so you're not going to get those kind of readings. It kind ofdepends on the weather and situation. Down along the creek bottom, I would expect to getaround 12 to 14, but you move up off the bank twelve to fifteen foot, it might go down to2 or 3, or sometimes even zero.WHAT IS THE RANGE ON THE EXPLOSIVE GAS RANGE?From what I understand, 0 to 10 is flammable and anything above 10 is explosive.SO THIS SECTION 2 HAS BEEN SO EXPLOSIVE THAT IT'S BEEN MEASURED AT37 ON THE EXPLOSIVE RANGE?I believe it was 37. Our Kingfisher Emergency Management Director, Steve Loftis, he wasout there with people that were reading it, and I think he told me 37 last night (Monday,December 12). Gas Geysers Opened Up A Mile FromKingfisher and Toward OkarcheIS THAT PRESENTING ANY DANGER TO THE PUBLIC?Yes, it can. I'm more concerned about the populated area. There are a lot more ignitionsources in the populated area. I think it spread about 3 miles from the first place in Section2 toward Kingfisher within a 20 to 24 hour time frame. It has progressed to about a 1.5miles west and south of Kingfisher. But probably for the last 36 to 48 hours, that hasstopped. We're thinking it might have found a heavy shale bed and the gas can't escape it,because it was headed right toward Kingfisher.So we called in the 63rd Civil Support Team to help assist us in monitoring the lower andhigher explosive limits to find out what kind of danger we were in. There are explosivelimits along the creek. There is no doubt about it. It also dissipates in the air, so for it to"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"explode, everything you've got moisture content in gas coming up out of the ground,you've got humidity to deal with and wind to deal with. It's unlikely it would burn, butwhen you get into the city limits of Kingfisher, you find all kinds of ignition sources and soI've had some real serious concerns.Yesterday afternoon (Monday, Dec. 12) at about 4 p.m., we noticed another little feedercreek bubbling that was not bubbling the previous days. But now, it's another weak spotand it's going back south toward the town of Okarche. Now, it's got about 7 or 8 miles oftravel to reach the town of Okarche. After it went south, it's been stable for about 12 to 14hours, since Monday night.IF THIS GAS BUBBLING BROKE OUT AGAIN AND STARTS SPREADING, IT HASABOUT A MILE LEFT TO GO TO GET TO THE KINGFISHER CITY LIMITS?Yes, probably 2 miles the way the creek flows.RIGHT NOW, WHAT DO YOU AND AUTHORITIES THINK IS THE PROBABILITYTHAT MIGHT HAPPEN?This situation has really been unpredictable. I feel very comfortable right now that it hasstabilized and is not going toward the Kingfisher area. But you know, the thing is this gas,if it's moving along and can't find its way through the shelf of the shale but it does a mile ortwo down the road, which could be closer to Kingfisher, it could start bubbling up,depending on how long that shale bed is. Does it run all the way through Kingfisher? Doesit quit right there at the edge of Kingfisher? We don't know. Unpredictable Spread of Gas BubblingAlong Winter Camp CreekIt follows Winter Camp Creek, where it starts at, we've got a gas problem there also. Thenit's in an area of 15 to 20 acres. Then we don't have anything along the creek bed until itreaches 5 miles west and 3 miles south of Kingfisher. And then it's just following the creekbed for 3 miles off and on. It's not solid all the way through the creek. In some places, it'snot bubbling at all. Then maybe you'll have a place that's bubbling for a quarter of a mile.BUT OVERALL, FROM INDIAN HEAD CREEK TO KINGFISHER AND OKARCHE.WOULD THAT LENGTH BE ABOUT 12 MILES?Yes, 11.71 miles.TWELVE MILES AND YOU'RE STILL IN A DYNAMIC SITUATION ON DECEMBER13 THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO BREAKSOUTH OR WHAT?That's correct. In the last 12 to 14 hours, it has not gone south or toward Kingfisher, eitherone. But it's so unpredictable, you don't know when it's going to happen or IF it willhappen? It might be like this until the source is taken care of.THERE MIGHT NOT BE A WAY TO CONTROL WHATEVER HAS BROKEN OUT INTHESE CREEK AREAS?Yes, that's right. We don't know if it's going to last another 24 hours. Or if it's going to last6 months. I don't expect it to last 6 months, but we don't have any idea how long it's goingto last before it goes away.\"Website:http://enidnews.comCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
