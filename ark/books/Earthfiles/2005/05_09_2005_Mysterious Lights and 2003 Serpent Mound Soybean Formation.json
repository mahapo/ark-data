May 9, 2005 Batvia, Ohio - Two years ago, between August and November 2003, fourcrop formations in soybeans were reported in the mysterious and ancient mound-builder'sregion of southern Ohio. Most important in terms of plant and soil anomalies was the firstone discovered on the morning of August 24, 2003, not far from the famous Serpent"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Mound near Locust Grove, Ohio. The tall soybean plants had been laid down in ageometry based around the Vesica Pisces symbol found so often in British crop formations.Its longest length was 271 feet and there were no tracks around the entire perimeter orinside the extraordinary pattern.Jeff Wilson, Director of the Independent Crop Circle Researchers Association based inCincinnati, Ohio, said that soybean crop formations are very rare in the United States andof the 100 American crop formations he had personally investigated by August 2003, \"theSerpent Mound pattern is one of the most sophisticated geometries that we've seen.\" Allthe electronic testing Jeff and his colleagues did and studies of plant samples have shownstatistically significant anomalies.Further, Jeff pointed out that soybeans are \"a tough crop to make your way through. It's avine-like plant, so when you wade through the stuff, you almost have to rip your waythrough the plants.\"What none of us knew in 2003 was there were at least three eyewitnesses the night before(August 23, 2005) at 9 p.m. who watched mysterious lights move for several minutes rightover the land near the Serpent Mound. For the first time on the record, Tree Pruitt ofBatavia, Ohio, explained what she and her husband and brother-in-law saw during abirthday celebration at her sister's home only about 20 minutes by car from the SerpentMound.Interview: (Drawings to be added in update)Tree Pruitt, Freelance Artist, Batavia, Ohio: \"The lights were yellow around theoutside, blue-white, and then the very center had a tiny white core, a very bright whitecore. They were far too high in the sky to have been headlights from a car. We were on topof the hill, so it was unlikely we were seeing a car coming toward us on the road. Inaddition to that, the lights were moving in circular patterns and we both agreed that itreminded us of writing in the air with a sparkler on the 4th of July. The lights left tracesbehind as they moved and they moved back and forth as if you were slowly dangling themfrom a string, almost a swaying motion. Sometimes they would move back and forth andthen one would move in a circular formation and they would dance around each other. Webelieve there might have been up to eight individual lights. We are not positive there werethat many, but there were definitely at least three to five. The spheres of light were aboutthe size of a basketball from our frame of reference.SO THESE LIGHTS APPEARED TO BE RELATIVELY LARGE AND COULD YOUGO OVER THE DETAILS OF THE COLOR AGAIN AND THAT SPARKLER LOOK?The size of the lights being about a 20-minute drive away from us, from where we werestanding looking at them, they were about the size of a basketball from our frame ofreference. So wherever they actually were, we figured they would have to be pretty largeto be that easily visible.As far as the coloration, you could distinctly see it was almost as if there were three circlesoverlapping each other, one within the other, evenly. The very center core was veryvibrant, clear white. Then there was a rim around that of an almost electric blue, as if theway light shines blue. Then the final rim was yellow, the yellow of a light as if when youare using a cheap light bulb and it casts a yellow glow to the room. So, it was almostamberish in tone.Some would move back and forth and others would move in circular patterns and theywove around each other. It was almost like watching a dance. It was very gracefulmovements. Then on a few occasions, there were sharp right angular movements. But themajority of the movements were very graceful, very flowing, back and forth and aroundmovements.HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU WATCHED?Judging how long it took us to smoke cigarettes, unfortunately, it might have gone onanywhere between 5 to 12 minutes.We called the rest of the family to come outside and take a look. I asked my brother-in-lawif he ever recalled seeing anything like that before. He is a total skeptic when it comes tolights, aliens, anything like that. But they do sit outside often at night and watch the stars.He said he had never seen anything like that before. It came to an end while everyone elsein the house was coming out to take a look at it. The lights just seemed to move away anddisappear.All of us agreed that the lights seemed to be coming from the direction of the SerpentMound area, which from my sister's house would have been off to the right in our field of"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"vision. We actually joked at the time, 'Maybe there will be a crop circle there in themorning.'Well, we were really surprised the next day when we saw the newspaper and there hadindeed been a crop circle.\" Plant and Soil Anomalies in 2003Serpent Mound Soybean FormationIn the downed soybeans of that unusual 2003 Serpent Mound crop formation, researchersfound a layer of heat damage at the base of the leaf stems. The implication was that somekind of energy interacted with the soybean plants and heated up those cells.

Photograph © 2003 by Jeffrey Wilson and Charles Lietzau.What typically happens in the field crops is that the vessels that carry the moisture throughthe plants those heat up and it creates a pressure that explodes out of the growth nodes ofthe plants. But in this case, the layer of parenchyma cells is much thicker in soybeans andacts as a kind of cushion and doesn't actually reach the vessels that would carry thatmoisture. So, it's only that layer of damage that we see in these plants, again suggestingheating."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Brown, damaged areas were mixed among the still-growingsoybean plants laid down clockwise in the large outer ring of the formation.Photograph © 2003 by Jeffrey Wilson.Biophysicist W. C. Levengood at his Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory in Grass Lake,Michigan, has done extensive research on crop formation plants and soils since the early1990s. He has published some of his discoveries in the prestigious botany journal,Physiologia Plantarum. He hypothesized that many of the crop formations he has studiedwere produced by plant interaction with a \"spinning plasma vortex.\" That vortex ofstripped positively and negatively charged ions also contains microwave energies.Levengood theorizes that the spinning energy system originates high in the atmospherefrom an unknown source before the vortex descends toward specific places on the Earth'ssurface and leaves behind the baffling and beautiful crop formations now reported indozens of countries around the world since the early 1990s.More Information:See other Earthfiles about American Crop Formations· 04/20/2005 -- Outer Space Impact At Serpent Mound, Ohio, 256 Million Years Ago·10/17/2004 -- American Crop Formations: 1880-2004· 09/04/2004 -- Hillsboro, Ohio Corn Formation - High Strangeness in Soil andPlants· 08/28/2004 -- Cow Mutilation and Loud, Unidentified Sound in Farnam, Nebraska· 07/04/2004 -- Crop Formation in Spanish Fork, Utah· 06/02/2004 -- 2004 Peach Orchard, Arkansas Crop Formation· 05/22/2004 -- 2004 Overview of Crop Formations in Five Countries·10/02/2003 -- Part 1 - Another Soybean Formation Near Seip Mound in Ohio· 09/12/2003 -- Second Soybean Crop Formation in Ohio is Manmade.
