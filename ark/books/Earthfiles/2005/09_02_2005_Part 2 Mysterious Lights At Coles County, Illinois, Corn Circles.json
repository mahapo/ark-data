There were"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"two circles in cattle corn that were discovered by the son of the landowner while he wascutting grass in an adjacent drainage area. Both circles exhibited a radial lay pattern. Theywere not swirled down. They were flattened from the center toward the edge.SORT OF LOOKING LIKE A HUMAN EYE, RADIATING FROM A CENTER POINTIN LINES RADIATING OUTWARD.Yes, although the large circle does have a very slight clockwise spin to it.The larger circle above measured 74' 6\" by 78'. The smaller circle was 22' 10\" by 20' 10\".The radial lay moves from a center point outward to the edges of the circles.Pole photograph © 2005 by Ted Robertson, ICCRA.It also has an outer band of stalks about 4 feet wide that alternated being flattenedclockwise and counterclockwise. Sometimes those areas would overlap. Sometimes theywere diametrically opposed. It appears that the diametrically opposed sections are at boththe north and south points. The overlapping areas are at the east and west points. the northpart of the circle is slightly flattened out, so it's not really a perfect circle.The large circle measures 74.5 feet by 78 feet, so it's more of an elongated ellipse than acircle. The smaller circle is also a slight ellipse being 22 feet 10 inches by 20 feet 10inches. That also had a radial lay. That circle also had just a couple of stalks on the outeredge that were swirled down, literally like four stalks out of the entire formation wereswirled. The rest of it was flattened from the center.Outer edge of circle with a few stalks swirled, rather than radial lay straight from center.Photograph © 2005 by ICCRA."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"In center of small circle, cattle corn stalks were laid in four directions.Photograph © 2005 by Delsey Knoechelman, ICCRA.WHAT ABOUT THE NODES THAT YOU EXAMINED?We did not see widespread node damage. However, there were a couple of stalks thatexhibited what appeared to be expulsion cavities. We also spent an entire day measuringnodes for doing an elongation measurement. I managed to do the numbers on three ofthose and they appear to be statistically elongated, by about 25%. I have to say that in thelarge circle, most of the stalks have already died and were dried up by the time we needthe node measurements. But there were still several stalks that were still green. Thosestalks appeared to have the longest node elongation from all of the plants. So of all thestalks that did not get snapped off and die instantly, the ones that still were alive and greenhad the longest nodes of all the stalks we examined.Above: Growth node has a hole that might be an expulsion cavity caused by microwave energy heatingof the node water, an anomaly found in many crop formations. Below: Node hole and purple-reddiscoloration,also previously reported to be a crop formation anomaly.

We did not find any obvious signs of elevated magnetic particles.We also did not appear to have any radiation levels of electric or magnetic fields. But Ihaven't run the numbers yet to validate that.I will say that while I was out in the field, at one point both Delsey Knoechelman and Iheard a very unusual sound that we could not place. It seemed to be coming from betweenthe two circles and it sounded like a low, mechanical humming type of sound."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Strange SoundCOULD YOU TRY TO MIMIC IT?Couldn't do it for you. It's lower than my vocal register could probably do. Now, we didnot record it, but unusually Ted Robertson later on that night was filming the formationwith his infrared video camera. As he panned across the main circle looking toward thesmall circle in the same direction in which we heard that sound, he said that he hasrecorded an audible interference pattern every time that he panned across that same area.So there is some sort of unusual RF interference pattern that gave him distortion on hisvideotape while he was taping. Mysterious Lights Seen by Multiple EyewitnessesNear Coles County, Illinois, FormationWHAT ABOUT ANYONE REPORTING SEEING ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN THE SKYOR HEARING AN UNUSUAL SOUND AROUND THESE RECENT U. S. PATTERNS?Not in the Greene County, Ohio, or Canisteo, New York, case, but in the Coles County,Illinois, event - once we had arrived, we were contacted by four different people whoreported seeing unusual lights in the sky in the area where the formation was, both aroundthe time of the formation and subsequent to the discovery of the two circles. Like forinstance, there was one person who reported at 4:30 in the morning after the formationwas discovered, they watched two unusually bright, white balls of light with beams of lightshining toward the ground that were spotted in the area toward where the formation waslocated, although the formation was not visible from their location.Three different witnesses described seeing brilliant fire engine red - 'brighter thanfireworks' - balls of light, larger than any stars or planets, but smaller than the full moon.The bright red lights appeared in the sky in the area of the two circles. The appearance ofthe lights caused two of the witnesses to nearly drive off the road. There were twocompletely independent people who came to us at different times to report this sameeyewitness event of seeing the red lights.SO, THE ONLY MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS SO FAR IN AUGUST THEN WEREREPORTED WITH ILLINOIS?As far as I know at this point.DID THE EYEWITNESSES DESCRIBE ANYTHING UNUSUAL ABOUT THEMOTION OF THE LIGHTS IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE CROP?One of the witnesses said they watched for some time and then a light went out. It wasgone for a short time and it appeared again and it had moved to a slightly different area.Then they watched it for some time, and then the light faded down again, was gone off fora short period, and then came back on in a third location. But all three locations weregenerally in the same area of where the two circles were.

Harmonics and Diatonic RatiosTed Robertson, Harpsichord Craftsman: \"It seems that the two Illinois circles in corncreate diatonic ratios when compared to each other using Hawkins style methodology. Justthought I'd play round with these to see how close to being circular they are.I did a simple Hawkins method on these and it turns out that if we take the largest circle at75 feet and the smallest at 20 then I got a ratio of 3.75 (75/20) which is three octavesabove middle C and a fifth.This is the interval from c' to g\"'. So its a fifth three octaves higher following Hawkinsmethodology.Conversely if we took the largest circle as being the lowest note (instead of making it bethe highest as Hawkins would have done in the previous calculation) then starting with thesmallest circle designated as c' then the ratio to the larger circle would sound three octavesand a fourth below. Played on a piano this would give an interval from c' to FFF theinterval is three octaves and a fifth as well.So regardless of which circle we assign to be middle c since we have a three octaves and afifth interval which gives a high \"G\" and a low \"F \" , these are diatonic and notenharmonic ratios. The high G and low F both are \"white notes\" on the piano in the key ofC.For more about the diatonic ratio analysis of crop formations by deceased astronomer andmathematician, Gerald Hawkins, see: Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I-Facts &Eyewitnesses in Earthfiles Shop."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"A harmonic analysis of 2005 Coles County, Illinois, corn circles © 2005 by Ted Robertson, ICCRA. Belleville, Wayne County, MichiganAugust 28, 2005 - CornOn August 28, I received a report of a very small crescent-shaped formation in corn inBelleville, Wayne County, Michigan, southwest of Detroit. The circle is about eight feetacross. ICCRA member, Dr. Charles Lietzau, has made a preliminary investigation, sophotos and additional details will be reported soon.\"More Information:For other Earthfiles reports about U.
