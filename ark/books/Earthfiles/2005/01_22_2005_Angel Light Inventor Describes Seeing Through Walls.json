Some of the many satellites that orbit ourplanet also do work for military and defense agencies. Protecting those satellites is vital tonational security. But this week, a story from North Bay, Ontario, Canada, says aninventor there has come up with a machine that not only can see through walls, it can stopthe electronics in any machine, including high-altitude orbiting satellites and nuclearmissiles. Now, according to the inventor, the Pentagon, Saudi Arabia and France are takingnotice.The inventor calls his wall-penetrating device, \"Angel Light.\" His name is Troy Hurtubise(HURTCH-uh-bees). He is 41-years-old and lives with his wife and family in North Bay,Ontario. Troy has no college degrees, but did study environmental issues for three years atthe Sir Sanford Flemming College in Lindsay, Ontario. Once he was attacked by a grizzlybear and survived. That gave him a lifelong interest in studying bears and he invented a\"bear suit.\" The idea is that for a consulting fee from a bear spray company, Troy will puton his big bear suit and try out new red pepper sprays to see if the sprays will fend offblack bears and grizzlies. I talked with him this week and asked him to explain his bear suitwork and how he came to build the \"Angel Light\" device.Troy Hurtubise standing next to partially assembled \"Angel Light\" invention and one of his red and white\"bear suits\" he wears for protection in black bear and grizzly bear research.

It's specifically designed for my body. I'm a bear behaviorspecialist. I wear the suit. I conduct the research. I try to find the trigger hormone thatNASA has been searching for 20 years, find the best offense and defense against a grizzlybear, aggression techniques, develop deterrent sprays and change radio collars underwinter conditions. Stuff like that.WHO WOULD HIRE YOU?The people who hire me are the companies that make the bear sprays around the worldthat market them to the public. It's a billion dollar business, bear sprays. Grizzly bears ifyou don't have a suit on, you're pretty well dead. As I say to many people in lectures thinkof a Great White Shark. A biologist won't study a Great White Shark unless he's in a cage.No cage, you're dead. Same thing with a grizzly bear. My suit is basically a mobile cage.AND YOU WOULD BE HIRED TO PUT ON YOUR CAGE SUIT TO PROTECT YOUFROM A BLACK BEAR AND GRIZZLY BEAR IN ORDER TO TEST THESE REDPEPPER SPRAYS.Right.\" Inventions Come from Repetitive DreamsTroy says that the ideas for building his bear suits - like the ideas for at least nine otherinventions of his over the past 17 years - have come to him in vivid, repetitive dreams.Troy Hurtubise: \"I've had distinctive, repetitious dreams which I understand from thescientific community is rare since I was 16. I would see the innovation in the dream. Whenit would come back again and again and again, I would have basically a blueprint in mymind. I've always built my suits which is a marvel to the engineering community due to thefact I don't use schematics, I don't use blueprints, I don't use drawings. They come straightout of my head. I build them by hand and it comes out perfectly engineering proportions.They just can't understand how I do it. With all my innovations the big ones \"fire paste\"that MIT has said was 20 years ahead of what NASA is using. That comes out of a dream.The LIMBIC system that's just recent, not more than two months old. That is for thesoldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan that are getting killed needlessly because of their light-skinned HUMMERS. These (inventions of mine) are blast cushions that stop RPGs. Again,from a dream.Angel light. A dream. I see it and I just create it. It's never failed. It always works. I don'tknow why. Einstein once said the imagination and the mind. He went to bed all the timewith a pen and note pad beside him and many times he would come out of a dream andright there, he would write it down. A lot of his theories came from dreams.FOR A GENERAL RADIO AUDIENCE, COULD YOU PLEASE GO BACK TO THEFIRST IN SERIES OF DREAMS YOU HAD ABOUT 'ANGEL LIGHT' AND EXPLAINWHY YOU HAVE CALLED IT ANGEL LIGHT?The first dream started about a year and a half ago. I don't pay too much attention to thefirst dreams because it's just a dream. But when it's repeated basically in the exact samesequence. You can talk to a million people. You might find five that have a repetitivedream. So it's very, very rare.The dream happens again and you're basically in the dream building it from scratch. Youhave to look at Angel Light in its entirety. It's 14 feet long and weighs a quarter of a ton.There is probably 800 to 900 different sections to it. It's quite elaborate. All of this ispieced out in the dream. Then the actual use of it is portrayed in the dream. This time withangel light, it was to see through walls in real time space. It's all the other things that itdoes that's grabbing the attention.And why I called it 'angel light' is that I'm a great believer in Christ and angels. Peoplewould look at me as they have in the last couple of days and ask, 'Why would you callsomething like that with this terrible \"high\" effect that can kill people 'angel light?'I said, 'Why don't you understand angels?' I mean, God the way I look at God is that hisleft hand is Gabriel and his right hand is Michael. When he's in a good mood and wants tosend a message to somebody, he sends Gabriel down who is nice and sweet. When he's in"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"a pissed off mood, he sends Michael down. Look out when Michael starts to come downbecause basically he's the Angel of War. There's always two sides to God and two sides toangels. So, that's what you have. Angel light, yes, can see through walls in real time andspace.Troy Hurtubise standing behind his Angel Light invention. Photograph © 2005 by Phil Novak.First Time Angel Light \"Opened Up\" Cement WallCOULD YOU DESCRIBE THAT FIRST MOMENT WHEN YOU TURNED ANGELLIGHT ON AND WHAT HAPPENED IN FRONT OF YOU?As soon as I turned it on, I mean how can you describe it? It's like out of Star Trek! I saidGeorge Lucas could not imagine this. I mean, the wall opened up. It was terrifying! Itwasn't Eureka! It was like, Holy Geez!!I got so excited that I put my hand in front of it, figuring, 'Holy Geez, I wonder if you cansee inside your hand?' You're talking blood cells, - it was so spooky looking inside my handthat if I had not pulled it back, I'd probably be dead today. Because after I did pull it backafter it had hit the light for only 3 seconds was there a burning feeling? No. Was there aswelling? No. But an hour later, I lost the use of that hand for a year. And I've only got oh,maybe, 60% feeling in it back. I can't even wear my wedding ring.WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED TO THE WALL? DID YOU SEE LIGHT? DID IT JUSTDISAPPEAR? WHAT HAPPENED?What happened is that I've got a wall in front of me 1.5 to 2 feet thick of solid concrete.On the other side of it is the garage. Now, I know what thermal technology is. I know whatradar is. I know what all the technologies are in the world. If you put whatever technologyyou want in front of that wall right now that the military has, you're not going to see thegarage in real time space. People say, 'What is that?' Well, this is what it is. Get ajackhammer. Cut a massive hole in the wall and then fit your front window on it. That'sreal time space. What you see in the garage if you stepped into it is exactly what you areseeing through the wall.And I almost broke my hand twice because what happened is: when you turn angel lighton, a hole the size of the aperture whatever size you are using opens up in the wall. And ittricks you into believing that you could put your hand through the wall. Of course, youcan't. There's still cement there and you'll break your hand.AND SO IT IS AS IF A WINDOW SUDDENLY APPEARS IN THE CEMENT WALL?Exactly. Exactly. It just opens up. And it looks like there's nothing there. It looks likesomeone just took a big chunk out of the wall and all you can see now is what's inside thegarage the car, the license plate, the lawn mower. Just as clear as it can be. You can seethe reds, the whites, the blues. You can read the fine print on newspapers that are lyingaround. It's like you walked into the garage. The problem is if you try to walk through thewall, you'll basically break your face!AND NEITHER YOU NOR ANY SCIENCE YOU'VE DISCUSSED THIS WITHUNDERSTANDS HOW THIS IS WORKING?I don't understand it. But one scientist said, 'The doors you've opened up, it's like anotheruniverse.' To me, it just sees through a wall. It's beautiful, lovely, who cares? I got moreexcited for my father who is an anthropologist and said, 'Oh, my God, son can you imaginethe implications for the anthropological world for ruins and sites that have never beenfound, but only dreamed of?'"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Angel Light Penetration At Archaeological Sites?I said, 'Yeah, let's take a chopper and do a low fly over atop an area that you think thereare ruins underneath there.' I mean, Wow! The ground would open up. It would be likelooking hundreds of feet under the ground with nothing there. You would think that if youjumped out of the chopper, you would fall through the hole. But there is no hole there. Youjust think there's a hole there.I've done it right in my front yard, right in front of the neighbors. Right in the front yard! Ihad a buddy with me and my brother. He said, 'There are pipes underneath the groundhere, Troy, like sewage and gas pipes, stuff like that, all the mains and that right there. 'Canwe see them?'I said, 'I don't know. Let's turn it on.' Boom! My brother actually thought he went to stepinto it. He went to step in to the hole that was not there. It just appears to be a hole there.You can see all the pipes and everything. The whole infrastructure of the street opened up.There it was, bang! Just like that. But if you step on it, you're stepping on the ground. So, Ihave no idea what it's doing.SINCE YOU HAVE THESE IDEAS IN REPETITIVE DREAMS, DO YOU HAVE ANYINTUITIVE SENSE ABOUT WHAT IT IS EXACTLY THAT IS INSPIRING YOU TOCOME UP WITH THESE INVENTIONS?I don't know. I really don't know. My mother is a very devout Catholic. She says, 'Youhave legions of angels around you.' Maybe it's destiny and stuff like that. I don't a have aclue. Inventor Says French Government WantsAngel Light Anti-Satellite WeaponThe French do not care that it can see through walls. Their grabbing Angel Light and theonly reason why the Pentagon is stepping up to the plate now and everybody else isbecause Angel Light can take out anything in the world that runs on electronics. Thatmeans if I point it towards space that's what I'm building right now. That's what Francegave me the money for I'm building a booster to take satellites out into space if they sodesire to do so. An F-18 fighter that's cloaked with stealth technology, it (Angel Fire) canpick it up.But more than than, intercontinental ballistic missiles, tanks, planes, anything that runs onelectronics - which is 90% of all the militaries in the world right now - are totally rendereduseless by Angel Light. So, it's got nothing to do with looking through walls. That's notwhat is grabbing the attention. What's grabbing the attention is that it is now a nationaldefense problem. It's like a small country that's a nobody, but they have Angel Light, nowbecomes a big boy on the block. That's why I'm getting all the attention. That's the travestyof it.WHAT YOU ARE IMPLYING THEN IS THAT WHATEVER ANGEL LIGHT DOES,IT'S INTERFERING WITH THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FREQUENCIES OF SOMEOPERATING MACHINES.It must be doing something because when the French came, they brought it in a box abouta square foot in diameter. It had a glass filament, like a mirror filament on the outside. Iasked, 'What's that?' They said, 'Just a curiosity.' After they saw Angel Light turned on andcould see through the wall, was that impressive to them? That was not impressivecompared to what it did to the box because apparently what was inside the box waselectronics which could not be touched by anything. For the French, there was no way youwere going to knock these electronics out. They put the box in front of Angel Light, and itwas gone in seconds. I told them, 'Well, guys, light, lasers, anything, bounces off mirrors.You put a mirror in front of Angel Light though, and I'll walk right through it. So, it doesnot matter what is inside that box or what you've got for protection, the Angel Light willgo right through it.I've already talked with MIT (Massachusetts Institute for Technology, Boston). They toldme to try every known metal you can think of. I have tried pure tin. I have tried steel,titanium, ceramic, all the way up to lead. And Angel Light goes through it all.\"More Information:"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Troy Hurtubise says he will assemble Angel Light for a press demonstration at his lab inNorth Bay, Ontario, Canada, on February 17, 2005.
