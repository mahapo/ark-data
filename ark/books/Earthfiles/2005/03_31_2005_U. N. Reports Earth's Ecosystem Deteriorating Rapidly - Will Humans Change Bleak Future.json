Reports Earth's Ecosystem Deteriorating Rapidly -Will Humans Change Bleak Future?© 2005 by Linda Moulton Howe \"This (U. N.) report is essentially an audit of nature's economy,and the audit shows we've driven most of the accounts into the red.\"- Jonathan Lash, World Resources Institute March 31, 2005 Washington, D. C. - This week, the United Nation's MillenniumEcosystem Assessment program held press conferences in London, Washington, D.C.,Tokyo, Beijing, New Delhi, Brasilia, Cairo, Nairobi and Rome to announce results from anunprecedented study of the Earth's ecosystem by more than 1300 scientists from 95countries that began in 2001. The current data is sobering. Fifteen of the twenty-fourservices the assessment analyzed have degraded - most notably fresh air and water,fisheries, water purification, forests, other habitats and the regulation of climate, naturalhazards and pests. That means 60% of the Earth's ecosystem is facing serious degradation or destruction by2050 because \"humans have changed ecosystems more rapidly and extensively in the past50 years than in any other period. The result is a substantial and largely irreversible loss indiversity of life on Earth, with some ten to thirty percent of the mammal, bird andamphibian species currently threatened with extinction.\" Sixty percent of the fresh air and water, fisheries, forests and other habitatsare facing serious degradation or destruction by 2050 - only 45 years from now. The black vertical lineon the graph above designates the year 2050. Graphic source: Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Harold A. Mooney, Professor of Environmental Biology at Stanford University andCo-chair of the Assessment's Science Oversight Panel, told the press that the assessment,\"examines the state of the global environment, but it's more than that. It relates goods andservices that ecosystems provide to human well-being. And surprisingly enough, that'snever been done before.\" Prof. Mooney explained further, \"By evaluating the trade-offs that accompany decisionsabout ecosystem services, the assessment will identify priorities on local, regional andglobal scales. In a particular area, for example, it can help policy makers decide whetherthe benefits of increasing food production will outweigh the effects on water quality andbiodiversity by giving them the information they need to make tough decisions. This isreally important because the global view gives averages, and global averages may bemisleading,\" Mooney said, explaining that different ecosystems face different issues suchas overfishing in the Caribbean, groundwater usage in Chile's Atacama Desert or woodfuel harvesting in Zambia. The world's poorest people stand to lose the most fromenvironmental change, because they depend heavily on the natural ecosystem. Oneexample is Sub-Saharan Africa which has severe poverty because climate change has"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"made farming difficult. According to Mooney, the assessment's topics were chosen \"because the organizations thatoversee major international treaties dealing with biological systems requested theinformation. The lack of adequate data to uphold such treaties is what helped convince theUnited Nations to have the assessment done.\" The huge ecosystem study will be released in sections over the next few months:May = Global BiodiversityJune = DesertificationJuly = Wetlands, Impacts on Human Health and Role of Private SectorSept = Five technical reports about ties between ecosystems and human well-being Earth from space courtesy NASA.Websites:http://www.millenniumassessment.org/en/index.aspxhttp://www.wri.org/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
