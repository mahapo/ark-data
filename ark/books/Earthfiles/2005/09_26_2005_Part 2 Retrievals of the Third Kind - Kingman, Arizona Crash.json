Previous Status Report II begins atEarthfiles. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. For all the previous statusreports, see Earthfiles Archives. Leonard H. Stringfield: \"ABSTRACT 5 - Kingman, Arizona Crash Research Director for MUFON, Raymond E. Fowler of Wenham, Massachusetts,watched incredulously as Fritz Werner signed the following affidavit, dated June 7,1973:June 7, 1973, Signed Affidavit by Fritz Werner: 'I, Fritz Werner, do solemnly swear that during a special assignment with theU. S. Air Force on May 21, 1953, I assisted in the investigation of a crashedunknown object in the vicinity of Kingman, Arizona. The object was constructed of an unfamiliar metal which resembledaluminum. It had impacted 20 inches into the sand without any sign ofstructural damage. It was oval and about 30 feet in diameter. An entrance wayhatch had been vertically lowered and opened. It was about 3.5 feet high and1.5 feet wide. I was able to talk briefly with someone on the team who didlook inside, only briefly. He saw two swivel seats, an oval cabin, and a lot ofinstruments and displays. A tent pitched near the object sheltered the dead remains of the only occupantof the craft. It was about 4 feet tall, dark brown complexion, and had twoeyes, two nostrils, two ears and a small, round mouth. It was clothed insilvery, metallic suit and wore a skull cap of the same type of material. It woreno face covering or helmet. I certify that the above statement is true by affixing my signature to thisdocument this 7th day of June, 1973.' According to Ray Fowler, a researcher of highest credentials, here is Werner's story: 'I was project engineer on a U. S. Air Force contract with the Atomic EnergyCommission (AEC) for 'Operation Upshot-Knothole' at the Atomic Proving"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Ground, Nevada. My job involved the measuring of blast effects on varioustypes of buildings, especially erected for the tests. On May 20, 1953, I worked most of the day at Frenchman Flat. In theevening, I received a phone call from the test director, Dr. Ed Doll, informingme that I was to go on a special job the next day. On the following day, Ireported for special duty and was driven to Indian Springs Air Force Base,near the Proving Ground, where I joined about fifteen other specialists. Wewere told to leave all valuables in the custody of the military police. We werethen put on a military plane and flown to Phoenix, Arizona. We were notallowed to fraternize. There, we were put on a bus with other personnel whowere already there. The bus windows were blacked out so that we could notsee where we were going. We rode for an estimated four hours. I think wewere in the area of Kingman, Arizona, which is northwest of Phoenix and nottoo far from the Atomic Proving Ground in Nevada. During the bus trip, wewere told by an Air Force Full Colonel that a super secret Air Force vehiclehad crashed and that since we were all specialists in certain fields, we were toinvestigate the crash in terms of our own specialty and nothing more. Finally, the bus stopped and we disembarked one at a time as our names werecalled and were escorted by military police to the area that we were toinspect. Two spotlights were centered on the crashed object, which was ringedwith guards. The lights were so bright that it was impossible to see thesurrounding area. The object was oval and looked like two deep saucers, oneinverted upon the other. It was about 30 feet in diameter, with convexsurfaces, top and bottom. These surfaces were about twenty feet in diameter.It was constructed of a dull silver metal, like brushed aluminum. The metalwas darker where the saucer 'lips' formed a rim, around which were whatlooked like 'slots.' A curved open hatch door was located on the leading endand was vertically lowered. There was a light coming from the inside, but itcould have been installed by the Air Force. My particular job was to determine, from the angle and depth of impact intothe sand, how fast the vehicle's forward and vertical velocities were at thetime of impact. The impact had forced the vehicle approximately twentyinches into the sand. There were no landing gear. There were also no marks ordents, that I can remember, on the surface - not even scratches. Questionshaving nothing to do with our own special areas were not answered. An armed military policeman guarded a tent pitched nearby. I managed toglance inside at one point and saw the dead body of a four-foot, human-likecreature in a silver metallic-looking suit. The skin on its face was dark brown.This might have been caused by exposure to our atmosphere. The face wasnot covered, but it had a metallic skullcap device on its head. As soon as each person finished his task, he was interviewed over a taperecorder and escorted back to the bus. On the way back to the bus, I managedto talk briefly with someone else going back to it at the same time. He told methat he had glanced inside the object and saw two swivel-like seats, as well asinstruments and displays. An airman, who noticed we were talking, separatedus and warned us not to talk with each other. After we all returned to the bus, the Air Force Colonel who was in charge hadus raise our right hands and take an oath not to reveal what we hadexperienced. I was instructed to write my report in longhand and not to typeor reproduce it. A telephone number was given me to call when the report wascomplete. I called the number and an airman picked up the report.' Ray Fowler states that Werner held several engineering and management positionsat Wright-Patterson AFB between June 1949, and January 1960. During that period,he worked in the Office of Special Studies of what was then the Air MaterielCommand Installations Division. Later, he designed aircraft landing gear andbecame Chief of Alighting Devices within the Aircraft Laboratory at Wright AirDevelopment Center. At the time of the alleged incident, he was on assignment tothe Atomic Energy Commission at the Atomic Proving Ground in Nevada. Fowler also states that Werner told him that he sympathized with the Air Force'ssecret handling of the UFO problem and added that the Air Force did not knowwhere UFOs originated. Werner also said that the Air Force believed that the UFOs"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"were interplanetary vehicles, but that they did not know how to handle the situation.They did not want to create panic. Comments Fowler: 'There were inconsistencies in Werner's story, but most appearedto be in the realm of memory lapses and exaggerations by the witness. Formeremployers that were checked held him in high esteem and all described him as ahighly competent and moral individual. Having published a number of technicalpapers, Werner also holds membership in the American Association for theAdvancement of Science.' In Fowler's continuing evaluation, he cites one piece of evidence which seems togive a strong element of truth to Werner's account. In an attempt to pin down theexact date of the alleged incident, Werner agreed to show his diary he kept in thosedays. On its aging papers on May 20, 1953, it read in part: 'Well, pen's out of ink.Spent most of day on Frenchman's Flat surveying cubicles and supervising weldingof a plate girder bridge sensor which cracked after last shot. ...Got funny call fromDr. Doll at 10:00. I am going on a special job tomorrow.' On May 21, 1953, the diary read: 'Up at 7:00. Worked most of the day onFrenchman with cubicles. Letter from Bet. She's feeling better now - thankgoodness. Got picked up at Indian Springs AFB at 4:30 p.m. for a job I can't write ortalk about.' COMMENT: In my book, Situation Red, I cover the Werner story in full based on myconversations with Ray Fowler. Said Fowler, 'With more substantiation, it couldblow the lid off secrecy.' I agree. One final note: the name Fritz Werner is fictitious,but I feel that his story - although embellished - is basically true. One Intelligencesource commented, 'A lot of it is just story.' ABSTRACT 6 Finally a name of a witness surfaces - an Air Force Major named Daly - who was ametallurgist stationed at Wright-Patterson AFB in 1953. He relates his adventureswith a crashed UFO. The source for this information comes from fellow Cincinnati-based researcher,Charles Wilhelm. A friend of Charles' father, he related in 1968, that in April 1953he was flown to a destination unknown, where it was hot and sandy, to examine thecrashed UFO. He was blindfolded and driven to a point about 30 minutes away fromthe base of operations. There, inside a tent, standing in soft sand, his blindfold wasremoved. From there he was taken to a location where he saw a silvery metalliccraft about 25 to 30 feet in diameter. The exterior of the craft, he said, was notdamaged. However, his on-the-spot two day analysis of the ship's metal, using theequipment he carried with him, showed that it was not native to Earth. Major Daly,although he was not permitted to enter the craft, observed that the craft's entrancemeasured four to five feet high and two to three feet wide. COMMENT: Major Daly's blindfolded trip to the crash site, similar to that of Fritz Werner's,indicates that it was common procedure for the military to use extreme securitymeasures relative to UFO retrievals. It is to be noted that Major Daly's experiencetakes place in April 1953, a month shy of Fritz Werner's which was in May 1953.Also, to be noted is that Daly did not see any dead alien bodies. Maybe they hadalready been removed? Or, if the craft was found undamaged, as he attested, it ispossible the occupants managed to evade capture? Or, perhaps, there were twocrashes in a desert area in the Spring of 1953. If, however, both the reports ofWerner and Daly are describing the same crashed UFO event, it is possible that Dalyused the wrong month. ABSTRACT 7 'I'm almost positive it happened in 1953,' said my informant, a man with a longcareer as a pilot in the military who held the rank of Warrant Officer in the Armyduring the early 1950s. Now serving in the Air National Guard, he stood by me,facing a large wall map of the U. S. in a backroom of the Administration Building atLunken Airport in Cincinnati. Earlier, in a large front room before about 25 pilots, Ihad just spoken on the subject of UFOs. It was now the late Summer of 1977 as he"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"tried to recall the exact time when he stood as a witness, at a distance of about 12feet, peering at five crates on a forklift inside a hangar at Wright-Patterson AFB. In each of three crates, he said, were the recovered dead bodies of small humanoids;the contents of the other two crates were not discernible. As he related thisastonishing information in a matter-of-fact manner, he pointed vaguely to an area inArizona on the map. 'Here's where it approximately happened,' he said. 'It was adesert area, but I don't have the name of the location.' There was no one else in the map room when he told me about the incident. Hemade certain of that. 'It's still a secret and at the time I had to swear to it,' he said. 'Iwas in the right place at the right time when the crates arrived at night by DC-7.' As we stood at the map, my informant described what appeared to be hastilyprepared wooden crates. In these, little humanoids, appearing to be four feet tallwere lying unshrouded on a fabric, which he explained prevented freeze burn fromthe dry ice packed beneath. As a number of Air Police stood silent guard nearby thecrates, he managed to get a reasonably good but brief glimpse of the humanoidfeatures. He recalls that their heads were disproportionately larger than the bodies, with skinthat looked brown under the hangar light above. The head appeared to be hairlessand narrow. The eyes seemed to be open, the mouth small, and nose, if any, wasindistinct. When asked about their attire, he said they appeared to be wearing tight-fitting dark suits. Because of the tight-fitting suit, there was one revealing feature - asurprising feature. One of the humanoids appeared to him to be female. He said,'Either one of the aliens had an exceedingly muscular chest, or the bumps were afemale's breasts.' Later, he learned from one of the crew members, with whom hebunked at the barracks, that the body of one of the aliens was, indeed, that of afemale. My informant also heard from the crew member that one of the little humanoids wasstill alive aboard the craft when the U. S. military team arrived. Attempts were madeto save its life with oxygen, but were unsuccessful. Another question, an important one, was promptly answered by my informant. Howdid the military know about the crash and where to go? He said he heard from acrew member that the UFO was picked up by special tracking equipment at Mt.Palomar in California. They provided the coordinates to the military to determinethe crash area. The retrieved craft found intact, he later heard, was sent to Wright-Patterson. He had no more details when or by what means. COMMENT: There were other details furnished by my informant concerning his encounter atWright-Patterson and on other sensitive UFO issues, that might be identifiable ortraceable to him. On his request, I have avoided using these data. For certain, thereare a lot of things connected with the UFO that the public does not know about.\" Continued in Part 3 - Alien bodies in Dutton, Montana, and Wright-Patterson AFBCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
