This cancer-killing virus infects 80% of the human population.If the AAV-2 virus is so prevalent, why isn't it killing cancers all the time in people? Iasked Dr. Meyers what activates the virus to kill cancer cells in his laboratory?Craig Meyers, Ph.D., Prof. of Microbiology and Immunology, Penn State College ofMedicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania: \"That's what we are trying to find out. We're acervical cancer lab and cervical cancer is caused by another virus called Papilloma virus.We've been studying how these two viruses interact with each other. Typically, you doexperiments that take 2 to 3 days. But we let the cells keep growing after putting bothviruses in and at 6 days, all the cancer cells died.So, at first we thought there was something wrong. When all your cells die, you think yourincubator something is wrong with it. So we repeated it. We've repeated it with cervicalcancer cells about 30 to 40 times and every time, it's at 6 days. It doesn't matter if thecervical cancer cells come from a low-grade lesion, a middle-grade, a high-grade, aninvasive cancer of the cervix. It does not matter. It kills all the cells at exactly 6 days.We were telling this to a friend of ours and he said, 'Why don't you try other cancers?'Other cancers are not caused by viruses such as breast cancer and prostate cancer. Thosearen't a viral cause.We told him at first we did not think it would work, but finally we said we would do it justto quiet him down. So we went out and got breast cancer cell lines and prostate cancer celllines and squamous carcinoma lines and we did the same thing. Every single one of themat 6 days, they all died.THE ONLY INGREDIENT YOU ARE ADDING IS THE AAV-2 VIRUS?That's it. We are not changing that virus in any way. A lot of people say it looks like genetherapy. No, gene therapy people genetically change the virus. They manipulate it andengineer it in a different way. This is just a naturally occurring virus and all we are doing isputting it on the cells and so far with the different types we've tested, it's killed them all in6 days.Now, we don't have enough people or funding right now to go as far as we would like. Wehaven't tested lung cancer. We haven't tested colon cancer or anything like that. We justtried to get a group of cancers that were very important and we could get the cells quiteeasily.IS YOUR UNIT AT THE PENN STATE COLLEGE OF MEDICINE THE FIRST TO TRYTO SEE IF THE AAV-2 VIRUS IN A P ETRIE DISH WOULD KILL A VARIETY OFCANCER CELLS?You know, it's hard to say. I believe we are. But the thing is if people did it and they didnot wait long enough. That's the key. Most people do experiments and they wait two days,three days. This took 6 days and it's always 6 days. Someone might have tried it, but theydon't tell you about it because they waited 3 days and nothing happened.CONGRATULATIONS, SIR, ON YOUR PATIENCE.I guess I've had 4 boys and I've learned to be patient. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"AAV-2 Virus Is in 80% of HumanPopulation Without Causing IllnessWHAT DOES THE AAV-2 VIRUS DO IN A NORMAL PERSON?Nothing. We've known people who have been infected for a long time. It's never beenshown to cause any disease or ill effects in people. And in fact, in our culture system,when we put it on normal cells, it (AAV-2 virus) does not do anything to them.IF IT INFECTS AN ESTIMATED 80% OF THE POPULATION, WHY WOULD THEREBE MUCH CANCER AT ALL?There are two possibilities: one is that it's not in the right places where you're getting thecancer. It (AAV-2 virus) might infect you in another area (away from cancer cells). Theother possibility is that when the virus gets in (the body), most of the time it does notreplicate. It just puts its DNA into your DNA and stays there. So, it's not activated. But inour system, it's going directly to the cancer cells. And it's activated.OH, I SEE. IN THE PRESENCE OF THE CANCER CELLS, IT SEEMS TO TURN ONTHE FIGHTING ABILITY OF THE AAV-2 THAT OTHERWISE IS A QUIET VIRUS INA NORMAL, HEALTHY INDIVIDUAL?Yes, I think you said it perfectly. That's what we are finding. Originally we thought it wasdue to hurting the Papilloma virus that causes cervical cancer. But it's clearly not that. Wehave some initial experiments done where we are trying to identify what the intersection isin the cells. What is that one point in the cell that is common to all these cancers thatAAV-2 is recognizing and says, 'This is bad.' And causes the cancer cells to commitsuicide. It's what we call 'apoptosis.' It's a genetically programmed suicide of the cell whereif something is going wrong with the cell and a signal is sent out and the cells just die. In alot of cancers, that ability to kill itself has been removed. So, what AAV-2 seems to bedoing is first, recognizing these as being abnormal cells. And then reinstating that pathway,that ability to cause apoptosis or cell suicide and killing the cancer cells. Now, we are justtrying to figure out what are all the steps leading up to that. What Activates AAV-2 To Kill Cancer Cells?WHAT WOULD ACTIVATE THIS AAV-2 BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE IT IS THEMIRACLE DRUG AGAINST CANCER?I think what's activating is that somehow it knows it's in an abnormal cell. Even thoughcancers are very different in many ways, there are a lot of commonalities. This has beenthe goal of a lot of cancer therapies is to try to find that common link between them. Now,this probably won't affect all cancers. But so far the ones we've tested, it's worked on.SINCE WE THINK OF VIRUSES AS BEING INVADERS THAT USUALLY DO CAUSEDISEASE IN HUMANS AND ANIMALS, WHAT IS IT THAT THIS VIRUS IS DOINGWHEN IT'S IN 80% OF THE HUMAN POPULATION?You know, it seems to go in and realizes there is no other virus there and the cell is notabnormal and seems to take its DNA and stick it into our DNA and just sits there waitingfor something to happen. In fact, you can reproduce this in tissue culture in the lab. Youcan put it in our normal cells and that's what it's doing putting its DNA into our DNA and itjust waits.COULD IT BE LIKE MOTHER NATURE'S ANSWER TO CANCER THAT YOU'VEJUST FINALLY STUMBLED UPON?That's what we would like to think. That's not a very scientific type statement to make. Butright now, all the data we have is saying that. That this is just a natural everybody islooking for that natural plant or drug in trees. Some of these things have come into theclinic. This is a little different, but it seems to be a natural virus out there that seems to beable to kill cancer cells.So, how many times has it done that naturally and we just don't know about it? There's noway to know that. But now we seem to be able to harness that ability and direct it to thecancer cells we want.Our immediate goal for the future is to talk to people here in our clinical side and get aroad map about what do we need to do to get this into the clinic and start testing it withreal people with real cancers? That's the immediate goal."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Our other goals would be if we're putting this AAV-2 virus in, what part of it is actuallycausing the cancer cells to die. Then maybe we could focus on that one piece and enhanceor make the process very specific.The other area is the process by which the AAV-2 virus is causing the cancer cells to die. Ifwe could figure out what the actual pathway is, maybe we could enhance it. So maybe wecould make it even a better killer of cancer. Because once it goes into the body, we don'tknow there are a lot of variabilities we don't know how to work with.Initially, we would probably try to inject it straight into a cancer tissue. But eventually,you would like to have it spread throughout the body because (the ability of cancer cellsto) metastasize is a bigger problem. You would like the AAV-2 virus to go everywhere andpick up what surgery or an injection would miss. Those are our goals. How long it's goingto take will depend on how much financial support we can get together. How to Get From Petrie Dish to Human Cancer Patients?WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS A NATURALLY OCCURRING VIRUS THAT YOU AREDEMONSTRATING CAN KILL CANCER CELLS ON A PETRIE DISH AND HOW DOYOU GET IT FROM THE PETRIE DISH INTO ACTIVE CANCER SITES IN HUMANBODIES?That's the next big step. That's what our immediate goal is. But we're hoping that throughthis press release and getting some of the data out there, maybe some private fundinggroup or some industry will step in and help us out here. I've already received a call fromthe National Cancer Institute and they are looking to see if people there can work with usand help move this forward.IT ALMOST SOUNDS AS IF YOU COULD GENERATE THIS AAV-2 VIRUS IN BULK,IT COULD ALMOST BE APPLIED TO CANCER TUMORS DIRECTLY IN SOMEWAY AND THEY WOULD KILL THE CANCERS.Yeah, because with industrial techniques, we can make as much of this virus as we needto. We can make liters and liters of it. Making the reagent is not going to be the bigproblem. The problem is getting through the red tape. What do we still have to do to provethat it's ready to go into patients?BUT IF IT'S ALREADY EXISTING IN 80% OF THE HUMAN POPULATION, WHYCOULDN'T THIS BE FULL SPEED AHEAD AS A WAY TO CURE AS MANYCANCERS AS POSSIBLE JUST BY TRYING IT?I would think that. But not having I'm a basic scientist. We just deal in the laboratory. So Idon't have a lot of experience in the area of clinical trials. But you would think there is alot in favor of moving it forward fast. The fact that so many people have been infected bythis AAV-2 virus and it's never hurt anybody. In the lab, we've shown it does not hurt thenormal cells. It only hurts the cancer cells. So you would think it could move forward. Butthe way red tape and everything is now days. You have to be careful. There are a lot ofpeople who come up with things they say might be important. But in the end, it does notwork or makes people sick. But I don't see how this is going to do that. I don't see itmaking people sick. It's been around in most of us at one time or another and it's nevermade anybody sick. So, it should be able to move forward quickly.USING THE METAPHOR OF PUTTING THE CANCER CELL ON A PETRIE DISHAND THEN APPLYING THE AAV-2 VIRUS WHICH KILLS IT, COULD YOU TAKETHE RAW AAV-2 VIRUS FROM THE PETRIE DISH AND PAINT IT, SO TO SPEAK,ON A SKIN MELANOMA OR SKIN SQUAMOUS CELL CANCER. WOULD ITATTACK SKIN CANCERS IMMEDIATELY?That's what we are thinking. Squamous cell carcinoma which we tested from a skin cancerand we would think you could just apply it. Maybe someone could put the AAV-2 virus ina cream or salve or we just put it on or inject it inside the tissue to work its way out. Again,if we get the clinical trials, there may be multiple techniques tried or someone will sit downand figure out what is the best chance, or the best way of doing it, and try that.\"Website: Penn State: http://live.psu.edu/story/12505Credits"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
