By the time he was fourteen years old around Labor Dayin 1967, he and his parents had moved to Jackson, Michigan. During 1966 to 1967,hundreds of people had reported unidentified flying objects in the Michigan skies. HouseMinority Leader, Gerald R. Ford, R-Mich, was so concerned about all the UFO sightingsthat on March 25, 1966, he broadcast the following statement on national radio:Gerald R. Ford: \"I believe Congress should thoroughly investigate the rash ofreported sightings of unidentified flying objects in Southern Michigan and otherparts of the country.\"I feel a congressional inquiry would be most worthwhile because the Americanpeople are intensely interested in the UFO stories, and some people are alarmed bythem. Air Force investigators have been checking on such reports for years, buthave come up with nothing very conclusive.\"In the light of these new sightings and incidents near Ann Arbor, Michigan, andelsewhere, it would be a very wholesome thing for a committee of the Congress toconduct hearings and to call responsible witnesses from the executive branch of thegovernment and other witnesses who say they have sighted these objects. I think theAmerican people would feel better if there was a full-blown investigation of thesemysterious flying objects, which some persons honestly believe that they haveseen.\"Congressman Ford's request for a congressional inquiry is what caused the controversialCondon Report to be produced by physicist Edward Condon, Ph.D., at the University ofColorado in Boulder. Today that historic report is considered to have been a deliberatewhitewash of the UFO phenomenon in order to deflect media and public attention.SCIENTIFIC STUDY OFUNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTSConducted by the University of ColoradoUnder contract No. 44620-67-C-0035 With the United States Air ForceDr. Edward U.

The summer was cooling down, getting close to Labor Day, I think. I wasasleep in my bedroom. We were in a 2-story house. My father had come in and woke meup. He said, 'John, John, wake up! Look at this!' I went to the window and looked up in thesky where he was indicating. All I saw were the stars. I thought it was just a very clearnight. And he said, 'Keep watching.'All of a sudden, the stars started to move. It was like the little spaceships were exactly infront of where the stars would be so that I thought it was just stars. I didn't see the doubleimage. Then all of a sudden, I saw a double image and they were spreading out. They werebasically imitating the direction of the stars, but they were off angle just enough that Icould see it.Drawings 1 - 5 by John DotsonOf Labor Day Weekend 1967 \"Moving Stars\" :"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Drawing 1: Big Dipper constellation and surrounding \"stars.\"Drawing 2: Big Dipper \"stars\" move away from real Big Dipper constellation.Then they started moving around, a few at a time, kind of like a leaf blowing in the wind orsomething.

Pretty soon, they started makingpatterns in the sky: triangles, stars, hexagrams, pentagrams, circles.Draw ing 3: Big Dipper \"stars\" move all over sky, forming triangles, stars, hexagrams,pentagrams and circles in Drawings 4 and 5 below."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"They just continued on like this I thought it was just for a half hour or so. But, by myclock, by the time it was all over, it was like 4 in the morning. And Dad had just come intomy room soon after midnight.WAS YOUR DAD THERE AT THAT MOMENT, TOO?Yes, he was watching it all, too. I don't know why he would have bothered with such athing, or even looking up at it. I would not have thought he was the kind of person whowas into those things.YOU ARE DESCRIBING SOMETHING STARTLING THAT ANY HUMAN SHOULDFIND AMAZING AND WATCH. WHAT I'M TRYING TO ASK IS: IF YOUR FATHERCAME INTO YOUR ROOM AT MIDNIGHT, WAS HE STILL THERE AT 4 A.M.?Yes, he was there with me.DID YOU SAY TO EACH OTHER SOMETHING ABOUT FOUR HOURS HAVINGPASSED?No, we really didn't notice the time until it all stopped. We just said, 'That's fantastic!Amazing!' He walked out and I headed back for the bed and looked at my clock and it waslike around 4 in the morning.DO YOU AND YOUR FATHER THINK YOU WERE ABDUCTED? OR DID YOUWATCH FOR FOUR HOURS?I think we watched for four hours. We were mesmerized by what we saw, most surely. Butat no time did I feel like he was not there. Did Anyone Else See 1967 Labor DayWeekend \"Moving Stars\"?IF YOU WATCHED THIS AMAZING DISPLAY IN THE SKY FOR FOUR HOURS,WOULDN'T YOUR NEIGHBORS AND OTHER RESIDENTS HAVE SEENSOMETHING SIMILAR?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"To the best of my knowledge, no one ever said anything about having seen anything. Asfar as I know, my father and I were the only two people who witnessed that particularnight.SO, HE DID NOT GO GET YOUR MOM?No.DID YOU ASK ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS ABOUT IT?In school, I kind of like hinted around about it. I said, 'During all this UFO stuff these lastfew weeks, few months, have any of you sever seen anything?' They all said they had not.YOU NEVER WENT TO A TEACHER OR A STUDENT AND EXPLAINED WHATYOU AND YOUR DAD HAD SEEN?No, I never told anyone.WHY? WHY DO YOU THINK YOU NEVER TOLD ANYBODY?There wasn't anyone to tell. There was your standard gossip about it (UFOs), butspecifically I never told anybody for a few years after that.AND YET THAT WAS THE YEAR UFOS WERE BEING TALKED ABOUT INGENERAL AND CONGRESSMAN GERALD FORD CALLED FOR ACONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION. SO, WHAT PUZZLES ME WITH ALL OF THENEWS AND WHAT WAS GOING ON, IT WOULD SEEM THAT YOU AND YOURDAD WOULD HAVE CALLED UP THE POLICE, THE NEWSPAPER, WOULD HAVECALLED UP EVERYBODY AND SAID, 'THE STARS WERE MOVING LAST NIGHT,BUT THEY WEREN'T THE STARS. THEY HAD TO BE UFOS.'Well, you have to take our background. We weren't originally from Michigan. We werefrom Tennessee. We are mountain folk. When something unusual like that happens, youmight write it down in a memoir, but you don't talk about it.WHAT WERE YOU AFRAID OF?It just didn't seem the right thing to talk about it.I KNOW, BUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU DID?You'd get noticed. Basically, the kind of people I was raised with, you just didn't want toget too noticed. It's all right to go out and do the farming and go to church and then haveyour business selling produce. But you don't want too many people looking too close atwhat you're doing because on top of the produce, you might have a basket of spinachcovering up several half pints of moonshine. You never know! (laughs)I SEE.You don't want a lot of notoriety. Thirty-Eight Years Later in 2005IN THE PAST 38 YEARS, I TAKE IT THAT THOSE FOUR HOURS OF OBJECTSMOVING IN THE SKY INTO ALL THOSE PATTERNS HAVE HAUNTED YOU EVERSINCE?Yes, really they have.YOU ARE 52-YEARS-OLD AS YOU TALK TO ME NOW, DO YOU HAVE ANYMOREINSIGHT ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP OF YOUR LIFE ON THIS PLANET TOSOMETHING ELSE OUT THERE?I contemplate that. I wonder about that. It's like somehow we've managed to co-exist andwe're still managing to co-exist by not letting everybody know they are there.AND YOU WANTED ME TO KNOW ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU ANDYOUR DAD IN 1967 WHY, EXACTLY?That one night changed his life (John's father deteriorated as an alcoholic) and it changedmy life (new interest in the spiritual and paranormal) and there were thousands ofMichigan people who had seen these events. According to records, that particular area of"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Michigan had huge percentages of increases in mental problems, depressions and anxietiesand bipolar much more than the rest of the country.SO THE IMPLICATION IS THAT IF THERE WERE EXTRATERRESTRIALS IN THECRAFT THAT WERE MAKING ALL THE PATTERNS FOR THOSE FOUR HOURS ASYOU AND YOUR FATHER WATCHED, THEY MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN TRYINGOUT SOME KIND OF EXPERIMENTATION ON THE HUMAN COMMUNITY INMICHIGAN IN 1967 THAT RESULTED IN A LOT OF MENTAL ANGUISH?Ye s . Ye s .BUT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MENTAL IMPRESSION MEANING LIKE A PICTUREIN YOUR HEAD, OR IN A DREAM, OR IN MEDITATION AN IMPRESSION OFWHICH SPECIFIC TYPE OF BEING OR ENTITY WAS INVOLVED IN THOSECRAFT?Usually I used to find myself focusing on the greys, the standard greys.\"Website:http://www.presidentialufo.com/gerald_ford_ufos.htmhttp://ufocasebook.com/bestufopictures2.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
