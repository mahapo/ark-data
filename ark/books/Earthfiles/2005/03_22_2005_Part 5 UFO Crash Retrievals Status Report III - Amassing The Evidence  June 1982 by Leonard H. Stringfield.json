The series of status reports, I through VII, werewritten by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report IV begins atEarthfiles 021205. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994.Tommy Blann, March 30, 1982: Early 1970s - UFO Project At Fort Hood, Texas? \"'In the latter part of 1973, the entire Southeastern section of the U. S. wasundergoing a wave of UFO sightings. The Central Texas area had an unusually largenumber of reports coming out of the farming communities around Calvert, Bremond,Temple and a few other small towns which are east of Fort Hood. Fort Hood, Gray AFB and regional towns of Temple, Bremond and Calvert and the Brazos Riverlay between Waco, Texas, to the north and Austin, Texas, to the south. On November 21, 1973, Gracia Unger, Editor of the Calvert Tribune, and herhusband, Jack, along with my wife and I, we witnessed two UFOs near the BrazosRiver area during the height of the activity. The UFOs were shaped like 'a brick withthe ends worn off' and had a series of multi-colored, blinking lights on its surface. The metallic structure of one of the craft was readily visible by the intense silver-blue-white glow that surrounded the craft as it approached us at a low altitude. Thebody of the craft appeared to be made of an aluminum type metal construction. Itwas definitely a manufactured aircraft of some type and not just a ball-of-light in thenight sky. The two UFOs were first noticed coming out of the northwest at a high altitude. Oneappeared at a slightly lower altitude than the other. As they neared the Brazos River,we became aware of the sound of helicopters approaching also out of the Northwest.At first, we thought these things might be helicopters until they got closer and thenwe saw the navigational lights on the helicopters headed toward these UFOs. Therewere seven helicopter in a line formation moving swiftly toward our location. The UFOs were moving very slowly and would stop for short periods of time, one ata considerably lower altitude than the other. As the helicopters approached, wenoticed that they were large Chinooks which took up a tight formation around and"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"over these UFOs. Also, two jet interceptors entered the area from the southwest andcircled over the UFOs and helicopters as they proceeded south. The UFOs andhelicopters disappeared out of our line-of-sight behind a clump of trees several milesin the distance. It appeared the UFOs might have landed, but since there were noback roads leading to the area, we do not know. The jets continued circling and thenfinally headed southwest. The next day, Gracia called Fort Hood and they told her that 'there had been aroutine reconnaissance training mission in progress that night, but they denied anyknowledge of 'flying saucers' being in the area. A more in-depth discussion of these events and others around the Calvert, Texas,area was published in the Spring 1975, Vol. 2, No. 3 issue of Saga UFO Report. It is interesting to note the similarities in this incident and that of the Cash/Landrumincident of December 29, 1980, in which a low level UFO was being 'escorted' by anumber of helicopters, some Chinooks and possibly Hueys, near Dayton, Texas. Acheck with surrounding military installations revealed that Gray AAF/Fort Hoodadmitted that sometime during that period 'more than 100 helicopters came in fromthe field for effect.' A detailed account of this incident was published in the Winter1981, Vol. 9, No. 4 issue of Saga UFO Report. Underground Installation at Fort Hood, Texas In the winter of 1974, while giving a talk show on UFOs in the Central Texas area, Iwas told by the news director of the television station after the show that whilefilming over at Fort Hood he found out about the underground installation and thatthey were still conducting UFO research even though 'Project Bluebook' had beenterminated. He told me that the men who flew the helicopters were code-named'BLUEBOYS.' He said there was a 'special group' involved in this UFO project. In 1975, while investigating the crashed disc stories, I came across a Lt. Col. in theAir Force, who was stationed at Carlswell AFB near Fort Worth, that informed meabout the UFO project at Fort Hood as well as a number of other militaryinstallations here in the States and overseas. (See Case B-4 this report.) In 1976, I met an individual in McGregor, Texas, who told me that his father workedin the secret underground complex. He told me not to breathe a word of this to thepublic since his father's career could be seriously jeopardized and the fact that hewas not even supposed to know what his father was involved in on the base. Hestated that 'the technology that is being applied in this underground complex wouldremind someone of a science fiction thriller. It is unbelievable what they know andcan do from this area.' 1975 UFO Crash near Mexia, Texas? Mexia, Texas, east of Waco and northeast of Fort Hood Military Reservation and Gray AFB. During the spring of 1975, I had been notified by some people in theGroesbeck-Mexia area that a UFO had been observed coming out of the southheaded north and appeared to have crashed in the heavily wooded farmland areanear Mexia. I immediately dispatched an investigative team to the area that nightand talked with these people and the police department hoping to get sometrajectory on the object. While talking with the captain of the Mexia Fire Department, I found out that theTexas Department of Public Safety had notified Fort Hood/Gray AAF about theincident and they were sending a squadron of helicopters to the area to search forthe crashed object."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" I realized my efforts would be futile since 'they' would be well-equipped withinfrared surveillance instruments and other sophisticated electronic instrumentationfrom the air. We searched desperately to find the spot from the ground before thehelicopters arrived, but our efforts proved fruitless. We observed the helicopters asthey approached the area that night, but they were apparently on a heading that tookthem a number of miles above where we had been searching in the Mexia area. Later, I found out that the Texas Department of Public Safety works closely withFort Hood/Gray AAF in matters such as this, which came as a surprise to me. On December 4, 1981, I gave a two-hour radio talk show on the Ed Busch programat KAAM radio station in Dallas, Texas, called 'America Overnight' via satellite.About halfway through the program, we had a caller from Ohio that told us in thesummer of 1975, he was stationed at Fort Hood with an aviation unit, RS-2Intelligence, as a helicopter pilot and that one night around 10:00 p.m., he wasdriving with a friend on a highway near Fort Hood when they both saw a UFOaccompanied by 'Army helicopters.' He said, 'I spent a lot of time flying helicopters and I know what one looks like atnight, and if it's not. And the large object that we saw - there is no way it could havebeen a helicopter! It was an oblong, disc-type thing with a reddish light. The nextday when I got back to base, I asked my friend that worked in the air traffic controlout of the airfield if anything had happened. they didn't know anything. And I was agood friend to quite a few pilots so I asked them. No one knew anything. I thoughtthis was unusually strange, because if something had happened you would usuallyget it through the grapevine.' He later found out that if he kept asking questions about what he had seen, he mightnot have his job anymore at the base. This was impressed upon his mind by some ofhis pilot friends, so he dropped the matter. 1947 to 1952: Highest Number of UFO Sightings in U. S. I have also found of interest the statistics of the frequency of object, unit, and allsightings within the United States from 1947 to 1952, by subdivisions of one degreeof latitude and longitude as listed on page 47 of 'FLYING SAUCERS: ANALYSISOF THE AIR FORCE PROJECT BLUEBOOK SPECIAL REPORT NO.14'prepared by Dr. Leon Davidson. It appears that the highest number of UFO sightings occurred in four major areas ofthe United States. Those are: Los Alamos Scientific Labs, New Mexico; Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio; the Washington, D. C. area; and Gray AAF/FortHood in Central Texas. Three of those areas are well-known for being 'sensitive' keymilitary installations concerned with the national defense of the United States. Butthe fourth, Gray AAF/Fort Hood is not so well-known for its activities in defensematters, other than those I discussed in the beginning of this report. The implicationof these statistics is not presently known, but it is interesting to see that GrayAAF/Fort Hood once again enters into the picture. There have been a number of interesting UFO cases that have taken place in andaround Los Alamos Scientific Laboratories, New Mexico and Gray AAF/Fort Hood,Texas, and between those two areas. Some of these cases such as the Socorro, NewMexico incident and the Eddie Laxton incident near Sheppard AFB, Wichita Falls,Texas and others seem to imply experimental testing of a new type of aircraft.'Leonard Stringfield Comment: Blann's help in my endeavor goes beyond this report. Hehas opened several new C/R sources, plus providing some other off-the-record items. SeeCase A-6 and Case B-4. Like others who dig deep for data, Blann has experiencedanonymous phone threats. Speaking of the pilot whose private plane made an emergencylanding in a field near Ft. Hood's security corridor, I am reminded of the Blue Beret whotold me in Florida in 1979, that while he was serving as a guard on a plane with secretcargo they flew into a strip that went into a hillside that unfolded - trees and all. 'Just likefantasy-land,' he said. See Case A-3, Status Report II. [Reprinted in future Earthfiles.] In summary, Blann's report - like in Case B-2 of this paper - leaves open severalpossibilities for an answer to mysterious helicopter involvement: 1) to maintain militaryreadiness for alien UFO intrusive activity and/or crashes; 2) to maintain security escort forsecret saucer-like craft developed by the U. S.; 3) to maintain clandestine contact withalien forces established by agreement or by coercion. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Case A-10 January 1947 UFO Crash in Southern Arizona? Papago Indian Reservation west of Tucson, Arizona. WH of Yucca Valley, California, served in U. S. Navy during WWII, is married, retiredafter 31 years of government service. Researcher Bill Hamilton of Phoenix, Arizona, a computer programmer, knew WH as afirsthand source and arranged for me to reach him by phone in 1980 to discuss hisexperience of running head-on into a full scale military retrieval operation. This incident ofJanuary 1947 predates Ken Arnold's famous sighting by six months and occurred on thePapagos Indian Reservation in southern Arizona. According to WH, he was on Navy leave (being reassigned at the time), with a friend, CC,just out of the Army. they were on a jeep scouting trip looking for desert property forhomesteading. It was growing dusk about 5 p.m. and they were traveling over a dirt trailwhen they encountered Air Force personnel armed with carbines. Challenged by a SecondLt., they were asked for identification and reasons for being in the area. While parked forinterrogation, WH could see other military personnel were about a quarter of a mile awaygrouped around an object that appeared to be half sunk in the sand. A disc-shaped objectwith a dome on top was about 30 feet in diameter and 18 feet high. On its outer edge weretwo rings which seemed to have windows between. 'The military probably had just arrived,' commented WH. 'There was no evidence of anencampment of any heavy equipment, at least in view from the trail.' Leonard Stringfield Comment: WH's description of the object seems to rule out anexperimental missile and if it were alien, one can only wonder how far back in time themilitary had been involved in UFO retrieval operations?\" Continued in Part 6 - Alien in U.
