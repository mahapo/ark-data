[ Editor's Note: In the mid-1990s, I was approached by former Las Cruces, New MexicoState Representative, Andrew Kissner. He told me about his official research into UFOcrashes and retrievals in New Mexico, and his off-the-record conversations with militaryand intelligence operatives from White Sands Missile Range, the Naval Research Lab andother government agencies. Rep. Kissner had assembled many old newspaper articles andgovernment documents leaked to him.Former Rep. Kissner asserted that in the late 1940s to early 1950s, there was an Americangovernment policy to shoot down unidentified aerial discs. But the discs retaliated. Manyof our pilots died, which forced an end to our \"shoot down\" policy. ]Part 1Prologue By J. Andrew Kissner, August 1995 In a democracy, the people must be aware of and learn fundamental truth. Without thisknowledge, others are empowered to make decisions for the people secretly with littleregard to the checks and balances of constitutional government. It is evident that mostUnited States decision makers involved with this phenomenon have not been elected topublic office. \"The difficulty with many career officials in the government is that they regardthemselves as the men who really make policy and run the government. They look"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"upon the elected officials as just temporary occupants. Every President has beenfaced with this problem ... \"The civil servant, the general or admiral, the foreign service officer, has noauthority to make policy. They act only as servants of the government, andtherefore, they must remain in line with the government policy that is establishedby those who have been chosen by the people to set that policy.\" - U.

I also had manyoff-the-record conversations with military and intelligence operatives from White SandsMissile Range, the Naval Research Lab and other government agencies. This bookexamines aspects of the physical environment surrounding the \"Roswell Incident\" and the\"Great Flying Disc Scare of 1947.\" It is not fiction, although after reviewing it, the readermight want to think it is. All events mentioned here are footnoted and the reader isencouraged to examine the original source material. Much of it is reprinted in more or lesschronological order throughout the work. Hopefully, the presentation allows the reader todraw his or her own conclusion about the spring, summer and fall of 1947. It also providesa context to understand not only the \"Roswell Incident,\" but also flying discs in general, U.S. space and science policy over the past half century, as well as aspects of U. S. nationalsecurity affairs since 1947. Throughout the book, reference is made to members of 'Operation Majestic-Twelve'(MAJIC-12; MJ-12) purportedly created by Executive Order of President Truman onSeptember 24, 1947. The original copy of the document was provided to nuclear physicist,UFO researcher and author, Stanton Friedman, on a roll of unexposed black and white,35mm film in 1984. It was packaged in an envelop postmarked Albuquerque, NewMexico. The document was first published in 1986. Former Director of Central Intelligence, Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, is referred to asMJ-1 in the MJ-12 document. When a member of this working group is mentioned in thisbook's text, an MJ number immediately follows the name to remind the reader of thatindividual's purported involvement with the MJ-12 group. The reference number for theindividual is derived from the order in which they were mentioned in the MJ-12 document.It is not necessarily indicative of that member's relative importance or position within\"Operation Majestic-Twelve.\" Research conducted for this book project tends to confirm that the MJ-12 document isauthentic. After reading Peculiar Phenomenon, you too might understand why. If thedocument is not authentic, the author of the forgery enjoyed access to then-classifiedinformation (1984) as he or she was crafting it. The November 18, 1952, \"Briefing Paperfor President-Elect Eisenhower is copied here so the reader can analyze it before goingfurther into PECULIAR PHENOMENON.

Photograph courtesy congressional office of Steven Schiff.This manuscript was provided as public input into the GAO review of the \"RoswellIncident,\" a review requested by Cong. Schiff. Following over two years of inquiry, theGAO's final report was published on July 28, 1995. The 20-page document is included asAppendix XI of this book. July 28, 1995, release of U. S. General Accounting Office (GAO) report to New MexicoCong. Steven Schiff about the GAO \"Results of a Search for Records Concerning the 1947 Crash NearRoswell, New Mexico. On the morning of July 3, 1947, Corona ranch manager William W. (\"Mac\") Brazeldiscovered what he considered to be a \"flying disc\" in one of his sheep pastures 75 milesnorthwest of Roswell and 25 miles north northeast of Carrizozo, New Mexico. Anintelligence officer from the Army Air Forces 509th Bomb Group, Major Jesse Marcel,based at Walker Army Air Field, Roswell, New Mexico, reported that he had seen a\"crashed flying disc\" on July 6, a the Brazel ranch. The next day, the local Roswellnewspaper reported that the U. S. Army's 509th Bomb Group had recovered a crashedflying disc. Immediately afterward, on the afternoon of July 7, General Ramey,Commander of the 8th Air Force, the 509th's headquarters group, reported that a highaltitude weather balloon had been misidentified as a flying disc by its personnel stationedat Roswell. This is where the official explanation of the event stood for 47 years: thatnothing much happened, just crash debris from a high altitude weather balloon. Then on September 8, 1994, the U. S. Air Force Public Affairs Office re-explained\"Roswell.\" The Air Force re-examined what they termed to be their own \"weather ballooncover story.\" According to the Air Force, it was not a weather balloon after all. After 47years of official denial, the event became the crash of a TOP SECRET Project Mogul highaltitude research balloon testing an Atomic Energy Commission payload to acousticallydetect Russian nuclear experiments. (See Appendix II and Appendix III) The Air Force's re-explanation was provided to the public and to Congressman Schiff 120days after this author interviewed eyewitnesses in the Carrizozo area of central NewMexico who had experienced a cover-up of another incident at the same time in July 1947."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"But their event was approximately 25 miles south of the purported flying disc crash site.The 48-year-old story had to change to justify the declared \"military emergency\" inCarrizozo, New Mexico, during the week of July 13, 1947. A project classified TOPSECRET was necessary to justify local military, AEC and FBI actions and orders given bymilitary officers to civilians at the scene of this cover-up.
