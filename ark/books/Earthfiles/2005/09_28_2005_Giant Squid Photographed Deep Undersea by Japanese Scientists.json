Nobody knew what they looked likein the wild.We only saw them dead.\" - Richard Ellis, Author, Monsters of the Sea Ogasawara-Gunto Islands, Japan, are 600 miles south of Tokyo.September 28, 2005 Ogasawara Islands, Japan - Six hundred miles south of Tokyo offislands the Japanese call Ogasawara (Bonin Islands), two Japanese scientists used a roboticcamera to capture the first series of photos ever taken of a living, feeding giant squid in thewild, three thousand feet down in ocean waters. Images from their camera and detailsabout the exploration by Tsunemi Kubodera and Kyoichi Mori were reported in theSeptember 27, 2005, Proceedings of the Royal Society B (biological sciences), London,the oldest scientific organization in the world.The live giant squid (Architeuthis), measuring roughly 25 feet (8 meters) long, attacked abaited fishing line off the Ogasawara Islands on September 30, 2004.Eight-meter-long (nearly 26 feet) giant squid (Architeuthis) attacksa baited fishing line off the Ogasawara Islands, Japan.

When thecreature took the bait, the Japanese researchers could see the squid's long tentacles coilinto a ball around the food, similar to the way a large snake such as a python wraps itsbody around prey to crush them. The squid fought off the hook for more than four hoursand eventually freed itself, leaving behind an 18-foot-long white tentacle pictured in thelower right image above. Giant squid have eight short arms and two long tentacles, but it isnot known which tentacle broke off. The scientists reported in the British journal that thegiant squid \"appears to be a much more active predator than previously suspected, usingits elongate feeding tentacles to strike and tangle prey.\"Websites:National Geographic: http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/09/0927_050927_giant_squid.htmlGiant Squid History: http://www.the-emperor.org/wiki/giant_squid/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
