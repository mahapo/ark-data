It was moving slowly toward the South. Theobject was about 250 to 300 feet in diameter.At 2:45 p.m. CST, at about 14,000 feet, Mantell radioed to the base that hehad the object in sight. At 15,000 feet, Mantell reported: \"The object isdirectly ahead of me and above me now, moving at about half my speed.\"A half hour later Mantell radioed: \"It appears to be a metallic object orpossible reflections of sun from a metallic object, and it is of tremendous size.I'm still climbing; the object is above and ahead of me moving at my speed orfaster. I'm trying to close in for a better look.\"Just after 5.00 pm, CST, on a farm near Franklin, Kentucky, the remains ofMantell's F-51 were found scattered over half a mile. Mantell's shattered bodywas found inside the cockpit and his watch had stopped at 3:18 p.m. It isbelieved that he died from lack of oxygen at about 25,000 feet. The plane hadcontinued to climb to 30,000 feet, but then leveled out before going into ahigh-speed dive.The microfilm copy of the investigation was mysteriously damaged and noSkyhook balloon launches could be found to coincide with the incident. ]Based on his alleged classified USAF insider's knowledge, Richard Miller told Steve Jonesthat Mantell's plane did not crash, but looked like it had been dropped straight down to theground hard enough to break the frame. Adding to the mystery, a large light was seen byGodman personnel in the same approximate position of the large disc object seen earlier.The aluminum metal of Mantell's plane had hundreds of tiny holes as if the aircraft hadbeen exposed to an energy intense and compartmentalized enough to cause metalevaporation in a dot matrix.Miller also told Steve Jones that he had received information from an intelligence sourcethat there had been a UFO crash out in the Utah dry lakebed in the late spring of 1953 andthat it was related to the Kingman, Arizona crash which allegedly occurred on May 20,1953. Miller focused on the DRES facility which he thought was used for covert activitybeyond its original agricultural mission."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Steve Jones first visited the DRES facility in 1996.July 17, 2005 photograph © by Linda Moulton Howe.Miller showed Steve the two dozen high altitude photographs and the 1980 to 1983 logbooks with entries by military, intelligence, and NASA personnel. Steve Jones wasprovoked enough to make his own first research trip to the DRES facility in 1996.In the spring of 2005, Steve e-mailed me a summary of his discoveries and his hypothesisthat Something strange crashed before June 11, 1953, in the dry lake bed three miles fromthe DRES buildings. He hypothesized that the crashed vehicle was so big it could not betransported and was buried. We agreed to visit the site together on July 16 to 17, 2005.Close-up of June 11, 1953, U.
