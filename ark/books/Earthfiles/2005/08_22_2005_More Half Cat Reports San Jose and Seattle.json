Photograph© 2005 by Thomas G. Holford. August 22, 2005 San Jose, California - On August 16, 2005, I received the followingemail from Thomas G. Holford, a San Jose, California resident:\"Linda:Today, August 16, 2005, about 4:00 PM, I was walking in a residentialneighborhood in south San Jose, California, when I noticed the remains of anorange cat, in two pieces, on the front lawn of a home.I was on my way to a business meeting, but stopped long enough to snap somepictures. Attached are digital photos of the scene.On my way to the meeting, I stopped at an animal clinic and reported theincident to the staff, and they indicated that they would call animalcontrol. Ten minutes later, I phoned the clinic and suggested that theymight call the police and have the police secure the area. The clinicreported that they had called animal control, and that animal control was ontheir way to the site.In my quick observation of the carcass, I did not observe any blood, whichsuggested that the carcass may have been dropped there after the cat hadbeenkilled. Also, the fur of the cat seems to have been rather mussed up and\"ungroomed\".This incident is particularly significant since San Jose had been thelocation of cat mutilations several years back. [ See 100399 Earthfiles. ]As a probably unrelated, but possibly bizarre sidelight to this incident,the house on whose front yard the cat carcass was found was the site of asuicide several years ago. One might speculate that cultists of some sortwere somehow linking the cat death to a known \"death house.\" But this maybe giving cultists to much credit for record keeping and planning.Regards,To m H o l f o r d"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"San Jose, CAI talked with the veterinarian's office, which had no information about further AnimalControl follow-up on the cat's body.

August 16, 2005, Photographs Takenby Tom Holford, in South San Jose, CaliforniaThree days before the San Jose, California, discovery, the Federal Way Police and KingCounty Animal control in Seattle, Washington, confirmed they have in their recent animalmutilation files three cats and one dog since May 2005, bringing the total in the greaterSeattle/Oak Harbor/Anacortes/Burlington/Mt. Vernon region to at least fourteen. The mostrecent were two cat victims in August."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Seattle, WashingtonAug 13, 2005 \"Pet owners warned of mutilationsFederal Way Police and King County Animal Control are putting the word out to petowners to keep their critters safe following a rash of mutilations.Four incidents have been reported since May two in August.

Oak Harbor is a town of about 19,000 people, of which 6,000work for the Whidbey Island Naval Air Station and Ault Field. WhidbeyIsland is the longest island in the continental United States and is surroundedby the waters of Puget Sound. By car, Oak Harbor is about 1.5 hours north ofSeattle and two hours south of Vancouver, British Columbia.I talked with Oak Harbor's Animal Control Officer, Terry Sampson, this weekwho confirmed his office has seven half cat cases. There were three more thispast weekend in Anacortes and several more in Burlington, Mt. Vernon andSeattle. He said that he and the other city animal control officers areconvinced the culprits are coyotes.But when I talked to one Oak Harbor resident who found only the upper halfof her cat, she rejected the coyote explanation. She did not want to commentfor radio, but she told me where her half cat laid in the grass was 'quite tidy.'She compared the cat's upper half to a 'glove puppet,' meaning it resembled achild's puppet toy that is empty inside and fits over a hand.\"More Information:For other Earthfiles reports about cat mutilations, see Earthfiles Archives:· 07/28/2005 -- Feedback on Half Cat Mystery· 07/14/2005 -- More Half Cat Mutilations in Seattle, Washington Region· 09/12/2003 -- More Domestic Cat Mutilations - Again in Bothell, Washington· 07/01/2003 -- 40 Small Animal Mutilations in Denver and 11 in Salt Lake City· 11/16/2002 -- More Cat and Cow Mutilations: Colorado, Utah and Missouri· 05/31/2002 -- Bloodless Cat Mutilations in Bellingham, Washington· 10/20/2001 -- Dozen Mutilated Cats Found in San Diego, California· 09/08/2001 -- 23 \"Half Cat\" and 2 Deer Mutilations Since March: Austin, TexasLaw Enforcement· 08/12/2001 -- Unusual Cat Deaths in Navarre, Florida and Austin, Texas· 11/18/1999 -- Short Environmental Updates· 11/07/1999 -- Environmental Updates and Calf Fetus Shocks Los Brazos, NewMexico· 11/05/1999 -- Reward Offered As Cat Mutilations Continue in Toronto, Canada· 10/10/1999 -- More Cat Mutilation Reports from Ft.
