C. - While the world has a new consciousness aboutthe danger of tsunamis in the oceans and the need for better warning systems, above us inthe atmosphere, another danger increases and warnings grow more loudly than ever. Thatdanger is the ever-increasing amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasessurrounding our planet and making it warmer. Yet, the warnings seem to be ignored by theUnited States, Australia, China, India and Brazil.In the last week of January, scientists at Oxford University in England announced thattheir climate modeling experiment indicates that greenhouse gas emissions could causeglobal temperatures to rise by as much as 11 degrees Celsius ( 20 degrees Fahrenheit ) bythe end of this century. That would double previous computer model estimates abouttemperature rise as atmospheric CO2 increases. The Oxford University experiment usesClimateprediction.net, which was launched in 2003 to utilize as many individual PCcomputers as possible around the world to increase analysis power to crunch all thesatellite and other data.Dr. Myles Allen in Britain's Meteorological Office said about the latestClimateprediction.net analysis, \"The danger zone is not something we are going to reach inthe middle of this century. We are in it now.\"This U.K. warning came just before the Kyoto Protocol to the United NationsFramework Convention on Climate Change is supposed to go into effect on February16, 2005. The treaty needed ratification by 55 industrialized countries, but five of thebiggest polluters and potential polluters - the United States, Australia, China, India andBrazil have refused to sign. Finally on October 22, 2004, Russian President Vladimir Putinsigned up as the 55th industrialized nation. According to the treaty, ratifying nations aresupposed to start limiting greenhouse gas emissions in 2008.But the United States accounts for nearly 40% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions. Ifit does not lead the effort to reduce industrial and automobile carbon dioxide emissions,what practical hope is there that global warming can be slowed?This week, that question provoked the U.K.'s Environmental Minister to ask the UnitedStates to join Great Britain in trying to limit CO2 emissions. At the same time this week,three think tank institutes released yet another proposal to the United States, Australia,China, India and Brazil. This new \"Recommendations of the International Climate ChangeTaskforce\" has been lead by British Member of Parliament, Stephen Byers, the U.K.'sInstitute for Public Policy Research, and England's Prime Minister Tony Blair.Contributing to the taskforce recommendations is the Australian Institute; and Center forAmerican Progress in Washington, D.C. The Center has existed for only about eighteenmonths. Its president and CEO is John Podesta, former Chief of Staff for the Bill Clintonadministration.Mr. Podesta has apparently reached out to Maine's U.S. Senator, Olympia Snow, to ask herto personally brief the White House on the Climate Change Taskforce's goal: \"to preventglobal average temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degreesFahrenheit) above the pre-industrial level.\" Three Technology Changes Could Slow Down CO2EmissionsThe Climate Change Taskforce recommends three technological changes that could beadopted by all industrial nations to start slowing CO2 build-up. Those three are:1) Getting the world to use more efficient cars, trucks and planes.2) Subsidizing farmers to grow more \"bio-fuel energy production crops\" such as canola,also known as oilseed rape. Canola oil can be transformed into gas for vehicles.3) Building more IGCC coal plants, (\"integrated gasification combined cycles\"). Thosehave the best chance to capture carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases so the gasesare not released to the atmosphere.These and a longer list of CO2 restriction measures (See More Information below) will bepresented by Tony Blair in June when England hosts the G8 conference. But none of itmeans anything if the United States does not aggressively work at reducing greenhouseemissions. This week I asked Ana Unruh Cohen, Associate Director for EnvironmentalPolicy at John Podesta's newly formed Center for American Progress, how the Taskforceplanned to approach the Bush Administration."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Interview:Ana Unruh Cohen, Ph.D., Associate Director for Environmental Policy, Center forAmerican Progress, Washington, D. C.: \"We felt that politically the Bush Administrationmight feel more comfortable working within the auspices of the G8 and so the idea is toform a small working group of the G8 countries, the major economies of the world, andinvite in to work on this climate group India, China, Brazil and possibly some otherdeveloping world economies.HAVE YOU GOTTEN ANY SIGNAL FROM THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION THATTHEY WOULD BE WILLING TO TRY TO JOIN IN THIS EFFORT TO LIMIT CO2?The Bush Administration has not made any comments as far as I know about the report.We think some of the technology partnerships they might be interested in. They'veobviously been supportive of clean coal research and development here in the U. S.I'm sure Tony Blair as he prepares for the G8 which is going to happen this June and earlyJuly in Scotland will be talking with the Bush Admin. to help lay the groundwork for someof these recommendations to possibly be undertaken at the G8.DOES AMERICAN PROGRESS SUBMIT THIS 'MEETING THE CLIMATECHALLENGE' RECOMMENDATION LIST TO ANY PARTICULAR PERSON IN THEADMINISTRATION?I believe Sen. Snow has plans to brief the White House on the recommendations. We'vealso, in conjunction with Sen. Snow's office, sent the report and recommendations to theSenate and House of Representatives. Some of the recommendations are already legislation exists which could implement some of the recommendations. So we hope thereport will help facilitate that.In areas where there is not current legislation along the same line, hopefully we mightinspire senators and members of Congress to take up that challenge. Is It Too Late For CO2 Cutback to Slow Global Warming?WHAT IF IT IS TOO LATE? WHAT IF THE CO2 BUILD UP IS SLIGHTLY OUT OFCONTROL AND WILL GET WORSE?I think the task force members already recognize that we are already seeing impacts ofclimate change. They felt in setting the 2 degrees Celsius target that above that the impactscould become significantly more serious and the risk of abrupt climate change increases.So, I think they were trying to stay positive. I think the over arching message of the reportis that climate change is a serious issue. We need to take action now. But there are actionswe can take that will address the problem and are economically viable.WELL, WE'RE AT 380 PPM PER VOLUME CO2 IN THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERERIGHT NOW.That's right.AND IT IS EXPECTED TO KEEP INCREASING IN FACT, THERE IS EVIDENCETHAT IT HAS BEEN EXPONENTIALLY INCREASING, OR ON A TREND TOEXPONENTIAL INCREASE. THAT MEANS IN THE NEXT 20 YEARS, THERE IS ADISTINCT POSSIBILITY THAT THE CO2 COULD INTERACT WITH THE EARTH'SCLIMATE IN A WAY THAT COULD TRIGGER ABRUPT CLIMATE CHANGE EITHER TOWARD GLACIATING OR SOMETHING ELSE.There is a real possibility that we can limit the human contribution to greenhouse gases inthe atmosphere and we'll have to keep our fingers crossed that we haven't done too littletoo late. But I think that inaction is not an option, even in the face of uncertainties aboutwhat we've already put into the atmosphere.WHICH COMES BACK FULL CIRCLE ABOUT WHY THE UNITED STATES IS NOTLEADING IN THE EFFORT TO TRY TO CONTROL AND REDUCE CO2 EMISSIONS?Yeah ideally, America would be leading the charge. The fact of the matter is that we aren't.I think opinions are changing in America. I think people are realizing it is a serious problemthat will have definite impacts in America, if we're not having them already. I mean, thesevere droughts in the West; breaking the tornado record in 2004; having four hurricaneshit Florida in the space of 6 weeks; all of these things are making your average American"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"think about the impact of climate change. Maybe they will come around to the idea thatwe do have some influence on the planet and we should be taking precautions.\" Large Companies Already Saving Money By Cutting BackCO2After February 16 when the Kyoto Protocol goes into effect even without the UnitedStates, Australia, China, India and Brazil American companies that have internationalsubsidiaries will be under pressure to reduce greenhouse emissions. Already majorcompanies such as British Petroleum, Alcoa, and 3M have begun reducing CO 2 from theirindustries. What they found was that the new efficiency saved them money. The ClimateChange Taskforce hopes more profits from reducing greenhouse pollution will lead to aglobal political movement that might change the planet's warming, stormy future. 1000 Years of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide HistoryPieter Tans, Ph.D.: \"The plot shows the last 1000 years of atmospheric CO2 history as measuredin air bubbles in ice cores and since 1958 directly in the atmosphere.\" Graphic © 2004 by Pieter Tans.More Information:Center for American Progress Summary \"January 25, 2005Meeting the Climate Challenge Recommendations of the International Climate Change Taskforce There can be few greater challenges in the twenty-first century than addressing thethreat of climate change. Left unmitigated, the impacts are expected to bedevastating. Urgent action is needed. As a global problem, it requires globalsolutions. In this report, a high level taskforce, brought together from across theglobe by three of the world's leading think tanks, set out their conclusions on how tomove forward. The recommendations of the International Climate Change Taskforceare a blueprint for action and offer a strong foundation for meeting the climatechallenge. 1.A long-term objective be established to prevent global average temperature fromrising more than 2°C (3.6°F) above the pre-industrial level, to limit the extent andmagnitude of climate-change impacts. 2.A global framework be adopted that builds on the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol,and enables all countries to be part of concerted action on climate change at theglobal level in the post-2012 period, on the basis of equity and common butdifferentiated responsibilities. 3."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"G8 governments establish national renewable portfolio standards to generate at least25% of electricity from renewable energy sources by 2025, with higher targetsneeded for some G8 governments. 4.G8 governments increase their spending on research, development, anddemonstration of advanced technologies for energy-efficient and low- andzero-carbon energy supply by two-fold or more by 2010, at the same time asadopting near-term strategies for the large-scale deployment of existing low- andno-carbon technologies. 5.The G8 and other major economies, including from the developing world, form aG8+ Climate Group, to pursue technology agreements and related initiatives thatwill lead to large emissions reductions. 6.The G8+ Climate Group agree to shift their agricultural subsidies from food crops tobiofuels, especially those derived from cellulosic materials, while implementingappropriate safeguards to ensure sustainable farming methods are encouraged,culturally and ecologically sensitive land preserved, and biodiversity protected. 7.All developed countries introduce national mandatory cap-and-trade systems forcarbon emissions, and construct them to allow for their future integration into asingle global market. 8.Governments remove barriers to and increase investment in renewable energy andenergy efficient technologies and practices through such measures as the phase-outof fossil fuel subsidies and requiring Export Credit Agencies and MultilateralDevelopment Banks to adopt minimum efficiency or carbon intensity standards forprojects they support. 9.Developed countries honour existing commitments to provide greater financial andtechnical assistance to help vulnerable countries adapt to climate change, includingthe commitments made at the seventh conference of the parties to the UNFCCC in2001, and pursue the establishment of an international compensation fund to supportdisaster mitigation and preparedness. 10.Governments committed to action on climate change raise public awareness of theproblem and build public support for climate policies by pledging to providesubstantial long-term investment in effective climate communication activities.\" Previous Earthfiles.com Reports About Global Warming (SeeArchive):· 12/31/2004 -- Abrupt Climate Change Occurred Worldwide 5,200 Years Ago· 11/02/2004 -- North Pole Summers Without Ice?· 10/15/2004 -- Ever-Increasing Carbon Dioxide Build-Up in Atmosphere Since 1958· 10/13/2004 -- Rapid Increase of Greenhouse Carbon Dioxide in 2002-2003· 08/27/2004 -- Global Warming Impact On Birds - More Extinctions Expected· 08/14/2004 -- Oceans Are Absorbing A Lot of CO2.
