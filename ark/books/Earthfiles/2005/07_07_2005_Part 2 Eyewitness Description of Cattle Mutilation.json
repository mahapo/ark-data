They run the tractor beam down on them and bring the animals up into theship. They had this big, circular table that had drains, places to drain fluids. They woulddrain the blood out of it and mix it with a powder, stir it up in like a blender and they'ddrink it. Just reminded me of like a bunch of sailors that just found an island to get freshmeat. They were just using the protein to mix with their powder for food. They didn't haveany teeth or chewing apparatus. It was more of a sucking-type thing.WHEN THEY MIXED THIS UP, DID THEY EXPLAIN WHAT THE POWDER WAS?No, it looked and smelled just about like the froth you get off of a hamburger when youcook it, you know? Like the spongy stuff that you cook that comes out of hamburger. Itlooked and smelled just like that. And that's probably what it was. The powder might havebeen some kind of additive to it.HOW DID THEY GET THE COW OUT OF THE BEAM OF LIGHT AND WHERE DIDTHEY PUT THE COW?They brought the cow in from up above. I'm not exactly sure how it came in from upabove. It just sort of levitated down to the table where they would do certain things withcertain machine-type things that would suck the blood out. Then what did not come outthrough the machines would drain out into the side, like a waste drain. They saved thatblood, too. They cut out certain parts of the brain and internal organs and mixed that up indifferent formulas just using it for food.CAN YOU SEE THE COW STRUGGLING OR MOVING IN ANY WAY IN THELIGHT?No. It was frozen (paralyzed), limp with all four legs touching. They (beings) proceeded totake these machines and go into different areas of the body and cut them and extract theblood out. What little blood that did drain out was cleaned up. It looked like it might havebeen a heifer. It was probably about 3 or 4 years old. It was reddish with white spots.YOU'RE WATCHING HOW MANY BEINGS WORK ON THIS COW?Two of them and three are waiting with the powder.IS THE BEING WITH THE SNAKE SKIN AND THE HOODED ROBE STANDINGTHERE WATCHING?Yeah, he's behind me at this time. I turned around and they stood behind while I watchedwhat they did with the cow. Telepathic Communications About Heifer Blood As Food"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"TELEPATHICALLY, ARE YOU GETTING COMMUNICATION FROM THE TALLBEING OR ANY OF THE BEINGS IN THE ROOM ABOUT WHAT THEY AREDOING?Everybody! It was like everybody was talking at one time, like dinner was served. He(reptilian being) kept telling me, 'You wanted to know. Here it is.' He was kind of like, 'Canyou understand this?' I didn't say much. I just kept thinking like it was the same thing wedo when we eat, which was pretty normal.DO YOU SEE ON THE ROUND TABLE THIS 600 TO 800 POUND HEIFER LAYINGTHERE AFTER THEY HAD USED THEIR EQUIPMENT WITH EXCISIONS FROMHER BODY?There were parts of the cow that were missing. One of the main things they did wassomething around the mouth. I wasn't completely sure what they did, but it might havebeen like cutting the tongue area or something and just sort of like vacuuming all the bloodout. Then it would go down the tube and they warmed it up. I could see it was beingheated up in some kind of heat exchanger type thing and they added this powder to it inlike a blender. Then they would drink it, using a straw type, half-inch (diameter) straws.DID YOU HAVE A SENSE, OR DID YOU ASK, OR DID THEY VOLUNTEERCOMMUNICATION ABOUT HOW LONG THEY HAD BEEN COMING TO THEEARTH TAKING BLOOD FROM ANIMALS AND USING IT FOR FOOD?No. I didn't ask how long they were doing it. I just asked what was causing all these animalmutilations and that's the basis of what got me aboard. That was it. Then they proceeded toshow me around the place and show me different things. ET Communication and Propulsion in SpaceThey showed me the communication banks and showed me how they communicate withothers back home through thought processes being amplified out across (space)instantaneously. They compared it with electrostatic fields. They said something aboutchanges in electrostatic fields was immediate. There is no wave action which is not likeradio waves. Radio waves are real slow and they don't use radio waves.WHAT DID THEY SAY ABOUT THE CRAFT PROPULSION SYSTEM AND HOWTHEY TRAVELED?They said they are using gravity waves and they create gravity waves by having twoelectrostatic fields turning against each other. That creates a standing gravity wave andthey ride the resonance of the standing wave and it just takes away the inertia and doesn'ttake much energy at all to far surpass the speed of light. Rapid Motion Without InertiaThey showed me how the craft moved without the beings inside it feeling any motionwhen they moved. They would go back and forth. You could see the skyline of themountains in the Denver area, I guess it would be. It seemed like we went several hundredmiles in seconds, but you wouldn't feel any inertia. I thought I was gone for like 15 minutesor so, but the person I was with said I was gone for two hours.DO YOU HAVE ANY RECALL HOW YOU GOT OUT OF THE SHIP BACK TO YOURMEDITATION STATE?I was just sent back down the tube (of light) and I was standing up and watched the craftgo take off. Silver Disc With Spinning SurfaceCOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE CRAFT A BIT MORE?I'd say it was maybe 30 meters in diameter, almost like a standard flying saucer. 10 to 12meters high and 30 meters in diameter.YOU MEAN IN DIAMETER?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Ye s .SO 30 METERS IN DIAMETER AND MAYBE 12 DIAMETERS THICK?About 100 feet in diameter by 15 to 25 feet thick.WHAT WAS THE COLOR?Silver, shimmering silver. It was like the outside was in constant motion.SO IT WAS SPINNING ON THE OUTSIDE?It was floating, shimmering. I don't know if it was spinning literally, but there was aspinning effect on the skin of the craft.COULD YOU SEE ANY MARKINGS ON THE DISK?No, you could see the main darkened window area where they were looking out about halfway up the top part. Underneath was a place where the lights came out. Returned Heifer by Beam Technology to GroundDID THEY SHOW YOU AN IMAGE IN YOUR MIND OF THEM PUTTING THE COWBACK DOWN IN THE BEAM?Yeah, when I asked what they did with the animals after (taking blood and tissues), I justsort of got a telepathic flash of the light beam taking them back down and dropping themfrom about ten to twelve feet above the ground. I just thought they would drop them out(of the craft) and the animals would have damage from falling from huge heights. but Iguess in that ten to twelve feet, they don't have that much damage.DID YOU ASK THEM SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHY THEY CONCENTRATED ONCATTLE?I didn't ask them, but it's something that the amount of blood in the size of the animal wasmore efficient. There was plenty of blood (in cows) with the right kind of protein. Different ETs, Different Mutilation Agendas?I WONDER THEN WHY THERE ARE SO MANY CAT AND DOG MUTILATIONS ASWELL?Those may be different beings. They did mention others. I asked them what other kind ofbeings were doing here. They told me to watch out for the small yellow ones. They kind ofsaid, or I got the sense that everybody is not like them. They didn't operate on me (in anabduction).DID THEY SHOW YOU A PICTURE IN YOUR MIND WHEN THEY SAID, 'SMALLYELLOW ONES'? CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT THAT IS?I hate to say it but it was more like Chinese person almost like an automaton, mindless,soulless type being that didn't care about life.WHY WERE THEY HERE?They didn't say why. They just said watch out for them. They didn't specifically say theywere from outer space or here already just that there were different kinds of beings. Someare good and some are bad, just like there are all different kinds of humans. That's whatthey communicated to me.ANYTHING ELSE YOU WOULD WANT THE EARTHFILES AUDIENCE TO KNOW?When people are having a difficult time believing that things are happening, just to know Ididn't believe it until it happened to me. As soon as it happens to you, you just can'tconvince anyone else. It's like you are on the other side of the fence immediately. It puts astrain on you because you're telling what happened to you, but for people because it didn'thappen to them, they don't think it exists.\"More Information:"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"For more information about the animal mutilation and non-human entity phenomena,please see books An Alien Harvest and Glimpses of Other Realities, Volumes I and IIlisted in Earthfiles Shop.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
