Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. Bi g Spri ng, Texas northeast of Midl and, al l egedly 50 mil es fromsecret Army Intelligence training base and 16 acre Air Force 'facility' in 1968. Continued: CASE B-2: 1968, U. S. Army Intelligence School, Near Big Spring, Texas December 14, 1980, letter from Larry W.: 'He described it as consisting of a largemetal building or warehouse, one or two small guard houses, and a nearby concretehelicopter landing pad. No airstrip or runways were visible in the immediate vicinity.The warehouse itself was surrounded by an 8-foot chain-link fence which wastopped off with rolled barbed wire. The perimeter of the entire site, including padand buildings, was enclosed in a double '10-foot-high, barbed-wire-topped, cyclonefence.' Dogs trotted in the 5-foot corridor separating the two fences. Guard towerswith lights stood at each corner of the compound. DR stated that on several occasions, he and others had clandestinely observedunusual activity at the Air Force site. (He felt that such blatant security oftenattracts unwanted attention.) He cited two specific reasons why he was personallyconvinced that the base was operated by the Air Force. First, 'no uniformed memberof any other branch of the service was ever seen gaining access to the mainbuilding.' Second, 'only blue, officially-marked Air Force vehicles ever entered orleft the compound.' DR said that the feature which struck him as most unusual aboutthe site were conspicuous 'stacks of large tires.' He explained that while large flat-bed tractor trucks were often seen entering thewarehouse, none (to his knowledge) ever left! He felt that the tires were somehow'left over from the disassembly of the trucks.' DR certainly did not know what theywere involved in. He did, however, believe that the Air Force had 'some sort oflarge, underground working shop set up.' "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"DR stated that as the months progressed, it became increasingly obvious that 'specialpreparations' were being made at both the Army school and the Air Force site.Security was tightened even further. Written orders were issued not to observe, talkabout, or go near the Air Force compound. He went on to state that while themajority of his class accepted these orders, some could not. One group in particular,led by a soldier of 'Italian descent,' decided to find out exactly 'what all the fuss wasabout.' Unfortunately, DR said this group of 'five or six' individuals never achieved theirgoal. They were caught wearing Air Force fatigues trying to enter the compound.They were not heard from again for 'about a month.' All but one was eventuallyreturned to the Army Intelligence School. In the interim, quite a shake-up had occurred at the school. Some students weretransferred out and the Commanding Officer had been replaced. The new C. O.issued strict orders not to discuss past events regarding the Air Force facility. DRsaid that the new C. O. stressed that further security breaches would not betolerated. (Was this one tolerated?) No one was allowed to question any of thereturning class members who had 'gone down the road.' Incredibly, DR said that no one wanted to! He remembered that of the five or sixwho had tried to find out what was going on, all but one returned. (No one everfound out what happened to the missing individual.) The others, however, had all'undergone extensive brain-washing techniques,' according to DR. Indeed, DR was convinced that their 'psychological profiles' had actually beensomehow altered. He told me that 'they really did not want to remember whathappened.' They kept to themselves as a group and were the subject of manyrumors. (He recalled that one of these rumors centered around the sudden, rapidgraying of one individual's hair!) This, to say the least, was an interesting and highly peculiar accounting thus far. Imust admit that while DR certainly did not appear to be a 'weirdo,' his story wasincredible. I must also point out that in the almost full semester that I had workedwith him, he always impressed me as being serious, mature and conscientious. Hissincerity in relating the chain of events impressed me so much, in fact, that later inthe evening I decided to write down a few pertinent notes. I verified these notes thenest day. DR was kind enough to add some supplemental sketches at that time. Healways responded directly to my questions, although he did choose his wordscarefully. He definitely did not appear to be making up anything! Specifically, I feelthat in addition to its somewhat sinister portent, this might be why his account hasremained in my memory all these years. DR continued on into the 'heart' of his story. He stated that approximately two orthree months after the security breach, all Army personnel in and around the schoolwere restricted to their quarters. Near dusk and after dinner, DR said that hereturned to the barracks to find that 'all of the windows had been blackened out byan opaque material.' Armed Air Force guards now appeared and ushered him and allother Army personnel into their respective barracks. They remained with loadedweapons to 'prevent us from going outside,' DR said. DR also recalled that 'the menwho had gone down the road earlier, just sat in the corner like zombies.' Theirenthusiasm had by now totally disappeared. DR and a few others decided that 'they had had enough.' They all agreed to risk anattempt at looking outside. They felt that it all might 'just be worth it,' even in thereceding light of dusk. They gained access to a small crawl space in the attic abovetheir bunks. Using a large screwdriver, they succeeded in 'poling a hole through therafters and shingles on the roof.' When they looked out, DR told me that each person in turn observed an 'intensetwinkling light descending in rapid, jerking movements down through a beautifulsunset.' DR specifically recalled that it appeared to be changing or 'shifting colorsthrough the visible spectrum' as it came down. (My notes do not show it, but I thinkthat he also said there was a slight whirring noise at this time.) The light now beganto 'gradually diminish in intensity and take on a definite form!' DR said that 'the light had transformed itself into an object. It hovered for just aninstant, began to oscillate in an arc from side to side, and finally dropped theremaining few feet to the ground.' He emphasized that 'it was in no way aconventional craft.' One of his friends now came up into the attic with a pair of binoculars. DR told me"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"that the object had 'settled slightly in to the sand' and 'appeared to be disc-shapedwith a small bulge on top.' He also noticed that the 'air shimmered around the craftas if it were extremely hot.' No occupants were ever sighted by anyone. DRcommented that 'this did not mean there were not any.' Air Force police immediately surrounded the object at a distance of 'several hundredfeet.' DR used these men and the somewhat familiar terrain as a scale to estimatethat the 'craft landed perhaps just a mile or so away.'; He thought it was between '50and 100 feet in diameter.' He also noticed from their rather restricted vantage pointthat helicopters now began to hover above the scene. Search lights came on atintermittent intervals. He also heard several jet aircraft crossing 'overhead at lowaltitudes.' Someone else saw two or three dark flat-bed trucks backing up to theobject. A 'large crane and several huge tarpaulins' were the last details DR noticed asdarkness fell. He recalled that all of them were quite 'excited and wanted to seewhat happened next.' However, they decided to go downstairs since none of themfelt very secure about what they were doing. DR and his friends were careful as they crept down from the attic. After awhile,however, they all 'began to whisper' among themselves about what they had justseen. They all agreed on one thing: they had just witnessed a large military forcecapture an object which a lot of people would call a UFO. He added that 'thisrealization came as quite a shock to us all.' He and a majority of the others felt it was'too alien to be man-made.' They further agreed it would be very unwise to ever'discuss what that meant again.' The next morning before breakfast, DR observed that the Air Police had cordonedoff the landing area and the craft was gone! He was sure that it had been taken'down the road to the warehouse.' It was a day of 'somewhat lessened restrictionsand heightened tensions.' This unsettled atmosphere continued for the next two months until class graduation.DR stressed at this point in his story that what happened in the next few months hastroubled him a lot. He also added that it provided the impetus 'for no longer keepingthe whole account a secret.' It began with their orders overseas. Without exception, the whole class was issuedorders to Viet Nam. Although DR spent 18 months in and around the Mekong Deltaarea, he later traced some of his friends to Cambodia. He pointed out that he wasshot at several times 'under rather unusual circumstances.' Specifically, these'potshots' usually occurred when he was alone and '99% of the time innon-combatant' areas. Once in a Saigon hotel, DR recalled a shot rang out which justmissed his head. He had the presence of mind to dig it out of the woodwork intactand later to weigh it. He told me that the number of grains 'corresponded exactly tothat of an American .38 caliber slug.' DR was certain that it was not Soviet-made!He now began to suspect that his situation was really more dangerous than it shouldhave been for 'someone who rarely went out into the field.' (Without going intospecific details, he also mentioned that he began to 'exercise due caution' whenalone.) His suspicions were later confirmed when he learned that almost half of his originalclass were officially listed as 'K.I.A. or M.I.A.' More distressing even that this,however, was the news that of those who had actually witnessed the capture (orwhatever of a UFO) from the attic, all except DR and another soldier were noweither dead or missing! DR left Viet Nam after 18 months feeling extremely 'luckyjust to be alive.' DR returned to Texas in 1971. He told me that he was determined to 'put it allbehind' him by leading a normal civilian life. However, he did add that 'memories ofthe whole incident continued to plague him.' He recalled one instance thatparticularly upset him. Specifically one night at dinner in a Dallas restaurant, DR'snew bride introduced him to a relative who was coincidentally a Colonel in the AirForce. DR said that later in the evening he asked the Colonel if he had ever 'heard ofan Air Force facility near Big Springs?' The Colonel immediately ushered DR into the men's room where, according to DR,he took 'care to ensure that we were alone.' The Colonel then proceeded to'interrogate' him about the base at Big Springs. He specifically wanted DR tovolunteer the details of any 'strange craft' that he might have witnessed landing! Upto that time, DR said he had not told the complete story to anyone. He certainly wasnot going to tell the Colonel anything either. He simply mentioned to the officer thathe had heard 'vague rumors about a UFO crash in the area.' DR politely omitted anyreferences to a controlled descent made apparently under military supervision."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Then, according to DR, the Colonel began to 'vehemently insist' that he instantlyforget anything relating to Big Springs Base.' DR of course asked for an explanation,but the Colonel responded with concerns about 'national security.' The Colonel didtell DR, however, that the 'whole operation was set up in the national interest.' Hecategorically denied to him that it had anything to do with a UFO. DR told me thathe persisted in his inquiry about a UFO. At this point, DR said the Colonel 'becamerather upset' and stated that he might have to initiate measures to ensure DR'scooperation. DR was very specific about his conversation with the Colonel. He told me that anymention of a UFO together with Big Springs Base brought on 'unsettlingramifications.' So much so that after his discussion with the Colonel had ended soabruptly, DR went back to the table and immediately left with his wife. He addedthat 'it ruined what could have been a nice dinner.' At this stage, let me say that I honestly believe that any reasonable person wouldhave a few serious doubts about DR's whole story. Let me again stress, however,that these doubts should mainly be due to the incredible nature of the account itselfand not to DR. At no time, even when relating specific details of 'the incident' did heever appear to be uncertain or contradictory. His demeanor was always one ofcredible sincerity. I cannot, on the other hand, rule out that his story was an aberration resulting from ahidden psychological trauma suffered in Viet Nam. I seriously doubt this, however. Ifelt that the two of us had a good rapport. Perhaps this was the reason he confided inme. He did not, so far as I could ascertain, tell anyone else the whole account, nordid he request that I keep it a secret. Simply stated, someone in our drafting classbrought up the subject of UFOs one day and, one thing leading to another, DR beganto relate his incredible account of the 'Big Springs Incident' (as I call it). It certainlyis worthy of conjecture, particularly in light of the recent movie, Hangar 18. It also,like the movie, is more than a slight bit sinister in its implications. I did make some effort to locate DR and have him verify the contents of this letter.Unfortunately, I didn't have any luck. He is not listed in the telephone directory, nordoes Arizona State University have any additional information on him. I have nottried to substantiate any details of his purported UFO retrieval. You should be awarethat quoted phrases and words in this letter are, however, taken directly from thenotes made during and immediately after my discussion with DR. It was, of course,necessary for me to at times rely on my memory alone. this was done mainly for thesake of continuity. I endeavored to be as accurate as possible in my interpretations. Leonard H. Stringfield COMMENT: Whatever the explanation for the event, mysteryhelicopters are involved as they have been reported in and around other militaryinstallations researched by Tommy Blann. Notably, unmarked choppers are often reportednear cattle mutilation sites. Of recent concern, (choppers were also reported) in thewell-publicized Cash-Landrum case occurring near Dayton, Texas, on December 29, 1980.In this incident, over 20 choppers were allegedly observed escorting a fiery UFO whichcaused three people to be hospitalized for suspected radiation effects. CASE B-3: 1974, California Specialized Training Institute, Camp San Luis Obispo"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"San Luis Obispo is south of Hunter Liggett Military Reservation,but the Camp San Luis Obispo location is unknown. Randall Clement, Truckee, California, has been a willing and able contributor to myspecial research project long before I published Status Report II. In 1981, he found a bigpiece to the puzzle from a new source - a sergeant in the California Highway Patrol. In1974, the sergeant, attending classes in an Officers Survival Course at the CaliforniaSpecialized Training Institute at Camp San Luis Obispo, was privy to hear a former highranking Army officer, who addressed the group, make what he considered high leveldisclosures about the UFO. Clement's letter of March 10, 1982, covered the disclosuresfollows: Randall Clement, March 10, 1982 Letter: 'I am a dispatcher for the California Highway Patrol and have been for almost 2years. Prior to that, I was a dispatcher for the Shasta County Sheriff's office inNorthern California. For the past 5 years, I have primarily focused my attentionstoward those undocumented sightings made by law enforcement officers. That is tosay, policemen who would rather not have a police report made of their (UFO)sightings, for fear of being deemed mentally incompetent in their job. In November of 1981, at a Dispatch Center in Central California, Sgt. X, a 15 yearveteran officer with the CHP, approached me to request if I had any UFO materialthat he might borrow to read. After assuring him that I did and said I would mail hima package of MUFON literature if he would let me have his address, he declined theoffer. Instead, he asked me if I had any knowledge of a crashed saucer incident thathad taken place in New Mexico. I explained that I had direct information from people who had knowledge ofrecovered UFO and supposed alien bodies from an incident that occurred in NewMexico. Upon obtaining my promise that his name would not be mentioned or used,he related the following story: About Sgt. X: 'In 1974, the Sgt. attended an Officer Survival Course at theCalifornia Specialized Training Institute at Camp San Luis Obispo. Theteacher/instructor of the course was Mr. Y. He is a retired high official from the U.S. Army. The Sgt. claimed that Mr. Y announced to the class one day that he had informationof a crashed saucer in New Mexico and the recovery of occupants of the UFO. Hefurther stated that there was no harm in releasing this information to the classbecause the U. S. Government would be releasing the information to the publicwithin three months. The Sgt. believed from the way Mr. Y was relating the story that he was possibly atthe scene of the recovery as it sounded that the information was firsthand. Thesubject was talked about for a few minutes with Mr. Y refusing to answer any directquestions about the UFO incident with members of the class. Then the survival classwas resumed. I have seen a copy of the announcement of courses offered at theCalifornia Specialized Training Institute. Without going into any detail, Mr. Y hasquite a list of degrees, credits and qualifications, including 1) U.S.A. Military Police;2) U.S.A. Command and General Staff College; 3) Army War College. Further contact with the Sgt. was unable to obtain any further information on Mr. Y.The Sgt. was unable to recall any more details of the short conversation from thatday. At this time, I am attempting to locate other officers who might have attended thisclass during the same general time span to see if they heard Mr. Y. tell the samestory. So far I have been unable to locate any CHP officers who attended. As some people know, 1974 was the year that it was rumored the U. S. Governmentwas going to make a press announcement regarding a recovered UFO to the public.It has been a long, long wait. Leonard H. Stringfield COMMENT: The officer's disclosure, according to the CHPsergeant, is significant. His reference to an imminent 1974 government announcementdeclaring UFOs were of extraterrestrial origin is extraordinary, indeed. I knew that a reportwas quietly circulating among responsible researchers in late 1974 which anticipated suchan announcement, perhaps jointly by the U. S. and France. According to notes in myUFOlog, December 3, 1974, I was alerted by Walter Andrus, Director of MUFON, to beprepared as Public Relations Director to rush to Chicago to join him and Dr. Allen Hynekof CUFOS in a press conference if official word was released. 'Straws in the wind,' I noted,"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"'were rife that the announcement would be made December 15, 1974, by President GeraldFord.' On the suggestion of Andrus, I prepared a tentative press release, got both his and Hynek'sapproval, and we waited. In my UFOlog entry for December 16, 1974, I noted: 'Wonderwhat President Ford and Giscard d'Estaing, President of France, are discussing inMartinique beside the oil problem?' If UFOs were on the agenda, we can only guess. The Martinique meeting ended withnothing said about UFOs. The biggest story ever, was never told.\" Continued in Part 8 - 1962 UFO Crash in New Mexico?Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
