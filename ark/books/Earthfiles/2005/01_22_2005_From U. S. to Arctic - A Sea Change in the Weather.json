S. to Arctic - A Sea Change in the Weather © 2005 by Linda Moulton Howe \"The kind of really severe wet, warm and windy winter that happened lessfrequently in the past, now the odds are that it will begin to happen more and moreoften.\" - Drew Shindell, Ph.D., NASA's GISS Front page top headline, The Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,September 22, 2004.Record-breaking rains and snowfall the first two weeks of 2005 spread destructionand havocfrom the West Coast to the East Coast. Above, Associated Press report on January19, 2005;Below, January 19, 2005 and January 9, 2005, Albuquerque Journal. January 22, 2005 New York City, N. Y. - This New Year was only a week old whenstrong, wet, windy storms began moving across the West Coast with an intensity that brokemany weather records in California, Nevada, Utah, Washington, Idaho and other parts ofthe northwest. Thirteen rivers in the western half of Washington State were near floodlevel. More than ten feet of snow piled in the Sierra's, blown by 60 mph winds. Nearly 200people had to be rescued from deep snow in the San Bernardino Mountains near LosAngeles. In the valley below the snow level, more than a half-inch of rain was recordedevery hour, while homeowners worked desperately piling sand bags to keep waterloggedground from sliding away. In the Los Angeles area, dozens of houses collapsed on water-soaked hillsides, including one mud slide in Ventura County that killed ten people. Theintense rainfall that swept through Ventura County, California, destroyed at least $38million worth of crops ranging from dates and carrots to strawberries, oranges andavocados. California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared the county a disasterarea."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" In Nevada, Amtrak train passengers were delayed for at least eight hours, Las Vegasstreets were filled with water and planes were grounded at the Reno-Tahoe InternationalAirport. At the same time in the Ohio River valley of the central to eastern United States,heavy rains and snows caused flooding in West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky. Thewild weather from coast to coast knocked out power for more than 100,000 homes andkilled a dozen people. Where did all the moisture come from to produce so much nearly unprecedented rain andsnow fall in such a short time? One physicist at the NASA Goddard Institute for SpaceStudies and the Center for Climate Systems Research at Columbia University says globalwarming computer models have long predicted a trend toward increased moisture andwind speeds on the West Coast of the United States. Dr. Drew Shindell studies the bigclimate picture of the Earth from the stratosphere down to the low, warm air we live andmove around in. This week I asked him if the intense January storms are a harbinger of thekind of weather that will occur more frequently as our planet continues to be warmed byincreasing greenhouse gases.Interview:Drew Shindell, Ph.D., Research Physicist, NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies(GISS) and Center for Climate Systems Research, Columbia University, New York,New York: \"Global warming makes a certain kind of weather more likely. That's the kindof thing we've been looking at for several years now in our climate models.YOUR COMPUTER MODELS HAVE PROJECTED FOR A LONG TIME THAT WITHINCREASING TEMPERATURES AND GLOBAL WARMING THAT THERE WOULDBE INCREASED WIND SPEED AND MORE WATER DROPPED ON THE WESTCOAST OF THE UNITED STATES, CORRECT?That's right. So we have been projecting in our simulations that especially during the winteryou would really start to see a difference in both Western Europe and the western portionof North America where we would see more warm and wet maritime air coming in andcausing warmer temperatures and increased rainfall and increased snow at higherelevations. That does seem to be quite consistent with what we are seeing this year.WITH EVEN GREATER POTENTIAL WIND POTENTIAL DAMAGE. I KNOW THATEUROPE HAS HAD A TERRIBLE TIME WITH WINDS AND RAIN AND IT'S MYUNDERSTANDING THAT ON THE WEST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES THEFIRST HALF OF JANUARY THAT HISTORIC WEATHER RECORDS WEREBROKEN.Yes. Again, it's this whole issue like the big summer heat wave that happened in Europelast year. The heat wave is not directly caused by global warming. So, these enormousextremes in winds are not directly a result of global warming. But if global warming ispushing the kind of mean behavior up a little bit, then when you have a particularly hotsummer or wet and windy winter, you are already starting from a position that's higher upon the scale. So in the summer you are starting from warmer temperatures and if you havea heat wave, it becomes extremely severe. The heat wave in Europe last year changedfrom something like one in 500 year odds to one in 100 year odds. And our projections arethat it will become a much more common occurrence a 1 in 10 odds or so over the nextseveral decades.That's the same kind of behavior you see in the winter with the odds changing. So youmight have very extreme winds in the past, but they might have happened only once everycentury. The kind of really severe wet, warm and windy winter that happened lessfrequently in the past, now the odds are that it will begin to happen more and more often.It's difficult to say what will happen in any particular year. But over say 2005 to 2015, thecoming decade versus the last decade, I would expect largely warmer temperaturesnationwide not guaranteed to happen everywhere, but the nation as a whole. The westcoast will likely see warmer and wetter winters as we have been discussing. Polar Night Jet Stream Near Record Strength in 2005JUST LIKE THIS ONE FROM 2004 TO 2005.Yes, this might turn out to be a more extreme than normal, but we'll see what happened.When we look up at the polar night jet the wind stream that flows around 60 degrees northand up at the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere say 15 kilometers up.When we look up at that, this year is exceptionally strong and near record strength from"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"past 40 years or so. So, I would not expect that to be the norm for the next decade. But wemight see this kind of very strong westerly, very strong Pacific air, being brought to theWest Coast and warm, wet, windy year much more frequently. How Do Communities Prepare for More Chronic Flooding?THAT POTENTIALLY MEANS THERE COULD BE MORE FLOODING PROBLEMS?More flooding problems and also flooding problems when all this snow begins to melt outWest. In the very long run, if it gets too warm for the snow to keep falling and it falls moreas rain which has been happening more on the East Coast where the mountains aren't ashigh and we're only in a few degrees of freezing point, so a couple of degrees warmermeans we get rain instead of snow. Then, it's actually a water supply issue. When it comesspring, there is not a lot of snow out to melt and fill up the reservoirs.So, there are a lot of water issues that I think planners would do well to start consideringhow to deal with, given the long time required for changes in water infrastructure.\"More Information:Arctic Warming Twice the Rate of Rest of EarthNovember 2004 Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA)Report by 250 Scientists from 8 Nations: \"The Arctic will warm by 7 to 13 degrees Fahrenheit this century, twice the rate ofthe rest of the world.\" Among many new travelers to the rapidly warming Arcticnow are robins, thrushes, barn owls, salmon and hornets.

For two weeks we have had very cold (sub zero temps)that were accompanied by a pretty decent amount of snow. I had actually hopedthat we were going to enjoy a 'normal\"'winter. \"Suddenly yesterday (01/19/05), we had a huge temperature shift that resulted intemps in the 50's. For two days now the weather has melted a huge amount of snowin town, and the snow at Bridger Bowl ski area is melting, slushy, and the skiinghas deteriorated badly. I do not recall this occurring in the ten years we have livedhere. Strangely enough, last year we had a high level of snowpack in themountains, but the temps increased so dramatically in March, and the snow meltedso quickly that it was rapidly absorbed and provided very little run off. Now, itwould appear that what happened last March has happened again, only in January,and the two-week-forecast does not seem to offer much relief.\" Computer graphic based on satellite observation of minimum sea-ice concentrations overArctic region in 1979.
