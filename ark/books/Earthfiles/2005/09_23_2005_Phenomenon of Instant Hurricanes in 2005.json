Right: Then intensified rapidly to a Category 5 on Wednesday,September 21, 2005. Satellite images courtesy NOAA. September 23, 2005 Miami, Florida - The United States mainland has never been hit byboth Category 4 and Category 5 hurricanes in the same season. But 2005 looked like itmight happen after catastrophic Katrina hit the Gulf Coast as a Cat 4 on August 29, andwas followed three weeks later by the ferocious Cat 5 Rita aimed at Texas with 170 mphsustained winds. By Thursday evening, September 22, Rita's winds had slowed to 145 mphas a still-dangerous Category 4 headed north toward Port Arthur, Texas.Hurricane intensity is measured using the Saffir-Simpson Scale, ranging from one (1) (minimal)to five (5) (catastrophic). Cat 3-5 hurricanes have caused over 70% of American natural disaster damage.Source NC Di vi si on of Emergency Management Hazard Mi ti gation Secti on.The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale goes from Category One to Category Five, five beingthe worst. Category Five is at least 100 times stronger than a Category One and hassustained winds of 156 mph or higher. Only three Category 5 hurricanes are known tohave made landfall in the U. S. first was the 1935 Florida Keys \"Labor Day\" storm; secondwas Camille, which slammed Mississippi in 1969; and third was Hurricane Andrew, whichflattened Dade County, Florida, on August 24, 1992.Early Saturday, September 17th, Rita was just a blob on weather radar off the FloridaKeys. But that blob suddenly turned into a dangerous tropical storm, then quickly becamea Category 1 hurricane that rapidly changed to a Category 2 as it drenched the Keys andsouthern Florida. Heading out into the warm Gulf of Mexico waters, Rita quickly becamea monster Category 5, forcing mandatory evacuation of nearly two million people fromGalveston, Houston and still-ravaged New Orleans.How did that radar blob on Saturday become a raging Category 5 hurricane by Thursday?Normally July through September hurricanes are supposed to form off the west coast ofAfrica near the Cape Verde Islands. But this year by mid-September, all seventeen of thenamed tropical storms - of which nine became hurricanes, including Rita - emerged closerto Florida and Cuba. Some residents are calling them \"instant hurricanes\" and evenmeteorologists admit the change is puzzling. Why are the 2005 summer hurricanes formingso far west?I asked Jim Lushine, who has been a National Weather Service meteorologist inMiami-Dade County, Florida, for thirty-three years.Interview:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"West of Mauritania is the Cape Verde Basin and Islands, where the normal \"seeds\" of hurricanes form fromlow pressurewaves that have moved across Africa, probably from Ethiopian mountains. Historically, the Cape Verdehurri cane seasonis July through September and those storm tracks cross the Atlantic toward Florida, Cuba and the Gulf ofMexico.Jim Lushine, Meteorologist, Miami-Dade County National Weather Service, Miami,Florida: \"What has happened this year which is unusual, but probably not unprecedented,is that there have been virtually NO Cape Verde hurricanes, none which have formed intoa hurricane off the coast of Africa. The early season storms formed where they normallydo in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, but now the storms of July, August andSeptember have also formed relatively close to the United States, rather than out farther inthe Atlantic. So, this has given rise to the idea that we are having 'surprise' hurricanes. Butin actual fact, they are not total surprises because we can track the beginnings of thesehurricanes all the way back to Africa. It's just the fact that they have not developed into ahurricane until they get relatively close to the United States.[ Editor's Note: The \"seeds\" of hurricanes are low pressure waves which come offthe higher altitudes of Ethiopian mountains and move across Africa. In normal yearsduring July, August and September, those low pressure waves leave the west coastof Africa around the Camp Verde Islands and turn into tropical storms which mightbecome hurricanes that travel for days across the Atlantic. ]BUT ISN'T IT TRUE WITH HURRICANE RITA, FOR EXAMPLE, ON SATURDAYNIGHT (September 17), IT WAS JUST A BLOB ON RADAR. THEN BY SUNDAYMORNING, IT WAS A THREAT?It did come in pretty quickly. It is quite a bit different than it is usually because the stormsas they form off Africa usually take about a week to ten days to get here. These formingvery close only have two or three days. So, it seems like it is a much shorter period of timeto get ready for them. What's Causing \"Instant Hurricanes\" In 2005?WHAT IS YOUR SPECULATION OR THEORY ABOUT WHAT IS CAUSING THESE\"INSTANT\" HURRICANES TO HAPPEN NOW?It's still very difficult to say. My own theory is that the area off the coast of Africa whichnormally spawns them has been kind of hostile this year in terms of the environmentalfactors, particularly the stability in the atmosphere. You need three ingredients to have ahurricane intensify.1) You need unstable area of air;2) You need very warm sea surface temperatures, usually above 80 degrees;3) You also need what's called a 'light wind shear.' We've had relatively light wind shear inthe breeding grounds (off Africa) and we've also had fairly warm water temperatures. So,the only thing that's probably missing and we don't measure very well is the air stability.One of the things that lead us to believe that is we've seen a lot of dust picked up by thetropical waves as they come off the coast of Africa. The dust comes from the Saharadesert. That actually makes the air more stable when you have that kind of dust in the air,so we think that is a partial explanation for why the storms have not been forming there,but form closer to the United States."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Example of massive sandstorm that blew off the northwestAfrican desert Feb. 26, 2000. Image credit: NASA.PEOPLE ARE ASKING: COULD GLOBAL WARMING BE RESPONSIBLE BECAUSETHE WATERS IN THE GULF HAVE BEEN REALLY WARM. IF GLOBAL WARMINGIS AFFECTING SURFACE TEMPERATURES, IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THECONDITIONS FOR STRONG HURRICANES GOING INTO OCTOBER ANDNOVEMBER WILL INCREASE WITH THIS WARMTH OF THE SURFACE WATERS?That's a possibility. The warmer the water, the higher the potential for the destructivepower of the hurricane. So as waters warm up, we could get more intense hurricanes atany time of the year, including during the heart of the season in July, August andSeptember, but also in October and November. Is Hurricane Season Getting Longer?There is some speculation that the season is actually being lengthened, too. Normally thehurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30. But in recent years here, we've hadhurricanes in December and some early storms in May. So it might be with the warmingcycle and we all agree there is a global warming going on. We're just not all in agreementabout what is causing the global warming. This might not only increase the intensity ofstorms, but also extend the hurricane season beyond what it normally is.THAT RAISES ALL KINDS OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ISSUES ABOUT HOWIN THE WORLD WOULD WE BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN GOVERNMENTEXPENDITURES - $200 BILLION THEY ARE SAYING FOR KATRINA IF WE HAD ALOT OF HEAVY CATASTROPHE FROM HURRICANES EVERY YEAR?That's correct. I think we have to come to the realization that we are seeing more andstronger storms and wherever they form, they are going to be a threat here. Could Hurricane Number and IntensityIncrease for the Next 20 Years?IF WE END UP HITTING THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER'S PROJECTIONOF 21 NAMED TROPICAL STORMS - OF WHICH NINE BY SEPTEMBER 22 HADBECOME HURRICANES - IS YOUR EXPECTATION THAT NUMBER COULDINCREASE IN 2006?I don't know. The year-to-year variability in hurricanes is great, even in this period of moreactivity. But I don't think there is too much doubt that since 1995, we've been in increasedactivity of hurricanes in the Atlantic. We think this cycle of increased hurricanes will lastfor another 15 to 20 years. We see all the way through 2020 to 2025 perhaps more stormsthan normal not necessarily 21 or more storms every year. There are other factorsinvolved, including what is called El Nino. That's a factor that decreases the number ofhurricanes in a particular year. But we haven't had El Nino conditions for awhile. That'spart of the reason why we continue to have so many storms.WHAT MAKES THE VARIABILITY OF A 20 TO 25 YEAR CYCLE IN WHICHTHERE WILL BE AN INCREASED NUMBER OF HURRICANES?It has to do with the salinity and the temperature of the ocean, the Atlantic in particular.When the water is more salty, as it is in cycles of about 20 to 25 years, it causes some ofthe salt being heavier than water to sink down and allows cooler water to come up. That'sthe negative phase of this multi-decadal cycle. We were in that from around 1970 to 1995.Now from 1995 on, the salinity has changed in the opposite direction (increased saltiness)and the water temperature has increased just due to the salinity. That's not counting theactual what we consider to be global warming thing, but the multi-decadal cycle is basedon the salinity in the Atlantic and how that affects the water temperature.[ Editor's Note: Historically, ocean salinity changes have been linked to cycles ofwater currents. However, now there is the new complexity of rapidly meltingglaciers. All that fresh water runoff into the oceans is reducing salinity in someareas. ]IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT IN GLOBAL WARMING AND CO2 BUILD-UP IN THEATMOSPHERE DOUBLING EXPONENTIALLY, THAT WE ARE FACINGUNKNOWN TERRITORY IN WHAT COULD HAPPEN WITH HURRICANES IN THEATLANTIC OCEAN?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Yes, there is a great deal of unknown about global warming and what that global warmingis caused by by man's effect or a natural variation. The Earth has been getting warmer nowfor the past 150 years overall. Is that part of a longer cycle? We can go back 10,000 yearsand find out there was a mini-Ice Age back then. In other periods before that there wereperiods that were warmer and colder. A lot of it has to do with how much radiation is beingreceived from the sun. We always thought there was what we called the Solar Constant that is the amount of solar radiation coming from the sun is the same all the time for yearson end. Now with satellites up there, we can measure that Solar Constant more carefullyand find out that there are variations in that. The amount of sunlight that comes in andheats the air up and causes the long-term trends in temperatures. Naturally the CO2situation is another part of it and sea levels will rise. Are Number of Large Hurricane Landfalls Increasing? Hurricane Katrina as Category 5 on August 28, 2005,more than 300 miles in diameter the day before landfall east of New Orleans.Image © 2005 by AccuWeather, Inc.COULD LARGE, INTENSE HURRICANES THAT MAKE LANDFALL KEEPINCREASING IN NUMBER FOR THE NEXT TEN TO FIFTEEN TO TWENTYYEARS?The number of storms out there are going to remain high. But what's interesting is that thenumber of landfalling hurricanes, regardless of whether we have 20 storms or 2 storms outthere in the Atlantic is actually about the same. We average about three landfallinghurricanes every two years, no matter whether we have a lot or few storms out there in theAtlantic. You might think that the more storms out there, the more chance they will makelandfall. That's not true. In many years, the storms stay way out at sea and never effectany land whatsoever. That happened back in 2003. There were 17 storms, and only one ofthem, Hurricane Isabel, made landfall.BUT RIGHT NOW IN 2005, WE KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN THREE MAJORHURRICANE LANDFALLS: DENNIS, KATRINA AND RITA ON THE WAY.That's right. And last year, we had four major hurricanes make landfall. Those areexceptionally large statistics. But if you go back and look at the last cycle of increasedactivity from the 1920s to 1930s and 1940s, there were a lot of hurricanes out there, butthe number of landfalls was not that many. Wo r s t C a s e S c e na r i o sWHAT IS THE WORST CASE THAT MIGHT HAPPEN NEXT YEAR AND THEYEARS AFTER?There are several still possible nightmare scenarios. New Orleans was certainly one ofthem. Even though it was a terrible tragedy out there, a stronger storm hitting at a slightlydifferent angle would have produced more flooding and perhaps more deaths in NewOrleans itself.But other areas around the country and the East Coast that are also vulnerable to acatastrophe are: Tampa Bay, Florida a very low lying area. The Houston-Galveston area,which hopefully won't be that bad during Rita, but it's possible. Then along the East Coast,New York City. If we had a hurricane similar to the 1938 hurricane that hit New Englandgo into New York City, it could flood the entire region of Manhattan's lower end and howmuch damage and how many deaths there would be is just too many to imagine.\"More Information:"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"For previous Earthfiles reports about global warming, see Archives:· 08/05/2005 -- Scientists Puzzled by \"Bizarre\" Pacific Coast Die-offs in 2005· 05/11/2005 -- Greenland Sea Cold Water Re-Cycling Has Nearly Stopped.· 05/07/2005 -- Did Milky Way Gas and Dust Turn Earth Into Icy Snowball FourTimes?· 02/03/2005 -- Kyoto Protocol Goes Into Effect February 16, 2005.· 01/22/2005 -- From U.
