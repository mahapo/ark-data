The series of status reports, I through VII,were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report IIIbegins at Earthfiles. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. For all theprevious status reports, see Earthfiles Archives. Leonard H. Stringfield: \"CASE A-8: Alleged retrievals of crashed or disabled strange craft, whether Earth-made as secretduplications of alien craft, or as alien craft per se, are a part of this paper for review.I have received numerous reports of what appeared to be demobilized strange craftwitnessed on the ground, but at the head of the list is the controversial saucer-shaped craft that allegedly landed at the Army base in Ft. Riley, Kansas, onDecember 10, 1964. The witness, AK, was reported in Abstract #20 in my first Status Report (to bereprinted in upcoming Earthfiles). I called him 'David' in my presentation at theMUFON Symposium in Dayton, Ohio. His real identity is known to a fewresearchers. Now AK/'David' has come under criticism based on a few supposedholes in his story. One is his reference to a General allegedly present on the scenewith him while he was assigned guard duty. He had assumed that the General wasthe Commander of the Base, 'General Seaman.' But when the supposed officer waslater interviewed by phone by researcher, Todd Zechel, he denied his participation.Of course, AK had only assumed that the General was Seaman. If it were GeneralSeaman, he certainly would not have admitted it in the phone call from Todd Zechel. Following is a brief review of the incident in an excerpt from Status Report I,Retrievals of the Third Kind, A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody, © 1978 by Leonard H. Stringfield, first presented at the July 29,1978, Dayton, Ohio, MUFON Symposium. 'The incident occurred on a crisp, cold night on December 10, 1964. At 2:00a.m., AK - a PFC on guard duty at the Motor Pool - and three other armypersonnel of the 1st Division on regular guard duty, were summoned by theOfficer of the Day, Lt. H (name known but withheld), to join him by vehicleto a remote area on the base described as a training area in Camp Forsyte,which is part of the Ft. Riley complex. On departing to this area, he wasissued an extra clip of ammunition for his M 14 rifle. After driving a good distance, Lt. H parked his vehicle alongside the road. AKand the other guards were ordered to hike about a half mile across an openflat field. Before him, AK watched the searchlight beam from an overheadHuey helicopter playing down on the field. It was focused on a large, roundobject resting on the ground. Already on the scene were about 10 Army"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"personnel of various ranks, including a Major General. Promptly, AK wasasked for his ID and given a direct order by the General to patrol thegrounded craft by circling around it and to 'shoot anyone if they tried to forcetheir way to the craft.' He was also sharply warned that he would have his '...shot off' if he talked. Comments AK, 'When I was in the Army, when aGeneral tells you something, you obey!' The lone Huey chopper continuously flew overhead while certain personnelon hand checked the object with instruments, and maintained communicationby field radio with head phones. Nearby, a 5-ton truck was parked with lightsoff. On two occasions, the Huey chopper flew over parts of the field, said AK,as though looking for other evidence. On several occasions during his 2 1/4hours of guard duty, AK got close to the metallic craft. 'The air was muchwarmer when I got close,' he said. The grounded UFO, said AK, which had impacted into the soil and stood at atilt, was approximately 35 to 48 feet in diameter and 12 to 18 feet in height. Itwas perfectly round, shaped like a hamburger bun. In the middle, or at theequator of its smooth aluminum-like surface, was a black band made up ofsquares, each jutting out about 10 inches. AK could not determine if thesquares were windows or what purpose they served. The only majorprotruding part on the UFO, said AK, was a fin-like device and beneath it anaperture which might have been an exhaust unit. AK said that the UFO wasnot lighted, and he smelled no odors. 'It was dead,' he said. Asked aboutoccupants aboard, he replied, 'Sorry to disappoint you, but I was not aware ofany life inside the craft, or that any bodies were taken out of it later.'

He has sent me a copy of his Army discharge papers, testifying thathe was in Ft. Riley at the time of the incident. He also has sent me the original letter,dated December 11, 1964, which he had sent to his fiance in California in which hemakes a reference to his call to special guard duty. His letter said in part, '...Hadsome excitement last night ... in the boondocks of Ft. Riley ... There was some oddthing in a field that we guarded for a couple of hours, probably some new type ofaircraft...' The envelope bears the proper return address, and a postmark datedDecember 14, 1964, Junction City, Kansas. Affixed to the envelope was an 8-centairmail stamp of proper issue for that time. To get more information, I encouraged AK, as a test, to seek publicity about hisincident. he placed an ad in the Los Angeles Times, and it was promptly seized uponby other media. Using 'David' as his identity, he got calls from many radio stationsthroughout the USA for interviews. It brought one positive result: another allegedwitness. The new witness called AK by phone from another city, described hisobservation of a strange craft being removed by rig in a remote area on the Ft. Rileybase, and stressed his need for anonymity for several understandable reasons. WhenI was informed of this new contact and AK sent him a copy of my first retrievalpaper, there was an impasse of several weeks before communications reopened. Iasked for a statement. More waiting. On November 17, 1978, I received thefollowing letter from the informant, signed 'Ron.' Ft. Riley Witness \"Ron\" Statement, November 17, 1978 'Dear Mr. Stringfield:"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"For the last two months, I've promised AK that I would write to you and tellyou about a possible UFO that I observed in Fort Riley, Kansas, in 1964. I'd forgotten all about it until I heard Dave's broadcast (radio station call letteromitted by request). Anxious to help him, I called and related the informationto him. When I told my wife about my experience and about my call to Dave,she became very upset and did not want us to get involved. I explained mysituation to Mr. K and naturally, he was disappointed, but said he understood. Mr. K. kindly mailed a copy of your report, 'Retrievals of the Third Kind,'which both my wife and I read. Oddly enough after reading the report, sheseemed less apprehensive about our involvement and agreed to my writing toyou. On the morning of December 11, 1964, I was stationed in a section of FortRiley known as Camp Funston, located at the far end of the complex. Atapproximately 7 or 8 a.m., I drove into the Main Post area of the fort to pickup the mail for our company. The postal clerk told me the mail would not besorted until 10 or 11 that morning. To kill time, I decided to drive around in the jeep and go exploring. I drove forabout an hour heading towards Camp Forsyte until I came to a paved roadthat was somewhat hilly in spots. It looked interesting and I wanted to seewhere it led. About 1 1/4 miles up there was a barricade across the road. Thesign read: RESTRICTED AREA NO UNAUTHORIZED VEHICLESBEYOND THIS POINT. My curiosity was aroused. No guards were postedaround the area, so I concluded that it must have been an old sign and wentaround the barricade and proceeded up the road. When I reached the crest ofthe hill, two M.P.s greeted me with their rifles pointed directly at me. Theyasked for my ID and then said, 'What in the hell is the matter with you? Can'tyou read? You're in a restricted area. Leave at once!!!' I obeyed immediately. About 60 to 80 feet behind the M. P.'s, I saw a gigantic flat bed truck, the kindthey use to move houses. There were about 6 men dressed in white, like theywere wearing CBRCBW germ warfare suits, which covered the entire bodyincluding the face; the face portion was covered with a gas mask which fitover the white hood. On the trailer or flat bed was an object which took up thewhole load area. I could not tell what the object was. It was round andcovered with canvas and held down with very large gauge chains. I guess thatI was there no more than a minute, so I did not see too much. Well, that's about it. I hope it will help Mr. K and I'd like to wish you bothluck in your search for the object that he saw. Please let Mr. K know that I didwrite to you. Sincerely,(Signed Ron)' After I received the letter, I sent AK a xeroxed copy and learned promptly that hiscontact regretted that he had sent the letter and if it were published, he had reasonto fear for his job. AK tried to persuade his informant that the letter was importantas a testimonial backup for his claim. He would not budge. In September of 1979, Ireached AK by phone and requested his approval to use the letter in this StatusReport II. He finally agreed on the condition that I omit the call letters (of radiostation) which might pinpoint his informant's area. In the Spring of 1978, I inquired about the status of the Ft. Riley incident withBarry, who asked his former C.I.A. contact. He learned that he was aware of theincident, but was not personally involved. COMMENT: Of the hundreds of letters and comments I have received from readers of my firstStatus Report, one stated in part, 'As a former officer of psychological operationswith the United States Army, I am perhaps more than normally alert to discrepanciesin testimonials. ...A case in point: In a super secret operation of the sort described,PFC's are never present. Indeed, the presence of a PFC pretty much eliminates thepossibility of the crash's (or landing) having been secretively handled...' Under normal circumstances, I agree that proper personnel from the base, or fromanother base, would have been dispatched to the site to cover all phases ofoperations, including guard duty. There are exceptions to the rule even in the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"military when emergencies arise, and personnel of any rank such as PFC AK arecalled upon for duty. In the case of AK, he was already on duty in the Motor Pooland was readily available. I recall during WWII while stationed near the village of Tanuan in Leyte, a combatzone in the Philippines, that I was called to check a possible enemy radio unit. Iremember asking for the armed support of a PFC to join me while I probed thesuspicious area. It is understandably difficult for anyone not having been involved ina retrieval operation, or having seen an alien body, to be a believer. I find it difficultto the point of frustration to rationalize the data I have received from the mostcredible sources, yet listening to AK's story repeatedly and evaluating its supportingevidence, I feel that there is a preponderance of pluses in its favor. The relevance of the Ft. Riley incident is that if a strange, saucer-like craft hadcrashed or landed there, then is it typical of other retrieval operations; and, if lifewas aboard, was it human or humanoid?\"To be continued in Part 6 - Ft.
