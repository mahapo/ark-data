Image credit:NASA, ESA, The Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA), J. Bell (Cornell University) and M. Wolff (SpaceScience Institute).NASA's Hubble Space Telescope snapped this picture of Mars on October 28, 2005, withina day of its closest approach to Earth on the night of October 29, 2005. Hubbleastronomers were also excited to have captured a regional dust storm on Mars that hasbeen growing and evolving over the past few weeks. The dust storm, which is the bright\"feathery\" feature in the middle of the planet in this picture, is about 930 miles (1500 km)long measured diagonally. That's about the size of Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexicocombined. NASA reported that a dust storm in the Meridiani region reduced sunshine enough theweekend of October 29-31, 2005, that Opportunity \"did not wake from deep sleep earlyenough for the first scheduled activities of that sol. The rover's onboard software properlyput Opportunity into self-protective automode for the day, so the rover did not take thepost-drive images. Dustiness of the atmosphere above Opportunity diminished a little onsol 630, as indicated by increased output from the solar panels.\" Now Opportunity is back"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"to work.

NASA: \"The low noise and high resolution of Spitzer's infrared array cameraenabled the team to remove the fog of foreground galaxies made of later stellarpopulations of stars, until the cumulative light from the first light dominated the signal onlarge angular scales.\"We removed everything we knew - all the stars and galaxies both near and far. We wereleft with a picture of part of the sky with no stars or galaxies, but it still had this infraredglow with giant blobs that we think could be the glow from the very first stars,\" explainedJohn Mather, Ph.D., Senior Project Scientist.If the red and yellow glow shown above is light from the earliest stars, the date is 13.9"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"billion years ago. The next step in the research will be to \"find the first individual clumpsof these stars or the individual exploding stars that might have made the first black holes.\" Graphic illustrating the location of our sun in a distant Milky Way galactic arm 26,000 light-yearsfrom the galactic center.

With advances in technology, it's now becomingmore clear that at our galaxy's center there are three objects: a young supernova remnanton the east side, an unusual ionized hydrogen region on the west side, and a very compactsource called Sagittarius A* at the very center. Sagittarius A*, or Sgr A*, is a suspectedblack hole that is 93 million miles in diameter with the mass of 4 million suns like the oneat the center of our solar system. Most surprising of all, there are young stars that encirclethe black hole at a distance of one light-year. How could that be? Black holes areconsidered destroyers of all matter and light around them.SGR A* is a suspected black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy.Image credit: NASA/CXC/MIT."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Radio map of Milky Way galactic center. \"At radio wavelengths, where we can peer down to the very center,we see the complex structures shown in the 1-meter wavelength radio map made by NRL astronomers. Themap showsa region about 2000 light-years on a side; the center of the Milky Way coincides with the source marked Sgr A(or Sagittarius A),which is actually three sources: a young supernova remnant on the east side, an unusual ionized hydrogenregion on thewest side, and a very compact source called Sagittarius A* at the very center.\" That is the suspected blackhol e.Graphic by Univ. of California-San Diego, Center for Astrophysics & Space Sciences.n the November 3, 2005 issue of Nature, Chandra X-Ray Observatory scientists RashidSunyaev and Sergei Nayakshin counted the ring of stars around the Sgr A* black hole.There calculation was about 10,000 low-mass stars. This supported their hypothesis thatthe \"gravity of the dense disk of gas that swirls around Sagittarius A* is strong enough tooffset the black hole's distorting tidal forces. With the two forces in balance, gas cloudscan naturally settle in and form stars.\" Thus, the ring of stars were born there and notcollected from passing free-floating stars. Further, the scientists have discovered that thestars born around the black hole are larger than more normal free-floating stars.An artist's concept of a ring of stars circling Sagittarius A*.Credit: NASA/CXC/M. Weiss.Until this Chandra discovery, it was thought that all suns emerged first in a free-floatingenvironment as cold gas in space without light. As gas becomes more dense, it collapsesunder its own gravity pull. Then as gas clouds shrink, atoms are crunched together andgrow hot enough to fuse together. That fusion releases light and heat and the explosivepressure halts gas collapse and a sun is born.More information: Also, see other Earthfiles astronomy reports:· 09/16/2005 -- \"Planet X\" and the Kuiper Belt's Oddballs, \"Santa\" and\"Easterbunny\"· 08/12/2005 -- Deep Impact Spectra: Carbonate, PAHs and Some Amino Precursorsin Comet Tempel I· 07/30/2005 -- Astronomers Report 10th Planet Far Beyond Pluto· 07/10/2005 -- First Data from Deep Impact Crash Into Comet Tempel I"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"· 06/29/2005 -- July 3-4, 2005: NASA \"Deep Impact\" Spacecraft to Blast Hole inComet Temple I· 05/07/2005 -- Did Milky Way Gas and Dust Turn Earth Into Icy Snowball FourTimes?· 05/06/2005 -- What Are The Straight Lines on Saturn's Titan Moon?· 04/20/2005 -- Outer Space Impact At Serpent Mound, Ohio, 256 Million Years Ago· 04/01/2005 -- What's Killing Off Marine Life Every 62 Million Years?· 03/03/2005 -- What Made Five Strong Radio Bursts At the Center of Our Galaxy?· 02/17/2005 -- Iapetus and Enceladus: Baffling Moons of Saturn· 01/13/2005 -- NASA \"Deep Space\" Craft Will Hit Comet On July 4, 2005· 11/17/2004 -- European Space Agency's SMART-1 Satellite Begins Moon Orbit· 10/07/2004 -- Exploding Stars: Investigating the 1604 and 1987 Supernovas· 08/28/2004 -- Near-Earth Asteroid 4179 Toutatis Comes By Again On September29, 2004· 06/25/2004 -- Wild 2, An Amazing Comet· 03/15/2004 -- Most Distant \"Icy Planetoid\" in Our Solar System Has A MostBaffling Orbit· 03/03/2004 -- Part 1 - Mars: Meridiani Planum Was Once \"Drenched With Waterand Habitable\"· 02/21/2004 -- Update On Mars with Cornell Astronomer Steve Squyers· 02/11/2004 -- Part 2: Opportunity Finds Martian Bedrock Has Lots of Sulfur andSmall Spherical Rocks· 10/25/2003 -- Science Data Reinforces Invisible \"Dark\" Matter and Energy MakeUp 96% of Our Universe· 09/02/2003 -- Astronomers Don't Think Asteroid Will Hit Earth in 2014· 08/26/2003 -- Mars At Its Closest August 27, 2003, At 2:51 a.m. PDT / 5:51 a.m.EDT· 11/02/2002 -- Update on 6,500-Year-Old Astronomical Stone Circle and Megalithsin Nabta, Egypt· 10/22/2002 -- U.
