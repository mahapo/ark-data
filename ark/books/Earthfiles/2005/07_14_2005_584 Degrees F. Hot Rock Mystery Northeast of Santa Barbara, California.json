Map © 2005 by Ireland, Ltd.July 14, 2005 Goleta, California - This week, brush fires in Rancho Palos Verdes,California, were inflamed by harsh winds and threatened multimillion-dollar homes. And inColorado, nearly 13,000 acres burned south of Denver, causing 5,000 people to run fortheir lives until firefighters got the flames back under control. Raging brush fires arebecoming a yearly problem in the west, especially California.Now comes a science report about rocks so hot they started the August 21, 2004, fire inthe Los Padres National Forest that burned up three acres last year about 18 milesnortheast of Santa Barbara. The fire started on the surface of a landslide that covers 17acres and probably slid within the past five to ten years. The cause for the landslide isunknown, and the source of all the hot rock is unknown. So far, geothermal or volcanicmagma have been ruled out.Seventeen acre land slide at east end of Dick Smith Wilderness in Los Padres National Forest.In the middle of the landslide are three acres that have the high temperatures. Image courtesy Allen P. King,USDAFS.This week I talked with a scientist who is going to present a paper about the phenomenonat the Geophysical Society of America in Salt Lake City, October 16-19. The scientist isAllen King, Southern California Province Geologist for the U.S.D.A. Forest Service, basedin Goleta, California. The title of Mr. King's upcoming presentation is: \"The LandslideThat Caused A Forest Fire: The Study of An Unusual Thermal Anomaly.\"I asked him about the beginning of the August 2004 fire and the discovery of at least onetemperature test area eleven feet deep that measured 584 degrees F. Scientists are stilluncertain about the sustaining source of such heat over the past eleven months.Interview:Allen P. King, Southern California Province Geologist (Los Padres, Angeles, SanBernardino and Cleveland National Forests), U.S.D.A. Forest Service, Goleta,California: \"The firefighters went out and extinguished the fire, but still felt heat comingout of the ground and they saw a number of fissures in the ground and areas with whitishand various colored mineral deposits on the surface and a lot of heat coming out."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"So, after not being able to figure out what was going on, they brought out a candythermometer and stuck it down in one of the fissures and the thermometer registered atemperature of 400 degrees F. which was the maximum the thermometer could register.Left to right: Bob Mariner, USGS; Jim Boles, UC Santa Barbara; Allen King, USDAFS,sampling hot rock and measuring heat in 2005.

We've measured heat at thesurface initially let's say between the surface and down a couple of feet. Themeasurements we got were initially just over 500 degrees F. Eventually we found a spotthat had a temperature of approximately 550 degrees F. down to a depth of about 14inches under the surface.Gas sample tube on the wellhead. Maximum temperature measured was at 11.5 feet undergroundat 584 degrees F. Photograph courtesy Robert H.

We measured a maximum temperature atabout 11.5 feet of 584 degrees F."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"[ Editor's Note: The Eocene epoch is part of the TertiaryPeriod in the Cenozoic Era, and lasted from about 54.8 to 33.7 million years ago. ]WHAT EXACTLY IS CAUSING THAT MUCH HEAT?That's what we are still trying to figure out. The exact cause is still unknown, but again ourtheory or working hypothesis is that the sulfide minerals in the shale body are reacting withoxygen and giving off an exothermic reaction that is producing the heat. But so far, it's notat all proven because the quantities of the sulfide minerals and organics within this rockbody are so small that we're just not sure there is enough there to support our hypothesis.So, we're still looking for other possibilities.BUT THIS IS HEAT HOT ENOUGH TO HAVE PROBABLY STARTED THAT AUGUST2004 FIRE?That's right.Steam fumaroles in the hot section of the landslide.Photograph courtesy Robert H. Mariner, USGS.THAT MUST BE OF GREAT CONCERN. I MEAN, CALIFORNIA IS OFTEN LIKE ATINDERBOX.Absolutely. The real curious part about it is there are lots of landslides out in that country.It's very steep and rugged country. So far, this is the only landslide we've recognized thathas had this heat develop in it.It's still somewhat of a mystery exactly what the cause is. We do anticipate that since therewas some vegetation that re-grew this winter and spring, that there is a possibility thatanother fire could be ignited. But the vegetation is very sparse in that area, so it's not amajor concern at this point. HAS THERE EVER BEEN A PRECEDENT FOR A LANDSLIDE THAT WOULDCAUSE A CHEMICAL REACTION IN ROCKS THAT WOULD BE THIS HOT ANDCAUSE FIRE?Not that we're aware of. We've done some literature search and talked to many scientistsin both the academic and government agencies. Nobody we've contacted or talked with sofar or people they've networked with so far have come up with any other features of this"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"sort.We made a visit back to the site about a week and a half ago and took some more rocksamples where we dug down into a couple of the hottest areas and down to a 2-foot depth,we were able to sample the rock that was over 400 degrees F. We pulled the rock out andlet it cool. then we shipped that rock off for additional testing. We're hoping that this rockthat was right in the middle of the hot areas will give us some more clues about thechemical reaction or what the cause of the heat actually is.WHAT ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF UNDERGROUND GEOTHERMAL ORMAGMA OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?We've considered those possibilities and so far have not found any indicators thatgeothermal Nor volcanic actions are involved at all. None of the gas testing has indicatedanything of that nature.WHAT ABOUT JULY SO FAR ANY MEASUREMENTS?No, we haven't been back out there since June 29.BUT THE IMPLICATION IS THAT WHATEVER IS CAUSING ALL THIS HEAT IS NOTGOING AWAY.That's right. The hottest areas have cooled down a little bit for example, down from 584degrees F. down to 565 degrees F., which is not major cooling over the span of about sixmonths. THIS FIRE WAS IN AUGUST 2004 WHICH WAS NEARLY A YEAR AGO. THATMEANS THE ROCKS HAVE BEEN SUSTAINING THAT HIGH TEMPERATURE FORA YEAR. IS THERE ANYBODY WHO HAS AN IDEA EVEN AT THE CHEMICALREACTION LEVEL WHAT WOULD SUSTAIN HIGH HEAT LIKE THIS IN ROCKSFOR SO LONG?Not any specific ideas, no. We're testing this hypothesis and trying to get more laboratoryresults that might give us some more clues of the cause of the heat. We hope to get someinfrared thermal flights over the area before too long to indicate if there is any relation tolocal faults and heat, or other landslides in the area and any heat. So far, we don't havethat information.I might add that the heat is not spread evenly over those 3 acres. It's quite patchy, which ispart of the reason we suspect the heat is not a deep seated source, but it seems to beoccurring within pockets fairly near the surface scattered around the three acre area. It's avery interesting and mysterious site that we're really hoping we get some more definitiveanswers on.
