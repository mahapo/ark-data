December 17, 2005 Baltimore, Maryland - For the first time in human astronomicalhistory, scientists have used NASA's Hubble Space Telescope to isolate the light from thewhite solar dwarf known as Sirius B orbiting its huge and bright companion, Sirius A, inthe constellation Canis Major. Since the Sirius B discovery in 1862, astronomers have beenfrustrated by the intense glow of Sirius A overwhelming their ability to \"see\" and \"weigh\"tiny, but very dense, Sirius B. This breakthrough information was published in the recent Monthly Notices of the RoyalAstronomical Society: \"An international team of astronomers used the keen eye of theNASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope to isolate the light from the white dwarf, called SiriusB. The new results allow them to measure precisely the white dwarf's mass based on howits intense gravitational field alters the wavelengths of light emitted by the star.\" Huge Sirius A is 1.5 million miles in diameter (2.4 million kilometers) and has a mass twotimes that of our Sun. Now it turns out that its companion and very dense white dwarf,Sirius B, has a mass that is 98% that of our own Sun, while it is even a bit smaller than ourEarth. Sirius B is only 7,500 miles (12,000 kilometers), in diameter. \"It's powerfulgravitational field is 350,000 times greater than Earth's, meaning that a 150-pound personwould weigh 50 million pounds standing on Sirius B's surface. Light from the surface ofthe hot white dwarf has to climb out of this gravitational field and is stretched to longer,redder wavelengths of light in the process. This effect, predicted by Einstein's theory ofGeneral Relativity in 1916, is called gravitational redshift, and is most easily seen in dense,massive, and compact objects whose intense gravitational fields warp space near theirsurfaces.\" The Hubble observations also refined the measurement of Sirius B's surface temperature tobe 44,900 degrees Fahrenheit (25,200 degrees Kelvin). Much larger Sirius A's surfacetemperature is half as warm at 10,500 degrees Kelvin. How Could A West African TribeHave Known About Sirius B? The Sirius binary stars are only 8.6 light-years from Earth. Human stargazers of ancienthistory carefully watched the brightest star in the sky. Egyptians might even have orientedpyramids in relationship to Sirius A. But officially, astronomers did not know there was a"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"second, dwarf sun with Sirius until 1862, one hundred forty-three years ago, finally seen inone of the most powerful telescopes of that time. And yet, in a 1954 book entitled African Worlds, edited by Daryll Forde at OxfordUniversity Press, there is a chapter about the Dogon tribe of West Africa translated intoEnglish from the original French of two eminent anthropologists: Marcel Griaule andGermaine Dieterlen. The scientists had studied the Dogon tribe and wrote: \"Thestarting-point of creation is the star which revolves around Sirius and is actually named the'Digitaria star'; it is regarded by the Dogon as the smallest and heaviest of all the stars; itcontains the germs of all things. Its movement on its own axis and around Sirius upholds allcreation in space. We shall see that its orbit determines the calendar.\" Those sentences later provoked Robert K. G. Temple to write in his 1976 book, The SiriusMystery: \"The Dogon consider that the most important star in the sky is Sirius B, whichcannot be seen. They admit that it is invisible. How, then, do they know it exists?Griaule and Dieterlen say: 'The problem of knowing how, with no instruments attheir disposal, men could know the movements and certain characteristics ofvirtually invisible stars has not been settled, nor even posed.' \" ...Grill and Dieterlen make clear that the large and bright star of Sirius is not asimportant to the Dogon as the tiny Sirius B, ... The Dogon also know the actualorbital period of the invisible star, which is fifty years. Referring to the sacred Siguiceremony of the tribe, Dieterlen and Griaule tell us: 'The period of the orbit iscounted double, that is, one hundred years, because the Siguis are convened in pairsof 'twins,' so as to insist on the principle of twin-ness.' \"The Dogon also say that Sirius B rotates on its axis, demonstrating that they know astar can do such a thing. ... Griaule and Dieterlen wrote, 'As well as its movement inspace, Digitaria also revolves upon itself over the period of one year and thisrevolution is honoured during the celebration of the bado rite.' \"...the orbit of digitaria (Sirius B), which the Dogon elsewhere describe asegg-shaped or elliptical, is specifically described as having the main star Sirius as'one of the foci of its orbit'. \"...How did the Dogon tribe, who had no access to the theories of Johannes Kepler(1571-1630) or his successors, now about matters like this? How did they even getthe idea in the first place that elliptical orbits existed, rather than circular - much lessapply this idea to some invisible star way out in space? And also to get it right bysaying that Sirius A was at one of the foci, rather than just somewhere in the ellipse?And not at the center?\" Dogon tribe drawing for French anthropologists about the elliptical orbit of Sirius B (\"S2)around Sirius A (\"S). (\"S3\") is a third star with (\"P\") planet that the Dogon say are part of the Sirius A and Bsystem. Te m p l e : \"It was Kepler who first proposed that heavenly bodies do not move in"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"perfect circular paths. He hit upon the brilliant insight that the planets in theirmotions around the sun were moving in elliptically-shaped orbits, with the sun at oneof the two foci of each ellipse. \"The Dogon describe Sirius B as 'the infinitely tiny.' As we now know, Sirius B is awhite dwarf and the tiniest form of visible star in the universe. But what is really themost amazing of all the Dogon statements is this: 'The star which is considered to bethe smallest thing in the sky is also the heaviest: 'Digitaria is the smallest thing thereis. It is the heaviest star.' It consists of a metal called sagala which is a little brighterthan iron and so heavy 'that all earthly beings combined cannot lift it.' In effect, thestar weighs the equivalent of ... all the seeds, or of all the iron on the earth ...' (allthis from the 1954 article by Griaule and Dieterlen). \"So we see the Dogon ... know that the Sirius B star is invisible, but they know it isthere nevertheless. They know that the star's orbital period is fifty years, which itreally is. They know that Sirius A is not at the center of its orbit, which it is not.They know that Sirius A is at one of the foci of Sirius B's elliptical orbit, which it is.They know that Sirius B is the smallest kind of star, which it is (barring totallyinvisible collapsing neutron stars). They know that Sirius B is composed of a specialkind of material which is called sagala, from a root meaning 'strong,' and that thismaterial does not exist on the earth. They know that this material is heavier than allthe iron on earth, all of which is perfectly true. For Sirius B is in reality made ofsuper-dense matter of a kind which exists nowhere on earth.\" Click on book cover to amazon.com.More Information:For more about binary stars, please see reports below in Earthfiles Archives :· 12/07/2005 -- Zeta Reticuli I and II - Binary Home of Extraterrestrial BiologicalEntities?· 10/05/2002 -- Part 1 - Two Scientists Describe An Extraterrestrial Biological EntityCalled \"J-Rod\"· 09/06/2000 -- Hubble Photographs Mystery Object in Centaurus ConstellationWebsites: Royal Astronomical Society: http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/journal.asp?ref=0035-8711Hubble Space Telescope: http://www.stsci.edu/hst/ NASA: http://hubble.nasa.gov/index.phpCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2010 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Republication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2010, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
