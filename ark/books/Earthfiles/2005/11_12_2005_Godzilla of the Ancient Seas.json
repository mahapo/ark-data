November 11, 2005 Washington, D. C. - National Geographic announced this week thata large fossil sea monster about 135 million years old with a head like a carnivorousdinosaur and a tail like a fish's has been discovered in Argentina's Neuquen Basin at thefoot of the Andes. The scientist who found the specimen is calling the fierce-lookinganimal \"Godzilla,\" or \"chico malo,\" which means the \"bad boy\" of the ocean.

This \"Godzilla\" of the ancient seas musthave dominated its water territory where it ate reptiles, large sea life and sea birds.Crocodyliforms are a group that today includes crocodiles and their extinct relatives. \"Thisanimal was one of the latest members of its family (Metriorhynchidae) and certainly themost bizarre of all marine crocs,\" said Diego Pol of the Ohio State University, a coauthoron a November 10, 2005, paper in the journal, Science. \"Nobody really had expected tofind these (physical) features in a marine croc.\" Fore ground: actual fossil skull of Dakosaurus.

The Godzilla fossil, whose scientific name is Dakosaurus andiniensis, was discovered inan intact skull and some vertebrae in the desert region of Neuquen, Argentina, which is fullof fossils. \"This animals anatomy is really a contrast with that of the other sea crocs thatdeveloped during the Jurassic,\" said Zulma Gasparini, Professor of Paleozoology atArgentina's Universidad Nacional de La Plata, who led the 1996 expedition which foundthe skull.

Instead of a long, thin snout typical of most marine crocs, the fossil's snout is very shortand high. Instead of numerous, thin teeth, the sea creature's teeth were large, curved andserrated, reminiscent of dinosaur teeth. The differences between the ancient crocodile-likesea monster and todays crocodiles are: - in place of legs, the Dakosaurus had four paddle-like legs used for stability in the waterand not walking around on land.- the Dakosaurus propelled itself through water by a vertically oriented, fish-like tail.- Air breathing, the Dakosaurus would need to swim to the sea surface to gasp oxygen andthen dive down 600 to 750 feet deep near the bottom to look for food.
