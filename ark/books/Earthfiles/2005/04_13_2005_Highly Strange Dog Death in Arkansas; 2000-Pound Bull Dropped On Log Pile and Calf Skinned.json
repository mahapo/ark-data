Hope and Ashdown, Arkansas, circled in black on the map, are areasof animal mutilation reports over the past several decades.April 12, 2005 Doddridge, Arkansas - Rancher Ricky Lummus is 43-years-old. He hasbeen raising animals for half his life. Nine years ago, he and his family moved on to 90acres in southwestern Arkansas between Bloomberg, Texas, and Doddridge, Arkansas,very near the \"T-border\" where Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana come together. He runs hiscattle with cow dogs. Recently he added two male puppies about two-months-old to hisother five dogs for a total of seven.Further north in Ashdown and Hope, Arkansas, there have been several unusual cattledeaths over the past several decades. [See: An Alien Harvest and Glimpses of OtherRealities, Vol. I: Facts & Eyewitnesses by Linda Moulton Howe in Earthfiles Shop.] Butthe Lummus family had never seen such deaths on their property or anywhere else in thesurrounding community - until Sunday morning, April 10, 2005, around 10:20 a.m. CST.Ricky Lummus was leaving for church. His wife, a Sunday school teacher, had goneearlier with their daughters.Interview:Ricky Lummus, Rancher, Heavy Construction and Timber Equipment Wholesaler,Pipe Fitter and Rodeo Bull Raiser, Doddridge, Arkansas: \"I saw low flying buzzards,kind of flying low and I knew they were looking at something. Since I have cattle, I alwayscheck. That's when I found the dog after I made a U-turn and came back. When I droveup, I could see immediately that he had been cut with a very sharp instrument. The groundwas not even disturbed. I've seen a lot of animals, a lot of dead. This just baffles me! Noblood whatsoever.The first thing I noticed was part of his spine, his back bone. It looked like a 2 to 2.5 inchsection of his spine was cut out some way (later veterinarian necropsy confirmed about 6inches excised). It was just like you would cut a piece of board out and remove it. That'sthe first thing I noticed on his spine, that a section was gone!WAS THE CUT VERY SMOOTH?Yes, the cut on the spine there were no splinters. It was even on both sides and not anytears or splinters in the bone."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Two-month-old cow dog as owner Ricky Lummus found him on Sunday morning,April 10, 2005.

It's my hay meadow. When I drive or walk out there, thegrass lays down so you can see tracks. You can't walk out there without leaving some signof if you rode a bicycle out there, you'd probably leave a trail. Where the dog was, I couldnot figure it out because the first thing I looked for were signs of tracks or 4-wheeler tracksor a vehicle or foot or something and nothing, just nothing. I called my brother. He camedown. We searched and searched for some kind of clues where they came in whoever, orwhatever. We couldn't find no sign of nobody coming on my property. I have a dirt roadcoming in. You leave tracks on a dirt road. There were no tracks out of the ordinary. That'sstrange.Rancher Ricky Lummus used trash can to cover and protect cow puppy's bodyafter he contacted Miller County Sheriff's office to investigate.

I pen my cattle and work them withdogs and I have real good cow dogs and this puppy was one I was going to keep out of thisset of cow dogs (puppies) I have. And he was a good one, or was going to be a good one.He really wasn't old enough yet, but I could tell. He was a smart little dog."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"He also had two holes in his head, real clean holes - one right above his (left) eye and theother was up on the head.WAS THERE ANY KIND OF LIQUID COMING FROM THOSE HOLES OR WERETHEY DRY?They were basically dry. [Editor's Note: There were two more holes at the throat wherethe hair was stained with blood. They penetrated only about an inch to the jaw bone.]Arrow points at one of two, small holes penetrating to skull bone.At throat, were two more small holes surrounded by blood-stained hair.Photograph © 2005 by Ricky Lummus.I had to pry his mouth open because I wanted to see if there might have been a bulletbecause I automatically thought it was a bullet hole and thought maybe a bullet had hungin his mouth. I pried his mouth open and his tongue was gone. And there was some kind ofsubstance - like someone took a handful of sawdust and put it in his mouth. Puppy Was Alive and Well Night Before,But Dogs Barked At 1 a.m.WHEN WAS THE LAST YOU AND YOUR FAMILY SAW AND PLAYED WITH HIM?About 8:30 or 9 o'clock Saturday night.EVERYTHING WAS FINE?Yes, my daughters played with him in the yard until dark like they do every day. It was justa pretty sad situation.DID YOU HEAR ANY BARKING?Yes, approximately 1 a.m. I have two dogs here who are really good watchdogs. They wasbarking about 1 o'clock. I didn't investigate as much as I should have. But they did bark.Sometimes they bark at my cows or a rabbit. Two of the dogs was barking.THE TEXARKANA-GAZETTE WROTE: 'LUMMUS SAID HE WOULD NORMALLYSHINE A SPOTLIGHT ON THE AREA, BUT WAS NOT ABLE TO DO SO BECAUSETHE BATTERIES FOR THE SPOTLIGHT WERE DEAD.\"Exactly, I've got a big spotlight and it lights up the world. I did go to investigate when thedogs were barking and the battery was down on the spotlight. This was a big spotlight. Thebatteries was down and I didn't have any way to see what the dogs were barking at. So Ijust brushed it off. That's the only time I always investigate when my dogs are barking orsomething is going on. But for some reason that night, the batteries in my spotlight wouldnot work. I didn't see no lights and didn't hear anything.DID YOU LOOK UP IN THE SKY?No. I did not.HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT MUTILATIONS HAPPENING IN YOUR AREABEFORE?No, not close to here. I've heard about it up in Hope and Little River County in Arkansas,a few years back. The Sheriff's deputies said it has happened before, but I never saw it. I"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"heard a little bit about the mutilations, but I'm kind of like everyone else just kind ofbrushed off and skeptical about it. But I'm not any more. Because when it happens to you,you see what happens, it changes your mind.BECAUSE IT'S SO WEIRD.Yes, it is, real weird! If the dog had been out in the pasture and just been shot or there hadbeen tracks or blood everywhere or he looked like animals had attacked. It's hard to kill adog or an animal. they are going to try to drag themselves around. You can usually seewhere the ground is disturbed where an animal died because they don't die easy.Not a blade of grass out of the ordinary and that's what just gets me.WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE DOG?I took the dog and wrapped him. I put him in a plastic bag and I put him in a freezerbecause I wanted to preserve him and that's the only way I knew. I knew this was out ofthe ordinary and I knew this was something I probably needed to check into a little further.So, I took him and wrapped him up and froze him.\"Two deputies from the Miller County Sheriff's office visited the scene with RickyLummus. Their attitude was casual. The deputies did not take any photographs and toldMr. Lummus the puppy had been killed by \"devil worshippers.\" But Ricky Lummus wasnot satisfied with that lack of investigation and contacted his local veterinarian, MichaelDodd, D.V.M. to do a necropsy.

He said if it was gunshot wounds, there woulddefinitely be some type of fragments. When he got the x-ray back, the holes went throughthe muscle. The holes did stop at the skull, at the bone. They did not go all the waythrough like I thought they would.He said the whole case was very unusual to him. He said the way the spine was gone andno sign of anything that is really strange. \"Sawdust\" Probably Insect EggsPuppy's mouth full of \"sawdust\" Sunday morning, April 10, 2005.Photograph © 2005 by Jim Williamson, Texarkana-Gazette."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"WHAT ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE IN THE MOUTH?Dr. Dodd thinks it's some type of larvae or eggs, maybe flies. We found it in the mouth andin the abdominal cavity a little bit. [Editor's Note: No explanation about why larvae wouldbe concentrated in the puppy's mouth only hours after its death.]DID HE EXAMINE WHERE THE TONGUE HAD BEEN CUT?He said the tongue looked like it had been chewed, a little more jagged. But I kind of had adifferent opinion about that. He said it could have been cut, but it wasn't cut with theprecision that everything else was cut.\"Michael Dodd, D.V.M., examines severed tongue after removing mass of presumed larvaefrom the puppy's mouth. Photograph © 2005 by Ricky Lummus.Other Strange Animal DeathsNear Ricky Lummus PasturesSince I posted this report at Earthfiles.com this week, Ricky Lummus has now learnedfrom neighboring ranchers within a couple miles of his ranch, that within the last fourweeks a 2,000 pound bull was found on top of a log pile. The bull's owner told Mr.Lummus that it was \"as if something had dropped the bull from the sky.\" And yet, thatrancher had not reported the strange discovery to anyone until now. Another ranchneighbor told Mr. Lummus that also in the past four weeks, one of his young calves wasfound completely stripped of its hide. But he did not report that animal either. Strippedhide has been reported many times in areas where the more classic animal mutilations aresimultaneously occurring.If anyone has any information about what's happening to animals in southwesternArkansas right now or knows about any similar incidents anywhere else in the UnitedStates or other countries please contact me at my e-mail address which is:earthfiles@earthfiles.comMore Information:The Derry Journal is the second oldest newspaper still in circulation in Ireland, launchedon June 3, 1772.
