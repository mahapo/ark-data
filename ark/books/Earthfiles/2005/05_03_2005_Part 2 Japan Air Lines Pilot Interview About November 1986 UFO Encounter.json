To the far left, the long yellowline is the boundary betw een Canada and America's Alaska. Fairbanks is the upper horizontalline and Anchorage is the lower yellow line near the Gulf of Alaska. Anchorage is the homeof the U. S. Army's Ft. Richardson and the US Air Force's Elmendorf AFB. Return to Part 1 May 3, 2005 - Thurmont, Maryland - The following transcript is from an interviewconducted in January 1987 by the U. S. Federal Aviation Administration ChiefInvestigator, John Callahan, with Japan Air Lines Pilot, Kenju Terauchi, about his JALFlight 1628 encounter with a massive UFO on November 16, 1986. The transcript wasprovided to Earthfiles by U. S. Navy Research Physicist, Bruce Maccabee, Ph.D., after Dr.Maccabee obtained the case file records from the CIA. Transcript of Interviewwith JAL Pilot, Kenju Terauchi“Once upon a time if a hunter saw a TV, how would he describe it to other people?My experience was similar to that. The north of Alaska in mid-November youcannot even see the sun. The darkness continues until the middle of March. JALFlight 1628, a B747 jumbo cargo plane, encountered two spaceships and a 'MotherShip' about 50 minutes above Alaska. There was no danger, but it created manyquestions that a human being cannot answer. So, I am writing that experience down here. ...This special flight was to importspecial French wine from Iceland to Anchorage for approximately a 6 hour and 20minute flight. It is an extremely short flight compared to most flights. It takes abouttwo-thirds normal flight hours. There are only two landings at Keflavik InternationalAirport in Reykjavik, Iceland. This particular flight was planned to stop at Iceland and increase cargo items, ratherthan flying directly from Paris to Anchorage. However, since being wintertime, ifthe condition of the runway was poor, we might have to reduce the cargo.Therefore, everyone was paying special attention to the amount of cargo. Thetemperature of Keflavik Airport in November is approximately maximum of 3degrees C. and the lowest was minus 3 degree C. Six of us Japan Air Lines employees arrived at Keflavik Airport at midnight andthree people welcomed us as usual. We headed on to a new hotel. ... We stayed onlyabout 17 hours. The weather became good and the runway was not frozen and weleft Keflavik Airport at 20:42."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" We took a flight course southeast of Greenland direct to Thule USAF Base, Thule,Greenland, by crossing the great icy highland mid west of Greenland. The flightabove Greenland, under a nearly full moon which was rising on the right front sideof our aircraft, helped visibility for the night flight. The flight was smooth, despitethe unstable air current that shook the plane for about two hours. But still, it was arather stressless flight as compared to a passenger flight. We aimed towards Single Point on the north coast of Canada, passing through theCanadian north polar regions and down southwest along an Arctic flight course. Itwas 4:25 p.m. Alaska time when we reported our location to Edmonton Center fromabove Single Point, Canada (68 degrees 55 minutes North Latitude; 137 degrees 15minutes West Longitude). It had become pitch dark, perhaps because the moon wasdirectly behind us near the horizon. We received an order from Edmonton Centerthat we should contact the Anchorage Center when we reached where AlaskaTerritorial Air begins. That location is approximately 480 miles (890 kilometers)north-northeast of Anchorage at 67 degrees, 56 minutes North Latitude and 141degrees West Longitude. [ Editor's Note: Not far from Ammerman Mountain,Alaska.] We began the communication with the Anchorage Center about 5:05 p.m. The flightcourse we had acknowledged was Jet 529, direct to Ft. Yukon, and Jet 125 viaNenana, Talkeetna, and to Anchorage.JAL Pilot Terauchi's flight path fromAmmerman Mountain area near Canada/Alaska bordersouthwest past Fairbanks, Nenana, Talkeetna to Anchorage. The Anchorage Center ordered us to fly direct to Talkeetna, provided us transpondercodes and placed us on a radar scope at the same time. The strange phenomenonhappened immediately after we began left rotation, following the order of taking thedirect flight course. There was an unidentifiable light ahead of the rotation. We set the course towardTalkeetna and began level flight. Then we saw lights that looked like aircraft lights,30 degrees left front, 2,000 feet (600 meters) below us, moving exactly in the samedirection and with the same speed as we were. We were at the altitude of 35,000feet (10,600 meters), flying speed was 900 kilometers per hour to 910 kilometers perhour. We ignored the lights, thinking probably they were special missioned (USAF)aircraft or two (USAF) fighters, because we did not notice the lights whilecommunication with the Anchorage Center or on prior visual inspection. However,the position of the lights had not changed, even after a few minutes, and that caughtour attention. The First Officer called the Anchorage Center and asked to report tous if there were any aircraft other than ours in the area. The Anchorage Center told"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"us that there were no other aircraft in the north area. We immediately reported back that we were seeing aircraft lights. Anchorage againreported that there was no military aircraft, and the ground radar did not show anyaircraft but us. Anchorage also asked us several times if there were clouds near ouraltitude. We saw thin and spotty clouds near the mountain below us, but no clouds inmid-to-upper air. The air current was steady and conditions were quite pleasant.Perhaps the Anchorage controllers were concerned that an increased use ofimproved laser beams using clouds was creating moving images. We kept observing the lights below us in left front, thinking it was ridiculous to havelaser beam testing at the end of a tundra area. Then the two lights began to move ina manner different from ordinary aircraft maneuvers, like two bear cubs playingwith each other. We continued the flight south along a straight course since thedistance from the lights was far enough from us and their movement was notextreme and we felt no immediate danger. I thought perhaps it is one of those things called 'UFO' and to take a photo mighthelp to identify the object later. I asked to bring forward my camera bag that wasplaced in the rear of the cockpit and began to take a picture. The area in which theplane was flying was unchanged, but the lights were still moving strangely. I hadASA 100 film in my camera, mainly to take scenery, and had auto-focus on. I aimedat the object, but the lens kept adjusting and I never could set a focus. I changedauto-focus to manual-focus and pressed the shutter. But this time, the shutter wouldnot close. Then our aircraft started to vibrate and I gave up taking a photo. I placedmy camera back in the camera bag and concentrated on observing the lights. It was about seven or so minutes since we began paying attention to the lights, mostunexpectedly two spaceships stopped in front of our face, shooting off lights. Theinside cockpit shined brightly and I felt warm in the face. Perhaps firing of jets wasthe result to kill inertia of their quick high speed maneuver, but the ships appearedas if they were stopped in one place in front of us.” Continued in Part 3 - Massive Walnut-Shaped ObjectMore Information:For further information about the worldwide UFO phenomena, please see EarthfilesArchive (partial list below) and my books, An Alien Harvest and the 2-volume Glimpsesof Other Realities in the Earthfiles Shop.· 04/28/2005 -- Dozens of Unidentified Aerial Objects Videotaped Over Sonora,California· 04/17/2005 -- 1949 Aerial Disc Covered-Up By Project Blue Book As \"Kite\"· 04/14/2005 -- \"Battle of Los Angeles,\" February 25, 1942· 04/13/2005 -- Highly Strange Dog Death in Arkansas; 2000-Pound Bull Dropped On LogPile· 03/08/2005 -- Flying Disc Paced Airliner Over Puget Sound Navy Yard· 02/21/2005 -- Update d - Bull and Cow Mutilations Northwe st of Corpus Christi, Te xas· 01/15/2005 -- Bull and Cow Mutilations Northwe st of Corpus Christi, Te xas· 12/10/2004 -- Part 3: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation?· 12/10/2004 -- Part 4: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation?· 10/29/2004 -- Part 2: Update On Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia, UFO Case.· 09/06/2004 -- Part 1: Terry Sherman - 1996 Interview About High Strangeness on FortDuche sne , Utah Ranch · 09/06/2004 -- Part 2: Terry Sherman - 1996 Interview AboutHigh Strangeness on Fort Duchesne, Utah Ranch· 08/29/2004 -- Another Pictogram in Poland· 08/09/2004 -- Pictograms in Poland· 07/07/2004 -- Fourth 2004 Crop Formation in Poland Has Multiple Parts· 06/17/2004 -- More 2004 Holland and Poland Crop Formations· 06/03/2004 -- Updated - Second 2004 Pictogram Crop Formation in Poland· 05/19/2004 -- Why Ball Lightning Does Not Explain Facts in Mexico Air Force Infraredand Radar Eve nt· 05/17/2004 -- Update d - Crop Formation Re porte d in Zabno, Poland· 02/14/2004 -- More High Strange ne ss in the Michigan Sky· 02/06/2004 -- Unidentified Aerial Objects - Again! - Over Michigan· 01/19/2004 -- Earthfiles and Radio Audience Feedback About Anomalous Sky Objects· 01/17/2004 -- High Strangene ss in the Napole on, Michigan Sky· 01/17/2004 -- Update on Horton, Michigan Ice Circle· 01/10/2004 -- Strange Unidentified Aerial Objects in Indiana and Pennsylvania· 10/17/2003 -- 2003 \"UFO Flap\" in Ohio· 04/22/2003 -- UFO Expe rie nce s Re porte d by Fore st Fire Lookouts· 02/01/2003 -- Six Unidentified Triangular Aerial Craft Over Uinta Mountains, Utah· 01/14/2003 -- Part 2: Cape Girardeau and Charlette Mann's 1991 Letter About HerG randfathe r's Expe rie nce"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"· 11/03/2002 -- Strange Light Triggered Magnetic Alarm and Was Photographed inMontre al, Canada· 04/17/2002 -- Part 2 - Unidentified Aerial Craft Over Farmington and Aztec, NewMexico in Spring 1949· 03/16/2002 -- Part 1 - 'Huge Saucer Armada' Shocked Farmington, New Mexico 52Ye ars Ago· 01/19/2002 -- Nine Unidentified Aerial Objects Tracked at 8,000 mph on 1952 Radar· 02/06/2000 -- Large Yellow Sphere In Snohomish, Washington· 12/26/1999 -- Hubble Repair, Gamma Ray Bursts and Unidentified Aerial Objects· 12/22/1999 -- Update - Unidentified \"Arrowhead\"-Shaped Object in California Sky· 06/28/1999 -- Anothe r 90-Degre e Ae rial Turn Associate d with Contrail· 04/09/1999 -- Strange Lights In MissouriWebsites:JAL 1628 Over Alaska: http://www.ufoevidence.org/cases/case287.htmPhysicist Bruce Maccabee JAL Analysis: http://brumac.8k.com/JAL1628/JL1628.htmlMajestic 12 Documents: http://www.majesticdocuments.comAmerican Presidents: http://www.presidentialufo.com Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
