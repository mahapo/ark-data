November 2, 2005 Moortown, Dartmoor, England - In the 1970s, counties in southernEngland including Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Dorset, Wiltshire and Hampshire hadhundreds of people reporting strange, unidentified lights in the sky and on the ground;humanoids - tall and short; cattle herds being mysteriously transported at night from onefarm to another (The Dyfed Enigma © 1979 by Randall Jones Pugh and F. W. Holiday);and unusual, bloodless animal deaths often referred to as \"mutilations\" because the sametissues are excised from animal to animal. Often it's an ear, an eye, the jaw flesh, thetongue removed deep within the throat sometimes along with trachea and esophagus; all orparts of genitals; and rectal and/or vaginal tissue cored out in deep, bloodless holes. Now in a second round of animal mutilations there in 2005, six sheep were found October14 to 15 dead and bloodlessly excised on a farm in Moortown straight east of Tavistock inDartmoor. The Dartmoor Forest National Park has long been famous for mysterious lightsand sounds. One famous case in the region was in 1977 when more than a dozen ponieswere found laid down in a circle, all their bodies crushed by an unknown force. Becausethe horses were laid in a circle, the event was linked to the disc-shaped UFOs that wereseen so frequently at the time. Earlier this year, there were seven other sheep mutilations in Moortown. The BBC newsreported on January 13, 2005, Black Magick On Dartmoor.\"Dead sheep found in 'occult star.' Police in Devon (southern U.K. county) areinvestigating after seven sheep were found dead and arranged in an unusual patternon Dartmoor. The sheep were found near Sampford Spiney (a little south ofMoortown in map above) in Dartmoor County with their necks broken and theirbodies in a pattern sometimes associated with the occult. The pattern was similar tothe shape of a star, a heptagram, a mystical symbol sometimes used in occultceremonies.\"[ Editor's Note:"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Heptagon is a 7-sided star polygon. ]hris Cole, one of three farmers who owned the animals, said he thought itwas lightning because 'that's what happens when any big group of animals dieslike that.' He said when he discovered the animals were left in the seven-pointed shape, 'It scared some people and alarmed others, me included, beingthis close to home. I don't really know what's happened.'\" However, contrary to the BBC report, when you look at the two photographs below thatone farm owner took of the January 2005 sheep deaths, there does not appear to be anyseven star-shaped pattern in the way the animals' bodies were scattered in the field.Five of the seven dead and mutilated sheep found on January 2, 2005. There is no heptagonal patternand one wonders why the BBC suggested a 7-pointed star and an occult connectionwithout evidence?

He is Michael Freebury,Financial Controller, Moreland Construction, Ltd., Walsall, West Midlands, England.Interview: Michael Freebury, Financial Controller, Moreland Construction Ltd., Walsall, WestMidlands, England: \"First, on October 14, 2005, four sheep were discovered killed on theproperty of one of the same farm owners victimized on January 2, 2005. Strange though itseems, the next day on Tuesday, October 15, 2005, two more dead and mutilated sheepwere found in another field not far away next to a road. All six sheep had their necksbroken. So, I asked the lady who owned the sheep in Moortown if she would please go andcheck the mouths and tell me if there were any tongues missing. She did check and thetongues had been excised from all six sheep in just the same sort of fashion that hasoccurred in other animal mutilations such as the ones you've reported about, Linda.What's amazing is that those first seven mutilated sheep in Moortown, Dartmoor, inJanuary 2005 all had their necks twisted and broken. Now ten months later, these sixsheep in October 2005 - also in Moortown - have their necks twisted and broken, too.I spoke to the vet at some length about this and he stated in his opinion that he knewinstances in which sheep had their necks broken through rearing up and the head twisting.But to happen seven times was 'absolutely extraordinary.' Those are his words, not mine.Then to happen again to six sheep!?DID THE VET EXAMINE ANY OF THE MUTILATED ANIMALS?He made the comment there was no blood. This is what astonished the people becausethere was no blood anywhere in either group of bizarre killings in January or now inOctober 2005.There is another thing as well regarding the two sheep that were found dead on Saturday,October 15. On one of the sheep, the eye that was showing had been completely removed.And on the other dead sheep, both eyes had been removed. If the sheep was lying down,you can't explain the bottom missing eye as the work of predators. The farmer himself saidto me: 'I've never seen anything like that before.' Remember, these are people who havefarmed sheep all their lives and know everything there is to know about sheep and naturalpredators of sheep.DID THE MOORTOWN FARM OWNER SEE OR HEAR ANYTHING UNUSUAL INTHE SKY?Nothing unusual at all. This is one of the strange things: the first set of killings in January2005, took place in an area that was really only 100 yards or so from a farm where therewere very alert dogs and a rookery. The rooks are well known for raising an alarm whenthere is unusual activity. It's quite extraordinary how the mutilators could have interactedwith the sheep and nobody knew what the hell was going on! It's really, really strange.Time and time again, we have these stories where the mutilators come, they do the killingsand are gone again, but nobody sees or hears anything. The police have not a clue. Theysent a forensic team to look at the one set of bodies. Now, I haven't spoken to the police. Idon't know what it's like in the United States, but in Britain the police will tell you nothing.WERE THERE ANY SIGNS OF STRUGGLE ON THE GROUND?No, no tracks. There were some stones allegedly placed which people are claiming gavesome sort of occult significance, but to be honest, we're in an area where witchcraft haslong been discussed and many strange things have happened. It's not far from the majortown of Tavistock, which is a very nice market town. But the area where the sheep killingsoccurred is extremely remote."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE DARTMOOR AREA THAT MAKES IT THE FOCUS OFUNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHS SINCE AT LEAST THE 1970s?It's very difficult to say because I have been wracking my brain to think what the commondenominator is. But I have a very good idea who is doing this.DO YOU MEAN EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES?Well, you can draw your own conclusions.THAT'S WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS TOLD ME OVER THE PAST THREEDECADES IN THIS COUNTRY ON AND OFF THE RECORD.You are not off the mark with that. I cannot understand what else could do it.WHAT IS THE AGENDA? WHY THE FOCUS OVER AND OVER DECADE AFTERDECADE IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHICALAREAS?It might have something to do with the terrain. I don't know. Dartmoor is very remote. Sois Shropshire, closer to me, where there have been a number of animal mutilations close tothe Welsh border, which is also remote and mountainous. We've also had mutilations inScotland and North Yorkshire. The common denominator with these killings appears to bethat the animal victims, particularly in England, appear to be sheep which are free ranginganimals.I don't know whether that is a key to the attacks. Sometimes they can be attacked in fieldsor ranging on open moor land. I am confused by the fact that in the U.S, the animalsattacked appear to be principally cattle and horses. But are those cattle and horses rangingover a large area?THE CATTLE USUALLY ARE RANGE ANIMALS, BUT NOT THE HORSES. IN THEUNITED STATES, EVEN THOUGH CATTLE HAVE PREDOMINATED, HORSESWERE THE FIRST REPORTED MUTILATED ANIMALS IN CANADA AND THEN INCOLORADO BEFORE ANY REPORTS OF CATTLE.[ Editor's Note: The pet horse, Lady, was killed and mutilated in September1967 near Alamosa, Colorado. See An Alien Harvest © 1989 by LindaMoulton Howe in Earthfiles Shop. ]AGAIN, WHY THE SPECIFIC AREAS? THE ANIMALS ARE NOT ALWAYS THESAME TYPE, BUT THE SAME GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS ARE AFFECTED.That's right. Are they looking at animals that are hardy animals that can live in roughterrain? Is that the key?THAT WOULD NOT EXPLAIN THE CASES IN WHICH PEOPLE HAVE FOUNDTHEM 30 FEET OUTSIDE THE BACK OF THEIR RANCH HOUSE IN CORRALS. [Mutilated horse in Cripple Creek, Colorado, 1980. ]Yes. It's extremely difficult and complex to know what is really going on there, but it is amajor problem here in the U. K. They are trying to keep a lid on it. The government won'tadmit anything.LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS HERE TEND TO SHY AWAY FROM ANYEXPLANATION EXCEPT SATANIC CULT, PREDATORS AND DISEASE, EVEN"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"WHEN THEY KNOW IT'S NOT TRUE.Right, and in England what we tend to have is either explanations of the occult or anescaped panther or an escaped lion or something like that.BUT I KNOW FROM STUDYING WHAT THOSE TYPES OF CATS DO TO ALLKINDS OF ANIMALS THAT THEY ALWAYS LEAVE CLAW MARKS AND BITEMARKS AND BLOOD.Yes. This is the thing, there is no blood with these cases. It's almost like a vampire attack. I had been working on the April 1977 case in which fifteen ponies were found crushed.They were found mangled, broken legs, broken backs. Apparently there was very rapiddecomposition. It was a very interesting case because it was reported quite rapidly in theU. K. press. Then the case suddenly died. It's very difficult to find anything, even on theinternet about that particular case.Then about four years ago, I was listening to BBC Radio and there was a discussion aboutgovernment secrecy. During the program, it was mentioned about the incident onDartmoor with the fifteen ponies and the fact that the incident was a major Britishgovernment cover-up. So, I picked up on this and decided I would investigate it furtherwhich I have done since.As a result of that investigation, I have started to look at other cases of strange animaldeaths within the Dartmoor area. In February of this year, I was told by somebody whowas monitoring news reports that there had been some unusual sheep killings in theDartmoor area. So, I went through the newspapers and managed to pick up the BBCcommuniqué about it which was put down as an occult killing.A few weeks passed before I had a chance to go to Dartmoor and interview people whohad seen the January 2, 2005, sheep bodies as well as owners who had lost the sheep.There were three farmers involved in those seven sheep deaths. The press and the TV neither of which had bothered to go to the scene of the crime described the sheep as beinglaid out in an heptagonal (7-pointed star) shape. I had a body map done, which was acomposite of various eyewitness reports. I have to tell you that it's nothing like a heptagon.Those killings, in my opinion, had nothing to do with the occult. There was no blood. Thenecks had all been broken.Something else to all of this: the sheep prior to death were actually corralled in two verysmall areas about six yards apart. They were held in those areas for what must have beentwenty minutes to half an hour. We know that from the ground - the tracks indicated howlong the sheep had been there. It also appears each sheep was taken and killed one-by-one.It's extraordinary from the tracks that the sheep had been contained within two areas andyet there were no indications that the sheep had panicked and struggled to get away. Theyhad obviously been sedated in some way. All seven sheep also had some sort of marks onthem prod marks.WHEN YOU SAY PROD MARKS, I THINK OF EITHER A HOLE OR BURNING?It was not burning. The vet was very confused about this, but he said he thought it wassomething to do with a sharp instrument.TO DO WHAT ON THEM?This is what I found very confusing. We've seen other similar markings on other mutilationcases where there has been a small bruising on the animals underneath the soft tissueunderneath the legs. Those seven sheep in January 2005 had those markings."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"ALL UNDERNEATH THE FRONT LEGS.Underneath the front and rear legs., underneath all four legs.WERE YOU ABLE TO CONFIRM IF THERE WAS A PUNCTURE HOLE IN THEMONE-QUARTER INCH IN DIAMETER EXTENDING AN INCH INTO THE BODY INANY OF THOSE MARKS?I could not do that unfortunately. By the time I went down to investigate, which wasactually the first of April 2005. Keep in mind, this happened nearly four months earlier inearly January. So, it was a cold case and I was relying on the witnesses and theirrecollections of the time.But there was another dimension to this. That was an eighth sheep that escaped and it wasfound in a gully and it was deeply traumatized. It had the same markings as the seven deadsheep, but it was traumatized enough to bolt and ran across a cattle grid, which isabsolutely incredible! That sheep was not discovered for 24 hours. It never ate and it wasin a very distressed state. Whatever it witnessed must have been quite horrific.Those are basically the circumstances of the seven dead sheep that were found on January2, 2005. This was largely put down as an occult sect that had done this and many peoplefelt that was what had happened. But I had my doubts because there were certain aspectsof it which could not be explained. I then warned the people in the area, 'They will beback.' I said, 'If it happens again, you must call me.' And ten months later in October, ithappened all over again.\"More information:I would appreciate receiving any similar reports or information from Earthfiles viewersabout unusual animal deaths in your area.
