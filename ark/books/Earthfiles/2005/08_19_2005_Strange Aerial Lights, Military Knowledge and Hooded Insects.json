Alice Springs is the nearest town to the AmericanNational Security Agency (NSA) facility at the center of Australia which listens toand satellite-observes the Earth. Northward 387 kilometers (240 miles) is Wauchope. A bit southof Wauchope is Wycliffe Wells, so small that it's not printed on most maps,but is famous for unidentified aerial sightings. August 19, 2005 Wycliffe Well, Northern Territory, Australia - The beginning ofAugust, a group of aboriginals living in the community of Ali Curung at the center ofAustralia, reported seeing a \"huge orange ball\" that hovered in the air for at least 20minutes before jet fighters showed up and chased the unidentified object away.That aboriginal community is not far from a place called Wycliffe Well, about 11 miles (18kilometers) south of Wauchope in the Northern Territory. This week I called, Lew Farkas,the owner of the Wycliffe Well Holiday Park. Wycliffe Well has been famous for decadesof unidentified aerial phenomenon sightings. Mr. Farkas said he did not see the recentorange light chased by the jets. But he says he has seen jets on other occasions show upwhen unidentified aerial objects are around. He does not know what is triggering the jets toarrive with aggression toward aerial objects. But Mr. Farkas does not accept the perennial"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"official explanation of \"military exercises.\"Mr. Farkas has also seen through his own binoculars a silver disk that had round portholes.One of his summer employees recently saw a strange sky object. Joy Jones worked in theWycliffe Well kitchen the past four months. A couple of weeks ago before sunrise, she sawan aerial object emitting beams of light.Interview:Joy Jones, part-time employee of Wycliffe Well Holiday Park, Northern Territory,Australia: \"I seen a space ship. It came over Wycliffe Well at 4 o'clock in the morning.That's when I got up to go to the toilet. There was a real bright light over my caravan.WAS IT ORANGE?No, it was sort of a bluey-white.HOW BIG WAS IT?It was quite big and the spaceship had lights coming from the bottom down, and there wasa real bright light on the top. And it was real red color.WAS THE LIGHT COMING DOWN...Like rays coming down from the bottom of it.DID THE RAYS GO ALL THE WAY TO THE GROUND?No.SO HOW HIGH ABOVE YOU DO YOU THINK IT WAS?Quite high. I tried to take a photo because it was too dark.HOW LONG WAS IT THERE?I don't know because I went back to the caravan and shut the door! (laughs)WERE YOU AFRAID OF SOMETHING?I don't know, but I went back and shut me door!\"\"Insect\" Wearing Hooded RobeBrownsville and Uniontown are in Washington County,south of Pi ttsburgh, Pennsyl vani a.August 19, 2005 Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania - This week I also talked to aneyewitness of a burnt orange-colored, cigar-shaped aerial object. But this sighting was inthe Brownsville and Uniontown area of Washington County south of Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania. The year was 1961, the beginning of a decade famous for UFO flaps and thebeginning reports of what came to be known as the \"human abduction syndrome.\" Theeyewitness was 11-year-old Annamarie Lacey, who is now 55-years-old. She says she hashad encounters with hooded \"insect entities\" she now calls \"greys.\"Back on a hot August evening in 1967 when she was seventeen, Annamarie went with herstepfather, mother and two sisters outside their house after her stepfather heard what hethought was the droning sound of a low-flying airplane."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Interview:Annamarie Lacey, 55-year-old housewife married 35 years, Huntingdon County,Pennsylvania: \"My mother and I were downstairs watching the 11 o'clock news. Thefamily was upstairs: two sisters and my dad, already tucked up in bed. My dad called downthe stairs to my mum to ask her to turn the volume down on the TV. He said he thought heheard something like a plane in distress. Years ago he had his pilot license and he flewsome planes. So, we turned the TV down and dad stepped into his trousers and came downstairs. He thought he would go outside for a listen and a look. We all followed him outside.We could hear this like droning noise at a distance and it got closer.When we looked up, immediately above the rooftop, it looked like an old plane, like an oldWWII plane engulfed in flames. You could hear sirens and whistles and all kinds of things.My dad was real agitated. He said, 'Oh, my God, this thing is going to go down!'Then everything got kind of strange, like it all slowed down. I could see instead of theplane, would be like something rounded like a dome more. At that time, I called themportals instead of windows. There were like seven of them and standing, staring - enoughto make your blood run cold! - were these entities, beings, which I now have identified aswhat I think are greys. They were in scuba diving outfits. No emotion, nothing, just staringdown.My dad said, 'Look, look, it's going to go down! It's going to crash!' We waited and waitedand it just kind of drifted off. It did not hit the ground or anything. There was no impact.We stayed there for awhile.My dad said, 'Well, we'll hear about this in the news tomorrow in the newspapers or on thenews somewhere.' But nobody. No neighbors, no newspapers, nothing. We were it.DO YOU THINK IT WAS LIKE A THEATRICAL PRODUCTION OF SOME SORT ONTHE PART OF THE GREYS?I don't think I ever thought of it that way. I don't know.IN TERMS OF YOUR LIFE LONG EXPERIENCE WITH THE CLOAKED INSECTENTITIES, WOULD YOU THINK THIS WAS BEING DONE FOR SOME PURPOSE TOTEST YOU ALL?I suppose it could have been, maybe to raise an awareness. I never did understand why allof us would have seen that.DID YOU AND YOUR OTHER SISTERS AND MOM AND STEPDAD TALK ABOUTTHESE GREY BEINGS AT THE PORTALS?No. No.WHY NOT?I'm not sure. It was just like not the thing to do. Sort of like years later in experiences withthem, you knew not to talk. It was just a given. You didn't say what you saw and did. Youknew not to talk and that came from the greys, like as if it were a secret between you andthem.WOULD THAT IMPLY THEN THAT THE DEMONSTRATION EVEN THOUGH THEREST OF YOUR FAMILY SAW IT WAS FOR YOU AND YOU ALONE? Hooded \"Insect\" Creature in 1990I don't know. It might have been. I don't know. I have a lot of 'I don't knows'unfortunately. There were numbers of little oddities at that time leading up to this other bigevent in 1990.TALK ABOUT THAT IN DETAIL.OK, I had been out Christmas shopping. At that time, my oldest daughter had already lefthome and my youngest daughter was 17. My husband was sleeping in our room. I came inwith a bunch of packages and that was before the cash registers had the itemized tape onthem. I had just purchased a new Hallmark Christmas cassette and I thought, 'I'll play thismusic and write on the back of the cash tapes what the purchases were. Then if I need toreturn anything, fine.' So, I began to fumble with the cellophane on the container. I was inthe living room and this was a small 4-room bungalow. I walked through the doorway into"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"the kitchen where the cassette player was on the counter top. I'm still fumbling with thecellophane and walked over absentmindedly to the trash which was sitting by thebasement door.Not thinking of anything, I began to become aware of this golden glow. I thought, 'Didthey go to bed and leave the basement door open with the upper light on?' When I turnedto look, I thought that doesn't make sense because the door swings shut. When I turned tolook, there was no door. There was just space and this thing standing there in a robe. I say'thing' an insect in a robe. Later, I knew it was a grey. But I didn't know what it was at thattime. It had rough skin that looked dry and parched. Huge, watery ant eyes, slanted at anangle. Two little dots for a nose and a tiny slash for a mouth. Instantly, I wanted to bolt!The robe, it had its hood up. It had hands, so to speak, in front of it and there was like abelt made out of rope that was tied like you would see a monk. I didn't see feet. Judgingfrom me I'm not quite 5 feet tall and I would say he was about even in height with me.Hooded grey entities were also described by V. M., adult male, after September 1985encounter in New Hope, Pennsylvania. Source: Glimpses of Other Realities,Vol. I: Facts & Eyewitnesses © 1994 by Linda Moulton Howe.WHAT ABOUT COLORS OF THE ROBE AND SO FORTH?The brown was brownish color. The skin on this entity was like a greyish-greenish-dull-looking, dead-looking kind of skin. Very dry looking. I want to say I was about 3 feetfrom this thing. I wanted to turn and run. I nearly vomited, I was so sickened. I wasterrified. I started to shake. I thought I was going to die from a heart attack. I wanted tofall down on the ground and crawl out of the room and I could not. I was stuck right therelike glue was under my feet or something.The moment I had the thought how repulsive it was, a thought came back in my head that Ihad offended it. That freaked me out because I'm thinking, 'How could I offend an insect?!'Then another thought came back that I was being very offensive. I found myself saying inmy head to this thing, 'I'm sorry, but I want out of here.' And I could not move. I'mthinking this encounter lasted two or three minutes, tops. And 45 minutes later, I foundmyself on the opposite side of the kitchen. I was on the floor and this entity was saying tome that 'they' would be back. They were going away on a mission and they would be back.I shook so bad and was so violently ill. I could not speak, I couldn't move. I crawled intothe living room and I tried to call out and my daughter said, 'What's wrong?' I said, 'Comehere!' She said, 'I can't. I'm sleeping.' I crawled into her room and crawled up on top of herbed and started screaming and crying. She said, 'What's going on, Mom?' I said, 'I don'tknow. I saw something really horrible. I don't know what to do about it. Help me.'Call 'Gram.' My mother is very religious.So, I called my mother first. I thought she would (dismiss it), but she shocked me. She said,'Well, you've seen something.' I said, 'No, mom, you don't get it. You don't see somethinglike that! There's just no way! I've lost my mind.' She said, 'No, I don't think so.' She said,'Why don't you tonight ask God that if it be his will to give you a sign and show you whatit is and you'll get comfort and have a dream.' So, I said, 'Alright. I'm sorry I got you up.'By now, it was past midnight.I couldn't really sleep. I shook. I was convinced that they (insects) were in the housesomewhere just waiting to come out again. I knew if I saw them again I was going to dieright there. I just knew it.So, close to daylight around 6:30 to 7 a.m., I did lie down. I did not wake my husband upbecause he's very skeptical. He's not open minded about any of this. I knew there would be"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"no comfort there. So, I toughed it out. I knew my daughter couldn't help and there was nosense in frightening her. So, I went off to sleep and I did indeed have a dream. What I sawwas this big open field. In the distance, maybe 200 yards in the distance was thisegg-shaped glowing orb kind of thing just glowing like a light bulb. In the forefront, weretwo of these things I had seen. But they didn't have robes on. They had like lab coats andthey were taking botanical clippings of all the different plants. I jumped up and ran to thephone, called my mother and said, 'I did have a dream!' She said, 'What was it?' I told herand she said, 'See, they are just scientists.'I said, 'Mom, you don't get it. Scientists from what world? Come on, Mom?'WHEN THE INSECT BEING THAT WAS CLOAKED AND HOODED APPEARED INFRONT OF YOU, WAS HE SURROUNDED BY AN ORANGE LIGHT?It was a golden-amber kind of light, yes, he stood in that.DID YOU HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE BEING WAS FLOATING IN THEAIR?Not at the time. For some reason, I never looked down to see feet or the end of thehemline of the robe. I just never thought to look down. I was transfixed by his eyes. It wasas if he told me two phrases then that I never knew before then. He said 'thoughttransference,' that's what he said he was able to do with me to communicate. And the otherthing was 'mind scan.' Because I was very disturbed that he could look inside of me andthere was no way I could lie. I don't lie anyway. I have no pretext, nothing. I was totallyvulnerable with him. He knew everything about me and that really blew my mind. \"Insect\" Creatures Monitoring Some People from Birth?WHAT WAS IT THAT YOU SENSED HE KNEW ABOUT YOU THAT MEANTSOMETHING TO HIM?What did he know about me? I saw pictures in my head when he was telling me things. Ihad flashes of when I was little. I saw myself. He was showing me that way. It was, 'Oh,my God, how would he know that?' For example, when I was maybe 2 years old andplaying outdoors with a playmate, I have a vivid recall of that. He showed me and it scaredme. I remember trying to jump back a little bit. It really frightened me that he knew that.My mind was going a thousand miles a minute and I'm thinking, 'How could you knowthat?'WHY THOUGH? WHY WAS THE INSECT MONITORING YOU FROM BEING BORNTHROUGH CHILDHOOD?I have no clue at all. But this is where it gets really complicated. In the 1970s I found outthat my father was not my father, but my mother's second husband and I was neverformally adopted. My natural father was military, Pentagon. I met him on June 17, 1974. Itwas not a good relationship. He was not someone I liked. But I remember something thathappened very vividly. I lived in Belvernon, PA at the time in a farm house. And hebrought his wife with him to visit. My kids were very little at the time. Military Father Figure - Hybridization Program?We were standing at the end of an aisle. I don't know why I did this, but I did. There hadbeen like a UFO flap and one of the tabloids had something and I pointed to it and said,'Look at this. What do you think about this?' He looked at it and he said, 'You know what,I'm not going to answer your question and I suggest you don't bring it up again.'I thought, 'How strange!'DID YOU ASK HIM WHY?I did ask him why and he would not say anything about it at all. There is a wholemysterious thing there. He died in 1996 (when Annamarie was 46-years-old). I have somany big question marks. I'm not allowed to talk about this with anybody in my family. It'sa big, deep dark secret.Back in 1973, my grandmother actually gave me his name and told me he's in a militarybranch when my mother first disclosed to me that I was not my dad's child. I was 23 at thetime. My mother called me over one day and said she had something to tell me. I thoughtmy husband had gotten injured at the mill and my stepdad was sitting there crying. My"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"sisters were sitting in the kitchen and I walked in and thought, 'What is this?' And my momjust blurted it out. I asked, 'Who is he?' And she said, 'You don't need to know. But I can'tlive half a lie anymore.' She was very involved with the religious church.I said, 'Who is it?' And I went to my grandmother, my mother's mother. She said, 'I've beenwaiting for you to ask me that.' She gave me a little painted picture of him in a militaryoutfit.WHICH MILITARY UNIFORM WAS IN THE PICTURE?At that time, it looked like Air Force. But the strange, mysterious part of this is I actuallyhave photos of him in other military uniforms as well. There is a picture of him in Franceand he looks like he's in Army clothes. This particular picture with the oil painting lookslike he's in the Air Force. I have no idea.THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR INTELLIGENCE (WHO WEAR VARIETYOF MILITARY UNIFORMS DEPENDING UPON INTEL ASSIGNMENTS) ...Yes, I found out later that's what was told to me that he was. He is buried in ArlingtonCemetery. I've never seen his grave. He is buried there in a mausoleum, supposedly withhigh military honors. He had been cremated. 1974: Annamarie Taken UndergroundPentagon, Washington, D. C.IF YOUR FATHER WAS WORKING FOR INTELLIGENCE AND LET'S ASSUMETHAT HE KNEW ABOUT THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL PRESENCE...I think he knew real well about it.YEAH, THEN I WONDER IF THIS IS PART OF WHAT HAS BEEN HINTED AT INOTHER CASES OF HYBRIDIZATION WITH KNOWLEDGE BY PEOPLE IN OURMILITARY?I wonder about it. And I'll tell you why. You tell me this this is one of the biggest thing. I'msorry if I start to cry because it's hard for me. (cries) He took me to the Pentagon. You'retalking of a girl that at that time was 23 years old. I had never been anywhere, had neverflown. And he sent me an airline ticket to come down. I was very impressed. I thought,'Oh, my Gosh, I'm going to the Pentagon and to D. C. I was all caught up in this, like awhirlwind thing.We grew up in abject poverty, very, very poor. When I got down there, his whole worldwas vacations frequently in Peru and Bolivia. They had little niches in the walls with theselittle artifacts that they would bring back, antiquities. They had a diamond collection, theyhad a stamp collection, they had 3 cars, they lived in a very nice house outside of D. C.They lived a life totally different than mine. I was caught up in that. I thought, 'Oh, mygod, how impressive!'We get there, he pins on a photo I. D. of me that I never posed for. I'm thinking, 'Howcould he do that? That's me on that photograph, but how could he do that?' It had a clip onit and he put it right on the front of my blouse.We got in an elevator and we were going to go down to where I thought we were going tohis office. I counted 17 floors and my mind was just boggled! I did not know there wasanything beneath the Pentagon. I didn't know it. I counted 17 floors and the elevatorpopped open. And he said, 'When you step out of the elevator, step forward and with yourleft hand, put it on that screen.'And there was this podium kind of thing and I remember stepping out and took my lefthand and put it on the screen. Now what we know to be thermographics? It lit up like agreenish kind of thing and all of this digital stuff came off to the side of the screen and saidall kinds of stuff. The turnstile made a click and he said, 'Go through.'I was standing there and I know my jaw was on the floor, like 'Oh, my God, what is this?'And I looked around and there were golf carts, there was a post office, a barber shop,there was a world in there. 'Oh, my God, we're underground.' And this I was justmesmerized.DID HE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT?He didn't. He did not say a doggone word. He did not even look at me. He knew I was just"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"bowled over. He said, 'Walk with me.' And I got the creeps at this point because wewalked down these long corridors and every 12 feet was an MP with a gun and the wholething standing at full military attention.On the walls were these life-sized portraits of like Eisenhower and all these portraits of allthese military heroes. He said, 'Stop right there. You don't have clearance to go any fartherthan this.'\"So why did the military father figure take Annamarie to the Pentagon at all? Were otherinterested military eyes watching her through cameras in the underground city? IsAnnamarie Lacey a human/ET hybrid? When I asked her that question directly, she aidshe did not know. But before her military \"father\" died in 1996, he had shown her oldbooks about ESP, telepathy and telekinesis and asked her to read them. She did not knowwhy and told him, as a mother of young children, she did not have time. To this day shewonders if he was part of a hybridization program that some in the U.S. governmentapproved in an exchange agreement with ETs for their advanced technologies?Annamarie Lacey: \" IF THERE WAS A HYBRIDIZATION PROGRAM GOING ONBETWEEN A CERTAIN TYPE OF NON-HUMAN THE INSECTS WEARING THECLOAKS IN COOPERATION FOR AWHILE WITH PEOPLE IN OURGOVERNMENT, WHY WOULD OUR GOVERNMENT HAVE GONE ALONG WITHTHIS, DO YOU THINK?In exchange for technology. But I think it got out of hand. The government knows thatsome of us are in touch with them (ETs). They want to control it and it's out of control.OUT OF CONTROL IN WHAT WAY?That the ETs can access people like me and the government can't really stop it at thispoint. I think they are fascinated that there is something with the psyche in some peoplethat can be accessed. I think for the government this is one of the key elements of theirresearch the aura, psychic ability, intuitive ability.HAVE THE BEINGS EVER SHOWN YOU ANYTHING ON A WALL OR SCREENTHEY HAVE IDENTIFIED AS BEING A FUTURE OF THE EARTH IN SOME WAY?The only thing they have shown me of the future was the oil situation. I was shown a giantleg and foot and it came down on a trickle of oil and squashed it and I was shown this inthe early 1990s. The foot squished the oil supply like it would be cut off. I was shown ascreeching halt to all the trucks being able to move. There were no vegetables in the storesbecause we were so dependent on the oil (for transportation).And all these years have passed and we are just now seeing all the effects of the oilsituation. I kind of thought it was just a lie, but now I'm really wondering.COULD IT POSSIBLY BE LIKE A CLOCK, LIKE A SIGNAL GOING OFF THAT IFYOU SAW THIS IMPRESSION FROM THE NON-HUMANS USING A FOOT AS AMETAPHOR ON THE OIL, AND THAT IS HAPPENING TODAY IN 2005, DO YOUTHINK THAT INDICATES WE ARE GETTING CLOSE TO SOMETHING ELSEHAPPENING WITH THE ETs?I know we are. I feel it with every fiber in my being that something huge is happening.\"More Information:Cloning, ET/human hybridiziation, energy transfers between human and ET bodycontainers are detailed in my book, Glimpses of Other Reality, Vol. II: High Strangenessin Earthfiles Shop.Other reports about cloning issues are in the Earthfiles Archives.· 05/23/2004 -- Part 2: Whistleblower Microbiologist Dan Burisch Interview on June7, 2003· 09/15/2003 -- Part 3 - Whistleblower Microbiologist Speaks Out About Alleged\"Alien\" Named J-Rod· 09/15/2003 -- Part 2 - Whistleblower Microbiologist Speaks Out About Alleged\"Alien\" Named J-Rod· 02/03/2003 -- Part 5: Brian Scott Case and Red-Haired ET Link Between LakeTiticaca and Easter Island· 01/23/2003 -- Clonaid VP Wouldn't Confirm Existence of Clonaid's \"Cloned Baby\"Before Florida Judge"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"· 01/04/2003 -- The Clonaid Human Cloning Controversy· 04/01/2001 -- Congressional Hearing Asks: Should Privately Funded HumanCloning Be Banned in U.S.?Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
