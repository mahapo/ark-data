The Gulf of Mexico was about 2 degrees F. (1 deg. C.)warmer than normal when Katrina, imaged above, went from a Category 1 to Cat 5 between August 26 andAugust 28, 2005,before slamming into the Gulf Coast as a Category 4 on August 29, 2005.

October 7, 2005 Princeton, New Jersey - This week a research scientist at NOAA'sClimate Diagnostics Center at the University of Colorado in Boulder, talked to me aboutthe latest Atlantic Ocean surface temperatures he has analyzed. Dr. Klaus Wolter told methat in August 2005, before Hurricane Katrina hit land on August 29, the Gulf of Mexicosea surface temperatures were the warmest on record going back a hundred years.Further, never in weather records have two Category 5 hurricanes (see hurricane scale inMore Information below) occurred within three weeks of each other in the same hurricaneseason and on the same path. Dr. Wolter told me, \"It's very unique to have two Category 5storms together and in the same place. But the water west of Florida was really warm, andwarm deep down. We measured 79 degrees F. to a depth of 150 meters.\"Think of a football field and turn it on end down into the water. A huge area was 79degrees F. all the way down 150 meters just west of Florida and the Keys. That's whatgave Katrina its intensity and what allowed Rita to become so strong, so quickly just threeweeks later (Sept. 20 when it first hit the Florida Keys). Fastest Forming Hurricanes On RecordDr. Wolter also analyzed a century of data to see how fast hurricanes have gone fromtropical storms to full blown hurricanes. Rita is the second fastest-forming hurricane onrecord going from a tropical depression to a Cat 1 hurricane in only 33 hours. The fastesttransformation was Hurricane Ethel in 1960 that took only 18 hours to become ahurricane. Also on the list of fastest forming hurricanes is Katrina in seventh place.

Hisdata on hurricane winds and duration show that the destructive power of North Atlanticstorm damage has nearly doubled since the mid-1970s. Dr. Emanuel also found fornorthwest Pacific storms, what he calls the \"Power Dissipation Index,\" increased about75%. He attributes the sharp jump to increases in storm duration as well as much largerthan expected increases in wind power.NOAA Hurricane Katrina regional imagery, August 28, 2005.Another scientist who works with computer climate models is Thomas Knutson, M. S., aresearch meteorologist at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton,New Jersey. Mr. Knutson sees evidence that global warming of sea surface temperaturesmight be equally as important now in hurricane intensities as the natural cycle known asthe Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation.Interview:Thomas Knutson, M. S., Research Meteorologist, NOAA's Geophysical FluidDynamics Laboratory, Princeton, New Jersey: \"First of all, globally 2005 is going to beone of the warmest years on record, if not THE warmest year on record globally. We're notthrough the year yet, but that's the way it's shaping up so far. If you look in the maindevelopment region in the tropical Atlantic, sea surface temperatures have been quitewarm all summer perhaps 1 to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2 plus degrees F.) above the normalsfor that region.I've also looked in that region using ten year averages for temperatures in that region andlooked at those going back into the late 1800s. The current ten year average in that regionis higher than anything else in the record. So we are at unprecedented high levels in termsof ten years average temperatures in this main development region of the TropicalAtlantic.DOES THAT MEAN THAT KATRINA, WHICH WAS SO STRONG, FOLLOWED BYRITA, AND THE FOUR HURRICANES LAST YEAR THAT THIS AN INTRODUCTIONTO A NEW INTENSITY OF HURRICANES?One thing we believe is going on in the Atlantic Basin in particular is an oscillation knownas the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation, where sea surface temperatures and other"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"conditions in the basin fluctuate on a time scale of several decades.However, our analysis of temperatures in that basin indicate that in addition to thisAtlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation, there also appears to be an underlying warming trendthat's going on. So, the two things together are operating. These very high temperatures wehave now are, according to this interpretation, are a combination of a warm phase of theAtlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation and this underlying warming trend, which appears to berather similar to the global average of warming trends. More Katrinas In the Future?IF THERE HAS BEEN A GENERAL TREND UPWARD FOR 50 YEARS AND WE'RELOOKING INTO THE 21ST CENTURY WITH COMPUTER WEATHER MODELSTHAT ARE INDICATING THAT CO2 IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO THICKEN ANDTHERE WILL BE RISING TEMPERATURES IS THE INTUITIVE CONCLUSIONTHAT THEREFORE HURRICANES WILL INEVITABLY BECOME STRONGER ANDTHERE WILL BE THE POTENTIAL FOR MORE KATRINAS A VALIDCONCLUSION?Well, we do believe that hurricane intensities are going to increase. But the question is:how much are they going to increase? That's a very difficult research question at this time.The suggestion from the MIT Emmanuel study is that the rate of increase in the past 50years or so has been quite dramatic.A second study came out just a few weeks ago in the journal, Science, and Prof. PeterWebster was the lead on that study with three co-authors. They found that when theylooked at the number of hurricanes in various categories occurring in the different basinsaround the world they are called typhoons in some other basins. The data shows between1990 and 2005 that the number of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes in all six basins (of theworld) increased, roughly doubling in number over that time. So this is a second piece ofobservational evidence suggesting an increase, and a fairly strong increase, in the intensityof hurricanes which is concurrent with sea surface temperature warming in those basins.IF HURRICANES IN THE SIZES OF 4 AND 5 HAVE BEEN INCREASING IN ALL SIXBASINS OF THE WORLD, DOESN'T IT RAISE A BIG RED FLAG ABOUT WHATTHE FUTURE MAY BRING AND HOW GOVERNMENTS COULD CONTINUE TOSUSTAIN PAYING FOR $200 BILLION DAMAGE HURRICANES EVERY YEAR?The study showing the increase in Categories 4 and 5 in all basins (of the world), thatstudy has also been criticized by some which think the data back in the earlier part of therecord is not reliable enough to draw the conclusions that were drawn. So, I think there isgoing to be a healthy debate going on between those who study the hurricane observationsto try to come to more of a consensus on whether these very rapid trends frankly,somewhat alarming trends showing up in the intensity measures are real or not.But there is at least a possibility that they are, so I think these studies need to be takenseriously and more study needs to be done to understand what's going on here.IF THE ALARMING TREND PERSISTS, WHAT DO YOU THINK THE WORST CASECOULD BE?One aspect of the global climate change problem that people need to keep in mind is thatit's a problem with very long time scales. Once the Earth warms in response to greenhousegases, the time scales in the climate system are so large that one should not expect us to beable to return things to sort of pre-warmed state in a short period of time. It's a very longtime scale.AND HURRICANES COULD, INSTEAD OF BEING ON A CYCLE, COULD BEINTENSE FOR A LONG TIME?I would point to Emmanuel's study showing these upward trends and I think there is someimplication in that study that that's at least a possibility.\"More Information:"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Hurricane intensity is measured using the Saffir-Simpson Scale, ranging from one (1) (minimal)to five (5) (catastrophic).
