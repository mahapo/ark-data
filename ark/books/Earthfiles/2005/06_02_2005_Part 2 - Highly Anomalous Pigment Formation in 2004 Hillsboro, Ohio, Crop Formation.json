Levengood, Biophysicist,Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory, Grass Lake, Michigan:Discussion of Major Findings (continuing from page 1 above): “The discovery of anthocyanin expression in maturing sweet corn was, as thesaying goes, \"completely off the chart.” The ear shown in Fig. 1, was removedfrom a plant in the downed area of the crop formation.

Thekernels on a normal, upright plant (control) in Fig. 2, help illustrate thestriking difference between normal kernels and the pigmentationanomaly.Figure 2 - Kernels on a normal ear (control sample) taken outsidethe Hillsboro crop formation.

Also, there did not appear tobe any directional effect, that is, the ears were uniformly pigmented onall sides. However, there were ears, as shown in Fig. 4 that receivedmuch reduced levels of energy application."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Figure 4 - This ear taken from the formation has a lesser degreeof pigmentation, but disclosed indentations at the top of the kernels.Photograph © 2004 by W. C. Levengood.Although only a faint trace of pigment appears at the top of some of theseeds in Fig. 4, it is important to note that most all kernels have apronounced indentation, an effect which is not observed in the Fig. 2control seeds. From previous observations, it becomes quite apparentthat this seed indentation is related to transient, internal heating. It isvery likely that the source of this energy was in the microwave region.This rapid, internal build up of heat causes moisture loss from theendosperm tissues within the seed. Internal shrinkage occurs and thetesta or outer seed coat collapsed inward, thus forming the indentedregion. This microwave heat shrinkage is quite apparent whencomparing Fig. 2, showing the tight, compacted kernels formed undernormal growth conditions, with Fig 1 and Fig 4 where one observesconsiderable space between the kernel rows.To even begin to understand the pigmentation effects on corn kernels, it isnecessary to consider the role of anthocyanin in plants. These flavonoid typemolecules protect the plant against photo inhibition or the impairment ofcertain biochemical pathways in normal photosynthesis. This impairment canoccur if light levels become too high. In leaves, anthocyanin is located in avery thin layer just under the outer epidermal cells. This same characteristicwas observed in the kernels taken from the Fig. 1 ear. Here also, the pigmentlayer was very thin and positioned just below the testa. Why Did Anthocyanin Form onHillsboro, Ohio Sweet Corn Kernels? Now, we arrive at the very interesting problems of determining the how andwhy the anthocyanin formed on the kernels of sweet corn. As stated above,one very important function of anthocyanin is to protect the internal,photosynthetic \"food factory\" from injury due to pulses of high light intensity,particularly light with wavelengths in the visible region. The real enigma hereis explaining the presence of this red pigment on kernels of corn, which arelocated under several layers of glumes (common name - \"husks\"). Thisprotective layer does not allow visible light to penetrate down to thedeveloping, embryonic seeds. Even ordinary microwave frequencies used incommercial kitchen units is of a very low efficiency and would not penetratethe layers of glumes. Partitioning of Energies If however, the energy producing this skull cap effect on the kernels was at avery specific wavelength in the microwave region and was tuned to criticalfrequencies and wave forms involved in anthocyanin formation, the anomalycould be accounted for. As it turns out, there is additional supporting evidencethat indicates this is precisely what is taking place. To help understand thiscomplex situation, reference is made to Fig. 5, an ear taken from a downedplant in the formation."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Figure 5 - Ear from formation. Shows red pigmentation on outerglume (\"husk\") exposed to the plasma energy complex. The non-pigmented regionson either side are where the outer, overlapping glumes were removed just beforephotographing. This shows that the energies only interacted with theouter glumes. Photograph © 2004 by W. C. Levengood.The central region of the glume exhibits the red pigmentation in the ovoidshaped area, whereas a strip on each side is free of color. This is due to thefact that just before taking the photograph, the red-pigmented glumes on theright and left sides were removed, thus exposing the non-red areasunderneath. With the presence of pigment on the outer surface of the ear, onewould certainly expect to find the purple caps on the seeds. As it turned out, when all the glumes were removed, this ear had normalappearing seeds. By way of comparison, the glumes surrounding the earshown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3, were of normal appearance. They had no purplepigmentation. This clearly suggests that within the highly complex energyprofile associated with this crop formation, there was one microwavecomponent which was in resonance with the molecular structure of thedeveloping seeds and another component of different frequency profile was inresonance with the outer leaves (glumes) and plant stem. This well definedpartitioning of energy has become more and more obvious in our studies ofcrop formations examined in this laboratory, particularly over the last five tosix years (since 1999). Positive Electric Field ExposureBefore leaving this discussion of anthocyanin pigmentation, it isimportant to note that there is yet another energy form within a cropformation plasma complex which quite likely would have acted in asupportive manner in the anthocyanin anomaly. During researchconducted at the Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory in an investigationrelated to seed viability, it was discovered that during initial imbibition (first stage of germination), an applied electric field can induce theionophoretic transport of anthocyanin in seeds.The inset in Fig. 6 demonstrates the sharp lines of demarcation whichform between the band of dark purple pigment and the normal seedtissue. Since the anthocyanin molecule has a positive charge, themigration is upward from the anode in the seed on the left anddownward in the seed on the right, both seeds were exposed to a 50V/cm electric field. The regression curve provides quantitative measureof the migration rate over a six-hour period. From the informationprovided in Fig. 6, it seems quite probable that a positive electric fieldsurrounded the ears exposed to the plasma energy in the Hillsboro,Ohio, crop formation."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Figure 6 - Effect of an electric field on anthocyanin transport in corn seeds.From a study conducted at the Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory. Stem Node ExpansionThe author of this report would like to express his appreciation for thewell-organized data submitted by Jeffrey Wilson and Gene Thomas.These data coveer important investigative areas, which are discussedbelow.There were two separate sample sets of stem nodes. The first set wascollected on July 7, 2004, or around 48 hours after the event. Thesecond set was collected on August 14, 2004, or about a month later(after the report of a second crop downing event). Node lengths weredetermined with a micrometer graduated in millimeters (mm). Theanalyzed data from both sets are listed in Table I below. The node length increases in the crop formation samples are much higher thanwould be expected. The reason is the tensile strength of corn stems is in theorder of 17-times the strength of wheat stems. These data again reflect thevery high energy of the plasma system that producing the Hillsboro formation. As might be expected, a microscopic examination of stem nodes revealed thatthe inner parenchyma tissue exhibited pronounced cell expansion, relative tothe controls. The upper photomicrograph in Fig. 7 shows a cross section ofcells in a normal node from a control plant. The photo below was preparedfrom a formation plant and the cell expansion is quite obvious when comparedwith the cells in the control photo."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Figure 7 - Photomicrographs comparing cells in stem nodes from plantstaken within the formation with tissue inside normal nodes from control plants.Both photos were taken at 450X magnification. The arrow in the lower photo pointsto possible \"stretch marks\" in the cell wall. Photomicrographs © 2004 by W. C. Levengood. The arrow in the lower photomicrograph points to what we define as “stretchmarks” in the outer cellulose matrix of the cell wall. These lines might bethought of as stress-related “slip planes” created in the cell wall as thetransient microwave heating increases the internal pressure. This effect isquite often observed in micrograpphic sections prepared from wheat plantstaken within crop formations - as studied in this laboratory since the early1990s. Radioactivity in Soil On Saturday, July 10, 2004, Jeff and Gene examined the soil for possiblelatent radioactivity associated with the Hillsboro, Ohio, crop formation. Witha portable Geiger Counter \"Gamma Scout\"), they examined soil samples takenat approximately the same locations as the plant samples. By using calibrated,metal absorbers (furnished with the counter), they were able to recordradiation from particles within three different energy ranges. In the first range,this instrument determines the counting rate from gamma rays (low energyx-rays). At the second level of filtering one obtains an indication of the levelof gammas, plus beta particles (energetic electrons). At the lowest level offiltering, the instrument records gamma, beta and alpha (helium nuclei)particles.With each counting-filtering test series, an equal number of soil samples weretaken outside the crop formation to provide information concerning thebackground level in normal or control soil. These counting data and associatedstatistical analyses are summarized in Table II, where the Geiger Counter datais given as micro-Sieverts/hour (directly related to counting rate)."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" It was very interesting to find the radiation levels increasing (right column inTable II) as the beta and alpha particles are detected by the counter. Thesedata suggest that the plasma energies producing the crop formation were ofsufficient energy to induce radioactivity in the soil. Without a scintillationspectrometer, it would be exceedingly difficult to determine the exact schemeof the nuclear reactions producing this radiation. It is the author's guess thatthese particles have energies in the range of 1 to 3 Mev. Magnetic Drag Test The magnetic-drag tests were conducted at the Pinelandia BiophysicalLaboratory on August 22, 2004, and the data are summarized in Table III.The soil from the formation contains over 200% more magnetic materialthan the control soil taken outside the formation. In fact, if we comparejust those factors which are routinely examined in crop formationmaterial - that is, stem node lengths, soil radioactivity and magneticdrag - we find in this Hillsboro, Ohio, case that there are statisticallysignificant alterations in all downed corn samples, relative to the normalcontrol plants. If we now add to that the anomalous pigment formationin corn seeds, we must come to the conclusion that the Hillsboro, Ohio,sweet corn patch interacted with a very complex and tremendously highenergy vortex plasma.”More Information:See other Earthfiles reports about 2004 Hillsboro, Ohio, crop formation in theEarthfiles Archives:· 05/09/2005 -- Mysterious Lights and 2003 Serpent Mound Soybean Formation· 10/17/2004 -- American Crop Formations: 1880-2004· 09/10/2004 -- Update on Miamisburg, Ohio, Corn Pictogram - Balls of Light?· 09/05/2004 -- Part 2 - Hillsboro, Ohio Corn Plant Anomalies· 09/04/2004 -- Hillsboro, Ohio Corn Formation - High Strangeness in Soil and Plants· 09/02/2004 -- Updated Photos: Big, Impressive New Corn Formation in Miamisburg,Ohio· 07/15/2004 -- Updated: Part 1-Beyond Hillsboro, Ohio, More Corn Down in NewMilford, Connecticut· 07/06/2004 -- Mysteriously Downed Oat Plants in Eagle Grove, Iowa, and DownedCorn in Hillsboro, OhioWebsites:http://www.cropcircleconnector.comhttp://www.cccrn.ca/http://www.dcca.nlhttp://www.kornkreise-forschung.dehttp://www.cropcircleresearch.comhttp://www.cropcirclenews.com"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"http://www.x-cosmos.ithttp://home.clara.net/lucypringlehttp://www.bertjanssen.nlhttp://www.swirlednews.comhttp://www.heramagazine.nethttp://www.temporarytemples.co.ukhttp://www.CropCircleAnswers.comhttp://www.ukcropcircles.co.uk/?page=homeCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
