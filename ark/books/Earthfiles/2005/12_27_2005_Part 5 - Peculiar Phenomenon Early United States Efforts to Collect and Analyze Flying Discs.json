Turner, White Sands Proving Ground commanding officer, todayblamed 'peculiar phenomena' for the erratic test flight of a German V-2 rocket whichlanded only six miles east of Alamogordo yesterday afternoon.\"- Las Cruces Sun-News, May 16, 1947Return to Part 1Trouble in the DesertThe German Vengeance-2 (V-2) rocket gathered momentum and accelerated from WhiteSands Proving Ground's (WSPG) \"Launch Complex 33\" to a maximum speed of 1,700meters per second all data appeared nominal. The rocket climbed to an intermediatealtitude of 40 miles. Radar technicians assigned to U. S. Army Ordnance watched inamazement as an unidentified target suddenly appeared next to the ascending missile. [Sourc e: United States Civilian Space Programs, 1958-1978, p. 166.]Almost as quickly as the unidentified object appeared, the V-2 changed course and took anortheasterly track that brought the rocket crashing to Earth two minutes later, six mileseast and slightly north of Alamogordo, New Mexico. The date was May 15, 1947. Thatcrash site was 40 degrees off the V-2's projected flight path. That rocket flight achieved analtitude of 80 miles and was terminated by a WSPG safety officer who activated anexplosive detonator on the rocket's fuel lines. The time elapsed from V-2 launch to impactwas only five minutes. [ Source: Las Cruces Sun-News, May 16, 1947, \"V-2 Goes Astray,\"p. 1.]That was the 26th launch of 67 total V-2 flights as of that May 15th date and began whatwould evolve over the next forty-eight years into the most highly classified military andscientific program in American history. The unexplained interaction between theunidentified objects and highly classified American rocket tests was more highly classifiedthat the Manhattan Engineering District (MED) project that culminated in the detonationof the first American atomic bomb test in July 1945 at the \"Trinity Site,\" 100 milesnorthwest of the V-2 rocket tests. In my confidential interviews with inside sources, I wastold the laboratories of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) worked on the UFOphenomenon as they had on the Manhattan Project. [ Source: SEAFARER ELF:Communications System, Draft Environmental Impact Statement by U. S. Navy, NavalElectronic Systems Command, Washington, D. C., 1977, Book 3, Figure 11.]It has been suggested to me that the reason for such a high security classification about theUFO phenomenon is that the United States still does not fully understand the intentions ofthe intelligence in the aerial discs. The U. S. will not disclose we are working on defensivesystems or our own to counter the disc capability. It has also been said to this author thatany disclosure about the existence of the disc research and development effort will becountered by U. S. government security agents who are assigned to misinform withoutregard to constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech in order to protect \"at all costs\" anAmerican policy of denial about disc crashes and retrievals of bodies and technologies inthe interests of national security.The Commander at White Sands Proving Ground, Lt. Col. Harold Turner, U. S.Army/Ordnance, was at a loss to explain what had happened to the May 15, 1947, V-2launch, but he told the press that \"peculiar phenomenon\" was responsible for the erratictest flight that came very close to crashing into the middle of the New Mexico town of"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Alamogordo, 55 miles up range from the V-2 launch complex.

Turner said and refused to speculate further about the V-2 rocket's crash.V-2 Rocket Mysteriously Veered Off Courseat White Sands Proving Ground on May 15, 1947V-2 rocket developed by German scientists in Project Paperclipat White Sands Proving Ground (WSPG), New Mexico, after WWII.[ Editor's Note: According to the U. S. Naval Laboratory website, \"AfterWorld War II, parts of almost one hundred German V-2 rockets were broughtto the United States. The U.S. Army undertook the task of assembling therockets at White Sands, New Mexico, for research and experimentation bygovernment agencies and universities. In 1946, the Naval Research Lab wasinvited to participate in the Army's V-2 rocket program. As an establishedgroup ready to carry out upper atmospheric research, the Laboratory becamethe prime agency for conducting research with the V-2 program and fordeveloping the technology to carry out the missions. Eighty experiments wereperformed between 1946 and 1951.\"The V-2 research program moved fairly quickly, with flights scheduled at theWhite Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico. The first static engine test firingof a German V-2 on U.S. soil occurred on March 14, 1946. The missile usedfor this engine test became the first German V-2 launched in the U.S. on April16, 1946. The U.S. V-2 series of launches concluded in 1952. Some of thelaunches employed V-2 missiles equipped with scientific instrumentationdesigned to study the upper atmosphere. These types of V-2 launches weremanaged by the V-2 Upper Atmosphere Research Panel, which wasestablished in January, 1947 and evolved into the Upper Atmosphere RocketResearch Panel in March, 1948.In the history of the V-2 rocket program, an internet archive calledEncyclopedia Astronautica states: \"1947 May 15 V-2 Flight Launched 16:04local time. Reached 135.5 km. Carried cosmic and solar radiation,temperature, ionosphere, photo experiments for Naval Research Lab.

Severalweeks later, following another unplanned \"missile impact\" after it veered off course, theMay 15, 1947, launch incident was mentioned in a few other published reports. But in arecently written history of the V-2 program, no mention is made of the 26th V-2 launch onMay 15, 1947. Nor was there any mention of the 18th V-2 launch on July 10, 1947. Therewere only half a dozen words about the 27th launch on May 29, 1947. There was nomention of an attempted V-2 launch on July 3, 1947.

OSRDhad overall responsibility for its sub-projects: White Sands Proving Ground, Los AlamosScientific Lab and Sandia Base.There was also the Joint Research and Development Board (JRDB) of the Joint Chiefs ofStaff (JCS), under whose authority White Sands Proving Ground was established andoperated. [ Source: SEAFARER ELF: Communications by U. S. Navy.]Both OSRD and JRDB, national weapons research and development organizations, wereheaded by one key man: Dr. Vannevar Bush, listed as MJ-2 on the President-elect BriefingPaper for Dwight D. Eisenhower.Dr. Bush was also President of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, D. C. from 1939 onand was the only Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD)over its seven year history. OSRD was established in 1940 and reportedly dissolved inSeptember 1947. OSRD designed and produced the first radar, the atomic bomb, and thevariable time and radio-controlled artillery proximity fuses. In October 1948, Dr. Bushresigned as Chairman of the Research and Development Board (RDB) of the Secretary ofDefense and the chairman position was replaced by Dr. K. T. Compton, then-President ofthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). [Source: The New York Times, October6, 1948, Front Page. ]El Paso Times, May 21, 1947, Front Page.
