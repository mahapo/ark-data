G., Houston, TexasJuly 28, 2005 From Washington, California and Arizona to Texas and Tennessee -The following are a few of the many e-mails I have received from Earthfiles viewers andCOAST listeners about the half cat phenomenon reported about in 071405 Earthfilesand other Earthfiles listed in More Information below. 1) C. M., AttorneySpokane, Washington \"I listen to you on Coast to Coast AM, when you are on George Noory's show. Myname is Cheryl Mitchell and I am any attorney and the Chairperson of the AnimalLaw Section of the Washington State Bar Association. I am not, however, writing toyou in my official capacity.I am located in Spokane, Washington, which is on the eastern side of the state, about20 miles west of the Idaho border, and approximately 100 miles south of theCanadian border. Most of the section members practice on the western side of thestate, where you indicated that the cases involving cat mutilations are occurring.I believe we had a half cat mutilation about a year ago in Spokane. The one here inSpokane was not investigated or even reported in our paper. The only reason I heardabout it was because I am involved in cat rescue on a day-to-day basis.I was told by a friend, who had inquired of the animal control director about the cat,that there was relatively little blood. The animal control director surmised that thecat had been dead when it was cut in half. And I do not know if they found bothhalves of the cat. No investigation was done nor was a necropsy performed on thecat.I am writing to ask if you would like me to post a notice on the Animal LawSection's ListServ regarding these half cat cases. I could ask if anyone in the sectionhas knowledge of this type of case to contact you. I believe that attorneys whopractice in the area of animal law might be receiving information about cases of thisnature, which might otherwise go unreported. I do not believe that the animalcontrol agencies even understand what these cases might involve. ...I could let theAnimal Law Section members know about your research. I do not know if it mightbe possible to arrange for necropsies of some of these cats at the veterinary schoolin Pullman, Washington.\" 2) R. H.Tucson, Arizona \"My name is Rachel and I live in Tucson, Az. My cousins found their cat about2 months ago cut in half a couple houses down from their house. She called usover to bury it, and had explained to us that is looked like it was cutclean in half. (Back half left.) Well when we got there it couldn't have been acleaner cut. Itwas so disturbing to see, and impossible to forget. It was only the backhalf with his legs and tail with no tearing, fur loss, or chew marks. Therewere also no organs/intestines and no blood on the ground or in the fur. He (cat)was found in a gated dirt area next to a major street. We thought it to be unlikely that a coyote would be in the middle of a neighborhooddown town eating a cat next to a very busy street. But we looked around and saw no"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"prints or anything else unusual. We called the police who also shared ouropinions about the cat's body. They took pictures and filed a report. Butthey had said no similar reports were made. Well about a month after that, a second back half of a cat was found by a schoolin the same neighborhood. All the people that have seen these cats believe it to bedone by 'someone' - not something.\" 3) R. N.Lancaster, California \"In 1959 we lived in Lancaster, California, and spent a lot time out in the Mojavedesert. I was about 12 or 13 years old. On one late afternoon/early evening, I wentout into the bush to do some target shooting with my father and brother. We hadgone about a mile when I found the rear half of a large ground squirrel directly in mypath. It looked as if someone had cleaved it apart with something very sharp, noblood on the squirrel or on the ground and no tracks. The ground was very dry anddusty, should have been tracks if it had been a coyote. The body was cool to thetouch, much cooler than the air and the ground, and was quite flexible, as if it hadjust been halved. The body was perfectly clean, no sand or soil on the wound orsaliva on the fur, clean as could be. I don't know why, but I had the feeling that ithad been put there for me to find. When my father got to where I was, he insistedthat I put it back where I found it because we may have disturbed a predator ofsome kind. But I didn't think so and still don't.\" 4) C. B.Oceanside, California \"I was terrified that this is such a widespread event. Two years ago, I woke in themorning and found my two cats looking out of our kitchen window. Their eyes werewide open and they appeared almost frozen. I followed their gaze and saw a furrymass on the ground outside. I went outside to take a look and there was the mosthideous sight I have ever seen. A cat lay dead, cut from neck to groin in a single,neat clean line. it was also cut through the middle in half. i have worked in themedical field for years and I know what surgical precision looks like. That was it. Itwas placed neat and tidy, one half next to the other. There was no blood to indicatea \"kill sight\" I checked the entire back yard. The other very chilling thing was thatthe cat's innards were gone. it was empty inside. No bones, pooled blood, nothing.The head, leg, and tail bones appeared to be in tact but nothing else. No ribcage-NOTHING. I called Animal Control and they advised me to notify the police. When the policearrived, the officer looked around and agreed that while it could be a coyote, hereally doubted that an animal did this. He called for a second officer who specializedin hate crime and I believe he used the word \"cult\" activity. the officer lookedaround and said without a doubt it was a coyote and they left. My husband and Ilooked at the poor cat and there was no way a wild animal would do this. Do youhave any more information on who or why is mutilating cats like this? one and a halfyears later one of our cats came home with his belly and groin area shaved almostbare. There was also a patched shaved on his lag with a small round sore thatfestered and we had to take him to a vet. The Vet claimed it was probably a feral cator a non-neutered Male cat. No way, again this was a precision clipping. The edgeswere neat and tidy and the hair was ALL clipped short, not torn out or scratched. Avet tech recommended I file a suspicious activity report with ASPCA, but theyrefused to take the report because with cats, you can not control them. Any help orinformation you can provide would be greatly appreciated. FYI there are alwaysmissing animal signs around our area. must be all that traffic:-)\" 5) M. G.Houston, Texas \"I was listening to Coast to Coast AM on July 22 concerning your report on the halfcat incidents, and I was writing to inform you about 1 of these corpses showing upon my driveway. I reside about 10 miles north of the city limits of Houston, TX in anarea called The Woodlands. I have a few cats/kittens that \"reside\" on my back porchand 1 of the kittens (she was about 9 months old at this point, not really a kittenanymore) turned up with just the upper half of the corpse. I found her because 1 ofthe 2 adult cats was sitting at the end of the driveway kind of sniffing the air when Iarrived home from my 2nd job at about 6:30 am."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I walked over to where she was sniffing and noticed the kitten, my first impressionwas that she was hiding in the grass as it was rather tall. I realized the kitten wasdead because they normally scatter when I am very near. The kitten's corpse waspretty much as described in your broadcast: upper half only with skin down to aboutmid torso. The description of a child's hand puppet is exactly what I was thinkingwhen I saw it. There was no blood at all on the fur or the grass upon which thecorpse was laying. I did not actually look inside, but it appeared there was no ribcage and the internal organs were gone. The \"biggest\" wild creatures that reside inmy area are possums and raccoons, and the pack of cats have killed 1 possum andtore up another 1 pretty bad in the last year so I doubt very seriously that is whatkilled it.There has been some massive scale construction/renovations going on in this area,plus there have been some heavy machinery across the street clearing out 2 woodedplots next to a water storage tank, so who knows what has been stirred up in what isleft of the forested areas. My initial thought was that the kitten had been caught upin 1 of the heavy machinery and was pulled apart, as something very sudden andvery \"strong\" had to have pulled it apart without leaving any blood residue on thecoat, and the mother cat had drug to corpse to the house to leave it for me. I buriedthe kitten behind the fence in the backyard and did not think any more of it until lastnight.After listening to the show, I now realized my assumption is incorrect and am nowbaffled by the cause of death. I am figuring there is probably more than 1occurrence as there was an animal control truck driving around the neighborhood onJuly 22, at about 2 pm when I left for work.\" 6) V. C.Renton, Washington \"Recently there have been reports of missing and partially eaten cats on the news.Wildlife experts are speculating some of the attacks might have been by raccoonsbecause they say coyotes typically eat the entire cat, including collar, bells and all.Indeed, they have found cat collars in the scat of coyotes. Usually all that's left froma coyote kill are scraps of fur. So I don't buy the idea that half-cats and othermutilations are caused by coyotes. Raptors have also taken cats in the area, but theydon't cut them in half. I imagine raccoons would make quite a mess as well.I appreciate your research. On Memorial Day, my next-door neighbor found myhealthy male black cat dead in her back yard. I could find nothing wrong with him,no marks, broken bones, no vomit, no blood, no signs of trauma. A coyote would nothave killed him and then left him there. We live on a quiet dead-end at the top of ahill, so it is unlikely he was hit by a car since he never ventured far, although hemight have had internal injuries. I don't want to be overly suspicious, but I've hadthe feeling it was 'murder.'\" 7) P. C.Collegedale, Tennessee \"I am a patrolman for the City of Collegedale, TN (east of Chattanooga in HamiltonCounty). I spent some of my childhood and all of my teenage years in this area andfrequently patrol the road where I once lived. Much of this area is now developedinto new residential subdivisions but when I lived here in the 1960's it was mainlyfarmland and woods. My brother and I found a half rabbit in the mid-1960's near ourhouse. I thought it very strange at the time and I have occasionally remembered theincident in passing. Your discussion tonight again on COAST reminded me of thatexperience. The rabbit was evenly divided in the middle. We found only the rearhalf. As I remember, there was no blood and no signs of a struggle; there was noripping or tearing of flesh evident. I was probably about 12-13 -- my brother 2 yearsyounger. We dutifully buried it where we did our cats and dogs that had diedthrough the years.\" 8) R. B.Redmond, Washington \"Just a minor note, but FYI a coyote will almost never kill more than oneanimal on any given day. For the coyote it's about a meal, not the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"thrill of the chase. There are some dogs on the other hand that simplyenjoy chasing/killing cats and it is not uncommon for such a dog to killseveral animals if he has the opportunity. There are plenty of coyotes in the Seattle area and because I have threecats I've made a point of studying coyotes and their habits.One other thing, a coyote typically kills a cat by biting/crushing theneck -- very different from the reports on your webpage. My guess is the so-called authorities in your story are simply grabbingfor the nearest plausible explanation to offer up to the owners.\" 9) C. C.Sequim, Washington \"With regards to cats in half, I can share with you a direct experience with a coyoteattack in Redmond about 10 years ago. I share this story with you since there arerelevant details that may be useful in determining if a cat mutilation was indeed thatof a coyote.It was just past daybreak on a Sunday morning, my wife had stepped outside into thefront yard to look for the Sunday paper. She came back inside shocked claiming thatthere had been a cat mutilation in our front yard and I needed to clean it up beforethe kids woke up.I went out into the front year and sure enough there was the front half of a cat. Itwas as though somebody had cut the cat exactly in half leaving the front half in ouryard. Upon further inspection I discovered the entrails of the cat had been scatteredthroughout the yard with the intestines stretching from one end of the yard to theother. The yard was full of cat fur and there was considerable evidence of a struggleas I could trace the last scramble of the cat as it attempted to escape the coyote. Ihad been planning to mow the lawn later that day, as a result the grass was longenough to register the chase and the final spot where the the coyote captured thecat. Due to the condition of the cat I promptly buried the remains in our side yard.I am relatively certain it was a coyote because two weeks later a friend who lived afew blocks away mentioned that she happened to be up that same morning havingtaken her husband to the airport for an early morning business flight. After returninghome and while preparing a cup of coffee she glanced out her kitchen window andhappened to see a coyote, in the early morning light, trotting down the middle of theresidential street with the remains of a cat in it's mouth.There was an irony in the fact that my wife had created leaflets with her computerasking if anyone has lost a cat in the neighborhood. She dutifully posted them on thetelephone poles and mail boxes within a few block radius of our house. It wasseveral days later our phone rang just as I had returned home from work. The callerstated that she had a cat that was the same color as what was described in theleaflet. She told me over the phone that she would allow her cat to play outside allnight and her cat would always return to her Condo deck by daybreak everymorning, with the exception of the previous Sunday morning.I asked her to describe her cat and she proceeded to describe all of the assorteddetails of the back end of the cat. The more I attempted to ask her to describe thefront end of the cat the more she would tell me about the unique spots on the tail, oron the coloration on the rear right leg, or the length of the tail. The problem was thatI had the front half and did not want to tell her that the cat was indeed gone if itwasn't her cat. Finally I was able to get her to describe the white plastic collar - onthe front half of the cat - it was then that I was able to confirm the identity and onlythen share the sad news with her. It became very quiet on the other end of thephone.\"More Information:For more information about half cat mutilations, please see my book,Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I: Facts & Eyewitnesses in Earthfiles Shop.Also, please see other Earthfiles reports about half cat mutilations in EarthfilesArchives:Â· 07/14/2005 -- More Half Cat Mutilations in Seattle, Washington RegionÂ· 09/12/2003 -- More Domestic Cat Mutilations - Again in Bothell, Washington"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Â· 07/01/2003 -- 40 Small Animal Mutilations in Denver and 11 in Salt Lake CityÂ· 11/16/2002 -- More Cat and Cow Mutilations: Colorado, Utah and MissouriÂ· 05/31/2002 -- Bloodless Cat Mutilations in Bellingham, WashingtonÂ· 10/20/2001 -- Dozen Mutilated Cats Found in San Diego, CaliforniaÂ· 09/08/2001 -- 23 \"Half Cat\" and 2 Deer Mutilations Confirmed by Austin, TexasLaw EnforcementÂ· 08/12/2001 -- Unusual Cat Deaths in Navarre, Florida and Austin, TexasÂ· 11/18/1999 -- Short Environmental UpdatesÂ· 11/05/1999 -- Reward Offered As Cat Mutilations Continue in Toronto, CanadaÂ· 10/10/1999 -- More Cat Mutilation Reports from Ft.
