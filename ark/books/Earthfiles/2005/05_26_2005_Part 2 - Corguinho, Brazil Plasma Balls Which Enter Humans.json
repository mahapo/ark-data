I have interviewed eyewitnesses there who have watched thelights move around in the sky and go back into the mesa or into the ground. Exactly whatthe source of the lights are and what they do when they emerge is unknown.But Urandir Oliveira, his family, the Felipe Branco family and many others have also seenwhat they call \"plasma balls.\" And nine months ago in September 2004, while FelipeBranco was visiting Urandir Oliveira at the Corguinho farm, Felipe had his own firsthandencounter with one of the lights.Digital video frames of \"plasma ball\" in September 2004, as light suddenly appeared and movedover half a dozen campers laying down at the Urandir Oliveira farm, Corguinho, Brazil.Some people described a sensation of heat as the light allegedly enteredand exited their feet. Video courtesy Felipe Branco."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Interview:Felipe Branco, Castelo Branco Ltd., Campo Grande, Mato Grosso Do Sul, Brazil : \"Idid this by myself and I could see it coming and entering my body and I could feel thisamazing heat!COULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR PERSONAL STORY STARTING FROM WHAT YOUWERE LOOKING AT BEFORE THE LIGHT?I was laying down face down. And I was wearing sun glasses. This was around 1 a.m. inthe night, 1 o'clock in the morning. Urandir told me I could look at it, that there was noproblem because you must wear sunglasses. If you don't wear sunglasses, it could hurtyour eyes. So, he put sunglasses on me and I was laying face down and Urandir said, 'I'lltell you when it's about to materialize, he ball. Then you turn your face back up again. Itwas coming from my back.' Then Urandir said, 'OK, he's going to come now.' And I turnedand I looked at it. But it was a golden ball that appeared out of nothing, around the samesize of 1 meter or maybe 1.5 meters, making the strange hissing noise. It was flying in leapsand then it diminished and entered my feet. But you could see it. In the footage, you cansee the light half inside my feet and half inside my leg. It's like half of the ball was insideand half was outside. And it was coming up my leg and then entered my lower back all theway to my neck and it entered my body and disappeared.WHAT DID THAT FEEL LIKE?It felt like a great heat.AND NO TELEPATHIC THOUGHTS?Yes, there were no telepathic, but I had a lot of visions. I had like a flood of images veryfast. I was aware of them and they were moving very fast. It was like a film in fastforward.WHAT WERE THE IMAGES?I was seeing scenes that looked like Egypt. There were pyramids, but they were not ofrocks. They were of metal, a gold metal. Huge. I saw three pyramids, but they weremetallic. I was in this room and I could see myself in this big room, marble type of stone.There were some strange lambs there and people dressed with a lot of gold, necklaces andthings. The idea was Egypt, but not like we see in history.Tutankhamun's golden mask is 24 pounds of solid gold, inlaid lapis lazuli,quartz, turquoise, carnelian, obsidian and colored glass. The Pharaoh rested insidethree golden coffins. Two were made of wood with a golden overlay, the thirdwas made from 296 pounds of solid gold, now at Cairo museum.WHAT IMPRESSION WERE YOU LEFT WITH - WERE THEY TRYING TO SHOWYOU THAT THIS IS WHERE THEY ARE FROM OR THEY WERE INVOLVED INEGYPT?The impression was that Egypt is a lot older than we think it is and that in early Egypt,they were present there. The ETs were interacting openly with the people there, as if theearly Egyptian civilization was extraterrestrial. That is the impression that came in. TheEgypt of Tutankhamun and people then was already something near to our time, about3,000 years ago. The impression was the images the ETs showed me was 25,000 to 30,000years ago, that's the impression.[Editor's Note: Tutankhamun (alternate transcription Tutankhamen), namedTutankhaten early in his life, was Pharaoh of the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt (1334"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"BC/1333 BC - 1323 BC), during the period known as the New Kingdom. Hisoriginal name Tutankhaten means \"Living Image of Aten\" while Tutankhamunmeans \"Living Image of Amun.\"]AND EXTRATERRESTRIAL.Ye s .ANY IMPRESSION ABOUT WHY THEY WERE SHOWING THE IMAGES TO YOUIN THE FALL OF 2004?Yes, because remember I told you about my first encounter (with tall red-haired entities in1968 - See: 122102Earthfiles). They said they were going to wake me up. They weregoing to help me remember past reincarnations, something like that. They said they aregoing to help us remember so we see that history is not as we told. History is verydifferent. We are supposed to pass on this information, but I'm not sure. It's real, but at thesame time so abstract. It's very hard to talk about it with certainty and saying it's 100% likethis.WHEN YOU WERE HAVING THE IMAGES FLASH THROUGH YOUR MIND LIKE AMOVIE, DID YOU ALSO HAVE SENSE OF SOUND AND SCENT AND PRESSURE,ALL IN THAT MOVIE?Oh, yes.THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE HERE IN THE MILITARY HAVE DESCRIBED WHEN THEYSAY THEY'VE HAD TELEPATHIC ENCOUNTERS WITH BEINGS AND THEYDESCRIBE THE MOVIE DOWNLOADS. NOW, YOU HAD INTERACTIONS WITHTALL RED-HAIRED BEINGS.Red hair, yes, with freckles!DID YOU RELATE THE TALL RED-HAIRS TO THE PARTICULAR LIGHT THATWAS ENTERING YOU IN CORGUINHO?No, I did not.WHAT DO YOU ASSOCIATE THE LIGHT WITH?The Egyptian images because they remain so strong in my mind.DO YOU THINK THE TALL RED-HAIRS WERE INVOLVED WITH THEEGYPTIANS?The impression I have is that there is a group of races that have been working together.And these tall red ones are involved in this group.WHO DO YOU THINK, AT AN INTUITIVE LEVEL, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEPLASMA BALLS COMMUNICATING WITH YOU ALL (IN CORGUINHO)?I think it's a machine guided by someone who is inside a spaceship up in the air? I don'tknow. That's the impression I have. And I asked Urandir if he had information and he said,'Yes, this is like a remote-controlled device that they use to work our energy to increaseour vibrational energy, to increase the electrical charge of our cells, that sort of thing, sothat we are better prepared for contact face-to-face.\"More Information:Tall Red-Haired Beings in Pillpinto, PeruWhen I was in Peru in June 1987, I heard about tall beings with copper red hair, crystalblue eyes, and very white skin that were seven to eight feet tall, or taller. The man whotold me about them was an archaeology student whose father worked as a traveling nursein the rural areas of Peru. Edwin Flores told me that his father had traveled in 1981 to aremote village called Pillpinto, six hours by car from Cuzco. When he returned, he askedhis son why \"very tall Irish people\" were living in the rugged mountains. His fatherexplained that he had seen them at the outskirts of the village. Flores said his father hadnot been back since 1981 and he didn't know if the \"tall Irish\" were still there. I proposedthat we go to Pillpinto and find out.It was a difficult road, climbing most of the time, with hairpin turns. We were stoppedtwice by security police. I didn't learn until later that we were driving right toward one ofthe hide-outs of the Communist-inspired rebels known as the \"Shining Path\" who had been"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"blowing up trains and buildings in Peru. Flores explained to the police that I was anAmerican documentary filmmaker and writer investigating information aboutextraterrestrial phenomena and that we were looking for \"tall Irish\" living near Pillpinto.We were surprised when the police said. \"Si!\" They knew about the red-haired people. Atthe outpost closest to Pillpinto, two policemen pointed up into the sky and told about alarge, round, bright object that had landed on top of one of the mountains. The police saidthey had climbed up there and if we did, too, we could still see the \"burned oval\" wherethe light landed. The police estimated it would take a day to reach the site. I was tempted,but time was limited, and I wanted to at least see if the tall Irish people were still living inPillpinto. So, we continued on to the village.When we stopped, our car was surrounded by dozens of children. When Flores explainedwhy I was there, the children began pointing toward houses. He said the children knewabout the tall, red-haired people and would take us to a man who knew about them.My heart began to beat faster as we walked toward the door of a small, adobe home,preceded by the laughter and chatter of the children who surrounded us. The sun wassetting and in the twilight shadows, I asked myself what I was going to do if I actuallyfound myself in front of an eight foot, red-haired being from another world.Flores knocked and the door opened. In front of us stood a man about five-foot-four withclear blue eyes, like \"clear water,\" as Felipe Branco described the clear green eyes of thetall, red-haired beings he has encountered in Brazil. There were copper-red patches in hisdark, brown hair. I asked Flores if he could find out where the man's parents were. After along answer in Spanish, Flores said, \"His parents live in that house over there. Nothingunusual. But he knows about the 'tall Irish.' He says they used to live outside the villageand have moved on. He said there is another man here who knew them.\"We walked further surrounded by the children. Flores knocked on the second door.Another man answered and his eyes were clear blue, too. He also had copper patches inhis dark hair. He knew about the red-haired people, but said they didn't live thereanymore. He did not know where they had come from, either, or where they had gone.Sourc e: Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I: Facts & Eyewitnesses Â© 1994 byLinda Moulton Howe.See other Earthfiles reports about Corguinho, Brazil, events in the Earthfiles Archives:Â· 05/24/2004 -- Biophysicist W.
