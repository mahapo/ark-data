Sketch © 2005 by \"Howard.\" July 22, 2005 Orlando, Florida - In February 2005, I received e-mail and phone communication from a manwho called himself \"Howard\" living in Orlando, Florida. He said his profession is computer networkadministration. Howard asked for anonymity and said he hoped his experience might help me in myinvestigation of the worldwide animal mutilation phenomenon which has persisted since at least the 1960s,and probably before. Then earlier this month, I was contacted by a source from the Mid-west with anotheraccount of light beam lifting technology and animal mutilation associated with a reptilian huanoid. See:070405 Earthfiles.Ten years ago in the summer of 1995, Howard was with a male friend about to get into a car to go buycigarettes not far from Disney World. He remembered the sky was not quite dark and figured the time wasprobably around 8 p.m. EDT. Just before getting into the car, Howard and his friend \"saw an unusualmovement in the sky and we noticed a green glow ing craft.\"Howard told me the craft was disc-shaped, moved very quickly in three different motions toward them, andappeared to be a silver \"bare metal.\" Howard compared the green glow to the electrostatic discharge around aTesla coil. Underneath the disc right at the center was a fire engine-red, glow ing ball. That glowing centralsphere had motion in it. Howard told me, \"It's much like if you go to the SOHO website which has the filteredobservations of the sun and you can clearly see sunspots. The marbling in the red sphere was much likesunspots on the sun. You'll have darker patterns that move in the red. The red, even though it was deep andshining, did not emit much light. So, if it was fifteen feet above the ground, there would be no red glow on theground.\"Howard said the craft came to about fifteen or twenty feet away from them. The two men were so close thatHoward said they could see \"black char marks\" on the hollow silver ring that surrounded the red sphereunderneath the disc hovering a little above Florida pine tree height.Interview:\"Howard,\" Computer Network Administrator, Orlando, Florida: \"The disc stopped and hovered over thiscow. We were in a rural area and next to my friend's house, they had horses and cows. There was a lot ofpasture land there. So, it hovered over a particular cow. There was one cow isolated from the rest of thebunch that was near the fence near our car. The glowing disc hovered over the cow and then a beam of whitelight came down and enveloped the cow.\"Static-Filled\" Light BeamI'll describe how the light looked. All I can say is that it had static in the light. It looked like static on a TVscreen where you have little specks of white and black, but there were not black and white specks in the light.It was just brighter spots in the light that made it look like that. But the static in the beam were long, so eachline was probably about 3 inches long. The lines would move up, so it was like dust particles moving veryquickly within the light, almost like laser light. If you take a laser light, you can see the dust particles in it. Itlooked much like that, like static or debris in the light, but moving."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"When the light came down, as soon as the light hit the cow, the cow immediately started to lift up. The cowlifted up first with its four legs and lifted into an upward position, making it look like it had stood up on itstwo back legs.The disc hovered in the air and probably lifted the cow up a good 3.5 to 4 feet off the ground. The cow wascentered between the craft and the ground as far as the spacing. And it slowly raised up to the bottom of thecraft and stopped probably about 6 feet away from the bottom of the craft. White, Glowing \"Tentacle\" WrapsAround Cow in Light BeamCow raised in light beam where tentacle excised tissue before cow wasdropped back to ground. Drawing © 2005 by Howard.A tentacle in this hollow space that was on the bottom of the saucer, there was a tentacle. I say tentaclebecause it was like a noodle or long string had come down from inside the hollow cavity inside the craft. Thenoodle or tentacle was glowing also. But it did not glow green; it did not glow red. It glowed white. Everypart of its surface was glowing white.The tentacle was probably about 15 feet long fully extended and it came in a circular motion down and thenunraveled. The tentacle unraveled straight out and then it proceeded to go under the cow from its bottom andthen slowly wrap around, much like a snake. The tip of the tentacle was closer to the face of the cow.At this point, the tentacle like a python snake once it had gotten into position it tightened its grip on the cow. Itwas at this point that the cow began to scream violently in pain. This is when I heard electricity coming fromthe tip of this tentacle. The electricity was just much like an arc welder's machine. It put out a lot of electricityand it looked like it was cutting up the face of the cow. This was why the cow was screaming.Also, once the tentacle had latched on, it looked as if there were multiple ports on the tentacle maybe two orthree on the tentacle itself. Not near the tip, but were independently spaced. Also, the tentacle was segmentedand it looked like it would be some kind of robotic instrument. But I could not see metal. All I could see wasthis glow ing white light.At this point, it started to cut the cow and it started to move around. We also heard the sucking of liquidthrough a hose-type sound through the tentacle, as if you would take water and suck it up w ith a shop vac. Thewhole process of what it was doing to the cow lasted under a minute, from start to finish.The tentacle then detached (from the cow) and went back up inside the cavity of the UFO. The light beam hadstopped and the cow dropped I would say dropped a good 6 feet to the ground.BUT ONLY 6 FEET?Yes. It would not be any higher than 6 feet.SO I'M CLEAR. THERE HAD BEEN THE BEAM OF WHITE LIGHT IN WHICH THE COW WASRAISED UP ABOUT 6 FEET AND THE TENTACLE CAME DOWN OUT OF THE HOLE OF THEDONUT AND WRAPPED AROUND THE COW AND PROCEEDED TO DO THE CUTS.That's right.DID THAT AND THE BEAM OF LIGHT STOP AT THE SAME TIME? DID THEY BLINK OUT? WHATHAPPENED?No, when the tentacle was done doing what it was doing, it retracted and went back up in the same position asit came down. That process took about 5 or 6 seconds. Then, the light beam shut off and it went out just like alight, just instantly. Then the cow fell. So, my assumption is that the beam is used to lift up things and thetentacle is used to cut them up.YOU ARE INSIDE YOUR CAR, CORRECT?No, we were still outside the car. We had never gotten inside the car. We had opened up the doors to getinside the car, but seeing what we saw, we got back out.YOU'RE STANDING APPROXIMATELY 20 FEET FROM THIS EVENT DURING THE ENTIRE PERIODOF THE BEAM, THE COW RISING."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Cow Screams and Is Cut By \"Tentacle\"We did approach the craft, which is what I'm getting to. When the cow started to scream, it seems like out ofinstinct we were going to walk over to the cow and perhaps grab its legs and pull it down. We didn't eventhink about what we were doing. So, there was one point where we got up to the craft, I'd say about ten feetfrom the cow (in the beam).WERE YOU TEN FEET FROM THE COW DURING THE CUTTING OPERATION?No, we were still about 15 or 20 feet away from the cow at that point. When it started to cut and we heard thecow scream, it took us a few seconds to realize what was going on and what we should do about it. Probablyhalf way through the process, or 30 seconds or so, we decided we would walk up to the cow and try to dosomething to stop what we were seeing.WHEN YOU WALKED UP, WAS THERE ANY CHANGE IN THE LIGHT BEAM'S COLOR, INTENSITY,IN THE BEAM OR GLOWING, CUTTING OBJECT?No, there was no change. There was a change in the glowing intensity of the green glow that surrounded thecraft and it would fluctuate the whole time. It was not because we walked up to it. It would fluctuate like Idon't know how to describe it. Parts would be brighter than others and the brightness would move.IN THE LAST 30 SECONDS OR SO OF THE GLOWING TENTACLE DOING THE CUTTING OF THECOW, YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUE HAVE WALKED TO ABOUT TEN FEET FROM THE BEAM.That's correct.SO YOU ARE RIGHT THERE WHEN THE COW DROPS TO THE GROUND?Yes. Just take a cow, hang it up a few feet in the air, let it go, and it hits with a loud thud. That's pretty much it.BUT YOU MUST HAVE WALKED UP TO THE COW.We did.WHAT DID YOU SEE IN TERMS OF WHAT HAD BEEN CUT AND WHAT DID IT LOOK LIKE?I didn't get a really good look at it. I just wanted to verify that it was there and dead. Two Hours of Missing TimeI' M PUZZLED HERE. THIS HAS HAPPENED. THIS IS TREMENDOUSLY DRAMATIC. YOU WANTEDTO HELP THE COW. SO, THE NATURAL THING WOULD BE TO WALK AROUND THE COW TO SEEWHAT HAPPENED.Which we did, but all we could see was the face. At this point, it was much darker outside. There were twohours that went by from the point that we saw the cow hit the ground to the point that we had walked up andbeen able to check the cow out.TWO HOURS? I THOUGHT THIS WAS ALL TAKING PLACE WITHIN A MINUTE?Yes, but we did not get to see until later.ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU WERE ABDUCTED BY THIS CRAFT THAT HAD JUST MUTILATEDTHE COW IMMEDIATELY UPON THE DROPPING OF THE ANIMAL.? ARE YOU THEN ABDUCTEDFOR TWO HOURS?I'm not saying that. I'm just saying I had tw o hours of missing time.IMMEDIATELY UPON THE COW DROPPING TO THE GROUND?That's right.DO YOU HAVE CONSCIOUS MEMORY OF SEEING THE LIGHT GO OUT AND SEEING THE COWDROP?Yes.DO YOU HAVE MEMORY THEN OF EITHER MOVING TO THE COW OR ANY MEMORY FROMTHAT POINT CONSCIOUSLY WHEN THE COW HITS THE GROUND?Yes, I do.WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE COW DROPPED? WHERE DOES THE MISSING TIME START ANDSTOP? BUT BEFORE THE MISSING TIME STARTS, WHAT HAPPENED? DO YOU REMEMBERINSTANTANEOUSLY WALKING UP TO THE COW AND LOOKING AT THE FACE AND BODY?That was 2 hours later, yes I do."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Light Beam Surrounds Howard and FriendBUT YOU DID NOT WALK UP TO THE COW IMMEDIATELY UPON ITS DROPPING TO THEGROUND?No, we were walking up to the cow as it was still in the air. We were already 10 feet away when the cow haddropped. Then as the cow dropped, we proceeded to step back and we probably stepped back about 15 feet.At which point, the beam had shut off and the UFO centered itself over us.AND?We also got a beam of light on us.WHITE?Yes, same beam.ARE BOTH OF YOU IN THE BEAM AT THE SAME TIME?That's correct.ARE YOU SEEING THE SAME DUSTY SPARKLES?Yes.BUT NOW THOSE DUSTY SPARKLES ARE SURROUNDING YOU?That's correct.ARE YOU LEFT TOTALLY CONSCIOUS WITH ALL YOUR FACULTIES PROCESSING AS YOU ARELIFTED IN THE BEAM?Yes. When the beam of light was on us, after the cow had dropped and we proceeded to step back from it, thebeam moved over our heads. When the beam moved over our heads, we ran for the car. The car at that pointwas only a few feet away from us. The doors were still open. So I, myself, I had put one hand on the door andI had my right hand on the top of the car on the driver's side. I was driving and was about to get in. It was atthat point that the light had captured us and raised us up like the cow was raised up.BUT NOT THE CAR?Not the car.SO THE BEAM HAS THE TWO OF YOU. WHAT DID YOU FEEL? TEMPERATURE? VIBRATION?No variance in temperature. I felt a weightlessness and I did lift off the ground, myself and my friend. As soonas the beam hit us, we were paralyzed. My arms and head were still locked in the same position. We werelooking across the hood of the car, the roof of the car, at each other when we were being lifted up. So, I cantell we were being lifted up by what I saw around me and by my friend.We felt an uncomfortable feeling. I don't have anything else to compare it to. It would be like maybe pinpricksor needles underneath your skin, but not on top of the skin. It was underneath the skin. And we felt theweightlessness. But it was not spaced evenly. My legs were more weightless than my head, if that makes anysense. I could feel it differently.I felt like my top half weighed more than my lower half. And I felt this uncomfortable tingling sensation undermy skin. It was not pleasant.HOW CONSCIOUS WERE YOU IN THE BEAM?When we got up about half way through the bottom of the craft, we had blacked out.\"Continued in Part 2.
