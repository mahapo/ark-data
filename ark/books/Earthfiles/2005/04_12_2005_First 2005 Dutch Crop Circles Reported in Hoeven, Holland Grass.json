Map © MapQuest.April 12, 2005 Brummen, The Netherlands - Seven years ago on June 7, 1999, a fewminutes after midnight, 19-year-old Robbert van den Broeke woke up and felt compelledto look out his second story bedroom window. Robbert opened the curtains and saw a\"small, misty, pinkish-purple light\" shaped like a football coming over the wheat field at aheight of about ten feet. The light stopped about 150 feet from his house. \"Then the lightstarted to elongate, spreading out becoming thinner and thinner looking like a disc. Whenit was about thirty feet in diameter, Robbert saw what he called \"electrical discharges\"emit from the bottom of the pinkish-purple light. After that, the light faded away. Robbertran outside into the wheat and there was a 30-foot-diameter circle next to a 10-foot-diameter circle.Every year since then, more circles and other patterns have appeared near the Van denBroeke house. Now in the early morning of April 6, 2005, Robbert found two more. Hecalled up a local television station which announced the discovery to the Dutch public.One of the listeners was Robert Boerman, founder of the Ptah Foundation and producer ofthe Dutch Crop Circle Archive. Robert called Peter van Learhoven who went to Hoeven alittle after twilight on April 6, and took photographs before people had walked throughthem.

He couldnot take the photos as he wanted. Normally, he has no problem with the camera. But thistime it was very difficult to take photos.WHAT ABOUT YOU?We went Sunday, April 10, four days later. We did not have any problems with equipment,cameras functioned.WHERE ARE THESE TWO NEW CIRCLES COMPARED TO THE LOCATION OFPREVIOUS ONES IN THE HOEVEN FIELD?This formation is almost in the same area as the last ones in previous years that haveappeared in Hoeven. These are only about 200 meters (656 feet) away from last year'slocation. So, it's all in the same area. Grass Circle Sizes, Lays and EnergiesWhen we visited the formation Sunday, we didn't have any camera problems. We saw thatthe large, not purely round circle was approximately 8 meters 90 centimeters (29.5 feet) by10 meters 10 centimeters (33 feet). The small circle was nearly round, about 1 meter 70centimeters (5.5 feet) in diameter. The lay of the grass in the large circle was clockwiseand the small circle was anti-clockwise. The strange thing is that we measured the bigcircle was laying clockwise, but the energy was going anti-clockwise.Diagram by Robert Boerman of two-circle-patternin Hoeven, Holland, grass discovered on April 6, 2005.WHAT DID YOU USE TO FIND THE ENERGY FLOW?We used dowsing rods. In the larger circle, the lay of the grass was to the right, but theenergy was to the left. In the small circle it was the opposite: the lay was to the left and theenergy was flowing to the right.Strange thing on Sunday was that one of our crop circle research colleagues, Netti, whileshe was standing in the center of the large circle, she became very warm. Ten minuteslater, about five or six young guys arrived and were talking to us. One of them was also"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"standing in the large circle in the center and he said, 'My feet are getting warmer.'
