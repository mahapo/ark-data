Australian kangaroo mother and baby © by George Harrison.August 13, 2005 Melbourne, Australia - Unusual, bloodless mutilations of animals is aworldwide phenomenon. The types of animals range from cows and horses to smallerdomestic animals such as pigs, goats, sheep, rabbits and even wild animals such as deerand elk. Then there are the terrible cases of pet dogs and cats being found cut in half orbeheaded or paws cut off and skinned all without blood or signs of struggle at the scenewhere found. Recently half cats by the dozens have been reported again in the Seattle,Washington, region and Dallas, Texas. I've reported on Dreamland about the Seattlesituation which authorities there dismissed as coyote kills.Now this week comes more mutilated cat news from Dallas. Between February and July,there have been seven dead and bloodlessly cut up cats found on lawns and reported topolice. A 2-year-old feline was found cut in pieces in the Northaven Park area ofnorthwest Dallas in March. A Dallas police spokesperson told reporters, \"The detectivesdon't know who or what caused the injuries.\" But Dallas animal services like authorities inthe Seattle region say it's probably the work of coyotes.But local residents don't agree. The Dallas Morning News interviewed 73-year-oldCaroline Swann, a retired junior high science teacher living in Lake Highlands in Dallas. InJune she found parts of a cat on her lawn. No blood. Then two days later, there were morecat parts in exactly the same spot in her yard. Based on the physical evidence, Mrs. Swannthinks the parts were from two different cats. About the police explanation that the cut upcats were left by coyotes, she told the newspaper reporter, \"I've lived in this house for 44years and haven't seen a coyote in twenty years. I know the police were trying to saythings that would allay fears, but I looked at it from a scientific standpoint."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"In another July 23rd cat kill in Far North Dallas, a resident found part of her 12-year-oldcat on the front yard. The owner told the News, \"The veterinarian said this was done by ahuman. there was no blood where we found her. People who do this, there's no tellingwhat they're capable of. It's very, very sick and scary.\"Those same words could be applied to another sliced up animal mystery in the SouthernHemisphere. Forty-five minutes by car northeast of downtown Melbourne, Australia, is theYarrambat Golf Course. For the past two months, Something horrible has been happeningthere to kangaroos on the neat, green grass. And yet, no one at the Royal Society for thePrevention of Cruelty to Animals was contacted until Tuesday, August 9. What theRSPCA heard this week is so baffling, so unprecedented, that authorities are at a loss toexplain what's happened. Groundkeepers in the early mornings of twelve different days,have found kangaroos dead and decapitated their heads cut off. Yet, no blood and no signsof struggle in the well-kept grass. This week I talked about the bizarre kangaroo deathswith Catherine Smith, Senior Inspector of the Victoria RSPCA based in Burwood East,Victoria, Australia.Interview:Catherine Smith, Senior Inspector, Victoria Royal Society for the Prevention ofCruelty to Animals (RSPCA), Burwood East, Victoria, Australia: \"The strange thing isthat the kangaroos have been found deceased and beheaded on the golf course for a periodof approximately the last ten weeks. Over that time there have been about 12 differentkangaroos that have been found. They have been of varying size and age, male andfemale, but have all had their heads and in some of the smaller ones, the larger portion ofthe top part of their body - actually removed. The heads of them have not been found.THE AAP ARTICLE SAID THERE HAVE BEEN 15 KANGAROOS?We made some further inquiries yesterday with the groundkeeper at the golf course. Therewere a couple of kangaroos that they found on the golf course that they actually moved tothe side of the road for collection by the Council. The initial report was there had been 12on the golf course, two by the side of the road and one in the road further away. So, therehas been a doubling up (in the count) on at least a couple of the kangaroos. We canactually confirm 12 on the golf course (and 1 in the road.)HAVE ALL OF THESE BEEN BLOODLESS?That's another strange factor. They've been beheaded, but there has not been any largeamount of blood found next to the body, which is fairly strange. To behead a kangaroo, ifyou were on foot which is the only way you would be able to get into the golf course afterhours seemingly, you wouldn't be able to actually walk right up to a kangaroo and cut itshead off. And if you did, there would be a lot of blood involved. So, we're curious aboutthe manner in which they are initially killed and whether the removing of the head isactually something done later.WOULDN'T KANGAROOS FIGHT?Yes, absolutely. Definitely a large male (would fight). That's the strange thing. You can'tjust walk up to a kangaroo. They are not pets. There are a lot of kangaroos in that area.They are not tame. They are wild animals, and especially the older males would definitelydefend themselves if you tried to attack them.Some of the possibilities might be that they are being shot first and then defaced when theperson or people approach them and cut off their heads.HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO GET ANY OF THE DECAPITATED BODIES FORFORENSIC EXAMINATION?No, unfortunately the first information we received was only a couple of days ago. It wasquite interesting conducting some inquiries yesterday that people in the local area hadbeen aware of it happening over a period of time, but it had not been reported to us. So, it'sunfortunate that we haven't had an opportunity at this stage. We've requested from allthose people that if they do find another body to inform us immediately and we can do that(necropsy). Some Kangaroos Cut Through ChestIF I UNDERSTOOD SOMETHING YOU SAID THAT IN ONE OR TWO CASES IT WASNOT JUST THE REMOVAL OF THE HEAD. BUT THERE WAS AT LEAST A CASE"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WHERE THERE WAS REMOVAL DOWN MORE INTO THE CHEST OF THEKANGAROO AS WELL?Yes, there seems to have been cut off the person we spoke to yesterday, the witness weinterviewed described it as being cut off with a sword, like a clean slice. Some of thesmaller roos, instead of it being just the head. The smaller kangaroos, to give you an ideaof size, I suppose, could be two to three feet tall instead of five (in bigger kangaroos).Their bodies had their heads removed, but a little bit lower just under their small arms atthe front where they attach to the body.WHERE THEY HAD BEEN CUT IN DECAPITATION, WHERE THE HEAD HADBEEN CUT OFF, DID THE GROUNDKEEPER SAY THAT THOSE ALSO LOOKED ASIF THEY HAD BEEN CUT WITH A VERY CLEAN SHARP BLADE?Yes, all of them. It's just like the same clean slice wound.HAD HE EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE?No I don't think they've ever seen anything like that on the golf course. We also madeinquiries with the National Park above the golf course. We spoke to rangers there also.They've had a number of problems in their park with kangaroos over the past three years, Iguess. This is a rural fringe area, so on one side is the suburbs and not far on the other sideis a rural community. So, you get that cross over between people used to living in the bushwith wild animals and those that perhaps aren't.The park rangers talk of problems in the past of people riding 4-wheel motor bikes andcarrying machetes and chasing and trying to attack kangaroos. On the golf course, therehas been no evidence of tire tracks or anything like that. As I say, there are big lockedgates and the only way in at the night time which is the only time anyone could get in therewithout being seen - would be on foot. It's very strange really.YES, IT IS REALLY STRANGE. AND IF SOMEBODY HAD A MACHETE, THEREWOULD HAVE TO BE BLOOD, WOULDN'T THERE?Logic would say yes. I guess the difficulty is not having an animal to examine.DID YOU TALK WITH ANY OF THE EYEWITNESSES WHO FOUND THEKANGAROO BODIES?Yes, the inspector who attended yesterday did have a conversation with one of thegroundkeepers on the golf course, who was one of the people there are a couple of them who found a number of the bodies, yes.

I guess the difficulty is not having an animal to examine. Because wehaven't had a fresh scene to walk in and look at, it's really difficult.BUT IF IT'S A GOLF COURSE, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE DISCOVERED EVERYDAY.Oh, definitely.AND IT WOULD HAVE TO BE ON FRESH GRASS?Yes. You would think so. I guess I am just being cautious. We can only rely on thecomments from the witnesses. And they are saying they didn't see any blood. But, maybeit soaked into the ground and they didn't look particularly hard. I guess it's possible it'ssomething they could have missed. At this stage, it's important to keep as open a mind aspossible. But from the information we have so far, it definitely is unusual and it definitelydoes not add up at this stage.DID THE GROUNDKEEPER SAY HE EVER FOUND ANY BLOOD ON THE HAIRSOF THE KANGAROOS?No. The information he said was that they just had that part of their bodies sliced off.There was not a large amount of blood anywhere, on them or (ground). He did say they didnot display any other obvious wounds no bullet wounds, no scrapes, no cuts, anywhereelse on their bodies other than the fact their head or top half of their body had beenremoved, they didn't show any other signs of injury.DID THE GROUNDKEEPER TELL YOU IF THIS HAD BEEN HAPPENING ON THEGOLF COURSE OVER THE PAST TEN WEEKS, WHY HE HAD NOT CONTACTEDAUTHORITIES?He actually said he had contacted the Dept. of Sustainability and Environment, which ourstate government department that looks after wildlife. He said he had spoken with themand we are curious about why no one has contacted us. But he said he had contacted whathe thought was the correct authority at the time. I can't speak for what action they havetaken and/or what evidence was available to him (groundkeeper) when he made thosecomplaints.We made a very strong appeal to any members of the community who might have anyinformation or can assist us with our inquiries. We hope there is not the opportunity for usto actually view a body firsthand because that would mean it happened again. But we haveappealed that whoever finds another animal, contact us immediately so we look forforensic information.If they (perpetrators) are doing it under the cloak of darkness or when there are not peopleat the golf course. Our understanding is that the golf course is open 7 days. It's all a bitodd, really. Someone has to have seen or heard something, you would think.DO YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF A SECURITY GUARD OR SOMEONE WITH YOUROFFICE NOW STAKING OUT THE GOLF COURSE?No. We'd love to have the resources to be able to do something like that. We have 17people who work here across the entire state. So, we just don't have the resources to sit onone property 24 hours a day. We have obviously alerted the owners of the property. Iknow there is a local community group that is keeping an eye on the course andsurrounding areas. There is an organization that specifically targets cruelty to kangaroosthat is trying their best to keep an eye on it. We've spoken with them about it. So, in acoordinated fashion, we are attempting to do the best with the resources that we have. Could Mutilators Be Coming In From The Sky?HAS ANYBODY EXPLORED THE POSSIBILITY THAT SOMETHING COULD BECOMING IN FROM THE SKY OR THE AIR DOWN INTO THE GOLF COURSE?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"No, not yet. It's not something that immediately jumps to mind as a possibility. I couldn'tcomment as to whether it's any fly path or anything like that. But anything that comesfrom the sky that would cause that kind of injury to the kangaroos, you would think wouldbe embedded in the ground next to it.I WAS THINKING OF HELICOPTERS OR PERHAPS SOMETHING ELSE STRANGE.HERE IN THE UNITED STATES, ENGLAND AND OTHER PLACES, THERE HAVEBEEN VERY UNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHS IN WHICH EYEWITNESSES HAVE SEENBEAMS OF LIGHT COMING OUT OF THE SKY. HAS ANYBODY REPORTEDANYTHING UNUSUAL OF AERIAL VEHICLES OVER THAT GOLF COURSE?No, not to our knowledge.THAT'S SOMETHING TO POSSIBLY KEEP IN MIND IF THESE KEEP HAPPENING.Well, we have asked the community to contact us with any knowledge of anything that'samazing or strange in the area that could possibly be linked to their (kangaroos') deaths.We haven't received any calls of that nature at this time.HAVE YOU CHECKED WITH OTHER ANIMAL CRUELTY OFFICES IN OTHERPARTS OF AUSTRALIA TO SEE IF THEY HAVE EVER HAD SUCH SIMILARREPORTS BEFORE?The media concerning this has been pretty widespread across Australia. So, the otherRSPCA in Australia have not reported any information or incidents happening in otherstates of Australia at this time. There are a lot of authorities and different bodies, as I'msure there are in the States. I hope that anyone who has similar knowledge that they wouldcontact us. But we will definitely continue with our investigations in an attempt to contactas many as we can to try to find out if anyone has had any history of this in their area. Any Half Cats Reported?HAVE YOU EVER HAD ANY REPORTS ABOUT HALF CATS OR SMALL ANIMALSFOUND CUT IN HALF IN WHICH THE UPPER HALF OF THE BODY IS REMOVED,OR THE LOWER HALF, AND IT'S ALWAYS JUST A HALF LEFT. NO BLOOD, NOTRACKS, AND CUT CLEANLY?No, not that I'm aware of.THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS HAPPENED A LOT IN THE UNITED STATES,CANADA, ENGLAND. THE KANGAROOS REMIND ME OF THAT PHENOMENON.No, I think that's something new to us. I can't think of certainly not this kind of number (ofdeaths) over such a short period of time. Dealing with animal cruelty means dealing withall sorts of weird, violent acts. But this is strange in the number of animals in the samegeographic place in such a short period of time. In Australia, I think at this stage it makes ita pretty unique situation.\"More Information:To Report Information to the RSPCAIf anyone listening has any information about the bizarre kangaroo beheadings at theYarrambat Golf Course northeast of Melbourne, the RSPCA has a phone number, websiteand e-mail.The phone number in Burwood east, Victoria, Australia is: 03-9224-2222 (Dialing fromU.S. 011-61-3-9224-2222)The website is: http://www.rspcavic.org/The e-mail address is: rspca@rspcavic.org.auFor more information about advanced beam technology that has been seen lifting animalsinto glowing discs, please see my two books, Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I and II inEarthfiles Shop.Also, please see other Earthfiles reports about advanced beam technologies and animal"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"mutilations in Earthfiles Archives:· 08/11/2005 -- Part 4: Two Men See Cow Mutilated in Light Beam· 08/03/2005 -- Part 3: Two Men See Cow Mutilated in Light Beam· 07/26/2005 -- Part 2: Two Men See Cow Mutilated in Light Beam· 07/22/2005 -- Part 1: Two Men See Cow Mutilated in Light Beam· 07/07/2005 -- Part 2: Eyewitness Description of Cattle Mutilation· 07/04/2005 -- Part 1: Eyewitness Description of Cattle Mutilation· 01/05/2003 -- Cattle Mutilation - The Unthinkable Truth, Chapter 2, Part Two· 12/31/2002 -- Deer Dropped Into New York Maple Tree - From Where?· 10/26/2002 -- Chapter 10 - Mystery Stalks the Prairie· 07/23/2002 -- Mysterious, Buzzing Light in Tehachapi, California· 10/29/2000 -- Unusual Bull Death Near St. Paul, Alberta, CanadaCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
