January 21, 2005 Santa Cruz, California - The seven Canary Islands owned by Spainrise above the Atlantic Ocean west of Morocco, Africa. One of them, La Palma, is notonly the steepest island in the world, but has also been the most volcanically active of theCanaries in the past 500 years. On it is the 4-mile high volcano called Cumbre Vieja, whichmeans \"Old Summit.\" The volcano has been re-building itself for the past 15,000 yearssince it last blew apart and collapsed huge amounts of rock into the surrounding ocean,sending out a giant tsunami that has been detected in deposits as far away as the Bahamasand Bermuda. Over the past 15,000 years, the volcano kept erupting under water, buildingback up from the Atlantic sea bed three miles below the water surface to its present height,which is now more than a mile above the Atlantic. Its last two eruptions were 1971 and1949.During the 1949 eruption, the western side of the island slipped 16 feet downward towardsthe sea and opened up a 2-kilometer-long fracture which is visible today. It is believed thatthis process was driven by the pressure caused by the rising magma heating and vaporizingwater trapped within the structure of the island. Now geologists think that western side ofthe volcano is unstable. During another future eruption, as much as 500 cubic kilometersof that western side could collapse into the Atlantic waters. If that happened - as incredibleas it sounds - computer models indicate the tsunami at the collapse site could be more thana kilometer high. That would be more than half a mile of water rise at La Palma after allthe estimated 500 billion tons of rock fell rapidly and displaced an equivalent amount ofwater.Computer models show that as the water moves out at 500 mph across the Atlantic Ocean,by the time it reaches the East Coast of North America and as far south as Brazil some 8 to12 hours later, the tsunami could be as high as 165 feet when it hits shorelines in northernBrazil. That's a 15-story-building!"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"A scientist who began studying the Cumbre Vieja volcano in the mid-1990s and thepossible consequences of such a mega-tsunami on the east coast of North America andBrazil is British geologist, Simon Day, Ph.D. Dr. Day is now Visiting Associate Researcherfrom University College, London, in the Department of Earth Sciences, University ofCalifornia - Santa Cruz, California. Recently I asked him about the potential tsunamidanger of the volcano and if he had confidence in the accuracy of the computer modelingprojections which some other geologists dispute.Cumbre Vieja volcano today on Island of La Palma, Canary Islands, (Spain).Interview:Simon Day, Ph.D., Visiting Associate Research Geologist from University College,London, now in the Department of Earth Sciences, University of California - SantaCruz, California: \"At some stage in the future, La Palma might do the same. After aseries of eruptions in each of which it moves a little bit, it could eventually collapsecatastrophically and produce a landslide of a few hundred cubic kilometers, taking awaythe whole side of the volcano and dumping it into the ocean as a landslide. That's whatwould then generate the giant tsunami waves. Cumbre Vieja Volcano Collapse Could ProduceMega-Tsunamis20 to 55 Yards High On North and South American EastCoastsYOUR COMPUTER MODELING SHOWS THAT THE TSUNAMI COULD BE AS HIGHAS 55 YARDS (165 feet) IN BRAZIL.You have to remember that the tsunami will be very much larger near the source and willthen as it spreads out from a few very large waves into a series of smaller waves, it willdiminish in height as it crosses the ocean. Then, of course, as tsunamis do, it will build upagain on the other side. But the sorts of heights that the computer model is predicting forthe Eastern seaboard in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean and for northernBrazil are in that sort of range several tens of meters high as a maximum value.IF SOMETHING WERE 55 YARDS, WHICH IS OVER 150 FEET, THAT WOULD BEAT LEAST A 15-STORY BUILDING.Yeah, it's that sort of size. Following events in the Indian Ocean, we'll now have acomparison which is the tsunamis there the La Palma collapse would produce a tsunami atleast a few times larger in terms of wave heights than the tsunami in the Indian Ocean was.(Those very high waves) would be very close to source, but what we're talking about is theheight of the wave as it reaches the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. So, along a muchgreater length of seaboard.WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NEW YORK, BOSTON, WASHINGTON, D. C. WE'RETALKING ABOUT ONE OF THE LARGEST POPULATION CORRIDORS IN THEUNITED STATE S.That's correct. I think one of the lessons from the Indian Ocean tsunami is just how muchdamage a tsunami can do when it strikes a densely populated coast line and particularly,those cities on the eastern seaboard that face the ocean directly. They would potentially beunder very considerable threat from such a wave.HAS THERE BEEN ANY 15-STORY-HIGH TSUNAMI ON RECORD FROMANYTHING HAPPENING IN THE CANARY ISLANDS OR THAT AREA IN THE"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"PAST?Not in human historical record, because the last collapse of this type that occurred in theCanary Islands occurred at least 15,000 years ago, and perhaps much longer than that. Butin terms of the geologic record, there have been a number of these volcanic collapses inthe Canaries and also into other island groups in the Atlantic, like the Cape Verde Islandswhich are further south than the Canaries. So, in terms of the geologic record, these thingsare not unprecedented at all.THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT EVEN IF IT WERE 15,000 YEARS AGO THAT BIGSWAMPING TSUNAMI FLOODS DID HIT THE EAST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA?That's right. And the one 15,000 years ago, sea level would have been significantly lowerthan present and the coast line would have been much further out. So, we don't have directrecords of that. But there are a number of deposits on, for example, the Bahamas and inBermuda that have been tentatively linked to tsunamis that might have been produced byprevious volcano collapses in the Canaries.WHAT DO THOSE DEPOSITS CONSIST OF?Very, very large boulders, great chunks of the reef weighing as much as a couple ofthousand tons that have been ripped off the edge of the reef and are carried inland by thewaves.SO THE EDUCATED GUESS IS THAT FOR THAT KIND OF FORCE TO LIFT THATSIZE OF ISLAND CHUNKS INLAND, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE LARGE WATER?That's right. If it was a tsunami wave in one of these very rapid floods, very turbulentfloods similar to those that we've seen in the video footage from the Indian Ocean, we'd belooking at waves at least a few tens of meters high. So, pretty high thirty yards plus (atleast 90 feet high) necessary to move boulders of that size over great distances.What is important is the question whether or not at some stage in the near future, one ofthese eruptions is going to give enough push to the flank of the island to cause it tocollapse? That's the big question.CAUSE COLLAPSE IN THE VULNERABLE SIDE OF THE VOLCANO.That's right, on that vulnerable western side of the volcano. What Would A Mega-Tsunami Do To American East Coast?Compare to Krakatoa Volcano Explosion in 1883[Editor's Note: When Krakatoa erupted on August 26, 1883, the entire northern portion ofthe island was blown away. The blast has been estimated to have had the power of 100megatons of TNT. That explosion was heard over 4,800 kilometers (2,983 miles) away onthe island of Rodrigues. The pressure waves in the atmosphere circled the earth seven anda half times before fading away. For two and a half days, the whole region was clouded indarkness. The estimated amount of material ejected into the atmosphere was 11 cubicmiles, 21 cubic kilometers. Only one-third of the volcanic caldera remained above sealevel.Tsunamis from Krakatoa: A series of large tsunami waves generated by the mainexplosion, some reaching a height of nearly 40 meters (more than 120 feet) above sealevel, killed some 37,000 people in the coastal towns and villages along the Sunda Strait onJava and Sumatra islands. Tsunami waves were recorded or observed throughout theIndian Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, the American West Coast, South America, and even asfar away as the English Channel. Krakatoa is located between the Indonesian Islands ofJava and Sumatra and lies in a small group of islands, known as the Sunda Straight.]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Computer model tsunami projections based on 500 cubic kilometers of the Cumbre Viejavolcano on the (arrow) La Palma Island, Canary Islands, sliding rapidly into the Atlantic Ocean.Red-to-orange-to-yellow outer edge of 500-mph-expanding Cumbre Vieja volcano\"mega-tsunami,\" after potential collapse of 500 cubic kilometer section of volcano.

Mega-Tsunami Travel Time to North and South America:8 to 11 HoursIF THE CUMBRE VIEJA VOLCANO DID COLLAPSE, HOW MUCH TIME WOULDTHERE BE BETWEEN THAT MOMENT AND THE TSUNAMI REACHING NEWYORK AND THE EAST COAST?According to Steve Ward's computer models and I think other computer models wouldagree on the travel time indicate between 8 to 10 or 11 hours for different parts of theNorth and South American coasts. So, there would be a certain amount of warningbetween the collapse and the arrival of the waves. The big question is: would that be"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"sufficient to evacuate coastal areas? Or would it be necessary to start an evacuationearlier? For example, on the basis that the flank of the volcano was moving very fast andperhaps was accelerating, might suggest that it was about to collapse catastrophically. Inwhich case, the goal might be to try to predict a collapse, maybe two or three days inadvance, and say provide two or three days in which evacuation could be carried out.WHAT KIND OF DEVASTATION WOULD OCCUR? ASSUMING YOU COULD GETPEOPLE OUT, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE CITY ITSELF?We can get an idea from the Indian Ocean tsunami and also from the 30-yard-high wavesthat were produced locally by the Krakatoa eruption in 1883. I suppose the nearestanalogy we have in our experience are the very strong stone lighthouses. AroundKrakatoa, those were completely destroyed when they were struck by tsunami waves with20-meter-plus heights.SO THE STONE LIGHTHOUSES WERE LITERALLY PHYSICALLY DESTROYEDAND THE WATER REDUCED THEM TO LIKE THESE MOONSCAPES LIKE WEHAVE SEEN IN SUMATRA AND THAILAND?Absolutely. There are photographs taken soon after the Krakatoa tsunamis in photographsand they look exactly like the very worst damaged areas in Sumatra and Thailand. Butthere, they had only 10-meter-high tsunamis which are very much less destructive than the20-meter-plus higher waves.WHAT DO YOU THINK THE LIKELIHOOD OF THIS OCCURRING THIS CENTURYCOULD BE?That really is the question, isn't it? The probability of an eruption of this volcano occurringin this century is pretty high. In fact, I think it's almost certain. The problem is: Is thateruption the one that is going to trigger the collapse? Or is it just going to cause the fault tomove another few yards or tens of yards and then the thing stops again? And that we reallydon't know. It's really going to be important to monitor the volcano during its nexteruption, or few eruptions. Then at that stage, we'll really be in a much better position tosay this is going to occur next on the volcano or not. Or isn't going to occur for the nextseveral eruptions in which case, it becomes a more distant prospect.But, of course, the thing is in geological terms, this is going to happen very soon in termsof the geological time scale. And so, you have to consider it as a real possibility every timethe volcano erupts. As I said, it's almost certain that the volcano is going to erupt at leastonce probably twice in the next century.WITH REALLY DIRE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE EASTERN SIDE OF NORTHAMERICA IF THAT VOLCANO COLLAPSES.That's right. The key question is: how many more eruptions are going to occur before itcollapses. It might be ten or twenty eruptions in which case the collapse might not occurfor a couple of thousand years. But at some stage in the very near geologic future,something like this is going to happen.AND IT COULD HAPPEN IN THIS CENTURY?It could. The probability is pretty low, but it's something that has to be considered as apossibility every time the volcano erupts.\" How Accurate Is the UC-Santa Cruz Cumbre ViejaCollapse Computer Model by Steve Ward?Dr. Day and his UC-Santa Cruz colleague and computer modeling expert, Steve Ward,checked the accuracy of their model against what happened on Ritter Island in Papua,New Guinea, in 1888, after a volcanic landslide produced tsunamis back then. Dr. Day andDr. Ward went to Ritter Island to map the landslide distribution and studied eyewitnessaccounts. When Dr. Ward ran his computer model with Ritter Island data, it described thecollapse, dispersion and tsunamis quite accurately.Websites:Steve Ward's Computer Models, UC-Santa Cruz: http://es.ucsc.edu/~ward/Steve Ward's Computer Model Moving Video File: http://es.ucsc.edu/~ward/LP_tsu_Atlantic_small.mov"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
