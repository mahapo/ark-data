Image 1997 by CDC. November 13, 2005 Washington, D. C. - The Centers for Disease Control and WorldHealth Organization confirm that the 21st person has been infected with H5N1 bird flu inThailand. The victim is an 18-month-old boy now in a Bangkok hospital. Medicalauthorities think the child contracted the deadly virus from three fighting cocks and achicken kept at the family's home in Bangkok. All those birds died soon after the child washospitalized. So far, twenty-one people in Thailand have been infected by the H5N1 birdflu and 13 have died. China reported on November 11, more H5N1 infections of poultry there that killed 300chickens in Liaoning Province northeast of Beijing. There have been eight H5N1outbreaks in china so far, but so far no human cases have been reported. The governmenthas destroyed more than 2.5 million birds. Kuwait and other Middle East countries have feared the spread of H5N1 into theirterritories by migrating birds. On Friday, November 11, the fear was realized when aflamingo found on a Kuwaiti beach was confirmed to have the H5N1 deadly strain of birdflu - the first known case in the Arab world. Mohammed al-Mihana of Kuwait's PublicAuthority for Agriculture and Fisheries said the flamingo was imported and had beenquarantined at the airport. The bird was destroyed. Kuwait is also fumigating farms andbird markets and are trying to monitor bird migratory routes for any signs of unusual aviandeaths. Currently, killing and incinerating H5N1-infected birds has been the first line of defensesince 1997 when H5N1 first showed up in very ill Hong Kong patients. H5N1 had neverbeen seen in people before then and several people died. That set off loud alarm bells inthe world medical community and the Hong Kong government had more than a millionchickens destroyed. But even though killing and incinerating infected birds has beenstandard operating procedure for nearly ten years, the H5N1 virus has continued to spreadthrough migratory birds. Now the deadly virus is in Europe, spreading in October toKazakstan, Russia, Romania, Croatia, Turkey and Greece. Between November 1st and 2ndin Russia, two more birds died from H5N1, bringing the total in that country to more than4,000 bird deaths either from the H5N1 virus or slaughtering. It's now estimated that morethan 140 million birds in southeast Asia, China and Europe have been destroyed. But what worries authorities is the virus's persistence and increasing virulence, killinginfected birds within 24 hours and killing some humans within five days who have pickedup the virus from birds.Not only is the latest bird flu virus more virulent in lab animal tests, it seems to beincreasing its virulence among wild water birds. The World Health Organization reportedin the spring of 2005 that at least 6,000 wild migratory geese at a nature reserve in central"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"China, suddenly died from an H5N1 strain. W.H.O. described the large number of rapiddeaths as \"highly unusual and probably unprecedented.\" Vietnam Scientists Report H5N1Has \"Mutated into A More Dangerous Form\"Poultry handl ers in Vi etnam w ear masks tryi ng to protect themsel vesfrom H5N1 avian influenza virus that has infected and killed more people in their countrythan anywhere in the world so far. Photograph © 2005 by Reuters.Now scientists in Vietnam, where bird flu has killed 42 people, report their investigationshows the H5N1 avian flu virus has \"mutated into a more dangerous form that could breedmore effectively in mammals.\" Cao Bao Van, Director of the Molecule BiologyDepartment of the Pasteur Institute, which is Vietnam's bird flu research center, reportedthis weekend that DNA analysis of 24 samples of the H5N1 virus taken from poultry andhumans showed significant changes of the deadly virus's surface proteins, known as\"antigen variation.\"So far, the H5N1 virus mutations have not made it possible for the virus to spread inhuman sneezing and coughing. But such surface protein changes can lead to human-to-human transmission of the bird flu virus, similar to what happened in 1918 when theSpanish Flu killed more than 50 million people around the planet. Recently scientistsannounced that the 1918 virus also originated in birds and has similarities to the H5N1now spreading through migratory birds. If that happens, the potential for a global pandemicthat could kill millions of people is possible.The American government's preparation plan includes:- Increased monitoring for H5N1 illness in humans.- Stockpiling anti-virals and vaccines that might work against the H5N1 virus. Currently,there are some promising vaccines being tested on humans.- Increasing public health's ability to deal with overwhelming numbers of people going tohospital emergency rooms.- And keeping the public aware about what the facts are.To do this, the Bush Administration wants Congress to make $7.1 billion available tomodernize flu vaccine production in the United States. The goal is to be able to inoculateevery American all 300 million of us within 6 months of a pandemic's eruption.The problem is that could take years! The government's goal is 2010. That's only five yearsfrom now and the H5N1 virus is unpredictable, mutating and any day could change intoone that can transmit human-to-human. China's most famous virologist, Dr. Guan Yi, andhis research team, have already sequenced the genetic code for more than 250 strains ofH5N1. That means H5 bird flu virus has changed 250 times in less than a decade,becoming more virulent, not less.H5N1 is now expected to spread through western Russia by spring 2006, where the densityof population and farms is ten times higher than the Far East. So far, no humans in Russiahave contracted the bird flu but Newsweek reported in its November 7th issue that therehave been 138 human cases in southeast Asians, of which at least 69 people have died.That 50% mortality rate in human victims is generally persisting beyond Thailand andVietnam to Cambodia, Indonesia, and China. What no one knows is when? or if? the H5N1virus that's supposed to infect only birds, will mutate into a virus that can spread human-to-human through sneezing and coughing. That's the nightmare medical people are worriedabout."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"How Do People Get the H5N1 Virus?By handling infected birds or bird feces during slaughter, butchering, removing feathers orpreparing raw poultry for cooking. There is also some evidence that mammals such as pigswhich were originally thought to be resistant to avian flu, have also become infected withthe H5N1 virus from birds and subsequently might infect human pig handlers throughcontact. There are 15 different subtypes of H5 avian influenza that spreads among birds.But H5N1 and H7 are the only avian flu virus strains that kill so effectively. What Are the Bird Flu Symptoms in Humans?High fever, body aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, that lead to hepatitis, kidney failureand an abnormal deficiency in all blood cells: red, white, and platelets. That means thatH5N1 infection affects more body organs and systems than normal flu and H5N1 killsdirectly and rapidly while other flu deaths are often related to secondary infections causedby bacteria. Can World Medical Community Stop A Pandemic?Recently I talked about the pandemic threat with computer modelers who are studyinghow to contain the H5N1 avian virus as soon as there is any evidence of human-to-humantransmission anywhere in the world. See: 102605 Earthfiles. One model shows that ifall the families in an infected area quarantined themselves, and as many people as possibleare treated for ten days with an antiviral medicine, such as Tamiflu, and H5N1 vaccines -an eruption of H5N1 among people might be contained. Progress is being made inAmerican and other laboratories to produce an H5N1 vaccine based on the virus that haskilled humans so far. The problem is that a mutation of H5N1 into human transmissioncould have surface proteins so different that vaccines might have limited effectiveness.But all medical authorities agree that an H5N1 vaccine must be developed and be ready tohelp slow down a potential pandemic.If antivirals such as Tamiflu and Flu Mist are used prophylactively that means at the veryfirst sign of fever, sore throat and body aches or as soon as a family member or workcolleague becomes ill the antiviral can be 86% effective in slowing down viral spread inthe human body. Tamiflu has even stopped some H5N1 strains in lab tests. Now theproblem is hoarding. The American sales of Tamiflu have quadrupled the past few months,provoking the Swiss pharmaceutical, Roche, who makes Tamiflu to temporarily suspendshipments to the United States. Roche needs supplies for other countries. So now there is aplan for Roche to build a Tamiflu anti-viral production plant in the United Statesspecifically to cope with an impending pandemic.More Information:For more about the H5N1 avian flu threat, please see other Earthfiles reports below inEarthfiles Archives:· 10/26/2005 -- Updated - H5N1 Bird Flu - The Next Pandemic?· 07/22/2005 -- H5N1 Bird Flu Virus Kills Three Indonesians· 06/21/2005 -- Vietnamese Doctor Studying H5N1 Bird Flu Falls Victim to Virus· 06/03/2005 -- West Nile and Bird Flu: Two Increasingly Dangerous Viruses· 03/12/2005 -- Could Avian Flu H5N1 Cause the Next Pandemic?· 01/29/2004 -- Unprecedented Outbreak of Avian Flu Has Killed Ten People in Asia· 01/13/2004 -- Updated: SARS and Bird Flu Back in Asia· 12/16/2003 -- Colorado Doctor Suspects Fujian Flu Has Hit Elderly Hard· 01/18/2003 -- Can the United States Cope with Bioterrorism Attacks?Websites: World Health Organization (W.
