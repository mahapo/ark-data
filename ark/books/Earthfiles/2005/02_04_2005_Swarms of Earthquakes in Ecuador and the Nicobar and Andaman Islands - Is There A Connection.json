Â© 2005 by Linda Moulton Howe \"On January 27th, seismometers around the world were recording a quake every 20minutes. ... I don't think we have ever seen this many magnitude 5 earthquakesconcentrated in one location on the surface of the Earth, at least not in modern times.\"Goran Ekstrom, Harvard Geophysicist February 4, 2005 Cambridge, Massachusetts - Intense swarms of earthquakes,generally between 5 and 6 on the Richter Scale, began shaking the Nicobar and AndamanIslands north of Sumatra on January 26th. The next day, January 27th, seismometersaround the world were recording an earthquake every 20 minutes. Indian Ocean residentsand geophysicists began to wonder if it all was leading up to another large seismic event even if the quakes were aftershocks of the huge 9.0 that occurred off the coast of BandaAceh, Sumatra in Indonesia, on the morning of December 26, 2004.

North of Banda Aceh are the Nicobar and Andaman Islandswhere intense earthquake swarms occurred the last week of January 2005.Also in late January, half way around the world on Ecuador's Pacific coast, dozens ofearthquakes also in magnitudes of 5 to 6, were scaring residents. Ecuador's Director of theGeophysics Institute announced he did not think all the quakes were building up to amonster that could cause a devastating tsunami as had happened in the Indian Ocean. Butthere were no guarantees.So I went to two of the world's leading seismic authorities to ask about the quake swarmsin the Nicobar and Andaman Islands and the simultaneous quake activity in Ecuador. Iwas surprised to learn there actually might be a connection.First, about the late January seismic swarm in Indonesia, I talked this week with GoranEkstrom, Ph.D., Professor of Geology and Geophysics at the Department of Earth andPlanetary Sciences in Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts.Interviews:Goran Ekstrom, Ph.D., Professor of Geology and Geophysics, Department of Earthand Planetary Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts: \"The swarmthat we're seeing just east of Nicobar Islands is extremely unusual. It started on January26, and since that time as you mentioned, we've had approximately 150 magnitude 5earthquakes. There are many more than are actually on the USGS web page that they aretrying to locate right now. It is occurring to the east of the very large December 26, 2004earthquake. They could be labeled 'aftershocks.' They are certainly related to that verylarge earthquake. But the activity is very much focused a few hundred kilometers east ofwhere the December 26 earthquake occurred.This is a very complicated area geologically and there are many faults to the east of theNicobar and Andaman Islands further north that generate earthquakes occasionally notvery large earthquakes. So, there would be a few every year of this size, even if there hadnot been a large earthquake.MEANING SOMEWHERE AROUND 5 TO 6 ON THE RICHTER SCALE?That's right. So, even though it's a very unusual phenomenon. I don't think we have everseen this many magnitude 5 earthquakes concentrated in one location on the surface of theEarth, at least not in modern times.The swarm really peaked on January 27. Started on Jan. 26th and on Jan. 27th, we had Ithink 50 earthquakes. It must have been if anyone felt these, it's a bit out in the ocean, soI'm not sure that they were felt by people on the Nicobar Islands which are very remoteislands. They basically had a magnitude 5 earthquake every 20 minutes for the whole day.Then on January 28, we had about 30 earthquakes of this size. since that time, it hasdeclined.And the reason for these quakes happening in such a concentrated fashion is that the areahas been affected by the extremely large earthquake in December meaning that thingshave moved and all of these blocks of rock and crust in this area is responding to this verylarge earthquake by moving a little bit faster and releasing the stresses building up in therock a little bit faster than normal.COULD IT LEAD TO ANOTHER LARGE EARTHQUAKE AND LARGE TSUNAMI INTHE REGION?In order for there to be a tsunami that goes out into the ocean and causes destruction faraway from where the earthquake occurred, generally we need there has to be a very largeearthquake maybe bigger than 8.5, maybe magnitude 9.0. Smaller earthquakes can causewhat we call 'local tsunamis' that is very close to the earthquake, you can have massivewater waves affecting the local region which has happened in the past. I can think ofplaces like in Nicaragua we had one 10 years ago. We've had some in New Guinea. Thesecause local waves, but the earthquakes are not large enough to create the very massivetsunami waves that were generated by the Dec. 26th earthquake.\" 7.0 Earthquake in Nicaragua GeneratedLocally Destructive Tsunami on September 1, 1992"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Along Nicaragua's Pacific coast on September 1, 1992,an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 generated a tsunami withwaves between 8 and 15 meters high that struck 26 towns.

The Antipode TheoryBut the December 26, 2004, earthquake that measured a magnitude 9.0 on the Richterscale off the Banda Aceh, Sumatra, coast was so big it might have set in motion whatgeophysicists refer to as a theoretical \"antipode effect.\" Antipode means any two places onthe Earth that are directly opposite each other.So, it is not surprising to seismologist John Derr, Ph.D., that the Nicobar and AndamanIslands in the Indian Ocean are precisely 180 degrees opposite Ecuador in South America.Dr. Derr is a research geophysicist at the U. S. Geological Survey's Global SeismologicalObservatories and the Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory in Albuquerque, NewMexico. When I asked him if there could be any connection between the Nicobar andAndaman Islands intense seismic swarm and the earthquakes in Ecuador, I was surprisedto hear about the antipode theory.John Derr, Ph.D., Geophysicist, Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory and GlobalSeismological Observatories, U. S. Geological Survey, Albuquerque, New Mexico:\"It's very clear that this swarm has been triggered by the main earthquake and it looks tome as if we have a major stress-relieving process going on on this strike slip fault.Half a world away in Ecuador, we have something that I'm speculating is going to be veryinteresting and something that should be looked at very closely. Because Ecuador isprecisely at the antipode for these earthquakes that is precisely half way around the world.The body waves that go deep into the Earth are going to go straight through the middle ofthe center of the core on their way to the antipode. But the surface waves radiate out fromthe epicenter and converge at the antipode. And it's entirely conceivable that that mighttrigger some sort of motion on the faults under Ecuador.Now, the earthquake activity that's happening in Ecuador is off the coast, but thesubduction zone dips steeply under Ecuador and actually as far east as western Brazil. So,there are places on that fault zone that are at the antipode from these earthquakeshappening in Indonesia (Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India) precisely at the antipode.IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ECUADOR COULD BE SHAKEN UP ENOUGH FOR A LARGEEARTHQUAKE TO OCCUR AND CAUSE A TSUNAMI IN THAT REGION?I don't think the earthquake risk is measurably greater than it was 3 or 6 months ago. Butthat is not to say that the risk is not there. In fact, the risk from tsunamis all along the westcoast of South America is very, very great. We know from past history, there have beendevastating tsunamis in various sections of that coastline when the subduction zone breaks.People need to take precautions. The first thing people need to learn is if you see the seareceding, don't run out to grab a fish. Run for high ground! You may have ten or fifteenminutes, if you are lucky, to get to high ground before the sea comes back with avengeance. That's the first thing to teach people to mitigate loss of life.The next thing is to try to get these fishing villages to move to higher ground, if it's at allpossible. Everything built along the beach is subject to being washed away. In fact, itWILL be washed away. We just don't know when.THAT LEADS TO THE WORK YOU ARE DOING NOW IN TERMS OF INCREASINGTHE GLOBAL SEISMIC NETWORKING AS WELL AS WHAT IS GOING ON IN THEUNITED STATES. COULD YOU EXPLAIN YOUR CURRENT WORK?Here at the Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory U. S. Geological Survey, we install andmaintain a global network of seismograph stations in cooperation with the Univ. ofCalifornia-San Diego. Our two institutions work under the umbrella of the IRIS consortium IRIS being an acronym for Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology. It's a"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"university consortium that is funded primarily by the National Science Foundation toestablish these state-of-the-art observatories all over the world, trying to get them about2000 kilometers apart.There are plenty of areas in the oceans where there is no land to do that. The IRIS isbeginning to look at ocean bottom seismographs to try to cover those areas. But at themoment, we're looking at a network of perhaps 150 stations around the world at thatdensity to send data in real time back to the National Earthquake Information Center inGolden, Colorado.The nature of digital transmission over the internet is such that it is not just Golden thatgets it in real time. We see it here and we look at the data and do quality control on thesestations and try to keep them operating just as efficiently and competently as possible.WHY IN THIS INDONESIAN EVENT, WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG FOR THERE TOBE ANY KIND OF WARNING? IN FACT, THE TSUNAMIS HITTING THE BEACHESIS WHAT ALERTED THE WORLD THAT SOMETHING MAJOR WAS OCCURRING.There are fundamental problems. If you have an alarm on your seismograph that triggerswith the first arrivals; it's the middle of the night and you're living next to the instruments,the alarm rings, you jump out of bed, you run to the instruments, the computer has locatedsomething by that time and you trigger a watch for a tsunami. That takes minutes andunder the best of circumstances, maybe you have 15 minutes. By that time, the first wavehas hit the beach closest to the epicenter. A little bit farther away, you have time to getsome warning out. But since you don't know how close to the epicenter any particularsection of the beach is going to be, everyone needs to learn what to do. If you're on thebeach and you feel strong shaking and it lasts for more than 30 seconds, don't worry aboutlooking at the ocean to see what it's going to do. Head for high ground!RIGHT, AND IS IT TRUE THAT BECAUSE IT WAS CHRISTMAS NIGHT OFDECEMBER 25 IN NORTH AMERICA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE PLANET INVARIOUS TIME ZONES BUT STILL CHRISTMAS THAT NO ONE WAS PAYINGMUCH ATTENTION OR GOT WARNINGS OUT?In fact, the folks in Honolulu at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center live pretty close tothe beach.DID THEY TRY TO WARN INDIA AND ALL?They did. They saw it was a very big earthquake. They saw it was not going to affect thePacific basin with a tsunami that would be measurable enough to cause damage. Theyknew it was possible in the Indian Ocean. They knew that by the time they located theearthquake that things were going on the coast of Sumatra. But there is no mechanism atthe moment for disseminating that kind of warning.HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE BEFORE SUCH A NETWORK ISWORKING IN THE INDIAN OCEAN AND THAT AREA?As a rough guess, it could be anywhere from one to 3 or 4 years or longer, depending uponthe priority that nations give to this thing.\" NOAA Proposes Global Network of Deep Water PressureSensor BuoysCurrently, NOAA has proposed a network of tide deep water pressure sensor buoys to bedistributed all around the Atlantic, Caribbean and Pacific coasts of the U. S. Dr. Derr saidthe government is concerned not only about earthquakes but the tsunamis that could begenerated by asteroid impacts as well. If Congress funds the NOAA network, it could be inplace as early as 2007.More Information:John Derr, Ph.D.: \"Tide deep water type gauges: these are buoys that can be anchored indeep water up to 10,000 to 15,000 feet deep. They have pressure sensors on the bottom ofthe ocean which are so sensitive that they can tell if a tsunami is passing over them. Whenthe buoys sense that, they send a signal by acoustic telemetry through the water to thebuoy above them. That buoy then reads that signal and re-transmits it to a satellite and thesatellite data then go back to the tsunami warning centers. Currently, there are only six ofthese buoys anchored off of Alaska and the west coast of the United States."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"NOAA has proposed a network of these all around the Pacific Ocean and along theAtlantic and Caribbean coasts of the United States. These should also be installed aroundthe Indian Ocean, we know now. For that matter, there ought to be some of these all overthe world because tsunamis are not generated only by earthquakes. They can be generatedby asteroid impacts as well. Asteroid impacts are no respecter of seismic reactive zones.It's entirely possible the network could be distributed on or about 2007 if money isappropriated, and if there is a will to do it and if there is international cooperation. Whenyou have a network of gauges around the world, it's like having a network of seismographstations around the world. You need a number of field engineers who are maintainingthem. That means regular preventative maintenance visits to every single site and on-callmaintenance when something fails.\" Richter Magnitude Range (USGS)Richter Magnitudes Earthquake Effects  Frequency ofOccurrenceLess than 2.0 (\"Micro\") Not felt.
