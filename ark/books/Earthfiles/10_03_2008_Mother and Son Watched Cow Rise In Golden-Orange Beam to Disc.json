T.s who mutilated animals and abducted the mother and son in the beam of light.” - L eo Sprinkle, Ph.D., Prof. Emeritus, Psychology C olorado Grazing Association's mutilated cow found on July 26, 1977, with jaw stripped as thousands have been on cattle, horses, goats, sheep, deer and other animals around the world since the 1960s and before. Photograph by the Logan County Sheriff's Office, Sterling, Colorado. October 3, 2008 Laramie, Wyoming - My investigations of the worldwide bloodless animal deaths - that law enforcement has long called “mutilations” - began in September 1979, almost thirty years ago. I was Director of Special Projects in the Denver, Colorado, CBS affiliate, that was then KMGH-TV. For nine months, eighteen hours a day without stop, I tried to get to the bottom of what was causing the animal mutilation mystery. My greatest surprises were the law enforcement who told me they knew we were dealing with “creatures from outer space,” as they put it, because of the aerial discs, beams of light and even non-human creatures encountered by eyewitnesses in pastures where mutilated animals were found. N ovember 2, 1980, Greeley Tribune, Greeley, Colorado. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Three such dramatic cases of eyewitnesses seeing discs and beams of light - and even animals rising in beams of light - came to me from Leo Sprinkle, Ph.D., then Professor of Psychology and Director of Counseling and Testing at the University of Wyoming in Laramie. [ Editor's Note: Pat McGuire cattle mutilations and disc encounters in Bosler, Wyoming; Judy Doraty and her teenage daughter, Cindy, watched calf rise in beam of light outside Houston, Texas, and then was surgically cut inside disc; mother and young son watched cow rise in orange light beam and encountered variety of non-human entities in underground cavern. All three cases are included in my books An Alien Harvest and Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. 1: Facts & Eyewitnesses and my documentaries A Strange Harvest and Strange Harvests 1993 . Please see Earthfiles Shop. ] Dr. Sprinkle received his Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology from the University of Missouri in 1961. He went to work at the University of Wyoming and was one of the first professionals to help people who described close encounters with non-human entities. Eventually the phenomenon would come to be called the “UFO human abduction syndrome.” Dr. Sprinkle worked with me on my TV documentary, A Strange Harvest , and before its May 1980 broadcast, Leo received a phone call from scientist Paul Bennewitz, who owned the Thunder Mountain Laboratory near Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Paul Bennewitz was investigating an abduction case northeast of Santa Fe in Cimarron for the Aerial Phenomenon Research Organization (APRO), then run by Coral and Jim Lorenzen, now deceased. Dr. Sprinkle’s original notes of the phone call are dated Tuesday, May 6, 1980: A ppendix 13, Page 341, An Al i en Harvest © 1989 by Linda Moulton Howe. S ee: Earthfile s Shop. Some how she and her son were transported, perhaps by the orange beam as the cow was. From the air, the mother recognized a mesa she associated with the Roswell, New Mexico, area. Near there, she and her son were taken into an underground cavern. Her 6-year-old son was taken from her and she was frantic to be with him, but non-humans surrounded her on a table. She fought, called them obscenities, screamed for her son and described the beings around her as “their eyes fill more than one-half of their face, like empty holes.” Finally, a different being showed up and restored order. The mother said, “Here’s one dressed in white. Very brisk! Long fingers, real long fingers. By God! He is kind of greenish colored, too. The one in white is very brisk, calm. Seems to be the only one who knows what the hell is going on. He said, ‘Take her back now! You shouldn’t have done that’ – addressing the smaller beings with huge, black eyes. The original 32-page typed hypnosis transcript is in my first book, An Alien Harvest . [ See: Earthfiles Shop .] The transcript includes the mother’s recollection of various types of beings in the underground cavern and one particular pool of water that seemed to contain blood and organs. In that pool, she could see a humanoid-shape floating, but did not understand if it were an experiment or nutrition or what. This year of 2008 has had an upsurge in small and large animal mutilation reports all over the world. Recently, I called Dr. Sprinkle, now 78, to talk with him about his current view of the non-human phenomenon and what it was like for him in May 1980, to have a 6-year-old boy with his mother describing such dramatic events."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Interview: Leo Sprinkle, Ph.D., former Director of the Dept. of Counseling and Testing and Prof. Emeritus of Psychology, University of Wyoming, Laramie, Wyoming: “He was a cute little boy. Mother and son white Caucasian. Both attractive and intelligent. Both were frightened at the experience of seeing a calf lifted up in the air in a beam of light into a flying saucer. The hypnosis session with the boy did not reveal much more than what he remembered consciously. But he said there was a cow going up into the craft. He was talking to his mother about it. They were both seeing it. It’s a good case as a double witness. I REMEMBER YOU AND I TALKING ABOUT THIS AND IF I RECALL CORRECTLY, BACK IN 1980, YOU WERE TELLING ME THAT THE MOTHER GOT SO ENRAGED SEEING TWO HUMANOIDS DOWN WITH THE COW FIRST IN THE PASTURE. SHE PULLED THE CAR OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND WAS YELLING AT THEM TO STOP HURTING THE COW. Yeah, she had a conscious memory of the flying saucer and then the unconscious memory of being onboard and coming back. Then later, during the hypnosis, remembering what happened. She saw herself having experienced something very unusual, not only the craft and golden- orange light that seemed to be not only something that was alive, but was carrying the young calf up. Both saw the craft and cow. But there was more and as we went through hypnosis with the mother, she felt like she was on board the craft, that she heard her son crying in the distance. She was so angry at the extraterrestrials keeping her separate because she wanted to be with her son. She painted the E. T.s as curious, as efficient, but she was feeling like not only was she being probed and examined, but kept from her son, which was her main concern. The E. T.s kept saying her son would be OK. Sometimes she painted the word pictures like, ‘Eat shit!’ ‘You sons of bitches!’ and so on. That was very dramatic and at the same time expressed very eloquently her feelings. WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION OF HER? I saw her as a young woman who was attempting to be not only a good mother for her son, but trying to be a good participant in the hypnosis sessions. Paul had talked to her and he wanted us to be enclosed in a car with tinfoil on the ceiling thinking that the E. T.s would be monitoring us during the hypnosis sessions. So, we put up with rather strange conditions. And yet, she handled it very well. LEO, DO I UNDERSTAND THAT THE FIRST HYPNOSIS SESSION WAS INSIDE OF A CAR THAT HAD TINFOIL ON THE ROOF? Yes, inside. Paul wanted it to be protected from any external rays from the E. T.s. Paul, I saw him as very bright and knowledgeable, but suspicious of E. T.s, suspicious of military people, and by the time we met a second time for a second hypnosis session, apparently some people had gotten to him and he was very suspicious. I think a psychiatrist would say he was paranoid of everything going on around him. WHAT DID PAUL BENNEWITZ SAY TO YOU WAS HIS INTERPRETATION OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THE WOMAN AND HER SON? From Paul’s point of view it was – if not evil, close to it. She was shown an underground cavern with human or humanoid parts in there. He saw this as part of the negative and evil E. T.s and Paul wondered if the government were keeping it all closed up out of fear. Or, even worse, Paul Bennewitz wondered if the underground military governmental complex was hiding information in league with the bad E. T.s who mutilated animals and abducted the mother and son in the beam of light. Some people have said that the negative Greys are using human abductions and cattle mutilations for their own purpose and allowing people to be picked up and exchanged for E. T. technology. COULD IT HAVE BEEN THAT SHE WAS YELLING SO LOUDLY TO TRY TO GET THE HUMANOIDS TO STOP HURTING THE COW, COULD THAT HAVE BEEN WHAT DREW THE ATTENTION OF WHATEVER THE INTELLIGENCE WAS IN THE DISC THAT WAS ABOVE THE CAR THAT BOTH SHE AND HER 6-YEAR-OLD SON COULD SEE? WAS HER EFFORT TO STOP THE MUTILATION WHAT PROVOKED THE TAKING OF HER AND HER SON? That’s a good point. That’s a good possibility that that’s why it was done. Another possibility is that the E. T.s planned to pick her up. Then did, brought her on board,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"showed her a whole bunch of stuff, and then set her down and she might have been there at the pasture when another calf was brought up. In other words, it could have been staged at several levels. Why Are Dead, Mutilated Animals Left to Be Found? BUT, LEO, WHY IS IT THAT NON-HUMAN ENTITIES – ONE OR MORE TYPES – WOULD BE KILLING AND MUTILATING ANIMALS IN BOTH HEMISPHERES FOR AT LEAST 50 OR 60 YEARS, PERHAPS A CENTURY OR MORE, AND LEAVE THE CARCASSES TO BE FOUND IN THE UNUSUAL, BLOODLESS STATES, AS IF ON PURPOSE. ONE SHERIFF SAID,‘THEY ARE FLAUNTED IN OUR FACE.’ Yes, that’s a good question. In order to answer that, we’re going to have to join the larger extraterrestrial group, right? WHAT IF THE REAL PURPOSE OF MULTIPLE SPECIES OF NON-HUMANS INTERACTING WITH THIS PLANET IS BECAUSE THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR SEEDING LIFE HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE? Yes, I think they were. I think that’s what the Bible story says. My own personal view is that it’s an educational program, that we are being taught or shown that not only have we been seeded and developed by extraterrestrials, god, angels, whatever you want to call them. Some people call them space beings and some call them sons of bitches! (laughs) So, whether they are SOBs or SBs or spiritual beings or they are space beings or they are human form - that we came out of that and now we are heading back to the stars. The question is: are we ready? Some people think what we’re going through is like basic training for military service, or initiation for educational societies. We have to prove that we are ready and that means we have to be strong as a single force. It’s a joke when people back in the 1950s said, ‘That E. T. came out of that flying saucer and he asked me, ‘Who is your leader?’ Doesn’t he know who our leader is?’ Is the leader the mayor of our town? Is it the governor of our state? Is it the President of the United States? Is it the President of the United Nations? Who speaks for Earth? Who speaks for humanity? In my opinion, we have a lot of work to do to get to the point where we are a humanity. Once we are a humanity and not an autocratic, dogmatic, fascist New World Order, as some people fear, but as a series of democratically controlled groups that are bonded together as humans. When we get to that point, I think we’ll find out whether we’re ready for galactic membership. Leo Sprinkle's Abduction in 1940, Age 10 CAN YOU SHARE WITH US TODAY THE UFO ABDUCTION EXPERIENCE YOU HAD IN YOUR OWN LIFE? Yes, I don’t think it was an abduction, but that’s what people call it. When I was a kid, I had strange experiences: bloody noses, nightmares, feeling there were people around me in my room. WHERE WERE YOU LIVING? Rocky Ford, Colorado (southeast of Colorado Springs). HOW OLD? 5-years-old at that house and 10-years-old at another point in another house. When I was ten-years-old in the fifth grade, I remember going to the library. And I pulled down a big, black book about science and the first chapter was about astronomy. And on the lower right hand of a page – I can still see it in my mind – my memory is that I was looking at some stars and the caption was, ‘This part of the galaxy.’ Then the stars on the page began to move and swirl. I thought, ‘How do they do that?’ (laughs) Later, when I was 50 years old (in 1980), I had the courage finally to go through hypnosis"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"like I had been doing with many other people in my life. I had a psychology friend of mine give me hypnotic suggestions to go back to that 10-year-old experience. I pictured myself during the hypnosis session being onboard a craft looking out at the night sky with stars. There was a tall guy on my left in a spacesuit with his arm on my shoulder. I remember looking up at him and hearing him either say or think telepathically to me: ‘Leo, learn to read and write well. When you grow up, you can help other people learn about their purpose in life.’ WERE YOU LOOKING AT A BLOND BEING, A GREY ENTITY OR WHAT? It looked more like human to me, but more like in a spacesuit. And I remember ten years later in 1990, as a psychologist, I could go on saying, ‘Oh, it could have been a daydream. It could have been a fantasy. It could have been an illusion.’ But then a young woman, Marika Shields from Denver – she was talking about her abduction experience of being onboard a craft and brought back by guys in spacesuits like long legged human kids’ pajamas that go around the foot. And I started to sob. Because I was remembering the experience. I was talking to about 200 people at our UFO conference at the University of Wyoming and one woman in the back said, ‘Oh, good, Leo is suffering like the rest of us!’ (laughs) I was sobbing and tearing up because I was remembering the suit and the face seemed to me to be human-like. I know a lot of people have E. T. robots, they have straw-people. I’ve talked to people who have had reptilian or insectoid and a lot of people with the Grey types. A lot of people think that’s all that E. T.s are, the Greys with big, black eyes. But as far as I was concerned, the being next to me was human-like and he was saying to me, ‘Leo, learn to read and write well. When you grow up, you can help other people learn more about their purpose in life.’ Well, what does a 10-year-old kid know about purpose in life? So, I couldn’t remember that experience consciously. But it was part of my psychological and spiritual development. I wanted to know more about science. I wanted to know more about religion. I could not understand why science and religion cannot be combined. In my view now, I think what we have learned from religion and science is coming together. BUT, LEO, WHY DO YOU THINK THAT MEMORY MADE YOU SOB? Oh, because it was so joyful and painful at the same time. It happened and so my body was saying, ‘Yes, Leo, pay attention. Yes, Leo, it happened!’ (laughs) So, I could no longer play the psychology game of, ‘Well, it could be a daydream. It could be a reality. It could be a memory. It could be a fantasy. No, it’s a reality.’ Everyone Needs to Publicly Share UFO Experiences TODAY IN SEPTEMBER 2008, IF THE MOTHER AND THE SON FROM THE CIMARRON CASE WERE SITTING IN FRONT OF YOU, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM TODAY ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE AND THE HUMAN ABDUCTION SYNDROME? Same thing I said many years ago. ‘I hope you will consider releasing this information publicly.’ She was frightened and angry and did not want to do that. Paul Bennewitz was angry and he didn’t want to do that. But I would say the same thing. And why do I say release the information publicly? Because that is the metamorphosis. That is the transition from the caterpillar to the butterfly. When a person tells other people about the experience, it is a release from the closure from the dogmatism, from the fear, from the anger and says, ‘This happened to me.’ It’s just like a rape victim or someone who lost a buddy in the battlefield. At first, people don’t want to talk about it because they feel guilty, dirty, ashamed or whatever phrase they use. But when they talk about it, they tell themselves, ‘I survived it. It happened. I was there. I am beyond blaming myself or blaming God or my parents or the government for the UFO cover-up. I’m responsible for the UFO cover-up just like everyone else.’ So, blaming other people doesn’t really help. The best thing we can do is to talk about out UFO experiences and as we talk about our experiences and talk to other people about their experiences, then after awhile, the UFO cover-up won’t matter because everybody will know.”"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" A fter the first hypnosis session in mid-May 1980, Dr. Leo Sprinkle talked with the mother and made the following notes from her comments: “The E.T.s mean to control earth, but maybe they don’t treat everyone like Mother was treated. Mother has had a dream of ‘mind control’ over earth. ...She puzzles about the whole situation.” I remain puzzled, too, about the specific non-human agendas. Some people in the human abduction syndrome say the animal mutilations are in two categories: nourishment and a genetic harvest. If a genetic harvest, why?
