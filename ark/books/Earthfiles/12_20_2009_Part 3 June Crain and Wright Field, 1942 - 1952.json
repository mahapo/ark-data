Clarkson, 58, now retired from the Aberdeen, Washington, Police Department, currently investigator for Washington State agencies in the field of administrative law and Chief Investigator for Washington State MUFON, continues with excerpts from his June 27, 1997, recorded interview with June Crain Kaba at her Ocean Shores, Washington, home before her death on August 23, 1998. December 1, 2009 Letter from James Clarkson about June Crain's assertion that she had both a SECRET clearance (see Part 1 ) and a TOP SECRET Q clearance under authority of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC): “The investigation of the June Crain story is a work in progress. There are aspects of what she disclosed versus the documents I have obtained thus far that have raised the question of exactly what security clearances she possessed. The documents she supplied and the documents obtained from the Personnel Records Center verify June Crain held at least a Secret clearance. While describing her duties at WPAFB, she stated she had a Q clearance. This claim is not yet verified. However, June knew about Project Caucasian (below in this Part 3) many years before the project was declassified and the public learned it was a code name for the development of a parachute and harness system for a hydrogen bomb weighing 50,000 pounds six feet in diameter and 20 feet long. The goal was to delay the bomb’s fall long enough for the delivery aircraft to escape the blast zone. Given the realities of the Cold War, this project would be highly classified. The Q clearance could be issued for many reasons and most probably, the requirements have changed over time. My father had a Q clearance when he worked at the second uranium fuel plant in the US located in Paducah, Kentucky, as a control room operator. My grandfather had fun acting mysterious when his neighbors in a small Kentucky town asked him why the FBI had been to visit asking questions about my father. The point is his description: he said the original Q clearance was a cardboard on which a large letter Q was printed that had to be worn at all times while performing work in a classified area. It should be pointed out that one of June’s Job Description documents dated February 2, 1951, includes the following: ‘Under general supervision of the Branch Stenographer sets up and maintains files...memorandum reports, accident reports, and other reports pertaining to cargo parachutes... Searches files for information requested by project engineers.” Her assignment was HQ Air Materiel Command, Area B, Engineering Division Equipment Laboratory, Parachute Branch Cargo Unit. Presumably, this would by necessity have involved highly classified information. Another major point needs to be made: I have not claimed every single statement made by June Crain about her work history at WPAFB, made in 1997, some 45-50 years of life experience later, is absolutely correct. However, given the available documents in combination with her statements, there is enough available information to rightfully claim she knew what the insiders talked about – the reality of repeated UFO sightings during the testing of the Aerobee rockets in the deserts of New Mexico, the security methods employed to ferret out details of these sightings while at the same time discouraging further reports and discussion, the reality of recovered crashed UFOs, and finally, the existence of the memory metal described by someone as ‘a piece of a spaceship.’ "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Obviously, it would have been ideal if I had been able to repeatedly interview June and hopefully get the exact names of the personnel involved. It did not happen because I met June while I was working full-time as a Detective Sergeant for the Aberdeen, Washington, Police Department. I thought there would be more time, but sadly, there wasn’t. However, even if June’s details were not 100 percent correct, or if they cannot be fully verified, her testimony offers a fascinating view of what the secret-keepers do not want us to know.” By James E. Clarkson, December 1, 2009 Assistant State Director Wa shingt on St a t e Mutual UFO Network PO Box 12328 Olympia, WA 98508 (360) 701-1342 olymufon@comcast.net Interview: James E. Clarkson, former Detective Sergeant in Aberdeen, Washington, Police Department; investigator for Washington State Agencies and Chief Investigator, MUFON-Washington State, Olympia, Washington: “June told me some anecdotes about working at Wright Field (later to become Wright-Patterson AFB) not directly related to UFOs. And she described to me that she had what she called a ‘Top Security’ clearance. She specified more definitely that she had a Q clearance and that she ended up working for the Air Materiel Command (AMC). Then to put it into perspective, June Crain was working on things that we would take for granted now, but at the time were classified research such as high-altitude balloons, the airplane ejection seat and the gun site aperture camera. She also assisted in research for the Aerobee Rocket, which I think was one of our first successful rockets developed from the German V-2. It was known as a ‘heavy lifter.’ O n June 26, 1948, two rockets, a V-2 and an Aerobee, were launched from White Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico. The V-2 attained 60.3 miles, while the Aerobee attained 70 miles altitude. Photo of Aerobee Hi Missile, White Sands Missile Range Museum. [ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “ The Aerobee rocket was a small (8 meters), unguided, suborbital sounding rocket used in U. S. high atmospheric and cosmic radiation research between 1947 and 1958. It was built by Aerojet General, a company that began Aerobee research in 1946 and test fired the first complete Aerobee from the White Sands Proving Grounds, New Mexico, on November 24, 1947. That Aerobee reached an altitude of 34.7 miles (56 km). The rocket was two stage with a solid-fuel boost and a nitric acid/aniline sustainer. The Aerobee could take a 68 kg payload to an altitude of 130 km. The Aerobee rockets could reach around 230 km (a later variant exceeded 400 km), instrumentation usually provided constant telemetry and was recovered by parachute. Launch towers were built at White Sands Missile Range, Fort Churchill, Wallops Island, Va., and aboard the research ship, USS Norton Sound. The last Aerobee flight was in 1958, after some 165 (including variants) had been successfully fired.]"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"June went on at great length telling me that as part of her duties, she was actually present when experiments were done dropping heavy payloads by parachutes, including some misadventures where things fell where they weren’t supposed to fall at Wright Field, Ohio. Project Caucasian: Classified Parachute Research by German Physicist Theodore W. Knacke June kept telling me that because she worked in this place where they were experimenting with parachutes that there was a man named Mr. Knacke. The way June described him is that he wrote the Bible for parachutes. He was another one, as June put it, ‘stolen out of Germany after WWII.’ Well, the interesting thing is that I eventually learned that there was a man named Theodore Knacke, T. W. Knacke, who was a very highly respected scientist and engineer basically described as the parachute engineer’s engineer. His work is the basis for the recovery parachutes for space capsules any heavy payloads that have to come out of the atmosphere and be slowed down with a parachute device. SO HE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY INVOLVED WITH PROJECT MOGUL? June did not give me that, but that’s another possibility. U . S. Air Force 1947 - 1949 Project Mogul balloon tests photograph from TopFoto.co.uk. [ Editor's Note: Project Mogul (Operation Mogul) was a TOP SECRET project by the U.S. Army Air Forces involving high altitude balloons, whose primary purpose was long-distance detection of sound waves generated by Soviet atomic bomb tests. The project was carried out from 1947 until early 1949. The project was moderately successful, but was very expensive and was superseded by a network of seismic detectors and air sampling for fallout which were cheaper, more reliable, and easier to deploy and operate.] IF PROJECT MOGUL WAS ONE OF OUR MOST CLASSIFIED EXPERIMENTAL SPY OPERATIONS IN 1947 ONWARD – THE WORLD DIDN’T KNOW ABOUT PROJECT MOGUL BACK THEN, BUT WE WERE USING THESE HIGH ALTITUDE BALLOONS TO SPY ON OUR PERCEIVED ENEMIES. Exactly. Speaking of highly classified – June made reference to Project Caucasian. That was a really mysterious one because at the time, no matter whom I talked to, nobody knew anything about Project Caucasian. It wasn’t on the internet. It wasn’t in any books. Nobody knew what it was. [ Editor’s Note : Project Caucasian - See PDF U.S. Cold War at: http://www.uscoldwar.com/hindenburg/Hindenbg_5_6.pdf PDF Excerpt: When a tentative 50,000 lb., six-foot diameter, 20-foot long hydrogen bomb size was established in 1951, LASL advocated that the Air Force conduct drop tests using a drogue parachute to slow the falling bomb and allow the delivery aircraft more time to escape the blast. An immediate requirement was the development of a large parachute to support 50,000 lbs. dropped at release speeds in excess of 300 knots (345"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"MPH) at altitudes between 35,000 and 45,000 feet. The Air Force program that assisted this effort was known as Project Caucasian. Caucasian had seven subtasks, including the modification of four B-36H aircraft as prototype bomb carriers; the modification and redesign of the B-2 bomb lift to carry a 50,000 lb. load; development of a series of drogue parachutes to decelerate and stabilize the falling bomb; and development of practice drop shapes. 8 1952: The First Full-Scale Test and Weapon Design Begins The design of the first full-scale test device embodying the “three concepts” proceeded rapidly during 1951 and 1952, and by the fall of 1952, was ready for testing at Eniwetok atoll in the Marshall Islands. The test device, named the Sausage for its long cylindrical shape, was 80 inches in diameter and just over 20 feet long; it weighed 82 tons. Most of this weight was contained in a massive foot-thick outer steel casing which enclosed the device’s primary (a TX-5 unboosted fission bomb), and a complex cryogenic liquid-fueled secondary with a tritium gasboosted plutonium “sparkplug.” At the time of its detonation, the Sausage was the largest and most complex cryogenic device in the world. An irony of its design was that in order to attain the highest temperature ever achieved on earth, the deuterium in the device had to be chilled to near absolute zero, the lowest temperature on earth. The test of the device during the Operation IVY Mike shot on November 1, 1952 was su ccessful. Even before the test, design of the first solid-fueled hydrogen bombs -- the Alarm Clock, Zombie, Runt, and Shrimp -- had begun at LASL. These devices later became prototype weapons named TX-14, TX-15, TX-17, and TX-21, respectively. As work proceeded on this second generation of hydrogen weapons, the Department of Defense (DOD) began studying likely delivery systems. The ConVAir B-36 Peacemaker, the largest bomber then in the U.S. Air Force inventory, was the most obvious delivery vehicle for the Hbomb: On June 30, 1948, a B-36 had dropped 72,000 lbs. of conventional bombs during a test flight. The B-36B could carry 86,000 lbs., including conventional high explosive bombs weighing up to 43,000 lbs. and measuring 364 inches long and 54 inches in diameter, the size of the American variants of a World War II British Grand Slam bomb. Availability of the first stockpile hydrogen weapon, the TX-14 Alarm Clock, was assured by the end of 1953. This bomb was equipped with a 64-foot diameter drogue parachute. The Air Force instituted Project Caucasian, using two B-36Hs, to make aircraft and bombing equipment modifications to carry the TX-14 in the B-36. The Air Force’s Strategic Air Command (SAC) authorized a “1A” priority for this program. 9 At a conference at Wright Field in July 1952, attended by representatives of the Air Force, ConVAir, Sandia Laboratories, and LASL, an agreement was reached to “freeze” maximum bomb diameter to 62.5 inches and to limit its weight to 25 tons. This monster was to be ... 8 The Development of Thermonuclear Weapon Delivery Techniques: Project CAUCASIAN , pp. 2, 5, 6, 11. 9 A History of the Air Force Atomic Energy Program, 1943 - 1953 , Lee Bowen and Robert D. Little, et. al., 1959, Vol. IV, The Development of Weapons, p. 209. Well, it turns out that not until 2007 was Project Caucasian declassified. Now I can read about it and see how it was absolutely in keeping with the work that June did at Wright- Patterson. So, not declassified before 2007, but June told me ten years earlier in 1997 about Project Caucasian , a research project at Wright-Patterson for Los Alamos"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"laboratories in New Mexico on how to slow down the descent of an H-bomb dropped from the belly of a B-36 bomber. At the time, that was the backbone of our strategic strike force. So, they needed to develop a parachute that could slow down a payload that was that heavy and that large. So, when June said that Project Caucasian was so sensitive that every time it got mentioned, her boss would kind of flinch, she was 100% correct. THE CHALLENGE WOULD HAVE BEEN TO SLOW DOWN A LARGE HYDROGEN BOMB BECAUSE THE CREW AND AIRPLANE WOULD HAVE TO GET AWAY BEFORE THE BOMB EXPLODED. Exactly! In fact, it was a 6,000-pound payload, 6 feet in diameter, 20 feet long, and the idea was to drop it at a release speed of 345 mph from 35,000 to 45,000 feet altitude. So there is quite a lot of technology that would go into slowing the bomb down. THE GERMAN PHYSICIST, THEODORE KNACKE, WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ONE PERSON WRIGHT FIELD DEPENDED UPON TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. Ye s . AND JUNE KNEW ABOUT HIM AND HIS WORK. SHE KNEW ABOUT PROJECT CAUCASIAN, WHICH YOU HAVE JUST SAID WAS NEVER RELEASED UNTIL AROUND 2007. THAT MEANS THAT IN THOSE TWO CATEGORIES OF YOUR INTERVIEW, JUNE WAS CORRECT. TIME PROVED THAT. SO, IF SHE WAS CORRECT ABOUT THOSE FACTS, THAT IMPLIES SHE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT ROSWELL, WHITE SANDS AND WRIGHT FIELD. Ye s , it d o e s . DO YOU THINK WE ARE EVER GOING TO GET AN HONEST GOVERNMENT PRESS CONFERENCE TO LET US KNOW WE ARE NOT ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE AND THAT THE HISTORY OF ROSWELL AND OTHER CRASH SITES AND LANDINGS ARE BY INTELLIGENCES THAT ARE NOT HUMAN? I guess I’m optimistic and pessimistic at the same time, which is hedging, but I sort of believe that every time we are told another lie or there is more censorship that in some ways that creates the seeds of its own destruction. USAF Lied About Crash-Test Dummies In the case of June Crain, had it not been for the propaganda coverage by CNN telling us that Roswell 1947 had to be Project Mogul and that we dropped a few wooden dummies in the desert that someone misperceived as aliens (non-humans) – if the USAF and CNN hadn’t laid it on so thick with such a lie, I’m not sure that June would have come forward. So, the authorities’ efforts to make us all think there was nothing to Roswell, nothing to any of this, completely backfired because as a result of their efforts at censorship, you and I are having this conversation about June Crain at Wright Field in 1942 to 1952. WE NOW KNOW THERE WERE NO WOODEN DUMMIES DROPPED IN THE ROSWELL VICINITY ANYWHERE UNTIL 1955. Yes, and I know that firsthand because I talked to Raymond Madsen this last year in preparation for the presentation in Las Vegas. He was a Lt. Col. when he retired. As a young officer, he was in charge of that research project of dropping dummies from high altitudes. There were two types of dummies: one type was an inarticulated dummy; the other was an articulated dummy. In other words, one had flexible joints and one did not. The USAF's goal was to do experiments on how best a flier could survive coming down from a great altitude. Raymond Madsen felt his original research was not quoted properly and he especially felt that after it was included in the USAF Roswell: Case Closed. He never intended for his work to be used that way. He resented being misquoted and how his work was used as misinformation in the USAF's Roswell: Case Closed. THE ARROGANCE OF AUTHORITIES WHO WOULD EVEN TRY TO USE 1955 WOODEN DUMMIES TO COVER-UP 1947 ROSWELL UFO CRASH EVENTS, KNOWING THE DUMMIES WERE NOT USED UNTIL 1955. Exactly! I guess none of us are supposed to be able to look at history. [ Editor's Note: Majestic Documents.com writes about the USAF 1955 crash-test dummy experiments:"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The Air Force, General Accounting Office, Mogul Balloons and Crash-Test Dummies As evidence that the controversy surrounding the so-called Roswell Incident refuses to roll over and die, in the 1990s the Air Force published two investigative reports pertaining to the events of July 1947. The following is taken from the Air Force’s press release on the first report published in 1994 in response to an inquiry launched by the General Accounting Office — the investigative arm of Congress. The GAO’s inquiry came as a direct result of questions initiated by the late New Mexican Representative, Steven Schiff. According to the Air Force’s massive, near-1000 page report (The Roswell Report: Fact vs. Fiction in the New Mexico Desert, 1994) the debris found at Roswell was most likely from a Mogul balloon — a Top Secret Army-Air-Force device designed to assist the U.S. military in detecting evidence of nuclear tests by the Soviets. But what of the reports of alien bodies? In 1997, the Air Force expanded on this aspect of the Roswell affair in a document titled The Roswell Report: Case Closed: This report discusses the results of this exhaustive research and identifies the likely sources of the claims of \"alien bodies\" at Roswell. Contrary to allegations, many of the accounts appear to be descriptions of unclassified and widely publicized Air Force scientific achievements. Other descriptions of \"bodies\" appear to be actual incidents in which Air Force members were killed or injured in the line of duty. The conclusions are: Air Force activities which occurred over a period of many years have been consolidated and are now represented to have occurred in two or three days in July 1947.\"Aliens\" observed in the New Mexico desert were actually anthropomorphic test dummies that were carried aloft by U.S. Air Force high altitude balloons for scientific research. The \"unusual\" military activities in the New Mexico desert were high altitude research balloon launch and recovery operations. Reports of military units that always seemed to arrive shortly after the crash of a flying saucer to retrieve the saucer and \"crew,\" were actually accurate descriptions of Air Force personnel engaged in anthropomorphic dummy recovery operations. Claims of \"alien bodies\" at the Roswell Army Air Field hospital were most likely a combination of two separate incidents: 1) a 1956 KC-97 aircraft accident in which 11 Air Force members lost their lives; and, 2) a 1959 manned balloon mishap in which two Air Force pilots were injured. This report is based on thoroughly documented research supported by official records, technical reports, film footage, photographs, and interviews with individuals who were involved in these events. Despite the Air Force’s attempts to diffuse the controversy surrounding the Roswell events of 1947 and preempt the GAO’s findings, it is significant to note several key factors. First, Mogul balloons possessed no unusual characteristics such as those described by the witnesses to the event. Second, the crash-test dummy experiments that the Air Force asserts led to the legends of alien bodies being recovered were not initiated until the 1950s. Third, during the course of its investigation, the GAO learned that all of the administrative records of Roswell Army Air Field from March 1945 until December 1949 and all outgoing messages from the base from October 1946 to December 1949 had been inexplicably destroyed. June Crain and Dr. Wernher von Braun June told me something that was absolutely fascinating. She was adamant that she had personally taken dictation from Dr. Wernher von Braun and that he had the coldest eyes she had ever seen."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"G erman physicist, Wernher von Braun, in his new NASA headquarters office, 1970. On March 1, 1970, von Braun relocated to Washington, D. C. to be Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning at NASA Headquarters until May 26, 1972, when he and NASA parted ways after the end of the Apollo program and many conflicts about the direction U. S. space flight projects should go. Image by NASA. June said she took dictation in a Wright Field office from Dr. Wernher von Braun under a very high security setting, apparently at night. An officer came to her and she recalled that he was wearing a sidearm, took her to a still-more secure area at Wright Field and said that she needed to take dictation. June said she was asked to take the dictation because she was very efficient. She took a great deal of pride in her ability to take down what she called ‘highly technical words.’ Then there is this part of the story that is a big insight into June Crain and how she felt about her life’s work. There were at least two or three times that she told me about this dictation event and every time she described it, she started crying. And she said that this officer told her in reference to her work that night that if they got the $600,000 that they were supposed to get as a budgetary allotment as a result of this (von Braun) report and others, she would have had ‘her moment in history,’ is the way she recalled this because this was going to be seed money for the United States space program. She was very proud of her work at Wright Field, Ohio, and this was part of her dilemma as to why she didn’t talk about it for so many years and why she wanted to keep it a secret. The other part of her dilemma was that she as a woman had to make a decision between her professional career and following her husband when he got out of the U. S. Air Force. She chose to go with her husband and to raise her son and ended up in Portland, Oregon. But she told me that Wright Field wanted her to stay in the employment and had she stayed, she believed she would have ended up working for NASA. DO YOU KNOW THE DATE OF THE DICTATION WITH WERNHER VON BRAUN? No, I don’t. June gave me one of Wernher von Braun’s biographies and pointed out to me"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"that she had been over that book at length and could not find any reference to Dr. von Braun ever being at Wright Field. I tried to run down the same thing with other sources and I had no luck either. But I do wonder if this interview/dictation might have been a special assignment when Dr. von Braun was brought to Wright Field for some specific reason? Or maybe it was early on in his time in the United States? WERNHER VON BRAUN WAS BROUGHT TO THE UNITED STATES IN PROJECT PAPER CLIP AFTER WORLD WAR II. JUNE CRAIN WAS WORKING AT WRIGHT FIELD BETWEEN 1942 AND 1952, CORRECT? Ye s . [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - Operation Paperclip was the code name for the 1945 Office of Strategic Services, Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency recruitment of German scientists from Nazi Germany to the U.S. after VE Day to develop a rocket program for the United States at White Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico.] THEN IT’S LOGICAL THAT IF WERNHER VON BRAUN WAS INVOLVED WITH OUR GOVERNMENT IN TRYING TO GET A SPACE PROGRAM GOING TO COMPLEMENT ALL THE WHITE SANDS V-2 ROCKET AND AEROBEE EXPERIMENTATION. THE TIME LINE WOULD HAVE BEEN FROM 1945 ONWARD AND THE LAST SEVEN YEARS OF HER BEING AT WRIGHT FIELD FROM 1945 TO 1952. IT’S LOGICAL THAT SOMEONE LIKE WERNHER VON BRAUN WOULD HAVE VISITED WRIGHT FIELD, EVENTUALLY TO BE CALLED WRIGHT- PATTERSON, TO TALK WITH MILITARY PEOPLE THERE. Yes, it would have been probable. But perhaps it was classified. Perhaps he was not comfortable talking about that part of his life here. Or perhaps this was not what he considered to be a key event in his career. PROBABLY MORE LIKELY THAT IT WAS SO HIGHLY CLASSIFIED AND LINKED TO A LARGE SUM OF MONEY TO GET A SPACE PROJECT GOING THAT THE DICTATION SESSION WAS TO BE CLASSIFIED AND OFF THE RECORD ALWAYS. Ye s . DID JUNE CRAIN TALK ANY MORE DETAILS ABOUT WERNHER VON BRAUN? The other thing she mentioned in this interview was that she was shown no consideration because she had to do the dictation standing up. She made a big point of that when she was talking to me about it that they didn’t let her sit down. She thought that this man was very rude and inconsiderate. WHY DID SHE HAVE TO STAND UP? Because there was no place to sit. I presume that he got to sit down at his desk and she didn’t. I sort of felt overall that his was probably part of another larger issue in how women in the work force were considered and treated at that time. RIGHT, SO SHE STOOD UP TAKING DICTATION FROM WERNHER VON BRAUN ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS INPUT TO NAILING A $600,000 BUDGETARY ITEM FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE AMERICAN SPACE PROGRAM. Correct. When Will Truth Prevail? WHERE DO YOU THINK ALL OF THIS IS GOING TO END UP IN TERMS OF THE TRUTH ULTIMATELY TRUMPING ALL THE LIES? Well, one thing that could happen is that someone might actually come forward with some of this ‘memory metal’ that could establish a provenance where we could say, ‘This is extraordinary metal and it originally came from a crash site.’ There could also be some overwhelming event that occurs that gets everybody’s attention. That’s the White House lawn scenario. Or, someone could make enough mistakes over time that we’re able to put it all together. In other words, the authorities might make the wrong person angry and provoke them to come forward and give us testimony that is even more damning than what we’ve already gotten from many of the key witnesses."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"IF YOU WERE GUESSING, WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN TO FINALLY LEVERAGE THE TRUTH FROM THE GOVERNMENTS? Unfortunately, I’m thinking that it might take an overwhelmingly blatant incident. The reason I say that is that we now have so many of the governments in other countries coming forward and supposedly opening at least part of their UFO files.” R eturn to Part 1 More Information: See James Clarkson's entire interview with June Crain Caba at: Majestic-12 Documents, http://www.majesticdocuments.com F or further information about UFO crashes, Roswell, Wright Field and Wright-Patterson AFB, please see Earthfiles Archive (partial list below): • 09/07/2008 — Part 3: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases • 08/27/2008 — Part 1: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases • 08/12/2008 — Part 2: Rise of Fourth Reich -Where Is the Nazi “Die Glocke?” • 08/09/2008 — Part 5: Original Carbon of Scorched Memo, Project JEHOVAH and Physicists Oppenheimer and Einstein • 08/06/2008 — Updated - Part 3: Original Carbon of Scorched Memo Links Government UFO Cover-Up and JFK Assassination • 08/06/2008 — Part 4: Original Carbon of Scorched Memo Links Government UFO Cover-Up and JFK Assassination • 07/28/2006 — 1940s USAF Flight Surgeon's Account of E.
