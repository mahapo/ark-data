Here begins Part 7 of Status Report II, written in January 1980. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report III begins at Earthfiles. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. For all the previous status reports, see Earthfiles Archives. Leonard H. Stringfield: \" PART II: NEW SUPPORT DATA I, or any of my research contemporaries, might never live to see the day when all the facts are bared to either verify or completely quash the story of UFO crashes, retrievals, and of the little nondescript bipeds that are kept under official wraps in cryogenic catacombs. The whole truth is beyond my meager range of inquiry. The data I present here are hardly sufficient to change the hard crust of our scientific community. And, if everything I know is true, then perhaps it is also true that other information unknown to me would 'blow the mind,' as the former C.I.A. employee once commented on tape. If, then, the real facts are so unsettling, is it socially wise to hide the truth until the day may come when disaster strikes or a docile segment of our humanity is converted to fear or worship a fetish that does not even exist? In the meantime, until the official facts can be bared of what I have revealed can be believed, then UFOlogy must continue to live with the UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome until its frustrations can be relieved by seeing a humanoid like King Tut on exhibition. But my story is not yet finished. It is not all dominated by anonymous firsthand informants whose reports of a UFO crash/retrieval might be diagnosed as syndrome of a sick mind. There are others of a growing legion of credible people who have provided valuable data. Consider the following: ITEM B-1 (REVISED) Kecksburg, Pennsylvania - December 9, 1965 "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"K ecksburg, Pennsyl vani a, i s about 35 mil es southeast of Pi ttsbur gh, Pennsyl vani a. Clark McClelland, formerly Director of NICAP, Florida Unit-3, during the period he worked at the Kennedy Space Center as a member of the Apollo program, informed me on October 5, 1979, of an alleged UFO crash/retrieval incident occurring near Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, December 9, 1965. McClelland has since correlated old and newly acquired data, relative to the incident, which is contained in the following report for this paper: Clark McClelland, January 17, 1980: 'Just before sunset on the evening of December 9, 1965, a fiery object causing a brilliant glow was observed by thousands of frightened and mystified residents of Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York and Ontario, Canada. A loud aerial explosion occurred causing several shock waves that were experienced by private and commercial aircraft pilots flying over Michigan and Lake St. Clair, east of Detroit. During the explosion, pilots and people on the ground observed something detach from the glowing form and fall to earth near Lapeer, Michigan. Other parts of the object eventually came to earth near Elyria, Ohio; Midland, Pennsylvania; and finally the remainder fell into a rural wooded area near Kecksburg in southwestern Pennsylvania. W itnesses claim to have seen a metallic acorn-shaped object with strange markings in the Kecksburg, Pennsylvania woods on December 9, 1965. Drawing by Charles Hanna © 1998 by Stan Gordon Productions. Retracing the flight of this unidentified flying object reveals some startling facts. One can trace the object's path in a straight line from its initial observation above Lapeer, Michigan, and as it continued over Lake St. Clair, to Elyria, Ohio, in a southeasterly trajectory. As the UFO flew over Elyria, it made an apparent course change of twenty-five degrees which appeared to be a controlled adjustment. This would obviously kill the usual explanation that it was a meteor or a bolide. This conclusion was later advanced by Dr. Paul Annear, Professor of Astronomy at Baldwin-Wallace University, and immediately drew agreement from some Pentagon sources, even though the witnessed fall of physical material from the object to the ground over several cities verified the actual flight path. Calculations show that the UFO was most probably between 40 and 60 miles altitude when first observed over Michigan. Assuming the object was 60 miles high, it could have easily been observed from Indiana to Ontario, Canada. Amassing all the distances where witnesses claimed to have observed the glowing mass, we find that it was puttering along at about 17 miles a minute or 1,062.5 miles an hour. This is considerably slower than the astronomically recorded minimum speed of 27,000 mph or the maximum, 144,000 mph that meteors have been measured to be traveling during their plunges to earth. So"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"the college professor and the Pentagon called this mysterious object a meteor or bolide. Hah! Ask yourself - who is kidding whom? Another possibility exists to explain the mystery object. An inquiry was recently made through the records maintained by the United States Air Force Space Defense Center which is the headquarters of the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) in Colorado. On January 11, 1980, Mr. Del Kinchey, the Base Public Information Officer, assisted in searching the satellite and space debris re-entry archives for recorded tracking data on the date of the Kecksburg impact. He discovered that on November 23, 1965, the Soviet Union launched one of their spy satellite series designated Cosmos 96. What is interesting about this is that it either aborted or was recalled to re-enter into the earth's atmosphere sixteen days later on the day of the Kecksburg incident, December 9, 1965. Further inquiry concerning the re-entry data where the Air Force expected the device to impact will be forthcoming in a future edition of this publication. Even if this does prove to be an explanation for the Kecksburg object, it is common knowledge by those experienced in aerospace science and rocket development that no spacecraft or nose cone in 1965 had the capability of a 25-degree adjustment in flight direction during earth re-entry. Within an hour following the impact of the object at Kecksburg, a large contingent of military specialists arrived at the scene almost as swiftly as the Pennsylvania State Police and local volunteer fire groups. They quickly cordoned off the area and ordered all on-lookers to leave. One armed forces spokesman was reported to have said, 'We don't know what we have, but there is an unidentified flying object in the woods.' On January 11, 1980, James Mayes, former Assistant Fire Chief, and Melvin Reese, former fireman for the Kecksburg Volunteer Fire unit at the time of the impact were interviewed. They had both accompanied an unidentified Pennsylvania State Policeman to within 75 yards of the wooded hollow where the crash occurred. Both men report seeing an object flashing. They could not determine the exact shape of the object. Both men agree that there was no fire associated with the impact. James Mayes also recalls that the military unit did set up a command post at the Kecksburg Volunteer Fire Hall. He said that information concerning the affair was relayed to an Air Force Base west of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, possibly Wright-Patterson in Dayton, Ohio. Mr. Mayes was not positive, so this disclosure is uncertain. Mr. Mayes also said he had heard that a large military truck was cleared to enter the restricted area and that hours later the truck reappeared with a large object under a tarpaulin. Other residents of the area recall hearing of the truck hauling something during the night. The truck rumor was unsubstantiated until Robert Bitner, the Fire Chief in 1965, offered the following information. Mr. Bitner was working at the time of the fall and arrived later than other volunteers who were assisting the State Police and military unit. Later, during the night, Bitner was present near the impact site when a large 10 ton military truck appeared coming from the wooded area. It had a tarpaulin spread over a large object that appeared to be 6 feet high, 7 feet wide and 17 feet long. Mr. Bitner was approximately 25 feet from the truck and the military had personnel standing guard around the entire vehicle. Eventually the truck, under escort, left for an undisclosed destination. Was that place Wright-Patterson AFB or someplace else? No one knows. The Kecksburg incident was not caused by a meteor or anything astronomical. Of this we can be sure. Perhaps further study of re-entry data will determine an association with the Cosmos-96 that returned to Earth on December 9, 1965. This remains to be proven. Was it a craft alien to earth? Information gained so far may eventually favor this theory. What is certain is that something important was apparently retrieved by the military and as yet, the object and its origin remain a mystery. * Clark McClelland, January 17, 1980.' * Stringfield Footnote: On November 16, 1979, I was interviewed on the John Signa Show, Radio Station KDKA, Pittsburgh. Other guests were Clark McClelland, Betty H ill and Travis Walton. During the 3-hour session, the Kecksburg retrieval incident was aired. To our surprise, we received four calls from people who allegedly were at the site following the crash. Some claim they saw the flatbed truck under tarp leave the area. Another later saw the hole caused by impact. Three witnessed the military security"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"team who sealed off the area. One, who got too close, was ordered to leave. Although one military spokesman said the retrieved object was as 'meteorite,' McClelland emphasized that he was aware of the UFO's flight pattern prior to the crash which ruled out that explanation. [ Editor's Note: Also see · 10/25/2003 Earthfiles Part 1 - What Does NASA Know About 1965 Aerial Vehicle Crash in Kecksburg, Pennsylvania? ] ITEM B-2 Modesto, California - September 10, 1979 Randall Clement serves as Dispatcher in a Communications Center for a law enforcement agency in Northern California. He told me on September 11, 1979, that a possible UFO crash or landing had occurred on the previous evening at approximately 7 p.m. in the general area of Modesto, California. He was on duty at the time when two officers of his unit observed a green, luminous object flying at low-level over Shasta County, descending gradually in a southerly course. While linked by phone with the National Alert Warning System, Clement heard that the UFO was confirmed by radar at Vandenberg AFB and that jets were scrambled from an air base. The UFO was described by observers as wobbling in its flight like a pendulum. This he referred to as the 'falling leaf syndrome,' a behavior that is speculated to be associated with a malfunctioning UFO. From other sources, too, I have learned that the wobbling effect, possibly indicating a troubled UFO, is also discernible by certain effects appearing on radar. ITEM B-3 Colorado Springs, Colorado - Early 1970s? Randall Clement first contacted me by letter in January 1978, to relate a meeting with a friend several years ago who had served in the Air Force as a technician. That work brought him to the underground facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. There, for reasons unexplained, he claims to have seen a dismembered and charred body of an alien humanoid. Efforts are being made to elicit more details. ITEM B-4 Ohio/Michigan Border - Spring 1975 Bette Shilling, working on a college UFO project, first heard of my 'Retrieval' paper when I was interviewed on a Los Angeles radio station in Fall 1978. She wrote to me and I responded by phone when I learned that her friend, an Air force officer, had told her that he knew of a crashed alien craft occurring in the Spring of 1975. At that time, she said, he was Communications Officer at a 'station' in Detroit, and was responsible for transmission of a coded message to the Commanding Officer at another base in Ohio (Wright-Patterson?) about a crash in a rural area near the Ohio border in Michigan. Two dead bodies, and one still alive, were retrieved. Name withheld by request. ITEM B-5 Naval Air Station, Sunnyvale, California - 1952 William D. Leet of Texarkana, Arkansas, was long-time respected researcher, former Major, Air Force pilot in WWII and Korea, and co-author of To R u l e T h e Sky. He knew of my UFO crash/retrieval research and reached me by letter in December 1978, to relate that he had a lead from Mr. Lynn Ward, which concerned a relative who had seen a captured flying saucer in a Navy hangar in 1950. The witness was Durward 'Buddy' Haak, CPO Radar Observer, while stationed at a Naval Air Station in Sunnyvale, California. In 1952, Buddy Haak was on an ill-fated flight out of San Diego. His aircraft disappeared; no trace of it was ever found. Buddy Haak, according to testimony received from members of his family, had accidentally entered a door of a large hangar that was temporarily unguarded. He saw a huge, round, saucer-shaped craft with a row of windows. A guard shut the door in his face and ordered him to forget what he had seen, or else. By June 1979, through the efforts of Bill Leet, I had received written statements from two members of the family who recalled the story and managed to get the phone number of"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Durward Haak's mother. On June 25, 1979, I called Mrs. Haak, who requested that her full name and address be withheld. She recalled her son's concern about seeing the flying saucer. 'It was certainly no aircraft of ours,' she remembers him saying. Although other members of the family connect Buddy's strange disappearance with his knowledge of the UFO, Mrs. Haak did not. ITEM B-6 Dayton, Ohio, Wright-Patterson AFB - 1953 Richard Hall, Editor of the MUFON UFO Journal wrote in a letter dated March 23, 1979: '...Don Berliner (aviation writer) just returned from visiting an aviation historian friend in Illinois named Truman Weaver. While there, Weaver showed him a copy of a letter dated March 1978, from a good friend of Weaver's in the aviation business ... who worked as a technician at Wright-Patterson, retiring in 1954. This gentleman said that he worked 'across the alley' from where they kept the bodies. He said that in 1953, they had 13 of them in a room on the third floor. A strong odor used to waft across the way. Upon inquiring, they were told it was embalming fluid. The bodies, he said, are now stored at a small Air Force Base (Langley) at Hampton Roads, Virginia...' On April 3, 1979, I called Truman Weaver, a former Air Force Major, who himself had a UFO experience while flying in Korea in 1952. He and crew saw a daylight disc that was 12 feet in diameter under intelligent control off his wingtip. Without hesitation, Weaver gave me the phone number of his friend, Robert Thompson, whom he knew through mutual aviation interests. On the same day, I phoned Thompson. He confirmed the data Berliner had related to Hall about his work at Wright-Patterson. He added, 'Suddenly, the building nearby became very busy, trucks drove up and right into the building. This was before air conditioning was installed and with windows open, I could smell the strong odor of formaldehyde. It was sickening.' Thompson said he never saw a flying saucer or a little body personally, but he did claim to see what he called an 'interim report.' His boss named McAdams showed it to him and fellow workers, which he said confirmed the rumors that alien craft and bodies were on the base. The next day, he said the paper was snatched from McAdams and officials denied it even existed. Thompson could not remember if the report was on official stationary or marked SECRET or if it was mimeographed. Curious, I called Weaver about such a document. He was not aware of such a report for general circulation unless it was a document that leaked out without authorization. On April 5, Thompson sent me a note which stated briefly: 'The building number was 18F, 3rd floor. The 13 bodies and 2 saucers are at a small air base at Hampton Roads, Virginia, if they have not been moved again. Thompson said he heard about the transfer to Hampton Roads from a source now in Canada and unreachable. ITEM B-7 Del Rio, Texas - 1950 On June 25, 1978, James Minton, his wife and I, breakfasted together in a motel in Carlyle, Illinois, on the day Betty Hill, Charles Hickson, and I each addressed the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis, hosted by Mrs. Rosetta Holmes, at the Fish Hatchery grounds. Jim and I, over several coffees, discussed our respective interests in the UFO and have since that day 'kept in touch' as I continued to develop new material about the UFO crash/retrieval syndrome. In September 1979, Jim called to relate that he had talked with a former Air Force friend named William Draeger of Austin, Texas, who had uncovered some information about a 1950 craft incident occurring in Mexico. I knew the incident well. It had been disputed by some researchers. However, I had not pursued the case beyond having referred to the alleged crash in my previous paper ( Status Report I to be reprinted in upcoming Earthfiles.) At that time, I had used information related by Todd Zechel to the Midnight Globe. Since then, further research into the case by Zechel and others has revealed that not only the year of the incident was wrong - it was changed from 1948 to 1950 - but also the crash site changed. Whatever the status of the case, I was eager to learn anything new. So, Minton made"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"arrangements for me to call Draeger the same day. One call led to another as Draeger had hoped to gather information from still another backup source. Like his friend Minton, he was willing and able to probe and was resourceful. Being also honest, Draeger said he was unable to get his other source to talk, but agreed to submit a statement for this paper relative to his investigation in Mexico (names withheld). His letter, dated October 11, 1979, follows: October 11, 1979, Statement by William Draeger of Austin Texas: 'Todd Zechel called me in Austin, Texas, on Sunday, August 13, 1979. He was acting as consultant to a Japanese television crew from Nippon Television Network taping a UFO documentary. They were in Del Rio, Texas, researching the alleged UFO crash which occurred in 1950 (and has at times been erroneously reported as having occurred near Laredo, Texas). On Monday, August 14, I was employed as interpreter for the Japanese crew due to the fact that I was raised in Del Rio and speak Spanish fluently. The retired Colonel, who witnessed the UFO in the air and later on the ground, was also in Del Rio with Todd and reported that the soldiers surrounding the crashed craft were Mexican troops. I contacted the Mexican Army General who had command of that specific area of the border and initially talked with him by telephone. I identified myself and my position and related that in 1950 a UFO was reported to have crashed 30 miles northwest of Del Rio. We had along a pilot who had seen it in the air and later on the ground being guarded by Mexican troops until American Air Force units arrived to retrieve the craft and a body that was found aboard. Without pause, the General answered in Spanish: 'Yes, I know about that. I don't have any papers or documents to prove it, but due to my position, I know about that.' When I asked if he would consent to an interview, he paused and said he would be busy for 30 minutes, but afterwards would be free for an interview at his home. when the 7-man crew, the retired colonel and myself arrived and we talked with him, he totally denied any knowledge of the incident and on camera he denied and evaded any questions dealing with the incident and UFOs. The General is a military celebrity and began his career as a young Lieutenant serving under Pancho villa during the Mexican Revolution. He was acquainted with several movie stars, like John Wayne, and became friends with General George Patton when he was stationed at Fort Clark, 35 miles from the border. They played polo together. I believe the General is beyond reproach and that he 'slipped' on the telephone, but maintained strict security for the interview. I, William H. Draeger, do hereby swear to God that the above statement is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. (signed) William H. Draeger' \" T o be continued in Part 8 - U. S.
