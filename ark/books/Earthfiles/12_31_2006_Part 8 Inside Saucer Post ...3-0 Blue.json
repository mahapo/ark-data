Stringfield. THE INCREDIBLE THINGS Here, like potluck, are hundreds of reports which describe \"incredible things\" falling, landing or being propelled to earth. Included are all the sundry fireball phenomena which, to put it bluntly, are either meteorites or ranging missiles and an assortment of nondescripts, like the metallic object investigated by the Navy in the marshes of Ossabow Island; or the fragments of the \"harmless-looking green object\" which exploded when it was kicked by Guy Scott near Ft. Jackson, South Carolina, causing serious injury and which, according to doctors, caused the injured parts to give off sparks. Perhaps the oddest of the incredible things is the incident reported by Air Force veteran W. B. Brown of Charlotte, North Carolina, on March 20, 1957. Brown, accompanied by his wife, described five \"strange floating, foam-like objects\" in the sky, one which veered away from the others and hit the ground about 60 feet away. Brown said it looked like \"ice-breaking up,\" but that it was liquid - \"slimy\" to the touch and \"cooling or numbing\" to his fingertips. The smell was like burned matches. Brown, who told his story to the Weather Bureau, commented: \"It beats anything I've ever seen.\" In many respects, the Charlotte incident reminds me of another incident that occurred on September 30, 1950, near Philadelphia. In brief, the tory tells of a glowing purple sphere, about six feet in diameter, which settled on a field so lightly that it did not even bend the grass. Touched by one of the policemen who saw it fall, it began to deteriorate. The officer said, \"I touched it and it just dissolved, leaving my fingers sticky.\" The object had no odor or substance and completely disappeared within half an hour. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Following is a supplementary list of \"incredible\" incidents, in which are described \"space- to-earth\" objects, and/or their effects. The list is not a comprehensive one for the period specified. Excluded are the Fortean falls of fish, lizards and ice, like the 50-pound chunk which nearly hit a farmer in Bernsville, Pennsylvania, July 30, 1957, and a still larger chunk of 150 pounds which plunged from the sky, striking the roof of a house in Chester, Pennsylvania, September 8, 1957. That caused residents to flee in terror. While I do not dismiss such \"incredibilities\" as being ufological, astronomer M. K. Jessup has more ably pursued this phase and applied it to theory in his series of saucer books. I cannot vouch for the authenticity of any one of the cases below. However, as the saying goes, where there is smoke, there is fire - as has been described in many cases. No less numerous or sensational in this category are the foreign reports. One datelined Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, September 20, 1956, told of mysterious balls of fire soaring over a desolate area in the state of Paraiba, terrifying the populace into flight. Said geologist Joel Dantas, returning from an inspection, \"the whole region is highly radioactive. It is bathed in unnatural heat, and the air seems filled with the steam of alcohol.\" Dantas also reported that the earth there is covered with crystallized ash that cannot be explained. 1952 Disc Crash in Spitsbergen, Norway"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"S pitsbergen, Svalbard Island, Norway, near Arctic. Another \"landing\" report of world-wide significance, but apparently smothered, was recounted from the September 5, 1955, issue of Stuttgarter Tageblatt by the Dutch publication UFO-GIDS as follows: \"OSLO, NORWAY, September 4, 1955 - Only now a board of inquiry of the Norwegian General Staff is preparing a publication of the report on the examination of the remains of a U. F. O. crashed near Spitzbergen, presumably early in 1952. Chairman of the Board, Colonel Gernod Darnbyl, during an instruction lesson for Air Force Officers, stated: 'The crashing of the Spitzbergen disc was highly important. Although our present scientific knowledge does not yet enable us to solve all riddles, I am confident that these remains from Spitzbergen will prove to be of utmost importance in this respect. Some time ago, a misunderstanding was caused by saying that the disc probably was of Soviet origin. It has - this we wish to state emphatically - not been built in any country on earth. \"The materials used in its construction are completely unknown to all experts having participated in the investigation. According to Colonel Darnbyl, the board of inquiry is, however, not going to publish an extensive report until 'some sensational facts have been discussed with U. S. and British experts. We should reveal what we found out, as misplaced secrecy might well lead to panic.' \"Contrary to information from American and other sources, Second Lieutenants Brobs and Tyllensen, who have been assigned as special observers of the Arctic regions since the event at Spitzbergen, claim that flying discs have already landed in the polar regions several times. Said Lt. Tyllensen: 'I think that the Arctic is serving as a kind of air base for the UFO unknowns, especially during snow storms when we are being forced back to our bases. Shortly after such adverse weather conditions, I have seen them land and take off on three separate occasions. I noticed then that after having landed, they execute a speedy rotation around their discs. A brilliant glow of light, the intensity of which is variable with regard to speed and at landing and take-off, prevents any view of the things happening behind this curtain of light and on, or inside, the disc itself.'\" Pear-Shaped Craft, Red Spray and Microwaves? Back home, and as incredible as any of the freak fireballs and just as disturbing, was the grotesquerie involving a man, a peach tree, a red spray and a pear-shaped UFO with a fin. The incident occurred over Sycamore Hill, a high point near the heart of Cincinnati, July 22, 1955. The principal was Edward Mootz, a benign and non-publicity-minded man who spent much of his spare time beautifying his fabulous garden which was terraced into the hillside. One evening about 6 p.m., Mootz, alone, was tending the soil around a fruit-budding peach tree. Suddenly, from out of nowhere, Mootz was splashed by a liquid red spray, that looked like cream soda. His arms bared, but perspiring, were covered with the substance; also the nape of his neck. A billed cap prevented it hitting his f ace. Looking up, he spotted a strange object passing over heading toward Eden Park. Guessing its height to be more than 500 feet, Mootz described the object a a pear standing on end, bulbous side upward, with a metallic fin appended to the rear. The object's colors were vivid: red and green, divided at the midsection. No sound was heard."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"For comparison, the August 1957 issue of APRG REPORTER reported a sighting of July 9, 1957, in Galveston, Texas in which Mrs. A. D. Suderman and her neighbor watched an object through binoculars.\"It was high in the sky, way above the sunset. I could have drawn a line between the red top and green bottom ... As it turned and moved southwest, the green disappeared and it was all red, like a large goldfish.\" While watching the object, Mootz said that he became aware of a sharp tingling sensation on the exposed parts of his arm and neck. \"It felt like phosphorus burning into my skin and the pain was intensifying,\" Mootz said. Wasting no time, he ran to his house, removed his clothing and washed thoroughly. Mootz told me later that what saved him, in his opinion, was his heavy perspiration, which helped dilute the spray. The next morning, Mootz revisited the ill-fated spot. To his amazement, the peach tree was dead! The branches and twigs were shriveled grotesquely; the leaves curled and crisp brown; and the once-healthy buds of peaches looked like prunes. A little digging showed that the tree was killed to its very taproots - overnight! I learned of the incident a couple of weeks later and made an appointment with Mootz for an interview. It was a Sunday afternoon when Dell and I drove over. We found Mootz middle-aged, friendly and chatty. Carefully, he recounted the details of the incident, gave me samples of the mummified peaches and twigs, showed me the many white pinprick scars on his arm \"where the substance burned in,\" and finally explained that the authorities, three men, had already visited him, right after the incident and had taken away the tree and all its dead fruit. Mootz would not identify the authorities, except to say they were dressed in plain clothes and were courteous. Said Mootz: \"They promised a report of their analysis within six weeks,\" but when I checked a year later, the report had not yet arrived. In every respect Mootz was cooperative. I took 8mm movies of the vacant area where the tree had stood and of Mootz standing near it. Later I had him draw for my files impressionistic sketches of the UFO he had seen. Indeed, on paper it was strikingly different from the usual discoid UFO shape. I lost no time in getting the \"pruned\" peaches, the twigs and other chunks of root I dug up pinto the hands of a friend of mine who offered to take them to the Physics Laboratory at Villa Madonna College in Covington, Kentucky. There, elaborate tests were made, one which involved a comparison of seeds from the Mootz specimen and another provided by the lab, which had been allowed to dry out sufficiently. Under controlled conditions, only the lab seed sprouted normally. The Mootz specimen proved to be completely dehydrated! [ Editor's Note: Implication is exposure of Mootz and peach tree to heating, drying microwave radiation.] Pock-Marked Cars Spring 1954 introduced a new phenomenon, the glass pox. Starting in Bellingham, Washington, where 1500 windshields of automobiles suffered damage, it then spread east, effecting mostly northern cities. In most cases, the glass showed quick symptoms, one type appearing as a single pit mark, but usually in multiples, as though pelted by bee bee shot. Occasionally, in these instances, the glass fractured radially from pane to pane. In the other type, the glass assumed a honeycombed appearance; in many instances the glass was completely collapsed. Everything under the sun, including the sun, was blamed. Experts were baffled; saucerites knowingly pointed skyward. Cincinnati, always a saucer hotbed, got in the act. Many local reports reached me in 1954, including the chance to see some of the evidence. But it was not until August 29, 1955, that I thought I had a case where the poxed windshield and the saucer revealed a plausible cause-and-effect relationship. The clues of this suspected tie-in began at 3:15 p.m. when a metallic disc reflecting sunlight was reported hovering over the Ohio River. It then shot away at the approach of an airliner, which was heading toward the Greater Cincinnati Airport. In the evening, shortly before midnight, another report reached me by phone, describing a bright blue object shaped like a pear, circling over Eastern Cincinnati. I went outside wearing only shorts, looked all around with binoculars, but saw nothing. No sooner than I had retired, the phone rang again. A new voice described a pink object turning red, which had just zipped over Indian Hill. Pretty close to home, I thought. This time, dressed only in binoculars, I slipped out the side door but was again too late. Next day, my brother Jack phoned. His voice vibrated with excitement as he described what had befallen his neighbor's new 1955 Ford parked in front of his house overnight."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The car's rear window was completely shattered. \"It's in a million pieces and each piece is shaped like a cube.\" Nobody could explain it, but the neighbor was plenty mad. That evening, still slightly embarrassed for having rummaged through the neighbor's ash cans, Jack brought me a shoe box full of samples. They ranged in size from half-inch cubes to larger favriform-fractured sections. I later learned from Lex Mebane of Crime Scene Investigations in New York that the favriform type of poxing, as typified in this one case, was actually no mystery at all. Mebane sums up his research into this phase as follows: \"Windows that crumble suddenly into a multitude of curve-sided, rectangular fragments are made of 'tempered' glass, which has this characteristic manner of fracture. It has been used in cars only in recent years - I don't know just when it was introduced, but it was not long before 1955. Its merit is that it s unusually strong and that when it does crack, it does not crack into the vicious triangular fragments of ordinary glass. It turns into a sort of 'sand' which is unlikely to cut anyone. This is a safety feature, introduced because cuts from broken glass are one of the most dangerous hazards of automobile accidents. With tempered glass, this hazard is eliminated. \"I am not sure whether tempered glass is used in windshields. I think laminated glass (a plastic sandwich, likewise for safety) is still used there. I am not sure why. But tempered glass is now common in rear windows. It is made by sudden chilling of hot glass. This produces a case hardening: the pi ece is strong, but unstable, containing locked-in tensions. When it is overstressed, it goes all to pieces in an instant. The principle is that of Prince Rupert's Drops, which are obtained by dropping molten glass into water. These are tear-drop shaped, with long, curved, tapering tails. The glass is strained, and if the tail is snapped, the drop 'explodes' into a sandy powder, disappearing before one's eyes. This phenomena is what is seen also in the sudden crumbling of rear windows. \"The question is: What has overstrained the windows and caused them to disintegrate? I have been told by people more familiar with cars than I am that even standing in the hot sun can do this. The first curved wrap-around windows are also apt to be overstrained in fastening them to the frame and might 'let go,' seemingly without cause, at almost any time. I think probably there was also some deficiency in the manufacture, at least at first. The crumbling of tempered-glass windows is not really an unusual phenomenon and it just is not the same thing as the 'glass-pox' epidemic of sudden appearance of pits on windshields. The newspapers just picked it up and confused the two events.\" Science, however, is still scratching its head over the pitting mystery. This is revealed by Irving Petite in a feature article appearing in the Seattle Sunday Times, April 14, 1957. Writes Petite: 'After three years, this mystery appears still unsolved.' He points out that scientists, considering all plausible theories, have agreed that the H-Bomb does not cause pocking of glass; that hydrofluoric acid etches glass smoothly; that special resins can cause chips in glass, but only under carefully controlled conditions. Suggested answers: Small black spheres from H-Bomb, meteors, or an unknown source. Petite goes on to relate that Hanford Thayer, a consultant on the wartime Manhattan Project, is still making a study of the pocked windshield phenomenon. Thayer carefully searched every square foot of the concrete street in front of his home in Seattle on April 15, 1954, during a glass-poxing incident. He found several black, pea-sized particles. One, a spheroid, is a glassy opaque substance and non-radioactive. The hard imperfect ball is believed to be the only specimen available for analysis. According to Thayer, the windshield pocking mystery is not closed!\" EVIDENCE IN THE FLESH - THE 'GNOMEN' [ Editor's Note: Gnomes/Gnomen - \"Distantly related to dwarves, gnomes are smaller - averaging three to three and a half feet and weighing about 70 pounds. Gnomes have deep tan or brown skin and white hair. The most distinguishing feature are their noses, in which they take great pride. For some reason, all gnomes have very large noses - compared to the rest of their facial features. The average life span for a gnome is 350 years. Gnomes tend to live in hilly meadows and rocky woodlands. Their small size makes them wary of larger races, though gnomes are not hostile unless the larger folks are evil. Gnomes are much less dour than their dwarf relatives, with sly and lively senses of humor. Many people - mostly gnomes - say that gnomes have"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"elevated practical jokes to an art form. Gnomes also love living things and finely wrought items of all types. But most especially they love gems and jewelry and are considered by many to be the best gem cutters and jewelers there are. Rock gnomes are the most common gnomes, and they can be encountered in a variety of climates and environments. Their eye color is predominately blue, although brown or green are seen occasionally. Their hair is usually white or pale gray. Rock gnomes are typically neutral good, but the whole gnomen society is open to any align. Of all the mortal races, the gnomes are the most adept at mathematical and spatial manipulations, and they are thought to be the most naturally intelligent of the humanoid r aces. Even gnomes raised among other cultures are natural tinkerers, and have been known to drive entire villages wild with their toys.\" Source: © 2003 by Dawn of the Ages. ] The continuing search for evidence has left no stone unturned, for the very stone that is turned might be the extraterrestrial missing link. Possibly the Air Force thought of this when they dispatched investigators by helicopter from Maxwell AFB, in Alabama, to Sylacauga in 1954 to examine the \"meteorite,\" which fell through the roof of Mrs. Hewlit Hodges, causing her injury. Incidentally, when I wrote to Mrs. Hodges about the meteorite, her lawyers answered that it was for sale - the price, $5,000. While civilian researchers cannot afford helicopters - or do not have funds to buy a celebrated meteorite - a few, not bothered with bulletin deadlines, have aircraft and will travel! I have had a couple of standing offers: Jim McAshan III's of Knoxville, Tennessee, and Jack Grant's of Columbus, Ohio. They have offered to fly anywhere the not news breaks. But I'm afraid that domesticity and all its implications have been my chief deterrent. Besides, my own \"backyard\" - the greater Cincinnati area - has provided enough follow-up material to keep me busy for years. Knowing this was Ted Bloecher of CSI, N. Y. His first visit to CRIFO was a brief weekend in August 1955, in the midst of a UFO flap. Not only saucers were rampant, but so were reports of \"little green men.\" So much was happening, in fact, that we had little more time than to get acquainted. During the year, however, with the big flap gone, except for its wake of data waiting for correlation, Ted and I took time to kick around the \"little green men\" by mail. To me, the subject was challenging. Kelly-Hopkinsville, Kentucky, \"Little Men\" The first \"little men\" incident to alarm the nation took place on August 21, 1955, in Kelly, near Hopkinsville, Kentucky. The story covered by the news wires told of a band of little ogres that descended on a farmhouse, causing its occupants some frightful moments. D epiction of one of several non-human entities seen by family in Kelly-Hopkinsville, Kentucky, beginning around 7 p.m. local time on August 21, 1955. Sketch courtesy Donn Davison. [ Editor's Note: According to The UFO Encyclopedia © 1980 by Margaret Sachs, \"at about 7:00 p.m. on August 21, 1955, teenager Billy Ray Sutton"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"went outside the family farmhouse to get a drink from the well. When he returned, he announced that he had seen a large, bright object land about a city block away. ...almost an hour later, a barking dog alerted the family to the approach of a glowing creature, less than 4-feet-tall with long arms raised over its round head. When it was about twenty feet from them, two of the men fired at it. The little man somersaulted and hurried away into the darkness. \"When a second creature appeared at the window, a shot was fired at Mir right through the screen. The entity seemed to have been hit and disappeared. As one of the men led the way through the door to see if the creature was dead, a claw-like hand reached down at him from the roof. Another entity was seen on a tree branch. The men fired at both creatures. The bullets seemed to ricochet off them as if they were covered in nickel-plated armor. The creature in the tree floated to the ground, then scuttled away. \"Soon the eight adults and three children had locked themselves inside the hose. From time to time, the entities appeared at the windows. They were impervious to the bullets. However,, their glowing, round, yellow eyes seemed sensitive to the house lights and the Suttons concluded that this was what prevented the creatures from coming toward the doors. \"The incident was investigated by the U. S. Air Force, local authorities, journalists and civilian UFO investigators. It was classified as unidentified by Project Blue Book.\"] While the nation tittered over this, the little creatures dropped into Cincinnati. Like a plague, they began infesting the communities of Winton Woods, Cumminsville, Camp Washington, Mt. Airy and Greenhills. Then at the height of the furore, the police nabbed Albert Snapp, a 15-year-old boy who was wearing long, green-dyed underwear. He admitted having fun in Cumminsville scaring his neighbors. The youth, however, denied leaving his neighborhood during his masquerade. Snapp thus became the \"whipping boy\" for all the hooliganism and provided the press its cue to laugh off all the reports. One incident, however, occurred in Greenhills and left several question marks. Alien Creatures On Stockton, Georgia, Road July 3, 1955 Another incident related during the press's fanfare was that befalling Mrs. Wesley Symmonds of Cincinnati. While driving through Stockton, Georgia, to Florida on July 3, 1955, she encountered four bug-eyed creatures standing in the road. This case I do not dismiss. Having talked with Mrs. Symmonds and having heard her testimony on tape made during an interrogation by Calvin Prem, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney for Hamilton County, I felt that she was relating the truth. At least in my opinion, it was an attempt to relate an experience she could not explain."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"\"F rightful creatures\" as described by Mrs. Wesley Symmonds during interview with Len Stringfield in which she recounted her experience, which she \"hopes to forget,\" while motoring through Stockton, Georgia, on July 3, 1955.

The most striking cases, however, were those I collected preceding the news of the Kelly \"landing.\" Some reached me second and third hand. While sensational, the cases could not be easily checked at their sources. The attempts I made to contact the principals involved were unsuccessful because the people were inaccessible. Other cases equally sensational I"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"learned about on a tip from Herb Clark, my friend in GOC. These all occurred before the Kelly case and were centered in the vicinity of Loveland, northeast of Cincinnati. Most baffling was an affair allegedly occurring under a bridge, which involved Civil Defense officials. All attempts to elicit additional information brought the proverbial Sphinx silence. In August of 1956, Ted Bloecher returned to Cincinnati. This time, staying a week, he came armed with new data on the Kelly case. When I reviewed the data, I could understand Ted's enthusiasm to investigate the Cincinnati cases. It was indeed an eye-opener and a magnificent job of intelligence work on the part of Miss Isabel Davis of CSI, who visited Kelly for first-hand information. Drafting a plan of action, Ted and I began with the Greenhills case. First, we arranged interviews at the home of one of its key witnesses. She was one of two girls who had been with boy friends \"parking\" and panicked on the sight of a little luminous creature. Operating separately, Ted and I took turns interviewing and while doing so, sketched the alleged creature, careful to capture every feature she could reconstruct and describe from memory. When we finished, to our surprise the drawings looked much the same as the little biped which was sketched for the Cincinnati Post following the Symmonds story of the year before. Instantly, Ted and I knew something was wrong, for the Post 's \"little man\" was nothing more than a cartoon. According to Mrs. Symmonds, the Post drawing was quite unlike the creatures she saw in Stockton. We asked about the two boys and learned that one had been killed during the year while serving in the Air Force. The other, the driver of the car, was in the Navy. Luckily, he was home on leave and we reached him by phone. Hesitant, fearing publicity, he finally admitted having seen a \"luminous body\" standing near a fireplug. Unable to explain it, he said it \"glowed,\" but it \"wasn't green like the newspaper said.\" Next in our plans was a check into the Loveland cases. Of these, the \"affair under the bridge,\" as I called it, was the most intriguing to Ted. In Orbit , I had written about it as \"a case involving a prominent business man ... who saw four little men about 3-feet-tall under a certain bridge.\" This person had \"reported the bizarre affair to the police\" and that \"an armed guard was placed there.\" I told Ted that most of my attempts to glean additional details were foiled; that the local Civil Defense unit, which I heard had been engaged at the bridge, would not talk; that the Loveland Police Chief John Fritz, who \"knew about the case,\" had \"brushed off\" one inquisitor and that my feelers elsewhere fell flat. However, I did learn from a member of the school board of that community that the incident had been investigated by the F. B. I. But not to be discouraged, early one morning, Ted hopped a cab to Loveland. His first stop in the police station found Fritz cordial and chatty, but \"somewhat fidgety\" when asked about the armed guard at the bridge. Ted, however, had no trouble in extracting the home address of C. F., one of the principals in the case. Later that afternoon, Ted visited C. F. But as I had expected, C. F. refused to review the case beyond the details that had already slipped out. But the day was not wasted. Ted's richest plumb came quite unexpectedly. In what seemed to Ted a stratagem to circumvent the bridge affair, Fritz introduced a new lead into another \"little men\" case. It was a hot humid Saturday evening when Ted, Dell and I met Mr. R. H., by appointment, at the 31 Bar in the city. My first glimpse at R. H. was reassuring. For obvious reasons, in such abstract investigations, one always beforehand conjures up the worst type of individual. But here was a man in a responsible position, well-dressed, well-mannered. His voice was soft, undramatic, and his eyes steady, never shifting. Sipping a martini, we heard R. H.'s amazing story from which the highpoints follow: \"About 4 a.m. on a march night in 1955, while driving through Branch Hill on his way to Loveland, R. H. saw in the beams of his headlights what appeared to be three men kneeling at the right side of the road. His first impression was that \"somebody was hurt or some crazy guys were having fun.\" Curious, he stopped his car and got out for a better look. To his surprise, he discovered that the figures were non-human and about 3-feet-tall. They were not green , R. H. stressed, but rather a 'greyish color,' including the garments. These tight- fitting, stretched over a 'lop-sided chest' which bulged at the shoulder to the arm pit. Over this bulbousness hung a slender arm, noticeably longer than its opposite member. Save for only a fleeting impression of 'something baggy,' the legs and feet were obscured by weeds and brush. 'Their heads were ugly,' said R. H., reminding him of a 'frog's face' mostly because of the mouth, which spanned in a thin line across a smooth, grey face. While R. H. thought the eyes 'without brows' seemed normal and the 'nose was indistinct,' the pate of"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"the head 'had a painted-on-like-hair effect, like a plastic doll.' He added, 'It was corrugated, or like rolls of fat running horizontally over a bald head.' \"According to R. H., the middle biped was first seen with its arms upraised. 'They were raised a foot or so above the head,' he said, 'and holding a dark chain or stick, which emitted blue-white sparks jumping from one hand to the other.' As R. H. approached, he said this biped then lowered its arms with the chain 'as if to tie it around its ankles.' R. H. said he wanted to get closer, but by the time he had reached the front fender of his car, the 'little men' made a slight 'unnatural' move toward him, 'as if motioning me not to come any closer.' For about three minutes, R. H. said he stood still, just watching - too amazed to be afraid. Next thing he remembered, he was on his way to Fritz's office.\" (Implying missing time?) \"I mpressionistic\" sketch of gnomen seen by \"R. H.\" on the road near Loveland, Ohio, March 1955. Note frog-like mouths, rolls of fat on brow and lop-sided chests. Sketch © 1955 by Leonard Stringfield. Fritz, by his own admission, investigated. Armed with gun and camera, he drove to the indicated area, made four or five passes, but saw nothing. An interesting and possible correlative sidelight of this case, however, is the fact that members of the Loveland GOC Post, according to its supervisor, reported seeing a UFO in the general area sometime during the R. H. encounter. Later attempts to obtain the date of the sighting, which would also date R. H.'s story, were unsuccessful. Three characteristics stand out in the R. H. revelations: 1) Gregariousness of three bipeds. 2) One with arms upraised . 3) Their greyish color. In review of all the astounding evidence culminating from the testimony of other incidents, it is noted that the Branch Hill case shares similar characteristics with each and/or all. Gregariousness, or a banding together of the bipeds, is characteristic of both the North and South American cases. In the United States, Kelly reported \"approximately 15,\" while the Stockton and the Loveland bridge affair each reported four. In Venezuela, Valencia reported six; Carora four; Petare three; Amacuro Delta two. Only Zulia reported one."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"F ront page of Venezuelan newspaper sent to Stringfield by Horacio Gonzales of Caracas, which headlines \"hairy biped\" incident in Petare in November 1954. Police investigating the scene where Gustavo Gonzales (upper right) said he struggled with creatures depicted in lower right drawing. The arms upraised anomaly is noted also in the Kelly and Stockton cases. Significantly, Stockton also evidenced one of the bipeds holding a metallic rod (compare R. H.'s \"chair or stick\") with which it seemed to be digging in the road. But perhaps most significant and contrary to newspaper talk was that in no one incident were the bipeds described as green. In all, they were described variously as brown, tan or gray. While there were also minor variances in the description of the \"skin\" as being hairy or rough, and the \"hands\" being claw-like or rake-like, the widest divergence of reported features were those describing the head and face. In some, the eyes were luminous and lemurian or \"as large as saucers.\" In others, they were bird-like, small or normal. In some, the noses were long and pointed; in others, mere orifices. One striking anomaly in comparing two cases from Kelly and Branch Hill was the similarity of certain facial features, while in others they were the very opposite. In both cases, the bipeds evidenced wide, frog-like mouths. But while Kelly evinced extra- proportionate elfin ears - like in fairytale drawings - the Branch Hill featured no ears at all! Perhaps for the sake of argument, the best analogy on earth is the Order of Primates, consisting of man, apes, monkeys, marmosets and lemurs. Of Man, the negroids behold both the tallest and smallest of Homo sapiens . Among his cousins are the gorilla and the tarsier. All related, but different! There are other incidents which involve little bipeds - or shall we call them gnomen ? Of this group is an Indianapolis incident which allegedly involved a high school principal who, with companion teachers, were terrorized by four gnomen near a river campsite in 1954. Ted finally tracked down the principal, who denied the story. Another Loveland incident was related to Ted and me and the supervisor of the Loveland GOC after it was brought to my attention by Herb Clark. When the supervisor visited my home in regards to UFO reporting, he told of a gnoman frightening a woman in her yard. More information was promised, but liaison was never established. Still another incident occurred in Kentucky, which involved several gnomen seen from an automobile on a dark roadside. According to my reluctant intermediary who earlier promised all the details, one of the bipeds touched the car's fender, leaving marks or scratches on the paint. A dozen attempts to reach the principals in the case were futile.
