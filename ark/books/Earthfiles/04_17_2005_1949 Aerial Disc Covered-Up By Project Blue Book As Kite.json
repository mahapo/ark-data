Navy Research Physicist Bruce Maccabee, Ph.D., is author of a book published in 2000 entitled The UFO/FBI Connection, The Secret History of the Government's Cover-Up . He told me, \"We're learning more about what happened years ago then they knew years ago. My book could not have been written twenty years ago or ten years ago because it involves information that has only been recently released.\" Bruce Maccabee received his Bachelors of Science degree in Physics from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1964. Three years later in 1967, he added a Masters of Science degree in Physics from American University (AU) in Washington, D. C. Then he earned his Ph.D. in Physics from AU in 1970. He worked as a post-graduate student in AU's Physics Department until he was hired by the U. S. Department of Navy to be a physics researcher at what was then called the Naval Ordnance Laboratory (NOL). That name was later changed to the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) where Dr. Maccabee has worked ever since. Currently, Dr. Maccabee is involved in a program to develop sensors for Homeland Security. He has been curious about the reports of silent discs, or other-shaped, aerial craft most of his life. His hobby of analyzing UFO photographs has been applied in investigations for the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), the Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR), and other organizations. I asked Dr. Maccabee about some of the best photos or drawings from the 1900s which he thinks are are not Earth technology. One from 1949 was covered-up in the now infamous white-wash known as Project Blue Book [see More Information below] and the subsequent Condon Report - two deliberately misleading and government-financed operations to convince the public and media there was nothing to UFOs, while simultaneously the government tried to shoot them down and back-engineer the non-terrestrial technology. The case below that Dr. Maccabee describes was seen by two aeronautical engineers and other eyewitnesses. Yet Project Blue Book and the Condon Report indexed it as a \"radar kite\" and an \"aircraft.\" Bruce S. Maccabee, Ph.D., Research Physicist, U. S. Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Virginia, speaking at a conference. Photo provided by Bruce Maccabee. Interview: Bruce S. Maccabee, Ph.D., Research Physicist, U. S. Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Dahlgren, Virginia: \"This is one of my favorites. No photos involved, only drawings. But it's a favorite because of the high quality eyewitnesses and the way I dug it out. No one would even know the case existed probably if it weren't for the fact that it appeared in the Battelle Memorial Institute's Special Report 14. [ Editor's Note: Battelle Memorial Institute of Science and Technology in operation since 1930.] "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The Battelle Memorial Institute Report was the result of a Project Blue Book contract in 1952 to have Battelle develop a better method for analyzing UFO sightings. If you read Ruppelt, you'll find that when he took over Project Blue Book in 1951, he tried to be more scientific about it than the previous people had been. By late 1951, they had almost 1,000 sighting reports. So Ruppelt and others people above him in the Foreign Technology division of the Air Material Command (AMC) decided to try to use computer-aided technology to analyze sighting reports. This was really a stretch because there was like only one computer in the United States or only two or three at that time! That was back in the days when a computer was the size of a house. They were in Dayton, Ohio, and not far away was Columbus, Ohio, where the Battelle Memorial Institute was and Battelle was where this computer was. So, the USAF's Project Blue Book contracted with Battelle to come up with a sighting report form that could lend itself to data processing and asking specific questions that were somehow quantitative and could be on the old-fashioned IBM computer punchcards. Each punchcard would have 80 fields, which was 80 opportunities to give some characterization of a UFO sighting. For example: date, time, location, sighting direction, shape, color, brightness, speed all the sort of things you might want to characterize a particular sighting. They couldn't put a narrative on, unfortunately. So, the Battelle people started their work in the spring of 1952 and it was while they started this process that the huge 1952 flap occurred (over Washington, D. C. and all over the U. S.). They worked through the flap and into 1953. According to Ruppelt, they were essentially finished by half way through the fall of 1953. But they did not release the report. Ruppelt retired and he wrote his book that came out in the summer of 1955. [ Editor's Note: The Report On Unidentified Flying Objects © 1956 by Edward J. Ruppelt, Former Head of the U.S. Air Force Project Blue Book.] Back flap: \"Here is the first serious, unbiased account of the United States Air Force investigation of these mysterious objects in the sky, written by the man who was head of Project Blue Book\" (from 1951 to 1953), © 1956 by Edward J. Ruppelt. It was about the same time that Ruppelt's book was published I mean, within days that the USAF announced suddenly that they had published their Special Report 14. In the Executive Summary of Special Report 14, you'll find they make some handwaving comment about how there were unexplained sightings, but the number of unexplained sightings had gone down dramatically as a result of better reporting. So, if you read just that Executive Summary, you would sort of be turned off on the whole subject. Of course, the Executive Summary is what they gave out as a press release and they had only published 100 copies, I think it was, for official use only. Special Report 14 was not released to the press. Canadian physicist, Stanton Friedman, has pointed out a fact from the government's studies that the probability of being unexplained increased with the reliability of the sighting. That is not what you would expect if unexplained sightings are a result of mistakes by either the witness or the analyst. This Battelle Special Report 14 was made available to Edward Condon, Ph.D., and he never even mentioned it in the Condon study! [ Editor's Note: U. S. Air Force paid $500,000 to University of Colorado for UFO study to be conducted by physicist, Edward Condon, Ph.D. Completed in 1968, Condon basically dismissed the phenomenon as not real, even though buried in the thick report were hundreds of unexplained sightings. Physicist Stanton Friedman reported in his book, Crash At Corona , that the prestigious American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics even stated: \"The opposite conclusion (from Condon's) could have been drawn from its (Condon Report) content, namely that a phenomenon with such a high rate of unexplained cases (about 30%) should arouse"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"sufficient scientific curiosity to continue its study.\" ] The Battelle analysts tried was to come up with the fundamental model for a saucer. So, they started with about 4,000 sightings, threw away about 800 cases as being too nebulous for analysis, which left them with 3,201 reports of which many were multiple witness sightings. So in Battelle's 3,201 reports, there would be several reports (from different people) for a particular sighting. Refined more, Battelle estimated 2,199 objects were reported in the 3,201 sightings. So you got almost 1.5 reports per object on average. Then from all those reports, they had about 200 they could not explain. Of the ones they could not explain, they picked twelve best. When I say they could not explain it, they had options for giving explanations for any particular report: astronomical, airplane, balloon, dust particles in the air, including hoax and delusions. They had a whole series of possible identifications. In order to become classified as 'identified,' all they had to do was have a couple of people agree that there was a reasonable and specific identification. If there was not enough information to be absolutely sure, they classified it as uncertain, or insufficient information if there was not enough information to prove that it was either a UFO or a plane or something else. In order to become unidentified , everybody who worked on the report and this was usually three to seven people who had a chop on each report. Everybody had to agree that it could not be explained. So it was hard to become unexplained. Unfortunately, we don't have the records anymore that would allow us to see how they arrived at these conclusions that these were the twelve best. They were the best in the sense that they were sufficiently explicit that they could lead us to create a model saucer! And what you are looking at in the Rogue River, Oregon, drawings is Case 10 of those 12. Well, guess what? The cases differed some what. I'd say about half of them were typically the circular shape. The others were different other shapes. So ultimately, they argued that we can't make a single model saucer. Therefore, there probably was not one. (laughs) Because you've got twelve unknowns, but they are not all the same, I guess none of them are unknowns. These were after working on 200 unexplained cases and coming up with the twelve best and you had to have everybody agreeing these could not be explained. 1949 Rogue River UFO One of Battelle Institute's Best Twelve Unexplained Cases This Case 10 we would not know about because it was buried in the Project Bluebook microfilm, split into parts and buried in archives. We would not know about it if it weren't for the fact that it was chosen as Case 10 in the Battelle Special Report 14. It occurred on May 24, 1949, at the Rogue River not far from the ocean in Oregon. I was looking for this particular case in the Project Blue Book file in 1976 when it was first released. You could go to the National Archive and crank through these 90 some microfilm records and find whatever you can find. That's a lot of pages at least 100,000 pages of stuff that was put on microfilm! But Project Blue Book Indexed Case as \"Kite\" and \"Aircraft\" I had set for myself a goal of cross-referencing all twelve Battelle cases in the Project Blue Book records. And Case 10, Special Report 14, gives the date of May 24, 1949. It says it occurred near a river and gives a time and talks about an employee of a supersonic laboratory of an aeronautical laboratory and some other employees of the lab by a river. That was all the information I had to go on. Then I was flipping through all the microfilm records and started reading something that sounded familiar. If you looked at the Project Blue Book microfilm record, right in the beginning, they have an index of all the sightings that were stored : all 13,000 Blue Book sighting reports. On the 24th of May, 1949, they give two sightings: one which they crossed off the names of the witnesses and identified it as a 'kite' or 'kites.' And the other sighting on the same day was a lady witness who compared the object to an airplane, and so Project Blue Book called it an 'aircraft.' Project Blue Book Took Out Rogue River File's Documentation Before Microfilmed"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"So, just by looking at the Project Blue Book index, you would not be attracted to those particular sightings. And when you go to the one described as 'kites' and look in the appropriate location in the microfilm file, there is a notation that says 'cards missing.' That means that all the documentation on that particular sighting had been taken out of the file before it was microfilmed. I was just looking through the microfilm record of the archives which includes everything that was in the official Project Blue Book file of Dayton, Ohio. But they also combined with the Blue Book file, the files of the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI). The AFOSI employees had done most of the sighting investigations that were ever done by the U.S. Air Force. So I was flipping through there looking at page after page after page to see what was interesting and all of a sudden I read a page that began to ring a bell. It was talking about May 24, 1949, and the Rogue River and an aeronautical laboratory which turned out to be Ames Research Laboratory in San Francisco. Lo' and behold, I found the files that described this particular case. Rogue River, Oregon UF O Incident: May 24, 1949 Rogue River winds through Siskiyou National Forest to Gold Beach, Oregon. Ames Research Laboratory eyewitnesses were 2.5 miles from Gold Beach. I found there were five people in a boat fishing about 4 o'clock in the afternoon. So, the sun was behind them to the left as they were looking towards the east. The Rogue River runs into the Pacific Ocean near Gold Beach, Oregon, and they were at a particular place in the river a few miles from the ocean. It's about 300 miles north of San Francisco. Two of the guys were from the Ames Research Laboratory in San Francisco. One was a wind tunnel mechanic and the other was a draftsman. They were using binoculars to see fish jumping in the river. With their naked eye, somebody spotted this round thing approaching in the sky. The witnesses were looking to the east away from the sun. As this thing approached, they could see it was reflecting the sunlight and it looked like a coin seen on edge. It stopped, hovered over the river and stayed there for a couple of minutes and then suddenly accelerated. The men thought it was about a mile from them at the time it was hovering. They said it was like the speed of a jet taking off, but there was no noise . They could see the shape of the object easily with the naked eye, but they could not see fine details on it. But the two men used 8X binoculars to look at the round aerial craft. Under those conditions, they were seeing it as if it was one-eighth the distance. Some people might say eight times closer. In any event, they could see considerable details that show up in the drawing. One guy described the surface as, 'The skin looked wrinkled and dirty.' If you can see the skin well enough to say it looks wrinkled and dirty, you can certainly tell what the overall shape is. It looked like a pancake with a tail fin on it."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Drawings by one of Ames Laboratory eyewitnesses in Battelle Institute Special Report 14, Case X (Serial 1119.00). Case X information: \"An employee in the supersonic laboratory of an aeronautical laboratory (Ames Laboratory, San Francisco) and some other employees of this lab, were by a river, 2 1/2 miles from its mouth, when they saw an object. The time was about 1700 hours on May 24, 1949. The object was reflecting sunlight when observed by naked eye. However, he then looked at it with 8-power binocuolars, at which time there was no glare. (Did glasses have filter?) It was of metallic construction and was seen with good enough resolution to show that the skin was dirty. It moved off in horizontal flight at a gradually increasing rate of speed, until it seemed to approach the speed of a jet before it disappeared. No propulsion was apparent. Time of observation was 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. One of the gentlemen said as he watched, the object rotated on a vertical axis and then started to accelerate. Each man had a chance to look at it through binoculars. So you had two people who were eyewitnesses who worked at a laboratory where they were doing advanced aeronautical experiments the Ames Research Laboratory south of San Francisco. The first anyone heard of this sighting was when they reported it to their security officer in the security office where they worked. This sighting is sufficiently detailed, that it has to be the real thing or a hoax. But if it were a hoax, you would not expect them to report it to the security office where they worked! Security offices aren't too happy to investigate hoaxes. Anyway, the security office then called the U. S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations and asked for an investigation. BRUCE, HOW COULD ANYTHING LIKE THIS SIZE TURNING AROUND A VERTICAL AXIS OCCUR IN MAY OF 1949? Let's say, we did not have one (that could do it). But this case has been largely ignored. It's sufficiently detailed that it's either the real thing or a hoax, and I reject the hoax idea because it was documented in the AFOSI investigation that these laboratory people were who they said they were. The AFOSI went to the place the guy was a draftsman. They went to the wind tunnel where the other guy worked, where they were testing aeronautical shapes for airplanes. First , AFOSI got sort of a casual interview with each of the gentlemen. Then they went back again and got signed affidavits from each one of them. Project Blue Book Indexed Cr aft As \"Aircraft\" and \"Kite\" They also interviewed the third man who was on the boat: a dentist. And then there were two women who were wives of two of the men. One of the women described this thing as being the size of a C-47 which she saw flying over her house frequently back then. Her sighting report is what ended up in the Project Blue Book file as 'an airplane.' Remember I said if you look in the index of the Blue Book file, you find there are two references to May 24, 1949 - one of them which was 'kites' and the other which was 'aircraft.' So because the woman compared the size of the round object to the size of an aircraft, the investigators said, 'Well, it was an aircraft.' How did they come up with the other designation 'kites'? Well, if you read through the totality of the AFOSI investigation, the guy who did the investigation was trying to find out what in the world were these people seeing. He had the description of it. So, he called up radar installations that were nearby and found out there was no radar coverage in the area, that there could have been airplanes flying along the coast, but nobody would be able to say if there was anything in the vicinity at the time they saw the sighting. But the guy did find that there were radar kites launched several times a day from San Francisco. The radar kite we are talking about is similar to a mogul balloon! (laughter) The radar kite is a folded aluminum cube that looks like a box with its corners punched inward to reflect radio signals, high frequency radio signals that are used for radar. It's got 3 or 4 or 5 balloons attached to the top of it to carry it. These things are launched and they use their radar to track the radar kite as it's moving along to find out the wind speeds at various altitudes. They do this a couple of times a day in San Francisco."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"So, this investigator ended his report by saying that there is a possibility that one of the radar kite balloons might have gotten as far north as Rogue River. The implication was that this was a possible explanation. And apparently, somebody in Project Blue Book received that report from the AFOSI and said, 'OK, we'll call it a radar kite.' Who's going to complain? I mean, back in 1949 to 1950 to 1951 when Project Blue Book was assimilating this particular sighting into their case file, how were they to know that 30 years later we would be ripping them apart? Could Not Be A Kite - May 24, 1949 Wind Blew Eastward When I saw the 'kite' explanation, I knew it did not make any sense from the point of view of the visual shape. Had there been balloons supporting this round, disk-shaped object, they would have seen the balloons. But then, I said, 'Let's look up the weather.' I looked up the weather for the 23rd and 24th of May 1949. And yes, you can still get weather reports going back dozens of years, I guess. The weather report for several places in the vicinity of Gold Beach, Oregon, showed that the wind was coming from the west towards the east all that time. So, if you had launched a balloon from San Francisco, to go to Gold Beach, it would have to go 300 miles northwestward. But the wind was blowing it eastward. So it would not have even gone in the right direction. So, that knocks the kite explanation out of the water. That's why I like this particular case because it's got credible witnesses who had a considerable time to look at it. They obviously argued with themselves and each other about what they were seeing. It was May 24, 1949, and it was two weeks later that they reported it to the security office which requested an investigation. No one ever came up with a real explanation. It was covered up by Project Blue Book. And if the AFOSI files had not been combined with the Project Blue Book files when they released the microfilm, we would NEVER have known about it! It would still just be a one-paragraph citation as Case 10, Battelle's Special Report 14. WHO GENERATED THE DRAWINGS? Since my investigation, the original intelligence document became available. It's essentially a letter-type Air Intelligence report sent to the predecessor of NASA. There has been an attempt to find the eyewitness, but so far no one has succeeded. But the guy who drew the object, I think, was the wind tunnel mechanic from the aeronautics lab. Another Similar Craft In 1967 - Lake St. Clair, Michigan"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Above close-up and wide shot with tree of unidentified aerial disc photographed on January 9, 1967, in Mt. Clemens region of Lake St. Clair, Michigan © by Dan and Grant Jaroslaw. \"On January 9, 1967, two teenage brothers, Dan and Grant Jaroslaw, made some photos of a domed object with an apparent tower on one side over Lake St. Clair, Michigan. They photographed it from the backyard of their Mt. Clemens home, about a mile from Selfridge Air Force Base. The object was moving slowly at a very low altitude - probably too low to be picked up on radar at the Base. It remained in view about 10 minutes - ample time for the boys to take their pictures with a small Polaroid. When they released them to a wire service, the Air Force requested the originals for analysis. Evidently the brothers were wary of lending out their original prints, for they kept them under lock and key in a bank - but they did give the UFO officer at Selfridge a set of copies. This officer was quoted as saying they were 'the best I've ever seen.' Nevertheless, Project Blue Book, seizing on the fact that they'd been denied the originals, slapped an 'insufficient data' tag on the case. Dr. J. Allen Hynek (astronomer and Blue Book adviser), however, was impressed with the photos and thought the chance of a hoax having been perpetrated was 'unlikely.'\" Source: UFOS, A Pictorial History from Antiquity to the Present © 1979 by David C. Knight. More Information: Project Blue Book From 1947 until December 17, 1969, the United States Air Force actively investigated reports and sightings of unidentified flying objects under a program called Project Blue Book. U.S. Air Force Secretary Robert C. Seamans, Jr., ended Project Blue Book by saying there was no evidence that unidentified aerial objects were extraterrestrial vehicles or even represented technology beyond modern scientific knowledge. Further, Secy. Seamans said the UFO phenomenon did not represent a threat to American national security. The USAF dismissed most eyewitness reports as misidentification of conventional objects, mass hysteria, disturbed people and hoaxes. But of the 12,618 UFO reports in Project Blue Book which was biased against any public disclosure of the phenomenon's true nature, at least 701 were officially classified as \"unidentified.\" See other Earthfiles with Navy physicist, Bruce Maccabee, Ph.D., about unidentified aerial craft: · 04/14/2005 -- Part 1: \"Battle of Los Angeles\" On February 25, 1942 · 02/11/2005 -- Story Behind \"Inflation-Theory Implications for Extraterrestrial Visitation\" · 11/12/2004 -- Strange Metal Pieces from Plains of San Agustin Alleged UFO Crash Site Analyzed · 05/19/2004 -- Why Ball Lightning Does Not Explain Facts in Mexico Air Force Infrared and Radar Event · 06/22/2000 -- The UFO/FBI Connection by U.
