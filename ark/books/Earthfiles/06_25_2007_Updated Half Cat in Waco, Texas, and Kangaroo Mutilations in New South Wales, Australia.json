Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Half Cat in Waco, Texas, and Kangaroo Mutilations in New South Wales, Australia © 2007 by Linda Moulton Howe \" ...The fact that the mu tilation of these kangaroos has happened in a national park, land set aside specifically to act as a haven for native animals, is beyond comprehension.” - NSW N ational Parks and Wildlife Service H alf-cat photographed by Plano, Texas Police Officer for Incident Report No. 91-44994, August 31, 1991. June 23, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Texas has had repeating cycles of cat and other animal mutilations for at least sixteen years. In Plano, Texas, an affluent suburb north of Dallas, in 1991 and 1993, police received dozens of reports about cats found cut in half, usually with the front half near the owner’s yard or sidewalk. Plano police also had missing reports on more than 80 domestic house cats that wore collars and identification tags, but were never found. Police investigated satanic cult activities, but could not find any evidence that connected them to the mutilated and missing cats and other animals such as dogs. Between March and September 2001, twenty-three mutilated half cats had been reported to the Austin, Texas, police and the Travis County Sheriff's Office. Between February and July 2005, 7 seven dead and bloodlessly cut up cats were found on Dallas, Texas, lawns and reported to police. In the past eight months since November 2006, Corpus Christi has had reports of half a dozen cats cut open, organs removed and sometimes the head and paws excised - all without blood. Similar waves of cat, and half cat, mutilations have been reported throughout the world since at least the 1970s. Waco, Texas "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"W aco, Texas, has McGregor AFB and is near two other military installations not far to the southwest: Fort Hood Military Reservation and Gray AFB. Then on Thursday, June 21, 2007, I received email from an Earthfiles.com viewer about more half cat mutilations in Texas – this time in Waco, which is located on I-35, halfway between Dallas and Austin. This is what the email said: “A friend of mine found half of his neighbor’s cat on his front lawn. He tells me that it was cut with surgical precision and must have been intentionally placed in the yard. Once he discovered the cat, he spoke with neighbors and found that there have been other such mutilations in the neighborhood. The mutilations were discovered in the week of June 18th to 22nd. What I find troubling is that I can’t figure out how the killers are doing this. I worked in a vet clinic once and I know it is just about impossible to do anything with a frightened cat, much less mutilate one. I have the scars to prove it. Are the perpetrators killing the cats first? If so, how are they killing or trapping them?” The writer and I are in correspondence and I hope soon to interview the Waco resident who discovered the half cat. Whatever I learn from that eyewitness and any other veterinarian information, I will report in an Earthfiles update to this report. Australian Kangaroo Mutilations Melbourne, Australia - July to August 2005 Forty-five minutes by car northeast of downtown Melbourne, Australia, is the Yarrambat Golf Course. From July to August 2005, a dozen kangaroos were found dead and decapitated without blood or signs of struggle on the neat, green grass. No one at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was contacted until Tuesday, August 9. What the RSPCA heard was so baffling, so unprecedented, that authorities are at a loss to explain what happened. Groundkeepers in the early mornings of twelve different days found kangaroos dead with their heads cut off."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"South Durras, NSW S outh Durras is 10 miles (17 kilometers) north of Batemans Bay. This year, on June 13, 2007, police in New South Wales, Australia, began investigating the mutilation deaths of three kangaroos in a national park at South Durras, south of Sydney. Durras North, Durras Lake and Durras South are 174 miles (280 kilometers) south of Sydney and 10 miles (17 kilometers) north of Batemans Bay. The region is very rural with little tourist development on the edges of Murramurrang National Park, famous for the large population of beach-loving kangaroos. Wildlife rangers said they were shocked at the gruesome deaths. Authorities said one of the kangaroos was decapitated – but did not specify if the beheading was without blood. In the cat mutilation syndrome over the decades, several have been found with the head surgically removed, without blood. Another kangaroo had been beaten to death, the report said, but gave no other details. A third kangaroo had its eyes “gouged out” – again without specific details concerning possible clean, bloodless removal of the eyes as reported for nearly half a century in large animal mutilations. The kangaroo missing its eyes had a 5-month-old baby kangaroo still alive in its pouch. The baby is now being cared for by a wildlife officer. The Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service in New South Wales told reporters: “I have never come across anything as bad as this in my many years with the wildlife service. The staff and I are completely disgusted by what has occurred – the fact that the mutilation of these kangaroos has happened in a national park, land set aside specifically to act as a haven for native animals, is beyond comprehension.”"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"To date, no one has been arrested or arraigned on charges of killing and mutilating the three kangaroos.
