Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Animal Mutilations Increase Again in Argentina © 2006 by Linda Moulton Howe S anta Rosa, central top of map, is in the La Pampa Province of Argentina, northwest of Bahia Blanca. The yellow areas have all had repeated animal mutilations since 2002, with an estimated total of more than 3,000 in Argentina and Chile. September 20, 2006 Santa Rosa, La Pampa, Argentina - Argentina animal mutilation investigator, Guillermo D. Gimenez, recently sent me a report from Santa Rosa, La Pampa Province, Argentina, by Salvatore Valentin Carta, about the unusual death and mutilation of a pregnant mare found bloodlessly cut up. The ranch owners said the horse was not theirs and the mare's owner is still unidentified. How did the pregnant mare end up on a stranger's property? L eft side of mare's head removed to the bone; left eye removed, tongue removed, internal organs removed. Image © 2006 by Salvatore Valentin Carta. Translation of Carta's September 10, 2006, report: \"The location of the mutilated mare was north of Santa Rosa near National Route 35 at the 333 kilometer marker. The mare was about 3-years-old and we are pretty sure was pregnant.

Image © 2006 by Salvatore Valentin Carta. \"The body of the mare was empty of organs, the left eye had been cut out and the left side of the horse's jaw was cut off along with the tongue. We estimate the mare had been in this condition for about five days. There were many flies and worms. On September 10 (day of Carta's investigation), it appeared that the horse had been pulled/moved from its original site. \"About 100 meters away is an establishment that raises horses. We asked them about the dead and mutilated mare and they told us the horse did not belong to their property.\" Other La Pampa High Strangeness Since September 10, 2006 Scott Corrales of Inexplicata , Journal of Hispanic Ufology, translated a Centro de Estudios UFO (CEUFO) report by Quique Mario dated September 17, 2006: \"There has been noticeable UFO activity in our region over the past few weeks. On Friday at 20:10 hours (8:10 p.m.), there were several witnesses to the vertical descent of a light having the relative size of a soccer ball, ranging in color from white to sky blue. What was most remarkable about the object was its vertical trajectory. The episode was seen to the west of the city of Santa Rosa, capital of La Pampa Province, Argentinean Patagonia. \"At 20:00 hours (8:00 p.m.), we received a report concerning the presence of another object with a size similar to that of an elongated football, swept backward, having the general shape of 'a pear,' to the southwest of the town of Macachin, some 150 kilometers southeast of Santa Rosa. Another resident driving along the road from the Province of Buenos Aires heading into La Pampa also described a phenomenon whose description matched the former. \"Only minutes ago, dozens of witnesses informed me of the transit of two strange objects flying west to east at regular speed, one ahead of the other. Eyewitnesses reported that they resembled 'the lights of two cars, one ahead of the other.' The observation lasted nearly 3 minutes and surprisingly, the lights 'went out.' \"In recent weeks, animals have been found mutilated in bizarre fashion in western La Pampa, while the presence of 'lights' is reported nearly daily. The Centro de Estudios UFO will visit the area in order to compile more details and eyewitness accounts. Six More Recent 2006 Cattle Mutilation Reports September 18, 2006, Inexplicata translation: \"It was verified that in a rural farm located in the vicinity of the 'Padre Buodo' wilderness, located at the crossing of National Routes No. 35 and 152, Jurisdiction of General Acha (south of Santa Rosas in above map), two black Aberdeen Angus heifers and a calf of the same type and color appeared to have been mutilated, presenting signs of bodily damage similar to others detected recently (for example, above mare). \"The deaths, according to the veterinarians consulted, occurred some ten days"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"prior to the date of their discovery. Moreover, in the locality of Quehue, on Provincial Route 18, Kilometer 94, at the 'San Emilio' farm, another Black Angus calf was found dead and mutilated. A similar fate befell a cow (same breed and color) found between the localities of Quehue and Utracan, to the north of General Acha, on Provincial Route 9. It should be noted that there has been an increase in cattle mutilations in La Pampa Province, with specimens of the Aberdeen Angus breed being predominant.\" September 19, 2006, Inexplicata translation: \"Another black Aberdeen Angus cow - this time pregnant - was found dead and mutilated at 17 kilometers from Provincial Route No. 152, jurisdiction of General Acha, a locality some 110 kilometers (68 miles) south of Santa Rosa, La Pampa. \"The animal was missing its right ear, presented a large incision in the udder and an absence of genitals and anus. Only a large hole measuring some 25 centimeters (10 inches) in diameter was found, with its edges cauterized, and through which 40 centimeters (16 inches) of the dead front legs of its unborn calf protruded. \"The animal's death is estimated to have occurred ten days ago and goes on to form part of the numerous cases reported in the area, which have the aforementioned Pampean locality as their epicenter.\" Since 2002, Animal Mutilations and UFOs L eft: Young calf owned by Camilo Lisiardo in Rufino, Cordoba Province, Argentina, found dead and mutilated on July 1, 2002. Its jaw flesh was thoroughly removed. Photograph © 2002 by El Diario de la Republica . Right: Strange lights continue to be reported in areas of mutilated animals, such as this one videotaped on July 10, 2002, in Villarrica, Chile. Video frame © 2002 by Alberto Sandoval. Perhaps the strangest event in Argentina in 2002 occurred at the end of June. The location was Suco west of Rio Cuarto very near the border of San Luis Province. A well-known livestock producer found nineteen of his cattle inside a large water tank that had a sheet metal tank and a metal conical cap. Nine of the cattle were dead, according to a veterinarian who was called to examine the animals. The remaining ten animals were alive inside the water tank, but near death from the freezing cold temperature of the water. Police also investigated. So far, no one has been able to explain how the nineteen cattle were put inside the tank, which was even surrounded by a tall fence. If you consider eyewitness accounts in the United States over the past 30 years in which people have seen beams of light come out of glowing discs in the sky and have watched animals rise up in the beams and then be lowered back down into pastures by the beams, such a technology might be able to put nineteen cattle inside the water tank. If that did happen, it still does not answer the question: why would anyone, or anything, want to put nineteen cattle inside a large water tank?
