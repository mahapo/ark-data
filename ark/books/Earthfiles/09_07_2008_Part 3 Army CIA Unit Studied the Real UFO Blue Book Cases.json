R eturn to Part 1 September 7, 2008 Albuquerque, New Mexico - May 30, 1998 But when I went to Area 51 with my boss in 1958, I did see another type of being that had the great big eyes and little, pointed chin, that has since been called a ‘Grey.’ CAN YOU DESCRIBE THAT EXPERIENCE IN DETAIL? We were out there at Area 51 for a meeting of all the CIA people around this country and from the Far East. The meeting was related to the CIA Project Blue Book and they wanted the meeting at Area 51. There were only five of us involved directly with Project Blue Book who went from our southeastern military base. They had meetings a little base the USAF had there. NELLIS AFB? We went out to the Groom Lake area. There were two areas out there that they showed only to the five of us from our southeastern military base – and not to the CIA people from the Far East or from Central America or other international areas. WHEN YOU WENT TO AREA 51, DID YOU GO UNDERGROUND? "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"No, there was an airport where you land. Then they took us by a jeep van they had, took the five of us along with some local officers, and we drove about 8 or 10 miles to the first facility. At that facility, they had like U-2s and the SR- 71. They were just beginning to fly the SR-71s that replaced the U-2s. Then we drove another five miles or so and there was another facility ar ound the side of a little mountain. It was in this fac ility they had both above and below ground hangar-type structures. That’s where they had some of the captured UFOs they had found and hauled in. At that time, the Roswell craft was there (from 1947), but it had just been brought in from California. IT HAD BEEN WHERE? If I recall correctly, it was not from Edwards AFB. It was another out there (China Lake?). DO YOU MEAN THE CIA HAD TAKEN DEBRIS OR A WHOLE CRAFT TO CALIFORNIA? We were told that the original debris for a short period of time was at the Roswell Army Air Field. From there, it went to Fort Riley, Kansas, where it was for a week. The government was trying to figure out what to do with it and where best to work on such a classified object. It was wrapped up on a truck under camouflage, so no one would know what it was. And then it went to Ohio to Wright Field outside of Dayton, Ohio (became Wright- Patterson AFB). It was there for about a year and some of the scientists from the area the government brought in to look at. Then in California, there was a group of scientists from the West Coast who they checked their backgrounds and gave TOP SECRET clearances who were looking at the different technologies inside the craft. At the time, I was out there in 1958, the craft was brought to Area 51 to have some people there look at it in the Groom Lake area. They had other craft out there, about six of them.

Photograph from 16mm film © 1996 by Orbital Media Ltd."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WHAT DID YOU SEE? I saw the craft and I saw they had tried to reverse-engineer it, so part of it was taken apart. They were trying to figure out how it worked and they were explaining to us there really was no physical motor in that craft. The whole craft was like an electronic circuit and the aliens had to be inside the craft with headbands on and their fingertips in control panels in order to complete the electronic circuit to make it fly. Our people had tried to make one disc fly like a battery-charged electrical unit that worked with an anti-gravitational, electromagnetic drive. But the whole saucer itself was like the drive of a ship and coated with nickel inside and it was like a giant electronic circuit. It took the aliens to complete the circuit because they were tied right in with it some how. They had headbands they wore that had detectors in them (for telepathic thoughts?) and had hand imprinted consoles where they could fly the craft with their fingertips. THOSE HAND-IMPRINTED 6-FINGERED CONTROL PANELS THAT WERE WITH THE AUTOPSY FILM BY SANTILLI. DID YOU SEE THE PANELS YOURSELF THERE AT AREA 51 WITH THE CRAFT? Yes, they were there with the craft. They were trying to figure out the electronic circuitry because there was no wiring of any kind that they could see. Later on, a couple of scientists at Groom Lake used microscopes to investigate the hand-imprinted panels and they found little fibers going from it. The microscopes could see fiber optic transmissions, which extended throughout the craft. ALL CARRYING LIGHT TRANSMISSIONS. Yes, all by light. In the report I read originally, it said when they first looked inside the craft, it was kind of glowing with a dim light inside from all the fiber optics circuitry. Reverse engineering that is apparently where we got our fiber optics today. THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT LT. COL. PHILIP J. CORSO SAID IN HIS BOOK, THE DAY AFTER ROSWELL. BUT YOU WERE SAYING YOU WERE TAKEN TO AREA 51 WHERE THERE WERE HALF A DOZEN CRAFT AND YOU ALSO SAW A LIVE BEING. Yes, they showed us one being. They would not say how many they had. My boss asked them how many beings they had at Area 51 Groom Lake and they just said they were going to show us this one. They did not say if it was the only one they had, but we would be allowed to see it and communicate with it. I did not go into the room, but I saw the individual through a one-way window that was in a larger room and the being was in a smaller room behind the one-way window. My boss and the other three people did go in and tried to question the being to see if they could learn anything. I know the being did not speak outright. It was only telepathic. You would think of a question in your mind, according to my boss, and the being would answer it before you even said it. SO YOU ARE STANDING BEHIND THE ONE-WAY WINDOW AND YOU ARE SEEING INTO A ROOM WHERE THE BEING AND YOUR BOSS AND THREE OTHER MEN GO INTO THE ROOM. FIRST, COULD YOU DESCRIBE WHAT THE BEING LOOKED LIKE TO YOU? The skin was grey and looked kind of coarse, instead of smooth like ours. It had a really narrow mouth, just holes for the ears. The pointed chin with the bigger head that gets"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"wider past the eyes with a big lobe on top for the brain. WHAT DID THE EYES LOOK LIKE? They were very dark and very big. It looked like it had sunglasses on. ANY CLOTHING? Yes, some kind of little jumpsuit on. It looked like something made for him here on Earth. I don’t think it was his flight suit. I think it was something they just dressed it up in. COLOR? Grey! (laughs) IF YOU WERE COMPARING THE COLOR OF THE GREY SKIN TO A GREY WE MIGHT ALL KNOW, WHAT WOULD THAT GREY BE? Darker than gray cement. DARKER THAN A SIDEWALK? Yes. I would say like a medium gray in paint samples. HOW TALL WAS THE GREY BEING? I would say around 5-feet-tall. DO YOU REMEMBER THE HANDS ON THAT BEING? I never saw his hands. It was walking around and had his hands behind him and almost like pacing back and forth. So I never got a chance to see its hands. I think I asked my boss how many fingers it had. I don’t recall exactly what he said, but it was not six fingers. COULD YOU SEE FEET AND LEGS? No, because there was a desk and the one-way window was up higher and I was in the room behind and I could not see behind the desk. I did not stand up to go to the window to look down either. YOUR BOSS AND THE THREE MEN ARE THERE IN THE ROOM INTERACTING. HOW DID THEY INTERACT WITH THE BEING? My boss did ask it what it was doing here on Earth and why they had come here. The only answer he got was that the grey beings were not here to conquer the Earth or to destroy anything. It said they were here to add knowledge to humans so we could gain more knowledge in different areas. DID YOUR BOSS ASK THAT QUESTION OUT LOUD OR THINK IT? He asked that question out loud. I could see his lips move and I could sort of read his lips. DID HE DESCRIBE TO YOU HOW THE BEING COMMUNICATED BACK? Only telepathically, my boss heard in his head what the being had said – not through my boss’s ears, but in his mind. DID THE OTHER THREE MEN HEAR THE SAME ANSWER? Yes, they did. We were all talking about it on the way in there before we got into the room. I told my boss I was not going to go in because I did not feel comfortable because I thought we might be interviewing a demon and I didn’t want to get tied into anything like that. But I said to my boss, ‘Ask it if it’s a demon.’ My boss did. The men in the room with the grey being asked him if he were a fallen angel or demon and if it knew what demons"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"were. The being was very upset by being called a demon. DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOUR BOSS SAID THE GREY BEING COMMUNICATED TELEPATHCIALLY IN ANSWER TO THOSE QUESTIONS? Yes, the being said it was not a demon. That he and his type were not demons, but they knew what demons were and sometimes they did work with them on some things they were doing on Earth.” ontinued in Part 4 More Information : T he Day After Roswell © 1997 by Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso (Ret.). C lick for Amazon.com. Pages 97-98: “The medical examiners believed that the alien brain, way oversized in comparison with the human brain and in proportion to the creature's small stature, had four distinct sections. ... Where the possib ility of some evidence about the workings of the alien brain did exist was in what I referred to in my reports as the 'headbands.' Among the artifacts we retrieved were devices that looked something like headbands, but had neither adornment nor decoration of any kind. “Embedded by some very advanced kind of vulcanizing process into a form of flexible plastic were what we now know to have been electrical conductors or sensors, similar to the conductors on an electroencephalograph or polygraph. This band was fitted around the part of the alien cranium just above the ears where the skull began to expand to accommodate the large brain. ...( research) suggested that the sensors stimulated different parts of the brain while at the same time exchanged information with the brain. Using the analogy of an EEG, these devices were a very sophisticated mechanism for translating the electrical impulses inside the creatures' brains into specific commands. Perhaps these headband devices comprised the pilot interface of the ship's navigational and propulsion system combined with a long-range communications device. Page 109: “Maybe the headbands had to be calibrated or tuned to each individual pilot, or maybe the pilots - since I believed they were genetically"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"engineered beings biologically manufactured especially for flight or long-term exploration - had to be calibrated to the headband. ...I could see how directional instructions could have been translated by the headbands into some form of current flowing through the skins and into the series of raised deck panels where there were indentations for the creatures' hands. The indentations on these panels, as the Roswell field reports described them, looked like the hand prints pressed into the concrete at the old Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood. Were the directional commands a series of electronic instructions transmitted directly from the creatures' brains along their bodies and through the panels into the ship itself as if the ship were only an extension of the creature's body?” M yrna Loy's 1936 hand prints in wet cement outside Grauman's Chinese Theater, Hollywood, California.
