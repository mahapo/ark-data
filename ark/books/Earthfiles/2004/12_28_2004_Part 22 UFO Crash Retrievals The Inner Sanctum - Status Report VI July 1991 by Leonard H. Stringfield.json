Carp, Ontario, Canada, southwest of Ottawa, where allegedly a non-terrestrial aerial craft,containing humanoid reptilian entities, \"crashed\" on November 4, 1989.Alleged video frame of unidentified aerial craft which allegedly landed - or crashed?- at Carp, Ontario, Canada, on November 4, 1989. Leonard Stringfield: \"THE CARP, CANADA UFO CRASH CASE: ASIDESHOW ATTRACTION? If there are questions about the Kalahari Desert crash, there are even more about areported crash in the town of Carp, near Ottawa, on November 4 , 1989. Based on an on-going cooperative investigation by two qualified Canadian researchorganizations, the four-page report - which describes the usual scenario ofcrash/retrieval events - seems to be baseless; in short, probably a hoax. The reasonbehind its perpetration is anybody's guess. Although the report reads like a creationof an impish mind, I cannot discount the possibility that it was an orchestrateddisinformation ploy designed to 'muddy the waters' during the time when theKalahari incident was making big UFOlogical news. Hypothetically, if something of significance did crash in the African desert, therelease of a faked case like Carp - depending upon its exposure as such - might serveas a diversionary contaminant. Whatever the ulterior purpose, the Carp report composed of two pages of text and"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"two with poorly depicted photos showing a map and a hardly visible 'alien,' gotattention among worldwide researchers. Walt Andrus of MUFON sent me a copy,his source unknown. Following is a verbatim copy of the Carp report, minus the attachments, which aretoo murky for reproduction.Anonymous Carp Report: 'Canadian and American Security Agencies are engaged in a conspiracy ofsilence to withhold from the world the alien vessel seized in the swamps ofCorkery Road, Carp, in 1989. UFO sightings in the Ontario region had intensified in the 1980s, specificallyaround nuclear power generating stations. On November 4, 1989, at 20:00hours, Canadian Defense Department radars picked up a globe-shaped objecttraveling at a phenomenal speed over Carp, Ontario. The UFO abruptlystopped and dropped like a stone. Canadian and American Security Agencies were immediately notified of thelanding. Monitoring satellites traced the movements of the aliens to atriangular area off Old Almonte and Corkery Roads. The ship had landed in deep swamp near Corkery Road. Two AH-64 Apachesand a UH-60 Blackhawk headed for the area the following night. Thehelicopters carried full weapon loads. They were part of a covert Americanunit that specialized in the recovery of alien craft. Flying low over Ontario pine trees, the Apache attack choppers soon spotted aglowing, blue, 20-metre-in-diameter sphere. As targeting lasers locked on,both gunships unleashed their full weapon loads of eight missiles each. Allsixteen were exploded in proximity bursts ten metres downwind from the ship. The missiles were carrying VEXXON, a deadly neuroactive gas which kills oncontact. Exposed to air, the gas breaks down quickly into inert components.Immediately after having completed their mission, the gunships turned aroundand headed back across the border. Now the Blackhawk landed, as men exploded from its open doors. In seconds,the six-man strike team had entered the UFO through a seven metre hatchless,oval, portal. No resistance was encountered. At the controls, three deadcrewmen were found. With the ship captured, the United States Air Force, Pentagon and Office ofNaval Intelligence were notified. Through the night, a special team oftechnicians had shut down and disassembled the sphere. Early the nextmorning, November 6, 1989, construction equipment and trucks were broughtinto the swamp. The UFO parts were transported to a secret facility in Kanata,Ontario. As a cover story, the locals were informed that a road was being built throughthe swamp. No smokescreen was needed for the military activity as Canadianforces regularly train in the Carp region. Officially, nothing unusual wasreported in the area. Although someone anonymously turned in a 35mm roll offilm. It was received by the National Research Council of Canada, in Ottawa.The film contained several clear shots of an entity holding a light. At this time,the photographer is still unidentified. The humanoids were packed in ice and sent to an isolation chamber at theUniversity of Ottawa. CIA physiologists performed the autopsies. The threereptilian, fetus-headed beings, were listed as CLASS 1 NTE's (Non-TerrestrialEntities). Like others recovered in previous operations, they were muscular,grey-white skinned humanoids. The ship was partially reassembled at the underground facility in Kanata.Unlike previous recoveries, this one is pure military. Built as a 'Starfighter,' itis heavily armed and armored. In design, no rivets, bolts, or welds were usedin fastening, yet when reconstructed there are no seams. The UFO itself ismade up of a matrixed dielectric magnesium alloy. It is driven by pulsed electromagnetic fields generated by a cold fusionreactor. All offensive capabilities utilize independently targeting, electronicbeam weapons. In the cargo hold were found ordnance racks containing fifty"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Soviet nuclear warheads. Their purpose was revealed by advancedtactical/combat computers located in the flight deck. Threatened by recent East-West relations and the revolutionary movementswithin itself, Red China is preparing for the final ideological war. The alienshave agreed to defend China from the free world's combined military andnuclear forces. At this time, China is arming the Middle East with their own nuclear arsenalsin order that they can successfully take on Israel. Unifying the Arabs underone Chinese command was simple, especially with Israel's recent 'Iron Fist'attitude towards the occupied Arab territories. The Soviet warheads found in the UFO were destined for Syria.CIA-operatives in the Middle East have noticed huge movements of Chinese'technicians' and 'advisers.' China is also supplying the Arabs withbacteriological agents, Migs, Hind gunships, tanks, and missile launchers. The use of 'Soviet' instead of 'Chinese' nukes is part of a disinformationcampaign to break up East-West relations after the annihilation of Israel. Thewarheads were hijacked from Soviet submarines in the Dragon's Triangle, asection of alien-controlled Pacific once frequented by Russian subs. Afterlosing some 900 high yield warheads and thirteen vessels, commanders wereordered to steer clear of the area. The most important alien-technology find were the two millimetre, spheroid,brain implants. Surgically inserted through the nasal orifice, the individual canbe fully monitored and controlled. The CIA and Canadian Government haveactively supported mind-slave experiments for years. Currently, the Universityof Ottawa is involved in Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) wave mind controlprograms, a continuation of the CIA psychological warfare project known asMKULTRA, started at the Allen Memorial Institute in Montreal (Editor'sNote: Allegedly a CIA-linked medical institute in Canada). Using ELF signals transmitted at the same wavelength the human brain uses,the researchers could subliminally control the test project. The alien implantsutilize the same principles, except that the whole unit is subminiaturized andcontained in the brain. Fortunately, the implants can be detected by magneticresolution scanning technology. All individuals implanted by the aliens areclassified as ZOMBIES. The ZOMBIES have been programmed to help overthrow Mankind in thenear future. When China finishes with Israel, it will invade Europe. At thesame time, Chinese space-based bacteriological weapons will be launched atthe Artic (sic). The winds will carry the diseases into Russia and NorthAmerica. In days, hundreds of millions will be dead; the survivors will have todeal with the Chinese, the aliens and the ZOMBIES. The aliens want an all-out war so that human resistance would be minimalwhen they invade. They tried this same tactic once before with NaziGermany. Most of the scientific advances we have today came from Germanscience which was based on alien technology. Had Hitler won the war, theEarth would have become a concentration camp in order to depopulate thecontinents for the aliens. Data aboard the sphere explained why the aliens are so comfortable on ourworld. They preceded man on the evolutionary scale by millions of years;(they) created the dinosaurs. Some 65 million years ago, an interdimensionalwar destroyed most of their civilization and forced them to leave the Earth.Now, they have chosen to reclaim what was once theirs. The alien forces with their Chinese and Arab allies will attack within the nextfive years. Waiting longer than that would make it impossible, even for thealiens, to reverse the ecological damage inflicted on the Earth by Man.' Leonard Stringfield: \"The first evaluation of the crash, after a preliminary investigation, came from CliveNadin of the Ottawa Centre of UFO Studies, dated July 17, 1990. The report in partfollows:"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Clive Nadin, Ottawa Centre of UFO Studies, J uly17, 1990: 'In February of this year, a number of Canadian UFO investigators/researchersreceived a two-page letter from an anonymous source, along with twophotocopies of an aerial photograph and an alleged photograph of an alienentity, copies of which are enclosed with this letter. It is worth noting thatonly a few investigators in Ontario and Quebec Provinces received copies ofthis letter from the author. No researchers further West received a copy, and Ibelieve the copy that Stanton Friedman received came from a copy madefrom an original. From reading the letter, it is obvious that the author has many biases, andthere are hints of anti-Semitism. It appears as a very poor hoax from firstinspection. However, from onsite investigations by myself and Ron Graham,three persons have been found near the location given on the aerial shot, thathave reported strange lights seen during a weekend in November. In addition,these persons reported strange helicopter activity over this area either prior to,or just after, this light was seen. The light was seen at 2000 hrs. one evening early in November (the date hasnot been confirmed as the 4th or 5th of November at this time), and thehelicopters were seen at a time of 1700 to 1800 hrs., either before the lightwas seen, or the following day (this is still uncertain). The helicopters (up tosix in number) were described as 'twin-rotor' type. There are seven CH-47C Boeing-Vertol Chinooks currently in service with theCanadian Armed Forces, located in two bases in Canada - Ottawa andEdmonton. Ottawa is located a short flight distance from the 'crash' site.Chinooks frequently fly over this area as the Boeing maintenance facility islocated West from Carp at Arnprior. The only other twin-rotored helicopterflown by the Canadian Forces is the CH-46 Sea Knight, which is used for SARduties at bases on the East and West Canadian coasts; and I believe, they areall yellow in color. An inspection of the area on foot did not locate any evidence of heavyequipment having been moved into this area, and discreet inquiries of localsconfirmed this. Inquiries with the Canadian Department of National Defense(DND) has, so far, been unsuccessful, with my initial letter missing, and mysecond unanswered. No doubt, someone will suggest that this is indicative of acover-up, but I'm sure that it is just due to incompetence on the part of theDND. This investigation is on-going, and I hope to uncover further witnesses in thenear future. I consider the likelihood of a crash/retrieval somewhat remote,but there are still a number of puzzling questions unanswered. What I amconcentrating on at the moment are these reports of helicopters in the areaaround the time the light was seen.' Leonard Stringfield: \"Having heard nothing further from Nadin, I contactedresearcher, Christian Page, President, O.C.I.P.E. (Organization de Compiliation (sic)et D'Information Sur Les Phenomenes Estranges) in Quebec, Canada. I quote fromhis letter, May 30, 1991, as follows: Christian Page, O.C.I.P.E., May 30, 1991: 'On February 12, 1990, an anonymous letter was received at the address ofthe Centrale Ufologique de Quebec, a late UFOlogical association, of which Iwas a member. Beside a mistake in the spelling, which should read 'duQuebec' instead of 'de Quebec,' proves that the author of the document had apoor knowledge of the French language. Be that as it may, I was suspicious ofthe blurred pictures. I immediately informed a colleague, Chris Rutkowski,who - with the collaboration of Clive Nadin - was able to underline someirregularities in the Carp document. Following is an extract from the SwampGas Journal (Vol. 5, No. 1, April 1990), a newsletter published by theCanadian group, UFO Research of Manitoba, directed by Rutkowski.Swamp Gas Journal, Vol. 5, No. 1, April 1990: 'The crash was alleged tohave occurred just outside of Ottawa near the town of Carp. The crashsupposedly took place on November 4, 1989, shortly after 8:00 PM(Ottawa time). The first indication that something is amiss is thecomment that: 'Early the next morning, November 6 ...' Already there is"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"some confusion about the date. Although it is said that a cover storyabout construction in the area was the reason for the heavy equipment,at least some inquiries of the local townspeople revealed that no onehad heard of any construction there at all. 'The writer is also obviously Canadian. He or she knows the area wellenough to describe the Corkery Road swamp and pinpoint it on a map.The writer also knows about the 'underground facility' at Kanata, justclose by which is basically a nuclear fallout bunker for politicians andmilitary personnel. The word 'metre' is spelled in the Canadian format,unlike the American 'meter.' The University of Ottawa is identified as afacility where clandestine CIA mind control experiments had been donein the past and which an official inquiry has determined did take place. 'The mystery writer also knows a fair bit about military weaponry,noting things like AH-64 Apache and UH-60 Blackhawks. Along theway, the writer mentions Berlitz's latest book, Dragon's Triangle(Editor's Note: Copyright 1989 by Charles Berlitz), alien brain implantsand photographs in the possession of the NRC (National ResearchCouncil). At least one mistake in the text can be found: the writerinterprets the process as 'magnetic resolution scanning,' instead of'magnetic resonance scanning,' and this suggests that the writer justthrew together these concepts to make it look like he or she was fullyinformed. 'The sections in the text which talk about China and the Middle Eastclearly show the writer's preoccupation with anti-Semitism and a varietyof other biases. Continued references to Hitler and Naziism imply aHarbinson-like scenario, yet are mixed with other absurd ideas to makeeven this seem logical. There are several incomplete sentences andexamples of bad structure in grammar and punctuation. 'The identity of the writer is still a mystery, although some UFOlogistsmay have their suspicions. Why the letter was written and sent in thefirst place is anybody's guess, although since it comes at a time when anumber of other crash stories are circulating, this is not altogetherunexpected. 'Investigations by Arthur Bray and others in the Ottawa area have foundsome witnesses who recalled seeing 'mystery helicopters' (twin rotor),flying and hovering over the exact spot mentioned in the letter. CliveNadin has scouted the area and found no signs of heavy constructionwork, nor do residents of the area recall any such activity. 'An interesting further complication is the fact that there actually was aUFO report in NRC files from Carp in 1989. It came from a womanwho was driving with her son along a road in the area when a brightly-lighted UFO flew over them and shone a light on them, causing'radiation burns' on her son's arm. Unfortunately, the NRC person whotook the call did not get enough information from the caller andattempts to check the story have been fruitless.' ontinued in Part 23 - Large Aerial Triangles Over Moriches Bay Before Alleged 'UFORetrieval'Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
