Photograph courtesy U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service.Chase Lake National Wildlife Refuge north of Medina, North Dakota, has been the home of nearly30,000 American White Pelicans for the past two years. An estimated 29,000 have disappeared as of May 28,2004. June 29, 2004 Bismarck, North Dakota - The Bismarck, North Dakota office ofthe U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service began hearing that American White Pelicans weredisappearing from the Chase Lake National Wildlife Refuge north of Medina, NorthDakota on May 28, 2004. Two and a half weeks later, 29,000 pelicans had disappearedwithout a trace. See 06/17/04 Earthfiles. Four of the 29,000 pelicans had previously been wired with radio transmitters for migrationresearch from satellites. Today I talked with Ken Torkelson, writer-editor, andspokesperson for the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bismarck, North Dakota, about whatthe satellite reported from those four American White Pelicans.Interview: Ken Torkelson, Writer-editor-spokesperson, U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service,Bismarck, North Dakota: \"Bird Number 36069 took a very circuitous route from ChaseLake. It left on June 2, 2004, and headed almost straight south to the South Dakota border.Then it went a little ways west and back up west/northwest crossing the Missouri bordersouth of Bismarck and headed further northwest. Then it made a little correction to go westand spent a couple of days out there. Then headed back kind of to the southeast across theSouth Dakota line. Then went back west again, almost paralleling the border and spent acouple of days in northwestern South Dakota. Then the bird headed back east/southeast alittle bit and made a correction and sent straight south, eventually ending up on June 15west and a little bit north of Pierre. That was the last satellite reading we had on that one.Bird No. 36070 went pretty much straight south to the South Dakota border taking a coupleof days to get there. Then it made a big turn to the east/southeast, crossing the border andour last reading showed the bird at probably Lake Traverse which is where the two Dakotasand Minnesota come together.The third bird, No. 36071 is the most interesting of the bunch. It headed straight south andwent into south Dakota maybe 30 or 40 miles and spent a week there. Then, it startedcoming back north and crossed the border into North Dakota over the span of a couple of"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"days. then it made a correction and headed northwest, passing within several miles ofChase Lake National Wildlife Refuge where it originally came from before heading furthernorthwest and ending up near Harvey, North Dakota, which is basically north and a littlebit west of Chase Lake. That was the last reading for that bird on June 14, 2004.Then bird No. 36072 knew exactly where it was going and headed there immediately to theSouth Dakota border, straight south of Chase Lake and stayed there until at least the lastsatellite reading on June 18, 2004.THESE WERE THE ONLY FOUR BIRDS THAT WERE RADIO MONITORED ANDCOULD BE TRACKED BY SATELLITE OUT OF THE ESTIMATED 30,000 THATDISAPPEARED?Exactly. But we believe the other pelicans have scattered much like these four scattered.We have now had reports of increased pelican numbers at Tamarac National WildlifeRefuge which is about 50 miles into Minnesota from the North Dakota line. And we havehad increased numbers on the Missouri River, we've had increased numbers up in theTurtle Mountains along the North Dakota/Canada borders of central North Dakota. Pelicans Increase Where Not Seen Before On Yellowstone RiverInterestingly enough, we've had reports of increased numbers of pelicans on theYellowstone River between Sydney, Montana and Williston, North Dakota. Normally thatis not pelican country. We've also had citizen reports of pelicans on Lake Chida which iswest of Bismarck and south 80 miles.DOES ANYBODY YET HAVE A HYPOTHESIS ABOUT WHY NEARLY 30,000 BIRDSWOULD TAKE OFF LIKE THIS AND GO SOME IN A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE ANDSOME ENDING UP IN A WYOMING SITE WHERE THEY'VE NEVER BEENBEFORE?A lack of credible hypotheses is the problem. Were Birds Running Out of Food At Chase Lake?BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT NO ONE KNOWS WHAT SCATTERED 30,000BIRDS IN THE FIRST PLACE?You'd be correct in saying that. We have one interesting theory right now and that is thecold, wet spring at their nesting ground placed increased stress on them and the adult birdsrealized they might not be able to survive in those conditions and left to find some placethey could survive. That theory also includes speculation that the additional rains we've hadmight have made it more difficult for the pelicans to get at their food source. They areshallow water feeders and if a combination of increased water levels and coldertemperatures drove their food base into deeper water, there is going to be the same amountof food there. It's just they can't get at it.SO YOU'VE HAD A LOT MORE RAIN THAN NORMAL?And I'm not sure it was the rain as much as the cold temperatures, although they have hadquite a bit of rain in that Chase Lake area.BUT ISN'T IT STILL BAFFLING THAT NONE OF THEM CAME BACK?It's, yeah, I guess it is. But you know, once they figured there wasn't enough food there tosupport them, why go back? Especially if they found a place with enough food to supportthem.WOULDN'T YOU HAVE THOUGHT THAT SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE WOULDHAVE NOTICED A GIGANTIC FLOCK OF PELICANS FLYING IN THE AIR?I don't think there is and maybe there was not a giant flock of pelicans in the air. I don'tthink they took off en masse. I believe there was a gradual departure meaning maybe theytook off in flights an hour apart.RIGHT NOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PROGNOSIS IS FOR THE FUTURE OFALL THOSE BIRDS THAT ARE SCATTERED?Everybody I talk to believes that we are going to have 30,000 pelicans at Chase Lake againnext year. We're certainly hoping that's correct.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"More Information:To Contact Chase Lake National Wildlife RefugeIF ANYONE HAS INFORMATION, WHO SHOULD THEY CONTACT?Chase Lake National Wildlife Refuge at 701-752-4218.Ken Torkelson: \"We don't want to hear reports of one or two pelicans, but if someone seesa hundred or so pelicans, especially in a place they haven't seen white pelicans before, wedefinitely want to hear about that.\"Website:http://www.fws.govCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
