An asteroid isgoing to pass the Earth's orbit on September 29th, but there astronomers and asteroidspecialists say there is no chance for a hit. The Near-Earth-Passing asteroid is called 4179Toutatis, a very strangely-shaped rock that was first discovered by C. Pollas on January 4,1989, at Caussols, France, on photographic plates taken on the 0.9-m Schmidt telescope byAlain Maury and Derral Mulholland during astrometric observations of Jupiter's faintsatellites. Toutatis is the long streak in the image below. Asteroid 4179 Toutatis first photographed onJanuary 4, 1989, from Caussols, France telescope.The discoverers named the asteroid after the Celtic/Gallic god, Toutatis, who is theprotector of all tribes and who fears nothing - except that someday the sky may fall ontheir heads.Asteroid Toutatis is big, measuring 4.6 kilometers long - nearly 3 miles - by 2.4 kilometerswide - about 1.5 miles. Toutatis has an eccentric, four-year orbit, that extends from justinside the Earth's orbit out to the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. TheNASA/JPL website reports, \"The plane of Toutatis's orbit is closer to the plane of theEarth's orbit than any other known asteroid that is big and crosses Earth's orbit. Toutatismay have the most chaotic orbit studied to date, a consequence of the asteroid's frequentclose approaches to Earth.\"In about four weeks, on September 29, 2004, Asteroid 4179 Toutatis will pass by Earth at arange of four times the distance between the Earth and the Moon - the closest approach ofany known asteroid or comet between now and the year 2027. Could the chaotic orbit ofAsteroid 4179 Toutatis hit Earth any time in the foreseeable future?I talked about that question with Tim Spahr, Ph.D., Technical Near-Earth AsteroidSpecialist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Harvard University."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"NASA/JPL reports: \"These four views of the Toutatis computer model show shallow craters, linear ridges anda deep topographic \"neck\"whose geologic origin is not known. It may have been sculpted by impacts into a single, coherent body, or thisasteroidmight actually consist of two separate objects that came together in a gentle collision. Toutatis is about4.6 kilometers (3 miles) long and the resolution of the computer model is about 84 meters.\"Interview:Tim Spahr, Ph.D., Technical Near-Earth Asteroid Specialist at the SmithsonianAstrophysical Observatory in Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts:Could the Chaotic Orbit of ToutatisHit Earth in the Future?\" The orbit far in the future is difficult to predict because of encounters with the Earth suchas 4 times the Earth-Moon distance and that's still a very safe distance. But, it's observedevery time it passes by and that allows refining of the orbit's calculations. So, every time itis observable when it is fairly near the Earth like that, we improve the orbit again and wecan predict further into the future. Chaos, for a lot of people, that means we don't knowanything. But in this case, it means there are very small changes to the orbital elements ofthe object. In a few hundred years, we will have trouble predicting exactly where it's goingto be. But if we were, for example, to get radar observations this time, or perhaps the nextclose approach, then we would be able to tell the orbit out to 100 years further, or 1000years further.BUT RIGHT NOW, YOU AND OTHER ASTRONOMERS HAVE NO CONCERNWHATSOEVER ABOUT 4179 TOUTATIS COMING CLOSE ENOUGH TO HAVE ANYIMPACT ON THE EARTH THIS SEPTEMBER OF 2004?Absolutely not. There is no chance of it. Learning About Near-Misses After They've PassedNOW, WHAT ABOUT OTHER ASTEROIDS, MINOR PLANETS, OUT THERE IN OURSOLAR SYSTEM? I KNOW IN THE PAST YEAR OR TWO, WE'VE ALL BECOMEAWARE THAT OBJECTS HAVE COME VERY CLOSE TO THE EARTH WITHREALLY NO WARNING. SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED THEM AFTER THEYHAVE PASSED CLOSELY. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU'RE KEEPING AN EYEON NOW THAT MIGHT BE A NEAR-MISS?Actually not. In particular, there are NASA-funded surveys and also some internationally-funded surveys that look for these objects as a matter of course. So, they are beingdiscovered now because people are trying to find objects that might hit us in the next fewyears or maybe even 100 years, so we could do something about it.When you have an object that passed very close to the Earth and it was not picked up untilafter it passed close, that's actually sort of a normal consequence. A certain fraction ofobjects will only be discovered after they have passed the Earth because they were in thedaytime sky, for example, before their close approach, so it was impossible to find them"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"with standard astronomical means.WE KNOW IN THE EARTH'S HISTORY THAT AT LEAST AT THE TIME OF THEDINOSAUR WIPE-OUT-EXTINCTION EVENT THAT IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEENLINKED TO A LARGE ASTEROID IN THE GULF OF MEXICO NEAR THEYUCATAN PENINSULA.Right.THERE ARE OTHER SCIENTISTS WHO SEEM TO HAVE SOME CONCERN THATTHIS HAS HAPPENED PERHAPS MORE THAN WE HAVE REALIZED AND THATASTEROIDS COULD POSE A GREAT POTENTIAL CATASTROPHE TO THE EARTHIN THE FUTURE WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE THE NEAR-EARTH ASTEROIDMONITORING.Ye s . Any Other Known and Potentially DangerousNear-Earth Asteroids Out There?IS THERE ANYTHING ON THE HORIZON THAT WOULD FALL INTO THECATEGORY OF BEING A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR THE EARTH IN THIS CENTURY?No. And in fact, that is the interval for which we monitor every single object we knowabout they are all on 100 year time scales. At this minute, there is nothing that is anythingmore than a minor threat to the Earth, a one in a million chance of hitting the Earth, orsomething like that. It turns out that we are more interested in the objects we DON'TKNOW about and that's why NASA is spending this money to discover the objects as fastas possible. NASA right now is concentrating on finding the objects that are one kilometeracross or larger because those are the ones that pose the most danger to the inhabitants ofthe Earth. As we find more and more of those, the danger goes down because we knowwhere those objects are going to be for the next 100 years. Finding the one kilometernear-Earth asteroids, that job will be done in the next decade.MEANING YOU WILL FEEL CONFIDENT THAT IN TEN YEARS FROM NOW, YOUWILL HAVE FOUND ALL OF THE ONE KILOMETER DIAMETER OBJECTS?All, meaning certainly more than 95% of them. It's hard to find absolutely everything inshort order. But that will be done eventually anyway. What If A Large Near-Earth Asteroid Sneaks Up On EarthWHAT ARE THE ODDS THAT IN THESE TEN YEARS WHILE WE ARE LOOKINGFOR THESE LARGER OBJECTS TO IDENTIFY THEM AND SEE WHAT THEIRORBITS ARE THAT ONE OF THEM COULD SNEAK UP ON US?It's miniscule. It's on the order of one in a billion or something like that. You have a muchbetter chance of winning the lottery four or five times than that happening. When I say'you' winning the lottery, I mean the same one person winning the lottery four or five times.THAN ONE OF THESE LARGER ONE KILOMETER DIAMETER-WIDE ASTEROIDSIMPACTING WITH OUR PLANET?Yes.What I tell people is not to worry about it because there are a whole lot of peoplearound the globe that are concerned about this problem and we are attacking it from ascientific point of view and trying to discover these things as fast as possible, to determinetheir orbits, and to compute the chance that they might hit. If we find one that is going tohit, then we'll go one step further. But the most important thing is to discover the objectsand there is a good deal of money being spent on that right now.IF WE IDENTIFIED ONE OF THESE OBJECTS IN ORBIT, WOULD WE HAVEENOUGH TIME TO FIGURE OUT AN APPROACH TO TRY TO DEFLECT ORDESTROY IT?I think so. The most important part is detecting the object first. If you find an object that isgoing to hit in a couple of weeks, you probably don't have any time. But the way thescenario is being run now is to try to find the objects dozens or hundreds of years beforeimpact and then we'd have plenty of time to think about it and implement a plan."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Why Don't More Asteroids Collide With Earth?WITH SO MANY ASTEROIDS OUT THERE IN THE ASTEROID BELT, WHY IS ITTHAT ASTEROIDS COLLIDING WITH THE EARTH IS SO RARE?It's because the vast majority of the asteroids are not in orbits that cross the orbit of theEarth. 99.9% of the objects out there are safely between Jupiter and Mars and never getany closer than one Earth-Sun distance from the Earth. So, there is no threat ever. Thenthere is a very small percentage of them that cross the orbit of the Earth and those are theones we're concerned about and trying to find.WHAT CAUSES THEM TO CHANGE FROM THEIR SAFE ORBIT OUT BETWEENMARS AND JUPITER TO MAKING A COLLISION WITH THE EARTH?There are a couple or problems. One is that those objects are always colliding withthemselves and any time you have a collision, you can impart a little bit of energy into thepieces and sometimes that will alter the orbits enough such that they can approach, say,Mars. If they approach Mars closely, then there is a chance that their orbit will becomemore elongated and they can approach the Earth.\"More Information:How To Report An AsteroidIF A PROFESSIONAL ASTRONOMER OR AMATEUR ASTRONOMER FINDSSOMETHING THAT THEY THINK IS A NEAR-EARTH ASTEROID, WHAT IS THEPROCESS FOR COMMUNICATING TO YOU?The standard process is to get positional measurements on the sky and contact us at theMinor Planet Center, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Harvard University inCambridge, Massachusetts. We have a latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates system forthe sky and people send me the exact time, their location on Earth and those latitude andlongitude coordinates for the object. That comes to my desk and I decide whether or not Ithink it's a near-Earth asteroid. If so, then I post the information on our web page toencourage other observations which will allow us to refine the orbits.WHAT IS THAT E-MAIL ADDRESS AND WEBSITE?The e-mail address is: mpc@cfa.harvard.edu (Minor Planet Center at Center ForAstrophysics)We bsit e : http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/mpc.htmlHOW MANY REPORTS EVERY DAY OR WEEK DO YOU GET?In terms of Near-Earth Asteroid messages, we get a dozen a day. Those are dividedbetween new discoveries of near-Earth asteroids and follow-up observations for orbitrefinement. Once an object has been discovered, then we need more positionalmeasurements of the object and that helps for orbit refinement. So people know to look atour web page, in particular, the Near-Earth Asteroid Confirmation page. They'll makeobservations and e-mail them to my office and we work from there.1996 Toutatis Radar ExperimentNASA/JPL reports: \"The asteroid's 1996 approach was not as close as in 1992, andArecibo was unavailable (that telescope was being upgraded), but Goldstone was used forhigh-resolution imaging on nine straight dates. Toutatis's delay-Doppler signature wasqualitatively as expected from predictions based on the existing computer model. Imageslike the ones below have been used to refine the spin-state parameters and to produce ahigh-resolution shape model.
