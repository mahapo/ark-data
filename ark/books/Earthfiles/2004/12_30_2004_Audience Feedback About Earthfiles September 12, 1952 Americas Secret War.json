N.Lihue, Kauai, HawaiiAloha Linda,Tonight I was listening to you on Coast when I recalled an incident which happened in1951 while my Dad was stationed at the Millington Naval Air Station in Tennessee.Millington was in the middle of cotton fields then.My Dad was the Maintainance Officer at the Station. He came home from work one day,crying like a baby, which upset all in the family, since very rarely did we see our Fathercry.He told us about his best friend, a Navy pilot who we all knew since this man always madehome-made ice cream for us. His (Dad's) best friend had disappeared along with hisplane...completely disappeared after chasing a UFO near the Naval Base there inMillington.I was 12 at the time and had never heard the words UFO in my life.I remember asking my Dad what a UFO was and his only reply was that they were badpeople....so for many years growing up I just assumed UFOs were some kind of enemies ofthe U.S.I also remember my Dad being very sad and angry for about two weeks. He finally told usthat his friend and his plane were gone forever never to be found. After that shortconversation, my Dad never mentioned this incident again or his best friend.Sorry, I cannot remember the name of the pilot and my Dad has passed away.Love your site!!!Aloha nui loa,2) MoscowNews.com http://www.mosnews.com/news/2004/12/30/ufo.shtml\"Russia Joins Iran in Fighting UFO'sCreated: 30.12.2004Russia and Iran have agreed to a joint program studying the UFO phenomenon aftera series of sightings of unidentified flying objects.The two nations are stressing 'expansion of bilateral cooperation particularly inspace research and construction of satellites,' the Islamic Republic News Agencyreports. This comes in the wake of a skywatching mania that struck Iran amidstate-media reports of sightings of flying objects near Iran's nuclear installations.The Resalat news agency reported 'shining objects' in the sky near Natanz, whereIran's uranium-enrichment plant is situated. One of those objects is said to haveexploded, prompting 'panic in the region.' Tehran's air force was ordered to shoot down any unknown or suspicious flyingobjects in its airspace, amid security concerns for its nuclear plants. (Editor'semphasis.)'Flights of unknown objects in the country's airspace have increased in recentweeks... [they] have been seen over Bushehr and Isfahan provinces,' the Resalatdaily reported. Nuclear facilities are located in both provinces.The WorldNetDaily has reported UFO sightings in Iran in the past.\" 3) Pravda.ru http://english/pravda.ru/science/19/94/378/11873_UFO.html\"Soviet Army fought UFOs"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"01/23/2004English translation from original Russian Soviet military encountered many UFOs, maybe for this reason in the end of the1960s a secret laboratory of researching 'flying objects' was created in the USSR.UFO researchers often blame the military of hiding the cases of alien rockets anddisseminating false information of UFO. Army officers are not interested in thedisputes about alien civilizations, they are interested in knowing what impact UFOcan impose to military equipment and personnel.1947. Antiaircraft guns of Transcaucasian Military District fired on the flying cigar-shaped object which came from the side of the Turkish border. The object's flyingaltitude was below 4,000 meters, and the guns were capable of reaching a target atthe altitudes up to12,000 meters, but that time the fire made no harm to the 'cigar'.Then the cigar increased its speed and flew away over the mountains. This incident could cause much trouble, because earlier the border guards andmilitary ships monitoring service missed this target. Then the military was unable totrace this flying object over the country\"s territory. The Border District commandignored and ordered the monitors not to disclose the information that the objectreached a speed up to 2000 kilometers per hour.Similar case took place in 1984 in Turkestan Military District. Near the city ofAstrakhan air-defense system marked the ball-shaped object flying at the altitude of2000 meters along the Caspian seashore in the direction of the state border. Theobject did not respond to the inquiry made by the military on the radio. Two fighter-planes took off, but they were unable to bring the object down. After being underfire, the object descended to 100 meters, and at this low altitude the planes wereunable to continue firing. Despite being fired at, the object was having a regularspeed. The ball passed over several military units, which allowed to make its photo.Near the city of Krasnoyarsk the military tried to bring the object down with thehelicopter. However, it quickly increased its altitude so that the helicopter could notreach it. After firing all its supply of shells, the helicopter landed, and the ballabruptly flew in the direction of the sea and disappeared from the radar screens. In the same area the similar scenario case happened later. The object having theshape of cylinder demonstrated its invulnerability. Such a demonstration could bethe purpose of its flight, because this UFO was having a speed of 100 kilometers perhour.One can blame the military of inhuman actions on bringing down flying objects.(Editor's emphasis.) But what can they do if the object was moving in the directionof the state border and they had the order to destroy such objects? In 1985 near the town of Krasnovodsk the radar station under the command ofCaptain Valuev registered the disc-shaped object in size of 1,000 meters! The objectwas immovable, and some time later a small disc in size of 5 meters flew out of itand then landed on Krasnovodskaya spit. Patrol boats rushed to that area, but whenthey reached the distance of 100 meters from the object, it took off and flew onekilometer away. This happened five times. Then the object flew up at a huge speed,reached the bigger disc, which finally flew away spaceward.In the end of the 60s a secret laboratory of researching 'flying objects' was created inthe USSR. Among the laboratory\"s tasks was researching anti-gravitation, but theresearch results were made secret. Its testing area was near the town of KapustinYar on purpose. In the end of June of 1971 the military could see over this area ablack cigar-shaped flying object floating under the clouds at the altitude of 800meters. The object was 25 meters long and had about 3 meters in diameter. It hadneither stabilizers nor wings nor engines and was moving at the speed of 150kilometers per hour producing no noise.In 1978 ? Soviet Ministry of Defense accepted Network MO program. Specialmilitary unit in the town of Mytishi was in charge of collecting data, and newlyestablished 'space troops' were designated to fight possible threat from space. In the beginning of August 1987 five soldiers of Leningrad Military District went tothe North of Karelia region on a special mission. They were required to guard theobject of unknown origin. It was found on the territory of another military unit nearthe town of Vyborg. The item was 14 meters long, 4 meters wide, 2.5 meters high.The object had neither doors no hatches, and all attempts to open its hull wereunsuccessful. The military tried to break off some object parts, but were only ableto take some rods from its stern. In the end of September the object disappearedfrom the hangar without leaving a trace.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"4) K.G.London, Ontario, CanadaI was listening to your interview on coast to coast last night.When youwere talking about 1952, I thought of an incident in southwestern Ontario,Canada on Apr 21, 1952. It is reported in THE LONDON FREE PRESS on thatdate (London, Ontario, Canada). As the story goes, the Toronto airport reportedseeing a dark object emiting a vapour trail heading for London. Theycontacted the London Airport asking if they could see it. London confirmedthey saw the object and contacted the Detroit airport to tell them it washeading for them and they confirmed they had it in sight.This object wassaid to be traveling 2000 mph at 30,000 feet. It was chased by RCAF P-51Mustangs from a base at London. They probably had the closest look at this,but could not catch it (they could only go 450 mph at 25,000 feet). I firstnoticed this story in a book called UFOS OVER CANADA. Years later I found thestory on the internet in 1996 and checked the London paper and found thestory. It stated that the Canadian DND said it was a Canberra bomber beingflown to the US from England to be built under licence. ( Canberra bomberswere lucky to exceed 600 mph). This object was seen by thousands of people inSW Ontario because vapour trails were rare back then.What happened to it inthe US? Maybe you can find this out. Nothing in 1952 could fly that fast andthat far.More Information:Click cover to order The Braxton County Monster:The Cover-Up of the Flatwoods Monster Revealed © 2004 by Frank C.
