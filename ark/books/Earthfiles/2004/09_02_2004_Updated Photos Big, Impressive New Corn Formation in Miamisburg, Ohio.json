One excavating attemptin 1869 reduced the height to its present sixty-five feet. The mound was thenpartially investigated by means of a vertical shaft which extended from the top to thebase and connected with two horizontal tunnels. The exploration revealed one burialeight feet from the top containing a bark-covered skeleton and a vault twenty-eightfeet lower that was surrounded by logs but without a burial. Along the sides of thevertical shaft were found various layers of sand and stones implying that the moundwas built in several stages. The entire construction, however, has never beensystematically excavated. \"The conical shape, the types of burials, and the absence of associated earthworksindicate that the Miamisburg Mound was the work of Adena Indians, a prehistoricgroup that lived in the Ohio Valley between 1000 B.C. and 400 A.D. these peopleswere the first in this area to domesticate plants for food, to settle in fairly permanentvillages, and to make pottery. An important part of their way of life was the properburial of the dead in graves that were covered with earth mounds, such as this one.\" September 2, 2004 Miamisburg, Ohio - Tonight at 9 p.m. Eastern Time, Jeffrey Wilsoncalled me on his cell phone while standing in the middle of \"the most impressive cornformation\" he has ever seen. Yesterday he received a phone call from a Columbus, Ohio,resident who heard there was a large crop pattern in Miamisburg. Jeff is Director of theIndependent Crop Circle Researchers Association (ICCRA) and two of his members - TedRobertson and Doug McElwain - got to Miamisburg, but could not find the pattern fromthe ground. So, they got a plane and quickly saw the large formation in tall corn in a fieldnot far from downtown Miamisburg. Late this afternoon, Jeff Wilson also got to see thepattern from the air and took photographs. Tomorrow I will update this report with theICCRA aerial and ground photographs from Jeff, Ted and Doug.Interview by Cell Phone with Jeff Wilson from Miamisburg, OhioFormation: Large 8-foot-tall corn field in Miamisburg, Ohio, bordered on two sides by residential developments.Aerial photograph © 2004 by Jeffrey Wilson.Above and below: Miamisburg, Ohio, pattern in 8-foot-tall corn reported on September 1, 2004."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Length is 222 feet. Compare to the Serpent Mound, Ohio, pattern of 2003 below. Note the two \"grape shot\"small circles and \"rectangle\" outside the main formation, similar to so many crop formations in England.Aerial photographs © 2004 by Jeffrey Wilson.Measurement update from Jeff Wilson on September 3, 2004:Total length = 222 feet.Largest circle diameter = 124 feet.Smallest two outer circles beyond main pattern -Eastern circle (bottom left) diameter = 14 ft. 6 inches.Western smallest circle diameter = 11 feet.Vesica Pisces \"Eye\" = 56 feet long;Vesica inner circle diameter = 15 feet.Central downed circle diameter = 40 feet.Jeffrey Wilson, Director, Independent Crop Circle Researchers Association(ICCRA), Cincinnati, Ohio: \"We don't know how long it's been down. My first estimationis at least seven days old because there is some plant recovery that has taken place. Someof the stalks are starting to come back up. But it is by far the most impressive in terms ofits lay of any corn circle formation that I've ever been to not just from the sheer size of it,but the way the corn is laid down in curves.THE IMPLICATION IS THAT IF THERE ARE A LOT OF CURVES IN THE LAY, THESTIFF CORN STALKS WOULD HAVE TO HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO SOME KINDOF HEAT ENERGY IN ORDER FOR IT TO SOFTEN AND CURVE?Yes. The smaller circles definitely have a curve to them. The way the circle was made, thestalks actually curve around inside the circle. So, it's not as if they are just laid flat in theapproximation of a circle. They are actually curved to make a circle.Jeffrey Wilson reports: \"The corn stalks in the formation w ere found lying flat to the ground,but unbroken without any scuff marks on any stalks discovered (no mechanical damage discovered so far.)A modest amount of photo/gravi-tropism recovery has taken place, leading us to believe that the formationis at least a week old, and possibly older. The stalks in the smallest circles are curved to make thecentral sw irl of the lay. Each of the circles has a single, standing stalk of corn left in the center.\"Photograph © 2004 by Jeffrey Wilson."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Miamisburg, Ohio 2004 Reminiscentof Serpent Mound, Ohio 2003WHAT KIND OF PATTERN IS THIS?It has design elements of the Serpent Mound formation from last year. There is an 'eye,' soto speak (Vesica Pisces).Soybean farmer discovered this pattern on August 17, 2003, near the ancient Serpent Moundin Locust Grove, Ohio. \"Eye\" is the Vesica Pisces created by overlapping circles.Aerial photograph © 2003 by Jeffrey Wilson and Roger Sugden.Then there is sort of like a nested crescent up above that, very similar to the SerpentMound formation. Then, there is a series of circles in alignment with that. All the singlecircles have standing corn in the centers of them. I have to say that the corn is about 8 feettall at its maximum point, so for somebody to stand out here with a rope and try tomaneuver around without damaging any of the corn that is standing is a pretty impressivefeat if they could pull that off.Don't really see any broken stalks. The stuff is laid down pretty flat to the ground, prettygently. A lot of the stalks are pulled out at the roots, but there aren't any abrasion marksthat we can see so far on the stalks.\"Veil-like effects were noted in the adjacent sections of the corn formation- with a section of stalks only 3-deep left standing in this photograph.\"Photograph © 2004 by Jeffrey Wilson. Corn Field Near Miamisburg Residential Area"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Jeffrey Wilson: \"The formation is not aligned with the rows of corn in the fieldor with center of the Miamisburg conical mound, but is 'offset' by about 30 degrees.Aerial photograph © 2004 by Ted Robertson.YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SOMETHING THAT LARGE NEAR TOWN WOULDHAVE BEEN SEEN AND REPORTED BY PILOTS.Right, but for some reason it wasn't reported to us until yesterday. But, the MiamisburgNews newspaper printed a story today on the front page with a headline asking, 'Did AliensVisit Miamisburg?' So, somebody else apparently saw and reported the formation to thenewspaper.HOW BIG IS THE CORN FIELD?I'd say it's probably in length about .4 miles, maybe half a mile. Width is probably a goodquarter-mile across.SO IT'S A PRETTY BIG CORN FIELD.Yes, and you cannot see it from the road. It's near the back of the field I would say three-quarters of the way into the field. Ted and Doug McElwain both drove around and aroundlooking for this and could not find it because it was so hidden. You can't see this patternfrom anywhere around the edge of the field. It was difficult to figure out where in the fieldit was because when you are standing on the ground, if you climbed up on something, youcan't really see it. It's really only visible from the air. There is nothing at all around it thatwould give you any perspective of this formation.IN TERMS OF NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST AXIS, WHAT IS THE POSITION OFTHIS PATTERN?I haven't measured it yet, but my guess is that it's probably aligned east/west.IT'S 120 MILES AT LEAST FROM THE SERPENT MOUND LAST YEAR?Yes, around that.HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO SEE IF ANY OF THE NODES SHOW EXPULSIONS OROTHER CHANGES?No. There doesn't appear to be any. I've looked at quite a few stalks and there doesn't seemto be any exploded nodes or anything like that at this point.WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT IS SO ANOMALOUS IS THAT FLUIDITYOF THE LAY IN CORN THAT WOULD BE THE MOST OUTSTANDING ANOMALYAT THIS POINT?Ye s . Field Investigation InstrumentsGIVE ME A LIST OF THE METERS YOU ARE GOING TO USE IN THE FORMATION?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"1) Tri-Field Natural Electromagnetic Meter, which filters out manmade electromagneticsources and only picks up natural sources. It picks up electric field strength, magnetic fieldstrength and radio and microwave emissions.2) Broadband Meter, which has a wider spectrum in which it receives. That is alsomeasuring magnetic fields, electric fields and radio microwave emissions.3) Gamma Scout Geiger Counter which right now is set to detect gamma only. We'repicking up somewhere around .18 to .24 micro-Sieverts per hour of radioactivity, which isprobably above the background level. It's a European standard that has been used in thepast few years to measure the affect of radiation on biological activity. It's sort of a newmeasure.\"Editor's Note: 1 sievert (Sv) = 100 remThe International System of Units Radiation Measurements: Radioactivity Absorbed DoseDose Equivalent ExposureCommon Units = curie (Ci) rad rem roentgen (R)SI Units = becquerel (Bq) gray (Gy) sievert (Sv) coulomb/kilogram (C/kg)\"We will double check that out here, but normally the background is anywhere from .09 to.11. So we could be measuring close to double the background, which would be significant.WHAT COULD CAUSE THAT?That's a good question. There are very few gamma sources besides cosmic rays and stuffbeing emitted from the sun and stellar sources. There are only a handful of natural gammaemitters that are on the ground and not too many in the sense they don't have a half life ofa billion years or something like that. There are probably less than a dozen that have a halflife of something we'd be looking at here. I can't speculate any further about what thatsource might be. Any Other Crop Formations in Miamisburg Region?IN RELATIONSHIP TO ANY PATTERNS LAST YEAR, IS THIS CLOSE TO ANY OFTHEM LAST YEAR GEOGRAPHICALLY?No, I can't think of any. There hasn't been a formation in this part of Ohio that I'verecorded. There was a formation up near Lima, Ohio back in 1999, which is probablyanother 60 to 70 miles north of here (Miamisburg).Oh, look the Miamisburg Fire Department has put their spotlight out for us. They havebeen quite cooperative with us. The department has the land right adjacent to the cornfield. They put up their ladder and a giant spotlight shining over the field so we would havesome light.I'M CURIOUS IF THERE HAS BEEN ANY DOWNED CROP IN THAT AREABEFORE?I don't know. This area around the Mound has gotten a lot of development over the past 6to 8 years. The last time I visited the Miamisburg mound was in 1996. At that time, therewere just farm fields surrounding the whole mound except towards the city. Now, there area lot of housing subdivisions that have gone up around the mound. In fact, directly behindthis field in between the mound and the field is a new housing development. Althoughthere is a line of trees that separates that development from this formation.HAS THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HEARD OF A SIMILAR REPORT OF DOWNEDCROP BEFORE?No, they've never seen anything like it.\"More to come - Latest stunning evidence from Hillsboro, Ohio, corn formation.Websites:http://www.cropcirclenews.comhttp://www.cropcircleconnector.com"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"http://www.cccrn.ca/http://thecropcirclewebsite.50megs.comhttp://www.cropcircleresearch.comhttp://www.bltresearch.com/http://home.clara.net/lucypringlehttp://www.bertjanssen.nlhttp://www.dcca.nlhttp://www.invisiblecircle.dehttp://www.temporarytemples.co.ukhttp://www.swirlednews.comhttp://www.heramagazine.nethttp://members.iinet.net.au/~bwratten/ccc.htmlhttp://www.CropCircleAnswers.comhttp://www.busty-taylor.com/cropper/98busty2.htmhttp://www.cropcircleconnector.com/ilyes/ilyes.htmlhttp://ufo.internauci.plhttp://www.wylatowo.mogilno.plhttp://www.wylatowo.mogilno.pl/news.php?art=94Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
