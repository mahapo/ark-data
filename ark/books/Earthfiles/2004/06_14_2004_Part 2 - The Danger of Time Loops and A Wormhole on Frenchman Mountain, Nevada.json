Thorne. Previous Part 1 June 14, 2004 Las Vegas, Nevada - On the May 30, 2004, field trip to the Vishnu SchistGreat Unconformity east of Las Vegas, Dan Burisch, Ph.D., microbiologist, hypothesizedthat perhaps one of the reasons the life-programming ganesh particles were at theFrenchman Mountain site was because he and his colleagues had also discovered anEinstein-Rosen Bridge (ERB) wormhole there on the mountain which might have originallytransported the ganesh particles from Somewhere Else in the universe. With Dr. Burisch was his work colleague, Marcia A. McDowell, who was in charge of theERB investigation at Frenchman Mountain. What she told us about the wormhole waschilling and those dangers are reinforced by theoretical physicist and mathematician,Stephen Hawking, in his 2001 book, The Universe In A Nutshell. The Danger of Time Travelby Stephen Hawking \"Time travel is possible in a region of spacetime in which there are time loops, pathsthat move at less than the speed of light but which nevertheless manage to comeback to the place and time they started because of the warping of spacetime. Since Ihave assumed there were no time loops in the distant past, there must be what I call atime travel 'horizon,' the boundary separating the region of time loops from the regionwithout them. \"Time travel horizons are rather like black hole horizons. While a black hole horizonis formed by light rays that just miss falling into the black hole, a time travel horizonis formed by light rays on the verge of meeting up with themselves. I then take as mycriterion for a time machine what I call a finitely generated horizon that is, a horizonthat is formed by light rays that all emerge from a bounded region. In other words,they don't come in from infinity or from a singularity, but originate from a finiteregion containing time loops the sort of region our advanced civilization (of time"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"travelers) is supposed to create. Stephen Hawking's artistic rendition of an alien time machine in which an ERB wormhole on the leftwould be used for rapid transportation point-to-point around the universe. Page 143,The Universe In A Nutshell © 2001 by Stephen Hawking. \"In adopting this definition as the footprint of a time machine, we have the advantageof being able to use the machinery that Roger Penrose and I developed to studysingularities and black holes. Even without using the Einstein equations, I can showthat in general, a finitely generated horizon will contain a light ray that actually meetsup with itself -that is, a light ray that keeps coming back to the same point over andover again. Each time the light came around it would be more and more blue-shifted,so the images would get bluer and bluer. The wave crests of a pulse of light will getcloser and closer together and the light will get around in shorter and shorter intervalsof its time. In fact, a particle of light would have only a finite history, as defined byits own measure of time, even though it went around and around in a finite regionand did not hit a curvature singularity. Does spacetime admit timelike curves that are closed, returningto their starting point again and again, repeating cycles in time?Page 139, The Universe In A Nutshell © 2001 by Stephen Hawking. \"One might not care if a particle of light completed its history in a finite time. But Ican also prove that there would be paths moving at less than the speed of light thathad only finite duration. These could be the histories of observers who would betrapped in a finite region before the horizon and would go around and around fasterand faster until they reached the speed of light in a finite time. So if a beautiful alienin a flying saucer invites you into her time machine, step with care. You might fallinto one of these trapped repeating histories of only finite duration.\"\"These could be the histories of observers who would be trapped in a finite regionbefore the (timeline) horizon and would go around and around faster and faster until they reachedthe speed of light in a finite time. ...You might fall into one of these trapped repeating histories of"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"only finite duration.\" Page 144, The Universe In A Nutshell © 2001 by Stephen Hawking. Further, Dr. Hawking asks, \"Could an advanced civilization go back and change the past?\"He writes that theoretically it is now possible that \"space time could be warped so muchthat you could go off in a spaceship and come back before you set out. One way this couldhappen is if there were wormholes, tubes of spacetime that connect different regions ofspace and time. The idea is that you steer your spaceship into one mouth of the wormholeand come out of the other mouth in a different place and at a different time. Wormholes, ifthey exist, would be the solution to the speed limit (of light) in space: it would take tens ofthousands of years to cross the galaxy in a spaceship that traveled at less than the speed oflight, as relativity demands. But you might go through a wormhole to the other side of thegalaxy and be back in time for dinner. However, one can show that if wormholes exist, youcould also use them to get back before you set out.\" \"If there was a wormhole with its two ends close together,you could walk through the wormhole and come out at the same time\" that you left - or even before!Page 136, The Universe In A Nutshell © 2001 by Stephen Hawking. Interview:Wormhole and Creature Transportation at Frenchman Mountain, NevadaDan Burisch, Ph.D., Microbiologist: \"There was an extremely negative event boy, doesthat put it mildly! right behind you (the rock Linda Howe was sitting on). In fact, when Iwas filming the event, I was sitting on that large rock. It happened right there.We got an unexpected electromagnetic surge and this happened on July 20, 2001 (twomonths after first ganesh particle flare of green light) we got an unexpectedelectromagnetic surge. It was caused because I added too much energy to the rock and wasalso trying to magnify the biophotonic bursts with the use of a Class 3 laser.I started literally feeling as though I was sinking into the rock. Started feeling like I wasgraying out, ready to pass out sinking down into the rock which is probably the gauss levelsas they were going up and did not know at the time that there was an event actually withinthe equipment. We only discovered that there was an event that something looked like ithad poked its head up - something that looked very strangely grey alien-type shape - pokedits head up and was looking back at the world around us. Or maybe it was just an image.We don't know. We only found this out days after when we were re-running the videotape(Dan took) and it was at the very end of the tape. As I was shutting equipment down I wasbeing warned to shut the equipment down via radio and I shut the equipment down just atthe time that this thing was popping out, if you will.WAS THE CREATURE COMING OUT OF A ROUND HOLE IN THE AIR?Let me describe what the equipment looked like. It was a rectangular solid with a crystalquartz suspended in a gel with a laser plummeting the crystal. Electricity was added to thegel and the amperage was increased. All of a sudden, we got an electromagnetic burst fromit setting here. The bottom of this equipment was setting in contact with the ground.Through the disc that we had positioned - which was like a lens so that we could see whatwas going on underneath through the disk is where this thing emerged.WAS IT A J-ROD OR SOMETHING ELSE?I don't know what it was. We've got nice pictures of it, nice freeze frames of it.IT REMINDS ME OF WHAT HAPPENED IN UTAH WITH THE NIDS RANCH(National Institute of Discovery Science), BIGELOW'S RANCH.

But where it would have ended up if we had keptthe equipment running? I don't know. But I think we were looking at an image(holographic?).DAN, WAS THIS A WORMHOLE LINK? AN ERB?This was an emission of energy that resulted in that data, seeing something that appeared tobe from Elsewhere.\"\"Shadow beings\" step from \"hole\" that opened up in the middle of teenagerLinda Porter's room in 1961 near Covina, California, with a J-Rod type entity standing nearby.Drawing by Linda Porter for Linda Moulton Howe's book Glimpses of Other Realities,Volumes I and II. See Earthfiles shop.Dense Worm Holes in 2012?DO YOU THINK WE'RE STILL GOING TOWARD A DENSE AREA OF WORMHOLESIN 2012?We're headed toward a dense area, yes. (But even on Earth now) these things (manmadeERB machines) could, theoretically, if they were allowed to spread, be sold, traded orwhatever, they could theoretically be spread throughout the globe. And that in fact is whatI understood is one of the events of a catastrophism timeline because they would be spreadthroughout the globe or throughout a large region of the globe. They would then activate(by the dense patch of cosmic worm holes) and we would be in trouble!THEY WOULD ACTIVATE BY WORMHOLES?They would activate by the natural energy coming from the wormholes and also, whatwould happen is that once they would activate, they would draw more energy in. At thattime in December 2012, there is going to be a fairly large burst from the sun. The nature ofthe burst, I'm not exactly sure because that's not my thing. But that, coupled by theactivation of the star gates would be enough to do the majority of the human population in.WOULD IT SE T OFF A SKY FIRE ?However it happens, I think so, yes. I'm aware that there would be a great tectonicmovement. Essentially, there would be a geological pole shift, as well as the magnetic one.The magnetic one is taken care of from the solar wind.\" Implications of the Lotus Project Discoveries at Frenchman MountainWOULD THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THAT PROGRAMMING IN THE SILICONDIOXIDES HELP THE J-RODS?One faction of the J-Rods (referred to as \"rogue\") thought that it would and hence, used itas a power chip for a signature for the T-9 Treaty (a treaty between the U.S. and the J-Rodssigned between May 15 to June 8, 2004.)

Once they accessed the Yellow Book, they saw what implicationsit could bring for their future. That was disaster (for them) because they would literally betouching something they should not be touching. So, they stepped back from it, from what Ihear. But that's only what I've been told.AND THAT WHICH THEY WOULD TOUCH WOULD BE WHAT?The fruit of the Tree of Life. From this Lotus Model theory, one can access by direct datathe 27 spheres, or the 27 blue apples, which compose the Metatron's Cube. From there, allof the Platonic solids can be emerged. If you can properly modulate that which can be donewith the (Lotus) model, then you can literally create life. And that's not for us to do.\" Metatron's Cube and Platonic SolidsMetatron's Cube drawn by Charles Gilchrist.Metatron's Cube contains all the mathematical relationships in the Tree of Life and the fivePlatonic Solids that the ancient Greek philosopher, Plato, described in his Timaeus as thebuilding blocks of the matter world.

A key is to comprehend geometry as a universal language - perhaps the cosmiclanguage - that describes the smallest to the largest in this universe, both at seen and unseenlevels. Underlying everything are mathematical rules of construction that define how matterand energy unfold and evolve.Writer Nigel Pennick wrote in his 1994 book, Sacred Geometry, Symbolism and Purposein Religious Structures, \"Because geometry is an image of the structure of the cosmos, itcan readily be used as a symbolic system for understanding various features of theuniverse. ...Since the earliest times, geometry has been inseparable from magic. Even themost archaic rock-scribings are geometrical in form. These hint at a notational andinvocational system practiced by some ancient priesthood. Because the complexities andabstract truths expressed by geometrical forms could only be explained as reflections of theinnermost truths of the world, they were held to be sacred mysteries of the highest orderand were shielded from the eyes of the profane (general public).\"Continued in Part 3 - People Disappeared in ERB on Frenchman MountainMore Information:Albert Einstein, Nathan Rosen and Einstein-Rosen Bridges In his classic book, A Brief History of Time © 1988 and 1996, Stephen Hawking wrote: \"In 1935, Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen wrote a paper in which they showedthat general relativity allowed what they called \"bridges,\" but which are now knownas wormholes.

To do this, or to warp space-time in any other way so as topermit time travel, one can show that one needs a region of space-time with negativecurvature, like the surface of a saddle. Ordinary matter, which has a positive energydensity, gives space-time a positive curvature, like the surface of a sphere. So, whatone needs in order to warp space-time in a way that will allow travel into the past, ismatter with negative energy density.

He is 40 years old now, born on February 2, 1964. His birthcertificate name was Danny B (no period) Crain. I have met and talked with his mother,Dodie Crain, and with Dan who confirm the name change and reason for it.Copy of Danny B Crain (aka Dan Burisch) \"Certificate of Live Birth\" at 4:28 a.m. on February 2, 1964,in St. Francis Hospital in Lynwood, California - a suburb of Los Angeles. Birth certificate provided by\"Dodie\" Crain.In 1990, Dan married Deborah Kay Burisch who had a child from a previous marriage.Five years later in 1995, Dan legally changed his last name from Crain to Burisch to matchthe child's legal last name.In 1989, as Dan Crain graduated from SUNY Stonybrook with a Ph.D. in Microbiology andMolecular Genetics, Dan was at the same time employed by the U. S. Navy's DOD NavalResearch Laboratory. His rank was Captain and his title Microbiologist IV.In 1994, he was assigned to work in an underground laboratory at S-4/5 at Area 51, fivefloors under the Papoose Mountain installation at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The fifth floor isaccessible only by one secure elevator. Dr. Burisch told me that in the year 1994, he suitedup in the fifth floor underground laboratory like an astronaut with breathing and urinationhoses. His assignment was to enter a round \"clean sphere\" filled with a cold atmosphere of4% by volume hydrogen, argon and other gases. Inside the clean sphere was an entityoriginally called \"extraterrestrial\" by his government superiors and later described as a\"time traveler\" from 50,000 years in the future. According to Dr. Burisch, his boss reportedto a MAJI committee, an extension of the Majestic-12 Special Studies Group organized byPresident Harry S. Truman in 1947. Majestic 12 included top scientific, military andbusiness leaders asked to study the extraterrestrial phenomenon.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"earthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
