January 31, 2004 Darmstadt, Germany - The European Space Agency's MarsExpress Orbiter has been exploring the red planet from 186 miles (300kilometers) altitude. Its high resolution stereo camera has been sending backextraordinary color images. Some, like the Gusev crater image above, showgreen areas. Some like the Reull Vallis ancient river channel below show blueand blue-green regions.

Could any of the blue and green colors indicate current moisture? The MarsExpress camera and OMEGA infrared spectrometer confirmed a lot of water iceat the South Pole on January 18, 2004, and the Spirit and Opportunity roversare looking for further soil and rock evidence of water - past and present. What causes the green, blue and blue-green colors in the Martian geography?Current scientific speculation includes mineral deposits, soil moisture andmaybe even algae. I called the European Space Agency in Darmstadt, Germany,this week and asked ESA Flight Operations Director, Michael McKay, how longit would take for the instruments on Mars Express to have more answers. Interviews: Michael McKay, Flight Operations Director, European Space Agency,Darmstadt, Germany: \"It's a very good question. When you look at thesepictures, there are so many images it evokes of our own planet, Earth, andactually with our own perception of vegetation and what it looks like or possiblesigns of life. I think it's up to Spirit to have a look (in the Gusev crater) and togive us more conclusive evidence because from several hundred kilometers, youcan draw only so many conclusions. But certainly like the green in the Gusev crater picture or by looking at thedevelopment of darker spots toward the South Pole which are tied to seasonalvariations, it certainly gives rise to the speculation that there could be algae. Could Colors and Dark Spots Be Living Algae?Also, the fact that there is water ice in that South Pole region - maybe some ofthe dark spots in craters that have been discussed in some of the scientific paperscould possibly be algae. The water ice discovery adds a bit more evidence andweight to that theory.WHAT YOU MEAN IS THAT THERE MIGHT BE GREENISH COLOR ORBLUISH-COLORED ALGAE ON MARS BECAUSE THERE IS PRESENCEOF H2O?It certainly gives much more weight to such speculation, particularly since hereon the Earth's glaciers and the Alps and the North Pole, you can see algae in theice itself which turns rather a pink color or greeny-grey color. Just tying thatobservation on the Earth together with things we are starting to see on Mars,certainly adds a bit more weight and people will seriously be thinking aboutthese questions and trying to put some definite answers to them.AND FINDING ALGAE WOULD CERTAINLY BE FINDING LIFE!It's a big question that we as a human race ask ourselves: are we the only planetin the entire universe that supports life? It would question so many things on a"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"theological basis, on a religious basis, on a perspective of what are we as humanbeings? It goes through the whole fiber of our own perception of what we are asthe human race. Just to find life somewhere else on another planet would be soearth-shattering.DO YOU THINK ALGAE DOWN IN THE REULL VALLIS RIVER CHANNELMIGHT EXPLAIN THE DARK BLUE-GREEN COLOR?I hate to disappoint you, but my money is on that it's just a different mineralfrom either bedrock that has been exposed or perhaps depositing of mineralsthat have been washed out in that region. I think it is a very local type ofphenomenon feature. My money (on sites that could have water and algae)would be more on the dark rings that vary with seasonal variations to perhaps bea sort of algae. Lots of Water Ice At the Martian South PoleWhat really astounded us was that the Martian South Pole had the watersignature so clearly and confirmed directly that this was water (ice).Before with Odyssey and Mars Global Surveyor, they had seen neutral hydrogenatoms which comes from water. We'd already seen water in the atmosphere andalso with the temperature measurements made by Odyssey, they could seedifferent layers of temperature on the South Pole and some of it was muchwarmer than dry ice. But it appeared white in the pictures. So the question was:How could we have dry ice, carbon dioxide, at this temperature? It's impossible.Could it possibly be water? So there have been many elements pointing to saythere is water on the South Pole. And there were papers released in January andFebruary in 2003 speculating that and giving evidence for it. But with the MarsExpress OMEGA instrument flying over it, we get the real fingerprint. We getthe evidence that can't be disputed. There is water on the South Pole - and thereis a lot of it.Over the next weeks, we'll be flying over different swaths. We had some comingin this morning. Tomorrow we also do another over-flight and the next weekanother one which would give us a complete mapping of the South Pole so wecan estimate how much water there is actually on the South Pole.It's also important to other models because we have been looking at theatmosphere of Mars and looking at the past and thinking: is there enough carbondioxide on Mars alone that it could have been a greenhouse effect so that itcould have been warm and wet once on this planet? And the fact that a largepart of the south polar cap is now water and not carbon dioxide gives scientistsaround the world another element of the puzzle so they can start thinking aboutwhat is the history of Mars? How could it have evolved, particularly when wedon't have as much carbon dioxide as we originally thought.IN THE DATA FROM THE MARS EXPRESS ABOUT THE SOUTH POLECONTAINING WATER ICE, COULD THE QUANTITY THAT IS LOCKED UPTHERE EXPLAIN ALL OF THE ANCIENT RIVER CHANNELS?I think the quantities we see there are probably what is left from the (past)water. There is other speculation that under the surface of Mars, there isprobably a lot more water ice locked up. Some of the peculiar features that havebeen seen by Spirit and Opportunity are indicating that maybe there issomething there already just below the surface. Mars Express Radar Will Penetrate from Surfaceto 3 Miles Underground Looking for Water on MarsWe're flying onboard the European Space Agency's Mars Express mission aradar that will look 5 kilometers below the surface (3 miles). Not 5 meters -"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"everyone thinks I'm making a mistake when I say 5 kilometers - but it's 5kilometers underground looking for locked up water, underground lakes, rivers,oceans even, glaciers and permafrost. This will really be a key to identifyingwhere the water is on Mars underground and also to do a complete mapping ofit over the Martian surface, or under the Martian surface, I should say.HOW LONG WILL IT BE BEFORE THAT DATA IS IN?The radar is not deployed yet. It's the last instrument. Everything else has beenswitched on in Mars Express and performing beautifully. The radar itself won'tcome on until April and we will start getting results back in May. The firstcapabilities to see below the surface and see what this radar can do, naturally it'salso dependent on the surface that it's trying to penetrate whether it gets downto the 5 kilometers.This is a very international collaboration for the exploration of Mars and wework very closely with our NASA and JPL colleagues and we rely very heavilyfor many aspects of our mission. And we also have cross-support. This week wewill be contacting Spirit and Opportunity through the Mars Express spacecraftand also delivering them commands from NASA through the European SpaceAgency's spacecraft onto the surface. They have also been looking for the Beagle2 lander that we delivered there on Christmas Day. It is really an internationaland extremely cooperative exploration of Mars and the results from all of thesemissions are really for the human race and not just for national consumption. \"Muddy-Looking\" Lander TracksSoon after the January 3, 2004, landing of the Spirit rover in the Gusev crater on Mars,the first color images from Spirit's panoramic camera showed darker-colored air bag tracks.These compressionsin the soil were made when the air bags were deflated and retractedafter landing.Is it moisture? Electrostatic charge?

Credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell.WILL YOUR RADAR STUDIES PERHAPS SHED SOME LIGHT ON WHERETHE LANDERS CAME DOWN ON BOTH SIDES OF THE PLANET, THETRACKS LOOK MUDDY. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THERE IS MOISTURE INTHOSE SOILS?Certainly, people have speculated that just below the surface of Mars, there is apermafrost and there is water frozen just below the surface. Why not - mightthere have been slurry in that particular region, a mud patch where the waterdrained below the surface? This is one of the things that the radar will belooking at where the water is below the surface. And perhaps from that, we cansee where it's actually come from and give more support to the theory of amuddy area where Spirit has touched down.DO YOU THINK IT'S JUST AS LIKELY THAT MOISTURE COULDEXPLAIN THOSE SEEMINGLY MUDDY STRANGE TRACKS AS ONE OFTHE OTHER SPECULATIONS THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOMEELECTROSTATIC PHENOMENON IN THE SOIL?What a lot of scientists do, rather than jumping to theories, is they look to seewhat other explanation can I find to explain the phenomenon that I see. Andrather than going with a very narrow-minded idea that it can only be mud, Ithink it's correct to open one's mind to other possibilities and then try toeliminate them by observation or direct measurement. So, I would be delightedthat it is and that there are larger quantities of water which I think would haveresulted in creating the large Grand Canyon, Valles Marinaris, its shape. Andalso the very flat and deep ocean beds that we believe are on the NorthernHemisphere of Mars. They are very, very flat and have obviously been protectedin that part of the planet's surface from meteorite impact because it has very fewcraters.If those Northern Hemisphere low regions are two kilometers below the averagesurface of Mars, then it would look like there has been a huge quantity of water- not just what could exist on the South Pole, but there must have been a hugequantity of fluid or ice there before. The big question is: Where is it? Whopulled the plug on the oceans on Mars? And is that water or fluid locked upsomewhere just below the planet's surface?With the radar, those are the kinds of questions we hope to answer and bring thewhole understanding of the Mars atmosphere, surface and sub-surface to a betterconclusion.WHEN WILL YOU BE LOOKING WITH THE OMEGA SPECTROMETER,SAY DOWN IN THE REULL VALLIS ANCIENT MARTIAN RIVERCHANNEL AND THE GUSEV CRATER TO SEE IF YOU DO PICK UP"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"WAT E R T H E R E ?I don't know when we're going to be over-flying them - certainly not within thenext weeks. We are also coming into the 'eclipse season' on Mars Express andwe have several operations we have to prepare and the payload will be broughtto a lower level before we can resume them again, during and after the eclipses.The exact plans are being discussed at the moment between many differentscientists: what are the priorities? What do we need to get done? At the moment,we have a very high data rate due to the close proximity between Mars andEarth and this is growing every day and consequently, the data rate will startstepping down. So they are trying to find what are the most scientificallymeaningful measurements to make with the over-flights we have and focus onthose first.WHEN YOU SAY 'ECLIPSE SEASON,' WHAT DO YOU MEAN EXACTLY?It means that the orbit of Mars Express takes the spacecraft behind Mars so thatMars occults the sun and we don't get enough power on the solar arrays tosustain full operations through the whole orbit. Consequently, we have to do abit more power management and not operate everything as if we had fullsunlight and fully charged batteries.HOW LONG DOES THAT LAST?That will last until March and following that, we will perform the radardeployment.\" What Color is the Martian Sky?NASA Spirit rover team leaders at NASA/Jet Propulsion Lab press conference, Pasadena,California,in first week of January 2004, show first panorama camera scenes of Gusev crater landingsite taken by theSpirit rover.

This sky, same time as NASA press conference at JPL, is pink.Image credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell University.Soon after the Spirit rover landed in the Gusev crater on January 3, 2004, NASAheld a press conference at the Jet Propulsion headquarters in Pasadena,California. On television, behind the scientists who spoke, there was a largeblow-up from Spirit's panorama camera that showed light brown ground and atthe horizon a pale blue sky, not pink. That's when the internet was abuzz withquestions about what exactly is the color of the Martian sky?This week I posed that question to both Michael McKay and a Mars atmosphereexpert from France who is working with the European Space Agency. He is Dr.Jean-Loup Bertaux, Director of Atmospheric Research for CNRS. I asked him ifthe Martian sky could ever look blue like the Earth's sky if we were standing onMars?Interview:Jean-Loup Bertaux, Ph.D., Director of Research, Service d'Aeronomie duCNRS, Verrieres-le-Buisson, France: \"Well, I would assume no, really. Asyou know on the Earth, the blue of the sky is due to scattering by air moleculeswhich takes scattering all the photons from the sun. But these molecules of airare scattering better the blue part of the spectrum of the sun than the red part.But in the atmosphere of Mars, what is dominating the color of the sky is thepresence of dust particles. And when there are dust particles on Earth, they looka little bit red. The thing is confusing because sometimes you see the Sun whichis setting down and you see red. That is the same effect because the air betweenyour eye and the sun has diffracted the blue light from the beam, so what yousee remaining is the red of the sun.So to have a sky with reddish color, you would need to have particles and that iswhat is happening on Mars.But your question is not trivial. In the Martian atmosphere is plenty of dust, upto maybe 50 kilometers of altitude, and so you would see exactly the color ofthat dust. And in my mind, it could not be really blue, I would think.But I think it is a very important question. And in fact it is not a triviality. I thinkit should be asked to NASA: is this the true color (of the sky)? I think it is veryimportant. The sky color might change with the quantity of dust particles in theair. Sometimes they may be red or less red, depending upon mainly the size ofthe dust particles. There might be a lot of very fine dust grains that might have aslightly different color from the big grains, I would say. So, the question is nottrivial. It is important and it is interesting that the public is asking such aquestion.SO, IF I AM UNDERSTANDING, IT SOUNDS LIKE THE SKY ON MARSCOULD CHANGE A GREAT DEAL FROM MAYBE EVEN A LIGHT BLUETO A DARK PINKISH-RED, DEPENDING UPON THE AMOUNT OF DUST"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"IN THE ATMOSPHERE AT ANY PLACE IN ANY GIVEN TIME?That is, I think, a fair statement, yes.\"Michael McKay, ESA, Darmstadt, Germany: \"I do not know what processingwas used in producing the pictures. Sometimes the color received from suchcameras needs to be calibrated to ensure it's true color. Or they can be using adifferent color mapping for each of the values in the picture to try to accentuatefeatures that they are seeing in the soil so you can get a better contrast betweenthe different elements that you are looking at. So unfortunately, I don't knowwhat they have actually used and I couldn't comment on the trueness of the bluesky or the pink sky. But certainly in previous pictures we know that because ofthe red dust on Mars that is often quite scattered in the atmosphere, you will seea redness in the sky.\"Dust Fall\" in Albor Tholus Volcanic Caldera Caldera of Albor Tholus, a volcano in the Elysium region. On the far left of the caldera'srim,light colored dust is falling like a water fall. The caldera has a diameter of 30 kilometers (18miles)and a depth of 3 kilometers (1.8 miles). Image by European Space Agency'sMars Express: ESA/DLR/FU Berlin (G. Neukum).Relating to dust on Mars, the 3-dimensional picture that really impresses me isthe one of the volcano crater showing a dust storm coming up on the side of thecrater and just falling with dust - much like a waterfall, we have a 'dust-fall' onthe surface of Mars. You can see that it's coming off the side of the volcaniccrater. It's actually a caldera that it's falling into. If you look in the picture, it'son the top left hand side - you can see just before the rim a smudge that lookslike it could be a small dust storm or stirring of dust by the atmosphere beingpushed up along the hill and just seeing it falling off the rim onto the volcanocrater bed. The bottom of that caldera - you think wow! Dust is so small, butwhen there is a lot of it, you see the features in the resolution we have on thiscamera.IT IMPRESSES ME AS A REPORTER REALIZING THAT YOU AREGETTING IMAGES OF A DYNAMIC PLANET RIGHT NOW, NOTSOMETHING THAT IS DEAD, BUT THAT YOU HAVE AN IMAGE OFDUST THAT IS ACTIVELY FALLING INTO THE CALDERA WHILE YOUWERE PHOTOGRAPHING.It was a pure chance that it was caught, but you are so right. It underlines thatwe are looking at a very dynamic system. None of the planets are dead. They areevolving at some rate in some way. Our whole solar system is evolving and thatis our real question: What was Mars before? Was it like the Earth one time, orsimilar? It's got a relatively good distance from the Sun and still receive quite alot of energy. It has seasons, just like the Earth. It has a similar day and it's thelast of the inner four rocky planets. The rest of the planets are more gaseous andliquid in form. So, what was Mars? Why is it the way it is today?More importantly, will our Earth look like Mars in another few million years? Inwhich case, where are we going to go? How are we as a species - perhaps evenall species on Earth - going to survive somewhere else?\""},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"More Information:Color Calibration ControversyJanuary 29, 2004 Color Calibration TargetJanuary 29, 2004, Martian calibration target in which the green, orange, blue and red tabsmatch well to the same tab colors on Earth.
