Sourcecould be geothermal, volcanic, water precipitate, other?Interview:Ronald Greeley, Ph.D., Regents Prof. of Geology, Arizona State UniversityDept. of Geological Sciences, and one of the 7 Chairs of the ScienceOperations Working Group (SOWG) for Spirit and Opportunity, Tempe,Arizona:THE BIGGEST SURPRISE RIGHT NOW HAS BEEN THE HIGH AMOUNTOF SULFUR IN THE BEDROCK?That was a surprise, yes. The measurements that have been made there suggestthere is a very high percentage of sulfur present in the material and that there arethese spherules that have been seen and reported earlier, those are still verycurious features.Such a high percentage of sulfur (in the bedrock) is unusual and this is whatleads some folks to consider the volcanic origin (at the Martian bedrock), or atleast volcanic processes to be involved. There are some minerals that have beenidentified in the infrared that would suggest the presence of water since theyform in water. In particular, if this is a volcanic terrain that we are looking at, thepresence of these minerals might suggest this was a hydrothermal area and sulfuris a component of such environments.SO THE BEDROCK MIGHT BE, IF WE WERE COMPARING IT TO THEEARTH, MIGHT HAVE HAD AN ORIGIN SIMILAR TO SAYYELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK?Yes, to some parts of Yellowstone, that's right.WHAT IS THE PERCENTAGE OF SULFUR CONTENT IN THAT WHITESTONE AND WHAT ELSE IS THERE?UPDATE: 20%. The percentages I don't believe those data have been releasedyet, but it's pretty high in comparison to rocks we are familiar with.AND THE AMOUNT OF SULFUR IS SULFUR ON THE EARTH LINKEDONLY TO VOLCANIC ACTIVITY?No, it can occur in sedimentary deposits as well, not just around volcanoes. Buthigh concentrations are typically found around volcanoes. It sort of depends onthe form that the sulfur occurs in we don't know that yet, but there is a chemicalprecipitate. If you've heard of gypsum on Earth gypsum has a lot of sulfur in itand it forms independently of volcanoes.WOULD HIGH SULFUR CONTENT IN ROCK EXPLAIN WHY THESESEEM TO BE RECTANGULAR AND SQUARE OR SLAB LIKE, THE WAYTHEY ARE BROKEN UP IS ALMOST STRUCTURAL?I think that is probably independent. Sulfur would not control the fracturing ofrocks to that extent.HAVE YOU ALL TALKED ABOUT THE SEEMING REGULARLY BROKENUP SQUARES AND RECTANGLES OF THE BEDROCK?Yes, there has been a fair amount of talk about the patterns and again a lot ofideas being suggested. Some people think they might look like mud cracks.Others say those are simply fractured rocks from the impact (in crater) itself. Mystery of the Small Spheres Embedded in the Bedrock"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Very sharp close-up image taken by the microscopic imager on Opportunityshows a spherule in the Martian bedrock. The composition of the spherules is currentlyunknown.The bedrock has a high sulfur content. Image credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell.ANY HYPOTHESIS ABOUT WHAT THE SPHERULES COULD BE?The general consensus seems to be centering around two possibilities:First, that they are what are called 'accretionary lapillae' that is a volcanicfeature that forms in certain kinds of eruptions in which material is added to asmall nucleus like a little dust grain and these form these spherule masses.Secondly, they could be some kind of precipitate perhaps from water. Inadditional findings, there are some minerals that have been identified in theinfrared that would suggest the presence of water since they form in water. Inparticular, if this is a volcanic terrain that we are looking at, the presence ofthese minerals might suggest this was a hydrothermal area.IS THERE ANYTHING FROM ANY OF THE SPECTROMETERS OR ALPHAX-RAY THAT INDICATE WHAT THE SPHERULES ARE MADE OUT OF?We can't measure the spherules individually they are too small. We have to getthe chemical and mineralogical signatures for the whole mass and then try todeduce what would be the composition of the spherules.SO TODAY AS WE SPEAK ON FEBRUARY 11, IS IT STILL UNKNOWNWHAT THE SPHERULES ARE MADE OUT OF?Yes that's a work in progress.NOW THE SPHERULES THEY ARE ABOUT HOW BIG IN THE BEDROCK?About 1 to 2 millimeters across.ARE THEY ALL OVER THE SLABS OF ROCK?They seem to be pretty pervasive, yes. As a matter of fact, the wheels on therover were sort of slipping as the rover was driving across that surface. It wassort of like trying to travel over ball bearings, there were so many of them that itmade the traction a little difficult. Loose Soil and Spherules Cause Opportunity to Slip"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Opportunity wheel track struggling through loose soil covered byslippery light colored spherules. Image credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell.Above: Patch of Martian soil with some of the odd small rocks and spherules on top.After Opportunity's robotic arm pressed the Moessbauer spectrometer down against the soilto take measurements, Below: some of the spherules disappeared - apparently downinto the clumpy soil because it's so loosely packed. Images credit: NASA/JPL.HAS ANYBODY EVER SEEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE THIS ANYWHEREON THE EARTH OR THE MOON?There are two kinds of grains: those that are seen in the wide angle views aremuch larger and have a different form. But those seen in the microscope imagerimages are very spherical. Some look as though they are layered like an onion.Others seem to have small pits in them. As you can imagine, these are allfeatures that are being debated right now by the team. We have seen similarthings for example, in the soils from the Apollo program on the moon. Similarrounded beads were found within the soils. In those cases, there were two types. Martian Spherules Similar to Apollo 17 Lunar \"Beads\"First, there were little droplets of impact melt. That is, when an impact forms,some of the target is melted and it forms little droplets that fall back to thesurface. An analogy that we use with our students is the old-fashioned shot"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"towers. These are structures that worked and were constructed during theRevolutionary War to make shot for rifles. Shot tower lead was dropped fromthe top of a tower and as it fell 100 feet or so to the ground, the molten leadformed these spherical masses that then dropped into water. That's how the littlemini-balls and other objects like that for ammunition were formed. Well, it's thesame idea in a natural process, whether it's a volcanic eruption or impact melt(from asteroids) that is melting the material (which flies up in the air) and dropsto the ground.Second, the second kind of bead that was found in the Apollo program was atthe Taurus Littrow site in the 1972 Apollo 17 mission and there they were littleorange beads. Those were in fact formed by volcanic processes. Again it wasmolten fragments that fell to the ground in the form of these bb-shaped droplets.Astronaut Jack Schmidt, a geologist astronaut, the only scientist astronaut to goto the moon, discovered these orange, glass beads.DID HE BRING BACK SOME THAT WERE ANALYZED ON EARTH?Yes, he did.WHERE ARE THEY TODAY?In Houston at the lunar sample labs, although some of them are still in otherlabs being studied by scientists.ANYTHING ON EARTH LIKE THEM?They could be precipitates. They could be precipitated from water. Think of it asa little grain of dust within the water and chemical precipitates like salt andother things would form around that dust grain and then those would settledown to the surface. So, those can also form spherules.ARE THE SPHERULES OUT ON THE SOIL WHERE THE OPPORTUNITYROVER HAS TRAVELED? OR ARE THEY CONFINED TO WHERE THESLABS OF BEDROCK ARE?They are in both places. We first saw them in the soil as soon as the Opportunityrover came off the lander and took that first MI (microscope) image. Thatshowed some of those little spherules on the surface there. And then as wetraveled to the outcrop, we could see them still in soil and then when we got tothe outcrop, those pictures you might have seen released show the little \"ballbearings\" in place within the outcrop itself. So they apparently, or at least someof them, are weathering out of the outcrop and contributing to the soil.SO THEY ARE BASICALLY ALL OVER EVERY PLACE THATOPPORTUNITY HAS BEEN?That's correct. Was Bedrock Once A Geothermal Hot Springs?AND ALL THIS IS ADDING UP TO A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THEPLACE WHERE OPPORTUNITY CAME DOWN ORIGINALLY MIGHTHAVE BEEN HOT MAGMA COMING UP TO THE SURFACE IN SOMEKIND OF VOLCANIC ACTIVITY? OR AT LEAST HOT SPRINGS?Yes. The evidence is sort of pointing towards the presence of a hot environment hot for some reason and that's under debate right now. Volcanic activity, magmaclose to the surface, is one possibility.WHEN WAS MARS ACTIVELY VOLCANIC, GIVEN THE FACT THAT ITHAS THE LARGEST VOLCANO IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM (Olympus Mons)?Mars has been volcanically active during much of the history that we can seeand that goes right back to the early stages of crustal formation on Mars. So, we"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"in fact have mapped the global volcanic deposits and find that at least half thesurface of the planet involves volcanism of one form or another. So, volcanismwas pretty common in Mars history. There is even the possibility that therecould be some active volcanism today. We don't know that, but we see lavaflows that are very young. We see no impact craters superimposed on them. Sothey are relatively geologically young. Evidence of Standing Water On Mars?IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL QUESTION OF HAVING OPPORTUNITYCOME DOWN ON THAT MERIDIANI PLANUM WITH THE IDEA THATTHE AREA MIGHT HAVE ONCE BEEN UNDERWATER LIKE A LAKE,CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SULFUR, OFTHE SPHERULES, ALL MIGHT BE TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHERWATER WAS ONCE THERE?The evidence we have so far is very suggestive that water was present. Thequestion that is unanswered at this time is whether the water was a standing lakeor a small sea, or if it was diffused throughout the rocks in the subsurface. Wedon't have the answer to that yet. But the observation of things like the cross bedin determining what the origin of the spherules might be those will all helpanswer that question of whether there was open water on the surface or not. It'sa fundamental question we are trying to glean the answer for.WOULD YOU SAY RIGHT NOW THAT ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 10 IF 10 ISDEFINITELY YES-WATER, WHERE WOULD YOU BE YOURSELF ON THEOPINION THAT WATER IS THERE?Do you mean water diffused through the rocks or standing body as water?STANDING BODY.I don't think we have enough information to form a good opinion about that. Idon't anyway.IS IT FAIR TO SAY AT THIS POINT AS WE ARE SPEAKING ONFEBRUARY 11, THAT THERE STILL IS NOT THE SMOKING GUN YETTHAT WATER LIKE A LAKE WAS ANYWHERE THE ROVERS HAVEBEEN SO FAR?That is correct. There is not definitive evidence for that at either the Opportunityor Spirit sites.AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ALL LOOKING FOR?Right.\"More Information:More Facts About Opportunity Landing SiteNASA now knows the location of Opportunity's landing site crater, which is 22meters (72 feet) in diameter. Radio signals gave a preliminary location less thanan hour after landing, and additional information from communications withNASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter soon narrowed the estimate, said JPL's TimMcElrath, deputy chief of the navigation team.As Opportunity neared the ground, winds changed its course from eastbound tonorthbound, according to analysis of data recorded during the landing. \"It's as ifthe crater were attracting us somehow,\" said JPL's Dr. Andrew Johnson,engineer for a system that estimated the spacecraft's horizontal motion duringthe landing. The spacecraft bounced 26 times and rolled about 200 meters(about 220 yards) before coming to rest inside the crater, whose outcroprepresents a bonanza for geologists on the mission."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Opportunity Rover Photographs Its Parachute and BackshellOutside CraterJPL geologist Dr. Tim Parker was able to correlate a few features on the horizonabove the crater rim with features identified by Mars orbiters, and JPL imagingscientist Dr. Justin Maki identified the spacecraft's jettisoned backshell andparachute in another Opportunity image showing the outlying plains.Above: White center object is NASA parachute and to the left is the spacecraft's jettisonedbackshell.

A dark feature near thelander may be the rover. \"I won't know if it's really the rover until I take anotherpicture after the rover moves,\" said Dr. Michael Malin of Malin Space ScienceSystems, San Diego.

THEN DOWN BELOW, THERE WAS A VERY ODD 2-PRONGEDOBJECT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BLOWN UP AND HAVE BEENDISCUSSING ON THE INTERNET. HAVE YOU SEEN IT AND WHATCOMMENT DO YOU HAVE?Yes, it's interesting. But there are so many things on planetary surfaces that wephotograph and it's important to remember that effects of illumination andviewing geometry have a big influence on what we see. It's sort of like looking atmythical figures in clouds. You have to look at it from different angles and underdifferent lighting before you can really say. So, this might be nothing more thanan artifact of shadows and the shape of the object.BUT IT CERTAINLY LOOKS 2-DIMENSIONAL AND IT HAS A SORT OFORGANIC QUALITY TO IT. SERIOUSLY, COULD THERE BE SOMETHINGLIKE A PLANT GROWING THERE?If it were, that would be really something, I'd have to say! But I don't think toomany would hold with that notion, at least not until we get better views of it andfrom different angles.THEN IT'S THAT ISSUE AGAIN: YOU WOULD THINK THAT SOMEBODYWOULD WANT TO TAKE THE ROVER AND GO RIGHT OVER TO THISOBJECT AND FIND OUT WHAT IT WAS?If it turned out that it was something we couldn't explain with lighting or as arock shape certainly that would be an interesting thing to do you bet.COULD THERE POSSIBLY BE A GROWING ALGAE AROUND ON THESURFACE OF MARS?As a scientist, we never say never.
