The followinganecdote or preliminary report, received from Dave on July 8, 1991, is of specialinterest because it relates to an alleged pre-Roswell crash and retrieval.David Dobbs: 'Tex Martin, to the best of his recollection, was six years old(which would be in 1946) when he went through a guarded doorway at WrightField. But the strange scene that met his eyes was burned into his memoryforever. Not just once, but on several successive days, he saw the samestrange object. As an adult, he discussed the incident only with his wife andover forty years would pass before he understood the significance of what hehad seen. On the evening of September 19, 1990, while he was watching theUnsolved Mysteries program which described a UFO crash/retrieval, Texsuddenly realized what he had observed in that hangar. Tex is an amateur radio operator. When he accidentally tuned into theMUFON Amateur Radio Net on March 23, 1991, he learned that someonelocal might have a serious interest in his information. He subsequentlycontacted the author, who had been acting as net control operator by phone.The narrative which follows is what he related. School had closed the week preceding Tex's sixth birthday on June 10, 1946.As a present, and a reward for having done well in class, he was allowed toaccompany his father, Jack Martin, to work. Jack installed aircraft instrumentsat Wright Field (later to become Wright-Patterson Air Force Base). Heworked out of a shanty on the field, but changed clothes and ate with othermen in a hangar area furnished with picnic tables. A washroom and lockerswere located down the aisle of the L-shaped room. Unusual activity was evident when Tex and his father arrived at the hangarthat Monday morning. Military vehicles were parked in front of the hangardoors and 'Army men' were present. Tex emphasizes that these vehicles andsoldiers were seen only on that first day. Inside the hangar,, large panel doorscould be closed sideways to separate the canteen area from the main part ofthe hangar. These were just sliding shut as Tex entered the canteen, but notbefore he caught sight of several low-boy trucks inside with tarpaulin-coveredloads. Tex remembers savoring the first Eskimo Pie he had ever eaten and taking thewrapper to a trash can which stood beside a pop machine. Tex eyed thebottles of pop with longing because they included his favorite - chocolatesoda. A janitor was stationed nearby guarding a walk-through door in thesliding panels. Noticing Tex's interest in the pop, he offered to treat him. Texwent to ask permission from his father and then came back to accept thedrink. While standing there, he was able to look through the small door whichhad been left open. Inside the main hangar, soldiers were working and quite acrowd was gathering. Several small bodies (Tex thought three or four) lay onstretchers in front of a large, dome-shaped object supported on tripodal legs.Blankets were scattered about on the floor and soldiers were folding up a"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"large tarpaulin. He remembers that the bodies were small, brownish in color, and had large,pear-shaped heads. He estimates that the domed object in the background was18-20 feet in diameter. It was off-white in color, had no sharp points, and wasencircled by a flat band. Tex told his father about the object which he sawwhen he looked through the doorway. It was probably Thursday morning when a Colonel noticed Tex lookingthrough the door and ordered Tex's father to take him home. A week or twolater, Jack Martin lost his job. He told Tex and his mother that he had seenstuff he wasn't supposed to see. Tex remembers his father crying in thekitchen and the difficulty he had finding other work. Tex overheard hisgrandfather, who also worked at Wright Field, telling his parents that a portionof a space vehicle had been brought in. Tex has a good memory of the topography of the field at that time, with arunway going up a hill where gliders were launched. This ran east and westbetween buildings towards a water tower. According to his father, there wasan underground facility in the hill containing top-secret stuff. Only peoplewith the highest clearances could get in. The investigator's preliminary conclusions are that Tex Martin appears to be astable, honest individual without the reason or background to fabricate such astory. It appears likely that hypnotic regression could verify the dates andcircumstances involved and elucidate a wealth of detailed information. 'OVER THERE' Some time in 1964, 'somewhere at sea,' between the Caribbean and the Atlantic, aspecially rigged LST flagship (aka 'spy ship') for a naval amphibious force received acoded radio message in its 'crypto-machine' room, which reported that 'artifacts' hadbeen retrieved with three dead personnel. According to my informant, former Third Class Petty Officer, S. M. Brannigan(pseudonym), a specialist trained to translate intercepted Russian transmissions, thedecoded report stated that a UFO had crashed in two parts: the main section nearPenkridge in Staffordshire, England; and the remains in West Germany. He furtherstated that the retrievals of the parts and the occupants were conducted by Air ForceIntelligence and shipped to Wright-Patterson AFB, adding that U. S. and otherNATO interceptors were involved. Brannigan admitted there was more to theincident which involved coded information that he preferred to keep confidential. The Brannigan disclosure, while sketchy, might spotlight only the tip of the icebergas to the scope of military crash/retrieval operations in foreign lands. Researchersknow that reports of crashes are worldwide from pole to pole on every continent inmany countries - even in remote Madagascar. If such incidents are to be secreted, itis my suspicion that U. S. special retrieval teams have been, and still are, prepared to'go into action' into any crash location within its sphere of military or economicinfluence such as was exercised with NATO in the 'artifact' retrievals in England andWe st Ge rma ny. Similar actions surely would have been mandated in the USSR, affecting the WarsawPact nations and those within their 'sphere,' reaching as far as Cuba. During the ColdWar years, we had only rumors and 'leaked out' information from that vast domain.Then, suddenly and unpredictably, came news of a collapsed 'empire,' and glasnostwhich allowed its citizens and UFO researchers more freedom and access to theWest. They now share their concerns about their own UFO incursion and reports oflandings, abductions, encounters during space flights, power outages and even an'official' admission of a recent intercept mission over Moscow. And yes, there werecrashes and recoveries. But, like the U. S., there is still no official admission.Secrecy still prevails. One Russian correspondent, writing from Denmark, told me inhis letter of May 28, 1991, that he believes that his incoming and outgoing mail ismonitored by the KGB. He also noted, 'Not far from Moscow in the town of Mitishi,there is a military center where all UFO information is gathered...' COLD WAR UFOS OVER USSR Sensitive information about UFO activity worldwide is occasionally made available"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"to me from reliable sources. Because it usually involves highly classified militarysituations, most firsthand sources request that it not be published. Others cautiouslyallow portions of their disclosure to be released, but on their terms and insist onanonymity. Some of this kind of material I prefer not to use in my status reportsbecause it is too brief and too vague to be meaningful. There are exceptions, of course, to name one where it concerns the Soviet Unionduring the Cold War era when news about UFOs was scarce. During this fragileperiod of vigilance for a sudden missile attack, sophisticated United States satellitestried to keep track of any and all aerial traffic in Earth's envelope of space. Oneincident stands out, occurring in October 1981, when a cluster of UFOs wasdetected heading from space toward Moscow. The results of the incursion areunknown, but unfortunately, a former Air Force Airman, Simone Mendez, assignedto high-security telecommunications with the 2069th Communications Squadron atNellis AFB, became involuntarily implicated with another airman in her section ofwork, who gave her a copy of the NORAD message. As a result, Simone got intoserious trouble. I was in touch with Simone by phone and mail shortly after the distressing incident,but chose to make only a brief reference to it in Status Report III in deference to hersensitive position and security issues. I have since met Simone twice at MUFONmeetings. In October 1990 during the MUFON Missouri Conference, I attended aprivate session when she was regressed hypnotically by psychotherapist, JohnCarpenter, in an attempt to clarify the wording of the NORAD message. For Simone,it was a stressful ordeal to face possible charges of espionage and, to me, she stillshowed depressive concern about the event that happened nine years before. Simone's story about the affair is a long and sad one indeed, but now it is in theopen. She revealed her whole story to Barry Greenwood, which appears in two partsstarting in the June 1991 issue of Just Cause. Recommended reading! Another sensitive case, involving the Soviet Union, also involved U. S. intelligencecapabilities when U. S. agents in 1972 witnessed a UFO landing incident duringmilitary maneuvers in East Germany. The incident is documented, a copy of whichgot into the hands of a trusted person in the ministry. A brief description of theincident was sent to me from a 1988 report by the ministry official as follows:Soviet Ministry Official: 'East German and Soviet armies were conductingwar games in East Germany. Suddenly, a large, round, purplish spheredescended upon them; hovering a few feet off the ground in the center of thefield of activity - bringing both armies to a standstill. Sphere continuedhovering there for several minutes and then shrank to a point of light beforedisappearing. The incident remains Top Secret due to the fact that it had been viewed by U.S. government agents secretly observing the army activities. This report wasfiled in the records of Congress on June 24, 1972; case number to be withheldto protect the identity of the officer. Case number is known. Note: Officer reported that he was warned never to reveal the facts of thisreport, whether he remained in the military or reverted to civilian life.' 'EMISSARY' DR. MARINA POPOVICH: A NEW EAST-WESTCONNECTION In Russia, Dr. Marina Popovich is a living legend. Called 'Gosposa Mig' (Lady Mig),she was her country's most famous woman test pilot with two records instratospheric flight and experience with three different types of the Soviet fighterplane, Mig and Antonov-Maschines. Honored as a 'hero of the Soviet Union,' herrank in the air force is colonel. After leaving active duty, she studied TechnicalScience, achieved a doctorate in engineering and joined the Academy of SciencesAll-Union Investigation Committee for Anomalous Aerial Phenomena. Her formerhusband is Air Force General Pavel Popovich, cosmonaut, and former head of theAcademy's UFO Commission, and today, head of the Soviet All-Union Center(Soyusufotsentr) with headquarters in the building of the Technical and EngineeringAssociation in Moscow. The credentials of Dr. Marina Popovich, expressed in the foregoing introduction bymy German colleague, Michael Hesemann, would certainly put her in an idealposition to act as a messenger, or emissary, to share her country's concerns about"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"UFO affairs. Since glasnost, she has traveled extensively beyond her homeland tolecture with translator, which included an international conference in Tucson,Arizona, May 8, 1991. Through the cooperation of Hesemann, also in Tucson, I wasprivileged to conduct a two-hour taped interview by phone with Dr. Popovich,during which time I asked about UFO crash/retrievals in the USSR. Her responsewas forthright, not hedging on naming locations, but she admitted that herdisclosures were not official. Hesemann covers some of her revelations in his Faxmessage to me, May 28, 1991, as follows:Michael Hesemann: 'In June 1990, UFO experts from nine countries met inMunich, Germany, to attend the 2nd International UFO Conference in theCongress Hall of the German Museum. It was the second event of that size inGermany; the first one took place in October 1989, in Frankfurt, with 35speakers and representatives of 29 countries and 1800 participants. One highlight of the Munich conference was the participation of Col. Dr.Marina Popovich, head of the Soviet delegation with four representatives ofSoviet UFO research, including two members of the Academy of Science. Marina Lavrentrevna Vasliyevna Popovich, born July 20, 1931. Linda Howe Editor's Note: Marina Popovich learned to fly and was commissionedinto the Soviet Air Force. By the time she met her husband, Pavel Popovich in 1955,she was a Major, a test pilot and held thirteen aviation world records. She retired asa Colonel in the Soviet Air Force and spoke publically in international conferencesabout UFO phenomena, especially the unexplained disappearance of the SovietPhobos 2 space probe that arrived in Mars orbit in January 1989. One of the goalsfor the spacecraft was to fly close to the Martian moon, Phobos, and explore it withequipment from two instrument packages that would be launched to the moon'ssurface. But on March 28, 1989, after the Soviet spacecraft had aligned itself with Phobos,the Tass news agency reported that: \"Phobos 2 had failed to communicate withEarth, as scheduled, after completing an operation yesterday around the Martinmoon Phobos. Scientists at mission control have been unable to establish radiocontact.\" During the alignment, Phobos 2 transmitted an image of a long, thinshadow that seemed between the spacecraft and the planet Mars.March 28, 1989, image from Soviet spacecraft, Phobos 2,as it was aligning itself with the Martian moon, Phobos. A Soviet missiongoal was to explore the moon's surface with equipment. Image allegedlysmuggled to public by Marina Popovich. The next day on March 29, 1989, one of the last transmissions from Phobos 2showed an image of a gigantic cylindrical object approximately 20 kilometers longand 1.5 kilometers wide seemingly near the moon, Phobos. After that last framewas radio-transmitted back to Earth, the probe mysteriously disappeared. MarinaPopovich allegedly smuggled out for public release that frame and anothercontroversial one of a cigar-shaped shadow between the Phobos 2 spacecraft andMars."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"March 29, 1989, alleged \"last frame\" taken by Soviet's Phobos 2 spacecraftof Phobos before it suddenly and mysteriously disappeared. Long, thin object unidentified.Image allegedly smuggled to public by Marina Popovich.Michael Hesemann: 'In her lecture, Marina mentioned over 3,000 reports ofUFO sightings by Soviet military and civilian pilots. The latest UFO sightingover a highway near Moscow on March 21, 1990, was officially confirmed bythe Soviet Chief of Air Command, Major General Igor Maltsev in aninterview, published in the Union's paper, Rabotschaya Tribuna (WorkersTribune) on April 19, 1990, when the General informed the public that twoMig 23 interceptors were scrambled, but unable to intercept the strangedisc-shaped object. It was 'a disc with a diameter from 100 to 200 meters,' theGeneral said, 'capable of hovering and flying with a speed exceeding that ofthe most modern jet fighter by two or three times.' The object flew in heightsbetween 3,000 and 21,000 feet. It seemed it was completely devoid of inertia.In other words, they had somehow 'come to terms' with gravity. At the presenttime, terrestrial machines could hardly have any such capabilities.' Marina Popovich also wrote in her book UFO-Glasnost (published Fall 1991,Germany), 'The Soviet Air Force and the KGB have fragments of five crashedUFOs in its possession. They analyzed the material and came to theconclusion that it indeed was not manufactured on Earth with terrestrialtechnology.' The crash sites she named were Tunguska, Novosibirsk,Tallin/Estonia, Ordzhonikidze/Kaukasus and Dal' negorsk. The latest UFO crash in the USSR happened on January 29, 1986. Shortlybefore 8:00 p.m., dozens of witnesses in the city of Dal' negorsk in easternSiberia near Vladivostok observed a ball-shaped object, flying parallel to theground before crashing with an angle of 60-70 degrees in the 611 meters high'Hill 611' or 'Izvestkovaya Mountain' in the center of the city. The reddishglowing object had a speed of 45 feet/second before it crashed. According tothe eyewitnesses, it jumped up and down for some time before it finallycrashed into the mountain, exploded soundlessly and burned for nearly anhour. On February 3, 1986, an expedition of the Far East Department of theInvestigation Committee for Anomalous Aerial Phenomena of the Academyof Science led by Dr. Valery Dvuzhiln y arrived in Dal' negorsk, starting theinvestigation. The scientists discovered many fragments, including lead and iron-balls, bitsof glass, traces of high temperature activity, magnetic anomalies, damage tonearby trees and the most mysterious discovery - a fine mesh of nettingwoven out of inert metal threads out of an alloy of gold, silver, nickel, alpha-titanium, molybdenum and beryllium. One of the scientists who analyzed thematerial, V. Vysotky, Doctor of Chemistry at Vladivostok University, came tothe conclusion in his man-paged investigation report that, 'This fine metallicwebbing is undoubtedly a high-technology product and not a thing of naturalor terrestrial origin.' He supposed the object in question was an automaticscout probe of alien origin. Some of the threads, Dr. Vysotky pronounced,were only 17 microns thick and even woven with even finer material -impossible for terrestrial technology (of the time). An earlier crash happened on March 6, 1983, when military air surveillancelocated a low-flying object maneuvering in the Kaukasus Mountains near thecity of Ordzhonikidze. A ground-stationed rocket was fired, hit the object,"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"damaged but did not destroy it. Reeling, it continued its flight, losing height,and disappearing from the radar screen. Two months later in May 1983, two mushroom pickers roamed through theStolovaia mountains near Ordzhonikidze (Kabardino-Balkarskaia-Region),discovered it: An object 24 feet in diameter and of the same height. The upperhalf made out of crystal-like glass; the lower one out of metal with a four-parttelescopic landing gear and two extended ramps. On its bottom side, it has sixbig, heavy jets and four groups of four smaller jets in cross formation at thesides of the tent-like, crystal-like dome. On one side was a strange symbol: acrescent on its back with four rays meeting in its center. The couple got their cheap, simple camera and took some pictures. Hesitating,the man climbed on the ramp, looked inside of a giant sliding door. Under thedome, he found a big pilot's seat that was double the size of a normal one,made for a giant of 3-4 meters. The couple went to town, gave the film to a local photo shop. The news aboutthe strange discovery spread and the local military learned about it. They wentto the site, sealed the area off. It took two days to bring military transportersto the remote mountain plateau. The object was transported first to a localmilitary base and then to a military underground facility near Mytishi,southeast of Moscow. According to Valery Uvarov, member of the Soviet UFO Commission, theinvestigation of the strange machine led to the discovery of two propulsion: anantigravity-propulsion for the flight and a jet-propulsion for finer maneuveringin a mountain area. Obviously, the craft crash-landed, its pilot left it. Itsboard-mechanisms functioned good enough to set down, drive out the landinggear and the ramps. The propulsion was identified as 'neutrino beams' by the Soviet scientists,dangerous for humans who are exposed to it for longer than one hour. Indeed,the mushroom-picker and his wife died in 1988 from cancer. According toUvarov, members of the original retrieval team suffered from the samedisease. Indeed, the strange object of which I have four pictures in my possession,does not look like a high tech device from outer space, but more like a testvehicle of a lunar landing module. Uvarov says he believes the Americansdiscovered a similar device and imitated it for the construction of the famous'Eagle' lunar landing module used for the Apollo moon program. Indeed, the craft looks too solid to be a hoax and one photograph shows themushroom picker on one of the ramps, giving the impression of the real size ofthe object. It was discussed that it might have been a Soviet test vehicle, butthis possibility was ruled out by the Soviet Space Agency and the Academy ofScience. The second possibility discussed was that the object was constructedfor a Polish science fiction movie. Up to now - 8 years later - no movieappeared with this strange object in it. In Ordzhonikidze, nobody remembers afilm crew trying to reach the remote region of Stolovania mountains. The caseremains a mystery.'\" Continued in Part 17 - Inside the Soviet SanctumCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
