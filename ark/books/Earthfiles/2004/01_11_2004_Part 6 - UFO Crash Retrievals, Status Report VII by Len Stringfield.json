The first section of Part 6, \"Words on a Window Frame,\" was submitted bySheila Franklin to Len Stringfield on December 9, 1993, concerning theinvestigation of Professor Edith Simpson.Words on a Window Frame: A Whimsy or a Warning? Investigator Sheila Franklin: \"On November 23, 1993, I had my lastphone conversation with Professor Simpson. It was not satisfactory to me.She had a litany of problems that led to excuses as to why she could notprovide 'copies' of the photos we requested. The problems she enumeratedwere so many and so burdensome that it seemed more than one sixtyishwoman alone could bear. At the end of our lengthy conversations, she didwhat she always had done. She promised our satisfaction, but sometimeway down the line. After all of the months of dealing with her, I did notexpect anything more of her. Little did I anticipate that I had a surprise on the way. On November 24,1993, after I had completed an early morning tennis match, I went toanswer the phone in my den. As I was seated at my desk, I turned to thewindows that faced directly out at the ocean. The windows are modernawning-type that have metal frames. They encompass three windowstogether each with four panes that open in an awning-type fashion. In thecenter window on the center metal frame, I thought I saw some kind ofwriting. I went to the window and could not believe my eyes. There,deeply etched into the metal, were the words - COME HOME MY LOVE- and what looked like the initials O. H. I was shocked. I tried to rub thewords out, but they wouldn't erase. They were engraved into the metal. Ilook out of the window every day that I am home. It is my favorite windowto stand in front of, since it has the best view. I have lived in the apartmentfor thirteen years and never saw this writing before and it would be hard tomiss! I check out the weather there every day, especially the days that I amplaying tennis. Why and who would do this? How and when did they getinto my home? My first thought was to check with the cleaning person, Yvonne, whoworked for my condo and also cleaned my apartment and windows everytwo weeks. She has been doing that for eight years and is absolutelytrustworthy. I wanted to know if she had ever seen this before. She had justwashed the windows five days prior. She said that she had never seen thewriting before. I then beeped my friend, Don, who had remodeled myapartment nine months prior and knew every inch of the place. I had himinspect the engraving and he, too, said that he had never seen that beforeand would have noticed! The fact that there was no evidence of a breaking or entering reallybothered me. There also was nothing missing or out of place. That meantto me that the intention was not criminal, even though the act was. How"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"did the person or persons get into my apartment? The only people whohad keys besides myself are my mother and Yvonne. I live in a buildingthat has 24-hour security guards at the main entrance, but for the daysfrom November 22-24, 1993, the service entrance was fully open andunlocked, due to the laying of hallway carpeting in the building. It wouldbe quite easy for someone/s to slip into the building and ride the elevatorto my 10th floor apartment completely unnoticed. What I found most ominous was the message engraved into the windowframe - COME HOME MY LOVE. It certainly sounded chummy, kind oflike an unrequited lover or a languishing one. To my knowledge, there isno one in my life that fits that stereotype. Romance has not been my focus,since I got involved in UFOl ogy. The logical progression then is to assume that this is linked to the case ofProfessor Simpson. I am sure that the verbiage used in the message wasmeant to be construed by the non-cognoscenti as innocuous, nebulous andshoulder-shrugging. If it was threatening, it would be more damning to theagent/s involved and lend credence to the illegal entering of my home. Idecided to make a police report on this, even though I knew that it wouldbe considered a non-event to them, as there was no real evidence of acrime, other than my say-so. The police officer took the information and itwas stated on the police report as a 'Miscellaneous Incident.' The officersaid that in over 22 years of his time on the force in the area, it was the firsttime he had ever been to my building for any kind of an incident. I agreedwith him that in the 13 years that I lived in the building, there had neverbeen a burglary by an unknown individual. An important postscript to this relates to possible phone surveillance onothers who are connected to me. After this event, I decided to phone mygood friend, confidante and private investigator, Andy. When I told Andywhat had transpired, he thought it quite bizarre, even for agents. He alsomentioned that he had been having anomalous drops on his phone lines.He would lose phone calls in mid-conversation. His contact within thephone company could not understand where this draw on the line wascoming from, even though it appeared that the phone computer room tapwas off his line. Now, two weeks have passed. Andy states that he and hiswife have tried to phone me from their home and cannot get my phone. Hesaid that a recorded phone message comes on saying that my phone doesnot accept incoming messages, or there is a continual busy signal, despitethe fact that I have call-waiting. No other people have indicated the sameproblem with my phone. Concurrently with Andy's phone problems, my friend, Don, who I hadbeeped initially about the engraving, also had immediate problems with hisphone. He could not get any calls out and only one call in on his phone.He was very upset since it included Thanksgiving Day, when he wanted tophone his family. When he checked with the phone company, no reasonfor the problem was given. The service interruption disappeared after twodays. My conclusion to this event of very high strangeness is that there is nodoubt someone/s unknown illegally entered my home and defaced myproperty with the intent to intimidate me. The synchronicity time-wise, itappears, relates to the completed case of Professor Simpson. Why 'they'waited for completion is questionable. Perhaps, it is meant to be apermanent reminder of the eternal vigilance of the agents.\" An Alleged 1952 UFO Crash The Media and The Censors My source for this story is Robert Oliveri, an electronic technician, reaching himat his lab in August 1993. Robert is a cousin of Joe from whom he learned of theNew York newspaper's headline story of a UFO crash in 1952 and of the eventsthat followed at his parents' apartment in the Bronx. According to Robert, Joe's"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"father overheard a brisk discussion between two government agents and hisneighbor, an occupant below him on the third floor. The gist of their inquiry wasto ascertain whether a copy of the newspaper was purchased at the nearbynewsstand. Robert is not sure whether or not the neighbor surrendered hispaper, but his uncle reasoned that he would be next to face the inquisition.Acting on an impulse, he hid the newspaper under the kitchen linoleum. Commented Robert, \"In those days before air-conditioning, occupants in hotweather depended on screen doors and rarely closed doors to allow forventilation. Everybody knew everybody else's business.\" When the inquisitors came, Joe's dad explained that he had not yet bought theevening paper and out of curiosity asked simply, \"Why all the concern?\" Thefrank response: \"A flying saucer story got into the paper which was not true andthe government feared that it would upset the public.\" Like a dreaded curse, the newspaper was left to rest in its tomb under thelinoleum until the early 1960s. Knowing of his son's blossoming interest inUFOs, he finally opted to uncover and show him the newspaper, now yellowwith age, and to admit his feelings of guilt when he misinformed the agents. Stunned, Joe shared his secret with cousin, Robert. Regrettably, the fate of thenewspaper is unknown. Joe believes that his dad returned it to its grave underthe linoleum. Three years later, Joe and family moved to Florida, minus thenewspaper. According to Robert, the photo in the newspaper first caught his eye. Taken by aflash camera at night, the disc-shaped craft had crashed head-on, submergingtilt-wise into a sandy terrain. No windows were visible, he said, but he recallsseeing an opening on the underside of the craft's tilted rear. Around the discwere many footprints apparently made by retrieval personnel, but no oneappeared in the picture. Looking back into the early years of UFO activity, starting with the Roswellincident in 1947, most of its low-level sorties were concentrated over militarybases, nuclear, rocket and missile test facilities and high-tech industrial sites. Indeed for the U. S., these were perilous times. Geopolitically, a war ofaggression raged in Korea. Communist China menaced all of Asia and of evengreater consequence, was the threat of nuclear war with a hostile Soviet Union.Equal to these terrestrial problems were the unpredictables of a UFO incursion. Boasting strategists, however, believed that the U. S. could cope with theworld's tensions, having confidence in their early H-bomb and missilesuperiority. But the non-terrestrial UFO was anathema; a scientificembarrassment and a potential trouble-maker for mankind's philosophies,religions and eventually the economy. Despite the evidence of UFO crashes,losing aircraft during intercept missions, and some frightening encounters withnondescript entities, the strategists devised a plan to hide the real facts and inmany clever ways, manipulated the public into thinking that the interloper andits little green men were a fantasy. In spite of secrecy and censorship, there is leakage of sensitive information. But,without official confirmation, it fades into the rumor mills and if the name of thesource is not revealed, the media is not interested.
