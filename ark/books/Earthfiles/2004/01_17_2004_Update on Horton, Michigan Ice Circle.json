When a large, nearly perfect circle was discovered in MudLake ice on December 28, 2003, many wondered if there was a link between thebright light and the ice circle. Some of the local residents say the cove end of thelake where the ice circle emerged has been called the \"Devil's Hollow\" becausepeople have seen so many strange lights there. In fact, over the past few years,near the same hill above Mud Lake, Vaughn Hobe has repeatedly seen large,orange glowing spheres at least 25-feet in diameter hovering in the sky. He saysthe orange is the color of a ripe pumpkin and that he has only seen one sphere ata time, never in groups. The closest approach was once about 200 feet away.The orange spheres have been stationary and then move off, seeming to dipdown toward the hill beyond his house where he saw the bright, white bar oflight on December 18, 2003.News about the Mud Lake ice circle did not reach investigators until ChristmasEve, December 31, 2003. The next day on January 1, 2004, the research teamthat went to Mud Lake included: Jeffrey Wilson, Ted Robertson, Dr. CharlesLietzau, Roger and Nancy Sugden, Zach Smith and Todd Lemire, Chief FieldInvestigator for the Michigan Mutual UFO Network (MUFON). The researchersreported there was a clear ice circle about thirty feet in diameter at the center."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"That ice was only about one-inch thick.The clear center circle was surrounded by a whitish-grey ring of thicker iceabout four to five inches deep. Surrounding the ring was what the group calledthe \"exterior edge.\" The three sections of the ice circle measured sixty-two feeteast to west and sixty-four feet north to south.To find out what the academic world knows about ice circles, I contacted anexpert on inland waters who also studies ice and the patterns ice makes. He isJohn Magnuson, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus of Zoology and Limnology (study ofinland waters), at the University of Wisconsin Center for Limnology in Madison.Through email, I showed Professor Magnuson photographs of the Mud Lake icecircle. The following are excerpts from an audiotaped interview done while hehad the three computer images shown below in front of him.Horton, Michigan ice circle (62 x 64 feet diameter) found in Mud Lake coveabout ten feet from reed bed on December 28, 2003.

Photograph © 2004 by Ted Robertson.Interview:John Magnuson, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus of Zoology and Limnology,Center for Limnology, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin: \"You've raised two issues. One is a light on the horizon that could be anythingand secondly, the fact that there was snow on the ice and then there wasthawing. The way that grey ice forms typically is that you get melting snow ontop of the ice and then that slush re-freezes. If you had this melting snow let'ssay that snow fell across the whole area and the middle area for one reason oranother is open, then near the edge the water tends to seep out into the snowthat is on the ice. So, that grey ice could have been caused by the re-freezing ofthat melted snow and that melting snow could be wetted from water seeping upfrom the open area.I haven't seen something quite like this, but I've seen lots of holes through the iceand spent a lot of time on the ice in the winter. First of all, ice forms all sorts ofinteresting patterns. Snowflakes are beautiful. They have symmetry. In thespring, the lakes break up and form hexagons in the ice. There is a lot of patternand physical structure to ice.This particular pattern (at Mud Lake), this ring, I really don't know what it iscaused by. I'm sure it's caused by natural processes, but I don't know what it iscaused by. I haven't seen one as big as this that has the larger dimension aroundit.The pattern ice forms in two very different forms and variations in between. Onewe call clear ice and the other we call grey ice. Clear ice is when you havewater freezing and it doesn't have snow or slush. It isn't broken up. It just freezesand that ice is often called clear ice or dark ice because you can look rightthrough it.This ring that you are seeing has a ring of what we would call grey ice, which isnot just plain frozen water like an ice cube. It also shows evidence of beingmixed with snow or mixed with broken pieces of ice that formed around an openhole that piled up around the edges and then re-froze, so it's not clear. It is infact grey or from these photos, it appears to be a white ice.And it is very symmetrical, this particular pattern and I had originally thoughtthat it was a late-freezing area in the middle of the lake and wind action mighthave caused the grey ice ring as the ring broke up around the edges. But I thinksomething else has kept the water open here.If I had to guess,it would be a hole that was formed by a spring that would cause somevertical movement of the water to keep this area, the clear area open longerand the clear area then froze a few days or a week later than the areaaround the edges.Another possibility is that it might have been an area where a muskrat hadpushed through and muskrats tend to do this when the ice is very thin. Butfor some reason, the center part of this ring did not freeze as early as thering itself. Then a few days later, perhaps the next cold period, the centerfroze in what we call clear ice or transparent ice.Another possibility is that if they looked at the bottom structure, that thebottom structure might not be just flat. Consider the possibility that theremight be a mound in the sediment, so that right where this circle is thewater is shallow and as you go out from it, the water deepens a little bit inall directions.BUT FROM YOUR PROFESSIONAL ACADEMIC CAREER STUDYINGWATER AND ICE, THIS IS AN UNUSUAL ICE CIRCLE?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"It's a beautiful ice circle and it is unusual.THE INVESTIGATORS SAID THAT THEY WERE 'STRUGGLING WITHTHE FACT THAT THE WATER IS ONLY TWO OR THREE INCHES DEEPBEFORE YOU START HITTING THE SEDIMENT UNDERNEATH.'One of the things that I might think there is whether it is a stream of methanebubbles that are coming up from the organic bottom or it's a small place wherethere is a slightly greater flow of spring water in, with that shallow of water, youmight imagine that would move to the surface in a very localized spot.\"Close-up of one of about twenty holes found fifty feet north of the halosurrounding the ice circle at Mud Lake. They are all in an area of ten by twenty feet.Photograph © 2003 by Vaughn Hobe.Both the hole in the ice circle that has a plant stem marking it and another ice holein the lower right have a radiating radial pattern. Only the holes in this small area oftheice circle had small dark spots visible in the photograph. Photograph © 2003 byVaughn Hobe. Dr. Magnuson pointed out that methane bubbles might also explain severalsmall one-inch diameter holes shown in the above photographs that investigatorsfound in the ice circle. Methane bubbles are known to break open small holes inice through which water can rise like little geysers, especially if there is snowweight on the ice. Water flooding into snow will create slush rings. A Biologist's Experiment with Ice, Snow and Cold WaterIn fact, Michigan investigator Charles Lietzau, Ph.D., who teaches biology atMumford High School not far from Detroit, found holes in ice covered withsnow on a lake near his home that were gushing water. Inspired further by theice circle research of German crop circle researcher Andreas Mueller, who hasdocumented many naturally-formed ice circles, Dr. Lietzau also did a backyardexperiment to test the hypothesis that water spilling onto snow-covered ice"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"creates a thicker ice layer. That's what happened and the pattern was a ring,similar to the so-called \"splash ring\" at Mud Lake.Charles Lietzau, Ph.D., Biology Teacher, Mumford High School, DetroitPublic Schools, Waterford, Michigan: \"I found an area where the snow wasvery thin maybe 1/8th of an inch at this point and uniform. I poured a smallamount of cold water on to it to see what the results would be.Eventually the water spilled on the ice would cool down enough that ratherthan melting the snow, it would actually mix with the snow and form slush. Thisslush would be thicker than the ice underneath once it re-froze. It would be theaddition of the wet snow on top of the ice underneath. That's basically whathappened. The water would dissolve a circular, smooth central circle and thanat the very edge when it finally was unable to penetrate the snow or melt it, itwas attracted into the snow by capillary action and it turned the edge of the ringto slush. Then eventually everything froze. The thickness of the slush wasbasically the thickenss of the snow cover.A day later after this whole trial had been covered by fresh snow, I cleared allthe snow that had settled on the smooth inner circle and the snow that hadalways been beyond the splash ring and what I had left was a beautiful splashring with the same pattern radiating outward in terms of the direction ofdeposition that we had seen at the circle at Mud Lake.Small scale experiment by Charles Lietzau on January 14, 2004,to see what would happen if a small amount of cold water was poured on a thin layerof snow and ice. Result was 2-inch center circle of clear ice surrounded by an irregular ringof frozen slush, very similar to Mud Lake's 'splash ring.' Photograph © 2004 by CharlesLietzau, Ph.D.IS IT VALID TO MAKE A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE EXPERIMENTON A TABLE TOP AND MUD LAKE?That's actually a very good question. Eventually you'd like to approach thingslike this and do a full sized, full scale experiment.Now, that doesn't leave out the possibility that there could actually be anothersource that melted an open circle and created some kind of surface disturbance.If you strike a bowl of water, little droplets jump everywhere. So something likethat could possibly duplicate this effect. But what we are saying is that we seemto have evidence here that there are also natural systems that could account forit.RIGHT.Indeed this is very interesting in the sense that it is located directly under asighting of a brilliant, dazzling column of light and the calculation of thedistance involved and the estimated size indicate that the column of light hadthe same diameter as the circle (in the lake) and roughly in the same location asseen from roughly 1,000 feet away (Vaughn Hobe's eyewitness account).Unfortunately you have to look for all the possibilities. And while this mightwell be caused by something exotic, we have to recognize that we've"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"experimentally determined that there are a number of natural factors whichcould also account for it.\"More Information:The Mud Lake ice circle research in Horton, Michigan, has provoked aninternational collaboration on natural ice circle explanations.
