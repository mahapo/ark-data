Len Stringfield - continued: Roswell is a small town's name in New Mexico, adjacent to the old air baseknown as Roswell Air Field to its south. Both town and base are 75 miles awayfrom the Max Brazel ranch near the still smaller town of Corona. There,allegedly, an alien saucer with its crew crashed on July 2, 1947. (Dates vary).Niched in history because of that event, Roswell will become even moreenshrined when new evidence will be released in 1991 in two books. Oneentitled, UFO Crash At Roswell is co-authored by Don Schmitt, Director ofSpecial Investigations for CUFOS, and Kevin Randle, Captain, USAF Reserves.The other is by scientist Stanton Friedman and aviation writer, Don Berliner. Allfour are battle-tested UFO researchers. And lest we forget, it was Bill Moore(and co-author Charles Berlitz) with Stan Friedman whose spadeworkinvestigations put the \"Roswell Incident\" on the map in a book of that titlepublished in 1980.) As a specialist in crash/retrieval research, one might ask: Why not publish abook on Roswell by Stringfield? Frankly, I didn't do all the necessary field worklike the others to qualify. However, I have played a backseat role in thegathering and release of new material from sources such as Sappho Henderson;Beverly Bean whose father, Sergeant Melvin Brown, was a member of the 509thretrieval team; and \"Tim\" which will be used by my contemporaries to mesh insequentially with theirs. I begin my Roswell discourse with the Hendersons: the husband was the lateCaptain Oliver Wendelle Henderson known as \"Pappy\" among his crewmen inthe 509th Bomb Wing and Sappho, his wife. In separate ways, each gaveresearch not only new information about the incident, but for me, a new moralelift for my own endeavors. It was Pappy who transported the \"wreckage\" of thedowned saucer from Roswell to Wright Field in 1947. Sappho, alas, knowing hissecret, shared it with me for release in 1988 - with her name in my StatusReport V. At first unwilling to go public with her address and phone number,which of course I respected, Stan Friedman who was chagrined at my loyaltiesmanaged to track her down, convincing her to appear on TV's UnsolvedMysteries September 20, 1989, for her insight commentary as part of there-enactment of the incident. I'm glad for the enterprising Friedman and thecredibility of Sappho for bringing in new sources. There is more to the Henderson story - new backups. One is a dentist and formerNavy officer with whom Captain Henderson in a one-to-one exchange relatedtheir UFO experiences. The dentist, Dr. John Kromschroeder, who hadwitnessed a large orange globe hover over a fleet of warships at a Naval station"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"off coastal California during the Korean War in 1951 told me during a phoneinterview on February 4, 1990, that he regrets he did not press for more detailsabout his friend's experience when they met in 1977. But he clearly recallsHenderson talking about his flight to Wright Field with the saucer wreckage. Healso recalls his comment that bodies were retrieved, but is not sure if he said hehad seen them. Another backup is Vere McCarthy, formerly a first lieutenant who served withHenderson as bombardier in 30 missions in the 446 Bomb Group of the 8th AirForce in WWII. When I phoned McCarthy, who had retired from the military asa captain following the war, he verified that he heard firsthand his friend'stestimony about the secret flight to Wright Field. Remaining the best of friendsafter the war, he remembers getting a copy of a letter from Henderson of hiscommendation from General Spaatz and making mention of his newresponsibilities and a special security clearance. Said McCarthy, \"Maybe thatwas the reason he was chosen to fly the sensitive material to Wright Field.Although we reunited on a number of occasions, we never discussed Roswelluntil we met in Nashville in 1982. In his hotel room when five of his old crewgot together at our air division reunion - and making sure that our wives weren'tpresent - he told his tory but did not go into much detail.\" I asked McCarthy if his former pilot had mentioned seeing the bodies, but he didnot recall him saying that he did and added, \"However, he did say something tothe effect that they were badly deteriorated from exposure and gnawed at bypredators.\" McCarthy also recalls Henderson's comment about a civilian agencythat took jurisdiction over the case from the military, but he did not namenames. (More information will be in Status Report V, Case 10, initial reportsregarding Henderson and other Roswell informants.) My source for sharing this segment of Roswellian backup is John Reynolds, along-time correspondent and a vet from the old NICAP days. I received thefollowing notes from Reynolds, May 2, 1990, which I have edited on his requestto shield the identity of his source of command rank who, during their interview,brushed aside most leading questions because of the subject's Secretclassification. The source will be called Jack. John Reynolds Notes from source, Jack: \"He affirms awareness, fromfellow officers, of the shipment of a large crate on a flight piloted by PappyHenderson whom he knew personally. Jack slated the reason Pappy madethe flight was because he was the senior pilot at Roswell. \"When I first brought up the Roswell crash, Jack immediately said, 'Whichone?' He was very evasive after that statement. ...It was a rhetorical cat andmouse game. I came away feeling he was honestly drying to help meunderstand the situation which he knows a lot about, but could not revealin a direct manner.\" Len Stringfield: \"Which one?\" coming from a source in-the-know is a questionthat behooves Roswell scholars to dig deeper as new reports surface to suggestthat possibly more than two crashes did occur in New Mexico in the 1947 timeframe. Also challenging is the number of flights from Roswell with secretcargoes to other air bases and installations following the crash of July 2, 1947(date could be July 3 or 4) on the Max Brazel ranch. Apart from the establishedHenderson flight to Wright Field and another with Major Jesse Marcel aboard aB-29 full of debris that he gathered on the ranch site, there are enough facts andrumors to believe that as many as nine secret flights between July 8-9, 1947,including a B-29 transporting a crate (that) possibly contained the retrievedbodies to an Army Air base in Ft. Worth, Texas. I have firsthand witnesses of thishistoric flight which follows. \"We Are Now A Part of History\" Shortly after my Status Report V, UFO Crash Retrievals: Is the Cover-up Lid"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Lifting? was published in the January 1989 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal -with new sources that revitalized my interest in crash/retrieval research - BarryGreenwood, Editor of Just Cause, sent me a copy of a letter he had receivedfrom a source of possible interest in my line of research. \"It's about Roswell,\" hesaid, which I knew he viewed with some skepticism at that time and promptlysent me a copy and the green light to follow up. On January 26, 2989, I contacted the source in a western state and in short time,he agreed to work with me. Preferring anonymity, we agreed that he would beidentified as \"Tim.\" Excerpts from his \"introductory\" letter follow. Tim: \"On this day (July 9, 1947), our crew had not been on the flyingroster. We had accomplished our period of ground school in the morning,then went to the skeet range after lunch. The Aircraft Commander hadbroken 48 targets and I was next with 47 out of the 50. The Sergeant incharge of the range asked us if we had heard about the 'flying disc' that hadcrashed out in the desert. Twice more before leaving the skeet range, weheard reports of a spaceship with bodies inside that had been found on aranch in the area. When the truck dropped us off at the squadron area,most of the other crews had been released for the day. The operationsofficer told our captain to keep the crew together because he thought hehad a flight for us. We expected this was a last-minute test hop on a planeneeded for the next day's mission. I loved test hops, for on many of them,the pilot would let me be the co-pilot and sometimes I would get to make alanding. We were sent out to pre-flight our own airplane; we knew then it was notest flight. The pre-flight of a B-29 was a lengthy operation, requiring avisual pressure check of each engine's fuel system, plus many other details.An hour later, we were told to taxi the plane to the 'Pit,' a place where theatomic bomb was normally loaded. We were positioned so the frontbomb-bay was directly over the pit which was covered with a large tarp.But no atomic bomb was in the pit that afternoon. When the canvas wasremoved by the loading crew, all we could see was a very large woodenbox. We stood off to the side and were not allowed more than a glimpse ofthe loading process. The box was sitting on a platform of the type we oftenused on which to carry cargo. Once the load was secured in the bomb-bay,four military policemen went inside and took positions at each corner ofthe box. I think two of them were majors and one a lieutenant. The fourthman was an NCO. Three other officers of company and field grade werepositioned in the forward and aft crew compartments. The officer crewmembers went to base operations for flight clearance and briefing. Whenthey returned, only the bombardier was allowed to go in the bomb-bay andcheck the security of the load. The engineer and I had been given a cargoweight which I remember was no problem at all and no ballast wasrequired in the tail. So, my guess now is that it was less than five thousandpounds. Once airborne, we were told the destination was the AAFB at Ft. Worth,Texas. By now, we were aware that this was no routine cargo mission. Therank and number of the MPs were clues that we had something importanton board. One of our officers speculated that it was the household goodsof some high-ranking ground pounder being transferred to Ft. Worth. Thiswas a reasonable guess. I do not remember connecting it with the 'flyingdisc crash' story until we were on the way back. We left most of thesecurity people in Ft. Worth. I think only one or maybe two came backwith us. I do remember the strong lecture of this being a routine flight thatwe must not talk about. One of the crew, a very outspoken individual, saidon the way home that we were now a 'part of history.' He went on to sayhe knew it was the disc and remains of the flight crew because he had seena man he recognized in the reception group. This man was a mortician bymilitary specialty. For weeks, rumors were plentiful and we were hard pressed to maintain the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"silence we had been ordered to keep.\" Len Stringfield: If indeed, Tim's flight transported the bodies, then it fits wellinto the scenario that postulates that his was one among several missions fromRoswell. But to prove it, we might never have access to official records forobvious security reasons - if they still exist. According to Jesse Marcel, July 8, he flew in a B-29 to Ft. Worth. Notably, heidentified his cargo - not as a crate, but as a \"half B-29-full\" of fragments he hadcollected from the crash site on the Max Brazel ranch. Once at the air base, hisjob was done. General Roger Ramey, in charge of the operations, released thestory to the media that the downed saucer was actually a weather balloon andordered Marcel to return to Roswell, which he did the following day on July 9,1947. Of significance, Tim remembers Jesse Marcel. To refresh his memory, Tim wassent a copy of the 509th Bomb Group 1947 Yearbook and he recalled Marcel'spresence on the scene. But Tim is not sure where. Tim said, \"It's possible that he(Marcel) was one of the officers to greet my plane at Ft. Worth, but my preferredguess is that he was on my return flight to Roswell.\" Based on knowninformation, Marcel was probably unaware of the retrieved bodies at that timeand would not have a need-to-know-qualification to greet the plane. Crucial then, in coordinating the sequence of events, is the date of Tim's flight.Understandably, blurred by the passage of time and without any official 509threcords to substantiate such a secret mission, he was at first uncertain of thedate. \"One clue, for sure,\" he said, \"the weather that day was sunny and hotduring a season known for its thunderstorms.\" Then on October 5, 1990, Tim called. \"I found my diary. It was the 9th (of July,1947.) I found the dates of my flights out of Roswell, clearly circles on thecalendar inside the back cover which backs up my log entries for July 4th, 9th,26th, 28th and 29th.\"Continued in Part 4.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
