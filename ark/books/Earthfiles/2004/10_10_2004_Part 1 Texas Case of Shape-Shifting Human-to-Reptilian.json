One case was from a Missouri woman who saw a \"repulsive-looking entity with thinarms.\" Missouri artist, Lisa Dusenberry, sent a descriptive note and drawing she had madewith the eyewitness she called \"M.J.\" Drawing by \"M.J.,\" Springfield, Missouri, adult female. During alleged 1991 abduction,encountered 5'9\" reptilian creature. Drawing by Lisa Dusenberry after M. J.'s August 13, 1991, hypnosissession.Compare this drawing to description by R.S. in Texarkana case featured below. \"M. J. was in bed sleeping when she began floating out of bedroom toward a lightand through wall. Felt the sensation of being pulled by a force with fast movement. The being stood about 5'9\" with green body, looked scaly and rough. Felt electricitygoing through her hands. Saw pea-green eyes with pupils like a cat (vertical slits),black and yellow. Eyes slanted down toward outer face. No hair. Small mouth. Thinarms, hands like a duck with tan or brown webbing. Three or four long fingers withnails on end. After hypnosis, she felt that 'they need human beings to make them stronger. Tryingto get our genes - threat of dying out. Inbreeding with us to see if what we have canmake them stronger.\" Like so many other experiencers of the UFO abduction syndrome, the Missouri abducteedid not understand clearly what the survival problem is or why earth life should beinvolved in an alien species' regeneration. I talked about this drawing and several others I have received from alleged consciouseyewitnesses with Jim Marrs, author of several books, including Crossfire, An AlienAgenda, Rule By Secrecy and Inside Job. Jim became interested in the reptilian connection"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"to both the abduction phenomenon and ancient Sumerian and Egyptian history, which hediscussed in An Alien Agenda and Rule By Secrecy. Humanoid crocodiles such asSebek/Sobek in Egypt and Sumerian Ubaid figurines of large-eyed humanoids depictedwith reptilian scales are facts of ancient history. Sebek/Sobek embodied the power of the crocodile againstits prey and epitomized the military might of the pharaoh.Relief from Temple of Sebek and Horus by Kom Ombo.

Sumerian scholar, Zecharia Sitchin, writing in his \"Earth Chronicles\" series beginning withthe 1976 classic, The 12th Planet, to his 1993 book, When Time Began, describes theancient Annunaki \"gods\" of Sumeria as being reptilian and the manipulators of DNA inalready-evolving primates to create Homo sapiens workers on Earth to serve theAnnunaki. Cornell astronomer Carl Sagan's most famous book was Dragons of Eden, in which hedescribed the sudden jump in human intelligence that could not be explained by Darwinianevolution and seemed linked to a change in the \"lower reptilian\" region of evolvingprimate brains. \"Are Reptilian Entities Still Among Us Disguised AsHumans?\" On March 23, 1999, Jim Marrs called me and his voice was urgent. \"Linda, write down aphone number I'm going to give you and call it immediately. The woman expects to hearfrom you and I just want to know what you think after you've interviewed her.\" FollowingJim's instructions, I called the number he gave me, not having any idea what the subjectwould be. Now five and a half years later with the world in so much political and militarychaos, I share that interview in the spirit of the question the woman asked me: \"Arereptilian entities still among us disguised as humans?\" Jim Marrs and I hope that Earthfiles viewers, who might have had a similar experience"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"which has not been shared for fear of ridicule, will contact me in confidence.

My goal at Earthfiles is always to deepen understanding aboutearth mysteries. The interview below begins after R.S. explained she had described for Jimtwo conscious encounters with what she perceived to be reptilian beings disguised ashuman females.Interview, March 23, 1999:R. S., Housewife with 4 children, 61-years-old in 1999, Texarkana region of Texas:\"The first encounter I had was many years ago, around 1965. I had four children and theywere all down with the measles at one time. My daughter, Mary (pseudonym) she lovedschool and she wanted a poster. They were trying for a poster to win a $25 Savings Bond.She said, 'Mother, make me a poster,' hoping she would win. Which she did not, I mightadd. But anyway, I told her I would go to the library and see if we could work some posterthat I thought could win. So, I went to the library.While I was there reading, I was sitting at a rectangular, long table. I had been reading forat least an hour, maybe longer. I heard this gasp from the room. I looked up and in walkedin one of the most striking, beautiful women that I had ever seen in my life. She was verytall. I would say she was close to 6 feet tall. She had on heels. She had masses of red hairpiled on top in an upswept hairdo, which made her look even taller. She was absolutelyregal looking. As I told Jim Marrs, I'm sure her suit cost more than my car. I knew verylittle about fashion and that type clothing, but you could tell by looking that she wasimpeccably tailored in every way, that everything about her was money well put together,perfect skin. She looked like a movie star to me.She come and sat down on the other end of the rectangular table. I was watching her alongwith most of the other women and a few other men in there. And I noticed that she keptgazing at me. She did not stare as if hard looking, but when I looked up at her, she wassimply and calmly looking at me without let up.I was feeling unkempt, according to her standards. It was like I wondered if I was dressedright. I felt ill at ease. I felt awkward because here was this gorgeous creature staring atme. I felt like a peasant in front of a queen, if you want the truth. She asked me afterseveral minutes of this uncomfortable gazing at me it was not really asking as much as astatement of fact 'Would I come and talk with her?'I got up and went and I've often wondered why I went. It was not a command in the senseof 'Get your rear end up here.' And yet, there was force behind it, is all I can tell you. Isimply got up and went.She said, 'We're going to talk about you,' or something like that. She said, 'Your namebegins with 'R,' does it not?'I said, 'Yes, my name is R.'She told me that I had four red-headed children, which I did and do. She told me my firstchild was born black-headed and turned red later. Absolute fact. I said yes to all thesestatements, dumbfounded and amazed. I can't even tell you my emotions at the time. Ithink I was intimidated by her looks, by her interest in me and by this 'force' is all I can tellyou, Linda. I don't know how to explain it any better than that.She told me I would get a divorce in 1980, which was several years after this 1965 event inthe library. She said I would marry a man whose first name would begin with a 'J.' I said,'OK,' thinking this may or may not come to pass, kind of filing things away that she wassaying.She told me that I had a mission, something to do with reptilians. To my knowledge, thatwas the first time I had ever heard the word 'reptilians,' as in a being or entity.She asked me if I knew what a 'coven' was. I said, 'No, ma'am, I don't.' And she said, 'It'slike a wiccan.' She did not use the word 'witch.' She said, 'Wiccan.' I said, 'No, ma'am, I'mnot familiar with that.' She said, 'It's the study and love of Earth and how to work withEarth energies.' Basically she confounded me. I was not even vaguely familiar with theterms she was using about anything she spoke. It was like I was speaking one language andshe was speaking totally over my head, other than the questions and statements about mychildren.Then she told me that the number 13 would be very powerful for me. I asked her, 'Why?'She said something about the number 13 was not understood, that it was a very powerfulnumber and that in time I would understand what the number 13 meant. Then she took outwhat you and I would call a business card, except it was blank on both sides. She told me"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"that when I was totally alone to do this spell (which she hand wrote on the card) and Iwould get great understanding about my mission, or something to that effect. The exactwords, I have actually forgotten.Well, Linda, I had four children. I have a retarded son. My first child is a genius, mysecond child is retarded. Then, I have two normal children. I was never alone, never, and ittook seven years for this to be - for me to have a free moment when I could do what shewrote on the card.One night, it dawned on me for the first time in years I was going to be alone. My kidswere a little older, they had things to do. My baby daughter, the one that lives down hereby me now my mother was going to take her and spend the night. My husband workednights and I thought, 'I'm alone. I'm going to find that card.' Finally, I found it and she hadtold me to draw a pentagram big enough to put a chair in it. The only warning she gave mewas that until the spell was complete, no matter what I seen and heard, I should neverleave the chair. If I did, I could die.I think part of the reason that I never tried it is that some part of me was scared eventhough some part of me was drawn to it. But on some level, there was still a great deal offear.We were building a den and bedroom on at the time. The den was finished and thebedroom was not. It had one complete wall up with sheet rock and a partial wall with sheetrock, so we had a couple of blank walls and it was still in the process of being finished. Iwent in there, drew the pentagram with chalk approximately 5 feet diameter. I took mychair into it. She told me to take an offering in. I thought, 'What is an offering?' The onlyoffering I could think of was that I had a cake cooked. I took a piece of cake, put it on asaucer and went in there. I had looked at the card many times over the seven years andrealized I did not know how to pronounce the words. She wrote the words and gave me thecard and told me when I was alone, this is what I was to do. Draw the pentagram, put thechair in it, do not leave, give the offering, do the chanting, repeat the words, and I wouldget a clue to my mission in life.WHO WERE YOU OFFERING THE CAKE TO?She did not say and I was dumb enough not to ask. I honestly did not know. At the time Iwas doing it, I was fearful and a little risqué. I thought, 'I'm going to have a kick. It's goingto be a delight. It's a little bit scary.' The whole thing was like an apex of something thathad come to pass that allowed for this to happen that I cannot tell you why, when, whereor under what circumstances, except what I'm telling you. \"Upright Alligator\"I got in the pentagram. I put the chair in. I repeated the words as best as I could, whichwas silly words I thought. They were certainly not normal English words that you and Iwould hear normally. I had very long hair at the time. The doors were shut, the windowswere shut. And yet this wind came up (and blew my hair). I became very fearful. I realizedon some level that something was happening that I could not control. I closed my eyes andremember thinking that I had not prayed in a long time, but this was probably a great timeto start. I remember trying to look at it as a kick, something to be laughed about later. Butthe wind was undeniably real. It was frightening. I was scared. I shut my eyes severaltimes. At one time, I don't know for how long because I don't remember how long I hadthem shut. But when I opened my eyes and I know this sounds totally bizarre but standingbefore me and I was sitting in a dining room chair standing before me slightly taller thanhead-high. I'm a tall woman, 5'8.5\". If I were sitting in a chair, I would still be nearly 5 feettall in an upright position. Standing before me is what you and I would call an 'uprightalligator.' Except that it did not appear frightening in the sense like it was going to attack.It had this steady stare just like the woman (in library) did, just like her.DO YOU KNOW IF HER EYES AND THE ALLIGATOR'S EYES HAD VERTICALPUPILS, AS OPPOSED TO ROUND?No, I don't. I don't remember her eyes being any different than your or my eyes. Thealligator's eyes was red I do know that, and they had the vertical up and down pupils. Inoticed that, but I immediately shut my eyes. Unbeknownst to me at the time, my daughterhad gotten sick to her stomach and my mother had brought her back home. My motherknew, of course, that I was in the house, so she let my daughter come through the houseyelling, 'Mama, where are you?' She come to the back of the den where I was and sheopened the door and yelled, 'Mama!'I said, 'Don't!' And at the time I yelled 'Don't!' the wind was so fierce that at first it"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"knocked my daughter down, kind of on her back hip to the side. She got up on her kneesand I said, 'Oh, God!' I was just I don't know I went through such a period of fear there. AllI can tell you is that I was praying loud and long and I know that sounds comical, but it'sthe truth.WAS THE BEING STILL STANDING THERE?No, when I opened my eyes again, the being was gone, my cake was gone, my saucer wasgone, and the saucer never came back. My daughter was very scared for a couple of days.She had to sleep with me.DID SHE SEE THE BEING?You know, I asked her and I don't know. I don't really know. I know she kept havingnightmares for several days. She wanted to sleep with a light on or sleep with me. I don'tknow, Linda.THE TIMING OF HER COMING HOME IS ODD, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO GO BACKTO THE EYES. CAN YOU PLEASE GIVE ME A DESCRIPTION IN TERMS OFSOMETHING I MIGHT KNOW OF THE RED THAT YOU WERE LOOKING AT?The eyes were red, Linda, is all I can tell you.DID THEY GLOW? OR WAS IT A RED LIKE A TOMATO SKIN?I'm going to say more red like you would look at a tomato skin. And yet, they had a powerthat was directed. You felt power from this creature. And yet, I can honestly look back andI was scared to death. I don't know what I thought that I could conjure up, but whatever, itcertainly was not that!WHEN YOU REMEMBER BEFORE YOUR DAUGHTER CAME HOME AND YOUARE LOOKING EYE-TO-EYE AT AN APPROXIMATE 4.5 TO 5 FOOT TALLALLIGATOR WITH THE RED EYES, WITH VERTICAL PUPILS LIKE A SNAKE'SOR CROCODILE'S DO YOU REMEMBER ANY IMPRESSION IN YOUR MIND OFEITHER A THOUGHT VOICE, OR OF SYMBOLS, OR OF IMAGES OF ANYTHING?(long pause) No, I can't say a thought. Right now, I can't remember a symbol. The onlything I can honestly tell you that over the years, I felt like it was communicating with me.And yet I cannot tell you why or how, but communication, yes.WHAT WAS THE RESIDUE INSIDE YOURSELF AFTER THAT INCIDENT IN TERMSOF THE QUESTION: WHAT IS MY MISSION?I don't know. At the time, it was so far fetched, above and beyond anything I had everthought, assumed, dreamed or dealt with. Linda. It was like I had been dropped off theface of the Earth or I had never encountered before and had nothing to relate to it with. Ihonestly don't know. It was so fearful that for a time I don't think I did want to deal with it.I think I almost retarded learning from it from my fear. It was only later, probably two orthree years later, that I began to see what this meant. (Around 1975) I would go back tothe library often, just to see if I could see the red-haired woman again (from the 1965library table). I was too scared to coherently think of anything. I asked myself, 'Why didthis happen? Why did she pick me? What did this mean?' I couldn't answer any of thosequestions. It was a foreign thing.ANY DREAMS AFTER THE INCIDENT WITH THE LIZARD OR REPTILE?The only dream I can specifically remember having after that several weeks after that, Itook a terrible cold, flu, the usually bad aches, pains. My mother came to stay with thekids. One night I had the electric blanket on, even though it was warm weather. I still feltcold. I could hear mother in there with the kids playing a game with them. Linda, I sawsomething standing by the side of the bed that was pale green. I took it as a form which Icannot tell you what it was, but it was like a reassuring form. When I told my mother aboutit, she thought it was due to the fever and I had a bad dream. But I did not believe I wasasleep at the time.WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THE BEING WHEN YOU HAD THE WIND BLOWINGAROUND YOU AND YOU SAT ON THE CHAIR IN THE PENTAGRAM?Yellow-green.YELLOW-GREEN WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?More of a yellow-green than a green.THINK OF SOMETHING I MIGHT KNOW THAT WOULD BE CLOSE."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Take a shade of emerald green and a shade of lime green with yellow mixed. It had scales.It looked just like if we had gone to the zoo and seen an upright alligator with red eyes,gazing at you as in total curiosity, and yet trying to communicate its essence with you.That's all I can ever come to.WHEN WAS THE SECOND INCIDENT?\"Continued in Part 2Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
