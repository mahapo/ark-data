Len Stringfield: \"I am indebted to Tim Cooper again, this time for his story on 'Barnabas,'age 87, who passed 'way December 31, 1990, in Big Bear Lake, California. Said the localnewspaper, Grizzly, on January 10, 1991, 'The Valley watchdog is gone. Albert BruceCollins, known as Barnabas, passed away on New Year's Eve.' Described as a friend of lawenforcement who always had something to report to deputies, the stoop-shouldered manwith white hair and trailing beard to match was found by a repairman coming to fix theheater at the apartment where he was staying. Barnabas had called 911 early in themorning on New Year's Eve to report an odor of gas. The dispatchers on duty saidBarnabas sounded sick and sent an ambulance as well, according to detective, TomBradford, of the Big Bear's Sheriff Station. Cooper's interview with Barnabas was November 20, 1990! (Month before death) In hisinterview, which lasted for three hours, without benefit of an audio recorder and dependingon notes, Timothy said that Barnabas was a metallurgical engineer and retired governmentemployee. His questions and answers, in part, follow: Interview with Albert Bruce Collins, aka \"Barnabas,\" provided by TimothyCooperCooper's Interview Date: November 20, 1990, one month before \"Barnabas\"Albert Collins died.Location: Big Bear Lake, California. Q. What do you know about UFOs? A. That they exist and are real. Q. Why do you say that? A. Because I saw one in 1947. It was on a long flatbed trailer covered with a greentarp being backed into a large warehouse at Berkeley. Q. What did you see? A. It looked oval-shaped. Kind of flat all around the edge. I later saw it again withthe tarp off. It looked like an egg with its shell cracked ... with the yoke still inside. Itlooked like the craft sustained an internal explosion ... the metal skin appeared to bepushed out ... polished aluminum with a silvery-looking finish. It had a seam at theedge all around. There was a lot of damage ... like a large section ripped off ... a big"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"gash on top running down the side below the seam. It had a gold-like finish on theunderside. Q. What did it look like inside? A. From my vantage point (from approx. 100 ft.), it had a bulkhead in front withmulti-layer skin (honeycombed). It was dark inside. In the center, there was a shinysphere surrounded by another bulkhead. There was a forward compartment; did notknow what it was. Q. How big was it? A. 30-40 ft. in diameter and approximately 15 ft. high at the center. Q. Can you tell me who you saw there? What you were doing there? A. Can't tell you that. (Collins did not want to go any further. He wanted to talkabout other things.) Albert Collins Studied Metal of Unknown Composition and Origin Q. What was your involvement with Berkeley? A. Worked on developing metal alloys used for electro-magnetic propagation andmagnetic propulsion. I worked for Berkeley and Occidental College for theManhattan Project from 1942 to the late fifties. They sent fragments to the lab foranalysis. We could not identify the composition, origin or mode of manufacture.Before we could complete our tests, the Army came and took the samples awaywithout an explanation. Q. Can you describe the samples? A. As best I can recall, it was a dull finish metal on the one side like aluminum andvery shiny on the other side. It was thin and very light. It could be flexed, but notdented on impact. We could not separate its metals through any assay we knew of. Itwas fire and cold resistant. Could not be cut or punctured. Some pieces were big withslight curvature to them. Other pieces were very small. One piece was very big andabout one inch thick. It was jagged, like it had been part of a structure that had beenhit by high explosives. it had burn marks, but no scratches which was very odd. Youcould fold it and it would extend back to its original shape. Link Between Manhattan ProjectAtomic Bomb Development and UFO Sightings Hiroshima, Japan: The huge atomic cloud August 6, 1945. A uranium bomb, the first nuclearweapon in the world, was dropped on Hiroshima City. It was estimated that its energy was equivalentto15 kilotons of TNT. Aerial photograph from 80 kilometers away from the Inland Sea,taken about one hour after the drop. Photograph by US Army. Q. Is there a connection between UFO sightings (1942-1946) and the development ofthe atomic bomb?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"A. I attended seminars at Berkeley on 'shell' designs for advanced ordnance programs(he thinks that these seminars were designed to recruit engineers for the ManhattanProject).

Agencies involved: Rand Corporation, CIA, Intelligence officers from theUnited States Army, Air Force and Navy. The Vatican was invited to adviseU.S. government on religious implications (Spellman, Holy See and VaticanSecretary of State).

Stringfield: This is a portion of an interview with Albert Collins concerning his knowledgeof a classified study conducted in 1949 by the Rand Corporation, CIA and solicitedcomments from a Vatican representative. Q. What do you know of a covert effort to learn of the origins of UFOs/recoveredspacecraft and bodies? A. There was a rumor circulating around a small group of scientists that a secretstudy was underway to evaluate the UFO sightings and supposed recovery ofspacecraft and their crews. I knew this because the rumors were coming out of LosAlamos, from people coming back to California. I saw some notes from a friend ofmine. He told me that New Mexico was abuzz with unusual research into nuclearpowered aircraft and bizarre biological experiments. Some people were losing theirclearances for no apparent reasons. Project Archangel and Blue, Black, White and Yellow Books I saw the word 'Archangel' and other words that described four projects that had'Blue, Black, White and Yellow prefixed to the word Book.' It was not clear whatthese four colors meant. I was told that these colors represented the 'nature' of thestudies. I remember something about an astronomer being asked to help identify thegreen fireballs and strange debris being found in the desert. All I know is that thescary feelings everybody had who was asked to do experiments on stuff that nobodyever saw before and how we were later threatened if we talked about anything wesaw, felt or heard. Q. What kind of rumors did you hear? A.- Autopsies of midget people with mongoloid heads that were accidentallyexposed to high doses of radiation at Los Alamos. - Nuclear reactors being used in aircraft. - Failed nuclear-powered tests on experimental aircraft that killed pilots andground crews at Muroc, California, and at Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, NewMexico. - Atomic Energy Commission control of experiments at Los Alamos, HollomanAFB and Kirtland AFB installations. - Unusual 'metal-like wood' being tested and results fed into a computer atBerkeley, California. - Security was unbearable. Everyone being followed, watched, spied on. Hadto sign loyalty oaths just to keep job. - Military were into everything. - Flying disks were landing on military bases in California and New Mexicoand they were not ours."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" - Everyone with clearances were afraid to ask or talk. It was better to not workfor MED or APC. Q. What did your friend tell you about the Archangel study? A. Three things: 1) They (EBEs) were biological, gas-breathing, intelligent animalsthat have craniums larger than Homo-sapiens. They have vascular systems, skeletalstructures (calcite), possessing a form of manual dexterity like humans; 2) They havea cell-like constitution somewhat like plants that are responsive to sunlight; 3) Theyare human-like possessing an ability to make right and wrong judgments. THE AIR FORCE COLONEL OPERATIONS OFFICER The following information is from a retired U. S. Air Force colonel who was in a keyposition to know some of the critical UFO issues facing the military establishmentduring the Roswell era. His disclosures were obtained February 10, 1991, and clearedfor use in this report by Tim Cooper, as follows:Q. What kind of UFO sighting reports were at Pentagon in 1945-1951? Col.- Classified Double Top Secret .(Stringfield: Classification categoryunknown)- Foo Fighters in 1945-1946.- Thought they were German.- Utilized nuclear power in some way not understood.- Composed of metals and plastics not known on Earth.- Detected many bogies in and around Los Alamos and Roswell doingover 4,000 m.p.h. at 20,000 to 40,000 ft. altitude. Q. What was U.S. Air Force's reaction? Col. Panic. Fear of unknown. Thought they were Russian of captured Germantechnology. Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit Q. Did you know of the IPU (Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit)? Col. I knew that Army G-2 had such a unit in the war to monitor the FooFighters. Worked with Project Silverplate. Did not know its name. There was aspecial intelligence organization headed by Doolittle, maybe.

Photograph from French WWII historyfile. 1940s - American Atomic and Space Research Q. Were there experiments being conducted using atomic power for Top Secretaircraft? Col. Yes. In 1946-1949, at Los Alamos and Sandia Labs. Possibly atAlamogordo and Kirtland. There were secret Navy testing at sea utilizing crudefission reactors for high voltage energy experiments. Also, there were atomic reactors being put into aircraft. The experimentsfailed. Some died from radiation exposure. Q. Did the Air Force recover 'flying disks'? Col. Yes. Some were found in 1946 and 1947. Some in Mohave Desert andsome in New Mexico. Q. Where were these 'disks' taken to? Col. Some to Muroc and others to Langley. They wanted to know what theywere made of and how they worked. Q. What were these things that were taken to Muroc and Edwards? Col. They were 'lifting bodies.' They looked like inverted bathtubs. It wasassumed that they were some kind of 'pod' or short-range recon probes. Q. Who was in charge of the scientific research? Col. (Werner) Von Braun, (Edward) Condon, (Robert) Oppenheimer and(Edward) Teller. There were many technicians (civilian and military) regularlycoming to watch and learn. The Pentagon was being briefed weekly on thenew developments. Q. Did they find out how the lifting bodies worked and on what technology? Col. No. They theorized on the ability to achieve the speed of light and utilizedmagnetic lines of force. They made some gains in understanding how toharness an energy source greater than the hydrogen bomb and how it waspossible to reach speeds of 6 miles per second in the earth's atmosphere. In 1948, they were learning how to recover people back from space and by1959, how to re-enter from orbit. This knowledge led to the shuttledevelopment. Q. How did they learn how to apply this technology? Col. They had help. Q. Who? Col. The same one who helped them develop the bomb."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Q. Who? Col. No comment. Q. How did the Air Force benefit from all this? Col. Highly experimental ram-jet technology was tested at Muroc that wasclassified Above Top Secret (Ultra). Also, heat compression technologies weredeveloped at Edwards for some special spacecraft designs. Project Blue Book Q. Why did the Air Force initiate Project Blue Book? Col. Mainly for public relations. Basically, the Air Force wanted to gatherUFO intelligence on a low-level so as not to tip off the Russians of anyintensive efforts by the United States in developing high technology weapons.By that time, the Air Force had accepted the fact that there was a higherintelligence beyond ours. Only a dozen or so people in the U. S. governmentknew anything about the sighting reports and recoveries of these 'liftingbodies.' So it's not surprising that lower level Air Force officials did not knowof the highly classified intelligence operations being conducted at that time. Aslong as the public was convinced that the Air Force was just as curious as thepublic was, it was the perfect cover. Q. Was there any UFO activity during the war within the U. S.? Col. There was some pilot sightings and by bomber crews who were in trainingin B-29s (Project Silverplate) that worried the Pentagon. Unofficially, somehad speculated that Dr. Vannevar Bush and others were involved in some kindof aeronautical designs that were unconventional aircraft by any standardsknown at that time. President Roosevelt had authorized a great deal of moneyinto 'lifting-bodies' technology that was associated with the Manhattan Projectand ultimately with military applications. Embassy and military communications from Japan and Germany wereconstantly being intercepted and deciphered. I think some of the reports weredealing with Foo Fighters or new spy weapons in the MAJIC networkoperations. 1938 War of the Worlds Radio Testof Public Reaction to Extraterrestrial Invasion of Earth In 1938, it was believed that the Army G-2 wanted to test the response of thecivilian population by monitoring the CBS radio broadcast of Orson Wells'sWar of the Worlds. Of course, this did create widespread panic in some areas. The New York Times front page headline on Monday, October 31, 1938, after Orson Wellsproduced theWar of the Worlds fictional radio broadcast that many listeners thought was literally happening. 1945 - Large, Unidentified Black ObjectsOver Los Alamos, New Mexico Lab Cut Off Power There were, on several occasions, sightings of huge black objects hoveringover Los Alamos in early 1945 which caused severe power blackouts that"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"could not be explained. Wendover AFB, Utah was kept informed of thisbecause it was feared that unknown radio propagation could effect thedetonation of 'Fat Man' and 'Little Boy.' (The two atomic bombs U. S. droppedon Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945). This was not recorded in the securityfiles for fear of generating panic in Washington. Officially, Los Alamosidentified it with 'atmospheric anomalies' and left it that way. Some identified itas storm cloud and electrical storm effects. It was never clear what caused thesudden surge of radiation detection or electrical shorts. 1945 - Unknown Radio Signal Affected Hiroshima Atom Bomb The first atomic bomb almost prematurely detonated en route to Hiroshimawhen an unknown radio signal almost armed and activated the detonation andtrigger mechanisms. It was not known how it happened. The system wascorrected. Q. Were there other Air Force investigations other than Blue Book? Col. Yes. Q. What were they? Col. Black Sky intelligence operations utilizing high altitude aircraft such asX-2, X-15 and U-2 aircraft. High altitude, long trajectory rockets equipped with all kinds of cameras andsensing equipment. Television was used on some rockets. White Sands and theCape were the launch sites from 1947 into the late 1950s. All data wereclassified in a report called, I think, 'Blackbook' or 'Black-Sky.' Vatican Files and Photographs of UFOs I heard of another Air Force project that looked into all the historical recordsconcerning UFO sightings from all over the world. Some of the records werefrom libraries, newspapers, folklore, mythologies, government records ofunusual reports from farmers, lighthouse workers and so forth. There was talkthat the Vatican holds numerous files of sightings going back to the fifteenthcentury. The Vatican also has photographs that clearly depict craft of unusualshapes and sizes that are the 1915 period. No one can gain access to thiscollection. It was rumored that the Vatican even has a UFO locked up in one ofthe vault rooms inside the Vatican Basilica and would not let the U. S. AirForce see it or photograph it. This study was called the 'Whitebook.' There was a scientific study that began sometime in early 1948 that involvedthe astronomical community. I only read a brief memo from Vandenberg thatsolar astronomy became a concern or was attractive to the Air Force forlearning about cosmic radiation effects on aviation electronics. \"Black Sky:\" Loss of American Pilots and AircraftTrying to Intercept UFOs Over Military Installations These projects were canceled after the Air Force experienced loss of pilots andaircraft while trying to respond to air space violations of UFOs over sensitivemilitary and AFC installations.

Stringfield: The Colonel's reference to the Foo Fighter needs clarification. DuringWWII, these aerial interlopers, often described as highly maneuverable silver disksor self-luminous globes, were frequently witnessed by allied airmen starting in late1943, mainly over war zones. In the European Theater of Operations, they werecalled 'Kraut fireballs' and as the number of encounters increased in Europe andAsia, U. S. Air Force Intelligence surmised that they were a new ingenious Germanweapon. Their objective? Theories ranged from intelligence gathering surveillance tojam engines, to render radar ineffective, or to cause psychological disorientation. Surprise! When Germany surrendered in May 1945, the Foo Fighters persistedthroughout the Pacific Theater right up to the final days of the Japanese surrender. Iknow because I saw three of them approach my aircraft, a C-46, with twelve GIpassengers, while flying near Iwo Jima on August 27, 1945. This famous islandbattleground was my stopover prior to landing at the Atsugi Air Base near Tokyo,four days before the war officially ended. Incidentally, the second C-46 following myflight, crashed mysteriously into Mt. Fuji; all passengers were killed. I will notbelabor my experience here, as the story is basically described in my books: InsideSaucer Post 3-0 Blue and in Situation Red: The UFO Siege. Apparently, the Colonel used the (generic) name 'Foo Fighter' loosely just as we inresearch have loosely used the term 'Roswell' (signifying UFO crash/retrieval cases).The Colonel's mention of General Jimmy Doolittle as heading up the investigation ofthe phenomena should probably be in reference to the 'ghost rockets,' anothermystery device that penetrated Scandinavian skies in 1945 and 1946, sometimescrashing. Like the Foo Fighters, early belief was that the rockets were a high-techdevice that might have been developed by the Germans. But, when the war ended,the remaining German Luftwaffe pilots who had also encountered the strange craft,thought they were American. In summary, take your choice - Foo Fighter, Flying Saucer, Lifting Body or UFO.They are all of the same unknown origin. To those who want to argue the point thatthe Germans were capable, or did build a disc-like device, one might add that justmaybe they got the concept from a crashed extraterrestrial spaceship. But seriously,while the Colonel presents extensive information showing official concern for thepervasive UFO, he carefully avoids data that confirm origin/s. Perhaps, then, it issignificant when he states that the Talon Gold and Teal Ruby projects were a directresult of satellite recon photos of orbiting spacecraft of unknown origins.\" Continued in Part 9.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Refund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
