It's going to be fascinatingbeyond words to get up close and personal with this thing.\" Steve Squyres, LeadMars Mission ScientistTop two color segments of wide panorama image taken of \"first bedrock seen on anotherplanet beyond Earth\" by the Opportunity rover from its position still inside the lander.Third black and white is a slite blow-up of the panorama for more detail. Image credit:NASA/JPL.January 28, 2004 Pasadena, California Opportunity - so far - is operatingwell despite a heating problem in its robotic arm which JPL engineers aremonitoring, not certain if the heat can harm the rover. But if all goes well,Opportunity is expected several days from now to roll out of its position insidethe lander and out on to the hematite-rich soil of Meridiani Planum andapproach the rock slabs to drill for content. Scientists believe the estimated18-inch thick layered rocks are either volcanic ash deposits or sediments laiddown by wind or water.If these rock slabs are confirmed to be sedimentary in origin after Opportunitydrills into one or more, that would provide the first up-close evidence that waterwas on this Meridiana Planum and therefore, Mars once upon a time had to havebeen a somewhat watery planet.In the meantime, this week Opportunity is scheduled to use its mini-thermalemissions spectrometer to measure infrared radiation of the rocks to see whatminerals it can detect. And 6,600 miles around on the other side of Mars in theGusev crater, the other rover, Spirit, is slowly improving its ability to operate as"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"NASA/JPL scientists deleted hundreds of stored files not necessary for geologywork that apparently overloaded the robot's computer and caused Spirit to stoptransmitting data back on January 21, 2004.We b s it e s :http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/all/opportunity.htmlhttp://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.htmlhttp://www.esa.int/export/esaCP/index.htmlhttp://athena.cornell.eduCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
