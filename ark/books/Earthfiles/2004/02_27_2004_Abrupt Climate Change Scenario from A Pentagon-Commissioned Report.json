February 27, 2004 New York City, New York - One year ago at the Office ofNet Assessment in the Pentagon, its director - Andrew Marshall - read the 2002National Academies of Sciences study entitled Abrupt Climate Changes:Inevitable Surprises. Scientists have been warning for years that uncontrolledbuild up of carbon dioxide around the Earth could heat up the planet so muchthat drought, flooding, high winds, more severe storms, food shortages and warsover water might result. However, global warming and potentially rapid climatechange have been controversial and politically unacceptable to discuss in thiscurrent Bush Administration which has also rejected proposals to controlcarbon dioxide emissions.So why did one of the oldest and most respected employees of the Pentagon payfor a study entitled,An Abrupt Climate Change Scenario and Its Implications for United StatesNational Security? Andrew Marshall is 82-years-old and has been Director ofthe Defense Department's Office of Net Assessment since the early 1970s. ToWashington insiders, he is often referred to as \"Yoda,\" the brilliant andinscrutable wise being in the Star Wars movies. According to one of theco-author's on the study hired by the Pentagon - Peter Schwartz, Chairman ofGlobal Business Networks (GBN) of Emeryville, California - Andrew Marshallasked him: \"Suppose the abrupt (climate change) guys are right? What wouldhappen?\" Schwartz and his colleague, Doug Randall, had written futuristscenarios for the Pentagon before.In their Executive Summary of their report, Schwartz and Randall wrote: \"Thepurpose of this report is to imagine the unthinkable - to push the boundaries ofcurrent research on climate change so we may better understand the potentialimplications on United States national security. ... We have created a climatechange scenario that although not the most likely, is plausible, and wouldchallenge United States national security in ways that should be consideredimmediately.\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The scenario the futurists feature is a change in the current of the Atlantic Oceanthat now keeps Great Britain and parts of Europe warmer than they otherwisewould be at their northern latitudes. Further, the futurists project the possibilityof the warm current stopping its circulation by 2020 only sixteen years fromnow.It is curious that the 22-page study quietly shelved in the Pentagon sinceOctober 2003 and then suddenly leaked to The Observer in London andFortune Magazine for news release on Sunday, February 22. Every climatescientist I have interviewed this week is surprised. On Monday, February 23 -perhaps because of the shock and confusion that the study's release provoked -Andrew Marshall's Pentagon office released this statement, \"The DefenseDepartment continuously looks ahead to ensure that we are prepared in thefuture for any contingency.\"North Atlantic Drift Warm Current Speeds Color CodedFrom the lower left of the graph upward toward the brown and gray British Isles andwestern Europe,the measured buoy speeds of Atlantic current trajectories are color-coded from low speedsin purples and darkblue colors to high speeds in red and magenta.

The authors ofthe Pentagonstudy suggest a North Atlantic Drift (thermohaline circulation) collapse might be imminent,as the North Atlantic"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"is increasingly being freshened by surrounding seas that have become less salty over thepast 40 years.Adapted from I. Yashayaev, Bedford Institute of Oceanography as seen in Abrupt ClimateChanges,Inevitable Surprises, 2002 National Academies of Sciences National Research Council.Among the several leading scientists and institutions I went to for comment, theonly person who had received a copy of the abrupt climate change scenariostudy was Wally Broeker, Ph.D., Professor of Geochemistry and Earth Sciencesat Columbia University where he has worked since he received his doctorate inearth sciences back in 1958. A half century later, his research lab is in theLamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, New York, and Dr. Broeker isconsidered one of the world's pre-eminent experts on the dynamic between theoceans and the global climate. He has been irritated by the BushAdministration's dismissal of global warming as \"total nonsense,\" as stated by anOklahoma Senator. So he was especially surprised that the future scenariofeatured in the Pentagon's study is Europe plunged into a cold Siberian ice age ifthe warm water current of the Atlantic Ocean known as the North Atlantic Driftshould stop.What could stop the warm current from circulating around Great Britain andEurope? A drop in the salt content of the ocean waters. What could change thesaltiness so much that the Atlantic warm water drift might stop circulating?Large quantities of fresh water. And what could put large quantities of freshwater into the Atlantic Ocean? That's where a lot of scientific debate persistsand no one knows for certain what could happen. Some think that all theglaciers melting around the world and running off into the oceans could do it.Professor Broecker is not so certain. Which is why he is concerned that the rapidclimate change scenario featured in the Pentagon study focuses on thepotentially devastating consequences if the warm water conveyor belt in theAtlantic should stop. Prof. Broecker and other scientists think thisadministration and the world should be concentrating right now on reducingcarbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere in order to prevent such a scenariofrom happening in the first place.Interview: Wally Broeker, Ph.D., Professor of Geochemistry and Earth Sciences,Columbia University, New York, New York, and Lamont-Doherty EarthObservatory, Palisades, New York: \"Who are they speaking for in thePentagon? I can't imagine they are speaking for the Bush Administration. TheBush Administration must be upset about this.IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT ALL OF YOU IN THE SCIENCE COMMUNITYWERE CAUGHT OFF GUARD ABOUT THE RELEASE OF THISPENTAGON REPORT?I certainly was. I had no idea it was being done. The specifics stun me. I haven'tread it very carefully, but the fact they think they can make definite statementsabout how it's going to effect various regions of the world is to me outlandish.Again, they could be right in some respects. But we're not up to that point inmaking scenarios that have any meaning. So why they are doing this? I don'tknow.But I would think that certainly the Pentagon ought to think about this! Becausea lot of aspects, the whole world is closely tied together that anything thathappens climate-wise can have like if China were to have continuing droughts sothat it couldn't produce enough grain to feed itself, it would start buying grain.We supply half of the world's grain or something, so we would be selling theChinese grain that would raise our food prices and so forth. The whole situationis really complex. It's good that the Pentagon is thinking about it."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The chart above outlines some potential military implications of climate change in the years2010-2020. Source: An Abrupt Climate Change Scenario and Its Implications for UnitedStatesNational Security by Peter Schwartz and Doug Randall, October 2003.AS A SCIENTIST WHO HAS BEEN DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES FORDECADES, DO YOU THINK IN YOUR OWN MIND THOUGH THAT YOUARE WORRIED ABOUT WHERE THINGS WILL BE IN ANOTHER 20 TO50 YEARS?Yes, I am. Will the warming involve a reorganization of the Earth's system ashappened during glacial times? And if it reorganizes, will it plunge Europe intoextreme cold? By adding CO2 to the atmosphere, we threaten to change theclimate substantially. Unfortunately, there is enough uncertainties in makingsimulations with regard to the impact of CO2 that the range of possibility isquite large. I mean, as some would like to believe, the impacts could be somoderate that we would not have to do anything about it.At the other end of the spectrum would be a major warming coupled with areorganization of the climate system that has happened over and over duringglacial times and this would produce the maximum effect and certainly have direimpacts on wildlife around the world. And it would also play havoc withagriculture. There would be no doubt about that.What I think is that the world is not ready yet to make a major step to dosomething about this and the Bush Administration is an indication of what weare up against. They don't even want to believe it's a problem. Well, it is aproblem. It's a long-term problem and the worst of this is not going to come in2020. It's going to come in 2080, or late in the century. Therefore, it behoovesus as stewards of the planet to have something in our pocket so we can turn CO2off. Now, turning CO2 off is a huge enterprise because the amount of CO2 thatwe are adding to the air this year - if liquefied - would fill a volume 25 cubickilometers (15.5 cubic miles). That's a huge amount of CO2.So to either turn that off by stopping using fossil fuel energy and going tonuclear, wind or whatever, even if we knew we could do that and we werewilling to do it, it would be a huge, huge change. Capturing Carbon Dioxide So It Can't Keep Increasingand Warming the EarthOn the other hand, I think that we need something that's sure fire that we knowwe can do, that is technically not all that challenging. And that is capturing theCO2 that we produce by burning fossil fuels and burying it. This is certainlysomething that can be done.Our idea is to extract CO2 both from electrical power plants and from theatmosphere and aim for a way to go to CO2 neutral. In other words, for everyunit of CO2 we put into the atmosphere, we take a unit out."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"ISN'T IT TRUE THAT MOTHER NATURE CAPTURED CO2 IN LIMESTONEAND WE WOULD HAVE TO RECREATE SOME KIND OF CHEMISTRYLIKE THAT?No, we would put we would liquefy the CO2. We would put it in deep saltyaquifers on the continents. We could possibly put some at the bottom of theocean because that's where it's going to go anyway. We could put it underneaththe Antarctic ice cap. And we could, the ultimate solution would be to mineultra basic rock which contains magnesium oxide, extract the magnesium oxideand combine it with the CO2 to make magnesium carbonate so we would bestoring in a very stable form that basically would last forever.WHICH IS SORT OF THE CYCLE INTO LIMESTONE THAT THE EARTHHAS DONE, RIGHT?Yes, except that the earth does it so slowly. I mean, we're adding now CO2 at arate that is 100 times faster than volcanoes are adding it. So we are really takingover. These natural things aren't going to do it, or do it on such a long time scalethat they won't help us in the next couple of hundred years.THIS SOUNDS LIKE A VERY EXPENSIVE AND LARGE OPERATION ANDYOU WOULD NEED TO HAVE NOT ONLY THIS GOVERNMENT, BUTOTHER GOVERNMENTS IN THE PLANET INVOLVED IN DOING THIS,RIGHT?It's something that's just starting. I would say that 5 years ago, people weretalking about it, but not thinking about it seriously. Now, suddenly, there is a lotof interest in it. Automobile companies, Iceland energy companies are starting torealize that if we have to go this route, it's a huge business. So, if you get in onthe ground floor for this enterprise, it's going to involve 3 to 6% of the world'sGNP. So, it's a huge thing! It will probably be equal to 20% of our energy costs. Playing Russian Roulette with Earth's ClimateBUT IF WE DON'T DO IT, WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PROGNOSIS FORTHE PLANET IS?Well, we're playing Russian roulette with climate. I said there is no way topredict accurately what will happen. If we take the results of the best thing wehave which are these big computer models. Some people don't believe them, butat least it's an honest way to try to do it where you put in as much of what isknown as possible and then sort of have to fudge in the rest. They suggest thatthe impacts are going to be sizable, and they even suggest that if we put inenough CO2 fast enough, it will turn off the ocean conveyor (North AtlanticDrift) which is in a sense forcing one of these reorganizations (of the entireglobal climate).THAT'S WHAT COULD POSSIBLY PLUNGE EUROPE INTO A DEEPFREEZE AGAIN?I don't think so. I think that's been much exaggerated. I think it would change theclimate in Europe and other places, but after all, it is going to be countering analready serious warming. So you could say one way to look at it is (collapse inAtlantic drift) would bring Europe back to where it is now than being warmer.It's part of the uncertainty. The answer is that we don't really know what itwould do. And any speculation on that is just speculation at this point. Thereare a lot of people struggling to put it in context so we can make more definitestatements, but if people make those statements now, they are just talkingthrough their hats.The chances of it producing another ice age I think that's just adding confusion.It's going to make things very different. It's going to make life much moredifficult for wildlife because they don't have any place to go. If the Arctic sea ice"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"melts and the tundra thaws, a huge ecosystem up there is going to be put intochaos. Caribou, polar bears, people who live up there that's an extreme casebecause they have no other cold place to go to. You aren't going to move allthose ecosystems down to Antarctica. Most Recent Halt of North Atlantic DriftIS THERE EVIDENCE THAT THE NORTH ATLANTIC DRIFT HASSTOPPED FOR A SPECIFIC REASON IN OUR PLANET'S RECENTCLIMATE HISTORY?Certainly we are quite sure it has stopped anywhere between five and eighteentimes during glacial periods. But since the glacial period ended and for the last12,000 years, we have had reasonably warm climates on the planet and theclimate has been very stable compared to what it was during glacial time when itwas bouncing all over the place.We've only had one episode during that 12,000 years and that was 8200 yearsago when water that was pooling in front of the retreating Canadian ice cap in abig lake suddenly a big ice dam broke and allowed a lot of that water to go intothe North Atlantic and we think it did kill circulation. It did kill the conveyor.The impact of that was a 5 degree cooling in Greenland, a drop in the globalmethane content which would suggest that areas of swamps that were mainmethane producers were reduced because it was drier.) The monsoons wereslightly weakened. So, the impact of this was broad. But again, it was a suddensurge of a very large amount of water that did this job.WOULD THE MELTING GLACIERS TODAY AROUND THE PLANET...?No, they are too slow. We don't have any pooling of any great amounts of water.So, the way people envision this happening is that as you warm the planet, thenyou warm the planet, you strengthen what we call the \"hydrologic cycle\" morewater evaporating off the ocean, more rain falling and particularly more rainfalling in the northern Atlantic and into the continents surrounding the NorthAtlantic. So that puts more fresh water going in. And that, just hydrologicnormal rainfall and stuff in models has been shown in the models that theconveyor belt stops if you do this rapidly enough and over a long enough periodof time. That does not mean it's really going to happen because models aremodels. They are imperfect. So they suggest it could happen.The chart above outlines some potential military implications of climate change in the years2020-2030.

Why Is Alaska Warming Faster Than Rest of Planet?DO THE MODELS SUGGEST A TIME TABLE OF WHEN IT COULDHAPPEN?Well, most of the models suggest this is something that would not happen before"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"2050. On the other hand, the Woods Hole group has been screaming that it'salready happening, which is interesting. Their evidence for this is solid thatsomething is happening. Alaska is warming much faster than the rest of theplanet. Something is going on up there that we don't understand. Whether it's anatural fluctuation that will go away, or whether it's a precursor to the CO2 andthat already something big is happening? If it's that- it really is driven by CO2 then we may be in for even deeper trouble because we haven't really added thatmuch (so far). We've gone from 280 ppm CO2 to 370 ppm CO2. If we continuebusiness as usual and get 85% of our energy from fossil fuels and there areplenty of fossil fuels to do this. We'll push the CO2 on the planet up to between700 ppm and 800 ppm toward the end of the next century.So the fact that CO2 stays in the atmosphere for so long means that as long aswe are using fossil fuels, it's just going to keep going up and up. Thenpresumably the impacts are going to get greater and greater. It is surprising to methat anything is happening so soon.MEANING THAT ALASKA AND THE TUNDRA SEEM TO BE MELTINGALREADY?Yes, and at a higher rate than you would expect from what's happening on therest of the planet. Alaska has gotten so warm that forests are being infested bypests that couldn't hack it before. The ice along Alaska and the CanadianArchipelago is decreasing and the shores are being eroded, the tundra issoftening, the equipment involved with the oil pipeline their work season, if theyobey the rules as far as what temperatures they can work at has been cut morethan a month because of the warming. So the period of really cold climate upthere is considerably shortened.THE IMPLICATION IS THAT THERE COULD BE A LOT OF FRESH WATERGOING OFF OF THE ALASKA TUNDRA?No, I don't think anybody knows that. I don't think anybody understands why itis happening. I mean some of the models say the biggest effects will be in thenorth. If you start to melt sea ice and open blue water, then of course youexpose warm water in the sense that it can't get below the melting point of seawater to the atmosphere. Whereas before, you had sea ice that could be minus30 degrees centigrade on top. That might have something to do with it that thereare just more open regions in the Arctic. But we don't know. That's the tragedyof it all this system is so complicated and even though there are a helluva lot ofsmart people working full time to try to understand what is going on, the systemis so complicated that the kind of answers you would like to have and we wouldlike to give just aren't there. And if we try to say we understand, we'rebullshitting the world because we don't.IF ALASKA AND THE TUNDRA ARE MELTING, IS THE SAME THINGHAPPENING IN GREENLAND AND COULD THAT AFFECT THECONVEYOR BELT IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC?As I said, I think the changes in fresh water up there are going to come fromrainfall and river runoff. There is not enough water stored the rate at which thetundra is melting back, I don't think is making a very large affect on the freshwater budget. It's a small addition.Greenland there is certainly no evidence of large scale extra melting onGreenland. There is certainly mountain glaciers in eastern Greenland that areretreating exactly as they are everywhere else in the world everywhere in theworld, mountain glaciers started to retreat in the mid 1800s and they'vecontinued to retreat up to the present. That's one of the things that makes thesubject complicated because half of that retreat can't be blamed on humanaffects it has to be natural. So then people who don't want to believe CO2 is aproblem say, 'Well, if the first half (of the warming) was due to Nature, why notthe second half? Maybe we don't have any CO2 warming?'"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"1850 - 1950, Earth On Its Own Warming TrendMEANING IF IT GOES BACK TO THE MID-1800S, THAT WAS WARMINGSEPARATE FROM CARS AND INDUSTRY?That's right. Climate on its own is wandering around. You know, from at least1850 to 1950, it was warming and that's probably all natural. Since then, wedon't know now that CO2 becomes important all we see is the combination ofwhat the Earth is doing on its own and what CO2 is doing. It's quite possiblethat the Earth's climate turned around and started to cool on its own and nowCO2 is warming it up, so the warming isn't as big if it might have been if theEarth was not cooling.On the other hand, maybe the natural warming went on. In which case, a fairamount of the warming we've seen since 1975 is natural and there is no way inhell that we can say which is the case! That's unfortunate, but it's true.Now, in the next 25 years, if the models are correct, climate will warm enoughthat it's outside of the natural envelope and it will be clear that the warming is sobig that there is no evidence that similar warming happened in the last 8,000years.Now, we know for instance that if you go to the Alps in the summer when thereis melting on the glaciers, that water sinks, falls through crevices to the bottomand comes out as a roaring inferno from the edge of the ice. It brings with itboulders and pieces of wood and peat and stuff and when they are dated, youfind that these pieces of wood date at various times during the past 10,000 years,indicating that there were times when the ice was even further back up themountains than it is now and trees could grow in places now covered with ice.So we do know it was warmer than now and we're not in the warmest time of thelast 8,000 years.I mean, the thing we have to respect is this is complicated. People can argue fora long time this way and another way no matter how they think about it, that weare giving the (Earth's climate) system such a big poke that there is a reasonablelikelihood that something is going to happen. Therefore, we ought to beprepared to thwart it.Let's say as a prudent society, we've got to be prepared to do something. Let'sput that amount of effort into getting ready to cut off the CO2. If we don't needto do it, we leave it on the shelf if the climate does not warm. OK, then we're allright and we wait until it does really start to warm significantly and then we getbusy implementing. It will take twenty years to get ready to do this because a lotof things have to be done. It's not something you can just start to do tomorrow.\"More Information:Wa t e r Wa r sAfter the 9/11 attacks, a new Institute for Strategic Threat Analysis andResponse was formed at the University of Pennsylvania. Its greatest concern isthat water disputes could lead to wars in the future. One potential conflict isTurkey's Southeastern Anatolian Project begun in 1960 and projected forcompletion in 2040. Turkey's goal is to impound or divert as much as 75% of thewater flowing in the Tigris and Euphrates rivers for hydroelectric power.Prof. Robert Giegengack, Prof. of Earth and Environmental Sciences at theUniversity of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia told me this week: \"Theconsequences could be catastrophic for both Syria and Iraq downstream.
