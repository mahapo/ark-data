Leonard Stringfield: I feel reluctance to chronicle all the convolutions of the SouthAfrican case, which involves me personally, as it will serve no objective purpose.For me, as with others thrown together by circumstance to work as a smallinvestigative cell, it was an expensive and time-consuming misadventure. But, in thelong run, our efforts paid off by helping expose a hoax. The story began on an upbeat when Tony Dodd of England dropped his newsybombshell at a UFO conference in October 1989 in Frankfort, Germany, sponsoredby Michael Hesemann. But it was before the conference that I first got word of acrash from \"Henry\" Azadehdel, a frequent caller since 1988. In a voice that soundedmore excited than ever before, he claimed that he was on the verge of getting a bigUFO crash and retrieval story in South Africa. He went on to explain that he was intouch with a firsthand source who was involved in its retrieval and that he had calledthe Office of Special Investigations at Wright-Patterson AFB, supposedly involvedin the retrieval, and getting some surprising responses. He promised moreinformation to come and a copy of the taped call to Wright-Patterson. But that wasit. Nothing more came by mail or phone for a long time. Attending the 1989 Munich Conference were several Americans, including Dr. JohnKasher, a professor of physics at the University of Nebraska. On his return to theStates, he sent a report to Walter Andrus, International Director of MUFON, who inturn, sent me a copy. I called Kasher and agreed to work with him which we didamiably, keeping in touch almost daily by phone until, alas, the curtains of thedrama closed. In the meantime, fortuitously, I learned from another researcher that Tom Adamsand associate, Christa Tilton, in Paris, Texas, had received a copy of Henry'spreliminary report about the South African affair in October. Not receiving my copyas promised, I called Tom on November 30, and learned further that Christa hadalready been in communication by phone with James Van Greunen and wife, Janice,in Africa. Later that day when discussing Van Greunen with Christa, she said that hehad called her, inquiring about her abduction experience and this gave her theopportunity to discuss his part in the crash and recovery operations. At that time, thecase was still upbeat and Van Greunen, making his plea for financial help, soundedgenuine. Because of my special interest in crash/retrieval matters and with the opportunity tolearn more about captive humanoids, Christa agreed to entrust me with his phonenumber. She also agreed that I could share it with my colleague, Jack Kasher, andwithin two days, we all agreed to work together as a team. If indeed, Van Greunenhad been exposed to alien humanoids - one, an aggressive livewire who injured anattending doctor, then by all means, I wanted to get his firsthand story. My first call to James Van Greunen in Hillbrow, South Africa, seemed reassuring."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"His manner of speaking was forthright with a good command of the Englishlanguage. Like Christa, I thought he sounded genuine. I winced a little though whenhe described the two live alien entities taken captive from the craft. Thephysiological features were strikingly similar to those described by my two medicalspecialists which I had published in status report, The UFO Crash/RetrievalSyndrome in 1980. (To be reprinted in subsequent Earthfiles.com of all StringfieldSta tus Reports.) In summary, Van Greunen had ready answers for all questions. In fact, he promisedeven more information which he claimed was contained in more than 500 pages inhis possession. This, he said, he would share with our team if he and his family couldget out of Africa safely. He also stressed that he would soon face trial for treason forhis breach of security and, he claimed, that he was under heavy surveillance.Nagging me immediately, I asked, 'How can you escape if you're under heavysurveillance?' His response, 'I have the right connections. There are others who wantme to succeed, but my time is getting short.' Then, after a brief pause, he made hispitch: he needed money immediately to buy plane fare to Europe. His sobbing wife,Janice, and two children? Well, they must go, too, if more money can be provided.But in the main, he must get out soon or face trial. When I called the second time,Janice was home alone. Pleadingly, she made her case: hunger, fear and the urgentneed for money. Needles to say, an air of urgency prevailed among our team members. Our phoneswere busy day and night, almost neglecting the holiday season, as each of us cameup with news and views from sources in Europe, such as Michael Hesemann inGermany, or from the Van Greunens themselves. There were also some loose endsabout the Van Greunen story, little inconsistencies that we each discovered as wecompared notes. Also, there was the word of Henry, who had already announced tothe world that Van Greunen was a fake. But when our hopes were at the lowest ebb,Van Greunen always managed to get his act together, blaming Henry for spreadingmalicious rumors about him. Once when I questioned his vow to deliver thedocuments, he said, 'In God's name, trust me.' Still concerned about the loose ends, Kasher called Van Greunen to get his story ontape. We agreed that it would not only be wise to get his firsthand testimony onrecord, but it would also serve as a test of his behavioral response and willingness tomake sensitive disclosures knowing that his phone might be bugged. But again, whenrecounting his experience, there were no restraints. Instead, he threw all cautions tothe wind, warning: the world must know the truth - the human race is in great dangerand that we might all end up being hamburgers. \\Then on December 13, Van Greunen phoned Kasher and made it clear that unlesshe got the money for plane fare to Germany by December 15, the whole deal wasoff and threatened to destroy the documents. Walt Andrus was advised. MUFONcame through. Kasher acted quickly, transacting payment for Van Greunen's flight toGermany. Janice and children would leave later and join her grandmother inEngland. The decision to help financially was made simply on the premise that theexpenditure would either produce positive results or eventually expose a hoaxer.The gamble was worth it. In Munich, Germany, as pre-arranged, Van Greunen contacted Michael Hesemann.The fugitive and documents were now safe. Financially helped briefly by his newhost, he assured no only him, but also each of us on the American team by phone,that his papers were stashed away in a bank safety deposit box. Christa even offeredto fly to Germany to wrap the deal, but he said he needed time to get settled. Van Gruenen soon became hard to reach in a new lodging, not far from Munich.When I finally reached him, he talked of coming to the United States, thanked all ofus who helped him to safety with a promise to repay his expensive plane fare ticketand said that his family was safe in England. I asked about the documents and heassured me that soon copies would be made for delivery. To simply matters, I suggested that he send me a sampling of five to ten pages, takenfrom the middle portion of the more-than-500-pages he had boasted having while inAfrica. He agreed. Days went by and I called again, asking if his pages were on theway. He was delayed, he said, claiming that he had been ill with the flu. Kashersuggested sending it by FAX. No response. My next call: his excuse was that he wasfrightened by the German police who were informed by Henry that he was a spy. Bythis time, we all wondered about the intent of Van Greunen. Hesemann wondered,too, and was concerned when he learned that Van Greunen, dating a German girl ofpast acquaintance, was away on a fun trip to Italy."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"With this news, we all agreed that James Van Greunen was a con man and a hoaxer.Or, was the hoax actually a 'fix' to hide the real story of a crashed and retrievedUFO? Some of GV's tricks pulled on a few of his contacts were so obviouslyfraudulent, that it seemed highly irregular for a person, hoping to appear genuine, togo to such ludicrous extremes. One such victim was Bill Knell, who published aphoto which falsely identified a mummified Mexican Indian child as an alien. Heshould have known that this kind of mischief would soon catch up wit him, which itdid, leading to his shameful downfall. Of course, official disinformation will go toany extreme, if needed. If he was a stooge, we'll never get official admission orconfirmation. But, personally, I think that James Van Greunen was a womanizingcon man out for money. 4) THE GERMAN CONNECTION; SUMMARY BY MICHAEL HESEMANN My German friend, Hesemann, was committed to the South African affair from itsearliest to its final stages. His view of Van Greunen is essential in this study of whatwas once a 'hot' case. His report, dated April 5, 1990, follows:Michael Hesemann: 'On October 26-29, 1989, UFOlogists from all over theworld met in Frankfurt, Germany, at the International UFO Conference D. U.- Dialogue with the Universe, organized by me. One of the most amazinglectures, presented to an audience of 1800 people from 29 countries of all fivecontinents, including Russia, was held by the British researcher and formerpolice officer, Anthony Dodd. Dodd presented alleged original governmentaldocuments and the results of his investigation on the alleged crash/retrieval ofan alien spacecraft in the Kalahari Desert, Botswana, near the South Africanborder, by the S. A. Air Force on May 7, 1989. After the conference, I kept in contact with Tony. Together with my friendand fellow researcher, Johannes Baron of Buttlar-Brandenfels, I visited Tonyin England in January to discuss the case. On December 22nd, I got a phonecall from a person who introduced himself as Captain James Van Greunenfrom the South African Air Force who wanted to talk with me about theKalahari Incident. We made a date of December 23rd. I invited the Baron ofButtlar to participate at the meeting. On this date, Capt. Van Greunen told usthat he just escaped court martial in South Africa and that MUFON paid histicket (to fly to England). He gave us different telephone numbers of allegedwitnesses of the case and some of them we reached. He told us that he is26-years-old, a cryptologist and helicopter pilot. He said that for starting anew life in Germany, he needs money. He told us that he has 300 pages of U.S. and S. A. intelligence documents in a bank safe in Zurich, Switzerland. Hesaid that he read about my conference in a S. A. newspaper and later gave mea clipping proving this - he got my phone number out of the telephone bookafter arriving at Munich airport. Supposedly in S. A., he was called by theintelligence and asked to come to a special office where he was shown a videotaken by a member of the S. A. intelligence at the Frankfort UFO Conferenceshowing Tony Dodd and me standing on stage - Tony holding the documentsin his hands (the scenery is true). We arranged a new date, January 3rd, wherehe wanted to bring us to Zurich, giving us the original material. In the meantime, he called the Baron many times, asking for money. On December 28, 1989, I got a call on my answering machine by a 'Dr. Henryfrom England' saying, 'If you do not call me immediately, I will release tapesthat could do great harm to James Van Greunen.' This sounded a littlethreatening before I found out that the person calling was Dr. HenryAzadehdel, Tony's co-researcher from England who, for some reason, tried tosilence James Van Greunen. He also informed the German Embassy inLondon that JvG was a spy, who brought classified documents to Germany.They informed the BKA (Germany's FBI), the BKA informed the Lindaupolice who checked JvG on January 1st evening, but did not find anything. On January 2, 1990, James called me, that he was afraid to go to Zurich,believed that Germany would not let him enter the country again. Instead ofthis, he promised to come over and give us a 3-page document 'of highestimportance, the central document of everything.'
