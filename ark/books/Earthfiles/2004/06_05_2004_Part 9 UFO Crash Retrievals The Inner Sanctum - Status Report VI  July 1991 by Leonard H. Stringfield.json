Len Stringfield: \"THE NURSE ('Mary') Abstract of a discussion March 16, 1991, with a retired operating room nurse who wasassigned to the Medical Lab at Los Alamos during WWII and sometime afterward. Thesource is Tim Cooper. Tim Cooper Report: 'Subject: Bodies being flown to Los Alamos (National Laboratory, New Mexico) bymilitary aircraft; and atomic explosion near Indian Springs (New Mexico) prior to theTrinity test. According to 'Mary,' Los Alamos was classified as a 'Green Base,' which means ithad the highest priority to conduct radical research under the MED program duringthe 1940s. Everyone had to have a 'Q' clearance just to be inside the facility. She casually mentioned to me over coffee that 'bodies' had been flown to LosAlamos periodically from late 1945 to sometime in 1947. I asked her if she had seenthose 'bodies' and she said she had not, but others had. I asked her where the 'bodies'were coming from. She said she did not know, but it was rumored that they werehuman experiments for biological and nuclear medicine research. She thought theymight have come from Japan after the war. (WWII ended in August 1945) I askedher why she thought that. She said that they were small bodies with deformed headsand limbs. The eyes were abnormally bit she was told. She did have some view ofthem in the morgue very briefly for a few minutes at some distance. I asked her whyshe was allowed to be present at the autopsies. She told me that she was asked toassist in the preparation and cleanup. At the time, Mary thought nothing of it because some civilians were exposed to anatomic explosion in Nevada (this was not known by the public. Only the Trinityexplosion test was released to the public.) I was shocked to learn this. She said sheknew what she was talking about. 'It happened,' she replied. I asked her again aboutthe bodies. She said they were flown in on special transport planes equipped withrefrigerator units to keep the bodies from decomposing. The flesh was badly burnedand charred. There was no hair on their heads and (the beings) had a grayish-yellowcolor. That's all she knew. (See the Collins interview. This story by Mary seems tohave some commonality with his story of bodies being sent to Berkeley from LosAlamos.)' "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" 'DR. EPIGONI' Ron Madeley of Houston, Texas, is my intermediary for this informative and perhapsunique interview with a 'Who's Who' scientist, the pseudonymous 'Dr. Epigoni.' Ron is acompetent business person and as a researcher has proved that he knows his way around toget to the right places for 'inside' information. Mentally alert but blunt, even gruff in his demeanor and manner of speech, Epigoni's claimis that he was influentially active in the days of the Manhattan Project and that hiscolleagues were Dr. Albert Einstein, Dr. Robert Oppenheimer and Dr. Edward Teller.Because of his position in highly secret work, some of the information he disclosed to Ronduring the interview he deleted, such as the name of a UFO project he headed. Hesubstituted a false name for it, 'Blue Heaven.' While I can understand the change to BlueHeaven (to protect a secret project's real name), Epigoni's other corrections I thought wereodd enough to be interesting food for thought. For purposes of evaluation, I have publishedboth the Doctor's original disclosures and his corrections. Following is Ron Madeley'sreport: Ron Madeley Report: 'On April 11, 1990, I had the opportunity to visit a formergovernment scientist. This, our second meeting, occurred in his (Houston) home. Irecorded this conversation and agreed not to use his real name in any form ofreproduction. Dr. Epigoni, as I will call him, is a retired physicist who is nearing 80years in age and in fair, but steadily declining health. His knowledge might soonfollow his name into quiet obscurity, even though he has worked closely with equallybrilliant men - men like J. R. Oppenheimer; Albert Einstein; and Dr. Edward Teller,'Father' of the hydrogen bomb. As early as 1939, Epigoni was working with the great minds of the day at tworesearch laboratories in New Jersey. That work eventually led to a U. S. Navy postunder the direction of John von Neuman. Epigoni worked at the top of theManhattan Project with the development and detonation of the atomic bomb andlater the first hydrogen bomb. Dr. Epigoni found himself involved in the research end, as opposed to the retrievalend, of crashed flying saucers. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, he was part ofa team of scientists working at Edwards Air Force Base on a very special project.According to Epigoni, a flying saucer and its crew landed at Edwards A.F.B. Thedisc and its occupants were carted off to a secure building at the base for evaluation.It then became part of an 'Above Top Secret' project - something he calls 'BlueHeaven.' Q. Do you think that (disc) is the only one they've got? A. I don't know. That was the only one I was ever allowed to see. Q. Is this thing kept in a hangar out there? Or is it kept underground? Or what? A. It is kept in a big hangar. They've got guards all around that thing and I'm talkingabout guards! And there isn't any way you can get through. And I don't give a damnwhat you do. They've got all types of security there. You've got four rows of guardsbefore you get there and twelve of the damn big barbed wire fences electrified. Q. How did you get in there to see it? A. Well, I was brought in there. I was head of the program. Q. What was the program called? A. It was called 'Blue Heaven.' Q. How many other people were involved? A. Several. Oh, there could have been hundreds. I don't know how many wereinvolved. Q. That actually knew about it - that saw (the disc) there? A. People worked in different forms for parts of the military, you know. But, the dayI was taken out there, a lieutenant and a major general were there and I had two labassistants."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Q. What year were you on that project when you were head of it? A. That's been twenty years ago. Q. Any idea where this (disc) came from? A. I have no idea whatsoever. I examined the 'men.' Felt them. Their eyes were like adog's eyes - one color. They had ears, a nose, mouth. They had teeth in their mouthand I could not tell if they were growing in there, or if they were made in there, orwhat. Q. How tall were they? A. I'd say that they were about five feet tall. They were laying down. Q. How many of them were there? A. Twelve of them, I believe. Q. Were they all dressed? A. Yes. Q. All dressed the same? A. Yes, in a silvery-looking material. It was real bright shiny material. It had not eventarnished. They tried to analyze it and it had elements that we don't have on Earth. Q. Now the bodies - or whatever they were - did you cut into them? A. They would not cut into them. All they would do was take a sample of the blood,or whatever it was, and show it to you. And the ample they took was less than 1cc.You put it under a microscope and looked at it and there was not a damn thing in it.It looked like oil. Q. Any idea about whether there were any organs in the body? A. Well, they x-rayed them and all that, but all that information was given to themedical people. Q. What area were you over (in the project)? You weren't over the medical? A. No, I was strictly on the aircraft (engineering). I was not even supposed to go inwhere those beings were. This major general was the one who allowed me to go inthere with him. And I felt their arms, their legs, and I felt around on them. I said, 'Arethey stiff?' He answered, 'No.' I asked, 'Can I lift the leg up?' He answered, 'Don'ttouch anything.' I asked if I could take the 1cc of liquid with me. I was told not to. Q. Did it have any color to it? A. It was sort of a milky color. Q. What about the bodies themselves? A. They were a light brown color. And you could feel their ribs. They had bonestructure, but whether that was real bone or metal or something else, I don't know.They (U.S. researchers) came to the conclusion that since there was no deterioration,to leave them alone because another craft might come in the area and rejuvenate orreactivate them. At such time, they might open that craft and allow them in. But wewere not to discuss anything about war or - well, I started to say - 'If you could makepeople like that and give them guns and send them to war instead of soldiers ...'When I said that, boy, I was shut up in a hurry! (Don't) Mention nothing about waror fighting or hurting anybody. Q. Who was actually above you who was telling you this? A. The major general. Q. Do you remember who he was? A. (Name given was deleted by Ron Madeley)"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Q. How long had they had the (disc) vehicle and the bodies at that time? A. They told me for seven years. They said (the disc) landed out there and legs camedown out of it and held it up. Something like a stairway came out of the bottom of itand these (humanoid) men walked down the steps and walked out there where the(U.S. government) people were. And all of a sudden, the stairway closed back up.And the legs closed back up and the spacecraft sat back down on the ground. I said Iwant to feel that craft and see if I can feel if there is an opening. He said, 'You canfeel if you want to, but it's as smooth as it is anywhere else.' There were no seams in it whatsoever. I figured it had some kind of molecularstructure where it would give and open up and when it would close, it would resealitself. Of course, the Air Force thought that was the wildest idea they had ever heard.You could not find any seams on it. No rivets. No welding. You would think therewould be ruts on it or welding. It was a big disc. And right up there on top of thatdisc, you could look in there. It was glass. It looked like glass, but it was not glass.You cold shine a flashlight down in there and see instruments and things. I would nothave any idea what they (instruments) were, what they do, or anything else. Q. Was this glass part like a dome in the top of (the disc)? A. Yes. And not only that, there were four seats up there, where four guys would sit.And there were all kinds of controls in there. Q. Did you actually look inside it yourself? A. Yeah! I walked up to it and they had a carpet. You go up a ladder, up a stairway,and get on this carpet and you were not to walk on the craft. All the way around thisdome, they had this carpet. You could walk around it and see almost all there was tosee inside of that hole. Q. Was this glass or plastic, this transparent material solid, just one piece? A. All solid. There was not any seams where it joined the craft. Q. Was it clear or tinted? A. No, it was clear. And I was getting ready to tap on it and they stopped me. Iwanted to tap on it to see what it sounded like. They said it was a material that theyhad not discovered - never dreamed could exist. They had not figured out how to cuta hole through it. They had a lot of machinery in there, big machinery and equipmentin that building. They undoubtedly had been doing a lot of experiments trying tofigure out how to get into that thing (disc). Q. Where were the bodies kept in relation to the vehicle? A. In a room, like a hospital room. They made you go through a decontaminationroom and another decontamination room before you went in there. After you cameout of there, you had to go through two more decontamination rooms. Q. Was this room inside the hangar, or outside it? A. It was in the hangar. It's upstairs. The hangar was a tall building. It had a deck upthere. The ceiling was about 10 feet high and the room that we were in was about 40x 40 feet. They had all kinds of medical machines, all kinds of x-rays in there. Q. Were the bodies just kept out? Or were they in any sort of case? A. They were out. Of course, the temperature and humidity in there was maintainedperfectly, as the air was at the time that they arrived. I don't know. Every one ofthem told me the same thing: those were not dead (beings). If they were dead, theywould have already started decomposing. They are either alive and in a state ofsuspended animation; or they are activated by another craft or by someone inanother craft. Q. Did you see any of the bodies that were animated? That were not in thesuspended animation state, but were physically walking around? A. Inside? Q. Or anywhere?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"A. Oh, no. No. I've never seen one walking around. And I investigated about 25closed sites. At many of those sites, you could check the plants and see traces wherethe beings walked around. We had to keep people out of those areas. Q. Was this part of the work that you were doing with the government group? A. Yeah. When we would get there, we would bring out (deleted by Ron). Theground was never burned or singed. Nothing would grow because the ground hadgotten real hot. It would take a few years for that land to be able to regerminate. Q. So, you would go in (to a craft location) and check out these cases with otherpeople still as part of the research that you were doing with this (government)organization? A. Yeah. Whenever they had a landing, we would be there. Q. Do you remember what year you stopped doing this? A. It was about 1971 or 1972. But in that area of New Mexico to California, we hadabout 40 or 50 landings. Q. In what length of time are we talking about? A. A time of about five years. Q. Do you know if this project is still around today? A. Yes. Q. It is still active? A. Yes.\" Q. Do you remember what year they actually started the project? A. No. I have no idea when it was started. Q. So you were brought in after it began. A. The guy's place that I took started leaking out information and I replaced him.Now I was not the only one. I was one of the scientists that worked on it. There was,well ... I can't name them ... Q. This was the U. S. Air Force that was over this project? A. No, it was the Department of Defense. Now the Navy had two or three of theresearch projects like this one. Q. How far up does information about this go? Does the President know about this? A. Oh, yeah. We had several special meetings with the President. Q. The President at the time would have been Nixon? A. Yeah, he got into all that damn mess. I answered some of his questions. Q. You know that Jackie Gleason, the comedian/actor that died recently. Hereportedly saw bodies down at Homestead A.F.B. in Florida and that PresidentNixon supposedly got him clearance to see them. A. There were some at Homestead. Actually, it was right behind Homestead. It's oneof the most secure bases. It is well protected. Q. Do you think that the astronauts know about it? A. I don't know. At the time I worked for the government, I was never supposed todiscuss it with anybody. Q. Right. What was the level of security on this? A. It was Top Secret. The very top."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Q. Top Secret? Or above top secret? A. It was above that. It went from the President through the Director of the CIA tous. Q. Did he (President) ever have a group that represented him? A. Yeah, he had a whole bunch of scientists there. There must have been 25 to 30 inhis office. They sat in chairs on that side and we sat on this side and they would askus questions. Q. Was this in D. C. or at Edwards AFB where these meetings were held? A. No, they were in Washington, D. C. Q. Given the level that you were at and the speed at which you were progressing,how far do you think that project has gotten today? A. I haven't any idea.\" Dr. Epigoni later referred to the group of scientists that were with the Presidentduring these briefings at the White House and called them the Special Committee. In our previous meeting (in June 1989), we discussed the properties of matter andanti-matter. He believes that some of the flying saucers that our government hasrecovered are being powered by a type of anti-matter drive. Dr. Epigoni said that youwould need to pass an electrical current around a tube that was capped on both endswith metal. Then, particles would be forced through one end of the tube. Protons andanti-protons would collide to release anti-matter. The process, Epigoni stated, couldbe quite dangerous if one end of the tube should fail to hold.'\" Continued in Part 10.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
