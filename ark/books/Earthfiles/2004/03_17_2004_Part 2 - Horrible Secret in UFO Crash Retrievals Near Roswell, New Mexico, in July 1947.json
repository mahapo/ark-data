Laboratories Underground the Papoose Mountains,S-4, Area 51, Groom Lake, Nellis AFB, NevadaDr. Burisch said that several dozen times, he was asked to put on an astronaut-stylespacesuit. He was taken underground at the Papoose Mountain S-4/Area 51 lab facility intoa round room filled with cold hydrogen atmosphere that was referred to as the \"cleansphere.\" His assignment was to enter the clean sphere and approach an entity that hisMajestic-12 superiors described as \"extraterrestrial.\" The being was called \"J-Rod.\" Thename \"J-Rod\" came from the being who told Dr. Burisch it stands for the number 15 asdepicted in Egyptian hieroglyphs.\"J-Rod\" in human shirt, drawn by Bill Uhouse, Engineer,based on his firsthand experience at Area 51, Nellis AFB.Dan Burisch was told there was a serious medical problem with the J-Rod and MJ-12wanted Dr. Burisch to extract tissue from the being's arm for microscopic study.

That's the best I can dojust off the cuff. It looked like a giant insect, being dark brown and hunched over inthe corner, very insectoid in appearance. It almost looked like it had an exoskeleton.I felt afraid inside because I was always told that monsters weren't real.I felt scared, excitement, complete astonishment. Honestly, (before otherknowledge), I thought we were dealing with some kind of monkey, something like anOld World ape. But it wasn't. But that's what my feeling was (scared). I'm not goingto try to talk about how intellectual I was at the time. It scared the hell out of me!The Brookings Institution paper was present, as well as several position papersclarifying the Brookings Institute. However, each of these I was allowed into theyhad separate folders and separate clips within them within the 3-ring binders. I wastold which numbers I was allowed to open up. They were given to me on a card andthose were the ones I was allowed to review during the times I was allowed to reviewthem. Most of the stuff ranged from military applications, physics of the craft I couldnot have cared less (about the technology).I was more interested in taking in the biology issues. (The craft technology) justdoesn't interest me, aside from the fact that I am interested in the biophysicalinterface between the hand, mind and craft. The beings have on their hands a numberof pads. There are open nerves which are protected by various glycoproteins andthose glycoproteins are selectively pushed forward or sucked backwards via capillaryaction. Or they can be through an active fashion pulled back and it kind of pulls aviscous sheath back and allows the J-Rod to have direct interface with the craft. Thatinterested me, although most of it at the time and still some of it now, I have nounderstanding of.A lot of it has to do with electronics and I don't pretend to understand.I was most interested in looking at issues involving their histo-pathology issues,including some autopsy photographs that showed disease processes which werenaturally occurring within them. Isolations of viral material to include new protocolswhich were being written as they were being worked, which is what we are doing.That's what we are doing, writing new protocols as we are working forward. All ofthe old standbys are there: everything from electrofloresis to anything. But we arewriting new protocols as we are going because this is not new territory. This is,pardon the pun, alien territory.HOW MANY BEINGS HAVE WE HAD TO WORK WITH?I only met one. I am aware of possibly three from the reading. And at the time, I wasso stunned by what I was doing, a lot of it was getting by me. When I read the word'extraterrestrial,\" I tunnel-visioned. When I finally believed and understood that itwas in fact an extraterrestrial (I was) numb, numb!THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUTTELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION AND THE NATURE OF IT. WHAT IS ITACTUALLY LIKE WHEN YOU COMMUNICATE WITH ONE OF THESEBEINGS TELEPATHICALLY?I could hear my voice and it was like you hear yourself think. I could hear my voice(inside my head). However, the cadence, the affect, was something that distinguishedit (as something) other than me. It was no great booming voice from the heavens oranything like that. And I'm glad I do not have a proclivity to hear voice in my head,and I have heard none since! (laughs)I could tell it was somebody other than me and I could tell because I felt drawntowards the subject (entity) that was sending the communication. When the J-Rodspoke with me prior to the bombardment of images, it was something that was part ofme, but not part of me. I actually felt non-resident for a moment (out of my body) fora moment. It was almost an OBE (out of body) type feeling and then I could feelmyself pull back and experience the sound (inside my head). It was physical! It wasmore real than touching an object. That's the only real time that I ever felt somethingmore physical than physical.WAS THERE ANY CONVEYANCE OF EMOTION?100% emotion. If he was upset, I could feel his pain. It got to the point where as Iwas doing the needle introductions, I could feel what he was feeling. So as I wouldinject the needle under the integument (arm muscle) and find my proper locationprior to removing the sample, I could feel the needle entering him. So, I could feel hisfeelings.\"According to Dr. Burisch, J-Rod's nerve disease is a serious problem, not only for the entityat Area 51, but is a serious medical problem for the being's entire civilization. This brings us"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"to the \"real reason\" Dr. Burisch says that ETs are here to harvest genetic material from ourEarth life in order to keep his kind alive in the present and the future. Time travel issupposed to be a key to the J-Rod survival.Further, Dr. Burisch says Majestic-12 in the United States has made agreements with theETs to provide medical treatment and allow genetic harvesting from plants, animals andhumans in return for advanced technologies that the United States has been trying toback-engineer since at least the late 1940s.

Photograph © 1980 by Larry Warren.Dr. Dan Burisch's information sounds very much like U. S. Air Force Staff Sergeant JimPenniston's description from the December 1980 RAF Bentwaters UFO incidents inEngland that went on for three nights, beginning after midnight on December 26, 1980, andcontinuing through to the night of December 28, 1980. Sgt. Penniston said he understoodthat what set down in the Rendlesham Forest were time travelers from the future who weredesperate to repair a serious medical problem and considered genetic material from Earthlife to be their \"band-aids\" for survival.Excerpt from September 1994 hypnosis session with former USAF Staff Sergeant James Pennistonabout UFO encounter he had at RAF Bentwaters, England, on the night of December 26, 1980.

Thismight also explain the Corona, New Mexico rancher's comment to me about the \"horriblesecret\" in the Roswell UFO crashes which emerges in some of the alleged U.S. governmentdocuments leaked to Bob and Ryan Wood in their Majestic Documents project. See websitelink at bottom of this report. Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit Summary,Classified TOP SECRET ULTRA"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The IPU Intelligence Assessment was dated September 4, 1960, by the authority of Lt.General John A. Samford, Director, National Security Agency, and approved by AllenDulles, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and stamped TOP SECRET MAJICULTRA. This is one of the documents leaked to Bob and Ryan Wood in their accumulationof files on Majestic-12. Bodies Dissected As You Would A FrogOn Page 6 of the document, five alien bodies are described as they were found with acrashed aerial vehicle at a site on the northern end of the White Sands Missile Range inJuly 1947. The site is called LZ-2 in the report, which means, \"Landing Zone 2.\" LandingZone 1 is defined as the notorious crash site between Corona and Roswell. A third LandingZone 3 is defined as 30 miles east of Alamagordo. All three crashes occurred between July2 to July 6, 1947, according to the MJ-12 report.Paragraph 12 of the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit Summary Intelligence Assessmentstates: \"The most disturbing aspect of this investigation was that there were other bodiesfound not far from Landing Zone 1 between Corona and Roswell that looked as if they hadbeen disected (sic, should be dissected) as you would a frog. It is not known if Army fieldsurgeons had performed exploratory surgery on these bodies. Animal parts werereportedly discovered inside the craft at Landing Zone 2 in the northern part of theWhite Sands Missile Range, but this cannot be confirmed.\"Dissected humanoid bodies and animal parts inside one of the craft must have scaredPresident Truman and his colleagues so badly that they all agreed that a tight lid had to beplaced on UFOs a policy of complete denial in the interest of national security while theytried to learn more and figure out what they were up against. Thus, emerged the NationalSecurity Act of 1947 that created the Central Intelligence Agency, the Majestic-12 SpecialStudies Group and presidential executive orders that required everyone associated with theextraterrestrial investigation to lie and misinform the press and the public in order toprevent panic and to maintain national security."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Majestic-12 First Annual Report, 1952On top of the dissected humanoids and animal parts, there was another disturbing eventthat would also have provoked the Truman Administration's decision to keep all the realfacts about UFOs and what was in them from the press and public. In the year 1952,Truman's appointed Majestic-12 Special Studies Group issued its first annual report as \"AReview of the President's Special Panel to Investigate the Capture of UnidentifiedPlanform Space Vehicles by U. S. Armed Forces and Agencies.\"Biological Warfare and Insidious Retro-VirusesOn Page 5 of the TOP SECRET MJ-12 report under a paragraph entitled \"BiologicalWarfare Programs,\" it states:\"Biological Warfare programs in the U.S. and U. K. are in field test states. Discovery ofnew virus and bacteria agents so lethal that serums derived by genetic research can launchmedical science into unheard of fields of biology. The samples extracted from bodies foundin New Mexico have yielded new strains of a retro-virus not totally understood, but givepromise of the ultimate biological warfare weapon. The danger lies in the spread ofairborne and bloodborne outbreaks of disease in large populations with no medical curesavailable.Retro-viruses were not even a common medical concept in 1947. Examples of retrovirusesare HIV, leukemia and the deadly ebola virus that causes its victims to hemorrhage bloodfrom every orifice. Retro-viruses are composed only of RNA which can provoke healthyDNA to incorporate the insidious RNA instructions into the genome of the cells which thendestroy. Four Medical Technicians Died from ContaminationAt Roswell UFO Crash SitesOn Page 9 of the TOP SECRET MJ-12 report it states:"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"8. \"The Panel was concerned over the contamination of several SED personnel uponcoming in contact with debris near the power plant of the craft security. One technicianwas overcome and collapsed when he attempted the removal of a body. Another medicaltechnician went into a coma only four hours after placing a body in a rubber body-bag. Allfour men were rushed to Los Alamos for observation. All four later died of seizures andprofuse bleeding. All four were wearing protective suits when they came in contact withbody fluids from the occupants.9. Autopsies on the four dead SED technicians are not conclusive. It is believed that thefour may have suffered from some form of toxin or a highly contagious disease. Tissuesamples are currently being kept at Fort Detrick, Maryland.10. The Panel was also concerned with the detection of air-borne release of radiation overthe state of New Mexico. AFTAC detachment from McClellan AFB has conducted severalairborne monitor flights over crash Site L-2 at white Sands. Radiation readings indicate ahigh neutron count was recorded as the plane flew over the site. Neutron count dropped offas the plane flew a considerable distance from the site. A report has been filed with theUSAIDS.Finally, Paragraph 13 concluded, \"In the opinion of the senior Atomic Energy Commissionmedical officer, current medical equipment and supplies are wholly inadequate in dealingwith a large scale outbreak of the alien virus.\"Website:http://www.majesticdocuments.comCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
