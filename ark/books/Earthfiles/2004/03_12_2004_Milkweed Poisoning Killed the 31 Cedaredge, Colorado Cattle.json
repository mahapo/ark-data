March 12, 2004 Cedaredge, Colorado - Cedaredge, Colorado is west of Grand Junctionin a Rocky Mountain region that has long been the home of farmers and ranchers. And oneof those ranchers had 31 of his cattle die last weekend on Saturday, March 6, 2004, in only12 hours. Vern Hillis estimates the one yearling bull and 30 mostly pregnant heifers wereworth about $31,000. Veterinarians at first were not able to confirm what caused the cattleto stumble and fall down kicking and tossing their heads until their last breath. But today, apositive test was confirmed for a particular milkweed plant that grows in the region. It cankill cattle rapidly and violently.Rancher Vern Hillis is 62-years-old and was born and raised on the ranch first settled by hisgrandfather. In the past half century of working the family's 1400 acres, Mr. Hillis told mehe has never encountered anything like the mass death of half his herd. I talked with himthis week about what happened - prior to the Friday, March 12, lab confirmation that theculprit was milkweed.Interview:Vern Hillis, 62-year-old rancher, Cedaredge, Colorado: \"I fed them at 10 o'clockFriday morning (March 5, 2004) and everything was healthy and no sick cattle or nothing.Then I went to get a load of hay down in the lower valley and came back and unloaded andeverything seemed to be alright then. I went into my sister's for supper and then when Icame back late that night, it was raining and I went over to check the cows that was calvingto be sure I didn't have one needing help or anything. Then I got up about 7 a.m. onSaturday morning and went back over to check them again that morning and I seen a cowin the ditch kicking. I got out and tried to get her out of the ditch and I glanced up and thefield was full of dead cows.The ones that was still partially alive, they were just kicking real fast with their feet andthrowing their heads. You couldn't get them up or nothing, they were just kicking anddrowning in their own fluid.HAD YOU EVER SEEN ANY OF YOUR ANIMALS LIKE THAT BEFORE?No, I have found some that have died from poison before, upon the hill a poison weed orsomething, but nothing like this.RECENT ONES THAT WERE KICKING FAST WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?Most of the ones that I've come across up on the hills, they usually die without convulsionsand stuff, no kicking and fighting like that. You usually find them kind of laying in a naturalposition and they are just dead. These, they were kicking and bleeding internally anddrowning in their own fluid. It was a very painful death. They bloated up real bad from it. Idon't know what kind of poison it was, or nothing. It wasn't a very pretty sight."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"THIS WAS SATURDAY MORNING?Saturday morning around 7:30 a.m. MT.DID YOU CALL THE SHERIFF AND VET IMMEDIATELY TO GET THEM OUTTHERE?Yes, I called the vet first and then the Sheriff's Department.AND WERE THEY OUT ON THE SCENE PRETTY QUICKLY?Yes, the vet was out here and he did an autopsy on two of them: an older cow and ayounger cow and took the stuff back to his office and said he thought he would have ananswer for me in an hour or hour and a half about what killed them.Well, he returned with the Colorado State Veterinarian to take more samples. We're stillwaiting for what killed them. I figure somebody doctored a bucket of grain and give it tothem is what I figured happened. I may be wrong, I don't know.WOULDN'T THEY HAVE FOUND THE POISON IF IT WERE THAT OBVIOUS ONSATURDAY?Well, the cows would eat all the grain up and the reason I say I think it was in the grain isthe ones that died are the ones I call the grain hogs they hit the grain and eat it the quickest.They are the ones who died quick and the ones that didn't get as much took longer to die.There were two that didn't die until after midnight on Saturday to Sunday.BUT WOULDN'T THE VET HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM A POISON IN THEIRSTOMACH IN THE NECROPSY?They've been running tests on it and they haven't come up with what kind of poison it is.They are kind of like I say, it's went through two labs already running tests and they haven'tcome up with any, what the poison is yet.SO AT THIS POINT....it's still a mystery, basically is what it is.HAVE YOU EVER HAD ANYTHING HAPPEN LIKE THIS BEFORE?No. You lose a few during calving season or from poison weeds in the hills or predators andthat kind of stuff. But you kind of expect that. But this kind of massive kill poisoning nothing like it!YOU LOST 31 ANIMALS SATURDAY TO SATURDAY NIGHT. DID ANY OF THEMTHAT YOU SAW ALIVE TRY TO GET UP ON THEIR LEGS?They tried I had two that was kind of sickly and down that did get up and go again and theyare still going. They survived it. I figure they just got a mild dosage of it.WAS THERE ANY INDICATION OF PARALYSIS IN ANY OF THE ANIMALS THATYOU SAW ALIVE?They just staggered and stumbled and fell down. They just kind of staggered around andwent down and went to kicking because they were puffing up like a balloon. They werepuffed up real tight, even while they were still kicking alive.DID THE VET SAY THAT HE HAD EVER SEEN A BIG BLOAT ON AN ANIMAL LIKETHAT WHICH KICKED WHILE IT DIED?Whatever the poison is, is causing them to bloat up.HAD THE VET SEEN IT BEFORE?He didn't say anything about it, but they pretty well knew it was a poison when they lefthere because they said there were no known diseases that would kill that many cows in thatlength of time without some symptoms before.\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Republication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
