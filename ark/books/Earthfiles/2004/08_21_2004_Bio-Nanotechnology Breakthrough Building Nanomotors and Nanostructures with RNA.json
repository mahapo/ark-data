Middle : Influenza viruses = about 80-100nanometers.Right: SARS coronavirus = 100 nanometers.1 micrometer (micron) = 1 / millionth of a meter (39.37 inches)1 nanometer = 1 / billionth of a meter August 21, 2004 West LaFayette, Indiana - When you enter the world ofbio-nanotechnology, you are so small that if one nanometer were the size of a single pea, aregular meter of 39.37 inches would be the size of the Earth! In that nano world, virus sizesvary from 18 to 300 nanometers. A team of scientists at Purdue University, led by Peixuan Guo, Ph.D. - a molecularvirologist in Purdue's Cancer Research Center - have been studying what viruses do toinvade and re-program cells in disease. One particular virus that invades bacteria gets the bacteria to synthesize an unusual andpowerful phi29 encoded RNA to build little motors so the virus can drive its DNA intoprotective protein shells that are then inserted into the bacteria and take over the bacteriacells' programming. What's incredible is how the virus builds an organic motor to get its own DNA into theprotein shell and into the bacteria. The virus gets six bacteria RNA molecules to cometogether in a ring. The scientists use the metaphor of six children linking hands. The virus isable to tell one RNA molecule to clasp its right hand to the left hand of another RNAmolecule and to clasp its left hand to the right hand of another RNA molecule. The little ring nano motor then surrounds the virus's DNA, apparently turning like a motor,which drives the virus's DNA into the protein shell that is inserted by the virus into the hostbacteria. Dr. Guo and his colleague, Dieter Moll, Ph.D., at Purdue's Cancer Research Center, havebeen able to copy the virus's creation of the tiny RNA motors and have been able to buildthe nanomotors in their laboratory to do what they want the RNA molecules to do.Recently, the research team has gone even further in breakthrough work that was recentlypublished in NANO Letters, a journal dedicated to nanoscience and nanotechnology.Peixuan Guo's lab is supported by NIH (National Institutes of Health), NSF (NationalScience Foundation), DOD (Department of Defense) grants, and Dieter Moll is funded asan Erwin Schrödinger fellow of the Austrian Science Fund FWF.

Dr. Guo and Dr. Moll have been able to make RNA molecules build structures on a largescale that are several micrometers in size. That means the scientists have been able tomodify what the virus does to make the nanomotors and go beyond to build with thousandsof RNA molecules. Before this RNA breakthrough, other scientists had been able to manipulate proteins andDNA, but not to make motors and delivery systems at this minute nano scale. All thismeans that humans working in the totally invisible microscopic world of viruses and RNA,and copying what the microbes do, might be able to deliver medicines directly into cells ofdiseased patients or to build molecular electronics that would be the first marriage oforganic and inorganic, a marriage of the living with the non-living. This week I talked with molecular biologist Dieter Moll, Ph.D., whose background was inprotein bio-nanotechnology at the University of Agricultural Sciences in Vienna, Austria,before joining Dr. Guo's lab about two years ago.Interview:Dieter Moll, Ph. D., Post Doctorate Research Associate since February 2003,Laboratory of Prof. Peixuan Guo (PAI-shun gwoe), Ph.D., who is Professor ofMolecular Virology, Purdue Cancer Research Center, Purdue University, WestLafayette, Indiana: \"Only recently, we've found out that if the virus can get such gooduse out of this molecule, then maybe we could get some good use out of it, too.WHEN THE VIRUS PROVOKES THE RNA TO MAKE THIS MOTOR RING, HOWDOES THE VIRUS USE THIS 'MOTOR?'This virus, when it infects a bacterial cell, it gets the cell to produce viral components, thenext generation of viruses. These viral components have to come together and form a new,complete virus particle. Part of that involves an empty protein shell the virus has and itinvolves the DNA, a long molecule carrying the genetic information. this DNA moleculeneeds to go inside the protein head so it's protected there. This DNA molecule does notreally want to go in there (empty protein shell). So, the virus needs a motor to be able tostuff the DNA molecule into the protein shell. This RNA molecule is an essentialcomponent of the molecular motor that does that job for the virus.And what we think may be happening is that 6 RNA molecules will turn the connector andthe connector will act like a hex nut driving the bolt, which is the DNA, into the proteinshell.\"Nanomotor\" that is naturally produced by a virus that infects bacteria. The virus wants to insert its DNA(green tube at center) into a protective protein shell the virus makes to invade a bacterium. The six colored\"arms\"(yellow , magenta, orange, grey, red and turquoise) are six RNA molecules the virus manipulates to form\"Hexamer RNA.\"(The perspective is at a slight angle so the turquoise arm is curved up, not outward.) Each of the six RNAmo l e c ul e shas a \"right and l eft hand\" w hi ch can l ink up w i th the other RNA molecul es to forma ri ng, the Hexamer RNA.The darkblue area around the green DNA is a protein plate called a \"Connector\"that connects the six RNA molecules,leaving a 3.6 nanometer (nm) \"donut hole\" called a \"Channel.\"After the virus lines up its DNA with the3.6nm hole, the Hexamer RNA is rotated around the DNA\"like a hex nut would drive a bolt.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The \"grains\" throughout the 3-d computer model represent individual atoms of the biomolecules.Graphic © 2004 by Peixuan Guo, Ph.D. and Dieter Moll, Ph.D.WHERE THE 6 MOLECULES ARE RINGED TOGETHER, THE ASSUMPTION ISTHAT IT IS TURNING. AND THAT WOULD BE THE 'MOTOR' DESIGNATION THATWOULD BE MOVING THAT PROTRUDING DNA AT THE CENTER INTO THEVIRUS'S PROTEIN SHELL?That's right. Another reason why this whole structure qualifies as a motor is because it usesenergy. It takes ATP, which is molecular fuel of the cell the gasoline of this motor. Ithydrolyzes ATP and converts the energy of ATP into mechanical motion. That's why wecall it a motor. Modifying Nature's RNA Motor Designfor Human Bio-NanotechnologyHOW DO YOU AND DR. PEIXUN GUO THINK THAT THESE NATURAL RNAMOTORS CAN BE USED IN HUMAN BIO-NANOTECHNOLOGY?What we did was to modify these RNA molecules. On the virus, they form this motorstructure by holding hands. We modified the hands of these RNA molecules. So, oneparticular RNA molecule cannot just hold hands with any other partner, but it can onlyhold hands with a particular partner. so, we can basically tell one RNA molecule, 'You takethis other RNA molecule to your right and this other one to your left.' That way, we can telleach RNA molecule exactly where to go.WHEN YOU CAN DO THAT, HOW DOES THAT HELP HUMANS AT THENANOTECHNOLOGY LEVEL?One of the big challenges in nanotechnology is to make defined architectures, definedstructures that are at the nanometer scale. We can tell RNA molecules exactly where to goand in which position to arrange themselves and that is a way for us to make structures thathave nanometer dimensions and properties.GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT YOU THINK YOU COULD BUILD IF YOUCOULD CONTROL THESE RNA NANOMOTORS?First, let me explain what we have built already. We modified the hands of these RNAmolecules so we can tell each RNA molecules which neighbor to choose. For this hand tohand interaction, the body and legs of the RNA molecules are not really required. So wecan change them. It doesn't matter what they look like. So, what we did was to make oneRNA molecule and give it a very long leg and tell it, 'You go to the right of another RNAmolecule that has got its legs chopped off. And go to the left of another RNA molecule thathas its legs fused together. So, that way we can create a variety of shapes and sizes ofmolecules, molecular assemblies, at the nanometer scale. Beyond Building RNA Nanomotorsto Building RNA NanostructuresSo far, it's not really useful because it's only long or short legs or something. But the nextstep we are working on right now is to make one RNA molecule that holds, for instance, anano particle and another that holds a nano wire. Then if you can make RNA assembliesthat will line up, for instance, a nano particle with a nano tube and a nano wire, then thatgets very interesting and elegantly surreal nanotechnology.I SEE, AND WHEN YOU USE THE WORD 'WIRE,' YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUTORGANIC PROTEIN CHEMISTRY. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE AVERY FINE COPPER WIRE THAT THE RNA NANO MOTOR COULD BE USED TOASSEMBLE A COPPER WIRE WITH SOMETHING ELSE?It wouldn't be a copper wire. Let me stress here that nanotechnology is always an inter-disciplinary approach. We need the input from nanotechnology from other fields such asmaterial science that can make nano wires out of semi-conductors or who can handle nanotubes. Then we can link these components that other nanotechnologies make to our RNAsand use our RNAs as a scaffold to assemble these nano components in a defined way.SO, HUMANS ARE COPYING THE VIRUS WORLD THAT USES RNA TO ASSEMBLETHINGS FOR VIRUSES."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Exactly. And the reason that molecules of life just work on a nanometer scale and workvery well on a nanometer scale is because they have learned to do that over billions ofyears. For that reason, we are turning to the biological world for inspiration fornanotechnology. But also to take the actual building blocks. We are recruiting the buildingblocks that this particular virus has already developed and we are taking those buildingblocks and all we have to do is modify it. And get it to do what we want it to do, ratherthan what the virus wants it to do. Organic Computers?IS THE IMPLICATION THAT WE COULD END UP WITH COMPUTERS MADE OUTOF ORGANIC MATERIAL?I think there are several different applications here. One is to use these nanostructures inmolecular electronics, basically to try to make electronic devices now by different methodson a much smaller and more powerful scale.Another issue is that these nanostructures are the same size of the molecules of life. So thatis the reason they are also very good at interacting with living cells. So, another possibleapplication is in the biomedical fields where we can use these nanostructures for example,as bio-sensors or eventually to connect our microscopic world and computerized digitalworld with the living world, with cells and establish a communication between cells andour microscopic world. It can be a two-way communication. We might be able to getinformation out of the cells and the cells will be able to tell us how they are. It might alsowork the other direction. We could get information into the cells and tell them what to doin a new sort of way. RNA Delivery Structures Can Target SpecificCells for Medical TreatmentCAN YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING YOU HAVE DONE ALREADYTHAT WOULD SHOW PROMISE OF USING THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY TOTREAT SOMEBODY? OR HEAL SOMEBODY?Yes, we targeted a gene that played a role in cancer and by knocking out this particulargene, we were able to kill cancer cells in the lab. But it's not working in a patient yet.BUT THAT WAS STILL WORKING WITH RNA AND MAKING THE RNAMOLECULES DO WHAT YOU WANTED THEM TO DO?Yes, exactly. That is based on assembling RNA superstructures in a defined way that wecan control by defining this hand-in-hand interaction we have been talking about. Bytargeting these RNA nano complexes to cells and letting them to do a particular job in thecells.YOU'RE SEEING THAT NANOTECHNOLOGY RNA MOTORS COULD BE USED TODELIVER MEDICINE OR PERHAPS EVEN TO CORRECT A DNA PROBLEM ON ALOCALIZED LEVEL THAT WOULD BE STILL TREATMENT, AS OPPOSED TO AUNIVERSAL STEM CELL CORRECTION OF ALL DNA IN ALL CELLS?Yeah, that is right. There is a new technology that is under hot debate. It works very well inthe lab. It is based on RNA molecules that can regulate gene expression and knock out aparticular gene. This works very well in the lab and now people are trying to use it fortherapeutic applications and in therapy, the big issue is how are we going to get these RNAmolecules that are going to do the healing job into the cells? How are we going to targetcells? And how are we going to deliver the functioning RNA sequence? We believe withour RNA nanostructures, we have a targeting and delivery vehicle because we can hook upa functional unit that can target a particular cell for instance, a cancer cell and connect thistargeting RNA molecule with other RNA molecules that can hold the cure against theproblem that the cell has.YOU COULD TARGET AN ENTIRE TUMOR IN THE BRAIN OR LIVER ORPANCREAS THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT AND USE THIS TARGETINGMECHANISM WITH THESE NANOMOTORS TO DESTROY JUST THE CANCERCELLS?We are hoping in the future that may be possible. In the moment, we are just working withcell structures in the lab on a small scale. We are making the initial steps to see what we"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"can do with this with these nano complexes. But the first results are very promising. Large RNA Nanostructures for Molecular Electronics:Mixing Living with Non-LivingWHAT WOULD YOU PERSONALLY LIKE TO SEE BE ONE OF THE RESULTS INALL OF YOUR WORK?I would like to see that eventually that we can use our RNA nanostructures as scaffolds tomake functioning nano devices. That could be nano devices that work in molecularelectronics. Or they could be nano devices that work to help cure diseases.IF YOU ARE WORKING IN ELECTRONICS, DOES THAT MEAN THAT IN THEFUTURE THERE WOULD BE A MARRIAGE BETWEEN THE ORGANIC RNAWORLD AND THE INORGANIC MINERAL WORLD?That is what we are aiming at, yes. We have already got preliminary results where we havemanaged to link inorganic nano particles to RNA so that is the first step in linking the livingworld with the non-living world. In the long run, we are hoping to establish acommunication between the living and the non-living world.ONCE YOU DO THAT, HOW WOULD YOU SUSTAIN THE ORGANIC RNASTRUCTURES MEANING THAT'S LIFE THAT HAS TO HAVE SOME KIND OF FOODAND ENERGY WITH THE INORGANIC WHICH DOES NOT?There are two different scenarios. One is that they would use these structures just formicro-electronic applications. In that case, the job of the RNA would be to act as ascaffold to arrange nano components and after that, the job of the RNA is done and it canbe replaced with something that is much more durable and sturdy.The other scenario is that we use the nanostructures in cells, in cellular backgrounds, andthen the cells would be doing the job of maintaining the organic molecules.IT'S REALLY INCREDIBLE ISN'T IT?Yeah, it's a hot area and a lot of things can be done. The most recent progress was that wegot these RNA nanostructures to assemble on a large scale to form structures that wereseveral micrometers in size. That is important because it matches the size range that we canachieve in conventional micro structuring technology. The way we did that was to fuseindividual RNA building blocks together so that we form a twin that has two sets of arms.So, with that architecture we are not limited to building a finite ring of RNA molecules. Butwe can get the RNA molecules to assemble infinitely and form very large structures. Andwe got structures that are composed of several thousands of molecules and they are severalmicrometers in size.THE RNA WAS ABLE TO ASSEMBLE EXACTLY THE WAY YOU WANTED IT TOASSE MBL E?That's right. By designing the RNA molecules in a particular way, we were able to tell theRNA molecules how to assemble and form the structures that we wanted to form. But wecannot completely bend the arm of Nature. We just have to redesign the biological buildingblocks so that they assemble in the way we want. There are not unlimited possibilities. Wehave to take into account what Nature wanted these molecules to do.\"Website:http://www.vet.purdue.edu/PeixuanGuohttp://pubs.acs.org/journals/nalefd/Credits"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
