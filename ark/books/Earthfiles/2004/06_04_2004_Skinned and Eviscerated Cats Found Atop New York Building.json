June 3, 2004 Manhattan, New York - Yesterday half a dozen skinned cats with blood andorgans removed were found by construction workers atop a two-story brick building at31-27 Thomson Avenue in Long Island City, Queens, New York. The cat remains weretaken to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Manhattan.There, Special Agent Joseph Pentangelo examined them, said it was \"macabre andhorrible,\" and sent the bodies to the ASPCA hospital. I talked with him this afternoon aboutresults from preliminary tests.Interview:Joseph Pentangelo, Special Agent, American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty toAnimals (ASPCA), Manhattan, New York: \"The cats were removed to our ASPCAhospital yesterday and some preliminary tests were done. At this point, we've determinedthat the cats' bodies and some of their organs had been treated with a chemical designed toretard or delay decomposition - a chemical like formaldehyde. Also, some of their organshad latex ejected in them, which I also understand is a method to preserve organs.THIS WOULD IMPLY WHAT TO YOU?The implications at this point are that we are speaking to an individual - I don't want tocharacterize him as a suspect - but we believe we are speaking to the individual at leastresponsible for putting the cats on the roof. It appears that he was using them for some sortof teaching purposes for biology. Whether or not he is officially sanctioned to do that or isaffiliated with any kind of learning institution, we have not determined that.WHY WOULD HE PUT THEM ON THE ROOF?I don't know. That's the disturbing part of it. But I don't want to speculate. It certainlycaused public alarm in doing it. And how he came in possession of them - whether theywere already in that state when he came in possession of them or if they were alive whenhe came in possession of them is still being investigated.IS HE ARRESTED?No, he is not a suspect at this point. He is a person we are interviewing."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"HAVE YOU EVER HAD ANY CAT MUTILATION CASES BEFORE IN THE THREEYEARS YOU HAVE WORKED FOR THE ASPCA?No, nothing like this.\"Website:ASPCACredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
