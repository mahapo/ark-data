On July 21, I was flying back from the\"swastika-like\" one at Pewsey which is just underneath the chalk white horse.Beneath the Pewsey White Horse carved on the distant hill, near Pewsey, Wiltshire,reported July 20, 2004 in wheat. Another long pictogram pattern (some say a hoax in contrast to this firstpattern)appeared nearby in the field, reported on July 22, 2004. Aerial photograph © 2004 by Lucy Pringle.Editor's Note: British crop circle researcher, Francine Blake, suggests the pattern is avariation on a symbol known as \"Axis Mundi,\" a world axis. In my own research of Celticcross designs, I found the drawing of an Axis Mundi symbol found in a pillar stone atTrawsmawr, Wales. Originally, the oldest symbol of the world axis symbol was the SacredTree, later replaced by the pillar stone. The world axis symbol honors three worlds: earth,sky and the space between, or the spiritual, matter and psychic dimensions."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Axis Mundi symbol depicted in Celtic stonepillar at Trawsmawr, Wales.

First reported morning of July 21, 2004, andisreported (confirmation pending) to be official experiment on Tim Carson farm paid for by Joachim Koch,M. D., and Hans-Juergen Kyborg.

It's taking us back to the older days, the 1991 days, where youhad the linear effect.AND ALMOST INSECT-LIKE."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Windmill Hill near Avebury Trusloe reported in wheat on July 17, 2004. The huge patterncovers eleven tramlines, each about 75 feet wide, which would make this \"insectoid\" pictogramabout 825 feet long. Aerial photograph © 2004 by Lucy Pringle.Wide angle aerial photograph © 2004 by Steve Alexander, Temporarytemples.co.ukYes, because you have the proboscis coming out and the sort of horns at the top. It'scurious. But I have to tell you that it's on Robin Butler's land. He's the farmer. He's openminded and put out an honesty box which hopefully people will pay when they go in. Butwhen he went into it at 6 o'clock on the morning on Saturday, July 17, and discovered it forthe first time, he found a lot of mud on the downed crop - at least where he entered..I UNDERSTAND FROM CHARLES MALLETT THAT IT RAINED ALL NIGHT,FRIDAY TO SATURDAY.I don't know because that's Wiltshire and I'm Hampshire. But it's not a good sign, the mud(meaning could be manmade). But I have to tell you because it was extraordinary I got aterrific headache in certain parts of the pattern, particularly at the top (the pattern goes upa hill), the proboscis going north toward Windmill Hill. I can only think that was due to theenergy lines (magnetic ley lines) radiating from the old enclosure of Windmill Hill.I KNOW WHAT THOSE VICE-LIKE HEADACHES ARE INSIDE SOME OF THEFORMATIONS. I'VE EXPERIENCED THEM AND ASSOCIATE THEM WITH SOMEKIND OF ENERGY THAT IS STILL RESIDUAL IN SOME OF THESE FORMATIONS.Yes, that's it. We're dealing with residual energy. So I find it very interesting that I shouldbe experiencing those strange effects despite the suspicious mud. I can only put it down tothe energy lines that are running from Windmill Hill.\" Charles Mallett, longtime crop circle researcher who did a night watch on SilburyHill all night Friday, July 16 to Saturday morning, July 17, 2004: \"Up until the arrivalof that formation, there certainly was not anything in that Windmill Hill field when I did mynight watch on Silbury Hill the night of July 16. On that night, I had gone to dinnermembers of the Norwegian crop circle group. One of them, Guro Parvanova, got her mapout. She is a very sensitive person and pointed her finger at a field on the map which wasone of the lower fields on the slopes of Windmill Hill that turned out to be the exact fieldthat the big formation happened in. She said, 'I just have a feeling about this field,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"something special is going to happen there.'I went from dinner to Silbury Hill where I spent a night watch. The weather washorrendous with rain most all night. I did not see anything unusual, but I can confirm it wasraining until at least 3 a.m. The next morning, I learned from Nick Nicholson, whophotographs for the Cropcircleconnector, that a formation had been reported at WindmillHill. I couldn't believe it! I contacted Guro and her friend, Irene, and we got to theformation around 10 o'clock in the morning. There were maybe half a dozen people in theformation, but because it was so huge, there were large sections of it that were untouchedfrom anyone walking on it. Obviously, because there were a number of people in therebefore us, we could not be certain where they had walked or how muddy their boots werewhen they came in. There was mud around in some places, consistent with visitor activity,certainly not with hoax activity from my experience. There was no rhythmic damage acrossthe plants that you would expect from mechanical damage.I'd say on balance, I don't think it's a hoax due to the mud because I could not find theplank marks which one sees in young green wheat. The marks can be obvious in a rhythmicsense. Generally we all found the Windmill formation to be pretty clean and crisp andflowing.\" Camera Failures and A Surprising Anomaly in the Windmill Hill FormationI learned that at least five people had cameras fail to operate inside the WindmillFormation, but when each left the pattern, the cameras would operate again. Lucy Pringlewas aware of cameras that failed.\"LUCY, BERT JANSSEN TOLD ME THAT ONE OF THE MORE EXTRAORDINARYANOMALIES WAS IN ONE OF THE LARGE RINGS, THERE WAS A ONE-INCHWIDE THIN RING WITHIN THE LARGE RING IN WHICH ALL THE PLANTS WERELAID DOWN GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.Yes, I saw that. I did see that. That was very interesting. I haven't worked that out. In oneof my photographs, I don't know if you have noticed that in one of the circles as it openedout into the next circle, the plants were going in opposite directions. They were meeting, infact, and overlapping in totally opposite directions. There were definite anomalies.\" Bert Janssen, longtime crop circle videographer and photographer from Holland: \"Inthe Windmill Hill formation, I noticed a feature I haven't seen before. There is a center partof the formation that's kind of a ring and in the ring was crop going clockwise. But in thecenter of the ring, there were a few stalks going counter-clockwise. This little inner ringwent all around inside the bigger ring, only two or three stalks wide. The big ring itself Ithink was two meters wide, but this tiny line in the center was only about an inch wide,maybe two inches. Sometimes it was only one stalk. Other times, only three or four stalks.But it continued all the way around. It was really a thin ring inside a bigger ring, each goingthe opposite direction from each other.I made a lot of photos of it and I've never seen athing like that before in a crop circle in England. That made me wonder even more whatwas going on here.Yellow arrow points out thin counter-clockwise ring woven of two or three stalks through the centerof the larger 2-meter-wide clockwise ring in the Windmill Hill formation found on July 17, 2004,near Avebury Trusloe, Wiltshire. Photograph © 2004 by Bert Janssen.WERE YOU ABLE TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY LENGTHENED NODES OREXPULSION CAVITIES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN THE STEMS?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"I did study a lot of stems, but I did not notice anything strange to the plants nothing likeblown nodes or elongated nodes. The only thing that impressed me was the way the cropwas laid down. The flow was really impressive. It was not always logical. A circle wouldnot really spiral toward the center, but would just meander toward the center, like it waswater running around.\"\"Water running\" flow of wheat plants in the huge Windmill Hill formation reportedJuly 17, 2004. Photograph © 2004 by Bert Janssen.There was one more aspect of the Windmill formation that I thought is important. I met atleast three people whose camera batteries went flat in a few seconds after they came intothe formation. They started working with their cameras, wanted to take a picture, and nobattery. That's something I have only seen in the better formations.THIS ISSUE OF WHAT DRAINS BATTERIES AND AFFECTS ELECTRONICEQUIPMENT INSIDE OF SOME OF THE FORMATIONS?I don't know. I don't know exactly what is draining these batteries, but it happens. And thebatteries are not drained outside the formations. Many people have had cameras for manyyears and never experienced this problem before until they step into a crop circle.YOU WOULD ASSOCIATE THAT WITH THIS BEING MORE EVIDENCE THATSOME KIND OF AN ENERGY SYSTEM HAD INTERACTED WITH WINDMILLHILL?Yes. It looks very much that way. It's not a mechanical force. It's much more a force thathas energy into it. So it's not flattening with boards. That would not explain batteriesdraining. There has to be some energetical force in the whole crop area.ESPECIALLY THAT LITTLE ONE INCH-WIDE RING INSIDE THE BIGGER RINGGOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. HOW WOULD ANY HUMAN PUT DOWN AONE-INCH-WIDE STRIP RING INSIDE OF ANOTHER RING?The only way you could do it is to crawl on your knees through all the crop circle and getevery stalk and put them in the opposite direction by hand. The little ring stalks were notonly laying on top of the bigger ring or under it, but in between like it was interwoven withthe other crop of the bigger ring, woven going in the opposite direction. So, it's notsomething that happened earlier or later. It happened at the same time. That was reallyamazing.\" The \"Erased\" FormationLucy Pringle: \"I was flying over this evening (July 21, 2004) and there was a newformation that had been harvested out and I think it was by the farmer called Farthing, whoowns the land around Avebury. This was closer to Avebury than the Avebury Trusloe one(Windmill Hill). The farmer must have destroyed it with his harvester very quickly becauseI don't think anybody got a picture of whatever the pattern was before it was cut out."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Farmer mowed down a formation near Avebury on or before July 21, 2004.To date, no one has reported seeing the pattern before it was destroyed.Aerial photograph © 2004 by Lucy Pringle.\"Just recently, I visited the West Kennet one which is rather like the crescent moon and therising sun. Whereas it looks very dramatic from the air, it is strange on the ground. It had asort of empty feeling. I could not find any anomalies in the plants such as elongated nodesor expulsion cavities.West Kennet Longbarrow, near ancient Silbury Hill in Wiltshire,reported July 13, 2004. Aerial photograph © 2004 by Lucy Pringle.\"My favorite one of this year - and I do think it is extremely significant - is the Fort Nelsonone. I was talking to Jim Lyons and he said they were doing a lot of work on the negativeand positive which is represented in that particular formation. I did take seed samples. AndI did bury my bottles of water and I sent them up to him because he is in touch with thepeople at various laboratories who will analyze the seeds and do a whole chemicalspectrum of the water. He was excited about that. It is important because we've got to backup our gut feelings with scientific evidence.Fort Nelson, near Portchester, Hampshire, reported June 11, 2004.Aerial photograph © 2004 by Lucy Pringle.\"In addition to Fort Nelson, I did like the East Field one, the one I think looks like amusical instrument when you look at the harmony and from a musical point of view, it hasa great deal of harmony to it.IT WAS UNIQUE COMPARED TO MOST PATTERNS OVER THE YEARS, WASN'T IT?Yes, we've never had anything like that. That again is a joy, something entirely new andbeautiful.\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"454-foot-long formation in wheat at East Field near Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, England,reported on June 20, 2004.
