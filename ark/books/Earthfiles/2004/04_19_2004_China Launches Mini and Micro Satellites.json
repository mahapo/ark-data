April 19, 2004 Xichang, Sichuan, China - China has launched \"Experimental Satellite I,\"a mini-satellite weighing 93 pounds (204 kilograms) and \"Nano-satellite I,\" a 55-pound (25kilograms) \"micro-satellite\" in which metals are bonded at the atomic level. The twosatellites are the first of ten that China plans to orbit around the Earth this year and thesmallest is a miniature technology breakthrough.Xichang Satellite Launch Center in the southwestern provinceof Sichuan, China, during launch of satellites on Sunday,April 18, 2004.

These light weight satellites provide highquality at lower costs and shorter research and manufacturing time lines. This now makesChina the fourth country in the world to launch nano-satellites after the United States,Great Britain and Russia.A spokesman at the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in the southwestern province ofSichuan explained that the mini-satellite will be used for \"land resource photogrammetry,geographic environmental monitoring and surveying and mapping experiments\" under thedirection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Remote Sensing Satellite Ground Station.The groundbreaking micro-electronic \"Nano-satellite I\" was created by Tsinghua (Qinghua)University and the Aerospace Tsinghua (Quinghua) Satellite Technology Co. in Beijing. TheChinese government says the development of \"super small satellites is an important way toserve economic growth and benefit mankind by using space technologies.\"Some military strategists point out that China's Technology Research Academy has beendeveloping miniature anti-satellite weapons called a \"piggyback satellites\" that can attachlike a parasite to other satellites, space station or space-based lasers, either jamming anenemy's communications or physically destroying the unit. The Pentagon wrote in a July2003 assessment that China will probably have a sophisticated anti-satellite system ready tooperate in the next six years.At the same time, China is leading an international movement to ban conventional weaponsfrom space. China, Russia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Belarus, Zimbabwe and Syria haveintroduced a draft treaty at the United Nations to outlaw the deployment of space-basedweapons."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Websites:http://www.china.org.cn/english/2004/Apr/93318.htmhttp://news3.xinhuanet.com/english/2004-04/19/content_1426357.htmCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
