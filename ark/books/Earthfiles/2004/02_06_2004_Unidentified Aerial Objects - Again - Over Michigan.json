February 6, 2004 Jackson, Michigan - The following e-mails with imagesattached were received by me a little after midnight on February 5, 2004, sentfrom a resident of Jackson, Michigan who I will call \"John D.\"\"Linda,I've had the most incredible evening (on night of February 4, 2004)! I hadtwo UFO sightings in the space of 2 1/2 hours, in two different counties! The first sighting was near Litchfield in Hillsdale County, Michigan. Thesecond was in Napoleon, that's in Napoleon County, and the good news isI've got video of that one. February 4, 2004 at 6 p.m. in Litchfield, HillsdaleCounty, Michigan First, I want to tell you about what I saw nearLitchfield this evening. I live on the extreme west side of the city of Jackson in JacksonCounty, Michigan. I work in the town of Litchfield, which is inHillsdale County and I travel 29 miles to get there. I travel throughfarm country so there are lots of open spaces along the way.I left work at around 6:00 pm and was about 5 miles from Litchfield on a'country' road named Rainey (or sometimes called 30 Mile Rd) when I sawa bright light to my left (west). It was twilight out and it reallycaught my eye. I pulled off to the side of the road, which ended up being a mistakebecause even though the road was clear, there was a lot of snow on theroadside and I got stuck. I eventually got out with the help of apasserby, but not before I got out of my truck and continued to watchthe bright light I had seen. It was headed east, in my direction, andalthough I was curious about it I assumed that it was an airplane. I"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"knew better after it rose a couple of hundred feet at a very steep angleand passed me overhead. It made no noise and had a bright light infront and behind, and two at the sides; the strange thing was that thetwo side lights were close together compared to the front/behind lights,which would be odd for an airplane. This gave it a rod-likeappearance. The object continued to travel toward the east. As soon as I got home, I grabbed my Sony digital camera and headed toNapoleon, because Napoleon seems to be a hotbed of UFO activity thesedays. On my way out there, I noticed that the sky was very active:there were 5 or 6 contrails bunched together at one time in one part ofthe sky, in another was a very slow-moving (almost stationary) andblinking light - it seemed as if airplanes were all over the placetonight, but I find myself wondering how many were actually airplanes! I ended up on a dirt road off of Austin Rd because I knew from yourreports last month that there had been UFO activity there. I was notdisappointed! I got video and enclosed are still images ofthe event. John D.Jackson, Michigan February 4, 2004, Around 8:10 p.m, in Napoleon,Napoleon Cty., MichiganThe location for these images was just south of where Wolf Lake Roadmeets/crosses Austin Road in Napoleon township, Michigan. It is a dirtroad that was pretty well lit tonight because of the full moon reflecting offthe snow. The weather has been very cloudy in our area, but tonight itcleared up a little. Sequence of images videographed and selected by John D. of unidentifiedaerial object: Video Image 1: 'Object is north of Austin Road flying over an open area inNapoleon,Michigan, around 8:10 p.m. on February 4, 2004. The object was about as high as alow-flyingplane, a few hundred feet or so off the ground.' All images © 2004 by John D. Video Image 2: 'I zoom in on the object. Left side has green light, right side is red. Middle part seems to be composed of two white lights. I was notcompletely sure that this was not an airplane at this point.' "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Video Image 3: 'Object came from northeast on a southwest course heading towardme. It then banked left (it would have passed me on my right, but it had a surprise instore for me instead!). My digital camcorder is just about level with the ground at this point. There was nonoise. After banking left,the object silently ASCENDED at an approximately 70 degree angle with theground! Still zoomingin on the object, I found myself pointing my camera higher and higher, until mycamera was about60 degrees from parallel with the ground. The object was now several times higherfromthe ground than it was before.' Video Image 4: 'After the object ascended I 'un-zoomed' my camera, so that it wastaking in as wide an image as possible. I did this because I knew the moon (upperright) was thereand I wanted a reference point to show the object's upward motion. The object is thelittlewhite dot in the lower left, arrow pointing at it.' Video Image 5: 'The object continues to rise. The moon, the groundand I make a 75 degree angle, so I am NOT pointing my camera straight up at thispoint,which helps demonstrate that the object is really rising (and in a direction parallelwith me)and not just passing straight overhead.' Video Image 6: 'The object rises more. It then banks right and passes me overhead. I lose sight of it while it passes close to the moon (my camera's auto-focus"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"and auto-brightness are the culprits here).' Video Image 7: 'I find the object again after it passes over me. It is moving about as fast as a slow-flying airplane, but makes no noise whatsoever.' Video Image 8: 'I stop videotaping as the object recedes into the distance.'
