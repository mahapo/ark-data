In 2003, there were several complex crop formationsin soybeans in the mound region east and south of Hillsboro.

September 8, 2004 Miamisburg, Ohio - On September 2, 2004, at 9 p.m. Eastern Time,Jeffrey Wilson called me on his cell phone while standing in the middle of \"the mostimpressive corn formation\" he has ever seen. Jeff, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, is Director ofthe Independent Crop Circle Researchers Association (ICCRA). With him was colleagueTed Robertson, (B.S. Biology, Indiana University) from Ellettsville, Indiana, who makesdetailed diagrams of crop formations and who was taking photographs at the time Jeff wastalking with me on the phone. Yesterday and today, Ted sent me e-mails with one of his photographs that shows anunidentified, bright oval to the upper left in the overcast sky. Ted's camera was an OlympusCamedia C 3000 3.3 mega pixel digital camera. Ted used its flash on the High qualitysetting 2048 pixels by 1536 pixels. \"I see three lighter blobs in the photo.

Ted Robertson, (B.S. Biology, Indiana University), Ellettsville, Indiana:E-mail dated September 7, 2004: \"Did not see these in the sky over the crop circle - but then I was not looking either. I did hear a rather high pitched electronic beeping sound the first evening in the cropcircle. It came and went over about an hour. I taped it as it came and went. I playedit to the firemen who accompanied me in the crop circle when they returned andthey had not heard the sound. It was coming from the direction of the firehouse.Somewhere in the field it seemed above the crop towards the firehouse yet theyheard nothing like it. The fire house was struck by lightning two weeks earlier and they lost their phoneand radio. Also two weeks ago the high school that is nearby and owns the fielddecided to build the new school on that ground after choosing among other places. Tonight Roger called to mention that Sharon - who we met last weekend in the cropcircle was there with her son later that weekend at dark and they saw andvideotaped a ball, or balls of light. She said she was making a copy for Kenny Young.That and our friend, Doug, was there last Friday with his daughter at dark and hesaw white flashes directly about 6 feet above the top of the corn. They wereamorphous, cloud-like flashes of light that would repeat about every 2 second andthen stop and then return stronger. He sensed a watchful presence and wasentertained and curious, but his 10-year-old daughter became frightened and beggedto leave - so they did after 10 minutes. There was no sound."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Sincerely, Ted Robertson\" Later on September 8, Ted wrote: \"The image with Jeff inside was taken at the Miamisburg formation the first eveningafter I arrived (September 2, 2004) accompanied by the two firemen who then leftafter about a half hour and then while I was alone I then started to hear and recordthe beeping. About an hour later, Jeff entered the formation and the sound continuedon and off and I had him listen and he also then heard it, too. I took the photoprobably a few minutes later when he might have been talking to you on the phone. The diffuse light areas (oval and pale trail) - one which looks like a trail did notappear in any other photos nor do they look like ordinary tiny particulates that causea near-lens phenomenon that some claim are orbs in the flash. This particular type ofanomaly has not appeared in my photos. I don't know what they are. Could be rain?But it was not raining. The sure way to know how near would be if I had taken themwith a stereo camera, but since I don't own one of these I can't tell how close theyare. My thoughts all of these accounts- the odd picture, beeping story, flashes of lightwhen Doug and his daughter were inside and then especially the new account wheresomeone we met - Sharon who is a MUFON investigator - she claims that she filmedand saw a BOL (ball of light). We have little details.Most importantly we are planning to visit with the woman who said she filmed theBOL and see her video this coming Saturday.So we are still gathering evidence about all these stories and have not really drawnany conclusions.For example, I would like to compare the beeping tones I recorded to similar beepingnoises recorded in crop circles to see if they match. Or maybe you might have anysuggestions as to who might be able to compare these and do a sound spectralanalysis?Jeff just called and reminded me that we have not seen the video of the possible ballof light and that we should hold off from speculation until we can actually see thevideo.I try to tell the whole story as I see it, in addition to what we discover scientifically.So, the other paranormal (lights) aspect is far less definite and may take some time tosort out. As long as the readers are aware that we are not sure what these are - thenthat would be good.Cheers,Te d \" Diagram of Miamisburg, Ohio, CornFormation by Ted Robertson:"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Total measured size of Miamisburg, Ohio, pictogram in tall corn was 220 feet.All plants were laid in clockwise direction.
