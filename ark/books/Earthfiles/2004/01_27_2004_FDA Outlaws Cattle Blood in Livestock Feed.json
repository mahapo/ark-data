January 27, 2004 Washington, D. C. - In its first act to change American lawssince bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or \"mad cow\" disease, wasfound on December 23, 2003, in a Washington state Holstein cow, the Food andDrug Administration (FDA) has announced that no more mammalian blood,blood products or chicken waste can be added to livestock feed. Further, nomeat scraps from large restaurants can be recycled into cattle feed. Factories thatmake food for livestock and food for other animals that use cow ingredients willhave to have separate production lines to guard against accidental contaminationfrom the deadly prion proteins.The diseased Washington cow was tracked through its ear tag ID to beingimported into the United States from Canada in August 2001. The FDAofficially said, \"This one case of BSE does not mean that the U.S. food supply isany less safe today than it was yesterday. Concerning the safety of milk, thescientific data indicate that milk from BSE cows does not transmit BSE.National and international public health organizations have consistently statedthat milk and milk products are safe regardless of whether the country producingthem has had cases of BSE.\"At the same time, the United States Department of Agriculture says it has noplans to test all slaughtered cattle for mad cow disease, saying it is neithernecessary nor justified. Japan - the number one importer of American beef -wants all beef tested for prion disease which has caused a rift between the twocountries.The USDA also says its probe of the one U.S. case of mad cow disease will soonbe complete, as it has lifted a quarantine on five herds of cows linked to theHolstein with confirmed \"mad cow\" disease.We b s it e :http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2004pres/20040126.htmlhttp://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/cjd/cjd.htmCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Republication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
