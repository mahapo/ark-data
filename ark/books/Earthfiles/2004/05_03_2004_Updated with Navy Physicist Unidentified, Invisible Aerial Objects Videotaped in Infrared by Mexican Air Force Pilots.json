FLIR camera engineers are studying the infraredimages. Earthfiles' journalistic goal is to continue updating new information andrefine technical facts as they are clarified. More updates and a special feature aboutinfrared frequencies and infrared technologies will appear in upcoming Earthfilesreports. May 13-14, 2004 Mexico City, Mexico - On April 20, 2004, independent TV producerand journalist, Jaime Maussan - who has worked in Mexico City media for thirty-two years- received a call from Mexico's Secretary of Defense office. Jaime went the next day onApril 21 to meet with General Clemente Vega Garcia, Secretary of Defense, and his staff.One of General Garcia's challenges is to stop narcotics trafficking. He told Jaime that onMarch 5, 2004, Mexican Air Force pilots in the 501st Aerial Squadron were flying a MerlinC26A Bimotor airplane in a routine flight to look for aircraft trying to smuggle drugs nearCiudad del Carmen in the State of Campeche. The Merlin C26A was equipped with FLIR(Forward Looking Infrared) StarSAFIRE II and RADAR APS 143 (V) 3 made byTelephonics (See websites below). In the war on drugs, infrared cameras are used tophotograph the heat from airplanes trying to fly at night without navigation lights to avoidpolice. On March 5, 2004, the FLIR camera recorded on Mini-DV videotape several aerial objectsthat were invisible to the human eye, but made bright heat signatures in the infrared. Threeobjects even showed up on radar indicating reflective mass. Why the rest of the objects didnot show up on radar is not known. All of the unidentified objects are still a mystery.It all began when radar showed an object that was moving 37 miles north of the MexicanAir Force plane, which was moving at approximately 200 mph at an altitude of 11,480 feet.The pilot videotaped off and on with the FLIR camera over a period confirmed on May 14,2004, to be 31 minutes total time according to running clock, but only 11 of those minuteswere actually videotaped in infrared. Below are some of the infrared images arranged inchronological order.Above and be low: Independent TV producer and journalist, Jaime Maussan, talking with threeof the eight Mexican Air Force pilots who had been in the March 5, 2004, flight encounter with themysterious aerial objects that showed up on radar and infrared, but could not be seen by thehuman eye.

The pilottried to approach and identify the area of the infrared images, but they maintained distancefrom the C26A. Once, the objects were seen on the infrared and radar to move closer andsurround the military plane. All the pilots were upset seeing the encircling objects on theirinstruments, but not able to see any physical objects in the sky with their eyes.

To explain in all the scientific basis, this video is going to be verydifficult for anybody who does not want to accept that something is going on.

Jaime Maussan: \"These lights continued moving until they surrounded the plane in thefront, in the center and the back. For that reason, the pilot decided to turn off the lights totry to avoid any conflict with these objects. For some minutes, they felt tension and theywere a little bit afraid, not really threatened, but something unknown. They realized thiswas not normal.Then the objects disappeared, but some of them still chased the airplane for some moreminutes in the back of the airplane at the same speed. For me, that proves that theseobjects have intelligence and at the same time have mass because they were recorded onradar. They have energy because they were recorded with infrared. At the same time, theywere invisible. The pilots and all the crew 8 individuals were not able to see these objectswhen they were no more than two miles away from them. That was very strange for thembecause they were able to see them just through the radar, three at the same time, and theneleven at the same time with the FLIR.WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT THEY COULD SEE THREE OBJECTS AS SOLIDMASSES ON RADAR, BUT THEY COULD SEE ELEVEN OBJECTS BY HEAT IN THEINFRARED.Exactly. But the objects were the same. They were part of the same group, but not all ofthem were captured by the radar. The radar captured one, then two, then three. In theinfrared, they were able to see two at one moment and then eleven more in a differentmoment.\"05-03-04 17:15:44LMarch 5, 2004 at 5:15:44 p.m. local time"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Extreme magnification, and/or object/s closer? \"White hot\" polarity, FLIR camera. 05-03-04 17:16:24LMarch 5, 2004 at 5:16:24 p.m. local time Magnification changed, and/or object/s farther away?\"White hot\" polarity, FLIR camera. 05-03-04 17:26:45LMarch 5, 2004 at 5:26:45 p.m. local time \"White hot\" polarity, FLIR camera. 3-D embossing enhancement of infrared video frame. Invisible Unidentified Objects Surrounded the Mexican Air Force Plane\"DID I UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN THE MEXICAN AIR FORCE PILOT AND HISCREW WERE SURROUNDED, NONE COULD SEE ANY OF THE OBJECTS?That's right. The pilot and his crew were not able at any time to see the objects. Hereceived the information from the radar that have two or three different objects at the sametime in the radar in the back and they had two more at that same moment with the FLIR(infrared camera). For that reason, he (pilot) realized he was surrounded. But he could notsee the objects (with his eyes.)However, he turned off the navigation lights (of Mexican Air Force plane) because hethought he had to do something. He didn't know what was going to happen. To me, that"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"proves he felt some tension. He was not imagining these events.IN TERMS OF TALKING WITH GENERAL CLEMENTE VEGA GARCIA,SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, WHO GAVE YOU THE VIDEOTAPE DID HE HAVE ANYMORE INFORMATION BY APRIL 22ND TO TELL YOU ABOUT HISINVESTIGATION?No, that's the reason he gave me the tape. He said, 'We don't know what they are. We havebeen analyzing them.' I believe he is a very honest man. He gave me this tape to see whatelse could I do with it. I presented this to the Mexican people. This has not been receivedvery well by the scientific community who said that they should have received the videobefore I did.However, this morning the Secretary of Defense announced to all the scientists in Mexicothat they could have a copy of this tape to investigate. The government has nothing to hide.If this is investigated correctly, we have one of the most solid evidences ever, Linda. Any Contact With American Government?DID YOU ASK THE GENERAL IF HE HAS HAD ANY DISCUSSION ORCOMMUNICATION WITH ANYBODY IN THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENTABOUT THIS INCIDENT?No, he didn't tell me. I think he was acting independently and at the same time, he wastrying to be transparent. In Mexico, we have a transparent policy established by thegovernment. I think he was acting according to that policy of the government. He did nottell me anything else.I WOULD ASSUME THAT THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT WOULD WANT TOMAKE CERTAIN THAT WHATEVER THIS WAS FLYING OVER THE STATE OFCAMPECHE IN MEXICO WAS NOT SOME ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY BY THEUNITED STATE S.Well, when you don't see them, see these objects, I don't think the General or theGovernment of Mexico would think that it was the technology of the U. S. because it wasinvisible. That simple reason makes this case a very strange case, Linda. Time Line of Event Was At Least 24 Minutes Based on FLIR Camera ClockThey had enough time on the FLIR camera and radar to prove to them that they weredealing with something definite. This was an interceptor plane and the radar is usually usedjust to locate the airplanes. Then you have the FLIR camera. With that infrared camera,you can use the images that are recorded of any airplane in the area as in trying to capturenarcotic smugglers.We interviewed the expert of the radar, the expert of the FLIR and the pilots for a longtime. Then they gave me all the information. They were very honest. I don't think theywere lying. The Secretary of Defense authorized them to speak openly to me without anycensorship, which means to me that they were acting in their reality, they were acting onpersonal basis telling me exactly what happened.THIS IS WHY THE VIDEOTAPE CAME TO BE BROADCAST ON NATIONALTELEVISION IN MEXICO ON MONDAY NIGHT, MAY 10, RIGHT?Exactly. Because what I wanted to do was to present this to all the Mexican public throughthe national news that are the most important in this country. After that, I did a pressconference yesterday morning inviting everyone that was in Mexico CNN, ABC, BBC,Reuters, AFP, all the international agencies in Mexico and all the Mexican papers andstations in Mexico, Channel 40, Channel 22, Channel 11, all the media was represented inthat press conference. This material was given freely to them because I understand thisbelongs to the people. Nobody has the right to copyright this material.\"Updated More Information:Completely ignoring the invisibility factor, Mexican scientists today are trying to explainthe 31-minute event (of which 11 minutes were videotaped in infrared with the FLIRcamera) as meteorites, electric discharges, ball lightning, or even balloons. Today I talkedwith U. S. Navy Research physicist and longtime UFO investigator, Bruce Maccabee, afterhe discussed the Mexico objects with engineers at the FLIR company in Portland, Oregon,"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"that makes the FLIR StarSAFIRE II infrared camera. Cost $400,000, plus installation cost inairplane.Bruce Maccabee, Research Physicist, U. S. Department of Navy, InfraredApplications, Washington, D. C.: \"This is the first time I've ever heard of a case of radarand infrared and you have to add in no visuals. This is a radar-non-visual-infrared case,which makes it unique. So we are talking about something that is so red that your eyeballscan't pick it up.BUT WHEN YOU GO TO INFRARED, YOU ARE DEALING WITH HEATSIGNATURES AND THEY ARE BLACK AND WHITE?Right. When you go to infrared, first of all you don't know how to assign colors to itanyway. It's not something that you can see. It's a foreign world of vision. About all youcan tell is yes, what degree of hot is it and how much power is it radiating.You can understand the problems we are running into with this thermal imager (FLIR). Ifyou have a home video camera and suppose you have a light bulb with a dimmer switchand you can crank the light bulb up and down in brightness. When you stand back somedistance 10, 20, 40 feet with your camera and you videotape this light bul in the dark withyour camera and then you change the intensity by changing the power with the dimmerswitch from very bright to very dim. The size of the bulb does not change, but the size ofthe image in your camera will. The size will grow with the amount of brightness. Thishappens with all optical systems films, movies, video cameras and also with infraredcameras. So, this infrared imager, when you look at these images, they appear extremelybright what we call saturated. The detectors can't handle any more very saturated and quitelarge.Now, there could be an object out there which is a teeny, weeny thing that is generating anawful lot of energy, power, in that wavelength band(3.6 to 5 microns) and creating thoseimages. The image itself would be big. If you assume the image is the size of the object, youcan project outward to the field and calculate how big it would be if it were a certaindistance. You would be doing a calculation that was much too large.WE WOULD NEED TO HAVE A TIME LINE AND DISTANCE LINE ESTABLISHEDFROM THE VERY FIRST FRAME OF THE VIDEOTAPE TO THE END?That would be nice and if we could establish a specific radar distance that corresponds to aspecific infrared image, then if we have multiple lights up there, then we can tell how faraparts the lights are. It still isn't going to say how big the light source itself was becausethese images are overexposed. If the images were much dimmer, then their size would bemuch closer to what it ought to be.THEY ARE OVEREXPOSED BECAUSE WHATEVER THEY ARE, THEY WEREN'TVISIBLE TO THE HUMAN EYES, BUT THEY MUST BE GIVING OFF A LOT OFHEAT ENERGY?That's right. One of the things I'm hoping the engineers will be able to help us do is find outjust how much energy that would be whether we're talking about milliwatts, or watts, orthousands of watts. And that's going to depend upon trying to duplicate the image.In the situation where you have the very bright ones side-by-side and the two little imagesdown beneath, there is a very faint halo around it.The FLIR engineers told me it was an artifact of the video camera optics. when there is somuch radiation coming in, there are reflections around inside the optics that creates spurios,weak images on the focal plane array. That turns up like a halo around a very bright image.AGAIN, REINFORCING THAT THERE WAS INTENSE ENERGY BEING GIVEN OFFBY THESE OBJECTS.Right. Meteorites? Ball Lightning? Balloons? American Stealth Technology?TODAY I WAS ABLE TO CONFIRM IN JAIME MAUSSAN'S OFFICE THAT THEMINI-DVD OF VIDOTAPE THAT WAS USED BY THE FLIR CAMERA OPERATEDFOR 31 MINUTES FROM BEGINNING TO END. THIS WAS A LONG TIME EVENT.GIVEN THAT FACT, AND THAT THIS INFRARED VIDEOTAPE CAME FROMSECRETARY OF DEFENSE'S OFFICE IN MEXICO, WHY DO YOU THINK ANYSCIENTIST WOULD BE SAYING ONE EXPLANATION, METEORITES, AND TWO,BALL LIGHTNING?"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"And three, balloons.YES, HOW COULD ANY OF THOSE EXPLAIN THESE 31 MINUTES OF THERMALIMAGING OF THIS INTENSITY?Having looked at the video and thought about this for awhile and calculating where theplane was going and how fast it was traveling, the problem with the meteorite explanationis that meteorites just don't last that long and they go a lot faster than an aircraft. Theywouldn't be pacing an aircraft.The ball lightning suggestion doesn't make any sense to me either because even if balllightning were somehow to be generated in this clear air atmosphere no storms aroundsupposedly they wouldn't move at all. They would just appear and disappear somehow orother and not lasting very long, a few seconds. These objects, whatever they were, lastedfor a long time.The last one are the balloons. Balloons can last for a long time, but balloons have a toughtime keeping up with an aircraft that was traveling at 200 mph. especially like circling anaircraft at 200 mph!So, I don't buy any of those explanations.A fourth explanation that has been presented is some top secret Air Craft of device. Somepeople have argued it was stealth aircraft. One argument has to do with stealth aircraftusing infrared devices so they can keep track of each other at night. Of course, this was notat night and stealth aircraft guess what, can be seen in the day time. No one has figured outhow to make them totally invisible yet.
