First Mutilation Jim: Shortly after that, the oldest boy, Joe, had his friends out from Denver. Theywere out going through the woods this was a Sunday morning and they found ourfirst mutilated cow about 200 yards from the house up over the hill. They came backin a panic. They were both 16-years-old. It was snowing heavily and we decided thefirst thing to do was get into town and get the law officer. The boys were prettyupset and we took some time to talk to them because they felt that something wasfollowing them to get them. I assumed it was a natural paranoia.We went out and I followed the route and we found huge footprints that hadfollowed them all the way from the cow to the horse barn and the footprints wereeven in the soft manure inside the horse barn. They were, I guess, 18 inches long. Ididn't measure them, but they were quite large what you would call a 'big foot'footprint. Then immediately, I decided to go get the law officer. I went to the nearest phoneand called the law officer and told him I wanted him out right away. He said hewould be out next Wednesday. I explained the footprints. He said he could not makeit. But there was a bad snowstorm and he did not show up the next Wednesday.When we went out the next day, all the footprints in the snow had been removed,even our own footprints. All of them were just gone. That was pretty upsetting and Iwas pretty angry with the law officer by that time. The mutilation was discovered early Sunday morning. The boys came back about 9a.m. and the footprints were there all day Sunday. But Monday morning they wereall gone. The law officer did not show up, which angered me. Wednesday, when hewas supposed to show up, he still did not and we still had a mutilated cow. The teatswere removed surgically the sac under the teats was not perforated. One eye wasmissing. One ear was missing. And that was it. There was no blood. All the blood hadbeen removed. And there were no tracks in the snow around the cow. It was justthere mutilated. John states that the rectum was also removed. Barbara: There were some funny looking markings in the snow and we found outlater they were caused by owls. We found that it took two weeks after a mutilationbefore any of the wild animals would touch it. 5. Second Mutilation Jim: Fourteen days after the first mutilation, a friend of ours from California, aforest ranger, stopped to visit. We went out walking and were showing the ranch tohim and other friends, including a photographer, Roger, who had been hired fromDenver to take pictures of the mutilated cow. We found our second mutilation, abull, as we were walking over the property and the bull was not ours! Subsequently, I went into town and called the law officer. He said he would like totalk to me, so we met at a restaurant in town. I asked him why I had not heard fromhim and why he was not trying to solve this. He explained to me that they knewwhat the mutilations were and they had known for some time. They only report oneour of four and in this county alone, there had been over 400 reports by that time. Itwas being done by extraterrestrials and they had spoken to the FBI about it. I toldhim that I could not believe it. I said that I could believe that an intelligent racecould travel across space, but to do some of the things they had done to the cow and"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"bull stretched my credulity a little too far. I told him that if he could not solve thecrime, at least don't blame it on something like that. I made an enemy of the man andI frankly did not care because we had lost two cattle. 6. Chased by Dark Shape Jim: The photographer asked if he could come out the next weekend and bring afriend, Harry, with him. These two and Steve, who worked for us, were standing infront of a log cabin about 10 o'clock at night when they heard a strange noise comingfrom the cistern which is southeast from the house and about 60 yards up the slopein the direction of the burned spot. All of a sudden, after listening to this noise, ahuge, dark object pushed its way through the barbed wire and came straight at themdown the hill. They all came running into the house. I went running out right away tocatch whatever it was, and then I thought they were putting me on. We subsequentlywent back and traced the route and sure enough, there were footprints. I removedsome of the hair from the fence, noticing that it just pushed its way through thebarbed wire it didn't jump the fence. But just by force alone (something) spread itand went through. There were long strands of hair I collected the hair and gotphotographs of the footprints coming to the house. By then, I was getting more and more upset about the activities that were building upcontinuously over a period of time. I sent some of the hairs down to Denver to abiogeneticist for examination. His report later was 'no known species.' By then, I wascollecting books and discovered that other people had sent in hair and nothing hadever come of it. One law officer was encouraging me to keep my mouth shut about itbecause he did not want a full-scale panic in the county. I told him I wasn'tinterested in panics I was interested in finding out who was mutilating my cattle. 7. Disk Cruises by House Barbara: It got very heavy after that. The closest you can define it is an emotionalattack of some kind. Everyone went into absolute feelings of fear and depressionwith no stimulant. I have very tractable children; it is amazing how well they getalong. But everyone was fighting with everyone. Just a lot of little paranoidincidents, one after the other. Jim: By this time, I was sleeping on the couch in front of the door with the gun andstaying awake most of the night to catch whoever it was. I was beginning to suspectthat somehow the real estate man was involved in it; that he was trying to make usbreak the contract so he could resell the land. I was lying on the couch about 2 a.m.There was a humming noise again and I raised up and looked out the window. Thedisk came out of the north across our property, very slowly, right in front of the frontwindows and went up the gully past the whole front of the house. Barbara: I did not see the disk. What I saw was the glow from the disk my bedroomwas on the other extreme of the house and I could see a glow over a slight hump. Iscreamed and Jim came running to tell me what he had seen. 8. Friend's Car Chased by Disk Jim: by then, I was getting a little more upset and I went into town. Two of our bestfriends owned the restaurant and we sat down and we talked to them about it. theythen opened up and told us about the property and some of the unusual occurrences.They told us about the people down the road who had just moved into the countyand had mentioned an incident just prior to that. Prior to our moving out there, theircousin and nephew were going down the road past our property. A disk allegedlycame off of our property (it was not ours at that time) and followed the car. Theywent down the road, turned the corner, and pulled into their house. They ran insideand while all the people in the house watched, the disk hovered over the car forapproximately 45 minutes. Later, she went into town and talked about it. Afterhearing this, I went back to the law officer (Sheriff George Yarnell's deputy) andapologized; I had to eat crow over the fact that there obviously was something goingon. We subsequently patched up the friendship and I think we are so-so friends now. Barbara: He has been very supportive in coming out to help when we have hadproblems. Jim: And he (deputy sheriff) moved out there by us shortly thereafter and told methat he frankly was quite scared, but that it was his (law enforcement) duty. He did"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"not feel that he could do anything, but that if we needed him, he would come. Thismade us feel a little bit better. 9. Neighbor Has Seen Lights for Years Jim: We found out that there was a 'Crazy Lady' in the county. We had heard a lotof stories of her calling the law officers with stories of lights over our property,before we moved in. 10. Apparent Harassment by Hairy Creature Jim: During this time, I felt that something was trying to scare us away. We heard aslamming noise and I went out car-to-car, but did not see anything. Then I saw thetrunk light on the dash of the Cadillac. The trunk was locked. I opened it and sawthat the pin switch had been bent over to the side. Something had opened and closedthe trunk and bent it when only I had the key. I again filed that as somethingunusual. Something would continuously come up and beat on the sides of the house twice andrun you know, just like Halloween. Again, I decided it was the real estate man. Iwent down and talked to the law officer again. He requested that I not shootanything. He was afraid that whatever it was could shoot back harder much moreundesirably than I could. So, it continued progressively for some time after thatbeating on the walls and running. I would run out and I would see a big hairy thingrunning. I was tolerating it to a certain degree. One night, I went out and one was running beside the corral and I shot it. Barbaracame running out and when Harry and Roger came back from town, we wenttracking to see if we could find what I had shot. It did not seem to hurt it at all. Therewas a little flinch I'm a good shot, so I know I hit it. There was no blood, no traces,no signs (on the ground). We pursued it on to the property next to us. Then I heardthis most unusual sound. they said it was like a double sound it was a whine withalmost a beeping noise intermixed. The closest sound I think I could describe it to isthe South American primate of some type. Some people said it sounded mechanical.It did not to me. And we roamed around looking, but did not find anything except weseemed to be led in a certain direction. We did not find anything. We returned to thehouse and I notified the law officer (deputy) that I had shot one. He gave me helland told me I was lucky this time and he did not want anybody killed. 11. Communications Jim: They stopped bothering us quite so bad, I think, after that. We came home onenight after shopping the three boys were alone at home. That same sound was goingon to the east and one up by the barn (west) like calling back and forth. It was likethey had an intelligent pattern of communication. It was broken syllables it was notlike animal sounds. It was like it was their communication. I joked and said, 'Well, the least you can do is come down and help us carry thegroceries.' When we went in, the three boys were hidden in the back bedroom,terrified. From what they said, something had been beating on the house continuallythat night. Well, I have a pretty good temper which I have lost only three or fourtimes in my life. I stormed outside I don't remember exactly what I said, but most ofit can't be repeated. I think I threatened that if we can't have the land, then you won'teither I'll blow the whole thing away. I meant it, too. I would have destroyed itbefore I would have moved right then I was so mad. I went into the house, had some coffee and calmed down. Then, since our septictank and toilet were not working, I went outside. While outside, this voice just cameout of nowhere and said four words: 'Dr. Jim, we accept.' I think that was the firsttime I was really shaken, rather than just angered or disoriented. That was all justlike FM stereo, it came from everywhere. I came in the house and was pretty upset. 12. Cars Damaged Jim: One night 'it' destroyed two cars. Barbara has a green Cadillac and a stationwagon. One night when we went to leave, the transmissions on both cars wereinoperable. We had to have both cars repaired. Again, I assume 'they' did it; I'venever had two transmissions go out like that on two good cars. I again felt that we"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"were being driven off and I was still trying to believe it was the real estate man. Bothcars required total transmissions as all the gears were shot. 13. Shiny Black Box Barbara: I was not feeling well that night and I went back to lie down in the darkfor awhile. I had pulled the drape part way on the window creating a triangular area.There were some patches of snow outside and from where I was lying on the bed,the triangular area was lit up by a background of snow patches. I lit a cigarette andas the match went out, I realized that the triangular area was not lit up anymore. I scrambled down to the foot of the bed and looked out. I could see only a middlesection of something that looked like a box. It was black and very shiny. It was notlit, but looked like it reflected light. There was a rounded shape around it it lookedlike something was carrying it under his arm. It was close to the window withinabout two to three feet. There is a line of trees behind the house and it was betweenthe trees and the house. The trees are about four or five feet from the house. I ran into tell everyone what had happened. We ran outside and, as usual, no one could findanything. This has happened more often than not. By the time you tell someone, orget your coat on, you could not find anything. But we found that if we did not turnthe porch light on, we could get out quickly enough to hear something. 14. More Harassment Jim: There were many smaller incidents that were unnerving. A friend of mine fromBoston came out, but I finally had to tell him to go back. He was becoming paranoidand thought that whatever it was had come to get him; he was going to go out and letthem get him because he could not stand waiting any longer. We had several friendscome out who were harassed one way or the other or terrified; a car door openedand closed when it was locked. I went in and talked to the law officer again. If hereally felt we were in any danger, I would move the boys. He said that nobody heknew of had been hurt. They had lost horses, a lot of cattle and animals of one kindor another and people had been terrified. The mutilations were going on at a muchheavier rate during this period this was 1976 the mutilations were occurring weekly. 15. Neighbor Family Terrified, Move Away Jim: About that time, the school bus driver, who was watching a large ranch for theowners and had some cattle of his own, moved back to Nebraska after beingterrified. His son's yearling was mutilated and the boy evidently saw something thatterrified him. Barbara: His mother came over and asked me if we had seen anything like her sonhad seen because his father had not believed him. He had seen something very largeand was really scared. I did not want to discuss it because of the children, but saidthat we had had some strange occurrences.\" Continued in Part 3 Nine Disks Land in Front of HouseCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
