January 2, 2004 Boulder, Colorado - In 1949, the U. S. Bureau of Standardsproduced the world's first atomic clock which counted the rates of vibration incesium atoms. Then in 1972, the world adopted an international time keepingsystem based on atomic clocks. That's when it became necessary to synchronizethe resonance of the cesium atom and earth time as measured by the earth's spin.After 1972, the Bureau of Standards had to insert what are called 'leap seconds'into the atomic time keeping system because the earth's rotation slowed a littlebit each year.But starting five years ago, for the first time, leap second additions have not beennecessary because something unknown has increased the Earth's spin. I talkedabout this phenomenon this week with Fred McGehan at the National Instituteof Standards and Technology Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado.Interview:Fred McGehan, Public Affairs Officer, National Institute of Standards andTechnology Laboratory, Boulder, Colorado: \"The reason we have not had toinsert a leap second for the past five years is that the rate of the earth's spin onits own axis has actually sped up a bit. Scientists are not exactly sure why. Someof the speculation has to do with there might be some shifts in the earth's moltencore; it could be some tidal changes that can effect the earth; or it could be theearth's weather, such as warming of the earth where you might have a melting ofglaciers. No one is absolutely sure why, but there is an agency in Paris theInternational Earth Rotation Service that measures the rate of the Earth'srotation. When they see that rate is out getting out of sync with atomic timekeeping, they order the insertion of the so-called 'leap seconds.' But they havenot had to do that for the past five years. That's what we've been reporting thisyear.SO, WHAT BAFFLES SCIENTISTS IS WHAT COULD BE CAUSING THEEARTH TO SPEED UP JUST ENOUGH SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO ADDTHIS LEAP SECOND.Exactly. I'm sure some people would say it could be caused by global warming.But no one knows absolutely for sure.COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE? WHEN I THINK OF"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"GLOBAL WARMING AND OUR HAVING A THICKER ATMOSPHERE OFCARBON DIOXIDE, YOU WOULD THINK THAT WOULD BE A BIGGERDRAG ON THE EARTH'S ROTATION AND NOT SPEED IT UP.Take the example say of a skater, an ice skater, who spins on their own axis.When they extend their arms, they slow a bit. Then when they pull their armsinto their body, that spin speeds up. For instance, if there is not as much ice andsnow on our mountain peaks in the glaciers, you are in effect changing the shapeof the Earth. Then you could have the effect of speeding up.IF THIS SPEEDING UP CONTINUES AND IT BEGINS TO BE THAT WEWOULD HAVE TO SUBTRACT A LEAP SECOND IN ORDER TO STAY INTIME WITH THE CESIUM CLOCK, WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS?I don't think anyone has postulated that we might need to do that. Right now, ineffect, the Earth is behaving very well as a clock. I haven't heard any speculationas to what might happen if we needed to subtract a second.\"We b s it e :http://www.nist.gov/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
