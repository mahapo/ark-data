June 18, 2004 Ventura, California - One of the most famous names from the beginningof the American rocket and missile programs after World War II is Wernher von Braun.With the defeat of Germany and Japan in 1945 after the United States dropped the atomicbombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Dr. von Braun and 126 other German rocket scientistswere brought to the United States under a government project called \"Paperclip.\" Theywere based at Fort Bliss, Texas and their work was focused at the White Sands MissileRange north of Ft. Bliss in southern New Mexico. The original Project Paperclip Team at Fort Bliss in White Sands, New Mexico, 1940s.Werner von Braun, Ph.D., is sixth from right in front row. Photo from Smithsonian Museum.Werner von Braun, Ph.D., German rocket scientist brought to the United Statesafter World War II to head Project Paperclip at White Sands Missile Range. Project Paperclipwas the U. S. government's assembly of dozens of German physicists to create an Americanspace rocket program as the German scientists had been producing in Peenemuende, Germany,during the reign of Adolph Hitler.

His pioneering work led to the development of"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the Explorer satellites, the Jupiter and Jupiter-C rockets, Pershing, the Redstone rocket,Saturn rockets, and Skylab, the world's first space station. Additionally, his determinationto \"go where no man has gone before\" led America's first landing on the moon in 1969during the Nixon administration.In 1970, NASA asked Dr. von Braun to move to Washington, D.C., to head up the strategicplanning effort for the government space agency. But in less than two years he decided toretire from NASA and and went to work for Fairchild Industries of Germantown, Maryland,where he met a 6th grade school teacher named Carol Rosin. She was famous forproducing a \"Students Studying on Spaceship Earth\" project for her school classes. Dr. vonBraun asked Carol to join him at Fairchild Industries to help him create a ban of weaponsin space. As President Eisenhower had warned about the threat of the \"military-industrialcomplex\" to America's future, Dr. Werner warned that space should be kept free fromintrusion by that same military-industrial power. Carol left her teaching and went to workfor Dr. von Braun in 1974. He was her mentor until he died in Alexandria, Virginia on June16, 1977.Afterward, Carol Rosin has persisted for nearly thirty years in trying to carry out Dr. vonBraun's request to get weapons banned from space. She is now President of the Institute forCooperation in Space and of the Space Preservation Trust Foundation. Last year onDecember 8, 2003, her U. S. Space Preservation Act was placed by Representative DennisKucinich as House Bill 3657 in the 108th Congress. Its statement of purpose: \"To preservethe cooperative, peaceful uses of space for the benefit of all humankind by prohibiting thebasing of weapons in space and (by prohibiting) the use of weapons to destroy or damageobjects in space that are in orbit, and for other purposes.\"Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio) introduced Carol Rosin'sU. S. Space Preservation Act as House Bill 3657 on December 8, 2003.Further, she has written a Space Preservation Treaty to be introduced to nations of theworld for signing through the United Nations to permanently ban basing of weapons inspace.In the past thirty years as Carol has worked hard to carry out Dr. von Braun's challenge toher, she has often thought of his warnings about the misuse of space and an \"Enemy's List\"that he said the American government was using to keep the media and public in support ofPentagon budgets.Interview:Carol Rosin, President, Institute for Cooperation in Space and Space PreservationTrust Foundation, Ventura, California: \"The message that he (Werner von Braun) wasgiving me continually was that we must prevent the weaponization of space fromhappening because otherwise the truth would never be officially acknowledged about whowe were, who we are, as a human species in the universes.Part B to that was the way to achieve peace on this planet is to preserve the peace thatthere must be in space in order for there to be peace on Earth.YOU SAID 'UNIVERSES,' P LURAL?'Universes,' is the way he put it to me. I had never heard that term before. I thought welived in (the only) galaxy solar system universe. But he always used the word 'universes.'AS IF HE HAD KNOWLEDGE OF OTHER UNIVERSES?Exactly.DID HE TALK WITH YOU SPECIFICALLY ABOUT KNOWLEDGE OFEXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Dr. von Braun would have tears in his eyes every time and he repeated this continuously tome when he talked about us in the galaxy he would say 'with a hundred billion stars in ourgalaxy alone. What would make us think that we are the only life form?' That was a verytypical, repeated quote.The other one that he would say is that he knew that we must have peace in space in orderto bring the truth in. The only time he used the word, 'extraterrestrial' and 'alien' and he didthis repeatedly as well was when he spoke to me about the formula for war. That includedthe fact that when I entered the industry, we were in a supposed Cold War with Russia. Hewould say, 'Let's start here where you are.' There are continuous wars and enemiesidentified in order to perpetuate these wars, always with the ultimate goal of seizing thehigh ground of outer space to dominate and control the minds of people on Earth so theywould not be given the truth, truthful information about who we really are in the universes.WHAT WAS HIS DEFINITION OF WHAT WE REALLY ARE IN THE UNIVERSES?Well, this is what he did not describe. I believe what was happening is that he was underthreat. American \"Enemy's List\" to Sustain War Mode and Pentagon BudgetsSoviet UnionTe r o r r i s t sAsteroidsExtraterrestrialsTHAT IS WHY HE GAVE YOU AN ENEMY'S LIST THAT WOULD BEPERPETUATED?That's right. He repeated this continuously. He would say that starting where I entered theindustry with the supposed Russian threat, but never actually existed the Russians weremade to be the enemy. Then there would be terrorists, Third World country threats. therewould be an asteroid threat. They might even say to us to try to influence the public intobelieving that there are many reasons for why we should put weapons in space. Theremight be a reason to protect our assets in space. But, the real one that he was alwaysholding off on and would say again with tears filling his eyes every time he said this to merepeatedly was that the last card they are holding is the 'alien card,' the extraterrestrial cardand none of them are hostile.In any way he could say those words, the intonation was always on, 'None of them arehostile. It's all a lie.' So, in other words, all the enemies that have been presented to us alongthe way it's a lie with always the intention of seizing the high ground to keep the truth fromus.MEANING THE IMPLICATION IS THAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT,PERHAPS EVEN IN COOPERATION WITH AUTHORITIES IN RUSSIA, HAVEPLAYED A GAME OF PERPETUATING ENEMIES IN ORDER TO KEEP THEMONEY FLOWING INTO THE WAR MACHINES?Actually he (von Braun) never implied that the Russians were part of this. He implied tome that the kernel of it was in the United States and that this had to be stopped and hethought that I, as a woman in those days with curly hair and short skirts, could get into anymeeting where a man could probably never say the things that I could. At that time, hegave me the assignment of preventing the weaponization of space. He also mentioned thatwhen he and the other scientists came here (Project Paper Clip) so many rumors werespread about them, that they were Nazis and were horrible people and that was all lies.THAT WAS GERMANY AND PROJECT PAPER CLIP.Yes, of course. I notice that even some people in the peace movement refer to von Braunand the scientists as people who started the Star Wars program (under Reagan). That's justnot true. It's a lie. They were purely scientists who came here to be space and rocketscientists, but they were always sucked up into this system that has been existing in the old,obsolete earth-bound paradigm. At least that's as much intelligence as the population isgiven to keep us in the earth-bound paradigm. But these men were far ahead. These werespace age people.\"DID HE GIVE YOU ANY SPECIFICS ABOUT WHO IN THE UNITED STATES WOULDSTAND TO GAIN THE MOST FROM PERPETUATING A GAME OF WAR FORMONEY AND POWER?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Yes, he described it not as a blame on just a certain group. He described it as the inexorablylinked military-industrial-lab-university-NASA and other space agencies-intelligencecommunity-government complex that it was intertwined, but there was a group that knewall of it. He did not act as if he knew who it was. ET Threat to Perpetuate Military-Industrial-Corporate-Academic ComplexFROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, THE GREATEST SECRET THAT WERNER VONBRAUN WOULD BE HIDING WOULD BE THE FACT THAT THEEXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITY IS A REALITY, BUT HIS CONCERNWAS THAT INSTEAD OF BEING HONEST ABOUT ITS MOTIVATION THAT THE U. S.WOULD ULTIMATELY USE ETS AS ANOTHER THREAT IN ORDER TOPERPETUATE BUDGETS FOR THE PENTAGON?Not just for the Pentagon, but aerospace industries, labs, universities and anyone else whohas a job and makes a profit from keeping this a secret. Although most of the people in theindustry don't even know there is this big secret of all time and yes, you have articulatedthis very beautifully. You are not at all putting words in my mouth that's exactly what I'msaying. Except that it's not the influence of just people in the Pentagon. This is some how,as he would put it, inexorably linked to all the facets of profit-making, of so-called securityand defense mechanisms, of people who just need a job to survive and pay for their kids'college education and also to keep the public stupid.I have felt that since this happened, since I learned from the heart of von Braun, that thishuge secret is being kept it has to have something to do with the 'off-planet culture,' that Icall OPC phenomenon that in fact, it was so real that this man could hardly talk about thisbig secret and did not because of the threats to his life and probably to the lives of otherswho worked with him who might or might not have known. But he certainly did. Why Doesn't China Speak Out About ETs?I did not put all this together for many years. I was one of the people in a state of denialmyself. I was a high paid woman executive in an aerospace company who had been givenan assignment from Werner von Braun, but always thought of myself as just an educator, aschool teacher, to keep weapons out of space so that as he would repeat continuously, 'Thetruth would not only be revealed, disclosed' - that official acknowledgement has happenedin different parts of the world, but not in the United States. I'm an official adviser to China.I've talked with a lot of people over there and I feel they know the secret, but being whatthey consider to be the Middle Kingdom, they wait for other countries including the UnitedStates to come forward. They are not what I would call initiators of something so powerful.But they are very much seekers of the truth and working on these issues.MEANING THEY ARE WAITING FOR THE UNITED STATES TO HOLD THATGLOBAL PRESS CONFERENCE OF ALL CENTURIES TO SAY WE'RE NOT ALONEIN THE UNIVERSE, AND NOW WE ARE GOING TO INTRODUCE YOU TOEXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES?I actually had years ago one of the (Chinese) scientists at a university tell me that that iswhat they were waiting for. And I said, 'Well, if you know the truth, why don't you gopublic with it?'They said, 'Well we wait because we consider ourselves to be of the Middle Kingdom andwe don't want to be aggressive in any way, even though (China) has been identified as oneof the potential enemies against the United States. But they are not. And neither are theRussians or any other country that I know of except for the individuals or parts of culturesthat we have antagonized so much that they are so angry with us at this time.So, I think Werner von Braun saw this back in the 1970s. He died in 1977. Back into the1940s and 1950s was when he started to become aware of what the potential benefits ofouter space were to humanity."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Carol Rosin founded, and is President of, the Institute for Cooperation in Space and Space PreservationTrust Foundation, Ventura, California. Click http://www.pe ace inspace .comMust Prevent Weaponization of SpaceBut what he always added on to his talks with me that for years I did not say because of theridicule factor was this message that we must prevent the weaponization of space fromhappening and that the big lie is that none of them are hostile, talking about this list ofpotential enemies against whom we have been taught to fear and even hate that none ofthem are hostile. We are all essence and none of them are hostile haunted me for years untilthe early 2000s I started to learn about high level military intelligence, corporate people,who had already gone public by saying things like that, but also by emphasizing the factthat we must keep weapons out of space and that there is other life in the universe.I'm just tuning into it myself and it has caused me to work with people around the worldwho want to get a Space Preservation Treaty signed and we do have a companion bill in theCongress that was introduced even before the treaty came forward by Congressman DennisKucinich (Dem-10th Congressional District, Ohio) and others who co-sponsored it to callfor a ban on ALL space-based weapons. We don't have to study which ones. It would alsoprevent the destruction or damage of anything in space that is in orbit. In other words, oursatellites that we need to verify what is in space coming in (toward Earth) and what is onEarth so we can see the Earth to reduce and eliminate missiles and nuclear weapons andother dangerous and polluting technologies on the planet.This must be done we must protect those satellites and they should NOT be used as 'forcemultipliers' in war games which is the old scenario. But that is happening.WHY DO YOU THINK ADVANCED INTELLIGENCE ONE OR MORE OF THEM WOULD EVEN ALLOW THE UNITED STATES OR ANY COUNTRY ON THISPLANET TO DEVELOP WEAPONS IN SPACE? WHY WOULDN'T THEY INTERFEREBECAUSE IT IS TOO DANGEROUS?From my information, they do not interfere. They will not, however, allow us to take ourweapons and toxins into space. They will, however, let the human species do whatever itdoes to itself. That's the information I've been given and that's what I see happening. I haveno evidence myself for this, but I've read that OPCs (Off-Planet Cultures) have shut downthe attempt to put operational weapons in space. I have also been given information thatthey will not interfere with what we do. However, there is a possibility that they wouldleave if we set off nuclear bombs, nuclear technology, and/or continue with thespace-based weapons program.I am moving to Ecuador now, but we have an office still in Vancouver, B. C., Canada andpeople I'm working with here will continue in the United States. I'll be doing it fromEcuador. But I'm 60 years old now and I've gone through this issue for 30 years now dayand night, holding as von Braun did this piece of information about this big lie that's beingtold this canopy of lies that especially in the U. S. and because we keep it such a big secrethere has been kept over our heads. It's like we live behind this veil of secrecy and so manyof us who know pieces of it whether it's intuitively or by experience or by a learningprocess we keep way under the radar. We talk about it at dinner from a non-believing stateto a giggle to an 'Oh, my God! This is real!'BUT, CAROL, IF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAS ALREADYMILITARIZED SPACE OF THIS PLANET, HOW COULD WE POSSIBLY ACHIEVE ATREATY NOW TO ELIMINATE SPACE-BASED WEAPONS?Because we have not weaponized space. There are not operational weapons in spacepatrolling us at this time. We have just enough time that's how to get a Space Preservation"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Treaty signed into law. You can see this treaty draft on www.peaceinspace.com. You canalso see the companion Space Preservation Act now in 2004 the number is H. R. 3615that's been introduced into the Congress (by Rep. Dennis Kocinich). Congress in the U. S.and this Administration are not going to produce a ban on space-based weapons. In fact,the next administration might not either, UNLESS we get world leaders to sign the SpacePreservation Treaty. That treaty getting signed would put the necessary pressure that weneed on the U. S. Congress and Administration. So, the answer is now available to us, wehave the bill in Congress and a real treaty to be signed.AND IF THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN, CAROL, WHAT IS THE WORST CASESCENARIO IN YOUR MIND?In my mind, it's inevitable obliteration of the human species. I believe that is a verypossible reality. I think we are very close to it, we are in grave danger from any one of anumber of manmade or natural disasters that could occur.BUT CHINA, FOR EXAMPLE, IS GOING TO BE GOING TO THE MOON SHORTLYAND THE U. S. IS CONCERNED ABOUT CHINA AS A POLITICAL FORCE ON THEEARTH. I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER IF WE ARE HEADED TOWARDTERRITORIAL CONFLICTS ALREADY IN THE NEXT 5 OR 6 YEARS ABOUT WHOIS ON THE MOON.We are headed toward territorial conflicts in space and on the moon. That's the whole pointof this in the earth-bound context and paradigm. But China does not want weapons inspace. Their leaders have said that for many decades. So has Russia said that. These are thetwo main space super powers with the United States.THAT'S WHY THE WERNER VON BRAUN STATEMENT THAT THE UNITED STATESWOULD USE AS AN ENEMY'S LIST EXTRATERRESTRIALS IS SIGNIFICANTHERE, BECAUSE WE WOULD THEN JUSTIFY SPACE-BASED WEAPONRYAGAINST EXTRATERRESTRIALS?That we would justify space-based weapons against any country that the U. S. populationand government leaders will buy into as long as that scenario holds.By the way, everything that I've just said to you has already been proven to come true. In1977, I was talking about the fact that there was going to be a Gulf War because I was in ameeting when it was being planned. In 1977! It's one of the reasons I woke up and resignedfrom my cushy position in the industry. I couldn't believe there was a chart on the wall ofpotential enemies against which we were going to build space-based weapons that I andmost people in the room had never even heard of. This is how these wars are planned and Iwent forward with that story for years.And then three months before the first Gulf War started, my husband as my witness will tellyou that I sat down watching TV waiting for the war with even my husband saying, 'Carol,you've flipped out.' You've gone over the top. No one is talking about a war in the Gulf.'Because there was a certain amount of money in the space-based weapons program that Iwas told would be in it when they were ready to pulling space-based weapons to test thenext phase of weapons.By the way, part of the formula that I didn't mention earlier that is part of the creating thescenario of enemies and wars leading to the potential extraterrestrial threat is that theyhave to have these wars in order to dump the old weapons, test the new weapons, andrationalize the budgets for the next set of weapons. This is what they educate the publicand the leaders about in order to get their next enormous budgets. Notice how in each war,if you track the weapon systems that have been used, they are aiming toward the mostadvanced weaponry, the most horrific weaponry, that the human species has mostly yet toimagine. But that's what is being tested in each war, aiming at always seizing the highground and putting these weapons up in space. Because if you put these weapons up ingeosynchronous orbit just 22,300 miles above the earth in just three spots ingeosynchronous orbit, you hit the whole footprint of the entire Earth. you can control theEarth from that location in just three spots. Imagine what they could do with the highestforms of weapons technology. 2012?DID DR. VON BRAUN EVER SAY ANYTHING TO YOU ABOUT THE YEAR 2012 ASBEING SOME KIND OF END YEAR? THAT THERE WOULD BE DANGER IFSOMETHING WAS NOT ACCOMPLISHED BY THAT YEAR?No, he did not ever mention that to me, but what he did say about the timing is that thetiming was critical to keep weapons out of space. His timing was with a sense of urgency"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"that, 'Before the momentum of funding vested interests and technology is put into placethat is as dangerous as is the deployment of operational weapons themselves, we mustachieve a ban on all space-based weapons on this planet.'\"Website:http://www.peaceinspace.comCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
