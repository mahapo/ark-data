(Continued ) The Macabre Case of \"Agent\" Robert L. Malone Mrs. Robert Malone's Interview Comments Continue from Part 13:1958: Bob was the 'consummate man' - all man. He was a hero. Hewas a he-man. He was tough and dedicated to the Corps and the rightwhich, in his mind, was anything pro-America. But he was also verytender and nurturing. In uniform, he was tough, but never without acause. He was an admirable man of many talents and deepconvictions. I was proud of my husband. 1961: We had to go to the Presidio for an examination and it washere he reiterated not to let the Army do surgery on him and never lethim out of my sight. He was very concerned that if he went in, he'dnever come out and be able to leave. 'I know too much,' he said, 'andwe're getting much too close.' It was a very hard life being under allthese pressures. Three months later at Bridge Motel on Lombard Street, it was herethat an enlisted man approached us and asked for Colonel Malone. Iasked who wanted to know and he was evasive, officious andunpleasant. After that, we moved to El Cajon briefly and then to Ocean Beach,California. Once in San Diego, the calls became more frequent andBob started to feel ill until one day in 1964, after several years ofrelative quiet, Bob hemorrhaged and had to go into the hospital.They decided at Balboa Naval Hospital to do surgery. After thesurgery, Bob did well until orderlies dropped him in the bath andripped open his stitches. During his stay, I had occasion to talk withthe military wives of high ranking officers in the Naval Ward. Thestrange thing was that each one - one by one - and even though allwere in the hospital for minor problems - all were dead or passed offas dead within a week. I ranted and raved to get adequate care for my husband while he wasthere. I spent every waking hour with bob and took Nancy out ofschool while Bob was hospitalized. After the fall, they said Bobdeveloped pneumonia and needed a tracheotomy. Bob was veryapprehensive and constantly worrying about us and what theoutcome of this stay would be. I didn't understand any of it, but hisdesperate state of mind kept me fighting to protect him in every way Icould, especially after watching the other wives lose their husbandsfor such trivial and routine procedures. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Then on July 26, 1961, we got to the hospital in the morning andspoke with Bob in the Critical Care Unit and he seemed differentsomehow, talking about seeing lights. I sent Nancy out to wait for meand I could see Bob needed his trachea tube cleaned, but the 'bird'wasn't there. So, I called the nurses to get one there and I called tothe doctor to get one there. There was no hurry on the part of any ofthe responses to my husband's needs. It just blew my mind. Therewere few patients and no real care going on. Boy, did those guys hateme and my questions and complaining. they were all very negligent atthat hospital. The next thing I knew, I was being told to wait in thewaiting room and there was a flurry of activity - almost calculated. Ashort time later, a doctor came in and told Nancy and me that Bobhad 'expired.' I told the doctor I wanted to see my husband and herefused. I never did get to see him to say good-bye and neither didNancy. That's when I started wondering about what happened? Youknow when you later reflect over circumstances that don't seem quiteright. Then I tried to see Bob at the morgue, but couldn't get in. Then, Itried to have an open casket ceremony for his burial - no deal.Nobody would let me see my husband's remains and that alone wasclearly fishy, especially after all of his concerns and pleading with meto never allow him to be taken to the hospital or to be left alone. Afterwards, I was in shock and now for whatever reason, he was goneand I had to think of surviving with Nancy. I contacted Frank whoknew Bob and his background. He said he'd keep his promise to Bobto help Nancy and me. One day when I went home to look for papersI needed to get Bob's pension from the Army, I couldn't find them. Ihad this suitcase full of Bob's papers and important documents and itwas gone. I know it had been there before because I had seen itrecently and now it was not here. I turned that apartment upsidedown looking for it. then, when I tried to get Bob's proper rankingafter all his years in the military, they denied his rank and the pay Iwas entitled to. Then, when I complained about the treatment thehospital gave Bob, I was told 'You can't sue the military.' I was lost. Iwas 36-years-old and already out of the labor market back then anddependent on Bob's pension. The whole life we had looking backwas so strange to begin with and then to have such a vague andnebulous ending was really bizarre and upsetting.\" Comments from interview with daughter, Nancy Malone,born December 26, 1949, at Camp Carson, Colorado Daughter, Nancy Malone: \"Previous to 1955, I have very mixedrecollections of life with my mom and dad. I don't remember everseeing my dad in uniform. He was around most of the time incomparison to most kids whose fathers were gone all day to work.But he got called way a lot - all hours of the day and night. Wemoved a lot before I started school and though not as much after, westill moved more than most people until I was 11 years old. I remember living mostly in the desert which I hated and in prettyisolated places. I had no friends to play with and spent a lot of timeby myself. It was a very lonely time for a child growing up so rootlessand transient. But I became very adaptable. My mom back then didn't seem to have much of a life or personality.I remember her talking endlessly to my dad when we'd drive to a newplace - always at night when we lived in the desert - cooler, dad said.But we'd just leave everything behind and start all over some placenew in Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada - that area. And always closeto an Air Force base or proving grounds."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" My dad was the consummate military man - John Wayne - all theway. His life and first love and loyalty was the Army. He'd tell mestories of his horse, Mickey, in the Calvary and a little about his dadsaying being an Indian and Irish was something he was very proud of,but it was hard straddling two worlds so he just went all Army. Then one day, when I was 5 or 6, dad came home late after one of hisresponses to a call. He told mom and me about the reality of 'otherlife than ours,' creatures with big heads, big eyes and frail bodies andlong, thin fingers. He said he wanted us to know they existed, but wecould not tell anyone. I keep thinking this is when my dad said he hitone and took it to the Army guys, but my mother says we were withhim when he hit one and she saw it - and, yes, he took it to theauthorities. We saw the lights in the sky frequently. I grew up knowing 'life notlike ours existed' and it made me question religion all my life. It washard keeping that secret when everywhere people said UFOs andcreatures did not exist. I remember we were in South America for awhile and the same thingthere - calls and off my dad would go. Then, back to the States. 1957: We were back in Nevada, this time in Las Vegas for 2 years.Until that time, we'd never stayed anywhere longer than a couple ofmonths to a year. 1959: We were back in Vegas until 1960, then we went to thePresidio in San Francisco a year later. It is there that my father reallystarted getting agitated about what would happen to him if he had togo into the hospital and warning my mom to not let them do surgeryand to stay with him. 1960-1961: We lived in Gardena, California, for a year until Igraduated. It is here that, I believe, a 'contact' was made because myexperience here was like no other previously. My mom and dad leftme alone for the first time in my whole life at home so they could gosomewhere, at my insistence. As I sat in my room on my bed listening to Debussy's Lauter, Ibelieve I became aware of a presence and sound in my closet. Theroom was dark. I was in the bed. The window was to my left and thedoor at the foot of the bed to the right and next to the closet. As Istrained to see in the little light there was, a clicking noise got louderand then I noticed a shadowy form somewhat stooped in the closet.Scared the hell out of me! I pressed completely up against the walland stopped the music with my left hand and drew covers up aroundme. I sat there a moment and thought I must be imagining thismoment, but then whatever it was came out of the closet with itshands outstretched and advanced very slowly. The clicking continuedand I thought maybe it was the nails on the hands. The eyes were bigand stared incessantly. Scaly Reptilian Face With the dim light, I could not see features well, but now and again, Icaught like a shadow - highlighted a bit. It was scaled and had a shortreptilian muzzle and ridges on the mouth or it might have been teeth.It moved so slowly, I was almost hypnotized by the movement. Then,I snapped out of it and in one bound went for the door dragging bedclothes all over behind me. I turned into the bathroom right outsidemy door and locked the door. Then, squatted behind the commode -I was terrified. Then, the thing started scratching on the door - not"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"trying the handle or shaking anything - not even really like trying toget in - just scratching, long scratches down the door. A few minuteslater, the scratching stopped as I heard my dad open the front door.When he came in with my mother, they gasped and yelled for me. Iwas scared to death. Although looking back, if whatever that was hadwanted to 'get me,' it would have had no problem. 1962: We moved to a new apartment and moved again to a differentapartment in the same complex that was nicer. My dad started easingoff being away as much. But he got more worried as his healthdeteriorated a bit more - that the military would 'do something to himif he went into a hospital for any reason!' He warned mom aboutwhat to do if there were any problems and to stay with him, againjust like he did at the Presidio. Well, his ulcer, I guess, startedbleeding and he went and fell in the bathroom one day and had to gointo the hospital for tests and surgery. Mom was frantic. She'd yell atorderlies and nurses to get him things he needed and asked questionsendlessly. The people at the hospital hated my mother and herinsistence on staying there at all hours. Me - they wouldn't allowmuch in the area. Dad went through the operation and was doing finewhen one day we were told an orderly had dropped (dad Malone) inthe bath and ripped open his stitches. This was about a week after hissurgery. He was put in intensive care. But within a week, one day when mymom and I came to see dad in the morning, my dad told my mom thathe had seen lights. She came in to me in the waiting room after tryingto find a 'bird' to clean out his trachea. The nurses wouldn't let momback into the unit and a few minutes later, a doctor came out and saidmy father had 'expired.' They wouldn't let my mom see his body.Now, my mom was already agitated from the fight she'd had the lasttwo weeks with the personnel and the experiences she had with otherofficers wives in the same ward whose husbands came in for routinethings and ended up supposedly 'dead' - all within days of oneanother. Ward 6D, I believe. That was too strange, even for a child of14 like me to swallow. Especially a child of 14 with a mother ascurious and aggressive about care as my mother was. She freaked outwhen they wouldn't let her 'say good-bye' or see him. That was thelast time I saw my dad, that morning. I remember him saying howhe'd seen 'lights' the few minutes I talked to him and he wanted totalk privately with my mom and it didn't seem to me he was havingany problems. That's why I was so confused about it. Well, my mother never believed he was dead, but there was not muchshe could do. She tried to see him at the morgue - no way. She triedto have an open casket burial - no way. Everything my mom tried toget to see the body, the Army blocked. Or in this case, the Navybecause he was at Balboa Naval Hospital in San Diego. We wenthome in stunned silence. She left me with friends and for two weeks,my mom disappeared. That was hard on me. My dad was my world. Iplayed and went to the movies with my mom, but I didn't have thesame connection to her as my father. I was devastated and her leavingfor two weeks, not knowing what happened to her or where she was.I was abandoned n grief and totally desolate. I never believed hedied. After all that happened and I went to the funeral which wasbefore mom left and was so angry, I couldn't cry. When mom cameback, she said she'd kind of had a 'lost weekend' trying to figure outwhat to do. She contacted my Uncle Frank like dad had told her to,but it was awhile before I actually saw him. Then, she tried to get herpension from the government for his military service and thegovernment denied his rank and gave her way less than she wassupposed to have. And she kept saying, 'You can't fight thegovernment.'\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Stringfield: In the brief history recorded here of the Malone case, I nevercame to any conclusion as to the meaning of his 'double' life of chasing orbeing chased by UFOs. UFOs are redundant in the lives of the Malones as is the case amongabductees, but at no time did any of the Malones claim they wereabducted. To add to the mystery is a comment by Georgeanne that really makes thecase macabre. She said, 'The cemetery man (caretaker) and the mother donot believe there is a body in the ground. He told her, \"There wasn't anycasket buried there in 1964.\" Stringfield's Epilogue in Part 15.Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
