Theinstrument will help scientists analyze and understand Martian rocks and soilsby taking very high resolution, close-up images. The first surprise was theclumpy nature of the red soil and some planetary geologists wonder if anelectrostatic binding of the dust could be at work.

Clumpy Martian SoilMicroscopic examination of Martian soil shows odd clumpiness.Image credit: NASA/JPL/US Geological Survey.This close-up look at a patch of Martian soil is the sharpest image ever taken onanother planet. The picture was captured by Spirit's microscopic imager.Scientists liken the alien soil to clumpy cocoa powder.The actual size of the soilpatch shown here is 3 centimeters (1.2 inches) across. Scientists think the soilmight have some cohesive properties, perhaps electrostatic binding. Otherspeculation has raised the question of moisture in the soil.Spirit Close-Up Images of Martian RocksColor images of the first Martian rocks examined by the Spiritrover on January 18, 2004, in the Gusev Crater. Above: \"Adirondack.\"Below: \"Sushi\" with dark square in lower right frame.Image credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell.NASA reported today about the Adirondack image, \"The true color image takenby the panoramic camera onboard the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit shows therover's first target rock, \"Adirondack.\" Spirit traversed the sandy Martian terrainat Gusev Crater to arrive in front of the football-sized rock on Sunday, Jan. 18,2004, just three days after it successfully rolled off the lander. The rock wasselected as Spirit's first target because its dust-free, flat surface is ideally suitedfor grinding. Clean surfaces also are better for examining a rock's top coating."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Scientists named the angular rock after the Adirondack mountain range in NewYork. The word Adirondack is Native American and is interpreted by some tomean 'They of the great rocks.'\"We b s it e :http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.govCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
