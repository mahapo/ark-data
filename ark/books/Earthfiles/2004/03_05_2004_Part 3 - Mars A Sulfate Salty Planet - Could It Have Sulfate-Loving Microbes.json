Â© 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe Mars and deep gash of Valles Marinaris, largest canyonin the solar system,by the Hubble Space Telescope. March 5, 2004 Pasadena, California - When the Opportunity rover's rockabrasion tool (RAT) drilled a hole in a piece of Martian bedrock called\"McKittrick\" in late February, NASA/JPL scientists were surprised that thesulfur content jumped up four times higher than the amount registered on thesurface of the rock. When the rover moved over to another piece of bedrockcalled \"Guadalupe,\" the sulfur amount jumped up to five times more thanmeasured in the soil. At this week's NASA press conference in Washington, D.C., respected geochemist, Benton C. Clark, member of the Mars Explorer Rover(MER) science team and Chief Scientist of Space Exploration at LockheedMartin said, \"This supposed rock now looks like it is a chemical sediment.\"Sedimentation of high concentrations of sulfur and sulfate salts on earth meanssolution in water, the water evaporated, and left the salts.At the press conference, geochemist Clark compared the surprisingly highbedrock sulfur concentration to a common household product on Earth.Interviews:Benton C. Clark, Ph.D., Geochemist and member, Mars Explorer Rover(MER) science team and Chief Scientist, Space Exploration, LockheedMartin: \"We interpret this sulfur to be the compound, sulfate, and so the saltthat we think is probably most prevalent is magnesium sulfate, MgSO4. You canbuy it in your drugstore. It's known as Epsom salts.Epsom salt crystals that can grow in places like the Dead Seaand Great Salt Lake, Utah, that have very high concentrations of salt.The only difference is that the Epsom salts has a lot of water in it and we think itis more dehydrated on Mars. In that case, its called Kieserite named after Dr. D.G. Kieserr who happens to be from Germany which is one of the classic placesin the world where Kieserite occurs. So it is very relevant that a Germaninstrument helped discover this mineral here on Mars."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" The Mineral Kieserite* Chemistry: MgSO4 - H2O, Hydrated Magnesium Sulfate.* Class: Sulfates* Group: Kieserite* Uses: As a minor source of magnesium and as mineral specimens.Kieserite, which is named after D. G. Kieserr, forms in marine evaporite depositswhere sea water has been concentrated and exposed to prolonged evaporation.Other marine evaporite minerals include calcite, dolomite, gypsum, anhydrite,halite, polyhalite, kainite, picromerite, carnallite and sylvite, among severalothers. Evaporite minerals are geologically important because they clearly arerelated to the environmental conditions that existed at the time of theirdeposition, namely coastal arid. They also can be easily recrystallized inlaboratories in order to postulate their specific characteristics of formation.Specimens of kieserite must be stored in a closed container as they will absorbwater from the air and convert to the mineral epsomite, MgSO4 - 7H2O. If laterthe mineral dehydrates, it will form the mineral hexahydrite, MgSO4 - 6H2O.Kieserite lends its name to a group of sulfates called the Kieserite Group. Thesesulfates are all monoclinic, have medium sized cations and are mono-hydrated(one water molecule). The general formula of this group is ASO4 - H2O, whereA can be either magnesium, iron, copper, manganese, nickel and/or zinc.These are the members of the Kieserite Group:* Dwornikite (Hydrated Nickel Iron Sulfate)* Gunningite (Hydrated Zinc Manganese Sulfate)* Kieserite (Hydrated Magnesium Sulfate)* Poitevinite (Hydrated Copper Iron Zinc Sulfate)* Szmikite (Hydrated Manganese Sulfate)* Szomolnokite (Hydrated Iron Sulfate)Sulfur/Sulfate Concentration in \"Guadalupe\" Bedrock - 40%Red circles indicate grinding areas for Opportunity's rock abrasion tool (RAT)in which a very high sulfur content of 40% was confirmed in theupper Guadalupe bedrock. Image: NASA/JPL/Cornell.Ben Clark: \"Kieserite, plus the chlorides from the chlorine that we saw, add upto a salt concentration that might be as high in this Guadalupe occurrence of40% of the outcrop. This is an astounding amount of salt. This can no longer beconsidered to be just simply a volcanic construct of some kind. So, we have asalt and some kind of soil or maybe ground up rock mixture with that. The onlyway you can form such large concentrations of salt on Earth normally is todissolve it in water and have the water evaporate.IF YOU WERE TO FIND OUTCROPS FULL OF SULFUR AND SULFATESLIKE THIS ON EARTH, WHAT ARE THE ODDS THAT YOU WOULD FIND"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"EVIDENCE OF LIFE IN EITHER FOSSIL FORM- OR EVEN ALIVE - INTHIS KIND OF SALTY ROCK?In addition to physical evidence of fossils, you can have chemical evidence. So,it turns out that sulfur is one of those tracers that works quite well in isotopicfractionation.When living organisms process sulfur, they tend to fractionate the isotopes in adifferent way than when purely mineralogical or geochemical processes do.I've always had a favorite organism (de sulfo .... Latin name) which is anorganism that can live off of sulfates as we find in these rocks that needs somehydrogen to go with it. But that's an energy source. It can work independent ofthe sun. The reason I like the one organism is that it can form spores as well. Soit can hibernate over interim times when Mars gets between the warmer spellsand the differences in obliquity that we know about.So there are organisms and there are ways to look for traces of them, but to dothe isotopic analysis, you're probably going to have to have the samples back onEarth.\" Halophiles, Sulfate-Loving Microbes on EarthSome of the sulfur/sulfate salts-loving bacteria Ben Clark was talkig about areknown as Halophiles. In the 2001 Encyclopedia of Life Sciences aboutHalophiles, researchers at the University of Massachusetts wrote:\"Preliminary studies have suggested that this microbial activity occurs insome deep-sea hypersaline basins and viable microorganisms can berecoverable from brine inclusions in ancient salt deposits over 100million years old.\"Shiladitya DasSarma and Priya Arora, University of Massachusetts,AmherstOn earth, there are even fossils of organisms 3.5 billion years old that resemblemodern microbes in salty seas. Comparing Earth Salts-Loving Filamentous Microbes onEarthto Unidentified Filaments Near Spherules on MarsWhat is amazing is to look at images of salt-loving microbes on earth andcompare them to the unidentified filaments near spherules in one of theopportunity microscope images. They look very similar but nothing has yet beenproved and might never be until humans can walk on mars and collect samplesfirsthand. Also see: Earthfiles 02/20/04.

The lower arrow points at a filamentthat bends.For size context, each of the pebbly grains below the larger round spherule and other rocksis about100 to 200 microns in diameter, about the size of a sugar grain. So the two long,unidentifiedfilaments laying on the little soil grains are about 1 to 2 microns in diameter.Source of image: Opportunity Microscopic Imager Non-linearized Full frame EDRacquired on Sol 19 (February 12, 2004) of Opportunity's mission to Meridiani Planum atapproximately at approximately 11:25:52 Mars local solar time, Microscopic Imagerdust cover commanded to be OPEN. Microscopic image credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell/USGS.Unfortunately, the Spirit and Opportunity rovers on Mars do not have anyequipment to test for organics. They are only focused on geology. I talked aboutthat problem with John Grotzinger, Professor of Geology at the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology and one of the team leaders on the rover missions. Challenge of Identifying Substances on MarsThere are big scientific challenges in identifying substances millions of milesaway on the Martian world. At the March 2, 2004, NASA press conference inWashington, D. C., I learned from German geologist, Goestar Klingelhoefer,Ph.D., that his Mossbauer spectrometer needs an area of about 1.5 centimeters"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"in order to get accurate readings about iron and other elements. Very smallobjects such as the many unidentified spherules, or \"blueberries,\" at theOpportunity Meridiani Planum site are too small for the Mossbauer to get anaccurate reading on one, or even a few. The spherule diameters range from 1 to5 millimeters. Mysterious Spherules Have \"Tails\" and \"Grow On Stems\"To date, what those mysterious little balls are made of is still a mystery. Afterthe rock abrasion tool (RAT) was used to grind into the spherules embedded inthe rock, the cross sections even reveal a \"tail\" on one. In another panoramicview of the bedrock, some of the spherules seem to be \"growing\" on stems.Spherule embedded in Martian bedrock ground into byrock abrasion tool (RAT) on Sol 37 by Opportunity Microscopic Imager.Click here for original image source: NASA/JPL/Cornell.Spherules \"growing on end of sticks\" from Martian bedrock photographedon Sol 37 by Opportunity Panoramic Camera.Click here for original image source: NASA/JPL/Cornell.So, in the next couple of weeks, it is hoped that the Opportunity rover can putits robotic arm and various sensors - including the Mossbauer - down against aconcentration of the spherules. The idea is that the instruments would then havea dense, larger area in which to take measurements.The size of the area needed for the rover instruments to retrieve meaningful data"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"is one of the limitations on these missions. Prof. James Rice of Arizona StateUniversity explained the problem in determining the elemental composition ofthe small filaments in one of the spherule photographs. You can see an image ofthe filaments and spherules in my Earthfiles.com reports about anomalies at theOpportunity landing site. The filaments are only microns in diameter andanything down in the few microns range is too small for the instruments' abilitiesto analyze.Looking for microbial-sized life forms - if they exist in fossils or alive - is a hugechallenge. When the European Space Agency (ESA) released their aerial imageof Spirit's landing site in the Gusev crater, there was a light green colorthroughout the crater that provoked some in Europe to speculate it might beevidence of algae or other living substance. See: Earthfiles 01/31/04. But whileinterviewing geologist and MIT Professor, John Grotzinger, at the NASA pressconference, I learned that NASA/JPL scientists strongly disagreed with the ESAgreen coloration. Prof. Grotzinger said the confusion was a selected mineralfrequency and not literally green growth on the Martian crater surface.Recently, another respected JPL/NASA scientist, Dr. David Des Marais,hypothesized that liquid salty water, or brine, might exist on or near the surfaceof the Martian soil and might explain why some of the rover wheels seemed topick up soil as they moved. Other scientists argue that moisture in the surfacesoil is not possible at the cold temperatures and very low atmospheric pressureon Mars and that the clinging soil could be explained by \"electrostaticattraction.\"The public wants to know if there is any life on Mars - microbial or other.NASA scientists confirmed at the NASA press conference that the currentOpportunity and Spirit missions have no instruments to look for organicsubstances. But exploration for evidence of organic life forms is planned for the2009 Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Why can't the current rover missions doboth inorganic and organic searches?

The equipment package, the payload, that is on these particularspacecraft, is designed to test for minerals and to look for textures in rocks thatare consistent with the presence of water as a first step.Once you have evidence of that, then you can design a new spacecraft whichwill very specifically be focused on the organics question. So, the process is"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"similar to learning to walk before you can run.IS THERE A LIMITATION IN THE ENGINEERING AND THE SIZE OFWHAT CAN GO ON ROVERS THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISIONABOUT GOING ORGANICS VERSUS INORGANICS ONE WAY OR THEOTHER?Yes, given the budget constraints, you have to make pragmatic decisions aboutwhat you are going to put on the payload and if you put one thing on thepayload that does something very specific, then you are going to have to takesomething else off the payload that also does something very specific. So, in thiscase, if you equip the payload to look for organics, you might get to Mars and loand behold! you chose the wrong place. You don't get any positive tests fororganics and you have never answered the question about whether or not thiswas the best place to do this.\"More Information:NASA Updates:Spirit Rover as of March 4, 2004Spirit completed its observations at \"Middle Ground\" on its 60th martian sol,ending at 9:11 p.m., PST on March 4. Waking up to \"Pictures to Prove It,\" by theMighty Mighty Bosstones, Spirit finished gathering data from the rock abrasiontool hole on \"Humphrey\" with the alpha particle X-ray spectrometer and themicroscopic imager.The panoramic camera then continued to acquire more images for the360-degree view from the current rover position at \"Middle Ground.\"After backing up 0.85 meters (about 2.8 feet), the miniature thermal emissionspectrometer and panoramic camera had their turn to collect data and imagesfrom both of the rock abrasion tool's latest efforts on \"Humphrey\" - the triple-brushed area and the depression.As of this sol, Spirit has traveled 195.24 meters (about 641 feet).Plans for next sol include backing up and turning to avoid \"Ingrid,\" a20-centimeter (about 8 inches) rock to the west of \"Humphrey,\" and then drivingapproximately 25 meters (82 feet) toward \"Bonneville\" in the northeast. Spiritwill also snap the final images that will make up the 360-degree panorama of\"Middle Ground.\"Opportunity Rover as of March 4, 2004On sol 39, which ends at 8:52 a.m. PST on Thursday, March 4, Opportunityawoke to \"Bad Moon Rising\" by Creedence Clearwater Revival in honor of theeclipse caused by the martian moon Deimos.The science and engineering team built a whopping 490 commands toaccomplish the most complex robotic arm operations on Mars yet. Opportunitytook three mosaics on the area dubbed \"Last Chance,\" using the microscopicimager, creating 128 images in over 200 arm moves. Each \"frame\" of thesemosaics required multiple microscopic images. There are two reasons for this.First, the microscopic imager does not have auto-focus, so the team needed tohave Opportunity take and return multiple images at each location at differentdistances from the rock to get at least one in focus. A second reason is that theteam needed Opportunity to take an extra image at a slightly different angle foreach frame to create the right conditions to build stereo and computer-generatedgraphics of the \"topography\" of the rock area up close.After about two-and-a-half hours of microscopic imager maneuvers, the roboticarm placed the MÃ¶ssbauer spectrometer on a location at \"Last Chance\" called"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"\"Makar.\" Opportunity also used the panoramic camera to watch the rare solarcrossing of the sun by the moon Diemos and took images of the sky incoordination with the European Space Agency's orbiter at Mars, Mars Express.The plan for sol 40, which will end at 9:32 a.m. PST on Friday, March 5 is tocontinue taking microscopic images of the \"Last Chance\" area, then drive to anew location dubbed \"The Dells.\"NASA is taking some very detailed images with all cameras to determinewhether these bedrocks were laid down in liquid water.We b s it e s :http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.htmlHalophilesMore Large Sulfur-Eating Bacteriahttp://www.esa.int/export/esaCP/index.htmlhttp://athena.cornell.eduCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
