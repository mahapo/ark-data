Dust and gas stream into space, leaving a trail millions of miles long.\"Composite image courtesy JPL Stardust and University of Washington. June 25, 2004 Seattle, Washington - The June 18th issue of the journal Sciencefeatured on its cover a comet called \"Wild 2.\" (Pronounced Vilt Two) This comet firstshowed up in human telescopes in 1974 when its orbit changed from far out at the edge ofthe solar system to one bobbing around the sun between Mars and Jupiter. Since 1974,Wild 2 has been coming around every six years and NASA and the Jet Propulsion Lab inPasadena decided it might be a good comet to fly by and sample dust coming off its surfacein a search for not only the primordial elements that made our solar system, but for evenolder \"stardust\" residues from the bigger universe.Comets are not well-understood, but are the icy, dusty residue from the formation of oursolar system 4.6 billion years ago. Surprisingly comets are the most common objects in thissolar system. There might be ten trillion of them orbiting in the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloudfar beyond Pluto. But frequently, some of those comets get perturbed by other cosmicbodies, change orbits and come hurtling into the solar system toward the sun and oftenback out beyond Pluto again. But there are comets that come into our solar system and getinto smaller orbits that swing them only out between Mars and Jupiter like Wild 2.Artist's depiction of the Stardust spacecraft nearing comet Wild 2with the aerogel collector open to collect comet dust.Illustration courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech.That's why the NASA/JPL spacecraft named \"Stardust\" was built and launched onFebruary 7, 1999, to rendezvous with Comet Wild 2 and collect dust blowing off of it on"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"three different passes. The first dust collection was in spring 2000 and the second was inthe fall of 2002. Then this year on January 2, 2004, Stardust flew by at 13,000 miles perhour within 147 miles (236 kilometers) of Comet Wild 2 for a third capture of thousands ofparticles. Stardust also sent close-up pictures back to Earth.Those images have shocked astronomers who expected to see a dirty-looking snowball,probably with a smooth surface. Instead, Comet Wild 2 has so many gas jets flaring offaround its surface that so far - other than the sun - Comet Wild 2 is now the most activeplanetary surface in our solar system.Until now, only two other comets had been seen close enough to see a few gas jets and theywere Comet Halley in 1986 and Comet Borelli in September 2001. But no one wasprepared to see literally several dozen jets all around Comet Wild 2 flaring gas. Theprincipal scientific investigator on the Stardust mission is Prof. Donald Brownlee, anastronomer at the University of Washington in Seattle. I talked with him this week about hisreaction to the first images of the astonishing comet.Halley's Comet on March 12, 1986, which has survived its solar system orbitsfor nearly 3,000 years, has a few gas jets.

I was like 40 to 50 feet away when I first saw thescreen with the crowd of people because we just couldn't believe it. We were expecting thecomet to look pretty much like an asteroid.We expected to see a relatively smooth and featureless surface, all dark, with nothingterribly interesting because when material gets blown off comets, some material gets blownoff into space, but you would also expect that bigger particles would be thrown up intospace above the comet and not have enough energy to escape and fall back. So we thoughtthe fall back material would pretty much sprinkle the surface and cover valleys anddepressions and we wouldn't be able to see the surface of the comet at all. \"Footprint\" SinkholesThis image compares comet Wild 2's deep \"footprint\" sinkholes and deep, angular craters toasteroid Ida's smoother surface at the same spatial scale. Most of the depressions on moons and asteroids,such as Ida, are classic bowl-shaped impact craters. Images courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech.Then when we saw that the first image was absolutely amazing we saw these two hugefeatures which are now called 'Left Foot' and 'Right Foot' because they look like footprints,even though they are a kilometer long. But they look like sinkholes. They have sort of flatbottoms and vertical walls and really astounding. And nothing like this had ever been seenbefore on any solar system body. Here we were seeing on this comet that's only 4.5kilometers across. It's just amazing!"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"This image shows comet Wild 2, which NASA's Stardust spacecraftflew by on Jan. 2, 2004. This image is the closest short exposure of the cometat 174 miles, 236 kilometers. Image Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech.WHAT WOULD CAUSE THE SINK HOLES?We don't know. We see features on the comet that are definitely impact craters, althoughthey are unusual impact craters of a type not seen on other bodies (in the solar system).Then there are other features that must be due purely to evaporation of ice. But we also seefeatures like the jets that are occurring right now.The craters craters don't happen very often on Earth and they don't happen very often oncomets. So Wild 2 must be very old. They are probably impact craters at the formation ofthe comet and probably dates back billions of years ago when the comet was orbiting theSun out by Pluto, out beyond the orbit of Neptune. Dozens of Gas Jets on Wild 2\"Other than the Sun, this is the most active planetary surface in our solarsystem.\"- Donald Brownlee, Ph.D., Principle Investigator, Comet Wild-2 Study NASA artist's depiction of a couple of the several dozen gas jetsemitting from comet Wild 2 as seen from NASA's Stardust spacecraft duringits flyby of the comet on Jan. 2, 2004. Graphic credit: NASA/JPL.The jets are occurring right now, so it is a real thrill to have information on solar systemprocesses that occurred over a range of billions of years from now to the very early historyof the solar system and also in two different places. One is close to the sun where we areand the other is out beyond the orbit of Neptune, out where Pluto is.WHAT WOULD MAKE ALL OF THESE JETS?The jets well, comets are composed of three kinds of materials:1) Fine grain dust which is composed of mineral-like powder;2) and very fine grain powdery organic material;3) and fine grain powdery ice.When they get to close to the sun where the inner planets are inside the orbit of Jupiter, thesolar heating makes the ice vaporize and the ice vapor which is mostly water vapor,expands in space at supersonic speeds through these jets.SO THE GAS JETS THEMSELVES ARE NOT SO UNEXPECTED, BUT THAT IT IS THEOVERALL VIEW OF SOMETHING ON A SURFACE OF A COMET THAT NO ONEHAD EVER EXPECTED BEFORE?Yes, we expected to see jets or hoped to see jets. But we expected to see one or two jets,not dozens of jets. So, much of the surface of this comet is active."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Tall, Unexpected PinnaclesOne of the biggest surprises was that many people imagined comets would be a rubble pile,just a collection of gravel and sand type material without any interesting surface properties.When you have a material like that and have craters on it, they just look like craters whereyou dropped a rock in the sand, just little conical depressions. What we saw though, we seean unbelievably rugged surface with not just craters like you would see at the beach bythrowing rocks in the sand, but we see craters and features with vertical walls along theside. In some cases, even over-hanging walls! So, even though the gravity at the comet isvery slight it's microgravity conditions nonetheless the material the comet is made out ofhas a fair amount of strength. So, it cannot be a loose powdery rubble material. It has tohave intrinsic strength.Comet Wild 2 has many strange pinnacles, some over 100 meters (over 300 feet) high. Pinnacles are found onEarth,but have not previously been seen on other solar system bodies. Images courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech.The top and bottom image s are stereo pairs of images taken just after and just before closest approachto comet Wild 2 on January 2, 2004. The sunlit to shadow regions show the remarkably ruggednature of Wild 2's surface. Images courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech. Is Comet Wild 2 Like \"Astronaut Ice-Cream?\"One of the analogies I have been using is that it's probably somewhat like the structuralproperties of astronaut ice-cream. It's freeze-dried ice-cream. It's ice-cream that's beenfrozen and then put in a vacuum so the ice/water would vaporize and go off leaving thesolids behind. It's a very lightweight foamy material. It's brittle. You can break it and itbreaks in half and you can crumble it in your fingers. So I envision the comet, even thoughit's not made out of ice-cream it has physical properties somewhat similar to astronaut"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"freeze-dried ice-cream in that the icy surface has been lost to space and it leaves this sortof fragile micro-porous material which, even though it might be fragile and can crumble inyour fingers, it's still strong enough to support cliffs that are hundreds of meters high in thismicro-gravity environment. That makes this a very spectacular place. We also sawpinnacles columns of rocks sticking upwards up to 100 meters high which is reallyunexpected.DO YOU THINK THOSE 100 METER HIGH PINNACLES AND TOWER-LIKESTRUCTURES WOULD ACTUALLY BE THIS FROZEN ASTRONAUT ICE-CREAMAND THAT THIS WOULD BE LIKE A MERINGUE ON A PIE THAT CAN HOLDPEAKS?Yes. If you took meringue and froze it, that would probably be a pretty good analogy. Ifyou were there and kicked it with your foot, you could probably push your foot into thismaterial. But it would not just powder. In that regard, it's dramatically different from thesurface of our moon which is just a powder or even different than the surface of asteroidsor even the moons of the other planets.TOTALLY UNIQUE IN A WAY?Yes. And it's because of its unique history. It formed out beyond Pluto. It formed from iceand other dusty materials and over time at least on the surface the ice has been lost, but notby forming oceans or soaking the surface, but been lost by vaporizing off into space, prettymuch like making freeze-dried ice cream. Comet Wild 2 - As Old As the 4.6 Billion-Year-Old Solar SystemHOW OLD DO YOU THINK COMET WILD 2 IS?We're pretty sure that it's the same age of everything else in the solar system which is about4.6 billion years old. However, an interesting thing about comets is that they formed at thevery edge of the solar system. They formed out near and beyond Pluto. conditions werevery cold out there and very far from the sun. Many people believe that the majorcomponents that were used to make comets 4.6 billion years ago were stardust interstellargrains that formed around other stars and are actually older than the sun and planets.That's one of the reasons our mission is called 'Stardust.' We are going out to grab stardust things that are older than the solar system and formed by other stars BUT which are theactual building blocks of comets and the comets are actually building blocks of planets andus. So, we are truly seeking to find the initial building blocks of the solar system.One of the goals ultimately is to understand where the Earth's oceans came from and wherethe Earth's original organic material came from? When life was first formed on Earth, it hadto form from organic materials. Where did those organic materials come from?Intrinsically, the Earth forming so close to the sun in what's called a 'habitable zone' of thesun formed in a region that is pretty much devoid of water that could condense and get onthe Earth. It was also devoid of organic material. So, many people believe that most of theearly organic materials on Earth and most of the water came from more distant places inthe solar system. They came from things like asteroids and comets. Getting Stardust Samples Back To Earth on January 15, 2006HOW DO YOU GET THIS DUST FROM THE COMET THAT'S BEEN COLLECTEDBACK TO EARTH?\"Ice tray\" of light-as-air aerogel stardust collector that was mounted on Stardust spacecraft"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"to collect Wild 2's comet dust. Photograph courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech.The samples are collected in an aerogel which is a very low-density silicon material. Itlooked like glass, but you can poke your finger in it. It's a glass-like material, but it's only alittle bit denser than air. It's really quite an exotic gel. It's a good collector of high speedparticles.So, we expose it in a collector that looks kind of like a large tennis racket filled full ofaerogel. The aerogel is in the form of things that look just like ice cubes about the size of anice cube. The particles embed themselves in the ice cube and we fold it up and it's on theway home.BUT HOW DO YOU GET IT FROM OUT IN SPACE WHERE IT FLEW BY THECOMET BACK TO EARTH TO YOUR LAB?Careful planning. It's on a trajectory. When I say it's coming back, it is coming back, butright now it's going away. It's going away from Earth and at the end of summer in August toSeptember, it will turn around and start falling back to Earth. On January 15, it will collidewith the Earth.IN 2006.January 15, 2006, it will re-enter the atmosphere and land in Utah near Salt Lake City.THAT WILL BE IN THE FORM OF A SATELLITE THAT IS BROUGHT DOWN?It's a capsule, something akin to an Apollo capsule. It looks like an Apollo capsule. Itcomes in, a parachute pops out at 12,000 feet and it parachutes to the ground.WHO IS CONTROLLING THE DESCENT OF THE SPACECRAFT THAT IS GOING TODROP THIS CAPSULE?There is no control (of the capsule. JPL controls small jets on Stardust spacecraft). Werelease this from the spacecraft and it's spun up in the release process. So we aim it veryprecisely from the spacecraft and it's pushed off by springs. It's also spun. Once it'sreleased, it has zero control. (The capsule with stardust samples) doesn't need any control.\"After capsule containing aerogel samples is spun out from Stardustspacecraft as it is guided by NASA/JPL engineers toward Earth, the capsule will dropuntil 12,000 feet when a parachute opens. Its expected landing spot is in a remote area outsideSalt Lake City, Utah, on January 15, 2006.

The most common bodies in the solar system are comets. There are over atrillion comets in the solar system and most of the chunks - or things that formed when thesolar system was young - were bodies that had ice in them.YOU LITERALLY MEAN THERE ARE OVER A TRILLION COMETS?Absolutely! Actually there are about 10 trillion comets. But see, comets the way theysurvive they spend almost all of their lives great distances from the sun. When we see acomet like Wild 2, it's in a region where it's unstable. It can only survive in that part of thesolar system for about 10,000 years or so before it's destroyed by solar heating andinteraction the planets. So, these things are only stable for long periods of time far from thesun. Why Don't More Comets Hit Earth?Comet Wild 2 is now on the other side of the sun about 3 astronomical units from Earth.That means it takes light and radio signals at least a half hour to reach Earth. The comet isheading away from the sun and will more than half way to Jupiter before it starts fallingback toward Earth for the \"Stardust\" drop of the aerogel collector 18 months from now onJanuary 15, 2006.Calculating orbits so precisely is the science of orbital mechanics. One of the biggestgravity affecters in our solar system is Jupiter which is 300 times more massive than Earth.Scientists know that comets and asteroids in the past have hit our planet and causedextinction events such as the wipe out of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.Since there might be 10 trillion comets orbiting the edge of our solar system and new onesare detected coming into our inner solar system nearly every day why don't more hit theEarth more often? The answer is massive Jupiter and the protective role it plays inattracting so many cosmic bodies to it.Don Brownlee, Ph.D.: \"One prediction has been that if Jupiter was not there, that theimpact would be that the number of comets and asteroid-like bodies could have been10,000 times higher which is amazing because the object that killed the dinosaurs was onlytwice as big as Comet Wild 2. Those are calculated to hit the Earth on the average of aboutevery 100 million years. So, if Jupiter was not there and the flux was 10,000 times higher,every 10,000 years we would be hit by a dinosaur-killing asteroid or comet.Which means between the time the ice melted here in the northwest and now, we wouldhave all been done in by another the thing that killed the dinosaurs was about a10-kilometer sized comet or asteroid.AND WILD 2 IS ABOUT 5 KILOMETERS.Yes, it's about half the size, but in terms of mass, it's about a factor of 10.AND THE LAST BIG HIT WAS ABOUT 65 MILLION YEARS AGO WITH THE WIPEOUT OF THE DINOSAURS. AND WITHOUT JUPITER, THIS COULD HAVEHAPPENED EVERY 10,000 YEARS?That's a prediction. If Jupiter were not there, the impact rate would have been much higher.Which means that the evolution of life on Earth would have been quite different.\"More Information:As Dr. Brownlee said, one of the questions that Project Stardust is trying to answerconcerns the source of all the water on Earth. However he pointed out to me that ouroceans, seas and rivers are only 1/10th of 1 percent of the Earth. We have analyzed somemeteorites that have come in from outer space that have 10% water content locked up incrystals. Comets might be 50% water that is frozen. Most of us would think that cometsrounding the sun eventually get close enough to melt. But the fact is that most comets arethrown back out of the solar system far beyond Pluto by the orbital mechanics of theplanets. Dr. Brownlee thinks that will most likely be the fate of Comet Wild 2 over the nextten thousand years.Prof. Brownlee also pointed out that as we wonder about the fate of comets getting tooclose to our sun, the Earth itself will be too close to the sun for surface life as we know it in"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"about another half billion years. As suns age, they become brighter and hotter. Right now at4.6 billion years old, our sun is 35% brighter than when it was very young and will continueto brighten about 10% every billion years on into the future. That's why there is anastronomical prediction that the Earth will not be habitable for plants and animals in about500 million years.Could the sun's brightening and heating up be the cause of current global warming? Prof.Brownlee says no, that current global warming is a serious issue. But over long enoughtime, the heating of the sun will end up eliminating most of the carbon dioxide in theEarth's atmosphere, thus destroying all plant life and subsequently animal life. In fact, asthe sun brightens and heats up eventually Earth will resemble Venus.The fate of Earth and our solar system is the subject of a book that Dr. Brownlee co-wrotewith one of his astronomer colleagues, Peter Douglas Ward, entitled, The Life and Death ofPlanet Earth: How the New Science of Astrobiology Charts the Ultimate Fate of OurWo r l d , published by Times Books in 2003.http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805067817/qid=1088096395/sr=ka-1/ref=pd_kaWebsite:http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/photo/cometwild2.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
