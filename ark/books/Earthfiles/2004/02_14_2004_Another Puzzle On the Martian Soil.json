The lower arrow points at a filamentthat bends.For size context, each of the pebbly grains below the larger round spherule and other rocksis about100 to 200 microns in diameter, about the size of a sugar grain. So the two long,unidentifiedfilaments laying on the little soil grains are about 1 to 2 microns in diameter.Source of image: Opportunity Microscopic Imager Non-linearizedFull frame EDRacquired on Sol 19 (February 12, 2004) of Opportunity's mission to Meridiani Planum atapproximately at approximately 11:25:52 Mars local solar time, Microscopic Imagerdust cover commanded to be OPEN.

February 14, 2004 Tempe, Arizona - The NASA/JPL rover calledOpportunity has been rolling along the light-colored bedrock in the MeridianiPlanum taking spectrometer measurements of the rocks and stopping here andthere to examine closely the soil through its microscopic imager (MI). On Thursday, February 12, the microscope image was taken and is amongimages at: http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/all/opportunity_m019.html Clickon photos for full views. Paul Anderson, Director of the Canadian Crop Circle Research Network(CCCRN) in Vancouver, B. C., Canada, has been studying Opportunity andSpirit raw images as they are released at the NASA Mars Exploration RoverMission website. Yesterday he sent me the e-mail below with text he hadsuperimposed on the microscopic image questioning what the hair-like filamentis. 02/13/04\" Hi Linda,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I was looking at the newest micro images posted from Opportunity(yesterday, Sol 19), and noticed something similar to a long thin hair-like\"filament\" apparently lying on the soil next to one of the larger spherules.I've attached two zoomed crops from this (one as is, and one with text).The original (one of several, but about the clearest one) is here blown upat:http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/all/1/m/019/1M129869847EFF0338P2953M2M1.JPG It seems to have a sharp downward bend towards the left end and maybeanother \"hook-like\" bend at the end of that (but fainter so moresubjective). Must be very tiny and thin if the larger spherules are about 2-4mm in size or so.Not sure what the explanation may be - dust from the rover? Volcanic ash?Biology? Another day, another puzzle...Paul\" Text superimposed on NASA/JPL microscopic imageby Paul Anderson, Director, CCCRN, for clarity. I e-mailed the images to Prof. Ronald Greeley, Ph.D., Regents Prof. of Geologyat Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona. Dr. Greeley is also one of theseven lead Chairs of the Science Operations Working Group for the MarsExploration Rover Mission. While he looked at the images on his computer, I interviewed him by phoneabout the puzzling filament and Martian geology questions.Interview:Ronald Greeley, Ph.D., Regents Prof. of Geology, Arizona State University,and a Lead Chair, Science Operations Working Group (SOWG), MarsExploration Rover Mission, Tempe, Arizona:\"WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT HAIR-LIKE THING IS?Yep, it's a hair-like thing, all right! It's a puzzle. At the Spirit site in some of thefirst microscopic images, we had seen things that looked like they were tiny sodastraw holes. This (filament) would be potentially somewhat similar to those, butfiner in diameter. And some of the folks on the team feel those holes could bethe result of groundwater, water that is working its way up from the subsurfaceto the surface, or from the surface working down not necessarily today, butsometime in the Martian past. In the process of percolating, it could form thesesoda straw-like structures. (NASA \"soda straw\" images not currently found attime of this report.)"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Now, the filament that is visible in this latest Opportunity image, though, issmaller than that. There are fibrous things that can form in minerals likeasbestos. I'm not saying this is asbestos, but like asbestos, that are common withsome minerals. So that would be a possibility, too.WHERE WERE THE 'SODA STRAW' IMAGES?Those were in the first IM image that was taken by Spirit as soon as we came offthe lander and the rover's arm went down on the soil. They are very subtlethings small, dark rings. People think it's the end of the soda straw being lookedat and then they look at other areas where it's linear, as if you cut the strawlengthwise.HOW WOULD THEY FORM AS PERCOLATION OF WATER?If you took a bucket of sand and you sprinkled water on it, the water would tendto find its way among the individual grains of sand. In the process of percolatingdownward, being pulled down by gravity, it would sort of concentrate alongcertain pathways among the grains. Now, if the water had material dissolved in itlike salt, then as the water percolates down through the sand along those littlechannel ways, some of that salt would be precipitated along the walls of thechannel way and leave behind a tube. So, it's that idea people have in mind.IS THERE ANY REASON IT WOULD BE CIRCULAR?If you look at water, water tends to form little droplets by surface tension andtends to be round. If you think of that working its way down through the sand, itmight also tend to be round. Electrostatic String of Martian Dust?Now, there is a third possibility and that is the smallest things we can see inthese MI images is about 100 microns in diameter. The actual pixel size is about30 microns, but to identify something it has to be bigger it has to take severalpixels. And so when we look at the picture such as you sent me, the fine grainmaterial not the round spherule but the fine grain material is about 100 to 200microns in diameter. That's about like sugar. If you think of sugar which you putin coffee, that's about the size of those grains that you are looking at there.Now, the filament the dust on Mars is much smaller than that. It's a few micronsin diameter and that means each dust particle is about 1/100th the size of theindividual rock grains that we can see in this MI image. If you took a bunch ofdust grains and strung them together and bonded them with electrostatics, thenit's conceivable that you could get this kind of filament. You wouldn't see theindividual dust grains, but they would all be hooked together with electrostaticcharging. So, that's one possibility besides this soda straw mechanism that Imentioned earlier.LET ME MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND. THE FILAMENT COULDBE MADE OUT A WHOLE SERIES OF DUST GRAINS STUCK TOGETHERBY ELECTROSTATIC FORCES?Yes. That's one idea anyway.SO RIGHT NOW, THIS FILAMENT IS VERY INTERESTING AND ITWOULD BE HARD TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS?That's right. Indeed.BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS INTERESTED IN WHETHER THERE ISENOUGH MOISTURE OR WATER ON MARS THAT THERE COULD BELIFE, MAYBE LIKE AN ALGAE OR OTHER, IS THERE ANY WAY OFFINDING OUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS FILAMENT COULD BEORGANIC?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"That's a good question. I think you would need to talk with one of our astro-biologists on the team such as Jack Farmer or Andy Knoll.\"I e-mailed both of those exo-biologists and received the reply below fromProfessor Andy Knoll, Harvard University.02/13/04\"Dear Linda, I don't know exactly what caused the feature you espied in the MI image. Ilooked back at earlier images and saw faint linearities in one or two ofthem. All share a particular feature, which is that you can see underlyinggrains through the linear feature. This makes me suspect that the feature issome kind of defect in the frame rather than a hair on Mars. KenHerkenhoff, who built the MI, could tell you more about this possibility.The obvious test of such a hypothesis is: will we see more of these? For now, I'm skeptical of the idea that this structure (I couldn't discern thesecond candidate in your file, superimposed text) is an indigenous piece ofMars, although thin hair-like features can form during basaltic volcanism --the most famous example is Pele's hair, seen around Mauna Loa in Hawaii.I'll keep my eyes open. Sincerely,Andy Knoll\"What Are Spirit and Opportunity Doing Now?Professor Greeley:Spirit\"The past two days for Spirit were spent driving towards a feature that is called\"Stone Council\" on the way toward the Bonneville crater. We need to look atthose rocks up close and see if they are of interest or not. There is a very strongmotivation to get to Bonneville crater. And so I think we are going to see somediscussion on whether we want to stop and do extended science observations orjust move straight on to Bonneville.WHY THE NAME 'STONE COUNCIL?'Oh, it's just a ring of rocks that looks like a campfire if you were out in thewoods and making a fire ring.OpportunityAt Opportunity, the focus has been on getting the trenching operationunderway, as well as doing some of these touch-and-go investigations. I don'tthink there have been any updates on the analytical data.SO THIS MICROSCOPIC IMAGE THAT HAS THE FILAMENT IN ITWOULD HAVE BEEN UP THERE ALONG THE BEDROCK, RIGHT?Well, in that area. This is not from the bedrock itself, but from the soil in theforeground. Any Further Investigation of 2-Horned Mystery Object?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"\"2-horned\" mystery object in Opportunity PanoramicCamera image down below bedrock. Images by: NASA/JPL/Cornell.WHAT ABOUT THAT '2-HORNED' UNIDENTIFIED WHITE OBJECT DOWNBELOW THE OPPORTUNITY BEDROCK IN ONE OF THE PANORAMICCAMERA IMAGES? COULD THE ROVER ARM PICK UP THE2-PRONGED OBJECT TO FIND OUT WHAT IT IS?No, we can't do that. The arm can't lift weight.DO YOU KNOW IF THEY HAVE DONE ANYTHING WITH THE ROVER TOTRY TO GO TO THAT SPOT BELOW THE BEDROCK WHERE THAT ODD2-PRONGED OBJECT WAS?No. The plan for today was to do a trenching operation with the wheels. If thetrench is successful we are going to look at the stratigraphy in the soil and thatwould be our goal for seeing things like the composition of the crust and if thereis any structure in the soil itself. That will be contingent on whether the wall ofthe trench stands up or just slides and fills in. But there are no plans to look atthat feature that you are describing.I WONDER WHY NOT BECAUSE IT IS SO PECULIAR.There has not been a lot of discussion of that in the team, so I don't think mostof us feel that it amounts to anything.HOW CAN IT BE DISMISSED THOUGH. WHAT IF IT IS A PLANT?I don't want to bring it up, but it's like the Face on Mars.BUT THIS LOOKS SO 3-DIMENSIONAL WITH SHADOW ANDEVERYTHING.I don't know. 20% Sulfur/Sulfate Content in Meridiani Planum BedrockIN TERMS OF THE 20% CONTENT IN THE BEDROCK, WHAT WOULD BECOMPARABLE IN ROCKS HERE ON EARTH?Here, (the percentages are) much lower than that. But it depends on theenvironment we were talking about the other day. If this were an environmentwhere there were volcanic materials in place and if it were hot ash, the sulfurcontent at those levels (20%) would be expected.SO THE 20% IS CONSIDERED HIGH AND ASSOCIATED WITH VOLCANIC"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"PROCESSES?Not necessarily only with volcanism. That's one environment. There aresedimentary environments, too, where high sulfur contents exist.
