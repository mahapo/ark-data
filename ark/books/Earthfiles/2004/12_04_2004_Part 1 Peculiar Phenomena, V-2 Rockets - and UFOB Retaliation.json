My subjectwas: \"UFO Crash Retrievals U. S. Government Policy of Denial in the Interest of NationalSecurity.\" My focus was this statement:\"The 'peculiar phenomenon' object was defined as hostile in that it appeared to haveaffected the V-2 rocket's trajectory. It was by every definition an advanced foreignweapons system.

Andrew Kissner, former New Mexico State Rep., Las Cruces, Dona AnaCounty, about 1947 eventsFormer New Mexico State Representative Jon Andrew Kissner wrote that statement in anunpublished 1994 manuscript after years of his private interviews with employees at WhiteSands Proving Ground, the Naval Research Laboratory, the first Atomic EnergyCommission labs, former military officers, private defense contractors and Office of NavalResearch about aerial discs that crashed in the Roswell and White Sands region in 1947.Rep. Kissner also shared his information with former New Mexico Congressman SteveSchiff. In 1993, Congressman Schiff had asked the Government Accounting Office (GAO)to determine if the U.S. Air Force, or any other U.S. government agency, possessedinformation on the alleged crash and recovery of an extraterrestrial vehicle and its alienoccupants near Roswell, New Mexico in July 1947.Cong.

Eight months later, Congressman Schiff died on March 25, 1998 atage 51 after a long battle with skin cancer.After his death, The Washington Post and Associated Press wrote: \"Congressman Schiffgained headlines in 1993, reopening a federal investigation into the so-called RoswellIncident, in which extraterrestrial beings were purported to have crashed northwest ofRoswell, New Mexico, in 1947.

Further, the Air Force said any reported bodies could beexplained as wooden dummies or wounded or dead pilots in government research. All thatwas a new twist on the U. S. government's previous insistence for nearly half a century thatthe only thing that came down in July 1947 between Corona and Roswell was a weatherballoon. Even the main stream media did some research, reported that wooden dummiesweren't dropped out of balloons until the 1950s not 1947 and looked at the USAF'schanging explanations with a more suspicious eye.FBI Memo, July 8, 1947The GAO did receive a July 8, 1947, teletype message from the FBI in Dallas to FBIHeadquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio, and stated that \"an FBI spokesperson confirmed theauthenticity of the message.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"July 8, 1947, \"URGENT\" teletype message from the Dallas, Texas, FBI officeto Director of the FBI and SAC Headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio.Released by GAO to Cong.

The GAO could not identifywho destroyed the messages, or why.\" Schiff said the GAO thought the messages weredestroyed over forty years ago, making further inquiry about their destruction impractical.Schiff added, \"At least this effort caused the Air Force to acknowledge that the crashedvehicle was no weather balloon.

Andrew Kissner,former New Mexico State Representative from Las Cruces, Dona Ana County, New Mexico.In 1994, then New Mexico State Rep. J. Andrew Kissner from Las Cruces in Dona AnaCounty, sent me his unpublished book manuscript entitled, Peculiar Phenomenon EarlyUnited States Efforts to Collect and Analyze Flying Discs, based on his discussions withWhite Sands Proving Ground and Naval Research Lab employees.Andrew Kissner wrote: \"At 4:11 p.m., Mountain Standard Time, Thursday, May15, 1947, above the Tularosa Basin in south central New Mexico, the most highlyclassified episode in American military history began a series of events, decisionsand actions that ultimately resulted in the crash and recovery of at least two,probably three and possibly four, extraterrestrial 'flying discs.' This wasaccomplished by deliberate antiaircraft artillery fire and/or use of surface-to-airmissiles by units of the U. S. Army National Antiaircraft Artillery School at Ft. Bliss,Texas and/or U. S. Army Air Force fighters based at Alamogordo Army Air Field atAlamogordo, New Mexico. The well-publicized 'Roswell' (Corona), New Mexicoflying disc was one of these.Historical research suggests, however, something even more controversial than the'shoot downs.' The U. S. Army's actions either caused, or were a response to,offensive overt acts initiated by flying discs themselves. Even though unproved, itappears that flying discs might have been a contributing factor in the deaths of oversix hundred military personnel and civilians in 1947 over a two month period fromMay 9 to July 31. Whatever flying discs were, or are, they were not, and are not,defenseless. Their 'special weapons' were, and even now are, unconventional. Flyingdiscs were immediately defined by the U. S. military in 1947 as an 'enemy weaponssystem.'\"A T-Force assigned to secure flying disc crash sites and collect debris.\"[Editor's Note: David Devorkin described the T-Force in his 1992 book, Science With A"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Ve n g e a n c e as a \"specialized, often inter-service, U.

Military support was provided by the Air MaterialCommand and personnel stationed at the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project atSandia Base, Albuquerque. Further analytical effort was provided by the staffmembers of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism (DTM) at the CarnegieInstitution in Washington, D. C., and by Dr. Detlev Bronk, Chief, Division ofAviation Medicine, JRDB. Personnel selected from the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology (MIT), Brookhaven National Laboratory, the RAND Corporation, theNational Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA) and the RockefellerInstitute, appear to have played major roles in the months immediately following the1947 crashes.\"It also appears likely that custody of flying discs was permanently vested in civilianauthorities by classified Presidential Executive Order in July 1948. The relevantcivilian authority was the Atomic Energy Commission and its national laboratorieswith participation of the Department of Defense's Air Force Systems Command, theNaval Research Laboratory and the Research and Development Board (RDB) of theSecretary of Defense, established in late July 1947. The Research and DevelopmentBoard coordinated all scientific inquiry. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staffprovided military support. The National Security Council (NSC), newly formed inAugust 1947, served as overall program coordinator.\"It should be noted that within these major institutions, the investigations andretrieval operations of 'flying discs' were and are classified in 'compartments' that arevery small. It is not the entire institution that has knowledge. Rather it is onlyspecialized components within much larger complexes that have need-to-knowaccess about the non-human presence.\"The May 15, 1947, incident has remained a special access, compartmentalizedexperience for the past 57 years with few, even in the relevant contemporarygovernment, aware of how it all began.\"V-2 Rockets Mysteriously Veer Off Courseat White Sands Proving Ground"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"German Wasserfall rocket launched at White Sands Proving Ground (WSPG),New Mexico, after WWII. Photograph source: WSPG History.[ Editor's Note: According to the U. S. Naval Laboratory website, \"After World War II,parts of almost one hundred German V-2 rockets were brought to the United States. TheU.S. Army undertook the task of assembling the rockets at White Sands, New Mexico, forresearch and experimentation by government agencies and universities. In 1946, the NavalResearch Lab was invited to participate in the Army's V-2 rocket program. As anestablished group ready to carry out upper atmospheric research, the Laboratory becamethe prime agency for conducting research with the V-2 program and for developing thetechnology to carry out the missions. Eighty experiments were performed between 1946and 1951.\" ]The V-2 research program moved fairly quickly, with flights scheduled at the White SandsProving Ground, New Mexico. The first static engine test firing of a German V-2 on U.S.soil occurred on March 14, 1946. The missile used for this engine test became the firstGerman V-2 launched in the U.S. on April 16, 1946. The U.S. V-2 series of launchesconcluded in 1952. Some of the launches employed V-2 missiles equipped with scientificinstrumentation designed to study the upper atmosphere. These types of V-2 launcheswere managed by the V-2 Upper Atmosphere Research Panel, which was established inJanuary, 1947 and evolved into the Upper Atmosphere Rocket Research Panel in March,1948.In the history of the V-2 rocket program, an internet archive called EncyclopediaAstronautica states: \"1947 May 15 V-2 Flight Launched 16:04 local time.

Andrew Kissner says it was: \"A radartarget that instantaneously appeared next to the ascending V-2 missile\" and immediatelythe V-2 rocket changed course. Andrew Kissner says his White Sands military officersource saw a photograph of a flying disc taken from a camera aimed through a V-2 rocketwindow.What was the \"peculiar phenomena\" linked to? It was considered the cause for the V-2rocket at White Sands Proving Ground on May 15, 1947, to \"change course, taking anortheasterly track, one that brought the rocket crashing to earth two minutes later only sixmiles east and slightly north of the community of Alamogordo, New Mexico 40 degrees"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"off the V-2's projected flight path.\"New Mexico State Representative Andrew Kissner also wrote after his personal interviewwith the Army officer at White Sands Proving Ground:\"Whatever had mysteriously appeared and vanished after observing a V-2 in flight inclose proximity to the rocket, it apparently affected the rocket's trajectory. Thatevent became an immediate priority within a very small, closed circle of highlyranked general staff officers and civilian scientists assigned to the Joint Researchand Development Board (JRDB) of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) under whoseauthority weapons test ranges were established and operated and chaired by Dr.Va n n e v a r B u s h .\"The 'peculiar phenomenon' object was defined as hostile in that it appeared to haveaffected the V-2 rocket's trajectory. It was by every definition an advanced foreignweapons system. Effort would be expended to guard against further intrusions, andhigh priority was assigned to collect a specimen of the technology for furtheranalysis, covertly if possible.\"That phrase, \"High priority assigned to collect a specimen of the technology,\" meant thecreation of covert American government units to bring down the unidentified flying objectthat could pace ascending V-2 rockets and cause them to veer off course. Those retrievalunits operated under Projects Moon Dust and Pounce which were assigned security of airspace over White Sands Proving Ground. One of their classified missions was toaggressively bring down the advanced discs for study and potentially back-engineering.American Military Aggression Against Flying DiscsI was first exposed to the idea that the American government might have aggressively goneafter flying discs when I talked with UFO crash retrieval researcher and author, LeonardStringfield, in the early 1980s. He told me he had personal knowledge about U. S. AirForce orders to shoot down foreign aerial discs at the end of the 1940s. But, he said, \"welost so many of our own airplanes that the order was rescinded in the early 1950s.\"Example of 20 millimeter antiaircraft canons used in 1945.Did the United States deliberately use weapons to bring down one or more foreign discs? A'yes' answer to that question was related to Andy Kissner by a good friend who hadpreviously worked for the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL).Andrew Kissner: \"Back in the mid-1960s (while working at the NRL), he had beentaken to a facility somewhere in the state of New Mexico that was underground.There was a warehouse and a flying disc inside the warehouse, inside this bunker.He noted visually and was told verbally by the briefing officer that this was one ofseveral flying discs shot down at Roswell in 1947.\"What he observed and was told is that it was shot down with either 20 or 40millimeter canon fire and he observed on the flying disc penetrations of the skin andexit holes through the top of the flying disc. He was told it was the product of 20 or40 millimeter canon fire.\"According to history written by the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, \"In July1944, the Navy's Bureau of Ordnance requested Section T of the Office of ScientificResearch and Development (OSRD) to study anti-aircraft missiles to counteract theJapanese Ohka piloted bombs and other suicide weapons sent against the U. S. in thePacific. The requirement was for a missile to shoot down a plane at a range of 20,000yards at an altitude of 30,000 feet.\"Four months later by November 1944, the Navy's Bureau of Ordnance assigned theApplied Physics Laboratory of the Johns Hopkins University in Silver Spring, Maryland, toundertake the development of radar-guided surface-to-air missiles.

The morning of May29th, Lt. Col. Harold R. Turner, Commander of the White Sands Proving Ground, wasplanning a very secret V-2 rocket launch. But problems kept delaying lift-off.Andy Kissner wrote:\"At 7:15 p.m. MST, on May 29, 1947, it is believed that at least one Wasserfallsurface-to-air missile, complete with a 674-pound high explosive warhead, was firedat one or more radar targets hovering to the southwest of WSPG Launch Row. Atapproximately 7:20 p.m., at an altitude above 60,000 feet, the proximity fuse on thewarhead detonated ten miles north and slightly west of Mt. Franklin.\"The explosion, was witnessed by Major General John L. Homer, Commander of Ft.Bliss from 1946 to 1950. The El Paso Times reported the next day on May 30, 1947,that the first explosion occurred more than ten minutes before a second explosion atleast 25 miles further south. General Homer dispatched troops to look for missilewreckage and to investigate the first crash site ten to fifteen miles northwest of Ft.Bliss towards WSPG.\"The surface-to-air missile's mysterious target, possibly crippled by the explosion,continued to fly in airspace north of Ft. Bliss, eventually impacting within one mileof the new Buena Vista Airport only six miles south of downtown Juarez,Chihuahua, Mexico, at 7:32 p.m. Local residents described \"a blinding flash of light\"followed by a tremendous pressure wave and the appearance of a mushroom cloud.The concussion of the blast was sufficient to crack windows six miles north of thecrash site, while an electric clock stopped at the El Paso County Sheriff's Office,apparently due to the blast effect.\"Whatever the mysterious radar object had been was not apparent it was totallyvaporized by the explosion. Small shreds of 'burned, gray metal fused with moltensand and rock,' were found near a 50 feet by 50 feet by 24-feet-deep crater outsideJuarez, Mexico. There was no V-2 rocket body at the bottom of the crater hole noranything else. (The El Paso Times, May 30, 1947) It was never learned what thesecurity detail dispatched by General Homer found at the site of the first explosionon the west side of the Franklin Mountains east of Anthony, New Mexico twelveminutes before the explosion in Juarez, Mexico.\"An effective cover story was immediately provided to the press that another V-2launched from White Sands Proving Ground had gone astray, experienced a totalgyroscope failure, flew 180 degrees off course and crashed in Mexico.\"The entire Juarez Garrison's rocket recovery efforts resulted in a small pile ofdebris that fit on top of a desk. There was no explanation why the launched missilevaporized.\"That missile, according to Andrew Kissner, was actually a secret surface-to-air rocketattack on one or more unidentified radar targets.Another mysterious and important visual detail was provided by the editor of the LasCruces Sun-News who watched the May 29, 1947, launch and said there were two \"firstmagnitude stars\" near the missile before it headed down out of the daylight sky to crash.
