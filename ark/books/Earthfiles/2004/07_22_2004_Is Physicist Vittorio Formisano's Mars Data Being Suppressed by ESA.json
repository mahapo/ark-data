There is no way that formaldehyde can existand remain for a long time in the Martian atmosphere. If (formaldehyde) confirmed(in addition to the confirmed methane, possibly life on Mars today, yes.\"- Vittorio Formisano, Ph.D., Physicist , May 6, 2004 July 22, 2004 - Today I was scheduled to interview physicist Vittorio Formisano at theCOSPAR (Committee On Space Research) meeting in Paris where he was scheduled tohold a press conference to announce the final results of his Planetary Fourier Spectrometermounted on the European Space Agency's (ESA) Mars Express Orbiter.Vittorio Formisano,Ph.D., is the Principal Investigator of the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer (PFS) which hebuilt and designed to detect methane and other gaseous molecules. Dr. Formisano is basedat the Institute of Physics and Interplanetary Science in Rome, Italy, and has beencommuting to ESA offices in Darmstadt, Germany, to gather more data from the PlanetaryFourier Spectrometer in hopes that he can confirm the location of one or more sources ofthe Martian methane, as well as molecular indications of formaldehyde, benzene andammonia. The presence of those molecules in the Martian atmosphere, would most likelymean a life process of some kind, he told me in my previous May 6, 2004, interview withhim while he was working in his Rome office. See: 05-06-04 Earthfiles.The Planetary Fourier Spectrometer (PFS) mounted on the Mars Expressspacecraft in orbit around Mars has already confirmed a surprisingly large amount of methanein the Martian atmosphere. See 03-31-04 Earthfiles. If molecules of formaldehyde, benzeneand ammonia are also confirmed, it would probably mean biological life processes areat work on Mars. See 05-06-04 Earthfiles. ESA 2001 Illustration by Medialab.This morning, the cell phone number he gave me to call him has only a recorded message inItalian and his office number in Rome is not being answered at all. Then I learned that hisoriginally scheduled press conference at the Paris COSPAR meeting today has allegedlybeen canceled by ESA's Guido De Marchi, an astronomer who also works as aHolland-based press officer for ESA. According to Britain's Globe and Mail.com this week:\"David Whitehouse, the science editor for the online version of the Britishbroadcaster BBC, wrote an article headlined 'Ammonia on Mars could mean life'(distributed by internet) on Thursday, July 15, 2004. In it he described as yetunreported readings taken by an instrument aboard ESA's Mars Express spacecraft, acraft which has been orbiting the red planet since December. \"Mr. Whitehouse said the spectrometer had tentatively detected ammonia, a gaswhich would only survive in the thin Martian atmosphere for a few hours. He furtherwrote that there were only two possible sources for the ammonia - active volcanoesor microbes - and no Martian volcanoes have ever been seen. \"The piece then quoted an unnamed NASA scientist saying both that 'ammonia couldbe the key to finding life on Mars' and 'there are no known ways for ammonia to bepresent in the Martian atmosphere that do not involve life.'The BBC article further said that Vittorio Formisano, the lead scientist for the MarsExplorer instrument which supposedly found the ammonia, would present his"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"findings at a conference in Paris this week. Now finding any sign of anything life-like on Mars is to space science what a cure forcancer is in medical research. Not only is the discovery big news unto itself, it wouldalso loose billions and billions of dollars of future research funding. Accordingly,hundreds of journalists began telephoning ESA for more information and werereferred to Guido De Marchi, an astronomer who also works as a Holland-basedpress officer for ESA. His corporate-approved response to the BBC report of microbe-produced ammoniawas six degrees north of damning and 12 kilometres beyond dismissive. 'It is not true;it is a hoax. The instrument aboard the Mars Express has not looked for ammonia;ammonia has not been found, and the principal investigator for the instrument willnot talk about it at a conference to be held in Paris next week.'\" When Dr. Formisano and I set today for my phone interview with him at the COSPARConference in Paris, he told me the original molecular data was firm from his point of viewand he expected to announce that an organic source on Mars is producing the gases,probably from an underground source. By now, it was expected that Explorer's deep earth-penetrating radar would have been functioning in an exploration for underground water iceor even liquid water that might have helped pinpoint possible underground sites whereorganic processes could exist in conjunction with H2O. But the deployment of the radarhas been delayed until this fall. Now, has a major European physicist been silenced simply because he might be the firstscientist on Earth with hard evidence of a life process beyond Earth? If so, is thesuppression linked to an unstated political pecking order in the American and Europeanbureaucracies? Who would control the suppression beyond astronomer Guido De Marchi inAmsterdam?Websites:ttp://www.esa.int/export/SPECIALS/Mars_Express/http://www.esa.int/export/esaCP/index.htmlhttp://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Dec96/LifeUnderground.htmlhttp://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.htmlhttp://athena.cornell.eduCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
