S.: \"The second incident was about seven years ago (1992). I knew a woman inAtlanta, Texas, named Brenda. She was about two or three years older than me. She was aregistered nurse (R. N.). I met her through a metaphysical class. She was very much intoholistic healing. She was very much into UFOs. B talked about them quite freely. She saidshe could command them, as far as her choice of words she said she could communicatewith them when she desired to. Usually it was between 3 and 4 a.m. She could go to oneparticular window of her house and they would communicate with her, she said. We talkedabout that quite a bit.But she was also an R. N., she was extremely articulate, well-educated woman. In fact, asI told Jim Marrs, if I could point out any thing bad about Brenda, I could not. She was inevery way to my knowledge a person of truthfulness, of great compassion, and I found herto be a delightful companion in every way. We got very close. She was not married at thetime, but I had married James. She was an R.N. for the older folks, for the home servicepeople who go around and take care of the elderly. She was very well-liked. She was quitean attractive lady. Sometimes we would meet and have lunch.I was very curious about UFOs at this particular time in my life. She was very free andeasy with her remarks. She did not apparently try to hide anything. She simply stated whatshe considered facts and if you believed it, fine. If you did not, it was still fine. She was avery soft-spoken woman, blond hair, about 5 ' 6\", a very attractive lady. Her husband haddied about three to four years before I met her. He died of a heart attack - he was an olderman. She had no children, ever. She was just a very fine lady. I respected and admired herin every way.One day I was working in the yard and she stopped by and said, 'R, I am so tired. Due to acouple of ladies being off, I've worked three weeks without a day off.' She said the nexttwo days she was off and she said, 'I'm totally exhausted. It's even hard to go out to eat.'I said, 'Brenda, I've got to put supper on the table in about a half hour. Why don't you gotake care of your client and come back here for supper? Then when you go home, you'refree.'She said, 'Oh, that sounds wonderful! I would love it.' She came back. My husband wasthere. She was talking about how tired she was, that when she left the house she was goingto go home and take a bath for at least a day and a half and for the rest of the time she wasgoing to spend in bed. Change from Human to ReptileWe were having Mexican food. We went to the den with our meals. Brenda and I bothtook a goblet of tea. James took coffee. We were sitting there. We were having just a goodconversation about this particular elderly lady making a funny, cute remark. And all of asudden, there sitting on my couch was this reptilian person. I was so shocked that Ijumped, yelled, and spilled my plate of food and goblet of tea on the floor.My husband turned and said, 'What was that about?' I could not actually tell James at thattime. It took me about three days to relate what I saw.GO BACK A SECOND, SO I'M VERY CLEAR. THE THREE OF YOU ARE SITTING"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"IN THE LIVING ROOM.In the den.YOU HAVE YOUR FOOD AND DRINK. TELL ME THE FIRST MICROSECOND OFTHINGS NOT BEING NORMAL. WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED?Brenda made the statement, 'R, I am not just tired. I am absolutely gut-tired to the bone. Iam so tired I've changed my mind about the bath. I think I'm going to go home and go tobed.' I looked up because it was kind of a cute remark the way she had said it and thereshe was.ARE YOU LOOKING AT BRENDA?Yes. She was on the couch. I was in one of the recliners.BUT ARE YOU SAYING THAT BRENDA IS NOT SITTING THERE, BUT AREPTILIAN IS IN HER PLACE? OR ARE YOU SAYING THAT A REPTILIAN ISSITTING NEXT TO BRENDA?No, Brenda turned into the reptilian. Absolutely, irrevocably, exactly what I'm telling you.DID IT RESEMBLE WHAT YOU SAW WITH THE STANDING UP ALLIGATORWHEN YOU WERE IN THE PENTAGRAM? Description of Brenda As ReptileNo, not exactly. Brenda's eyes were yellow, kind of a yellow-green with the pupil going upand down (vertical, not round). But they were not red at all. Her skin was a yellow-green,but her nose or snout was not long. It was rather short and triangular, not long at all likethe alligator look that I first saw and told you about.SO, YOU WERE LOOKING AT YOUR FOOD WHEN YOU HEARD BRENDA SAYSHE WAS GOING TO GO HOME AND YOU LOOKED UP TO RESPOND TO HER.And that's when it occurred.BUT DID YOU SEE THE CHANGE OCCUR FROM HUMAN TO REPTILE?No, it was a done deal when I saw it.SO YOU LOOK UP AND WHAT EXACTLY IS OCCURRING BETWEEN YOUR EYESAND THE EYES OF BRENda AS THIS REPTILIAN?It was like somebody snatched Brenda away and the reptilian was in its place. And yet, Iknew that what I was looking at was Brenda. In fact, we had talked about reptilians at onetime. She had asked me if I thought reptilians were all bad. I told her I wouldn't assumethat anything was all bad or all good. I assumed making remarks like, 'It's like people.Good people, bad people.' I would assume any race of alien would have the same choiceor factions.DID BRENDA MAKE ANY REACTION TO YOU AS A HAND RAISE? OR WASTHERE ANY SURPRISE IN HER FACE? LIKE 'I NOW SEE THAT YOU KNOW I'M AREPTILIAN, BUT YOUR HUSBAND IS SITTING THERE.' WAS THERE ANYINDICATION FROM THE REPTILIAN THAT THE REPTILIAN KNEW THAT YOUWERE NOW SEEING A REPTILIAN BODY INSTEAD OF BRENDA'S HUMANBODY?Only in her action of immediately running out of the house.WALK ME THROUGH THAT MICROSCOPICALLY. YOU'RE SAYING YOURHUSBAND IS EATING AND IS NOT AWARE AT ALL.No, he was not. He never saw Brenda in her transformation at all.YOU ARE LOOKING AT HER. DO YOU REMEMBER IN THOSE MICROSECONDSIN LOOKING AT HER, DID YOU SAY ANYTHING? DID YOU SAY, 'BRENDA!'WHAT HAPPENED? YOU'RE LOOKING YOU MUST HAVE HAD SURPRISE.I certainly am sure I did, but the only thing I remember is dropping of the food. I droppedmy plate and the goblet (of tea). The minute it dropped and hit the floor, I was still staringat her. Immediately she got up and run out of the house."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"DID SHE SAY ANYTHING?To my knowledge and I don't know if James said she did or if I remember it I honestlydon't know that. She said something like, 'I've got to go.'AS YOU DROPPED THE FOOD, CAN YOU HEAR THE SOUND OF THE PLATEHITTING THE FLOOR?Oh, yes.DO YOU SEE ANY REACTION ON THE REPTILIAN AT THE SOUND OF THEGOBLET AND PLATE HITTING THE FLOOR?If I do, I don't remember. The only thing I remember thinking, 'This is connected somehowto the first incident (in the library and later the alligator and pentagram).' That hit my mind.If there was anything else, no ma'am, I don't remember it at this particular time, no.SO, THE REPTILIAN DID NOT FLINCH, MOVE, HEAD NOD, EYES BLINK,NOTHING?There was absolutely no blinking of the eyes. That I remember. It had the look. It was justthere.IN THE NEXT MICROSECONDS, HOW DOES IT/SHE GET UP?How does she get up? Linda, if she got up any extraordinary way, I don't remember. Ithappened so quick it was simply when she moved to the door, she was Brenda again. Nolonger reptilian.WAS YOUR HUSBAND LOOKING THEN?Yes, ma'am.DID YOU SEE ANY TRANSFORMATION OR FLICKER OR ANYTHING BETWEENTHE REPTILIAN BACK TO BRENDA?(pause) You know, Linda, I want to say, yes. I noticed something about the head and thechest. But I honestly can't tell you. But there has been something eating at my mind foryears, but I can't tell you honestly because I don't know.THINK ABOUT IT NOW IN YOUR MIND'S EYE. YOU KNOW WHAT HOLOGRAMSARE?Ye s .COULD THERE BE ANYTHING LIKE HAVING SOMETHING LIKE A HOLOGRAMOF BRENDA SUDDENLY SUPERIMPOSED OVER THE REPTILIAN?(long pause) I don't know, Linda. I really don't. All I can tell you is that my emotions at thetime were stunned. It was not fear so much in that particular incident as my mind linkedthe connection to the first incident (library and pentagram).WHAT IS YOUR HUSBAND SAYING TO YOU ABOUT YOUR DROPPING THEPLATE AND GOBLET?The minute that Brenda ran out, he made some kind of remark like, 'R, what happened?Did something happen I missed? What's going on?' It was like something happened and hecould not conceive she would have just run out. He could not conceive why I would dropthe food and the goblet of tea. It was just he was just stunned, 'What happened?'WHAT DID YOU SAY?I said something like, 'Did you see Brenda in any way different?' He said, 'She lookedawful tired.' And I knew right then that he had not seen her as I had perceived her at all.DO YOU NOW HAVE AN IMPRESSION OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THERED-HAIRED REPTILIAN IN THE LIBRARY, BRENDA BEING A REPTILIAN ANDYOUR SEEING IT BECAUSE SHE WAS EXHAUSTED AND WHAT THECONNECTION IS?The best I can tell you is at the time I did not. But when the book, The Bringers of theDawn came out, I read it. A lady had told me about it and she said, 'R, it's a far out book.You'll like it.' Because I did like what people call far-out books.I got the book and it made such an impression on me that you could verify this with my"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"husband quite easily: When I bought the book, I bought it on a Wednesday. We hadcompany on Wednesday night. Thursday morning, I started reading the book. Thursdaynight when James come in for supper after work, I was still reading the book. I propped itup on the faucet when I did dishes. I could not get the book out of my mind. The minute Ifinished the book, I started back on Page 1. I read the book twenty-seven times. I couldnot stop reading the book. I took notebooks. I still have two or three notebooks here. Itook each chapter. Then I took each page. Then I wrote how many words on each pagewas 'create.' I know how many 'create' or 'creating' on each page. I took each word andcircled it in the book.WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF 'CREATE' OR 'CREATING?'I don't know. It was like I had to do it. I don't know.IS THERE IN THE BRINGERS OF THE DAWN ANY DESCRIPTIONS ABOUTREPTILIANS?No descriptions at all, other than she (author Barbara Marciniak) calls them 'dark t-shirts.'But there is no physical description at all that you are going to say, 'If you see one, theyare going to look like this.' Absolutely not.DID YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE BOOK HAD ANY REFERENCE TOREPTILIANS IN IT?Not until I read the book.DID MARCINIAK USE THE TERM 'REPTILIAN' IN THE BOOK IN ANY WAY?Ye s . \"I know that you saw me as I really am.\"GOING BACK FOR A MOMENT TO BRENDA GOING OUT THE DOOR. YOU HAVEKNOWN HER WELL. DID YOU THEN TALK WITH HER THAT NIGHT OR THENEXT MORNING?No, I did not talk to her that night not for a couple of days. Before then, we were talkingtwo or three times a week. She had an answering machine. I would leave her a messageand she would call me back, or vice versa. I did not know what to say, Linda. How do youtell a person that you saw them in this manner? Then, if you knew me better, you wouldunderstand that I don't like things that I can't explain. After a week or so, I left her two orthree messages. She did not return my calls. I thought the only thing I could do is take thebull by the horns and go by her house. I knew she was there. I seen the car in the drive.I knocked on the door several times. Nobody come. I knew instinctively that Brenda wasthere and she just did not want to talk. So, I very calmly said, 'Brenda, you know who ishere and I'm going to sit on the porch until you come out.' She immediately opened thedoor and said, 'Come on in.'She was nice and very cool, very distant. It was like a barrier was put up. She said, 'I knowthat you saw me as I really am.' That's an almost direct quote.And my first question was: 'How many more is there of you just like you?'She said, 'R, there are four or five all women.'I said, 'No men?'She said, 'None that I know of.' And she told me an incident. Here several months beforethis happened with me, she had gotten up around midnight to use the bathroom and shesaid, 'I heard a voice saying, 'Help. I have fallen. I need help.' She said, 'I went outsidethinking it was my neighbor.' She said, 'Finally it dawned on me that it was not myneighbor. I got in the car and drove to a town about 40 miles away, following the voice.She said, 'I got there about 3 in the morning after just like playing the child's game aboutwhether something is hot or cold. Follow your instinct and go to this town. She said, 'Idrove into this little neighborhood and the voice was very strong at that point.'She said, 'I went around to the back.' She said, 'I was not scared. I knew that I wasfollowing something that was guiding me to this woman.' The woman told her through thebathroom window that was open a little bit that, 'I have fallen in the tub and I need help.'Brenda said, 'R, the woman was just like me.'"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"I never had nerve enough to tell Brenda that I saw her as a reptilian. She never mentionedthe word reptilian. The only thing she ever said is, 'I know you saw me as I really am.'HOW WAS THE CAMOUFLAGE OR DUALITY PERPETUATED?What do you mean?WHAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN APPEARING IN A HUMAN FORM ANDTHE REAL REPTILIAN FORM? HOW WAS THE HUMAN FORM SUSTAINED INPLACE OF THE REPTILIAN FORM?The only thing that I have ever come to terms with on that is that Brenda was totallyexhausted from working. I think that allowed for whatever way that she maintained herhuman form, she was tired.SO YOU DIDN'T TALK WITH HER ABOUT IT? YOU DIDN'T SAY, 'HOW DO YOUDO THIS?'No, ma'am, I did not. I did not have nerve enough to mention the reptilian form. I did notknow how to express it. She was very distant. She had put up a mental barrier and that wasit. We never talked again to this day.TO THIS DAY, AND SHE STILL LIVES THERE WHERE YOU ARE?No, she lives about an hour from me now.AS FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED, SHE IS STILL ALIVE AND IS STILL THERE?Yes. I heard through the grapevine that she had married. Whether that's true or not, I amassuming it is. But I do not know it for a fact.HOW DID SHE EXPLAIN HER INTEREST IN UFOS?It seems to me that Brenda was the oldest child and she had a little brother I'm going to saya year or so younger than her. Then, her mother died in childbirth when Brenda was aboutfour years old. She said, 'R, I knew my Daddy never touched me. I can remember that as akid. But yet, he doted on my brother.' She said, 'When my mother died and they come andtook away her body, she said she was standing in the doorway. My Daddy for the first timeI could ever remember touching me, picked me up and set me on the edge of the diningtable and told me: 'I don't know how to tell you this, but you are not mine. Your Daddy isfrom the heavens and I'm going to adopt you out.' And that afternoon, he took her to somechildren's home. And she was adopted. She never went to her mother's funeral.AND YOU'VE NEVER HAD A DISCUSSION WITH HER ABOUT HER PURPOSE, ORPURPOSE OF THESE OTHER WOMEN, AS REPTILIAN DISGUISED AS HUMAN?No. She would not call me again. The two or three times I tried to call her, she wouldnever answer.DO YOU THINK OF YOURSELF AS REPTILIAN?I have often wondered that. I don't know.HAVE YOU EVER SEEN YOURSELF AS A REPTILIAN IN A MIRROR?No, ma'am.HAS ANYONE OUTSIDE OF THE WOMAN IN THE LIBRARY INDICATED TO YOUTHAT YOU ARE REPTILIAN?Not really, but yes, vaguely. (R sought hypnosis in the 1980s and remembers thefollowing.)'During the regression, Linda, I can honestly tell you I don't know why it is soemotional, but it is I knew that I was the mother of seven children. I am the motherof only four children that I know of. I've never had a miscarriage. Never had aproblem having a child. Never had a problem carrying a child. And yet, I knew that Ihad seven children and that I had a daughter that was dead. The hypnotist said, 'R, your children were used as seeding other civilizationsbecause of your bloodline.'I said, 'What the heck does that mean? What bloodline?' She said, 'I don't want to getinto it because I think it might scare you.'"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Bloodlines - Key to Human Abduction Syndrome?BLOODLINES MIGHT BE A KEY TO THE WHOLE ABDUCTION SYNDROME. JIMMARRS AND I ARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEENTHE MESOPOTAMIAN BLOODLINE AND EXTRATERRESTRIAL PRESENCE.THAT RELATIONSHIP MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY THERE IS SUCH A STRONGDIVISION ON THIS PLANET BETWEEN MIDDLE EAST NATIONS AND OTHERS.BUT I'M ALSO CONFUSED ABOUT WHY IN BIBLICAL LITERATURE, THEREPTILIAN IS PAINTED AS THE BAD GUY IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN,WHEREAS YOU CAN ALSO LOOK AT IT THAT THE REPTILIAN IS THE ONE WHOWANTED TO WAKE UP ADAM AND EVE TO THE FACT THAT THE SO-CALLED'GOD' WAS NOT A GOD, BUT WAS AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL THAT WASMANIPULATING AND USING THEM.All I can tell you is that during my regression, I felt extraordinarily powerful. I felt I was anabsolute authority. I felt bigger. I don't know how to explain it. I felt great power, that Ihad great power, great clout, great authority. I felt the word 'impervious.' It was like,Linda, almost a god. If I had said, 'Die,' people would die. If I said, 'Live,' that peoplelived. That my voice, my whole manner was one of total authority. I know that soundsodd, but it's the truth. That's all I can tell you about that.Also, too, do you remember the tales in Zecharia Sitchin where we were the experiments?You understand?OH, YES.I felt like that at some time or another, I had a great deal of genetic background, geneticinformation, and yet I know that in this lifetime, I've been very average as far as educationgoes. I know nothing about genetics except what I read. I certainly do not have those typeskills. But in the regression, Linda, I know I did.WHAT DO YOU HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE SIX WOMEN ALL REPTILES ARE DOING?All I can tell you is from Brenda told me one other thing have you ever heard of theChurch of Sparrow Hawk Village up in Oklahoma?NO.It's quite a well known metaphysical church up in Sparrow Hawk, Oklahoma. We went to afire walking up there last year. Brenda told me that when she went there one time to hear aparticular speaker from England about UFOs, that she seen another 'star cousin' were herwords at the workshop there. When I asked her what the 'star cousin' was, she told me thatyou have to understand UFOs more. That was the only remark she made about a 'starcousin.'WHAT DO YOU NOW PSYCHICALLY THINK IS THE PURPOSE OFAUTHORITATIVE REPTILIANS MASQUERADING AS FEMALE HUMANS IN LIVESTHAT DON'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY POWER?I think that Brenda did have power. I think I do have more power than I realize.I MEANT IN TERMS OF HUMAN POLITICS.That I don't know. Brenda did not have any power at all in that way. I don't know. Onlythat I have assumed that there is a pyramid effect. You have Illuminati, the ones that arebehind the scenes. Then you have the ones that actually show to the public- like thePresident and then it comes down to the average working Joe. It's not a good answer. It'sjust is the most logical answer, but it answers nothing really.BUT DO YOU MEAN THAT IT WOULD BE LIKE THE SIX OF YOU HAVE SOMEAUTHORITY AND POWER IN THE REPTILIAN WORLD AND YOU AREDELIBERATELY MASQUERADED WITH AMNESIA IN NON-POLITICAL,NON-POWER HUMANS FOR ... WHAT?Linda, I don't know. All I can tell you is my feelings. I feel like I am being given keys toreptilian people. I've privately corresponded with some people who have seen reptilians.Sometimes they match what I saw. Sometimes they did not. Some of them have been veryinnocent-appearing people such as Brenda, possibly me, I don't know. All I know is thatsomewhere reptilians mean something to me in a way that I do not understand.WHAT WOULD BE THE REASON FOR HAVING TO MASQUERADE?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"I don't think the people are ready right now for such a thing. I think that only now are wecoming into the consciousness of them and could tolerate it. I think 20 years ago youwould have had panic in the streets. I think now through Zecharia Sitchin, Neil Freer,Barbara Marciniak, all these other people who are putting out this information it's comingforth for some reason at this particular time.\"If Earthfiles viewers have any information about the subject of this report,please e-mail: earthfiles@earthfiles.comOr mail to:P.
