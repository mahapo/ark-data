THE UFO CRASH/RETRIEVAL CONTINUUM The spree of saucer crashes in New Mexico and its environs during the post WWIIera is now legendary. As more data comes in to support Roswell, and to givecredence to others less publicized, even the most fastidious of critics in myreckoning have shown new interest - pro or con - in the crash/retrieval syndrome. \"But the jury is still out,\" say some on-the-fencers. Because of the location of thecrashes near military test facilities, a few still prefer to believe that the \"saucers\"were strayed experimental rockets or, as in the case of the Brazel ranch crash, anexploding weather balloon. Even the flammable Fugo balloons launched by theJapanese during WWII to harass the U. S. mainland were blamed as the crashedintruder by veteran Fortean researcher, John Keel. While it's hard to imagine how aballoon could fly aloft for two years in our stratosphere before crashing, otherRoswell researchers such as Schmitt, Moore and Friedman have independently putthe theory to rest. In my research, I have long been aware of other crashes in far-flung geographicalares since the late 1940s. While most of the stories are anecdotal, it is noteworthythat the reports describe a continuum of configurative features of the craft, thepresence of the little gray humanoids, both live and dead, the usual secret militaryrecovery operations and the usual cover-up denials. It is also worth noting that mostof the latter-day crashes were far away from rocket, missile or aircraft test ranges. In further consideration of the crashes since 1950 - and we have no authentic figuresof how many: our guess would probably be wrong anyway - we might rightly askwhether our super intelligent alien in his super flying machine is making the sameerrors as in 1947? Are they a result of poor navigational judgment or faultyequipment? I have no evidence to suggest that either is the case, except to entertainthe postulate that any corporeal being in our universe with the gift of a brain, issubject to making a goof and that the machinery he devised can also be occasionallydeficient. What might appear to be excessive crashes might not be the case at all ifwe can believe the great number of daily low-level flights the craft make worldwide.Consider, too, among the causes, the Earth's variable and often hostile terrain, faultlines, unpredictable weather conditions, plus many other man-manipulated hazardsutilizing electricity, nuclear energy, chemicals or just plain pollution. Whatever wewant to believe about the origin or nature of the UFO, something did go wrong on anumber of occasions over the past 50 years to cause malfunctions and the inevitablecrash. Without facts, we can only guess. Of interest, but not treated as an issue in this paper, are the frequent reports of giantfireballs that are witnessed traversing the skies and which seem to crash somewhereinto the horizon. Probably most have simply astronomical explanations. Alsopuzzling are the reports of fiery \"airplane\" crashes, sometimes accompanied byexplosive sounds. Search teams probe and find no wreckage. But, calculatingdistance can be tricky, especially at night. Some of these mystery phenomena might well have been a doomed UFO. Onceidentified and the point of crash determined by satellite sensors, their recoverywould remain secret. The media will follow up a scandalous crime story, but never"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"challenges the word of an opportune \"authority\" who opts to call a descending fieryobject a meteor. The \"authority's\" word finalizes the story and the mystery. A scenario of events similar to the aforementioned circumstances occurred within aweek or so in Southwest Ohio in the period of December 1988 to January 1989. OnJanuary 6, The Cincinnati Enquirer reported a \"meteor-like object\" that streakedacross Ohio skies triggering emergency calls from tri-state residents who thought theobject landed in their neighborhoods. It was probably a meteor, said DavidDuszynski of the Cincinnati Planetarium. On February 9, 1989, Ray Stanford, a veteran researcher, phoned me from his homein Maryland to report that he had received a report of a possible UFO crash nearDayton, Ohio, on December 26, 1988. Witnessed by the Assistant Police Chief ofLiberty, Ohio, and a companion - an amateur archaeologist from Urbana, Illinois -the object was described as a gigantic ball that was bright lime green changing toorange. Eyewitnesses watched it cut a tunnel through a low bank of clouds, theobject then descended straight down and crashed. Wright-Patterson AFB was called,an expedition looked for it and there was nothing in the news. During this time-frame (news clipping not available), I recall a big news story inCincinnati reporting a fiery airplane crash in the vicinity of Houston Woods, north ofCincinnati. Local and state police investigated and volunteer search teams lookedfar and wide. Nothing was found. It would be a highly unusual coincidence for a meteor to be the answer for all threeevents. A number of other more \"conventional\" crash events, not covered in myprevious Status Reports, follow: I am indebted to Jerold Johnson of Austin, Texas, for this scintilla of crash/retrievalinformation. Although brief, it covers some familiar territory in military retrievaloperations. Here are Johnson's introductory remarks quoted in part from his letter ofFebruary 4, 1989.Jerold Johnson: 'My informants, Mr. and Mrs. Black (pseudonym) have beenmy acquaintances since 1974 and I am certain that they are relaying theaccount as best they can remember fro hearing it in 1958. Your article, UFOCrash/Retrievals: Is the Cover-up Lid Lifting? in the MUFON UFO Journalcaused me to revisit my friends. I paid more attention this time to their C/Rstory for the record, which follows:Mr. Charles Harris (pseudonym), now deceased, was chief engineer orforeman in the Kent office of Ohio Edison. He was in charge ofelectric transmission lines. Sometime in the early fifties (1952-1955),he was alerted to a failure in the power lines near Aurora, Ohio. Hewent to investigate the power outage and at a location north ofStreetsboro, near the intersection of the road from Hudson (where theSea World is now), he found that some object had fallen from the skycutting through the power lines and gouged a crater some 30 feet longand 9 feet deep in the earth. Being one of the first witnesses on the scene, Harris was able toapproach the wreckage of this object and observed a small box ofdense, stone-like material with one 'knob' on it, which occasionallyemitted a tone or beep but did nothing else, regardless of how the knobwas turned. The Army soon arrived and ushered all civilians out of thearea. It was suggested that there might be danger from radiation. Thewitness related that two tractor-trailer vehicles were required to haulout the large quantity of wreckage, which took off for Dayton, Ohio.The military cleaned up the site and bulldozed the area of the craterflat again. The witness was surprised that nothing of the eventappeared in any newspapers and assumed that the story had beensuppressed. No mention was made of any alien occupants or bodiesseen. But the witness related his story in the context of UFOs andconsidered it a serious matter.' CRASH/RETRIEVAL: OREGON-IDAHO BORDER Bruce Molon of Griffith, Indiana, is the kind of investigator that we need more of inUFO research. He is dedicated, deep-thinking and doesn't take \"wooden nickels\" inhis quest for truth, the facts. In his pursuit of one promising informant, a formermarine who claimed that he was involved in a C/R incident, he was faced with the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"problem of pinning down his source who worked as an auxiliary policeman at nightin a risky section of town. In his letter of April 24, 1991, he explained: \"Severalhours after I spoke with you on the phone on April 6, 1991, I met my informant andconducted an informal interview while standing up in an East Chicago parking lot.\"Details follow:Bruce Molon: 'The crash occurred June 27, 1979, in a wild area of forestedmountains in southeastern Oregon near the Idaho border. When I asked whatwas the nearest town, he seemed to think carefully and then answered that itreally wasn't a town per se, but a campsite where hunters and campersbrought motor homes and the like. He could not remember the name of thiscampsite. The crashing object had left deep ruts in the earth and had damaged trees inthe process. By the time my informant arrived, the object had been removedand placed on the back of a large flat semi-trailer covered with a tarp securedby straps. He claims that the shape under the tarp was that of a low dome witha circular circumference. Pieces of strange metal had fallen from behind the trailer from the objectunder the tarp onto the ground. My informant and another soldier handledthese pieces, some of which were as large as a human being. I questioned himabout the texture and appearance of the metal. He claimed that it was a dullgrayish-brown metal similar in appearance to fresh cast iron, but not entirelyso. Some surfaces were smooth, but others where the pieces had apparently beentorn from a larger section exhibited a very rough appearance. My informantand his partner were amazed at the extremely light weight of the pieces. Theylooked as if they had been subjected to great heat. My informant's main role in this affair was to load crates onto helicopters(these were already created when he arrived and thus he could not saydefinitely what they contained) and then guard the scene for a short timebefore everything was evacuated and the site cleaned up. My informant stated that right after this, he was abruptly transferred toembassy duty in Central America for several months. I questioned the informant for about an hour alone. I asked him some leadingquestions to see if he would get mixed up or make a statement that wouldcontradict previous statements. He passed these tests well; i.e., 'So you say themetal was shiny and silvery?' Answer: 'No, it wasn't shiny, but dullgray-brown.' The informant is a non-technical nature, is not an avid reader, and claims notto have read UFO literature. Some of the subtle details he has stated are notgenerally available in UFO literature, particularly the supermarket-newsstandvariety.' Molon also learned from his informant that he had occasion to view UFO artifactsand alien bodies at Grafford AFB in Nevada on Thanksgiving weekend in 1973 or1974. No details yet. But, he alleges that he was abruptly transferred to theGuantanamo Base in Cuba for several months. Such action experienced twice by themarine after sensitive assignments is typical of military security to prevent personnelfrom pooling information about their duties. See my Status Report IV, the FatalEncounter at Ft. Dix-McGuire, A Case Study, 1985. In this incident, my source wastransferred to Okinawa. Others involved as guards were sent to various U. S. AirForce bases worldwide. As Molon says, this kind of information is not available inthe usual run of UFO literature. ANECDOTAL CRASHES Researchers who seriously study UFO crash/retrievals know that qualitative reportsof such alien disasters are scarce and that most, coming from 'non-inside' sources,are of the anecdotal variety. Usually they are without dates and places andsometimes even without the names of witnesses. If remembered, the sources areeither unreachable or deceased. I stopped counting such factless reports two yearsago, which then had exceeded 400. The people who describe these alleged incidents,I find, are usually honest, well-meaning persons hoping that even their fragments ofinformation can be helpful. I decided to assert my belief of the importance of the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"anecdote by publishing a collection of cases in Status Report III (upcoming atEarthfiles.com) under the heading, The Interminable Cases. Stan Friedman mightdiscard such material; I keep them for their referential value. the noise of the past has abated. Anecdotes continue to come in and one example ofan incident with limited details - with a possible clue -is a story taped by researcher,Virgil Staff, of Berkeley, California, who interviewed Carolyn Brazil at her home onApril 12, 1991. According to the tape Staff sent me, Carolyn was 12 or 13 years old in 1946 or 1947when her \"favorite\" uncle, Ralph Scheibly, who worked for the Raymond ConcretePile Company (pile driving for bridge construction) in the Bay area, was on agovernment project in New Mexico or Arizona. At dusk, the uncle and his crewheard a loud explosion nearby. With John Perry and John Jones, he went toinvestigate and they were shocked to see the wreckage of a strange craft - not anairplane - causing a lot of dust and smoke. It was like looking through a fog, said theuncle. They also witnessed three small beings outside the craft, one crawling awayfrom the debris. In short time, a group of military people came to the scene and tookover the retrieval operation. All witnesses, including her uncle and co-workers, wererounded up and driven to a building (distance unknown) where the one live alienwas also delivered in a separate vehicle. The witnesses were separated and told theyhad witnessed a U. S. secret project that failed and not to talk about the incident.Her uncle, angered, said he was brainwashed for several hours before beingreleased. Carolyn said that her uncle lamented his treatment and the cover-up until his deathin 1952. She also believed that the Raymond Concrete Pile Company still was inbusiness and Virgil Staff said he hoped to penetrate deeper into the case. And onemore clue: accounts of the mystery crash, according to her uncle, were written up inthe newspapers. But to find the story, it would take many large staffs to find the cityand the year it happened. In summary, it is my belief that a story like Carolyn's is not a fabrication. A hoaxer,or a misinformant, would have been less vague about important details. It is also mybelief that information related through the anecdote is the least likely to be the targetfor disinformation which, I suspect, is used to contaminate the credibility of themore popular crashes. Recall that Dr. Epigoni said in his interview with Don that aspecial group had been set up in the past year to control UFO information. See:Stringfield Part 9. Other anecdotal C/R incidents from many new sources in the past two or three yearscan be added to my \"Blue Ribbon\" collection with vague dates and places or wherethe source claims his or her sources faded away in fear. But one report, with apositive year of occurrence, struck me as a case deserving attention, which follows. UFO CRASH/RETRIEVAL: CAPE GIRARDEAU, MISSOURI - 1941 Ray Fowler, an old-time trusted researcher and a successful author, whose mostrecent work is The Watchers (about Betty Andreasson), sent me a copy of a letterfrom a source in Texas named Charlette Mann. She shared her knowledge of a UFOcrash and recovery in 1941! After discussing her case by phone, she rewrote herreport with more details and dated it May 6, 1991, for publication here.Charlette Mann: 'I would like to thank you for sending me your two reportsto read. I found them to be fascinating, I must say. It makes me feel a littlebetter to find there are other people in the world who have information theyfeel to be true, but with only parts of the stories. I shall try to relate to you asbest I can the information of my grandfather's UFO crash experience. First, let me tell you about my grandfather, Reverend William Huffman. Hewas born in August 1888. He grew up and went to school in Missouri. Heattended college in Bolivar. After graduation, he went to a seminary. He wasan ordained Baptist minister until his death in September of 1959. He was alsoa school teacher during those years. He was a very quiet man who was wellrespected. Most of my information came from questioning my grandmother, Floy, whileshe lived in our home before her death in 1984. She never would talk about itbefore then because grandfather had said for her not to. My father had toldme some of the information, but it meant more to me hearing it fromgrandmother."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" It happened in the spring of 1941. About 9 to 9:30 p.m. one evening, granddadgot a telephone call from the police department saying they had receivedreports that a plane had crashed outside of town and would he go in casesomeone needed him. Of course he said, yes. A car was sent to get him, butgrandmother said it was not a police car. After grandfather returned that night, he explained what he had seen tograndmother, my father, guy, and Uncle Wayne. But he said they were neverto speak of it again as he had given his word. Grandmother said he never didtalk about it after that. He said they drove out of town 13-15 miles or so and then parked the cars onthe side of the road and had to walk 1/4 of a mile or so into a field where hecould see fire burning. Grandfather said it wasn't an airplane or like any craft he'd ever seen. It wasbroken and scattered all around, but one large piece was still together and itappeared to have a rounded shape with no edges or seams. It had a very shinymetallic finish. You could see inside on section and see what looked like ametal chair with a panel with many dials and gauges - none familiar looking tohim. He said that when he got there, men were already sifting through things.There were some police officers, plain clothes people and military men. There were three bodies, not human, that had been taken from the wreckageand laid on the ground. Grandfather said prayers over them so he got a closelook, but didn't touch them. He didn't know what had killed them becausethey didn't appear to have any injuries and they weren't burned. It was hardfor him to tell if they had on suits or if it was their skin, but they were coveredhead to foot in what looked like wrinkled aluminum foil. He could see no hairon the bodies and they had no ears. They were small framed like a child about4 feet tall, but had larger heads and longer arms. They had very largeoval-shaped eyes, no noses - just holes - and no lips - just small slits formouths. There were several people with cameras taking pictures of everything. Two ofthe plain clothes men picked up one of the little men, held it under its arms. Apicture was taken. That was the picture I later saw. Then one of the militaryofficers talked to granddad and told him he was not to talk about or repeatanything that had taken place for security reasons so as not to alarm thepeople. Granddad returned home, told his family and that was it. About twoweeks after it happened, he came home with a picture of the two men holdingthe little man. After my grandfather died, my Dad kept the picture and was very interested inUFO info. Then when I was 10 or 11, a close friend of my Dad's asked if hecould borrow the photo to show to his folks. So, Dad let him have it and nevergot it back. My recollection from what I saw in the picture was a small man about 4 feettall with a large head and long arms. He was thin and no bone structure wasapparent - kind of soft-looking. He had no hair on his head or body and hadlarge, oval, slightly slanted eyes, but not like an Oriental from left to right. Hiswere more up and down. He had no ears at all and no nose like ours. Thereappeared to be only a small, straight line where the mouth should have been.His skin or suit looked like crinkled-up tin foil and it covered all of him. I can'tremember much about how his feet were for some reason. I guess myattention was focused more on his face. I believe he had three fingers, allquite long, but I can't be sure on this. I've tried to draw a picture for you, but Iam not good at it. I hope it will give you some idea of how (the little man)looked to me.' Stringfield: With a crash case of this vintage, 1941, the testimony of the one andonly source available, is crucial. Its ultimate believability is up to Charlette Mannand the information she relates. In the main, the whole case depends on her memoryand the discussions she had with older members of the family who were in a positionto relate directly with the firsthand source, the minister. After discussing the incident several times with Charlette by phone, I feltincreasingly comfortable with her manner of response to my questions, mostly abouther family and her own background. To me, she sounded sincere and everything shesaid about her immediate family, including an up-coming graduation of her daughter,"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"were all normal. Then in her second letter, she described in more detail the photo showing the \"alien\"with its arms outstretched, propped up by two men. The red flag went up. Instantlycoming to mind was another old photo that made the rounds in the early days of myresearch which also showed an alien with arms outstretched also being held up bytwo men who were wearing trench coats and wide-brimmed hats. Although therewere differences in respect to the description of the apparel worn by the men in herphoto, I was still concerned about the parallels; i.e., outstretched arms and two menwearing wide-brimmed hats. If both photos, I reasoned, were identical or evensimilar, then something was wrong about the whole Cape Girardeau story - if thephoto I had seen before was a hoax. I called Charlette the same day I got her letter and, without telling her about theallegedly hoaxed photo, I asked her to describe in more detail the one she had seen,especially the alien and the clothing of the two men. Her response was one ofcertainty: the alien she remembered was about 4 feet tall with a very large head byhuman proportions for the body size. From what I could recall from the hoaxedphoto, hers was distinctly different. Of the two men, she said one was wearing ajacket and slacks; the other was in a white shirt. Then I explained my reason forcalling and went on to relate that the two men in the photo I had seen were wearingtrench coats. On this point, Charlette was positive - no trench coats! To satisfy my own curiosity about my old photo, which got lost in my files, I askedmy cooperative German research friend, Michael Hesemann, who had called me onanother matter, if he still had a copy of the photo that he had declared to b an \"AprilFool's Day Hoax,\" published in a Cologne, Germany newspaper in 1950. See StatusReport III. He sent me a copy of it by fax the next day. But I must admit that Iforgot that two women also appeared in the posed shot. I sent a copy to Charlettefor her comment to which she responded on June 6, 1991, as follows:Charlette Mann: 'Thank you for sending me the copy of the picture of thealien you got from Germany. it is nothing like what I saw. Your pictureshowed men in overcoats while in my picture, the man had no coats. It waswarm weather when the crash occurred and the two men were dressed inslacks. One had a white dress shirt with sleeves rolled up; the other had on ashort-waisted jacket with a dress shirt. Your picture shows two women; mine, none. The alien in yours looks like atiny doll, much smaller and shorter than mine. The alien in my picture wasabout 4 feet tall when being held between the two men about up to theirwaists. They were holding him under the armpits with the arms outstretchedacross in front of them. Mine had no clothing or boots as your picture shows.The arms of mine were much longer than yours and its head larger. The onlything similar was the wide-brimmed hats that the two men wore.'\" Continued in Part 16 - Bodies and Craft at Wright Field, OhioCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
