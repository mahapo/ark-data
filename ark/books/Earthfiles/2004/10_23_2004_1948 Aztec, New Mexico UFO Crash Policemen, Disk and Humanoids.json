He showed me an alleged briefing paper forthe President of the United States about \"unidentified aerial vehicles\" and entities. One ofthe pages contained a list of locations where American military and intelligence units hadretrieved aerial vehicles described as \"extraterrestrial,\" along with humanoid bodies - bothdead and alive. In addition to the well known name Roswell, other sites on the crashretrieval list included Magdalena near the Plains of San Augustin; Kingman, Arizona;northern Mexico south of Loredo, Texas; and Aztec, New Mexico. See other EarthfilesAztec crash reports in More Information below. In 1986, several years of research about the Aztec, New Mexico UFO crash was compiledand published in the book, UFO Crash At Aztec - A Well Kept Secret © 1986 by William S.Steinman and Wendelle C. Stevens. Limited edition out of print, originally published in 1986by America West Distributors, Boulder, Colorado. The Steinman and Stevens front cover photograph is familiar to all of us who have madethe trek to Hart Canyon about twelve miles northeast of Aztec, New Mexico, where a99-foot-diameter silver-colored lens-shaped craft was allegedly found up on top of themesa in a spot where even the rocks had been sheared off, apparently by the force of thecraft's impact.

Businessman Scott Ramsey, Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Express WireServices, Inc. in Charlotte, North Carolina, joined up with former New Mexico StateLegislator, Andrew Kissner, in the mid-1990s to try to confirm one way or the other ifAztec was a real event that the U. S. government had skillfully covered up for nationalsecurity reasons. Kissner had been working with New Mexico Congressman Steven Schiff(deceased) in an investigation of the famous and controversial Corona UFO crash site onthe Mac Brazel ranch several miles north of Roswell around July 4, 1947. At the sametime, Scott Ramsey was trying to follow up a reference in Frank Scully's 1950 book,Behind the Flying Saucers, in which Scully talked about the early detection of the Azteccraft by Top Secret radar bases in New Mexico.Andy Kissner was doing an official New Mexico historical research project trying to findpre-Cold War artifacts meaning secret bases and that type of thing to put on the historicallandmark list - and became interested in Scott Ramsey's research to find out whether topsecret radar bases had existed in New Mexico as Scully described. Andrew Kissner, in hisofficial state legislator position, arranged to travel with Scott to Maxwell AFB inMontgomery, Alabama, to start looking for anything that had to do with the Cold War.This week I talked with Scott about his and Andrew Kissner's discovery that the top secretradar bases did exist. Further, Scott was lead to the families of two Aztec and Cuba, NewMexico, police officers. For the first time, Scott Ramsey talked to me this week about thepolicemen having been scrambled on a night back in 1948 to go to Hart Canyon. Thesetestimonies about a large, silver disk on the mesa above Hart Canyon and the existence ofthree powerful radar stations around Los Alamos and Albuquerque contradict decades ofgovernment denials.1946-1957 - Top Secret Radar Bases in New MexicoScott Ramsey, Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Express Wire Services, Inc.,Charlotte, North Carolina: \"Actually before we had gone to Montgomery, we had foundthe first top secret radar base by dumb luck and took photographs of it with us to MaxwellAFB. We said we had found an old base up in the northern New Mexico mountains andasked, 'What can you tell us about it?' The Maxwell AFB people did not even have it intheir files! Several trips later, we found proof that three Top Secret powerful radar bases"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"were built by the Atomic Energy Commission and were operational between 1946 and1957. Andy requested that all those historic files be declassified and that's how we came tounderstand the importance of those three radar installations.AM I CORRECT IN REMEMBERING THAT THEY WERE ORIGINALLY BUILT TOPROTECT THE MANHATTAN PROJECT AT LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LAB?That's correct. Sandia National Lab was secondary priority and Kirtland AFB was third.THAT'S WHY IT WAS THE ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION WHO BUILT THEMAND THEY WERE CLASSIFIED TOP SECRET ALONG WITH THE MANHATTANPROJECT BECAUSE NO ONE IN THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WANTEDANYONE TO KNOW THAT WE WERE DEVELOPING THE BOMB AND TRYINGTO PROTECT LOS ALAMOS WITH THOSE MICROWAVE STATIONS?That's correct. But the microwave came into play actually after W.W.II. They wereexperimenting with a very powerful radar that was a prototype for the U. S. Navy. It was apre-LASH-UP powerful radar. Picture two ships at sea. There is no obstruction. If youremember the old microwave radar ranges the last thing you do is put anything metallic init. Those powerful microwave radars would search out through their powerful waves andfind anything metallic it didn't matter how far out in the ocean or how far beyond thehorizon it was.Historic map of Aircraft Control and Warning radar stations in the LASHUP military programprovided to New Mexico State Representative J. Andrew Kissner by the Air CombatCommand, Peterson AFB, Colorado Springs, Colorado.Los Alamos was a good place to test the radar because the Manhattan Project lab had arestricted air space back in that time frame of 1946 to 1957. The problem is that ifanything metallic would fly in that airspace, that could cause havoc be it a private Cessnaplane, a commercial airplane or even a military transport plane. None would want to flythrough the radar beams when they were operating the microwave stations.NOR MAYBE EVEN DISKS?Nor even disks.COULD THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY ALLEGED CRASHES AND RETRIEVALSIN THE 1940S TO 1950S BECAUSE THE U. S. GOVERNMENT WASEXPERIMENTING WITH MICROWAVE ENERGY AND SOMETIMESTRIANGULATING AND MAYBE SOMETIMES WE BROUGHT DOWN ONE ORMORE OF THESE NON-TERRESTRIAL CRAFT?It's certainly a good theory. They did not run the microwave radar all the time, 24 hours aday. As a matter of fact, I have the monthly reports about how many hours it operated andit was basically flipping on an experiment and then shutting it back off. The Air Force waskind enough to give me the Operator's Manual with it that specifically says: Do Not"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Operate This If The Other Radars Are Detecting Aircraft In The Area.WHERE WERE THE THREE RADAR INSTALLATIONS?1) You had one on the western side of New Mexico. It was called the Continental Divideradar base, a bit east of Gallup.2)The primary one went under three names:Los Alamos Radar Base.That changed in the 1950s to the Tierra Amarilla radar base.Then from the early 1950s to 1957, it was renamed the El Vado Radar Base.3) Then northeast of Albuquerque was the third radar installation, Moriarty.A triangle of sensitive geographic areas and three secret experimental microwave radar stations.Construction begun in late 1947 of El Vado (AFS-P8), Moriarty (AFS-P7), and Continental Divide(AFS-P51). The three radar stations were part of the U. S. Aircraft Control and Warning (AC&W)system that also became known as LASHUP. One of El Vado's specific missions was to protect theLos Alamos Laboratory and the Atomic Energy Commission's atomic bombproduction at Los Alamos and Sandia Base.DO YOU THINK THEY KEPT CHANGING THE NAME AROUND LOS ALAMOSFOR SECURITY REASONS?No, it was more political. When the AEC handed it over to the AF in 1950, they named itthe Tierra Amarilla because that was the nearest town. Then for whatever reason probablywhen they matched it up to the 8th Air Force, they renamed it the El Vado strategicallyprobably because in the air you could locate it because of the El Vado Lake which ismanmade. The reason it is manmade is to produce hydro-electricity that runs to this day toLos Alamos National Lab.THOSE THREE RADAR INSTALLATIONS WERE ALLEGEDLY CLOSED DOWNWHAT YEAR?1957.ANY INDICATION THAT ONE OR MORE ARE STILL OPERATIONAL IN SOMEWAY ?No, they are all gone. I've been to all three.WHAT LINK, IF ANY, IS THERE BETWEEN THE OPERATION OF THOSE THREEVERY STRONG AND POWERFUL RADAR SITES AND THE CRASH - OR PERHAPSLANDING OR FORCED LANDING OF - THE DISK IN HART CANYON NEARAZTEC?It would be purely speculation at this point, but it's a good theory. See 04-02-00Earthfiles, Parts 1 and 2"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Police Officers and 1948? Aztec UFO CrashThis police discovery probably started with our first witness, Ken Farley, that mycolleague, Randy Barnes, and I interviewed back in the 1990s. Ken came off as a verycredible witness. We flew down to Phoenix and drove to where he was living. He wasdying at the time and he sent word to Randy that he wanted to get his story on the recordbefore he passed away.So, we went down to meet with him and during his story, he told Randy and me about thetwo police officers that were at the Aztec crash site. We kind of parked Ken's story on theside until we interviewed Doug Nolan about a year ago (2003) right before he passedaway. About half way through his interview, he talked about two police officers who wereat the Hart Canyon crash site.I've got his interview notes in front of me right now and he talked about the one policeofficer from the local Aztec area and the other young police officer was from the town ofCuba, New Mexico. Doug Nolan went over and asked the policemen, 'Who are you?' Dougsaid one of the policemen described following an aerial 'thing' throughout the night throughthe early hours of the morning up what is now Highway 550. Back then, it would havebeen Highway 44, the old connector from Cuba up to the Four Corners area.So Doug's story matched Ken Farley's about the two police officers and the year he thinksit happened was 1948, but he did not have a more specific date.WHAT ABOUT THE EXACT LOCATION?He said the crash site where we we have built the plaque stand is it and he defined that bythe oil field drip tanks that were removed in late 1990s the big storage tanks that areslightly visible on the cover of Bill Steinman's book and photos we have going back to thelate 1980s that we photographed the area before the tanks were removed. He doescorrelate the date with the big brush fire that happened down in Hart Canyon, which iswhat drew him out to the canyon that day.SO THIS WOULD BE IN HART CANYON WHERE WE'VE ALL BEEN TO A SITEWHERE YOU HAVE PUT A MARKER THE LOCATION WHERE THE MARKER ISWHERE SOMETHING CAME DOWN FROM OUTER SPACE.Yes, the marker is just northwest of the epicenter where they said the craft came to rest. Policemen Describe Craft and HumanoidsCAN YOU EXPLAIN IN SOME DETAILS THE POLICE OFFICERS HAVE SAID SOFA R ?There are three police officers we are interested in right now. We're working with familiesand have agreed not to release names. I have not talked with the police officers. The onepolice officer from Cuba died Nov. of 2000. The other died in the early 1990s. So now I'mgoing on secondhand testimony from family and friends.The main police officer from the local area basically came forward in 1972 at a 4th of Julypicnic when the Aztec story emerged during the picnic. He finally said to the family, 'Thatactually did happen. I was one of the police officers at the crash site that day.' Going backto the family members, they remember him saying, 'I was one of the police officers at thescene.'"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Apparently, though, there were three involved. The one I will mention and that was AndyAndrews, who was probably in his fifties back at the time of the Aztec incident we don'tpinpoint him at the crash site, although he might have been with the Cuba police officergoing up Highway 44 the night of the alleged crash. He might have gone into town to alertone of the sheriffs of San Juan County and drawn him out to the crash site and told himthey had followed the object up Highway 44. That part we're still trying to piece together.WHAT EXACTLY DID THEY DESCRIBE THAT THEY SAW?Large saucer-shaped object, no visible markings, no seams, rivets or weld marks. Perfectlysmooth. More pewter in color. going back to Ken Farley and Doug Nolan and the twopolice officers and going back and retrieving the testimony from the families, they keptusing the words: 'It looked like it had been molded absolutely perfectly. No seams.' Verysmooth, pewter in color, a sort of dull grey color.A computer simulation of a photograph allegedly seen by former military officer. Source said large,silver-colored disk was found near Farmington, New Mexico (15 miles from Aztec) prior to 1950.YOU HAVE SEEN MY BOOK, GLIMPSES OF OTHER REALITIES -VOL. II: HIGHSTRANGENESS IN WHICH I HAVE A TRANSCRIPT FROM AN INTERVIEW DONEWITH A MAN WHO SAID HE WORKED FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND SAWPHOTOGRAPHS FROM AN AZTEC/FARMINGTON CRASH. HE SAID THE CRASHOCCURRED ON A ST. PATRICK DAY IN MARCH AND HINTED THE DATE WASTWO YEARS BEFORE THE 1950 FARMINGTON 'UFO ARMADA' FLEW OVER. See:03-16-02 Earthfiles.HOW DOES IT COMPARE TO THE COMPUTER-GENERATED GRAPHIC I HAVE INGLIMPSES OF OTHER REALITIES, VOL. II: HIGH STRANGENESS?Pretty close. Large object. Two lenses put together with a 15 to 18 foot bubble in themiddle. We did have Ken Farley draw, even though he was on oxygen and near death, hedid draw a hand-sketch of what he remembered and what angle it was laying in the groundand I'm looking at that as I talk to you. It's pretty consistent with what Doug Nolan'stestimony was as well. Humanoid Entities in Aztec Crash?WHAT ABOUT ENTITIES?Doug Nolan did say he saw at least two. Again, I'll give you a little background on DougNolan. He was a 19-year-old employee of the El Paso Oil Company back at this timeframe. That's why we are pinpointing it to 1948, based on his 19-year-old age. He wasgetting ready for work. They start very early out in the oil fields His boss, Bill Ferguson,who is also deceased when Doug picked him up he said, 'We've got to get out to HartCanyon immediately. There is a bad brush fire and it's near one of the drip tanks that thecompany owned.'Obviously, with all the natural gas out there, a brush fire and drip tanks are ingredients fora disaster. They got out to the crash site and there were other oil workers that hadsurrounded basically it looked more like a lightning strike. They said the brush fire hadnothing to do with what they discovered later, which was the disk.One of the other oil field workers that Doug had know for years from high school said,'Hey, this brush fire isn't really what you need to see. What we have on the mesa is whatwe're amazed about. We don't know what it is.'"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"They went out with Bill Ferguson being the senior and lead man at the time and there laidthe disk out on the end of the mesa.WERE THERE ENTITIES THERE?Doug and Bill Ferguson climbed up on the craft and looked in the window and Doug saidhe could see two humanoid beings slumped over.HAS ANYONE YOU'VE INTERVIEWED DRAWN FOR YOU ENTITIES OR CRAFT ?Just drawings of the craft.IS IT ALWAYS THE SAME DRAWING IN TERMS OF AZTEC?Yes. There are two things that I've left out my presentation that Doug Nolan and KenFarley described on the craft, and I'm still withholding that and using it as my bait for otherfuture eyewitnesses. After Doug's interview, we know there were a lot more locals and oilfield workers at the crash site, which would tell me that some of these people are still alive.I'm withholding unique craft details to see if that would help verify any future claims aspeople come forward. Symbols Inside Aztec Crashed DiskMAY I ASK IF THIS INVOLVES SYMBOLS EITHER INSIDE OR OUTSIDE THECRAFT?Ye s .SO THE ISSUE WOULD BE WHETHER YOU CAN FIND PEOPLE WHO MIGHTINDEPENDENTLY BE ABLE TO DRAW SYMBOLS THAT MIGHT RELATE TOSOMEBODY ELSE'S WHO ACTUALLY SAW THEM INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THECRAFT?That is correct. Everybody, according to Doug and Ken who were there, commented andwent up and looked at that symbol.WAS IT ONLY ONE?There were several. Where Is the Aztec Silver Disk Today?SCOTT, WHERE DO YOU THINK THE AZTEC DISK IS TODAY?Give me another year of research and I'll answer that intelligently because I've had someof the retired guys speculate where it was stored.WHERE DO YOU THINK?In the State of New Mexico.UNDERGROUND?It is now.WOULD IT BE A PLACE WE WOULD ALL RECOGNIZE?It would be a place where people drive by all the time and would not give it a secondthought.HAVE YOU EVER TALKED WITH ANYONE WHO SAID THEY HAD WORKEDFIRSTHAND INSIDE OR OUTSIDE AROUND THAT CRAFT?Not firsthand. Again, we have some good secondhand witnesses. One you and I talkedabout the other day a gentleman if I do a little more research in the next few days, I'll havesome more information for you. He was a well-known cryptologist at the time. Before hisdeath in 1972 remember, we are racing the undertaker - It's 56 years ago. Even if theywere in their twenties or thirties at the time, they are all starting to get up in age. But in1972, he told family members and close friends when the subject of UFOs came up, hesaid he had worked on trying to decipher the hieroglyphics that were on the Aztec crash"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"and said the word \"Aztec\" specifically. Not just a disk in New Mexico, but the Aztec UFO.HAS ANYBODY TALKED TO YOU ABOUT THE AZTEC CRAFT HAVINGINTERIOR MOLDED CABINETS IN WHICH HUMAN AND ANIMAL PARTS WEREFOUND?I've heard that story over the years. I just have not interviewed anyone firsthand thatwitnessed that. As you know, I've talked to a gentleman retired from Air Force Intelligenceand he and I have had several conversations. He was never at the crash site, but handledthe daily intelligence reports on how the recovery was coming. I asked him about bodyparts being found in containers inside the Aztec disk. He had heard that, but did notbelieve it. He heard that after he left the Air Force. More rumor mill than anything else.IF TRUE, SCOTT, IT MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENTHAS TRIED TO SUPPRESS ALL EVIDENCE ABOUT THE STRANGEEXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITY LINK ON THIS PLANET. WHEN ITHAS COME TO AZTEC, NOTHING IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE EXISTED ANDEVERYTHING SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ERASED.Let's look at it from a logical standpoint. If someone was visiting this planet from howeverlight years away, look at what we do when we go to Mars and moon. We collect samples.It's logical that an expedition team came to this planet, they would probably want to leavewith some type of samples.BUT THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR DECADES THOUSANDS OF ANIMALS WEKNOW HAVE BEEN AFFECTED. SO THIS APPEARS TO FALL INTO THECATEGORY, AS PEOPLE HAVE TOLD ME, OF BEING A GENETIC HARVEST ASOPPOSED TO SAMPLING.Yes, it could be.IT COULD BE WHY AZTEC IS SO SENSITIVE.Going back and interviewing everybody the retired AF gentleman who worked on thedaily intel reports. He feels that Aztec was so well kept a secret until recently because theyhad botched Roswell so badly. Putting it in the newspaper and then retracting the storyand even up until a few years ago, they can't get their denial stories straight.Aztec was more clean. I think they had almost had time to prepare for 'another one.' Theyhad a recovery operation, whether it was based in Colorado Springs or wherever(Interplanetary Unit, IPU) we're still declassifying records on that as we speak. Theredefinitely was a retrieval group. They were more prepared for what would happen,whether a UFO, Soviet bomber, a satellite, a rocket booster, whatever. The Military at thatpoint in the Cold War was very prepared to recover something in the utmost secrecy andsneak it to where they had to sneak it.One quick story I have to tell you:We were going through the classified records of one of these retrieval groups. In themid-1950s, nine men in the former Soviet Union these are nine U. S. Air Force intel guys watched a rookie pilot botch a landing in a Soviet Mig. The pilot bailed out and the Migwent into a river. I'm going to give you the condensed version of a 48-page report.This group of guys in a period of two weeks disassembled a Mig under water and sneakedit out piece by piece in a hay wagon and that Mig ended up at Wright-Patterson AFB inOhio. While we were going through declassifying records, I went to Archie De Fontaineand said, 'Read this. This should be a made-for-TV movie.' At the end of it they wereproud to say they recovered everything from the Mig, except the canopy, the pilot and theejection seat.Now, if nine guys in the former Soviet Union can bring a Mig out of that country in a haywagon in two weeks, what kind of group of well trained people on our own soil do with allthe resources at their fingertips?AND IT'S ALL 'FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY,' WHETHER IT'S A CRAFT FROMANOTHER SOLAR SYSTEM OR GALAXY OR A MIG FROM OUR ENEMY, THESOVIET UNION, BACK THEN.HAVE ANY OF THESE PEOPLE WHO ALLEGED THEY HAD FIRSTHANDEXPERIENCE, EITHER WITH TRYING TO BACK ENGINEER OR WORKING ONCRAFT OR TRYING TO DECIPHER SYMBOLS OR ANYONE WHO MIGHT HAVEBEEN INVOLVED WITH BODIES, ALIVE OR DEAD HAVE ANY OF THEM SAID TOYOU ON OR OFF THE RECORD WHAT THEY WERE TOLD ABOUT THEIMPLICATION OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES BEING HERE"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"FROM OUR GOVERNMENT'S POINT OF VIE?No, because my firsthand experience with anyone from the U. S. military has been verylimited on the Aztec incident. The eyewitnesses that have come forward late in life, theywere threatened and reminded of their patriotic duties and all those things we've heardover the years. But as far as anyone in the military the best witness I've had did not evenwork at the crash site. He worked behind the scenes on the intel reports, so that would notinvolve him at that point.WHAT DID HE SAY ABOUT THE DAILY REPORTS?Basically he was very compartmentalized. What his job was there were 200 (and he saidhe could remember that number pretty well because he was in charge of all the files) hisjob was to make sure of all the 200 people involved in whatever fashion of the (Aztec)recovery, to draw personnel files on a DAILY basis showing that they would never be inthat area (covering up their work at Aztec with phony words about assignments in otherparts of the country or world).The example he gave me when we met in 1999 was that if years later somebody wouldspout off and say, 'Hey, there was a crash at Aztec, or a recovery operation,' a quick checkof their personnel files would show they were at McDill AFB during that time frame.These falsified records would also include notations such as , 'On Thursday, he sprainedhis ankle playing volleyball and was in the infirmary for two days.' So my source hadessentially 200 personnel files to doctor during the entire recovery.TO COVER UP, TO MISINFORM, TO MAKE SURE NONE OF US WOULD HAVEANY KIND OF SUCCESSFUL PAPER TRAIL TO THOSE PEOPLE.Exactly. \"More Information:Please see other Earthfiles reports about the alleged Aztec, New Mexico UFO crash andretrieval:· 10/20/2004 -- Pollok, Texas \"Chupa\": Strange Mammal or Mangy Coyote?· 08/18/2004 -- New Mexico Gov.
