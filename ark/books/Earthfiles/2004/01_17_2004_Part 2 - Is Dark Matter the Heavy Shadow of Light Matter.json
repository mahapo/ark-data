January 17, 2004 Urbana-Champaign, Illinois - Not everyone is certain thatSupersymmetry of super atomic particles is the answer to Dark Matter. In fact,some theoretical physicists argue about whether the Brookhaven muon magneticmoment measurement is even a meaningful discrepancy.One physicist has specialized in precision measurements of the muon calculationin order to look for problems in the Standard Model that physicists currentlythink explains most atomic particle characteristics and interactions. He is DavidHertzog, Professor of Physics in the Loomis Laboratory of Physics at theUniversity of Illinois/Urbana-Champaign campus in Urbana.This week I asked him if he thinks the muon magnetic moment calculation tendsto support Supersymmetry's theory that Dark Matter is causing the discrepancyin the muon measurement.Interview:David Hertzog, Ph.D., Professor of Physics, Loomis Laboratory of Physics,University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois: \"I believe youwill get many people who think there is a link there. But I wouldn't be able tomake that step myself. When people say, 'Ah, these guys have measuredsomething different from the Standard Model with their muon measurement,'then there is actually lots of possible scenarios of what it could be. Amongthose, some of the popular ones are Supersymmetry and regarding that theorythere are some who believe it is related to the cold, dark matter.IF IT WERE SUBSTANTIATED THAT THE LINK BETWEEN THEDIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MUON MAGNETIC ATTRACTION DIDHAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH DARK MATTER THAT MAKES UP SOMUCH OF THE UNIVERSE, WHAT WOULD THE IMPLICATION BE FOR"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"PHYSICS?That would be grand! If when the big colliders open up their ability to makedirect searches, they can then artificially produce the particles we are discussingright now. Then they can catalog them, find out what properties there are, howdo they decay, what are the families. They will be able to find out how manyexist and if this model of Supersymmetry or something else is in fact correct.There will be an explosion possibly of new particles being found and atremendous amount of interest. It's sort of like peeling out another layer of theonion in the basic building blocks of matter.I THINK IT'S DR. KANE AT THE UNIV. OF MICHIGAN WHO THINKS THEIMPLICATION OF THIS WORK IS THAT THE UNSEEN PARTICLES AREMUCH HEAVIER THAN THE PROTONS IN OUR VISIBLE UNIVERSE.The ones we are looking at would be 300 times heavier or so than the proton.Indeed, the mass or scale that would affect the muon anomaly the way we'reseeing it is pretty heavy indeed.IT'S PUZZLING TO REALIZE THAT WE ARE IN ONLY ABOUT 4% OF THEKNOWN UNIVERSE IN THE PHOTON MATTER WORLDS THAT WE SEE.THE DARK MATTER TAKES UP MUCH MORE. ISN'T THAT IMPLICATIONTHAT THE PARTICLES THAT ARE UNSEEN ARE HEAVIER THAN THEUNIVERSE THAT WE SEE?I'm just as shocked by this as you are. The fact that we have identified in the lastfew years rather precisely the various divisions of particles and dark matter anddark energy in the universe and we're such a small fraction (of it all), I keepsaying to my colleagues, 'What have we been busy doing? We're missingeverything here! We're spending all of our time on just a small fraction of it!'So, yeah, it's sort of an exciting thing to think about cracking the bigger problem.Now, with regard to your question, 'Doesn't it mean the Dark Matter is allheavier?' Well, it can be lighter, as well. It simply has to be a combination ofhow many things out there we're not looking at times their mass.The excitement of the last few years about neutrinos having mass has similarlygenerated feeling like, 'Ah ha! Now we've solved some of the mass problem inthe universe as well.' So, it's a matter of how many things are out there and howmuch they weigh.BUT IT IS ODD AND PUZZLING, ISN'T IT, THAT WE ARE LIVING IN AUNIVERSE IN WHICH SO MUCH OF IT IS UNSEEN?I think so! I think that's a little odd and puzzling, too! But we're able to see andperceive matter in sort of interesting and limited ways as well. The matter that'sout there certainly affects the whole growth of the universe. In that sense, we areperceiving it very well. But in the sense of viewing it, we don't view it. We wouldlove to be able to create this stuff directly. First of all, the indirect views andexperiments like ours are going to be a good hint. But if you can come alongwith a big atom smashing accelerator and directly produce these things, thenyou've really got the proof. Can Bigger Atom Smashing Accelerators Find Dark Matter?WHEN THE NEW ACCELERATORS COME ON LINE AND YOU MIGHTBE ABLE TO GENERATE SOME OF THESE DARK MATTER PARTICLES,WILL THAT HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW THIS UNIVERSE CAME TOBE IN SOME WAY?If you were building an object out of Lego blocks and you were missing half ofthem, half of the types and shapes and colors and so on, you wouldn't have thewhole set of what could be made. So what we're trying to do is basically find allthe constituents of matter. The elementary building blocks. That's satisfying in"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"itself, Step One.And sure, if you are asking is there greater understanding of how the universeevolved from all that, of course there will be. It depends on how easy this is andhow prolific the finds are. If it's a big harvest of particles and all the theoriesmake sense? Or when we start finding particles, do we have to throw out thewhole idea of Supersymmetry and substitute it with something different? Sountil we know what we've got, it's going to be hard to speculate too much,except for the fact that when we find these things, we know that will help usunderstand.LET'S SAY WE'RE AT THE TIME WHEN THE CERN LARGE HADRONCOLLIDER (LHC) IS UP AND RUNNING AND THEY ARE ABLE TO FINDTHESE HEAVY HYPOTHESIZED PARTICLES THAT THEY THINK AREMAKING UP THE DARK MATTER. WHAT THEN ABOUT OUR VIEW OFPHYSICS IN THE UNIVERSE?OK, I think that would be an outstanding find. That would be a spectacular probably the most spectacular find in my science career would be such a thingthat you are proposing. If we could really find a set of particles and could becoupled to the Dark Matter directly, what a spectacular sort of hand shakebetween theoretical astrophysics, all of the observations of the universe and thenthe laboratory measurements with subatomic particles all tied together. It's awonderful it would be a wonderful step.It really would make us re-write a lot of the particle physics textbooks from thebeginning in a sense.WOULD IT SOLVE ANY PARTICULAR COSMIC MYSTERY IF WE KNEWFOR A FACT THAT THERE WERE ALL THESE OTHER INVISIBLEPARTICLES THAT COULD BE MEASURED?Certainly this whole question of what is the Dark Matter is just driving peoplecrazy right now. We want to know what it is. Now that we have all these resultswhich predict the ratios of matter and energy in the universe, we sure as heck area little embarrassed to be dealing with only about 4 to 5 percent of it. So, yeah,if we could solve that one, that would chip off another big thing. Then we'd onlyhave the voodoo world of Dark Energy to discuss.THE MEASUREMENT OF THE MUONS MIGHT BE THE FIRST BIG STEPTO SETTLING WHAT THE DARK MATTER MIGHT BE?I'd call it the first tiny step. I prefer the 'first tiny step,' rather than the 'first bigstep.' We're doing, we're just giving a hint of something that might be out there.And if it eventually turns out to be connected to our measurement in reverse,that would be just swell and grand! But there is no way our measurement cansay it is the Dark Matter which affects the muon spin. We can only say thatsomething does.\"More Information:Belle Discovers a New Particle- new type of meson? -November 14, 2003High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK)An international team of researchers at the High Energy Accelerator Researchorganization (KEK) in Tsukuba recently announced the discovery of a new andunusual sub-atomic particle. This particle, which the researchers are calling theX(3872), weighs about the same as a single atom of helium and exists for onlyabout one billionth of a trillionth of a second before it decays to other longer-lived, more familiar particles. Although extremely short-lived by any humanstandard, this is nearly an eternity for a sub-atomic particle this heavy."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The new particle was found among the decay products of so-called beautymesons that are produced in large numbers at the KEKB \"B-factory,\" anelectron-positron collider at the KEK laboratory that is specialized forproducing large numbers of particles that contain a b (\"beauty\") quark. Therethe \"Belle collaboration,\" an international team of faculty and studentresearchers from Universities and laboratories from eleven different countries,operate of the Belle detector, which is tailored to study the particles produced atKEKB. Belle is a complex assortment of highly sensitive radiation detectorslocated inside of a large superconducting electromagnet, The device took nearlyten years to design and build.While investigating various ways the B-mesons (particles that contain a b quark)decay, the Belle team observed that they can decay into X(3872) and K-mesonalthough its occurrence is extremely rare. The X(3872) almost instantly decaysinto a ``J-psi'' particle and two pi-mesons. (Figures)There are hundreds of sub-atomic particles and the discovery of a new one isusually not an extraordinary event. However, as its name implies, the X(3872)particle is peculiar in that it does not easily fit into any known particle schemeand, as a result, has attracted a considerable amount of attention from theworld's physics community. The Belle discovery was recently confirmed byresearchers with the CDF experiment at the Fermi National AcceleratorLaboratory in Illinois, home of the Tevatron, the world's largest atom smasher.There the X(3872) is referred to as the \"mystery meson.\"A normal \"meson\" particle is comprised of a quark and an antiquark that areheld together by the \"color\" force, also called as \"strong\" force because it is themost powerful force in nature. The large variety of meson particles that havebeen found to date reflect the many different ways that these combinations canbe accomplished. However, the mass and the decay properties of the X(3872) donot match theoretical expectations for any conceivable quark-antiquarkarrangement.Theoretical physicists around the world are considering a number of potentialexplanations. These include modifications to the theory of the color force, or thepossibility that the X(3872) is the first example to be seen of a new type ofmeson, one that is made from four quarks (i.e. two quarks and two antiquarks).The discovery is described in a report published in this week's edition ofPhysical Review Letters, a prestigious journal for physics research.We b s it e :http://pdg.web.cern.ch/pdg/cpep/adventure_home.htmlhttp://belle.kek.jp/http://public.web.cern.ch/public/about/future/future.htmlCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
