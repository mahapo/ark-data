With firsthand facts and photos, the big story wasreleased and then, presto! squashed. In one case in 1952, a New York daily newspaper headlined a crash story in its\"bulldog\" or 9 PM edition. Copies were delivered as usual to newsstands, thefirst loads going to a neighborhood in the Bronx. Official reaction was swift.Agents, thought to be the FBI, took the remaining copies at the newsstands andmade a door-to-door sweep in all the nearby apartments to round-up any of thebulldog strays. \"Most of the copy about the crash, I've forgotten,\" lamented Robert. \"I doremember that three bodies were recovered: two were dead, one injured, stillalive. The crash site, too, is not clear. I believe it occurred in New Mexico orArizona because the terrain was sandy like a desert.\" Also, the name of the newspaper is disputed. Joe thought it was The DailyNews. Robert thought it was The Daily Mirror. \"Both formats were similar,\"said Robert. But most of the key questions might never be answered. Probablyall the copies of the bulldog edition were confiscated, either on arrival at thenewsstands or earlier at the newspaper offices and distribution center. I alsowonder if the source of the story was UPI or AP news wire services and if so,what happened at the various other media nationally? Or, was it an independentscoop? Whatever the case, it was a matter of national security to squash a UFOcrash/retrieval incident. Other early examples of a submissive media to UFO censorship were publishedin my Status Report III, UFO Crash/Retrievals: Amassing the Evidence. One,occurring the same year, 1952, as in the Oliveri case, was reported by RichardHall, then editor of the MUFON UFO Journal at the Fifth Annual MufonConference in 1981. Said Hall, \"I personally heard a radio news report about acrashed saucer and occupants - one said to be still alive - about 1952, while Iwas working in a general store. Being young and naive in those days, I madelittle effort to document the story beyond listening for additional news onfollowing newscasts, which of course, never came. I should have called the radiostation, talked with the wire service persons, checked newspapers in a libraryand so on. Since I didn't, the story remains only an interesting anecdote.\" In 1980, George Fawcett, veteran researcher in Lincolnton, North Carolina, gaveme the name of Leon Crice to call who distinctly remembers TV StationWDEL-N, Wilmington, Delaware, being cut off the air when showing a newsreelabout a crashed UFO. I called Crice in April 1980 and quote part of his storyhere that was published in Status Report III: \"It was about 1948,\" he said,\"when my wife and I were watching the news on our new TV set that adisc-shaped object was shown stuck, slightly tilted, in a sand dune. It had a"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"dome at the top and no windows,\" adding, \"I recall that the narrator said that itcrashed on the Mexican border near the Rio Grande (river).\" As the film rolled,Crice said, it clearly showed soldiers moving around the object and in thebackground were jeeps, a low-boy rig and crane and some Mexicans watching.\"He also remembers that when the narrator mentioned bodies being recoveredand that the craft had been shipped to an air base in California, his voice was cutoff and the TV screen went black. There was no station apology and secondslater, the news continued on another subject. Then there remains the unsolved mystery about an issue of a popular magazinein 1948 that published an exclusive story about a crash incident - with photo -and, lo and behold, it vanished. Well, almost vanished, except for a few copiesthat slipped into the hands of researchers. At first, claimants said they had\"seen\" the ill-fated story in the Coronet. But none was able to furnish a copy.Unfortunately, this story of confiscation was published in Status Report IIIwhich evoked a lot of interest. As a result, many dedicated researchers spentconsiderable time in libraries hoping to find the prodigal issue. Their search wasfutile. Then from out of the woodwork, other deep-throaters surfaced with a new twist.They contended that the expose was not in Coronet, but in Pageant. Of course,it is possible that Coronet and Pageant did actually publish the taboo UFOcrash story and were forced to make a hasty replacement. In that event, all thepublic and academic libraries would have the corrected issue. But to balance outall the claims that postulate censorship and confiscation, I question the Coronetor Pageant case. Probably the most brazen incident of censorship happened in January 1957when the voice of NICAP's Donald Keyhoe, appearing live on CBS-TV'sArmstrong Circle Theater was cut off the air before a large national audience.Pitted against the Air Force's Spencer Whedon, Chief of the Air TechnicalIntelligence Command's Information Services, Keyhoe had deviated from theprepared script advocating a Congressional investigation to look into the UFOcover-up. I watched the TV program and the unbelievable sight of Keyhoe's lips movingwithout sound. For the record, I had interviewed Whedon in August 1957, at hisATIC office in Wright-Patterson AFB. He was a tough, unbending anti-UFOspokesman with a booming voice. My interview was published in Inside SaucerPost 3-0 Blue. In spite of all the negativism, Keyhoe stood his ground, undaunted until hisdeath, maintaining that UFOs were \"interplanetary\" - the word used in the earlydays - and that the public was being deceived by officialdom's \"silence group.\" The Clovis Crash Conundrum A large \"something\" crashed near Clovis, New Mexico in 1957, a year whenUFO activity nationally was moderate to heavy depending on geography. It wasalso the year of Sputnik and feverish U. S. experiments to catch up with theRussian space exploits. For me, it was the last of a three-year stint of working incooperation with the Air Defense Command screening and reporting to themthrough a coded phone system the UFO activity that I received \"live\" from policedepartments, sheriff's offices, the media and public percipients. In this capacity -and in spite of being advised that any Air Force counteraction once a UFO wasconfirmed became \"classified\" - I still got \"privileged\" or off-the-cuff informationof intercept missions. UFOs were serious business in 1957. Although Clovis is well beyond the rocket and missile test ranges, its generallocale cannot be ruled out that it was safe from incidents when an experimentaldevice failed and strayed off its prescribed course. Clovis was not immune to thepervasive UFO either. I remember shortly after I stopped publishing my monthlynewsletter, Orbit, in March 1957, that I got a call from a man aware of mypublication who claimed that he and his wife had seen a domed disc land at"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"dusk in a rural Clovis schoolyard. Although my notes detailing the case are lost,the schoolyard factor stands out because such incidents were occurringfrequently nationwide. Continuing through the years, I expressed my concern forthe selective schoolyard target and made reference to this syndrome in my book,Situation Red: The UFO Siege, published twenty years after the Clovisincident. Frankly, based on reports I received in the 1950s, anything with orwithout a U. S. identification could have landed or crashed anywhere in thebusy hub of New Mexico. The 1957 crash incident, based on information that researcher Debbie Valerio ofMansfield, Ohio, got from her source, Jake, was published in Ohio UFONotebook in July 1993, edited by William Jones, Director of Mid-Ohio ResearchAssociates in Dublin, Ohio. Later, Debbie and a co-researcher, Berta, visited mein Cincinnati to relate additional details and brought me a sample of theretrieved metal taken from the scene of the crash. On August 21, I talked withJake at length and found his story essentially the same which appeared in theOhio UFO Notebook. It follows. \"Clovis, New Mexico: Another UFO Crash Site? Recently Mid-Ohio Research Associates (MORA) investigators intervieweda man we shall give the pseudonym, Jake. Jake served in the United StatesArmy/Air Force from 1951 through 1960. At the time of his experiencenear Clovis, New Mexico, he was a Master Sergeant serving as a crew chiefon fighter aircraft. He was on leave, traveling with two Air Force buddiesfrom Kansas into New Mexico. They had no particular destination in mind;they just wanted to get away from work for awhile. The specific timeperiod involved is uncertain, but it was in July or August of either 1957 or1958. They had heard rumors about a crash of some kind in New Mexico shortlybefore going on leave, mostly from pilots who had flown over the reportedsite. There was speculation among these returning pilots that the crash wasunusual because no tail section could be seen among the wreckage. When they left on their trip, starting from McConnell Air Force Base inWichita, Kansas, they did not set out in an attempt to find the site. But asthey got into western Texas, they began to hear further rumors about thecrash as they talked to people they met along the way. So, they decided tosee if they could find out more. The site, as best as Jake can remember, was 30 to 35 miles southwest ofClovis. It was on a ranch. They found the site rather easily, first locating acouple of military vehicles out on the highway and then following them in.They encountered no road blocks. When they arrived at the site, on a dirtroad just off a small two lane paved road out in the country, they noticed anumber of military vehicles parked near the top of a small rise. Includedwere a number of jeeps and trucks, a Buick staff car (one of the vehiclesthey had followed), a C-2 wrecker and two or three 0-10 fire trucks. Sincethe area was supposedly an aircraft crash site, Jake thought it was strangethat no ambulances were there. He stated that ambulances are usually keptnear aircraft crash sites, even after bodies are removed, in case they areneeded for the treatment of injuries incurred during the investigation andcleanup process. Jake and his friends were spotted soon after they arrived since they were ina civilian car and wore no uniforms. However, just before this occurred,one of his friends noticed a small piece of material on the ground which hepicked up. The material was grayish-charcoal in color. It was oddly shaped andslightly bent, but it had not been broken. It was approximately 18 incheslong, 10 to 12 inches wide and 5/16 of an inch thick. He remarked that it"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"was the same color all of the way through. It was light in weight, perhaps 3to 4 ounces. Neither of the three had ever seen any material like it. Thefriend scraped the material on a rock which created a scratch on thematerial's surface. An Air Police officer came up and demanded that they put the piece backwhere they had found it. Jake's friend threw it to the ground. It hit a rock.The sound this made was not metallic, but more of a light thud. The policeofficer told the friend to pick it back up and place it back where it wasoriginally found. This he did. The officer then demanded to know whothey were. When they identified themselves, they were told to leave thearea immediately. Several other Air Force personnel had come up to them at this point, onebeing a 'full bird colonel.' This individual ordered them, 'What you seehere, you forget.' They got back in their car and left the area. The AirPolice followed them for some distance. The three never did identify what had crashed. There were small pieces ofwreckage around the area and ground marks that indicated that somethinglarge had impacted in the area, possibly having gone over the small rise inthe land. The sparse bushes and trees in the area had been crushed anddisturbed and a telephone pole near the road was broken off. Scuttlebutt, picked up both before they arrived on site and later, led themto conclude that the crash had occurred perhaps 3 to 5 days before, but theinspection team had arrived within less than twenty-four hours before theirarrival. Neither Jake nor his friends were ever approached later about the event.They never saw the crash referred to in the newspapers. The rumorsaround their base about the event died out soon thereafter and that iswhere the story ends. This event cannot be identified as a crashed UFO, but is clear both fromwhat Jake and his friends had observed and heard that a crash of some typeof aircraft had occurred and it was apparently being treated somewhatdifferently from a regular plane crash. Unless more is learned from othersources, this is all that can be said about the incident.\" To be continued in Part 8.Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
