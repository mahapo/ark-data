Levengood's Crop Circle ReportsAvailable for First Time On Internet© 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist, in his Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory,Grass Lake, Michigan. Photograph by Linda Moulton Howe. May 24, 2004 Grass Lake, Michigan - Biophysicist W. C. Levengood is convinced thatwhatever causes the crop circle phenomenon uses a rapid and intense energy whichproduces cell changes in affected plants. By the summer of 2000, Levengood had studiedplants from at least three hundred crop formations in Israel, Australia, Canada, the UnitedStates, England and Holland. He found a repeating pattern of biochemical and biophysicalchanges in formation plants and magnetic anomalies in soils which lead him to concludethat what was interacting with crop formation plants and soil was 'a spinning plasmavortex.' But what was creating the vortices? Now, American crop formation investigator Jeffrey Wilson and cropcirclenews.com arescanning nearly two hundred of biophysicist Levengood's original Pinelandia Lab reportsabout biochemical and biophysical changes Levengood has studied in the plants and soil ofgenuinely mysterious crop patterns. To study Levengood's work as it is scanned and archived, go to Cropcirclenews.com .This section is for articles provided by Mr. Levengood, copied by Dr. Charles Lietzau andJeffrey Wilson, and scanned by Gene Thomas. The following is an excerpt about W. C. Levengood's crop circle research from my book,Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles. \"Scientific Evidence That Cannot Be Hoaxed Biophysicist Levengood has analyzed hundreds and hundreds of plants from cropformations in his own curiosity about what unusual energies are interacting with theplants to produce some of the biochemical and biophysical changes he has confirmedin his laboratory. In his own words, he says that 'a spinning plasma vortex with amicrowave component and complex lower energy ion-electron pulses' haveinteracted with many formation plants he has studied. He also asserts that the energy interaction that creates formations must occur rapidly,in a few seconds. Otherwise, he would find evidence of burning or charring from themicrowave heating. But he does not find such damage, and the formation plantscontinue to live and grow until harvest."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Those biochemical and biophysical changes that Levengood has documented includea combination of swollen and reoriented growth nodes, ruptured growth nodes,metabolism changes in plant cells and magnetic iron particles deposited over theplant surfaces and surrounding soil. Levengood published his research in a 1999 international journal, PhysiologiaPlantarum (105:615-624). He wrote, 'The findings reported here lend further supportto a decade of research with empirical data which suggests that over 95% ofworldwide crop formations (he has studied) involve organized ion plasma vorticesthat deliver lower atmosphere energy components of sufficient magnitude to producesignificant bending, expansion and formation of unique expulsion cavities in plantstem pulvini (swelling at base of leaf stalk), as well as significant changes in seedlingdevelopment.'

The Blue Ball, Maryland plants from 1995 averaged 130% to 200% node lengtheningand dramatic reorientation from the normal straight vertical. The cause is thought tobe rapid heating and expansion by microwave energies which collapse the cell tissuein the upper nodes and produce the angled reorientation. Nodes on wheat stems closer to the ground have tougher, more mature tissue.Levengood thinks that water-cell components in those lower growth nodes build uppressure and, like safety valves, literally burst open to create what he calls 'expulsioncavities.' Sixty-five to eighty-five percent of the Blue Ball, Maryland wheatformation plants contained expulsion cavities, while none were found in the controlplants from outside the downed crop. The photographs below show an excellent contrast between four exploded growthnodes from a wheat formation in Logan, Utah in August 1996, compared to normalcontrol plants.

'There is no way that wind or air motion from a helicopter or pressure from boards,feet or string could produce these biochemical and biophysical changes,' Levengoodsaid. 'The plants have been affected by an intense energy.' In addition to these fundamental biophysical and biochemical changes in the wheatplant themselves, Levengood has also studied plants from England and the UnitedStates that have been coated with a deposit of iron oxide, hematite and magnetite,that he believes are fused particles of meteoritic origin. Cherhill, Wiltshire, England, 1993. Semi-molten magnetic irondeposited on wheat leaf and shows imprint of leaf's epidermal cell structure.Photograph © 1993 by W. C. Levengood. ... Over 70% of approximately forty crop formations Levengood has investigatedwith magnet drags turn up iron deposits on the surface of the soil. ...Levengood hasfound high concentrations of magnetic iron in many crop formations, occasionallymore than 700 times higher concentrations than the normal 0.4 milligrams ofmagnetite per gram of soil. Further, soil samples continue to confirm distribution (ofthe magnetite) by centrifugal spinning force.\" Biophysicist Levengood contemplates past research about the known natural forces ofspiral auroras which originate in spiral electric fields of the magnetosphere and map downalong geomagnetic field lines into the ionosphere. Then he wonders if such spiral electricfields in the magnetosphere could be linked to whatever force interacts with cereal cropsaround the world to create geometric and other patterns. \"Is it possible that a pair of these downward directed, counterclockwise plasmavortices intersected and captured meteoric dust along the way, which in turn, wasmaintained or heated back to a semi-molten state by the microwaves of sub-vorticeswhich carried it to the ground with its subsequent crop flattening energies? If so, thiswould indicate a heretofore unknown phenomenon of ionospheric plasma vorticesdescending to the Earth's surface.\" More Information: William C. Levengood received his B. S. in Physics and Mathematics from the Universityof Toledo, Ohio in 1957; M. A. Bioscience, Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana, 1961;M. S. in Biophysics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1970 and completedall work for Ph.D. in Biophysics at the University of Michigan, except final thesis review.He worked as an Associate Research Physicist at the University of Michigan from 1961 to1968 and was Director of Biophysical Research Sensors, Inc., in Ann Arbor from 1970 to1976. W. C. Levengood holds nearly a dozen patents, including seed analyzers and growthenhancement technology. From 1976 to 1983, Levengood owned Agro Sciences, Inc., inAnn Arbor. Since 1987, he has worked independently in his Grass Lake, MichiganPinelandia Biophysical Laboratory, contributing greatly to better understanding physicalevidence in the crop formation and animal mutilation phenomena.
