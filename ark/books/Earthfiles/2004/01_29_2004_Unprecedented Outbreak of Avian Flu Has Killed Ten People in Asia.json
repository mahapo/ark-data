Photo © 2004 byAP. January 29, 2004 London, England - The World Health Organization'sDirector of the Influenza Collaborating Centre, Alan Hay, said this week, \"Theextent of this (avian flu) outbreak is unprecedented.\" It is also virulent andjumping from birds to humans. The big medical fear is: What happens if theavian virus begins jumping from human to human? How fast and far could itspread? The worry is warranted. SARS in 2003 was also a virus that jumpedfrom animals to humans and began spreading and killing rapidly.On this date, Health Canada's public health reporter, Andre Picard, wrote:\"If avian flu becomes pandemic, as many public-health officials fear, itcould kill as many as 58,000 people in Canada alone. As part of a detailedpandemic preparedness plan, epidemiologists estimate that a new strain ofinfluenza, such as one that jumps from birds to humans, could kill 11,000to 58,000 Canadians in a matter of weeks. \"Those hardest hit would likely be young children and the old, whoseimmune systems are least able to fight off infection. The disease could alsoput 35,000 to 138,000 people in hospital and leave between 4.5 millionand 10.6 million others too sick to work, which could have a devastatingeconomic impact.\" Dr. Alan Hay in London and his W.H.O. colleagues in Geneva are warning thatthe number of domestic birds that now must be eliminated to control theepidemic of avian influenza spreading through Asia will be the largest on record.Ten people have died so far in the virus jump from birds into humans. Thosedeaths were in Vietnam and Thailand. China became the tenth nation to confirm that the avian virus, known medicallyas H5N1, has infected its bird population. That was in a duck farm in Guan-giprovince. This is a major blow after the SARS outbreak last year. Chicken is astaple meat for China's 1.3 billion people and China is the third largest supplier"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"of chicken to Japan. However, Japan immediately banned Chinese chickenimports until the avian flu can be stopped. Chinese officials called for a quarantine around the duck farm in Dingdangwhere 14,000 birds were killed. Other farms within three miles of the duck farmwere also quarantined. The official news agency, Xin-hua, reported: \"Localgovernments have made necessary measures of slaughter or quarantine toprevent a spread. No people have been found infected so far and the epidemichas been in control.\" But until the Chinese government knows how and where the ducks wereinfected, it won't have a firm control on the deadly disease's spread. Animalsmuggling for profit is a big business in Asia and no one, so far, has an answerabout how to detect and stop the illegal trades that could involve virus-infectedbirds, civets and other creatures.More Information:W.H.O. warned this month that avian influenza, or bird flu, could be a moreserious health problem this year than what happened with SARS in 2003.W.H.O. Questions and Answers:Are the avian flu and SARS related?No. SARS is caused by a coronavirus, similar to one of the types of virus thatcauses the common cold. Avian flu is caused by an influenza virus. However,the source of both the SARS coronavirus and the influenza viruses were animalsand the viruses \"jumped\" into humans.What are the symptoms?Fever, fatigue, cough and sore throat.How does avian flu spread?Human contact with the droppings of infected birds. In two Hong Kongoutbreaks, investigators found poor sanitation and slaughtering practices atoutdoor poultry markets close to housing areas.Where did avian flu come from?Wild birds are affected by a large number of flu viruses, just as humans andother animals are, but avian flu has usually remained in the bird population. Thefirst case of a person dying from avian flu was reported in Hong Kong in May1997. Prior to that case, avian influenza in humans usually caused only mildsymptoms such as pink eye. That means the virus has mutated some how tobecome more virulent now. So far, three subtypes of the influenza A virus H5N1, H9N2 and H7N7 have jumped the species barrier between birds andhumans.We b s it e : http://www.who.int/en/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
