February 3, 2004 Paris, France - The Hubble European Space AgencyInformation Centre has just released the following news:\"The well-known extrasolar planet HD 209458b, provisionally nicknamedOsiris, has surprised astronomers again. Oxygen and carbon have beenfound in its atmosphere, evaporating at such an immense rate that theexistence of a new class of extrasolar planets 'the chthonian planets' or'dead' cores of completely evaporated gas giants - has been proposed. Oxygen and carbon have been detected in the atmosphere of a planetbeyond our Solar System for the first time. Scientists using the NASA/ESAHubble Space Telescope have observed the famous extrasolar planet HD209458b passing in front of its parent star, and found oxygen and carbonsurrounding the planet in an extended ellipsoidal envelope - the shape of arugby-ball. These atoms are swept up from the lower atmosphere with theflow of the escaping atmospheric atomic hydrogen, like dust in asupersonic whirlwind. The team led by Alfred Vidal-Madjar (Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris,CNRS, France) reports this discovery in a forthcoming issue ofAstrophysical Journal Letters. The planet, called HD 209458b, may sound familiar. It is already anextrasolar planet with an astounding list of firsts: the first extrasolar planet"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"discovered transiting its sun, the first with an atmosphere, the first observedto have an evaporating hydrogen atmosphere (in 2003 by the same team ofscientists) and now the first to have an atmosphere containing oxygen andcarbon. Furthermore the 'blow-off' effect observed by the team during theirOctober and November 2003 observations with Hubble had never beenseen before. In honour of such a distinguished catalogue this extraordinary extrasolarplanet has provisionally been dubbed \"Osiris\". Osiris is the Egyptian godwho lost part of his body like HD 209458b - after his brother killed andcut him into pieces to prevent his return to life.Oxygen is one of the possible indicators of life that is often looked for inexperiments searching for extraterrestrial life (such as those onboard theViking probes and the Spirit and Opportunity rovers), but according toVidal-Madjar: 'Naturally this sounds exciting - the possibility of life onOsiris - but it is not a big surprise as oxygen is also present in the giantplanets of our Solar System, like Jupiter and Saturn.' What, on the other hand was surprising was to find the carbon and oxygenatoms surrounding the planet in an extended envelope. Although carbonand oxygen have been observed on Jupiter and Saturn, it is always incombined form as methane and water deep in the atmosphere. In HD209458b the chemicals are broken down into the basic elements. But onJupiter or Saturn, even as elements, they would still remain invisible low inthe atmosphere. The fact that they are visible in the upper atmosphere ofHD 209458b confirms that atmospheric 'blow off' is occurring.The scorched Osiris orbits 'only' 7 million kilometres from its yellowSun-like star and its surface is heated to about 1,000 degrees Celsius(1,832 Fahrenheit).Whereas hydrogen is a very light element - the lightest in fact - oxygen andcarbon are much heavier in comparison. This has enabled scientists toconclude that this phenomenon is more efficient than simple evaporation.The gas is essentially ripped away at a speed of more than 35,000 km/hour(21,753 mph). 'We speculate that even heavier elements such as iron are blown off at thisstage as well,' says team member Alain Lecavelier des Etangs, Institutd'Astrophysique de Paris, CNRS, France. The whole evaporation mechanism is so distinctive that there is reason topropose the existence of a new class of extrasolar planets - the chthonianplanets, a reference to the Greek God Khtôn, used for Greek deities fromthe hot infernal underworld (also used in the French word autochton). Thechthonian planets are thought to be the solid remnant cores of 'evaporatedgas giants', orbiting even closer to their parent star than Osiris. Thedetection of these planets should soon be within reach of currenttelescopes both on the ground and in space. The discovery of the fierce evaporation process is, according to thescientists, 'highly unusual,' but may indirectly confirm theories of our ownEarth's childhood. 'This is a unique case in which such a hydrodynamic escape is directlyobserved. It has been speculated that Venus, Earth and Mars may have losttheir entire original atmospheres during the early part of their lives. Theirpresent atmospheres have their origins in asteroid and cometary impactsand outgassing from the planet interiors,' says Vidal-Madjar.\"More Information:Facts About HD 209458b from European Space AgencyDiameter: 1.3 times that of Jupiter."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Mass: 0.7 Jupiter masses, 220 Earth masses.Orbit: One-eighth the size of Mercury's orbit around the Sun (7 millionkilometres). 3.5 days.A type of extrasolar planet known as 'hot Jupiters' - Giant, gaseous planetsin low orbits.First confirmed transiting extrasolar planet.Transit: Every 3.5 days, 3 hours in duration.
