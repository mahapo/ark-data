September 22, 2004 Ellettsville, Indiana - Back on September 8, I posted an Earthfilesabout possible balls of light reported by Ted Robertson and Jeffrey Wilson of theIndependent Crop Circle Research Association's (ICCRA), who investigated theMiamisburg, Ohio formation in tall corn near the ancient Miamisburg earth mound.Included in that Earthfiles report was a geometry comparison between the 2004Miamisburg Mound, Ohio, corn formation and the 2003 Serpent Mound, Ohio, soybeanpattern researched and drawn by Bert Janssen of The Netherlands. The similarities shownbelow are remarkable.

This week he talked with meabout why he first thought the patterns were based on different ratios and consequently,would not fit together so perfectly. But as he worked with his own diagrams, he keptmaking surprising discoveries.Interview:Physical Challenge of Making Complex Pattern in Tall CornTed Robertson, B.S., Biology (Pre-Med, Indiana University), Harpsichord Maker andField Researcher, Independent Crop Circle Research Association (ICCRA),Ellettsville, Indiana: \"My first thoughts in seeing the Miamisburg formation from theairplane is that it looked to be the general shape and design bilaterally symmetrical, a largerring, a smaller ring, a Vesica Pisces, satellite circles looked closest to Serpent Mound thanperhaps any other crop circle in the United States I have seen.The other thing that first came to my mind about Miamisburg is that this is the mostcomplex formation, geometry-wise, in tall corn that we've probably ever come across inthe world. There have been larger patterns, such as Vacaville, California, but that was sortof like a crude caterpillar with just a series of circles. So, I recognized the Vesica inMiamisburg which reminds me of the Serpent Mound.Another physical comparison, I realized, was the resolution in corn. It is more widelyspaced rows, about 30 inches apart. The plants themselves are spaced about a foot apart.So, whatever makes a small design in a corn field, it tends to look more chunky. And inMiamisburg, in fact, this crop circle looks a little bit more chunky (than Serpent Mound).The paths are wider than Serpent Mound. In Serpent Mound being in soybeans with veryclosely spaced plants, you get a higher resolution in the 'artistic canvas.' In Serpent Mound,it is a much more elegant design very fine pathways and thinly spaced rings and crescentswith a lot more detail possible.Another big problem for whatever created the Miamisburg formation is the height of thecorn. Miamisburg has standing centers, multiple crescents and other standing internalelements as well as downed plants. The height of the corn makes viewing other parts of thecorn design difficult. When I first got in there even though I saw it first from the air it wasdifficult to know exactly which circle I was in and what part of the formation and to get anoverall picture of what the design looked like. It is a rather complex design and verycompact.Also, corn is tough and it takes more energy to down than say, wheat, or other smallerplants. (Biophysicist W. C. Levengood measured 17 times more energy to break corn stalkfibers versus wheat or barley. (See 09-05-04Earthfiles).Also, to measure the formation in mature corn, the standing centers must be taken intoaccount and it is rather difficult to maintain accurate measurements through the standingcrop especially very large measurements through multiple areas of standing crop as thetape must be threaded through the standing plants all the while trying to maintain a straightline of measurement. The largest circle single elements in the Miamisburg formation has adiameter of about 122 feet. That's a rather large distance.Also, after a few rows have been navigated, the standing corn blocks the view of thestarting place. Also, if one were to hoax a formation in corn, the ropes used or tapemeasures might have to be suspended above the tops of the corn which can be 7 to 8 feettall. If that's used as a radius, the poles would have to have considerable tension for thelarge circles to keep the line taut over the top which is rather difficult. In this formationwith its smooth curves, its large standing elements and accurate circles, making this with arope or tape measure would be very difficult to do. Once the corn is flattened by mistake,it cannot be made to stand up again.YOUR POINT IS THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR ANYONE IN 8-FOOT-TALLCORN TO MANUALLY MAKE SUCH A LARGE, COMPLEX CIRCLE.That's right, because usually people walk around with stomping boards to create thediameter and it would have to brush along the tops of the plants. Someone would have tostand in the center and hold it. Not only that, there are places in the Miamisburg formationthat taper down to I wouldn't say a single standing plant, but only about six plants wide sortof like a veil effect.Then, there aren't that many mistakes, which really threw me for the geometry analysis. Miamisburg, Ohio, Corn Formation Geometry"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"When Bert Janssen first put out his diagram, I thought, 'How could that be?' I checked andI didn't get what he got. I was convinced there was a 2:1 ratio going on, alternating with a3:2 ratio. What that means is that the Serpent Mound has near a 4:3 ratio of the outer circleto the inner circle you know the large crescent? That is a 4:3 ratio, so I could notunderstand how there could be a nearly perfect match between Miamisburg and SerpentMound.What I think is going on are basically two things which are rather enigmatic about thelayout of this Miamisburg crop circle. If you notice in the aerial view, there are two circlesthat create the Vesica Pisces. The one that is toward the narrow part of the formationwhich is closest to the Miamisburg Mound that has been flattened while the other one hasbeen left standing. In either one, they both have a circular element which is half thediameter approximately. In other words, the circle that creates the Vesica on the top, ornarrow part of the formation, is actually smaller than the circle that creates the other halfof the Vesica Pisces in the standing formation. And the ratio of the smaller circle is exactly as far as I can tell a 3:2 ratio compared to the outer ring. Whereas the standing one is 3:4ratio. Miamisburg, Ohio, Orange Pattern SuperimposedOn Aerial of Serpent Mound Aerial PhotographTHAT'S WHERE YOU COME INTO SOME KIND OF SYNCHRONICITY WITH THESERPENT MOUND OF 2003?Exactly! It's almost like that ring was put there almost exactly like Serpent Mound, maybeto give a continuity over the years, or some significance like instant recognition."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Ted Robertson's orange diagram of the 2004 Miamisburg, Ohio, corn formationsuperimposed over aerial photograph of 2003 Serpent Mound formation in soybeans.Aerial photograph © 2003 by Chris Steele.I also discovered that the two satellite circles (Miamisburg) there is one at the tip of theformation and another out in the field at the other end those happen to be a 3:4 ratio aswell. That means the smallest elements of the crop formation and the two largest elementsin this crop formation are both 3:4 ratios.WHICH RESONATES WITH SERPENT MOUND 2003.That's right. Serpent Mound was very complex and slightly less than a 3:4 ratio.THEN YOU HAVE THE COMPLEXITY THAT THE REST OF MIAMISBURG IS A 2:3RATIO.That's right. In addition, it's also has an element in a 1:2 ratio which is what anothergeometry researcher calls a 'yin yang' fractal.

It's apicture that's worth perhaps a thousand words. It is so elegant that it might inspire others touse it as a starting point for further research on the geometry.IF YOU WERE TRYING TO SUM UP FOR A GENERAL AUDIENCE WHAT SOMEKIND OF INTELLIGENCE, WHATEVER IT IS, THAT MADE SERPENT MOUND 2003AND MIAMISBURG, OHIO 2004 AND YOU WERE TRYING TO LOOK AT THEMATHEMATICAL RATIOS OF THE GEOMETRIES IN THOSE TWO PATTERNS SEPARATED BY ONE YEAR - WHAT COULD YOU SAY THAT YOU THINK ARETHE MOST IMPORTANT CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE TWO?In the geometries, that outer ring with crescents in both of them is almost a dead ringer. It'sthe largest connection. The similarities between Miamisburg and Serpent Mound as far asthe outer ring is that the inner ring of the crescent is displaced forward outside it overhangsthe larger crescent in both cases for the 4:3 ratio. Geometry-wise, they both also have aVesica Pisces. They both flowed clockwise and both are aligned to mounds, the SerpentMound and Miamisburg Mound. The Miamisburg corn formation seems to miss theMiamisburg a little to the south, almost through a tangent.In his final composite comparison, Ted Robertson drew on an aerial photograph of the Miamisburg,Ohio, corn formation its geometry in red, compared to the blue geometry lines of the 2003 Serpent Mound.Geometry analysis © 2004 by Ted Robertson, ICCRA.SO, BOTH FORMATIONS A YEAR APART ARE SAYING PAY ATTENTION TO THESERPENT MOUND AND TO THE MIAMISBURG MOUND.That's right. And Bainbridge also we forget that one had one of its arms pointing to the SeipMound, also in 2003. (See: 10-02-03Earthfiles.)DIDN'T BOTH MIAMISBURG AND SERPENT MOUND HAVE THE SMALLERCIRCLES SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN FORMATION?That's right. In Serpent Mound there were 4 circles three were actually separated and oneof them had a ring around the circle. There were 4 equally spaced circles and if you drew acircle connecting all of them, they would all be tangent to that central circle which equalsthe circle creating the Vesica and crescent, too. Differences in the GeometriesTo me, the Serpent Mound geometry is highly suggestive of a seed (flower) of life pattern,the basic foundation, the underlay. Although Miamisburg has a Vesica and it does have asimilar outer crescent in a 3:4 ratio, it seems to me based more on a fractal of 1:2 and 2:3,with a 4:3 element thrown in. The Serpent Mound is not quite 4:3 in its outer ring becauseit's based on sacred geometry and is quite complex.Another anomaly in the Miamisburg formation is in the large crescent that surrounds theVesica 'eye.' The tips do not taper down equally. One tapers down to a point (on right) and"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"that tip is only three feet at its widest. The other crescent tip on the left is six feet where itcomes to point.The tips of the crescent surrounding the Vesica \"eye\" do not taper down equally.One tapers down to a point (on right) and that tip is only three feet at its widest. The other crescenttip on the left is six feet where it comes to point. Analysis © 2004 by Ted Robertson.ON PURPOSE?It's hard to think it's a mistake.WHAT COULD IT MEAN?It's like we've got two circles going on to create that circle where it tapers down. It's almostlike it might be following one circle and not the other. It's one of my blue circles and thenone of my green circles. It's like it follows both the 2:3 and 4:3 ratios. When you are inthere, you almost miss that opening because it is so narrow.Color coded ratios in 2004 Miamisburg, Ohio, corn formation © 2004 by Ted Robertson.Ted Robertson text: \"The Miamisburg 2004 formation: the isolated PINK circle atthe very top of the diagram and the isolated LIGHT BLUE circle at the bottom havea size ratio of 3:4. Likewise the ratios of the second largest circle in GREEN to thelargest circle in RED also have a ratio of 3:4. Thus, the largest and smallest elementsof the design are of identical proportion being 3:4 ratios."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" The series 1-2-3-4 can be found in the various circles sizes found in the formationthat neatly fit inside the YELLOW circles. For example, the YELLOW circlecontains two BLACK circles (ratio 2:1), three LIGHT BLUE circles (ratio 3:1) andfour of the PINK circles (ratio 4:1). Three YELLOW circles fit inside the red circlewhich gives a 3:1 ratio. The underlying framework for this crop circle is based on a Yin Yang diameterfractal of 1:2 proportions with an additional 2:3 sequences added. The 2:3 sequencescreate the largest circle outlined in RED and also the LIGHT BLUE satellite circleand its twin located in the center of the Vesica Pisces (also marked in LIGHTBLUE).The large crescent area between the RED and GREEN circles is approximately thesame shape as found in the Serpent Mound formation of 2003.\"THIS SUBTLETY SEEMS PURPOSEFUL AND THAT LEADS TO THE QUESTION:WHAT KIND OF MATHEMATICAL LANGUAGE ARE WE DEALING WITH FROMFORMATION TO FORMATION, YEAR TO YEAR?In the United States, it seems to be getting more complex as far as I can tell. I alwayswelcome surprises and evolution in the designs. It keeps it interesting. Serpent Mound wasa big step for the U. S. Clockwise Flow and Single Standing StalksThere is another interesting thing about the Serpent Mound and Miamisburg comparisonthat is almost the same. It's so subtle that it's easy to miss. I wrote this down on paper:'As I found in the Serpent Mound, everything flowed clockwise. So, if you have afigure 8, where the two circles meet at their junction in the center of the figure 8 thetop of one will be flowing in the opposite direction of the bottom of the otherbecause both circles are flowing clockwise in the path almost like a 2-lane highwaywhere they meet. Now in Serpent Mound, this tapered down to a SINGLE plant stalk around the lowerperimeter where it was next to the other circle. To me, if this were made by people,they would have to hand-bend maybe 150 plants along the diameter of the circle tocreate that effect. It was so subtle because the leaves were in the way that I did notrecognize this until essentially the plants had defoliated like soybeans do about amonth later. Even then, it was so subtle up close, you could barely recognize it.'I saw the same thing in corn in Miamisburg and that's located underneath the Vesica. It wasa single series of plants like a line of plants end to end where the Vesica tapers downbeautifully to a single corn stalk series, one after the other, and winds back up.GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.Right. Well, they are facing the opposite direction, but they are both going clockwise.Everything in this formation just like Serpent Mound is clockwise.The amazing thing, too, was there was a single stalk in the center of each of the five circlesstanding. Just isolated. Everything else goes around it unharmed.WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS ADDING UP TO, THE LINK BETWEEN SERPENTMOUND 2003 AND MIAMISBURG MOUND 2004?I think each crop circle seems to build on knowledge of the next one. I think to me it's a bigjigsaw puzzle. It's got a lot of pieces and you try to figure out an underlaying framework, tounderstand the intent of whatever made it. I tend to underestimate the complexity of thedesigns. And I'm pleasantly surprised with Serpent Mound and Miamisburg.That's why when Bert first put out his diagram, I thought it could not be. But in the end, Ithink we were both right. It's slightly I almost think the Miamisburg design was meant to betricky, almost like playing a little game on us. I think we are at the point where we haveAirplanes, we can take aerial photos, we have computers to do drawings. If we did nothave those things, it would be much more difficult to put the effort into deciphering thegeometry. Mathematical Language?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"IT IS THE GEOMETRY THAT I HAVE FELT FOR A LONG TIME AS A REPORTERTHAT IS A LANGUAGE AND WE HUMANS HAVE FAILED SO FAR TOUNDERSTAND THAT LANGUAGE THAT REPEATS FROM YEAR-TO-YEAR INSOME OF THE PATTERNS AND SEEMS TO LINK SOME PATTERNS THAT ARE 10OR 12 YEARS APART TO CURRENT ONES. IN THIS CASE, 2003 TO 2004. WHAT ISIT ABOUT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SERPENT MOUND AND THEMIAMISBURG MOUND IN OHIO THAT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT TO OUR PRESENTDAY IN WHATEVER IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CROP FORMATIONS?I definitely think that whatever they symbolize, it's showing there is an awareness anawareness of previous formations, an awareness of the mounds, an awareness of thisMiamisburg field that is surrounded by urban development and possibly the awareness ofthe high school the second one that was decided to be built there about the time theMiamisburg formation happened.A lot of people we asked how they felt in there? And they said there was a high amount ofenergy in the Miamisburg crop circle. They felt excited when they are in there I have tosay like they are on caffeine. A lot of people felt watched and restless. It's not a veryrelaxing place. But I have to say that the feeling changes and so do a lot of the odd effects.They are there one night and not there the next night. They seem to come and go.I sense a playfulness. In a way, it's a playfulness that we don't have a definite answer and itkeeps us a little bit more lighter spirited. To me, that's how I feel when I look at this.DO YOU AGREE THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH SOME KIND OF LANGUAGE INMATH?I think that's definitely true. It's hard to keep all the details straight and all the coincidencesof the ratios. Especially with Serpent Mound, it seems to be pointing out that there issomething about Sacred Geometry that holds hidden truths. And strangely, you don't feelalone in those formations.\"Websites:http://www.cropcirclenews.comhttp://www.bertjanssen.nlhttp://www.cropcircleconnector.comhttp://www.cccrn.ca/http://thecropcirclewebsite.50megs.comhttp://www.cropcircleresearch.comhttp://www.bltresearch.com/http://home.clara.net/lucypringlehttp://www.dcca.nlhttp://www.invisiblecircle.dehttp://www.temporarytemples.co.ukhttp://www.swirlednews.comhttp://www.heramagazine.nethttp://members.iinet.net.au/~bwratten/ccc.htmlhttp://www.CropCircleAnswers.comhttp://www.busty-taylor.com/cropper/98busty2.htmhttp://www.cropcircleconnector.com/ilyes/ilyes.htmlhttp://ufo.internauci.plhttp://www.wylatowo.mogilno.plhttp://www.wylatowo.mogilno.pl/news.php?art=94Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund PolicyCopyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
