I also asked the Earthfiles and radio audience to let me knowabout bird anomalies. I have received so many reports today that I am sharing some ofthem from various regions of the country. E-mail # 1 - Lusk, Wyoming:\"I recently moved back to Wyoming after a 30-year stint in California. One of thefirst things I noticed was the lack of birds here. The state bird is the Meadowlark andI have always loved listening to them. They are gone.Within a week of being here, the only birds I saw were robins, not the normalpopulation of sparrows, finches, swallows, etc. I can remember that most of the treeshere were filled with nesting populations of these birds.About a week ago, I noticed that even the robins were gone. I mentioned it to mybrother the other day... where are all the birds? He said I would hear them early inthe morning, but I had to disagree. I wake up at 5:30 here and there are no birdschattering early in the morning or in the evening. The sky is devoid of all birds.For the past week I have been on a search for birds, any birds. I had driven dirt roadsway out in the country where you would normally see large populations gatheringseeds from the wheat fields, but there are none to be seen, sitting on fences or in thesky.Very strange.....When I heard your program last night I decided to tell you about this. There are also the following missing bird reports in the media:'Heron colony vanishes into thin air07:26 PM PDT on Wednesday, July 14,2004By GARY CHITTIM / KING 5 NewsPOINT ROBERTS, Wash. Biologists checking in on one of the region's largest heron coloniesdiscovered it was gone. A healthy, thriving heron colony is easy to spot fromthe air. A heron colony at Tsawwassen is tiny compared the massive PointRoberts colony a few miles to the south or at least it used to be. Flying over it, there's nothing to see - no birds, no visible nests, just an emptysea of trees. No birds or nests are visible from the air. KING 5 captured videoand showed it to Ann Eissinger, the foremost expert on the Point Robertsheron colony. Our pictures confirmed what she witnessed on the ground. 'The last time I went into the colony, it was quiet. Just the feeling I had wasthere was something seriously wrong here,' she said. To add to the mystery, Eissinger said just a few weeks earlier, the colony wasits loud, active self.'There were at least a hundred active pairs with young. We don't know whathappened to them. The birds just disappeared,' she said. They disappeared somewhere into the vast openness dubbed the Salish Seastretching from Puget Sound past the Strait of Georgia. Perhaps some joined"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"smaller nearby colonies and some fell prey to a once-struggling,now-booming, local bald eagle population. Nearby development, including agolf resort, may have chased some away. But all of those possibilitiescombined cannot account for such a mass exodus. 'This heron colony is the largest in the whole Salish Sea, and has been fordecades. There were at least 500 nesting pairs at one time,' she said. And while biologists try to figure out where the birds went, the bigger, moreserious question is: Why did they leave? Biologists hold out hope the colonyis just taking a year off for some reason and will re-establish itself. In themeantime they say it is critical to protect other, healthy heron colonies.' 'July 12, 2004Pelicans Mistaking Asphalt for Lakes, CreeksPHOENIX. ARIZONA 'It's a strange sight to see. Nearly two dozen endangered brown pelicans havecrashed onto sidewalks and roads, mistaking the heat-induced shimmer of thepaved surface for lakes and creeks. Game and Fish says the birds 'try to landon the water, but it's asphalt,' then it's Bam! The pelicans have been foundfrom Yuma to Phoenix. Most have been located in southern Arizona, wherethey've landed while flying out of Mexico's Gulf of California. So far, thepelicans have been treated mostly for dehydration and emaciation.' \"I have traveled a 150 mile radius of the town in which I am residing during the pasttwo weeks and have noted this lack of birds from Casper to Cheyenne to Douglasand Torrington. I live in Lusk which is located close to the Nebraska state line. I planto take several more trips across Wyoming the next couple of weeks and will keeplooking.\" E-mail # 2 - Lynwood, Washington:\"On last night's C2C AM show, you requested any info regarding birdbehaviour that we might have noticed. Well, a week ago I accompanied afriend on an afternoon cruise around the bay area where the Skaggit Riverenters Puget Sound (South of Anacortes, Washington). It was your mid-sizedparty/tour type of craft, so I had occasion to spend a while talking withthe Captain as he steered about, announcing the various wildlife he observedas we passed it. He appeared quite knowledgeable about the bird lifeespecially and we were fortunate to see quite a few different species. But as we cruised along talking, he suddenly grabbed his binoculars and cut theengines. Then he reached and pulled out a few books, flipped to a page...and yelled 'I thought So!'. He then announced that a small group of birdson nearby rocks were of a certain species, but then with a frown he flippedto a section showing migratory routes... and then back to the binocs.....And then exclaimed, as he showed me several detailed maps, that these birds,right now, SHOULD be present well above THE ARCTIC CIRCLE during theirnormal migratory pattern! Then, a bit later, we cruised by quite a few birds as they floated (and flew)that even I could identify easily........as Loons! And these Loons are normallyalways way up in the high altitude lakes of the Cascade Mts. here in WA State thistime of year!Birds have long been an interest as I have lived with a Molluccan Cockatoofor 21 years now, who herself seems to be going thru an outspokendemonstrative phase currently. But anyway the wild birds we spotted seemedto suggest something significant to me, and I was convinced the Captain knewwhat he was talking about. Unfortunately, I can't remember the name of thespecies that was supposed to be way up North right now (late July), butcould find out if you wanted me to.\" E-mail # 3 - Chicago, Illinois:\"Early this morning I heard yourreport on \"Coast To Coast AM\" with George Noory about the strangeincidents that have recently taken place of homing pigeons disappearing,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"white pelicans vanishing, and what have you. And, I understand that oneof the theories proffered presently regarding these extraordinaryoccurrences is that these birds' navigational systems may have broughtthem to exotic places because of the anomalies currently developing inthe earth's magnetic field. Your request for reports from listeners aboutstrange animal behaviours prompts me to write. I don't know if you or anyof your elegantly educated associates or consultants will consider theseobservations relevant. But, I thought it might be worth mentioning thathere in Chicago in the last few years several groups of Argentine monkparakeets have moved in, and have been nesting here all year round. Wehave a flock of them occupying a particular tree just a few hundred feetfrom our home. And, they seem to have no plans to leave. Before theysettled in, all of the herrn doktoren had assumed that they could notsurvive the winters here. But, they have, in fact, been thriving.Argentine monk parakeets, and various other species of parakeets andparrots, have also established themselves in London, Middlesex (See theenclosed article below.). And, I know from a friend who happens to be amember of the senior faculty at The Hague that parakeets have establishedthemselves there as well, and seem to have every intention of staying on.I suppose you know that the swallows stopped returning to Capistranoseveral years ago, too. The theory at that time was that they had moveddown the road because the annual swarm of tourists that came to see themhad made them uncomfortable. But, nobody really knew. And, I haven'theard a word about it since. I don't know if any of these changes hasanything to do with the earth's gravitational field. But, they sure looklike portends to me. I certainly never thought I'd live to see anytropical species moving into this neighborhood and laying claim toterritory here. I'd be surprised if they don't know something we don't.There are coyotes in Massachusetts now, too, in clear spite of America'sbest efforts. And, as far as we know, they've never been there before.'Ananova: Wild parrots rife in leafy LondonThe number of wild parrots living in England is rising by 30% per year,according to a new study. Researchers have been tracking several varieties of parakeet, originallyfrom countries such as India and Brazil, but which are now surviving inever-greater numbers in southern England. The findings, from Oxford University's Edward Grey Institute of FieldOrnithology, give a glimpse of exotic creatures in unlikely places.Last summer, there were areas of woodland that sounded more likeequatorial rain forest than suburban parkland. Alexandrine parakeets have been spotted by Lewisham crematorium andorange-winged parakeets, native to the Amazon, have now set up home inWeybridge. South American monk parakeets have formed a colony in Borehamwood andblue-crowned parakeets were observed in Bromley. There have been reports that there could now be 20,000 wild parrots,including parakeets, living in England, with the largest concentrationaround London and the South East. In the Surrey stockbroker belt, a single sports ground is believed to behome to about 3,000 parrots. The rate of increase, helped by mild winters,is much greater than had been expected.'\" E-mail # 4 - San Antonio, Texas: \"I heard your show this am concerning bird behavior and would like to sharemy observations."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The birds down here DO seem to be acting strangely! I love animals and tryto be very careful when driving so that I will not hit anything...but moreand more, the birds are \"divebombing\" in front of the car as people drivedown the road. It is the strangest thing! And their flight patterns areerratic, as though they are confused or drunk. It has been harder and harderto keep from hitting them because they fly down so quickly, and yesterday, Ihit the first one in my life. Actually, it was my son that mentioned it a while ago, because he had onefly straight into his windshield and crack it, so I began to payattention.\" E-mail # 5 - Southern California: \"I live in southern Ca and own a number of properties in northern Ca so it keeps megoing back and forth. Last week I was heading back home here to Southern Ca, I wasin central Ca maybe 1.5 hours south of Sacramento there is it mostly fields and a lotof birds usually in the area. I had my 2 sons with me, we noticed a HUGE flock ofblack birds, the reg type for that area, but there must have been over 1,000 it lookedlike the sky was almost blacked out by them, that in itself was a bit odd, but then aswe got closer I noticed this odd behavior, usually when there is a large flock of birdslike that they can maneuver together, usually following the leading birds and theykind of move around like a big flag following each other.But these were very very erratic hitting each other, going in all different directionsthen going back all of them were heading in different directions then it seemed likethey realized this and headed back to group then many of them would hit each other ,there were 30 or so dead and many more hitting the ground then bouncing about a bitthen would get up , fly away and do this again. We stopped there for close to 20minutes to watch this odd spectacle.I have never seen anything like this before, I am not sure if this is considered oddbehavior, but it was odd to me so I am sending you this email.\" E-mail # 6 - Southwestern North Dakota: \"I have just read the article about birds on your website and I felt compelled to senda note. Now in my 40's , I am a life long observer of birds. I reside in North Dakotaand have for the last five years. And I just keep on saying to myself or to others ,'What is up with the birds?' They are acting strange. I have seen large groups of different types of birds flocking in the middle of July, anunusual occurrence. I live out in the country and have been driving up and down thisroad for five years now and every summer you might take out a bird here or there ifthey are slow to get out of the way. Not too unusual to hit a meadow lark or someother bird upon occasion, but I am hitting them almost daily. They fly right into mygrill! And I am a bird lover. I try to avoid birds at all cost, but these birds are, I amstarting to think , suicidal! It is almost like their navigation abilities are not what theyshould be or use to be? And it has always been my experience that birds usually do whatever they can tomiss the car , but geez not this year. I have seen Robins landing in trees and it isalmost like they have never landed before. They look like they are dive bombing intothe tree sometimes. Not graceful about their landings, that sort of thing. Maybe it hasto do with the magnetic pull or shift of the earth. And I found it very interestingreading about the white pelican populations. I live in the south western corner ofNorth Dakota. Very near the Montana border. There is a lake in a nearby Montanatown, Baker. The lake had an enormous amount of pelicans this summer, more then Ihave ever observed. The lake is small and they have decided it is contaminated. Theyare saying the possible source of the contamination is the large amount of pelicanfeces in the lake? Weird goings on. Good luck to you and your wonderful websiteand keep up the good work. So what is up with the birds? I guess time will tell. Butthis birder has noticed things are just not quite right.\" E-mail # 7 - East Grand Forks, Minnesota: \"It's been 3 years since I've seen an EnglishSparrow. They were hardy birds that can take thewinters up here in East Grand Forks Minnesota. Icame here in 1972. They were here year after year,until the year 1998. Where did they go? What"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"happened to them?\" E-mail # 8 - Surrey, British Columbia: \"I live in Surrey, BC - last night I noticed a very unusual formation of crows that I'venever seen before. A 'loosely knit' formation of about 200 crows flew over our condolast night at about 200 ft. I thought it was unusual, because they were spread outquite a bit, it took about 5 minutes for them to pass, and, I noticed that they wereflying magnetic north. The #1 reason I think this was not typical was that theyappeared to be in a great hurry, as though they were being pursued. A few minuteslater they were followed by a small flock (20 or so) Starlings on the same flight plan.\" I would appreciate receiving more reports from the Earthfiles and radio audience to:earthfiles@earthfiles.comCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
