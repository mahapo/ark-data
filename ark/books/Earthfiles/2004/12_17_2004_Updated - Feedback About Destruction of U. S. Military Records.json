Military Records Â© 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe Click to Part 1 - \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation? Update December 17, 2004: Viewer reply to this Earthfiles report: E-mail December 15, 2004Nebraska Resident: \"As a former university archivist, I can assure you that the person you interviewedfor your December 11th Dreamland report was correct in every detail of hisdescription of archival protocol and operation. I write requesting confidentiality, but perhaps you might be interested to know thatthere is sensitive information on the controversial subject of UFOs and relatedsubjects at both the Nebraska State Historical Society and at the Archives/SpecialCollections of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. But such is the case across thecountry's archives. Being familiar with directly working with government and military records, I canalso tell you that the public--by which I mean all non-staff and non-faculty memberswho do not work in an archives--has no way to know what exists in an archive. If anarchive does not want one of their document collections to be available to thepublic, the administration merely has to clai m that a particular collection is stillunprocessed or in need of conservation or preservation work. It will remain on ashelf or in a vault and never be cataloged. Lack of funds and time will usually becited as justification. That is my main point: If an archive wants something to remainsecret, all it has to do is keep it on the back-log of unprocessed materials, and therewill be no public record that it even exists. The public has no legal right to accessarchival materials that are unprocessed. That is at the discretion of the archivesadministration. The secret world of archives. The stories one could tell . . .My interest in UFOs goes back to the Mojave Desert in Palmdale, California in the1970s, where I grew up near the Lockheed base. All of the family's closest friendswere in intelligence and government work, and I will never forget the talk of strangestories we heard from them, and that I and my siblings experienced first-hand morethan once. There are many stories, some involving events I would never put in anemail. To protect my scholarly career, I am afraid to venture too deeply into suchwaters, but I certainly appreciate people like you who try to get to the bottom ofthings.\"December 10, 2004 St. Louis, Missouri - Since I first posted the 4-part series about\"Peculiar Phenomena\" at Earthfiles that included former New Mexico Congressman SteveSchiff's frustration with the DOD claim that all 1947 Roswell Army Air Field outgoingrecords had been destroyed without proper authority, I received this week an e-mail aboutanother famous destruction of military files that might also have included Roswell UFOcrash information. The source has worked as an archive technician at the NationalPersonnel Records Center (NPRC) in St. Louis, Missouri. That's where U. S. military"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"personnel records have been kept since the 1950s.National Personnel Records Center (NPRC), St. Louis, Missouri, where U. S.military personnel records have been kept since the 1950s.He has requested anonymity, but here is an excerpt from his email:\"I saw your report on the Peculiar Phenomena on your website. What most attractedmy attention was thepart where you explain how Cong. Steve Schiff tried to get a GAO Report on theRoswell Incident. When I started reading the DOD response mentioning the National PersonnelRecords Center, I was even more intrigued. ...I was assigned to the RecordsReconstruction Branch (commonly referred to as Recon). On July 12, 1973, a fireoccurred at the Center, destroying or severely damaging close to 17 million militarypersonnel records from pre-WWI to post-Korea. The records primarily involvedwere all Army records up to 1957; and all Air Force records from the last name ofHubbard to Z, up to 1963. As you know, in July 1947, the Army Air Force andArmy Air Corps combined into what is today known as the U. S. Air Force.\"He agreed to talk on the record, but anonymously, about the July 12, 1973, fire at theNational Personnel Record Center in St. Louis.National Personnel Record Center (NPRC) on July 12, 1973, as fire destroyed16 to 17 million military personnel records, St. Louis, Missouri. Photographs and history athttp://www.archives.gov/facilities/mo/st_louis/military_personnel_records/fire_1973.htmlInterview:Former Archive Technician, National Personnel Record Center (NPRC), St. Louis,Missouri: \"The fire that occurred on July 12, 1973, that destroyed so many records itdestroyed around 16 to 17 million records. These records comprised Army and Air Forcerecords from 1898 around the Spanish American War to 1963 for Air Force and 1957 forArmy.The problem that has occurred since the fire is when we've had veterans come in, there isno way to truly answer a request. We have bits and pieces of information we have entrydates we can get from the V. A. (Veterans Administration) to make a certificate say whenthey got in the service and when they got out and if honorable discharge or not. Then theyuse that for benefits."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"But say if they got hit by shell fragments or pieces of bullets in their body. Now later on,things are affecting their health. What are they going to do? They go to the V. A. and itturns them down for any kind of benefits because they can't prove it was service-connected. That's one of the problems I noticed.But the big thing also is that we really don't know how the fire started and how it couldhave destroyed so many records. Or even how it was allowed to occur. I had a friend whowas a firefighter and still is a firefighter and he used to work with veteran firefighters whowere at the scene on that day of July 12, 1973. He told me that some of the firefighterswere not allowed to go into the building. Basically, it was allowed to burn. They citedsecurity reasons, but you can make your own estimate on what that means.The way the building is set up, they have these metal shelves where they stack the records.That perplexed me, too, because I wonder how the fire was not contained by some of themetal shelving? I thought it quite odd that the fire could travel so extensively and soquickly to destroy so many of the records.People said there was a man who was crazy and he put cigarette packs in different spots,lit them up and that's what destroyed all those records. I'm thinking to myself, how does acouple of cigarette packs do so much extensive damage? We're talking about 16 to 17million records! The fact that so many people really don't know how it happened. It's veryperplexing, Linda.THE IMPLICATION IS THAT THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN A FIRE THAT WASDELIBERATELY STARTED BY SOMEBODY IN THE GOVERNMENT WHOWANTED TO DESTROY MILLIONS OF RECORDS FOR REASONS THAT MIGHTRELATE TO THE FACT THAT THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIAPrivacy Act of 1974) WAS GOING TO COME INTO PLAY WITHIN HOW MANYMONTHS OF THAT FIRE?Actually, I'm not sure the month it came out in 1974, but it was in 1974 that the Freedomof Information Act (FOIA Privacy Act) came into play. You can see the dates are veryclose. I personally believe it had something to do with that the fire there's something morethan we are led to believe.\"Editor's Note: The FOIA Privacy Act of 1974 enhanced the FOIA by permittingindividuals access to records about themselves, which are held by federal agencies.The law requires that each agency publish a description of its record system andforbids the agency from disclosing personal information except to the individual whois the subject of such information. Both laws permit the individual to request accessto federal records regarding himself or herself and allows the individual to appeal adenial of that request. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) became law in 1966 and guaranteed thepublic the right of access to information held by the federal government. Accordingto the act, any individual may request and receive a document, file, or other recordheld by any agency of the federal government.\"Those records involved a lot of information classified information, I believe OSS, thepredecessor to the CIA and personnel who were in that agency. It involved most likelyinformation involving Roswell and other possible crash sites and the Freedom ofInformation Act Privacy Act was going to come out in 1974 who knows what kind of apanic the government went in at the time and said, 'We have to do something to make surepeople don't have a chance to look at this information.'RIGHT, AND IT WOULD BE THE SAME SYNDROME THAT SO FRUSTRATEDCONGRESSMAN SCHIFF GETTING RID OF RECORDS.Right. And the scary thing about it all is that we have so many veterans out there that aresuffering and there is nothing that can be done because their records were burned up. It's avery odd situation in many respects."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" IN YOUR E-MAIL TO ME, YOU SAID: \"THE RECON SECTION WAS ALWAYSSHROUDED IN MYSTERY\" AT THE NPRC. COULD YOU ELABORATE ON THAT?What I stated in my e-mail about a shroud of secrecy and mystery is that a lot of peoplegot sick (asthma, allergies, skin dermatitis, sleep apnea). I was one of them. But especiallya person I knew a young woman about 39 years old. She got sick one day and she justdidn't come to work. The day she left and the day we found out she had passed (fromcancer) was maybe about not more than five or six months.WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT YOU AND OTHERS WHO HAVE WORKED INTHE NPRC IN THE RECON SECTION HAVE WORKED WITH 1973FIRE-DAMAGED DOCUMENTS THAT MIGHT HAVE CAUSED A LOT OF YOU TOGET SICK?Right. Core 5, 'Recon,' is situated on the second floor of the NPRC building. The fireoccurred on the sixth floor. Over theyears since 1973, Recon has been shuffled around the building, but ever since I workedthere, it has been on the second floor.And a lot of the records were not completely destroyed. A lot of the records were simplycharred very badly. Obviously, they used some kind of water to put out some of the fire.I'm sure this happened right after the fire where there was a huge growth of mold on therecords. I remember at the beginning I was working there that I would touch the recordsand they were covered in mold. The mold was of all different colors. I guess I was a littlebit not knowing what was going on that I did not think it was mold. I guess I thought it wassomething covering the records. I didn't expect it to be a dense mold.NPRC Document Reconstruction afterJuly 12, 1973, fire, St. Louis, Missouri.In September 2003, the Center started placing the moldy records in large, plastic bags(similar to those large freezer bags you can buy in the store.) We were all told that themold was \"contained\" while in the bags, and that way everyone would be able to workwith them like they used to before the Special Mold Project in the special room that lastedfor about one year. I asked, 'The record must be taken out of the bag to be worked, so howis it contained then?' Never received a good response. And that is how they are stillworking with the burned records to this day - receiving them in large, plastic bags.IN YOUR WORK IN THE NPRC, DID YOU EVER TALK WITH ANYONEPRIVATELY ABOUT THEIR HAVING FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE OF SEEINGRECORDS CONCERNING PEOPLE WHO HAD SPECIFIC ASSIGNMENTSRELATED TO UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS?No, I haven't. I have never wanted to go there because I don't really know what mighthappen. It's a very touchy subject, as you know. I know there are records that are notburned that are in the vault (large record room built like a safe in which sensitive classifiedpersonnel records are stored) that involve, from what I've learned in books I've read, thatinvolve military personnel that were connected to Roswell. So if those aren't burned, whoknows what kind of information could be in there (the vault)?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Of course, the records are more of a personal nature, but there could be glimpses, hints ofthings. There could be actual documents, for all we know.\"Websites:http://www.archives.gov/facilities/mo/st_louis.htmlThe 1973 fire: http://www.archives.gov/facilities/mo/st_louis/military_personnel_records/fire_1973.htmlCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
