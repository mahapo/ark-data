Wesley Clark,NATO Commander. 1999 photo from Kosovo Crisis: a Study in ForeignPolicy Mismanagement by Dr. Vojin Joksimovich. November 3, 2004 Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada - Wesley K. Clark was born inChicago, Illinois, in December 1944, an only child of Veneta and Benjamin Kanne. Hisfather died and he moved with his mother to Little Rock, Arkansas. In 1954, Venetamarried Victor Clark who became Wes Clark's stepfather.In 1962, Wesley Clark was admitted to the United States Military Academy and began a38-year career of public service in the United States Army, where he became a four-stargeneral.In 1994, General Clark was named Director for Strategic Plans and Policy of the JointChiefs of Staff, Pentagon.In 1995, General Clark traveled to the Balkans as the military negotiator with AmbassadorRichard Holbrooke in a United States effort to end the war in Bosnia, the bloodiest war inEurope since World War II. A few months later, General Clark played a vital role increating a peace plan in the Dayton summit which ended the war.In 1997, after serving as Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Southern Command, GeneralClark was selected for one of the top posts in the military: Supreme Allied Commander ofNATO - a position first held by General Dwight D. Eisenhower. As Supreme AlliedCommander, General Clark commanded NATO forces during the war in Kosovo."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"In early 2003, Americans drafted General Clark to run for President on the Democraticplatform. Given General Clark's distinguished military career, it seemed likely to CanadianUFO investigator, Grant Cameron, that Wesley Clark might have - must have? - beenbriefed on Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). Grant is Director of Presidentialufo.comand has made a serious study of American presidential calendars, diaries and documentsdated around the times of significant UFO incidents. For a long time, Grant Cameron hasurged UFO investigators to seek out well-connected people who run for political office andask them in public press conferences: 'Have you ever been briefed about UFOs?'Recently Roswell UFO crash researcher, David Rudiak, did ask General Clark thatquestion and received a remarkable answer. Grant Cameron explained for me this weekthe background behind the General's reply.Interview:September 27, 2003Gen. Clark Discussed \"Beyond the Speed of Light\"Grant Cameron, UFO Investigator and Director, Presidentialufo.com, Winnipeg,Manitoba, Canada: \"The first event occurred on September 27, 2003, at a private homewhere his campaign was just getting going. Wesley Clark who is a 4-Star General, thehighest military rank that exists today was in Newcastle, New Hampshire, and was asked aquestion by Jay Buckley, who was an astronaut on the space shuttle what his (Clark's)vision for space was. Wesley Clark said he believed it was possible that we would be ableto go past the speed of light. \"I still believe in E=mc2, but I can't believe in all of humanhistory we've never been able to go beyond the speed of light to reach where we want togo. I happen to believe that mankind can do it.\"Editor's Note: The first media to report General Clark's reply to Jay Buckley was WIREDNEWS: 9/2003 NEW CASTLE, New Hampshire -- \"Wesley Clark: Rhodes scholar, four-stargeneral, NATO commander, futurist? (WIRED's first story version used the word\"fanatic\" which was later changed to \"futurist.\") During a whirlwind campaign swingSaturday through New Hampshire, Clark, the newest Democratic presidentialcandidate, gave supporters one of the first glimpses into his views on technology.\"We need a vision of how we're going to move humanity ahead, and then we need toharness science to do it,\" Clark told a group of about 50 people in New Castleattending a house party -- a tradition in New Hampshire presidential politics thatenables well-connected voters to get an up-close look at candidates. Then the58-year-old Arkansas native, who retired from the military three years ago, droppedsomething of a bombshell on the gathering.\"I still believe in e=mc2, but I can't believe that in all of human history, we'll neverever be able to go beyond the speed of light to reach where we want to go,\" saidClark. \"I happen to believe that mankind can do it. I've argued with physicists aboutit, I've argued with best friends about it. I just have to believe it. It's my onlyfaith-based initiative.\" Clark's comment prompted laughter and applause from thegathering. ...... Einstein's theory of special relativity says that time slows down as an objectapproaches the speed of light. Some scientists say that FTL travel therefore impliestime travel, or being able to travel to the future or the past.Clark's comment about FTL travel came at the end of a long answer to a questionabout his views of NASA and the U.S. space program. Clark said he supports theagency and believes \"America needs a dream and a space program.\"But Clark said the nation must prioritize its technological goals and take a pragmaticapproach to focusing its scientific resources and talent.\"Some goals may take a lifetime to reach,\" he said. \"We need to set those goals now.We need to rededicate ourselves to science, engineering and technology in thiscountry.\"Grant Cameron: \"I was very surprised that Clark made this dramatic statement aboutgoing past the speed of light, that he believed it and argued (with scientists) about it as a4-star general and NOBODY asked him a question about it?! He went through the entirecampaign until last Saturday night and nobody asked him, 'What are you talking about,General? What do you mean going faster than the speed of light? Where did you get thisfrom?\" Everyone was just silent.After that, because General Clark was on the campaign trail and sounded like he mighthave other technology information - and I'm very aware that the highest ranking people"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"should answer about UFOs since they might know stuff - I passed around to a number ofresearchers in the United States the challenge to get Wesley Clark and ask him thequestion I always ask about the President of the United States. That is not if you believe inUFOs, but 'Have you ever been briefed about UFOs?'A number of researchers said they did not want to be embarrassed asking the question orthey had someone in their family who would come under government scrutiny if theyasked the question. Basically, Clark went through his whole campaign and eventuallypulled out of the race and no one asked him the UFO briefing question until last Saturday,October 23, 2004. The questioner was David Rudiak.\"Editor's Note: A photograph taken July 8, 1947, in Fort Worth, Texas, by James BondJohnson of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram shows Brig.

Ramey messageat http://www.roswe llproof.home stead.com/ October 30, 2004 -Gen. Clark Asked About UFO BriefingGrant Cameron: \"David Rudiak is probably one of the foremost experts on the RoswellUFO crash story and has an excellent website on Roswell. He e-mailed me on Sundaymorning (October 31, 2004)) and told me he had been on business in Reno, Nevada, andhad come cross Wesley Clark (now out of the Presidential campaign). Gen. Clark wascampaigning for Sen. Kerry during the Presidential campaign. Rudiak watched Clark'sspeech and afterward, he went up and asked the General my briefing question.I can give you the exact quote of what happened as David told me, but it was notrecorded:David Rudiak: 'General Clark, when you were running for president, you said youthought mankind would one day fly faster than the speed of light and visit the stars.My question is: when you were in the military, were you ever briefed on the subjectof UFOs?' Rudiak said at this point, 'Clark looked down for a moment and shook his head"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"somewhat chagrined looking like 'Damn it, here it comes!' Then he said to me, 'Iheard a bit. In fact, I am going to be in Roswell, New Mexico, tonight.' Rudiak came back with a question: 'So, were you briefed?' General Clark said to him: 'There are things going on. But we will have to work outour own mathematics.' Was Gen. Clark Given Access to'Crashed Saucer Material'?Grant Cameron: \"When I put this question out across the United States to a number ofdifferent people, I sent it to a couple of people who were inside NIDS (National Instituteof Discovery Science, now-defunct). Some of those people have bumped up against theUFO subject in their former work for the government and a number of them have beennotoriously known as the 'aviary.'Editor's Note: \"Aviary\" is the bird-named group of UFO investigators allegedly linked togovernment insiders who have leaked information - officially or unofficially - aboutnon-human entities and technologies.Grant Cameron: \"Back in 2003 when I gave Gen. Clark's initial statement about the factthat we could go faster than the speed of light to one of the people inside NIDS, he said: 'Abird told me that Clark has been given access to crashed saucer material.'That's why I pushed very hard for people to actually confront General Clark with thequestion: 'Have you ever been briefed (about UFOs)?' I wanted to see what a 4-stargeneral with classified access would answer, which did not happen until Saturday night,October 30, 2004, thanks to David Rudiak. I think in that exchange that Clark basicallyconfirmed he knows something about what is going on.WHAT YOU MEAN BY 'CONFIRMED' IS THAT HE DID NOT BRUSH MR. RUDIAK'SQUESTION OFF. HE SAID THAT WE WILL HAVE TO WORK OUT THEMATHEMATICS, IMPLYING THAT THEY HAVE HAD SOME EXPOSURE TO ATECHNOLOGY AND SOMETHING OUT THERE, THE INTELLIGENCE BEHIND ITWHICH IS NOT HELPING US? WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HELP OURSELVES?Yes. In fact, it struck me that there are a number of times when high ranking people havebeen asked about this and they have brought up this thing about mathematics. Eric Walker, Ph.D., Former President,Penn State UniversityEditor's Note: Penn State's History of Mechanical engineering states: \"Eric A. Walkerbecame the sixth dean of engineering at Penn State. Eric Walker was born in England, butspent his youth in Wrightsville, Pennsylvania. He was educated as an electrical engineerand received his Ph.D. and M.B.A. from Harvard. During World War II, he participated inthe underwater acoustic research program at Harvard. Following the war, the entireunderwater acoustic program was transferred to Penn State and became known as theOrdnance Research Laboratory (ORL). Eric Walker was the original director of ORL andalso head of the electrical engineering department.\"Eric A. Walker, Dean of the College of Engineering and Architecture, was a strongproponent of research. In 1956, Walker became University Vice President for Researchand within five months, he became Penn State's twelfth President. Under President Walker(1956-70), the University expanded more rapidly than ever in its history. The enrollmentclimbed from 13,000 to 45,000, and the budget grew from $34 million to $165 million. Ahundred new buildings were constructed on the University Park Campus alone.\"Grant Cameron: \"A number of years ago, we had been chasing after Dr. Eric Walker,who was former President of Penn State University. Dr. Walker was a guy who claimed allalong that he knew what was going on and he tried to walk his way around the varioussubjects we were asking about such as MJ-12 and what the U. S. military knew aboutUFOs. Dr. Walker had been there right as it all started in 1947 and co-invented the homingtorpedo. When Dr. Vannevar Bush retired the guy everyone thought was running the UFOprogram in the Pentagon - Dr. Eric Walker took over Bush's office. So, Eric Walker was avery high ranking guy. He answered a number of UFO-related questions indirectly to us.At one point, Dr. Walker even brought up mathematics. One time he was being"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"interviewed by a guy from England who had a physics background. Dr. Walker asked theinterviewer, 'How good is your mathematics?' The English investigator answered, 'Well asgood as it can be for a doctorate in physics. But why do you ask?'Dr. Walker said, 'Because only a couple of people are able to handle this issue. Unless yourmind is like Einstein's, I do not think you will achieve anything.'A second incident that popped into my mind when I heard General Clark talk about themathematics was Jan Hartzen who runs the Orange County MUFON. He was in a 1993lecture given by Lockheed's original Skunk Works Director, Ben Rich.Ben Rich, original director during Cold War of Lockheed's highly classified \"Skunk Works.\"Rich is in the cockpit of a F-117 stealth fighter, one of his Skunk Works projects. Photo credit: NASA.According to Jan Hartzen who was in the auditorium listening, Ben Rich said we have thetechnology to 'take ET home.' And Lockheed Skunk Works is where it's believed a lot ofUFO technology back-engineering has been done.Another thing that Jan told me was that Ben Rich was talking about the mathematics thatwe've found the thing that we are missing, the part of the equation we have been missing we've figured it out. If you know a number of people who are working on the zero pointenergy stuff Hal Puthoff and people like that they are always talking about themathematics. And mathematics in this whole UFO mystery is very important. That's thekey, the mathematics.And strangely enough, in October 2004 we have General Wesley Clark bringing up theidea of mathematics being important.DID DAVID RUDIAK HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENT ON THE WAY THATGENERAL CLARK LOOKED AFTER HE MADE THE STATEMENT, 'WE'RE GOINGTO HAVE TO WORK OUT THE MATHEMATICS.'No, not as far as I know. It was one of these things after a speech where you are shakinghands and you have only fifteen seconds to get in what you want to say. I did check andfound out that General Clark was in Roswell. He was going to Roswell right after thatlecture. So David brought up UFOs and General Clark brought up Roswell, as if the twoare connected, which would seem to indicate some confirmation of the Roswell crash.Clark was very interested in space. He wanted to be an astronaut. He's in the Army, but hewanted to be in the U.S. Air Force. He couldn't, though, because he is short-sighted andcould not get into the USAF. So, he went to West Point and into the Army.I followed his presidential campaign website all the way through. He met with people likethe Mars Society. They described their encounter with him as, 'We were blown away!'When they asked him questions such as, 'What about a trip to Mars?' He said he wanted tospeed the trip up. He said, 'I think we should be looking at new propulsion and enablingtechnologies.' He did not really want to go to places we had already been. They describedClark when he talked about space to the Mars Society as having fire in his voice.In that sense, he's a guy who is very interested in space and has not had to address theUFO question, but is still hiding what he actually knows. But I would say he probably hasenough that he could break it open. So to me, it's an important thing to ask presidents and4-star generals about UFOs, rather than people who are just in the military. The leaderscarry a lot of weight, what they say carries a lot of weight, and if one of these peopleshould start to talk or be confronted by the media, it could break the story wide open. Wemight get somebody on the record who has to tell the truth and will tell us what is actuallygoing on. People like Clark should know what is going on.BUT AFTER 60 SOME YEARS, IT IS STILL NOT IN THE INTEREST OF THEUNITED STATES NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS TO OPEN UP THEEXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITY SUBJECT."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Exactly. And why haven't the aliens come forward? Why are the aliens covering this up?The aliens are doing the same sort of thing as the government, dropping little hints thatthey are there, little indications. But I always maintain that they could land on the WhiteHouse lawn and end this (mystery) tomorrow. They don't. There might be a very goodreason behind the scenes why the aliens and the U. S. government are both gradually.I'm doing a lecture in Las Vegas about the vast majority of things we believe today in theUFO community are not things we discovered (independently.) They are things that havebeen leaked to us by the U. S. government, whether it's Area 51, MJ-12, crashed saucers.This is all stuff that has been gradually leaked to us and our world view has been formedby the U. S. government. The aliens, I think, are doing the same sort of thing leaking littlethings and making us more and more aware all the time. But no one is coming out to endthe cover-up. I think the government and the aliens could both do it. They haven't, whichindicates to me there must be something behind the scenes that we have not exploredcarefully enough and we should look at: why are they doing this? What is the thing that isstopping them from coming public? White House Insights to the Strict UFO Cover-UpWhat happens if the President is asked: Were you briefed on the subject of UFOs? In fact,I had Jimmy Carter on the phone about to ask him that very question (Grant called in liveradio program). For whatever reason, they came back on the air and said they would nottake the question. I think Jimmy Carter knew what the question would be and he told thehost he was not going to take the question. So, they know it's a very touchy thing and itconfirms that inside the government there is something official going on. That's why weuse the word 'briefing.' Clark understood what Rudiak was asking. The same as when Iasked Dick Cheney (Vice President in bush Administration). I asked him if in hisgovernment jobs had he ever been briefed on the subject of UFOs? If so, when was it andwhat were you told?'That's when he stumbled and said, 'If I had been briefed,' - and he knew what the wordmeant - 'if I had been briefed on that subject, it probably would have been classified and Iwould not be talking about it.' That basically confirmed to me there is something to it. Butno reporters picked up on Cheney saying that the subject of UFOs was probably classified.But it's just a matter of getting somebody at the right time and then some reporterfollowing up with: Is there some truth? What were you told in your briefing?For example, there was a question asked Gerald Ford about what date was he briefedabout UFOs? He said, 'I'm never going to confirm that I was briefed. Don't even go there.'So, it's the whole thing that once you have a briefing and he confirms he has been briefed,then you can go to the White House and say, 'I want the date of the briefing.' He wasbriefed and you should be able to get an official time and date. But you can go toPresidential Archives and you can check all you want and there is no record.\"More Information: For a review of alleged government documents that discuss extraterrestrial biologicalentities and technologies, click on The Majestic Documents.
