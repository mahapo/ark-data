October 15, 2004 Boulder, Colorado - This week in London at the annual Greenpeacebusiness lecture, disturbing recent greenhouse data from America's Mauna LoaObservatory in Hawaii, Britain's Hadley Center and the Norwegian Institute for AirResearch was discussed. In 2002 and 2003, the average rise in the amount of CO2 in theEarth's atmosphere rose from about 1.5 parts per million by volume to as much as 2.54ppm. Some atmospheric scientists worry that such a sudden and rapid increase ingreenhouse CO2 is linked to rising global temperatures. If the CO2 continues to increase rapidly for the next five to ten years, it could mean thateven the soil of our planet is warming to the point that it more easily releases carbondioxide to the atmosphere. A Norwegian scientist, Dr. Kim Holmen, has been studying soiland permafrost oxidation to carbon dioxide in the Northern Hemisphere. See: 10-13-04Earthfiles. He told me this week: \"There is a storage of carbon in soils that can oxidize toCO2 which is at least three times as large as the total atmospheric content of CO2.\" If thesoil and permafrost warmed up enough to release a lot more carbon dioxide, that wouldincrease global warming which releases more CO2 from soils and on and on - which mightlead to a \"runaway greenhouse\" of ever-increasing temperatures.I talked about that possibility with Dr. Pieter Tans, Chief Scientist at the ClimateMonitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory for the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration (NOAA) in Boulder, Colorado. Dr. Tans and the Boulder lab receive soiland atmosphere samples from all over the planet to analyze in an effort to accuratelymonitor greenhouse gas changes. He said the rapid 2002 to 2003 CO2 increase in twoconsecutive years is unusual, but could go back to a lower level in 2004. What impresseshim the most is the entire CO2 measurement record since it began at the Mauna Loa,Hawaii Observatory in 1958.Interview:Pieter Tans, Chief Scientist, Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Boulder, Colorado:\"What strikes me is that in every single year that these measurements have been done, theCO2 in the atmosphere went up."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"In the early part of the record, say from 1958 to 1965 or so, the average annual rate ofcarbon dioxide growth was something like 0.7 parts per million (ppm) per year, whereas inthe past five or six years, the average rate of growth has been more like 1.8 ppm per year two and a half times faster. And up to 2.54 ppm in 2002-2003.Now, you contrast that with the rate of fossil fuel burning in the world let's say you look atthe rate of fossil fuel burning in 1960, it was 2.5 billion tons of carbon per year. Now, it's6.5 billion tons of carbon per year. That's also a factor of 2.5. That's very suggestive.YOU MEAN THE BURNING OF FOSSIL FUELS BY CIVILIZATION IS WHAT ISCONTRIBUTING MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE TO THE ACCELERATING CO2BUILDUP.I'd say it's another nail in the coffin proving that indeed it's us. We humans are causing therate of increase in CO2. We have to take responsibility for this if we are worried aboutclimate change. It's not some kind of natural fluctuation. We are driving climate change.FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AS AN ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICIST, WHAT DO YOUTHINK THE OUTCOME WOULD BE IN ANOTHER 25 YEARS OR SO IF WECONTINUE TO SEE THIS KIND OF INCREASE IN CO2 AROUND THE PLANET?I am confident that by then, there will be no more scientific discussion about, 'Is it humansreally that are causing climate change?' I think by then There is already widespreadagreement about that, incidentally, among the great majority of scientists studying that.There are a few people holding out. But in 25 years, I am pretty confident that that debateis over so we can move into what are we going to do?WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PLANET WILL BE LIKE IN 25 YEARS WITH THISCONTINUAL INCREASE OF CO2?That is a much harder question. What I'm talking about is that the forcing of climate willbe a lot stronger 25 years from now than it is now. The extra forcing caused by humans.When we put these greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, infrared radiation is absorbed bythe atmosphere. Therefore, the Earth has to change its heat budget to accommodate that toa first order that will mean surface warming. But it will mean a lot of other things. Theyare actually very hard to predict. What will climate change look like? We're not just talkingabout climate forcing, but climate effects. Is There A 'Runaway Greenhouse' AcceleratedWarming in Earth's Future?I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING THAT DR. HOLMEN SAID. HEHAS CONCERN THAT THE POPULAR PHRASE, 'RUNAWAY GREENHOUSE,'COULD BE KICKED INTO GEAR IF THE TEMPERATURE REACHES A POINT ATWHICH THE RELEASE OF OXIDIZED CARBON DIOXIDE FROM THE SOILS OFTHE PLANET REALLY DOES START GOING BECAUSE THERE IS THREE TIMESTHE VOLUME OF POTENTIAL CARBON DIOXIDE IN THE SOILS THAN THERE ISIN THE ATMOSPHERE RIGHT NOW.That is definitely not an implausible scenario, especially at high northern latitudes. There isan enormous amount of organic carbon locked up in soils and if these soils warmed it'slocked up in permafrost! So, it's frozen. Therefore, it does not decay. When you thaw thatand it dries out, it can begin oxidizing. It can decay and add additional CO2 to theatmosphere, thereby increasing the climate forces. So it would be triggering furtherwarming. It's like melting of Arctic sea ice would be the same thing. The Arctic Oceanwould then absorb more solar radiation and so if Arctic sea ice melts because of an onsetof warming, it could actually trigger again further warming. It's possible. It's notimplausible.BUT THE CONCEPT OF RUNAWAY GREENHOUSE AFTER A CERTAINTHRESHOLD IS PASSED, IS FEASIBLE?Yes. It's conceivable. And it's probably not unprecedented either. Not a full runawaywhere temperatures go to boiling temperature no way! But we could have, what couldhappen is that we might trigger a very serious planet change in a relatively short period oftime. That is definitely possible. This appears to have happened in the geologic past anumber of times. We have ice core records of Greenland, for example, and you can see inthat record you can see the temperature changed dramatically five or ten degrees in a shortperiod of time."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"THE PUZZLE IS: IF WE WEREN'T THERE WITH CIVILIZATION TO TRIGGER IT,WHAT TRIGGERED IT THEN THAT WE SEEM TO BE DUPLICATING NOW WITHCIVILIZATION?We are moving now in a different regime because that was in the last Ice Age in whichthere seemed to be some instabilities that made the climate at high latitudes at least go upand down in a relative short period of time. Would Scientists Have Advance Warning BeforeNorth Atlantic Drift Stopped?WHAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED THE INSTABILITY?There are theories about this. It could be that the North Atlantic Drift, or what is called the'Thermalhaline Circulation' especially in the North Atlantic Ocean, is somewhat unstable.You either have the Gulf Stream or you shut if off. That's not certain because there arealso arguments against this being the mechanism, but it has played a role this whole NorthAtlantic sinking of salty water when it cools at high northern latitudes, thereby pulling inreplacement water through the Gulf Stream which is warm and brings warmertemperatures to western Europe as well as rain. If that is unstable, then maybe minorchanges could shut if off or turn it on again, you could trigger tremendous regional climatechanges in very short periods of time. That is possible.WHAT KIND OF ADVANCE WARNING DO YOU THINK WE WOULD HAVE IF THEEARTH WAS SUDDENLY GOING TO SEE THE NORTH ATLANTIC DRIFT STOP?That would have tremendous implications for society, I think, if the North Atlantic, theGulf Stream, were to weaken and disappear for some period of time. Western Europewould get a lot colder. Certain types of agriculture just would have to stop in Europe. A lotof other places would get a lot warmer probably. So what you would have is tremendousshifts in economic activity, what is viable and not viable economically, creating a lot ofunrest and unhappiness. Society has to adjust in a very short time.WHAT KIND OF WARNING DO YOU THINK SCIENTISTS WOULD BE ABLE TOGIVE THE POLITICAL AND CIVILIZATION WORLD IF THE NORTH ATLANTICDRIFT WERE HEADING IN THE DIRECTION OF STOPPING?How much advance warning would we be able to give? Probably not long in advance,probably not, at least at this stage of knowledge. I can tell you that, of course, the GulfStream is measured, its salt content is measured continuously in different places, the saltcontent and the temperature of the North Atlantic Ocean are being monitored and therehas been a trend recently that it has become less salty a little bit, very subtle changes.You could say, 'Ah, that's a harbinger of the North Atlantic, or the Gulf Stream, weakeningor stopping. But that's still too early to say, but it's being monitored. How much further thatfreshening would have to go before someone raises alarm bells I don't know. Probablysignificantly further. How long it would then take before something dramatic happens? Icannot tell you. Humans Need to Prepare Now to SurviveMajor Climate ChangeThe climate system is so complicated. We do still need significant advances before we canmake relatively hard predictions about things like that. But you could compare it toearthquake predictions at this point, in some sense. Seismologists, people studying platetectonics, are not able to predict, 'Oh, yeah, we're going to have an earthquake in the SanFrancisco region say the first week of November this year. They can't possibly do that. Sothey don't want to put out warnings of that nature because people are going to react to it.Later, they get blamed. 'Hey, you guys, you were just crying wolf.'On the other hand, sensible things are being done to prevent the worst damage ofearthquakes when they happen, even though nobody can predict when they will happen.Like structural improvements in buildings, for example, and in bridges. You can do thosethings. So, I think that's the kind of thing we should be thinking about in terms of climatechange.WHAT CAN WE DO?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"We should be thinking of measures that would give us some insurance at this point that wecan handle problems when they occur. For example, if the U. S. Midwest were to becomesignificantly drier in the climate change...WHICH IT ALREADY IS.Yes. What would be the proper, good measures we could take right now? I say we caninvest these are just off the top of my head that might be prudent. We would have to investin developing crops that can still grow well under conditions when the summer, especially,gets significantly drier than it is now. Or invest in perhaps irrigation projects. Maybe cropgenetics is the first thing I would think about. It wouldn't cost that much from a societystandpoint. It would be a minor investment.WHAT WOULD IT TAKE POLITICALLY TO GET THIS COUNTRY AND OTHERCOUNTRIES IN THE WORLD TO SAY WE HAVE TO PREPARE FOR OUR FUTUREAND STOP ARGUING ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING AND SAY WE HAVE TOPREPARE FOR IT BY GENETICALLY ALTERING CROPS?That is just one example. Other sensible things we ought to do is to invest in improvedenergy efficiency alternative forms of energy. We should invest in ways to move awayfrom carbon-containing fuels to another source of energy. We should be thinking about sealevels continuing to rise. I was born in The Netherlands and half of that country is belowsea level, for example. I know they have thought about continuing sea level rise and whatto do and can they afford it, especially to keep making the dikes higher. Their answer was,'Yes, we can afford it.' Partially because the population density is very high and so thevalue of land and infrastructure in Holland is so enormous that keeping efforts, making thedikes higher, as a fraction of Gross National Product is relatively small. But if you have anarea say like Florida, the area is certainly 15 times as large as The Netherlands, so theinvestment per capita now is considerably larger. If Rapid Rate of CO2 Increase Persists, What Happens?LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION THAT IF THE INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE CO2IN THE ATMOSPHERE SAY OVER THE NEXT 5 YEARS CONTINUED THE TRENDAS IT DID IN 2002-2003, IN FIVE OR SIX YEARS OF THAT KIND OF INCREASINGCO2, WHAT WOULD THE IMPACT BE ON OUR CLIMATE?If the rate of the increase that we saw in those two years is maintained for five years, thenCO2 would increase by more than 10 parts per million in five years, which is relativelylarge. But in terms of climate forcing, it's still a relatively small amount.I mean the real threat is if we continue on the upward path, eventually climate forcingbecomes very large in eventually decades. So, the additional climate forcing from fiveyears of increasing CO2 is still relatively small amount. But the issue is that the next fiveyears it will keep going. And the next ten years, it will keep going. And another ten years.By then, it's getting to be really large! So, by 2040 or 2050, there will be no doubt thatanybody seriously protests the fact that humans are changing climate and we've got to dosomething.BUT WOULDN'T THAT BE TOO LATE?You have a point. What is too late? It will be more costly and painful if we wait longer,probably. The climate forcing changes very slowly, every year by little bit but always inthe same direction (upward). That doesn't mean that the climate change itself will begradual, as we just talked about earlier. It could be relatively sudden, catastrophic changein climate.Probably the greatest danger that we face is that the climate system would suddenlychange in a short time to a different state and that would greatly change the pressures onwho can live where, what kind of economic activity can be carried out where, which willprobably lead to conflicts and migrations. Even the Pentagon is worried about this from anational security point of view.ESPECIALLY IF IT HAPPENS RAPIDLY WITHOUT MUCH WARNING AND THAT'SWHAT SCIENTISTS CANNOT GUARANTEE.Yeah, you're right. We cannot predict at this point in time whether or where or when thismight happen.\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"1000 Years of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide HistoryPieter Tans, Ph.D.: \"The plot shows the last 1000 years of atmospheric CO2 history as measuredin air bubbles in ice cores and since 1958 directly in the atmosphere.\" Graphic © 2004 by Pieter Tans.Websites:Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii (NOAA)Norwegian Institute for Air ResearchCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
