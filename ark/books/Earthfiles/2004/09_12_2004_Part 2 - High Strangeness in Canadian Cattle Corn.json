C. Canada -Paul Anderson: \"The other problem is that you cannot see these formations from any ofthe roads because the cattle corn is too tall. The corn is 7 to 9 feet tall. That's the one thingabout these you can't just drive by the field and spot it because you can't see anything.THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT NOT ONLY ABOUT THESE IN CANADA, BUTEVEN MIAMISBURG IN OHIO. JEFFREY WILSON AND THE ICCRA TEAM WHOWENT WERE FRUSTRATED BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING ONTHE GROUND AND HAD TO GO UP IN AN AIRPLANE TO FIND IT.That's right. We're pretty confident the ankh one is there because she did give a gooddescription of it. She did say it was approximately the same size as the one with the circleand two crescents which turned out to be 174 feet in length. I am quite anxious to find theankh one.IT'S FASCINATING THAT A 'FULL MOON' AND TWO 'CRESCENT MOONS' ARETHE ASSOCIATED OTHER PATTERN AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF THERE ISANY EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHICS THAT RESEMBLE THE CRESCENT PATTERN.\"(Editor's Note: In the history of using symbols for divination and magic, the circle is asymbol known worldwide to represent the woman, eternity, cycles, seasons. The circle isalso a term used in ritual when someone \"casts a circle\" to work between worlds ordimensions. Protection is needed from above and below. The circle, or sphere, isequidistant in all directions that pass through its center, and therefore focuses energy intothe center.The crescent moon is a symbol of the Goddess. The crescent moon can be either growing(waxing) toward a full moon, or decreasing (waning) to become a new moon. The waxingmoon is used in magic rituals for growth and creativity. The waning moon is used to banishnegativity.More universally, the circle represents infinite energy or spirit of the universe that can't beextinguished by the death of matter. The crescent represents the individualized soul orform created from the infinite energy, but brought into seeming duality or polar opposites,the yin and the yang.) Matsqui Expulsion Cavities in Cattle Corn Growth NodesShaped Like Diamonds and TrianglesPaul Anderson: \"I don't know. A person mentioned to me they thought it was a pagansymbol of some kind, but I don't know specifically what it represents. we've come toexpect the unexpected. You never know what's going to happen or where it's going tohappen or what it's going to look like.TO THAT VERY SPECIFIC POINT OF THE UNEXPECTED, COULD YOU PLEASETALK ABOUT THE DIAMOND-AND-TRIANGLE-SHAPED GROWTH NODEEXPULSION CAVITIES YOU FOUND (AT MATSQUI)?To me, this is the most interesting thing we have found so far this year in Canada. I'm luckyenough that these are not too far from Vancouver, so it's easy to get to these formations.I've been out there a couple of times so far. The plants are on average 7 to 8 feet tall. Theones last year at Abbotsford were about 9 to 10 feet tall. So, these are big plants! These arenot spindly stems as you often see with wheat or barley. The corn stalks can be anywherefrom 1/4 to 3/4's inch thick. What we found so far is the one thing that has me scratching"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"my head. We found it last year as well close to this area.We don't know for sure what they are, but BLT, Inc. (Cambridge, Massachusetts cropsampler Nancy Talbott) looked at the photos and thinks they are special growth nodeexpulsions. The stalks are so long, so tall, you have seven or eight nodes on one stalk - likelast year, we have found as many as five or six nodes or more per stalk will have theselarge expulsion cavities which in a lot of cases, as you described, are shaped like trianglesor diamonds. (Editor's emphasis.) These are large cavities in the nodes, anywhere from 1/4inch to 1/2 inch across. These are not small, tiny microscopic holes. You can't miss these ifyou are looking for them.Diamond-shaped expulsion cavity of cattle corn growth node found throughout the circle and twocrescents pattern discovered in early August in Matsqui, British Columbia, Canada, northwestof Abbotsford.

This node contained three cavities going about three quarters of the way aroundthe stalk. Photograph © 2004 by Paul Anderson, CCCRN.Three cavities in growth node in which the middle one shows yet another splitin the inner node tissue. Photograph © 2004 by Paul Anderson.One thing I want to make clear with these Matsqui expulsion cavities is that we also didsee a lot of bending of nodes in the upper part of the stalks, the upper two or three nodes,from phototropism because there is a lot of recovery in these plants happening by the timewe got there now bending back up to the sun.But in examining those (phototropism-bending) nodes, I haven't yet found any expulsioncavities nothing like the diamond-shaped holes in the nodes. Some of the phototropismcauses severe bending, a severe angle, up to 30 to 40 degrees, just from bending toward thesun. Yet, no node expulsions there."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"But at the same time, we have other samples where you have nodes along the length of thestalk where there has been no bending at all. That's one point I want to make clear: a lot ofthese nodes are not bent. There is no bending of the stalk at the deformed node expulsions.Yet, the node itself is still highly blown out, highly deformed with the large cavities. That'swhat we are trying to figure out. Could simply flattening the plants by whatever meanscause these kind of effects? That's what I have a hard time with I don't see it happening.On the left is another cornstalk growth node w ith large cavities, but no bending. In contrast,on the right is a node with bending from phototropism which has no cavities. That bent node is closerto top of the same stalk. Many upper nodes on stalks, where significant stalk bending did occur dueto phototropism, had no cavities or splits.

It wasinteresting in the cases two years ago in Mission, B. C. (See: 10-01-02 Earthfiles; 10-03-02Earthfile s; 10-11-02 Earthfiles) which is not too far from this location in the same kind ofcattle corn again, we did not find these kinds of cavities in the nodes. There are twoformations again in the Mission location and we did not find any expulsion cavities. Butlast year we did find them in the formation at Abbotsford and the one farther east atAgassiz. The pattern at Abbotsford is what we called the large 'Trident' formation whichwas 300 feet long and quite impressive. In both of those and at Matsqui this year, we havefound the same growth node anomalies. Growth Nodes Sliced Off"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Another stalk with \"sliced\" node adjacent to an ear, as found in the field.Photograph © 2004 by Paul Anderson, CCCRN.The other thing that we found was not just the expulsion cavities, but also a lot of stalkswhich have been cut off or sliced off usually at the first or second node above the ground.It always seems to be through the node. It's not through the stalk between nodes, but whereyou have a clean cut right through the center of a node and the stalk is simply cut off.Sometimes it's laying on the ground beside what's remaining of the standing plant.Sometimes it's not. The thing that gets me is that there are so many of these. We foundquite a few of them just scattered all through the Matsqui formation, right close to thecenter of the central circle where there was one stalk in particular that was bent, not at anode, but just bent in the stalk several inches above the ground.Then at the first node past that bend, it was cut off just like all the other ones. You havethis stalk that is sticking straight up out of the ground and then bent 90 degrees and then it'sjust lobbed off. There were many others similar to that scattered randomly throughout theformation that are cut off at the first node.THIS IS MATSQUI THAT HAS THE CIRCLE AND TWO CRESCENTS ON EITHERSIDE .That's right. Again, that's a formation we haven't seen in Canada before, not just in B. C.,but any place. Crescents have never been a common feature, so again that makes thisformation unusual in that regard. But it's the growth node anomalies that we have found forat least the past two years now that have yet to be explained. Could Triangle and Diamond Cavities BeProduced by Mechanically Flattening Cattle Corn?A crop specialist with Agriculture Canada in Ontario has been examining samples of thesimilar node anomalies from Abbotsford and Agassiz in 2003, with no conclusions yetother than that they do not appear to be 'normal' insect, disease or physical stress damageto the plants, in his opinion.Laurel Leaman-Konrad and Jo Slingerland with CCCRN British Columbia have done agreat job collecting plant samples and what we're doing next is a test of manually flatteningother paths in this same cattle corn crop in the same field, but a long distance from theformation. We wanted to do that test to see what would happen because there is quite a bitof debate about whether manually flattening the corn plants like that could produce thosekinds of affects. I should add that it isn't just openings in the nodes, but if you look at thephotographs, you can see that the outer casing of the node has swollen out and expandedand become distorted and quite deformed.IF THIS DIAMOND PATTERN IN THE GROWTH NODES IS THIS DISTORTED, THATWOULD SUGGEST THAT PERHAPS THE ENERGY WHICH INTERACTED WITHTHE MATSQUI, B. C. FORMATION IN CATTLE CORN IS EVEN GREATER THANTHERE HAVE BEEN IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD.Maybe. But it could turn out there is a prosaic explanation for this which is why we aredoing our field test (to flatten corn manually) and we're going to keep track of the cropover the next few weeks to see if any type of effects like this do some how happen. Theproblem is I'm having a hard time working out how this would occur.PAUL, WE HAVE BEEN SEEING EXPULSIONS IN GROWTH NODES IN ENGLAND,THE UNITED STATES, CANADA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD FOR MORETHAN A DECADE."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"That's right.IF THESE DIAMOND-SHAPED EXPLODED NODES WERE NATURALLYOCCURRING, DON'T YOU SUPPOSE WE WOULD HAVE SEEN THEM BEFORENOW IN CANADA AT MATSQUI?If this was simply a naturally occurring after-effect of the plants being flattened down, Iwould tend to expect to see these a lot more often. And yet we have not. And we've hadthem in corn in particular.One thing I forgot to mention is previously regarding the expulsion cavities and thesediamond nodes is that we did find a few along the outside edge of one of the crescents inthe circle and two crescent formation. These are plants that were still standing and neverflattened. So, of course this is something biophysicist Levengood has said for a long timecould be a spill over of energy into the standing crop and I had looked at other standingcrop outside the formation as well. I couldn't find any except on that one edge of thecrescent, there are a few standing plants that have these same kind of cavities in them.Exactly what that means, we don't know yet, but it would suggest to me at the very leastthat this is not an affect caused by a flattening process because these are standing stalks.They were never touched. Again, as you know, these have been found in other formationsas well.I THINK IT IS AN IMPORTANT POINT TO STRESS YOU ARE GOING TO DO ANEXERCISE TO SEE IF YOU CAN PRODUCE THESE DIAMOND NODES IN PLANTSMECHANICALLY. BUT RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE JUST MADE THE ARGUMENTTHAT YOU HAVE FOUND THE SAME KIND OF DIAMOND DISTORTED NODEEXPLOSIONS IN PLANTS THAT WERE STANDING.That's right. And as far as we know right now, just along the outside edge of the crescentformation not farther out. I do want to go back again and take a longer look at more plantsoutside the formation. That's where it stand at the moment, but it's another piece of thepuzzle.\"More Information:Other Earthfiles Reports About Canadian Crop Formations· 07/25/2004 -- 2004 Canadian Crop Formations: Scorched Soybeans and \"Dirt\"Pattern in Barley· 05/24/2004 -- Biophysicist W.
