Plane Crashes Jim: Also, during that period, two airline pilots and the son of one of them came outand wanted to put a landing strip on our land in exchange for my use of their plane. Iagreed. About three weeks later, one of them and two others were killed in a crashnearby in clear weather. The plane was found in the daytime, but I don't know if ithappened in the day or at night. Others who have inquired deeply into themutilations, I understand, have disappeared, including the editor of a magazine whowas never seen again. I also understand that two National Guard interceptors wereup close to here and went down while in pursuit of a UFO at night. All of this was alittle unnerving, so I decided I was going to stop my own inquiry. I was going to justquietly mind my own business. 17. Nine Disks Land in Front of House Jim: The forest ranger, David, from California, came again to visit. It was late atnight, about 2 a.m. Almost all of these incidents have happened at night. We havenever seen anything during the daytime. Peggy and Harry were also visiting. Ninedisks landed in the front yard and I got a very clear view of them. They matchedexactly one of the pictures I had seen in a book I have. Harry and Barbara were atthe window and David was asleep in the bedroom. I called for David and I startedout the front door. I was walking toward them as Barbara and Harry watched fromthe window. Barbara: Harry and I were watching from the window, both from the same window.What I can't figure out is that Jim and I saw such a large array of them, but Harrysaw large, dark football shapes as if they were blocking part of the view. We weretrying to see what would happen in the whole area and watching Jim walk out whichI didn't want him to do. I have no awareness of what happened as far as what anyoneelse saw from that point on. My face was close to the glass and something hit me inthe forehead a forceful impact like something hit me. I was knocked back off thecouch and fell on the floor. Harry saw light out of the corner of his eye, and Jim saidhe saw a flash of light. I didn't see it. Jim: Harry yelled to me and I said I saw it. Harry said, 'It's Barbara. It's Barbara.'And I went running back to the house and found her in the middle of the floor. Barbara: The next thing I remember after looking out and seeing them was Jimputting a flashlight in my eyes to see if I had a concussion. Jim: While I was working over Barbara on the floor, they disappeared. I thoughtabout it subsequently and wondered why they (disks) did not do it to me since I wasthe one walking toward them. But then, I began to understand that they did the mostpractical thing that could be done to get me back inside and get both people awayfrom the window. And I think I really began to respect how clever they were. Then I began to suspect that maybe the government was doing it to us. Except thatthere were a lot of unusual things. For instance, David had been paralyzed during theincident. He could hear us calling, but could not get up until it was over. But then, hewent out walking with me and what we call ultrasonics the extremely high-pitchedsounds were going on out there and continued all night. David was sick then forthree days. The sound would sometimes give us headaches, but not all of us all at"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"once to different individuals at different times. 18. Box With Blinking Lights Jim: I went back to the law officer (Sheriff George Yarnell's Deputy, Bill Waugh)and had a talk with him and he started telling me about some of the incidents thathad happened again and about how he had pictures. He said they have a box and hehad seen it on occasion. He had seen blinking lights, where there should not be any,in trees and such. He said he was out on a patrol one night and he saw, in a group oftrees, this box that was blinking. He said he did not want to go in alone, so he racedback to town and picked up another law officer to go with him. When he got back,the trees were gone, the box was gone, everything was gone. He thought they hadgone into the ground. He had seen things go into the ground before. He is reasonablyconvinced that they just go into the ground. I've never seen that happen. 19. Black Box Makes Angry Sounds Jim: There is one piece of what you might call physical evidence on the ranch; thereis a big burned spot on the top of the hill approximately 35 feet across where nothingwould grow the first year. It is beginning to grow in a little now. On a compulsion,the older boy, Joe, and I drove up there one night and parked at the circle. In thetrees, a bright yellow light not bright, I guess, but a little dim yellow looked like anold car headlight. It just shined on the car. The back was toward the trees. We gotout and walked over and there was a box on the ground. I told Joe to stay back aboutten feet. It was making a buzzing sound just like zzzzzz and there was light like insideit, but not on it. Hard to describe. It was night, but there was a full moon and as I walked to about four feet from it, itchanged its tone entirely. It sounded like a bunch of angry bees. The sound went up,so I backed away and I told Joe to go back to the car and watch me as I walked up tothe box. We then walked back to the car and I told Joe that whatever happens, donot leave the car. Then I walked back and the box was gone. Following that is thepart that Barbara prefers that I leave out. Barbara: Absolutely! Investigator: Are you leaving it out because it's personally embarrassing or becauseit's terrifying? Jim: Too incredible. That's the part that is too kooky, frankly. And she requestedthat I did not talk about it. And I don't think that close encounters of the third kindare really interesting to anyone except to whom they happen. Barbara: If something should happen, something should go wrong and our namesshould be connected with this, I could face it. But I could not face this othersituation. And I'm too psychologically upset almost destroyed by this whole thinganyway. I'm trying very hard to keep from feeling that I have experienced somethingthat I did not experience or did I experience it and can't remember? Or what? (At this point, Barbara is shaking so badly she can hardly light her cigarette. She hasbeen practically chain smoking since the beginning of the narrative.) 20. Large Bird, Dog Notes Strange Scent Jim: There were quite a number of other things. I think they fit pretty much into apattern. One afternoon, I went out walking in the woods and I saw a bird that wasabout three fee tall. I got one clear side of it. It was brown and had three feather-likeappendages on its head. We have a whole set of animal books and I went throughthem trying to track it down. I did not find that any such animal existed on earth as Iknew it. I tried to follow it and it went around those rolling hills and was gone. I came back to the house, and as I was coming through the fence, there was a slightsnowstorm. We have this huge coon hound and as I approached the fence, the kidssaw me coming (they could just see me barely in the snow). The dog saw me andcame running. When he got to the fence, he stopped and started barking andgrowling when he got close to me. When I passed, he picked up some kind of anodor and was not letting me through the fence. That scared the kids and they wentrunning into the house, thinking that something was coming. They could just see theshape on the hill. The dog was still not letting me through the fence, even though Iwas talking to him. It took three or four minutes of hard talking before my own doglet me through the fence. And I had been crawling all around where this unusualbird-like thing had been."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" I really thought about what it could be or how it could be, and I've come up with nodata at all, except that it was a very unusual animal. Then it was just gone. I don'thallucinate, you know. I mentioned that I took acid, but I've never had a conscioushallucination in my life, that I'm aware of. And I'm sure that if I had, it would beover more than birds at the ranch because I never had them (hallucination) off theranch. 21. Buzzing Sound Comes into House Jim: One night very late, I was lying on my couch it was a particularly black night,no moonlight, no stars. I told Barbara that there was not much sense in my stayingawake because I could not see anything anyhow. I used to wait for the chickens tocrow to go to sleep. It really messed up my schedule because I felt that some how Ihad a duty to protect everybody. I slept with a shotgun all night. When I lay down onthe couch, there was just enough light remaining to see a little. I looked up and rightat the window - there was no place to stand as it was a high window was the outlinedshape of a man looking at me. He had on some tight-fitting apparel. I could not seeany colors, just the black outline. I got up and I went to Barbara's bedroom. Barbara: He rapped on the door. Most of what I have told you is what happened tome. this is the other thing that happened to me and me alone. I had the same thing:the blood pressure, the heart beat, the difficulty breathing. I was sitting straight up inbed when Jim rapped on the door. I was trying to light a cigarette and I dropped thematch on the bed in my state of terror. I opened the door and he came in and saidthat he had seen something strange out in front and wondered if I was all right. I toldhim I was having the same kind of symptoms and that I was very concerned that Iwas developing a heart problem. But I had gone in and had tests and they said no. Iwas very tense, but nothing else was wrong. Jim: She was very upset, so I sat down on the bed and asked if there was anythingthat I could get her. I took her pulse and sat and talked to her. When we have hadreally close contact at the house, it is hard to describe the feeling. People getnaturally upset; they don't see anything, but as part of the pattern, I figured shewould be upset when I went to the bedroom, and she was. I had put a big black chairin front of the front door. We were sitting in there just talking and the front dooropened and it hit the chair with a bang. And I jumped up and went running in thefront room and the door was closed again. I went back in the bedroom and I satdown on the bed and I was telling her that it was just the wind or something. The next thing was this voice that came inside of my head just like a loudspeaker. Itsaid, 'We don't need to open your door to come into your home.' I don't remember ifthat was the exact wording. I told Barbara what I had just heard and she looked atme in a funny way. Barbara: I thought he was losing it I'll be honest. He knows I thought that. Jim: And then a noise started in the front room like a buzzing noise like bees. Barbara: It came all the way through the house to right outside my bedroom door.This I heard, too. Jim: She was holding on to my arm until she gave me black and blue spots and Ifrankly did not want to get up and go into the kitchen to see what it was. I was gladshe was holding on to me. And the sound just went away then, nothing more. I wassure that something was going to come into the bedroom, but it did not. 22. Huge, Cone-Shaped UFO Barbara: We were going into town very early one morning just after daybreak andjust at a sharp bend in the road I think Charlie was the first one that saw it. He said,'Look at that big thing over there!' I looked and Harry looked and it wascone-shaped. I could not tell you the size because I don't have the ability to judgesize. I did not think of what it could be. I thought maybe a weather balloon, orwhatever. But I didn't really pay any attention. I told Jim about it. He had gottensome books at that time. He had one that had a picture of a cone-shaped one (UFO)and that's exactly what it looked like. Jim: From the description I got from all three of them, it was immense. It washundreds of feet, at least, across. It was six times the apparent size of a farmhouseone-quarter mile away, you know, in comparative sizes. It was a huge ship."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"23. Hairy Creature Mimics Barbara Barbara: I had only one other sighting of the animal that they described to you. Iassume from what I saw later that what I saw carrying the box was the animal onlybecause it looked like that would be what it was that is an assumption. We have hadno less than twenty people see 'Big Foot' at the ranch. Jim stepped out onto the porch without turning the porch light on. I was in the diningroom and he rapped on the window several times without turning around and I sawhim and went to the door and opened it and came out behind him. He led me into theporch and said, 'If you want to see one, I can show you where it is.' And he startedlining up the trees. The living room light was not on, but the dining room one was casting sort of anoblique light. I leaned forward to look out and Jim said, 'Right between those twotrees look very closely.' I do not have 20-20 vision with my glasses on, but I couldsee it. It was hunched over, and as I leaned out to look at it like this (demonstrates)using my hand to shade my eyes, it leaned out and went exactly like that to me(mimicked her). It was large and it was stooped down and it did lean down and gojust exactly like I did. Jim: The only night that we saw a large number of them was the night we picked upthe kids at school. We were going back to the ranch. Do you remember when thatmeteorite came down over Colorado some time last year? We got a very clear viewof that. It was right ahead of us on the road. It exploded and came down right infront of us. It looked to me like it hit the ranch. We got to the ranch and talked aboutit and heard about it on TV. I would swear it was magnesium it flared that brightlywhite. 24. You Can Arouse Their Curiosity; Voice from the Stereo Jim: We have some friends from Texas who got a pretty big 'jolt' at the ranch. Barbara: They have had some very serious problems develop because they werethere when a very bad thing happened. Jim: Trust me to tell what I want to tell, will you? Barbara: All right. Non-Human Entities Are Bothered by Silver Metal? Jim: We have been guaranteed confidentiality the man (deputy) is a professional. Iknow how to upset 'them,' and a lot of the things that scare Barbara involve theirtaking punitive action against us. I found that when I had guests that I wanted to seesomething, I could get a stack of wires and go out and get very busy with them like Iwas putting something up (building). We would go back to the house and watch andwithin a short period of time, they (non-humans) would be up there checking outwhat we did. Everyone could get a view of them. I did it several times, as sort of halfa joke. Dan, the friend from Texas, was giving the old 'you're not giving me that kindof junk, are you?' Electronics is his field and he is a computer expert with a largecompany. He is impressed with his own self-importance. Well, I went up deliberatelyto stir them up. I found that certain elements very much upset them. One example issilver, being the main element (that bothers them.) I have a large collection of Indiansilver jewelry and I discovered inadvertently that they shy away from silver. So, I went up to the circle, the burned spot, and struck silver bracelets in the groundalong with the wires. Likely, I was putting up something intense. Then I came backto the house and we were all sitting playing Risk. I did not know what wouldtranspire, but I hoped I would upset them. About two in the morning, the lights went out in the house, right on schedule. Thisvoice came out of nowhere again and it was not FM. It was obviously intended to beterrifying and sounded like a computerized voice very mechanical-sounding. It wascoming out of every radio and TV speaker in the house. We were sitting right in frontof a console stereo and the voice came out of it. I can almost recite the wordsexactly. They are burned into my memory:'Attention. We have allowed you to remain. We have interfered with your livesvery little. Do not cause us to take action which you will regret. Your friendswill be instructed to remain silent concerning us.'"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Barbara: That's very close. Jim: That's just about the words. Well, Dan was extremely thrilled when the lightscame back on because he said, 'Now, I'm in my field.' He asked if he could takeapart our TV set and stereo. Barbara: He was quite good electronically; he guaranteed that anything he tookapart, he could get back together again. Jim: He started to dismantle it. He went through the whole unit and he said that hecould not figure it out, but that his technicians in Texas would be able to when he gotback. He checked and the stereo was off. The phonograph was on when the lightswent off, but the radio receiver part was off. It was on 'Phono.' We found out thatthe type of transmitter it would take, from even close range, to cause a signal of thatintensity to go through the house would be beyond our means to ever put up. Barbara: Bud Dan was still sure that it was a hoax. His wife and children were allupset and crying and Dan took his daughter off into another room and told her thatthey needed to find out if it was a trick or not. He told her to go back out and tell usshe was frightened and wanted to leave immediately. He thought that if she actedupset enough and if we were playing a trick on them, rather than ruin the wholevacation, we would admit it. I got very upset and said that they could not start back to Texas in the middle of thenight and I would call a friend in town to see if they could stay there. Then Dantalked to his daughter and they all calmed down and they stayed. He just told us thisweekend that he knew if it was going to ruin the whole vacation, and if it had been atrick, we would have admitted it to him. He had decided - to save his own sanity thatit was somebody else with a massive capacity pulling a hoax on us and that we weregullible enough to go for it. Barbara: Needless to say, Dan never found the trick. He went over the wholehouse. He even dumped the laundry bags. He went over everything. I was glad thehouse was clean.\" Continued in Part 4 Don't Trust Your SensesCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
