Source: International Arctic Research Center (IARC). November 2, 2004 Fairbanks, Alaska - More than 250 scientists and six circumppolarorganizations, which have participated in the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, will meetNovember 9-12, 2004, in Reykjavik, Iceland, to discuss recent warnings in theInternational Arctic Research Center's (IARC) new report prepared for the eight nationsaround the Arctic Circle: Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Swedenand the United States.Submarines have been used to collect data about Arctic sea ice which has shrunk by 40%over a forty year period from 1960 to 1999. Global Climate Model Projects shown aboveindicate that for the foreseeable future, the temperature trend at the North Pole isever-upward. Thus, the projection that beginning around the summer of 2060, all Arcticocean ice will melt to a vast sea. What will polar bears and seals hunt from? What willhappen to the 600 million birds that breed every year in the far north? Are those animalsand others threatened with extinction now that global warming at the poles seems to be thefuture trend.Human populations will also be affected. Buildings and roads will rise, sink and crack asthe permafrost melts. Nicola Saltman, a program leader of climate change at the WorldWildlife fund, says the new data means, \"Life on Earth will change beyond recognitionwith the loss of the ice sheet at the North Pole\" for the summer months. \"This report showsthat climate change is happening now and highlights the urgent need for immediate action,starting with the Arctic governments, who must reduce their CO2 emissions.\"As the ice melts entirely at the Arctic, the dark waters will not reflect back as muchsunlight as the ice and snow has. So, as the ice disappears, the region will absorb more ofthe sun's energy and heat up more causing more melt."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Melting North Pole photographed by NOAA NetCam#1, on July 15, 2004,at 4:45 UTC.
