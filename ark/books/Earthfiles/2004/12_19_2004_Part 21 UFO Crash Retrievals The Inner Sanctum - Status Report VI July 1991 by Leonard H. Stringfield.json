COMMENTARY: CYNTHIA HIND (continued): \"When I arrived in Johannesburg on the 28th of December, there were no messageswaiting for me at my hotel. I phoned Van Greunen and there was no reply.Periodically, throughout the day of the 29th, I continued to call him, but there wasnever any response. Subsequently, on the 13th of January 1990, Prier Wintle lent me his copy of VanGreunen's NUFORIN magazine in which he had announced that I would be speakingat the Johannesburg Hotel at 8:00 PM on the 29th of December. He had alsowritten, 'The tickets can be obtained from the Conference Director, NUFORIN, P.O. Box 17230, Hillbrow 2038 and are R20 per ticket.' I have since learned fromDavid Powell of Pretoria that about 20 people turned up on the night and werefurious at being duped. I have now received a letter from a well-known UFO book seller in the USA, tellingme that Van Greunen had purchased about U. S. $540 worth of books from him. Hehad paid by check but the check had been returned marked, 'Account Closed.' The case sounds rather like a Steven Spielberg scenario to me, not because I don'tbelieve it possible, but because of many disconcerting factors.a) I obtained some documents from a highly respected investigator and I amsurprised that a top-secret document in the SAAF (South African Air Force)would be in English and not in Afrikaans, the language of the government. b) A list of 'hieroglyphics' allegedly found inside the craft were amateurishlydrawn and the spelling errors unforgivable. The SAAF would never passanything like this; they are an intelligent and well-educated force. The list is signed by none other than J. Van Greunen, although in this instance,he has suddenly become Captain James Van Greunen, South African AirForce Intelligence. Spelling errors are rampant: 'iniahalation,' 'dissapation,' 'dessert,' 'populace,''eminating,' etc. c) The document tells of Squadron Leader - who was in one of the Mirages.There is no such rank in the SAAF. Squadron Leaders are in the Royal AirForce. A call from the United States did alert me to something positive in this report. ANew York MUFON member told me that there had been a report from a man inBulawayo,m Zimbabwe about a light coming down on the Botswana, South Africanborder on the 7th of May 1989. I have managed to contact the person concerned,who is with the Met Office in Zimbabwe and reports to the Smithsonian Institute inWashington. I have been in contact with him and he is almost certain that what he"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"saw on that night was a 'fireball,' but he has to check out his records first and I amawaiting his confirmation of the sighting and what exactly it was. In conclusion, I can only say that in my opinion, the story is one big 'con.' It is eitherdisinformation deliberately set out or Van Greunen has personal dreams of grandeurand, most likely, made the whole thing up.\" Len Stringfield continues. 6) THE 'HENRY' AZADEHDEL/VICTORIAN REPORT Henry (the simplest among his other names) has emerged into a high-profile researcherinternationally using both phone and fax to communicate. Henry is not shy or soft-spokenand to some newcomers on the receiving end of his phone call, his bluntness might painthim as the 'tough cop' type. Well, that type would have pleased Dr. Allen Hynek,astronomer. I remember Alan telling me that what we need in research is 'more of thetough cop types - the kind that gets to the bare facts, the truth or else, from UFOwitnesses.' But, Henry is not a tough cop. When you get to know him, he can besoft-spoken, diplomatic and reasonable. If anybody knows the whole story on the South African affair, it's Henry. On my request,he sent me a statement with attachments dated June 10, 1991, covering his actions in thecase. Maybe the case, despite Van Greunen, is not closed yet. Henry Azadehdel, June 10, 1991: \"A report relating to the UFO crash in SouthAfrica on May 7, 1989, has been the subject of a great deal of controversy since itspublication in an article written by Mr. Tony Dodd, the Director of Investigation ofQuest International. Mr. Dodd's report at that time in many ways raised a greatnumber of questions, basically due to the nature of sophisticated technologyinvolved in this particular retrieval. In this report, I would explain, in brief, whatactually took place. We are fully aware that every report relating to such an incidentwould always create confusion, disbelief, and that the reporters who try to relate thecase, would always be subjected to various types of allegations or characterassassination from the quarters, which are either over eager to have a participatingrole, or others who have none or little knowledge about the military and intelligencestructure, method and policy designed and designated to tackle incidents such as aUFO crash/retrieval. I became involved in the South African UFO crash case after Mr. Tony Dodd sentme a complete report of what he was sent from South Africa in 1989. Later on, aMr. Van Greunen came to England with his family and stayed at my place for almosttwo weeks. During the course of these two weeks, a great deal more informationwhich was given to us by him was scrutinized. Mr. James Hendrik Van Greunen'srole in this incident roused our suspicion from the very beginning. There were simplyseveral areas that we had discovered independently, which were not agreeable withwhat he was telling us. Eventually, I decided that I had tolerated him long enoughand had to ask him to leave. In the course of our own independent investigation, we discovered Mr. Henry J.Greef. I personally talked to him several times. He gave me some information whichwas totally new to the case, as well as leads that could be followed. Greef explainedsome of the black and white photographs taken from the site of the incident andpromised to re-photograph or copy and send them to us. From the very firsttelephone conversation with him, he made references to the files he was handling onthe case as well as a firsthand, rather high-ranking individual, as source of hisinformation. At the time, when all this was happening, another investigation wasprogressing. I had started my own inquiries through Wright-Patterson, with variousoffices and through my own contacts. The flight dates and times of the two GalaxyC-5s which were the carriers were confirmed. Also, I managed to talk to anindividual who had been sent to South Africa as part of a team after the QuickReaction Teams (QRT) were dispatched. He was totally shocked and surprised. Infact, he was more eager to learn from me about what I knew than answering myquestions. The UFO was brought down by an experimental NDEW. The existence ofsuch weapon is no longer the question as explained before. In my last conversationwith J. Miller at Kirtland about NDEW's, he confirmed their existence. Today,records and information on Gypsy is in my possession and confirms such ongoingprograms and projects. Greef was a credible source for further information. Also, having obtained thetelephone number of the Chief of Military Intelligence in South Africa through oursources, my telephone conversation with him reconfirmed the validity of the case. Inmany ways, it was somewhat amusing. He was totally confused and shaken from my"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"unexpected and untimely telephone call, especially that I had managed to getthrough to him through his direct line by-passing his administrative shield. He askedme: why do I want to know about it, what do I want to know about it? He pressedhard to learn how I came by the information. It was a desperate attempt to protectthe secrecy, to re-compose himself, and at the same time, try to find immediateanswers to my questions. His performance was a failure. He could not answer myquestions. Instead, without any pause or thought, hastily answered them withquestions which in fact gave me more information that I was expecting. A few weeks later, I was approached by another higher ranking officer of the SouthAfrican military intelligence who I will call JB. He stayed with me for three days.The information he gave us cleared a great deal of grey areas. We now had a clearerpicture of what had happened. After his departure to one of a previous Frenchcolony, I received other documents not from South Africa, but from Europe, whichin fact endorsed the case. There was never a PAINT used in order to demagnetize ordisarm the UFOs EM (electromagnetic) emission. Instead, an electronic barrier wasused. The crash of the helicopter reported was verified. But the reason was notclarified as to whether it was the UFO's EM emission or pilot's error or mechanicalfault. Mechanical means were used to open up the entrance, but no entities hadcrawled out. No South African civilian scientist had been given the permission orclearance to enter into the saucer. The Quick Reaction Teams had arrived there within a matter of a few hours sincethe UFO had also been tracked by NORAD. On this, I have an independenttelephone conversation with NORAD. My conversation with them in itself isinteresting in a sense that the person that I had talked to for a half an hour earlier,suddenly on a follow-up call in order to clarify some hitches, was not there andapparently had been on a holiday for a few days. The evidence which we gathered from independent military sources in U. S. and inSouth Africa, especially my own taped conversations with them, confirm theincident. None of the South African military personnel were allowed to participate inany detailed examination of the craft. A handful were escorted each timeindividually by members of QRT to see the inside of the craft. Certain agreementswere made between the governments of the U. S. and South Africa before the saucerwas flown out to WP/AFB. No cash exchange between the two countries was made.The report issued by the U. S. Space Command on our request about the possibilityof a re-entry was also contradictory from that of Naval Space Surveillance Center's.U. S. Space Command gives the impact location as: Lat. - 18.0 degrees (S), andLong. -41.1 degrees (E). Rev. number 181, descending to southwest. Whilst Naval Space Surveillance Center mentions the impact location Lat. -46.6degrees North. Long. 15.4 degrees East, and Rev. number 94. There is alsodifferences in impact time. USSPACOM 0119Z. NAVSPASUR 1101Z. In their replydating December 13, 1989, AF Space Command says that our request could not begranted because it falls within NORAD's jurisdiction. Yet, in another letter, datingDecember 11, 1989, U. S. Space Command and yet another office has given us thedetails of a Russian rocket body which made re-entry, but its point of impact is milesaway from the actual UFO incident. In brief, for odd reasons, AF Space Commandeither deliberately or unknowingly are creating a confusion. Bearing in mind that lastyear, NORAD did release some records on UFOs to Robert Todd. I pursued thematter and upon Appeal more data was disclosed. (See; Just Cause, Number 24,June 1990.) The most important information released to us came from the member of the SouthAfrican Military Intelligence. For obvious reasons, I am not at liberty to mention hisname. I am sure those researchers who have been doing similar work would supportthe reasons. he explained what had happened in brief. Presumably, Greef passedsome of this information together with details of the format of the documents to VanGreunen. The five-page documents, represent most of the information correctly. Onthe U. S. side, OSI had been involved as well as QRT, FTD, Logistic Commandsection of WP/AFB which supplied the logistics, as well as the Tactical WingCommand in WP/AFB. In the course of several conversations with a source in thelogistic section of the WP/AFB, it has now been established the type of logisticalmaterial supplied for the operation. At no time were the entities medically examinedby South African military MDs, nor was there any aggression from their (entities')side. Quite the opposite, the entities seemed to be timid, confused or frightened. Thedescription of the entities are correct as given in the 5-page documents. The Greytype. Experimental Weapons Attack on UFO?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" The other significant point to be made is that it has not been established (to us)whether the use of an experimental weapon alone was the cause to bring the craftdown. The craft, after receiving the first round of attack, did not react in any fashionto defend itself. It is presumed that it was already experiencing some difficulties andthat the attack expedited its downing. The pilot who carried out the initial attack hastold us that he used the weapon only once. In my last telephone conversation with Greef, he was clearly worried. He was tryingto be polite on one hand; on the other to protect his skin. I had noticed some sharpalteration in his attitude in volunteering information. He now was trying to distancehimself, whilst being an intelligent individual, as he was, and knew only too well thattoo much had already been spilled. One of my contacts told me that he no longerlives there. Usually his sister answered the phone and then passed the receiver toHenry Greef. But the voice was that of a male which I could not identify. But, in myvery last conversation with Greef, he was clearly shaken and frightened. He tried toplay the entire case down and said that he had nothing to do with it, that I should nottrust Van Greunen. Taking the situation into consideration, I could understand thereasons behind it. Van Greunen had betrayed him. This report on the South African UFO crash is what so far we have been able tounravel. There are still various areas that we simply cannot make public for obviousreasons. As far as we are concerned, the work on the case has not been completedyet. I submit this report on the merit of a researcher. It is up to the individuals todraw their own conclusion on the case. On the final note, what adds to the complexity of the case is a sighting of a fireballin Zimbabwe on May 7, 1989, 2145 GMT, plus the re-entry of the FOTON 2Rocket. Once more, it demonstrates the maze UFOlogists find themselves in whenthey try to make some sense out of a case.\" Correspondence by \"Henry Azadehdel,\" also known as \"Armen Victorian\": Above: July 1991 fax from Armen Victorian, England, to Len Stringfield,Cincinnati, Ohio,with below: attached Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) reply from NASA."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Above: December 11, 1989 letter from United States Space Command, PetersonAFB, Colorado,to \"Dr. Henry Azadehdel,\" Nottingham, England.
