Dr. Crain was at the same time employed by the U. S. Navy's DOD NavalResearch Laboratory. His rank was Captain and his title Microbiologist IV. A year later in1990, he married Deborah Kay Burisch who had a child from a previous marriage. Fiveyears later in 1995, Danny B Crain legally changed his last name to Burisch to match thechild's legal last name.Between 1991 and 1994, Dr. Burisch began an extraordinary assignment five floorsunderground the Papoose Mountain range at S-4/5, Area 51, Nellis AFB in Nevada. Dr.Burisch says he was suited up in astronaut-type gear to enter a highly classified and secureclean sphere filled with an atmosphere of cold hydrogen, argon and other gases. Thatatmosphere was allegedly created to house what his superiors said was a time travelingextraterrestrial biological entity. According to Dr. Burisch, his microbiology research withthe being was reported to his Majestic 12 and MAJI Committee government employers, anextension of the Majestic-12 Special Studies Group organized by President Harry S.Truman in 1947. Majestic 12 included top scientific, military and business leaders asked byPresident Truman to study the extraterrestrial phenomenon.In those years, Dr. Burisch says he extracted more than 300 tissue samples from the arm ofthe extraterrestrial called \"J-Rod.\" The name derived from the creature pointing at"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"computer keyboard symbols for the letter \"J\" and for the rod-like inertia symbol. Accordingto the entity's telepathic communication, the combined hieroglyphic symbols mean thenumber fifteen in his civilization which relates to the 15.2 light year distance from Earth tothe star in our Milky Way Galaxy known as Gleise 876. Around that star, according toJ-Rod, orbits a planet on which some of his species have based themselves. Our own Earthastronomers have discovered at least two planets orbiting Gleise 876.According to Dr. Burisch, he received telepathic communication from the J-Rod aboutserious medical problems that were forcing his species to extinction and which broughtthem back to Earth - their original home - in a mind-boggling effort to change a time lineproblem in our human present - and the J-Rods' ancient past.Dr. Burisch describes the J-Rod's medical problem as a \"peripheral neuropathy,\" whichcauses serious nerve damage. From all the tissue extractions, Dr. Burisch and his othermicrobiology colleagues were trying to develop a treatment that might help the timetravelers and change a potentially dangerous Earth future.Interview:Danny B Burisch, Ph.D., Microbiologist, during 1991-1994 at S-4/5, Area 51, GroomLake, Nellis AFB, Nevada: \"We would undergo a medical examination, at least during theearly time frame of the introductions of the 1991 to 1992 time frame when we were doingintroductions. We had regular systematic medicals by physicians. Following that, we wouldbe suited first, catheterized, plugged and suited. A communication apparatus was placed onour heads. There was a cooling system set up. For all intents and purposes, it was a spacesuit, a total encapsulated suit something like what you would find in a NASA facility. Notso much something you would see, for instance, at CDC (Centers for Disease Control)- notthat type of Level 4 suit. It was more a regular space-type suit with joints. We were suitedup, we were pressurized and then walked with our cooling system and our hosing down aramp into the Ambassadorial Suite (where J-Rod kept). Following that, we were lead up agantry way which had been moved into position by the Clean Sphere, which had beenpreviously rotated up through an iris through the floor.He (J-Rod) was held actually below the Ambassadorial Suite level and that was raised up asneeded. What they did with him down there, he did not say. And they (bosses) did not tellme. It was not a need-to-know issue. Apparently that's where they dealt with the cleaningof the Sphere and all that down there. It was regular housed-animal maintenance, as theytreated him.We would be lead up the gantry way. The hoses would be hooked into an interior systeminside the doorway that was exterior to the Clean Sphere. And it was called 'Six DegreeSystem.'We would be lead in. The door would be closed and we would be pressurized inside of thegantry way. Following that, there was a drug system that was set up. Once there was anequal pressurization between the gantry way and the Clean Sphere, we would then be toldto proceed forward. I would raise a hand in acknowledgment. We were not supposed to talkat the time at all because nothing verbal around the specimen, around the J-Rod. Why (noverbal)? I was never told, but we were not supposed to talk around the J-Rod.I moved the drug system and re-hooked a secondary set of hosing inside the Clean Sphere,checked the pressurization and once that was done, the door to the Clean Sphere would beclosed behind me and I would presume that the pressurization remained the same in thegantry way.Following that I would do my business inside the Clean Sphere involving contact with theJ-Rod and removing the samples (from the J-Rod.)\" Convergent Timelines ParadoxBut Dr. Burisch became upset when he was asked to apply what he was learning tobiological weapons research. In a whistle-blowing effort in the summer and fall of 2002, hebegan to leak information to Bill Hamilton, long time UFO investigator and formerExecutive Director of Skywatch International. That year, Bill confidentially played for meaudiotaped and videotaped interviews of Dr. Burisch talking about his J-Rod research andthe complicated threat that has come to be known as the Doctrine of Convergent TimelinesParadox.Dr. Burisch said he thought the public deserved to know that by December 2012, theuncorrected J-Rod problem could mean a disaster for Earth and humanity. Dr. Burisch saidthere was a problem in Time itself that the J-Rods were trying to repair in order to prevent"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"a global catastrophe. Dr. Burisch said he understood that the J-Rods' deteriorating physicalcondition was the result of a disaster that had already occurred on Earth that the J-Rodspreceded Homo sapiens sapiens.The catastrophe - past and future - came from one, two or three events - or all threetogether. Those included a very large energy flare from the sun at the same time our solarsystem encountered a swarm of naturally occurring mini-black holes, also called wormholes. A third event at the same time might have been a nuclear war on Earth. Thedestructive energy of all that happening split the Earth's time line into two branches thatallegedly still loop and circle each other to this day.According to Dr. Burisch's understanding of the time paradox, the DNA-damaged J-Rodsevolved down one of the split time lines and deteriorated into small, grey and brownskinned humanoids with four fingers and large black eyes that faced eventual extinction.On the other time line, another group of original humans evolved physically and spirituallystronger as a blond Nordic-looking race based in the stars of the Orion constellation belt.According to Dr. Burisch, if not repaired, the looping time line problem means that theEarth would keep experiencing cyclic destructions unless the loop is straightened out.Allegedly, our American government has been communicating with the J-Rods through aseries of treaties every nine years since 1958. Everyone has allegedly been trying to figureout how to prevent a current 2012 Earth catastrophe that would doom most humans andtime travelers.On June 7, 2003, Bill Hamilton was given permission by Dr. Burisch to videotape himtalking again about the J-Rod, clean sphere, and time paradox. The full transcript ispublished as a 3-part Earthfiles report with illustrations.Today, Dr. Burisch has been diagnosed with a heart condition and negotiated a deal withhis government handlers to retire on June 1, 2004, from official government service toMJ-12 and the MAJI Committee. With that recent retirement, he allowed me and half adozen others to go on a field trip with him in Las Vegas on May 30th to the site of his mostrecent research that was provoked by telepathic communication from the J-Rod about itsoriginal life on Earth.One of those communications guided Dr. Burisch to look for evidence of panspermia, theseeding of life, at the Vishnu Schist Great Unconformity on the eastern edge of Las Vegasin Frenchman Mountain. Rock layers there range from half a billion to 2.7 billion years old.Two years ago, Dan Burisch was at Frenchman Mountain when he was astonished to see aflash of light from a rock he was videotaping. That discovery lead to what he calls theLOTUS MODEL and STAAR FLOWER Projects. On our field trip, Dr. Burisch explainedwhat happened as we walked from the freeway up to the same rock layer where the energyburst occurred from rocks containing silicon dioxide quartz crystals.Bureau of Land Management and University of Nevada Las Vegas Department of Geosciencemarker for the Vishnu Schist Great Unconformity at Frenchman Mountain, Las Vegas, Nevada. In therocky hill beyond, we walked the path to the rocks where microbiologist Dan Burisch discovered abiophotonic burst of energy on May 31, 2001, while researching panspermia evidence.Photograph © 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe.Dan Burisch, Ph.D., Microbiologist, at Vishnu Schist Great Unconformity, Las Vegas,Nevada: \"If you activate the silicon dioxide in the proper way, there is an emission of theparticles.EVEN FROM RIGHT HERE?Sure. If my theory is correct, it's from all silicon dioxide. It literally accesses through theether, through the implicate structure of the universe into our material structure of theuniverse."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"BUT THAT SPECIFIC CRYSTAL (SILICON DIOXIDE)?The quartz crystals that we were working with here are alpha quartz after beta quartz. Wewere dealing specifically with octahedral crystals.YOU THINK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PART OF A LARGE INTELLIGENCEPLAN?I believe the octahedral structure acts as an antenna, if you will, yes. And given the factthat the octahedral structure is one of the five Platonic solids, as well as the base structurefor what you see huge groupings on a celestial scale of star clusters and galaxies throughthe universe. I believe it is an important structure. I'm not new in believing that.Octahedron (8 sides), one of the five Platonic solids andthe shape of the silicon dioxide quartz crystals that microbiologist Dan Burischexperimented with in his LOTUS MODEL research of life seeding by \"ganesh particles\"interacting with the quartz at French Mountain, Las Vegas, Nevada.Large silicon dioxide quartz crystals.\"Ganesh\" ParticlesBut the particles that we found are basically a combination current theories having to dowith \"inphotons\" biophotonic material that contains information. It happened right up here.It was being filmed with a standard video camera. What I was doing was I was playing withthe conductivity of the rock here. I was looking for something totally different from whatwe found. I was looking for a change in conductivity and associated particles trapped careful trapped in the rock. Specifically I was looking for biomarkers, DNA biomarkers.And we've got that huge biophotonic burst. The May 31st image where it looks like it isgreen you see this light burst (of rock) right there.WAS IT PURE LUCK?I added too much energy and the right amount of light, too much directed energy and theright amount of light and it was pure luck. I found the biophotonic burst and said, 'My God,we've got something different here than what I thought originally.'So, I suspended operations looking for the biomarker and started looking for a reason why Iwould have the biophotonic burst. At the time, I didn't call it a biophotonic burst. I justcalled it a burst of energy.We find when the right amount of energy is added together with the right wattage persquare area, we just get pure particle emission. And it's an extremely small millivoltage,right around 16.5 millivolts.\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Panspermia and Ganesh ParticlesThe burst of light energy at the Vishnu Schist rock in Las Vegas - which surprised Dr. DanBurisch - also gave him an insight about panspermia the seeding of life force on Earth andthroughout the universe. Dr. Burisch hypothesizes in his LOTUS MODEL that programmedenergy he calls \"ganesh particles\" travel in light and can interact with common silicondioxide quartz crystals the way radio signals interact with antennas.Dr. Burisch: \"It relates as a communication carrier from the other side, the void if youwill, to present day living organisms. Originally, I had thought we would be dealing withsomething left as a biomarker in the rock and I was going to look for differences, dependingupon the age. Hence, we had to make up our mind about where we were going to start. Thisis the oldest section (of the rock here) and it goes down to some 20 million years beforepresent down by Lava Butte. Everything from here on, we're up above a 550 million yearold area.What we did is originally, we thought it was going to be a biomarker and we would find aseparate biomarker in present day cells and attempt to match those biomarkers to whatcould have been a theoretical panspermia virus. What we found is an actual emission ofparticles from a Somewhere. When we found the emission of particles from a Somewhere, Isaid, 'OK, let's hold my mundane theory here for a second. We're going to start looking atthis super jazzed up data that we're getting. And that's where we've been working eversince.The Ganesh particle basically acts as a communication from Somewhere meaning the voidthat gets accessed under the right energy concentration, or the right light. We named it the'shiva.' It's just an operating name, the 'ganesh particle,' meaning 'mover of obstacles.'Then finally, we began to look at what the ganesh particles did to living cells and they infact imparted certain substances to the living cells. We named those substances which wereimparted and retained by the living cells as the 'vishnu' component. So, we had ourtriumvirate model, if you will, but I think you can tell by what I just said that it is totallydifferent than what we first imagined.IF I UNDERSTAND AT ALL, YOU ARE SAYING THAT IT IS THE FORCE BEHINDEVERYTHING HAS THE ABILITY TO SEND OUT SOMETHING LIKE A RADIO ORTELEVISION SIGNAL THAT IS PROGRAMMED WITH INFORMATION. WHEN ITINTERACTS WITH ANY SILICON DIOXIDE, IT'S GOING TO FILL THE SILICONDIOXIDE WITH A PROGRAM THAT CAN PRODUCE LIFE?Pretty accurate. Pretty accurate. Basically the silicon dioxide acts as an antenna which,when enough particles are oriented in the correct fashion hence, the right shaped crystal itacts as an antenna and opens a void, the particles are emitted, and yes, in fact they canmotivate the production of life from pre-existing proteins. Now, I do not know whether ornot they can motivate the production of life on their own. So, we do not have first life here.At least, we do not have data to support first life. But we have data to support productionof life from proteinaceous material.THE IMPLICATION IS THAT YOU HAVE FOUND MAYBE THE PROGRAMMINGMECHANISM FOR LIFE IN THIS UNIVERSE. BUT IT HAS TO BE ABLE TO BUILDWITH PROTEINS. WHAT WOULD MAKE THE PROTEINS?Well, originally these protein components could have been assembled in theory by theganesh particles, or by actions from the ganesh particles, from amino acids that could haverained here as part of a celestial rain. So, in other words, delivered by comets. So, in fact,the portion of the panspermia theory regarding the production of life on Earth fromdeposition of amino acids could in fact have played in with this model (of ganesh particles).ISN'T THE BIGGER IMPLICATION THAT IF THERE IS A FREQUENCY CARRIER OFLIFE PROGRAMMING THAT CAN GO INTO ALL SILICA DIOXIDES, THAN ITSHOULD BE ANYWHERE THERE ARE SILICA DIOXIDES IN THE UNIVERSE?Yes, m'am.\" Convergent Timeline ParadoxDr. Burisch said his discovery of the \"ganesh particles\" programmed with the Great Forceof Life could not directly help solve the J-Rod medical problems. If the J-Rods are facingextinction without a timeline change, I asked Dr. Burisch how the alleged different timelines of the J-Rods, the Blonds and humans (Homo sapiens sapiens) could be convergedinto one time line - without eliminating some of them?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"J-Rod drawn by Dan Burisch, Ph.D.,Microbiologist, based on face-to-face encounter in 1994inside clean sphere at S-4/5, Area 51, Nellis AFB, Nevada.Dan Burisch: \"Presently, they (J-Rods and Blonds) are simply traveling in time to comeback to this present time. So, we're not exactly existing in the same time line with them. It'sthe actions of time travel which cause the temporal paradoxes. Further than that, talk toBill Hamilton because he is the physics guy.BUT YOUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IF THINGS WORK, THREE OF THESE TIMELINES, SO TO SPEAK OURS, THE J-RODS AND THE BLONDS COULD COEXIST INA SINGULAR TIME LINE WITHOUT A CATASTROPHE IN 2012?Two time lines would co-exist. Our present time line and those from Orion and the J-Rods.They are concurrent in a time line because they were concurrent at the point ofcatastrophe.SO, THEY ARE CONCURRENT NOW AND THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TOCONVERGE IT INTO ONE IN WHICH THEY WILL REMAIN, FROM OUR POINT OFVIEW, EXTRATERRESTRIALS?Ye s , m' a m.AND WHAT WILL THAT ACCOMPLISH FOR THEM IF THEY ARE STILL VERYSICK?It won't. But it will accomplish for us in our reality of not having a catastrophe thatultimately splits our human species.IT WOULD END THE CYCLE?Yes, m'am. When it comes to the prevalence of the poly neuropathy and associatedconditions with the J-Rods, that's a totally separate issue and it's one that is still beingworked upon. It's one of the team that I was lucky enough to head I actually failed to findan answer to. However, there have been some significant inroads of late concerning theirbiology and so hopefully, we will have at least some treatment to alleviate their problems.\"Continued in Part 2 - ERB \"star gate\" on Frenchman Mountain, Nevada.More Information:See these previous Earthfiles.com reports:·· 06/08/2004 -- Part 3: Whistleblower Microbiologist Dan Burisch Interview on June7, 2003· 05/23/2004 -- Part 2: Whistleblower Microbiologist Dan Burisch Interview on June7, 2003· 05/19/2004 -- Part 1: Whistleblower Microbiologist Dan Burisch Interview on June7, 2003· 04/26/2004 -- Update About Microbiologist Dan Burisch, Ph.D.· 03/17/2004 -- Part 2 - \"Horrible Secret\" in UFO Crash Retrievals Near Roswell,New Mexico, in July 1947?· 11/19/2003 -- Updated - 1954 Manual: \"Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology\" -Reasons It Is Authentic· 09/15/2003 -- Part 3 - Whistleblower Microbiologist Speaks Out About Alleged\"Alien\" Named J-Rod· 09/15/2003 -- Part 2 - Whistleblower Microbiologist Speaks Out About Alleged\"Alien\" Named J-Rod· 09/15/2003 -- Part 1 - Whistleblower Microbiologist Speaks Out About Alleged\"Alien\" Named J-Rod· 10/05/2002 -- Part 2 - J-Rod and Microbiologist Danny B Burisch, Ph.D.· 10/05/2002 -- Part 1 - Two Scientists Describe An Extraterrestrial Biological EntityCalled \"J-Rod\"· 10/05/2002 -- Part 3 - More Background On the Scientists Linked To \"J-Rod\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"· 06/22/1999 -- The Strange Story of J-Rod, An EBEBrief BackgroundDan Burisch is a microbiologist who received his Ph.D. from the State University of NewYork, Stonybrook, in 1989.
