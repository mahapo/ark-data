Y. © 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe May 17, 2004 Long Island, New York - It was a year ago when a 63-year-old NassauCounty, Long Island, New York resident, who only wants to be known as \"Marjorie,\" readon the internet about a possible \"Planet X\" headed into our solar system. She had a JVCdigital camera she had purchased in the summer of 2001 and decided she would startphotographing after sunrise because she thought Planet X might be seen in the direction ofthe sun. Since January 2003, Marjorie says she has taken \"hundreds and hundreds ofpictures, but got nothing more than a few lens flares and little red dots. I just started to do itagain this year at the beginning of April .\" On Friday, April 23, 2004, around 7:30 a.m., Marjorie noticed how beautiful the sun wasbehind cloud cover and got her camera and a piece of dark welder's glass she uses whenshe aims straight at the sun. Her house is not near the ocean and toward the east, there areone-story houses as far as you can see. But her angle was higher in the sky. She took abouttwenty-five shots over a couple of minutes, sometimes zooming in, and was surprised whenshe looked at them. Between normal-looking images, there were two abnormal ones thathad a spiral of six lights right in front of the cloud-covered sun and a seventh, dimmer light,to the left. One frame was dark and one was lighter. I asked her about the differentexposures.

"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Interview: Marjorie, Nassau County, Long Island, New York residential area, not near ocean:\"I'm not an expert at all with these digital cameras. I just put it on the tripod and take thepicture and that's it. But what I noticed with this JVC digital camera is that when it's on theAutomatic setting, it comes out the lighter picture. When I put it on Manual, sometimes it'sdarker. And sometimes when I'm holding the camera in one hand and the welder's glass inthe other hand, my hand slips the mechanism from Automatic to Manual. When it's onManual, it comes out very dark because I guess that's a shorter exposure.I downloaded those two on my computer and it wasn't until I heard you on Coast to CoastAM the other night (Friday, May 14, 2004) and I went on your website and looked at thepictures from Mexico and saw the dots that reminded me of the pictures I had taken. So,that's why I e-mailed you because I don't know what they are. You can do what you wantwith them, Linda. But I don't know if they are something - or a camera abnormality. I'malso curious about the dimmer light to the left of the six lights and the little blue dot to theright.DID YOU SEE ANY OF THESE LIGHTS THROUGH THE CAMERA?No, I couldn't possibly because the glare was very strong. I put my own sunglasses on and Inever directly looked at the sun it is so dark when I have the welder glass that I really can'tsee much except it's bright.AND THE SUN WAS DIRECTLY BEHIND THE DARK CLOUD?Yes. Actually it looks darker in the picture because of the welder glass, but where thosebright objects are that would be directly where the sun would be.\" Marjorie me an example from other days of the sun and tree branches in a wide shot fromher back yard to show what her more normal photos look like. Marjorie sent this \"more typical\" photograph from the many digital sunrisesshe has photographed the past year prior to April 23, 2004."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"\"That morning (April 23), I didn't find anything unusual with the other pictures (before andafter the two anomalies) and deleted them. I only kept those two in the computer because Ithought they were different. But I wondered if it was something wrong in the camera or theexposure? I just couldn't believe this was something actually there.ARE BOTH TAKEN THROUGH THE WELDER'S GLASS?Yes, both through the welder's glass. And I'd zoomed in as close as I could with the zoom,but on digital cameras it isn't much.SO IN THE PAST YEAR AND THE HUNDREDS OF PHOTOS YOU HAVE TAKENAROUND SUNRISE, THESE ARE THE ONLY ANOMALIES SO FAR?Yes. Nothing else at all.YOU'LL KEEP PHOTOGRAPHING?Oh, yes, I've photographed since those two, but still nothing else.\" If anyone has taken any similar photographs, or has information about what could be infront of the sun and clouds,please contact: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
