Controllers at NASA'sJet Propulsion Laboratory received confirmation of the successful drive at 3:01a.m. Pacific Standard Time via a relay from the Mars Odyssey orbiter and Earthreception by the Deep Space Network. Cheers erupted a minute later whenOpportunity sent a picture looking back at the now-empty lander and showingwheel tracks in the Martian soil. Opportunity drove down a reinforced fabricramp at the front of its lander platform. Geology News - Opportunity Confirms Water-LinkedHematiteScientists were excited that Opportunity quickly detected crystalline grayhematite, a mineral produced in the presence of water. Planetary geologistssuspected that the Meridiani Planum might once have been a lake which is whythe landing site was selected for exploration.Gray granules covering most of the crater floor surrounding Opportunity containhematite, said Dr. Phil Christensen, lead scientist for both rovers' miniaturethermal emission spectrometers, which are infrared-sensing instruments used foridentifying rock types from a distance. Crystalline hematite is of special interestbecause on Earth, it usually forms under wet environmental conditions. The"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"main task for both Mars Exploration Rovers in coming weeks and months is toread clues in the rocks and soil to learn about past environmental conditions attheir landing sites, particularly about whether the areas were ever watery andpossibly suitable for sustaining life.The concentration of hematite appears strongest in a layer of dark materialabove a light-covered outcrop in the wall of the crater where Opportunity sits,Christensen said. \"As we get out of the bowl we're in, I think we'll get onto asurface that is rich in hematite,\" he said. Spirit Starts Working AgainFirst new panoramic camera images from Spirit rover on January 29, 2004.Images above credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell.NASA reports: \"These are the first images sent back from the panoramic cameraon the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit since the rover experiencedcommunications problems on January 21, 2004. They were acquired at GusevCrater, Mars, on Jan. 29, 2004. showing that the camera's health remainedexcellent during Spirit's recovery. Two of Spirit's potential target rocks, whichare near the rock called Adirondack, can be seen on the lower left and right. Therock on the left has been named 'Cake,' and the white rock on the right has beennamed 'Blanco.'Martian calibration target in which the green, orange, blue and red tabsmatch well to the same tab colors on Earth. This means that the redof the soil and rock colors are close to true color.\"Above the rock images is a calibration target, also known as the Martiansundial. The color panel of the calibration target looks almost exactly like it didon Earth, indicating that the color shown of Mars, though approximated, is closeto true color.\" Inside the NASA/JPL Mission Control RoomMatt Wallace, Mission Manager at JPL, said in today's press conference, \"Weknew it was going to be a good day.

JPL's Chris Salvo, MissionFlight Director, reported that Opportunity will be preparing over the next coupledays to reach out with it robotic arm for a close inspection of the soil.NASA said in its press release: \"The flight team needed only seven days sinceOpportunity's landing to get the rover off its lander, compared with twelve daysfor Spirit earlier this month. \"We're getting practice at it,\" said JPL's JoelKrajewski, activity lead for the procedure. Also, the configuration of thedeflated airbags and lander presented no trouble for Opportunity, while some ofthe extra time needed for Spirit was due to airbags at the front of the landerpresenting a potential obstacle.\" Spirit Rover Confirmed Olivine In Gusev CraterOne unexpected finding was Mössbauer spectrometer's detection of a mineralcalled olivine, which does not survive weathering well. The Mössbauerspectrometer identifies different types of iron-containing minerals. So far twodifferent iron ores have been confirmed in addition to olivine and some nickel, ametal which might have come from meteorite impacts.The lack of weathering suggested by the presence of olivine might be evidencethat the soil particles are finely ground volcanic material, scientists speculate.Another possible explanation is that the soil layer where the measurements weretaken is extremely thin and the olivine might actually be in a rock under the soil.We b s it e s :http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.htmlhttp://www.esa.int/export/esaCP/index.htmlhttp://athena.cornell.eduCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Republication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
