January 24, 2004 Milwaukee, Oregon - 2004 has begun with somespectacular sightings of unidentified sky objects over the Napoleon, Michigan,region not far from where an unusually large ice circle was found in December.See: Earthfiles 011604. The more I investigated the ice circle, the more Ilearned from local residents about mysterious lights and unidentified flyingobjects haunting the area for years. In my recent Earthfiles.com, Dreamland andCoast to Coast AM radio news reports, I have presented some of thoseeyewitnesses.This week, I received an e-mail from a businessman named Michael McNeil whohas lived in the state of Oregon all his life, most recently near Portland. Hise-mail contained descriptions of unusual flying objects that he, friends and hisfamily had seen over the years, including a large \"triangle of stars\" slowlymoving overhead that many other people have described since at least the1970s. He included a phone number and invited me to call if I had anyquestions about his e-mail.I did call him and asked if I could record his experiences on-the-record forEarthfiles.com and Dreamland. He began with his most recent sighting threemonths ago in November 2003. But to my surprise as has happened in otherinterviews over the years with normal citizens who have seen strange objects inthe sky the recall lead to even more startling memories of a close-up encounterwith non-human entities."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"(Michael's drawings will be added as soon as available.)Michael McNeil, Owner, Northwest Pen Works, Milwaukee, Oregon: \"Itwas a day in November 2003 and I noticed something that moved in my line ofsight over the roof of the neighbor's house. At first, I thought it was a Mylarballoon. I kept watching it. It moved oddly, like it was wobbling, like a child'stop. Then I noticed underneath that it had a brownish or maybe tarnishedcooper colored \"dome\" in the center of it that was about 1/3rd of the diameter ofthe whole craft. It was basically like a disk-shape, but the edges were rounded.The rest of the craft was silver colored.This thing was moving against the prevailing winds. The winds were blowingwest to east and this thing was moving from south to north towards me. Itdawned on me that it wasn't a balloon and that it was larger, plus it had thisdome protrusion on the bottom of it.So, I ran in the house to get a pair of binoculars and was probably in the housenot more than 15 to 20 seconds and ran back out to the same spot and this thingwas gone, like it had disappeared, only I wasn't there to see it.HAVE YOU SEEN ANY SMALL DISK CRAFT LIKE THIS BEFORE?Yes, one night, I saw a craft. Actually I was with my mother and sister. It waswhen I was going to college, so it must have been on Thanksgiving evening in1979 or 1980. I looked and I saw something. I could see it through the trees andit was over the top of them. And I said, 'Wow, that looks like a UFO!' I asked mysister to stop the car and my mother said, 'That does look like a UFO. Stop thecar!' So she did and pulled off to the side of the road and turned the engine offand this thing made no sound.It had large windows around it that were I don't know how big they wereexactly. It was probably 200 to 300 yards out over the large open field. Thewindows were like the proportions of a 4 x 8-foot sheet of plywood, but withrounded corners. I think the windows might have been a little larger than that.The light that came out of these windows was very intense, but it was the colorof tungsten lighting as you would see from outside the house at night kind of aslight yellowish-orangish color. I was trying to see through the windows to see ifI could see any humanoids inside this thing. It was kind of a hat box-shape ontop, circular, with flat sides where the windows were and then it tapered downfrom there and I couldn't see the underneath side of the craft, but it appeared tobe flat.It paralleled the Southern Pacific railroad tracks for a little ways, maybe like1/8th of a mile, and then it crossed over the highway and followed the highwayright over the top of it. We probably watched it for about 4 or 5 minutes and itheaded right over the top of a small little town. Then we got back in the car anddrove on.DID ANY OF YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU THOUGHT IT WAS ANDWHERE IT HAD COME FROM?Yes, we did. I guess we just assumed that it was extraterrestrial because the U. S.government, as far as I know, doesn't have anything remotely similar to it."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"IF IT WERE EXTRATERRESTRIAL THAT BIG, THAT CLOSE, WHAT DIDYOU THINK THE IMPLICATION WAS?I've always thought they were surveying the planet or something. I don'tunderstand what. WHEN YOU SAY THAT, IS THAT BASED ON SOME PERSONALEXPERIENCE WITH SOMETHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BENON-HUMAN?I had contact when I was probably about 11 years old. One night I was lying inbed in my folk's house and I wasn't asleep and I felt like there was something inthe room. I looked up and looked down at the end of my bed and there was thislittle guy about 3.5 feet tall standing at the end of the bed. I was scared, but Icouldn't yell. I wanted to yell for my folks. I felt there was something else and Ilooked at the other corner at the foot of the bed and there was another onestanding there. I was just frightened out of my mind, but I could not speak. I wastotally awake. I wanted to scream or yell or something, but it was like my vocalcords would not work or I could not get them to work as hard as I tried.They (entities) moved in an odd fashion. They moved like in jerky motions. It'shard to explain, but they bobbed their heads and upper bodies forward inperfect unison as they were coming toward me. One of them started speaking tome in direct mental communication and he was I say 'he' it was trying to quietme down and told me not to be afraid. They weren't going to harm me andthings of that nature. He asked me if I would go with them. I told him I didn'twant to go with them. He finally convinced me to go and said that everythingwas going to be all right.He lifted the covers off of me and I sat up in bed and walked over towards thedoor and one was in front of me and one was behind me. And I started to try towalk and they were amused by this because my feet weren't on the floor. It waslike my feet were 6 inches or a foot off of the floor. We floated out towards thestairway and out through the wall and I looked up and there was a disk up overthe back yard of the house. I remember looking down at an apple tree that isright next to the house. We went up into the craft from a beam of light andunderneath the craft, I think there were three or four panels that looked like theywere almost fluorescent lighting, fluorescent overhead lighting panels. But theywere tapered.When we went into the craft, I don't understand how we got in there, other thanwe went through it somehow.\" Michael McNeil told me the small beings who took him from his bedroom hadlarge, black eyes and grey-colored, rough-looking skin. Michael does notremember how he and the beings traveled into the disk-shaped craft through the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"large, angled panels of bright, white light, but he does remember what happenednext.Michael McNeil: \"I was laying on a table and they flashed a bunch of images inmy head in rapid succession. It was like something you would see on TV wherethey flash all these different images of war and Hitler and just all sorts ofdifferent things and atomic explosions. I didn't understand it other than it wassupposed to be things that would happen in the future of this planet.WHAT YEAR DO YOU THINK THIS INCIDENT WAS?It was probably 1962 and the interesting part of this story is that the nextmorning, I woke up in bed and sat straight up in bed. I was trying to figure outwhat had happened. I knew I hadn't been dreaming and I was trying to sort it allout in my head and I swung my legs off the bed and was sitting on the edge ofthe bed and I looked down at my right foot, kind of in the ankle area. There was blood running down from it and it hurt. I couldn't figure out what waswrong with it. I could feel something sort of in the top of my foot where theankle joint is. There was a small cut probably about 1/4 inch or 3/16th of aninch long.So, I got dressed and went to school. My ankle hurt all day. When I came homethat afternoon, I sterilized my pocketknife with a match or candle and wiped thecarbon off the blade and dug around with it in my foot and dug it out. It lookedlike a thin piece of glass that was an elongated triangle shape and it wasprobably maybe oh, half an inch long or maybe a little less and it was perfectlyclear and flat on each side. I believe it might have been some kind of a crystal.It took me a long time to figure out what it was, but I think it was some sort oftracking device, some way of locating human beings.WHERE IS THAT?Where is it? It's gone. I put the object in a drawer in a table next to my bed andabout a week and a half later, I looked for it because I just dropped it along theedge of the drawer. And it was gone. It was like it had disappeared. I don't knowif they came and retrieved it while I was asleep or what happened. It wasn'tthere.WHY DO YOU THINK THEY SHOWED YOU ATOMIC EXPLOSIONS ANDSCENES THAT SEEMED TO INVOLVE CATASTROPHE?I think that probably, I know there have been thousands of people who wereabducted. I know some of them, they tried to show them what was happening inthe future. They tried to show humans that. I think they want us to avoid somethings in the future.AND RIGHT NOW, DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF ANYTHINGIMPENDING? ARE YOU NERVOUS ABOUT ANYTHING UPCOMING?No, not more than anyone else, just terrorist attacks, I suppose."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"SO YOU HAVEN'T HAD ANY RECENT DREAMS IN THE PAST FEWMONTHS ABOUT ANYTHING IMPENDING?No, I haven't. I don't know. The whole thing is odd to me. I can't figure it out. It'slike they are doing a survey of the planet, just the way scientists study the forestsin Africa or the forests in the U. S. and the animals that live in them.SO, FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH THOSE CREATURES IN YOURROOM THAT SCARED YOU, YOU STILL DON'T FEEL THEY MEANT YOUANY HARM OR THAT THEY DON'T MEAN ANYBODY ANY HARM?No. I don't think they want to hurt anyone, or at least I mean, that implant theyput in my foot - it hurt, but it didn't kill me.AND YOU WERE ABLE TO GET IT OUT SUCCESSFULLY WITHOUT ANYPROBLEM?Right. I think they expected it to stay there and heal over the top of it andprobably would have tracked me as long as it was in there.\"Copyright 1992 by Bigelow Holding Corporation, Las Vegas, Nevada.Hearing these unexpected revelations from an Oregon businessman reminded meof the national survey done by the Roper Organization in 1992 about \"UnusualPersonal Experiences\" and jointly financed by real estate tycoon RobertBigelow's The Bigelow Holding Corporation of Las Vegas, Nevada, and one ofhis colleagues in Europe. Robert Bigelow is also the founder of the NationalInstitute for Discovery Science (NIDS) in Las Vegas which investigates animalmutilations, human abductions and other physical evidence potentially relatedto the presence of non-human intelligences on this planet.The report for mental health professionals represented three national surveys ofnearly 6,000 adult Americans about the relationship between unusualexperiences and what was labeled the \"UFO Abduction Syndrome.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The Roper report's astonishing conclusion was that, \"The incidence of abductionexperiences appears to be on the order of at least 2% of the population.\" In2004, the American population is 292 million.
