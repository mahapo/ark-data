Image credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell.The answer is dark volcanic basalt beneath a dusty coating of red iron dust. Infact, many rocks in the Gusev crater seem to be basalt and scientists are trying tofigure out if they came from a volcanic eruption IN the crater? Or were carriedby a river of water into the crater long ago? Or maybe were even blown into thecrater by strong Martian winds?Section of first color 360-degree panoramic view of the Gusev crater environmentaround the Spirit lander on January 12, 2004.

Image credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell/USGS.By January 24, the second rover, Opportunity, landed in a truly alien-lookinglandscape. The region is called Meridiani Planum near the equator. Here isastronomer Steve Squyres from Cornell University who is principal investigatorfor both rover missions about his reaction to the first Opportunity images.Interviews:Steve Squyres, Ph.D., Professor of Astronomy, Cornell University, Ithaca,New York, and Principal Investigator, Mars Rover Mission, NASA/JPL,Pasadena, California: \"The very first picture! The very first picture that camedown before we had even deployed the mast showed the outcrop. I was justblown away by that! It was fortunate, there's no question about that. We gotlucky.AND FOR ME TO REALIZE, IT WAS A REVELATION THAT IT WAS ONLYABOUT 28 FEET FROM THE LANDER TO THE BEDROCK.Yeah, when you first look at that outcrop, it looks pretty humongous. Thenwhen you sit down and do the numbers, you realize you can step on this withyour boot it's not that impressive.SO WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT THESE IMAGES, WE HAVE TO KEEPIN MIND THAT THESE ARE ALMOST LIKE FISHEYES?Actually the HazCam images are like fisheyes. The PanCam images look verymuch like your own eyes. They are just very high resolution. The thing is, you'renot used to seeing pictures of Mars that are that high resolution, so when yousee something, you think that it's big. But given how crisp these images are, howgood the resolution is, they are very small.\"Actual length of the entire bedrock outcrop is only 50 feet longand the distance from the outcrop to the small, white, unidentified object at the bottomof the frame is no more than about 14 feet. The small 2-pronged object, according to Prof.James Rice,is about \"the size of a man's fist\" and was probably a piece of an airbag. It has disappeared,maybe blown away? Or crushed by the Opportunity rover driving over it?Original Opportunity panoramic image credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"In fact, the bedrock that looks so far away and high in the first panorama imageswas only 28 feet from the lander's lens. The rocks are only an outcrop abouteight to ten inches high. And the entire length of the outcrop is only fifty feet.So far, Opportunity has discovered a lot of sulfur in at least one rock - whichcould mean a volcanic source, or possibly a water source.Opportunity has also photographed thousands of tiny, round stones thatscientists are calling \"spherules.\" They are about the size of a gun \"BB\" and noone yet know what they are made of or exactly where they came from.Above: thousands of small spherules ranging from 1 to 5 millimeters in diametercover the soil and some of the bedrock at the Meridiani Planum site. Below: Opportunity'smicroscopic imager close-up of the unidentified spherules. Image credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell. The spherules at the bedrock are very round and their colors range from darkgrey to light greyish tan which suggests the spherules are a different compositionthan the soil and bedrock.Over at the Spirit site in the Gusev crater 6,600 miles away, there are alsospherules that are not so round and might have been ground down by the windrolling small stones. But that's only a current guess, pending more data.Spirit made a trench today about three inches deep, just like the Opportunityrover made a trench a couple of days ago. Scientists are looking for hardevidence that liquid water has been on Mars. Researchers are also trying to findout if the very small spherical stones all over the Opportunity site and similarspherules at the Spirit site go down into the soil."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Spirit dug a trench with its wheels about 3 inches deep on February 20, 2004.The soil was apparently harder than the Opportunity trench site because Spirit had towork twice as long. Some scientists think there might be evidence of salty water, but moredata needs to be analyzed. Image credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell.Opportunity's Trench Reveals Shiny Spherules Below theSurfaceA few inches below the surface at the Opportunity recent trench,round spherules glisten. Experts say there is a coating on these that are not seenon the surface spherules. Image credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell.So far, the opportunity trench revealed a few shiny sphericals, but no one knowswhat makes them glossy. Over at the so-called \"laguna hollow\" where spirit dugits trench, some scientists thought there might be indications of salty water, abrine that can exist in liquid form at very low temperatures. If so, that mightexplain why some of the soil sticks to spirit's wheels, almost like moist dirt, andwhy the spirit lander's airbags left tracks that looked like mud. But so far thesalty water idea is only a hypothesis.Other scientists argue mars is too cold and dry at the equatorial sites to havesurface moisture, even brine.The Mysterious Filaments At The Opportunity Bedrock"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The upper arrow points at the end of a filament that starts at the spherule, appears to gounderthe soil grains and reappears near the upper arrow. The lower arrow points at a filamentthat bends.For size context, each of the pebbly grains below the larger round spherule and other rocksis about100 to 200 microns in diameter, about the size of a sugar grain. So the two long,unidentifiedfilaments laying on the little soil grains are about 1 to 2 microns in diameter.Source of image: Opportunity Microscopic Imager Non-linearized Full frame EDRacquired on Sol 19 (February 12, 2004) of Opportunity's mission to Meridiani Planum atapproximately at approximately 11:25:52 Mars local solar time, Microscopic Imagerdust cover commanded to be OPEN. Image credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell/USGS. Back before Valentine's Day, I received an e-mail from my friend PaulAnderson, Director of the Canadian Crop Circle Research Network inVancouver, British Columbia, Canada. He attached one of the microscopicimages (mi) from the opportunity rover of some of the spherules laying on thesoil near the bedrock. He pointed out two very thin filaments on the soil andasked what they might be.So I started sending the filament image around to several mars rover missionscientists for their comment. The first thing I learned is that none of the scientistshad seen the spherule and filaments image before my sending it to them. Herenow, is a brief summary of what some had to say, beginning with Dr. RonaldGreeley, Regents Professor of Geology at Arizona State University's Departmentof Geological Sciences in Tempe, Arizona, and one of the 7 Chairs of theScience Operations Working Group (SOWG) for Spirit and Opportunity nowworking at NASA/JPL headquarters in Pasadena, California.Ronald Greeley, Ph.D., Regents Professor of Geology at Arizona StateUniversity's Dept. of Geological Sciences in Tempe, Arizona, and one of the7 Chairs of the Science Operations Working Group (SOWG) for Spirit andOpportunity now working at NASA/JPL headquarters in Pasadena,California: \"Yep, it's a hair-like thing, all right! It's a puzzle.\"Jim Rice, Ph.D., Astrogeologist, Research Scientist, Arizona StateUniversity, Tempe, Arizona, and Mars Rover Science Team Member,Pasadena, California: \"And this is the first time I've seen this filament that yousent me.COULD THESE FILAMENTS BE ORGANIC LIFE?Nothing is ever completely impossible, but I think based on our understandingof Mars it's a pretty harsh place. If these are seen in other images, then I thinkthat would be very interesting because they look a lot like the filamentstructures we find in volcanic eruptions. Volcanic origin we are trying to narrowit down and if we see a lot of filaments out there, it could possibly indicate it's avolcanic type glass material from (lava) fountains.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Susanne Neuer, Ph.D., Asst. Research Professor, School of Life Sciencesand Dept. of Geological Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe,Arizona: \"The filaments it's very exciting to be able to recognize structures assmall as these little filaments. There are many possibilities what these filamentscould be.It s very tempting to try to deduce that they might actually be related to any lifeforms in the soil. But in fact, we don't have sufficient data and just a microscopicimage is not conclusive to say anything about the origin of these filaments. Itcould be either inorganic, meaning a mineral that is filamentous, or dust grainsthat are strung together as Dr. Greeley pointed out. Or it could be an artifactsimply because the resolution of the image is not fine enough to resolvesomething that has a diameter of maybe a micron or so. I think that is what thatfilament is in diameter.\"Steve Squyres, Ph.D., Professor of Astronomy, Cornell University, Ithaca,New York, and Principal Investigator, Mars Exploration Rover Mission,Pasadena, California:\"STARTING WITH THE IMAGE OF THE SMALL FILAMENTS THAT AREON THE GRANULES...Oh, yeah! I don't know what to make of those. We did see that. It caughtpeoples' attention when we saw it.You got to be careful when you see something like that in a place like where weare right now because remember this vehicle landed using airbags whichinvolved lots and lots of fabric that got thoroughly tattered and torn in thelanding process. And so if you are seeing what looked like little fibers around,there is a non-trivial probability that we brought them with us.So, I don't know what to make of that. I cannot tell you whether it's Martian.Now, if we drive 500 meters away from this crater and we are still seeing them,then let's talk. At this point, I don't know what to think of it.\"Mars Rovers Have No Organic DetectorsI talked with professor Steve Squyres last night at the Jet Propulsion Laboratoryin Pasadena about the unidentified filaments in the Opportunity microscopicimage. I was surprised to learn that the rovers do not have any instruments totest for organic substances - and that my questions about possible organic life -even about algae or fungus on Mars - are not welcome in the strict geologyresearch.Prof. Steve Squyres: \"There is some little filament in this image and we don'tknow what it is. That's about as far as I'll go.ARE THERE SPECTROMETERS ON THE ARM OF THE OPPORTUNITYROVER THAT COULD GO DOWN AND TOUCH THIS AREA IF YOUWERE ABLE TO CONTROL IT AND BE ABLE TO TELL IF THERE WEREORGANIC SIGNALS? SOMETHING WAS ORGANIC LIKE A LIPID OR?No. No. Searching for organics is not part of what we are trying to do in ourpayload.SO IF IT WERE ORGANIC, THE INSTRUMENTS CURRENTLY COULDNOT...If what were organic?LET'S SAY THESE FILAMENTS WERE SOMETHING ORGANIC.You mean some kind of fabric that we brought with us that was organic in naturelike a polymer of some sort?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"NO, WHAT IF THEY WERE INDIGENOUS TO MARS AND WEREORGANIC? I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF WE ARE ABLE TODISTINGUISH?I don't even want to go there.WELL, THE BIGGER QUESTION IS: ARE WE ABLE TO TELL ORGANICVERSUS INORGANIC WITH THE CURRENT ROVERS?As I said, we do not have an instrument on the payload that is tasked for lookingfor organic molecules.SO IF IT WERE JUST HYPOTHETICALLY IF THE FILAMENTS WERE...Sorry, we're not going there. The problem is if you say, \"If it were\" then you canimmediately take it and run with it in ways I don't intend. So, let's be carefulhere.OK, AS A SCIENCE REPORTER I'M JUST TRYING TO LOOK AT THESEIMAGES AND JUST FIND OUT IF...I think we are probably looking at stuff that came off or our airbags.IF IT WERE NOT, THOUGH, I WAS JUST TRYING TO FIND OUT HOWYOU COULD DIFFERENTIATE?If it were, given the size scale of these things all we can do is take pictures ofthem. We cannot measure their composition in any way shape or form.SO DO YOU FIND ANYMORE SOMEPLACE ELSE LIKE OVER AT THEBONNEVILLE CRATER OR SOMETHING, YOU STILL WOULDN'T BEABLE TO TELL EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE?There is no way to tell what they are made of. We would be able to image themand to study their shape and morphology. The only ones we have seen so far arevery close to where we (Opportunity) landed.LET ME ASK YOU ONE OTHER THING. I WAS TALKING WITHPROFESSOR RICE AND HE SAID THAT HE IS INTERESTED IN THEPOSSIBILITY THAT THEY COULD BE SOMETHING LIKE THE VOLCANICHAIRS OF PELE IN HAWAII.That's certainly a possibility.Thin glassy \"hairs\" produced in volcanic eruptions. Image from Pele Volcano in Hawaii. WOULD THERE BE ANY WAY OF CONFIRMING THAT WITH ANYINSTRUMENTATION?Again, all we can do is take pictures.SO, AT THAT 1 TO 2 MICRON SCALE THAT THEY MAY BE, IT'S NOTREALLY POSSIBLE ON THIS MISSION TO TELL EXACTLY WHAT IFTHERE WERE FILAMENTS SOME PLACE ELSE WHAT EXACTLY THEY"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"ARE MADE OF?Again, we do not have spectrometers that can measure the composition ofsomething that small.What we're trying to do with this mission is go to places where we think watermight have been present, either as standing water bodies or hydrothermalsystems, water percolating around and what have you water percolating throughthe ground, and see if we can find compelling evidence for that and makeinferences about whether that would have been an inhabitable environment.AND IF IT HAD BEEN, IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WOULD STILL BE ARESIDUE IN AN ORGANIC CATEGORY?Again, we do not have on this payload, nor did we intend to, a capability tolook for organic molecules. That's not what we're trying to do this mission.IT WOULD BE EXCLUDED IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ANCIENTWATER BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE IS WATER ICE AT THE POLES ISTHERE A POSSIBILITY THAT THERE COULD BE SOME WEIRD LICHENOR FUNGI OR ALGAE? SOMEWHERE?I don't even know how to begin to answer a question like that. I'm sorry.BECAUSE?You are talking completely hypothetically.YES, BUT THERE IS WATER ICE AT THE POLES.There is ice. There is solid ice. Life all forms of life that we know on Earthrequire water in the liquid phase. And that has not been found on Mars yet.I THOUGHT WE HAD ALGAE AT ANTARCTICA IN SOME OF THESTRANGE ICE THERE.In order to um, in order to multiply and to propagate itself, in order tometabolize, life requires liquid water. Now, there are forms of life that can gointo dormant phases if they are totally frozen. But in order to have these sort ofactive biological processes, liquid water is, as far as we know, a requirement.SO IN THESE PARTICULAR MISSIONS, IF THERE WAS SOMEHYPOTHETICAL ALGAE OR LICHEN OR SOMETHING I'm sorry, these missions tells us absolutely nothing about hypothetical algae,lichen or anything else. That's not what this is about.I JUST DIDN'T KNOW. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I DIDN'T KNOW YOUCOULDN'T LOOK FOR SOMETHING OF AN ORGANIC MOLECULE LIKEA LIPID. I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT.No, that's not part of what we're trying to do on this mission.WILL YOU BE ABLE TO LOOK TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY MORE OFTHESE FILAMENTS ANYWHERE AROUND THERE?We are taking microscopic images everywhere as we go along and if something isthere, we'll see it. Again, in this point and time, it's impossible to say these thingsare even Martian, so I can't say much about them.WHAT ABOUT THAT STRANGE 2-PRONG THING THAT PEOPLE ON THEINTERNET WERE PASSING AROUND AND WERE REFERRING TO ASTHE 'PLANT' OR THE 'BUNNY?'"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Small, white object in bottom of Opportunity panorama image,estimated to be about size of a man's fist and has now disappeared from the landing site.See panorama shot at top of this report.Oh, the bunny. The bunny is another one of these things that probably was apiece of airbag or something from material we brought with us.IT'S DISAPPEARED FROM THE PANORAMAS?Yeah, either we ran over it or it blew away one of the two. I'm honestly notsure.\"We b s it e s :http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.htmlhttp://www.esa.int/export/esaCP/index.htmlhttp://athena.cornell.eduCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
