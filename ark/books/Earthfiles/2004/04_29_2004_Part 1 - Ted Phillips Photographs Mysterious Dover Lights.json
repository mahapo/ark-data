Local residents call them the \"Dover lights.\"April 29, 2004 Branson, Missouri - At the 2004 Eureka Springs, Arkansas UFOConference three weeks ago, we heard new reports about mysterious glowing objects downin the Piney River valley that local residents since at least the 1800s have called \"Doverlights.\" This year at the conference, Ted Phillips, Director of the Center for Physical TraceResearch in Branson, Missouri, talked about his own recent encounter with the Doverlights on March 26, 2004, at \"twenty minutes past sunset,\" or about 6 p.m. Central time. InEureka Springs, Ted showed a series of color photographs as the lights appeared andchanged patterns for a half hour, starting with one moving.Interview:Ted Phillips, Director, Center for Physical Trace Research, Branson, Missouri:\"When the sun set behind the mountain, the valley became pretty dusky in a hurry. But youcould still see the water surface of the river and suddenly, this very odd colored light justwinked on. It moved rapidly to the right and covered a distance. I was later able todetermine from the maps and photos that these things were about 4,700 feet from me nearthe bank of the river which was 25 to 30 degrees below the horizon.WHAT DO YOU MEAN 'ODD COLORED'?The shade of red or violet. It is very difficult to describe. I've had a lot of UFO witnessessay this to me, too. I have never seen a color like this and it is extremely odd in that it is amixture of deep red and deep violet. The light source is very intense, but yet it is not hurtfulto the eyes. It's almost a 'soft intense,' if that is possible.In a standard color wheel, red and violetare next to each other on the left.It does not illuminate the area around it (does not cast shadows). This thing was passingthrough trees, very low to the ground, at a really good clip. I have talked to anotherresearcher who has been down there on foot and he tells me that it is almost vertical bluffs,very dense trees, so you wouldn't just go running across there with a light of some kind, ordriving something. There are no roads or trails down there along the Piney River.The first light winked on and moved rapidly across to the right about 100 feet. Suddenly, itstops and maintains position there and about 20 to 30 feet to its right, another light winks"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"on. They are displaying two horizontally level lights parallel to each other. Then belowthem, near the ground, a third light comes on which creates a sort of triangle (pattern withthe other two lights).I was shooting with a 35mm single reflex camera and 260 millimeter telephoto on a tripod,using Fuji 800 ASA film. I started out running a 2 second exposure per frame. Then I wasn'ttoo sure of the lighting down there (since it was so dark) and I wanted to bring up some ofthe ground details so I could then later determine the exact position of the lights. So, Iexposed some frames 4 seconds, then some 6 seconds, and then some 8 seconds.THE COLOR OF THE LIGHTS IN THE PHOTOGRAPHS, IS IT CLOSE TO WHAT YOUSAW WITH YOUR EYE?No. No. And I've been a professional photographer for a good part of my life, most of it.I'm not sure how you would duplicate that color, but I tried in printing those and shiftingthe colors on some test images to duplicate it and as of now, I haven't been able to come upwith the precise shade. I don't know. I've just not seen that color before. The violet part iswhat is really outstanding in my mind. It's such an odd variation of red and violet. I don'tknow.Ted Phillip's first photograph of the bright light he saw \"wink on.\" Behind, there seem to betwo other lights coming up from behind.

From this half circle,the edge of the circle, there would be up to 5 or 6 lights the camera was seeing better than Iwas. Several of these lights would come out of the half circle at the edge of it, again to theright maybe 100 to 150 feet, and stop.Several lights to the right of the first half circle appear to be moving upward.In some of the images, you can see some of the objects or lights going, ascending vertically.I'm not sure how far they went because the shutter shut down before they had stopped. Butthey were leaving a luminous trail behind them in the vertical ascent. So, there was verticaland horizontal action on the part of these things. Gosh, the whole display went on foralmost 30 minutes and there was a rather brutal thunderstorm coming in over the mountain.I packed up my tent and fled.Blow-up of the ascending lights leaving vertical trails. Future ResearchA small team of us are going back with better imaging equipment and radios so half theteam can be down in the lower valley and half at the over-look.LOOKING AT THE PHOTOS, I KEPT HAVING THE IMPRESSION THAT MAYBETHERE WAS SOMETHING THERE INVISIBLE AND THAT THESE LIGHTS WEREAPPEARING AROUND IT?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Well, that's an interesting point because I do know that the first one moved in from the leftto the right and when it stopped, Light 2 and Light 3 came on, followed by the other seriesof lights. So, if that were the case, then the first light came in independently to join with thiscircle of lights which was initiated and displayed itself. Then the other lights that werecoming out and moving 100 to 150 feet away from the circle were independent once theyleft the circle, independent light sources. They were all the same color, the same intensity.They didn't blink, they didn't dim, they didn't brighten. But the color in the display of thelight was very unusual and nothing at all for example, the Joplin spook light which I havephotographed many times and a couple of the other spook lights that I have seen. They areof a much softer lighting, illumination, then these things (at Dover). These were so intense almost with the intensity of looking into a laser point, really. If someone was standing a fewfeet away and turned a laser point at you, it would be almost that intense.What I will be using when I go back will be a 4000 millimeter with an astronomical CCDimaging device which is capable of rapid multiple exposures that show more detail.\"At the Eureka Springs, Arkansas conference, Ted Phillips also reported about his search fora large, black, glassy object embedded deep inside a cave in Slovakia - a mystery thatbegan in 1970 when he worked with astronomer J. Allen Hynek, who founded the Centerfor UFO Studies and consulted with the U. S. Air Force on Project Blue Book.Continued in Part 2 - Ted Phillips Investigates Slovakia Cave MysteryWebsites:http://www.cptr.usCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
