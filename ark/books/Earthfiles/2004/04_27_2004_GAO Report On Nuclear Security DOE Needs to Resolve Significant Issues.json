S. General Accounting Office (GAO) report for Cong. Christopher Shays,Chairman, Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging Threats and International Relations in the Committeeon Government Reform in the U. S. House of Representatives, Washington, D. C. April 27, 2004 Washington, D. C. - A General Accounting Office (GAO) report wasreleased today about the Department of Energy (DOE)'s slow response since 9/11 tochange its plans for dealing with terrorist threats at American sites containing nuclearweapons and/or nuclear materials such as plutonium. In fact, it's now estimated that it willtake until 2008 for DOE to implement its updated plan to deal with terrorist threats.After 9/11, DOE needed a new \"Design Basis Threat (DBT)\" - a classified document thatidentifies the potential size and capabilities of terrorist forces. The GOA report releasedtoday states, \"...during the DBT development process, there were sharp debates withinDOE and other government organizations over the size and capabilities of future terroristthreats and the availability of resources to meet these threats... The new DBT identifiesnew possible terrorist acts such as radiological, chemical, or biological sabotage. However,the criteria that DOE has selected for determining when facilities may need to be protectedagainst these forms of sabotage may not be sufficient.\"Today I talked with Robin Nazzaro, Director, Natural Resources and Environment Team,U. S. General Accounting Office (GAO), Washington, D. C., about the discrepancy interrorist size estimates given by intelligence agencies versus what the Department ofEnergy is prepared for, including aerial attacks.Interview:Robin Nazzaro, Director, Natural Resources and Environment Team, U. S. GeneralAccounting Office (GAO), Washington, D. C.: \"The DOE acknowledged that the risk foran unspecified air attack, but it did not lay out any protective measures to mitigate the risk.Rather, they are relying on other federal government agencies such as the Dept. ofHomeland Security and Dept. of Defense to defeat such a threat.HOW WOULD DOE GUARANTEE THAT THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS ORNUCLEAR STORAGE AREAS WOULD BE DEFENDED BY HOMELAND SECURITYOR THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT?Well, the DOE sites are expected to consider measures about how they handle and storethe nuclear materials and to mitigate the consequences of air attack on the existing"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"facilities. In fact, the new DOE facilities designs now are expected to include features thatwould mitigate any consequences of such an attack.CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT THOSE MEASURES WOULD BE?(long pause) Yes, I have a technical expert here who is also questioning me on any securityissues. He said that the types of things that DOE would include as mitigating factors wouldbe blast proof safes, reinforced roofing that would also be able to withstand an aircraftattack.BUT DOE WOULD BE DEPENDING UPON HOMELAND SECURITY AND THEDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FOR ACTUAL INTERFERENCE?Yes, as they protect the rest of the country against those kind of attacks. Sub-Committee Hearing April 27, 2004WHICH IS WHY WE ARE TALKING EVERYBODY, INCLUDING CONG. SHAY,WONDERS IF WE ARE ADEQUATELY PREPARED?That was certainly the line of questioning today that Chairman Shay held and was the basisof the report to review these materials and to assess whether DOE is adequately protectingthe materials they have in their possession. I would say, bottom line, that DOE has put thisnew Design Basis Threat in place. They now have to implement it. They have set adeadline at the end of fiscal year 2006 for full implementation. We feel DOE is unlikely tomeet its own deadline. Some estimated that it could take as long as five years, givenadequate funding. The five years would be from the DBT was issued in May 2003.TO 2008 THEN?2008, yes. Potential Size of Terrorists Threats Against DOE Facilities?ON PAGE 20 OF YOUR REPORT, IT SAYS, 'IN CONTRAST TO THE POSTULATEDTHREAT, DOE IS PREPARING TO DEFEND AGAINST A SIGNIFICANTLYSMALLER GROUP OF TERRORISTS ATTACKING MOST OF ITS FACILITIES.' WHY?DOE is taking into consideration what it is that they are trying to secure. So, for sites thathave nuclear weapons, they are defending against a certain threat level. For other sites thatwould have Category 1 special nuclear material (such as plutonium and enriched uranium),they would be prepared to defend against a smaller number of terrorists.So, they are looking at what they are trying to defend against and then using the PostulatedThreat Assessment it is an assessment from the intelligence community they are looking atthis as one piece of input. They are also looking at what their facilities are like and whatDOE thinks would take to defend them.DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO YOU THAT DOE SHOULD INDEPENDENTLY PREPAREFOR A SMALLER THREAT FROM TERRORISTS THAN OUR INTELLIGENCECOMMUNITY THINKS IT SHOULD?The intelligence community was setting threat levels that were worldwide. So, they werebased not only on the kinds of threats that we could experience within the continental U.S., abut also in foreign countries. So they provide a range of what it would take to defendthese sites. So, they said DOE took that into advisement and then made their ownassessment.ON PAGE 22, QUOTING FROM THE GAO REPORT, IT SAYS:\"According to a March 2002 DOE response to a January 23, 2002 letter from Rep.Edward J. Markey, a worst case analysis at one DOE site showed that while aradioactive dispersal would not pose immediate hazard and acute health problemsfor the general public, the public could experience measurable increases in cancermortality over a period of decades after an event. Moreover, releases at the sitecould also have environmental consequences requiring hundreds of millions tobillions of dollars to clean up. contamination could also affect habitability for tensof miles from the site, perhaps affecting tens of thousands of residents for manyyears. Likewise,m the same response showed that a similar event at an NNSA(National Nuclear Security Administration) could result in a dispersal of plutoniumthat could contaminate several hundred square miles and ultimately cause"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"thousands of cancer deaths. The chemical sabotage standards, the 2003 DBTrequires sites to protect to industry standards. However, we reported last year thatsuch standards do not exist. Specifically, we found that no federal laws explicitlyrequire chemical facilities to assess vulnerabilities or take security actions tosafeguard their facilities against terrorist attack. \"Finally, the protection criteria for biological sabotage are based on laboratorysafety standards developed by the United States Centers for Disease control, notphysical security standards.\"SO GAO IS CONCERNED ABOUT POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL, ANDNUCLEAR SABOTAGE IN DOE FACILITIES.Yes. We applaud DOE for adding additional requirements to the DBT such as protectingstrategies to protect against radiological, chemical and biological sabotage. However, webelieve DOE needs to re-evaluate its criteria for terrorist attacks of that type, especially inthe chemical area to make it more defensible from a physical security perspective.WHAT WAS DOE'S ATTITUDE AT CONG. SHAYS' SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING?As of today, DOE does not resist the GAO recommendations. They have concurred without recommendations and our taking immediate actions. Our reports are often done at therequest of someone in Congress, so we make recommendations. There is a requirement thatthe agency discussed follow up and notify the Congress as to their actions as they respondto our recommendations. We also follow them up.WHAT IS DOE GOING TO DO?They are going to be studying the development of the Design Basis Threat so in the futurethey can move more quickly. They are also going to look at the threat assessment where wehave criticized therm for assuming a smaller group of protected force to protect against.AND CONGRESS HAS CONTROL OF THE PURSE STRINGS OVER AGENCIES IFTHEY DON'T COMPLY?That's the most effective control.\"Websites:http://www.gao.gov/http://www.doe.gov/engine/content.do?BT_CODE=NATIONALSECURITYCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
