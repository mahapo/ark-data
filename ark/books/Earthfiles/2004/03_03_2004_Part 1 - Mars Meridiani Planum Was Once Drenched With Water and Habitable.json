Photograph © 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe. March 3, 2004 Washington, D. C. - The large NASA press room had filledwith reporters and half a dozen television crews Tuesday afternoon to hearprincipal scientists and NASA officials confirm that the Opportunity rover hadshown them geological evidence of water in the Martian bedrock. Ed Weiler,Ph.D., Associate Administrator for the Office of Space Science at NASAHeadquarters, opened the press conference by saying, \"Opportunity has landedin an area of Mars where liquid water once drenched the surface. Moreover, thisarea would have been a good habitable environment for some period of time.\"Finding solid geological evidence that liquid water had once flowed or pooled inlakes on Mars has been a major goal of the Opportunity and Spirit rovermissions.

One question is: were theserocks laid down in liquid water? We don't have an answer for that one yet. ...The second question is: were these rocks acted upon, altered, by liquid water?And the answer to that, we believe definitively, is yes. We have four differentpieces of evidence that have lead us to that conclusion.\"El Capitan\" section of the bedrock at the Meridiani Planum landing site which was studiedby Opportunity and provided the evidence that once upon a time the place wasdrenched with water. Image credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell.First Piece of Water EvidenceThe first one has to do with the little spherical objects a few millimeters in size.We've been calling them 'spherules.' Actually, within the team, we've nicknamedthem 'blueberries,' because if you look at them, they - like blueberries in a"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"muffin - are embedded in the bedrock and weathering out of it. They are little,tough, round things inside the rock.Small, round spherules - or \"blueberries\" - ranging from 1 to 5 millimeters diameterspread all over the bedrock outcrop at the Meridiani Planum. What they are made of is stillunknown.We've looked at three different ideas for what they might be. We thought theymight be what geologists call 'lapillae.' (Italian for small stone) Lapillae are littlevolcanic hailstones that form when you have an eruption of volcanic ash andthey coagulate and fall out.Another possibility is that these were droplets of volcanic glass or dropletsformed by an impact. If you have a very energetic event that sprays liquid rockup in the air and it freezes and falls out, you can make little round objects thatway. We have looked at them with our color camera. We have looked at lots ofthem with our microscope. We have sliced through them and looked at them incross section.

And all of this has lead us to the conclusion that these are what geologistscall 'concretions.' Concretions form when there is liquid water in a rock that hasstuff dissolved in it and then it begins to precipitate out. It begins to solidifyfrom solution and as it does so, it grows around a nucleation point and as acementing agent, it starts to fill in the pores in the rock and it grows to make asmall spherical object. We believe that these are what we are seeing here. If so,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"it's pointing toward water. Second Piece of Water EvidenceWhen we looked at this rock close-up, we found in some places it is shotthrough with some very weird looking holes. These holes are not round. Theyare tabular in shape. Where they intersect the surface, they are long and thin.They are typically maybe one centimeter long, maybe 1-2 millimeters wide.They are shot through the rock at all kinds of crazy angles. It's a if a bunch ofobjects the size and shape of pennies were once embedded in the rock and thenwent away.Long, thin holes throughout rock related to once-crystal deposits.Image by Opportunity microscopic imager on Sol 28 at \"El Capitan\" in the bedrock atMeridiani Planum.The best way we have of explaining this is that these are actually a familiar formfrom certain kinds of rocks on Earth. What happens is that crystals grow withinrocks. If you have water in solution and crystals precipitate from that, if thecrystals are tabular - flat in form - as they grow, either by pushing the rock asideor simply by replacing the rock - you can get these little tabular crystals withinthe rock. Then, either the water chemistry changes and they dissolve away. Or,they are eroded away and leave little tabular holes behind. So, these things wethink are probably the molds of crystals that were once there and precipitatedout of water. Third Piece of Water Evidence"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"\"McKittrick\" rock near Opportunity rover site shows high concentrations of sulfur andbrominemeasured by the alpha particle X-ray spectrometer (APXS). A nearby rock named\"Guadalupe\"also has extremely high concentrations of sulfur, but very little bromine. This \"elementfractionation\"typically occurs when a watery brine slowly evaporates and various salt compounds areprecipitatedin sequence. Image credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell/Max Planck Institute.Our next piece of evidence comes from the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer(APXS), the instrument that measures how much of each chemical element isfound in this rock. What we found when we first looked at this rock is that itlooked like it had an awful lot of sulfur in it - way more sulfur than has beenfound in any other Martian rock. Our infrared spectrometer, our miniaturethermal emissions spectrometer (Mini-TES) has looked at this rock and alsofound evidence of sulfate salts. When we first looked at this, we looked at theoutside of the rock. When you look at the outside of a rock with this instrument,you can't be certain what you are seeing. You might be seeing a coating on theoutside because the instrument can't see very deeply into the rock.These spectra show that the rock dubbed \"McKittrick\" in the bedrock has the highestconcentration of sulfur yet observed on Mars. Image credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell/MaxPlanck Institute. But we brought with us a grinding tool called a RAT, rock abrasion tool, and itcan grind away. We used it to grind away 2, 3, 4 millimeters from the outersurface of this rock. Then we put our instrument in there and we found evenmore sulfur. We found an enormous amount of sulfur in this rock, too much toexplain by any other mechanism we believe than this rock being full of sulfatesalts. That's a tell-tale sign, we believe, of liquid water. Fourth Piece of Water Evidence"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Then I think perhaps most compellingly of all, once we put that RAT into thehole in the rock, we looked at it with our Mossbauer spectrometer. That's aninstrument that measures what minerals are present. In those Mossbauer data,we found compelling evidence for a mineral called Jarosite. It's an iron sulfatehydrate. This is a pretty unusual mineral, fairly rare on Earth.Jarosite crystal, an iron sulfate hydrate, which on Earthcan only be created in the presence of liquid water.Mossbauer spectrometer spectrum which shows the presence of an iron sulfate hydratemineralcalled jarosite which contains water in the form of hydroxyl as part of its structure.Image credit: NASA/JPL/University of Mainz.When you look at the ground rock with the Mossbauer spectrometer, there is alot of Jarosite in this rock and because it is a sulfate hydrate, this is a mineralthat you've got to have water around in order to make it.So, the combination of probable concretions, these things that we think arecrystal molds, sulfur, the sulfates and particularly, the Jarosite. You put thatstory together and it's hard to avoid the conclusion that these rocks weredeposited in liquid water.\" Significance of Water EvidenceThe purpose of this mission was to go to Mars and to see whether or not it oncehad habitable environments. We believe at this place on Mars, MeridianiPlanum, for some period in time, it was a habitable environment. This was aground water environment, the kind of place that would have been suitable forlife (as we know it on Earth). That doesn't mean that life was there. We don'tknow that. But this was a habitable place on Mars at one point in time.The other thing that I think is crucial is that this is a place that mineralsprecipitated out from liquid water. If you ask yourself on Earth, what kinds ofrocks really well-preserve evidence for very ancient life and for biochemistry,one of the best kinds of rocks for doing this are rocks that contain mineralsprecipitated from water. What happens is that not only does the water providethe medium in which that biochemistry, the life, takes place. But as mineralsprecipitate, they can trap the evidence of that and preserve it very well for verylong periods of time.\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Opportunity's panoramic camera took close-up of \"El Capitan\" bedrock.

What's Next for Opportunity Rover?Once we are finished working on El Capitan (in the bedrock), we are backingaway and driving to another place called \"Big Bend.\" There we are going to takesome very detailed images with all of our cameras and try to determine whetherthese rocks were laid down in liquid water.\"Continued in Part 2 - Rovers not equipped with organic sensors.We b s it e s :http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.htmlhttp://www.esa.int/export/esaCP/index.htmlhttp://athena.cornell.eduCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
