The small \"horned\" object, according to Prof.James Rice,is about \"the size of a man's fist.\" Original Opportunity panoramic image credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell. February 18, 2004 Pasadena, California - The NASA/JPL Martian rovers,Spirit and Opportunity, each came down near the Martian equator about 6,600miles apart protected inside many inflated airbags. Each airbag was about 13feet (4 meters) in diameter and had a stitched pattern of a ring with linesradiating from it. The idea was that each lander would be dropped from itsorbiting spacecraft and fall to a bouncing landing inside the airbags. Soon afterOpportunity came to rest on January 25, 2004, the rover's panoramic cameratook a 360 degree image of the shallow crater surrounding it on the MeridianiPlanum near the Martian equator.Above is only a portion of the 360-degree color panorama that the Opportunity rover'scameratook which shows a trail of lander bounce marks coming down the inner slope of the smallcrater belowthe white bedrock where the spacecraft came to rest when it landed on Mars onJanuary 25, 2004.

BUT BECAUSE THE DISTANCE BETWEENTHE LANDER AND THE BEDROCK IS ONLY ABOUT 28 FEET?Yeah, about 9 meters (28 feet) between the lander and the bedrock. If you lookat one of the panoramas, especially from the Opportunity site, what we did isbounce across the surface and rolled into the crater, down one rim of it and upthe other and came back and you can see airbag marks in the panorama wherewe were rolling across and down to the crater like that.We were really pretty lucky - it's the first Martian outcrop we've ever seen andhad the ability to go up and examine.SO EACH OF THOSE MARKS THE CIRCLES THAT HAVE THE LINESRADIATING FROM THE CENTERS EACH OF THOSE MARKS WOULD BEWHAT? ONLY ABOUT HOW MANY METERS OR FEET IN DIAMETER?I think the airbags when fully inflated are around maybe 4 meters in diameterroughly.ABOUT 13 FEET. SO THOSE IMPRINTS OUT IN THE SOIL COMINGBETWEEN THE BEDROCK AND THE LANDER WHERE THEY HITMIGHT BE A LITTLE SMALLER THAN 13 FEET?Ye s . The whole outcrop when you look at it in the images, you think it lookslike a big wall of rock. But in reality, that outcrop out there is only about 10 to20 centimeters high. And it's more like a little ledge. If you were there as anastronaut and saw it, you'd probably go up to it and kick it with your boot orbust a chunk off with a rock hammer and look at it and go on your way outsidethe crater to explore the thing.Images above and below: pale-colored bedrock that lays alongthe upper edge of the shallow crater (8 to 10 feet deep) that Opportunity landed in.Rover instruments measured a 20% sulfur content in the bedrock which rises only about 8to 10inches high. The bedrock and surrounding soil are covered with small, unidentifiedspherules about 5 millimeters in diameter. The Opportunity lander is only 28 feetfrom the bedrock.

But it's not a verybig feature it's very small. And you have to remember when you see these imagesfrom the rover especially images from the HAZCAMS there are two hazardaboard cameras two on the front and two in the back. These are mounted downreal low on the rover, almost like you are crawling around on your belly. Thenthere is the PANCAM and the NAVCAM images are about 5 feet 4 inches abovethe ground, more like a human would see it. Biggest Bedrock Pieces Only About 8 Inches High and 24Inches LongBut the perspective you get is that a lot of these things look a lot bigger thanthey really are, so the outcrop even when I look at it today I have to rememberit's a very small feature. Typically the biggest chunks on average of that outcropis only 10 to 20 centimeters high. It's very small. 20 centimeters is roughly about8 inches. It's a very small feature out there and these spherical particles are verysmall also.The biggest one (spherule) that we've measured up to this point has been around5 millimeters. A lot of them are smaller than that, like 1 to 2 millimeters aboutthe size of a bb (gunshot). Length of Bedrock Outcrop Is Only 50 FeetHOW LONG IN FEET IS THE OUTCROP FROM ONE END TO THEOTHER?If you were to drive from one end of the outcrop to the other is about 15 meters about 50 feet. So it's very small. The biggest chunk we've seen in there is about50 to 60 centimeters (about 24 inches) long and 20 centimeters high (8 inches)high. Distance from Lander to 2-Pronged Object Only About 12FeetTHEN, IF YOU GO BACK TO THAT PANORAMIC PICTURE FROM THEOUTCROP DOWN TO THAT 2-PRONGED OBJECT, HOW FAR WOULDYOU ESTIMATE THAT WOULD BE?The 2-pronged object would be pretty close. The distance from the lander wetook the initial panorama from the lander to the outcrop I believe that distancewas about 8 meters."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"24 TO 25 FEET.Yeah, very close.SO THOSE ROCKS ARE ONLY ABOUT 25 FEET FROM THEOPPORTUNITY LANDER?Right, from where the initial landing point, yeah.THAT MEANS THAT WHATEVER THE 2-PRONGED THING WAS, IF THEENTIRE OUTCROP WAS ONLY 28 FEET OR SO FROM THE LANDER ANDROVER, THEN THAT 2-PRONGED THING HAD TO BE NO MORE THAN12 OR 14 FEET AWAY?I don't really know, but it would be a lot closer than the outcrop, yeah. It lookslike it's right down there. It is safe to say it is definitely closer than 24 to 25 feet.You've got to remember when you look at this stuff that a lot of things look likethey are foreshortened. When we take the images of the NAVCAM andPANCAM, we can get ranging data. If we have stereo, we can get distancesbecause the rover needs this to drive. It takes this information and has to havethe ability to make little maps before it drives off to make sure there are nohazards there.High-tech navigation sensors aboard the Martian rovers help the robotsavoid obstacles and project a path of movement. Graphic credit: NASA/JPL.Of course, we are using this information to measure the heights of the rocks andaspect ratios on rocks. We can measure the width and height of the rock, but wecan't measure that 3rd dimension because we can't see behind it right now.To get that third axis, you have to travel around it to see what it looks like. Sowe have capabilities to look at interesting targets when we want to, but we don'twant to go driving around every little rock out there because we're utmost goalof this mission is to identify past environments where there could have beenwater. And if there is water there, it will tell us something about if it waspossibly inhabitable for life forms in early Martian history. So we'll try to goafter the most interesting scientific targets in terms of trying to relate back towater in that region of the planet. 2-Pronged Object in Opportunity Panoramicof Bedrock Only \"Size of A Man's Fist\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Unidentified object down hill from bedrock at Opportunitylanding site on Mars. Image credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell.CAN YOU TELL FROM THE DIMENSIONS YOU HAVE BEEN GIVING MEON THE ROCKS AND THE DISTANCE FROM THE LANDER TO THEOUTCROP, WHAT WOULD BE THE HEIGHT, THE WIDTH, AND DEPTHOF THAT 2-PRONGED OBJECT?It depends on how that is from your camera, how far the target is away. Youcan't just put your finger on an object in the picture and say this is 10 incheshigh and we bring it back to here, so it's only a fraction of that. You can get a lotof erroneous measurements that way. But it's pretty small. (Prof. Ricedetermined later the 2-pronged object is \"the size of a man's fist.\"WHAT DO YOU THINK THE 2-PRONGED OBJECT IS?Think we solved that one. We talked to the engineering team and it looks like it'sprobably a piece of the airbag, more than likely. We've got images now whereyou can see the parachute and the backshell off in the distance roughly about400 meters away from the rover right now. See: 02/13/04EarthfilesBUT THE THING ABOUT THAT 2-PRONG THING, IT LOOKS ORGANIC,CASTING A SHADOW.It is there. It did cast a shadow. But it looks people we've talked to in theengineering team who have come in and looked at it think it's pieces of theairbag material that shredded upon impact. The thing hits the ground and thenrolls around before coming to a stop. So potentially there is a lot of stuff thatcan come off a spacecraft assembly structure.I'M CURIOUS WHY THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AN OBJECT TO SENDOPPORTUNITY OVER TO SEE WHAT IT WAS?We get certain scientific targets as priorities and we are more interested in theoutcrop out there instead of a piece of material that we brought along with us.BUT WHAT IF IT WERE A PLANT?If it's a plant, it will still be there and we can go check it out. The area we're in isa little crater about 20 meters (65 feet) in diameter. It's not going to go anywhereif it's a plant. So after we do our reconnaissance at the outcrop which is get thehighest scientific value we have it (2-pronged object) will still be there for us tocheck it out. But Where Did the 2-Pronged Object Go?Original Opportunity Panoramic Camera Shot with ObjectRecent Tracks of Opportunity to Bedrock - Right Over the 2-Pronged Object?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"As I said, no one was too excited about what that is. It looks like parts ofmaterial that came with us and basically we don't want to spend our timestudying something we already know airbag material versus going to look at thisoutcrop that we don't know what's there or what it's made of right now.Our top priority when we first saw this outcrop the first night we landed, theNAVCAM images and then the PANCAM images is the outcrop of bedrock.Once again, if it (2-pronged object) was a plant, you'd expect to see more thanone in the panoramic 360 degree image. The idea of it being a plant is highlyunlikely.\"America's Opportunity rover is in the hematite-rich Meridiani Planumsoil near the Martian equator; Spirit is 6,600 miles away inside the Gusev crater;and Britain's Beagle 2 is lost somewhere near Isidis.
