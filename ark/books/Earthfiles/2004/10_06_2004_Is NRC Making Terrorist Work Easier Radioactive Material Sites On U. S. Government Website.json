Theterrorist's goal: to cause another \"9/11\" by constructing and blowing up a dirty radioactivebomb in the United States. American authorities also think El Shukrijumah directed AlQaeda surveillance efforts of the financial districts in New York City, Washington, D. C.,and Newark, New Jersey this summer that provoked Homeland Security to increase terroralerts for those cities to Code Orange. On October 4 in London, British police arrested three men under the British Terrorism Act2000 for allegedly trying to obtain radioactive material to make a dirty bomb. According tothe News of the World newspaper, the men were in a gang trying to buy a kilogram of \"redmercury,\" a radioactive substance made in the old Soviet Union to create hand-held dirtybombs. October 2, 2004, the News of the World newspaper in Londonput undercover investigators in gang trying to buy former Soviet radioactivematerial that can be used for hand-held dirty bombs. Time magazine also reports this week that an Islamic terrorist cell tried to build a dirtybomb in England before interruption by intelligence authorities in August 2004. Theradioactive sources for this dirty bomb effort were the americium 241 substances taken outof several dozen household smoke alarms. On Sunday, October 3, 2004, The Patriot-News in Harrisburg headlined, \"Findingdirty-bomb materials is mouse click away\" by Garry Lenton. The story was based on aninterview with Scott Portzline, Security Consultant, Three Mile Island Alert, in Harrisburg,Pennsylvania.Scott Portzline, Security Consultant,Three Mile Island Alert, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

Scott also emphasized missing and stolen radioactivematerials in the United States. In fact, The Washington Post reported on May 4, 2002:\"The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulates the commercial use of radioactivematerial. It acknowledged receiving reports of 1,495 lost or stolen radioactive 'sources'between October 1996 and September 2001; about 660 of the missing items -- 44 percent-- were recovered, but the rest (56 percent) remain missing, the agency said.\" Scott Portzline helped the volunteer civilian Three Mile Island Alert group in Harrisburg,Pennsylvania, monitor radiation and security near that nuclear power plant. He hastestified before the U. S. Senate, the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the AdvisoryCommittee on Reactor Safeguards and other governmental bodies in an effort to closesecurity gaps that he has found. His research has been cited by the U. S. Department ofEnergy and various military branches. Scott worries that dirty bombs and attacks onnuclear power plants are high on the Al Qaeda terrorist To Do list in the United States. Three Mile Island (TMI) nuclear power plant near Pennsylvania's state capitol,Harrisburg, and the Harrisburg International Airport. TMI Unit 2 reactor went into melt down on March 28,1979,releasing 13 to 17 curies of iodine and 2.4 million to 13 million curies of noble gases into the environment. Interview: Scott Portzline, Security Consultant, Three Mile Island Alert, Harrisburg,Pennsylvania: \"The biggest concern right now is how easy it is for anyone to use acomputer to discover the floor plans of where weapons-grade uranium and plutonium arestored and also other materials that could be very harmful in dirty bombs. The informationcan be found using the Nuclear Regulatory Commissions (NRC) data base.CAN YOU GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE SOMETHING HAS BEEN PUT ON THEINTERNET THAT WOULD HAVE MADE US VULNERABLE?The NRC has a document retrieval system from their website. What one can do is use theirprogram that is downloadable for free in less than a minute and actually connect directlyinto their document retrieval computers. From there, one can search the records to finduniversities, hospitals, any licensee, any industry, or entity, that owns radioactivematerials. In many of these reports is given the floor plan down to the address of thebuilding, what floor the material is stored on, what room, what cabinet, what vault, evenwhat drawer in some cases!WHY WOULD THERE BE SUCH DETAIL PUT ON THE NUCLEAR REGULATORYCOMMISSION WEBSITE?It's a mistake. Post 9/11, the NRC does not want this type of material to be made public.There is a 2-fold problem here:1) one is that licensees themselves include in their applications or re-licensing applicationsdrawings that the NRC does not necessarily need.2) The NRC is not analyzing and purging from the licensee files (sensitive material) beforethey attach it to their (NRC) document retrieval system. Now, if the NRC had enoughmoney and resources, they could scour these documents which would literally be tens ofthousands of pages each day to get rid of these drawings. So, part of the problem is thesheer number of pieces of paper showing the floor plans. Another part of the problem is"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"that the licensees are providing too much information in some cases.WE HAVE THE MORE INNOCENT PRE-9/11 UNITED STATES WITH ALL THESERECORDS FROM UNIVERSITIES, HOSPITALS AND OTHER PLACES WHERETHERE MAY BE RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL STILL IN THE NRC SYSTEM WHICHIRONICALLY CAN MAKE US MORE VULNERABLE POST-9/11.That's right. It's a serious problem and the NRC agrees with me that they are slow to actand they don't even have the capability right now to handle the matter properly. It's onlybeen activists who have gone to the NRC and said, 'Hey, this document needs to have thispage or these pages removed because I don't think you want people to know this.'Sometimes the NRC has disagreed!PART OF THE CHALLENGE FOR THE TERRORISTS WOULD BE THAT THEYWOULD HAVE TO GO TO MULTIPLE SITES WITH THEFT TO GET ENOUGH TOMAKE A DIRTY BOMB. BUT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT THE INTERNETITSELF THROUGH THE NRC WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR TERRORISTS.No question about that. There are certain sources of radioactivity in which one single theftof one source could devastate a city. One example would be a document I just saw for thefirst time last week as it was posted where a source of strontium-90 with 125,000 curies ofradiation if that were ground up and dispersed - as a 'radioactive dispersal device' is whatthe government calls it and we know it as a 'dirty bomb' that could devastate a city withcontamination and cause some harm to people, especially if they inhale the material. Theycould end up with cancer.SCOTT, WHAT WAS THE SOURCE?It did not say what the source would be used for and I think it was actually in raw form.It's a company that handles radioactive materials and probably uses them to sell to otherindustries who manufacture gauges or medical devices. But I'll give you an example ofwhat that type of radioactive source could be used for: to power a lighthouse. The SovietUnion has a problem where people are breaking into lighthouses to steal any type of wire,metal or anything they can get for scrap. In some cases, they have killed themselveshandling the Strontium-90. In fact, there was a story in the news a few years ago, wheresome lumberjacks in Soviet, Georgia, were exposed to strontium-90. And I've seen videoof the recovery of strontium-90 where there was a 20-foot-circle around the source ofstrontium-90 where there was no snow because of the heat generated. To recover a smallsource that could fit in a gallon bucket took the effort of about 30 men, each working foronly one minute, to move the source closer to a lead container in the back of a truck. Whatthat would be used for in the United States would be a similar application where it wouldprobably use it as a battery, so to speak. What Can NRC Do?WHAT DO YOU THINK PRACTICALLY CAN BE DONE, GIVEN THE FACT THAT IFTHERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PAGES FROM ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT SITESAND SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO BE ASSIGNED TO GO THROUGH EVERYTHING TOFIND THE SPECIFIC DETAILS, IS THAT ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE?Probably not, at this point. The NRC is already short at many of its staff levels. They'vedecreased their inspections at nuclear power plants. There are literally several millionradioactive sources in the United States. So, just searching through those documents fromthe licensees that own the industrial and medical sources would take years to do.But there is something that could be done temporarily and that is for every document thatcomes in from a licensee who is re-submitting for their application that can be spotchecked by some of the NRC staff to pull the sensitive pages, or pull the whole report sothey have time to purge it and put it back on the internet. Because the public does have aright to know who has these materials and whether it's safe or not. But I don't think thepublic needs to know exactly what cabinet the material is stored in, complete with floorplans and in some cases, security measures that are quite lacking, actually. Is Homeland Security Solving the Radioactive MaterialsProblem?I'm very critical about the education process. If I were Tom Ridge, if I were the HomelandSecurity czar, I would have a program once a month on television lasting an hour coveringall the different topics until all are covered and updating people on the things they can do."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"If you can educate people with the responses and preparations they need to make, thenyou have people who are not totally reliant upon emergency responders. You will havepeople who will not panic as quickly as they would and it would give them more a sense ofcontrol. Therefore, there would not be the need for martial law, possibly, if people aren'tpanicking and making runs on stores for water and things like that.I think that Homeland Security fell far short the day they announced that people should getduct tape and plastic. The reason that tape and plastic is a good shield against radioactivityis that it prevents the particulate matter from entering your home. Many radioactivesources from a dirty bomb won't harm you a great deal unless you inhale them, ingest themor they enter an open wound. So, if you can temporarily shield yourself with the plasticsheeting, you'll be in good shape. But see, Homeland Security failed to give the detailsabout why this works and to do this in only one room in your house and don't enclose yourwhole house like one fellow did which is a hazard.To this day, the American public thinks now that plastic sheeting offers no protectionagainst dirty bombs. It does not offer protection against gamma ray radiation, but thatwould be a special event that is possible. Homeland Security did not educate us there. Infact, I was the first person to get the Ready.Gov website to change their advice to havepeople to cover their mouth and nose with a damp cloth following any explosion orbuilding collapse because you don't want to inhale what might be in the air. Kyrgyzstan Man Tried to Sell Bomb-GradePlutonium on Black Market in September 2004AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER 2004, REUTERS NEWS SERVICE REPORTED THATPOLICE IN THE EX-SOVIET STATE OF KRYGYZSTAN DETAINED A MAN WHOTRIED TO SELL BOMB GRADE PLUTONIUM ON THE BLACK MARKET. IN THEUNITED STATES, HOW VULNERABLE DO YOU THINK WE ARE TO A TERRORISTPLANTING A DIRTY BOMB OR A SUITCASE NUKE IN MANHATTAN OR LOSANGELES OR SOME CITY?We're incredibly vulnerable! I really see no difference between terrorists having an abilityto gather those materials in a Soviet Union or anywhere else in the world and smugglethem into the U. S., as compared to just stealing them in this country because it happenshere every day. In fact today, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission reported the theft oftwo nuclear gauges, each containing small amounts of cesium and americium whichnevertheless, could be harmful. Radioactive Thefts in U. S.About ten days ago, the NRC reported that there were five thefts in California on a singleday of these types of gauges. Four of them were from one single theft. In that case for thefirst time ever, the event text published by the NRC said this material could possibly havebeen stolen for use in a dirty bomb, but they believe not because some of the othermaterials at this engineering site had been stolen. So they thought it was just for themonetary value.But nonetheless, that showed to me in cut and dried NRC Event reports, the NRC isputting some publicity they are putting a little spin in trying to express they are concernedabout dirty bombs and it's a real concern. Terrorists will have an easy time finding nuclearmaterials right here in this country, formulating a plan to collect them in large or smallamounts. Hopefully, if there are multiple thefts, the terrorist plots can be foiled byarresting the terrorist and discovering where they accumulated a cache of materials. But insome instances, a single theft of something like a radiographic camera containingiridium-192 could contain 300 to 600 curies of deadly radiation that if ground up anddispersed in downtown Harrisburg, for example, would cause that area to be uninhabitablefor several weeks. The clean up would be quite expensive. Overwhelming Cost of Cleaning UpAfter Dirty Bomb ExplosionThis brings me to another issue. Last week we saw for the first time that the governmentsaid there are going to be new standards following a dirty bomb. There is a real question:Do you want to close down the port of New York or Philadelphia if a dirty bomb were to"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"explode there and shut down a major part of the economy of the United States if the levelof radiation is only slightly harmful rather than deadly?It's a valid question because if workers are exposed to say 10 rems in a year which isbeyond the limit the government wants you to receive, but has not been proven by allscientists to be harmful then they just might allow these workers to be exposed to it. Now,especially with pregnant women, that's a problem. Even a man's semen can becomedefective. So, our government is not necessarily going to watch out for individuals, butrather the survival economically of the United States.WHAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING IS THAT IF A SUITCASE OR DIRTY BOMB WENTOFF, OUR GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON COSTABOUT HOW MUCH CAN BE CLEANED UP?That's right, because economically if they did a total clean up let's say, nasty dirty bombswent off in three cities and were dispersed by the wind. Economically clean up could beequal to the national debt we now have. So, there will be tremendous pressure andlobbying to allow an acceptable level of contamination that can be agreed upon by somescientists, but not all scientists. There will be an announcement to the public, 'We believethese levels are safe.' But, there is no absolute proof on what levels are harmful.Let's face it, everyone's immune system is not equal. That is a problem. Our immunesystems are pretty good at countering the effects of radiation on our DNA and cellularreplication. Cancer, of course, is the result of damaged replication. Not everyone's immunesystem can counteract the effects of radiation. So, dirty bombs can kill people.I'm hearing a lot of things in the news recently saying there will be a lot more deaths fromthe explosion than from the dirty bomb itself. Well, I have the manuals written by veryintelligent people about how to prepare for dirty bombs and nuclear plant emergencies. Allthis stuff was written years ago. In these manuals, they describe how some of thesematerials will be so radioactive that the victims will need to be laid 30 feet apart from eachother on the ground so they don't irradiate each other.WHAT YOU ARE SAYING, SCOTT, IS IF THE POST-9/11 SUITCASE NUKE ORDIRTY BOMB POLICIES HAVE TO DO WITH HOW MUCH MONEY IT'S GOING TOTAKE TO COPE WITH PEOPLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION, YOUCOULD END UP WITH WHOLE SECTIONS OF CITIES IN WHICH THE SIDEWALKSAND BUILDINGS ARE RADIOACTIVE AND SIMPLY WALLED OFF AS NOTUSABLE AND THE GOVERNMENT SAYS, 'WE'RE SORRY, WE CAN'T HELPEVERYONE.'Yeah, and I'm saying even worse than that. In some instances possibly, the radioactivitywill be beyond what has been deemed acceptable limits and the government will say, 'Wecan't afford to clean this up, so we'll announce to the people that it is now safe, it is nowcleaned up, to the extent that we can assure you of good health.' And that won't be thefact. We have an example of this with the World Trade Center collapse where the BushAdministration seems to have given orders not to announce that the asbestos levels andother chemicals such as chromium were in the air and people have inhaled things that haveruined their health probably for life. This was done to get Wall Street back open as soon aspossible.I KNOW FIRST HAND FROM A MANHATTAN ATTORNEY WHO WOULD NOTWANT TO BE NAMED THAT HE WAS CALLED WITHIN ONE MONTH OF 9/11AND ASKED TO REPRESENT PEOPLE IN THE POLICE AND FIRE FORCESBECAUSE THEY WERE ALL GETTING SO SICK AND HAVING TROUBLEBREATHING. I'M TALKING ABOUT FOUR WEEKS AFTER 9/11. HE WAS TOLD ITWAS TOP SECRET AND CLASSIFIED AND NO ONE WAS TO KNOW TO AVOIDPANIC.That's the problem because the bottom line for the people running the United States is: thecontinued survival and economic gain of the United States, rather than the safety of everyindividual. Why No Bomb Attacks in United States Since 9/11?SCOTT, WHY DO YOU THINK THAT WE HAVE NOT HAD A SUITCASE NUKE ORDIRTY BOMB IN THE UNITED STATES SINCE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001?I don't believe that terrorists have suitcase nukes. I believe that if terrorists had a suitcasenuke, they would detonate it within a week or two of having it. Why would they delay andwait if they had their dream weapon?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"As far as dirty bombs are concerned, there have been plots discovered and foiled, even inthe United States, in the planning stages. I can't really give you a good answer about whyterrorists do things, or why they don't do certain things. But, I know it would be easier forterrorists to steal materials in the United States than try to smuggle them in, which is whatmany experts think is going to happen. If it happens, it's going to be with our own stolenradioactive materials. One Attempt to Steal One Ton of Cobalt-60 and BerylliumThere was an example of this in Texas in 1996 where a truck had a false bottom hauling aton of cobalt-60 and beryllium. It was detected at the border crossing into Mexico andseized. The U. S. Army was called in along with the FBI and other authorities. I spoke withthree of the men who were named in this report from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.I called them within days and all three of them said, 'I don't know what you are talkingabout.' That clearly told me that National Security had just been breached and that in factthis did happen and their names were in that report. Nobody made up that report! Terrorist ExtortionANOTHER IMPORTANT ISSUE YOU BROUGHT UP IN THAT INTERVIEW WITHPATRIOT NEWS WAS THE ISSUE OF EXTORTION WHEN IT COMES TOTERRORISTS. COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT?If terrorists are able to locate the plutonium and uranium that is weapon-grade material onthe internet, even though these are small amounts in terms of 30 grams or 160 grams whichisn't enough to make a nuclear bomb. But they could still send a small sample of thatmaterial to the government and make blackmail demands and the government would notknow how much they actually had. That happened in 1979 with some low enricheduranium from a man working at an enrichment plant in North Carolina. During hisextortion attempt, he was able to circumvent security, moved in with security shift changeand left some doors open for himself and stole several 5-gallon buckets of these materials.The man was able to steal the uranium from the premises without being caught. He wasarrested 6 days later during the extortion attempt.These types of attempts have occurred around the world and will continue to occur. Now,we in the United States might not cave into the extortion attempts. But look what hashappened to other countries with their hostages in Iraq. So it's possible that somebody whosteals weapons-grade uranium right here in the United States can have their political willduring an extortion attempt and we're likely to see that tried in the future. Tests of American Security AroundRadioactive Substances Often FailWe have to secure these materials. At universities, they basically have only a nightwatchman and an alarm on a door. But it's easy to break in a room and exit before one iscaught. In fact, at the Rocky Flats facility in Denver, Colorado, a team testing securitywith plutonium were able to enter in the facility, set off the alarms, guards startedresponding. But in the meantime, using lacrosse sticks, the test team passed the plutoniumout over the fence on the other side who were also part of the test team who caught theplutonium in a lacrosse stick and made off with it. The guards who responded did not seeanybody. After a few minutes, they started high fiving each other like, 'Oh, wow, wedefeated this attack!' The truth was they were so slow showing up that the plutonium hadalready left the facility (in the lacrosse stick exchange).THIS WAS A TEST OF THE SECURITY AND IT FAILED?Right. And this was within the last 5 years. In 1996, the weapons testing that was doneabout the security of the nuclear weapons by a U. S. Army Red Team went to Air Forcebases where nuclear bombs were stored above ground. In 75% of the tests, the teams wereable to get access to the weapons and 33% of the tests, they were actually able to make offwith the nuclear weapons.WHY IS IT THAT WE DON'T HAVE A POLICY IN THE U. S. IN WHICHEVERYTHING RADIOACTIVE WOULD BE TREATED EXACTLY THE SAME ASGOLD. WE HAVE FORT KNOX. WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF VAULTS FOR JEWELRY"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"AND GOLD. WHY CAN'T WE HAVE A 'FORT KNOX FOR RADIOACTIVEMATERIAL?'That is economically impractical. It would hurt the economy. It would hurt industry. Itwould hurt medical treatments. So, there are two types of devices the NRC has in itslicensing program. One is called 'generic.' The other is called 'specific.'The specific licensed materials are the most harmful materials. Even there, there is notgood follow-up or inspection done by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) andmany of these have disappeared or been stolen or disposed of improperly. The cost ofdisposing of them properly is as much as $20,000. In previous years, the fine for illegallydisposing of them was only $1,000. So, people just pitched them wherever they wanted to.To keep an eye and tight lock and key on every single radioactive device in the UnitedStates would bankrupt the country, so it's not possible. Therefore, the emphasis by theNRC is on the specific materials.SUCH AS WEAPONS-GRADE PLUTONIUM AND AMERICIUM AND STRONTIUM THE BIGGER GUNS RADIOACTIVELY.Yes, weapons-grade material is actually a different category altogether called 'specialnuclear materials.' There again, the security is lacking. So, one method the government hasused to subvert any attempts to turn these into nuclear weapons is to place a cap on theamount that any one university or facility can have on hand, unless it's a Dept. of Energyfacility. How Could Security for RadioactiveSites and Substances Be Improved?If I were in charge, I think I would come up with a different commission other than theNuclear Regulatory Commission and I would divide it into three sectors. One would be justfocusing on the nuclear power industry. I think the NRC is broken. It's the second worstregulator, second only to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). I think I would haveanother regulatory commission that focused on industrial nuclear materials and a thirdsection focused on the medical field.All three have special applications and different needs and requirements. To staff thesesectors of such a new commission, I would increase the staffing by two or three times.Then I would certainly get these documents off the internet, the specific pages with thefloor plans.And I would immediately increase the security at nuclear power plants. If we are tobelieve that Al Qaeda is going to do a spectacular attack, the most spectacular that I canthink of is an attack on a nuclear plant. I would have a Phalanx close-in weapons systemlocated at every plant to be able to shoot down aircraft in the final seconds of approach.Computers can determine the flight path and whether that vector is terminating as a crashat the nuclear power plant, or whether the plane is just passing nearby.Phalanx fast-reaction, rapid-fire 20-millimeter gun system.U. S. Navy says Phalanx \"is the only deployed close-in weapon system capableof autonomously performing its own search, detect, evaluation, track, engage and killassessment functions.\" Image courtesy U. S. Navy.WHY DO YOU THINK THAT STEP ALONE HASN'T BEEN INSTIGATED SINCE 9/11?Expense is one. The second concern is fear that such weapons generate, not only to peoplewho live near a nuclear power plant, but to people who fly near nuclear power plants.There have been some friendly fire incidents within the military, so that is a possibility.But once an attack would occur in the United States, I'm very certain that there will be"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"deployment of these type weapons around nuclear power plants.
