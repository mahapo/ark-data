The PFS team observed that the areas ofhi ghestconcentration of methane overlap with the areas where NASA identified water vapor and undergroundwater ice arealso concentrated. This spatial correlation between water vapor and methane seems to point to ac o mmo nunderground source.

September 20, 2004 Ischia Island, Italy - Today at the International Mars Conferenceheld September 19-23, by the Italian Space Agency, physicist Vittorio Formisano, Ph.D.,presented results from his analysis of the Martian atmosphere in a paper entitled,\"Observation of Methane, Formaldehyde and HS (hydrogen sulfide): Extant Life OnMars?\" Dr. Formisano designed the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer (PFS) for placementon the European Space Agency's Mars Express Orbiter. Back on May 6, 2004, when Iinterviewed him for Earthfiles and radio, he said his PFS data indicated molecules offormaldehyde in the Martian atmosphere and told me, \"Formaldehyde is destroyed in theMartian atmosphere within 7.5 hours. There is no way that formaldehyde can exist andremain for a long time in the Martian atmosphere. If (formaldehyde) confirmed, possiblylife on Mars today, yes.\" This was Dr. Formisano's first formal presentation about his Mars Express PFS analysis,after he failed to make an expected presentation at the July 22, 2004, Committee On SpaceResearch (COSPAR) meeting in Paris (See: 07-22-04 Earthfiles). Speculation was in Julythat his formaldehyde data, combined with methane and water vapor together in significantamounts, might suggest some underground process that continues to release formaldehydeand methane on Mars. Now, even his Ischia Island conference paper acknowledges observations of formaldehydein its title. But he is preparing to publish his data in a scientific journal and does not want tojeopardize that publication, so he would only talk generally today about formaldehyde.\"We have identified the correlation between the previous NASA-identified permafrost andthe atmospheric water vapor which indicates presence of a process - mainly sublimation ofice into water vapor - which also brings methane with it. This is the main message oftoday.\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Abstracts text of \"PFS Observation of Methane Formaldehyde and HS: Extant Life On Mars?\"by V. Formisano and V. Cottini, Instituto di Pisics delio Spazio Interplanetario, Rome, Italy,presented on September 20, 2004, at the International Mars Conference, Ischia Island, Italy.Interview: Vittorio Formisano, Ph.D., Principal Investigator of Planetary Fourier Spectrometer(PFS), Institute of Physics and Interplanetary Science, Rome, Italy: \"We produced amap of the water vapor. This map of the water vapor shows a very good correlation withthe results of NASA Odyssey's experiments which identified three broad regions in theunderground on Mars. These broad underground regions were rich with water ice: ArabiaTerra; Ilysium Planum and Arcadia-Memnonia. Arabia Terra in lower left is near the Martian equator southwest of the 1976 Viking 2Lander site in upper right. Map © 1998 Mars by National Geographic Society.Sure enough, we see an enrichment of water vapor in the atmosphere over these samethree regions. Therefore, this indicates a process of sublimation from underground to theatmosphere. We also have produced a rough map of methane in the Martian atmosphereand sure enough, the methane map corresponds rather well to the map of water vapor. Theconclusion is, that methane and water are both coming from underground.There was a model published a decade ago by a NASA scientist concerning a quasi-stableice region in the equatorial region on Mars which now should be only 30 to 40 centimetersunderground. And concentrations of water ice were observed by NASA Odyssey up to16% in mass of water. But to get that, you need a sort of permanent geothermal flow ofvents from the interior of Mars toward the surface. This vented water and other gasesprobably would freeze when reaching close to the surface, producing the ice tables whichare near the Martian surface and would be unstable and sublimate into the atmosphere. So,we have described a picture which goes from the interior of Mars at a few hundred metersup to the atmosphere.When dry ice, frozen CO2, is exposed to the air, it begins to sublimate, or changedirectly to vapor without becoming a liquid first. This is a drawing of what the surface of a cometmight look like as its dry ice sublimates into vapors, provided by NASA."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Methane, Water Vapor and Formaldehyde- Together, Do They Mean Life On Mars?Non-Life Production of GasesAbsolutely without life, saying that geothermal vents produce methane and water and thismight freeze into the ice table which eventually sublimates into the atmosphere andexplains the water vapor enrichment and the methane map I have seen.Life Production of GasesOn the other hand, you might have a completely different scenario. Below the ice table,according to other papers published - there might be an aquifer, some sort of liquid wateressentially where you could have life and bacteria producing methane and other gaseswhich are eventually observed in the atmosphere.So we have two different scenario alternatives and obviously, in the future, we need tomake some measurements to analyze the chemical composition of the ice that is only 30 to40 centimeters underground. This in time, the radar by Italy on the NASA mission for 2005will be able to study the presence of liquid water 200 to 300 meters underground. At thesame time, I hope, with PSF to identify some other molecule which could tell us which ofthe two possible scenarios is more realistic. (Editor's Note: Chiral amino acids would bedefinitive for life. See: Part 2 of this report.) Does Formaldehyde in the Martian AtmosphereStrengthen the Possibility of Organic Life Processes AtWo r k ?WHEN I LAST TALKED TO YOU, YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD DATA INDICATINGTHE PRESENCE OF FORMALDEHYDE AND YOU TALK ABOUT IT IN YOURISCHIA PAPER.Ye s .DOES FORMALDEHYDE IN THE MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE STRENGTHEN THEPOSSIBILITY OF ORGANIC LIFE PROCESSES AT WORK?Not necessarily. The ice table (30-40 centimeters beneath the Martian surface) has beenthere for thousands and thousands of years. Therefore, it is bombarded by cosmic rays andin this case would resemble very much what happens in a comet. Now, in a comet,formaldehyde is observed to be very abundant. The comet is simply a mixture of water ice,CO2 ice, methane ice all mixed together and bombarded by cosmic rays and producesformaldehyde, methanol and many other organic molecules.But on the other hand, it is also well known that comets are a sort of origin of life in a waybecause they bring water and complex organic molecules to planetary surfaces.Certainly the presence of ice only 30 centimeters under the surface that is rich with waterice and methane can certainly be bombarded by cosmic rays because only 30 centimetersof soil will not stop the cosmic rays. Therefore, the similarity with the comet situation ispossible and therefore, a number of consequences are possible. As I said before, withoutspeaking of any molecule in particular: we have two possible scenarios: one with life 300meters under the surface of Mars.Or, a scenario without life.Both, at the moment, are possible. And with a number of measurements and studies thatshould be done which are related to the presence of liquid water in the soil at 400 metersand this can be done with radar data in the future. Others with PSF will study moremolecules and identify if it is possible (to find) molecules that can really distinguishbetween the two scenarios that are mentioned.ALSO, WHEN WE LAST TALKED, IF THE AMOUNT OF FORMALDEHYDE DATAHELD UP, IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT FORMALDEHYDE UNDER THEUV ENERGY FROM THE SUN WOULD DISAPPEAR WITHIN THE MARTIANATMOSPHERE WITHIN 7 HOURS. THEREFORE, IF THERE WAS SOME CONSTANTSUPPLY OF FORMALDEHYDE IN THE ATMOSPHERE, IT WOULD HAVE TO BEGENERATED. IS THAT STILL A POSSIBILITY THAT FORMALDEHYDE IS BEINGCREATED STEADILY ON MARS?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"It is still true. You want me to speak about formaldehyde, but I can't talk in details aboutformaldehyde because of the paper I am waiting to publish in a major scientific journal.But, the two scenarios that I just described to you, both of them can generate all theformaldehyde that is necessary. Mars Express Ground-Penetrating Radar -Will It Find Liquid Water Deep Underground on Mars?WHAT IS THE CURRENT TIME LINE STATUS ON THE EUROPEAN MARSEXPRESS GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR THAT HAS BEEN DELAYED IN ITSDEPLOYMENT SINCE APRIL? WHEN WILL IT START WORKING?I think JPL which has produced the antenna of the radar is currently producing a study onhow dangerous it could be to deploy the antenna. The study should be finished by end ofSeptember and then I think it would be in a month or so, the European Space Agencyshould take a decision if they are convinced that it's safe, the deployment could occur anytime between November and March next year. It so happens that the orbit where the radarcould work from November on is going to be on the day side and the radar prefers to workon the night side. So, that might be the reason to delay the deployment until March nextyear. But I don't know what will happen - sometime between September and November adecision will be made.ONCE IT IS FUNCTIONING, WHAT DO YOU HOPE IT WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDETO YOU TO UNDERSTAND THESE UNDERGROUND ICY AREAS?If the liquid water layer is a few meters say 400 meters underground then the radar shouldbe able to identify that layer and identify liquid water. Obviously, that will help inclarifying the scenario I was describing. Instead of being a hypothesis, we would then workon knowledge of the presence of liquid water underground and that is obviously important.We have identified the correlation between the Martian permafrost and the atmosphericwater vapor which indicates presence of a process mainly, sublimation of ice into watervapor which brings also methane with it. This is the main message of today.DOES IT MEAN THERE COULD BE WATER FROM 30 CENTIMETERS BELOW THESURFACE ALL THE WAY DOWN SEVERAL HUNDRED METERS?Water ice, yes. Liquid water should be 200 to 300 meters underground. But, these 200 to300 meters could become maybe 50 meters in the equatorial region or 500 to 600 meterswhen you go to higher latitudes. This is what the radar should be able to tell us. How Can Earth Scientists Look for LifeUnderground On Mars in Watery Regions?YOU HAVE VERY CLEARLY DESCRIBED TWO POSSIBLE HYPOTHESES THATWOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE METHANE AND GASES THAT YOU HAVEBEEN MEASURING. ONE OF THOSE MIGHT RELATE TO LIFE UNDERGROUNDWHERE THERE MIGHT BE UNDERGROUND WATER ICE OR WATER. HOW WILLYOU FINALLY BE ABLE TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS AN ORGANIC PROCESSON MARS RELATED TO LIFE UNDERGROUND ON MARS?That is a question for which I don't have the answer. There are two possibilities: one isfuture missions landing on Mars, taking samples of the ice and studying the chemicalcomposition, very accurately. There should be some methane in the ice. There could beother gases, minor gases. The analysis of the ice should be done with very big accuracy.This is one direction that could certainly help solve the problem. This could produce thesolution.The most direct solution would obviously be to drill in the Martian surface down 400meters, find samples of liquid water with bacteria inside. This is in the far future.Another possibility for the moment is that I will be able to find some molecule that doesnot have two possible solution, but only one solution (to source) and we would be able todiscriminate between the two scenarios (natural cosmic ray interaction with near-surfacepermafrost or underground organic life). This is a possibility I cannot rule out now, but Idon't have any specific molecule yet.\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Continued in Part 2 - NASA Physicist Talks About Looking for Unique Life Signals onMarsWebsite:European Space AgencyCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
