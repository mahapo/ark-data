Previous Status Report VII begins at Earthfiles 12/15/03.Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. Michael Hesemann: \"He came to Munich, behaved excited and frightened andmade copies of the paper for the Baron and me. This document is said to be amemorandum to South Africa's President, F. W. de Klerk, written by General T. H.Oberholser from the Bureau of State Security, Pretoria (written Beurau) and wasclassified RED - POSSIBLE WAR EMERGENCY. This classification based on the claim that '99% of all information storedelectronically and on silicon slides inside the alien space craft translates to a totalcollapse of all world governments and eventual ellimination (sic!) of the human raceas we know it to exist today.' The 'real' important thing in this document wassomething else - a 'requested' list of all officers involved, including 'J. H. VanGreunen, Captain, Counter Intelligence.' some of the other names sound quitesuspect, like 'Major Fielding' (the late husband of lady-contactee Elisabeth Klarer),'Capt. Spaulding' (head of GSW, AZ), 'd. B. Labuschagne' (a friend of James livingin Sedona, AZ) and 'Capt. Forbes' (Ann Forbes is a UFO book-shopkeeper in S. A.and a good friend of JvG). Furthermore, more than 16 spelling mistakes on twopages made us even more suspicious, as well as the mentioning of Dr. HenryAzahedel as a 'possible security leak in Europe.' In the meantime, I found out that the entire document is a fabrication, that Jamesused a seal from his passport and the head and stamp of his birth certificate to do a'cut and paste' job. Mentioning the many spelling mistakes, James told us that in South Africa nobodycould spell correctly, that even advertisements on TV would have spelling mistakes.COMMENTS ABOUT THE CASE FROM ENGLAND: A) Timothy Good (Above Top Secret) called the entire S. A. case 'bogus.' B) Manchester-based solicitor, Harry Harris, said that he got confirmingdocuments from an independent intelligence source, but did not want to revealit because 'UFOlogists always exploited him.' C) Tony Dodd and Dr. Henry Azahedel still believe in the authenticity of thecase, but named JvG a 'con-man' who got ONE original document from afriend, Capt. Henry Greef, S. A. A. F. Intelligence. They claimed that they gotconfirmation by an independent intelligence source. Before I went to England, James has told me that Tony and Henry still have 4original photographs of the aliens. They denied this. After returning, I wanted to know the truth, taking James at the point of hisweakness. I offered to publish his story and the alleged documents in my magazine,offering him DM 20.000 for everything. We signed a contract, including the two"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"dates February 15, 1990, for delivery of the documents, and March 15, 1990, fordelivery of the manuscript. I offered James an apartment in Gottingen, WestGermany, to stay. He was first accepting and then resisting 'because of fear.' Hetraveled around between Lindau (his 'wife's' place) and Munich where he firststayed in the free apartment of my friend, Robert Yazar, then for short times in myapartment together with his 'wife.' At that time, he admitted that he was not 26 ('that's my cover'), but 24 and thatMarion is not his wife, but his fiance, that he already was married to Mrs. JaniceFugea, now living in Newcastle, GB with two young children who are not his and isgetting divorced. He planned to marry Marion Wiegand from Lindau. Sometimesthey had problems with their relationship. On February 2, we again tried to get the Zurich papers and failed. James claimedthat he got a warning call from a friend from intelligence. On February 11, mypressure on him was so strong that he ordered a friend to bring the papers over toGermany. After resisting again, we finally got everything on February 15. Thedisappointment was unimaginable - such as papers by Bill Cooper, John Lear, PaulBennewitz, which I already had for nearly 4 months. He tried to convince me thatthese were government retypes, that everything was TOP SECRET> But I hadenough. Then he claimed that he sent the 'hot stuff' back to South Africa when thepolice arrived in Marion's house in Lindau. He ordered his people in S. A. to sendeverything to me - but I never received it. He told his former wife, Janice, to sendme 'four photographs of the aliens and an original document,' but they never arrived. When I mentioned that the above-mentioned 'General Oberholser'-paper was a fake,he said he wanted to test the Baron and me and we failed because the Baron gave acopy to Tony Dodd. I ordered him at least to write down his 'experience' fordocumentation. At the end of February 1990 (I do not remember the date), Jamescalled me, claiming that 'everything is over with Marion' and that he wants to goback to South Africa. A few days later, he allegedly called me from South Africa,claiming that he is 'back in his office' at Valhalla, Swaartkoop Air Force Base, gaveme his number 'there.' When I called a little later, the Corporal who answered thephone told me that 'Captain Van Greunen just went home.' Later, Dr. Azahedelfound out that James had PHONED the corporal, told him that every incomingphone call for him should be answered in that way. The Corporal, I think 'Smith' washis name, did not know 'Capt. Van Greunen' personally. On another phone call, James connected me with his 'fellow officers' who 'confirmedhis identity.' Later I got a phone call from 'a friend of his,' informing me that Jameswas court martialled and sentenced to death. Later, the same person informed methat he (JvG) was shot. A little later, James called me and told me that he was back in Germany and that thereason for his 'South African' game was to bring 'death' to the UFO community. At that time, he told me that he sent original photographs from South Africa to BillKnell in New York. We tried to call Knell, asked Christa Tilton and ColmanVonKeviczky to get the pictures. They turned out to be nothing more than hoaxes(Stringfield note: photo shows primitive mummified New Mexican Indian infant). Claiming to be a UFO-contactee since the age of 11, James showed me his book TheAenstrian Revelations, published by a small press in Sedona, Arizona. He told methat his publisher, Gene Falk, produced a documentary movie about him in Sedonaand actually filmed the landing of an alien spacecraft in the desert. Gene Falk deniedthis. Concerning James Van Greunen, four possibilities to consider: 1. James is a con-man, the entire Kalahari affair only happened in his fantasy. he isout for money and nothing else. 2. James is what he claims to be. His personal records were changed by the S. A.government, everything was done to discredit him. He did not send the fakeFax-photos to Bill Knell, but some agent in his name with the above mentionedintention. The only document he faked is the General Oberholser-paper with theintention to test me. 3. James is what he claims to be - BUT, after returning to S. A., he was put underhighest pressure by his government, got the mission to go back to Europe to discrediteverything."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"4. James who obviously was interested in UFOs for along time (according to AnnForbes and Elisabeth Klarer who knew him since he was 13 or 14), had friends, mostpossibly his school friend, Capt. Henry Greef, who worked for Intelligence and gavehim the authentic Kalahari briefing paper. James made his own story out of it andbecause of the lack of real evidence, started to produce fakes. 5) COMMENTARY: CYNTHIA HIND Leonard Stringfield: Cynthia, a long-time respected researcher and a MUFONcontinental Coordinator for Africa, resides in Zimbabwe, a northern neighbor of Botswanaand South Africa. She knows the territory, so to speak: the terrain, the people, theircustoms - and she also is well-informed about UFOs, whether they're witnessed in theKalahari or any other desert. Her report of February 5, 1990, recounting her experiences intrying to get to the bottom of the South African affair follows: Cynthia Hind: 'Two newspaper cuttings about an alleged downing of a UFO by aSouth African jet on May 7, 1989, was sent to me in November of that year. The stories referred to a Dr. Henry Azadehdel, who had the story disclosed to himby a south African Intelligence officer, unnamed, who had stayed with him in hishome in Aspley, England. On the basis of these reports, I decided to write to Len Stringfield of UFO retrievalfame (and a member of MUFON) as I felt if anyone knew of such a report, he surelywould. On November 30, 1989, Walt Andrus (MUFON Director) wrote to me and asked meto cooperate on this matter with Noel Herbiet in Port Elizabeth, who was theMUFON representative for South Africa. At the same time, Walt told me that he hadheard from Azadehdel on the telephone on numerous occasions and that theIntelligence Officer contact in South Africa was James Van Greunen (sic). VanGreunen felt his life was in danger. I was also told that Tony Dodd, a reputable British UFO researcher, had spoken atthe Frankfort UFO conference where he had given a lecture about the alleged SouthAfrican crash and had talked about a 5-page official document about the incident. I must admit that I immediately felt suspicious of the whole matter. If UFOs were sotechnologically superior, how come a South African fighter plane could shoot onedown when far greater nations had failed? I also know that for some time SouthAfrica has been testing various devices, secretly, because of her political isolation,supplied by either the Americans, West Germany or the Israelis. What better placethan the Botswana, South African border with its desert-like conditions, to test theirweapons? Far away from large cities and the only human inhabitants,unsophisticated people like the Koi (bushmen) who would put down 'fire from theskies' to the temporary anger of their gods? Recently, I have been investigating a report in Cape Town (Christmas 1981-1982)where two witnesses observed a rocket-like object pass over the city in broaddaylight, clearly marked with the USA name and flag. If anyone else saw the object,there were no public reports. The missile, or whatever, was controlled, and I ambeginning to be more and more convinced that this indeed is what it was. A solidprojectile perhaps gone astray? Prior to receiving Walt Andrus's letter, I had a phone call from my daughter in CapeTown to say that a James Van Greunen had been on a television programme GoodMorning, South Africa. She reported him as a very personable young man whoseemed to have a sincere interest in UFOs and had formed a group in South Africacalled NUFORIN. Shortly afterwards, I had a phone call from Van Greunen saying he was interested incontacting a friend of mine (an investigator from Cape town, South Africa and at thesame time, extending an invitation to me to speak to his group on my way throughJohannesburg. He had 'heard' I was on my way down. I agreed, although we did notarrange a date nor a venue and he said he would telephone again and confirm this. Shortly afterwards, I heard from another source in Johannesburg, that apparently mytalk would be given on December 29. I was surprised that Van Greunen had notcontacted me, but as the date suited me I was not unduly worried. Within a fewdays, Van Greunen phoned again, confirming the date and mentioning the name of ahotel in Johannesburg where the talk was to be given. I did not take particular notice"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"as he said he would contact me upon arrival in Johannesburg and confirm all thearrangements. He knew where I would be staying and the time of my arrival. At the same time, he said that he might have to come to Zimbabwe for two or threedays and could I recommend somewhere for him to stay as he was having difficultyin finding accommodations. It was over the Christmas period and the hotels fullybooked. I said if it was only for 2 or 3 days, he could stay with me, but he must letme know in advance when he was arriving as I had numerous arrangements. A day later, I received a letter from a well-known British UFOlogist in which hewarned me about Van Greunen, saying he was an Intelligence Agent (of whatcountry?) and I should steer clear of him. I immediately phoned my British friendand told him what had happened. However, I also said I had nothing to fear fromany country's Intelligence and would let Van Greunen come and try to find out whathe was up to. As it happens, Van Greunen did not turn up, nor did I hear from him again. On the night of December 23, 1989, my telephone rang at about 9:30. I wassurprised to receive such a late call and assumed it was something urgent. When Ipicked up the receiver, I knew immediately it was a trunk call due to the sound inthe background. A male voice asked for me and when I identified myself, he saidimmediately (words to this effect):'I believe you are expecting James Van Greunen?' 'Yes.' 'Well, I am warning you: If he sets a foot over your threshold, you'll be introuble.' Of course, I was flabbergasted. 'What are you talking about?' 'I believe Van Greunen is on his way to you from South Africa to stay withyou. If he arrives and you let him into your house, you will be in serioustrouble.' I should have put the phone down, but I was intrigued. 'What is the problem with him?' 'He's a crook, a liar and a disgrace to South Africa. He's rubbish and has beenputting down his country.' 'What has he done?' I asked. 'I've told you and you will be the worse off if you let him into your home,' thevoice said. I could not place the man's accent, although it was not south African. Thevoice went on in this threatening vein if I played host to Van Greunen, so Iasked who he was. 'Nothing to do with you!' 'Well, don't you threaten me. I am not a South African. I'm a Zimbabwean.You cannot tell me what to do.' He said, 'I know you are a respected lady.' 'Yes, I am, and don't speak to me in that tone of voice.' And then came his piece de resistance: 'You have recently received a letter from Walt Andrus of Seguin, Texas, inwhich he asks you to investigate an incident on the Botswana border. Leavewell alone or it will be the worse for you!' I was taken aback. How did he know about Walt's letter which had comedirectly to me from the USA, together with copies of three other letters? 'What incident on the Botswana border?' I asked."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"'I am not prepared to say.' 'Do you mean the alleged crashed UFO?' I asked. 'I cannot discuss that. But I'm warning you, if you interfere ...' Here the call was abruptly cut off. The receiver was not replaced: the line justwent dead.'\" Continued in Part 21 - More from Cynthia Hind and Henry AzadehdelCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
