It's about ten miles west ofKnobel, Arkansas, where the first American fractal formation was discoveredin wheat on June 7, 2003. See More Information below. June 2, 2004 Peach Orchard, Arkansas - On the weekend of May 22-23, 2004, a cropduster pilot flew over a wheat field owned by Rodney Schimmings in Peach Orchard,Arkansas, and reported seeing a seven-spoked \"wagon wheel\" crop formation. UnlikeEngland, there are no tractor tramlines in the wheat. The farm owner told me he looked forsigns of entry, but could not find any. Reporter Fred Martin at the Clay County Couriernewspaper in Corning heard the news and arranged with Mr. Schimmings to takephotographs.

But he also found many plants that were broken over and someinvestigators such as Jeffrey Wilson and Ted Robertson http://www.cropcirclenews.comwonder if this formation was created with mechanical devices by people.Mr. Schimmings is upset that this crop formation occurred - the first on his property. \"I justdon't want a lot of publicity or people trying to get on my property. It's (farming) the way Imake my living. If something has caused this, I would like to know why or what. I'm goingto lose money over what has been done. My crop is laying flat to the ground.\"He was surprised when I told him that many crop formations occur every year in Europeancountries where the plants continue to grow and the farmers harvest the plants right alongwith the rest of the field. He said, \"I don't think that's the case here in my Arkansas field.But I planned to harvest now anyway.\" Other \"Spoke\" or \"Fan\" PatternsWatership Down, near Kingsclere, Newbury, Hampshire, England Reported July 6,1995"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Five whirling \"spokes\" inside circle at Watership Down, near Kingsclere, Newbury, Hampshire, England,reportedon July 6, 1995.

Aerial photograph © 1997 by Lucy Pringle.About this six-spoke \"fan\" in a ring below the intricate grid in a circle, researcher andauthor, Andy Thomas, wrote in his book Vital Signs, A Complete Guide to the Crop CircleMystery and why it is NOT a Hoax (Pages 67-68 in 2002 reprint):\"...the very unusual circle containing a standing rectangle divided into 780 smallsquare boxes, twenty-six along one side and thirty along the other. \"Researcher Michael Glickman immediately christened (the rectangle) the \"CalendarGrid' ... he surmised that if one took the side of twenty-six boxes as meaningtwenty-six weeks, that would give six months - roughly the time period crop circlesusually appeared every season. Calculating twenty-six times thirty would then givefifteen years. Fifteen years from 1997 would take us to 2012 - the date the ancientMayan calendar comes to an end and a time when many expect tumultuous planetaryevents to occur... \"Geoff Stray, 2012 expert, deepened the slightly disturbing connection further whenhe later realized that the Etchilhampton grid is divisible by exactly three \"Tzolkins\" -grids of thirteen by twenty squares that form the Mayan sacred calendar. In hisinfluential booklet, Beyond 2012, Geoff also points out that when the containingsquare is included to make 781 units, yet another meaning emerges: '781 is thenumber of 'bits' in Maurice Cotterell's 187-year sunspot cycle, which Cotterell hasrelated to the Mayan great cycle, ending in 2012. The accompanying six-pointedwhirling star would then represent the six rotating magnetic fields of the sun (twopolar and four equatorial) that cause the sunspot cycle.'\" More Information:June 7, 2003 Fractal Formation in Knobel, ArkansasAlso see 07-13-03 Earthfiles in Archive."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Ten-circle crop formation discovered in wheat on June 7, 2003,Knobel, Arkansas.

Caleigh had a camera and took four photographs of ten circles crisply laiddown in clockwise swirls amid the standing wheat.

One at Windmill Hill near Aveburyin 1996 covered a thousand feet in diameter with 194 circles in spiral arms.Triple Julia Set discovered July 29, 1996, at Windmill Hill, Wiltshire, Englandnear Avebury, the largest circle and avenue of standing sarsen stones in the British Isles,constructed around 3700 B.

Later they measured the circles. The biggest was in the center, which was 47 feetwide. In the outer three slightly curving arms, the biggest circle was 28 feet diameter, thenext was 17 feet diameter, and the smallest circles were 9 feet diameter."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Ten-circle crop formation discovered in wheat on June 7, 2003,Knobel, Arkansas.
