See 09-06-03 Earthfiles. September 5, 2004 Cincinnati, Ohio - Continuing interview with Jeffrey Wilson,Director, Independent Crop Circle Researchers Association (ICCRA), Cincinnati,Ohio:\"HILLSBORO IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE IN WHICH THE PLANTS WERE LAID ALLIN ONE DIRECTION. COULD YOU SUMMARIZE AGAIN THE LIST OFANOMALIES YOU'VE FOUND?Hillsboro has become extraordinarily complicated because we first received the report inearly July. We went out to visit the site and noticed right away that it's not in a largefarmer's field. It's in a pretty small field that was planted almost like a garden by thelandowners. It was a roughly circular shape that took up a pretty good chunk of this littlegarden plot which is about 40 feet by 40 feet.We did our normal investigation and we did find some unusual things. Although primarilythe plants were flattened in one direction, there were up to four layers swirled in differentways in different sections of that flattened area.Hillsboro, Ohio, corn plants flattened four layers deep going in"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"different directions. Photograph © 2004 by Jeffrey Wilson.So, we ruled out hoax pretty quickly. There was not any mechanical damage to be seen.We measured the nodes using the L-NEAT (Levengood Node Elongation Analysis Test),measuring the size of the nodes and they were statistically different from the crop that wasstill standing.We also measured a higher increase of radioactivity. We measured higher electromagneticfield strength. So, pretty much every test we did the first time around, Hillsboro passed andsaid to us it was an authentic formation. Ears of Corn AnomaliesThe growth stage of those plants were such that there were no ears of corn that haddeveloped to the point where we could do any kind of germination. So, after W. C.Levengood took a look at that, he said we ought to go back in a couple of months after theears had developed more and then we could do a germination study.In the meantime, we had looked at another crop circle in West Union, Ohio (possible hoax,but Levengood found anomalous soil particles. See 09-04-04 Earthfiles). One of our teammembers, Gene Thomas, on his return back home stopped at Hillsboro to see if the cornears had developed. Gene noticed that the field had been hit (by an unknown energysource) a second time. So we returned to the Hillsboro site to do a second investigation.The second section that was affected overlapped the first affected section and is almost asamazing as the first in terms of the anomalies we found inside the plants quite a bitdifferent than the first time we looked.LIKE WHAT?Light green stalk is at the far left in this photograph where corn huskswere torn off to expose the ear of corn. Surprisingly, there were holes between the kernels wherethe corn silk was attached to the testa, implying that internal gas and moisture in the kernelswere heated and escaped. Photograph © 2004 by Jeffrey Wilson.In this case, we found that the ears had developed in the field and that when we looked atthe ears that were in the flattened sections, the kernels in the ears had blown, very similarto how growth nodes blow in wheat stalks and sometimes in corn and other crop varieties.Whatever energies affected the plants, because the kernels were at a tender stage, internalgas and moisture appears to have escaped where the corn silk was attached to the testa inthe kernels. A few of the kernels actually expanded and did not explode. They areenlarged, but did not pop.Then it stunted the growth, pretty much halted the growth of the plants that were flattened.You will be able to see the difference between the ears of corn that were left in thestanding crop and the ears that were flattened a second time (by a second energy event) inthe photos below.Upper ear of corn has holes in testa where corn silk was attached before hypothesizedspinning plasma vortex interacted. It is also smaller than more normal ear below, implying stunted growthwhich has been documented in other corn formations in previous years. Also in the upper ear, you can seelarge \"balloon\" kernels that expanded and did not burst. Photograph © 2004 by Jeffrey WilsonIS THIS UNIQUE? HAS THIS EVER HAPPENED IN MAIZE CORN BEFORE?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"We know it happened in at least one other formation. We recorded that in an investigationa couple of years ago in Hemlock, Michigan. We looked at two circles in corn there andwhere the tops of the kernels were blown completely off, so that energy was even moreintense. (Report by biophysicist W. C. Levengood to be reprinted at Earthfiles.com in thefuture.)Another thing we found was that in one section of the field that was kind of at the crux ofwhere both flattened sections overlapped, there was about a 12 foot section of the cornthat was left standing, but had completely dried out and turned brown, whereas everythingelse in the field was still green as if it had been subjected to heat and completely dried out.So, that was quite unusual.Twelve foot section of standing corn that completely dried out and turned brown surroundedby normal green corn, as if subjected to heat energy. Photograph © 2004 by Jeffrey Wilson.The third thing we noticed was that on one section of the field where the plants had beenflattened kind of at the start of where they had been flattened, the plants there on one sidehad been subjected to some energy that changed or destroyed the chlorophyll in the greenplant and left them with this deep reddish-purple color (anthocyanin).\"Editor's Note: Anthocyanin is a pigment that reflects the red to blue range of the visiblespectrum. It is often observed in the plant kingdom, where it serves to color anything fromfruits to the autumn leaves. It can be used as pH indicator because it changes from red inacids to blue in bases.\"The reason we say it was directed from one side is that the color only appears on one sideof the stalks, as if some of the plants shaded other plants and you can see where theexposure of the exposed part of the plant turned red, but the shaded part is still left green.It's a little similar to the example of Close Encounters of the Third Kind when RichardDreyfuss's character looks at the UFO and half of his face turns red and the other half isunaffected because it was in the shadow. That's essentially what has happened to the cornin this field in one section the plants have turned a brilliant red, but there are shadow marksthat leave no doubt that something shadowed them or protected them from turning red.Above: Reddish-purple color on one side of corn stalks is anthocyanin which is a residuewhen chlorophyll disintegrates. Below: Jeffrey Wilson wrote on image: \"Plant turned 1/4 turn. Red colorationis only on one side of plant and shows 'shadow of leaf' fell on corn from stalk blocking (shading) partof the affected area\" (from the energy).

I'm sure there have been other ones that have anomalies,but at least we have been documenting this process unintentionally because we have had torepeatedly visit there.I also have to say in this case we came across one particular stalk in the Hillsboroformation that had bending to it that no one has ever reported before. We had bending in astair step motion where there were 5 separate almost 90-degree bends to this particularstalk.THAT WOULD BE HARD TO DO IN CORN, WOULDN'T IT?Yes, it would. I would say it was also not bent at the ground, but it was bent about 18inches at least off the ground before the bending started. We've never seen anything thatlooked like that before and that came as a surprise.Highly unusual corn stalk in Hillsboro, Ohio, downed crop in which the entirestalk was purple with anthocyanin and stair stepped in five segments which began eighteeninches above the ground. Photograph © 2004 by Jeffrey Wilson.Biophysicist Levengood says, \"This one stalk received a very high dose of thephenomenon energy that converts some of the natural sugars in the plants to anthocyanin.If you cut the stalk open, it's all in the aleurone layer which is a sub-epidermal layer. It'sthere because that's where anthocyanin forms in leaves and plants when the chlorophylldisintegrates. I don't ever remember seeing the anthocyanin so heavy in a stalk before.\"Editor's Note: Aleurone Layer is the layer found in some plant seeds that excretesenzymes used to promote embryonic growth. Gibberellin, a family of growth hormones,enters the aleurone layer which induces the release of these enzymes. These promote thebreakdown of starch into sugar that can be used by the embryo as energy.I asked Levengood what would disintegrate the chlorophyll in that one stalk? \"Themicrowave energy of the spinning plasma vortex that I think is involved can be so selectivein crop formations. It can injure plants in one area and you move a few feet and the energyhas enhance growth and vigor.\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Measuring Force Necessary to Break Corn Stalk FibersBiophysicist W. C. Levengood, Grass Lake, Michigan: \"On the plant nodes, I took thethird node up from the soil and on the outside of the bend I did some very roughexperiments about a year ago to determine what force it would take to break the outerfibers in a wheat plant compared to those in corn. I did a cantilever beam test. It took 17times more force to break a corn stalk than a wheat stalk. So, you are talking about veryhigh energies here.I looked at the outside of the expansion of the node and I took microscopic cross-sectionsof the cells and I found that the inner cells had expanded 5 to 10 times compared with thenormal nodes. But very uniformly and directionally, as you would expect, since it's thelongitudinal axis that bends. Left: Normal Hillsboro, Ohio, corn cells from growth nodes. Right: Hillsboro corn formation cells enlargedfive to ten times compared with normal node cells. Photomicrographs © 2004 by W. C. Levengood.SO YOU HAVE BOTH CHANGES IN THE NODES OF THE CORN AND THEMAGNETITE/HEMATITE EGG-LIKE PARTICLES IN THE SOIL.That's right.SO WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THAT HILLSBORO CORN, IT WAS NOT NORMALWIND ENERGY?Oh, absolutely not.\"Jeffrey Wilson: \"The Hillsboro site is going to be one that people should be talking aboutfor awhile because of how many anomalies we documented there. And for Levengood even after he has looked at several hundred circles to be, in his words, \"astounded andamazed\" at some of the things we found there really speaks something to just what it iswe're dealing with there at Hillsboro. It's really incredible stuff. It may be lost on somepeople because of the subtlety of it, but these are several things we have never seen beforeand Levengood's work may be taking this to something of a new level.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Jeffrey Wilson making field notes from instruments after first July 5, 2004, Hillsboro, Ohio,first report of downed corn.
