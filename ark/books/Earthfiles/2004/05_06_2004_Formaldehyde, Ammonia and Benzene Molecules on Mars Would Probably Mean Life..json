Â© 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe \"Speculation is that already methane is a rather strong indicator life is probablypresent today on Mars. Just simply based on methane. ...Formaldehyde is destroyedin the Martian atmosphere within 7.5 hours. There is no way that formaldehyde canexist and remain for a long time in the Martian atmosphere. If (formaldehyde)confirmed, possibly life on Mars today, yes.\" - Vittorio Formisano, Ph.D., Physicist The Planetary Fourier Spectrometer (PFS) mounted on the Mars Expressspacecraft in orbit around Mars has already confirmed a surprisingly large amount of methanein the Martian atmosphere. See 03/31/04 Earthfiles. If molecules of formaldehyde,benzene and ammonia are also confirmed, it would definitely mean biological lifeprocesses are at work on Mars. ESA 2001 Illustration by Medialab.May 6, 2004 Rome, Italy - Back on March 31, 2004, I reported at Earthfiles.com thatmethane measurements in the Martian atmosphere are being analyzed by Physicist VittorioFormisano, Ph.D., Principal Investigator of the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer (PFS)which he built and is mounted on the European Space Agency's (ESA) Mars ExpressOrbiter designed to detect methane and other gaseous molecules. Dr. Formisano is based atthe Institute of Physics and Interplanetary Science in Rome, Italy, and has been commutingto ESA offices in Darmstadt, Germany to gather more data from the Planetary FourierSpectrometer in hopes that he will be able to confirm the location of one or more sources ofthe Martian methane. In March, he hoped he would be able to make a definitive statementat the European Geophysical Union (EGU) conference on April 26, 2004, in Nice, France.2004 EGU meeting was held in Nice, France, from April 26-30,in which Dr. V. A. Krasnopolsky from America's NASA Goddard presented his dataand argument that methane in the Martian atmosphere means life processes are at work today on Mars.At the EGU meeting, physicist, V. A. Krasnopolsky, formerly from Russia and nowworking for NASA/Goddard in Greenbelt, Maryland, presented a paper entitled, \"Detectionof methane in the Martian atmosphere: Evidence for life.\" Dr. Krasnopolsky has accessonly to ground-based telescopes on Earth to look for methane, not the highly sensitive PFSthat Dr. Formisano is monitoring. However, Dr. Krasnopolsky hypothesized that theamount of methane in the Martian atmosphere indicates continual replenishment from asource that he thinks is more likely to be biological life than periodic volcanic outgassing ormeteorite impacts.Dr. Formisano tends to agree, but he is holding off his announcement, pending more datafrom his search for other molecules of life such as benzene, ammonia and formaldehyde."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"He hinted to me this week that such molecules have already been detected and thepresence of formaldehyde alone in the Martian atmosphere would mean biologicalprocesses at work.Physicist and Professor Vittorio Formisano, Ph.D., Principal Investigatorof Planetary Fourier Spectrometer (PFS) which detected methane in the Martian atmosphere.Dr. Formisano is based in Rome, Italy.

With the best of this new data, in thefuture I will be able to say something about the source of methane.What I would like to do is first produce a map of methane in the Martian atmosphere andthen check if the possible source gives us any hint in terms of volcanic or hydrothermalactivity. There is also the search for other molecules that may be indicators of possiblebiological origin. A few of these are:-benzene-ammonia-formaldehydeThese are biological markers. What I want to do is search for these other molecules,identify them in the PFS data and then eventually try to build an overall picture of what isgoing on in the Martian atmosphere today. Maybe the picture could be similar to what wehad on the Earth 4 billion years ago when there was a biological origin of methane andother strange gases. Let's not forget that even oxygen is produced today by biologicalorigins. Meaning of Variable Methane Distribution On Marsand Presence of Benzene, Ammonia and Formaldehyde?If the methane on Mars were due to OH photochemistry in the Martian atmosphere, thenmethane should have a life time of 300-400 years and should be uniform throughout theentire atmosphere. But it is not uniform. So there must be a 'sink' of methane somewhere.On Earth there are sinks of methane with OH and oxidation with oxygen in the Earth'satmosphere which are indications of biological activity and can be linked to biologicalthings in the soil.HAVE YOU FOUND ANY OF THE MOLECULES SUCH AS BENZENE ANDFORMALDEHYDE IN THE MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE SO FAR?I am not ready to answer this question today.BECAUSE?Because before stating publicly anything concerning other molecules, I want to be sure anddiscuss with my colleagues and I want to have a reasonable interpretation of the results.THIS RELATES TO YOUR STATEMENT TO ME EARLIER, 'BY SEPTEMBER, IWANT TO DEMONSTRATE THERE IS LIFE ON MARS TODAY.'That is my goal, yes.THE REASON WHY YOU FEEL SOME CONFIDENCE IS BECAUSE YOU HAVESEEN SOME DATA OF THESE OTHER MOLECULES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITHLIFE PROCESSES?Maybe.WHY IS THIS SO DIFFICULT TO DISCUSS?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"You know very well. First of all, the abundance of these molecules is not very large.Therefore, it is rather difficult to detect these molecules. I need to collect many data inorder to increase the signal to noise ratio, in order to be sure that I am detecting something.The most difficult was, I think, just the methane. The rest should be easier, but one has tobe careful not to make statements which later should be changed.WOULD BENZENE AND FORMALDEHYDE BE IN THE MARTIAN ATMOSPHEREIF THERE WAS NO LIFE PROCESSES ON MARS?The formaldehyde is destroyed in the Martian atmosphere within 7.5 hours. There is noway that formaldehyde can exist and remain for a long time in the Martian atmosphere. Idon't know about the benzene, but I know this about formaldehyde.SO, IF THERE ARE MOLECULES OF FORMALDEHYDE COMING UP IN THE DATA,THAT IS A STRONG INDICATOR THAT SOME KIND OF LIFE PROCESS IS GOINGON ON MARS?If confirmed, possibly life on Mars today, yes.IN TERMS OF TRYING TO FIND SOURCE POINTS, AS WE DISCUSSED BEFORE,WHAT KIND OF PROGRESS ARE YOU MAKING IN FINDING THE SOURCE POINTSOF THE METHANE, AND POSSIBLY FORMALDEHYDE, BENZENE ANDAMMONIA?These I cannot say anything about now simply, as I say, the new data came the end of Apriland we have not had enough time to confirm them.BUT YOU ARE GETTING GOOD, SOLID DATA?Absolutely, yes, and I hope in the future to be able to say something more.DO YOU THINK THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE A REPORT ABOUT THISINCREASINGLY SOLID DATA BEFORE SEPTEMBER?I don't know. Possibly at COSPAR which is at the end of July in Paris.\"COSPAR stands for Committee on Space Research, an international association whichmeets every two years. The 2002 COSPAR was in the United States. This year it is in Paris. The 35th COSPAR Scie ntific Asse mbly will be held in Paris, France, July 18-25, 2004.ARE YOU GOING TO BE IN ROME THE REST OF THE SUMMER?Darmstadt or we have to follow the experiments and organize the files that need to be sentto the spacecraft and we are continuously going back and forth to Holland or Germany(ESA offices). Next week I go again, but this is normal. NASA/Goddard Scientist Goes On Record: Methane Means Life On MarsOn Tuesday, April 27, 2004, at 8:30 a.m. before the European Geophysical Union meetingin Nice, France, physicist V. A. Krasnopolsky formerly from Russia and now living andworking for NASA/Goddard in Maryland, presented a paper entitled, Detection of methanein the Martian atmosphere: Evidence for life.Vittorio Formisano: \"I have exchanged e-mails with Dr. Mumma at NASA/Goddard. AndI talked directly with Dr. V. A. Krasnopolsky, who reported methane detection in theEuropean Geophysical Union meeting last week in Nice, France. Krasnopolsky reported atthe EGU his detection from ground-based telescopes, very difficult measurements, I would"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"say, of methane essentially the same amount that I have seen on Mars. He has nopossibility to study variation over Mars because it is very difficult from Earth to do thatsort of measurement.THEN IS YOUR EXPERIMENT ON THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY'S ORBITERTHE CLOSEST THAT WE'VE EVER GOTTEN IN TERMS OF SOPHISTICATEDTECHNOLOGY TO MEASURE METHANE ON MARS?Absolutely, yes. I think it is the only one that could detect methane at Mars, because youneed high spectral resolution. This was never available in the past.SO THE DATA YOU ARE RECEIVING NOW AS WE GO INTO MAY OF 2004,SHOULD BE THE MOST ACCURATE, SOLID DATA THAT WE HAVE EVER SEENFOR METHANE, BENZENE, FORMALDEHYDE AND THOSE KINDS OFMOLECULES IN THE MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE?Yes, for methane. For the rest, I have not yet identified, so you should separate themethane which is identified and the value the ratio, the percentage is well known now. Weagree with Dr. Mumma and Dr. Krasnopolsky on the average value of methane in theMartian atmosphere.About the other molecules, we will see. But certainly, thanks to the spectral resolutionsensitivity of the PFS instrument that I have produced, the data we are collecting are thebest available to search for other molecules and to give an answer to the question that youwere also raising previously.WHICH IS?Which is obviously the most important, interesting question: Is life present on Mars today?WHAT IS YOUR GUESS?You want me to give an answer now? I prefer to give an answer in September.OR JULY IN PARIS?Or July maybe, yes.BUT EVEN MAKING A GUESS ON WHAT YOU KNOW NOW? A SPECULATION?Speculation is that already methane is a rather strong indicator life is probably presenttoday on Mars. Just simply based on methane.RIGHT. THAT'S FAIR AND YOU WOULD BE SAYING THAT BECAUSE OF THEQUANTITY AND VARIABILITY?Yes, and the fact that you need a source and the source is not photochemistry. The otherpossibilities hydrothermal, volcanic, external sources are possible, but they shouldcontribute much less on the basis of the experience of what happens on Earth.WHEN YOU HAVE TALKED WITH DR. MUMMA AND HIS RUSSIAN COLLEAGUEABOUT THE METHANE DATA, HAVE THE THREE OF YOU DISCUSSED THISQUESTION: ARE WE LOOKING AT DATA THAT IS PROVING THERE ARE LIFEPROCESSES ON MARS TODAY?I have not discussed with Mumma and not very much with Krasnopolsky. He presented atthe EGU his conclusions and we essentially agreed. He was already making a firmstatement about the presence of life on Mars. I think it is better on the basis of methanealone not to make a firm statement. It is likely. I am going to search for other molecules. Ican do this with the PFS data. Other experimenters cannot do it, because you need to go toa telescope that takes a lot of time. I already have data in my hands which can tell me ifthere is something or not. I only need to collect more data and to look at them. So for me,this is rather easy to do and will take some time obviously. But then I should be in aposition to produce possibly convincing answers.BECAUSE YOU HAVE AN INSTRUMENT THAT IS ACTUALLY ORBITING MARS,WILL BE THE MOST ACCEPTABLE DATA AND CONCLUSION THAT HAS BEENDONE IN SCIENCE TO DATE, CORRECT?Ye s .AND THAT IS WHY YOU ARE BEING VERY CAREFUL?Absolutely, yes."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Implications of Finding Life on MarsBECAUSE WHEN YOU MAKE YOUR ANNOUNCEMENT, IT SHOULD BEDEFINITIVE?Exactly. I am convinced also that - honestly speaking, I have been working for 16 years toproduce a PFS because it was produced previously for the Russian mission to Mars 1996,which failed as you know. I was certainly hoping to see methane, but I never thought of allthe implications and consequences. I had no time for that. And now, I am thinking andlooking around and learning a lot and the implications are just incredible! One can sayfascinating, but I think more than that. From human culture point of view, this is somethingimportant to know that maybe life at least started on another planet.\"Dr. Formisano said that if he is not ready to report his Martian atmosphere data during theJuly COSPAR conference in Paris, then he will be ready for the Italian Space Agencyconference about Mars held September 19-23 - on Ischia island near Naples. By then, heexpects to confirm both the source of methane on Mars and other life-related molecules.By now, another groundbreaking instrument aboard the European Mars Express Orbiterwas supposed to be looking deep underground on Mars for water and ice. That is theMARSIS radar instrument designed to penetrate rock and soil down to a depth of fivekilometers, or three miles, according to ESA.MARSIS main antenna during Mars Express payload tests. NASA describes,\"One of the two main radar booms is shown here, a 20-meter long hollow cylinder folded upin a box like an accordion. When the box is opened, the elastic energy of the compressed glass-fibrebooms will let them unfold like a jack-in-the-box.\" Image credit: University der Bundeswehr, Germany.But on April 29th, the MARSIS team told ESA it had to delay the deployment of the radarbecause computer simulations suggest the radar booms could swing harder than engineersexpected and damage Mars Express instruments. So, new plans are being tested. Once thedeep ground-penetrating radar is turned on, it might see a lot of underground water and ice.You combine that with Dr. Formisano's methane, and possible benzene, ammonia andformaldehyde data and we might be very close to those three-inch-high newspaperheadlines we've all been waiting for: 'LIFE ON MARS' - even if it's only undergroundbacteria.More Information:Important 1996 Article About Underground Earth BacteriaRelevant to Martian Life QuestionExcerpts from: \"Life Underground\" Â© 1996 by G. Jeffrey Taylor, Hawaii Institute ofGeophysics and Plantology, University of Hawaii.\"On Earth, it turns out that there is a vast ecosystem of microorganisms undergroundand much of this system does not depend on sunlight and photosynthesis. Some ofthese microorganisms live off the rocks that house them. Todd O. Stevens and JamesP. McKinley of the Pacific Northwest Laboratory in Richland, Washington, havebeen studying groundwater in the Columbia River basalts, located in thenorthwestern U. S. mainland. (Initial results published in October 20, 1995, issue ofthe journal Science.) \"The water in the wells studied by Stevens and McKinley has resided in the rocks fora long time, up to 35,000 years, judging from the very low content of carbon-14,"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"which is produced in the atmosphere. As a result, the water contains essentially nodissolved oxygen. The low carbon-14 and dissolved oxygen contents are not found inwater sources near the surface, showing that the deep well water has not beencontaminated by shallower water as it is pumped to the surface. \"Analysis of the well water show that it contains surprisingly high amounts ofdissolved hydrogen gas, H2, and methane, CH4. Cultures of the water alsodemonstrated the presence of several types of bacteria. Stevens and McKinleysuspected that the H2 was made by the reaction of the oxygen-poor water withiron-bearing minerals in the rocks. Prime candidates are pyroxene and olivine,minerals rich in iron and common in basalts. The reaction would produce iron in amore oxidized state, making minerals such as magnetite. \"... the methane was made by bacteria that used the hydrogen and carbon dioxide inthe water. High methane contents were associated with enrichments of carbon-12over carbon-13. This change in isotopic ratio is characteristic of methane producedby bacteria during the reduction of carbon dioxide. Stevens and McKinley alsodevised two experiments to see if these reactions would take place and if bacteriacould live in an environment consisting of oxygen-free water and rock.\" Rock and Water Produce Increasing Amounts of Hydrogen In their first experiment, the scientists used sterilized water that contained nodissolved oxygen in which they put sterilized crushed basalt and sealed the mixturein glass tubes. The hydrogen content of the water became higher the longer thesample sat in a dark, wet environment, indicating that the water reacted with therock. When iron-poor rocks such as granites and sandstones were tried, \"nosignificant amount of hydrogen was produced.\" Microorganisms in the Rock in the Dark \"In their second experiment, Stevens and McKinley used sterilized basalt as a culturemedium to see if bacteria could live in the rock in the dark. They put water fromdeep wells into tubes containing the sterilized basalt and examined them after variouslengths of time for up to one year. The water was not processed in any way topreserve the bacteria that was in it. Under these dark, oxygen-starved conditions, therock-water interactions are the only source of energy possible. No sunlight reachedthe capsules, so photosynthesis could not take place. Remarkably, even after a year,bacteria were thriving in this unusual environment. Above : Images of unidentified bacteria growing in dark, oxygen-starved conditionstaken with a special microscope called a scanning laser confocal microscope. The laser reflectsoff the rock surfaces and shows up green. The bacteria were dyed with a chemical and appear red in the laserlight.Below: Unidentified bacteria, perhaps unknown species, of bacteria that can live deep undergroundif only de-oxygenated water and iron-bearing minerals are present."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" \"In an article in the July 1992 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy ofSciences, Thomas Gold of Cornell University has tried to calculate the amount ofsubsurface life in comparison with the above ground life all around us. ...Assumingthat the upper 5 kilometers of Earth has a porosity of 3% (amount of space availablefor water in a rock or sediment) and that 1% of the mass of the water filling the porespaces was bacteria, then the total mass of bacteria would be 200 trillion metric tons. \"Putting it another way, Gold points out that this is equivalent to a layer on the orderof 1.5 meters high covering the entire Earth! This is more than the existing plant andanimal life on the surface, which is estimated to be about a trillion metric tons. \"As Stevens and McKinley point out in their article in Science, such SubsurfaceLithoautotrophic Microbial Ecosystem, or SLiME for short, does not requirephotosynthesis or oxygen. ...'SLiME conceivably provides a model for the existenceof contemporary life on Mars because basalt, liquid water and bicarbonate arebelieved to be present in the Martian subsurface.' \"If life exists on Mars today, we can guess where it could be found. Bacteria requireliquid water at least some of the time, so the temperature cannot be permanentlybelow freezing. Present day Mars has permanently frozen ground near the surface,perhaps down to a depth of a few kilometers, so life is unlikely to be flourishingthere. ...So, if life exists on Mars today, the most likely place where it could be foundis in a small region between 10 and 20 kilometers beneath the surface.\" Also see: March 31, 2004 Earthfiles, Methane on Mars - Biology?
