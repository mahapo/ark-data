Back then, it was sparsely populated with ranches, a few homes, and a cluster of mobile homes. August 20, 2004 DeLand, Florida - By mid-September 1968, Jim Oglesby had beengoing out nightly to watch the skies around Bithlo, Florida, for the unidentified glowingobjects he had been seeing there since New Year's Eve 1967. (See Part 1) In addition tothe mysterious craft that seemed to provoke military helicopters and jets to arrive, Jim hadseen both a red glowing \"cigar\" and an amber beam of light right above the orange grove atthe edge of Pickett Lake in February to March 1968. Then about six months later onSeptember 16, 1968, it was such a memorable evening that he wrote what happened in ajournal he kept about all his sightings. That night, he was parked in front of the orangegrove around 7:30 p.m. He had invited his mother, niece, and a friend and fellow employeenamed Larry Kelly, who brought along one of his friends.

Postal Service letter carrier 1977 to 1987;former machine tool technician for Bendix Corp.'s Cape Canaveral's Apollo 11program in the 1960s; U. S. Navy in Vietnam from February 1962 to June 8, 1966,now living in DeLand, Florida: \"Suddenly the five of us looked up north from where wewere standing and I saw an amber beam of light. It just flooded the top of the orange grove.I reacted by climbing over the gate holding an 8mm movie camera in my left hand andbegan running toward the end of the orange grove. As I got down to the end, I stopped. Ifelt very apprehensive because I knew that something was going on near the shore of LakePickett."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"So I turned left and I started running west and there were piles of debris, old orange treesand that sort of thing stacked up. But I kept running and I felt like there was somethinggoing on that I should not be in there. I stopped and I'm sweating and my heart is pounding.About this time, Larry Kelly and his buddy almost ran into the back of me because theywere trying to find their way through the dark.YOU STOPPED BECAUSE INTUITIVELY YOU HAD A SENSE OF FEAR?Yes, very apprehensive sense of fear that I was running headlong into something I was notfamiliar with, that I did not understand.SO WHAT HAPPENED?I'm trying to look through the dark and I see on the left hand side of the debris where I'mstanding an outline of a greyish oval shape. It seemed to be probably several feet above theground. I'm looking at this with Larry Kelly and his buddy. I'm very panicky, ready to boltat any second, because I sensed that something strange was going on.We saw an oval-shaped craft very distinctly hovering several feet above the shoreline (ofPickett Lake in Bithlo). Then I saw a pair of car lights come on, probably 60-70 feet to theright of where I was standing. At that time, we just froze and stood very still. The car lightsstarted to turn, so we knew the car was turning around. At that time, we turned around andbolted back to where we were parked on the curb and stood there watching from behindbushes.White headlights of dark sedan shine out toward Pickett Lake in Bithlo, Florida,past an oval-shaped craft hovering several feet above the shoreline, while Jim Oglesby and histwo friends watch from behind bushes. Illustration © 2004 by Jim Oglesby.WHAT DID YOU THINK WAS GOING ON?I can only draw this conclusion because of previous things that happened back in Februaryand March which tied in with this September 15th event. I thought maybe there was anextraterrestrial craft rendezvous with someone in the dark sedan and I could only figure thecar would have been from Cape Canaveral.YOUR IMPLICATION IS THAT SOMEBODY FROM CAPE CANAVERAL, ORSOMEBODY OFFICIAL, WAS ON A RENDEZVOUS WITH WHATEVER WAS INTHAT DISK?Correct.NOW, COULD YOU GO BACK TO FEBRUARY AND MARCH 1968 AND EXPLAINWHAT IT WAS YOU SAW THAT RESONATED FOR YOU SO STRONGLY WITH THESEPTEMBER 15, 1968 EVENT? February 17, 1968 - Red, Glowing Cigar-Shaped Aerial ObjectAt approximately 7:30 p.m., I was traveling east on State Road 420 when suddenly a red,luminous cylindrical-shaped, or cigar-shaped, object rose above the field to my left. Itaimed its nose skyward at an oblique angle and then glided along perpendicular to my carbefore zipping away. The incident happened about a hundred yards west of the followingencounter."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Jim Oglesby traveling on State Road 420 in Bithlo on February 17, 1968,around 7:30 p.m., sees red, glowing cigar-shaped object.

I was parked near thecorner of State Road 420 and Old Fort Christmas Road. I observed a flashing blue lightappear above cattle in field across the Fort Christmas Road where I was parked. The cattlehad bedded down for the night. The flashing blue light remained stationary above thecattle. Cows became freaked by the strange flashing light and began to run around in acircle.Moments later, the flashing blue light vanished from sight as a jet came in from anortheasterly direction. The jet flew low and directly over the location where the flashingblue light had vanished from moments earlier. The jet then banked to the south and did notcome back for a second pass.The flashing blue light returned to its original location above the cattle. The cowscontinued to run helter-skelter around the general area, obviously quite agitated anddisturbed by the mysterious blue light. I watched the blue light for several seconds before itvanished from sight.Jim Oglesby was parked near the corner of State Road 420 and Old Fort Christmas Roadon February 27, 1968, around 7:30 p.m., when a flashing blue light appeared above cattle, soonfollowed by the appearance of a jet.

March 4, 1968 - B-52 Appears Above Cattle PastureAbout five days later on March 4, 1968, around 8:30 p.m., I was parked off the side of FortChristmas Road about two hundred yards southeast of the February 27, 1968, event withblue flashing light over the cattle. I watched a B-52 rise above the dark tree line on thesouth or right side of Fort Christmas Road. The mammoth plane was just above thetreetops and was headed in a westerly direction.Suddenly, a brilliant flash of light emitted from beneath the huge jet. The brilliant lightscame in sequences of threes. I counted four sequences. At that point, I could no longer seethe jet, but moments later I heard the powerful jets kick in. I reasoned that the crew'smission was completed and they were returning to Patrick Air Force Base.I listened until the thunderous roar of the jet engines were out of hearing range. Iconcluded that one or more UFOs had been identified on radar a few minutes earlier and"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"the B-52 had been sent to the UFO hot spot to attempt to photograph whatever washappening. Hence, the brilliant flashes of light emitted from the plane's belly.Jim Oglesby parked near the cattle and jet event on March 4, 1968, around 8:30 p.m.,when a B-52 suddenly rose up over trees emitting a bright flashof light from its belly.

March 6, 1968 - Red, Glowing \"Cigar-shaped\" Aerial ObjectJim Oglesby standing on front steps of Bithlo, Florida, mobile home when red cigar-shapedaerial object rises up above trees near the curve on State Road 420. Illustration © 2004 by Jim Oglesby.On the night of March 6, 1968, I was standing outside on the front porch of my brother-in-law's mobile home and I was scanning the skies as usual and I was looking north tonortheast position. I was waiting on a friend of mine, Bill Barber. He was going to comeover that night and join me. He was interested in some of the UFO activity that I hadalleged I was seeing. So I was watching for his car lights to show up because I knew thedirection he was coming. So while I was standing on the porch, and this was probablyaround 7:30 p.m. and it was a very clear and cold night. I'm looking in that direction northto northeast direction and the first thing I noticed was a red-amber cylindrical glow risingup from an area and then it kind of tilted up and slanted on an oblique angle. I'm going toguess it moved 300 to 400 feet and seemed to be just above the curve on State Road 420.THIS LIGHT THAT YOU SAW COMING UP WAS FROM BEHIND THE TREES THATSURROUND PICKETT LAKE?Yes. As it rose up, it paused above the road. At that time, I noticed a pair of car lights wasweaving its way along State Road 420 and several minutes later, it pulled up in the frontyard and it was my friend, Bill Barber. So, I shared the experience with him which gavehim some cold chills when I told him he had passed under the luminous red cylindrical-shaped object. I concluded it was the same object that I had seen on February 17. March 17, 1968 - Amber Beam of Light"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Jim Oglesby standing in the yard near his brother-in-law's Bithlo, Florida, mobile homewhen an amber beam of light suddenly appeared above the trees near spot ofprevious red, cigar-shaped object. Illustration © 2004 by Jim Oglesby.On the evening of March 17, 1968, I'm standing out in the front yard and I see an amberbeam of light just suddenly appear in the darkness.THIS IS DIFFERENT. THE MARCH 6 WAS A RED GLOWING OBJECT. NOW YOUARE SEEING AN AMBER BEAM OF LIGHT.Correct. It just seemed to appear in the dark. If I think back to the March 6 event, I amthinking that this amber beam of light was more of a north direction, to the left of theMarch 6 event. So, it was probably on for three or four seconds. I even pointed it out to mybrother-in-law. He was a little uneasy about all the strange anomalous lights that wereappearing and events that were happening around his home. So, he went back to his mobilehome. By that time, the amber beam of light had gone out.AND YOU ARE MAKING A LINK TO THE SEPTEMBER 15, 1968, BECAUSE YOUHAD SEEN THE RED, GLOWING DISK-SHAPED OBJECT AND THE AMBER BEAMIN ABOUT THE SAME AREA OF LAKE PICKETT AS THE EVENT ON SEPTEMBER15 SAW THE CAR LIGHTS COME ON WHEN THE OBJECT WAS AT THE LAKE ASWELL?Correct. I even went down to the lake and measured the distance from the end of theorange grove up to the point where I had observed the September 15th red oval or circularcraft that night. I had come up with about 200 to 250 feet.So if I am going back to my position at March 6 and I'm looking at the angle that I saw theamber-red glowing object and then on March 17 where I saw the amber beam of light andthere's only 250 or so feet difference, then it's in close proximity to the September 15thevent. March 19, 1968 - Blue Light Flashing from RodOn this particular cold, clear night between 7:30 to 7:40 p.m., I remember sitting at thetable eating dinner when I got a sudden impulse to go outside. I excused myself and slippedquietly outside. I stood on the porch for a moment and then I went down the steps, aroundthe front of the mobile trailer and moved slowly to the backside of the trailer. I peakedaround the corner and saw hovering very close to the living room windows a metallic diskabout two feet or so in diameter. On the top and nearest me was a flashing blue lightcoming from what appeared to be a thin cylindrical-shaped rod. I could see the flashingblue light reflected off the metallic surface of the small disk.As soon as my eyes locked onto the small disk, it shot up and for the moment seemed tohave vanished. However, as I scanned the terrain west of my position, I caught sight of thesmall disk as it was gliding along at a steady pace until it vanished."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Jim Oglesby looking outside Bithlo mobile home on March 19, 1968, discovered small,metallic disk about two feet in diameter hovering near the living room windowsand flashing a blue light.

My brotherGary had told Bill about some of the UFO sightings that he and I had watched on numerousoccasions. He brought with him that night a six-pack of beer. The three of us were standingin the kitchen listening to music and enjoying the beer. Suddenly, I noticed a blue spherehovering in the middle of the living room. It was about two feet in diameter. All three of uswatched the sphere vibrate intensely before it zipped to the right and literally passed rightthrough the wall on the west side of the house.Jim Oglesby with his brother, Gary, and friend, Bill, were amazed the night of March 20, 1968,when a blue sphere suddenly appeared hovering in the middle of the living room wherethey were talking and drinking beer.

February 1970 - Blond Beings and Time TravelYOU AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT YOUR FIRSTHAND EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTSAS A PERSON WHO WAS WORKING IN CAPE CANAVERAL AT THE TIME THATWE WERE SENDING UP THE APOLLOS. JULY OF 1969 WAS THE FIRST TIMETHAT WE HAD MEN ON THE MOON. YOU WERE SEEING ALL OF THESEUNUSUAL EVENTS. AT ANY POINT IN YOUR LIFE, DID YOU EVER HAVE ANYKIND OF A FACE-TO-FACE OR OTHER INTERACTION WITH WHAT YOU THINKMIGHT BE THE INTELLIGENCE, OR ONE OF THE INTELLIGENCES, ASSOCIATEDWITH THE CRAFT?In February 1970, I had been sharing a lot of the experiences with various individuals andthe word was spreading around the general area where I was working. A man namedGeorge Hughes, who I think worked for Boeing at the time and was interested in the UFOactivity, came out to visit me one night. Even though it was only around 9:00 p.m., my wifehad already retired to bed because her work day starts early. George and I were sitting at"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the kitchen table to look at some UFO documents and pictures he had brought. I wassharing some of my experiences when I felt a presence in the house. George also looked atme and said, 'Someone is in the house.'We were looking around and I couldn't feel a localized energy. It just seemed to be in thehouse. It didn't seem to be in one specific spot. We talked awhile longer, but my attentionwas on the presence or energy that seemed to be looking in on us at the table. After Georgeleft, I went to bed and found it very hard to sleep. I tossed and turned and rememberedseeing the clock at 10:05 p.m. That's when I thought a figure was standing next to the bed.Because it was dark, I could not make out any physical features. Then it was as if thebedroom faded away and part of me (not my body) started rising vertically like a fastelevator. When the acceleration stopped, I was looking at a very beautiful craft and a beingthat looked straight at me with deeply penetrating, clear, dark blue eyes.WHAT COLOR WAS THE CRAFT?Whitish, kind of bluish. But the sky was very white, very brilliant, with some blue in it.Very, very bright, intense.Blond being and \"beautiful craft\" which humans were being transported to from Earth,as Jim Oglesby remembers from an out of body experience in February 1970. Illustration © 2004 by JimOglesby.The being that seemed to be looking directly at me - or through me - spoke three words,yet his lips did not move. So I took this to be telepathic. He said, 'We have come.' And Inoticed that his arms were raised out and facing forward.Artistic rendition of the blond being in close-up, based on what Jim saw as the beingstood in front of the craft. Illustration © 2004 by Jim Oglesby.Then I noticed off to the sides of this incredibly beautiful craft and the blond being, therewere ships rising and ships descending and there were people getting out of the craft thatascended after being picked up from Earth.AND THEY WERE HUMAN?They were human.COULD YOU SEE ANY OF THOSE HUMANS RISING IN BEAMS?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"I could only see human beings entering the craft.WHAT WAS THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE PEOPLE EMOTIONALLY, OR THEWORLD? WAS THERE SOMETHING HAPPENING?It seemed to be something happening because I definitely remember seeing the sky verybrilliantly white light, but yet there was some blue mixed in with the light. But thepredominant color was a very intense bright light.WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW, DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OFWHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO MAKE THE SKY SO WHITE?After thinking about it, the light could have been several implications, but with the state ofthe world today, it's a possibility it could have been some kind of nuclear explosions andthey were evacuating, saving, these people off the planet.MEANING THE BEAUTIFUL BEING AND CRAFT WERE LIFTING HUMANS OFFTO SAVE THEM?Yes, that was my feeling.YOU WERE BEING SAVED AS A PART OF THAT?Well, it's interesting. I was trying to look at my part in this. I do remember as viewing thisfrom a viewpoint. I was like observing this event. Yet, I felt like the being at one time waslooking directly at me, but then he was looking through me.WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU?(long pause) I don't quite know for sure. It seems like I was a part of it, but not a part of it.DID ANYTHING MORE HAPPEN BESIDES HIM SAYING, 'WE HAVE COME,' ANDYOUR SEEING PEOPLE GOING UP INTO THE BEAUTIFUL CRAFT?No, after that event happened, the next thing I know is that I'm coming back down thatvertical fast elevator effect back to my body. I remember waking up and I was drenched insweat and my heart was pounding. Needless to say, I didn't sleep the rest of the night.What's weird is that I could see the clock again and it said 10:10. That means that wholetrip up and down wherever I went took only five minutes. June 1974 - Beam of Light in BedroomNOTHING MORE HAPPENED IN 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973. BUT WHEN YOU GET TO1974, WHAT HAPPENED?In 1974 in the middle of the summer I'm going to guess probably in June. I know there waslightning bugs out and I remember in this particular night it was a very hot night so all thewindows in the mobile home open. Our air conditioning was not working at that time.My wife had gone to bed and I had the television on and I was watching a program and Igot the feeling to go outside, which I had done numerous times before when I thought therewas an extraterrestrial craft about in the sky. So I turned off the TV and I went to the frontdoor and opened it and peeked outside. I'm looking in the sky I would have been lookingsouth and about 45 degrees off the horizon and I see a luminous object moving very slowlyin the sky. Then it stopped. At that time, I watched it for a few seconds and then closed thedoor and went back to bed.I'm stretched out on the bed and I hear my wife say, 'There's a craft above the trailer andthere's a being inside.' I look up and she's sitting up in bed next to me. By the way, she'snever had an experience like this before in her life. This was a first for her. But she saidthere was a being inside the craft and she described the being as kind of a bluish tunic anddark blue eyes. She described his long, golden shoulder-length hair and described some ofhis facial features a very full face and emanating a look of understanding and love. He washolding a device, or rather gripping a device in both hands, and it was aimed down throughthe bottom of the craft. She said it reminded her of a jackhammer, but it had holes on theside and a lot of really brilliant light was coming or flowing through the circular holes onthe side of this device."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Artistic rendering of his wife's vision of blond being operating equipment insidea craft that she sensed was directly above their house in June 1974. Illustration 2004 by Jim Oglesby.There was a beam of light coming down through the bottom of the craft and she told methat the being said I was going to feel this beam of light and that it would going to workover a specific area in my body.Artistic rendering of a healing energy beam coming down from the craft's technologyinto Jim Oglesby's solar plexus, as his wife sits as if tranquilized. Illustration © 2004 by Jim Oglesby.At the time, I had some what I thought of as blockage in my emotional body, for want of abetter description. So as a beam of light flowed over my body, I just felt very, very warm,very soothing, very freeing inside of my being and even brought me to tears.BECAUSE WHY?Something that the beam affected inside my emotional body, that it freed something upinside of me it's hard to explain. As the months went by, I realized that I had a healinginside my emotional body I guess, similar to if you go to a psychologist and you go throughsome therapy training. You work through an emotional blockage. But it was aninstantaneous flow from that beam that affected loosening up that blockage.ANYMORE TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION?Interestingly enough, when she (wife Laura) was describing to me, her tone of voice, herwords were very slow and very measured words. When that beam was finished, the beingasked me through her: 'Is there anything else you would like to know?' And I said, 'Whenwill they be back?' And he said, 'When you are ready.' Of course, that was 1974.WE'RE AT 2004. IN THE 30 YEARS SINCE HAVE YOU EVER HAD ANY DREAMSOR OTHER INTERACTIONS WITH THESE BEAUTIFUL BLOND BEINGS?I have had since 1974, I have had one more interaction with what I believe was a being in1976. By this time, I had moved from where I was living out in the country into Orlando.WHAT HAPPENED?On this particular night, I was watching television and my wife was in the bedroom. She"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"comes out of the bedroom and hits the switch on the television, turns it off. She has neverdone that before. She said, 'Let's go outside.' So, once again, they were working throughher and we went outside and sat on the front lawn and there I could see a luminous craftmoving very slowly and it stopped. I feel a pulse of energy emanating from the craft thatcame down and it just kind of enveloped both of us. We were looking at each other and itwas a very intimate loving feeling of understanding.WHY DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE HAD NO OTHER CONTACT FOR THIRTYYEARS?I think in terms of these beings and their relationship with time is very different than ourrelationship with time. If I think of the time from 1974 to 2004, thirty years, in our timethat's a lot of time. But the way they measure time, the way time works for them, thatcould just be a matter of weeks or months, or less.WHAT DO YOU THINK THESE BEAUTIFUL BLOND BEINGS WANT?I read that George Adamski in the 1950s also talked about blond beings who told him thatmen of Earth are in bondage to habits which have so bound them that their intuitivespiritual self has been chained to these habits and controlled by them. He said if humanbeings can somehow find a way to break these habits and open up their intuitive side oflife, then the blond beings will help them. And I took that to heart. I'm going to have to domy part to meet them sort of half way. I'm looking at the habits in my life that are keepingme from open, intuitive relationships.SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED THE BLONDS ARE TIME TRAVELERS FROMEARTH OR SOMEWHERE ELSE. WHAT DO YOU THINK?The blonds might be more like time or dimensional travelers.We humans have thecapability as spiritual beings to inhabit or to operate in those other frequencies and timelines that the blonds are operating in.NOT IN THESE BODIES, BUT IN OUR SOUL/SPIRIT?Yes, in a higher octave of matter.THAT THEY ARE COMMINGLING THROUGH SPIRIT, MIND AND SOUL ASOPPOSED TO WHAT WE THINK OF AS BODY TO BODY AND MATTER TOMATTER?Yes. I have a choice. In my own experiences, I have a choice about whether or not I wantto open myself up to have this rapport with them or not. It's strictly my choices every day.Those choices either work me in their direction, or work me away from them.\"More Information:See An Alien Harvest and Glimpses of Other Realities, Volumes I and II at EarthfilesShop.Website:http://www.majesticdocuments.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
