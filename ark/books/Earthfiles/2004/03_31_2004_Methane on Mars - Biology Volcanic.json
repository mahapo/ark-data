Â© 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe Methane (CH4) is a colorless, odorless gas that is themain ingredient of natural gas used for fuel. Methaneon Earth is produced by animals, bacteria anddecaying organic matter which give off so much thatmethane is the primary greenhouse gas in our planet'satmosphere. Methane detected by the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer (PFS)on the Mars Express spacecraft in orbit around Mars. ESA 2001 Illustration by Medialab.March 31, 2004 Darmstadt, Germany - The amount of methane in the Martianatmosphere is estimated to be 10.5 parts per billion, which amounts to 33,000 tons ofmethane. Methane would be expected to survive as a gas in the Martian atmosphere forabout 300 to 350 years before broken down into water and carbon dioxide by the UVradiation from the sun. On Earth, methane is a by-product of biological activity and so thisdiscovery implies the methane source might also be biological on Mars. If there is currently33,000 tons of methane in the Martian atmosphere, that means 100 tons per year wereproduced over the 300 to 350 years. That is 300 kilograms per day and implies there is oneor more sources able to produce these amounts of methane for a long period of time.The methane data is being analyzed by Physicist Vittorio Formisano, Ph.D., PrincipalInvestigator of the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer (PFS) which is mounted on ESA's MarsExpress Orbiter to detect methane. Dr. Formisano is based at the Institute of Physics andInterplanetary Science in Rome, Italy. But given the exciting discovery of methane in theMartian atmosphere, Dr. Formisano is now in Darmstadt, Germany, gathering more datafrom the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer in hopes that he will be able to find one or moresources of the methane by the end of April. I talked with him today in Darmstadt aboutpossible methane sources, including biological life and volcanoes.ESA released today one of its satellite images of the Claritas Fossae, an ancient tectonicregion on Mars west of Solis Planum southeast of the large Tharsis volcano group."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" This Mars Express image shows Claritas Fossae, an ancient tectonic region on Mars,west of Solis Planum, a tectonic and volcanic area southeast of theTharsis volcano group.

In doing so,we measure all the components of the Martian atmosphere and soil. This is done with veryrefined spectral resolution which is unprecedented and never done before. This allows us todetect very small features in the atmosphere such as the methane gas.METHANE HAS ALWAYS BEEN LINKED ON THE EARTH TO FERMENTATIONPROCESSES IN LIFE. COULD YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS DISCOVERY OFMETHANE ON MARS MIGHT MEAN?On Mars, there certainly are no cows or fermentation in the normal sense that we intend onEarth. But methane on Mars could have two, or maybe even three possible origins.1) One is in-falling comets, small comets or meteorites bringing some organic or somemethane itself directly into the atmosphere. But this is unlikely.There are two other possible sources that are more likely:2) One is underground methane in other words, methane that was brought to the planetwhen the planet was formed which slowly comes out through either directly volcanicactivity or through some other volcanic activity such as hydrothermal activity. These wouldeventually last for quite a long time. On Earth, you have this phenomenon going on inmany, many places. So, some sort of volcanic activity could generate methane, could putmethane in the Martian atmosphere.3) Another possibility is obviously is some biological activity that is bacteria which can use"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"hydrogen and CO2 from the atmosphere to produce methane. How to Differentiate Between Biological or Volcanic Sourceof Methane Gas in Martian Atmosphere?I don't have evidence that favors one or the other hypothesis at the moment. But I can doresearch and that is what I am doing to exclude and favor one of the two. For example, ifthe answer is volcanic activity, there should be other gases like SO2 or maybe water vaporincreasing.If it is from biological origin, I should study more what these bacteria could do if theyproduce other gases also maybe ammonia or something like that. Then I will search forthese other minor gases. I am studying to see if there is some homogeneous distributionover the planet or if it is not homogeneous. So, some time in the future, I should be ablefirst to locate some source and possibly say something about the source itself.THE DISTRIBUTION, AS I UNDERSTAND IT, IS ABOUT 10 or 10.5 PARTS PERBILLION. DOES THAT GIVE YOU ANY INSIGHT BEYOND IT BEING SMALL INTHE MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE? OR IS THAT MORE THAN YOU EXPECTED?10.5 parts per billion of methane amounts to 33,000 tons of methane in the atmosphere. So,that should be the result of integration over say 300 to 350 years, which means 100 tonsper year produced, which means 300 kilograms per day. So, one has to find a source whichis able to produce these amounts of methane.Now, a priori, the methane should be distributed equally everywhere. But the fact is, I amstudying the distribution of methane which is not uniform. I will be able to confirm thesethings in the future.IF IT IS NOT DISTRIBUTED EQUALLY THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE, THATMIGHT HELP YOU FIND A SOURCE OR SOURCES?Oh, yes. The location or region where the source is located. Then if it is spot-pointing, itshould be easy. But I doubt it will be spot-pointing. For me, it is difficult to identify at leaston the basis of the data that I have already if it is spot-pointing. I imagine that in the future,I should be able to locate and vector the source and with an instrument aboard the MarsExpress, we should be able to clarify what sort of origin behind the methane. NASA Goddard Also Studying Methane in Martian AtmosphereDR. MICHAEL MUMMA AT NASA GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER INMARYLAND WAS INTERVIEWED IN THE MARCH 27TH INDEPENDENTNEWSPAPER IN ENGLAND AND HE IS QUOTED AS SAYING ABOUT WHETHERTHE CONTINUAL PRODUCTION OF METHANE IS STRONG EVIDENCE OF ABIOLOGICAL ORIGIN OF THE GAS, 'I THINK IT IS, MYSELF PERSONALLY.'I WONDERED WHAT YOUR REACTION WOULD BE TO DR. MUMMA'SCOMMENT?I guess he has his own reasons to say that. Personally I prefer in this moment not to commitmyself in any direction because to state there is life on another planet is a big statement.Obviously that has enormous interest. Before stating that, I want to be extremely suremyself. So, for the moment, I am not stating that. I have no reason in this moment to favorone origin or another.DR. MUMMA WENT ON TO SAY, 'IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THATPRIMORDIAL METHANE FROM GEOLOGICAL ACTIVITY WOULD CONTINUEOUT-GASSING OVER 4 BILLION YEARS (AGE OF MARS.)'THE POINT WAS MADE THAT METHANE IS DESTROYED BY THE UV RADIATIONFROM THE SUN ON MARS BECAUSE METHANE HAS A RELATIVELYSHORT-LIVED PHOTOCHEMICAL LIFE AND THE LENGTH OF TIME FOR ITSPERSISTENCE IN THE ATMOSPHERE WOULD BE ONLY ABOUT 300 YEARS. SO,IF IT HAD BEEN PRESENT FROM THE BEGINNING OF MARS, IT SHOULD BEGONE. I BELIEVE THAT IS WHAT IS SUPPORTING THE COMMENT BY DR.MUMMA.I completely agree with that, but again I am not ready to make other statements."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Comet Wild-2.Methane from Comets and Meteorites - Not Likely?IF THERE WAS THIS LARGE AMOUNT OF METHANE IN THE ATMOSPHERE OFMARS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME, IT WOULD HAVE TO SOME HOW BEGENERATED CONSISTENTLY, WHICH WOULD CONTRADICT THE HYPOTHESISOF COMETS OR METEORITES?Yes, I agree. There must be a (sustaining) source, that is for sure, and unless it is a sporadicappearance of methane, which I don't believe, there must be a source lasting in time for avery long time. So, it's a very interesting problem and very challenging and I hope we willbe able to give an answer to this problem.IF IT IS BIOLOGICAL LIFE, HOW WILL YOU AND THE EUROPEAN SPACEAGENCY MAKE THAT ANNOUNCEMENT?The ESA has already announced that methane has been discovered and there will beanother press release at the European Geophysical Union Conference in Nice, France, onApril 26 (through the week). I hope to be able to say something, yes. ESA Ground-Penetrating Radar Will Search Marsfor Underground Water and IceDO YOU THINK THAT THE GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR THAT ESA PLANSTO TURN ON SOME TIME THIS MONTH TO LOOK FOR UNDERGROUND WATEROR ICE SOURCES, WOULD THAT HELP IN THIS ISSUE OF WHETHER THEMETHANE SOURCE COULD BE BIOLOGICAL OR NOT?I don't know, maybe yes. But I think the answer will come before the radar is activatedbecause the radar will be deployed on April 20, but will not be active until early May. Thenit will take two or three weeks it is not just one moment, one day. It will take a few weeksto operate properly.

Gusev is a large crater about 160 kilometers indiameter. Scientistsbelieve that the crater was covered by standing water, maybe in the form of a lake, early in"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the history of Mars.Image by European Space Agency's Mars Express: ESA/DLR/FU Berlin (G. Neukum).THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY RELEASED IN JANUARY A PHOTOGRAPHFROM THE MARS EXPRESS ORBITER LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN INTO THEGUSEV CRATER WHERE SPIRIT LANDED. THERE WAS A LOT OF GREENCOLOR. AT THE TIME, THERE WAS SPECULATION ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OFEVEN ALGAE OR LICHEN GROWING ON MARS.I KNOW THAT NASA THEN CONTRADICTED AND SAID THE GREEN WAS APRODUCT OF SPECIFYING CERTAIN MINERALS IN THE PHOTOGRAPH.That is exactly what ESA and the European scientists have been saying. This is a mineralwhich is formed in the presence of liquid water.IS THERE NOW A GREATER POSSIBILITY THAT SOMETHING LIKE AN ALGAEOR LICHEN COULD BE GROWING ON MARS AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEMETHANE?Not on the surface because the atmospheric pressure is not enough to allow these cells tobe present and alive.THE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE IS TOO THIN?Ye s .SO, FROM OUR UNDERSTANDING OF BOTANY AND BIOLOGICAL LIFE, ACERTAIN PRESSURE AS WE KNOW ON THE EARTH IS NECESSARY FORSOMETHING LIKE A LICHEN OR ALGAE TO GROW?You need certainly the possibility of liquid water to exist and in the Martian atmosphere,the pressure is 6 to 7 millibars and liquid water cannot exist there. So, underground, theremight be bacteria, but not on the surface.SO IS THIS WHY YOU ARE HYPOTHESIZING IF IT IS A BIOLOGICAL SOURCE OFMETHANE, IT WOULD BE UNDERGROUND AND NOT ON THE SURFACE?Ye s .HOW COULD YOU FINALLY CONFIRM IF THE SOURCE IS UNDERGROUND?Once I have located the region where I see in the atmosphere the maximum quantity ofmethane, then one should study the surface with a high resolution camera to see what kindof terrain it is and possibly in the future send there a rover to study not only the surface,but underground.RIGHT NOW WE DON'T KNOW IF THE MERIDIANI PLANUM WHEREOPPORTUNITY IS COULD BE ONE OF THOSE HIGH METHANE SOURCE AREAS?For the moment, I don't know where the peak of methane in the atmosphere. I know that itis varying. There is a variation. I see that, but I am studying where there could be a peak.\"Websites:http://www.esa.int/export/SPECIALS/Mars_Express/http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.htmlhttp://athena.cornell.eduCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
