May 19, 2004 Dahlgren, Virginia - Yesterday a manager of Mexico's officialmeteorological center declared in a Mexico television interview that ball lightning could notexplain the eleven objects videotaped in infrared on March 5, 2004, by the Mexican AirForce crew. Alberto Hernandez Unzon, a manger of the National Meteorological Services,is also a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Mexico National System forCivil Protection and member of the Hurricane Committee of the Worldwide MeteorologicalAssociation. Through the translation work of Santiago Yturria of Monterrey, Mexico, here are excerptsfrom the Mexico television interview. Mr. Unzon said, \"According to the satellite images,the conditions registered in the observatories and the satellite RADAR images, there werestable conditions in the entire Campeche zone. In the specific place of interest in this issue,there were cloud formation and some stratus clouds that are stable conditions for thisseason. There were no rains registered and the cloudiness type was very stable as we cansee in this satellite images and the Air Force video. ...What we had were the type ofcloudiness that does not cause the flash phenomena.

All FLIRvideo images from infrared videotape courtesy Mexico Department of Defense.Further, when Mr. Unzon was asked about the scientist from Universidad NacionalAutonoma de Mexico (UNAM) speculating to the media that the videotape could probablybe explained as ball lightning, he replied: \"They (scientists, including nuclear researcherJulio Herrera Velazquez) have never approached us at any time. If they are talking about ameteorological phenomena at that location, they should have met with us at the NationalMeteorological Services to obtain the meteorological conditions just like your team did aswell as other journalists. (Also) There were no weather balloons sent up in that area. ...Tosay that these lights on the video are ball lighting or electrical sparks is nonsense. I repeat,that day there were no meteorological conditions for flash or ball lightning in the entireCampeche area. The clouds must have been at approximately 7 kilometers (4 miles or21,000 feet) high. What we see are stable stratus cloud formations. (Editor's note: TheMexican Air Force plane's altitude was 11,480 feet.) Mr. Unzon said he had no explanation for the unidentified heat-emitting objects on theinfrared videotape. He also indicated he would request from NASA in the United Statessatellite images of the Campeche region on March 5, 2004, to see if anything more could belearned. At 5:07:05 p.m. local time on March 5, 2004, at least eleven objects,small and large, show up on \"white hot\" polarity of FLIR camera. Media Headlines About Ball Lightning Without Any Proof (See More Informationbelow)After Mexico City TV producer and independent journalist, Jaime Maussan, released theMexico Defense Department's March 5, 2004, infrared videotape of the unidentifiedobjects - with the cooperation and approval of the Secretary of Defense (See: 5/13-14/04Earthfiles) - speculations followed that the objects must have been meteors, balloons, anAmerican stealth aircraft - and a scientist from a university in Mexico immediately toldreporters that the explanation was probably ball lightning. Press headlines around the worldran with that as the answer to the previous reports about the baffled Mexican Secretary ofDefense and the mysterious infrared images. Did anyone in the media have proof of balllightning? No."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Even the Mexican nuclear researcher, Julio Herrera Velazquez, admitted to reporters:\"There is very little documentation and scientific proof of ball lightning.\" And in fact, asearch of ball lightning literature will show there is no physics agreement about the natureof ball lightning let alone proof that it can persist over at least eleven minutes at 11,480 footaltitude, divide itself from one to eleven objects, move at more than 200 miles per hourfrom 37 miles away to as close as 2 miles to the plane and do it all completely invisible tothe eyes and minds of the eight pilots aboard the Mexican Air Force plane while the sunwas shining.I talked about the Mexican scientists' ball lightning explanation on May 17, 2004, withphysicist Bruce Maccabee who has worked for the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC)in Dahlgren, Virginia, for thirty-two years. Bruce right now is working with infraredfrequencies in the development of Homeland Security technologies. He has also talked withengineers at the FLIR Corporation in Portland, Oregon, who make the infrared camerasystem that was mounted in the Mexican Air Force plane. FLIR engineers told Bruce andme that they have studied the Mexican infrared image and don't know what the infraredobjects are. Here now is physicist Bruce Maccabee explaining why ball lightningspeculation does not match the known facts.Interview:Bruce S. Maccabee, Ph.D., Research Physicist, Naval Surface Warfare Center(NSWC), Dahlgren, Virginia: \"I am looking at the CNN internet 'Science and Space'headline: 'Weather May Explain Mexico UFO Stir.' And the story refers to nuclear scienceresearcher, Julio Herrera (Velazquez), who said the blobs of light may have been nothingmore than ball lightning. Glowing spheres are often little understood, but have been sightednear the ground during thunderstorms. He said, just as you have lightning between cloudsand the ground, you can also have it between the clouds. Sometimes ball lightning candevelop. I feel this is one of those rare events. It is a very rare atmospheric phenomenonand it would be very interesting to be able to analyze all the information these pilots haveobtained.\" This is Mr. Herrera talking.Of course he is correct in saying it would be very interesting from the pilots and also fromthe radar and from the infrared system. It's best to have all that information before we tryto propose too many explanations!TODAY JAIME MAUSSAN CALLED ME AND SAID THEY HAD CHECKED WITHMETEOROLOGISTS AND IN THE STATE OF CAMPECHE ON THE DAY OF THISEVENT, THERE WERE NO THUNDERSTORMS IN THE AREA.That makes it hard to justify the presence of electrostatic or electromagnetic phenomenalike ball lightning. This is known as explaining one unknown with another unknown, whichgives you a lot of flexibility. And you just pointed out that one problem with the balllightning hypothesis is that there weren't any thunderstorms around. But even before that, itcertainly appears these unidentified objects were traveling along with the airplane and thatwould imply they were moving at a considerable speed - like a couple hundred miles perhour.It was even suggested there might be some electrostatic interaction between the plane andball lightning, such as planes drawing them along behind it, or something. I would say thatis highly, highly, highly unlikely considering these (heat-emitting objects and Mexican AirForce airplane) were at least two (to thirty-seven) miles apart. That would take somethingon the order of electricity in a cloud to produce a lightning bolt in order to cause asufficient electrostatic interaction.AND WE HAVE TESTIMONY FROM THE EIGHT PILOTS JAIME INTERVIEWED ATLEAST THREE IN SOME DETAIL AND THEY SAID IN THE FIRST RADAR WHERETHEY SAW MOTION THAT THE OBJECT THAT WAS MOVING WAS 37 MILESFROM THE MEXICAN AIR FORCE PLANE AT THE TIME OF THE FIRST RADARCONTACT."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Right. I suspect that this guy (Herrera Velaquez) is advancing a theory not with the intent ofsaying that is absolutely the answer but the press needs to have something to say. Theyhate to leave question marks, or whatever. So they will be happy to grab on to balllightning. I guess even the press can see through the balloon hypothesis and the pressdoesn't buy the meteors, I guess, and the press doesn't accept the idea that it is some TopSecret American military aircraft of some sort. So that leaves them with the ball lightninghypothesis being the fourth one. There is a fifth which is that it's a hoax. But apparently noone is buying that either. Would Ball Lightning Be Invisible?I can imagine that if ball lightning were to occur in the day time and were not strong balllightning, it might be possible that you couldn't see it because there was too much otherlight around. It's not enough contrast between the ball lightning if it is a cool plasma, 600 to700 degrees Centigrade so it is just barely radiating in the visible spectrum, but isn'tradiating considerably in the infrared. Maybe you would not be able to see the balllightning.But you know, any scientist who wants to put this over as ball lightning has to have a goodtheory. The scientific method would be as follows and this applies to any explanation: Youmake up a model, effectively a theoretical model of what the explanation is. If it's balllightning, then you need a theoretical model of the ball lightning. Then you makepredictions as to how that would show up. For example, on an infrared system. How wouldit show up on radar? What would its characteristics be in terms of motion and duration andall sorts of stuff.In this situation as far as I can tell at the present time, these objects were traveling alongwith the aircraft at about 200 mph. So a major that's something that is hard to be wrong.That's what I mean by a major detail. Something that is difficult to be in error.You can look at the infrared read out and look at the azimuth values I was mentioningearlier that a considerable amount of time was spent with the azimuth at 130 degrees. If theplane is traveling 3.3 miles per minute and over that period of time, the azimuth does notchange then the objects must be traveling right along with the airplane.The point is that any ball lightning theorist has to come up with some way to convincinglyexplain how these things could be moving at that speed. If they can come up with that, thenfine. But the thing about this ball lightning stuff though is that I notice it's the same storyfrom this guy Herrera his proposal over and over again. It's not like some new scientists arecoming along and saying, 'Oh, that guy is right.' It seems to be what the press is picking upon is just one person's suggestion. Could Infrared Objects Have Been American Stealth Craft?WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE PEOPLE SENDING AROUND ALLEGEDLYPHOTOGRAPHS OF SOME KIND OF STEALTH TECHNOLOGY THAT THE UNITEDSTATES HAS MADE WITH SOMEWHAT TRIANGULAR CONFIGURATION OFLIGHTS AND THEY ARE SAYING THAT IS WHAT WAS UP THERE IN THE SKY?That would mean there were at least two triangular objects and probably more becausethere were several groupings of three that were up there. They (pilots) should have beenable to see something, is what it amounts to. There aren't any transparent aircraft as far as Iknow.BECAUSE IT WAS AROUND A LITTLE BIT BEFORE 5 O'CLOCK IN THEAFTERNOON..."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"And the sun was probably 20 degrees above the horizon behind them, something like that.SO FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AS A PHYSICIST LONG TIME WORKING FOR THENAVY, IF YOU HAVE EVEN A STEALTH AIRCRAFT IN AFTERNOON LIGHT ANDTHE SUN IS UP, THERE IS STILL NO KNOWN WAY TO MAKE THAT CRAFTINVISIBLE TO THE HUMAN EYE?Not that I know of. Even if they had such a thing, I don't think they would be flying it overMexico just for the heck of it. I think the plane was flying, at least during the time theywere using the FLIR system, the plane was flying almost due east, according to the latitudeand longitude read outs and doing about 200 mph on average. These things were sort ofnorthwest of them, you might say to the left of them and farther than 90 degrees back. Theunidentified objects were -130 degrees, which is behind and to the left (of the Mexican AirForce plane).That's after they had been doing the FLIR. When they were heading towards the objects,just by radar, I'm not absolutely sure what direction they were going at that point. The mostrecent testimony of the pilots seems to suggest that they originally headed towards theobject and then they made a considerable change in direction after this thing firstdisappeared. As they headed towards it, there was this one object initially that they pickedup on radar. When they got within a couple of miles, the object took off. Then they turnedto go somewhere I don't know exactly where but the point is, when they were headedtoward it, if there was one single object, they should have seen something as they wereapproaching.That's one of the reasons why the crew was so startled as to what was happening. Theycould see these things on radar and the FLIR system, but they could not actually seeanything visibly. I don't know anything that can have a sizable radar cross section probablyseveral square meters worth, which is equivalent to saying it's a sphere a couple of metersin diameter. With a sizable radar cross-section and be radiating infrared radiation and yetnot be able to see anything not have any radiation in the visible, not have any reflection inthe visible reflecting sunlight, not being opaque to block the background. Multiplying Objects, Rapid Movement and Change of Direction On Radar andInfraredOVER AT LEAST ELEVEN MINUTES - THE RUNNING TIME OF THE ACTUALINFRARED IMAGES - THERE WAS A CHANGE IN THE OBJECT FROM ONE TOTWO UP TO ELEVEN OBJECTS.Yes, these are lights of which at least six were quite bright. And some others that weren'tquite as bright. And you can see them moving with respect to the clouds. You can see thenearby clouds moving more rapidly past the airplane than the distant clouds appear to.That's a standard parallax effect when you are traveling along in a vehicle of any sort.Things that are close to you move backwards faster than the things that are far away. Whatthis does is give you a sort of 3-dimensional feeling to the video with the nearby cloudsgoing by more rapidly than the distant clouds, and these objects go on the far side of someclouds and on the near side of some other clouds. So you have the impression that they aresome fixed distance away and not at infinity and they aren't ten feet from the airplane.They are some distance away. They seem to maintain once you get the grouping of elevenobjects or so they seem to maintain almost like a formation.When that first object was detected according to the pilots' story they approached it andthen it took off. And also, the more recent pilot testimony suggested they were able to seeon radar the speed of this object, of the one object they were tracking. They saw it speedup, slow down and change direction in very strange ways independently of what theairplane itself was doing. So there are more details that we have to dig out and confirm andwe have to put together a history of the event before we are able to understand or approach"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"determining what sort of physical characteristics these things had. No Radiometer on Mexico Air Force FLIR SystemWHAT I'VE LEARNED IS THAT THE FLIR SYSTEM THAT WAS IN THE MEXICANAIR FORCE AIRPLANE DID NOT HAVE A RADIOMETER WHICH IS NECESSARYTO TELL THE TEMPERATURE OF ANY OBJECT EMITTING HEAT THAT SHOWSUP ON AN INFRARED IMAGE.The radiometer aspect could tell you the temperature of an object or how much heat it wasemitting quantitatively. From the FLIR imagery, you get it qualitatively in the sense if itwere very cold, it would be very dim. If it were very hot, it would be very bright. But youcan't say from the FLIR imagery how many degrees it is because of automatic gain controlsand other software processing of the data to make it look good on the screen.But it was definitely over-saturating when those two things were side-by-side. And I guessabout two miles away at that point that was definitely over-saturated.THAT'S SUGGESTING THAT WHATEVER WAS OUT THERE TWO MILES WASEMITTING A LOT OF HEAT ENERGY.That's what I don't know how sensitive the system was. The fact that there was glare in theimagery, a sort of halo around the bright objects, means there was a lot of radiationimpinging on the imaging system coming right through the lens. I hope we can use that factto make an estimate of just how much radiation was hitting the lens (since no definitiveradiometer readings.) Calculating Size of the Invisible, Heat-Emitting ObjectsDO YOU THINK THERE IS ENOUGH INFORMATION ON THE INFRAREDVIDEOTAPE TO EVER KNOW WHAT THE SIZES OF THESE OBJECTS WERE?We can set bounds to it. It wasn't any bigger than the image itself the circular images that'sfor sure. It's more likely smaller because image size tends to grow with the amount of lightor amount of radiation being emitted. So, it could be a teeny weeny thing emitting a hugeamount of radiation. It could be the same size of the image emitting much less, or not asmuch radiation. Or it could be somewhere in between, which is most likely.DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA RIGHT NOW?A few feet in diameter. If you imagined it to be a sphere and we don't know what the shapeis. It's being covered up by the blobbiness of the infrared image. But if you imagine it to bea sphere, the size of the image itself corresponds to about 6 to 7 feet, something like that.It's not a large number of feet in size. If it were two miles away when you had the twobright ones side-by-side, they were about 16 feet apart, as I recall and 6 to 7 feet indiameter would be the maximum size. It can't be any bigger than the size of the image.THAT WOULD IMMEDIATELY CONTRADICT THE IDEA OF A STEALTHAIRCRAFT, WOULDN'T IT?That's the point. A stealth aircraft even if you had a glint. Suppose you had a stealth aircraftwith a mirror on it reflecting sunlight, or you had a stealth aircraft with a hot enginegenerating radiation. In either case, the aircraft would be much larger than the size of thespot that is creating this bright image so you should be able to see something. Even if youcan't if they made a stealth aircraft that for some reason was non-reflective of sunlight, itwould maybe look like a black hole. It would still be visible because it would be blockingthe light coming from beyond it. You would see it silhouetted against the background. Andthey (pilots) did not see anything."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"So, we're talking about something we just don't know about here.\"More Information:Historical Information About Ball LightningMost ball lightning reports are associated directly with thunderstorms, a weather conditionnot present on March 5, 2004, around 5 p.m. local time over Ciudad del Carmen in theState of Campeche, Mexico, when the Mexican Air Force pilots saw the unidentified aerialobjects on radar and infrared. The few ball lightning accounts on record describe a smalldiameter phenomenon that lasts only seconds, not several minutes.In a 1980 paper in Naturwissenschafter, Vol. 67, pages 332-337, written by physicistStanley Singer, Ph.D., he said: \"The theoretical problem is that of accounting for a sphericalstructure which maintains its identity while moving freely in the air for some seconds andfor a radiation process which continues over the same length of time.\"Photograph taken by eyew itness of round glowing head a few inches in diameter, trai ling rayssometimes reported as a characteristic of ball lightning.
