Or is it evidence of biology? That's the question which we all want toanswer.\" - Michael J. Mumma, NASA Astrophysicist September 21, 2004 Greenbelt, Maryland - NASA scientists began searching formethane on Mars in 1989. By 2002, the NASA infrared facility in Hawaii with its highresolution spectroscopy began to detect methane. In 2003, the Mars Odyssey's neutron andgamma-ray sensors had tracked seasonal changes of carbon dioxide \"dry ice\" and waterice. As the dry ice dissipated with the seasonal changes in temperatures, water ice wasconfirmed to be 90% by volume in some places in the Northern Hemisphere. June 2003 report from NASA's Odyssey spacecraft. Blue indicates water ice observed by Odyssey during thenorthernwinter months when carbon dioxide covers the surface. Water ice was measured up to 90% by volumein some places. Computer images by NASA/ JPL/ GSFC/ IKI. Now NASA has confirmed multiple lines of water vapor and methane at the same time andin the same spectra. Further, NASA scientists have produced a map for the abundance ofwater and methane on Mars derived from its pole to pole latitude and longitude data. The NASA map of water and methane overlapping on Mars is being produced by aGoddard team headed by Michael J. Mumma, Ph.D., Chief Scientist of Planetary andAstrophysical Sciences in the Laboratory for Extraterrestrial Physics at NASA/GoddardSpace Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Their paper about Martian water and methanewill be submitted to Science in the next few weeks for publication. (Detailed maps arewithheld until publication in Science later this year.) On Monday this week, physicist Vittorio Formisano presented his own paper at theInternational Mars Conference on Ischia Island, Italy entitled, \"PFS Observation ofMethane Formaldehyde and HF: Extant Life On Mars?\" (See: 09-20-04Earthfiles.) Dr.Formisano says he found methane and water vapor concentrating together in three Martianequatorial regions which he said were similar to NASA's Odyssey discoveries of methaneand water vapor together at the same time. After talking with Dr. Formisano, who says healso has evidence of formaldehyde in the Martian atmosphere, I asked Dr. Mumma iforganic molecules such as formaldehyde are mixed in with the water and methane overlapregions, could that mean there might be some organic life beneath the Martian surface thatis causing the organic gas release? Interview:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Michael Mumma, Ph.D., Chief Scientist, Planetary and Astrophysical Sciences,Laboratory for Extraterrestrial Physics, NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center,Greenbelt, Maryland: \"It is, of course, one of the possibilities that we wish to investigatemost thoroughly. The first possibility is that there are forms of life below the permafrostregion on Mars which are reducing carbon and releasing methane in the process, andprobably several other organic gases as well.Another possibility is that it is an abiotic process that it does not involve actual life itself. Itcould be a signature of a geothermal process. For example, on Earth, we know when waterand carbon dioxide organics are carried under the subduction zone of the Pacific plate offthe coast of South America, there is oxidation of iron at great depths. Temperatures downthere are high and cause the water molecules to be broken up. The hydrogen thencombines with carbon and produces methane (CH4) that does not require the presence oflife.So, the real issue: Is the overlap of methane and water on Mars evidence of geothermalactivity on Mars? Or is it evidence of biology? That's the question which we all want toanswer.AND IF YOU ADD INTO THE MIX OF POSSIBLE ATMOSPHERIC MOLECULESTHE PRESENCE OF FORMALDEHYDE DOES THAT INCREASE THE LIKELIHOODTHAT THERE COULD BE SOME KIND OF LIFE FORM PRODUCING ORGANICMOLECULES UNDERGROUND ON MARS?It's difficult to answer at this time. Certainly, it's encouraging because one step toward theproduction of methane is to take carbon and add successive hydrogen atoms. If it'soriginally in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), strip off an oxygen, add two hydrogen andyou have formaldehyde. Add another hydrogen and you get methanol, a form of alcohol.Add another hydrogen and you get methane itself.What we might be seeing if methane and formaldehyde are together is a signature of thatchemical process. Or perhaps not. We need a whole suite of molecules to be measuredbefore we could really confirm whether we are really seeing the signature of biology - oronly the signature of geothermal processes. Has NASA Confirmed Formaldehydein Martian Atmosphere?HAVE YOU AT NASA INDEPENDENTLY FROM THE PSF OF DR. FORMISANOCONFIRMED THE PRESENCE OF FORMALDEHYDE IN THE MARTIANAT M O S P H E R E ?We have not confirmed the presence of formaldehyde on Mars, largely because we havenot spent much time searching for it. There are other workers who have claimed thepresence of formaldehyde from time to time. But these have not generally been acceptedby the scientific community. So, if Dr. Formisano has a firm detection of formaldehyde,this probably would be the very first one that would be accepted by the scientificcommunity.DR. VLADIMIR KRESNOPOLSKY USED TO BE IN YOUR GROUP USINGGROUND-BASED TELESCOPES TO SEARCH FOR METHANE ON MARS. HAS HEBEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM ANY OTHER MOLECULES SUCH ASFORMALDEHYDE OR BENZENE?No, he has not confirmed any other hydrocarbon species. Dr. Krasnopolsky now is a seniorresearch professor at Catholic University in Washington, D. C. He was formerly associatedwith my group and he was at one time at the Institute for Space Research in Moscowbefore the break up of the Soviet Union. He is quite a distinguished atmospheric scientist.His contribution was that he stimulated the search for methane with an instrument at theCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope an instrument called a Fourier Transform Spectrometer.He has since then most recently been analyzing that data to attempt to extract a detection or at least an upper limit for methane on Mars from those spectra.HOW DOES EARTH-BASED SEARCHING IN THE MARTIAN ATMOSPHERECOMPARE TO DR. FORMISANO'S PSF INSTRUMENT MOUNTED ON THE MARSEXPRESS ORBITER THAT CURRENTLY ORBITS MARS?The big advantage of the terrestrial-based work that is ground-based observing byKrasnopolsky and also by my group is that we have much higher resolving spectral powerthan the PFS instrument provides. So, PFS is close to Mars, it is in orbit, it has very high"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"spatial resolution which has some advantages, it goes around the planet once every 90minutes. But on the other hand, the resolving power of the ground-based instruments (onEarth) is far higher, so the specificity for individual molecules is much greater. Testing for Underground Organic LifeVersus Inorganic SourcesIsotopic Ratios of Carbon 13 to Carbon 12IF A COMBINATION OF THE GROUND-BASED OBSERVATIONS ON EARTH, PLUSTHE PSF ON THE EXPRESS ORBITER ON MARS, SHOULD SHOW THAT THEREARE FORMALDEHYDE MOLECULES, WOULD THAT HAVE AN IMPACT ONYOUR OWN THINKING ABOUT THE INCREASED POSSIBILITY THAT THERECOULD BE SOME KIND OF ORGANIC LIFE UNDERGROUND ON MARS?It might. What it would really do is demonstrate that there are various short-lived species(of molecules) present that require some kind of active carbon chemistry. And the way youactually test for sub-surface life versus a non-biological production mechanism is to lookfirst at the chemical abundance ratios methane, formaldehyde, methyl alcohol, ethane, andother hydrocarbons and also by looking at the isotopic signatures. For example, on Earth,all life forms have a slightly different ratio of heavy carbon to light carbon, which isCarbon 13 to Carbon 12, compared with abiotic forms.There is just about a 3% difference in the mixing ratio of the isotopes. So if a similarprocess occurs on Mars, we would expect that we could determine the difference betweenbiology and abiotic production by looking at the isotopic ratios. This is in fact was a keyobjective of the ill-fated Beagle Landers which the British scientific community placed onthe Mars Express spacecraft, but which unfortunately failed.HOW SOON COULD YOU INVESTIGATE ISOTOPIC RATIOS?There are two ways of doing them. One is from space observations. My group hasproposed placing a high resolution observatory in space to make very high resolutioninfrared observations of this methane on Mars and many other species (of molecules) aswell. If approved, that would provide data in February of 2010 that is, it would belaunched early that year and by mid 2010, we would begin general scientific operations.On the other hand, considering landers on Mars, if we sent a lander to a particularlypromising site, one might consider sending a Mars surface laboratory there that could bedone by 2009 to 2010 or thereabouts. If it were equipped with some kind of a drill, it couldbegin to sample sub-surface material probably not at the hundreds of meters depth, butcertainly within the first meter of depth from the surface and begin to test questionsregarding other more complex hydrocarbons than the ones we have been discussing whichare signatures of biology. Sure Signs of Life - Chiral Amino AcidsIS THERE ANY MOLECULE THAT WOULD BE DEFINITIVE OF LIFE? IS THEREONE THAT ITS VERY PRESENCE ALONE WOULD SAY THERE HAS TO BESOMETHING METABOLIZING ON MARS?If we were to find amino acids that were what we call 'resinic' or L-type amino acids. Or toput it in simpler terms, if we found chiral amino acids in the soil of Mars, we would becertain that biology was at work.(Editor's Note: Chiral refers to a 3-dimensional form, as a molecule, that cannot besuperimposed on its mirror image. Also, in Primedia's About Chemistry, \"Chiral refers to anatom in a molecule that is bonded to four different chemical species, allowing for opticalisomerism. Example: The central carbon in serine is a chiral carbon. The amino group andhydrogen can rotate about the carbon.)Chiral refers to the 'handedness,' as we call it. At the end of your arms on one side, youhave a right hand and on the other side, a left hand. No matter how you reorient the righthand, you can never make it the same as the left hand. The thumb will be on the wrongside. That's why we call it 'handedness.'Similarly, molecules in Nature some of the amino acids can be put together in such a waythat they are either right handed or left handed in their structure. They have the samenumber of atoms and they are in the same approximate positions. But in one case, the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"molecule is said to be a right handed molecule because it has one functional group on theright side whereas in the other molecule, it has it on the left side.It turns out that life on Earth prefers only one handedness. So, it's generally regarded as asignature of life to find chiral chemical species such as amino acids and sugars that wouldbe used by life itself. For all life on Earth, the amino acids are left handed and the sugarsare right handed. So, it depends upon which chemical species you are talking about.There is an instrument that is supposed to be carried on an upcoming Martian probe thatwill be a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer built by Dr. Paul Mahaffy another scientistat Goddard who specializes in this kind of work. That is an instrument that can measurecomplex organic compounds. But so far, it is not equipped to measure chiral compounds,but Dr. Mahaffy has plans to do that (measure chiral compounds) in the future. Are the Martian Methane and Water VaporReleases Seasonal?We very much want to see how the abundance of methane over the source regions varieswith seasons. As you know, Mars does have seasons. It has a tilt to its axis, just like theEarth. It's called the obliquity. So, there is a change from north to south and winter tosummer seasons on Mars the same as there is on Earth. We would like to know: Is therelease of methane and water dependent upon the surface temperature and its variationsthrough the Martian year? Or is it independent of that? This would give us a clue to thedepth from which the methane is being released.If there is no variation with time of year, we think the methane source region would bedeep below the permafrost. If there is a prompt change as temperature drops, we wouldexpect that perhaps the release region is much closer to the surface. This is veryinteresting. If so, it could be that what we are seeing is the release of methane hydrate -that's like a patch of ice that has methane trapped in it, so if the ice sublimates and escapesas water vapor, the methane would escape with it and could explain why there would be arelease of both (water vapor and methane). But that can only happen if you have a heatwave propagating on the surface to a depth where this ice exists. That would necessarily bevery shallow, just within a few tens of centimeters from the surface of the soil.IF YOU DID NOT SEE A VARIATION WITH SEASONS, WOULD THAT THEN TENDTO SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THERE MIGHT BE A CONSTANTGENERATION OF METHANE DEEP BELOW THE SURFACE OF MARS BYSOMETHING?Yes, exactly.WHAT?Yes, of course. If there were no variation with seasons, we would think that the stuff wasbeing generated at a steady rate deep below the surface. At this point, we still would notknow if it's due to biology or not. One has to make additional measurements such as thechemical composition of additional gases that are being released from the same site. Theywould be different in the case of biology compared with abiotic mechanisms.As we mentioned, we would like to measure the isotopic ratio in the released gases toidentify whether they are more consistent with biological release or abiotic means.WHAT WOULD BE THE NEXT TIME YOU COULD EXPLORE THE SEASONALQUESTION?Beginning in February 2005, Mars will be in a favorable position. It has a good Dopplershift velocity relative to Earth. We and other groups will be proposing to win time atground-based telescopes to continue this search and mapping different seasons of theMartian year.SO YOU COULD START DOING IT IN 2005?Oh, we will start doing it in 2005! European Space Agency's Ground-PenetratingRadar on Mars Express Will Look for Underground WaterIce"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"WHEN ESA'S DEEP GROUND PENETRATING RADAR KICKS IN, WHICH MIGHTBE SOME TIME BETWEEN SEPTEMBER AND MARCH, WILL THAT HELPRESOLVE ANY OF THESE ISSUES?Gosh, it should. It can look for sub-surface water ice as our NASA Odyssey has searched.Incidentally, it's actually subsurface Hydrogen (H), not subsurface water (H2O). That's akey point. Odyssey measures subsurface Hydrogen, but it can't really determine what otheratoms are bounded at Hydrogen. It could be oxygen or it could be carbon.That means Mars Odyssey might have found subsurface hydrocarbons, not just water. Butthe discovered Hydrogen has been interpreted to be mainly water ice because thetemperatures are very cold and especially in the polar regions. So, probably most of it iswater ice. But there could be a significant portion that is contributed by sub-surfaceorganics.IF THERE ARE FORMALDEHYDE MOLECULES, THEN MAYBE THERE'S MOREREASON TO LOOK FOR LIFE UNDERGROUND ON MARS?You bet! Absolutely.\" March 2002 NASA report: Huge ice field extends from Martian South Pole to 60 degrees south based on datafrom Mars Odyssey's Gamma Ray Spectrometer. The low intensity of intermediate energy neutrons (blue)is a tell-tale sign of hydrogen. So much frozen water not far below the Martian surface couldprovide a medium for living organisms.
