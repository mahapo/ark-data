Overthe past decade, she has buried bottles of water in crop formations, had seeds analyzed andcollaborated with scientists to study changes in brain and hormonal activity of test subjects.With her 2003 data now summarized, Lucy Pringle described for me some of the measured,but unexplained, biochemical effects.Interview:Lucy Pringle, Photographer, Crop Formation Researcher and Author of 2004 bookCrop Circles, Petersfield, Hampshire, England: \"My area of research is investigating ofelectromagnetic fields on living systems. What happens to you and me and our animalswhen we go into genuine crop circles. To this end, I work with scientists who do variousareas of research one of which is measuring the hormone levels in humans. Always we docontrol samples and then do tests inside and outside certain formations and compare theresults. Last year, we went into a formation that appeared on July 13, 2003, at AveburyTrusloe a circle with scimitars around the edge. There was a 5-pointed star in the middle.Five-fold geometry reported in wheat on July 13, 2003, at Avebury Trusloe,Wiltshire, near the ancient village of Avebury.

The first time I did not feel very wellin the center. The second time I was taking in a group of visitors and I told them that if theydid not feel well in any formation to leave. Well, I got to the center and I was the one whohad to go. I felt violently nauseous and had to leave quickly which kind of proved mypoint. This was the only 2003 formation that I felt was new enough to warrant the scientifictests.So, I decided not to put any people in the center, but to do the tests on the outside aroundit. The woman, Ann Smithells, who was doing the hormone tests, she had never been in aformation before. We had done the control tests in a barn outside at Beckhampton whereDavid Hughes very kindly loaned us his barn. We went in and after a few tests, she said toChristopher Weeks, a researcher, 'I don't think, judging by the results of these hormonelevels, that we should be in this circle at all. I always thought circles were beneficial.'The results were really quite remarkable. There was a dramatic drop in the thyroid levels ineverybody some more dramatic than others. Ann Smithells was explaining to me that whereour adrenals they react very quickly because they are our fight and flight mechanism. Butthe thyroid gland reacts very slowly. In fact, Ann said if she tested someone today, threemonths later she would not expect to find a change in their thyroid levels. In one case, Ithink it was one of my 'guinea pigs,' there was as much as a 40% drop in their thyroid levelin a time space between 2 to 2.5 hours. That was pretty dramatic. The pancreas beta cellssecrete to principally the liver where it stimulates the conversion of glycogen into glucoseand that was increased.Endocrine SystemEndocrine System includes pituitary gland in head,thyroid and parathyroid glands in neck, adrenal glands and pancreas in abdomen.Testes and ovaries are also part of the endocrine system. Graphic © 2004 by BodyTeen.com.DO ANY OF THE MEDICAL PEOPLE HAVE AN EXPLANATION FOR WHY THERESHOULD BE SUCH A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE THYROID?No. This is the interesting thing because we know that the circlemakers are dealing withsubtle energies. I think the general acceptance in the scientific world is that there is anawful lot that we don't understand about subtle energies. This is where there is a lot ofongoing research, especially in Russia, to try and gain a clearer understanding about howsubtle energies affect people. Pineal GlandAlso, in our tests, the melatonin increased. That's located in one's pineal gland.Brain Activity Tests"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Also, Isabel Maxwell-Cade and Peter Staples were doing brain activity tests. They foundquite interesting results, too. There was some alpha blocking. The alpha is really the bridgebetween the conscious and the subconscious. You have the beta, alpha, theta and delta thefour levels of brain activity. The alpha blocking was quite obvious. This was anotherunusual effect.I said afterwards that I felt quite badly that I had put them into that formation, buteverybody said it was a very good test because it has shown before that some formationsare not exactly negative, but the residual energies somehow don't react well with someindividual human energies. But in saying that, I don't mean they are malevolent in any way.It's just the energies don't interact in a way that our metabolism can accept sometimes. Hot Feet in Crop Circles?There was another interesting result that I haven't had before. There were two people withme on a cloudy day and as we were walking toward the formation. One of them said to me,'I have to stop and tell you,' he said, 'I feel absolutely wonderful! I've got the most amazingfeeling of well being. I can't even describe it. It's the most beautiful feeling I've ever had inmy life! But,' he said, 'the soles of my feet are burning hot.'He had had a problem with a strained muscle in his groin and it cleared up straightawayafter that. Then we went into another formation. I always tell people, 'You must never walkagainst the flow of the crop because in a way you are walking against the flow of theenergies.' Well, Dan was so excited that he set off all by himself, he walked against the flowof the crop and the pain in his groin came back.But I got another report from someone who had been in a crop formation on a cloudy daywho had burning on the soles of her feet!WHICH IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH THE IDEA THAT MAYBE THERE IS ARESIDUAL ENERGY FROM WHATEVER THE PLASMA VORTICES ARE THATMIGHT CONTAIN MICROWAVE ENERGY THAT INTERACTS WITH THE PLANTS.Absolutely! This is correct, Linda, because the residual energies are in the soil and theplants. In fact, this is the latent energy which is creating all the affects we are measuring.I was talking with a friend of mine who is a surgeon and she said that subtle energies oftenkick start the hypothalamus. This is important it's part of the fore-brain. It plays a majorpart in regulating the body's temperature, body weight, appetite, sexual behavior and so on.Some people even say it is the physical place of the emotions.She feels that these subtle energies might have in some way kick started this man'shypothalamus and the nerves running down his legs were stimulated because of the injuryin his groin.\" Machines Are Affected by Crop FormationsPage 18, Crop Circles © 2004 by Lucy Pringle: \"Crop circles appear to affect machines aswell as people. Mobile phones that operate normally elsewhere fail inside the cropformation then work perfectly when outside again! Rolls of film in cameras whiz forwardsor backwards; camcorders suddenly stop working; credit cards are wiped clean;wristwatches lose or gain time or the hands spin round! On several occasions, televisioncrews filming formations have experienced technical failures they never encounteredbefore, despite all the back-up precautions that professionals make. Batteries are especiallyvulnerable and tend to drain on entering some formations.\"Within crop circles, 'hot spots' of energy can occur where mechanical failures areparticularly likely. One of the most expensive episodes involved Dr. Roger Taylor, aresearch immunologist, when using electronic equipment to measure changes in bodyvitality inside the 'Druid's Knot' formation at Alton Priors, Wiltshire, in July 2002. Despitethe author's (Lucy Pringle) warning, he placed himself and his equipment in a 'hot spot'where several TV cameras had failed previously. He hoped he would get significant results,and did!"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"South Field near Alton Priors, Wiltshire, in wheat reportedon July 22, 2004. From Crop Circles, aerial photograph © 2002 by Lucy Pringle.\"Because of previous electrical failures, Dr. Taylor was anxious about the safety of hislaptop computer while inside the formation and wanted to monitor a separate battery to seeif any change occurred. To this end, a chartered electrical engineer adapted a hand-heldcomputer to record at 15-second intervals. All was quiet until around 16:20 hours when asignificant voltage spike occurred, lasting approximately six minutes. \"Later, Dr. Taylor's laptop computer was seriously damaged and the implication was that theunexplained voltage spike might have been responsible.Voltage spike graph recorded by Dr. Roger Taylor, immunologist, inside South Fieldcrop formation on July 28, 2002. From Crop Circles, © 2004 by Lucy Pringle.Energy Impact on SeedsThere is another very interesting result - I know I spoke to you about the Ogbourne St.George formation, which was to my mind the pearl of last year's (2003) formations. I tookseeds from that formation and also buried bottles of water. The seeds were sent up to a firmcalled Pelican. They are agriculture analyzers and using near infrared spectroscopy theytest for protein content and moisture content in grain. A lot of people in Australia use thismethod. The higher the protein content, the greater price they can demand from the grainmerchants.Seeds from the Ogbourne St. George formation the results were fascinating. We just didthree. These were tested blind. We did a control sample. We did the center and we did theperimeter.Now, Christopher Weeks and I were both of the opinion or gut feeling that the perimeter really that the major energy was at the perimeter of this formation. What was interestingwas that the protein is created on a dry basis using a factor of nitrogen of 5.7.The control sample protein was 12.05.The center was 17.48.The perimeter was 18.15That is a 50% increase in protein over the control sample.THAT IS BEYOND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT?Yes. When we did it the year before, the scientist said even 10% was beyond the normalrange.DOES JIM LYONS THINK THAT THE IMPLICATION IN THE SEEDS IS THAT THEENERGY INTERACTING WITH CROPS TO MAKE FORMATIONS ISACCELERATING GROWTH OR AFFECTING THE GROWTH OF THE PLANTS?I don't know if he can say that, but we can certainly say that the protein content is higherthan the control samples.IN TERMS OF BIOPHYSICIST W. C. LEVENGOOD'S WORK FINDINGACCELERATED GROWTH IN SEEDS THAT ARE UP TO 45 TO 75% ACCELERATEDGROWTH COMPARED WITH NORMAL PLANTS, WOULD YOU TRY TO PLANT"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"SOME OF THE 2003 AVEBURY TRUSLOE SEEDS AND SEE IF YOU CAN GET THATSAME ACCELERATED GROWTH?I'm sure we would find the same growth because everyone who has tried it has found thisas a consistent result, haven't they?YES. Buried Bottles of WaterI also buried bottles of water which I have been burying in crop formations now for 14years and these are sent up to another laboratory, again in York. Jim Lyons organized allthis for me. For the first time, we are trying to do a more complete chemical analysis, butunfortunately 25 milliliters was not enough. So we weren't able to do the entire spectrum.This year in 2004, I'm going to be burying bottles of 100 milliliters.But in 2003 we were able to do the PH, the electrical conductivity, ammonia bicarbonateand then Jim did the dowsing at the end. What was most extraordinary is that thebicarbonate has gone up. The control sample was 24, the one from the center was 24, butthe one from the perimeter was 110.DOES ANYONE HAVE A HYPOTHESIS ABOUT WHY THE PERIMETER WOULD BEMORE AFFECTED?No, we don't understand. But I have to stress with this that it's the first time we've done thechemical analysis so we don't have a yard stick by which to compare these results withprevious formations. We've got to repeat them. Summer 2004EVERYONE WONDERS IF THE MADNESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST WILL SOMEHOW MANIFEST ITSELF IN CROP FORMATION PATTERNS THIS YEAR?I think there was a deep seated unrest in the crop circle season last year people did notknow why, but they just felt that something strange was going on. I think it was a reflectionof world events what was happening in the Middle East, Iraq and in a way, the people whocould recognize this were very sensitive. They were tapping into a larger picture, sort ofuniversal consciousness that the crop circles were picking up on this the energy or theintelligence behind these formations last year seemed to reflect what was happening in theworld.WHICH IS WHY EVERYONE WONDERS WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE SUMMEROF 2004?I just hope it's going to be a cleansing year for everyone and the whole world.\"Click here for more information about Crop Circles, The Pitkin Guide © 2004 by Lucy Pringle.Websites:http://home.clara.net/lucypringlehttp://www.cropcircleconnector.comhttp://ufo.internauci.plhttp://www.wylatowo.mogilno.plhttp://www.cropcirclenews.com"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"http://thecropcirclewebsite.50megs.comhttp://www.bltresearch.com/http://www.cropcircleresearch.comhttp://www.bertjanssen.nlhttp://www.cccrn.ca/http://www.dcca.nlhttp://www.invisiblecircle.dehttp://www.wylatowo.mogilno.pl/news.php?art=94http://www.temporarytemples.co.ukhttp://www.swirlednews.comhttp://www.heramagazine.nethttp://members.iinet.net.au/~bwratten/ccc.htmlhttp://www.CropCircleAnswers.comhttp://www.busty-taylor.com/cropper/98busty2.htmCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
