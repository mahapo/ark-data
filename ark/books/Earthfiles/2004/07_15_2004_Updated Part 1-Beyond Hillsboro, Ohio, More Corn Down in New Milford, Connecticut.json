Photograph © 2004 by David W. Harple, The New-Times. New Milford is about twenty miles west of Waterbury, Connecticut. July 15, 2004 New Milford, Connecticut - Yesterday, Kamilla Gary reported in TheNews-Times of Danbury and New Milford, Connecticut, about \"Mystery of the maize: NewMilford woman's corn crop flattened overnight. Mid-garden damage defies explanation, sonsays.\" Today I talked with Kamilla and the corn crop's owner, Martha Bailey, who has lived at herNew Milford home for three years. There is a 7-foot wire fence built around her garden oftomatoes, squash, yellow and white corn. The squash was about three feet high and thecorn plants were nearly six feet high. But on Tuesday morning at 6 a.m., she had sat downto have coffee and was shocked when she looked out the window. Interview:Martha Bailey, Small Business Owner and Gardener, New Milford, Connecticut: \"Ilooked out 'Where is my corn?!' I see one row standing on the left side by a fence and somestanding on the right side about 30 feet away and there is nothing in the middle. However,there is some on the back fence. I have a 7-foot fence all around my garden and this onerectangular section from the north to the south is just flattened as flat as a floor."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Martha Bailey and her 7-year-old granddaughter, Shannon Bailey, lift up some of the corn flattenedsome time in the night of July 12 to 13, 2004. Photograph © 2004 by David W. Harple, The New-Times.LAID ALL ONE WAY?Exactly, and all laid to the south. There was no wind. We did have rain the night before(July 12, 2004), but it was not a severe pounding rainstorm.SO THE GROUND WAS SOFT AND YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEETRACKS, RIGHT?Ye s .COULD YOU FIND ANY?There was nothing there. There were no holes amid the cornstalks. There were no burnmarks on the corn stalks. My garden is secured by gates and a fence. And nothing novandalism, no children around my neighborhood. I have 3.5 acres. I have two very niceneighbors. That's it.It didn't hurt my tomato plants. I have 20 tomato plants. It didn't hurt my squash. It justtook out this small section of corn, like six rows 40 feet in length by 30 feet wide.DID THE POLICE OR SHERIFF COME OUT?Oh, no. I had no reason to call them.SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT WAS VANDALISM.It's absolutely not in this neighborhood. I live on a country road and there are no smallchildren in the area, no vandalism.I have a 4-foot wood pile in front of my garden with a green tarp on it. There are two greentarps and where the tarps meet each other, in the middle where the corn went down, thetarps were kind of turned upwards toward the south. So if the corn laid down from thenorth to the south, whatever did it had a force that separated the two pieces of tarp that areover my wood pile, which were before very flat.Four foot high stacked firewood covered with green plastic tarp that was \"turned upwards toward the south\"on Tuesday morning, July 13, as if it had been raised somehow. It had been flat.Photograph © 2004 by David W. Harple, The New-Times.AS YOU'VE HAD A CHANCE TO THINK ABOUT THIS SINCE TUESDAY, HASANYTHING STRUCK YOU AS HOW THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"No, because my daughter-in-law talked to Dr. Mel Goldstein on Channel 8 news in NewHaven, Connecticut and he said there was absolutely no wind that night and we didn't hearany wind. We did have rain, but it was not heavy torrential downpours.But the ironic thing about it is that the corn on the left side of the fence is still standing andthen there is a row of corn on the north side that's still standing. And some on the east sidethat is still standing. So something had to come like straight down and toward the south toknock these 7 or 8 rows of corn down.MOVING NORTH TO SOUTH.Ye s .WHAT IS BEYOND YOUR PROPERTY TO THE NORTH?Trees and woods.NO HOUSES?No. All standing trees.DO YOU KNOW IF THERE IS ANY HISTORY OR MYTHOLOGY ABOUT YOURPROPERTY OR YOUR AREA LINKED TO ANCIENT BURIAL MOUNDS?Yes, there is. On Route 7 which is not far from here about a mile away, the Indians werehere years ago. They just built a new New Milford High School and they found a lot ofartifacts.LIKE ARROWHEADS?Yes. We're trying to clear 3.5 acres and we've done a lot of digging and haven't found asingle arrowhead or anything related to an Indian village. But Fort Hill Road, very close tome, and I think that's where the Indians were. There's a lot of water around here not pondsor lakes, but like water runoff and we have a lot of limestone on my property and I have abig galvanized water tank to the right of my garden where I get the drainage off my littlegarage which is on the east side of my property and it stops the wind from blowing west toeast. My garage is there and my water tank and I water my garden with that. In the west,we have woods. And the wood pile is in the south and I have a 7-foot fence around thegarden.THERE WAS NO BREAK IN THAT FENCE?No, absolutely not.WITH ALL THAT LIMESTONE, DO YOU HAVE A LOT OF UNDERGROUNDWAT E R ?I believe so. When I bought this house in 1999, we bought it from Sunny Valley NaturePreserve and when we dug the new well, it was just pure limestone coming up when theywere drilling.ISN'T IT UNUSUAL WITH ALL THE OTHER PLANTS IN YOUR GARDEN THATONLY YOUR CORN WAS AFFECTED?Very unusual, because there was absolutely no wind. My squash plants are three foot high,zucchini and yellow squash, and not one usually when the wind blows, they kind of flopover. There was nothing. But the corn on the left and the corn on the right and the corn onthe north did not blow down.

Historic Perspective August 30, 1992 - Austinberg, Ohio - Corn September 2, 1992, Star Beacon, Ashtabula, Ohio.Excerpt from Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I: Facts & Eyewitnesses © 1994 by LindaMoulton Howe: Austinburg, Ohio Corn Rectangle On August 30, in Austinburg, Ohio, a large rectangle was found in a young, sweetcorn garden planted by Donald A. Wheeler. The rectangle measured 8-by-25-feetand Mr. Wheeler told me: \"In all my gardening years, I have never seen anything likeit before.\" Carl Feather, reporting for the Ashtabula, Ohio Star Beacon wrote: \"It just appearedas if something came down out of the sky, pushed the stalks flat on the ground andleft without leaving any other trace in the soft ground.\" When I telephoned him, hesaid local farmers thought the soil was simply too wet and the corn fell down. ButFeather, who took photographs, said all the corn stalks were lying generally in onedirection, not randomly as might be expected if moisture were responsible. \"None ofthe stalks were broken and none of the ears were taken,\" Donald Wheeler said. Atfirst, he suspected deer, but when he checked his field for tracks, he could not findany. Then he thought that maybe a freak storm had hit. But the corn stalks were nottwisted, and nothing else nearby showed any signs of storm damage. The crop was young because it was located near Lake Erie where the water canmoderate temperatures, allowing a longer growing season for second plantings.Connie Sistek, an investigator in Ashtabula, talked with biophysicist W. C.Levengood about the odd corn formation. He asked her to gather plant and earsamples on September 2 and October 5, 1992, both from inside the downed rectangleand outside for controls, so he could have different growth stages."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" The corn tassels on control plants outside the rectangle were tightly closed. Butinside the downed rectangle, the tassels were opened up. \"These differences in tasselgrowth,\" said Levengood, \"suggest that the formation plants developed at a morerapid rate than the controls. Generally, tassel opening is very closely timed in a fieldof corn. Under normal conditions, one does not see the differences in tasselformation that were observed in this Ohio case.\" Corn tassel on right has accelerated development, taken from rectangle formation found August 30,1992,Austinburg, Ohio. On left is normal control corn tassel from outside rectangle whichis still closed. Photograph © 1992 by W. C. Levengood.Levengood found other differences. \"All the ears from the formation plants appeareda darker brown color and the pericarp on the tiny kernels had a roughenedappearance and were smaller in size compared with the controls. The seed weightwithin the formation ears was only 1/6th the seed weight in the controls. This seedweight difference was surprising in view of the fact that the ear sizes were the sameas those in the controls.\" Another important difference was that none of theformation corn seeds would germinate. \"Several aspects of the findings from thissample set indicate that at the time of the crop formation, a suppression of theembryo growth occurred - a developmental perturbation which did not appear to becarried over into the somatic tissue.\" \"There was also abnormal ear development between a September 2 sample and anear picked October 5. Both ears were the same size and stage of development onSeptember 2. The bulbous growth at the upper end of the ear picked four weeks lateron October 5, 1992, contained much larger, more completely formed kernelsindicative of normal development after the earlier retarded growth associated withwhatever energy affected the plants at the end of August 1992.\" Corn growth at the apex of an ear became more normal four weeks after apparentsuppression of embryo growth by unknown energy source that flattened rectangle of corn inAustinburg, Ohio, on August 30, 1992.
