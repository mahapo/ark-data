S.B. Prusiner) Berlin:Springer-Verlag, © 1996. February 19, 2004 San Francisco, California - \"Mad cow\" disease oncethought to be confined to England has spread to other countries the past fewyears, including most recently herds in Canada and Washington State. And thisweek came another disturbing discovery: Italian researchers have found a secondtype of deadly prion disease in cattle that closely resembles the prion proteinsthat sporadically and spontaneously attack and kill humans in what is calledCreutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, or CJD. That means controlling what goes into cattlefeed won't stop all mad cow disease - and that there are even more deadly prionsin the food chain than anyone knew until now.Both mad cow in animals and CJD in humans cause shaking, stumbling andsevere mental deterioration before inevitable death. There is no cure. Ironicallyand tragically, the cause of these diseases are proteins that are normally found inevery living animal and human, but can mysteriously change shape and destroy"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"brains and nervous systems.Until the Italian discovery, it was assumed that mad cow, also known as bovinespongiform encephalopathy (BSE), was spread from infected cow tissues andbones that were recycled into cattle feed. But even after strict measures weretaken in England and other countries to kill sick animals and eliminate infectedcattle feed, mad cow disease has still been reported.Medical experts are convinced that people who eat meat products contaminatedwith the deadly mad cow proteins can contract a variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, known as \"vCJD.\" Now the Italian scientists have found a prion verysimilar to vCJD in cows.This week I talked with prion expert and Professor of Neurology, GiuseppeLegname, Ph.D., who works in the laboratory of Dr. Stanley B. Prusiner, Nobellaureate (Nobel Prize in Physiology & Medicine 1997), who discovered andnamed the shape-changing, deadly protein prions. The laboratory is at theUniversity of California-San Francisco. I asked Dr. Legname about theimplications of the Italian discovery that sporadic and spontaneous prions caninfect cattle as they do in human CJD.Interview:Giuseppe Legname, Ph.D., Adjunct Associate Professor of Neurology,University of California-San Francisco, San Francisco, California: \"Wewere only aware of one so-called strain of 'mad cow' disease and this originatedin England and then spread out in Europe and other parts of the world and mostrecently one case was actually identified here in the United States (WashingtonState in December 2003). What this new research has found is that there is anadditional strain out there which has different characteristics than the one wewere aware of and the different characteristics are resembling what a sporadicform of the human disease are.BSE was thought to be infectious, caused by infectious prions, which cowswould contract by eating tainted food. What this new research is pointing out iseven if cows are organically grown, they might still contract the (prion) diseasesporadically, like humans.THIS NEW DISCOVERY BY THE ITALIAN SCIENTISTS OF THE SECONDFORM OF MAD COW DISEASE THAT SO CLOSELY RESEMBLES THEHUMAN CREUTZFELT-JAKOB DISEASE THAT MEANS THAT THELIKELIHOOD OF MORE PRION CONTAMINATION IN CATTLE - ANDPOTENTIALLY HUMANS - INCREASES?Absolutely. You are absolutely correct. Dr. Legname and His Family Are Avoiding MeatAS AN EXPERT, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THIS, WHAT MAKES YOUNERVOUS?What makes me nervous is I have children and I used to consume meat,especially beef meat. But now I'm looking at different sources of proteins, suchas fish, chicken and things like that. This is a problem and I would probably paya little price on top of what we already pay for our meat to be reassured thatwhat I'm buying, and ultimately consume, is safe. That's the point here. That willallow us to understand more this disease, to study it in more detail, and thencome up with alternative ways of managing this problem.But definitely the first thing would be to reassure the consumers including meand you that the beef that you buy at the supermarket or eat at the restaurant, it'ssafe."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"United States Is Not Screening All Cattle for Mad CowDiseaseWHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT IN THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW,THERE REALLY IS NO GUARANTEE AS LONG AS WE ARE ONLY DOINGA LITTLE SPOT CHECKING?Exactly. And here in the United States, the screening on cows is very small. Lastyear it was around 20,000 cows/year. If we compare that number with howmany cows are slaughtered every year in the U. S. the number is close to 35MILLION cows! You can understand that there is a huge discrepancy betweenthe screening and the actual amount of cows processed.In comparison, we have countries like Japan where they screen every single cowthat will go into the human food supply. And in Europe, where older cows arescreened meaning 30 months or older is mandatory. So, we have already asystem in place in other countries where they are addressing this problem.To answer your question, unless we know and we confine the problem byscreening and understanding how many cows are affected by this disease outthere, we will not know exactly what the impact will be for human health. Human Symptoms of CJD The microscopic images of CJD, taken from gray matter areas, reveal the absence ofinflammationwhich is characteristic, a range of spongiform (sponge-like holes) changes, neuronal loss,astrocytosis and typical amyloid plaques. Images courtesy State University of New York.WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS IF A HUMAN GETS THE CJD PRIONDISEASE?The late stages basically are lack of sleep, lack of coordination in themovements, forgetful. People don't remember exactly what they are doing, whattheir name is, or who people even close to them are. Ultimately, it would bedifficult for them to be independent like eating on their own or grooming ontheir own. Eventually, they will be complete demented status and ultimatelydeath. Could Alzheimer's Be A Prion Disease?HOW DOES THAT DIFFER FROM ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE?That's a very, very good question. In the early stages of CJD, it's quite difficult todistinguish if it is actually Alzheimer's disease or CJD. So far, we have not beenvery successful in identifying a way of discriminating these two diseases. Thereare similarities between these two diseases and common signs to these twodiseases.The thing that differentiates the CJD from Alzheimer's disease is that CJD is"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"unfortunately a faster disease. As soon as you diagnose it, then within 12months the patient would die from the disease because it is invariably fatal.Alzheimer's has a course that will take a few years before the patient willultimately not be able to sustain the disease any longer.IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ALZHEIMER'S COULD HAVE A PRION SOURCEJUST LIKE CJD AND WE HAVEN'T UNDERSTOOD THAT?Well, all these diseases that we collectively call neuro-degenerative diseaseshave something in common like Parkinson's, Huntington's and others, includingAlzheimer's and CJD. It's a protein problem a protein that is in the brain eitherloses the function or the shape it is supposed to have and ultimately leads topathological changes in the brain. So, there are similarities among these diseases.In a way you are right they could all be some kind of prion disease.AND COULD IT BE THAT ALL OF THEM LEAD BACK TO THE MEATTHAT HAS BEEN EATEN IN A PERSON'S LIFE?I wouldn't say that. We know the link is pretty clear with the prion protein andthe prion disease. But I wouldn't extend that with the other neuro-degenerativediseases. So far, there is no clear link to that.BUT YOU AND YOUR OWN FAMILY ARE MOVING AWAY FROM MEATBECAUSE YOU ARE A PRION RESEARCHER AND YOU ARE WORRIEDABOUT IT.Exactly.\" Can Deadly Prions Spread Through Dairy Products and DogBiscuits?When it comes to worries about how people become infected with CreutzfeldtJacob disease, a lot of people have asked me: Can I get prion disease fromdrinking milk or eating cheese? And so I asked Dr. Legname:Giuseppe Legname: \"That's an excellent question because people think, ofcourse. So far, again, there is no link between dairy products and prion diseases.Others have done some research on that and there is no evidence that this is thecase.WHAT ABOUT THE CALCIUM IN DOG BISCUITS OR CHICKEN FEED?ONE DREAMLAND LISTENER E-MAILED:\"My job this week was to deliver dicalcium phosphate to a dog biscuitcompany. The dicalcium phosphate came from cow bones. Do you know ifthat process removes all the prions? Or do you know if that is the primarysource of dicalcium phosphate that also gets used in human goods? Theguy who loaded the truck said under his breath that some times the stuffgets fed to cows, and quite often it is used as chicken feed and for otherfarm animals.\"Dicalcium Phosphate made from cow bonesis used in toothpaste, food and animal feed."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"IS THE DEADLY PRION PROTEIN DESTROYED IN COW BONEPROCESSING TO MAKE DICALCIUM PHOSPHATE?The processing of the (cow) bones that will lead eventually to dicalciumphosphate we need to understand how they (manufacturers) do it. Because thesource is bones from cows, there is still a chance that probably prions might nothave been inactivated.If some of this is tainted with prions, then the likelihood of having animals andalso humans contract the disease is higher because again, prions are a veryresistant infectious agent and the more we have of these infectious agents in ourfood supply or even the animals that live close to us, the higher the chances wecould be infected. Prions Are Difficult to DestroyWHAT KILLS PRIONS?There are ways of killing prions and extreme PH (bleaches) and naturant agents(guanademium hydrochloride and high concentrations of urea) are combinedtogether will be successful in destroying prions.WHEN YOU SAY 'EXTREME PH'?When I say 'extreme PH,' I'm talking about things like Clorox or sodiumhydroxide. Chemicals that are at either extreme of the PH scale from alkaline toacidic.IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU ARE SAYING BLEACH CAN KILL PRIONS?Yes, correct. The bleach is extreme PH and that will kill prions.BUT HOW COULD YOU PUT BLEACH IN DICALCIUM PHOSPHATE TOMAKE...Exactly! (laughs)YOU CAN'T DO IT, RIGHT?You can't do it. That's the problem because we have here in the lab a procedurethat we follow in order to make sure that any material that is being used in thelab and goes outside the laboratory is completely and surely inactivated. That'sone thing.Whether or not we can use the same procedure for food or the food supply, well that's not very practical because you wouldn't put bleach on your steak in orderto make sure you don't have prions. The research is ongoing on othercompounds that could be used as inactivation for prions. So far, this is as muchas we have achieved.LET'S SAY HIGH HEAT DOESN'T DO IT EITHER?No. Radiation, high heat, or vapor normal procedures that would kill a virus orkill bacteria doesn't work with prions.BUT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT OUTSIDE OF A LABORATORY,THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE WAY OF GETTING RID OF PRIONS IN THEFOOD SUPPLY OF ANIMALS OR HUMANS?Correct.THAT'S VERY SOBERING.I know! But that is why we call for a wide scale screening of meat that comesfrom cows here in this country because unless you reassure that the originating"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"material is not contaminated, it would be quite difficult to understand andestimate how much of these what is the size of (the prion) problem in thiscountry?Prevention is the best way. Knowledge of the food supply that is NOTcontaminated with prions would assure that the consumer is in a safer position.\" Deadly Proteins Are Found in Muscles of Human CJDPatientsDr. Giuseppe Legname said that recently a Creutzfeldt Jacob patient died andwhen researchers examined the patient's muscle tissue, there were \"detectableamounts of prions\" not only in the brain and spinal cord, but in the skeletalmuscles.That reinforces the fact that deadly prions have also been found in mad-cow-infected animal muscles which is the meat that humans eat. That is why Dr.Legname feels strongly that every animal going into the world's human foodchain should be tested for prion disease.We b s it e s :http://www.thedoctorsdoctor.com/diseases/prions.htmhttp://www.mad-cow.org/http://www.path.sunysb.edu/faculty/woz/NPERESS/webclass2p2.htmCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
