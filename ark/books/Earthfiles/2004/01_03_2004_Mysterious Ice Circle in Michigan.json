As he walked through his dining room and looked outthe back windows, he could see \"the most incredibly brilliant light.\"Interview:Vaughn Hobe, Lapidary, Horton, Michigan: \"My first thought was someonewas back on the hill. My second thought was, 'Who would be out on that hilllike a night like tonight?' It was like 15 degrees Fahrenheit and we had 40 mphwinds blowing. It was cold!But it was such a brilliant white light! It was captivating. But it only illuminateda narrow area, about two inches wide at arm's length over the hill about 900 to1000 feet out. But it was enough to see that eight or ten trees being lit upbetween me and it.SO IT REALLY WAS A NARROW FOCUS WHATEVER THIS BEAM WAS?Yes, it was a very narrow focus. It was the most intense, brilliant white light. I"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"couldn't discern if the trees were being lit from in front by a light on top of thehill, or silhouetted from the back by a light behind the hill. The light had nocolor. It never wavered. I watched it for about twenty minutes, from 1:30 untilten minutes to 2 a.m. ET.IN THE 20 MINUTES THAT YOU WATCHED THE BRILLIANT LIGHT, DIDIT HAVE A SHAPE? DID IT MOVE?It never moved and I could discern no shape. It was actually hard to look at atthe top of the hill, it was so bright.IF YOU WERE COMPARING IT TO ANYTHING ELSE YOU HAVE SEEN,WHAT WOULD IT BE?On a rainy night, I have seen some of the new super white headlights thatbrilliant, dazzling light with the glow you get on a wet night versus a dry night.But it had no shading of blue or shading of yellow. It was just pure white.AT AN ARM'S LENGTH DISTANCE, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUTWHAT SIZE?About two inches across.IF IT WERE TWO INCHES ACROSS, HOW HIGH WOULD IT HAVE BEEN?WHAT KIND OF SHAPE ARE YOU LOOKING AT?This is what I'm still working out in my mind here. But I would say that the lightI could see was about three-quarters as high as it was long, so it might have been1 1/4 inches by 2 inches, like a bar there.LIKE A HORIZONTAL BAR.Right.AND THE LIGHT THAT IT WAS CASTING DOWN AT AN ARM'S LENGTHDISTANCE, YOU THOUGHT WAS ABOUT TWO INCHES. AND YET EVENTHEN, AS BRIGHT AS IT WAS HURTING YOUR EYES, IT ONLY LIGHTEDUP A FEW TREES?Right. It was like jet black to either side of it, it was so bright.IN THOSE TWENTY MINUTES, IT DIDN'T MOVE. HOW DID ITDISAPPEAR?I don't know. I went to bed. I convinced myself it was the moon setting over thehill, because it was about that size as you would see a moon set on the horizon. Discovery of Ice Circle DelayedBecause Mud Lake Covered by SnowWHEN DID YOU MAKE THE POSSIBLE LINK THAT THERE MIGHT BESOMETHING OVER THERE?I didn't make the link until we saw the circle on December 28, 2003. Butstarting the day after seeing the light, we had several days where weaccumulated snow that had blown across the lake and accumulated at this end.Then at Christmas things started to melt and when we went out on the Sundayafter Christmas (December 28, 2003). There in the snow it looked like someonehad come down with a snowmobile and done a perfect circle and decided 'Theice isn't safe,' and left. So to us it just looked like a 6-foot-wide or so jet blackcircle melted down into the snow.AT THAT POINT WHEN YOU FIRST SAW IT, WAS IT LIKE A RING?Like a ring."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"NOT A SOLID CIRCLE?Right, not a solid circle. It was melted down through the snow. So you hadsnow in the middle and snow all around it. And then you had this dark ring thatwas melted down all the way to the surface of the lake. And a halo going aroundthe outside ring, as if the snow had melted differently than if it had meltedelsewhere.DID THE THOUGHT GO THROUGH YOUR HEAD AT THAT POINT ABOUTTHAT STRANGE WHITE LIGHT YOU HAD SEEN ON THE NIGHT OFDECEMBER 18?Yes, immediately, because it was directly in line. And also because it was notthere before. That ring had to have appeared some time before the snow fell onDecember 18 (2003). The InvestigatorsInformation about the ice circle did not reach investigators until New Year's Eve,December 31, 2003. The next day on January 1, 2004, the research team thatwent to Mud Lake included: Jeffrey Wilson; Todd Lemire, Chief FieldInvestigator for the Michigan Mutual UFO Network (MUFON); Dr. CharlesLietzau; Ted Robertson; Roger and Nancy Sugden; and Zach Smith. Theresearchers reported that the full diameter of the whole circular area wasbetween 62 feet (east/west) and 64 feet (north/south). The thin ice circle at thecenter was only about one inch thick and varied from 28 to 32 feet, surroundedby a brighter and thicker (4-5 inches) white \"splash pattern\" which laid another4 to 15 feet around the central circle. Further out was what the men called the\"exterior edge\" that varied between 4 and 13 feet wide.Thicker \"splash pattern\" surrounds thinner center circle.Photograph © 2004 by Ted Robertson.Given Vaughn Hobe's report of the strange light above the hill and Mud Lake, Iasked Jeffrey if it were possible that something fell down into the lake andcreated the lighter splash pattern?Interview:Jeffrey Wilson, Independent Crop Formation Investigator, Master'sDegree in General Science, Dexter, Michigan: \"We considered that. We alsoconsidered that the description of the light beam was such that it was narroweras it got toward the ground and got wider as it went up higher. That might seemto indicate that the source had been at the ground level and as it got higher, thebeam spread out wider. We considered both possibilities as to what the source,the direction the source was coming from. What we're struggling with is that thewater is only two or three inches deep before you start hitting the sedimentunderneath. And there is no sediment that is frozen in the splash pattern above,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"on top of the ice. It's just completely clear water. There is no sedimentation thatis mixed in with the ice that has been splashed out from underneath downbelow. It's not very deep water. That's what we're struggling with at this point.IF SOMETHING HAD HIT IN THAT SHALLOW WATER AND SPLASHEDMUD, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN IT INTHAT SPLASH PATTERN.But it's not there.YES, AND IF IT'S NOT THERE, WHAT IS CAUSING THE DISCOLORATIONOF THE SPLASH PATTERN?What we're thinking of is that if it had been open water, because the wind wasblowing, it could have splashed the water the top layer of water out on to thetop of the ice. You wouldn't necessarily see sedimentation going along with it.BUT STILL THE MECHANICS OF HOW IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE INTHAT SNOWSTORM EVEN WITH CLEAR WATER IN THE CENTER ISPUZZLING.It is very puzzling. That's what we're sort of brainstorming, trying to figure outwhat are the possibilities that could even come close to what we are seeing.\" Estimated Size of Light Compared to Ice Circle DiameterJeffrey Wilson contacted Dr. Brandon Brygadier to calculate the size of the lightand they concluded: \"Mr. Hobe said he measured the width of the column asbeing two inches at arm's length. I paced out the distance from the window hewatched from to the crest of the hill which was 900 feet. It was another 300 feetto the circle for a total of 1200 feet\" from where Vaughn Hobe watched thelight.\"Two inches is .16 feet. We used three feet for arms length. Here is the equation:.16ft/3ft = x/1200 feet. To solve for x, the width of the beam at the crest of thehill (Mr. Hobe's horizon) was approximately 64 feet - the same width of thecircle itself! The equation comes out to 64 feet exactly - no fractional amount.\" Mud Lake ice circle near Horton, Michigan, in Liberty Township,investigated on January 1, 2004.

Diagram © 2004 by TedRobertson. Ted Robertson, Robertson Harpsichords and Ice Circle Diagram Maker,Ellettsville, Indiana: \"The 'splash pattern' is like more white ice because I thinkit has air bubbles, like it's been frosted up. And the darker ice is actually clearice because it doesn't have air in it. You can see it's more undisturbed, moreplacid. That looks darker because you can actually see the undergrowth throughthe ice.IF THE WIND WAS RESPONSIBLE IN THE SNOWSTORM FOR MAKINGTHE SPLASH PATTERN, THE QUESTION STILL IS: WHAT MADE THETHINNER CIRCLE IN THE ICE IN A SNOW STORM?It's almost as if it was melted or removed. But the second possibility is that a ringwas cut in the ice where the splash pattern is, allowing the water to froth up andspill over from the central water disc that was cut out like a cookie cutter.We do notice that the center of this ice circle is thinner. In fact, it had justrecently frozen in the last two or three days before we got there because thewater was clear and it was very thin. In fact, the man (Vaughn Hobe) whodiscovered it wanted to mark it with a pole. So we chipped out the center and Ireached my arm in there to see if anything had fallen in there, and it was cold,but I didn't feel anything. We actually took a core sample of mud, but there isjust a lot of roots down there.\"Comments from Vaughn Hobe AboutHis Two Ice Circle Photos BelowVaughn Hobe: \"In the series of pictures on the Mud Lake circle, there isone of a small hole in the ice and the other of a plant sticking up through ahole and the tip of another next to it. The first picture is a close up of onea about twenty holes found about fifty feet north of the halo surroundingthe circle. They are all in an area of ten by twenty feet. The picture of theplant was enclosed to point out a difference other than something stickingup through the hole. NOtice both have a radiating radial pattern. Only theholes in this small area have small dark spots, visible in photo, surroundingthem, those with plants or irregular shaped do not. A drill throwing off icecould account for the spots. I cut out a section with two holes before theice disinegrated. It is in my freezer. Though and impact may explain some aspects of the circle's appearancewith the snow gone, I don't think so. I think something was there thatmelted a ring down to the ice, perhaps into it but not through it, it would"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"have floated off center in the wind. It also melted a halo around it adistance into the scrub as the scrub was from the outer edge of the ring.The center circle was melted at a different rate. Then they melted at thesame rate until the snow was gone. The surface texture was different in allthree sections. From the way the ring and halo seemed to glow in the dark it becomesapparent water was removed from the ice. Have pretty good sized samplein freezer from all sections and controls. Thickness variation still there.\"Close-up of one of about twenty holes found fifty feet north of the halosurrounding the ice circle at Mud Lake.

Only the holes in this small area oftheice circle had small dark spots visible in the photograph.

Reaching in there. And the ice was cracking. We heard audiblesounds of ice cracking where people were clustered, but we didn't fall in.COULD THE SPLASH PATTERN BE SNOW THAT WAS THERE MELTEDAND THEN RE-ICED?Absolutely. In fact, I'm leaning toward splash. It looks sort of like it was builtup. It was snowing at the time. It snowed, then melted, and probably snowedagain and then probably melted. But it's really difficult to say what this was.THEN THERE IS YET THAT THIRD SECTION, IF I UNDERSTANDCORRECTLY, THAT GOES OUT BEYOND THE FIRST MAJOR SPLASHPATTE R N?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Yeah, it's like the whole thing is raised up a little bit it's like a splash patternwithin a splash pattern. I don't know if it was done in sections, but we can't see aclear ring of cut ice because it has re-froze, or maybe it was never there. It's verysubtle and oddly shaped.Outer \"splash pattern\" beyond central thin circle and first \"splash pattern.\"Photograph © 2004 by Todd Lemire, Michigan MUFON.This is only ten feet from a reed bed which is right at the edge of the lake, so(circle) is not right in the middle.

Like it's not randomly put there.Horton, Michigan ice circle (62 x 64 feet diameter) found in Mud Lake coveabout ten feet from reed bed on December 28, 2003. Photograph © 2003 by Vaughn Hobe. A VERY SPECIFIC POSITION IN A MILE WIDE LAKE, AS IF THERE WASA REASON FOR IT TO GO THERE.And it is very close to where lights were spotted in the sky, although from wherethe gentleman pointed, it would have been on the land and this was moretoward the lake. But he was at his house when he saw the light. And we think itwas about 1,000 feet from the lake from his house that night. We actually pacedthe distance.IF YOU WERE MEASURING WITH A RULER THE CIRCLE, CENTERCIRCLE, WHAT DO YOU ESTIMATE ITS THICKNESS IS? AND WHAT DOYOU THINK THE SECOND SPLASH PATTERN THICKNESS IS? ANDWHAT THE THIRD SPLASH PATTERN THICKNESS?Good question. We haven't been able to measure through the ice the farthestdistance, judging by how the ice cracks when you walk on it. Actually, in thecenter of this formation, the ice was only an inch thick. Then, it was two inches"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"and I would say when it hits the splash pattern, it was anywhere from 3 to 4 or 5inches, and then it got thinner with the darker band of ice. I'm not sure howthick that was, but it seems thinner because of the cracking and then it seemedto like taper out to the rest of the pond. But this whole thing seems like a raisedsurface where the center is thin.IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY, I'M SEEING THAT THE CENTERCIRCLE THAT WAS 28 TO 32 FEET IN DIAMETER IS ABOUT ONE INCHTHICK AND THEN YOU GO OUT FOR ANOTHER 4 TO 15 FEET FOR 3 TO5 INCHES THICK. AND THEN BEYOND THAT, IS THE THIRD RAISEDSECTION THAT WOULD BE HOW THICK?Probably about the same, 4-5 inches. We didn't actually pierce through that, butit seemed thicker than the rest of the lake because it was raised up and that'svery odd.DID YOU CORE INTO ANY OF THE ICE BEYOND THE PATTERN TO SEEWHAT THE THICKNESS OF THE ICE IN THE REST OF THE LAKE WAS?Good question. In one part of the lake, even up to yesterday, it was water andthat was maybe a half mile long. So half the lake was not frozen. The onlyreason this was there was because it was on the side of the lake that got coldshaded by trees, more northern exposure. We never cored any of that ice. Wecould see plants sticking up because it is a very shallow lake.WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE REST OF THE LAKE THAT WAS FROZENWAS THINNER OR THICKER THAN THAT ONE INCH CENTER OF THECIRCLE?It was definitely thicker, because we had to tread cautiously when weapproached the center circle. It had been completely water, probably three daysearlier, because the new center frozen was almost crystal clear. That to me,suggests new ice that hasn't been stirred up and probably rapidly frozen ice.\" Jeffrey Wilson, Independent Crop Formation Investigator, Master'sDegree in General Science, Dexter, Michigan:Researcher Jeffrey Wilson checked for radioactivity and magnetic field anomaliesat the center of the Horton, Michigan, ice circle at Mud Lake on January 1, 2004.Photograph © 2004 by Ted Robertson.Other Ice Circles in United States\"Ice circles usually come in two varieties. You'll see a complete whole circlemelted right through the ice, so the whole circle is open water. Or, you'll see aring cut through the ice several inches wide. This one (Horton, Michigan) seemsto be like a third type, one we haven't seen before. The closest to it would havebeen in Whitley County, Indiana, back in 1996-1997, that winter. There were"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"two ice circles on a lake in Whitley County, Indiana.There have been various reports of ice circles in the United States. I want to saymaybe three or four other ones reported in the last ten years. There have beenmaybe six or eight reported in Canada in the last ten years.Also, there was also a ring with a notch in it that showed up in Churchville,Maryland, in 2000.Above and below are photographs of two ice circles on a small pond in the back yard ofMr. and Mrs. Excelex, in the Okanagan Valley half way between Salmon Armand Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada, taken on on November 19 andNovember 21, 2000. Photographs © 2000 by Mr. Excelex.Initially, we thought this Mud Lake ice circle could have been like a meteorimpact or something. But again, there is no plant material or anything that hassplashed up and out. It's only water. So, because the water there is so shallow,we can't see a way if something impacted there with any velocity to create such awide area that has been affected, how that could not have brought up any of thematerial from below. And that's what we're kind of puzzled by. It's not as ifsomething went in there and had a massive impact and picked up a bunch ofstuff and created the circle. That's not the case. There is clearly something thathas removed the ice in a circle and somehow left this water debris field that hasre-frozen outside of creating the splash pattern.AND THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL LINK IS THAT COLUMN OF WHITE LIGHTTHAT WAS SEEN?That's the only evidence at this point that could give us an indication of whatmight actually have transpired.\"More Information:Large Orange Spheres Near Mud LakeOver the past few years, Vaughn Hobe has seen near the same hill and Mud Lake"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"area large, orange glowing spheres at least 25-feet in diameter hovering in thesky. He says the orange is the color of a ripe pumpkin and that he has only seenone sphere at a time, never in groups. The closest approach was once about 200feet.
