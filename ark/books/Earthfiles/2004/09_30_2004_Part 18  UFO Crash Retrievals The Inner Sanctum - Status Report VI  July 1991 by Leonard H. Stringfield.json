It is a likely spoton the globe for UFO surveillance - if technological modernity is a reason.Accordingly, reports abound in that region going back to the early 1950s. Suchinclude landings, close encounters with strange entities and a crash of a saucer nearJohannesburg in 1953 which, to my surprise, was confirmed by a CIA person withwhom I had contact in the late 1970s, especially during the period when I began myprobes into the C/R syndrome. Albeit, thanks to Cynthia Hind, a resident ofZimbabwe, and a veteran MUFON researcher, many well-investigated UFO reportsin South Africa and its contiguous countries, have reached the rest of the world. Then in 1989 came the news of a major crash incident in the Kalahari Desert ofBotswana, near the South African border. It shook the UFO community - first inEurope where it appeared to be a major breakthrough; then it shifted suddenly intothe United States in a mish mosh of reports from diverse sources. Most of it focusedon one informant - James Hendrik Van Greunen. Desperate, and willing to revealover 500 pages of secret documents to support his allegations about his role in theretrieval operation, he stressed the need for a lot of money to escape South Africa.Under surveillance for breaching security, he claimed he had the right connection toelude the authorities before facing trial for treason. Once safe in Europe, he vowedhe would cooperate and share his bonanza of secrets. To say the least, the Kalahari crash soon developed into a complex super drama.Apart from its superstar, Van Greunen, the investigators who played key roles,deserve a hearing. To put the case into some orderly perspective, it is separated intosix parts as follows: 1) ENTER JAMES H. VAN GREUNEN Tony Dodd, a respected British researcher and retired police officer, explains howhe got the first news of the Kalahari crash and retrieval, quoting in part, from QuestInternational (Vol. 9, No. 2, 1989) as follows:Tony Dodd, UK: 'During the first week in July 1989, I received informationfrom a South African source to the effect that a UFO had been shot down by aSouth African fighter aircraft on the 7th of May 1989 and that the object hadcrashed in the central Kalahari Desert. The object had been recovered intact,together with two live alien beings, and taken to a South African Air ForceBase. The South Africans were quickly joined by American Air Forcepersonnel who had flown out from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. A letterfrom my contact read as follows:Tony Dodd's Contact: South African intelligence do not have thefacilities or knowledge to pursue this matter alone. According to thebase commander, it is the third space craft they have retrieved in thepast ten years over the South African continent. We were told to keep"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"everything under wraps as it may cause panic in an orthodox religiouscountry. They told us that they would keep us informed as to anyfurther developments. I hope that this letter reaches you in one piece because if it isintercepted, I will be in a great deal of trouble. Please let me know assoon as you receive it. Unfortunately, we were not allowed to takecameras inside with us for obvious reasons. I am sending you some government copies of the briefing notesseparately. I won't be able to sign my name or address to accompanythese documents in case the letter is intercepted. A couple weeks later, I received a package from South Africa containing aletter and five pages of a briefing document. The document carried the SouthAfrican Air Force Crest at the top of the page and was headed: 'Classified TopSecret - Do Not Divulge' (etc.).\" Stringfield: Dodd was understandably discreet in his first reportorial disclosure ofthe South African crash affair. His source, or sources, were not identified and hedeleted or changed the names of certain sensitive items in the 5-page document. The question remains: who was Dodd's correspondent? Or shall we ask, the bonafide informant? Is he still unknown to research? Or was it James Van Greunen, whowas preparing for his trip to England where he would make further disclosures? Ifsuch were the case, Van Greunen was at first warmly received and became a guest inthe home of Henry Azadehdel. But their relations soon went sour when Henry, thehost, made phone calls to check on the credentials of his guest, James. Suspicion ledto alienation and suddenly, Van Greunen was forced to leave his 'safe house' andmade a hasty return to South Africa. When I was in touch with the Van Greunen in Africa in December 1989, and laterafter his escape to Germany, Henry informed me sometime during that period thatthe real informant was not Van Greunen. When I asked about the whereabouts ofthe real one, I was told that he was safe in South America. Some of the evasive hazethat prevailed at that time has since, thanks to Henry, cleared a little. There is now aglimmer of hope that a crash of 'something' did occur on May 7, 1989, in theKalahari Desert. 2) THE FIVE-PAGE DOCUMENT I have seen several versions of the so-called five-page document with the codenames either deleted or changed. Following is a retyped 'uncensored' copy of theoriginal Top Secret South African Air Force document: Page 1 SOUTH AFRICAN AIR FORCE CLASSIFIED TOP SECRET - DO NOT DIVULGE DEPARTMENT OF SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS AND RESEARCH (DSIR) DEPARTMENT OF AIR FORCE INTELLIGENCE (DAFI) DATE: 7 May 1989 SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object CODE NAME: SILVER DIAMOND FILE NUMBER: 2345-A2-1C DESIGNATION: Valhalla AFB - Pretoria DESIGNATED CHANNEL: RED/TOP SECRET RESTRICTED ACCESS: Illuminated Nine PRIORITY CODE: D-4 SPECTRUM LOT: Blue"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" DEFENSE COMPUTER PASS CODE - PROCEED WITH CAUTION CONTENTS:Case HistoryCraft SpecificationsHumanoid SpecificationsConclusionsPage 2 CLASSIFIED TOP SECRET - DO NOT DIVULGE CASE HISTORY At 13M45 GMT on 7 May 1989, the naval frigate 'SA Tafalberg' radioed CapeTown naval headquarters to report an unidentified flying object that appearedon radar scopes, heading towards the African continent in a North westerlydirection at a calculated speed of 5745 nautical miles per hour. Navalheadquarters acknowledged and confirmed that object was also tracked byairborne radar, military ground radar installations and D. F. MalanInternational Airport at Cape Town. The object entered South African air space at 13M52 GMT. Radio contactwas attempted with object, but all communications to object proved futile.Valhalla Air Force Base was notified and two armed Mirage fighters werescrambled. The object suddenly changed course at great speed which wouldbe impossible for military aircraft to duplicate. At 13M52 GMT squadron leader, Goosen, reported that they had radar andvisual confirmation of the object. The order was given to arm and fire theexperimental aircraft mounted Thor 2 laser cannon at object. This was done. Squadron leader, Goosen, reported that several blinding flashes emanatedfrom the object. The object started wavering whilst still heading in a northerlydirection. At 14M02, it was reported that the object was decreasing altitude ata rate of 3,000 feet per minute. Then at South African border with Botswanaidentified as the Central Kalahari Desert, Squadron leader, Goosen, wasinstructed to circle the area until a retrieval of the object was complete. Ateam of air force intelligence officers, together with medical and technicalstaff, were promptly taken to area of impact for investigations and retrieval. The findings were as follows: 1. A crater of 150 metres in diameter and 12 metres in depth. 2. A silver colored disc shaped object 45 degrees embedded inside of crater. 3. Around object sand and rocks were fused together by the intense heat. 4. An intense magnetic and radioactive environment around object resulted inelectronic failure in air force equipment. 5. It was suggested by team leader that object be moved to a classified airforce base for further investigation and this was done. The terrain of impact was filled with sand and rubble to disguise all evidenceof this event having ever taken place.
