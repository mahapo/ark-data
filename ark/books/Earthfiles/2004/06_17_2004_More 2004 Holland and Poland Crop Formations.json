And theprevious day on Thursday, June 10, we received a report about genuine crop circles nearWijchen, about 20 kilometers below Arnhem, not far from Wageningen.As we entered the school field, it was nice done and in the view from the top of thebuildings, it was a good view of the circles. But when we entered the circle, but it seemedstudents had used a beer barrel to roll a pattern in the field.DID YOU FIND BROKEN STEMS?Yes, they were broken and bent and a lot of mechanical prints in the soil, so it wasobviously manmade. You could see where someone had walked in there and was standingat the center of the standing crop. There was too much and we all decided it was manmade. Wijchen - Wheat Ring with Magnetic Leyline AnomaliesReported June 10, 2004, eighty-five-foot diameter ring around standing wheat dividedinto four sections by two paths that did not cross in the center in Wijchen, Holland.Magnetic leyline anomalies as well. Photograph © 2004 by Robert Boerman.The wheat formation at Wijchen it was a strange one. We have a new field worker whojoined us and he did a good job measuring the ley lines. The Wijchen formation was a ringabout 26 meters (85 feet) in diameter and the flattened ring itself was 6 meters (20 feet)wide, with a standing center. In the standing center, there were two parts crossing each"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"other, but not exactly in the center of the standing crop. The standing center wasapproximately 14 meters (46 feet) in diameter.WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT WAS DIVIDED IN TWO PARTS?There was a horizontal and vertical pathway of 2-meter-wide (6.5 feet) paths, but theydon't cross each other exactly in the center. One of the paths was not a real straight line. Itwas a bit broken.But the weird thing that our new field worker measured in the ley lines, there were aboutsix leylines crossing almost in the center of the standing crop. But there was also a leylinethat came from outside the ring running to the center of the standing crop and then turnedaround and went back out into the field. So, the leyline turned around. We thought, 'How isthis possible?' I have never measured any leyline like that in a crop formation before oranywhere. And that one was running to the center of the ring pattern and returned back tothe field.At the other side of the formation on the north side was also a leyline coming into the circlein the ring and then turned around exactly in the standing crop. We also measured in theflattened crop of the ring, we measured three circles and the inner and outer circle waspulling energy downwards and in the center ring, the energy was going upwards. I don'tknow what that means, but that's very strange.Robert Boerman reports about Wijchen formation: \"Leyline 'A' entered the circle from the south,ran to the center of the circle where it turned 180 degrees to go out of the circle. Leyline 'B' enteredthe circle from the north, ran to the standing crop of the center where it also turned 180 degrees. Anotherleyline'C' w as not a straight line, but undulated across the green rings. The green rings '1' and '3' are rings thathad a downward flowing energy, while line '2' had an upwards energy.Diagram © 2004 by Robert Boerman, PTAH.WERE THERE ANY EXTENDED OR BLOWN NODES, OR MELTED INSECTS?No. But we also used the Bovis scale again in that crop formation. It measured at 5.5million Bovis. Maybe the energy was too much for us because we all three got tired andhad to leave the formation after about an hour. Nothing unusual noticed in light or soundeither.\" PolandTwo crop formations have been reported in a grass meadow in Zamek and Pigza near Torun,northeast of earlier formations in the Moglino region."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Robert K.

But we found strange six holes. They were 30 centimeterswide and ten centimeters deep. Then we found another rye formation about 800 metersfurther. In that area, there was CE2 (aerial light) in the late 1990s which was witnessed bylocal people.\"Pictogram in tall meadow grass reported on June 13, 2004, inZamek, Poland.
