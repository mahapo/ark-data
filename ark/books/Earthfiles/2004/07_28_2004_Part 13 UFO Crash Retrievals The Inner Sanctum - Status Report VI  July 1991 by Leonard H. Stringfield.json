THE KECKSBURG CRASH "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, is about 35 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.Witnesses claim to have seen a metallic acorn-shaped objectwith strange markings in the Kecksburg, Pennsylvania woods on December 9,1965.

Len Stringfield: \"Like Roswell, with its multitudinous witnesses, the Kecksburg, Pennsylvania,crash/retrieval case, 18 years later, is upfront in the eyes of research. Upfront, too,deservedly is Stan Gordon of Greensburg, a MUFON State Director and head of thePennsylvania Association for the Study of the Unexplained, who has conducted alow-key but unrelenting investigation into the history of its events. Starting with thereports of a bright ball of light in flight over Michigan and Lake Erie and its descentand crash into a wooded area near Kecksburg on December 9, 1965, Gordon neverstopped rounding up witnesses. Among the many are those who watched the militaryconvoy haul the craft away into the never-never-land of secrecy. The scope of the crash first drew my attention when researcher, Clark McClelland,formerly with NICAP, informed me of the event on October 5, 1979. On January17, 1980, he sent me a more detailed report which I published in Status Report II.Then came the nemesis: an 'inside' source, known to me as 'Uncle,' revealed that theobject involved in the Kecksburg crash was a spy craft, not a UFO, which Ipublished in Status Report III. But, Gordon continued his independent research,getting new data from new sources. Finally, it gained national attention when NBC'sUnsolved Mysteries featured a re-enactment of the story on September 19, 1990,and later in a rerun on February 27, 1991. From both showings of the film, Gordon got still more sources and, in his continuedspirit of cooperation, kept me informed of his progress. On one occasion, he hadpermitted me to talk firsthand with one of his confidential sources who had managedto get within a few feet of the crashed acorn-shaped object."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Crash site of acorn-shaped object, Kecksburg, Pennsylvania,December 9, 1965.

Before the military retrievers came to take command, ejecting him and others fromthe area, he said that he saw strange hieroglyphs inscribed on one side of the craft.Obviously, not English, I questioned if they might be Russian? My informant, wholater relented and went public on the TV special, was James Romansky whoresponded to my query. He was familiar with Russian and what he had seen was notRussian. Then, bingo, a new break. Gordon, besieged by callers following the TV special,phoned me September 28, 1990, providing the name and phone number of a newsource in Ohio who witnesses a similarly described object, like a bell, atgovernment-held property adjacent to Wright-Patterson AFB. His first name isMyron. After a number of lengthy interviews and getting his testimony on videotape at hishome by a medical friend and research associate, Dr. Brian Thompson. I feelconvinced of Myron's sincerity. A truck driver for his cousin's family-owned shaleand tile/brick business, his go-to-hell straightforwardness which, in its own way,bolstered my belief in his disclosures, was later to be supported by a second witnesswho, in contrast, spoke calmly, measuring every word. Myron, for the record, states that he and his cousin, co-working for a large shale andtile/brick company in Ohio, delivered a large order of special glazed bricks to theWright-Patterson AFB complex in Dayton, Ohio, two or three days following theretrieval of a crashed UFO in Kecksburg. The special order was by the Navy, hesaid, who had sent a representative to the firm to select the brick. Myron explained that verification of the purchase order and signed delivery receiptwere destroyed five years earlier when the firm, owned by his cousin's family, wassold to new interests. Myron also recalls that the search for the special brickoriginally required the Navy to shop at two other firms, in Ohio, who were unable tofill their request. The names of both companies are on file. The purpose of this special brick known as 'double-glazed engineered brick,'according to Myron, was to build a double-thick, lead-lined structure around theretrieved object as a protective shield against dangerous radiation. The location ofthis installation was inside of an existing building, a brick warehouse, which heestimated to be 50 x 80 feet in size, accessible by a narrow blacktop driveway. To itsfront and rear were rows of offices and not far away was a power plant. The delivery of the brick was about 1:30 p.m., at a designated gate where he and hiscousin, in separate flatbed trucks, were greeted by a security guard. Once inside, hesaid, 'A two or three star general' and driver in blue uniforms, who were waiting in ajeep, led them to the brick warehouse area. 'A GI, maybe the driver,' said Myron, 'directed us to our parking spots just a shortdistance from the building. Nearby was an Army 35-foot-long tri-axle lowboy that Ilater learned transported the object. A tarp was still draped over its mid-section.' The only personnel in the immediate area, according to Myron, were four or fivemen 'who were running around like chickens with their heads cut off.' They weredressed in white overalls, wearing visored headgear, rubber gloves and boots. Eachwas armed with a Colt 45 at his side. Commented Myron, 'There were more people"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"inside the building, but they weren't concerned about me or the bricks. They wereconcerned about the object inside the building.' While unloading the brick by hand from the flatbed trailer to pallets, he observedthat the personnel frequently left the building to make a complete change ofprotective gear. During one of their 'breaks,' he was surprised to see that they wereNavy men, not Air Force. One or two wore the typical bell-bottoms and heremembers one wearing his white hat with its brim turned down, probably so that hismask would fit tight. He was close enough to see 'US Navy' insignia somewhere onhis uniform, but admits that he can't recall where. 'But, I know it was US Navy,' saidMyron, adding, 'The whole operation was Navy because I spotted the Navy officerwith all his 'marmalade' (medals, etc.) who selected the brick at our company. Icould see him inside the door talking with other Navy people.' Taking a break from his own laborious job of unloading brick, Myron was inquisitiveand managed to approach undetected the open door of the building and peeredinside. In clear view were the men at work. Two, he recalled, were standing on ametal scaffold which surrounded a strange object. On the floor, leaning against thework platform, was a ladder. Resting on the plank was another ladder, the top ofwhich was at the same level as the top of the object. Unexplainable, said Myron,were the parachute silks suspended from the ceiling which partially enshrouded theobject. Myron, a truck driver, delivered bricks to Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio,right after the famous December 9, 1965, crash of an unidentified object in Kecksburg, Pennsylvania.Myron described a strange bell-shaped object he saw in a USAF garage that was \"entombed\"in brick. Drawing by Charles Hanna © 1998 by Stan Gordon Productions. In a few seconds, Myron said he got to see 'everything.' Under one strong floodlightdirected downward, the object was unmistakably bell-shaped and when pinneddown to estimate its size, he said, 'Give or take, it was at least 10 feet tall and lessthan 10 feet wide.' The metallic skin, he said, was charred or seemed to be coveredby a sooty residue, but its overall appearance was dull copper or bronze.

Sketch by Myron. Although cautioned by his own office not to venture near the work place, Myronadmitted that he could not resist the temptation and asked one of the busy workmanabout his use of an acetylene torch. 'Probably thinking that my presence there meant"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"I had proper clearance,' said Myron, 'the man - who was wearing a visor - told methat he was trying to get inside.' According to Myron, he went on to explain that allattempts had failed, using diamond head drills and acids. Then, according to Myron'srecall: 'I was surprised when he told me that if there were bodies inside, they mightbe too hot for the mortician to handle.' Then, according to Myron, the loud voice of a guard cut in, challenged Myron'spresence and demanded he get back to his job. 'Forget what you've seen,' hebellowed, 'or we'll lock you up and throw away the keys.' Then, in a softer tone, headded, 'You'll know the truth in 20 years.' Although Myron had been consistent in his references to the craft being bell-shaped,I asked him for the record about the object being described to look like an acorn inthe Unsolved Mysteries documentary. He agreed that either description would beappropriate. THE SECOND WITNESS When I first called Myron's cousin, JS, October 3, 1990, for his recollection of theirexperience, he was less informative. While cordial, he was reluctant to get involved,understandably, for family reasons. However, he did confirm that he and Myrondelivered glazed bricks to the Air Base, remembers the 'guards wearing protectiveclothing,' and being a former welder himself who asked one of the technicians with ablow torch, 'What are you cutting?' The reply, he recalls, 'I can't discuss that.' WhenI asked if he had seen the craft in the building, he said, 'I don't remember manydetails on that trip,' and added, 'My partner probably knows more because he wasmore inquisitive.' But the reserved posture of JS changed. When I called Myron again on March 29,1991, to clarify details in relation to the bell-shaped object's size, I was told that hiscousin was now willing to discuss his own observations. I called JS on March 30, and again on April 1, 1991, for additional details. He said,yes, he did see the object the day before he and his cousin went to the Wright-Patterson AFB property together with brick loads. He had made the trip alone withthe first load of bricks and recalls clearly seeing the object shaped like a liberty bellunder its tarp sitting upright aboard the lowboy trailer. Without hesitation, JSestimated the object's size was 8 to 10 feet tall and 8 to 10 feet wide. No, he couldnot recall if the trailer was Army or Air Force. 'I'm the kind of person who minds hisown business,' he said. 'I didn't ask any questions, but it probably arrived a shorttime before I did.' JS went on to say, 'There was activity in the area - men wearing fatigue suits andthere were armed guards. But I didn't see anyone carrying a machine gun. 'Unlikethe next day's trip, there was nothing unusual at the entrance gate. I gave the guardmy identification and showed him my bill of lading and was directed to the area forunloading near the big red brick building.' JS said, 'Being formerly a welder, the next day I recall asking one of the workmenwearing a head shield outside the building, 'What are you cutting?' He said hecouldn't discuss it. that was it for me.' For the record, I asked JS for a more definitive description of the special brick. Hesaid, 'It was a red glazed, moisture-resistant jumbo-sized brick, approximately4-by-12 or more inches.' Still more evidence of the Kecksburg connection came to Myron's attention shortlyafter the event from alert truckers with CB radios who normally monitor traffic onthe highways. Anything unusual is shared. And, so it happened, they spotted thetruck and trailer and its strange cargo - and jeep escort - journey from the Pittsburgharea going west on Route 40 toward Wheeling and then to Lockbourne AFB inColumbus for a brief layover, and then on to Dayton. As Stan Gordon points out, the origin of the Kecksburg UFO has not beendetermined. It might or might not be extraterrestrial, but the facts show that it was astructured craft, resistant to 'our' known high-tech means to get inside.\" Continued in Part 14 - Other \"acorn-shaped\" craft retrievals.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund PolicyCopyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
