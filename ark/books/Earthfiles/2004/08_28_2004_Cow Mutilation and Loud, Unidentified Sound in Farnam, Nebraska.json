August 28, 2004 Farnam, Nebraska - Tuesday night, August 17, 2004, something strangeflew low and loud over the small farming community of Farnam, Nebraska southeast ofNorth Platte. At least a dozen people heard the loud noise. Two days later in the earlyevening of Thursday, August 19th, rancher Larry Jurjens was out checking his head ofabout 100 cattle. Mr. Jurjens and his wife, Joanne, have lived in Farnam on the sameproperty for thirty-five years. One of their healthiest cows, an 11-year-old black Angus,had given birth some time earlier to a calf that had grown to at least 400 pounds. All waswell on their ranch until the night of August 19, when Larry found the cow dead andmutilatedInterview:Larry Jurjens, Rancher (40 years), Farnam, Nebraska: \"I come down this canyon(valley surrounded by hills) and I seen this dead cow. I got to looking further and I lookedat her eyeball and her eyeball was gone. And then I looked at her bag and it was totallyslashed off. I started home and started to think about her tongue and I went back and itwas also severed clear back in her mouth. There wasn't anything left of it.Eleven-year-old healthy cow's left eyeball was removed, along with all the tongueso far down in the throat that rancher Larry Jurjens could not see any remnant. Discovereddead and mutilated in the early evening of Thursday, August 19, 2004. Possible date ofdeath was Tuesday, August 17. Photograph © 2004 by Larry Jurjens.WHAT DID THESE EXCISIONS OR CUTS LOOK LIKE TO YOUR EYE?Well, it was just a clean cut. The tongue I've butchered a lot of cows and I know the tongueis hard to get out especially with their mouth, without cutting their mouth open. I've never"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"seen anything like it in my life.WAS IT CUT IN A VERTICAL CUT DEEP WITHIN THE THROAT?It was back as far as I could see. Her mouth was closed. I pried her mouth open to see if itwas still there and it was gone. This was getting about dark, so it was getting hard to see.WAS THERE ANY BLOOD ANYWHERE AROUND ANY OF THESE CUTS?There was no blood whatsoever no place on this cow. I didn't see any blood that haddrained. Usually a dead cow will have blood around her and there was no bloodwhatsoever. Even on the back end I never said that before it was all open, but the buzzardshad ate her. It was two days and the buzzards had ate her a little bit on the back, but nocoyotes or nothing had touched her any lace else.Large excision in the rectal region of cow, as found by rancher Larry Jurjens in early eveningof Thursday, August 19, 2004.

Photograph © 2004 by Larry Jurjens.DID IT PENETRATE THROUGH THE MUSCLES? OR WAS IT A CLEAN CUT DOWNTHROUGH THE WHITE TISSUE THAT'S OVER THE MUSCLES?It was a clean cut on her stomach. You could see her stomach inside and was not severedat all. It was all intact.YOU COULD SEE INTO THE BODY CAVITY?Yes, when I picked her back leg up.DID YOU TURN HER OVER TO SEE IF THE OTHER EYE WAS THERE?I did two days later I think it was Saturday. I went down and pulled her over. I wanted tosee if there were any holes like she had been shot. The other eye was still in her head.Presuming she was laying on her left side (originally), they didn't pick her head up to take(the left eye) out.There was two little holes right where her heart is and I never cut them open, but they wereabout the size of a bullet hole and they were just about an inch apart."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Two small holes in cow's chest that Larry Jurjens discovered and photographedafter he turned the cow over. White substances are bird droppings. Photograph © 2004 by Larry Jurjens.ABOUT A QUARTER-INCH WIDE IN DIAMETER AND ABOUT AN INCH APART.BASED ON WORK THAT I'VE DONE WITH VETERINARIAN PATHOLOGISTS INTHE PAST, THERE IS A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY THAT THE HEART WASREMOVED, LEAVING THE PERICARDIUM INTACT. WE'VE HAD SEVERALCASES. IT'S NOT POSSIBLE PHYSICALLY (WITHOUT EXCISION INTO THEBODY), BUT IT'S HAPPENED. SOMETIMES THESE TINY HOLES ARE IN THESECASES WHERE THE HEART TISSUE HAS BEEN REMOVED. WE DON'T KNOWHOW THAT IS DONE.DID YOU LOOK AROUND THE GROUND TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY UNUSUALTRACKS, EITHER THAT NIGHT OR LATER?Yes, I did. The cows, the other cattle had milled around her and there was a lot of manurelike maybe she had bellowed some and called the other cattle in. I don't know what causedall that. I've never seen the cattle around a dead cow like that, the way they were aroundher. And there were no tire tracks there. And I couldn't see any other tracks. It's dry in thiscountry and it's hard to see tracks.DID YOU CALL THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE?My son-in-law talked to the Sheriff, but he never did call me back.THAT'S STRANGE. WHAT ABOUT A VETERINARIAN?I talked to my vet, but it was several days after and he didn't think he could do anything.He didn't come out and look, but I did have a friend or two who did come out and look ather at the time.DID THE VETERINARIAN TELL YOU HE HAD DEALT WITH THESE CASESBEFORE?Not my vet. He's a young vet. He hasn't been in practice all that long. I'm sure he's heard ofit, but no, he has not done any of these. Unidentified Loud Aerial NoiseOn Tuesday Night, August 17, 2004NOW, YOU THINK SHE DIED A COUPLE OF DAYS EARLIER, SO THAT WOULDHAVE PLACED IT BACK AROUND TUESDAY NIGHT, AUGUST 17. DID ANYONEHEAR OR SEE ANYTHING UNUSUAL ON THAT NIGHT?Yes, there was a loud noise the night this happened. We figured it all come in together. Itwas a different sound. My neighbor heard it. I've had people as far as 20 miles away(Karen and Dan Hudson) tell me they heard that. And 5 miles away (Brenda and DaleOberg), they went out and looked at the sound. It didn't sound like a helicopter and it didn'tsound like an airplane. It was a total different sound.DID YOU HEAR IT YOURSELF?I did not, but my wife heard it. She woke up long enough to hear an awful noise.\" Witnesses To the Loud Noise"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Joanne Jurjens, Farnam, Nebraska.Photograph © 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe.Joanne Jurjens: \"I heard a low-flying aircraft going over the house. It was loud, slow. Itwasn't going real fast. It reminded me of a helicopter.IN WHAT WAY?In the noise it produced.LOTS OF NOISE.Ye s .DID THE HOUSE SHAKE IN ANY WAY?I don't know. You know, it woke me out of a deep sleep. It scared me. It lasted maybe aminute and I was just about ready to get my husband when it went out of range. But it wasa lower pitch. It was more of a rumbling sound, like a helicopter blades going around.BUT DID YOU HEAR THAT WHUP, WHUP, WHUP SOUND?Not quite like that. I don't know how to explain it, but it wasn't an airplane and it didn'tseem like a helicopter. But I don't know what to say it was.\" Twenty miles north of Joanne and Larry Jurjens' ranch, Dan and Karen Hudson heard theloud aerial noise at their home in Gothenburg.Karen and Dan Hudson, Gothenburg, Nebraska, twenty milesfrom the Larry and Joanne Jurjens ranch in Farnham.Photograph © 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe.Dan Hudson: \"I stepped outside and all I could see was a light on the bottom of it and itwas heading in a northwest direction. I saw a light and I heard a sound of a jet airplane, alarge airplane, sounding like they sound when they're coming in for a landing at bigairports.AND YET ALL Y YOU COULD SEE WAS ONE SMALL, WHITE LIGHT?Ye s . \"Karen Hudson was working at her computer.Karen Hudson: \"And it sounded loud. I thought to myself, 'The only thing that I can guessthat this might sound like and this is just a guess would be a large aircraft coming reallylow. It sounded really close and it was really loud. And my cat we have a cat that's in thehouse and she was just funny like on edge, mewing and acting really strange.HOW COME YOU DIDN'T GET UP TO GO LOOK?Good question I don't know. I can't answer that."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"BUT TO YOU SITTING AT THE COMPUTER, IT SOUNDED LIKE THE LOUD ROAROF A JET COMING IN DOWN LOW OVER YOUR HOUSE?I don't know if I would say a jet because I don't know planes. But something pretty largeand low, yes.\"Back in Farnam at the Dale and Brenda Oberg ranch house about eight miles from theJurjens' home, the Obergs heard the loud sound. Dale Oberg was puzzled by how loud andlong the sound persisted over their house.Brenda and Dale Oberg at their Farnam, Nebraska home, about eight milesfrom Larry and Joanne Jurjens. Photograph © 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe.Dale Oberg: \"We was watching television in the family room. It was just a real loud roarlike a plane or something and it just seemed to go on for about five minutes. And then wewalked to the end of the sidewalk right by our house there and I seen a little white lightgoing to the northwest there. And it just seemed like the noise stayed for so long and it wasjust like it come pretty close to over the top of our house.AND COULD YOU SEE THE LIGHT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SOUND THE WHOLETIME THAT YOU WERE OUTSIDE?I didn't get up for quite a little while. Then after it continued, that's when it continued. Welooked at the end of the house and we have some pretty big trees. So we couldn't seenothing. So, I walked a little further out west and that's when I seen the little white light.IN TERMS OF THE SIZE OF THAT LIGHT AND THE COLOR, COULD YOUCOMPARE IT TO ANYTHING I MIGHT KNOW?Well, it was just fairly white. Maybe just a little yellowish tint and it was blinking, Ithought.OFF AND ON.Yeah.NOT STEADY. AND WOULD YOU AGREE THAT ONE SMALL, WHITE LIGHT,EVEN IF IT WERE PULSING, IS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD ORDINARILY EXPECTTO SEE ON CIVILIAN, OR MILITARY OR COMMERCIAL AIRLINER OR CRAFT?You know, I don't know for sure. Don't they usually have some red lights on them?THEY USUALLY HAVE MANY LIGHTS.Yeah.THAT'S WHAT IS SO INTERESTING ABOUT THIS YOUR REPORT AND DANHUDSON'S BOTH ARE ONE SINGLE, SMALL, WHITISH LIGHT.You know, I've never been around aircraft at airports or nothing, but I thought maybe itwas one of those really big transport planes or something. I guess it struck me that it madeso much noise. Usually, something like these military ones that go over and stuff, they goso fast that they are here and gone. But this seemed to be real slow.DID IT HAVE A LOWER RUMBLING SOUND?Just a lot of noise, a lot of noise.AND IT LASTED FOR AT LEAST SEVERAL MINUTES?At least five minutes, because I was up in one room watching television and it was just likeit was over the top of our house and it just continued to make a noise. So, then we got upand walked out and looked and even when I could see the white light there, we could still"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"hear it real loud.THE NEXT DAY, I BELIEVE IT WAS YOUR WIFE, BRENDA, - SHE WORKS WITHTHE SENIORS?Yeah.SHE SAID ABOUT EIGHT OF THEM WERE TALKING ABOUT HAVING HEARDTHIS LOUD SOUND, TOO.Yeah. See, I suppose several of them would live right in Farnam. I think quite a few peopleheard it in town there. I'm sure they did. I understand the pasture where they found thecow is, I'm thinking the way a crow flies just straight across, it has to be at least five miles.\" Disappearing CattleLarry Jurjens: \"HAVE YOU EVER HAD ANY OTHER ANIMALS MUTILATED INYOUR 40 YEARS OF RANCHING?I've had the oddest things happen. I can't say I had anything mutilated.LIKE WHAT WOULD BE ODD THINGS?In this same pasture pretty near every year something happens in it and why this pasture? Ido not know. Three or four years ago, I had one of the top bulls I've probably ever owneddisappear out of this pasture. Disappear! Never found hide nor hair of him. My neighbor tothe south of me had one disappear a month before that and never found hide nor hair andwe rode and rode and rode. The bull of mine was about eight years old. He never did getout (before) and I seen him about three days before that and that was the last I ever seen orheard of him.\" Historic Cattle DisappearancesThere were cases reported in England in the 1970s in which cattle either disappeared fromfenced pastures, or entire herds were found in a neighbor's pasture, inexplicablytransported during the night. In the United States when the animal mutilation phenomenonoccurs, often animals are reported missing in the same region. One famous andcontroversial case occurred in Waurika, Oklahoma in the mid-1990s. A rancher reportedthat 1700 of his cows and calves disappeared one weekend. The case was never solved andthe insurance company finally settled with the near-bankrupt family. August 25, 2004, Field Investigationwith History Channel ProductionI traveled this week out to the Jurjens ranch in Farnam with Los Angeles producer, JeffreyWillerth, to work on a documentary special for the History Channel about the animalmutilation phenomenon, currently scheduled for broadcast in November 2004.As we walked up to the mutilated cow on Wednesday morning, August 25, the first thingthat struck me was that the animal had been laying there since at least Thursday afternoon,August 19, the day Larry Jurjens found her. Buzzards had been flying overhead and theirdroppings were on her body. But Larry said there were lots of coyotes in the canyon andnone had even approached the dead cow."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Morning of Wednesday, August 25, 2004, as we approached the mutilated cow first discoveredby Farnam, Nebraska rancher, Larry Jurjens, on Thursday evening, August 19, 2004.Photograph © 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe.I was especially interested in seeing the two small holes in the cow's chest that LarryJurjens found on August 19. I brought along a yellow pencil about one-quarter of an inch indiameter to see if it would fit in the holes. Larry was quickly able to find one of the twoholes he had puzzled over and it was too small for the pencil to enter.Above: Rancher Larry Jurjens tries to insert one-quarter-inch diameter pencil into holeon mutilated cow's chest. Be low: Close-up of the pencil lead stuck into the hole which was only aboutone-eighth inch wide. Photographs © 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe.Small hole in mutilated cow's chest surrounded by raised and lighter-colored tissue,highlighted by flashlight beam. Photograph © 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe.The diameter was closer to one-eighth of an inch. There was a clearly defined raised edgeencircling the hole. In past animal mutilation investigations when I've been able to havetissue analyzed by pathologists, those raised edges of mutilation cuts have shown evidenceof high heat, hot enough to cook the hemoglobin and collagen. So, Larry Jurjens helped mecut out the one hole we could find and I put it in an alcohol/distilled water mixture forpreservation and analysis. The second hole that he said was one inch from the other holewe could never find. There were a lot of worms and maggots embedded in the hide itselfby then and might have filled the second hole.I also collected grass and soil samples from around the cow's body and much further outfor controls to see if biophysicist W. C. Levengood can confirm any biophysical andbiochemical changes as we have in previous animal mutilation cases. Another Cow Mutilation Report"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"W h i l e We We r e I n F a r na mWhile we were working at the Larry and Joanne Jurjens ranch, Larry received a call aboutanother unusual dead cow and we took off to go see. The second ranch was a few milesaway and the red-haired cow was laying on her back atop a small ridge surrounded by hills.The farmers estimated she had been dead about twenty-four hours. Her ear tag had comeoff uphill about twenty feet from her body. One of her teats had been removed, perhaps bybuzzards. It did not have the clean, \"surgical precision\" I have seen so often at other animalmutilation sites. One of the cow's eyes was gone, but the socket was full of blood.Producer Jeffrey Willerth and the second Farnam mutilated cow we investigated for History Channeldocumentary on Wednesday, August 25, 2004. Photograph © 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe.Larry Jurjens used a rod to pry open the cow's closed mouth. The tongue had beenremoved from the back throat without blood in the mouth or on the ground. This particularanimal remains a puzzle for me because it is not like the classic mutilations of the pastseveral decades, but it's unlikely that predators could have removed the tongue so deeplyand cleanly from those clamped shut jaws.Above and be low: Farnam, Nebraska rancher, Larry Jurjens, pries open the dead cow's mouthto see if the tongue had been removed.
