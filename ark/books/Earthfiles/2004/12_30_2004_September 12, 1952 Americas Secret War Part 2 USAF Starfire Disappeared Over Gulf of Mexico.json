Feschino, Jr., Artist Illustrator, UFO Researcher and Author, The BraxtonCounty Monster: The Cover-Up of the Flatwoods Monster Revealed © 2004: \"Thereweren't just a couple of UFO sightings on September 12, 1952. I found out that there wereUFO sightings all over the Eastern United States, up and down the Eastern seaboard. Therewere thousands of people who saw UFOs that day and night.September 13, 1952, Wilmington Sunday Star, Wilmington, Delaware.WASN'T THAT ONLY A COUPLE OF MONTHS AFTER ALL THE EXCITEMENT OFDISCS SHOWING UP IN THE NATION'S CAPITOL?That's correct the 19th and 26th of July, 1952. So, this (Flatwoods, West Virginia, and Gulfof Mexico jet disappearance) were just about six weeks later. Jets and Crew DisappearancesOn September 12, 1952, over the Gulf of Mexico, an F-94 C Starfire disappeared 70 milesoff the coast of Tampa into thin air! I started researching an article I found in an oldSeptember 16, 1952, Daytona Beach newspaper."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"September 16, 1952, The Daytona Beach Morning Journal, Daytona Beach, Florida.I spent approximately eight years just researching this one incident and tying it into theFlatwoods, West Virginia, story. And there was even another incident that happened whenother jets disappeared out of Tyndall AFB, Panama City.ARE THESE OCCURRING ON OR AROUND THE SAME SEPTEMBER 12, 1952,TIME OF THE FLATWOODS MONSTER?Approximately 1.5 hours before.SO THE SAME DAY, ONLY AN HOUR AND HALF BEFORE THE FLATWOODSEVENT.Right, a radar operator and pilot vanished with their advanced Lockheed F-94C Starfire jetoff the face of the earth 70 miles off the coast of Tampa and MacDill AFB, after they tookoff from Tyndall AFB, in Panama City, Florida, on an alleged routine training mission withthree other USAF planes. The story was picked up by several different Florida newspapers.There was a lot of information in the reports. These reports never reached outside the stateof Florida, except for Oregon, where John Del Curto, the radar operator, was from.Official July 1952 USAF photograph of Lockheed F-94C Starfire, \"an all-weather interceptor ... on 24-hourduty protectingU. S. borders.\" Primary armament were rockets called Aeromite 2.75 Folding Fin Aerial Rockets (FFAR),fitted with explosive warheads which made the Starfire more deadly."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"September 14, 1952, News Herald, Panama City, Florida.September 16, 1952, The Tampa Daily Times, Tampa, Florida.The newspaper misspelled the radar operator's name. Frank Feschino talkedwith the family who confirmed it's John S. Del Curto.THE ESSENCE WAS THAT THE PILOT, JOHN A. JONES, JR., AND RADAROPERATOR, JOHN DEL CURTO, IN THE STARFIRE PLANE WERE BEINGTRACKED ON RADAR?Right.AND THEY DISAPPEARED, BUT THERE WAS NO CRASHED AIRPLANE ANDTHERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANY FOLLOW UP EXPLANATION ABOUT THESEPTEMBER 12, 1952, INCIDENT?Nothing whatsoever. There was said to be a massive air and sea search for hundreds ofthousands of square miles. These guys disappeared off radar into thin air. They were saidto have had a flame out which means they ran out of fuel. The odd part about the wholestory is that they never bailed out of the plane.WASN'T THERE SOME INDICATION, EITHER FROM THE RADAR OPERATOR ORFROM ANOTHER EYEWITNESS AT THE TIME, THAT THERE WAS AN'UNIDENTIFIED' IN THE VICINITY OF THEIR PLANE WHEN IT DISAPPEARED?Well, I stumbled across this other thing there was on the same page another story that hadoccurred involving a strange UFO object seen over Florida. But it was a couple of dayslater. But there was another article right next to the missing jet story about an 'odd balloon'found in the area of Tyndall AFB, Florida. In my book, I piece all of these stories togetherand made a timeline through the newspaper reports.WAS THE STARFIRE DISAPPEARANCE THE FIRST ANOMALOUS EVENT ONTHAT DAY OF SEPTEMBER 12, 1952?Involving military, it is. With jets. USAF Now Says No Records Of Airmen Or Disappearance"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED FROM THE BROTHER OF THE PILOT WHO WAS INTHE 1952 DISAPPEARANCE AND WHAT PROBLEMS HAVE YOU HAD IN TRYINGTO FIND DOCUMENTS ABOUT THAT PILOT AND RADAR OPERATOR?Over the years, I tried contacting different air force bases, trying to find out if there wereany records about this incident (Starfire F-94C disappearance on September 12, 1952). Icontacted Maxwell AFB. They wrote two letters back saying there were no records of thisincident in Maxwell AFB Archives. As far as they are concerned, it did not happen. Itcould be classified for some reason. I don't know. Maybe it's lost, or got burned up (July12, 1973 fire in National Personnel Record Center, St. Louis, Missouri.) See: 12-17-04Earthfiles.DID YOU GET CONFIRMATION ABOUT THE MILITARY SERVICE RECORDS OFTHE PILOT AND THE RADAR OPERATOR?There are no records of these two men on the face of the Earth. Even in the SocialSecurity Death Index, there is nothing. Maxwell AFB has no records of the incident or themen. This whole thing was just stuck away and buried. There is not one record on the faceof the Earth in government files of these men being born, dying, being in the US Air Force,existing, period. They are completely gone as far as current government records areconcerned.June 8, 1994, reply from Archie DiFante, Archives Branch, USAF Historical Research Agency,Maxwell AFB, Alabama, in response to Frank Feschino's inquiry about the disappearanceof USAF pilot John A. Jones, Jr., and his radar operator, Lt. John Del Curto.AS IF THERE WAS A DELIBERATE ATTEMPT TO ERASE THEIR EXISTENCE, ANDTHEREFORE, ERASE ANY LINK TO THIS EVENT?Oh, absolutely.WHAT HAPPENED LATER TO CONTRADICT THAT?I contacted both surviving brothers of the radar operator and the pilot. I was lucky enoughthen to get copies of the original Air Defense Command documents sent by GeneralBenjamin Chidlaw, Air Defense Commander in Colorado, and B. T. Kleine, who was fromTyndall AFB (3625th Flying Training Wing). I have copies of the letter and Western Uniontelegrams to the surviving families. They contradict today's USAF saying there are norecords of such an event on September 12, 1952, and no records of the pilot and radaroperator.
