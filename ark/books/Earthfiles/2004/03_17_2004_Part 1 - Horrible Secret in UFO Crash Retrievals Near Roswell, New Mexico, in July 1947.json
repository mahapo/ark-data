At thesame time over the decades, the American government and corporations haveback-engineered the alien technologies such as laser scalpels and minute integrated circuits.Back in 1983, while working on the documentary project for HBO (UFOs: The E.T.Factor) that I wrote about in my first book, An Alien Harvest, I met an elderly rancher wholived in Corona, New Mexico. He said he had known Mac Brazel, the rancher who foundstrange debris on his land and went to the Roswell Sheriff to report his discovery on July 4,1947. The Corona resident told me, \"I heard there was a horrible secret about that crash.\"Perhaps the answer to the \"horrible secret\" and why American policy ever since has beento deny ET existence at all costs began with the fear and shock that President Truman andhis close associates felt when they allegedly learned that dissected humanoids and animalparts were found inside and near at least two of the UFOs that crashed in New Mexico in1947.The 1997 book by Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso(now deceased) is available at amazon.com.In his book, The Day After Roswell, Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso described many advancedtechnologies that the United States government retrieved from crashed non-human aircraftand back-engineered. One of those technologies, according to Col. Corso, was what cameto be known as a laser scalpel in modern Earth medicine.Modern laser scalpel used in eye surgery.On Page 47 of his book, Col. Corso said:\"Why did the extraterrestrial inhabitants of the craft have a cutting device like this"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"aboard their ship?

Pathology studies confirmed the tissue was cutwith high heat. Photograph by Chuck Pine. Before he died, Col. Corso talked to me in private about the many classified documents hehad seen in Washington, D. C. when he returned from his World War II assignment in Italy.He told me that he had read with his own eyes highly classified reports dated as early as1951 about animals found in several parts of the world with the bloodless excisions and notracks around them. Col. Corso said the classified reports specified that the animalmutilators were \"extraterrestrial biological entities.\"Linda Moulton Howe with Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso on July 7, 1997,during festivities for the 50th Anniversary of the 1947 Roswell UFO crash/es held atthe original Roswell Army Air Field in Roswell, New Mexico.The subject was so sensitive, he told me, because the United States government was scaredthat if the public knew that something from outer space was able to pick up heavy animalsin beams of light, remove tissue and liquids with instruments that cut with light, and thenreturn the animals dead and mutilated to pastures that Americans, and the world, wouldpanic. Also, the advanced technologies needed to be kept out of the hands of humanenemies and developed and patented by American companies."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The Greeley Tribune, Greeley, Colorado, Sunday, November 2, 1980.Fear of public panic and desire to back-engineer the advanced technologies found incrashed UFOs is spelled out in the Security Section of the SOM1-01 document that isperhaps one of the most important American government documents ever leaked to thepublic. For details about its history and reprints of all the pages leaked on 35mm black andwhite film, please see my book Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness.The seal of the United States of America War Office was used fromthe 1940s into the 1950s on official U.

Current Situation, Page 3. Living Organisms, Page 17.Later in the training manual in a section entitled, \"Living Organisms,\" the United Statesgovernment laid down its strict policy of denying the existence of extraterrestrials and theirtechnologies in the interests of national security even as the government's high priority wasto retrieve and back engineer the advanced technology.But it appears that the non-human creatures and their craft and technologies have beenstudied by the U. S. government for at least half a century.The SOM1-01 Training Manual is dated April 1954 a time when President Harry S. Trumanand Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered that all matters concerning extraterrestrial entities andtechnology were to be denied in the interests of national security. But since then, therehave been a lot of leaks many out of deep frustration and anger.Today in 2004 fifty years later - frustration and anger are the emotions behind oneAmerican scientist's whistle blowing leaks since September 2002. He says he workedunderground at Area 51 from the mid-1980s to early 1990s and claims he interactedface-to-face with a brown-skinned, large-black-eyed, non-human kept inside a round, cleanroom filled with a cold hydrogen atmosphere because the being could not breathe theEarth's oxygen-rich air.Continued in Part 2.Websites:http://www.majesticdocuments.comCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
