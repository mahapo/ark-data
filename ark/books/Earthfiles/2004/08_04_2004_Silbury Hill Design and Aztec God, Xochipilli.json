Cycles of Time, in Life and Death In Mysteries of the Ancient Americas, the book states: \"To the Aztec, as to all ancientMesoamerican peoples, time proceeded not linearly, but in cycles. ... Just as the world wascreated, destroyed and recreated time and again, so smaller units of time repeatedthemselves. ...If life was impermanent for the Aztec, so, in the last analysis, was death.Life contained the inevitability of death, but death held within it the certainty of rebirth.For the Aztec, as for other native American peoples, death meant passage from earthly lifeto another existence on a different plane in a multi-level universe. For some, it also meanteven the possibility of return to earth, though in a different form.\" Also see: http://www.erowid.org/entheogens/xochi/xochi.shtmlWebsites:http://www.cropcircleconnector.comhttp://home.clara.net/lucypringlehttp://www.cropcircleresearch.comhttp://www.temporarytemples.co.ukhttp://www.bertjanssen.nlhttp://www.cccrn.ca/"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"http://www.cropcirclenews.comhttp://www.dcca.nlhttp://www.invisiblecircle.dehttp://www.wylatowo.mogilno.pl/news.php?art=94http://www.bltresearch.com/http://thecropcirclewebsite.50megs.comhttp://www.swirlednews.comhttp://www.heramagazine.nethttp://members.iinet.net.au/~bwratten/ccc.htmlhttp://www.CropCircleAnswers.comhttp://www.busty-taylor.com/cropper/98busty2.htmhttp://www.cropcircleconnector.com/ilyes/ilyes.htmlhttp://ufo.internauci.plhttp://www.wylatowo.mogilno.plCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
