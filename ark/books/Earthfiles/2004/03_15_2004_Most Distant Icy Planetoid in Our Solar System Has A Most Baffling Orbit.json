It travels in a very bizarre elliptical orbit thattakes it fromabout 8 billion to 84 billion miles from Earth beyond the Kuiper Belt of icy objects and near the edge of theOort Cloud,the source of comets. At those distances, the planetoid takes at least 10,500 years to complete one revolutionaround the sun. Image credit: Graphics courtesy of NASA and Cal Tech and Michael Brown. March 15, 2004 Pasadena, California - The first sight of a mysterious object movingslowly like a planet at the outer edges of our solar system was on November 14, 2003. Thediscoverers were astronomers Michael Brown at the California Institute of Technology andhis colleagues, Chad Trujillo of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii, and David Rabinowitzat Yale University. They have been working together on a NASA-sponsored project, NearEarth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT). The team contacted other astronomers who began to lookfor the object first labeled \"2003 VB12\" and is now unofficially dubbed \"Sedna,\" the nameof an Inuit woman in the Arctic who was thrown from a kayak by her frightened father.Here fingers became the sea creatures. Sedna is definitely a cold place, probably thecoldest object in our solar system, with temperatures never rising above MINUS 400degrees Fahrenheit.

Brown."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Ironically, as cold as it is, Sedna is red hot and shiny to look at through high-poweredtelescopes like the orbiting Spitzer Space Telescope. The astronomy team says that the onlyother object so red in our solar system is Mars. What would make such an intense red?\"Probably all its ice,\" says astronomer Brian Marsden, Director of the Minor Planet Centerat the Harvard Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Dr.Marsden helped this week to calculate the orbit of 2003 VB12/Sedna. He has also been atthe forefront of the astronomical controversy about whether or not Pluto should still becalled the ninth planet, or be reduced to the category of an icy planetoid - or \"Plutino,\" arecent new category applied to our solar system based. There are a lot of Plutinos and theyare all icy and smaller than Pluto. So, in fairness to Pluto, Dr. Marsden does not think the newly discovered icy body at theedge of the solar system on the outskirts of the Kuiper Belt should be considered a tenthplanet. In fact, what exactly it is and how it got to be where it is in such a radicallyeccentric orbit has Dr. Marsden and all the other astronomers baffled. Interview: Brian Marsden, Ph.D., Director, Minor Planet Center, Harvard SmithsonianAstrophysical Observatory, Cambridge, Massachusetts: \"\"This particular object which we still call '2003 VB12' - Sedna has not been approvedofficially - it takes 10,000 to 12,000 years to go around the sun. It's probably a little bitsmaller than Pluto, but its exact size is hard to say.The most interesting thing about it is that the orbit is so eccentric and it is never gets anycloser to the sun than 76 times the Earth's distance from the sun (93 million miles fromEarth to sun is called an Astronomical Unit, A.U.) and at its furthest, it's about 1,000 timesthe Earth's distance from the sun. It's a very eccentric orbit. We have absolutely no idea!How it got there in such an eccentric orbit that comes as close as 76 astronomical units toour sun and goes all the way out to nearly 1000 astronomical units away is a completemystery! There might still be something else out there causing this object's peculiar orbit.What I'm saying is that this new discovery is a complete mystery because I don't"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"understand how it can have an orbit that can go from 76 at one end to 1000 times theEarth's distance at the other. Planets Versus PlanetoidsNeptune is at 30 times the Earth's distance from the sun, 30 astronomical units. Neptune isin a circular orbit and is surely a planet. I have no problem with that it's big and massiveand affects other things. It affects Pluto, which goes from about 29 astronomical units at itsclosest out to about 53 at its furthest. Pluto has a somewhat eccentric orbit. When Plutowas discovered in 1930, it was indeed a mystery the same way this new object is now.People at the Lowell Observatory who discovered it decided to call it the \"ninth planet.\" Ithink that was a mistake. They also thought that Pluto was quite a bit bigger than it reallyis. They didn't have any way of measuring its size at that time. They were guessing whenPluto was discovered that Pluto was as big as the Earth. But we know that the diameter ofPluto is only a little over 1/8th the diameter of the Earth. Pluto is very small.IS THAT WHY IT'S ARGUED THAT PLUTO SHOULDN'T BE IN THE PLANETCATEGORY?You might say that. The search that lead to the discovery of Pluto was by Percival Lowellat his observatory in Arizona. He thought he was looking for something much larger eventhan the Earth, more the size of Uranus and Neptune. If it had been, there would have beenno question: that would have been the ninth planet. But, Pluto was a lot smaller than thatand had this very unusual orbit. There was no reason whatsoever to call it the ninth planet.Now, we've learned a fair bit about Pluto since that time. It was noticed in the 1960s thatthe period of Pluto's revolution about the Sun is half as long again as Neptune's. There is aresonance, we call it: 2:3 between Neptune and Pluto. What this resonance does is preventPluto from making close approaches to Neptune, even though the orbit of Pluto comesquite close to the orbit of Neptune. They are prevented from making close approaches toeach other. PlutinosBECAUSE OF THE GRAVITATIONAL AFFECTS.Because of the gravitational affect of Neptune which is manifested through this resonance.Now, in 1994, we discovered some other objects just like Pluto smaller, but they also hadthis 2:3 resonance affect. We know a couple of hundred objects like that now. So, Plutojust happens to be the largest of this group we call 'Plutinos' little Plutos.ARE THEY IN THE KUIPER BELT?They are part of the Kuiper Belt. The Kuiper Belt is a rather complex thing, but thePlutinos are part of it. The more regular part of the Kuiper Belt consists of objects thathave rather more circular orbits and not obvious resonance with Neptune and they go fromabout 38 astronomical units at perihelion to about 55 A.U. furthest from the sun. They arein that general range, in the average range of 42 to 47 A.U. They tend to be a bit further outthan the Plutinos and Pluto and they don't have orbits that go so close to Neptune's orbit.They are in a stable situation there and don't need to have a resonance with Neptune inorder to avoid close approaches to Neptune. 2:5 Resonance Objects At Edges of Kuiper BeltWhere Mystery Planetoid Comes ClosestWe've also found some other interesting objects out there, including a group that is in a 2:5resonance with Neptune going from about 30 A.U. at perihelion and an average distance of55 A.U., so at the furthest from the sun, they are about 80 A.U. This is close to where thisnew object is.This new object is minimum distance from the sun is 76 A.U. which it reaches in the year2076 and at its furthest, it goes out to 1,000 A.U. This is very, very strange. We don'tunderstand it at all. We don't know where it came from, why it is there. It is a real mystery.And also as far as size is concerned, it's a guess but it seems to be a little bit smaller thanPluto, probably like something like 1,200 miles in diameter maybe, whereas Pluto is about1300 miles in diameter. But to be honest, we really don't know how big this object is. Itcould even be bigger than Pluto if it has a very dark surface. Or it could be a lot smaller if ithas a very bright surface."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Size of New Planetoid?IN THIS MODERN DAY OF ASTRONOMY, WHEN WE THINK WE SHOULD BEABLE TO TELL THE SIZE OF SOMETHING IN OUR OWN SOLAR SYSTEM, WHY ISTHIS SO HARD TO PIN DOWN?It's very difficult to determine the size of small things, If you can look at something andactually see the disk of the object, the body of the object, like we look at the moon. Whenwe look at the moon, we see something that is 1/2 degree across. The moon does not looklike a star. It has a definite angular size to it and since we know the actual distance of themoon, we can work out very accurately just from observations from the Earth how big themoon actually is.But when we look at something that only looks like a star and this new object only lookslike a star. In fact most of the things that we look at look like stars. Yes, we are able to seethe major planets. But all the other things we look at just look like stars. There is no waysince a star is just a point, there is no way just looking at it to determine how big it is. Evenif you know how far it is as we do know how far away this is but we cannot determine itssize.What we do then is the next best thing. We know how bright the object is. We know howbright the stars are. We can measure one star in relationship to another. We can measureone asteroid in relationship to another and measure this new object in relationship to others.This new object appears to be shiny.HOW DID THEY SEE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE?This particular scientific group lead by Michael Brown were searching the Kuiper Belt andPlutinos where they have made some discoveries of other things there. This new one whichis moving even further away and more slowly, it was amazing that they detected it at all.The first detection was last November 2003 and since they could find it again a few dayslater and then they followed it all the way to the end of December. That was enoughinformation that they could then look for it on photographs and images from 2002 and2001. So, they have observations from the middle of 2001 to the end of 2003 and thisweekend, I arranged for some observations to be made in the Czech Republic and thosewere included in the orbital calculations.So we know the orbit really quite well. We know that it will be 76 A.U. near to the Sun in2076 when it comes to perihelion. Whether its exact revolving period around the sun is10,000 years, 12,000 years or in between is a little harder to say.The fact that this new object goes out to 1,000 A.U. and the perihelion distance is at 76A.U. is very curious. How can it interact with Neptune at that distance. Neptune is at 30A.U., Uranus is at 19 A.U. This new object's nearest approach to the sun is at 76 A.U. Sohow can you get a serious gravitational connection between them. I's a real mystery wherethis thing has come from. Could Sedna Be from the Oort Cloud,the Source of Comets?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Graphic depiction of the Oort cloud's spherical distribution of comets, rocksand dust around the solar system. The orbits of Uranus and Pluto are depicted at 50astronomical units (A.U.) from the sun (1 A. U. = 93 million miles). The distance from our sunto the outer limits of the Oort comet cloud is about three trillion miles, or one-half a light year.Our nearest star, Alpha Centauri, is four light years away. Graphic courtesy Yeomans, University of Louisiana.WHEN THE NEW PLANETOID IS FURTHEST FROM THE SUN AT 1,000 A.U.,WOULD THAT TAKE IT ALL THE WAY OUT TO THE OORT CLOUD?No, the Oort Cloud at its nearest is about 20,000 to 50,000 A.U. And this new object at itsfurthest is only 1,000 A.U. At that distance, this new planetoid is not a member of the OortCloud. It might be a member of what some people call the \"inner Oort Cloud,\" but that's avery uncertain concept. The true Oort Cloud has perihelion at 20,000 to 50,000 A.U. something we know from our observations of comet orbits that we have calculated forcomets.When we say there is an OorT Cloud, what we are basing that on is the fact that most ofthe comets we see do seem to be coming from that distance must be coming into the innersolar system for the first time. Something has sent them in. They weren't ever here before.Maybe distant stars or giant molecular clouds get the comets into our solar system and wetend to see them for the first time. Yes, they go out and some come back and we discoversome again subsequently. But an awful lot of comets are coming in for the first time andthat is the concept of the Oort Cloud source.This new object only going out to 1,000 A.U. cannot be said to be a member of the OortCloud and the perihelion distance at 76 A.U. is very curious as well because how can itinteract with Neptune at that distance. Neptune is at 30 A.U., Uranus is at 19 A.U. Thisnew object's nearest approach to the sun is at 76 A.U., so how can you get a seriousgravitational connection between them? It's a real mystery where this thing has come from! Could There Be Another Large Body OutThere Affecting Sedna's Orbit?WHAT YOU MEAN IS, HOW COULD IT BE PART OF THE SOLAR SYSTEMORIGINALLY?Yes, how could it be part of the solar system originally and get there where it is now? Whatperturbed it there into its bizarre orbit? We don't know. The planets that we know of are allin closer. Now maybe there's something out there, we don't know about. That's speculation.I don't know. But it is a puzzle as to how it got into this kind of orbit? And given also thatthe orbit is inclined at a relatively small angle to the planets, like 12 degrees only. Thatseems to suggest if you try to push it out into the Oort Cloud and then have it come back,that is a possibility and it didn't come in so close that it came in only where it is. But you'vestill got the problem you can't really do that because if it went out to the Oort Cloud, itsaphelion should be 20-50,000 A.U. Ok, something out there sends it into the solar system.It's not too likely to send it in at a low inclination. Most of the comets coming in from theOort Cloud have HIGH inclinations. But even if it sent it into 76 A.U., when then is theaphelion 1,000 A.U. ? There is no way! I can't think of any way of getting into this orbit,other than having some unknown planet or planets in the range from a few astronomicalunits from the sun. That's a speculation. We have no evidence for that."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"WOULD 1,000 A.U. FROM THE SUN BE THE OUTER EDGE OF THE KUIPER BELT?I would have to say it goes generally to 55 A.U., but yes you can make it go to 80 A.U. ifyou include these 2:5 objects. Also, there are the so-called disk objects and they go outeven much further. They go from about Neptune's orbit and maybe even out to severalhundred or 1,000 A. U. at aphelion. So, the Kuiper Belt becomes rather loose when youwant to talk about these things in eccentric orbits. But yes, indeed, this new discovery is aneccentric orbit. So, from the point of view that you can consider the Kuiper Belt might goout to 1,000 A.U., you could say that this object is part of it. But the puzzle becomes theperihelion how can you have something at 76 A.U. when all the other things we know havetheir perihelion generally in the 44 A.U. at the highest? We don't know of any perihelionbeyond that until now. It's a long way from 44 A.U. to 76 A.U. The difference is thedistance from Neptune to the Sun!THE BOTTOM LINE NOW WOULD BE THAT YOU AND ALL THE ASTRONOMERSWOULD BE PROVOKED TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER LARGER BODY OUT THEREBECAUSE OF SEDNA'S ECCENTRIC ORBIT?I would say so. That is the next thing we want to do find other objects like this. Find objectsmaybe in lower eccentricity orbits, more planetary-like orbits, and bigger objects. Youwould have to go out some distance to find something like even Earth size, because wewould have discovered it by now if it were bright enough. Or if it were having agravitational affect, to be close enough to have a gravitational affect on things we knowabout, we would have found it by now. This is fun, but it's created more questions than ithas solved. It's a mystery! A big planet out there would be easier to deal with.IS THERE ANY SPECTROMETER THAT COULD TELL WHAT THIS PLANETOID ISMADE OF?I think the Cal Tech press release mentions that it is very red. They said this is the reddestthing in the solar system apart from Mars. Now, there are other things out there that aresomewhat red. It may be that the things way out there in the Kuiper Belt, the really redthings out there, could be comets. My guess is that it's mainly ice, that it really is a comet.WOULD IT BE THE ROCKY MATERIAL OR ICE THAT WOULD PRODUCE THERED COLOR?It's probably more the ice.\"More Information:Sumerian scholar Zecharia Sitchin has studied cuneiform tablets and seals with drawingsthat are about 5,000 years old from Mesopotamia.
