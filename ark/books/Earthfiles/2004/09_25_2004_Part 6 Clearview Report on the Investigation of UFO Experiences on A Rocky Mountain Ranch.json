Derr, Ph.D., Seismologist, and R. Leo Sprinkle, Ph.D.,Psychologist With permission, reprinted in Earthfiles.com © 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe. \"He (Sheriff Yarnell) has personally seen the (UFO) ships going into the ground.He has had people tell him that they saw mutilations being done that he would nottalk about,or who was doing it and why.\" - Colorado rancherClick to Part 1 \"Barbara: I think the only other person I have talked to, who has had as manyexperiences as I have, is the law officer (Sheriff George Yarnell's Deputy, BillWaugh). And, if he'll open up, he's had some lulus. But again, what he has told me,has been in confidence. The things I have repeated, he has told in front of otherpeople. Roger has said that he would tell what he has seen and Harry said he wouldtell what he has seen. Again, I feel that each person has to do what he thinks is right.We still have all the pictures that Roger took. He took pictures of the footprints andpictures of the cattle that were mutilated. I told him that for the sake of the county,these cannot be released to anybody. We subsequently became friends, so I trusthim. We could never live there if the pictures were released. I would release them toyou or a group, in confidence. But I would never let them be released to the media.That's one of the things that we have lived in absolute dread fear of that someonethat came out there who was inexperienced, would go and tell someone else andthen say, 'Let's go out and see.' Investigator: I'm trying to think in my own mind, where do we go from here? I thinkthis could very well be a unique situation. I'm not familiar with anything else asextensive over a period of time. There were so many sightings. Barbara: That's because we stayed there. Investigator: Right exactly. Not only does it appear to be the most comprehensiveset of sightings that I know if, but also there's something still going on so that it is anexcellent opportunity to investigate. It cries out for an investigation with some sortof instrumentation. Jim: This has been my interest. Investigator: What could we do? One of the thoughts I had was to use some seismicexploration techniques to find the mine. From what you say, stringing a bunch ofwires on the ground could be a very interesting thing! Jim: It usually gets a very good reaction, especially a strange showing up and doingit. I'm sure that if a person really desired an encounter, they could quickly facilitateone. I believe that very strongly. One other thing has happened a number of times topeople who did not know what was happening and came out to the ranch for the firsttime. After being there a few hours, they would say, 'There is something very strange"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"about this. I feel very uncomfortable.' Somehow you feel that if all these people tellyou, it validates it somewhat. Barbara: That's the point that Jim got across to me, that if you talked to that manypeople, you could piece together a lot of validity and from a lot of points of view.That I do understand no two people see something exactly the same. Jim: Like the law officer you can tell from talking to him that he is a no-nonsenselaw officer type. I would rate his credibility extremely high. Each person has his ownlevel of credibility. Roberta's, for example, is very low. She will see Venus orairplane lights and think it's a UFO. Some people, like the law officer, know a wholelot more than they even told me. And I think he would tell a great deal of it, if hecould feel safe doing so. He doesn't want to lose his job and he doesn't want to beblackballed in the county. But from what I picked up from him, he wants to talk tosomebody about it. He's very upset and he wants to have it settled. They requestedthat the FBI come in and one FBI agent allegedly went out and talked to them. It justmade it worse. Nobody really wants to know what is happening. Barbara: When they had one mutilation, the law officer (Sheriff George Yarnell)cut a strip himself with a knife and sent it to the CBI. The lab sent a report backsaying it had been done by wild animals. I did not hear him say this, but this is whatwe were told. He felt that he was being given a lot of wrong information and hewanted to see if this was true. (Editor's Note from Linda Howe: I personally talked with Elbert County SheriffGeorge Yarnell (now deceased) in 1980 about his animal mutilation investigationsand he told me how he used his own knife to cut out a mutilator's cut, notched it,kept the matching notch as his evidence, sent the tissue to CBI which sent it on tothe Colorado State University's Veterinarian Diagnostic Laboratory in Fort Collins.Sheriff Yarnell was furious when he receive back a report that the tissue had beensevered by predators. He called up Carl Whiteside, Director of the Colorado Bureauof Investigation and demanded a meeting with the CSU people and CBI. The eventproved to Sheriff Yarnell that he and other law enforcement were always not gettingthe forensic truth.) Jim: There are a lot of things I don't think he would tell me, for the same reason thatI hesitated to tell you particularly after I laughed at him once. But I think withsomeone he felt comfortable and secure with, he would tell a whole lot more. Heindicated to me that a whole lot more things happened. (Editor's Note from Linda Howe: Sheriff Yarnell told me about one night hereceived approval from a local airport to do an aerial stake out without navigationlights over a particular Elbert County area that was having animal mutilations. In thesmall plane were the pilot, Deputy Bill Waugh and Sheriff Yarnell sitting in the backbehind the pilot. Sheriff Yarnell said he was looking for unusual light activity.Suddenly, the pilot yelled, sounding scared, and at the same moment Sheriff Yarnellsaw that ground lights were blacked out by a perfect circle of solid blackness belowtheir plane. For more than a minute, the black circle stayed directly below them untilas suddenly as it appeared, it disappeared.) A lot of these I can't relate because I'm in the position where I can't tell what he hasnot given me permission to tell. But there is a whole lot more, and I feel there ismore even than he told me because he alone was doing the police work in thecounty. He (Sheriff Yarnell) has personally seen the ships going into the ground. Hehas had people tell him that they saw mutilations being done that he would not talkabout or who was doing it and why. A lot of other things, he just clammed up on. Trust"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Barbara: Remember the people who lived over on that back section? He had hadsome really strange experiences, too. They had a mutilation, like about 50 yardsfrom their house in full view of the kitchen window and she had been in the kitchenwithin the time span that it had to have happened and had never seen anything. Thiswas in the daylight, early morning hours. That happens quite often. I don't know howmuch you have read about the mutilations, but quite often it is in plain sight of theroad. They try to track it down and find that somebody went by at 2 o'clock andsomebody went by at 4 o'clock and at 2 it was not there and at 4 it was. That's notunusual. But anyway, he came over one day to talk to us and to ask us somequestions and said that his father wanted to put up a big radar thing, but he could notget permission to do it. I never heard what came of that. I know they moved. Jim: I think that's the thing unless somebody opens up and invites someone to comein, investigation would be impossible. I told Barbara that we lived in the county andwere just as guilty as the rest by putting the lid on everything. Nobody would talkand we were accessories because we were afraid of the same sort of ostracism thateveryone was. Barbara: I think if you could get the point across to your UFO investigators thatthere is a need for absolute confidentiality, maybe you could find out something. If ithad only happened to Jim and me, we would never be here. Jim: If an investigation was done by a professional group in the interests ofprotecting the United States, those people would absolutely cooperate. It would haveto be approached from that basis, that somehow they were doing something good. Ithink on that basis, almost everyone would step forward and tell what they know, ifit was an accepted thing to do. I think if the law officer and a few of the other peoplewere approached on the basis of confidentiality, on the basis that it is the right thingto do, and that it will never stigmatize them, I believe they would come forward. Ireally believe that, don't you? Barbara: I think a good many of them would. Jim: The investigation would never leak to the outside. Everyone would know that itwas going on, but as far as it leaving the county, it would be the same thing thatsomehow they would be committing an offense by telling. They have a protectivething to each other. If someone was interviewed, no one would tell. Part of thereason that I have told you everything that has happened to me is that in order to getthe law officer to talk openly, I have to tell him that I told everything. If I don't trustyou enough to tell you everything, how could I ask him to? I think he (Sheriff George Yarnell) has a tremendous amount of information. I don'tknow what will come of it, but I think the information has to be available tosomebody who's trying to make sense of it. The government may know everythinganyhow. I don't know. I know they know a whole lot more (than they are telling). I'm sure they are covering with the helicopters, as I mentioned, because thosehelicopters that fly around out there are sent deliberately. They behave in a mannerthat draws suspicion. They land out in fields where they should not be. They aretrying, almost, to be the guilty party for the mutilations. And the helicopters are notof sufficient size to lift a 2600-pound bull. They just could not do it. Also, you could hardly carry a bull away in a helicopter in a manner so that it wouldnot be seen. If you remember, the mutilated bull on our property was not ours. It didnot belong on either side and nobody in the county reported a missing bull. The lawofficer said that he would ask around, but we talked to him a few months later andno one had reported a missing bull. It was quite a good one, too. The law officer saidthey could have picked it up in Idaho; that was his opinion. No one loses a bull theyhave taken that good a care of without raising Cain. It was an expensive animal."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Barbara: It would have had to come through two fence sections to get there. Thebones are still out there from both of them. They were never removed. Jim: There is still the physical evidence, too, of the burned spot on the top of thehill. But it is growing back in. I would not go back there to live because I fear for thefamily, not for myself. I think it quite likely that something might happen to me. Myfear at the ranch is that somebody might get hurt. I understand, as I said, that therehave been people who have disappeared. If I had the means, I would have run a fullinvestigation, but I don't have the technical expertise, and I don't think I could run anunbiased investigation. I think I got too emotionally involved to keep a clearperspective. Barbara: I don't think either of us can look at what happened objectively. Jim: I know that there are people who have the means and technical expertise to runthe investigation and I was hoping that somebody through this group would beavailable. That's why I wanted to approach Dr. Hynek. I thought that he might beinterested. It's not a one-time shot that can't be followed up. It's going oncontinuously. Investigator: Yes, it's a problem to conduct an investigation and to do it discreetlyand anonymously. Jim: And I'm pretty sure you would run into trouble with the U. S. Air Force if theyknew you were doing it. I have no doubts about it. Investigator: Do you have any evidence other than the helicopter flights that themilitary knows what is going on or has been investigating? Jim: First, I told you I called the military base and they told me to forget it. I first gota radar officer and he was telling me about 'unconfirms' on the radar scope. The nextthing, I was connected with the colonel who told me to forget it, shut up and mindmy own business. The other time we had Air Force planes overflying us at very low altitudes. We wentdown to the base to complain. At the base, I talked to an officer and he said, 'Well,what do you think the mutilations are?' I took a very neutral position, saying that itwas either the government, some wealthy Satanists, or UFOs. He asked which Ipersonally believed and I told him I believed that it was UFOs. He said that they hadhad their share of trouble with them there at the base, too. They had had directiveson how to deal with them. And then he asked me if I had had any trouble with 'BigFoot.' I said that Big Foot had been reported in the county. He said they haddirectives on Big Foot, too. I said that if he wanted to find them, I could tell himwhere to go. He said, 'Mister, I don't want to have anything to do with them.' So,obviously, there are some directives at the (U. S. Air Force Fort Carson; PetersonAir Field; and Ent AFB) base near here or I don't think he would give me a line likethat. Barbara: Oh, he did ask you one question. He asked you what the most popularopinion in the county was concerning the mutilations and what your personal opinionwas. Jim: The most popular opinion is the government. The second is UFOs. They figurethe government is doing it in helicopters from the military base. Most of the peopleare wise enough to realize that a group of Satanists, for example, wouldn't have themoney necessary to do what's being done, nor could they escape detection. Theother thing that indicates that the Air Force knew was the night the interceptorscame in low and I got everyone off the ranch. This was the next night after the twoNational Guard planes went down. There were two squadrons of attack interceptorscircling in that area. I got everybody off the ranch because I knew if the disks"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"showed up, they would come in probably shooting. It is just supposition that UFOstook those planes down, but they had two squadrons up there flying around forsomething. I was with the Air Defense Command and I know when they bring thosekind of planes out, they are nuclear-armed and they don't fly them around for games!I counted 26 aircraft and they were circling the whole horizon. They were surveyingeverything, supposedly to locate parts of the downed planes. This seemed like a veryunlikely thing for high speed interceptors with NORAD markings. [This was essentially the end of the first interview. Extensive, corroboratinginterviews have been conducted with the husband (John), the son (Joe), thephotographer (Roger), the friend (Harry), the \"kooky lady\" (Roberta), the restaurantowner, the law officer, and numerous other citizens of Clearview (not real name oftown). The investigation is continuing, in collaboration with the APRO consultant inanthropology, Dr. Peter W. Van Arsdale.]\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
