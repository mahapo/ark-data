Image credit: NASA/JPL.January 21, 2004 Pasadena, California - Scientists at NASA's Jet PropulsionLaboratory (JPL) in Pasadena yesterday were puzzled about the first soilexamined by the Spirit rover in its alpha particle X-ray spectrometer as it beginsits exploration of the Martian Gusev crater.\"We're starting to put together a picture of what the soil at this particular placein Gusev Crater is like. There are some puzzles and there are surprises,\" said Dr.Steve Squyres of Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, principal investigator forthe suite of Spirit instruments and upcoming on Spirit's twin, Opportunity, afterit lands on the other side of Mars on January 24, 2004, at 9:05 p.m. Pacific/12:05 a.m. January 25 ET.NASA reports that, \"One unexpected finding was the Moessbauer spectrometer'sdetection of a mineral called olivine, which does not survive weathering well.This spectrometer identifies different types of iron-containing minerals.Scientists believe many of the minerals on Mars contain iron. \"This soil containsa mixture of minerals, and each mineral has its own distinctive Moessbauerpattern, like a fingerprint,\" said Dr. Goestar Klingelhoefer of JohannesGutenberg University, Mainz, Germany, lead scientist for this instrument.The lack of weathering suggested by the presence of olivine might be evidencethat the soil particles are finely ground volcanic material, Squyres said. Anotherpossible explanation is that the soil layer where the measurements were taken isextremely thin, and the olivine is actually in a rock under the soil. Martian Soil Continues to Puzzle ScientistsScientists were also surprised by how little the soil was disturbed when Spirit's"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"robotic arm pressed the Moessbauer spectrometer's contact plate directly ontothe patch being examined. Microscopic images from before and after thatpressing showed almost no change. \"I thought it would scrunch down the soilparticles,\" Squyres said. \"Nothing collapsed. What is holding these grainstogether?\"Information from another instrument on the arm, an alpha particle X-rayspectrometer, might point to an answer. This instrument \"measures X-rayradiation emitted by Mars samples, and from this data we can derive theelemental composition of martian soils and rocks,\" said Dr. Johannes Brueckner,rover science team member from the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Mainz,Germany. The instrument found the most prevalent elements in the soil patchwere silicon and iron. It also found significant levels of chlorine and sulfur,characteristic of soils at previous Martian landing sites, but unlike soilcomposition on Earth.Squyres said, \"There may be sulfates and chlorides binding the little particlestogether.\" Those types of salts could be left behind by evaporating water, orcould come from volcanic eruptions, he said. The soil may not have evenoriginated anywhere near Spirit's landing site, because Mars has dust storms thatredistribute fine particles around the planet. Spirit Switches on Its X-ray VisionSpirit's rover arm reaches out to \"Adirondack\" rock on Mars to scratchsurface for analysis. Image credit: NASA/JPL.This image shows the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit probing its first target rockdubbed \"Adirondack.\" At the time this picture was snapped, the rover had begunanalyzing the rock with the alpha particle X-ray spectrometer located on itsrobotic arm. This instrument uses alpha particles and X-rays to determine theelemental composition of Martian rocks and soil. The image was taken by therover's hazard-identification camera.We b s it e :http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.govCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of this"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"screen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
