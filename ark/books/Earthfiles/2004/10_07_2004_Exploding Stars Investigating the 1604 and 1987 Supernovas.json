Thoseexploding stars are either small, very dense white dwarfs or massive red giants. The starliterally blows apart and unleashes a spherical shock wave that expands outward at morethan 22 million miles per hour (10,000 kilometers per second.) Modern astronomers canusually determine which stars caused specific known supernovas. But there is one that stillbaffles astronomers. The light from it flared into human consciousness four hundred years ago on October 9,1604. Astronomer Johannes Kepler reported the sudden appearance of a bright \"new star\"in the western sky. Since then, it has been known as \"Kepler's supernova.\" Of the sixknown supernovas in our Milky Way galaxy over the last 1,000 years, Kepler's supernovais the only one that astronomers are uncertain of the star type that exploded. Today a team of astronomers led by Ravi Sankrit and William Blair of Johns HopkinsUniversity in Baltimore, Maryland are using the Spitzer Space Telescope (infrared), theChandra X-Ray Observatory (x-rays) and the Hubble Space Telescope (visible light) toanalyze the Kepler supernova remains in infrared radiation, x-rays and visible light. October 9, 1604, a \"new star\" flared in the western sky which astronomer Johannes Kepler reported.Modern astronomy is now looking at Kepler's supernova with x-ray, visible and infrared instruments.Credit image: NASA, ESA, R.

Observations from each telescopehighlight distinct features of the supernova remnant, a fast-moving shell of iron-richmaterial from the exploded star, surrounded by an expanding shock wave that is sweepingup interstellar gas and dust. \"Visible-light images from the Hubble telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys revealwhere the supernova shock wave is slamming into the densest regions of surrounding gas....The Spitzer infrared data is sensitive enough to detect the entire expanding shock wave,a spherical cloud of material. This dust is similar to dust that was part of the cloud of dustand gas that condensed to form the sun and planets in our solar system. ...The ChandraX-ray data shows the hottest gas is located primarily in the regions directly behind theshock front.\" The brightest cosmic explosion seen since Kepler's Supernova in 1604 was discovered onFebruary 23, 1987, by astronomers. The exploding star flared with the brightness of 100million suns. February 23, 1987, supernova SN 1987A exploded with the brightness of 100 million suns.Image credit: NASA, P. Challis, R. Kirshner, Harvard-Smithsonian Centerfor Astrophysics, and B. Sugerman, Hubble Space Telescope. Finally on November 28, 2003, the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard NASA's HubbleSpace Telescope, got a clear image that is startling. The object \"shows many bright spotsalong a ring of gas, like pearls on a necklace. These cosmic 'pearls' are being produced as asupersonic shock wave unleashed during the explosion slams into the ring at more than amillion miles per hour. The collision is heating the gas ring, causing its innermost regions toglow. Curiously, one of thebright spots on the ring at 4 o'clock position is a star that happens to lie along thetelescope's line of sight.\" Websites: http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/ http://chandra.harvard.edu/"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/ Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
