Photograph © 2004 by Ella Huff. July 4, 2004 Spanish Fork, Utah - Over the past decade, there have been at least ninecrop formations in Utah and at least three in the Provo and Spanish Fork area south of SaltLake City. But the largest was in College Ward, about 80 miles north of Salt Lake City andProvo, in 1998 on the same day that similar circles appeared in Oregon, Idaho andBelgium. This year on Saturday night, June 26, 2004, a Spanish Fork farmer noticed plants down in abarley field. He called his father who owns the field. The father was angry that any intruderwould touch his plants and called the police. By Tuesday morning, June 29, a story aboutthe new, 4-ring Spanish Fork crop formation was published in the local newspaper. Nancy Talbott, President of BLT Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts, heard the news.Nancy has been testing plants and soils from crop formations for several years and in 2004,she is studying what effect energy systems that create patterns in crops might have onmycorrhizal fungi that are known to grow symbiotically in plant roots. So she organizedsome samplers to coordinate with the farm owners and surface soil, soil plugs and plantswere collected for study.Interview:Nancy Talbott, President, BLT Research, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts: \"The cropis barley and there are no tramlines as we're used to them (in England). The plants havenode elongations, but relatively subtle. The only way to tell for certain would be to do ananalysis of the node lengths. Also, node expulsion cavities were seen by the BLT samplers."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Spanish Fork, Utah, crop formation discovered in barley by farm owner's son the eveningof Saturday, June 26, 2004. All photographs © 2004 by Ella Huff.Mycorrhizal Fungi StudyWe've done surface soil sampling and core sampling for the mycorrhizal fungi study. Wedid quite a bit so it took a couple of days to get it all done.(Howe's Note: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM) has been found in association withplant roots all over the world. A clear symbiotic relationship has been demonstratedwhereby plants exude photosynthates for the fungus to metabolize; in return, the fungusscavenges for essential elements that may be rare in a particular soil.)It's a study of fungi in the roots of the crop circle plants. The idea here is that these energieshypothesized to create crop circles are likely, if they have an effect on the plants asdemonstrated by Levengood's work over the years and on the minerals as demonstrated bythe XRD study we could then expect that we would see changes in the fungi that will beconsistent with exposure to one energy or another. The idea is to see if we can findsupporting evidence for any of the data that's already been submitted by various studies bydifferent people. You don't know what you're going to find until you've done it.WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU'LL HAVE RESULTS BACK ON SOIL AND PLANTS?This fungi study is going to take all summer long. We're going to look at five or six of these(in crop formations) this summer and the results of that won't be available until the fall orwinter probably winter 2004. The surface soil work on this might be ready in a month.DO YOU HAVE ANY PREVIOUS DATA FROM FUNGI STUDIES IN THE ROOTS OFCROP CIRCLE PLANTS?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"No, this is a brand new first time look. There are a wide variety of questions and hope weare going to have the right ones.PART OF WHAT YOU WILL BE LOOKING FOR WOULD BE THE EFFECT OFSOMETHING LIKE A MICROWAVE RADIATION OR IONIZATION PLASMA IMPACTON ROOTS?Right. What would the presence of microwave radiation do to (the fungi?) There is already it's known that these fungi respond to certain conditions in certain ways. Therefore, if infact the microwave radiation was present or ionization or this energy that seems to beresponsible for the changes in the crystallization of the clay minerals there should be somesort of marked effect on at least some of the fungi. That is what we are looking for.YOU MIGHT EVEN SEE COOKED FUNGI?I can't answer that. I suspect so, but I can't say yet. Crystallization in Soil ClayWHAT ABOUT CRYSTALS IN THE SOIL? (BLT conducted an x-ray diffraction study,XRD, of clay-mineral crystallization in a 1999 Edmonton, Alberta, Canada crop formation.See: http://www.bltresearch.com/xrd.htmlThe XRD study is very expensive and the only sensible way to do that is first of all, you'vegot to have a lot of money to pay for the work. And you have to do a lot of samples and alot of controls to do an XRD examination. One or two or a half dozen samples does notmean anything. So, there is no point, unless you are doing a real major study, you can't justlook for them simply, is what I'm trying to get across. I'm hoping some day to repeat theXRD study, but it will be an entire project, if we do, and it will mean we've been able toraise significant funding. What Spanish Fork Residents Saw and HeardThe most interesting thing about this Spanish Fork formation so far is we do have severalreports one from the local newspaper reporter - of animals behaving very peculiarly, just aswe had in Arkansas. See 06-02-04 Earthfiles. A dog, or multiple dogs, at the businessacross the road were reported to have been barking all night long and carrying on. Then wefound a neighbor abutting this property who had a dog and a cat, both of which weremaking very strange noises throughout the night. These animals were both inside the houseand they were described as making eerie noises and refused to go outside, which is notnormal. They normally go outside quite a bit.And apparently a woman who lives in that house at some point went outside to see why theanimals what was causing the problem with the animals and she reports that she becamefrightened outside and got a very creepy feeling and had to go back inside. She didn't see orhear anything, but her home is within a quarter mile of the field. Something spooked her.This is an interview being followed up now.The only other report that was interesting that there was cell phone failure reported by thefarmer's son in the formation and I gather that was on Tuesday, the first day he went in. Hereported that his cell phone would not work. The field workers that their batteries failedconsistently in their cameras and they had to replace them three times in order to get thephotographs we take on the ground.Then I got an e-mail from a local visitor on Wednesday who said his son was able to usetheir cell phone on Wednesday.SO A TRANSIENT EFFECT?So, it was either a very brief effect or the owner's son there was something wrong with hiscell phone. The camera, however, is working perfectly normally since it was inside theformation. It just got battery drainage when it was in there.DID ANYONE REPORT ANY LIGHTS OR UNUSUAL AERIAL PHENOMENA?There is one report we are still chasing and I have a feeling it's going to take us a week orso. But there is a report of unusual light phenomena and until we know the details, I wouldrather hang back."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Crop Formation's Physical Impact On FarmersAnother thing is that the farmer's son and field worker both reported a very intense achingof their legs. This has been reported in Europe in a couple of situations and I think youmight remember in Maryland some years ago?YES, BLUE BALL, MARYLAND.When I visited that case several weeks after it occurred, I also had this. People who hadgrowing pains in their legs as kids might remember. It's a very distinct and unpleasant achethat many children go through as their bones are growing and developing. That's what thefarmer's son reported in this case the night after he was in the formation, which would havebeen Tuesday, June 29. The field worker reports the same thing and since it is not widelyknown that that can happen, I wonder if it might be important in this case also.DOES THE LEG ACHE AFFECT SOME PEOPLE AND NOT OTHERS?The aching thing in every case I know about where that has been reported it has in factaffected everyone who was there at that time.CLOSE TO THE TIME THE FORMATION WAS CREATED.Yes, and usually in specific locations in the formation. I know in Holland where this hasoccurred a number of times, Robbert Van den Broeke's father has told me many times thathis son would report various feelings or insights or would see things that the fatherwouldn't. The father told me he wished that he could. Then there was a formation a coupleof years ago that they related to a member of their family who had passed on. Robbert wasfeeling the tingling in his legs very strongly and told his father exactly where to stand. Inthat case, when Peter did stand in that area, he then experienced the aches in his leg also.And that's what happened to me when I was in Maryland when George Reynolds, who wasthe field worker in that case, told me where he had been standing and I felt it also quitestrongly. Later that day, it hurt like the dickens.I REMEMBER THAT BLUE BALL FORMATION AT THE TIME WAS THE LONGESTNODE LENGTHENING AND REORIENTATION THAT W. C. LEVENGOOD HADEVER MEASURED.The most elongated, yes. Since then there have been one or two others that were at thatrange or slightly greater, but that was up to 200% elongation.Blue Ball, Maryland, 1995. Top: Normal wheat stems and growth nodes.Bottom: Nodes lengthened 130 to 200 percent and reoriented.Photographs © 1995 by biophysicist W. C. Levengood. How to Report Crop Formation to BLT ResearchI think the telephone call is the fastest and easiest and if people call me, I'll call them rightback to save their long distance charges. If in fact we are going to continue to get a fewmore formations for this (fungi) study, the sooner the better."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Telephone number: 617-492-0415Website: www.bltresearch.comRight on the top in the left hand corner, it says: 'Report a crop circle.' If you click on that,you get a form that you just fill in and then hit Go.More Information:Crop farmers' livelihoods are dependent upon harvesting. So, in the event of cropformations in fields, Nancy suggests that farmers in the United States - as some farmershave done in England - deliberately mow a path to the crop pattern and then chargeentrance to visitors. That way the farmer can receive some financial compensation for hisdowned crop, the public can see the crop formation, and research people can investigate. Alegal proviso in all instances should be that visitors enter farm property, with its unexpectedholes and ditches often hidden by tall grass or plants, at their own risk.Website:http://www.bltresearch.com/http://www.cropcirclenews.comhttp://www.cropcircleconnector.comhttp://thecropcirclewebsite.50megs.comhttp://www.cropcircleresearch.comhttp://home.clara.net/lucypringlehttp://www.bertjanssen.nlhttp://www.cccrn.ca/http://www.dcca.nlhttp://www.invisiblecircle.dehttp://www.wylatowo.mogilno.pl/news.php?art=94http://www.temporarytemples.co.ukhttp://www.swirlednews.comhttp://www.heramagazine.nethttp://members.iinet.net.au/~bwratten/ccc.htmlhttp://www.CropCircleAnswers.comhttp://www.busty-taylor.com/cropper/98busty2.htmhttp://ufo.internauci.plhttp://www.wylatowo.mogilno.plCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
