Photo courtesy NOAA Photo Library 1980.Hurricanes Charley, Frances and Ivan between August 13 to September 14, 2004, have been Category4 and 5,an unprecedented event in American recorded weather history. The National Hurricane Center saysIvan has had the 6thlowest barometric pressure on record. Hurricane intensity is measured using the Saffir-Simpson Scale,ranging from one(1) (minimal) to five (5) (catastrophic). Cat 3-5 hurricanes have caused over 70% of American naturaldisaster damage.Source NC Division of Emergency Management Hazard Mitigation Section. September 14, 2004 Greenbelt, Maryland - In a four-week-period from August 13 toSeptember 16, 2004 - for the first time on record in American weather history - three majorCategory 3 to 5 hurricanes made landfall in the southeastern United States. Charleyintensified to a Category 4 hurricane and made landfall with winds of 145 mph, and guststhat topped 180 mph in Punta Gorda which was devastated along with Port Charlotte onAugust 13. Charley cut a huge swath of upturned trees, downed power lines, flattenedtrailer homes, destroyed houses and businesses all across central Florida, includingOrlando, and killed at least 27 people.Then came Frances, charging into Florida's east coast Sunday, September 5, as a Category3 hurricane with 115 mph sustained winds and dropped more than 20 inches of rain insome areas. Frances did more damage to the Kennedy Space Center than any other stormin history, ripping an estimated 1,000 exterior panels off the building where spacecraft areassembled. Frances killed at least 25 people.Incredibly, right on top of Frances came Ivan a hurricane so large and powerful that itremained in a Category 4 to 5 for days, churning through Grenada, Jamaica, Cuba andfinally making United States landfall around 3 a.m. on September 16, near Gulf Shores,Alabama. By then, it was a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 130 mph. Ivan killed atleast 23 people in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia and Alabama and at leastanother 68 are dead throughout the Caribbean.The destruction from those three hurricanes alone will be billions of dollars and the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"hurricane season won't be over until December. Is this unprecedented series of landfallhurricanes a harbinger of future weather patterns due to global warming?From the Earth's atmosphere and ocean point of view, hurricanes are a way to get rid ofheat build up from the condensation of warm water at the equator. They form, as theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says, where there is \"a lowpressure disturbance, sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures, a rotational force fromthe spinning of the earth, and the absence of wind shear in the lowest 50,000 feet of theatmosphere.\" The hurricane season is technically June through November with the peak inmid-September.At the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Global Precipitation Measurement Mission,Research Meteorologist and Deputy Project Scientist, Marshall Shepherd, Ph.D., tries tobetter understand the physics of hurricanes. I asked him this week if the intensity of the2004 hurricane season could be related to global warming?Interview:Marshall Shepherd, Ph.D., Research Meteorologist and Deputy Project Scientist forGlobal Precipitation Measurement Mission, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,Greenbelt, Maryland: \"It's not a warming in the Atlantic. It's just warmer than usual. It'salways warm. I don't want to give an indication that it's an anomalous warming. It's just anatural cycle by which other factors are likely at play related to something called the'Thermal Halene Circulation' which is the circulation that drives the ocean currents andtransports heat and energy from the tropical regions of the planet to the northern regionsand back down.The Atlantic temperatures are slightly higher than normal and that's a process we don'tquite understand. We don't quite know the answers right now in terms of what drives thecirculation in such a manner that we would get this multi-decadal warming phase. But wethink it's a natural occurrence.Keep in mind that the National Hurricane Center did project 6 to 8 hurricanes this year and2 to 4 of them becoming major. So, if after Ivan we don't get any more hurricanes, thisseason would turn out to be statistically consistent in terms of numbers. But if it continuesbeyond after Ivan? - well, we'll see how it stacks up. Certainly, August was a record monthfor the number of named storms that we saw. That is an accurate statement.WHY WAS IT THAT THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER PROJECTED THEREWOULD BE AT LEAST EIGHT HURRICANES THIS SEASON?There are factors these long-term projections take into account. They look at things likehow much rain fell the previous fall or in the previous season in the western African regionor continent of Africa. They look at what the projected sea surface temperatures will be.They look at whether there is an El Nino in place or not.In the early part of this year (2004), the west African rainfall and sea surface temperaturesand the lack of an El Nino tended to point toward an active season. Again, the fact that wemight have re-entered a naturally more intense cycle in 1995 also indicated that. In thepast couple of years, we've had major Cat 4 hurricanes that did not make land fall and sodid not make news. But there has been an uptick in hurricane activity. 1995 was one of themost active hurricane seasons on record. Is There A Natural 20 to 30 Year Oscillationof Hurricane Season Intensity?COULD YOU PLEASE CLARIFY WHAT THE CYCLE OF HURRICANES THATBEGAN INTENSIFYING IN 1995?What we think we've entered is a natural cycle in which there have been records in thepast back to paleo-climatological records when none of us were around there are records inice core samples and tree rings that suggest we've gone through this kind of cycle wherethe temperature in the ocean raises a bit to the warmer side; the upper level wind patternsare not as much out of the west, but more out of the east so the shear is not as bad anddoes not tear hurricanes apart; the rainfall in Africa increases over the previous season. Allthese factors tend to be associated with this natural shift in temperature and wind patternsthat are more conducive for the development of storms that we think we entered again in1995. They have a multi-decadal signal to them, so once you enter you tend to stay in for acouple of decades and come out into a quieter period and that's where we think we areright now."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"HOW LONG IS THE QUIETER PERIOD BETWEEN THESE COUPLE OFDECADE-LONG CYCLES?The most recent lasted from about 1970 to about 1994 that's two to three decades.THEN A COUPLE OF DECADES OF MORE INTENSE HURRICANE ACTIVITY ANDTHEN TWO OR THREE MORE DECADES WHERE IT IS QUIETER.That's right. It really is a pendulum, a periodic cycle. That's why I caution the discussionabout global warming because for those who want to make this a global warming debate,you wouldn't tend to see this periodicity because certainly in 1970 to 1994, some of theissues that people talk about in global warming were in place. But it was a relatively quietperiod.DO YOU THINK THIS PERIODICITY IN THE HURRICANE SEASONS COULD BERELATED TO SOLAR CYCLES?Whenever you start talking about periodicity, that question does come on to the table andit's one that over time we'll learn more about. As you know, I work at NASA and NASAhas quite an active program doing on right now to understand the Sun and Earthconnection. We have launched several new satellite systems over the recent years and willbe launching several more to try to understand just what earth processes are impacted bysolar processes. The short answer is that we don't have a conclusive answer to thatquestion, but it's certainly worth looking at.Would Global Warming Cause More Intense Storms?There is indication that temperatures have edged up, but I can point to information thatsuggest that we are seeing areas of the globe experiencing their coolest temperatures onrecord as well.So, one of the questions out there is: If under a global warming scenario would that in turnlead to an acceleration in some parts of the water cycle? Would we see more evaporationin the oceans? Would we see more severe storms, more intense hurricanes? There havebeen those who speculated that, but until we have the proper tools to answer thosequestions, it's speculation.IF THE TEMPERATURES IN THE ATLANTIC CONTINUE TO BE WARMER THANNORMAL, THAT WOULD SET IN MOTION THE CONDITIONS FOR HURRICANESEACH SEASON TO BE MORE INTENSE?Not necessarily. You're assuming that sea surface temperatures are the only factor drivingintense hurricanes. They certainly are one of the necessary ingredients, but one of thereasons this particular year is seeing fairly active storms is not only because of the seasurface temperatures being warmer, but we also have an environment where there is not alot of shear in the upper levels of the atmosphere which tend to tear these storms apart.One of the reasons is that we don't have an El Nino right now. During non-El Nino periods,we tend to see jet stream patterns further to the north and they don't tear the storms apart.So, when El Ninos come around, we tend to see suppressed activity in the Atlantic Oceanbecause of the shear. That's just one of several factors that have to come together toproduce these active hurricane seasons. Right now, all of these factors are in place: thehigh pressure system out over the Atlantic is in the exact location that it needs to be tosteer these storms to land fall.What's really unique about this particular year is that a lot of these storms are making landfall and that's simply because of the meteorological conditions that are conducive to tracksthat make land fall, not necessarily related to global climate change at all.\"Websites:http://www.accuweather.comhttp://www.nasatech.com/spinoff/spinoff2001/goddard.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"earthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
