See: 10-14-04 Earthfiles and 10-20-04 Earthfiles. October 22, 2004 Lufkin, Texas - On Monday, October 18, I contacted veterinarian,Craig Wood, D.V.M., at the East Texas Veterinary Clinic in Lufkin, Texas, to see if hewould be willing to excise the head and other body parts from the animal Stacey Womack'sbrother shot on October 8, and ship to a veterinarian DNA diagnostic laboratory. Dr. Woodagreed to help if Stacey would dig up the animal and deliver to his clinic. On Wednesday,October 20, Stacey drove the skeleton enshrouded with dark hide to Dr. Wood's office.Given controversial headlines about \"chupacabras\" connections, I asked him for hisprofessional assessment.Interview:Craig Wood, D.V.M., East Texas Veterinary Clinic, Lufkin, Texas: \"I think it's a coyotewith a fractured jaw on both sides, a coyote with congenital defects that had a severe skincondition. The skull structure is the same (as coyote) and front legs are the same length asthe back legs. Also, there are the same number of vertebrae, lumbar and thoracic cervicalvertebrae. Skull structure is the same.Teeth and Jaw AnomaliesThe amount of teeth (probably) was the same (as a coyote's), but some are missing. Thelength of the canine teeth are the same. They seemed to be exaggerated in the photo (byStacey) because the soft tissue was receded and drawn back. Because it has an overbite,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the top canine teeth tended to sharpen the bottom canines which gave them a little bitdifferent look. The make-up of the skull, the size of the zygomatic arches underneath theeye sockets all of this is consistent with a coyote, a canine. The size is about right a littlebit small. But there was not anything unusual.Looking at the feet, they were not retractable claws. They had the same number of bones(as a coyote). They were just worn down is what it was.The creature's long, dark claws. Digital image © 2004 by Stacey Womack.THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT STACEY THOUGHT. SHE SAID THEY WERE NOTWORN DOWN AND THAT THE ANIMAL WAS YOUNG?I think the animal was fairly young, just looking at the teeth which all have gum. Butbasically right now, I have a skeleton with a shroud of leather around it is all. But lookingat the teeth, they were young.The one comment I would make to you is that the jaw was fractured bilaterally on bothsides, which could have resulted from any sort of trauma. At the same time, the very tip ofthe jaw where the two mandibles come together was eroded and worn and the incisorswere missing, the lower incisors. That suggests to me there was some sort of bonedeficiency to begin with, a metabolic deficiency. I don't know what type. But that'sprobably why it was easier for the jaw to fracture out in nature. Genetic AnomalyTHIS IS SUGGESTING THAT IF IT WERE A YOUNG ANIMAL, THERE WAS SOMEGENETIC ANOMALY?Probably so, yes.WHAT WOULD BE MAKING THE GENETIC ANOMALY IN THAT ANIMAL ANDPERHAPS THAT ONE IN ELMENDORF?I don't know anything about the one in Elmendorf, but I imagine this is just some sort ofdeficiency, some metabolic change. If you have a large enough population, you will getabnormalities. That's the way Nature is."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WHAT ABOUT THE SKIN OR HIDE? STACEY SAID THAT UPON ARRIVING RIGHTAFTER THE ANIMAL HAD BEEN SHOT THAT SHE HAD TRIED TO RUB IT WITHA STICK AND FOUND IT POWDERY AND NOT ELASTIC?I don't know at this point. The skin was not in a condition that we could examine. But Ithink you had an underlying problem, a severe skin infection, possibly a mange orsarcoptic mite problem. All of these would have been easier to be present if the skin wasnot normal to begin with. It would be easier for pathology to set up. There might have beenan immuno-deficiency, the same thing that affected the bones may have caused the skinnot to be as elastic as it should be or as healthy as it should. It would be very easy for otherthings to contaminate it. Then you see it several weeks or months down the road, you'vegot nothing but hairless hide.STACEY SAID THE EAR SEEMED TO BREAK OFF LIKE A COOKIE?The skin was not in a condition for us to examine. But probably at that point in the game,the circulation was so poor to the extremities, to the skin itself, that it was not normal. Sofor it to fall apart would not be unheard of.SO THE MYSTERY IS WHAT WAS THE PATHOLOGY, OR THE GENETICABNORMALITY OF THIS ANIMAL?I guess so, yes.IF IT IS LIKE THE ONE IN ELMENDORF THEY ARE SIMILAR THEN BETWEENMAY AND OCTOBER THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN TWO ANIMALS 300 MILESAPART THAT LOOKED SIMILAR UPON DEATH.I think what you've got are coyotes that have some skin pathology and some disease. Ithink the population is a lot greater than what people expect as far as coyotes areconcerned. Again, you take a large enough population horses, humans, dogs, whatever youwill get abnormalities.DO YOU THINK IT IS WORTH AN INVESTMENT OF ANY KIND TO DO ANY KINDOF DNA ANALYSIS?I don't. I can with certainty tell you what species you are looking at (canine coyote). Idon't think DNA is going to tell you what disease processes were set up before death. Butas far as species, I think we already know.IF STACEY AND HER BROTHER OR ANYONE ELSE CAN TRAP A SIMILARLOOKING ANIMAL, WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO LOOK AT IT ALIVE JUST TOMAKE A DETERMINATION THERE?Yes, I would examine it.\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
