NOAA's startling finding is that betweenthe year 1800 - the beginning of the Industrial Age - and the year 1994, the amount of CO2being released into the atmosphere and oceans keeps rising exponentially. The world'soceans absorbed 118 billion metric tons of carbon over that period which is making seawater less alkaline and producing regions of carbonic acid. Carbonic acid can dissolveshells on sea creatures, leaving them vulnerable to predators. Both European and American studies report that Europe is warming up more quickly thanthe rest of the world. By the end of this century, average temperatures in Europe couldclimb between 3.6 and 11.3 degrees Fahrenheit because of global warming caused byincreasing CO2 and other greenhouse gases. The Swiss Alps are melting so rapidly that by2050, only one-quarter of the famous mountain ice will be left. The 2003 heat wave inEurope killed at least 20,000 people. If current computer modeling projections are correct,there won't even be cold winters in Europe by 2080. Summers will be hot and dry withperiodic violent storms of heavy rain and hail. New research by the Geological Survey of Greenland and Denmark published this monthreports that Greenland's ice cover is melting ten meters a year - that's about 33 feet - andTEN TIMES QUICKER than previously expected. Greenland has the largest ice sheet onland in the Northern Hemisphere. The Greenland study suggests that the rate of meltingcould become faster than the annual snowfall. Some of its ice is nearly two miles thick (1.9miles) and covers 772,000 square miles. If the Greenland ice continues to melt at itscurrent rapid rate, it will cause sea level rise and flooding around the planet.

Inan article published in the July 21, 2004, issue of Science, Bill Krabill, project scientist atthe NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, Virginia,reports that the frozen area around Greenland is thinning in some places at a rate of morethan three feet per year. Any change is important since a smaller ice sheet could result inhigher sea levels. \"A conservative estimate, based on our data, indicates a net loss ofapproximately 51 cubic kilometers of ice per year from the entire ice sheet, sufficient toraise global sea level by 0.005 inches per year, or approximately seven percent of theobserved rise,\" Krabill said.Warmer summers, milder winters, disappearing glaciers, rising seas, coastal flooding are notonly going to affect human populations. Global warming is already impacting birds aroundthe world more rapidly than expected. North Sea Kittiwakes Gulls.In England, the government monitors sea gulls called the \"kittiwakes\" to monitor the healthof its surrounding sea life. You might say the kittiwakes are like the canary in the cage thatminers use deep underground to monitor their air. Scientists monitoring bird populations inthe Shetlands and other islands say the number of kittiwakes gulls has declined 50% in thepast five years. Now, England's Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) reportsthat \"this year (2004) saw the worst ever (kittiwakes) breeding season in the nineteen yearssince monitoring began. The gulls have produced fewer young than in any previous year,apparently because of a severe shortage of food.\" The Head of Marine Policy at the RSPBsaid, \"We could well be seeing the single biggest change in the North Sea since it wasformed 10,000 years ago.\" Bird breeding problems go well beyond the kittiwakes. As farnorth as Shetland and Orkney, other birds such as terns and auks are having breedingproblems.

Over-fishing started thesandeel decline, but now global warming is an even bigger problem. Like dominoes falling,scientists think the food supply problem goes all the way down to ocean plankton whererising water temperatures are causing problems. Plankton is at the base of the ocean foodchain, so anything that affects plankton survival affects all sea life. If plankton moves todifferent sea temperatures - or dies out - then other sea life will have to move, or die out aswell. One American ornithologist has been studying the impact of global warming on birds and isworried that extinctions are going to rapidly increase. Dr. Jeff Price is Asst.

Jeff Price, Ph. D., Assistant Professor, Department of Geological and EnvironmentalSciences, California State University at Chico and Director, Climate Panel ImpactStudies for the American Bird Conservancy, Chico, California: \"We did findworldwide patterns of change that tie in very well with warming by latitude, especially inthe Northern Hemisphere. So you are seeing birds coming back earlier not all species butsome species."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Graphic showing that Blue-winged and Golden-winged Warblers have been seekinghigher average latitudes. Graphic © 2004 by Jeff Price, Ph.D. You're seeing changes in ranges of birds, changes in ranges of butterflies. You're seeingsome bird populations breeding earlier. So, there are a whole host of biological indicatorsthat show us that for the small amount of warming that has already occurred globally, weare seeing impacts on the Earth's environment. What worries a lot of scientists are exactlythe sorts of things that happened in the North Sea.THAT IS THE LACK OF BREEDING BY THOUSANDS OF BIRDS?In the case of the kittiwakes, it might or might not have had anything to do with the oceantemperature affecting the direct food resource of the kittiwakes. But instead, it could havebeen the temperatures being enough to impact the plankton. Then the changes in theplankton impact the sandeels and the changes in the sandeels affecting the kittiwakes.Those sorts of linkages are big sources of surprises. They are what we often call non-linearaffects and are the reasons that of the people who study these sorts of affects of climatechanges on ecosystems, why we all go: 'Whatever we say some of the models are going tobe right and some are going to be wrong but the impacts overall are certainly going to beworse than we think because we don't understand the linkages very well. They are thenon-linear surprises that come about.RIGHT, AND IN THE COMPUTER MODELING HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE BIGQUESTION THAT IF WARMING AFFECTED PLANKTON IN THE OCEANS ANDTHE PLANKTON EITHER DIED OR CHANGED THEIR POSITION, THEN LIKE ADOMINO EFFECT, IT COULD AFFECT THE FEEDING CHAIN ALL OVER THEPLACE IN WAYS THAT ONE COULD PREDICT AND IT APPEARS THAT ISALREADY BEGINNING TO HAPPEN IN 2004.I wouldn't put any money down if I were a betting person until I saw what happens in 2005or over the next ten years.But it's the sort of thing like the European summer and all of those people dying. It's thesort of thing that we're concerned about and the question is: What's the probability of itoccurring again? Global Mass Extinctions ProbableWHAT'S THE WORST CASE YOU THINK COULD HAPPEN IN THIS CENTURY ASGLOBAL WARMING CONTINUES IN THESE KINDS OF SHIFTS IN BIRDPOPULATIONS ARE FORCED TO KEEP CHANGING?Globally?YEAH, GLOBALLY.Globally, we are looking at many extinctions among birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"EVEN IF WE STOP CO2 PRODUCTION RIGHT NOW, WE WOULD STILL HAVE ACO2 BLANKET AROUND THIS PLANET THAT WOULD CONTINUE TO CAUSE AGLOBAL WARMING TREND FOR MANY DECADES TO COME?The longer we wait, the worse it is. You can't assume that just dealing with the problem isgoing to make this one go away. This isn't like acid rain. This isn't like ozone. There is a lagtime and short of developing a major technology that pulls CO2 out of the atmosphere there are some that might work we have this problem. From a natural ecosystem point ofview, it's going to continue to be a problem for much of this century.\" Bird Breeding Also Declining in Prairie PotholeRegion of North AmericaAnother ornithologist studying the impact of global warming on birds is Dr. Terry Root. Sheis a Senior Fellow at Stanford University's Institute for International Studies at the Centerfor Environmental Science and Policy and Professor of Biological Sciences. Dr. Rootgraduated from Princeton University in 1987 and has done a major study with Prof. Priceof 3000 scientific articles to see data about how plants and animals are being affected byglobal warming.Prof. Root found that spring events such as migration have occurred earlier by five daysper decade over the past thirty years. Bird species are moving up to higher elevations andmoving further north and south toward the poles. She has also found an overall decline inthe water fowl population in the prairie pothole breeding region of northern United Statesand Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Canada. In 2001, there were about 3 millionpairs of water fowl that bred there. Three years later, that number has already dropped toabout 2 million.Above: map of prairie pothole water fowl breeding regionof North and South Dakota and Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Canada.Be low: Aerial photograph of a prairie pothole breeding ground. Imagescourtesy U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).Terry Root, Ph.D., Senior Fellow, Stanford University's Institute for InternationalStudies at the Center for Environmental Science and Policy and Professor ofBiological Sciences, Palo Alto, California: \"If they can't breed in the prairie potholeregion, they over-fly it and go up to the Parklands in Canada. But, they are not able tobring off as many young in that habitat as they can in the prairie pot holes. So, yes there isgoing to be an overall decline in the population of water fowl.THIS ISSUE OF BREEDING AREAS WHERE BIRDS ARE FAILING TO BREED ISINCREASINGLY A SUBJECT IN THE SUMMER OF 2004. THIS HAS OCCURRED INTHE NORTH SEA. THIS HAS OCCURRED IN YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND. AND YOUHAVE JUST DESCRIBED ANOTHER EXAMPLE. MAYBE EVEN CHASE LAKE INNORTH DAKOTA FALLS INTO THIS CATEGORY FOR SOME REASON BECAUSEOF THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THOSE 29,000 PELICANS FOR A REASON THAT ISNOT CLEAR. THIS AFFECT ON THE BIRDS' INABILITY TO BREED, ORINTERRUPTION, THAT CAUSES THEM NOT TO BREED, COULD MEAN THAT ALOT OF SPECIES COULD DECLINE.That's right. The study I was telling you about was a projection for the future. This would"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"be in 2050. It hasn't happened thus far, but the possibility is there.WOULD THE BREEDING PROBLEMS IN YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND, AND THENORTH SEA REGION, BE THE FIRST SIGNS OF ONGOING BIRD DECLINES INTHE FACE OF GLOBAL WARMING?There certainly are changes being seen in all different taxa of species around the globe.The thing I'm most frightened about there are actually two things. One is that the warming,that species are going to react in very different ways to warming. So one species is going tobe moving northwest, one species is maybe going to be moving northeast; one species maynot be moving at all. So, what could happen is that the communities of predator and preyor the competition the species that are competing in these different communities thoseinteractions are going to be thrown off because the community is going to be torn apart.Some species will be moving and their prey may not be moving with them. That's going tobe very detrimental to the predator. If the predator moves out of the way, then the preycan increase in population and that can be very devastating to the population.In some situations, a bird will be feeding on a particular insect and that insect might beemerging earlier in the spring because it's warmer. But the bird is not arriving on migrationbecause instead of being triggered by warming, it's being triggered by day length. Thenwhen the bird gets there, the insects have all emerged and there is a dirth of prey for thebirds to eat. Mass Extinctions This Century?WITH THIS ISSUE OF THINGS CAREENING OUT OF BALANCE, WE DON'TREALLY KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING TO END UP BECAUSE WE HAVE NEVERBEEN IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS BEFORE AS HOMO SAPIENS.That's right because the change is so rapid. The species are having to adapt in such a fasttime period that we really don't know how they can adapt. The other thing that is going tohappen is that even if we stopped CO2 from being emitted now, we would still have a lotof sea level rise because of the heating of the water in the oceans.I think we are standing on the brink of a mass extinction event. I think the land mass isgoing to shrink because of the sea level coming up. It's going to be a very different place.We're going to have the climate of Oklahoma in Minnesota. So, obviously that's going tomake a big change to the people in Minnesota. And the people in Oklahoma are going tohave a climate that is more similar to that in Mexico.\"Website:http://www.eea.eu.int/main_htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
