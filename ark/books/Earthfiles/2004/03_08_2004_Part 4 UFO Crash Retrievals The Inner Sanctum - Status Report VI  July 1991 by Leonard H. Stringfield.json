LeonardStringfield died on December 18, 1994. Len Stringfield - continued: Following are Tim's flight entries in his log for July 1947: \"July 4, 1947 DEH (C.A.A. station designation for Roswell) Ship 6291. B-29.Formation flight cross-country. Vicksburg, Little Rock, Tulsa, Amarillo and return.Holiday celebration. Flight time 9 hrs. 55 mins. July 9, 1947 DEH, Ship 7301. B-29. Cross country. Ft. Worth and return. Flight time1 hr., 55 mins. The next 17 days, Tim said, he and crew were in special training school featuringcourses in Russian language, Judo, hand-to-hand combat, etc. July 26, 1947 DEH, Ship 430? (last number illegible). B-29. Cross country roundrobin to Atlanta and return via Houston. 10 hrs. 20 mins. July 28, 1947 DEH, Ship 6291. B-29. Cross country radar bombing. Omaha, KansasCity, Houston and return. Flight time, 11 hrs. 20 mins. July 29, 1947 DEH Ship 6291. B-29. Formation over Utah, live bombing. Flight time8 hrs., 45 mins.\"The Key Date: July 9, 1947. For one thing it backed up the scenario that Marcel had returned to Roswell on Tim's flight.But, July 8 and 9 were days of other dramatic events linked to his July 9th flight to Ft.Worth. During this period, a special detachment of 509th personnel from Roswell foundfour alien bodies about two and a half miles from the crash-site on the Brazel ranch. In the short run, however, the exotic cadavers had to be protected under maximumsecurity, preserved, photographed and crated for shipment out of Roswell. By theafternoon of July 9, while preparing them at the base hospital, a local mortician, GlennDennis, had been consulted about techniques used for hermetic sealing of a casket forfrozen body remains. Hermetic or not, once crated, they boarded Tim's flight to Ft. Worth.Final destination, probably Wright-Patterson AFB. \"Everything about the flight was unusual,\" said Tim. \"We flew at an unusually low leveland so tight was security, we knew that the crate contained more than the general'sfurniture.\" It was made of wood, he said and was unpainted and unmarked as thoughhastily constructed. Fitting snugly into the bomb-bay, its approximate size: 5 ft. high, 4 ft.wide and about 15 ft. long. Beyond the suspicious cargo requiring extraordinary security measures at Roswell and Ft."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Worth, the strongest factor to support Tim's belief that his plane carried the bodies is in thehappenstance of a fellow crew member, Captain FM, who recognized a former schoolchum among the contingent of greeters at Ft. Worth - a mortician! Tim remembers FM'scomment, \"We are now a part of history.\" I was in frequent touch with Tim by phone and by mail as we tried to resurrect, through hisrecall, more details of his experiences and observations and to make his \"historic\" flight fitinto the whole Roswell fabric of events. As more and more people with Roswell connections were surfacing and willing to \"gopublic,\" the Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR), a Washington, D. C.-based non-profiteducational organization, emerged with a plan to do just that - go public! According to anannouncement by Fred Whiting, the group's public relations consultant, a meeting would beheld in Washington for one and all to attend for on-camera \"depositions.\" I was dulynotified to bring my source, namely Time, and that all expenses would be paid. I liked theidea and so did Tim who would bring along his son. Eventually a date was set in July 1990. But suddenly, there were signs of strangeness. For one, I had requested of Tim that he sendme copies of his diary pages which logged his B-29 flights out of Roswell. The packagenever arrived nor was it returned to his given address. During the same time period, Tim gotan inordinate number of pestering phone calls, some from sales people wanting todemonstrate their wares in his home which in his state is against the law. Already disturbed by this abnormal invasion of his privacy, Tim recounted another incidentby letter of June 20, 1990, which we both agreed delivered a \"message,\" quoted in part asfollows: \"My second (suspicious call) was in the mid-morning and it went through the usualspiel of solicitation and back-slapping. It was a woman and I caught only her firstname, Andrea, and something about a museum of technology. She aid she wascompiling a series of combat crew stories from USAF units in SAC from 1946 to1953 during the piston engine era. She was aware that I had written and publishedsome stories in Western Flyer. She wanted to know if I could help her with an articleon the B-52 bomber. At that point, I felt it was time to be careful. I told her I hadnever flown in the B-52. She said, 'Oh, well, perhaps you have some interestingstories of other types. How about the B-29s?' \"I became sure that I wanted no part of whatever she was up to. I said it would taketime to come up with something and asked her to give me an address to which Icould mail in a synopsis. Then I said, 'I charge eight cents a word.' She then said thatit would be better to just discuss it over the phone since my information might not bewhat she could use anyway. I told her I did not work that way and asked to speak toher boss. She hung up.\" Some sinister force in the shadows seemed to be closing in on Tim. The purpose was stillvague, but I, too, felt that the \"Andrea\" call was one more link in a plan to make Tim thinktwice about his role in Roswell affairs. Bewildered and feeling concern for his family, Timcanceled plans to go to Washington. The main gathering in Washington, D. C. and subsequent meetings in the United States ofRoswell-connected people in the summer of 1990 were a success. The on-camera\"depositions\" were impressive and credit must go to the Fund for UFO Research for a jobwell done. I called Fred Whiting and told him that I had plans to get Tim aboard later andhe assured me that the expenses to meet him privately would be covered. When I checked with Tim later, he said that the \"invasion\" of weird calls had abated and,yes, he would consider meeting me in Cincinnati. Reaching Don Schmitt, he also agreedand, yes, he might encourage others still willing to go on camera to join in. The date was setfor September 14, 15, and 16, 1990. But the same shadow that I assumed guided Andrea, somehow knew my plans forCincinnati; this time the voice that called Tim at 10:45 a.m. on August 15, 1990, went bythe name of Vard Jacobsen. Identifying himself as a member of the American News ReleaseSyndicate and boasting that he had been published in several electronic \"journals,\"including the Allegheny Review, Jacobsen said that he was looking for writers like Tim tocontribute an article on electronics. Tim was quick to relate that he was no expert inelectronics and his knowledge was limited to processing electrical equipment in a largewell-known firm. Tim also told Jacobsen that he had a \"gimmick\" patented in his line ofwork by that company. Jacobsen's response, 'You're just who we're looking for!' Then,according to Tim, he said that he was aware of a person named 'Hall,' who into UFOs wrotean article on electronics and that he knew a general who worked at White Sands and thencame the clincher. He would be in Tim's city on September 14th through the 16th to talk"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"business. 'We should get along very well,' was Jacobsen's final comment. On August 21, 1990, Tim wrote me the following letter, quoted in part: \"...Things we have discussed on the phone (proposed meetings) are suddenly inpublic domain, or so it seems. That is, unless you are a close friend of Vard Jacobsen.After his call, I sought advice from a person who has reason to know and he told meto back off from any and all commitments and gave some good reasons. He issympathetic to our beliefs, but strong in his opinion that in my case, it is best to saynothing, particularly right now. ...I think we, you and I, plus others are getting tooclose to somebody's cookie jar. ...Anyway for the time being, I must withdraw fromthe search. I will not make the trip.\" The voice of Vard Jacobsen was real, but his credentials were phony and his plan to visitTim o September 14-16, 1990, was a calculated lie. Jacobsen somehow knew by a buggedphone or by some intelligence grapevine that the dates July 14, 15 and 16, 1990 were thosethat Schmitt and I had arranged to meet in Cincinnati. In retrospect, once when Schmitt and Randle visited my home to update our findings onRoswell, I dialed Tim's phone number (which I kept confidential) to allow Schmitt to getfirsthand answers to his own set of questions. This was my gesture of sharing to build atwo-way trust and to establish the fact I didn't invent Tim. But, to be paranoid for amoment, sometimes sharing sensitive information on the phone can also be bugged which Isuspect might have happened on that day we talked with Tim. Att that time, Tim was a key,pivotal figure who knew the names of others on an important flight from Roswell. Reaching Tim that day, his first response was to relate that he got a chilling call a few daysearlier from an anonymous male source who curiously addressed him by his formal firstname, but one he rarely ever used in normal daily life. Curtly, he asked, \"Are youinterested in the Roswell case?\" Tim said he acknowledged his interest, admitting that hewas stationed there when the story of the crash was news. The phantom caller then advisedthat he check on the military policeman involved in the case who committed suicide sixmonths later. Were others in Tim's flight affected by phantoms? The wife of one in El Paso, Texas,tracked down by Schmitt, refused to discuss her husband's 509th activities when KevinRandle called. I called later, telling her that I knew a close friend of her late husband (who- she admitted - had passed away six months earlier.) Her angry answer: \"I don't care todiscuss his activity with you or anyone else.\" Bang (down went the phone)! Later after locating the bombardier, FM - the officer who had dubbed the flight as\"historic\" - I asked Tim to follow-up. According to his log, he called five times and finallyon the sixth try, a young lady answered and questioned if he had the right number. Tim didnot give his name, saying only that he wished to talk with his old friend with whom he hadserved in the 509th. Abruptly the voice said, \"No,\" and she hung up. The names of all the crew members aboard Tim's flight that he can recall are known to me,which I gave to Don Schmitt. In our cooperative efforts, Don offered the ways and meansto track the names down to their current status and location. Most were deceased, includingthe pilot who died in a plane crash two years after Roswell. One crew member, however,willing and able and so far unbothered, was reached by Schmitt, Randle and me. He wasthe B-29's gunner, Staff Sergeant Bob Slusher. Slusher's recall of the secret flight to Ft. Worth was our bonanza. He remembered all theimportant details: the wood crate in the bomb-bay, its size (which conformed to Tim'sestimates), the tight security at Roswell and Ft. Worth, and even the vivid scene in Ft.Worth of the bombardier, FM, meeting his old school pal among the official greeters - themortician. \"I can still see them,\" he said, \"shaking hands and hugging.\" Slusher also remembers Major Jesse Marcel being aboard his B-29's return flight to Roswellon same date, July 9,1947. \"No doubt about it,\" he told me. \"Jesse Marcel was on ourplane. He spent most of his time in the cockpit.\" Needless to say, a secret crate, a mortician to greet it on July 9, 1947, are each on its ownmerit strong evidence to support the belief that a B-29, #7301, transported the(non-human) cadavers to Ft. Worth, Texas from Roswell, New Mexico.Continued in Part 5.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
