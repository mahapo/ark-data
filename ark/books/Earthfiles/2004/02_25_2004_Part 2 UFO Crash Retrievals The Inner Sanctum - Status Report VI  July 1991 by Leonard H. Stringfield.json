Len Stringfield - continued: Cloak and Dagger Drama at MUFON Conference,Dayton, Ohio, July 29, 1978 After a brief interlude with TV newsmen for a prearranged interview and stillunder heavy guard, I was taken to my room. Before I could order a sandwich, Iwas told that I was being transferred to another room. Out went my luggage andin came a lady's wardrobe on a pushcart. Fast work, indeed. Before one of theplainclothesmen departed, he advised, \"Stay in your room until notified.\" Minutes later, I was visited by my friend with the CIA connection. Concerned bythe threats, he phoned his contact and was reminded that he had been advisedthere would be trouble. No further explanation. About 15 minutes later, anothervisitor with official credentials joined by a known friend in research, requested acopy of my paper and the tape of the UFO crash witness. Still later, I learnedthat one of my medical informants, associated with the doctor who hadperformed an autopsy on an alien body, came to my vacated room and left anote under the door which was never delivered. After more than two hours, hungry, and flustered by my isolation, I left my roomto join my friends. Speculation about the events of that day, July 29, 1978, (atthe MUFON conference) was at a high-pitch - without answers. Later in the evening, I happenchanced to meet J. Allen Hynek in the men'sroom. I remember my comment: \"Well, I did it for better or for worse; what'snext?\" He replied cryptically, \"It's like the inexorable flush of a toilet; you'renow committed.\" Several days after the Dayton experience, I learned fro the CIA person in theusual indirect manner, \"If Stringfield had said certain things about crash andretrievals, Hynek would have taken over.\" I tried to find out more, but withoutsuccess. Many questions to this day remain unanswered about the events of that day Iformally introduced UFO crash/retrievals to research. Mainly, who was theculprit who made the threats? Was he a loner with a mental problem? Or a\"plant\" from the Inner Sanctum's special goon squad? But what of the advanced warning by the CIA person who predicted \"trouble?\"Were \"they\" fearful that I would make some sensitive disclosures? But if thatwere the case, why had they not taken stronger measures to prevent me from"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"presenting my paper before I went to Dayton? Or why had they not told meabout the threats on my life before I went on stage, hoping that such a tacticmight scare me into a senseless silence? And who was the lady that was willing to change her room to mine at Stouffers?Was she informed of the reason for the change? And if she did know, did shehave any qualms about the danger of being bombed? And what did she do withthe note addressed to me that was put under the door? She certainly knew herold room number which was room #1210. Very strange unless she, too, was apart of an orchestration. To speculate further, were the threats and subsequent Dayton police action andthe assignment of a personal bodyguard to watch my every move day and nightuntil my departure, a window-dressing stunt perpetrated for a longer rangepurpose on orders from the orchestraters - or shall we say, the Inner Sanctum?Was it all a means of intimidation to scare me out of crash/retrieval research? Ofnote, there were more threats to follow me at my home in Cincinnati. Twice Igot phone calls from a low monotone voice warning me that I would die if Icontinued my research. Also, I had received two postal cards from ananonymous source in New York with drawings of a human skull and crossedbones - in red ink yet. The messages were brief: Get out of the UFO business! And now, for a little speculation on the lighter side - away from the cloak anddagger kind of mischief. After the disturbance, I recall that rumors were rife thatthe threats could have been a caper pulled of which got out of hand by one ormore buffoons within the local sponsoring group, the Ohio UFO investigativeLeague (OUFOIL). Several researchers who were present point out that theybelieved part of the plan to stir up controversy might have been demonstrated byone of the OUFOIL's members who paraded around the auditorium dressed likea little green man. In summary, the case is closed. It is now history. But apart from all of its spookyaspects, I'll always wonder why Hynek got to Dayton ahead of schedule and willalso wonder about the remark made by the CIA contact that Hynek was there torespond to any of my 'hot stuff' disclosures. Apparently, I didn't have the hotstuff. Through the course of time, I had several occasions to meet privately withHynek - once at his home and once at mine. Whenever he came to Cincinnati onbusiness or to visit a \"favorite\" aunt in my city. Our main subject:crash/retrievals. He wanted names and details. I gave details but no names,insisting that I could not compromise the identity of my sources who, for theirown security, preferred anonymity. At restaurants, he would often acquiescewith an understanding nod and then stare down at his plate in long silence.Perhaps he gave thought to his own position relating to sensitive matters. I recallseveral times that I asked about a UFO military case and got no reply. Whatever was behind Hynek's zeal to get crash/retrieval information, he alwaysmaintained in my company the aplomb of a diplomat. His warmth and wit wereindeed winsome. Astronomer J. Allen Hynek and Project Sphinx In June 1980, I released The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome, Status Report IIwhich was a continuum of witness reports from new sources, including a letter Ihad received under special conditions from a medical informant who describedthe alien anatomy. Published by MUFON, to whom I had relinquished itsfinancial proceeds, it got good reviews in friendly quarters and according toMUFON Director, Walt Andrus, got brisk sales. When Hynek received a copy of the galley proofs, he called to extend hiscompliments for a \"job well done;\" but again, he lamented the fact that mycredibility was suffering by not releasing names of my sources. And once again, I"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"felt cornered. My voice probably echoed my reluctance to even discuss theissue. But he tried to ease my discomfort. In his diplomatic manner, hewondered if there might be a \"discretionary\" way that could be handled to thesatisfaction of the sources and myself. He hinted at some possibilities andpromised to be in touch soon. A few weeks later, he called again. This time heoffered his concept of a discretionary plan that would basically providecredence to my anonymous witnesses, especially when I faced the media or wasinterviewed on radio or TV talk shows. According to the plan which I dubbed Project Sphinx, Hynek would beprivileged to know the names of my C/R sources and their full disclosures. Thekey to its success, he stated, would rest on the integrity of a third party whowould be included in the \"know all, see all\" plan. To my surprise, he named oneof the most renowned of astronauts and, lo and behold, according to plan, Icould refer to his name during interviews as having knowledge of any and all ofmy anonymous sources. According to Hynek, the astronaut had alreadyreviewed the galley proofs of my new status report and would reply in duecourse. The full disclosure papers, said Hynek, would be stored in a vault of aCincinnati bank with access limited only to the three persons named. Alas,credibility! Needless to say, I was honored. And needless to say, I felt a choking sensationwondering what the reaction would be to the offer from some of my moresensitive and trusting sources. I had already a sample of a negative responsewhen I requested an affidavit from an Air Force officer who had witnessesfirsthand three alien bodies at Wright-Patterson AFB in 1953. When I asked fora posthumous statement, his response was that he would have to check with hissecurity officer. The terse answer: \"You have seen nothing, heard nothing, andyou sure as shit can sign nothing.\" Even in a more sensitive position were the medical specialists: one was ahematologist who had performed an autopsy on an alien body in the early1950s. The other, his colleague, was a biochemist who had studied specimensunder glass. It took almost a year of \"negotiations\" with them before I couldobtain a \"cleared\" statement on the alien anatomy for publication in my TheUFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome and, knowing little or nothing about the depthof their secret work, how could I present a case for them to compromise theirpositions? To this day, I am not in the clear to disclose the name of the hospitalin which they worked or even the name of the city in which it is located. Tobreach this trust could jeopardize the safety of myself, the two doctors andothers who have counted on my allegiance. I expected some restless daysawaiting word from Hynek to get the astronaut's answer and to ponder myresponse. Project Sphinx failed. It never got off the ground. Hynek called and relatedreluctantly that the astronaut had new and demanding obligations in anotherstate and did not wish to get involved in the proposed program. Hynek alsomentioned that the astronaut had some reservations about some of the cases inthe status report, which I could understand as I, too, was aware of somequestionable items. Unfortunately, I'll never know any of the specific cases ordetails that he held in \"reservation\" or those which he believed to be acceptable.I do know that Hynek and the astronaut were friends and got together on fishingtrips. I also know from other sources that the astronaut did get involved in abusiness venture and changed his place of residence. Pilot Carl Madeley's UFO Information Going back to Project Blue Book days when Hynek provided conventionalanswers to explain away UFO sightings, I cite evidence that he was involved inthe investigation of UFO incidents of greater significance than a hovering lightthat suddenly shot away at fantastic speed. One case in point is a taped interviewby John Lear in 1987 with pilot Carl Madeley who described his closeencounter with a bright red ovoid object about 50 feet in diameter while flying"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"enroute from Houston to Las Vegas in 1967. When I called Madeley forconfirmation and details, he said the object that paced his Lear jet over Arizonawas confirmed by radar at the Albuquerque and the Los Angeles Air TrafficCenters. Each advised that they were monitoring his flight and the UFOs. Helater learned that the captain of a National Airlines DC-8 had also witnessed theobject. Madeley said that the object turned green during its acceleration towardthe Pacific Ocean where it disappeared. According to Madeley, a scientist friend reported the incident to Dr. Hynek whoflew to his home in Texas for a debriefing. Of note, Hynek included Madeley'sencounter in his book, The UFO Experience (see pages 82 and 83). Did A UFO Cause the Aurora 7 Panic WhenAstronaut Scott Carpenter Was \"Lost\" on May 24, 1962? During the interrogation, Madeley said that Hynek told him that on one ofthe Gemini two-man space missions, the craft was paced by a UFO for oneentire orbit forcing the astronauts to abort their flight near the Grand TurkIsland in the Caribbean. (Note from Linda Howe - See More Informationbelow: Did the UFO Pace Aurora 7 Flown by Astronaut Scott Carpenteron May 24, 1962?) Debriefed by astronomer J. Allen Hynek who was flown by the USAF tothe rescue aircraft carrier, one astronaut was in a near state of panic. Thismisadventure, of course, was never revealed publicly. According to Hynek,said Madeley, there was fear that the public would panic if all the factsabout UFOs were made known. He also told Madeley that although hecould not prove it, the belief in official circles was that the UFO came fromouter space and he named several star systems as likely candidates oforigin. \"They're way ahead of us in technology,\" said Madeley, quotingHynek, who compared them (non-humans) to us when we view themonkeys at the zoo. In retrospect, Dr. Hynek throughout our relationship - since he institutedthe Center for UFO Studies (now The J. Allen Hynek Center for UFOStudies, CUFOS), has posed a few puzzlements for me. However, despiterumors of his implication in undercover work for the U. S. Air Force, orthe CIA, I personally have no evidence to suggest that he was, or that heinterfered with my C/R work. In fact, on one occasion when I made theremark that my work in the C/R sector was not really research in its purest,clinical sense compared to the urgent study of abductions, he replied,\"Indeed, your research is very important.\" On the other hand, while attending a CUFOS conference in Chicago, hedid remind me that the notoriety given to my claim of alien bodies storedat Wright-Patterson AFB haunted him wherever he made a publicappearance. At the same conference, one of his close associates took measide privately to relate that I \"take under advisement\" the seriousdistractions my work had caused to the operations of CUFOS. Heparticularly cited a set of photos showing alleged alien bodies inside aglass case that I had announced having in my possession at the MUFONSymposium I attended in 1980 in Houston, Texas. Looking only briefly ata set which I brought with me, he concluded they were fakes. I agreed thatthey probably were, but in my opinion they deserved further analysis. Ifurther explained that I was investigating not only the genuineness of thephotos, but other material I had received from the same sources. It was notlong after our meeting that I concluded that the tainted photos were a \"partand parcel\" of a well-orchestrated disinformation ploy. If they were givento me to \"muddy the waters\" of research or to discredit me, they werecertainly successful - at least for a brief period. More on this photobusiness later in this status report."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"On still another occasion, Hynek made the point - and I think myquotation is reasonably accurate: \"You, Len, can say whatever you wishabout crashed alien UFOs publicly, but I can't. I'm a scientist. I'd be aninstant outcast in my profession if I came out in the open in your support.\" My last interchange with Hynek was February 8, 1984, when he and I wereguests on the Allen Hendelman radio talk show out of Raleigh, NorthCarolina. When Hynek was asked for a comment on my C/R work, he said,\"Len is a careful, assiduous and extremely honest man. There are manystraws in the wind to back him up, but I do wish he weren't such anhonorable person so that he would release names to make his storiescredible.\" To me, Dr. Hynek was a kind, perspicacious, witty, well-spoken and adroitscientist. The people who pulled the strings in the Inner Sanctum knewthose virtues (in him), too. In his passing in 1986, Hynek's last words reputedly on the subject towhich he was so dedicated officially and at CUFOS were an expression ofdisappointment. He felt that he had been \"used\" without ever being toldthe truth behind the cover-up. There is a commonality in the feeling ofbeing \"used\" in this business.More Information:\"...On one of the Gemini two-man space missions, the craft was paced bya UFO for one entire orbit forcing the astronauts to abort their flightnear the Grand Turk Island in the Caribbean. Debriefed by astronomerJ. Allen Hynek who was flown by the USAF to the rescue aircraft carrier,one astronaut was in a near state of panic. This misadventure, of course,was never revealed publicly.\"Is This UFO Incident the Truth Behind the Aurora 7 PanicWhen Astronaut Scott Carpenter Was \"Lost\" on May 24,1962? Astronaut Scott Malcolm Carpenter, the second American to go into orbitalflight around the Earth, following John Glenn, on May 24, 1962. There was a problemand he ended up landing near Turks Island far from the intended return site.

They celebrated the arrival of a visitor wholiterally came from Outer Space.Without the Missile Tracking Station on the 6 12 by 1 mile island of GrandTurk, NASA may never have known that John Glenn was still alive after beingthe first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. It was from here that the heartrates and positions of the astronauts John Glenn in Friendship 7 and ScottCarpenter in Aurora 7 later that year were monitored. It is an excellent exampleof how seemingly small places can play big roles in history. A history that stillcaptures imagination all over the world."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"To celebrate the 40th anniversary of this momentous occasion - one of thebiggest moments of history - the Turks and Caicos Islanders planned a series ofevents. Many people still remember the day when everyone waited 'splashdown'.John Glenn liked where he had landed though, just off the coast of the islandthat forms the capital of this 40-island country at the southeastern end of theBahamian archipelago. John Glenn's Friendship 7 Space Flight February 20, 1962During John Glenn's mission the recovery area was nicknamed \"Area Hotel\" andduring his second orbit Glenn reported \"This is Friendship 7, checking down inArea Hotel on the weather, and it looks good down that way. Looks like we'llhave no problem on recovery\" to which Grissom in Bermuda responded \"Ve r ygood. We'll see you in Grand Turk\". After landing and being brought to GrandTurk there were various press releases and in one Robert Voas, Mercury TrainingOfficer, recalled Glenn's account of returning in \"a shooting star\". Glenn,traveling admittedly by rather non-traditional means, was pleased with what hesaw during the mission saying \"I don't know what you can say about a day whenyou see four beautiful sunsets, three in orbit and one on the surface\".It is true that the sunsets over the islands, especially the green flash that visitorsand locals claim to have seen just before the sun descends below the turquoisehorizon are truly spectacular. Thanks to technology and good business sense,tourists can see sunsets here without the need of a space rocket of any kind asseveral major airlines have been quick to invest in this fast-growing popular andun-spoilt destination. U. S. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson ArrivesJohn Glenn stayed in Grand Turk for only three days but even he got a taste ofthe warm welcome that visitors still enjoy today. When the US Vice Presidentarrived at 4 a.m. to take John Glenn home, a large part of the population waswaiting for him at the airport and greeted him with great enthusiasm in spite ofthe early hour. The records state \"Of all the receptions which the Vice-Presidentand the astronaut were later to receive, perhaps none would be smaller butcertainly none would be warmer or more sincere that that given by the peopleof Grand Turk on their departure in the early morning of 23 February.\" Scott Carpenter's Aurora 7 Space Flight on May 24, 1962 -What Really Happened?\"This trip proved more controversial because Carpenter had seemed tolose concentration as he re-entered the Earth's atmosphere. ... Ondescending, his capsule, Aurora 7, overshot the pickup area by 250nautical miles (463 km) causing nationwide concern for his safety....While the world's media began endless debates about his health andstate of mind, Scott, alive and well, came to Grand Turk for full medicalchecks.\" Grand Turk would not be content with only one moment of fame. Months laterScott Carpenter missed his assigned landing spot by 250 miles and ended upright back in Grand Turk, where John Glenn it would seem was only too pleasedto join him.This trip proved more controversial because Carpenter had seemed to loseconcentration as he re-entered the Earth's atmosphere. While in Grand Turkpeople knew he was alive and well thanks to the Tracking Station at Colonel"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Murray's Hill (now known by locals as Nookie Hill), the rest of the World,indeed over 65 million TV viewers were left on tenterhooks about his fate fornearly 50 minutes after hearing that the capsule had not landed where intended.While the world's media began endless debates about his health and state ofmind, Scott, alive and well, came to Grand Turk for full medical checks. Other Astronauts Join Scott Carpenter On Grand TurkFellow Mercury Astronauts John Glenn, Walter Schirra, Virgil Grissom andLeroy Gordon Cooper, joined Scott Carpenter during his debriefing on GrandTurk: Slayton was in Australia for the flight and was being flown directly to theUSA to meet up with the others at Patrick Air Force Base. In fact shortly afterhis arrival on Grand Turk, just past midnight, Glenn and Schirra greetedCarpenter and then sat talking with him until 3.30 a.m. Carpenter apologized tothe World Media and his family about giving them a 'cliff hanger,' but this wasput down to the fact that Mercury Control, who knew that the craft had landedand Carpenter was alive after only a few minutes, had not told the waitingmedia.His landing successfully and 'fortuitously' according to the newspaperinterrupted a Legislative Assembly meeting and so the Governor, His ExcellencySir Kenneth Blackburne, and members of the meeting were able to meet ScottCarpenter, John Glenn and other members of the astronaut team. In Grand Turkhe was soon given a clean bill of health and the world's media were informedthat the astronaut was not tired in fact 'quite the opposite.' Scott claimed that thetrip did not go to plan as instruments failed and fuel ran out. The astronaut hadbeen forced to control the capsule manually and override systems in order toland safely. A fact that led John Glenn to state later 'perhaps difficulty mayactually have been a blessing in disguise, because it showed that when he has toa man can take over control of various systems operate manually and still knowwhat he's doing.'In spite of the public outcry in the United States that Carpenter had been too illor too tired to land correctly, the examiners in Grand Turk were so pleased withthe results of their health checks that they stated, rather prophetically, that theycould now consider extending manned Space flights beyond 3 orbits. So it couldbe said that the information recorded in Grand Turk helped shape the future ofspace travel.\"Continued in Part 3.
