July 22, 2004 Stockholm, Sweden - Lloyd Jones reporting for Australia's Herald Sun inStockholm began a dispatch today: \"Homing pigeons vanish during race. Organisers of a race for homing pigeonswere still scratching their heads in wonder today after about 1500 of the birds,famous for their ability to find their way home, went missing during the contest.\" Usually it takes the pigeons only two hours to return to their home lofts. But a member ofthe Malmoe Homing Pigeon Club, Lars-Aake Nilsson, said only about 500 of the 2000pigeons flown in the contest have returned after the 150 kilometer flight between the citiesof Ljungby and Malmoe in southern Sweden. \"The weather was perfect - no rain, nothunder and no strong winds,\" he said. Mr. Nilsson and other homing pigeon raisers wonder if changes in the earth's magnetic fieldcould be the culprit. Homing pigeons use the sun and magnetic fields of the earth tonavigate. So far, none of the missing homing pigeons have turned up anywhere in southernSweden. \"I have worked with pigeons since 1960 and have never experienced anything likethis,\" Mr. Nilsson said. \"It's a mystery.\" Back on October 5, 1998, the same kind of disappearance happened in two Americanhoming pigeon races. In one, about 1,600 pigeons vanished out of 1,800 competing in a200-mile race from northern Virginia to Allentown, Pennsylvania. The same day, 600 outof 700 birds were missing after a 150-mile race from western Pennsylvania to Philadelphia. 29,000 American White Pelicans Disappear On May 28, 2004, the Bismarck, North Dakota office of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Servicebegan hearing that American White Pelicans were disappearing from the Chase LakeNational Wildlife Refuge north of Medina, North Dakota. Two and a half weeks later,29,000 pelicans wre gone without a trace. See 06/17/04 Earthfiles. American White Pelicans.Photograph by U. S.

On July 15, 2004, the director general of Tanzania, Afria's National Parks (Tanapa), GeraldBigurube reported: \"The death of more than 10,000 flamingoes in Lake Manyara is a realtragedy and we are still puzzled with the cause and nature of the mysterious disease thathas struck these beautiful creatures.\" The suspicion is that there is something wrong withthe lake water and flamingo carcasses have been sent to the Leibniz Institute of FreshWater Ecology and Inland Fisheries in Berlin, Germany, for laboratory testing. Since July 13th, California media have reported \"an unusually high number of Californiabrown pelicans are washing up on local shores weak, dehydrated and near death.\" Wildlifeofficials are puzzled about why the endangered pelican is starving to death during anabundant yeaar of anchovies which pelicans normally thrive upon. Judy St. Leger, aveterinarian at San Diego's SeaWorld aquatic animal park told Reuters, \"They are starving,but we do think there are plenty of anchovies. It is an unusual and very extraordinaryevent.\" North American Duck Population Declines 11 Percent Mallard ducks in United States.Photograph © by Leslie Day. The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Canadian Wildlife Service reported this month thatthe duck population in the United States and Canada has dropped 11 percent in one year,largely linked to drought that has dried up water in duck breeding grounds.

Surveys carried out by the European Bird Census Council, Birdlife International and the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"UK's Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) in 11 European Union MemberStates, five accession countries and Norway and Switzerland, reveal that the numbers oftwenty-four of Europe's most familiar bird species have fallen by one third in just a quarterof a century. Across the continent and especially in northwest Europe, where the most intensiveagricultural methods are practiced, birds such as skylarks, lapwings and yellowhammers arein decline, the report reveals. The declines pinpointed by the report are most alarming inintensive farming countries such as the UK, where, between 1970 and 1999, skylarknumbers declined by 52 per cent, the yellowhammer by 53 per cent and the corn buntingby 88 per cent. More Information: Viewers Reports\"Dear Linda:I think that there is a lot more going on with birds than anyone knows, only on a moresubtle level. I live in central Texas and was very surprised a couple of days ago to see asmall flock of robins in our neighborhood park. I walk everyday and have a goodfamiliarity with most of the birds in this part of Texas, so I know them when I see them.Typically, robins spend there winters down this way, then leave in the early spring and headback north. I have never seen a robin in the summer before two days ago. I guess it couldjust be a fluke, and that some robins just decided to stay on for our wonderfully pleasantsummer weather (not!).As for the missing birds, they have to be somewhere, which is the real puzzle. Where didthey end up?Best wishes,Darlene Grymkoski, Texas\"\"To start off I am no expert but, I was wondering if anybody has tried tolink these bird mysteries with the recent solar flare activities from thesun. I read on a nasa website that there has been some unusally large solarflares in the past year.On a side note, I have been living in my home for 30 years and this year,for the first time, there seems to be very large numbers of small birds(robins, backbirds,etc..) in my homes trees... at night they number in theupper hundreds and this past weekend there were so many birds in myneighbors tree that it actually fell down ( a weeping willow ) ... I havealso noticed the drop in ducks too... every year we used to get ducks in theback yard and this year we saw very few mallardsThanks for the great website that seems very non-biased,Michael Delisi, Illinois\"Websites:http://www.audubon.org/http://www.waterbirds.org/http://www.nmnh.si.edu/BIRDNET/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
