In 2002 and 2003, the average rise in the amount of CO2 inthe Earth's atmosphere rose from about 1.5 parts per million by volume to as much as 2.54ppm. Some atmospheric scientists worry that such a sudden and rapid increase ingreenhouse CO2 is linked to rising global temperatures. If the CO2 continues to increaserapidly for the next five to ten years, it could mean that even the soil of our planet iswarming to the point that it more easily releases carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. A scientist who has been studying the release of greenhouse gases to the Earth'satmosphere and their sources for nearly two decades is Kim Holmen, Ph.D., SeniorScientist at the Polar Environmental Center in the Norwegian Institute for Air Research inTromso, Norway. Dr. Holmen told me this week, \"In the Northern Hemisphere, there is astorage of carbon in soils (that can oxidize to CO2 gas) which is at least three times aslarge as the total atmospheric content of CO2.\" Interview:Kim Holmen, Ph.D., Senior Scientist, Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NIAR),Polar Environmental Center, Tromso, Norway: \"I have been measuring carbon dioxideand methane and other climatically active species (of gases) on Svalbard (Spitsbergen) inthe Arctic. Scientists around the world have been measuring CO2 in the atmosphere since1957. From this, we know that the increase rate has been around just above 1 part permillion per year for most of this time period. There are some fluctuations around thisvalue, some due to changes in man's habits. For example, the oil crisis in the early 1970sgave a slight decrease in the CO2 increase rate.Above: Map of Svalbard, also known as Island of Spitsbergen, where Norw egian scientist,Kim Holmen, has monitored greenhouse gases for nearly tw o decades.

We've had unusually high increased rate of CO2 the past two years and it is likelydue to changes in the biosphere (plants, trees and soil) in northern Russia and Europe andprobably also Canada, but we don't know the exact reason for the changes.WHAT'S THE HYPOTHESIZED REASONS FOR THIS CHANGE?We have several mixed phenomena occurring. One is as simple that some of the releases ofCO2, fossil fuel carbon dioxide, have gone up. For example, we have a dramatic expansionof fossil fuel use in China at the moment. But more importantly are changes in temperatureand precipitation over Russia, Siberia and possibly also the unusually warm summer inEurope during last summer.DOES THAT MEAN THIS INCREASE IN C02 THAT YOU ARE MEASURING ISDIRECTLY LINKED TO AN INCREASE IN GLOBAL TEMPERATURE?The hypothesis is that there is such a tie, yes. This is my personal main line of thinking thatthere is a clear link. We know from ice cores that there is a link between the atmosphericCO2 concentration and temperature. One of the reasons for concern is that if man thenincreases the Earth's temperature through our release of fossil fuels, Nature might respondby releasing more CO2 yet again into the atmosphere, thus causing an acceleratingphenomenon. (\"Runaway Greenhouse.\")MEANING THAT THE EARTH WOULD SOME HOW START RELEASING EVENMORE CO2 IN RESPONSE TO...?A temperature increase.THE WARMER IT GETS, THE MORE CO2 THE EARTH COULD RELEASE. WHATWOULD HAPPEN?What would happen? The atmospheric CO2 content depends upon the balance betweenphotosynthesis and respiration. Every summer, plants take up a lot of carbon dioxidewhich is then released during the fall and winter back to the atmosphere. That natural fluxback and forth between biosphere and atmosphere is much larger than man's consumptionof fossil fuel. However, they balance each other and it's changes contributed by human useof fossil fuels in this intricate balance that can be seen in the atmosphere. Soils of Earth Can Also Release CO2There is a lot of carbon stored in soils. In the Northern Hemisphere, there is a storage ofcarbon in soils (that can oxidize to CO2 gas) which is at least three times as large as thetotal atmospheric content of CO2. And so, there is potential to release quite a bit of carbonif the soils get warmer and some of this carbon in the soil expires, is oxidized, into CO2.The potential to change the atmosphere quite a lot is clearly there and this is somethingthat we are researching in order to understand how available is the soil carbon and howrapidly it can enter the atmosphere."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"HOW MUCH MORE RAPID HAS BEEN THE INCREASE IN CO2 IN 2003-2004COMPARED TO PREVIOUS YEARS?The short answer is almost doubled. The long answer is that we have variations. These twoyears might - and we have seen this behavior before a rapid increase is followed by lessrapid increase. To really say we have had a change, this present situation must go on forprolonged period of time, 5 to 10 years. But clearly the data indicates that the soil carbonis more mobile than we previously thought.MEANING COULD RELEASE MORE CARBON DIOXIDE.Is available for release from the carbon. We now have cases where it has occurred for ayear or two. We certainly can see that the increase rate can rise quite a lot compared to theaverage over the past 20 to 30 years.\"Websites:Norwegian Institute for Air ResearchMauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii (NOAA)Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
