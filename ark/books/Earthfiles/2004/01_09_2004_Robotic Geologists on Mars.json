January 9, 2004 Ithaca, New York - As the New Year of 2004 gets underway,the Bush Administration announced this week that the President will soonpropose a plan to send a manned American mission to Mars and to the moon.In addition to proposing the first trip back to the moon since December 1972,President Bush says he wants to build a permanent space station there. Somescientists speculate that the moon could be used as the preparation andlaunching pad for a manned Mars mission.Spirit and Opportunity - Robotic \"Geologists\" on MarsMars was already dominating the news before the White House announcement.This past Saturday, January 3, 2004, NASA scientists cheered in their PasadenaJet Propulsion Lab control room as a robot named \"Spirit\" came down inside theMartian crater Gusev near the red planet's equator.The designated landing site for the first Mars Spirit robotic \"geologists\" missionis Gusev Crater, seen here from earlier NASA Viking images provided by NASA.Spirit is the fourth American machine to successfully land on Mars since thefirst Viking mission of 1976. Spirit was dropped to the Martian surface by itsorbiter and was protected in its fall by many air bags. When Spirit hit the dustysurface inside the crater, it bounced several times before coming to a stop."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Artist's conception of \"Spirit\" rover inside its protective lander of air bags bouncingon surface of Mars in landing on January 3, 2004. Image courtesy NASA.Then, on January 8, when NASA engineers tried to move the 6-wheeled robotout of its lander to explore the ground and rocks around it, one of the air bagsblocked its path. The goal is to get the Spirit robotic geologist rolling on thecrater surface by Wednesday, January 12. But the air bag problem might delaythat exploration by a few more days.JPL engineers watched the Mars Exploration Rover \"Spirit\" successfully stand upon its lander the night of January 8, 2004, (Pacific time) preparing to leave the landercovered with air bags.This image from the rover's front hazard avoidance camera shows the rover in the finalstage of its stand-up process.The two wheels on the bottom right and left are locked into position, along with thesuspension system.The Martian landscape strewn with rocks is in the background. With a deflated air bagpartially blockingone exit route, engineers will decide whether Spirit should use a different routeto roll off the lander. Image credit: NASA/JPL.A second robot named \"Opportunity\" is expected to land on the opposite side ofMars on January 24 at roughly Noon Eastern Time. Spirit and Opportunity weremade to be Earth's first roving robotic geologists on Mars, capable of drillinginto the surfaces of rocks to find out what they are made of. Scientists also hopethat the robots will be able to find evidence of lake water or running water fromMars' ancient past.Gusev Crater Was Probably Once A Watery LakeAlready, while still parked inside the lander, the Spirit robot has picked up datathat indicates the presence of minerals that might have formed a lake inside theGusev crater landing site. No one today doubts that there is ice water and carbondioxide ice in the very cold northern high latitudes of the red planet. But wheredid all the water go that left big channels and canyons?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"This graph, consisting of data acquired on Mars from the Mars ExplorationRover Spirit's mini-thermal emission spectrometer, shows the light, or spectral,signature of an as-of-yet unidentified mineral that contains bound water in its crystalstructure.Minerals such as gypsum and zeolites are possible candidates.

The left and right camera images arecombined to produce a 3-D image.

But these newimages from Spirit are the clearest ever transmitted back to Earth. In fact, one ofthe cameras on Spirit called a \"pan-cam\" has the sharpness of the human eye.The images were sent back to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena fromtwo satellites we currently have orbiting Mars and which receive data from theSpirit robotic lander. One of the first photographs surprised planetary geologists.It shows strange tracks near the Spirit lander, almost as if the soil were folded onitself in layers."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Above and below: this segment of the first color images are from the panoramic camera ontheMars Exploration Rover Spirit which shows the rover's darker-colored air bag trails.

Imagecredit: NASA/JPL/Cornell .Many of the scientists participating in the Spirit and Opportunity lander researchare from Cornell University. This week I talked with Cornell's Dr. Peter Thomas,Senior Research Associate at the Center for Radio Physics and Space Researchin Ithaca, New York. He is an expert in Martian surface features and I asked himabout the unusual appearance of the landing tracks.Interview:Peter Thomas, Senior Research Associate at the Center for Radio Physicsand Space Research in Ithaca, New York: \"They are unusual in the sense thatwe haven't seen them before from the previous landers. But the previous landers,including all the way back to Viking are showing that among the things that areon the Martian surface mixed in are not just things that might be dark minerals,clays, or things like that but also things that are considered salts like sulfur.They are in very small amounts, but still there and so there is some variety ofmaterials which might with very small particles give the soil some cohesion. Weknow this from the way dust particles behave when they are dry just very smallthings can give them cohesion. But they might behave in very interesting ways,especially if you push down on them a little bit on a soft deposit with an air bagand then let go of it.When I first saw the image of the tracks, it did really look like if you slidesomething on the surface where there is a little thin layer that is loose. These aresome of the things I would like to see in stereo to get a feel for what the3-dimensional form of the disturbed material is.DO YOU THINK THERE IS ANY CHANCE THAT IT'S WATER OR AN OILYSUBSTANCE OR SOMETHING THAT IS RIGHT THERE UNDER THATSURFACE DUST?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"It's probably more like little bits of sulfur or other salts that can bind the verysmall particles with electrostatic forces between the dust particles. I don't thinkyou really need much in the way of water vapor or ice in order to do thatbonding. But as one of the soil components around the Spirit landing area, that'sone of the components that will get looked at. The rover is probably not goingto exit the lander for several more days.THEN WILL IT BE INDEPENDENT ENOUGH TO GO OUT AND DRILLDOWN INTO THIS AREA THAT IS COMPACTED?The drilling it will rove and it is independent once it moves off and is free of thelander. It does have a thing called a rock abrasion tool on it which is designed tobasically remove \"rinds\" on rocks and look at it through microscopic imagersand determine what the composition below is. Now this (compressed Martiansoil near Spirit lander) looks like fairly loose material, so using the rock abrasiontool would probably just scatter the particles. So, examination of this willprobably not involve the rock abrasion tool, but you can certainly get an idea ofwhat minerals and elements are in it.One of the other things is simply to drive the Spirit rover's wheel over the soil tosee what the mechanical response to a known pressure you know what thepressure in the bottom of a rotor wheel is. If you just drive the wheel over thecompressed stuff and see how far it goes in, you can get a good idea of themechanical property of the soil. That will tell you something about the strengthof the material which in combination with its chemical composition can then using microscopic imager tell you a lot about whether it's typical wind-depositeddust; or has it had some unusual erosional history; or has a particularcomposition that happens to clump more nicely than other dust on Mars.ANY POSSIBILITY THAT THIS COULD BE CO2 ICE IN THOSECOMPRESSED TRACKS?It's probably not because the CO2 ice comes out at much colder temperaturesthan even the H2O water does. This is a fairly low altitude and latitude part ofMars. It's really too warm to be CO2 ice associated with the compression. H2O Water Ice \"Definitely\" On MarsIS IT FAIR AS A REPORTER TO SAY THAT WE DEFINITELY KNOW THATTHERE IS SOME WATER ON MARS?Certainly there is some water on Mars. It might not be very much and it might bein very unglamorous situations of being little bits of ice in soil at high latitudes.But that's what the gamma ray spectrometer says.COULD SPIRIT OR OPPORTUNITY HAVE LANDED IN THAT NORTHERNLATITUDE?No, it gets harder because the temperatures and the amount of sunlight to worklanders at the higher latitudes. There will be another lander at moderately highlatitudes in a few years, but the Mars polar lander a few years agounsuccessfully tried to land at high latitudes. It would have specifically, one ofits experiments was to see if there was any water ice near the surface there. It'sjust more difficult in those higher latitudes because of the sunless days andmuch colder temperatures to put landers at high latitudes.HOW DEEP CAN SPIRIT DRILL?Its drill is designed only to go a very short distance into hard rock. It's not like areal drill going down in any depth at all. It's just to get a few millimeters ofcovering off rocks.SO, WE DON'T YET HAVE THE ABILITY TO DRILL STRAIGHT DOWNLIKE LOOKING FOR WATER ON THE EARTH SOME HOW?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Right. It's first, hard to do. It's also not really expected to be particularly useful.BUT CAN THE ORBITERS THAT YOU ARE SO FAMILIAR WITH, CANTHEY USE RADAR AND OTHER SYSTEMS TO DETECT WATER AT ANYSPECIFIC DEPTH NOW ON MARS?They might be able to give some indication of that. The Mars Express which theEuropeans (European Space Agency, ESA) just put into orbit has a radar uniton it that will give you some information on the layering depth. It might givesome indication of whether there is some possibility of water in the pores of therocks and soil. But that would be sort of a big average number.\" Why Are There So Many Rocks on Mars?Another mystery in Mars surface photographs are all the rocks. If wind and dusthave been blowing for centuries, why do they look so fresh and even angular?Why aren't the rocks all worn down to smooth surfaces beneath the red dust ofMars? Dr. Thomas is particularly interested in the role that wind and dust play. Iasked him if wind has sand blasted the surface for millennia, why are there somany rocks of various sizes and shapes - many angular - in the Martianphotographs?Peter Thomas, Ph.D.: \"It's been subject to meteorite impacts for a long timeand that's really like hitting with a hammer. You break things up where there issolid rock. Even where there is not solid rock, the impacts can compact andmake the soil into fairly solid rock. That's one of the methods that is most likelyfor the scattering of rocks.THAT WOULD MEAN THAT THE SURFACE OF MARS WAS LARGELYEXTRATERRESTRIAL IN TERMS OF METEORITES COMING IN THOSEROCKS WOULD NOT BE INDIGENOUS?The rocks themselves would not necessarily be the meteorites themselves. Theywould be the fragments of the local rocks that had been broken up when hit bythe meteorites. It's only a very small fraction of the surface material that wouldbe meteorites. It's the fragmented debris that happens when you hit somethingwith a high speed meteorite.There are other ways, of course, of breaking the rocks up and meteorites are oneway to scatter the stuff. All the rocks might not been placed that way. Theymight have been rocks carried there by water and gradually eroded into sharperforms. There might have been rocks carried only a short distance by water andnot rounded very much, maybe sharpened by the wind later. That's one of thereasons you want to really go over and drill into the rocks and see exactly whatis in the inside and if it is the same as what is on the outside to see what all thelocal layering is and if the rock was carried there by water or whether it wasdropped there as part of material thrown out by an impact crater. Why Not Put a Rover Lander Near the Huge Martian Volcanoand Canyon?IF THE BIGGEST VOLCANO (OLYMPUS MONS) AND BIGGEST CANYONIN THE SOLAR SYSTEM ARE ON MARS, WHY HAVEN'T WE SENT AROVER NEAR ONE OF THOSE, ESPECIALLY THE VOLCANO?Basically because of the topography. If you remember the landing scheme forthis Spirit used a bouncing scheme and you put that on a long slope such asOlympus Mons, then you have no clue as to where the thing will wind up orhow many hours later it will wind up somewhere. That's the sort of the samething with the big canyon. You can target these things to an accuracy of maybe afew tens of miles horizontally. You might actually do better than that, but you"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"don't really believe beforehand that you're going to get within a few miles ofwhere you are targeting. So, if you have rough topography like that, then youreally don't know the kinds of things you are going to land on or will it be safe?Certainly a bouncing system is not one you want to put down on something withvery long slopes where it would continue to roll for a very long time.Olympus Mons volcano on Mars, the biggest in thesolar system. Image courtesy NASA. Olympus Mons is a volcano that rises over 68,000 feet (about 13 miles or21 kilometers) on the west side of the Tharsis Bulge region of Mars. It is ashield volcano like those that make the Hawaiian islands. That's more thantwice the height of Mount Everest, 5.5 miles (9 kilometers), and MaunaKea, a partially underwater Hawaiian volcano, is 6 miles (10 kilometers)tall. The diameter at the base of Olympus Mons is 372 miles (600kilometers), which is about the size of the state of Wisconsin. Future Martian Missions 'OPPORTUNITY' AND 'SPIRIT' EACH HAVE ABOUT 3-MONTH RESEARCHMISSIONS AS 'ROBOTIC GEOLOGISTS.' WHAT IS THE NEXTSIGNIFICANT CLOSE-UP LOOK AT THE MARTIAN SURFACE?After these missions, there is a smarter lander designed for a few years fromnow. The ultimate goal of a lander is to be able to set up a sample return. That'smany years down the road since it is a very complicated operation to do rightand safely. There are continuing orbital missions to survey the planet in variousways to look at the climate. We've had Mars Global Surveyor going for the lastsix years and Mars Odyssey continuing to orbit. Subsequent orbiters, one whichwill be launched in 2005, will continue to give us a continuous look at theMartian weather and climate over several years so we can start to get a realhandle on how that operates over many years.\" What Has Happened to Britain's Beagle 2 Lander?Also on Mars is the European Space Agency's Beagle 2 lander. Scientists arevery disappointed that the Beagle 2, released from the Mars Express Orbiter onChristmas Day to land on the red planet's surface has still not sent any signals.Mars Express is the first European mission to another planet and ESA officialsremain hopeful there still might be communication with Beagle 2 which wastasked with collecting soil and rock samples for analyses."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"NASA artist's conception of Britain's Beagle 2robotic lander that has remained silent since Christmas Day.I asked Dr. Thomas if there was any more news about the fate of Britain's Beagle2 lander.ANY SPECULATION ABOUT WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED?\"Well, it's a difficult thing to do. That was a mission that did not have a lot ofredundant parts on it. So, it's hard to tell.DO YOU THINK THAT THE ANTENNA COULD HAVE LANDED IN SUCHA WAY THAT IT WAS BROKE N?That would all be speculation. We really don't know what might have happened.It's difficult. I don't know much of the details about the actual operation of theBeagle. It would be nice if it showed up, but we don't know at the moment.WOULD THE MARS ORBITERS SUCH AS MARS GLOBAL SURVEYORHAVE LENSES THAT COULD LOOK CLOSE-UP IN AREAS WHERE THEYTHINK IT (BEAGLE 2) MIGHT BE TO TRY TO FIND IT?That would be really difficult because the area you can cover at high resolutionfrom those would be very small compared to the area that it possibly landed in.It might be a couple of hundred kilometers on a side that you would be lookingfor and if all the resources of the orbiters were dedicated to do that, it wouldtake a long time without any really useful result because you would barely beable to detect something. Maybe if it were there, its size is so small that evendetecting it would be marginal and detecting it in a useful way is even moreunlikely because it probably wouldn't tell you anything about why it was notcommunicating.\"We b s it e :http://www.jpl.nasa.govCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
