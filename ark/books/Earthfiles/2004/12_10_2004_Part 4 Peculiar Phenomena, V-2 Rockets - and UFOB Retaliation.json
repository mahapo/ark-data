Three Disc Crash Retrievals Between July 4-6, 1947On Page 6 of the document, five alien bodies are described as they were found with acrashed aerial vehicle at a site on the northern end of the White Sands Missile Range inJuly 1947. The site is called LZ-2 in the report, which means, \"Landing Zone 2\" on WhiteSands territory between the Trinity Site and Oscura Peak. Landing Zone 1 is defined as thecrash site between Corona and Roswell. A third Landing Zone 3 is defined as 30 miles eastof Alamogordo near the Mescalero Apache Indian Reservation. All three crashes occurredbetween July 4 and July 6, 1947, according to the MJ-12 report.IPU document describes three UFO crash/retrieval sites referred to as LZ (Landing Zone) 1, 2 and 3,occurring between July 4 and 6, 1947. Approximate locations are shown on this map.On Page 2, Paragraph 4, the IPU Intelligence Assessment states: \"On arrival at LZ-2,personnel assessed the finds as not belonging to any aircraft, rocket, weapons, or balloontest that are normally conducted from surrounding bases. First reports indicated that thefirst crash investigators from Roswell AAF that LZ-1 was the remains of an AAF topsecret MOGUL balloon project. When scientists from the Los Alamos ScientificLaboratory arrived to inspect LZ-2, it became apparent to all concerned that what hadcrashed in the desert was something out of this world.IPU Intelligence Assessment, Page 2, Paragraph 4. Description of Humanoid Bodies Recovered"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"at LZ-2, White Sands Proving GroundFurther along in the IPU Intelligence Assessment, Paragraph 11 states: \"as to the bodiesrecovered at LZ-2, it appeared that none of the five crew members survived entry into ouratmosphere due to unknown causes. DR. DETLEV BRONK has been asked to assist in theautopsy of one well preserved cadaver to be done by MAJOR CHARLES REA. Fromwhat descriptions the team was able to learn and from photographs taken by intelligencephotographers, the occupants appear in most respects human with some anatomicaldifferences in the head, eyes, hands and feet. They have a slight build about five feet tall,with grayish-pink skin color. They have no hair on their bodies and clothed with a tightfitting flight suit that appears to be fire proof (some of the bodies looked as if they hadbeen burned on head and hands). Their overall stature reminds one of young children. It isbelieved that there were male and female genders present, but was hard to distinguish.IPU Intelligence Assessment, Paragraph 11. \"Bodies Disected (sic) As You Would A Frog\"\"The most disturbing aspect of this investigation was that there were other bodies foundnot far from Landing Zone 1 (the Mac Brazel site between Corona and Roswell) thatlooked as if they had been disected (misspelled in report) as you would a frog. It is notknown if Army field surgeons had performed exploratory surgery on these bodies. Animalparts were reportedly discovered inside the craft at Landing Zone 2 (White SandsMissile Range site), but this cannot be confirmed. The team has reserved judgement on thisissue.\"IPU Intelligence Assessment, Paragraph 12.It is not known what type of dissected bodies are referred - human? animal? non-human?Apparently those \"disected (sic) bodies\" were found on the ground \"not far from LandingZone-1\" at the Corona site. But whatever the dissected bodies were, in addition to thediscovery of animal parts inside the craft at the White Sands Landing Zone-2, thatdisturbing physical evidence must have scared President Truman and his colleagues sobadly that they all agreed a tight lid must be placed on UFOs. A policy of complete denialin the interest of national security was demanded while the President and his advisers triedto learn more and figure out what they were up against. Thus, the National Security Act of1947 created the Central Intelligence Agency, the Majestic-12 Special Studies Group andpresidential executive orders that required everyone associated with the extraterrestrialinvestigation to deliberately lie to and misinform the press and the public in order toprevent panic and sustain national security. Majestic 12 Project 1st Annual Report, 1952In addition to the dissected humanoids and animal parts, there was another disturbingevent that would also have provoked the Truman Administration's decision to keep all the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"real facts about UFOs and what was in them from the press and public. In the year 1952,Truman's Majestic-12 Special Studies Group issued its first annual report as \"A Review ofthe President's Special Panel to Investigate the Capture of Unidentified Planform SpaceVehicles by U. S. Armed Forces and Agencies.\" (Planform was a word used back then todescribe flatter, curved surfaces.)TOP SECRET MAJIC \"Majestic Twelve Project, 1st Annual Report, 1952. Retroviruses: Biological WarfareOn Page 5 of the TOP SECRET MJ-12 report under a paragraph entitled \"BiologicalWarfare Programs,\" it states:\"Biological Warfare programs in the U.S. and U. K. are in field test states. Discoveryof new virus and bacteria agents so lethal that serums derived by genetic researchcan launch medical science into unheard of fields of biology. The samples extractedfrom bodies found in New Mexico have yielded new strains of a retro-virus nottotally understood, but give promise of the ultimate biological warfare weapon. Thedanger lies in the spread of airborne and bloodborne outbreaks of disease in largepopulations with no medical cures available.\" Majestic Twelve Project, 1st Annual Report, 1952, Page 5, Paragraph F.Retro-viruses was not even a common medical concept in 1947. Examples of retrovirusesare HIV, leukemia and the deadly Ebola virus that causes its victims to hemorrhage bloodfrom every orifice. Retro-viruses are composed only of RNA which can end up gettinghealthy DNA to incorporate the insidious RNA instructions into the genome of the cells,which then destroy.Editor's Note: Retro-virus - 1) A member of a class of RNA viruses that utilizes theenzyme reverse transcriptase to reverse copy its genome into a DNA intermediate, whichintegrates into the host cell chromosome. Many naturally occurring cancers of vertebrateanimals are caused by retroviruses. 2) Any virus in the family Retroviridae that has RNAas its nucleic acid and uses the enzyme reverse transcriptase to copy its genome into theDNA of the host cell's chromosomes. 3) Any of a group of viruses that contain two single-strand linear RNA molecules per virion and reverse transcriptase (RNA to DNA). \"Alien Virus:\" Four Los Alamos SEDSecurity Men Died Hemorrhaging and in SeizuresOn Page 9, ANNEX A, Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the TOP SECRET MJ-12 1st Annual Reportit states:\"8. The Panel was concerned over the contamination of several SED personnel uponcoming in contact with debris near the power plant of the craft security. (That SEDsecurity detachment was from the 509th Composite Group based at Los Alamoswith the Manhattan Project. You can read about them at the website:"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"www.childrenofthemanhattanproject.org.) One technician was overcome andcollapsed when he attempted the removal of a body. Another medical technicianwent into a coma only four hours after placing a body in a rubber body-bag. All fourmen were rushed to Los Alamos for observation. All four later died of seizures andprofuse bleeding. All four were wearing protective suits when they came in contactwith body fluids from the occupants. \"9. Autopsies on the four dead SED technicians are not conclusive. It is believedthat the four may have suffered from some form of toxin or a highly contagiousdisease. Tissue samples are currently being kept at Fort Detrick, Maryland. Majestic Twelve Project, 1st Annual Report, 1952, Page 9, Paragraphs 8 and 9. \"13. In the opinion of the senior Atomic Energy Commission medical officer,current medical equipment and supplies are wholly inadequate in dealing with alarge scale outbreak of the alien virus.\"Majestic Twelve Project, 1st Annual Report, 1952, Page 9, Paragraph 13.Neutron Radiation \"10. The Panel was also concerned with the detection of air-borne release ofradiation over the state of New Mexico. AFTAC detachment from McClellan AFBhas conducted several airborne monitor flights over Site L-2. Radiation readingsindicate a high neutron count was recorded as the plane flew over the site. Neutroncount dropped off as the plane flew a considerable distance from the site.

S.government have been running scared since at least 1947 and trying to keep any signs oftheir fear and lack of control from the press and public. There was the \"peculiarphenomena\" that Col. Turner mentioned in 1947 at White Sands that could simply appearin flight along side Top Secret V-2 launched rockets and apparently cause the V-2 rocketsto change course.Then when the government allegedly used weapons to forcefully bring some of the\"peculiar phenomena\" down to Earth, human airplanes seemed to crash at an alarming ratebetween early May and end of July 1947, provoking President Truman to call for a specialinvestigation of the aviation crisis. Former New Mexico State Representative AndrewKissner thinks many of those airplane crashes were retaliation for U. S. aggression againstthe foreign discs.Perhaps the \"peculiar phenomena\" was here or still is here only to monitor Earth for"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"whatever reason and has never intended harm until threatened by human militaryaggression.But then there were the dissected bodies - including animals - referenced in thegovernment's own highly classified Interplanetary Unit and Majestic 12 reports. Plus, thehemorrhaging deaths of security men who handled crash site bodies. The animalmutilations are famous for being bloodless, without tracks, associated with mysteriouslights and beams, and continue worldwide to date. And what about all those humanabduction complaints since the 1960s, also associated with mysterious lights and beams?Col. Turner's \"peculiar phenomena\" have continued into the 21st Century. But someoneseems to have stopped disks crashing. Did the \"peculiar phenomena\" change? Or did we because payback was too painful?More Information:See other Earthfiles reports about Majestic-12 in Earthfiles Archives:· 11/03/2004 -- Gen.
