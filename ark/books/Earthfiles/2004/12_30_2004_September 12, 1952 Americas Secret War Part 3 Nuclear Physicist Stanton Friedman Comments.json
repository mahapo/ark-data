MarshallChadwell, CIA, September 24, 1952 Return to Part 1September 24, 1952, Memorandum For Director of Central Intelligence (CIA) from H. Marshall Chadwell,Assistant Director, Scientific Intelligence, on the \"Subject: Flying Saucers.\"December 29, 2004 Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada - Stanton Friedman is anuclear physicist who has worked for General Electric, Westinghouse and other companiesin the design and development of fusion rockets and nuclear power plants for spaceapplications. He investigated the famous 1947 UFO crash at Roswell with aviation sciencewriter, Don Berliner, who founded the Fund for UFO Research. The result was their 1992co-authored and now-classic book, Crash At Corona: The U. S. Military Retrieval andCover-up of a UFO.Stan was so impressed with the nearly decade-long investigation by Frank Feschino of theFlatwoods mystery, Gulf of Mexico disappearance and East Coast UFO flap on September12, 1952, that he wrote the Foreword to Frank's book. In that Foreword, Stanton Friedmanreminds us of the famous and controversial November 18, 1952, Eisenhower PresidentialBriefing Document that surfaced in the early 1980s and states about the year 1952:\"In addition, a significant upsurge in the surveillance activity of these craftbeginning in May and continuing through the autumn of this year has causedconsiderable concern that new developments may be imminent.\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Page 005, \"Briefing Document: Operation Majestic 12 Prepared for President-Elect Dwight D.Eisenhower:(EYES ONLY) 18 November 1952.\" Sources: TOP SECRET/MAJIC and An Alien Harvest(Earthfiles Shop).At the time, Stanton points out that \"both the U. S. and the Soviet Union quietly sentaircraft near, and sometimes over, the other country's borders to see how well and rapidlyairborne and electronic defense systems responded. Each side shot down a number of theother side's aircraft ... all in secret until decades later. ...Families were lied to about whathappened to crew members lost in these earlier totally unreported incidents.\"Today, Maxwell AFB is not telling the truth either about the records of the Starfire pilotand radar operator and their sudden and mysterious disappearance over the Gulf ofMexico on September 12, 1952, while accompanied by three other planes. Is the officialdenial because the American government still does not want the public and media to knowthere was a secret American war with whatever intelligence piloted the aerial discs?Interview:Stanton T. Friedman, Nuclear Physicist, UFO Investigator and Co-Author, Crash AtCorona © 1992 and Author, TOP SECRET/MAJIC © 1996, Fredericton, NewBrunswick, Canada: \"Let's face it there should be no surprise that the government flatout lied in 1952. They began flat out lying back in 1947, actually in 1946. So, it's clear thatthey had a well-developed program for dealing with events that could prove embarrassing.The fact that they had Col. Leavitt on the scene that same day originally with 30 peopleand then later 20 more people joining them. That means they were prepared for a crash arecovery team, if you will. They were hoping they would be able to grab one, I'm sure,which didn't quite make it. But they got some pieces.If you look back in history, you find that 1952 was a major year for UFO events thesightings over Washington, D. C., in particular. I think those (Flatwoods and Starfiredisappearance) are just the tips of the iceberg, Linda. When I did a radio show out of NewYork, I had a call-in from a guy who was at Andrews AFB in 1952, where they hadscrambled jets and so forth after the UFOs were seen over Washington. I talked to him offmicrophone and he said, 'Look, we were sending up jets all the time for the next year. Itwasn't just once. He mentioned one event he said in particular impressed him. It was apilot who came back. There had been two planes that had been sent up and only one cameback and all the pilot could say was, 'It went straight up. It went straight up!' And the otherplane was never found. There was a little cover story in the newspaper weeks later about'lost at sea' the usual nonsense.DID YOU INTERPRET IT TO MEAN THAT THE OTHER PLANE, THE HUMANPLANE, WENT STRAIGHT UP UNDER THE FORCE OF THE UFO?No, I interpreted it as meaning the UFO went straight up.IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND SIGNIFICANTIMPLICATIONS OF THE BRAXTON COUNTY AND GULF OF MEXICO ANDFLORIDA, THE COMBINED INCIDENTS ON SEPTEMBER 12, 1952, IS AS FRANKFESCHINO TOLD ME, I THINK WE HAVE HARD EVIDENCE ON THAT DATE ATLEAST OF OUR HUMANS TRYING TO SHOOT DOWN THESE UNIDENTIFIEDAERIAL DISCS AND THE DISCS RETALIATING BY PLUCKING THE RADAROPERATOR AND PILOT LITERALLY OUT OF THE AIR.Well, Linda, I spoke up in McMinnville, Oregon, at the college there many years ago to aguy who had been in radar in Montana in 1951, I believe it was, toward the end of 1951.He had a phone call, a radio message down from Canada, saying there was a UFO headedtoward them. They had a fighter aloft. They vectors him toward a UFO. They watched this"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"on a radar screen. They knew how fast he was going and how high he was, what directionhe was going. Suddenly, no more airplane. What the guy tells me was shortly after that, theword went out it was probably 1952 now that I think about it the word went out: 'Do notshoot. Take gun camera pictures.'So, you can imagine that somebody had the good sense to say, 'Hey guys, there is nothingto be gained by attacking these guys. We're going to get clobbered. We can't compete withthem. Get as much information as you can about their flight patterns, what angles theymake, how the color changes, all the other things you would like to have measurements of. Shooting At Discs Provoked RetaliationYOU WOULD AGREE THEN, STANTON, THAT RETALIATION BY THEUNIDENTIFIED AERIAL DISCS WAS A REAL AND TRUE ISSUE IN THE TRUMANADMINISTRATION, THE EISENHOWER ADMINISTRATION, AND MAYBE ONE OFTHE PRIME REASONS WHY TO THIS VERY DAY, THERE STILL IS A STRICTPOLICY OF DENIAL ABOUT ANY DISCLOSURE OF ANYTHING THAT HASHAPPENED.I think so. And remember, we have the Cuban case the Cuban MIG case where theRussians apparently thought it was OK to order the MIG pilots to attack the unknown as itcame toward Cuba at 30,000 feet at Mach 1. The pilot and wingman they tell it to get theheck away and nothing happens. Our guys are listening in the National Security Agency(NSA) and what should we do about it? And the ground says, 'Shoot it down!' So, the guyarms his missile, gets a radar lock on it, and then the second pilot shrieks over the airwavesas listened to by the NSA that the first plane had just disintegrated. The kicker here is thatthe pilot of the UFO can detect when there is a radar lock on him and decided to takeaction. This was in 1967, mind you.I've heard other stories about the Russians were still trying to shoot discs down over theSoviet Union, for example, for a long time because they wanted the technology. In fact, ifyou really wanted a wild rumor which I had some verification for was that the Russianswere really on a race to the moon. But on four different occasions, their boosters weresplattered on the pad because they were trying to shoot down UFOs.At first, I didn't take that too seriously. Then I was talking to someone who knew a lotabout the Russian space program and he said: 'Well, I don't know about the UFO part ofthat, but it's my understanding that they did have several boosters blow up on the pad.' so Iput a question mark after that. but not too an unreasonable one.THAT THERE COULD HAVE BEEN RETALIATION DIRECTLY AGAINST THESOVIET UNION TO KEEP THEM FROM LAUNCHING TO THE MOON BECAUSETHEY KEPT TRYING TO BRING DOWN DISCS.Yeah. I also remember being told about a UFO-related case off Corpus Christy, Texas. Iwas told by somebody's brother who told him about it. Several planes went up after theUFOs and fewer came back. Then it was posted that the pilots of the planes that did notcome back had been sent to Vietnam. Then it was posted a few days later that the pilotshad been killed in action over there (in Vietnam). The families had obviously been lied to.HOW CAN THE GOVERNMENT ASSUME THAT THE PUBLIC WILL CONSTANTLYBUY ITS LIES?They have for so long. You get in the habit. What can I say?\"More Information: (Flatwoods Monster)"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Click cover to order The Braxton County Monster:The Cover-Up of the Flatwoods Monster Revealed © 2004 by Frank C.
