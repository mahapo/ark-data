Thisepilogue is Len Stringfield's last words in his 1978 to 1994 series of statusreports. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. Epilogue: A Personal Perspective To the average person worldwide, with an average education, regardless ofcultures or religious beliefs, the contents of this monograph probablywould be interpreted as pure nonsense. To them, who represent thebackbone of civilization, they would probably find just as much credibilityin ghosts, trolls, dragons or a pig with wings or maybe a cow jumping overthe moon. In a way, the general world public is like a sleeping Triceratops. It wouldtake a threatening UFO event like a stalking Tyrannosaurus rex to rouse itinto action. Lest we forget it took a Pearl Harbor to jolt the United States,overnight, into a united fighting mood. UFOs behave differently thanwarlike people; they subtly do their \"thing\" without bombs or ray guns,ever so careful not to disturb our traditional cultures or a football or soccergame. As a UFO researcher and author, I, too, like many of my brethren, wasbrought up in a world of cherished traditions, mine based on Westernculture, starting when I took a leap from believing in Santa Claus tosuddenly face a world of God-fearing religions. Growing up, baseball wasmy sport, art and writing my hobbies, and I liked to read Edgar Allan Poe,Lewis Carroll and Conan Doyle. As a patriot, I enlisted in the Army AirCorps, spending 31 months in the 5th Air Force in the Pacific Theater ofthe war, 26 of them in a combat area. But, when I spotted threefoo-fighters near Iwo Jima on August 27, 1945, which triggered my interestinto research in 1950, the orderly world I thought I knew was no more. To me, what does it all mean? Now, as I write this Epilogue, on thethreshold of 1994, I know (or think I know) that something of the higheststrangeness is happening to our world and to our human race from anotherworld, or worlds, by an alien race, or races, endowed with a superiorintelligence and an inexplicable gift of extra-normal powers. While it is credible to believe that we may have been visited in Earth's"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"primordial, Sumerian or Biblical times, the \"Big bang\" of UFO events haveindeed occurred with a pervasive persistence since WWII. While ourgovernment, and perhaps others, may know all the answers, some of theanswers, or none, whatever is going on to cope with the situation behindthe walls of the Inner Sanctum, it has been effectively silenced under thehighest degree of secrecy. If this should be my last monograph on UFO crash/retrievals, I feel awarmth of satisfaction that my contributions have made a dent into thecredibility that UFOs have had fatal failures. But the Roswell incident,alone, has provided enough strong testimonial evidence to suggest that atleast one alien race has ventured to Earth and left its signature. While the bulk of the work in the Roswell case has been accomplished byothers since the Jesse Marcel revelations, I feel privileged being among thefirst to hear his disclosures (April 7, 1978) and the first, to my knowledge,to publish them in my paper, Retrievals of the Third Kind, July 1978,presented at the MUFON Symposium in Dayton, Ohio. I am also proud ofthe fact that I have contributed other sources to the Roswell treasury ofwitnesses, having been first to publish the names of Mrs. SapphoHenderson, wife of the late \"Pappy\" O. W. Henderson, who saw theretrieved bodies and flew some of the crashed UFO wreckage to WrightField (thanks to John August); Beverly Bean, English daughter of SergeantBrown of the 509th, who was involved in the retrieval operation (thanks toTimothy Good); Staff Sergeant Robert Slusher, crew member on B-29flight which transported a top secret crate (bodies?) from Roswell to Ft.Worth. His name and others I got from a fellow crew member \"Tim,\" mykey informant, who still prefers anonymity. All of the above, except thelate Marcel, have since signed affidavits for the Fund for UFO Research. Speaking of pride, I've also had it jolted a few times. Knowing how theword, \"anonymous\" gives some researchers dyspepsia, I felt gleeful on oneoccasion when I was given special permission to introduce to research, thename of the late Dr. Robert Sarbaucher, formerly science consultant in U.S. Defense Department's Joint Research and Development, in my StatusReport III. This privilege was granted to me by Arthur Bray, a Canadian researcherwho had maintained the name in confidence for years on the request of hisfriend, Wilbert Smith, who met the scientist as head of Canada's ProjectMagnet in 1950. Having published Sarbaucher's name, researcher BillSteinman managed to locate him and eventually received anextraordinarily informative letter which, in essence, stated that he wasaware of official reports of a retrieved saucer and its \"insectoid\" occupants.Unfortunately for me, Steinman shared his prized letter with others whowere in the limelight and in short order, Sarbaucher became big news,being quoted in most of the saucerzines. My first glimpse of the letter,however, came about belatedly when I was reviewing the rough copy ofthe manuscript for Steinman's book, UFO Crash at Aztec (1986) in which Iwas asked to write its Foreword. I regret that I was not given theopportunity to chat with the scientist for his comments to my own set ofquestions. So be it in the Hall of Mirrors."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Molded by mankind's traditions, I still have moments that I feel like I amliving in a myth or that I have been deluded by everybody in the Hall ofMirrors. These negative notions are, of course, ludicrous. The foo-fighters Ihave seen over Iwo Jima in 1945 were not myths nor was I mesmerized bythe GI next to me who also witnessed the phenomenon. Beyond thatpersonal experience, the evidence postulating that UFOs are real ismassive. To my knowledge, there is no proof yet of alien intervention in people'slives unless we accept the sheer volume of reports claiming abduction.There does exist some trace evidence of biotic disturbance based on soiland plant samples but, again, it is not proof of an alien perpetrator.Crashed and retrieved UFOs, I believe, are the only sources of potentialproof. With no official announcement forthcoming to verify their existence,my search into the UFO Hall of Mirrors, health permitting, will continue. In closing, I must add there has been a sustained interest among researchersin my article appearing in the October 1992 issue of the MUFON UFOJournal entitled, The ET Connection. This featured a scientist whoclaimed eyeball-to-eyeball, telepathic contact with an alien volunteer at asecret U.S. location. Conducted in the 1970s, its purpose, I understand,was to exchange scientific information. Of note, the scientist commented,\"The insectoid's eyes were dominant; they were powerful - riveting.\" After months of silence, the scientist, through his long-time friend, aphysicist, who was my intermediary, said he, \"liked my presentation inMUFON.\" Also, in trust, he allowed my friend to give me his identity,which I recognized as a person in the scientific community. Encouraged bythis response, we expected more useful information to follow, but in early1993, my friend called to relate that his source could no longer discuss thesubject of UFOs because of certain sensitivities. That was his final word. Attempts to make contact continue by my physicist friend, but as ofJanuary 26, 1994, without success. Once again, I am reminded of my manypromising but inconclusive ventures into the UFO Hall of Mirrors - theabode of the surreal.Len Stringfield, February 1994, Cincinnati, Ohio.

I was assigned a code number - Fox Trot Kilo 3 Zero Blue -which would identify me at the telephone exchange to report by phone tothe Air Defense Command Air Filter Center at Lockbourne AFB inColumbus, Ohio. If my screened UFO report was confirmed by radar, orother means, Air Force interceptors were scrambled. At this point, I wastold that the resultant actions were classified. The Air Force paid myphone bills. Published book, Inside Saucer Post 3-0 Blue, in 1957 which reviewed, inpart, my cooperation with the U. S. Air Force. 3) Assigned as Early Warning Coordinator for the Colorado Project,headed by Dr. Edward Condon, 1967-1969.
