Image courtesy: NASA/JPL/Cornell. February 10, 2004 Pasadena, California - NASA's Jet PropulsionLaboratory:Update on SpiritToday, NASA/JPL reports that the Spirit rover in Gusev crater on Mars \"brokethe record for the farthest distance driven in one day on the red planet, traveling21.2 meters (69.6 feet). Today's distance traveled shattered the Sojourner rover'sprevious record of 7 meters (23 feet) in one Martian day. Right now, Spirit isdriving towards the crater-inside-the-Gusev-crater nicknamed Bonneville.\"On Monday for the first time, Spirit drove by itself for about 21 feet, using itsonboard navigation software and hazard avoidance system. Spirit is preparing tomove at least 250 yards away from its original landing site and the Adirondackrock that it drove right over in the image below. Spirit handled its drive alonevery precisely."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"On February 9, 2004, the Spirit rover drove off on its own using onboard navigationsoftware and hazard avoidance system.

Its rock abrasion tool ground the surface off Adirondack in a patch45.5 millimeters (1.8 inches) in diameter and 2.65 millimeters (0.1 inch) deep.Examination of the freshly exposed interior with the rover's microscopic imagerand other instruments confirmed that the rock is dark volcanic basalt beneath ared coating of iron dust.The dark circular area on the Adirondack rock is where Spirit's robotic armbrushed off a layer of red dust.

Image credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell/USGS.The main task for both rovers in coming weeks and hopefully through May(depending upon condition of power supplies) will be to explore the areasaround their landing sites for evidence in rocks and soils about whether thoseareas ever had environments that were watery and possibly sustained life.Today I talked with Prof. Ronald Greeley, Regents Professor of Geology atArizona State University, about some of the geology surprises so far. Dr. Greeleyis one of the seven Chairs of the Science Operations Working Group (SOWG)for Spirit and Opportunity.Interview:Ronald Greeley, Ph.D., Regents Prof. of Geology, Arizona State UniversityDept. of Geological Sciences, and one of the 7 Chairs of the ScienceOperations Working Group (SOWG) for Spirit and Opportunity, Tempe,Arizona: \"I think one of the big surprises was the application of the brushbefore the grinding took place. The amount of dust covering the rock was morethan we anticipated. After the brushing, it looked like the difference betweennight and day. In fact, the place where the brush was applied turned out to bemuch darker in the pictures than the area that was unbrushed. That shows brightdust had been removed.I think before the brushing, a number of folks had thought that there was not allthat much dust on it. But clearly the brushing showed there was. This isimportant in terms of interpreting the remote sensing data because dust is soprevalent on the surface, we always have to take it into account and what thisbrushing points up is that fact.The rock Adirondack gives a signature that is consistent with it being thevolcanic rock called basalt. This is a very common rock on planetary surfacesand was not totally unexpected. Basalt is an igneous rock that is formed fromlava and is very rich in iron and magnesium and gives the dark appearance wesee in those kinds of lava flows. In fact, they are the same kind of lava flows wesee on the dark surface of Earth's moon.THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDING BASALT IN THIS LARGE PYRAMID-SHAPED ROCK WOULD MEAN WHAT TO YOU ABOUT MARS?We see volcanoes all over the surface of Mars, volcanoes and lava flows. Mostof those, to the best of our knowledge, are composed of basalt or its closerelatives. So, in that sense, it's not unexpected. The question in regard toAdirondack is how did it get onto the floor of the Gusev crater?There are at least two possibilities: one is that it was washed in by the riverchannel that empties into Gusev crater. The second is that it could be a part of alava flow that erupted onto the floor of Gusev crater directly."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"THE CRATER HAD TO BE THERE BEFORE A LAVA ERUPTION INORDER FOR THE BASALT TO GET INTO THE CRATER?That's right. The crater is probably the oldest event that we see in the history ofthe area and it probably reflects the final stages of evolution for Mars as aplanet.MEANING THAT MARS WAS ACTIVELY VOLCANIC HOW LONG AGO?Well, that's one of the big unknowns in our geologic understanding of Mars. Wedon't have good dates for surfaces in rocks that we see on the planet. We reallyneed to have samples returned to Earth from known localities before we canassign ages to it. But as best we can determine, it looks as if there could behundreds of millions of years difference in age between the formation of thecrater and the eruption of any possible lava on the floor (of Gusev crater). Spirit Confirmed OlivineIN THE FIRST ANALYSIS THAT SPIRIT DID OF SOME OF THE SOIL ANDROCKS AROUND IT, THERE WERE TWO TYPES OF IRON- BUT WASFINDING OLIVINE A SURPRISE?Well, olivine is an iron and magnesium rich mineral that is found in certain kindsof basalt flows, so the finding of olivine is consistent with Adirondack being abasaltic volcanic rock.BUT THE THING ABOUT OLIVINE IS THAT IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BEWHERE THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF EROSION?Well, it's more in terms of weathering and chemical alteration of olivine. Olivineas a mineral is not very stable in the presence of a lot of water and oxygen. Itwill alter to other products in various soils. The fact that this olivine appears tobe relatively fresh would say that it was not necessarily exposed to water, atleast not since it was placed within the floor of Gusev crater.The thing we have to remember is that the floor of Gusev crater is probably builtup of multiple layers of different kinds of rocks. Some of those rocks might havebeen placed by the river. Other rocks might have been placed by wind blowingsand and dust into the crater where they are now trapped. And there are otherprocesses involved as well. Then the whole mix has been churned by youngerimpact craters that have slapped down onto the floor of Gusev crater and brokenthe rocks up.It could be that whatever the source for that basalt and olivine is, could wellhave come along after the water-related sediments and been deposited on top ofthose sediments.That's why we are anxious to go to one of the bigger impact craters (Bonneville)that is about 250 yards away from where Spirit is now and the thought is thatthat crater might have penetrated down through the overlying rocks and broughtup some of the older rocks from depth. We hope to get to the rim of that craterand look at those rocks and see if they are different than Adirondack.Over the next couple of days, we are going to start making tracks for the crater.The next stop is to look at the other kinds of rocks that are visible close by.That's one of the so-called 'white rocks' and the plan is to put the instrument onthat rock and find out what it is made of.EVERYTHING SO FAR THAT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED BY SPIRIT IN THEGUSEV CRATER HAS BEEN RELATED TO VOLCANIC DEPOSITS?I think most of the rocks we have seen laying on the surface have been brokenup and put into place by impact processes and again the question is: Were thoserocks worked and re-worked several times by a variety of processes? Trying to"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"untangle what those different processes have been is what the mission is allabout. We still have a ways to go before we can come up with clear answers tothat question.BUT OLIVINE AND THE IRON AND THE BASALT WOULD ALL BECONSISTENT WITH VOLCANIC ORIGINS?Oh, they are very much of volcanic origin. The question is: Were the volcanoesthere within Gusev crater? Or were they outside Gusev crater and then werethose rocks simply carried into the crater? Surprising Geological ComplexitiesI think the area is much more complicated than we had fully appreciated fromthe orbital data and it's going to take weeks, if not months, before we canuntangle it all. The varieties of processes that appear to have operated on therocks that are sitting near Spirit. There could well have been half a dozen ormore. That's the challenge to the science team to come up with answers to thesefundamental questions.\"Continued in Part 2.We b s it e s :http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.htmlhttp://www.esa.int/export/esaCP/index.htmlhttp://athena.cornell.eduCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
