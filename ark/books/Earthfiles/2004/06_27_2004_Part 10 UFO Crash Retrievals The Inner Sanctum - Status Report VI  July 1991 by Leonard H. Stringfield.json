Click here to see Part 1 of Status Report VI Len Stringfield: \"To begin my comments concerning Dr. Epigoni's disclosures, during Ron's earlierinterview ofApril 11, 1990, I must say that his secret work as a physicist did not give him aneed-to-know access to details of the alien anatomy or behavior. Like other areas insidethe Inner Sanctum, the medical exploratory phase is also compartmentalized so that no twospecialists would know the whole A-to-Z story of the alien creature's biostructure. To me, Epigoni's disclosure of the UFOs alleged landings at military bases is more than ofpassing interest. Perhaps, as Ron and I speculated, some of the '40 to 50 landings' mighthave been staged to test the skills of recruits, but whatever the actual number of landings,the incongruity of him being witness to almost human-like crews with noses, ears and teethis a physiological factor not in keeping with the stereotyped little grays retrieved atcrash-sites and encountered in most abduction cases. Suspended animation? Dr. Epigoni is not too clear about this marvel - a subject not too farout in space technology. However, it is difficult to rationalize a purpose to land in thatcondition, exposed to capture and knowing they would be at the mercy of the human race.Surely, Epigoni is omitting important retrieval details from the time of their landing toexhibition in an atmospherically controlled room. Then there is the question of the alien biology. My curiosity is not only aroused byEpigoni's brown biped with teeth, but mainly - hoping to get his inside view of theubiquitous humanoid with grayish reptilian skin and big head. Are both the inhabitants ofone or more than one world? Are they both clones or androids? If so, who's the 'boss?'Several remarks posed by Epigoni might show his knowledge or insight. In one response toRon, he spoke of teeth, but said that he could not tell if they were growing (naturally) ormade. He also spoke of feeling the ribs and he wondered if they were real bone or metal orsomething else. Then he remarked, 'If you could make people like that and give them gunsand send them off to war instead of solder is.' Was what he saw a robot? Whatever the answer might be, I hasten to add that there are other reliable sources of myacquaintance who know of the existence of at least one live alien in custody. If my privatesources are correct - and I have reason to believe them - that live aliens have been incustody and secretly isolated for interrogation or to exchange information, then it isreasonable to believe Epigoni's story of landings with entities in a state of suspendedanimation. Landings at, or near, military installations? I have many reports, some believable, somequestionable. I have cited cases in my previous status reports to name a few: Ft. Riley, anArmy base in Kansas, 1964; Nellis AFB, Nevada, 1968; Big Springs, a secret base in Texas,1968; and at the complex of Fort Dix Army Base and McGuire AFB in New Jersey, 1978.My most credible, firsthand source to witness a landed saucer was an Air Force officer wholater became an astronaut making flights in the Mercury and Gemini programs. During oneof our many chats on UFOs in the 1970s, he told me that in May 1957, while stationed atEdwards AFB, he was in charge of a film crew on assignment to shoot movie footage of acertain area when he spotted a landed saucer with windows and tripods about a quarter of amile from his vehicle. 'We got 445 stills and good movie coverage of it,' he said. 'But I"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"never got to see it on the screen. Intelligence took charge and dispatched it to Washington,D. C.' Others might know his name as different versions of the incident circulated amongresearchers. In my case, I had promised him I would not publish his name. Ron and I discussed the Epigoni disclosures on several occasions. Needless to say, I wascurious about the human-like alien with teeth and even more curious what his source knewabout the little grays, without teeth. Another interview was conducted which produced thefollowing provocative answers: Ron Madeley Further Interview with Dr. Epigoni: 'Q. You had mentioned that when you were with Blue Heaven, you had seen sometype of bodies that they had there. The description that I recall you saying was thatthey were more or less like humans. A. Yeah. Q. I am curious what you think about some of the descriptions that people havegiven where they have seen similar vehicles, but different bodies. The bodies areoften described as about 4 feet all, have large hairless head, no visible nose or ears. A. Well, they've never verified any of those, you see. This thing is verified. Q. How do you account for those stories then from people who have seen them onmilitary bases and so forth? A. Well, as far as those were concerned, a lot of those were acted up - the uh, higherechelon went to an island and they had to make some decision about how to keepeveryone from finding out what was really going on. The government itself has aspecial department for that now, to help the military handle it. Q. What's the name of that? A. I don't know! It's in Washington, D. C. It's been set up in the last six months. Q. To deal specifically with? A. With 'foreign matter,' and UFOs and things like that. And they just set that upwithin the last six months. It might have been eight months, six to eight months ago.(RM Note: Late fall of 1990.) Q. And who is working with that? A. I don't know one of them and I don't want to know them. Q. What do you think that they are going to find? A. I don't know! But with these satellites out there, if there's anything out there,they'll find it. Q. What do you think, based on what you saw at Edwards AFB? What do you thinkthat was? A. I think it was a vehicle from another planet. I saw robots. Robotic type beings. Q. How big was that vehicle that you worked on? A. About 40 feet in diameter. Well, this didn't have a glass dome in the top. It had aturret, but you couldn't see anything in through the windows. Q. What have they done with it since you quit working on it? A. Well, the last I heard, they were trying to figure out some way to get that turretopen and get in that way. That door that opens below that let those guys out andclosed, there is no way those guys (USAF) will get in there. You could take yourfingernail up and drag it real slow and find the seam, but nevertheless ... Q. I think I remember you telling me that it landed at Edwards AFB. A. Well, it landed northwest of the base in a flat part there and that door opened andthe guys walked out and laid down on the ground and the door closed."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Q. They stood there or laid there? A. Laid there. Q. How many of them were there? A. Four. There might still be some inside it. Undoubtedly these four were (had been). Q. How did it get to Edwards AFB? A. They moved it. The Air Force moved it. Q. How long was it between the time that it landed and when the Air Force found it? A. Well, they saw it land, so it was not far from the base. They scratched it up, I cantell you that much! The legs didn't go back up in it. There were no wheels on the legs,so you had to drag the damn thing. Q. What was the reason for using the code name? A. I don't know. My understanding is that the name goes back to WWII.' Stringfield: \"Dr. Epigoni, without explanation, has made obvious changes in his story. Instead of 12aliens taken captive who were in a suspended state of animation, he switched to four;instead of a glass-top dome on the craft, it became a turret. I discussed this matter of discrepancy with Ron and we agreed that it appears that he hadconsulted with his superiors and was advised to alter certain key details. But the strongestevidence that Epigoni had been in recent communication with somebody in an authoritativeposition is in his disclosure that an office had been set up in the past six to eight monthswhose purpose is to 'make a decision how to keep everyone from finding out what is reallygoing on.' If this is true, then the big news is that Dr. Epigoni's remaining disclosures might bebasically true and allowed to be published uncensored with official blessing. Like ChickenLittle's 'skies that fell down,' my assumptions might also fall, but there is a possibility thatsome of the Epigoni revelations might be one of the 'breaches' from the other side of thewall, controlled by the Inner Sanctum. Time will tell. THE CRASH AT FARMINGTON (NEW MEXICO) At the expense of being repetitious, the frequency and unspecific locations of some UFOcrashes and/or landings in New Mexico and environs in the post-WWII era can beconfusing. Even allowing for disinformation leaking out a faked case, there are too manysources with pieces of correlative information to dismiss the postulate that saucer-like craftat that time were 'up to something' and at the same time were crashing or landing forunknown reasons. While Roswell has been the umbrella for most of these events, the leasttalked about was Aztec, the site of a crash promoted by Frank Scully in his blockbusterbook Behind the Flying Saucers, published in 1950. But Scully's fame and his shockingrevelations soon became a shambles. Investigation, which exposed the shady status of someof his informants, was enough for the myopic lords of research and the media at that time.Without looking any further into the incident, (they) declared Aztec a hoax. The case laiddormant for years, along with rumors of other crashes. In fact, it was an indignity to evendiscuss the subject among researchers so thorough was the Aztec stigma. Then in 1986, William Steinman of La Mirada, California - admittedly obsessed by theAztec affair and its loose ends ignored by research - resurrected new interest when hepublished UFO Crash at Aztec. Having written the Foreword for his book, even though Ihad some reservations about the crash, I did expect an eventual positive response from newsources if the case had merit. Nothing. Among researchers, a few were impressed by thevolume of evidence that Steinman had amassed which he had hoped to lend credibility tothe event. But most were still convinced that Scully was duped by scoundrels. A year later in 1987, the mood among UFOlogists suddenly turned. For Roswell, it wasgood; for Aztec, hopeless. Bill Moore, one of Steinman's loudest critics, was reaching newheights of acclaim for his dramatic disclosures of documents about MJ-12 and their supportfor Roswell. I remember when he spellbound a large audience as guest speaker duringdinnertime at the MUFON Symposium in Washington, D. C. announcing hopes for a"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"breakthrough soon. Again, hopes were dashed. The breakthrough never happened. Curious about the dearth of information about Aztec - unless indeed, it were a hoax or awill-of-the-wisp - I made some probes of my own. On October 4, 1987, I phoned GabeValdez of Dulce, New Mexico, described as a law enforcement officer of impeccablecharacter, asking what he knew about the crash from firsthand sources. Valdez was knownto research, having been involved in the investigation of cattle mutilations - some tied inwith UFO activity. Yes, he had heard about the Aztec crash in 1948 and said he had talkedwith two people about two years before who claimed to have firsthand knowledge of it. One was an 87-year-old gentleman, he said, who remembered news of the crash firstreported to be that of an airplane. As a witness to a flatbed truck that hauled it away,Valdez said, he also recalled an officer (not sure whether Air Force or Army) who advisedhim to 'keep quiet.' The other person, a native of Aztec according to Valdez, was a65-year-old lady who heard about the saucer crash and recalls seeing military people busyin the area. Valdez said he had the old gentleman's name marked down somewhere and would let meknow if he found it so that I could call him for firsthand details. I called Valdez twice tocheck and he never called back after that. End of Aztec. But it was not the end of New Mexico crashes. For the enrichment of our chronicle, a newsite for a crash is introduced allegedly occurring near Farmington, a small town about 25miles southeast of Aztec. The source is Chuck Oldham of Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, aprofessional business person who shares the challenges of UFO research with his wife,Vicky, also a professional person in another endeavor. Chuck's information about this crash came initially by phone in the fall of 1990 (by aperson) who preferred at that time not to reveal the location and many other details. InFebruary 1991, I called Chuck and announced that I was planning to publish Status ReportVI and asked if I could include his prized material He agreed, conditionally, on theapproval of his source, a former military officer with high security clearance. The Oldham's report which I received May 30, 1991, with illustrations, is an obviousproduct of professionalism. Included was a photograph of a clay bust of a hypotheticalalien head they had modeled from a composite of reports and a computerized depiction ofthe saucer that had crashed at Farmington. Chuck regretted, however, that he was limitedin revealing certain details which might compromise his source's identity. The Oldham report, copyrighted, is published as follows verbatim: Computer simulation, based on memory of a military officer who alleges he saw a photograph of a crashedsaucer at a military base library open only to personnel with Top Secret access clearances. ChuckOldham's interview with the unidentified officer and drawings which relate to thecraft's basic structure are also included in this report. Report About Alleged Farmington, New Mexico UFO Crash© 1991 by Chuck and Vicky Oldham 'We are releasing this report in the attempt to reduce the imbalance of informationavailable to those researchers involved in pursuing the facts surroundingCRASH/RETRIEVALS. It is not our intent to dispute the research uncovered byother independent investigators. With so little access to the big picture, we must notassume that similar accounts necessarily refer to the same event. Some earlyresearchers uncovered a crash case and assumed that other accounts of crashes musthave been misidentifications of one specific event. After all, a logical argumentwould support the premise that any being technologically advanced enough to visitus from a different solar system would be invulnerable to such catastrophic"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"miscalculation. With this in mind, we would like to draw attention to some of the details conveyedby our witness that are remarkably similar to details in other accounts of UFOcrashes. Firstly, the government file seen by our witness refers to many crashes;secondly, it describes a peculiar break in the porthole of the recovered craft. (Thiscraft is the subject of our report.) The same type of break has been described in pastreports about craft recovered from other locations. There could be many reasons why such a specific description of the porthole break isa feature found in other UFO crash reports. It is possible that publicly reporteddetails from early retrievals were intentionally shuffled to protect the sources of theinformation. Additionally, the intelligence community might have contributed to thisprocess. Whenever classified information surfaces, the pattern of the informationreleased indicates the source of the leak; consequently, governments maintaineffective control over this subject. If many of the retrieved craft exhibited the same kind of pin-hole break, it could bethe result of some defect in the porthole material; maybe it's the characteristicpuncture inflicted by some exotic weapon of extraterrestrial war. Perhaps we willcome to realize, in spite of the existence of technologically advanced beings, thatachievement of perfection is an elusive standard everywhere. We feel that this introduction would not be complete without adding that we stronglysupport other independent researchers that have expressed their dissatisfaction withofficial positions regarding the continued withholding of information about UFOs.This responsibility lies squarely on world leadership. Of their mismanagement of thisand other aspects of world governing, we state: manipulation of the truth is a poorsubstitute for leadership and a weak strategy for the future survival of mankind. Theonly way we can forge ahead is to have clarity of purpose; the only way to attain thisclarity is with a true vision of what we are, as a species, in relationship to theuniverse. The interview took place with a witness who was a former military officer. Whileserving in the military, he had a special security clearance that enabled him to accessa restricted library (prior to 1970). Due to the highly sensitive nature of theinformation and possible risk to this individual, no information is provided whichcould be used to identify him or the location of the base. The following conversationis not written down verbatim, but was compiled over the course of four separatesessions.Q. What was the occasion in which you viewed documents concerning crashedsaucers? A. While I was stationed at this particular base, I had a special assignmentwhich afforded me ample free time. The materials library was available tothose officers with a designated security clearance and I had the appropriateclearance. I was passing time in the library and I discovered a file on thesubject of an alien craft and its dead occupants that had been retrieved. Thefile contained a report, a separate black and white photograph (of the craft)and a book by Major Donald Keyhoe.'\" Continued in Part 11.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
