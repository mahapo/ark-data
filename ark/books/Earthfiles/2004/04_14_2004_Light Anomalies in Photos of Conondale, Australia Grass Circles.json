Some investigators thought natural lodging explained the sorghum event. In both yearsand locations at the time plants went down, local residents reported seeing unidentified lights. April 14, 2004 Conondale, Queensland, Australia - Australian crop circle researcherand author, Richard Giles, reported in Swirled News that the two local teenagers inConondale who first spotted the four grass circles on Sunday afternoon, March 28, were EliColbran and Tom Braby.Giles also reported, \"Two local residents living within a kilometre (two thirds of a mile) ofthe site who spoke to Christopher White and Kate Dash reported seeing bright blue flashesof light at about 11 p.m. or 12 midnight on Saturday and another spoke of a strange musicalnote they heard around midnight. Others told me of strange lights they had seen at nightaround the Conondale valley over the last few years. One women told of a spectacularaerial light display she and her girlfriend saw late one night several years back. The valleydoes seem to have a history of unusual lights.\"In that vein, two photos taken on the Sunday night (by Christopher White) show lightanomalies in the frames. Neither lights were visible when Christopher took the photos. Onephoto shows a single light hovering above the ground with a slight double image. The othershows a light which appears to be moving fast as there are five multiple images of the lightoverlapping each other. To do this it must have been moving incredibly quickly to becaught in a flash photo. Having seen both video and still footage of the lights caught in UKcircles, to my eyes these look very similar.\"Christopher White was born in New Zealand forty-seven years ago and moved to Australiathirteen years ago, first near Adelaide and more recently he moved into the Conondale"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"valley west of Maleny and Montville \"because I love the fresh feel of the land and airthere.\" Christopher's day job is in a restaurant, but his hobby is photography. He has alsobeen fascinated by crop formations, but has never seen a physical circle in plants until thegrass circles appeared only about six kilometers from his home. I talked with Christopherabout his observations in the grass circles both Sunday night, March 28, and early Mondaymorning, March 29, 2004.Interview:The night of Sunday, March 28, 2004, Christopher White photographed a research colleagueholding a flashlight on the center of one of the four neatly clockwise-woven circles discovered that night inpasturegrass near the dairy village of Conondale, Queensland, Australia. Photograph © 2004 by Christopher White.Christopher White, Local Amateur Photographer, Conondale, Queensland,Australia: \"It was about 8:15 in the evening (Sunday, March 28, 2004) and I received acall from a friend of mine, a fellow researcher. He said, 'Put your shoes on. I'm going to bethere in about three minutes. We've got a crop circle to go and see.'We took torches and were quite amazed. We walked up the embankment into this emptyfield and it was kind of 'Wow!' because I had never seen crop circles before only ontelevision and in books. The large circle was right in front of us and we figured at the timeit was about 8 meters and it turned out to be 7.9 meters when we measured it the nextmorning. We found the next smallest size which was about 4 meters which was just southof the largest one. It was those two circles that I photographed the most.We had been told there were four circles and we found all four of them in a straight line.Starting from the north, you have the smallest circle (.85 meter), then the next size up (1.8meters), then we had the largest circle (7.9 meters) and then the next size down (4 meters)at the most southern end. They were aligned exactly 20 degrees east of north, magneticnorth.As a photographer, I was very keen to (see them). We were very respectful, which is agood way to describe it. We did not want to disturb them. Initially, we were a littlereluctant to walk into them and we were very gentle when we did, almost on tiptoe.The grass was exquisitely woven together. There were two or three different types of fieldgrasses there and it was like they had been literally blended and woven together, almostlike a basket in this beautiful clockwise swirl. It actually had a rippled effect that you cansee in some of the photographs the next morning, a little rippled inward.COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THE SURPRISE YOU HAD LATER WHEN YOU GOTTHE FILM DEVELOPED?During the night, we didn't notice any light anomalies at all. I took photos as I felt. I tend tobe more of an intuitive photographer. The first light anomaly was in the largest circle and Idiscovered another in a photograph at the southern most circle. It was a day or two laterthat I had the film processed and saw the largest circle with the multiple frames of lightbouncing in the middle of the circle. I was completely blown away! It looked like it wasvibrating in a way, going backwards and forwards almost. I found that really fascinating."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Above: White light anomaly on photograph of largest grass circle in line of four discovered March 28, 2004,in Conondale, Queensland, Australia.

I was so excited to find that I had actuallycaught on film one of these light anomalies which I had always been really fascinated withand have seen only in documentaries and books.Then a couple of days later, I thought I found a speck on the index photographs of myCD-ROM with the pictures on them. I thought, 'Oh, my God!' So I popped the photo on mycomputer screen and there was another light on the far edge of the southern most circle allon its own.Second white light anomaly discovered in photograph of the southern most grass circle in the lineof four discovered March 28, 2004, near Conondale, Queensland, Australia. Photograph © 2004 byChristopher White.WHAT WAS THE TIME EXPOSURE ON YOUR CAMERA?It probably would have been 125th of a second which is about as fast as this camera will gowith the flash going at close to full speed. I didn't use on that particular frame a flashlight tofocus the lens. The lens focuses in infrared and did it on its own. And in all of my years ofphotography, this is probably the most exciting photograph I have ever taken. I am utterlythrilled.I WISH I KNEW WHAT THE ANSWER IS TO THESE MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS WHATEXACTLY THEY ARE AND WHAT EXACTLY THEY DO."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"It's triggered off something deep inside me. It's very difficult to explain. I have renewed lifeand excitement that kind of surprises me. I really love it.SOME PEOPLE COMPARE IT TO GETTING CLOSER TO THE MYSTERIOUS LIFEFORCE IN THE UNIVERSE.That may well describe it. There is definitely a sense of turning point, as if now I'm going toinvite more into my life like that, and I do want to focus more on something like that. Monday Morning, March 29, 2004, at 6:30 a.m.The circle that really intrigued me was the southern most circle. The southeastern edge wasa completely different type of grass a big high, blady type of grass, green grass, that waswoven into the corner edge of that circle. Flowing into that was what appeared to be apathway about 18 inches to 2-feet-deep into that grass, almost like a semi-circle of energyhad gone into there and it was so obvious that I pointed it out to my friends. It flowed intothat circle as if it was part of it.Conondale, Queensland, Australia researchers measuring largest circle of the fourfound in a line on March 28, 2004.
