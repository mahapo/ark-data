It is now clearthat the Sol 65 Microscopic Imager photographs of the circular object with the shadow castdownward is an optical illusion caused by the images being placed upside down at theNASA/JPL website.

Thatdrive was 27 meters (88.6 feet) toward the edge of Bonneville crater.Spirit then attempted to use auto navigation to reach a target that was an additional 6meters (19.7 feet) away. Sensitive obstacle avoidance software prevented Spirit fromreaching the destination, and like yestersol, the rover completed several drives forward andback. Those drives resulted in a final odometer reading of 40.7 meters (133.5 feet) for theday, even though the total straight-line distance traveled was 30 meters (98.4 feet).The 30-meter (98.4 feet) drive put Spirit close enough to Bonneville's edge to take imageswith the navigation cameras that reveal the opposite rim of the crater.On sol 66, which ends at 1:09 a.m. PST on March 11, 2004, Spirit will drive up to thesummit of the rim and show us what's inside with a 180-degree navigation camerapanorama.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Rim of Bonneville Crater in distance as Spirit continues to travel over rocky ground.Image taken by Left Front Hazard Camera Non-linearized Full frame EDR acquired on Sol 66 of Spirit'smissionto Gusev Crater at approximately 12:20:47 Mars local solar time.

Asecond song, Meet Me Halfway by Kenny Loggins, was played because Opportunity ishalfway through its primary 90-sol surface mission.Opportunity used the rock abrasion tool brush to sweep off the dirt in and around the holeat 'Mojo 2' in the 'Flat Rock' area. Opportunity then took five microscopic images of thefreshly brushed 'Mojo 2.'The miniature thermal emission spectrometer took measurements at three locations on thesurface of Mars, and then pointed upwards to observe the atmosphere in four differentdirections. The panoramic camera was also busy taking images of the magnets around therock abrasion tool area, 'Mojo 2' post brushing, and a new area called 'Slick Rock.'The plan for sol 46, which will end at 1:30 p.m. PST on Thursday, March 11, is to use thescience instruments on the end of the robotic arm on the area dubbed 'Berry Bowl.'\"Many unidentified spherules around a small hole photographed by the Opportunity roverMicroscopic Imager Non-linearized Full frame EDR acquired on Sol 46 of Opportunity's mission to MeridianiPlanumat approximately at approximately 11:40:19 Mars local solar time.
