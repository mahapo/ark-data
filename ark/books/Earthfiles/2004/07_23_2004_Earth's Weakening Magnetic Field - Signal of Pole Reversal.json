July 23, 2004 Santa Cruz, California - Magnetic field lines have been coming out of thesouth pole and entering the north pole of the earth for the past 780,000 years. That is calledthe magnetic dipole. But now scientists have been monitoring the strongest change humanshave ever recorded in the magnetic field at the surface of the earth's internal iron core fourthousand miles down. The result, according to French geophysicist Gauthier Hulot, is thatthe South Atlantic below Africa and South America now have a magnetic field that is 30%weaker than the rest of the planet. Already some satellites passing over that weak magneticfield have suffered electronic failures because charged particles from the sun can penetratemore easily in a weak magnetic field. And over the past century, the global magnetic fieldhas weakened about 10 to 15 percent. Recently, that magnetic field deterioration hasaccelerated, provoking scientists to wonder if it will build up to a pole reversal in whichcompasses will point to the south instead of the north. One scientist began building computer simulations of the earth's magnetic field while heworked at Los Alamo National Laboratory for sixteen years. He is Gary Glatzmaier, Ph.D.in physics. Now Dr. Glatzmaier is Professor of Earth Sciences at the University ofCalifornia - Santa Cruz, where he has continued to build computer models of the earth'sfluid iron core and resulting magnetic poles. Dr. Glatzmaier says his simulations show thatthe earth's liquid iron core is always moving, trying to get rid of heat. As that liquid ironmetal moves up and down, it generates large electric currents and then magnetic fields.Sometimes the liquid iron movement can generate magnetic fields in opposite direction ofthe earth's dipole. In his computer modeling, such reverse core patches continue to growand overwhelm the original polarity. That's when there is a reversal of the poles, oftenpreceded by a weakening of the earth's magnetic field. According to analysis of some earthgeology, pole reversals have happened on average about three times every million years."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The last one was 780,000 years ago, so maybe our planet is overdue for a change.Interview:Gary A. Glatzmaier, Ph.D., Prof. of Earth Sciences, University of California - SantaCruz, Earth Sciences Department, Santa Cruz, California: \"Its intensity appears to bedecreasing and fairly rapidly but a lot of people suggest that this indicates the magneticfield is about to reverse. However and people know this in the geomagnetic andpaleomagnetic community if you look in the records of magnetic remnants.LIKE VOLCANOES.Like volcanoes or ocean bottom where material cooled and when it cools below a certaintemperature, it captures the direction and intensity of the magnetic field location at thattime. If you look at that record, you see that the field has been either increasing ordecreasing all the time. It is never constant. And it tends to go for several thousands ofyears, maybe even tens of thousands of years, in one direction for example, keep increasingslowly. Then, it will start to decrease for say ten thousand years or more. Then, it will startincreasing again. This keeps going all the time.It's true that when a reversal has occurred, it is accompanied by a very weak magneticfield. In other words, the field just keeps decreasing and decreasing, and eventually it doesnot go to zero but gets very weak and the major part of it, the dipole part of it, actuallycollapses and gets re-established in the opposite polarity.Just because it is decreasing now, doesn't mean it's going to reverse. It could, and wehaven't had a reversal for a long time actually a longer time than the average time betweenreversals. The last time was 780,000 years ago. Average Earth Time Between Magnetic Pole ReversalsThe average time between reversals is more like 200,000 years. But it's not every 200,000years. It can be much shorter than that or much longer than that. So just because it isreversing now doesn't mean it WILL reverse and if it does reverse, the soonest it willreverse will probably be 1,000 to 2,000 years from now.780,000 YEARS AGO, THE LAST TIME THAT THE NORTH AND SOUTH POLESCHANGED PLACE IS THERE ANYTHING IN VOLCANIC SEDIMENTS OR OTHERROCK SEDIMENTS THAT INDICATE WHETHER THERE WAS IMPACT ON EARTHL I F E AT T H AT T I M E ?A correlation between species generation and extinction with magnetic field reversals hasnot been established, as far as I can tell. What happens is the field becomes small and veryweak during a reversal and it just allows more cosmic radiation to come in from the sun andfrom other stars, mainly from the sun. And cosmic radiation are particles like protons andelectrons. Impact of Weak Magnetic Field On Earth Life and TechnologiesTHAT CAN HURT EARTH'S LIFE, ALL OF US?Yes, it can. If these particles actually make it through the atmosphere and they pass throughus or through some creature or plant life, because they are charged they can changemolecular structure as they pass through. They can disturb the molecular structure and theDNA structure. So, possibly cause mutations.AND MORE SKIN CANCER.Oh, probably, yeah just because you are having basic molecular and cell structure beingdamaged by these particles that come through.ALSO SATELLITES AND GPS SYSTEMS WE'VE GOT THE PROBLEM THAT AWEAKENING MAGNETIC FIELD THAT ALLOWS IN MORE SOLAR RADIATION ISGOING TO HURT THEM AS WELL.That's right. Another thing I should mention is although the last full reversal was 780,000years ago, there is some evidence that there have been attempted reversals in other words,the field has attempted to reverse several times since then. The latest has been somethinglike 35,000 years ago where certain places on the earth it looks like the field did reverseand then within 10,000 years or so, it reversed back again."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"So, and this occurs in my computer simulations quite often. The field attempts to reverseand it looks like it's reversing or it actually does reverse in certain areas but then it doesn'tlast. The original polarity is able to recover and eventually you get the same polarity backagain.But you have these attempted reversals and during those attempts, the field can becomeweak. You still have the increasing solar and cosmic radiation on the earth. So, it probablydoes happen more frequently. And maybe this current anomaly in the South Atlantic, thatmay end up being an attempted reversal. But, if it keeps getting if the anomaly keepsgetting stronger and the field gets weaker in this area, that can also cause problems, even ifthere is no reversal.SATELLITES MOVING OVER THE SOUTHERN ATLANTIC HAVE ALREADY HADPROBLEMS.That's right. For satellites above the atmosphere, the magnetic field is the only shield. Sowhen the field is weakening, the satellites' electronics and instruments are going to besusceptible to damage. Ozone Deterioration in a Weak Magnetic Field MeansIncreased Ultraviolet Radiation and Damage to Earth LifeWhen the earth's magnetic field is weak, more solar radiation from the sun can reach theatmosphere. That means that solar storms that release energetic particles toward earthcould damage the ozone layer even more than it thinned now by industrial pollution. Themore the ozone layer deteriorates, the more harmful ultraviolet radiation reaches the earth'ssurface where it can damage life. Could Poles Reverse in the Next Century?WHAT'S THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE POLES COULD REVERSE IN JUST THENEXT 100 OR 200 YEARS?What's the possibility? Well, I hate to say anything is impossible, but there's really noevidence that it could happen that quickly. Certainly, it doesn't happen that quickly in thecomputer simulation. But the computer simulations are very crude, so they certainly don'tcapture all the physics.I'd say, based on all our studies and computer simulations and observations inpaleomagnetic measurements, it's highly unlikely. Let's put it that way.IN THE 160 MILLION YEARS OF HISTORY THAT YOU'VE GOT ON THE BOTTOMOF THE OCEAN, HOW MANY POLE REVERSALS HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TODOCUMENT?Probably on the order of maybe 300 or so. I don't know the exact number. But on average,it's two or three per million years. Something like that.THE LAST WAS 780,000 YEARS AGO, SO IF IT AVERAGED THREE TIMES EVERYMILLION YEARS, WE REALLY ARE SORT OF OVERDUE FOR A MAGNETIC POLECHANGE.Yeah, overdue in the sense that it's been longer than the average, but like I said, there havebeen times when it's been much longer than that. You shouldn't expect the time betweenreversals to be the average all the time because it varies so much. But you are right, it couldvery likely happen. It could be happening now. Or maybe not. It's probably a 50/50chance.\" Earth's magnetic dipole undergoing a magnetic field reversal as shown in computer simulation produced by"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Gary A. Glatzmaier,Ph.D. North magnetic field lines are in gold. South magnetic field lines are in turquoise. Currently magneticfield lineshave been coming out of the south pole and entering the north pole of the earth for 780,000 years.In June, the European Space Agency (ESA) confirmed funding for three satellites referredto as \"Swarm\" to be launched in 2009 to monitor the dynamics of the Earth's magnetic fieldmore accurately than ever before.More Information:Known History of Earth's Magnetic ReversalsDr. Glatzmaier: \"There is a record that goes back roughly 160 million years. Now that'snot a large portion the earth is about 4.5 billion years old. The record that comes from theocean floor is only about 160 million years old. The reason is that it goes back to when theNorth American and European continents were altogether (Gonwanaland). It's been almost200 million years since they began separating. They are still separating out slowly. But asthey separate, the middle of the Atlantic keeps uprising basically and producing moreocean floor as the two continents separate. The ocean floor gets created by melted materialfrom below which rises and spreads apart. As it comes to the surface at the bottom of theocean, it cools. And as it cools below what is called the 'Curie temperature,' then it cansupport permanent magnetism. Then it will capture a magnetic field and have a permanentmagnet and the field will be in the direction of the earth's magnetic field at that time.So, that's how they discovered on the ocean floor as you move away from the ridge of thismid-ocean ridge, you see the magnetic field that is captured in the floor to change directionas you move away from that ridge. The further you are from the ridge, the further back intime you are. So, that's how they get a record. They estimate how old or fast the floor hasbeen spreading apart and they can then estimate the time between the magnetic reversals.There are also remnants in lake and ocean bottoms, based on sediments. they can estimatehow much sediment you get per year and measure the magnetic remnant on the lakebottom. Or also in lava flows. As lava flows out of volcanoes, as it cools it will capture themagnetic field. The only problem there is that it doesn't flow for very long.\"Websites:http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~glatz/geodynamo.htmlhttp://www.dmi.dk/eng/index/research_and_development/solar-terrestrial_physics_division/the_oersted-satellite.htmhttp://denali.gsfc.nasa.gov/research/mag_field/purucker/mag_missions.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
