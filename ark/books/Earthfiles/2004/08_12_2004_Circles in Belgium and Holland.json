RobertBoerman who produces the Dutch website, dcca.nl, e-mailed me the following commentsin English about the Belgium incidents and talked with me by phone about two formationsin Holland that he thinks are genuinely mysterious. Belgium Crop Formations - Genuine and Hoaxes? 1) Heers, Limburg, Belgium - June 22, 2004 \"Pictogram of three ring circles connected by arcing pathways in wheat. Dimensionsunknown. Could be genuine.\" Pictogram reported in wheat on June 22, 2004, Heers, Limburg, Belgium.Aerial photograph © 2004 by Tommy Borns. 2) Landen, Limburg, Belgium - July 14, 2004 \"Circle about 30 meters in diameter reported in wheat, Landen, Limburg, Belgium.Probably a hoax.\" Six-armed pattern enclosed in circle reported on July 14, 2004, Landen,Limburg, Belgium.

Diagram © 2004 by Robert Boerman, Ptah. \"Jan Loenders mailed me this information about the Nukerke formation: 'The lay wassloppy, a lot of broken stalks, traces of mechanical pressure. No swollen, blown orelongated nodes. Errors in the geometry (ring was at some places 2.40 meters wide andother places 2.20 meters wide). Construction lines under the laying crop - first a line to thecenter of the grape shot and then the crop lays over the line. (We saw the same in theVlijmen hoax formation).' Jan Loenders thinks that Nukerke formation is a hoax, too.\" Two Dutch Formations with Physical Anomalies Valkenburg, Holland - Mid-June 2004 Five circles ranging in size from about thirteen meters to about five metersascended the hill of a wheat field in Valkenburg, Holland, first discovered inmid-June 2004. Photograph © 2004 by Robert Boerman.Maurice Paulsson discovered the wheat formation of five circles in mid-June, but RobertBoerman and his DCCA research team did not learn about the pattern and investigate ituntil June 27. \"In spite of the age of the formation - it was approximately ten to fourteendays old when we visited - the formation was beautiful to see. As far as we could tell, therewere not much visitors who had entered the formation.\"Robert Boerman, Founder of PTAH Foundation and Webmaster, DCCA Archive,Brummen, Holland: \"The five circles laying on the hill in wheat was a 'Wow!'WERE THE CIRCLES CLOCKWISE OR COUNTERCLOCKWISE?Counterclockwise in all of them.WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS PATTERN THAT CONVINCED YOU THAT IT'S SPECIAL?That it's the real phenomenon?RIGHT.We found a lot of elongated and blown nodes.WERE THE BLOWN NODES IN ALL 5 CIRCLES?Ye s ."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"In the upper row on the left, are normal-sized growth nodes in control wheat plants; on the right are someof the many elongated nodes found in the Valkenburg circles. In the lower row, on the left, are again normalgrowth nodesin control wheat plants; on the right are the holes blown out of the growth nodes in many of the Valkenburgcircles. These\"blown nodes,\" it is hypothesized by biophysicist W. C. Levengood, are created when microwave energy froman unknown source heats up the water in the growth nodes rapidly to steam which explodes outof the nodes. Photograph © 2004 by Robert Boerman.Also, one of our co-workers measured the Bovis scale and it was high, about 3 million.Also, we found a lot of ley lines connecting the pattern of the circles.(Editor's note: The intensity of the rays or vibrations, of a place, plant or object can bemeasured using a dowsing pendulum. The Bovis scale utilizes the knowledge ofelectromagnetic wavelengths and specifically the wavelength of red light which is in theregion of 6,500 Ångström. An average value for a healthy abode and for a healthy personis 6,500 Bovis units. Values below 6,500 Bovis units indicate a qualitative energeticdeficiency. Values above 6,500 Bovis units indicate a higher quality.)WHAT ABOUT MEASUREMENTS OF THE CIRCLES?The first largest circle was about 13 meters.30 in diameter; the second about 9 meters. 80;the third about 8 meters.10; then the fourth was 7 meters.10; and the fifth was 5 meters.80.They are all not perfect circles, but a bit oval. The circles were about ten days old when wegot there and probably appeared around June 17. The guy who reported the formation wasin Belgium and we didn't know about his website report until late June."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Hoeven, Holland - May 20, 2004On July 20, 2004, I was called by Radio Brabant to drive to Eindhoven for a radiointerview about Dutch crop formations. They had in the studio Robbert van den Broecke aDutch guy who has seen some crop circles appear before his eyes. And he's also seen theballs of light. See 05-22-04 Earthfiles.In that interview we talked about a hoax formation at Mill , and then Robbert told aboutsomething which happened behind his house. Later on we found it was about May 20,2004. That night, Robbert felt there was something going to happen that night. He went tobed, but around 1:30 a.m. he woke up and saw two beings with almond-shaped eyes in twocorners of his room. The beings came to him in his bed and touched him with theirfingertips and he felt a sort of click. The next thing he remembers he was waking upoutside in a fresh circle formed behind his house. That's what he said in the interview.So I and others went July 23 to Hoeven on our own and found the circle behind his house.It was an old circle by then.Robert Boerman in center of Hoeven, Holland, wheat circle that Robbert van den Broeckesaid first appeared on May 20, 2004. His son, Bart, is at the left edge of the circle.

My son, Bart, who is 10-years-oldjoined me. He said he wanted to try to photograph balls of light and I told him to go aheadand use my old digital camera and try. Then on the photographs, we saw what we think areballs of light."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Three \"balls of light\" above the Hoeven, Holland, wheat circle on July 23, 2004, duringinvestigation by Robert Boerman of DCCA and his son, Bart.

Therewas a lot of rain on it so it was a mess by then.WHAT WAS THE DIAMETER?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"20 meters by 21.80 meters, again not quite a perfect circle.WHAT IS THE TOTAL OFFICIAL COUNT NOW THIS YEAR OF 2004 FORREPORTED CROP FORMATIONS IN HOLLAND?Reported to us and on our website are nine.OF THOSE NINE, HOW MANY DO YOU THINK ARE NOT GENUINE?The hoaxes are:1) Wageningen, Gelderland, formation of June 12, 2004.2) Mill, Noord Brabant, of July 18, 2004.3) Vlijmen, Noord Brabant, formation from July 26.LEAVING SIX IN THE GENUINELY MYSTERIOUS CATEGORY?Ye s .ARE YOU COLLECTING PLANT AND SOIL SAMPLES FOR EXAMINATION?We take soil samples in almost every formation.
