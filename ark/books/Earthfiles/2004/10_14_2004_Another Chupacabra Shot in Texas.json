Digital image © 2004 by Stacey Womack. October 14, 2004 Pollok, Texas - What are the grey, hairless, animals that people haveseen - and shot in Texas? Back in May this year, Elmendorf, Texas farmer, DevinMcAnally, shot an animal eating mulberries that he also thought was killing his chickens.Devin was amazed that his bullets did not cause bleeding on the strange, grey body. Seephoto at end of this report and 07-31-04 Earthfiles. I was interested in the odd bodybecause I had investigated the \"chupacabra\" mystery in 1996 in both Puerto Rico and thesouthern United States. Many locals described a grey-colored kangaroo-like creature withlong teeth which was blamed for hundreds of punctures in chickens, rabbits and other farmanimals, including some goats and dogs that were still alive after bloodless holes in theirforehead bone or neck. Chupa = sucker and cabra = goat.I talked about the Elmendorf photographs with a San Antonio Zoo spokesman who said hedid not think it was a coyote, but he did not know what it was. Some of the Elmendorftissue was shipped to the University of California-Davis Veterinarian Genetics Laboratoryfor DNA analysis and results are still pending.Now there is another dead animal, shot with a 22-rifle on October 8, that closely resemblesthe Elmendorf body. It was at the Pollok, Texas, home of the Womack family. Mrs.Womack's daughter, Stacey Womack, lives twenty miles away in Lufkin where she workedfor 20 years as a vet technician and three years in the early 1990s as a zoo keeper at theEllen Trout Zoo in Lufkin. Today she is a dog breeder. Stacey has a lot of experience withanimals around Lufkin and Pollok and could not understand what her mother meant whenshe called Tracey in a very emotional state on Friday afternoon, October 8, asking herdaughter to come help because there was a strange animal under the house."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"About twenty miles west of Lufkin, Texas, is Pollok at the edgeof the Davy Crockett National Forest.Interview:Stacey Womack, dog breeder and former veterinarian tech assistant, Lufkin, Texas:\"My mother was just sort of hysterical because they had killed something under the houseand they did not know what it was. I thought, 'This is the most ridiculous thing I've everheard.' They don't know whether it's a coyote or a dog?!I told my mother I would come out there and bring my digital camera. About one-quartermile from my mother's house, I had to hit my breaks because an animal crossed the road infront of me and it was running with its head down and its tail down and it did not have anyhair. It was a strange looking sight and my daughter-in-law was with me and she wanted toknow if it was a wolf. I told her it wasn't a wolf and it was too large for a fox.So, we went on to my mother's house and went around to the back and there was the sameanimal an animal identical to what ran across the road. It was on the ground after they hadjust killed it and there was almost no blood. It was just red where the shot had went in (theeye). I was just totally dumbfounded when I saw it. At first glance, you would think of adeer's head on a kangaroo's body. The ears were real thick and large. It did not have anyhair on it. The skin tissue was necrotic. It was just awful. I did not know what it was.Right eye is where Stacey Womack determined her brother's 22-rifle bullet penetratedthe animal under the house. A small amount of red blood was found around the right eyeand in the right nostril and mouth. Digital image © 2004 by Stacey Womack.I started investigating. It had huge canines that were in excellent condition. The animalwas young because you could tell by its canines and teeth that it was young. In the frontwhere there should be five, six or seven teeth, there were only like two small teeth inbetween the long canines. The canines were probably close to two inches long. They weremore like tusks. They did not fit inside its mouth. It had an over-bite maybe an inch orlonger and it had also had canine tusks coming from the top.Above: Left side of animal's head that has very large ears and extreme overbite,highlighted by tusk-like teeth. Below: Right side of head where 22-rifle bullet penetratedright eye and a piece of the right ear \"snapped of like a cookie\" in Stacey Womack'sgloved hand.

It justsnapped and broke off. This animal had been alive only an hour or so earlier. So, there's noplausible excuse for it being in this condition. No blood again where the ear broke off, Iguess because the animal was dead. I took a lot of pictures of it and am still totallydumbfounded.Above and be low: Nearly 2-inch-long \"tusk\" canine teeth overlapping on strange animal'ssnout that has extreme overbite.

The skin was like powder. It had no elasticity to it. Theskin was just dead. It was real emaciated. I mean, really starved. It had claws instead oftoenails because a dog or canine has a quick. You can see the quick when you go to cliptheir toenails. This had no quick. Its claws were probably an inch and a half to two incheslong and in very excellent condition not worn down from walking on the ground or rocksor anything like that. They were just perfect.The creature's long, dark claws. Digital image © 2004 by Stacey Womack.DO I UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS YOUR BROTHER WHO SHOT IT?Ye s .CAN YOU DESCRIBE THAT SCENE IN THAT MOMENT WHEN THE BULLETAPPARENTLY WENT INTO THE ANIMAL.He said it just fell over. It was under the house, laying down. They would shine the lightunder there because it was dark under the house. It would raise its head up and look at thelight and then it would lay its head back down. So he tried three or four times to get itsattention and it would only raise its head. They were wary about going under the house toget it because when they looked at it, at first they thought it was a calf because its earswere so big. And then they realized it was not and they knew it was in bad shape whateverit was, so he got his 22-rifle and shot it. When he shot it, its head just laid down and died.HOW DID HE GET THE ANIMAL FROM OUT UNDER THE HOUSE?He took a lariat because they are good and stiff and he put it around its neck and pulled itout. It was only 45 minutes later that I got there and it was still laying where they put it.COULD YOU SEE THE BULLET HOLE?Not really, I couldn't. The only place I could see where the bullet went in was its eye, but Ididn't see an exit. Stacey Womack Tried to Find Out What the Animal IsSo, I took the pictures and dragged the carcass to some trees. On Monday morning(October 11), I worried about the other alive animal I had seen because it had to be in thesame condition. So I went to Fish and Wildlife where the game wardens were and they hadno clue what it was. They just sort of freaked out and called their biologist.They took me to their biologist. He said it was a coyote with mange, but he could notexplain the shape of the jaws and the overbite and the condition of the head and the skin. Iknew better (that it was not). So he got his book out and couldn't find it anywhere in hisbook. He could not find the skull or anything to match it. So, he sent me to the TexasAnimal Health Commission.I went there and their vet was out and he was supposed to contact me the next day and hehasn't contacted me yet. I went to two vets and they really didn't know what it was, buttheir speculation was that it was a coyote with some kind of genetic problems with its skinand with its overbite.DID YOU ASK THEM ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE EAR BROKE OFF LIKE ACOOKIE?I asked them about that and nobody ever gave me a possible excuse for that neither one ofthem."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Then somebody I believe it was the television station here emailed some pictures to ourlocal zoo and they went over it and came up with the theory that it was a Mexican hairlessdog. But there is no way it was a dog. I've been in this (animal) business too long.From there, I went to the news office (Lufkin Daily News) and I told them I needed helpwith it because someone needed to get this other (live) animal out of the population andwhatever it had that might be contagious. Or, if it is some different kind of species,someone needs to be aware of it.So, Lynn Winthrop at the newspaper helped me get it publicized. Then yesterday the TVnews talked to me. Now, I've got people calling me constantly with sightings, but youknow how that is.WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE BODY?The body was put in the woods, but so many people have been down there to see it thatyesterday (Wednesday, Oct. 13), we moved it and there are no vultures at all eating thisbody. I noticed that yesterday. It's been five days, six days, and there's not a vulture thattouched it. So, I moved the body yesterday because people keep wanting to get pieces of it so they couldn't get it. And I'm going back this afternoon to get the head.HAVE YOU HEARD FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME OUT TO GET SAMPLES?Yes, that's what I'm getting the head for. It's going to go to a university laboratory for DNAtests.HAS ANYBODY ELSE IN YOUR COMMUNITY DESCRIBED SEEING ANY ANIMALLIKE THIS BEFORE?I had a man call me last night and he said he killed one several years ago that lookedalmost identical to it and he has some pictures of it and he wanted me to have them and Ihad a message on my machine just a few minutes ago that he has the pictures. He says he'sseen them in groups of three. Setting Humane Society Live TrapIT WOULD BE NICE IF PEOPLE WOULD TRY TO TRAP INSTEAD OF KILL ONEOF THESE SO THE ANIMAL COULD BE EXAMINED BY VETERINARIANS ANDZOOLOGISTS.That's what we're going to try to do today. We're going to set some traps. I'm going to go tothe Human Society and get some live traps and see if I can't catch it. I think it would bereally interesting to catch the other one, get it trapped and see it had to be its mate beingthat close and that proximity.I just couldn't stand the thought of the animal is suffering no matter if it is a coyote withgenetic problems. It still does not need to suffer in any form or fashion. And I can't getanybody to help me. Everybody seems to want to speculate, but nobody wants to commitbecause they are professional people and they don't want to be wrong. Pollok and Elmendorf CreaturesAnother thing, my brother said they had been noticing the last two or three days that thepear trees behind the house that something had been eating the pears on the ground something with a larger mouth than squirrels or something like that. I heard the one inElmendorf was eating mulberries. And this one was eating the pears. We noticed them andwondered what was eating the pears?ISN'T POLLOK A LONG WAY FROM ELMENDORF?Pollok is probably 300 miles east of Elmendorf, which is a little south of San Antonio.SO THIS MEANS THERE WOULD BE A WIDE RANGE OF WHATEVER THISANIMAL IS.Yes, if you look at the pictures of the Elmendorf one and you see mine, you're just going tototally freak. It's the same, just in worse condition. This animal, the inside, the palate of itsmouth was peeling. The top of its mouth was peeling, but yet his gums and canines were intotally perfect condition.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"October 8, 2004, photograph of the unidentified animal soonafter it was shot in the right eye by Stacey Womack's brother inPollok, Texas, west of Lufkin.
