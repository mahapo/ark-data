I personally feel that something a wholelot more is going on.\" - Colorado rancher Click to Part 1 \"29. Friend Loses Physical Control Jim: This leads us back to another incident. A friend of a friend who was in theArmy came out to the ranch to visit. He knew nothing about it; this was just his tripto the country. He spent the night, but he would not go into the woods. He feltsomething was very wrong and he did not want to go out. We did not press him andwe didn't discuss anything. The next morning when we got up, he was already up andwas walking across the fields. He would walk stiltedly out and then turn and runback. He was doing that back and forth and everyone thought he was crazy. Whenwe asked him what was going on, he said that every time he got near the house,something took control of him and forced him to walk back into the fields. Appendix II: Witness Speculation and Inference Decision to Tell APRO Investigator Investigator: I can see you are really concerned, but what made you finally decideto take action? Jim: I felt the events that had occurred at the ranch were significant enough so thatsomeone of serious intent should be looking into it. Because I'm reasonably sure thatthere is a permanent installation there. I could go into a lot of reasons, I suppose, butthe main reason is that our ranch overlooks a military installation we have a perfectview. That is the only reason I can think of for a permanent installation being there. I've read (astronomer J. Allen) Hynek's book. I inquired into Dr. (Edward) Condon(Project Blue Book report at University of Colorado). I know people who knew Dr.Condon. I checked into his character. I found out that the CU project was basically asham at least in my own opinion, and that he was certainly not someone to whom Iwould have wanted to pass on my findings. I checked into the 1967 (NebraskaPolice officer) Herbert Schirmer affair, and I found out how he had been treated. Iknew how we treated him because I was additionally PIO officer for the Air Force"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"and I knew how I dealt with that sort of thing as security officer. No one with goodjudgment wants to be made a laughing stock. Barbara: When Jim got to the point that he was going to write the letter, I talkedhim out of it. But I've known Jim's family for a long time and I know Jim wellenough to know that if he wants to do something, he'll go ahead and do it anyway. Jim: I had already made plans to go to Northwestern (University) and talk to Dr.Hynek (astronomy professor). Barbara: I was reasonably sure you would do something like that. Jim picked up acopy of the Sentinel newspaper and was reading the article and saw your name. Wediscussed it and I called you. Whether anyone believes us or not, as we have alreadytold you, we decided it does not matter. What we have seen, whether it was valid ornot, someone else with some interest other than publicity should know. I'm not thatcommunity-minded. I know the areas that I'm a humanitarian in and that's not one ofthem. I would let George do it. I've been able to talk to some people who have really helped me understand the factthat my own fears are my own fears, and they have nothing to do with anything elseand I should not confuse them. I have gotten some of that worked out. But, anyway,with Jim bringing it up in front of everyone, I knew that he was going to dosomething anyway. I felt that I would rather be in on it and know what was said andwhat I might have to deal with later. The thing I fear the most is the unknown. If Ihave a friend I have a cross word with and I don't know how she is going to take itafterward, it drives me bananas. The unknown I can't deal with I'd rather have thefight and get it over with. I agreed to call you because Jim is the one who wanted togive this information. I really just wanted to be away from it. John said that if you were interested inhearing what he had to say (he was at the ranch less than any of us because he hadto commute so much), he would talk with you if you wanted to follow up. But he isworking tonight and could not come. John is as nervous as I am about this becausehe has been with his company 19 years. He is in management and is doing well andanything like this would totally destroy his opportunity for further advancement. Jim: You see, the reason I decided to talk to you is your credentials. If I approachpeople in the town with your credentials you know, guaranteeing confidentiality,they would talk to you. But if someone showed up with long hair, looking bizarre,and wanting to talk to space creatures, we would be pretty well ostracized. They aretremendously clannish in the county. And there's only one place that serves hardliquor in the whole county and that's only a recent occurrence. And I really love thecounty. I do want to move back there, but never back to the ranch. Personal Feelings I go back periodically. We had some guests from California and they wanted to goout and see what was happening. I took them out and we spent the night at the ranchand we were looked over again. The reason that I think that I really wanted to bringit to someone's attention is I'm reasonably sure that they play rough. It's not bigbrothers from space who are interested in us as spiritual beings or whatever. I'mabsolutely convinced that they could not care less if we live or die. We're nuisances,although I think they may be more humanitarian than we are. And I can only assumethat they are watching us, watching our military potential because I can't conceive ofanything else. I have no doubts that they are mutilating the cattle none at all. The cattle are beinglifted into the air, they are being drained of blood, they are being mutilated and theyare being lowered. If they wanted to do just biological research on cattle, they couldhave disposed of the remains without them being found. The animals are left where"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"they will be found. It is obviously some intent to instill fear and it has been quitesuccessful. The people are extremely fearful.And about the story that helicopters are doing it. I figured out early in the game thatthe government is sending in helicopters in large numbers from several sources, butthey are doing it to cover what is really happening. I'm absolutely sure that thehelicopters have nothing to do with the mutilations. They have had intensive radarnets over that area and the law officer has been kept only moderately informed.The reasons for what they are doing, I think, scare me a little. Certainly theybehaved better than man would have under the same circumstances. If he (blondhumanoid) wanted something, he would have taken it. But I'm not at all sure thattheir purposes and intents are at all favorable to us, or that there is anything we cando. But at least knowledge for knowledge, it is valuable. I have no idea that there isany way that man could stop them or even impede them. But I know that they haveno difficulty at all in immobilizing a person because I've been paralyzed and that'smy freak-out. I'm a little bit claustrophobic and when I can't move.With Barbara, it's her mind. I don't care about my mind they can go through it allthey want to. But don't stop me from moving. That happened about six times to meafter that (encounter in woods). Barbara: When I was about 18, a friend of mine attempted hypnosis and I felt thegoing under. It terrified me beyond anything other than what has happened in thelast couple of years. I suddenly realized that is my big fear losing control of my mind.It is very frightening to me losing the ability to think. Jim: During the 1960s, I took LSD (it was legal) and I don't fear losing control of mymind. I find it almost enjoyable. It is not terrifying to me at all.But this paralysis has happened to several people and I can't conceive of anypurpose they could have out there other than to create terror maybe again, I think ina military way. And that does not go, in my thinking, with wanting to make afavorable association with man. It is not the basis of an amiable relationship to startoff instilling terror. I'm sure what they have done could serve no other purpose. Theyterrorized us, they terrorized others, and mutilated cattle being found all over ninestates, I understand. I'm not at all sympathetic toward them, frankly. The things thatwent on out there (Clearview Ranch) left few doubts that they appear extraterrestrialand I have few doubts that they are not friendly. Barbara: All I want is a simple, uncomplicated life. If I never hear from you again,it will be all right. I'm not trying to discourage you, but that would be fine. I care notwhat you do other than don't involve me. That's really all I care about. Jim: I'm just the opposite. If you ever found out anything, I'd love to know. I'mpretty sure that the things that happened out there are significant enough at least,like the black box. I haven't read about the box, but enough people have seen it. I'mreasonably sure that there is one permanent installation that can be tracked down orat least surveyed by someone. And I'm reasonably sure that the activity is increasing,not diminishing. I have some curiosity about how often this is happening. I have readreports about the alleged kidnapping of Travis Walton in Arizona. The same type ofthing occurred with the man on Mt. Evans who said something was after him. And itjust quietly disappeared out of the news. Of course, I'm familiar with the Betty andBarney Hill thing. I have mixed feelings like the Hickson-Parker case in Pascagoula,Mississippi. Barbara: I'm skeptical about anything I haven't experienced myself.Jim: But when it happens to you, your skepticism goes very quickly, you know. It'sa hard thing. I can't believe it happened to somebody else. But at the same time, Idon't doubt that it happened to me. I think it is probably the same spot that a lot ofpeople are in. Barbara Thinks Children Have Unhealthy Interest in UFOs"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Barbara: I don't want my kids to get anymore into this. The youngest boy is verybright and is getting too wrapped up in this. It is too much. It's unhealthy too much ofanything is unhealthy, I think. I don't see anything other than the tremendous what Iconsider to be unhealthy interest. If something comes on TV or if there is an articlein a magazine, Sam will go to great lengths to hear it including sneaking, lying orwhatever in order to get to the TV, spending lunch money for a magazine and seeingClose Encounters of the Third Kind. And I think that's unhealthy to get thatwrapped in it. Sweet Smell Jim: There is something I would like to know from you. When you are miningberyllium, it gives off a sweet smell. I would really like to know exactly what type ofa sweet smell. What we have experienced out there and a number of people have isa very heavy permeating odor of at first we thought vanilla. Then we finally refinedto cherry-vanilla. And everybody freaked out. It was the smell of cherry-vanilla andit permeated whole large areas. We have driven through it in the car and stoppedpart way through and it's still there. It's there during times when there has been windwhich would have blown anything away from a natural herb or flower or whatever. Barbara: A friend of my husband's who is a rock hound had found some rocks outthere that he said indicated beryl possibly on the property. I don't really know thatmuch about it. Jim: A friend of mine was doing some library research and all she was able to findwas the fact that mining beryllium gives off a sweet smell, but never found outexactly what kind of smell. And there are a lot of different types of sweet smells. Iwould be interested to know about that. I'm sure a mining engineer could tell, but Idon't happen to know any. Investigator: Your ranch is located in an area of coal mines, so I think it more likelythat the sweet smell could come from methane gas escaping. Numerous People See Disks Barbara: You haven't been as afraid to go out as I've been. Jim: Of course, I've insisted that everyone else stay away. Part of the reason that Igot so involved, I guess, is that I have a macho complex. I felt it was my duty toprotect everybody. We saw disks very often, very regularly. John saw them, I sawthem, other people saw them. A friend of ours from Wisconsin saw them. We cameback one night and one of them came right in front of his car. Harry was with him. Barbara: There were, within the two years we were there, an awfully large numberof sightings. Jim: From what I can determine, the activity has accelerated since we moved out,not diminished. We understand that from the neighbors. I took friends out there thatcame from California. We weren't any sooner camped we put out sleeping bags inthe woods to be right in the midst of it than the sounds started around us. Robert hadhis dog with him. The dog crept up and climbed under the covers with him. He gotthe full dose of what we call the 'creepys' that tremendous sense of personal dangerwithout any stimulus. It's like a biochemical reaction. You can give injections andcause the same reaction in a person. Coping with the Experience Barbara: I must be honest. I have to consult a psychiatrist on my own. I have agreat deal of difficulty dealing with this. I know what my own eyes saw. It is not that"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"my vision is poor and I thought I saw what I saw. I know what I experienced. Theincreased pulse rate and all that were not caused by an outside stimulus becausenothing had happened to cause it. I heard no sound and saw nothing. My hearing isnot that fantastic. My eyesight is not very good at all. I know there are people whohave very good hearing ranges and often hear things and subconsciously they cometo conclusions consciously. I don't have that range of hearing to do that. I know whathappened to me and I'm just trying to put it into some sort of reference so that I candeal with it. Jim: I think that probably what she is saying and I experienced it, too is the totalsense of helplessness. I know what gave me the feeling was the inability to move. Inever feared them. I never feared 'Big Foot' or any of them in the sense of personaldanger. But I don't think people can easily face a sense of total helplessness. I thinkthe way I saved my sanity because it didn't really bother me appreciably was bydoing something, like sleeping with my shotgun. I just wiped out the fact that Icouldn't move if they didn't want me to. Somehow, I still felt the power to dosomething. Barbara: But I don't have the range of experience that you have, either. You havelived a very full life and I have not. Jim: Well, this is not something I have lived before. Barbara: No, not that, but you have a broader base to face something with. I don't. Ihave never had anything that startling in my life happen to me. Jim: Is this all absolutely confidential? Investigator: Absolutely. Jim: Well, what she meant by my range of experience I was a security officer in theU. S. Air Force and I transferred to a Security Agency. I worked for them when Iwas young and they paid my way to college. I have kind of thrived on intrigue, tosome extent. So I could deal very well with intrigue. I think in a way, it prepared meto deal with the ranch. But I never thought anything like this would happen to me.And some of the things that happened, I really would like to tell you. It would bebeneficial to me to get it off my chest. But I'm locked into a situational thing. Barbara: Well, let me work a few more times with my psychiatrist and maybe wecan come up with something. Since I've been trying to deal with this, my weight hasgone up about 30 pounds and I'm now smoking almost three packs of cigarettes aday. Five years ago, I didn't smoke at all. I'm turning myself into an absolute physicalwreck and I do have to deal with it because I don't want my family to suffer. Istarted with the psychiatrist about three months ago. I'm sure he doesn't believe athing I'm saying. But he is helping me at least say, 'All right, if you believe it, that'sfine. Let's deal with it from that point.' Jim: She really didn't crack until that night when she thought we were under attack,when the paint on the porch caught fire. Then she cracked. Barbara: I don't know if you have ever wanted anything so bad you can taste it, asthe expression goes. That's how badly I wanted that ranch. But I couldn't face it. Ithink the psychiatrist thinks he is helping me. I'm sure that he does not believe me.But he is approaching it with the fact that if I believe it, I don't have to be insane tobelieve it. If I believe I saw it, and I can deal with it on a rational basis, then we canwork from there. That's what I've gotten from him. You have to understand that onceyou face the fact, then it really doesn't make any difference whether someonebelieves you or not. Two Types of Creatures Appear in Conflict"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Jim: I think the reason that I need to give my opinion is that these creatures,whatever they are - the ones we have seen, with the exception of the two 'morehumanoid' ones, have always appeared to be afraid of something. They areextremely nervous, extremely jumpy, extremely terrified of something and I'm sure itis not us. That I have no doubt of. It is not people. I'm sure they are watching the military base for some unknown reason. I can't thinkof any other reason for them to be there. Whatever this other thing was that showedup, I actually feel more friendly toward this non-humanoid form than I do toward theones that look humanoid. I'm reasonably sure that the humanoids are afraid of the(tall, thin one associated with ice cream cone-shaped craft). Yes, supposition, youknow body language the way it looked at me. It obviously was not afraid ofanything, if that makes sense. It was there, it intended to be there, and it was almostlike a compassionate thing or if you were describing it as a religious experience,almost. You know, you come in contact with something very great. But I never felt that with the disks and whoever was on them. They had always beenvery nervous when anyone showed up. It was almost an extreme paranoia, exceptfor the one time I mentioned that I walked up and talked to them (black box and BigFoot killed). They were very calm, very in control of themselves on that occasion.When I was talking to the law officer, he said that activity ceased when ships of thisother type like Barbara saw showed up. She wasn't the only one to see it. Otherpeople in the community saw it, too. And what he was relating to me as the fact thatthe activity would somehow go down because this other ship showed up. There hasbeen a consistent pattern of the disks diminishing when this other (ice creamcone-shaped) ship shows up. He did not know that the humanoids, or whatever youwant to call them, are in the disks and this other skinny, non-humanoid type is in theice cream cone-shaped thing. What they are up to or what they are doing or the restof it is, I think, partly what I am interested in. There is something going on betweenthem, because I know at the ranch, they apparently were not at all interested in us.We were just nuisances. Barbara: You have an opinion about what happened to me. You felt that they madesome kind of mental contact with me to impress me. I know that the first time ithappened, my mental pattern was changed and I wasn't even aware of it. I didn'treally realize that people have that clear a pattern of thinking until it was differentfor me. It was totally alien to me to think that way. I don't do that. I go very much onthe emotional gut level. Somebody smiles right so they must be all right. It's not whatthey do or the facts you get about them. And that was definitely at least a two-hourexperience. More Speculation Jim: I think I am extremely interested in how they can get into a person's mind,because they have no difficulty controlling mind or body. Everybody has had thesame feelings. Several people have seen the humanoids. Again, I was the only onewho saw this skinny thing. And Barbara, I don't think she wants people to think thatI am crazy she made me absolutely promise never to tell anybody. Barbara: The only reason he convinced me to do this was the validity of what reallyhappened. I know what happened. I know what I saw. I know that I did see disks. Iknow the largest number that I saw at one time was nine. I know that at least onceevery two or three months, we saw disks. So I know that I saw them. I was notimagining them because at that time I certainly was not in the mental state I'm innow. I was very happy with being out there. It got progressively worse because ofwhat had happened and the only reason I agreed to do this was because Jim felt thatmaybe something would come of it, that maybe someone else had seen orexperienced it and maybe something could be put together that would be helpful tomankind. I don't meant o sound like I don't care what happens to mankind, but I"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"don't think I could help that much. I really don't question what Jim saw. Jim: What happened could have been hallucinatory. It could have beendrug-induced. It could have been a lot of things. But from my own subjective range,it happened to me. I would not want to be put up as a laughing stock in the NationalEnquirer. That would infuriate me. But to have someone quietly think I'm insane,you know, that's their problem. Barbara wanted to hush it up, but to me, it'sinteresting. After the pilot crashed and other things occurred, I had no doubt that they(non-humans) can play rough. And the law officer encouraged me to accept thatpoint of view. But again, if they are playing rough, they are up to something that Idon't feel is ethical. I personally feel that something a whole lot more is going on. I have read a lot of books and I personally believe that Herbert Schirmer, the StateTrooper, was picked up. I have no doubts of that one in my own mind. I have a fewdoubts about the Betty Barney Hill case. I have doubts about the one in Mississippi:Hickson and Parker. I think reading the stories helped me so that I was not quite soupset about seeing things. It's hard, though, to explain what you feel inside because you never feel one solidemotion. You know, it's one over here and one over here and one over here. But I dowant absolute confidentiality. That would be the one thing I could not deal with(publicity). If I did find that I was hallucinating, that would not bother me. But I dothink there is a whole lot going on with a lot of people and that's the reason I decidedto come and tell it all. Some could tell a whole lot of things and I think the peoplethat have had some of the best experiences won't. I think it is something that peopleshould do, even if it is a subjective experience. It is possible it could have been atotally subjective experience. Even with all of us, it could have been hallucinations.It could have been a lot of things. Maybe none of it happened. Maybe everybodythere was deceived in some way. I can't picture how, but just because I can't pictureit, does not mean it could not happen. Investigator: There is so much smoke there that it's hard to think that there is notsome fire generating it. Barbara: I think that if you are ever going to do something material about it, thathum would be something that is still going on. To my knowledge, it has never ceased. Jim: If you are interested in the county and the people who live out there, I'm sure Icould induce them to tell about this thing. The law officer, I'm sure, will talk butagain, confidentially. The 'kooky' lady, Roberta, she'll talk on whatever basis. Barbara: I met her briefly in town twice and because of what was happening, Idesperately wanted to go and hear about what she had seen. But other friends said itwould not be good to become friends with her because she was 'the county gossip' there is one in every area and she is a good, kind-hearted person. She is the kind whowill show up with a cake when you need it, but in the meantime, she will describeeverything in detail that she cam across. And I felt that I didn't need that. I havenever spoken to her about anything that happened at all. But other people have toldme what she has seen and she had seen it for many years before we purchased theproperty.\" Continued in Part 6 Are Entities Using Underground Mine As Base?Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"earthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
