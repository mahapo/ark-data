Kecksburg Crash/Retrieval Update (See Earthfiles 10/25/03) Stan Gordon, who extends investigative credits to Keith R. Bastianini andDennis Smeltzer, continues from Part 11 with his report, \"The MilitaryInterest,\" reprinted in Leonard Stringfield's Status Report VII."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"\"Another new eyewitness to come forward is Jerry Betters, awell-known Pittsburgh jazz musician. Jerry was 41-years-old at thetime of the 1965 incident. Jerry was living in Murrysville at the timewhich is located between Pittsburgh and Greensburg. Late thatafternoon, Jerry had just finished feeding some horses. A short timelater after returning to the house, he noticed a bright flash of lightthat lasted only a few seconds and quit. Suddenly the horses becameagitated and the pet dog became excited and made crying sounds.Sometime later, after turning on the radio, he heard news reportsabout the object that had passed over the Pittsburgh area and hadreportedly crashed at Kecksburg. Jerry did not have a car at the time, so he called some friends to tellthem about what had happened at his home since he felt that theflash was related to the sky object. His friends had also heard thenews about the UFO, so they picked him up and proceeded to go toKecksburg to have a look for themselves. Jerry did not know the area,but they found themselves on the private lane. Jerry states that afterrounding a slight turn, they were halted by a military roadblock. Themen, stopping traffic, were dressed in Army fatigues with cloth caps.Other armed services personnel, some helmeted and bearing rifles,others carrying sidearms, were present behind the roadblock. Thedriver rolled down the window to talk to the men while Jerry waslooking over the surroundings. To the left, Jerry noticed a mist orsteam coming up out of the woods. Jerry thought that there mighthave been a fire since he also saw a fire truck ahead. In addition, Jerry recalls numerous military vehicles, including jeepsand canvas-covered personnel trucks with the Army star emblazonedon them scattered ahead on the lane. Jerry also noticed a number of\"Army brass\" officers who differed from the men blocking the road bytheir formal uniforms and commanding attitudes. He also stated thatpolice and some well-dressed civilians were among the assembledgroup. Jerry's attention was diverted to the road black where aranking officer had become impatient with the time it was taking toremove the sightseers. In a harsh commanding manner that left nodoubt that serious action would be taken against them, the officerdemanded their immediate departure. Coming up from the fieldtowards the lane, Jerry noticed a large cab and flatbed trailer cominginto view. At this time, he noticed a domed or acorn-shaped objectthat was being hauled and which was not covered at this time.Quickly, a tarpaulin was placed over it. In the final moments beforetheir departure, Jerry watched the large cab with flatbed trailerattempting to turn with difficulty. Later that night, numerous eyewitnesses saw a large Army cab withflatbed trailer carrying something covered with a tarpaulin from thesite. The flatbed trailer was moving at a fast pace and wasaccompanied by a military jeep escort. We later learned that truckershad spotted this military convoy as it journeyed towards Columbus,Ohio. Prior to the airing of the Unsolved Mysteries TV program, Ihad interviewed a former Air Force officer who was stationed atLockbourne AFB in 1965. He was among other personnel whoguarded the object from Pennsylvania when it made a short stopoverat the base and before continuing on to Wright-Patterson AFB inDayton, Ohio. Clifford E. Stone SFC, U.S. Army (Ret.), has had a long time interestin UFOs ever since he was young. Stone continues to be a very activeUFO researcher and he has a personal interest in the Kecksburg casebecause he was also at Lockbourne AFB in 1965 when theKecksburg object arrived. Stone was not in the service at the time,but had some friends at the base who knew of his UFO interest. Hewas contacted that night and asked if he would like to see what had"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"been recovered earlier that day in Pennsylvania. During the earlymorning hours of December 10, 1965, a friend of his from the basepicked him up and drove him to the back gate of the base. Clifford Stone: 'We parked outside of an area located by a rear gatethat lead to a hangar located inside the fenced flight line area (Ibelieve this hangar to have been what was called the RB-47 hangar).Upon our arrival, my friend told me to remain in the car and try notto be seen. He informed me that he would explain later. From myvantage point in the car, I could see 25 to 35 military personnel, bothArmy and Air Force, around the hangar. The object on the flatbedtrailer was tightly covered and took on a cone or egg shape. Iremember thinking of it as a chocolate drop shape. From time to time,an eerie blue light would shine brightly from the bottom of thecovered object and fade slowly.' Later as Clifford Stone watched, the truck, trailer and object spedaway into the darkness, but this time was escorted by Air Forcesedans, instead of Army gun jeeps. Other sources tell us that the object was taken to Wright-PattersonAFB for study. Where it is located today, we don't know. Muchinformation - and even possible disinformation - has been provided tome as to the nature of the object involved. Until I have the evidence, Ikeep an open mind. After examining the data at hand, I stand by thetwo possible explanations that I have suggested for some time. Myfeelings are that the object might have been (A) a highly advancedSoviet space probe with some re-entry control capability; (B) aspacecraft of extraterrestrial origin. There are data on hand thatsuggests either possibility. That the military and government had amajor interest in this Kecksburg event is well documented by thosewho witnessed various aspects of the event. One firsthand witness, that I have interviewed a number of times,lived a military life as a child. Her father was a high-ranking officerand apparently was directly involved with the investigation of UFOcrash retrievals. Her family had been visiting in Pennsylvania at thetime of the Kecksburg crash. She was standing next to her fatherwhen he received the phone call about the incident and was beinggiven directions about how to get to Kecksburg. He quickly ranupstairs in his civilian clothes and soon came down in his dress blues.Then he quickly left the residence. More sources with information continue to reveal bits and pieces ofthe Kecksburg mystery. Two firsthand former military sources(unknown to each other) have told me that they saw the file report onthe Kecksburg crash, but in different parts of the country at differentbases. One of these sources I have met with again in the last year andwhile he had verbally provided certain information, I wanted to gethis information recorded in a written statement. He told me hewould, but after not hearing from him for several weeks, I againcalled him. He told me that because of the security oath he hadtaken, he wanted to check with a military source before providing thisinformation to me. He sounded shaken and was told by the militarysource that even though his security clearance time had expired -because of the security nature of this Kecksburg event - that heshould not write down anything and it would be in his best interest toforget about what he know. It is time that we strive to get our Congressmen and others interestedin these matters. The evidence exists that UFO retrieval operationshave taken place and likely still do. It is time that a newCongressional investigation should be conducted into cases such asKecksburg and Roswell. If such an inquiry was to be held and"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"immunity provided to former military and government sources, thenthe truth will come out. I will continue to work towards this goal. To those who are curious,the report on the Kecksburg crash allegedly seen by two differentmilitary informants at two different bases, concluded the object wasextraterrestrial.
