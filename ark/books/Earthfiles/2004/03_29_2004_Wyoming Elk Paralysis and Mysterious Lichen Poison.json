March 29, 2004 Laramie, Wyoming - The Wyoming Game and Fish Department'sVeterinarian Laboratory, working in conjunction with the Wyoming State VeterinarianLaboratory, have ruled out 38 possible explanations for the paralysis of 304 elk in a50-square-mile region south of Rawlins since the beginning of February 2004. Ironically,the culprit might be one of the most common ground plants in the region - a lichen knownas Xanthoparmelia chlorochroa, or \"tumbleweed shield lichen.\" But no animal expert inNorth America or the rest of the world has ever seen such a mysterious assault on elk orcaribou before.Puzzled by what could be seriously damaging the muscles in so many otherwise healthyelk, veterinarian toxicologist Dr. Merl Raisbeck, D.V.M. and Ph.D., from the WyomingState Veterinarian Lab, walked some of the region with game warden, Benge Brown. Bothnoticed a large concentration of the lichen where the elk had been found unable to standup. The lichen also appeared to have been eaten by the elk and later necropsies confirmedthe lichen was in dead elk stomachs. But to date, no specific breakdown of chemicalingredients in the lichen has been made and no specific toxin has been identified - despiteerroneous media reports that the poison was usnic acid."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Gary Butler, Wyoming Game and Fish Habitat Program Manager, collectsXanthoparmelia chlorochroa, also known as \"tumbleweed shield lichen,\" that hadbeen browsed by elk in areas where the paralyzed animals were found southof Rawlins.

Consequently, Dr. Merl Raisbeck found someliterature from the 1950s suggesting that one of the lichen that is fairly common inWyoming caused a similar syndrome in the 1950s in cattle. So, based on that, we got kindof suspicious about this lichen - Xanthoparmelia chlorochroa, or \"tumbleweed shieldlichen\" - and we decided the best way to definitely find out if the lichen was the culprit wasbasically to feed it to some research elk.The Wyoming Game and Fish Department has a research compound for wild animals andhas some elk in that compound. So, we took three elk and put them on a diet of this lichenthat is found out there and after seven days on the diet, one of the three elk went down. Itexhibited virtually identical signs that we have seen in the field. Then three days later, orafter ten days of being on that diet, the second animal went down. We still have a thirdanimal who has been on that lichen diet for two weeks and that animal is doing fine. Basedon that experiment, it looks very suspicious that the lichen is the culprit. Rehydrating Sick Elk Did Not WorkTesting the idea that something might be interfering with the elk's vitamin or mineral intake,four elk were kept alive on saline solution and food to see if they could be restored tobetter health. But after one week, one died, two became more ill and had to be put to sleepand the fourth remained very ill."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Two of the four paralyzed elk that the Wyoming Game and Fish Department tried to rehydrateto restore vitamin and mineral intake. But none of the animals improved.Image courtesy Wyoming Game and Fish Dept. Deteriorated Elk Muscle Contains White LesionsDID YOU DO NECROPSIES ON EITHER OF THOSE TWO SICK ELK THAT WENTDOWN AFTER YOUR EXPERIMENTAL DIET? IF YOU DID, WHAT ABOUT THEMUSCLES IN THE DISEASED ELK THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED AS WHITISHAND SICKLY LOOKING, WHICH HAS NOT BEEN LINKED TO THIS TYPE OFTOXICITY BEFORE?Yes, that's correct. The two elk that went down and we did euthanize and necropsy them.The results on the first elk are completed now and the second one, we are waiting to get thehistology results back from the pathologist at the State Vet Lab. But on the first animal, wehave the same type of lesions there and see the same kind of muscle degeneration. So, thatseems to indicate that whatever toxic compound is in the lichen is causing these muscles tobreak down.AND TURN WHITE?That occurs over an extended period of time. It is very difficult to see with the naked eye,except in the very advanced stages. But under a microscope, you can pretty clearly see themuscle degeneration. Toxin Could Be Usnic Acid, But Lichen Components Still Not KnownIS IT TRUE THAT ONE OF THE CONFUSIONS IS THAT IN PEOPLE, THE SAMEKIND OF USNIC ACID IS FOUND IN CERTAIN KINDS OF DIET PILLS BUT NO ONEHAS EVER SEEN MUSCLE DETERIORATION IN HUMANS - ONLY LIVERTOXICITY?That's my understanding from the people I have talked to, but I should point out that we'renot at all convinced at this point that usnic acid is the toxic compound we are dealing with.It's been hypothesized, but not proven and it's going to take a fair amount of work todetermine exactly what the toxic compound is in this lichen that is causing the effect in theelk.SO USNIC ACID IS NOT CONFIRMED AT ALL?That's exactly correct. Some of the reports in some of the newspapers make it sound likethis is definitely the answer, but we're nowhere near that point yet.HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE?We can analyze the lichen for usnic acid relatively rapidly in a matter of a few weeks. Buteven if we find usnic acid in the lichen, that doesn't necessarily mean that usnic acid iswhat is causing this particular problem. If usnic acid is isolated, we then have to try that outitself (on the elk) to see if that is the toxic compound.The other thing that toxicologist Dr. Raisbeck is interested in doing is fractionating outvarious compounds from this lichen and going through and testing each one of themindividually to see which compound is actually the toxic compound."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I AM SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT THERE HAS NOT EVEN BEEN ACONFIRMATION OF USNIC ACID IN THIS PARTICULAR LICHEN, GIVEN SOMEWYOMING MEDIA REPORTS.That's correct. At this point, we don't even no if it has usnic acid. The research that wasdone in the 1950s, they were able to detect usnic acid in the lichen. But we don't evenknow if we are for sure dealing with the same species of lichen as they were in the 1950s.I have been disappointed in some of the media articles. They were basically taking whatwere hypotheses and stating as facts. It might turn out that usnic acid is the culprit here.But we are not to that point yet. Why Would Elk Eat Toxic Plants?Wyoming Game and Fish personnel investigated ground around paralyzed elk and discovered largeconcentration of the lichen Xanthoparmelia chlorochroa. No specific toxic chemical in thelichen has yet been identified. Photograph courtesy Wyoming Game and Fish Dept.ANOTHER PUZZLE TO ME IS THAT ELK ARE AN INTELLIGENT ANIMAL ANDTHEY ARE VERY RUGGED AND THEY ARE ALL OVER THIS AREA IN WYOMING.I'M HEARING YOU SAY THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN ANYTHING IN ELK LIKETHIS BEFORE AND THAT IT WAS A 1950 STUDY RELATED TO CATTLE THAT ISFOCUSED ON USNIC ACID. WHY WOULD ELK EAT ANYTHING THAT WOULDCONTAIN A TOXIC POISON?Well, that's one of the things that we would like to figure out for ourselves. We really don'tknow. There are a couple of different hypotheses.One is that elk regularly ingest lichen and regularly ingest this particular type of lichen(Xanthoparmelia Chlorochroa), but that for whatever reason, the lichen in the red rimsouth of Rawlins has concentrated the toxin that it normally does not have, or has at verylow levels. So that's one hypothesis.The other hypothesis would be that the habitat conditions, the foraging conditions, that areout there are relatively poor and so they didn't have a lot of different forage to choosefrom. It might have been a matter of necessity that the lichen was abundant and that's whythey chose to eat that instead of something else because they didn't have any choice. Thoseare the kinds of things that we definitely want to work out. To xic M e t a l s?SOME PEOPLE HAVE E-MAILED ME ABOUT URANIUM CONTAMINATION INTHAT WYOMING REGION'S WATER, BOTH GROUND WATER AND SURFACEWATER. COULD THE LICHEN ABSORB SOMETHING FROM URANIUM IN THESOIL ?Probably not uranium itself. We tested for the heavy metals early on in the course of thisinvestigation and couldn't identify any. But there is a possibility of a different toxiccompound that might be out there.SOMETHING IN THE ENVIRONMENT, PERHAPS SUCH AS DRYNESS ANDSUDDEN WATER COULD CONCENTRATE IT IN LICHEN?That's another hypothesis that we are working on that there is a fairly significant drought inthis area and there are some toxins in some plants that do tend to concentrate underconditions of environmental stress, so that is certainly a possibility."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"SO, WITHOUT THE DROUGHT, THE LICHEN MIGHT BE TOTALLY HARMLESS?Yes, that is exactly right. Most Females and Calves Disabled in Mid-February 2004DO YOU STILL HAVE A STEADY DRIP OF A FEW PARALYSIS CASES EVERY DAYOR WEEK?No, it seems like the event is over at this point. We had a peak of the number of casesprobably in mid to late February. We had a few cases at the beginning of February and thenit increased and got a lot of cases around mid-February and then it's tapered off in March. Ihaven't heard of any new cases in the last ten days.WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT ANYBODY HAS BEEN ABLE TO POINT A FINGERTO THAT HAPPENED IN MID-FEBRUARY IN TERMS OF WEATHER OR INDUSTRYOR ANYTHING IN THAT AREA?No, not yet.DO YOU PERSONALLY HAVE ANY SUSPICIONS?I guess I have two hypotheses I'm working from. One is the one I've already mentioned toyou that habitat stress, probably the drought, increased a level of a toxic compound in thelichen that doesn't normally get concentrated enough to cause a problem.The other is that perhaps the animals are slowly introduced to this stuff that their gut couldslowly adapt to it so it doesn't become a problem. Because we have other animals in thisarea, particularly pronghorn in there, and we haven't verified this yet, but it's possible thepronghorn are eating the same lichen and not having the effects. So, the idea that theanimals might be able to adapt if they were gradually introduced to this stuff is a goodpossibility.ISN'T THAT ONE OF THE PUZZLES THAT THE ONLY ANIMALS THAT SEEM TO BEAFFECTED WERE MOSTLY FEMALE ELK?That was one of the things that was particularly puzzling about this the fact that it was thefemales isn't particularly troublesome because the herd itself was made up mostly of cowsand calves. There weren't a lot of bulls in there, so you wouldn't expect to see a lot of bullssick. But the fact that it was strictly elk when there are pronghorn out there, a few deer, afew head of cattle and horses, that is what is particular puzzling.AND STILL NO ANSWER AS TO WHY.Still no answer as to why, other than this adaptation hypothesis kind of makes sense fromthat perspective.BUT WHY WOULD A PRONGHORN BE ABLE TO ADAPT WHEN A RUGGED ELKCOULD NOT?It's just that the pronghorn is in that habitat year after year, but the particularly affected elkherd does not normally winter in this area. It normally winters considerably further south.So, if it is not normally accustomed to eating this particular lichen and it moves in there andsuddenly eats a bunch of it. It seems plausible they could have over-indulged and gotwhatever toxic compound is in there at such a concentration that it caused this problem.WHY WEREN'T THE ELK IN THEIR NORMAL FURTHER SOUTH AREA?That's anybody's guess.IT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE DROUGHT?It could. I really don't know why they chose to be there this year (south of Rawlins) ratherthan where they have normally wintered.IS IT TRUE THAT NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN SUCH A DETERIORATION IN 304 ELKEVER BEFORE?Nothing like this. The only kind of die-offs we get on this kind of scale are usually winter-related mortalities, either starvation events or extreme cold weather. So, this is quiteunique."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"THIS IS UNIQUE AND IT IS UNIQUE TO THE ENTIRE GLOBE OF THE ELKPOPULATION?As far as I know. We've had e-mails going out to all of our colleagues throughout thenation, and even some international people, and no one has ever heard of anything like thisbefore.WHAT IS THEIR COMMENT BOTH ON THE UNIQUE DETERIORATION OF THEMUSCLES THAT CAN BE SEEN AS SICKLY WHITE?They are quite surprised, to say the least. There are a variety of wildlife species that eat avariety of lichens. Caribou are probably the most well known. Caribou are closely relatedto elk and they make up a large part of their diet from various lichens. So, it was prettypuzzling to everybody. The muscle lesions again, that is something that has not beendescribed before with any kind of toxin like this. It is a unique situation. Toxin Interfering With Cell's Energy Production?FROM YOUR VETERINARIAN DOCTORATE AND Ph.D. DEGREE, IS THERE ANYLESION IN ANY OTHER DISEASE THAT AFFECTS ELK THAT COMES CLOSE TOTHIS?Yes, if animals are over-exerted, basically run too hard, their muscles can deteriorate likethis. I have seen that both in wild animals and in endurance riding with horses. Horses, ifthey are over-exerted in endurance rides, can have the same kind of thing.WHAT WOULD CAUSE EXTREME EXERTION IN PREGNANT FEMALE ELK?One of the hypotheses out there is that whatever toxic compound it might shut down thecell's ability to manufacture energy. Because of that, the energy sources of that muscle cellget depleted very rapidly and so the muscle degrades because of that. It's not because themuscle is being over-exhorted. It's that the muscle is unable to regenerate its energy supply.DOES THIS FALL IN ANYWAY INTO THE CATEGORY OF WHAT HAPPENS INTHINGS LIKE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND THINGS LIKE PRION-RELATEDDISEASE?No, this seems to be pretty much so far dealing just with the muscle. It doesn't seem to bethat the nerves are affected at all. There is no indication of any kind of prion activityoccurring at all. Trying To Understand Why 50-Square-Miles Became Poisonous to ElkDO YOU IN AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL WAY TO SOLVE SUCH A MYSTERY THATSEEMS TO HAVE A BELL-SHAPED CURVE IN CAUSE AND AFFECT THAT WENTTHROUGH FEBRUARY, PEAKING IN MID-FEBRUARY? HOW DO YOU TRY TOFIND OUT WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED IN THE LANDSCAPE?Fifteen miles south of Rawlins, Wyoming, in a 50-square-mile area owned and managedby the Wyoming Game and Fish Department (WGFD) 304 elk have been disabled by baffling paralysissince first of February 2004, and subsequently euthanized by the WGFD.That is actually a good question and that is one of the things that lead up to this. When wefirst started having the deaths occurring, we have this list of differential diagnoses anythingthat could cause a similar syndrome. Very early on, we determined that this was not aninfectious agent. The vet lab did not isolate any bacteria or viruses or parasites that wouldhave lead to something like this. there was no indication of an immune response as youwould expect in an infectious disease. So, fairly rapidly in the course of this investigation,we decided it was some kind of a toxin. Then we started thinking about what is thepossibility for a toxic water source or a toxic spill that might have occurred at some place."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"then as the whole thing progressed and we start of getting what you are describing, thebell-shaped curve of death, and also deaths occurring over a very wide area about 50square miles in which the elk were dying. that made it very unlikely that we were dealingwith a single point source of a toxin. Most spills in a toxic water problem would be a singlepoint source, so the animals would die in a fairly small radius to that point source.That was another thing that keyed us into that whatever this toxin is, it is pretty equallydistributed out there in the environment. That was when Dr. Merl Raisbeck and Mr. BengeBrown, game warden with the Wyoming Game and Fish Dept., noticed all the lichenappeared to have been browsed upon. But what it is in the lichen that is causing this, wedon't know yet and it will probably be a matter of months before we are able to say forsure.THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED, THE ELK DON'T SEEM TOBE DYING IN THE NUMBERS THAT THEY WERE IN FEBRUARY?That's correct. Whether that's because they adapted to it, or more likely, it's because theymoved out of there. They've headed back south into their more traditional migration forsummer. They are out of the area of the toxin.BUT ISN'T THAT A MYSTERY BECAUSE THAT 50-SQUARE-MILE AREA STILL HASA LOT OF ANIMALS IN IT? WHY AREN'T THE OTHER ANIMALS AFFECTED?WHY ONLY THOSE PREGNANT ELK AND THEIR CALVES?That's one of the things we want to work up on. There are still some deer and pronghorns inthe area, whether it's because they chose not to eat the lichen or because they adapted to it.We want to look at the diets of the other animals out there to see if they have eaten any ofthis - or learned to avoid it.\"More Earthfiles Information:Â· 03/09/2004 -- 300 Wyoming Elk Dead After Baffling ParalysisWebsites:http://gf.state.wy.us/Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
