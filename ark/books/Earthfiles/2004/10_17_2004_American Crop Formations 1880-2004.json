Map © 2004 by Jeffrey Wilson. October 17, 2004 Cincinnati, Ohio - Jeffrey Wilson, Director, Independent Crop CircleResearch Association (ICCRA), has gathered 368 reports related to crop formation eventsin the United States and Ontario, Canada, from 1880 to 2004. The majority of Americancrop formations have occurred east of the Mississippi River and Ohio has had the most - atleast 25 crop formations. The first reported Ohio crop formation was near Middletown in1941, which is only about eight miles south of Miamisburg, Ohio, and its ancientcone-shaped earth mound. Canada's Saskatchewan province has had the most crop formations over the years, butcurrently Jeff Wilson has detailed information only for Ontario. In the future, Jeff andCanadian investigator, Paul Anderson, hope to combine efforts to produce a detailedCanadian map. All of the archives and maps will be made public on Cropcirclenews.comsome time in 2005. I asked Jeff to explain what happened back in 1880.Interview: Jeffrey Wilson, Director, Independent Crop Circle Association (ICCRA), Cleveland,Ohio: \"I came across an early reference to a story of a family in Oskaloosa, Iowa. Thestory is that a farm family was headed to their cyclone cellar behind their house. Stormswere coming. They saw an object in the sky that was \"lit up like a birthday cake.' It wasflying in the air. The family was amazed by retreated into their cellar for the night. Thenext day they came out after the storm had passed. In the grassy field right behind theircellar, they found a large circle that had been flattened down in the grass. They describedseveral burned areas. This made the Oskaloosa newspaper and subsequently, several otherneighbors also reported seeing this object near there. So, multiple witnesses saw the objectfly over the area where the circle emerged.THE GRASS WAS LITERALLY SCORCHED, BURNED?There were areas that were burned, but they also described a circle that was flattened.That's pretty interesting for that early time period."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"WAS THIS IN PASTURE GRASS OR CEREAL CROP?Pasture grass.TELL ME HOW YOU DID THIS SEARCH TO CREATE THIS MAP OF CROPFORMATIONS FROM 1880 TO 2004? WHAT RESOURCES DID YOU USE?I was reading everything I could that had any reference to circles in grass or crops. Thereferences range from crop circle literature to newspaper reports to TV reports, to UFOmagazines and UFO publications.ONE OF THE IRONIES IS THAT EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T HAVE HARDSTRUCTURED CRAFT LINKED TO CROP FORMATIONS VERY SIGNIFICANTLY,WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IS GO TO THE HISTORY BOOKS ABOUT THE UFOPHENOMENON AND HAVE FOUND A LOT OF CROP FORMATION REPORTS?That's right.ANY REPORTS IN THIS ARCHIVE AND RELATED TO THIS MAP THAT CAME TOYOU SPECIFICALLY FROM PEOPLE WHO PRIVATELY KNEW YOU WERE DOINGTHIS RESEARCH AND TALKED TO YOU INDEPENDENTLY?Yes, quite a number of them. There is an excellent case from last year in 2003. It was soonafter I investigated the eyewitness report of three crop circles forming before a man's eyesin Mayville, Wisconsin. See: 09-12-03 Earthfiles. I was contacted by another gentlemanin Prince William County, Virginia, who saw what he described as crop circles forming. Hesaid he was in his house and saw lights coming from quite a distance and saw several ballsof lights 'tumbling' in the air. They came to a stop above the field adjacent to his house. Hewatched them shoot blue beams into the field blue pulses of light and the next day, hewent out there and found flattened crop all over the place.June 13, 2003, Prince William County, Virginia, downed wheat after blasts of pale blue lightin field the night before. Photograph © 2003 by investigator.He is also an amateur ghost hunter and he had an EM field meter the same one that I, TedRobertson, Roger Sugden and other ICCRA field investigators use when we go out toinvestigate crop formations. He took his meter out there and it pegged right to the edge. Hethen took three or four photographs of what he said he saw with his eyes that were 'silverspheres spinning in the field.'"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"June 13, 2003, \"chrome spheres\" as seen by the eyewitnesses appear as white,bright spots on film. Photograph © 2003 by investigator.But when his photographs were developed, they turned out to be white on his film. I havethree or four photographs he sent to me of white spheres of light, three in one photograph.These are not from flash photography. This is daytime stuff with balls of light kind offloating over the top of the wheat. It's a fascinating case. What I wrote down here fromhim is:\"Eyewitness (name withheld) reported seeing multiple balls of light tumbling andcircling over the wheat field, down the hill across the street from his second storywindow on June 12, 2003. Mostly cloudy and drizzling at the time and eyewitnesswatched as the lights stopped over the field and began circling it. Eyewitness saw ablast of pale blue light shoot down from the lights to the field below. The blue lightblast lasted for approximately a second or so and this action was repeated two moretimes as the lights continued to circle the field. The lights then shot straight up at anincredible speed and then disappeared from view. \"The next morning randomly downed areas of the field were spotted. An amateurghost hunter, eyewitness took his Tri-field EMF meter into the formation and in hiswords, 'pegged the meter.' That would be over 1,000 volts per meter of electric fieldstrength; over 100 micro-Teslas magnetic field strength. \"He tested it several hours later in the afternoon. The meter readings were stillexceeding upper thresholds. Small chrome spheres were spotted by multiplewitnesses. I guess someone from MUFON also went out there and a couple ofneighbors. They watched these chrome spheres flying over the field while theinvestigators were there. They were photographed, but when the photographs cameback, they showed only the white.\" WHAT ABOUT OTHER MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS GOING BACK INTO THEARCHIVES?There have been a number of reports that came from UFO investigator, Ted Phillips, inMissouri. Back in the 1970s, he was looking for physical trace UFO reports that had sometangible physical evidence. He cataloged hundreds of cases. But this was before peoplewere looking at crop formations. But if you go back through his early reports, you findmany of them describe flattened swirled circles in cereal grain crop of which there is nodoubt those people were reporting what would be known today as a crop circle.BESIDES TED PHILLIPS, DO ANY OF THE OLDER REPORTS TALK ABOUTANYONE SEEING MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS?Quite a number do. There is a report I have from 1920. It was in November in NorthCarolina. They don't have the city. The report talked about a brilliant ball of light thatcame down out of the sky into an oat field and exploded, leaving flattened and lightlyscorched areas in the oats.Before 1880, I probably have references for at least ten or fifteen reports in which balls oflight, buzzing and humming noises were reported by eyewitnesses in association withflattened grass or crop fields. 1952 - Scoutmaster Followed Mysterious Lights in Florida"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"ANY REPORT THAT STICKS OUT IN OUR MIND AS BEING PARTICULARLYMYSTERIOUS?There are two fascinating reports in which people were found inside or adjacent to cropcircles after interacting with a ball of light and the people were found near a crop circle.One of the famous cases was in West Palm Beach, Florida in 1952. On August 19, therewas a group of Boy Scouts and Scoutmaster driving home from a scout meeting. They sawsome lights along the ground in an area thick with bushes. They thought perhaps a car hadgone off the road. So, they stopped to investigate. The Scoutmaster left three scouts in thecars and told them, 'If you don't hear back from me in a short while, I want you to go gethelp.' He took his machete and started hacking into the brush. There was no car. Hereported smelling a really odd odor that was so strong he almost blacked out. He began tofeel electrical effects on his skin. He had a flashlight and pointed it up in the sky where hesaw a large, dark sphere hovering just above him. Then he lost consciousness.The Scouts went and got help and the police came back and found him incoherent on theground with burns on his face and arms and singed hair. They took him to the localhospital which was a U. S Air Force hospital. The doctor there examined him and said theburns he received were pretty much like flash radiation exposure.But the most interesting part of the story, in addition to the crop circle, is that he wasfound just outside a swirled, flattened circle of grass.There's another similar case in Florida from just a few years after that which was verysimilar. A person blacked out and was found adjacent to a flattened, swirled circle. Thatwas in Fort Myers in 1965. The witness was out hunting and saw a ball of light about 90feet in diameter and it made a humming sound. The ball of light came about eight feetclose to him and he blacked out. When he was found, the man was laying inside a 72-foot-diameter swirled circle of saw grass. He was taken to the hospital where he stayed forabout five days.DID THE BOY SCOUT LEADER OR ANYONE ELSE GET PHOTOGRAPHS OF THATCIRCLE? OR THE MAN IN FORT MYERS?I don't know. We don't have any in either files by Ted Phillips or MUFON. 1849 - Earliest Known American Crop FormationThe earliest known report in the United States that I've come across is from 1849. But Idon't have a location, so that's why it's not placed on this new map.WHAT WERE THE DETAILS?There was a report written and submitted to the federal government in 1849 by a mannamed Henry Schoolcraft, of which later on there was a college named after him:Schoolcraft College. Henry Schoolcraft was working for the Bureau of Indian Affairs andhe was going through the Midwest, meeting up with Indian tribes and doing earlydocumentation, tracking and writing down their mythology, their culture. He did this studybeing paid by the federal government.He submitted a report to Congress in 1849. One chapter in his report was entitled, 'TheMagic Circle in the Prairie.' It is a story told to him by a Native American who waswalking through one of the prairies in the Midwest and came across a flattened, swirledcircle in prairie grass and had a strange adventure inside it. There is no doubt that what hedescribed was a crop circle. But we don't have a location. 2003-2004 Alignments of Ohio Crop Formations"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Ohio Crop Formation Alignments Map for 2003 (blue line) and 2004 (yellow line) which cross near Ohio'sGreat Serpent Mound © 2004 by Jeffrey Wilson, ICCRA.My Ohio Crop Formation Alignments Map is for the last two seasons of 2003 to 2004 ofcrop formations reported in Ohio and Kentucky. That map with the two alignments of cropformations, and not earth mounds, from the past two years got started last year because wewent to several crop circles in Ohio, beginning with a formation that appeared near theGreat Serpent Mound (Locust Grove and Peebles). See: 09-05-03 Earthfiles. There wereseveral formations one in West Union (Adams County) and one near Bainbridge (RossCounty, Ohio). So, yellow line represents 2004 formations from Miamisburg through Cuba,Ohio (blue circle above Blanchester) through Hillsboro and ends on the map near Peeblesat the last 2004 formation which was in Scioto County. (See other 2004 Earthfiles reportsbelow.)Before in 2003, we received a report from a place called Hilltop, Kentucky, which issouthwest of Flemmingsburg, Kentucky. It appeared that all of the 2003 formations fromKentucky to Ohio fell along a pretty straight line if you connected the dots from Maysvilleto the Seip Mound. That struck us as being unusual. So, the blue line on the map connectsthe 2003 crop formations in Hilltop, Kentucky; West Union, Ohio; Serpent Moundformation in Locust Grove near Peebles; to the last formation in Bainbridge near the SeipMound. The blue line does not go directly through the Seip mound.We held a meeting earlier this year with several members of the ICCRA and one of thosemembers, Roger Sugden, was looking on the map at where we had held that meeting,which was near Cuba, Ohio. That is the blue dot on your map above Blanchester. Henoticed that there was also an alignment between the Miamisburg Mound and the TremperMound to the southeast in Portsmouth, Ohio. 2003 and 2004 Alignments Cross NearOhio's Great Serpent MoundHe had drawn a line on his paper map that only those of us at that small 12-person meetinglooked at. Subsequently, all of the crop circle formations in 2004 have fallen pretty muchon that line from the Tremper Mound to Miamisburg Mound. If you connect a linebetween the two, it would not fall exactly on the line, but if you connect all the cropformations that came down this year, they do fall on a line that crosses the 2003 line nearthe Great Serpent Mound.HAVE YOU TRIED TO EXTEND THE LINES TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY GOUP FURTHER THROUGH THE UNITED STATES AND INTO CANADA TO SEE IFTHERE ARE SIMILAR ALIGNMENTS FOLLOWING ALONG THOSE TWOALIGNMENTS?Yes, I did. I blew the line out to the southeast, all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. And Idrew the line going to the northwest all the way to the Pacific Ocean. My mappingprogram follows the curvature of the Earth so you get a nice smooth line. It goes all the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"way from coast to coast. I don't have all of Paul Anderson's data base map yet, so I can'ttell if his Canadian formations are connected on my U. S. line. But I will tell you that indrawing that specific line, there are about fifteen crop circles from the historical data in theUnited States falls upon.\"More Information:Other Earthfiles Reports About Crop Formations, 1999 to 2004· 09/22/2004 -- Miamisburg and Serpent Mound, Ohio Crop Formations: GeometriesCompared· 09/17/2004 -- Updated: Part 1 - High Strangeness in Canadian Cattle Corn· 09/12/2004 -- Part 2 - High Strangeness in Canadian Cattle Corn· 09/10/2004 -- Update on Miamisburg, Ohio, Corn Pictogram - Balls of Light?· 09/05/2004 -- Part 2 - Hillsboro, Ohio Corn Plant Anomalies· 09/04/2004 -- Hillsboro, Ohio Corn Formation - High Strangeness in Soil andPlants· 09/02/2004 -- Updated Photos: Big, Impressive New Corn Formation inMiamisburg, Ohio· 08/12/2004 -- Circles in Belgium and Holland· 08/09/2004 -- Pictograms in Poland· 07/26/2004 -- Crop Circles in Tilden, Wisconsin Oats and 90-Degree Angles inLitchfield, Minnesota Barley· 07/25/2004 -- 2004 Canadian Crop Formations: Scorched Soybeans and \"Dirt\"Pattern in Barley· 07/15/2004 -- Updated: Part 1-Beyond Hillsboro, Ohio, More Corn Down in NewMilford, Connecticut· 07/06/2004 -- Mysteriously Downed Oat Plants in Eagle Grove, Iowa, and DownedCorn in Hillsboro, Ohio· 07/06/2004 -- Additions to Spanish Fork, Utah Formation and Mysterious LightsSeen· 07/04/2004 -- Crop Formation in Spanish Fork, Utah· 06/17/2004 -- More 2004 Holland and Poland Crop Formations· 06/16/2004 -- England: 2004 Crop Formations and 2003 Research· 06/02/2004 -- 2004 Peach Orchard, Arkansas Crop Formation· 05/24/2004 -- Biophysicist W.
