I've got no words for this. I am flabbergasted. I am astonished. I amblown away. Opportunity has touched down in a bizarre alien landscape.\" -Steven Squyres, Principal Investigator, Cornell University Above and below: Opportunity's panorama camera shows rocky \"butte\" surrounded bydark \"sea of soil\"that is thought to be grey hematite, a very different mineral from the iron, olivine andnickel soilthat Spirit landed on in the Gusev crater. Image: NASA/JPL. January 25, 2004 Pasadena, California - Opportunity, NASA's second rover,landed on Mars five minutes after 9 p.m. in California and after midnight on theEast Coast as expected. Opportunity bounced down in its airbag-covered landeron to a smooth plane called Meridiani Planum near the equator half way aroundMars from the Gusev crater where the first damaged rover, Spirit, landed onJanuary 3, 2004. Opportunity's mission is to search for signs of water and itslanding marks and the soil look even muddier than the Gusev crater's.The Meridiani Planum is the highest altitude landing so far attempted by NASA"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"and might be a shallow crater. After coming through the Martian atmosphere at19,000 kilometers/hour, slowing down by a parachute and hitting the groundbouncing several times in cushioned airbags, Opportunity's communication withJPL mission controllers was lost for awhile. In fact, scientists at JPL thought thelander kept bouncing for twenty minutes after landing. Then JPL realized thatOpportunity's antenna was pointing downwards and the signal was bouncing offthe surface of Mars. Communications were restored and Opportunity has takendozens of photographs. Dr. Steve Squyres, lead scientist for the rovers, told The New York Times, \"I willattempt no science analysis, because it looks like nothing I've ever seen before.I've got no words for this.

Credit: NASA/JPL.Meridiani Planum Soil - \"Grey Hematite\"?Meridiani Planum is not expected to have the red soil of the Gusev Crater whereSpirit landed. Opportunity is surrounded by dark grey or black mineral thoughtto be \"grey hematite.\" Planetary geologists suspect that water once flowed there.The soil around Opportunity's wheels looks wet. But scientists are trying tofigure out if soil particles on Mars cling in a peculiar way due to electrostaticforces or some other phenomenon rather than actual H2O water molecules atthe surface which scientists have presumed would be dry dust. Future Rock and Soil ExplorationSo far, Opportunity seems to be operating well and the solar-powered rover isequipped with tools to scratch and drill into rocks and to examine the soil. If allgoes well, Opportunity should operate for at least the next three months.Ironically, it was exactly the moment just before Spirit was supposed to do itsfirst drilling into the pyramid-shaped rock in the Gusev crater that its data streamshut down. Spirit has not sent any images or scientific data since January 21st.NASA scientists don't want the same thing to happen to Opportunity, so there isan intense effort to understand Spirit's problems. NASA reported Saturday thatsome \"good progress\" has been made in repairing Spirit and the agency hopes tohave an answer about what went wrong.We b s it e s :http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/all/opportunity.htmlhttp://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.htmlhttp://www.esa.int/export/esaCP/index.htmlhttp://athena.cornell.eduCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
