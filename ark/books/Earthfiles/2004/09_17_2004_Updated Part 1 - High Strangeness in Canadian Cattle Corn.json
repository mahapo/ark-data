C. Canada - Canada has reported crop formationssince the mid-1990s all over the provinces but the region that has always had the mostpatterns for whatever reason has been Saskatchewan. Until 2004.Currently, Paul Anderson, Director of the Canadian Crop Circle Research Network -known as CCCRN - has a total of twelve crop formations reported in eleven sites, startingon on May 26, 2004, at Nahanni Butte, Northwest Territories.Left to right: Three confirmed crop formations in British Columbia (fourth \"Ankh\" described but not found);two huge tree circles in Northwest Territories; two in Alberta; one in Saskatchewan; three in Ontario;and one in New Brunswick. Map © 2004 by Paul Anderson, CCCRN.There, two circles were discovered in tall poplar trees. Paul reports that one tree circle was300 feet in diameter with all trees snapped off and flattened radially inward with the topspointing toward the center. This tree circle was half a mile from a second, larger one.estimated to be 500 feet in diameter! All those trees were also snapped off and flattenedradially inward with their tops pointing toward the center. Even though these large treecircles were discovered on May 26, Paul did not receive reports about them until August.When photographs are available, I'll report about them with Paul at Earthfiles.com.From May to September, in addition to the two tree circles in the Northwest Territories,there were four crop formations reported in three British Columbia locations, two inAlberta, three in Ontario, one in New Brunswick, and finally one in Saskatchewan reportedon September 2nd. This latest pattern is three ovals in mixed wheat and pasture grass inWadena, Saskatchewan - the same farming community that had an odd pattern of fourovals in barley last year, reported on August 19, 2003.Above: Wadena, Saskatchewan, four ovals in barley over a distance of 284 feet,reported August 19, 2003.

The mixed wheat and pasture grass had been laid down sogently that delicate dirt earthworm mounds right beneath the crops were not disturbed.Paul also discovered that even though the circles looked geometric, there was somethingodd about their centers.Wadena, Saskatchewan, three ovals in mixed wheat and pasture grassover a distance of about 73 feet, reported on September 2, 2004.

Mr.Hemtun writes about the dots and cross in square: \"On the sketch to a sun square atHögsbyn Dal, there is a footprint with an askew stroke and the marks perhaps (meaning)the polestar as well as the pole pillar. The use of a settlement pole seems to have beencustom in many places and as far as Siberia. At Rock 1 Haugsbyn, we see Little Bear andstar Koshab is marked with a crossed square that should mean, \"use this\" as polestar. Thatwould have fit around 2000 BC. The head of the big figure at the Evenstorp carvingsseems to be Little Bear and the body is Big Bear with a foot in Regulus in Leo that maybehave been fix star for the rising node. They often mention Thuban in Dragon as polestar.That would have fitted around 3100 BC.\"Interview:Paul Anderson, Director, Canadian Crop Circle Research Network (CCCRN),Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada:Wadena, Saskatchewan, Canada - Reported September 2, 2004\"IS THE WADENA 2004 PATTERN IN CIRCLES OR OVALS?All three are slightly elliptical and I should note, too, that the center of each one is offcenter, which is of course is another feature that has been noted over and over again informations like this over the years.YES, IT'S A PUZZLE TO THE GEOMETRY PEOPLE WHY SHOULD THERE BENON-GEOMETRICAL CENTERS TO PATTERNS THAT OTHERWISE SEEMGEOMETRICAL?Yes. And it's also been taken as a sign to probably indicate genuineness, because if youmanually create a circle just using boards, rope and what have you in most cases you'll getsomething like a perfect circle with the center pretty much dead center. And yet we find alot like this one where the center is sometimes way off center sometimes several feet fromthe actual geometric center of the circle or oval. Often times there is also a beautiful tightlay of the crop which we have again in this case. Delicate Earthworm Mounds UndisturbedBeneath Flattened CropOne of our CCCRN Saskatchewan researchers, Beata Van Berkom, found small earthwormmounds in the soil just beneath the flattened crop. They did not appear to be disturbed atall. The ground was quite dry, drier inside the formation than outside of it, she reported.The small little worm clumps are delicate if you touch them, they will fall apart quiteeasily. But they appeared to still be intact beneath the flattened plants.One of the small, undisturbed earthworm diggings (\"dirt balls\") found beneath the flattened"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"wheat and pasture grass inside one of the three Wadena, Saskatchewan ovals reported September 2, 2004.Photograph © Beata Van Berkom, CCCRN Saskatchewan.Calgary, Alberta, Canada - Reported August 26, 2004The one in Calgary was reported August 26. This was different and unusual in that it wasfound in pasture grass in a large nature park just on the outskirts of town. We've had oneslike this before and ones in pasture grass have been fairly common in this country. But thisone is a single ring. Again, it's an oval, not a true circle. But the ring itself is only about 12to 18 inches wide.Forty-foot-diameter oval in pasture grass surrounding a natural white rock on hill above Calgary, Alberta,Canada,reported August 26, 2004. Width of ring was about eighteen inches. Photograph © Cielia Kaufman, CCCRNAlberta.What was interesting about it is that the ring was centered around a large, white rockwhich was just sitting in the field. The rock itself appeared to be part of the landscape. Itdidn't look like someone had placed it there. The rock ended up being almost dead centerin the ring. The 1.5-foot-wide ring was made up of grass flattened in all different directions.Some of the lay was actually going straight across the width of the ring, so it was not asimple case of some one walking around in a ring and just flattening down the crop withyour feet or something. You have the lay of the grass which is at all different directions,going on top of each other in two or three layers sometimes.Above: There seems to be a rhythm to the way the pasture grass was laid down in the ring,even if the grass was laid in different directions, as shown in the close-up be low.Photograph © 2004 by © Cielia Kaufman, CCCRN Alberta."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Close-up pasture grass laid down in different directions inside the Calgary ring pattern.Photograph © 2004 by © Cielia Kaufman, CCCRN Alberta.AS WE HAVE FOUND IN VARIOUS PATTERNS AROUND THE WORLD, WERETHERE ANY INDICATIONS THAT PLANTS BELOW THE SURFACE MIGHT BEGOING 180 DEGREES OR 90 DEGREES TO THE SURFACE PLANTS?In some cases, yes, where you had plants going different directions overlapping it would beat approximately 90 degrees in some cases. You would have a flow of plants flattenedgoing in one direction and then you'll have another bunch on top of that going as much as90 degrees to that. That's what I meant by opposing directions, but it was all mixed in alldifferent parts of the ring. Matsqui, British Columbia, Canada - Early August 2004Matsqui is between Abbotsford and Mission where large crop formations in tall cattle cornhave been reported in previous years.

C., about 50 to60 miles or so, has become some what of a hot spot. All the formations in this area havebeen in the same type of cattle corn, which is different from the sweet corn which we alsohave around here. But interestingly, for whatever reasons, all the formations so far have"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"been in this taller cattle corn.Paul Anderson, Director, CCCRN, standing in the Abbotsford, British Columbia,Canada, 9 - 10 feet tall cattle corn formation reported August 13, 2003. Photograph © 2003 by CCCRN.These two formations in Matsqui were located only two or three miles or so from thelocation of the big one in Abbotsford last summer. Both of the new ones were seen at thesame time by a woman who had gone skydiving in early August (exact date not known)and as the plane was ascending, she noticed one pattern that looked to her like an ancientEgyptian ankh symbol.18th Dynasty ankh, symbol of eternal life force, from the reignof Amenhotep II made of wood. Image from TourEgypt.(Editor's Note: Taylor Ray Ellison writes at his TourEgypt website: \"The Ancient Ankhwas, for the ancient Egyptians, the symbol and hieroglyphic sign of life. ... The ankh seemsat least to be an evolved form of, or associated with the Egyptian glyph for magicalprotection, sa. It is at least interesting that the ankh word was used for mirrors from at leastthe Middle Kingdom onward, and that indeed, many mirrors were shaped in the form of anankh sign. Life and death mirror each other, and in any number of ancient religions,mirrors were used for purposes of divination. As the Christian era eclipsed Egypt'spharaonic pagan religion, the sign was adapted by the Coptic church as their unique formof a cross, known as the crux ansata.\")Paul Anderson: \"Then just a few moments after that, the skydiver spotted the second cropformation which is a circle with two crescents, one crescent on either side of the circle. Sofar, we have found the crescents formation, but we are still looking to find the Egyptianankh symbol. We know the approximate location where it has to be based on where shetook off in a plane and where this crescent one is because the other has to be in betweensomewhere."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Matsqui, British Columbia, Canada, circle and two crescents in tall cattle corn covering 174 feet (53 meters),reported in early August 2004 by skydiver who saw this pattern and a second, nearby \"ankh\" patternfrom ascending airplane.
