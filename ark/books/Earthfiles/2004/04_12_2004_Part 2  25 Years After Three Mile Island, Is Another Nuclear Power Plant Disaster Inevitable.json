Photograph by Rad Journal. Click here for Part 1April 12, 2004 Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and Washington, D. C. - One man who haslived in Harrisburg all his life is Scott Portzline, Security Consultant for Three Mile IslandAlert. Born in 1958, Scott was twenty years old when TMI's Unit 2 reactor began to meltdown. Five years later in 1984, he wanted to know the truth about what had caused thenear-meltdown. A decade later, Scott had lost confidence in government explanations andbegan to question how much radiation had escaped from the TMI reactor. What hadradioactive contamination done to the people, plants, animals and insects? Why did thegovernment and nuclear industry tell the public that only small quantities of radiation hadbeen released with exposures far below levels that could affect health? In fact, the NuclearRegulatory Commission (NRC) and the 1979 President's Commission on the Accident atThree Mile Island concluded that the maximum possible radiation dose beyond Three MileIsland was less than average annual background levels. How was that possible if up to 13 million curies of radioactive gases and up to 17 curies ofradioactive iodine were released during the disaster? Scott became increasingly disturbed by what he learned and his research has been cited bythe U. S. Department of Energy, Stanford and Harvard Universities, and various militarybranches.Interview:Scott Portzline, Security Consultant, Three Mile Island Alert, Harrisburg,Pennsylvania: \"Just one curie is 37 billion radioactive disintegrations per second, and eachdisintegration has the potential to harm a human cell. If we multiply 37 billiondisintegrations per second by the 13 million curies released at Three Mile Island in 1979,we get a number so big that you have to state it scientifically: 4.81 x 10 to the 17th power.It's actually billions of chances each second for the radioactivity to find and damage cellsthat can potentially lead to cancer or leukemia or other problems. And the NRC and theindustry want to tell us that nobody around Three Mile Island was even harmed from it.That's impossible!

But listen to the track record of the industry justin the last half of March 2004. We do see and are concerned that another accident (likeTMI) is just a couple of years away as all the nuclear plants age.- So far, there have been 8 reactor scrams.- 2 manual shut downs.- 1 low level emergency declared at the St. Lucie plant in Florida during re-fuelingwhen a reactor coolant started leaking.- The high pressure injection systems were found inoperable at 3 plants. Two plantswere in Pennsylvania the Peach Bottom and Limerick plants and this is a majorsafety system.- Cracks were found in the Susquehanna Pennsylvania reactor.-Both emergency diesel generators were found inoperable at the Cooper plant inNebraska.- It was discovered that an earthquake could cause electrical short circuits at theWolf Creek reactor in Kansas.- Three workers were injured when their bucket truck contacted a high voltage lineat the Susquehanna reactor.- And a fourth worker injured his hand when a grinder he was using lost powerduring that event and he lost control of the grinder.- Two supervisors were found to be on drugs, one at Turkey Point in Florida andanother at Callaway in Missouri.- Two incidents of controlled substance testing were positive in the workers.- A guard shot himself in the leg at San Onofre in California.- The NRC released a press release on the disturbing re-licensing exam failure ratesof the control room operators at Cooper Station, Nebraska.\" Most Recent Near-Disaster at Davis-BesseNuclear Power Plant Near Toledo, Ohio, Spring 2002Large hole eaten away by leaking boric acid from a cracked reactor drive nozzle at the Davis Bessenuclear power plant in Toledo, Ohio. Discovered in 6-inch steel casing and photographed in spring 2002. Plantshut downto avoid potential core melt down. Photograph from Nucle ar Re gulatory Commission.In the spring of 2001, the Ocone nuclear power station near Greenville, South Carolina,which is a sister plant to both Davis-Besse (Toledo, Ohio) and Three Mile Island(Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) found some cracked pipes. These pipes passed through the verytop of the nuclear reactor vessel and the cracks allowed reactor cooling water to leak out ofthe vessel. Because of that discovery, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) askedthat all nuclear power plants with similar configurations look at the pipes and see if theyhad cracks and to fix them or verify that they were crack-free.Davis-Besse was one such plant and one of the oldest in the United States. The NRC staff"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"was so concerned about safety at Davis-Besse that in September and October of 2001, theydrafted an order that would require Davis-Besse to shut down for safety reasons. Theowner did not want to shut down the plant. So, the owner came in and met with the NRCstaff in October and November of 2001 and provided reasons why they thought the plantwas safe to keep operating. The NRC looked at that information and ultimately agreed withthe plant's owner and did not require the plant to shut down.But later in the spring of 2002, when the plant was finally shut down for a scheduledre-fueling outage, very serious cracks in the nuclear reactor vessel were found, boric acidwas leaking out of those cracks and had eroded a large hole through the 6-inch steelcladding in the reactor vessel beneath Nozzles 1, 2 and 3.Scott Portzline told me, \"When I first saw the photograph of the hole that was eaten intothe Davis-Besse reactor, I could hardly believe it. We realized that we were really luckythat Toledo did not have a nuclear accident and studies indicated that we were just a monthor so away from it (potential melt down event).\"Undetected, that ever-widening hole at Davis-Besse would have lead to a core melt downevent. Once that near-miss was discovered, the NRC started investigating more closely.The investigators learned that information given to the NRC by Davis-Besse in Octoberand November of 2001 - that allowed the plant to continue running - had been falsified. Davis-Besse Owners Lied to NRCin Fall 2001 About Inspection and RepairsDavid Lochbaum, Nuclear Safety Engineer, Union of Concerned Scientists,Washington, D. C.: \"The Davis-Besse plant's owner (FirstEnergy) had said, for example,that it had fully inspected those pipe areas in 2000, 1998 and 1996 the last opportunities ithad to do so. But in fact, the company owner knew that it had NOT done that. It hadinspected part, but not the entire area. They misrepresented the truth or lied to the NRCand said they had looked everywhere and had found no problems.In addition, as further proof of that, the Davis-Besse owner had showed the NRCvideotapes they had made during those inspections. The inspections were only done incertain areas. But to convince the NRC that they had done more, the Davis-Besse ownersbasically altered the videotape and represented it as showing the entire top of the reactorwhen it only showed a small portion of it.So both in writing, words and in video, Davis-Besse misrepresented the actual condition ofthe plant to the NRC and deluded the NRC into allowing the plant to continue running attremendous risk to the public.WHAT ARE THE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS FOR THIS?Once the NRC discovered it had been lied to, they had the NRC police which is called theOffice of Investigations go through and interview people under oath. They assembled alarge case of wrong doing. The NRC then turned the case over to the U. S. Department ofJustice (DOJ) which impaneled a grand jury. The grand jury subpoenaed a bunch of recordsfrom the Davis-Besse company and the grand jury continues its deliberations to this day. Sofar, no actions have been taken against the Davis-Besse company or the individualsinvolved.\" (Howe emphasis.)Above: Cracked Nozzle # 3 (missing in this photograph) was undergoing repairs when a piece of nozzle sleevefell into hole.That lead to discovering the nozzle hole was filled with leaking boric acid.

The outer shell isregular carbon steel and that is where the boric acid was eating inward toward the innershell. Boric acid was leaking out of a reactor drive mechanism nozzle and it was eatingthrough the steel to the point where the only thing protecting us from a terrible accidentwere 3/8th-inch of carbon steel. When you look at the newest photographs, you can see thecracks starting in that carbon steel and it was bulging outward from the pressure of theheated water in the reactor that is pressurized so it does not turn to steam. We were very,very close to a disastrous situation.WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SCENARIO IF A HOLE HAD BROKEN THROUGHTHAT CARBON STEEL?These reactors are under very high pressures, so the moment that a hole is breached in thereactor, you have what's called 'loss of coolant accident.' It was believed until Three MileIsland that such a small break would not cause a problem. The NRC really didn't study it.That's one of the problems at TMI they didn't even study the effects of small breaks.But that type of pressure from the water shooting out could damage nearby equipment andcould cause electrical short circuits and would increase the size of that hole until it releasedall the pressurized gases. And then the water inside the reactor itself can start to boil awayand you have a loss of coolant accident where the fuel can melt. In the meantime, there aregoing to be systems trying to overcome the problem that has developed. One of thosesystems is where the control rods drop into place in a scam, provided the water sprayingout of the area under high pressure does not interfere. The control rods are located in thesame spot. The spraying water could work against dropping the control rods into place.Then you might not be able to get the control rods inserted in time. Without that, you havea smaller chance and more difficult task of halting the nuclear chain reaction and theywould have to dump borated water neutron-killing water into the reactor. Of course, someof that is going to boil away and you have a boron release into the containment building,plus all the other radionuclei.That's one thing we saw here in TMI the boric acid and the boron were released into the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"atmosphere along with many radionucleides. People had a metallic taste in their mouths.After that, good luck trying to control that reactor because some of the normal things youwould do to control the situation, such as adding water but which is continuing to boilaway. The pressures get so high inside the containment building that they have no choicebut to release what is inside the containment building to the air in a controlled release ifthey have that much control and you have a general emergency declared where evacuationwill be required.\"Notice By NRC About Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station's Deterioration:\"Overview of Reactor Vessel Head Degradation On February 16, 2002, the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station in Oak Harbor, Ohio,began a refueling outage that included inspecting the nozzles entering the head of thereactor pressure vessel (RPV), the specially designed container that houses thereactor core and the control rods that regulate the power output of the reactor. Ofthese vessel head penetration (VHP) nozzles, the licensee's inspections focused onthe nozzles associated with the mechanism that drives the control rods, known as thecontrol rod drive mechanism (CRDM). Both the inspections and their focus wereconsistent with the licensee's commitments in response to NRC Bulletin 2001-01,'Circumferential Cracking of Reactor Pressure Vessel Head Penetration Nozzles,'which the agency issued on August 3, 2001. In conducting its inspections, the licensee found that three CRDM nozzles hadindications of axial cracking, which had resulted in leakage of the reactor's pressureboundary. Specifically, the licensee found these indications in CRDM nozzles 1, 2,and 3, which are located near the center of the RPV head. The licensee reportedthese findings to the NRC on February 27, 2002, and provided supplementalinformation on March 5 and March 9, 2002. The licensee also decided to repair thethree leaking nozzles, as well as two other nozzles that had indications of leakage buthad not resulted in pressure boundary leakage. The repair of these nozzles included roll expanding the CRDM nozzle material intothe material of the surrounding RPV head and then machining along the axis of theCRDM nozzle to a point above the indications in the nozzle material. On March 6,2002, the licensee prematurely terminated the machining process on CRDM nozzle 3and removed the machining apparatus from the nozzle. During the removal, thenozzle was mechanically agitated and subsequently displaced (or tipped) in thedownhill direction (away from the top of the RPV head) until its flange contacted theflange of the adjacent CRDM nozzle. To identify the cause of the displacement, the licensee investigated the condition ofthe RPV head surrounding CRDM nozzle 3. This investigation included removing theCRDM nozzle from the RPV head, removing boric acid deposits from the top of theRPV head, and ultrasonically measuring the thickness of the RPV head in the vicinityof CRDM nozzles 1, 2, and 3. Upon completing the boric acid removal on March 7, 2002, the licensee conducted avisual examination of the area, which identified a large cavity in the RPV head onthe downhill side of CRDM nozzle 3. Follow-up characterization by ultrasonic testingindicated wastage of the low alloy steel RPV head material adjacent to the nozzle.The wastage area was found to extend approximately 5 inches downhill on the RPVhead from the penetration for CRDM nozzle 3 and was approximately 4 to 5 inchesat its widest part. The minimum remaining thickness of the RPV head in the wastagearea was found to be approximately 3/8 inch. This thickness was attributed to thethickness of the stainless steel cladding on the inside surface of the RPV head, whichis nominally 3/8 inch thick. The investigation of the causative conditions surrounding the degradation of the RPVhead at Davis-Besse is continuing. Boric acid or other contaminants could becontributing factors. Other factors contributing to the degradation might include theenvironment of the RPV head during both operating and shutdown conditions (e.g.,wet/dry), the duration for which the RPV head is exposed to boric acid, and thesource of the boric acid (e.g., leakage from the CRDM nozzle or from sources abovethe RPV head such as CRDM flanges).\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Above: Top bolted domed head to nuclear reactor vessel at Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station inApril 2000.Red streams running down the side toward 25-inch-long grey bolts are from boric acid leaking from thelarge holeeaten away into the steel under Nozzle 3.

So Far, No Legal Action Against Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Plant OwnersDavid Lochbaum, Union of Concerned Scientists: \"The Davis-Besse plant owners(FirstEnergy) and the NRC claim that the individuals who may have been responsible weretransferred away from Davis-Besse and whether they are implicated or not ultimately bythe grand jury, they are not in any position of authority at Davis-Besse. Even if that weretrue, the lack of justice to this date is insufficient because the people who are now atDavis-Besse need to know that the NRC will hold them accountable for lying about safety.In addition, if the guilty parties are no longer at Davis-Besse, but are at other nuclear powerplants, well that's just moving a problem around. That's not solving it.WHY WOULD THEY HAVE LIED IN THE FIRST P LACE?At the time this was all happening, the Davis-Besse company was going through a mergerand acquisition with another utility. There were stock implications, price implicationsassociated with the stock and what it was selling at in the fall of 2001. Had the plant beenshut down, the price of the stock would likely have declined. That deal would have comearound much differently than if all the bad news could have been pushed into the NewYear after the deal was over.In addition, part of the reason the company lied was that they had experienced problemsfor a number of years, but those problems never lead to disasters. As annoying as thoseproblems were, they thought they could live with them and they didn't want the NRC toknow about those problems because it was an in-house issue that they were dealing with -or not dealing with much like the Challenger and Columbia disasters. There were a numberof events prior to the final tragedies that weren't fully appreciated in their full dimensions.The Davis-Besse company knew they had problems. They just didn't understand the fulldimensions of those problems until it was too late.BUT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE DAVIS-BESSE OWNERS LYING ABOUTWHAT WAS ESSENTIALLY THE BIGGEST NEAR-DISASTER SINCE THREE MILE"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"ISLAND 25 YEARS AGO. THAT LARGE HOLE IN THE NUCLEAR REACTORVESSEL WALL COULD HAVE BEEN DISASTROUS.But to be fair to the company, there is no evidence that they knew about the hole until2002. But, they knew there were conditions that could allow a hole to develop. And theyknew the pipes that ultimately caused the hole were likely to be cracked and leaking andthat is the information they withheld from the NRC the condition of the piping and thecracks in the piping. It's not clear they knew about the hole. But in some respects, thatdistinction is mute. Davis-Besse plant operators lied to the NRC about conditions at theplant, particularly when the NRC was preparing to shut the plant down for safety reasons.They lied to the NRC about the safety of the plant and that is inexcusable. (Howeemphases)WE'RE AT 2004 - WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO HAPPEN LEGALLY?Unfortunately, the NCR's track record on cases like this is not very good. Twice in therecent past, the NRC has allowed the 5 year statute of limitations to expire before theytook action. Because the 5 year statute of limitations expired, they couldn't take any actionagainst the individuals guilty for violating federal regulations. The clock is running on thisone. We are hoping that that injustice is not repeated again.WHO CAN YOU APPEAL TO AS THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS?When we did the legal memo last year, we sent that directly to the Dept. of Justice becausethe NRC had not yet finished its investigation and it looked like it might never finish itsinvestigation. When we heard nothing back from the DOJ except an acknowledgement thatthey had received our package, we then went to the State of Ohio and met with theAttorney General's office. The Ohio Attorney General's office was interested in the issuebut felt they lacked jurisdiction. It was really the NRC and DOJ who at some point had totake action. They were very sympathetic, but their hands were tied. Ultimately, we have noappeal. We have to help the federal government do the job that it is entrusted with.SO, WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT LYING ON THE PART OF THE DAVIS-BESSESTAFF IN 2001 COULD EXPIRE WITH A 5 YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ANDNOTHING BEING DONE?It's happened in the past. And on the current pace, it looks like it will happen again. Theproblem is that if workers and managers at nuclear power plants know that they can getaway with such a heinous crime just by dragging their feet and not cooperating with aninvestigation, they are going to do it. The NRC needs to show that it puts safety and thepublic health ahead of the convenience of plant owners and workers. That foolishnessneeds to stop.WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO CHANGE THE LAW SO THERE COULD BE MORETEETH IN PUNISHING PEOPLE WHO TRY TO GET AWAY WITH THIS KIND OFLIE?That's a good question. We've looked at that question in the past. Unfortunately, theobstacle of the Catch-22 you're up against is that the current law has sufficient teeth if thelawmaker was just of a mind to enforce it. So, the problem isn't that the law is weak. It'sthat the regulator is weak. We need to have the NRC step up to the plate, get off the benchand get into the game and be the public guardian that is expected of them. Right now, it'snot doing that.WHEN YOU WENT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE STATE OF OHIO, WHATHAPPENED?The A.G. looking at the evidence that we prepared was amazed that the NRC had not doneanything. They felt there was an issue and need to take action. But they felt they did nothave the jurisdiction to take that step. They felt it was the NCR's job to take the next stepand wished us luck in getting the NRC to take that next step.In some respects, the people living in and around Toledo can take some comfort in the factthat over the past two years, many millions of dollars have gone into restoring safetymargins at that plant and replacing some of those (former workers) who were responsible(for lying about looking for cracked pipes). In some respects, that plant (Davis-Besse) issafer.DO YOU KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THE SAME PEOPLE WHO LIED ATDAVIS-BESSE ARE STILL WORKING AT NUCLEAR POWER PLANTSSOMEWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES?At first, they moved from Davis-Besse to other operating plants and now have goneelsewhere. Over time, we have lost track of them because their movements are hard to"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"follow and it's hard to know where they are today. But many of them went fromDavis-Besse to other nuclear power plants in the first move.\" How Many American Nuclear Power Plants Today Have Flawed Drains andPumps?Outrage about the Davis-Besse nuclear power plant deterioration and indications the drainsand pumps were flawed when the plant opened twenty-seven years ago was expressed byreporter and writer Matt Bivens on March 10, 2004, in his \"The Daily Outrage\" columnfor The Nation:Matt Bivens, \"The Daily Outrage,\" The Nation, March 10, 2004: \"The (Davis-Besse) plant's operators reported to the NRC that key backup systems -- a series ofdrains and pumps to keep a runaway reactor fed with coolant water -- had beenflawed ever since the plant opened 27 years ago. The company's report admitted thatin an accident, the pumps would probably not have worked properly. The NRCstudied this report and declared it to be a code 'yellow' finding, 'one of substantialimportance to safety.' But as I reported in The Nation six months ago, this problem with the backup drainsand coolant pumps exists at 68 other, similar-designed nuclear reactors acrossAmerica. Yet only Davis-Besse has addressed it. And this is so despite a shockingstudy by the nuclear-industry-friendly Los Alamos National Laboratory, whichsuggested that this problem represents a one-in-three chance of disaster at anAmerican nuclear power plant over the next three years. (The NRC's response wasthat they'd fix the problem in ... four years.) The Los Alamos study went reactor by reactor across America, calculating a risklevel for each plant -- and back then, before Davis-Besse made any improvements,Davis-Besse was considered one of the least risky plants. One of the most risky wasthe Indian Point reactor complex outside New York city. Yet the NRC, which judgedthe problem at Davis-Besse to be a 'yellow' alert, ignored calls to have the sameproblem tackled at Indian Point. What kind of logic is that? Answer: the best logicthat money can buy, of course.\" What Can Be Done to Regenerate 103 Aging Nuclear Power Plants?Scott Portzline, Three Mile Island Alert: \"Some plants need to be shut down andoverhauled and some probably should not even be restarted. The economics of these plantsis bad to begin with, so a business decision might be made to close down a plantpermanently. The chances of regenerating nuclear power in this industry can only be drivenby political will. The business will is not there at this point it's not economically viable.We're seeing the political will of the current Administration that has relaxed pollutionstandards, yet wants to tax coal because of the pollution to create a favorable environmentfor nuclear power economics.This is totally backwards. They should be encouraging wind turbines which could actuallygenerate enough electricity to supply 100% of this country's energy needs. I thought thatnumber was ridiculous, but there was an expanded study originally done by the Dept. ofEnergy that showed that using wind turbines and the electricity to convert hydrogen tocreate hydrogen and use the hydrogen in future technologies that are doable, some now andsome that we can phase in gradually, would solve all of our problems and we wouldn't haveto have anything to do with these nuclear Edsels.We are trying to take old cars, basically, and keep them safe on our highways. Except thistime, the risk could be we could lose the entire state of Pennsylvania.\"Continued in Part 3.More Information:Mary Osborn, photographer and member of Three Mile Island Alert (Earthfiles Part I),gave a presentation of her plant evidence in Washington, D.C. a few weeks ago.

In addition,I ask that you provide me with a copy of all such documents. As you know, the 25 year anniversary of the TMI accident was on March 28, 2004.On that date. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Chairman Nils Diaz told CNNthat 'Three Mile Island was not really a disaster in radiological terms. There was nosignificant amount of radiation released, nobody was hurt.' The NRC also stated in its publicity materials released for the TMI anniversary thatTMI brought 'about sweeping changes involving emergency response planning,reactor operator training, human factors engineering, radiation protection, and manyother areas of nuclear power plant operations. It also caused the U.S. NuclearRegulatory Commission to tighten and heighten its regulatory oversight. Resultantchanges in the nuclear power industry and at the NRC had the effect of enhancingsafety.' You may be aware that Presidential Executive Order 13292 Part 3, which waspublished on March 25, 2003. states that 'Our democratic principles require that theAmerican people be informed of the activities of their Government,' that 'informationshall be declassified as soon as it no longer meets the standards for classificationunder this order,' and ultimately calls for automatic declassification of documentsthat are more than 25 years old. The only materials that would be exempt from theautomatic declassification requirements would be those that would threaten nationalor homeland security or those that reveal the identity of a confidential human source. It is in the public interest to disclose all documents related to TMI; Numerousmembers of the communities living near TMI have been attempting to obtain thesedocuments for years in order to ascertain additional details regarding the radiationlevels they may have been exposed to. Moreover, Americans have the right to beinformed of the activities of their Government during and subsequent to the country'smost serious nuclear reactor accident. If, as was stated by Commission ChairmanDiaz to CNN, no significant amount of radiation was released, shouldn't interestedparties be able to review the documents themselves in order to be sure?
