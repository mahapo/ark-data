The roverapplied its flower-like 6-position rock abrasion tool brush mosaic on the rock called\"Mazatzal.\" Below it is the ring drilled previously.This animation show the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity brushing bright materials offa circular patch of the rock dubbed \"Mazatzal.\" The freshly exposed rock was investigatedby instruments on the rover's arm on sol 80 (March 25, 2004). On sol 81, Opportunity usedits rock abrasion tool, also located on its arm, to grind into the cleaned-off rock.

In addition, Spirit took sky and ground stares and panoramiccamera images of the upcoming drive direction. The sol ended with mini thermal emissionspectrometer stares at the \"Columbia Hills.\" Sol 87, which ends at 3:00 p.m. PST on April1, 2004, will be a driving day for Spirit as it begins what could be a record-breaking journeytoward the Columbia Hills. The range of peaks named \"Columbia Hills\" is an island of olderrock surrounded by a younger volcanic layer which surfaces the plain that Spirit has beencrossing.Mazatzal Rock is on left and Columbia Hills in the distance in panoramic photograph taken by the Spirit Roverafter it had drilled and examined the Mazatzal rock. Original images at: NASA/JPL/Cornell.Older rocks may hold evidence of an ancient body of water thought to have once filledGusev Crater. Spirit landed inside that 150-kilometer-wide (95-mile-wide) crater 12 weeksago, and the rover's main task is to find geological clues about whether the region ever hada wet environment. Spirit has spent much of its time since landing driving toward a200-meter-wide (660-foot-wide) crater nicknamed \"Bonneville.\" Rover scientists hadanticipated that the impact that excavated Bonneville might have ejected rocks old enoughto hold clues about whether Gusev held water.\"The ejecta from Bonneville did not get excavated from deep enough to get below thevolcanic layer,\" said Dr. Ray Arvidson of Washington University, St. Louis. He is deputyprincipal investigator for the science payload on both Spirit and its twin rover, Opportunity.So, now after the work at the Mazatzal rock, Spirit is on its way to explore Columbia Hills.Above: panorama by Spirit Rover of the Bonneville Crater.Be low: NASA's graphic interpretation of Spirit after its rocky climb to the edge of theBonneville Crater.

During the Martian morning,the miniature thermal emission spectrometer and panoramic camera studied theatmosphere. \"Bounce\" rock was imaged by the panoramic camera.Opportunity Rover approaching the \"Bounce\" rock with Right Front Hazard Camera Non-linearizedDownsampled EDR acquired on Sol 65 of Opportunity's mission to Meridiani Planum atapproximately 11:59:38 Mars local solar time. Image credit: NASA/JPL.Opportunity's instrument arm was then deployed to get a close-up view of \"Bounce\" usingthe microscopic imager. The rock abrasion tool team used some of these images to identifythe exact target for next sol's grinding operation. The Moessbauer spectrometer was thenplaced on a designated target on the rock for an overnight integration. Next sol, the rover'srock abrasion tool will grind into Bounce. Different Soils Examined by Opportunity in Meridiani Planum\"We're seeing the effects of differences in wind speed,\" said Bethany Ehlmann, a scienceteam collaborator from the Washington University, St. Louis. In some patches more thanothers, winds have removed small particles and left large particles behind, she explained."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"This mosaic of microscopic images (each about two centimeters by two centimeters or .8 inches by .8 inches)from the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity illustrates the tremendous variety of soil types and shapesobservedby the science team during the recent \"Eagle Crater\" five-target soil survey. Scientists are working tounderstandthe sorting mechanisms that have distributed the various soil types. The survey wasconducted from sol 52 to sol 56. Image credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell/USGS.\"Punaluu's\" largest particles are similar to those seen in the \"Eagle Crater\" outcrop. Thereare also some smaller, more irregular rounded particles that have likely been transported bywind.\"Lanikai\" target reveals irregularly shaped, light-colored, millimeter-sized (0.04inch-sized) clasts, or particles, in a fine-grained soil. Lanikai's angular, less-rounded clastshapes interested the science team when compared to other soil targets in the crater areastudied by the microscopic imager.\"Mudpie\" is representative of the soils lower in the crater, a fair distance from theoutcrop. It contains spherules and irregularly shaped vesicles held in a dark sand.\"Neopolitan\" highlights the border between two different soil types - a lighter, finer-grained unit to the left and a darker, coarser-grained to the right. Scientists are ponderingthe unusually distinct border between these different soil types.\"Cookies and Cream\" is a mixture of light and dark soil units in the \"Neopolitan\" area.There are several different types of clasts, or particles, held in surrounding fine-grainedsands: rounded spherules, angular, irregular fragments (containing what are presumablyvesicles or small cavities) and smaller, about one millimeter-sized (0.04 inch-sized),rounded clasts. At \"Vanilla,\" the microscopic images have revealed small grains onemillimeter (0.04 inch) or less in size and somewhat lighter in color than those in other soilunits observed in the crater.\"Black Forest\" area at the target referred to as \"Brian's Choice\" are irregularly shapedclasts, low in hematite content based on miniature thermal emission spectrometer readings.Presumably, the particles in this area are more affected by winds since they are on theouter part of crater and are likely deposited and re-distributed by wind on a fairly frequentbasis.The Spherules Are Hematite Source in Meridiani Planumand Linked to Past Water"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Image credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell/USGS/University of Mainz.This figure shows spectra, or light signatures, taken by the Mars Exploration RoverOpportunity's Mössbauer spectrometer at various spots in \"Eagle Crater.\" From top tobottom, the spectra represent soil measurements taken from the center of the crater and outto the rim. The top spectrum taken on sol 56 near the center of the crater shows a basalticmineral composition and only minor amounts of hematite. Basalts are volcanic mineralsand hematite is an iron-bearing mineral often formed in water. Moving closer to the rim,the spectra show increasing amounts of hematite with the \"Punaluu\" site containing thehighest amounts seen to date on Mars. Only minor basaltic components are seen in thissample.The corresponding microscopic image of Punaluu shows a high density of spherules,or\"blueberries,\" indicating that these sphere-like grains are responsible for the observedhigh levels of hematite. The spherules are plentiful in some soil patches higher on the innerslope of the crater than near the center of the crater. A reading by Opportunity's Mössbauerspectrometer on one of the higher patches found the highest concentration of hematite seenso far in the mission, reported Dr. Goestar Klingelhoefer of the University of Mainz,Germany. He is the lead scientist for that instrument, which is used for identifyingiron-containing minerals. The type of hematite Opportunity has been finding usually formson Earth under wet environmental conditions.UpcomingBeginning next week and continuing into the extended mission, Spirit's controllers willswitch from working on Mars time - with schedules set to coincide with day or night atGusev crater - to an Earth time schedule easier to maintain for the long haul. TheOpportunity team will shift the following week.Opportunity is also at the start of a trek. This week, it climbed out of the small impactcrater informally named \"Eagle Crater\" that it had been examining since it landed nineweeks ago. Rocks in an outcrop within the crater have provided evidence that the site wasonce under flowing water. In coming weeks, Opportunity will drive about 750 meters(nearly half a mile) to a crater nicknamed \"Endurance,\" where scientists hope to find andexamine a thicker set of bedrock layers to learn more about the duration of the region's wethistory.Websites:http://www.esa.int/export/SPECIALS/Mars_Express/http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.htmlhttp://athena.cornell.eduCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Republication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
