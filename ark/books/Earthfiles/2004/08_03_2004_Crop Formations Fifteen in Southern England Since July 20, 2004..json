Graham Tucker reported that the Nashenden Farm crop formation in Wouldham nearRochester, Kent, was \"placed in a field which borders on an ancient way now known asthe North Down Way, and very close to a tumulus that's hidden within the surroundingcopse. The formation is almost directly opposite the Water Board pumping station atWouldham, separated by the new Channel Tunnel rail link. We spoke to a guy who liveswithin these confines and he said it wasn't there the previous evening, but to his surprise itwas there at 4.30 a.m. (July 31, 2004). His friends were camping overnight in a caravanvery close to the field and they didn't hear or see a thing! We are grateful to the micro lightpilot from Rochester Airport who alerted us to this formation.\"Diagram © 2004 by Bertold Zugelder.2) West Kennett Near Silbury Hill, Wiltshire, Reported July 30, 2004."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"West Kennett, Wiltshire, four maze quadrants encircled by an 8-pointed star,reported on July 30, 2004.

Bert Janssenfrom Holland took photographs of the bird where it was found and Andreas Mueller fromGermany sent me the following e-mail: \"A strange discovery by Barbara Lamb was made on July 29, inside the newformation below the West Kennett Long Barrow near famous man-build ancientmound Silbury Hill and Avebury Stone circle in Wiltshire.

Also,the body was placed gently with the flow of the flattened plants and thedirection of the planted crop. Strangely, the body was also not damaged orsquashed, either by the postulated circlemaking force, stomping hoaxers oreven by later visitors. It is not clear if the dead bird and its placement is connected tothe forming of the formation, or if two strange events happened at thesame time at the same place? The (bird's) body was collected and will beinvestigated by a veterinarian.\"Bird found dead beneath flattened wheat in the West Kennett crop formationon July 29, 2004, by American crop formation researcher and author, Barbara Lamb.Photographs © 2004 by Bert Janssen."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"West Kennett 8-pointed star reported July 29, 2004, and \"moon and sun\" reported two weeks earlieron July 13, 2004, in wheat field near Silbury Hill.

Lower circle less visible, perfectcondition, no activity.\" 4) West Overton Near Avebury, Wiltshire, Reported July 29, 2004The morning of July 29, 2004, Peter Tadd from Ireland had hired Fast Helicopters atThruxton Airport in Hampshire to fly his Swiss tour group a couple of people at a time fortwenty minute excursions over crop formations. Peter has been returning to Wiltshire withtourists to explore crop formations since1996. On July 29, 2004, during the sixth helicoptertrip, pilot Peter Vellacott thought he spotted a brand new formation in a West Overtonwheat field that he had not seen on his previous five flights. Peter Tadd's Swiss groupexcitedly took photographs of what they thought was a \"miracle\" pattern that had formed"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"in twenty minutes while they were flying. By 1:30 p.m., all had flown and the groupimmediately headed for the West Overton S-shape, or \"serpent.\"Serpentine pattern in West Overton wheat field near Avebury, Wiltshire, was discoveredby farmer at 5 a.m. on July 29, 2004. Photograph © 2004 by Stuart Dike, Cropcircleconnector.com.Peter Tadd told me today:\"I was lucky enough to be the first person to go in and it was quite a beautiful, notlarge design. I would say the overall length of the serpent might have been 60 to 70feet. But the details - what they call the lay of the crop on the ground - was soextraordinary. Along this undulating serpent, the wheat had been laid in such a wayas to give almost a sense of like a diamond-back rattlesnake. As we walked along,the wheat was all laid in one direction on the two sides and there was this pattern inthe middle (of plants laid back and forth on each other). As we walked, we alsonoticed there were three small circles, one each in the wave-like pattern of theserpent. There was a young 15-year-old boy with me who has been somewhat questioningthe reality of these crop formations and how they are made. Then he looked at theperfect little circles and saw there was no entrance from outside. There was no waythe circles could have been created without disturbing the wheat around them - hewas convinced that this could not have been made by any person. At the very end of this formation, there was a tail that wrapped around itself in avery beautiful flowing way. Then, on either side of that tail were two small, sort ofteepees made of maybe a dozen stalks of wheat, twisted in just a perfect form. I hada sense of power of this being very delicate and very moving and needing to behonored, so that we could not walk back along the path of the formation. It wasgoing against the energy current and it was actually creating some discomfort for allof us to even attempt it. So, we went back along the tramlines which are the tractorpaths where no wheat grew.\" Peter Tadd also talked with Stuart Dike from Cropcircleconnector about the helicopterpilot's discovery of the pattern during the sixth flight at mid-day and Stuart wrote about iton the Connector. Word spread and on July 30, Bert Janssen from Holland called to tell meabout the sudden mid-day emergence of the West Overton serpent pattern. Farmer Found West Overton \"Serpent\" At 5 a.m., July 29,2004But Lucy Pringle also called me today to tell me that Alton Barnes crop circle researcherand businessman, Jonathan Sherwood, had not only talked to the farmer who said he sawthe serpent pattern at 5 a.m. that morning, but Jonathan had gone to the West Overton sitehimself at 11:30 a.m. and looked at the crop formation from the side of the road. Thus, the\"serpent\" was definitely in the wheat all morning of July 29, 2004, while the FastHelicopter tour flights were taking place.Jonathan told me today:\"Mike Harris (from Dartmoor), who was sitting over at Alton Barnes, rang me upand told me about it over the mobile. I said I was in Avebury and would just cutthrough West Kennett on the way back, so that's what I did. He came up this yearfrom Dartmoor just to drive around in his blue bus to look for patterns, like I do. He"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"said he was heading back to Alton Barnes to the car park at the top of the hill. So Isaid I would go past there and take a look and when I got there, I thought, 'Gee,that's tiny!' Had a quick look at it from the car. But I had an appointment to get to aswell, so I just stopped the car, got out and stood by the field, and planned to see itagain later in the day. SO, THE PILOT AND SWISS PASSENGERS ARE NOT CORRECT ABOUT THEFORMATION NOT BEING IN THE FIELD BEFORE THE NOON TO 1 P.M.TIME. Right, because I saw it myself at 11:30 a.m. But it would have been easy to missfrom the air. The pathway of the S-shape or 'serpent' would not have been verywide, no more than 3 feet wide if that. A real skinny thing. Later, around 6 p.m., Mike Harris, Tom and Kerry Blower and I returned to thefield. The farmer was very angry and throwing people out and went up the hill. So, Iwent up after him with Mike and I gave him my business card. The farmer said thepattern was there early in the morning at 5 a.m., that he had been throwing peopleout all day, and that he was going to get rid of it because he didn't want peoplemessing up the rest of his field. And he cut it out the next morning (July 30, 2004).\"5) Patney Near Chirton, Wiltshire, Reported July 28, 2004.Patney, Wiltshire wheat formation reported on July 28, 2004.Aerial photograph © 2004 by Steve Alexander. 6) Savernake Forest Near Marlborough, Wiltshire, Reported July 28, 2004.Fast Helicopters pilot, Peter Vellacott, told me one of his colleague pilots recently watchedhis fuel guage move erratically as he flew over a crop formation. And Peter himself hashad several passengers experience camera problems. The latest was with photographer,Steve Alexander, over the Savernack Forest formation on the east side of Marlborough.\"Steve had big problems with his cameras over that one. I've never seen that before. I'vebeen flying with Steve for six years and I've never seen him have problems with hiscameras before. He did not understand it either. There is another lady I fly, Francine Blake and she also has trouble with her cameras. And now she has gone back to manual cameras,so there aren't so many electronic things to go wrong.\"SO THE CROP FORMATIONS ARE ACTUALLY FORCING PEOPLE TO CHANGEEQUIPMENT BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY ELECTRONICMALFUNCTIONS?Ye s . \""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Savernake Forest Near Marlborough, Wiltshire, Reported July 28, 2004.Aerial photographs © 2004 by Lucy Pringle.Peter Tadd took his Swiss tour group into the Savernake Forest pattern and told me:\"That was quite fascinating because I thought seeing the geometric pattern thatlooks a little bit like an Escher graphic (Dutch artist Maurits Cornelis Escher,1898-1972). I was concerned it might be very uncomfortable inside there because ofthe way the 90-degree angles don't quite meet. They are all kind of off one space.But instead, the flow of the crop was so fluid, when I went into the middle of it, allof a sudden I saw that it was a 2-dimensional representation of a 3-dimensionalmultiple-pointed star that was a kind of purple-blue-white in color. It seemed torepresent some notion of the universe in its complexity that I don't reallyunderstand, but it seemed like it was working with different levels of time - waybeyond 3rd, 4th, 5h, 6th dimensions. Our sense of time is linear and that's when wecan feel stuck and frightened because we lose the sense of globalness. The bigger wecan experience our self in a spiritual sense, the less constrained we are and thegreater freedom we can experience.\" 7) Tan Hill Near Stanton St. Bernard, Wiltshire, Reported July 28, 2004.This pattern has been changing almost every day since its first discovery on July 28, 2004,when it did not have any \"arms\" or \"tail\" of circles. Change were still occurring today onMonday, August 2, 2004. Jonathan Sherwood told me that on the night of July 28-29,\"through my night scope, we saw people (pull up in a car, go in, spend two hours movingabout doing their thing. Then they left and in the morning was the first addition of thefilled in arc that hadn't been filled in the day before. And it had three added circles comingfrom the bottom. On June 30th, they added more pieces which are the curved circle armson the sides. The following night, rings were added around the center line of circles. Andheard even more was added today, August 2, but don't know what it is yet.\""},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"First stage of Tan Hill crop formation reported on July 28, 2004.Aerial photograph © 2004 by Lucy Pringle.Second stage of Tan Hill wheat formation after change discovered on July 29, 2004.Aerial photograph © 2004 by Steve Alexander.Each day, up to August 2, 2004, additions have been made to the Tan Hill formation.Aerial photograph as of July 30, 2004 © 2004 by Lucy Pringle. 8) Avebury Down Near Avebury, Wiltshire, Reported July 26, 2004.Avebury Down reported on July 26, 2004.Aerial photographs © 2004 by Lucy Pringle."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9) Golden Ball Hill Near Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, Reported July 26, 2004. \"Dolphins\" below Golden Ball Hill near Alton Barnes, Wiltshire,reported on July 26, 2004.
