See: January 16, 2004 - Earthfiles about Strange Aerial Objects OverNapoleon, Michigan. 1) E-mail from Bob Wood on January 17, 2004, California: \"Hi, Linda.I get to listen to Coast to Coast maybe two or three times a month. Andthis morning, you had a couple of gentlemen describing 'craft' they'd seennear this (Horton's Mud Lake) Michigan ice circle. I have nothing to offerabout the circle, but as they described the craft they have observed (inNapoleon, 15 miles east of Horton), I could feel the chills and thegoosebumps. I've not thought about it for years, but I remember being at mygrandmother's house on a mill village (Hatch Street) in Greenville, SouthCarolina when I was a boy. Early 1970's - I was under 10, so my memoriesmay be a little cloudy, but I remember the jaw-dropping awe of watching itfloat over us and across the sky out of sight. I remember thinking ofChristmas lights. The spinning and flickering and the ... undulating almost,as the lights seemed to expand, or move outward and upward in arcs onboth sides before dipping more sharply at the tips - like wings. I rememberthinking it looked kind of like a butterfly. This is the description thatconnected for me when I was listening to the show. I remember specifically red and white (there may have green, but I'm notsure anymore - Christmasy though) pinpoints of lights, bright but not sobright you couldn't look directly at them. And I remember thinking it mustbe a blimp or hot air balloon since it made no sound as it drifted across thestreet my grandmother lived on and passed over a couple of houses down. Iremember it floating in the sky for a long time - probably no more than fiveor ten minutes, but to me at the time it seemed to last forever.In order of events:My mom had been out on the porch and came in. She was scared butlaughing. She asked my grandmother to come outside and look the lights inthe sky.We both went out and I was enthralled. I immediately ran out into theyard.My mother retrieved me and kept trying to contain me, but I just kept"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"running out there and watching it. After a few times, she just let me standin the yard and watch it.After that long ten minutes or so, she made me come inside, but even thenI watched it out the kitchen window on the opposite side of the house for afew minutes.I remember those few minutes very well, but not the answers to any of myquestions about it the next day.,Today, Mom is 74 and in pretty poorhealth.,I'm going to see her tomorrow afternoon and I think I'll be askingwhat she remembers of the night.I know this doesn't apply so much to your circle, but the similarity ofexperience (about the unusual sky objects), the coincidence ... I justcouldn't pass up the opportunity to tell you about it.Ta k e c a r e ,Bob Wood\" 2) E-mail from Terry on January 17, 2004, California: \"LindaYour show is great. I don't know if I am blessed or cursed, because I haveseen just about every type of UFO in the last 25 years. You were talkingabout three lights in the shape of a triangle. In Nov 1999, I was walking mydog at the Newport Dunes about 8 pm. I noticed three bright, what lookedlike three stars shaped like a triangle. I watched them because they seemedodd. They where south of Saddleback mountain over the area where TRWis. I kept watching and when the stars got brighter, I became a little moreinterested. Then the two bottom stars combined became brighter and thena beam of light came from the top object which became dimmer. Thebottom object became real bright and then just vanished in the blink of aneye. I have seen many things over the years. I believe whatever they are,they are allowing me to see them for whatever reason.Two years before in July of 1997 in the exact same area, a friend and I sawa diamond shaped object about 2.30 in the afternoon. We watched it forabout 45 minutes, as it appeared to be spinning. It was sending andretrieving particles. My friend does not believe in UFO's but could notexplain it. We watched it kind of float away towards Catalina Island whereit finally vanished.I am very rational as a person and am a little baffled.Thanks, Terry \" 3) E-mail from KHJ on January 17, 2004, Michigan: \"Hi Linda, This is just a curious co-incidence, but the day before you filedyour report about the aerial objects in Michigan, my husband and myselfwerevisiting an Indian mound in Epps, Louisiana called Poverty Point whichhas avery large bird shaped mound. I was very surprised to see the drawing of the bell-shaped objectwith wings because it looked very much like the shape of the moundwe had just visited. (Drawing by eyewitness in Napoleon, Michigan onJanuary 16, 2004). Perhaps people thousands of years ago"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"experienced seeing something unusual in the sky and made an effigy of it.Unfortunately there is no site on the web that accurately depicts the shapeof the mound, however there was a drawing on a movie we saw at thearcheological center that more accurately portrays what it looks like.Some web sites show it looking like an eagle but that is not correct, infact it looked just like a bell shaped object with wings, and of course itwould have looked green in the past before trees grew on it. My husband is on a sabbatical and we are touring the south andspecifically looking atancient sites. Then in February we will be traveling to southern Spain andFrance and doing the same thing. We live in Lansing, Michigan, so I wasinterested that objects were seen close to home.\" 4) E-mail from DP and CP on January 17, 2004, Idaho: \"Ms. Howe,I and my high school teacher, wife Cynthia enjoy your contributions toCC. Last night's show convinced me to tell you of our experience. I will tryto be concise, but that is so difficult when explaining such an event as weexperienced. Here goes.Aug. 6, 1992, We were returning from a trip to Utah and driving on Hwy12 in Idaho (coming from Montana into Idaho) approximately 60 milesfrom our home in Lewiston, Idaho. It was 1:00 a.m. on a dark, clear night(no moon but very starlit). The hwy is very winding, following theClearwater River East to West. I thought I was seeing a home window thatwas high on the hill side on the opposite side of the river. Then I realizedthe light was right over the river only yards from the highway and our slowmoving auto. It appeared to be one square shaped light until we seemed tocome to another side of the object and then we could see three square-ishlights and one round light (in the formation of an exclamation mark layingon it's side.) We came to a complete stop, oddly we had not seen any othertraffic during this whole time. We rolled down windows and NO SOUND.It seems to float over us and ahead of our position (over the highway) andon over the low horizon to our south. (On a map we would be West ofKamiah, Idaho and North of Nezperce, Idaho (both small village sizecommunities.)When it cleared the horizon there was a glow as if a large fire existed onthe other side of the horizon. After some time (we are confused whethermoments or minutes...we became rather euphoric feeling), a round light(only) seemed to just \"pop\" over the horizon (about three hundred yardsfrom our position) and stay in one spot. Then, in literally seconds, it 'shot'to the heavens. We watched that object (light?) for several minutes (itseemed) as it appeared to travel 'in the stars.' Then we lost sight as it wentfurther and further. We spent so much time trying to question each other asto what we had seen, what we should do, what we should have done. Then all of a sudden, we were (in our car) physically 50 miles down theroad and at the approach to our home town. We spent several days askingeach other all those same questions. We did not want to tell anyone weknew about this for our concern of no one understanding. Finally, oneweek later I researched the UFO reporting agency in Seattle and calledthem and made a report and sent drawings. We never heard back fromthem which seemed odd to us as this was an incredible event and we aresuch credible people. I called him back and he said 'Oh, we usually don'tcall back; we believe what you saw'... and he recommended that we callMUFON.I called MUFON and they had a field person in a town 40 miles a way andgeographically near where this object traveled towards from our firstsighting. Her name was Li and she came to visit and told us she was being"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"'trailed by people that wanted to harm her and she was worried for herown safety.' This all seemed to odd to us. So after giving her our details wechose to let things be.We have only shared this with our closest friends and family. I have neverheard a description like what we saw. Our region has a history of UFOdeclared sightings.DP and CP\" 5) E-mail from NH on January 17, 2004, Florida: \"Hi Linda,I called Coast to Coast, but somehow got cut off so I'll relate myexperience in this email. I have no problem with the social stigmaconnected to a sighting, but seldom mention it because, like a great axiom,to truly appreciate it you need to have the experience.In 1993, around 9:00 pm, a friend and I stepped into a dark parking lot onthe way to a show. I looked up at the sky as I always do and seen what Ithought at first was a shooting star. Then I realized it was way too slowmoving for such and I also seen another running parallel some distanceaway. My curiosity made me look in the direction they were going and Iseen a third 'light'. This 'triangle' was enormous, and made absolutely nosound. I could not actually make out the craft - only as a blacked outportion of the night sky that blended nicely except for the lights or frictionburns or...?I know this is just one more story. I no longer have a doubt they exist. Thequestion most in my mind over the years has been, 'Could our government,our technology, be that advanced?'Anyway, I believe the universe is teeming with life and have often thoughtthat our solar system may really look more like a parking lot at WalMartwith all the extraterrestrials... :o)Sincerely,N. H., Florida\" 6) E-mail from DP on January 17, 2004, Napoleon, Michigan: \"We've had reports of UFO's near the Napoleon area for years. I live 7miles from there. Back when I was 13 years old back in the summer of 1986, I had a missingtime experience on my grandfather's farm which is about 7 miles northwestfrom Napoleon. I went to feed our dogs and was walking down a flightof cement steps near the milk house and the next moment I remember iswalking back up the steps and looking back over my shoulder. Up in thesky, I saw three bright lights side-by-side that faded out of the visiblespectrum into infrared (?). About an hour of time had passed because the Sun was high up in theWestern sky. I think it was about 7 PM. When I looked back at thesun after my missing time experience, the sun was down near the horizonand it appeared to be about 8 PM. I ran up into the yard where my parents were sitting at the picnic tabledrinking some beer and they asked me why I was gone so long. I toldthem I saw a UFO and naturally they laughed, probably thinking I wasjust a kid making up a story. But I still remember that missing timeevent like it was yesterday."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"So I've never told anybody this story for the last 18 years probably dueto embarrassment and ridicule. But with all of these other storiescoming out, I might as well add my own story to the record.And I'm not the only one who's had unusual experiences. A co-worker at a fast food restaurant I used to work at saw UFO's nearWolf Lake, about 3 miles north of Napoleon a few years ago. Theco-worker is reluctant and embarrassed to to talk about it. A few years ago there was a story in the local newspaper, the JacksonCitizen Patriot, of a family near Wolf Lake seeing a group of UFO's.Naturally, everybody laughed at them, but they stuck to their story. Last August, my brother and myself were outside and we heard a loudreverberating explosion, kind of like the sound of a small asteroid orbolide entering the atmosphere and exploding. My brother's policescanner was buzzing with calls of people in the area reporting a loudexplosion, but the source was apparently never determined. So UFO's are not unusual around here if you pay attention to theirpresence. DP\" 7) E-mail from MM on January 20, 2004, Oregon: \"Hi Linda,I heard part of the show you did with George Noory the other night, andit made me think of a sighting that a friend of mine had back in thelate 70's or early 80's. My friend has passed away, but we had been bestfriends for probably 30years or more. This happened in about April or May of whatever year itwas. I rememberabout how tall the green grass was out in the fields at that time. Sphere Cloaking Device My friend Jack was driving home from work one afternoon and was aboutamile North of Brownsville, Oregon, on what the locals call Seven MileLane. He was passing by a farm that is owned by the Spurlin family.Just North of the farm house, and about 200 yards from the road Jacksaw a silver sphere on legs in the tall grass. He said he looked away,shook his head and looked back, and as he was looking the second timethe sphere just disappeared. He said, \"At first I thought I was goingnuts! I thought about it for a few seconds and I knew I had actuallyseen it. The craft had a cloaking device, and I figured out basicallyhow they did it.\" I had him explain it to me. He said, \"Think aboutthis; if you could photograph everything in 360 degrees, but in asphere, then project it in every direction on the skin of the craft youwould be invisible from every angle.\" I thought about it and it madeperfect sense. It would be like looking at the screen on the back of adigital camera, only perfect visually. The other night you mentioned people who had seen constellations andparts of the night sky move en masse. I am convinced that is how theextraterresterials are doing this with their craft. Think of one of theblack triangles or other huge craft. I think they are somehow taking apicture of the sky above and projecting it to the bottom of the craft,and what is seen from below is an exact copy/reflection from above it.As it moves it would appear, from the ground, that the stars aremoving. It would be like some kind of techno-magic to us, because we"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"don't have the technology to do it. I don't think that any of the blackprojects have the technology either. Triangle of \"Moving Stars\" in Summer of 1979 I think this happened in the summer of 1979. My girlfriend an myselfwere both on summer vacation from college. We went catfishing onenight. We were setting on the bank and there was a Coleman lantern nextto my fishing pole. About midnight my girlfriend started hollering andscreeching. 'Look at that! What are they? What are they?' I had nearly total night blindness from staring at my fishing pole next tothelantern. I ask her what it was and where it was. She said, 'Straightup.' I said, 'All I can see is stars. What do they look like?' Iblocked the light from the lantern with my hand and my night visionstarted coming back. She said, 'They look like stars, there are threeof them. They were flying in a triangular formation and stoppedstraight above us. Keep watching.' I did and they moved apart into a larger triangle, and stopped again.Then after, I'd say, a minute or sothey moved back into their original positions then flew off, andupwards, away from the planet, in a sweeping curve, in perfectformation simultaneously. It was as if they were unified by a singlecomputer, or possibly 3 computers, which I believe is very possible.They moved away to the Northeast. They appeared to be outside theearth's atmosphere. Miles high, and were out of sight in about 4 to 5seconds. It still boggles my mind to think about how fast these thingsmoved in space. They were certainly under intelligent control. Theywere blue-white and about the intensity of the brightest stars in thesky, and about the same size as the largest stars in relationship totheir position. I've thought about this sighting many times, and wonder what they weredoing? The only conclusion I can come to is that they were taking atriangulation of something, maybe a snap shot. Almost every time I'veseen an ET craft I have gotten the feeling they are gathering data. Ican't imagine what would possibly interest these visitors in WesternOregon. Then again, there have been many UFO sightings in the Westernpart of the state, besides mine. Most do not get reported. I was thinking about the sightings I have had, and I've had probablyclose to 30 that I know were not craft from \"our neighborhood\". Whatreally is strange to me is that every one was different, exceptmultiple like objects within a particular sighting. The variation aloneis mind blowing. I go into the NUFORC site and read about the differentsightings and there is so much variation the descriptions of craft, anddifferent odd behaviors, that it is just astounding. Wobbling Aerial Disk in Daylight, November 2003 I had a sighting in mid-November 2003. It was my first daylightsighting. I was out in the backyard. It was about 4:10 p.m., if Irecall correctly. It was overcast, a typical November day in Oregon.Something caught my attention, as it crossed the roofline above theneighbor's house. There was a little sunlight peeking through theclouds in the West. I didn't think too much about it at first, becauseI thought it was a mylar balloon that had escaped from someone. As Ikept watching I noticed that it wasn't moving like one of those flatballoons. It was wobbling steadily and regularly on an even axis, likea toy top. Not only that, it was moving against the wind at about a 70degree angle. Also it had a brown or dark copper colored dome"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"underneath that was about 1/3 the diameter. I couldn't see if it hadanything attached on top. Slowly, after I had watched for a minute ortwo, it started dawning on me that this was no balloon. I thought aboutfilm and video I have seen of UFO's that made the same wobbling motion.Everything was wrong about its movements. I ran in the house andgrabbed my binoculars, which I regret doing now, and it was gone. Thatastonished me even more. I could not have been away for more than 15seconds, and if it had been a balloon it would have been impossible forit to have completely moved out of my view. The very next thing I saw was a small single engine private airplanemoving into the vicinity from the West at low altitude. I'd say theplane was flying at about 600 feet maximum. That gave me a whole otherperspective, literally. The object that I had been watching earlier hadbeen at least a couple of thousand feet away from my direct line ofsight, and much larger than I thought. It had to have been about 30 to40 feet in diameter, maybe a bit larger, judging by the wingspan of theplane. This is total conjecture, but what I think happened is this; whoeverwas controlling that craft saw the airplane approaching and zipped off,or up into the clouds, just after I ran in the house. That's why Iregret going to get the binocs. I have no idea if the pilot saw thething or not. I am pretty sure he could have, he was moving towards thearea in a general direction, but lower in altitude and much closer tome from where the object was when I saw it last.\"Sincerely, M.M.\"8) E-mail from R.J. on January 20, 2004, Colorado:\"Dear Ms. Howe:I was listening to you on Coast to Coast a.m. and boy was I glad to catchthat show! You described people witnessing what appeared to be a bigpiece of the sky moving and that for many people this experience is lifechanging. I am one of those people. My experience happened when I wasabout 6 or 7 years old...1979. I grew up in a very rural part of South EastColorado. The houses were far apart and we generally knew all of ourneighbors. I was allowed to walk quite a distance to the neighbor boy's house for abirthday party and was told not to walk home if the party went on untilafter dark. I was to call for a ride. Well as a child I really didn't have muchsense of time (It's still not much better!) and began to walk home as thesun went down thinking I had plenty of time before dark. Of course I waswrong and as darkness fell I began to worry about how much trouble I wasgoing to be in. I knew my mother would take my new comic book away aspunishment. So I ran against the night and tried to take a short cut. I toldmyself if you couldn't see any stars yet then it wasn't really night. As I approached my home I really began to feel fearful, not because ofhow much trouble I could be in but because I couldn't see any stars. Istared and stared and finally saw what I thought at first was a movinglight...maybe a small plane. Then another light popped and another and itwas as if the stars were turning on in the distance. I was terrified when Irealized something very very large and dark and silent was above me andseemed to be blocking out the stars. It did seem like a chunk of the sky wasmoving. It was the most disturbing thing I'd ever seen. I have no idea howlong I stood. I have a very good idea of the term 'frozen in fear.' All wasfrozen but my bladder. I do remember trying the doors to my house once Icould see all of the stars and my mother was not there. She was outlooking for me."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"I hid among sunflowers and cornstalks until she got home. I had a terribleneed to feel protected and covered. To this day that feeling has not goneaway. I love to look at the full moon from my window but to go out atnight and gaze upwards is still very hard for me. My mother did not punishme by the way and could tell something had really frightened me. My father who was in the Air force tried to convince me that it wasprobably a large plane and \"everything looks bigger to kids.\" Nice try dad.One other thing that may or may not be related--- I have not been able towear a watch since. The batteries die within a week or so. Thanks forallowing me to share this experience. I have shared it with very few peopleas they always treat me as if I was just an \"imaginative child\". I have noidea how something that large could be out there and not be noticed byothers.R.J.\" I welcome firsthand eyewitness reports of unidentified aerial objects.My e-mail is: earthfiles@earthfiles.comCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
