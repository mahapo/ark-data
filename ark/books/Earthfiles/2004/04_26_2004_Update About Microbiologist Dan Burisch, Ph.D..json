April 26, 2004 Los Angeles, California - Dan Burisch is a microbiologist who receivedhis Ph.D. from the State University of New York, Stonybrook, in 1989. He is 40 years oldnow, born on February 2, 1964. His birth certificate name was Danny Benjamin Crain. Ihave met and talked with his mother, Dodie Crain, and with Dan Burisch, Ph.D., himself.In 1990, he married Deborah Kay Burisch who had a child from a previous marriage. Fiveyears later in 1995, Dan legally changed his last name from Crain to Burisch to match thechild's legal last name.In 1989, as Dan Crain graduated from SUNY Stonybrook with a Ph.D. in Microbiology andMolecular Genetics, Dan was at the same time employed by the U. S. Navy's DOD NavalResearch Laboratory. His rank was Captain and his title Microbiologist IV.In 1994, he was assigned to work in an underground laboratory at S-4/Area 51, five floorsunder the Papoose Mountain installation at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The fifth floor isaccessible only by one secure elevator. Dr. Burisch told me that in the year 1994, he suitedup in the fifth floor underground laboratory like an astronaut with breathing and urinationhoses. His assignment was to enter a round \"clean sphere\" filled with cold hydrogenatmosphere that housed an entity called \"extraterrestrial\" by his government superiors.According to Dr. Burisch, his boss reported to a MAJI committee, an extension of theMajestic-12 Special Studies Group organized by President Harry S. Truman in 1947.Majestic 12 included top scientific, military and business leaders asked to study theextraterrestrial phenomenon.Dr. Burisch says the being at S-4/Area 51 was called \"J-Rod.\" The name emerged when thebeing pointed at the \"J\" key on a computer keyboard and then at a hyphen-like or \"bar\"key. Telepathically, the being communicated that those symbols were equivalent to thenumber 15 in hieroglyphics, similar to Egyptian. Fifteen, the being telepathed, was anappropriate name for him because it was the number of light years from Earth to a planetimportant to his civilization. So, the Majestic group named him \"J-Rod.\"Dr. Burisch was told there was a serious medical problem with the J-Rod and his speciesand that MJ-12 wanted Dan to extract tissue from the being's arm for microscopic study. Aserious peripheral neuropathy was diagnosed and Dr. Burisch said in the year 1994, hecollected more than 100 tissue samples in an effort to study the J-Rod's nerve damage andto perhaps develop a treatment. Dan became upset by what he was learning and in awhistle-blowing effort, Dr. Burisch began to leak information to longtime UFO researcherand Executive Director of Skywatch International, Bill Hamilton, in the summer and fall of2002. That year, Bill played audiotaped and videotaped interviews for me of Dr. Burischtalking about his microbiology research of the extraterrestrial being's neuropathy and acomplicated threat that has come to be known as the Time Convergence Paradox.Now Dr. Burisch has been diagnosed with a heart condition in which part of his heartmuscle is weak, similar to the condition that killed the TV actor, John Ritter. In April, DanBurisch told Bill Hamilton that he has negotiated a deal with his government handlers toretire from official service to MJ-12. But he wants to keep researching the issue of"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"\"panspermia\" - the seeding of life on Earth that has been provoked by what the J-Rod hascommunicated to Dan Burisch during the tissue extraction procedures at S-4/Area 51.I talked with Bill Hamilton at the recent X-Conference in Gaithersburg, Maryland, abouthis evolving understanding of the extraterrestrial's communications to Dan Burisch.Interview:Bill Hamilton, Computer Programmer Analyst, University of California-Los Angeles,and Executive Director of Skywatch, Lancaster, California: \"These extractions that hetook were of course painful to this entity. And he knew that and he could even feel the painthe entity was feeling because it's a vacuum extraction and these tissue extractions weresent down like a vacuum hose to a container of some kind and as far as I know, traveleddown a conveyor belt to another station and perhaps someone like another biologist wouldbe looking at these tissue samples under a microscope.And I have asked Dan: Does he believe the J-Rod is still at this particular facility? Hebelieves that he is, but has no confirmation of that. The purpose of taking these tissuesamples was to come up with a means possibly to reverse engineer the genetics of thisparticular entity, perhaps even by hybredizing genes together in order to remedy aperipheral neuropathy that this entity was suffering.WHICH IS SOME KIND OF DETERIORATION OF THE NERVES THAT IS CAUSINGBOTH A WEAKNESS IN THE ABILITY OF THE BEING TO STAND UP AND LOSS OFBODY HEAT FROM THE ENTITY'S BODY?Yes, I believe that is so. I have studied a little about peripheral neuropathies - using theworld wide web of course! - and I have found out that people who suffer from these are ingreat pain. It is very painful for them to have neuropathies of this kind.ON THE VIDEOTAPE, DAN SAYS HE COULD FEEL THIS BEING'S PAIN WHEN HEWOULD EXTRACT TISSUE BECAUSE THERE IS SOME KIND OF TELEPATHICCOMMUNICATION?Yes. Not only telepathy in terms of what the being is thinking, but what the being is feelingis conveyed and empathy is going across here. Now, why is anybody trying to remedy thisbeing's problem? Why are they trying to fix it? I think there was a dialogue that went onbefore Dan ever arrived there and they (MJ-12 and entity) had reached some kind ofagreement that if we would help fixing the problem and what was needed was samplesfrom present-day human genomes that's why coming to us on Earth. They need somethingfrom us. They need this assistance, or at least some asked for this assistance, and inexchange for the help, they would provide us with some details of their advancedtechnology which in turn could be passed to those scientists and engineers who deal withhardware.Paradox of the Converging Time LinesTHE BAFFLING, MIND-BLOWING PART OF THIS WHOLE STORY - IF IT IS ALLTRUE - IS THAT DAN BURISCH ULTIMATELY IS TOLD BY HIS GOVERNMENTSUPERIORS THAT THE BEING IS NOT TECHNICALLY 'EXTRATERRESTRIAL'BECAUSE IT IS A TIME TRAVELER FROM A DISTANT FUTURE (AT LEAST 50,000YEARS IN THE FUTURE), THAT DETERIORATES INTO SEVERE MEDICALPROBLEMS THAT THREATENS THE ENTIRE CIVILIZATION. THEIRTECHNOLOGY IS ADVANCED ENOUGH TO THROW THEMSELVES BACK TO OURPRESENT TO TRY TO HARVEST GENETIC MATERIAL FROM EARTH LIFE TOHELP REPAIR THE FUTURE DAMAGE.That's essentially correct, as fantastic as it seems. But it would explain why there is suchinteraction, why there is such interest in us - why the abductions. Or even why the animalmutilations, because some of these beings are conducting these operations and they areharvesting material. Harvesting material they hope can help them and this is the reason whythey traveled back. And another reason is: how did they get into this condition?Well, they are talking about there is yet to come a catastrophe that affects the wholepopulation of the Earth. This catastrophe was of such a nature that it included intenseradiation and as we know, radiation can change, mutate genes. Those that were exposed toit underwent micro-evolutionary changes that eventually ended up in this type of creature.Of course, something was defective that was passed on in the genetic line that resulted inthe neuropathy.There was another branch of the human race that apparently goes on and remains morehuman and becomes more as Dan has termed it more 'spiritual' in nature. Both of thesebranches of the human race at a far time in the future as they have developed technology"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"for not only travel to other planets, because we do go on to inhabit the planet Mars in thefuture and probably build habitats there.ACCORDING TO DAN'S UNDERSTANDING OF THIS TIME PHENOMENON THATHE HAS BEEN EXPOSED TO?Yes, according to that. That is a jumping off point from Mars to their ultimate destinationsand the little grey type humanoids end up on some planet around Zeta Reticulii 2. Theother human blond-type, Nordic-looking types, end up somewhere on a planet near themiddle star in Orion's belt, Epsilon Orionis, I believe. I don't know what particular planetthat is. Dan had no contact with the Orion beings. He only read about them in thedocuments. He was only told about them from the J-Rod. He only had an encounter withone J-Rod, as he says.AND THIS EVENT THAT SET ALL THIS IN MOTION IS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN IN2012?Yes. He did not hesitate to tell me the year this was supposed to happen was 2012. And Isaid, 'Oh, you mean the Mayan date.' And he said, 'Yes.' I asked him, 'Why do you thinkthis is?'Actually, he had to check back to find out, so our conversation on this became a little moreinformed and I was given to understand that somewhere around that date I don't know ifthere is a little bell curve before and after that date, December 2012 would be the middlepoint. At that time, our solar system was going to pass through the plane of the galaxybecause it has a periodic motion of approximately 200 million years in which it makes anentire circuit of the galaxy. We are approximately 30,000 light years from the core of thegalaxy, so we are kind of one of the rim worlds. But we have lots of company. It's goingaround the galaxy like a horse on a carousel, going up above the plane, down below theplane, like a sine wave. As we pass through the plane of the galaxy, there is a dust belt. Weare now feeling the affects of this dust belt because there is an influx of dust coming intothe Sun. It is causing the Sun, like a T Tauri type star, to heat up, radiate in infra-red andx-ray bands of the spectrum. (T Tauri stars are young suns, near many molecular clouds inour galaxy. They have temperatures and masses similar to our Sun, but are brighter andmore variable, with solar-like activity at X1000.)Worm Holes and Time Travel\"Can highly advanced civilizations build wormholes through hyperspacefor rapid interstellar travel and machines for traveling backward intime?\" - Kip S. Thorne, Astrophysicist Illustration on Page 483, Black Holes & Time Warps © 1994 by Kip S. Thorne.The only thing that Dan mentions that would put a coming 2012 catastrophe outsidecurrent scientific knowledge is what (the J-Rod says) lurks in this band of our Milky Waygalaxy - that is natural worm holes (not confirmed by Earth scientists). Worm holeshypothetically can connect two points in space and time (Einstein-Rosen bridge), as if thepoints were adjacent to one another. Therefore, if there is any radiation coming from thecenter of the galaxy in addition that could be absorbed by the planets, if a worm holecomes into alignment with this, it could amplify that radiation. Then the radiation wouldseem like we were right adjacent to the radiant source.If there were any (artificially engineered time travel) machines of such a nature that theycould generate artificial worm holes on the Earth and were active at the time (Earth passedthrough worm holes in the galaxy), that in turn would also amplify this radiation. So, if youwant to consider the scientific world and that natural or ET-made 'star gates\" really do exist and they were left on Earth by ancient civilizations a long time ago then if any of themremain secret and somebody goes to activate them in order to escape (catastrophe) or maketheir own exit to save their own hide, that could be disastrous for all of us because it wouldamplify the catastrophic consequences.\" Global Warming and Freezing -"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Are Galactic Gas and Dust Regions the Cause?In the July 25, 2003 Science Journal, the \"Astrobiology: Latest News\" section reported:\"Solar System's Path May Have Spurred Ice Ages Physicist Nir Shaviv of the University of Toronto argues that the path of our solarsystem through the Milky Way galaxy may be responsible for Earth's periodic iceages. Our Sun and its planets move in a slow orbit around the center of our galaxy.Over time, our solar system passes through the galaxy's spiral arms-regions densewith stars. Where there are more stars, there are also more supernovae-giant starsthat explode in a flood of cosmic rays. Such rays could affect Earth's atmosphere andalter its climate. Shaviv says that the timing of ice ages on Earth correlates closelywith the historical levels of cosmic ray exposure and with the solar system's routethrough the spiral arms. Other scientists have previously suggested that our solarsystem's galactic orbit makes Earth habitable.\"YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS HOOKED INTO THE NATURALCYCLE OF THE ENTIRE GALAXY THAT WE ARE IN. BUT THERE HAVE BEENABDUCTEES AND OTHER PEOPLE IN THE MILITARY/INTEL WORLD WHO HAVENOT SPOKEN ON THE RECORD, BUT HAVE SUGGESTED OFF THE RECORD THATWHAT WE ARE COMING UP AGAINST IN 2012 IS GLOBAL NUCLEAR WARFARESET OFF BY EVENTS IN THE EARLY PART OF THE 21ST CENTURY IN THEMIDDLE EAST. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE RADIATION AFFECTS THAT CREATEDTHE J-RODS AND THE BLOND NORDICS AS DAN BURISCH HAS BEEN TOLDCOULD BE LINKED DIRECTLY TO NUCLEAR GLOBAL WARFARE?Let me make this statement first. How would they know this? How would they know therewas a coming nuclear war when we could strategically plan to avert it? How would theyknow this unless they had some means of accessing the future? Right? Either through aremote viewing program of some kind or some kind of device that has been developed likein Project Looking Glass.Project Looking Glass is an instrument to assist them in looking into this. But anothersource, if I may go outside of the Dan Burisch circle, another source indicated to me that along time ago, one of the first gifts given to us by the extraterrestrials and given to HarryTruman of all things was a sphere and this sphere was multi-dimensional. It had 6 portals.One of the portals would open up a view of the future. That was the first one they wereable to open up. And they saw things they could not understand. And what they saw, I wastold, was fire, fire, fire everywhere, like the Earth was burning up. And they could notcomprehend that.But as I understand it, that sphere still exists. And another device called the Yellow Bookwhich is a holographic type of record that the J-Rods have about our history and theirhistory from thousands of years ago to the present and into the future. And some people,who have had access to the Yellow Book, have accessed the future and have almost gonecrazy about what they have seen.WAS THERE ANY INDICATION OF A TIME WHEN THIS WOULD OCCUR?Some time between, I believe, 2007 let's say to beyond 2012. But 2012 is kind of like acenter point.\"More Information:Sky FireIn my book, Glimpses of Other Realities, Volume II: High Strangeness, there are severalreferences by people in the human abduction syndrome, ranging from a U.

It may be caused by diseases of the nerves or as the result of systemic illnesses.Many neuropathies have well-defined causes such as diabetes, uremia, AIDs, or nutritionaldeficiencies. In fact, diabetes is one of the most common causes of peripheral neuropathy.Other causes include mechanical pressure such as compression or entrapment, directtrauma, penetrating injuries, contusions, fracture or dislocated bones; pressure involvingthe superficial nerves (ulna, radial, or peroneal) which can result from prolonged use ofcrutches or staying in one position for too long, or from a tumor; intraneural hemorrhage;exposure to cold or radiation or, rarely, certain medicines or toxic substances; and vascularor collagen disorders such as atherosclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma,sarcoidosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and polyarteritis nodosa. A common example ofentrapment neuropathy is carpal tunnel syndrome, which has become more commonbecause of the increasing use of computers. Although the causes of peripheral neuropathyare diverse, they produce common symptoms including weakness, numbness, paresthesia(abnormal sensations such as burning, tickling, pricking or tingling) and pain in the arms,hands, legs and/or feet. A large number of cases are of unknown cause.Is there any treatment?Therapy for peripheral neuropathy differs depending on the cause. For example, therapyfor peripheral neuropathy caused by diabetes involves control of the diabetes. In caseswhere a tumor or ruptured disc is the cause, therapy may involve surgery to remove thetumor or to repair the ruptured disc. In entrapment or compression neuropathy treatmentmay consist of splinting or surgical decompression of the ulnar or median nerves. Peronealand radial compression neuropathies may require avoidance of pressure. Physical therapyand/or splints may be useful in preventing contractures (a condition in which shortenedmuscles around joints cause abnormal and sometimes painful positioning of the joints).What is the prognosis?Recovery from peripheral neuropathy is usually slow. Depending on the type of peripheralneuropathy, the patient may fully recover without residual effects or may partially recoverand have sensory, motor, and vasomotor (blood vessel) deficits. If severely affected, thepatient may develop chronic muscular atrophy.What research is being done?The NINDS supports a broad program of research on disorders of the peripheral nervoussystem, including peripheral neuropathy. Much of this research is aimed at increasing theunderstanding of peripheral neuropathy and finding ways to prevent and cure the disorder.\"Neuropathy Association60 East 42nd StreetSuite 942New York, NY 10165-0999info@neuropathy.orghttp://www.neuropathy.orgTel: 212-692-0662 800-247-6968Fax: 212-692-0668National Foundation for the Treatment of PainP.O.
