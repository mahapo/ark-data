Click here to see Part 1 of Status Report VI Computer simulation based on memory of a military officer who alleges he saw a photograph of a crashedsaucer near Farmington, New Mexico on file at a military base library open only to personnel with TopSecret access clearances. From Chuck Oldham's 1991 interview with the unidentified officer. Report About Alleged Farmington, New Mexico UFO Crash© 1991 by Chuck and Vicky Oldham'Q. Did the file or any of the documents within the file have a classificationstamped on them such as 'Classified' or 'Top Secret?' A. No. They were just in the (military) base library; but you needed to havethe proper clearance to be admitted. Q. Before you saw the file, did you ever have any experience with UFOs - anypersonal sightings? A. No, not at all."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Q. Were you asked or required to look at this material in the library at anytime? A. No. Q. So you don't think some kind of test was being conducted, with you as thesubject? A. No, I was alone when I viewed the file. I was actually looking forsomething else at the time. Q. So you came across this file by accident? A. Yes. Q. What did you see in the photograph? A. There was a perfectly intact, circular shaped craft and it was lyingsomewhat tilted to one side on the ground in the desert. There did not appearto be a crater or other ground-surface disturbance in the photograph thatwould indicate a crash. But I could not tell for sure. Q. Could you describe the angle in which the craft appeared tilted as it lay onthe ground? A. I would estimate that it was tilted from about five to ten degrees. Q. Did the top view of the craft form a perfect circle? A. I couldn't tell. The photograph showed the craft from the side, as ifsomebody on the ground had taken the picture some distance away. But it wasreferred to as a saucer shape. Q. Was there any mention of radiation associated with this craft? A. It wasn't indicated. Q. So you say that the craft was intact - no damage anywhere? A. Well, the report referred to this particular craft in much greater detail. Thisjust reinforced what I was seeing in the photograph, but they also elaboratedon many details not evident in viewing the picture. First of all, it was statedthat the craft was retrieved somewhere near the town of Farmington, NewMexico, prior to 1950. As I could see in the photograph, the material of whichthe craft was composed was metallic and resembled brushed aluminum - thereport noted this also. Q. Were there any fin-like projections noticed on this craft? A. No, none at all. Q. Was there any mention that this structure was reminiscent of a gyro; inother words, did the exterior of the craft rotate around the cockpit? A. There was nothing indicated about that. Q. Could you make out any identifying markings or symbols on the craft as itappeared in the photograph? A. No. And there was nothing mentioned about it. Q. Were there any surface features on the craft at all? A. It was stated in the report that there were portholes on the cabin part of thecraft, but they were not made of any type of glass. Also, I couldn't make outthis feature in the photograph. Q. Did the information reveal what that material could have been? (SeeDiagrams Below) A. Well, this porthole had a puncture that was the diameter of a pencil; that"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"was the only defect discovered on the entire ship. Our people tried diamonddrills, an acetylene torch - everything they could come up with on the portholewhere this opening was located, but nothing would break through it. Theycouldn't enlarge the hole, either; the material was tougher than anything wewere familiar with on Earth. But they eventually got into the cabin. Q. Did it say how they accessed it? A. Yes. It was described as a chance opening. They had gone over the outsideof the craft and could not even find a seam or crack that might indicate thelocation of a door or other entrance. this led them to focus on the smallopening in the porthole. As I mentioned earlier, they used everything theycould think of to enlarge this hole - and nothing worked. It was concluded thatthey would have to somehow gain access through this hole and theyeventually did because a door popped open. It appeared from a place wherethere were no obvious seams or other indications of a door. The report said(referring to the opening and closing of the door) that it was 'almost as if thematerial of the craft had liquefied and then solidified again,' leaving no clue ofthe door's location upon closing. If there was a seam, it was so tight it couldnot be observed. Q. Did you ever see the movie, The Day The Earth Stood Still? It sounds likea scene from the movie where they show the military trying a blowtorch on aspaceship, but with no luck. A. No. I never saw the movie. Q. Did the report in the file indicate the size of this craft? A. My recollection is that it was around thirty-some feet in diameter. Q. Was there anything in the report that indicated the weight of the craft? A. Yes, it was apparently composed of a very light weight material. The reportstated that two average men could lift or move the entire ship! Q. Did you ever see anything about the ability of these ships to becomeinvisible, like the cloaking idea presented on Star Trek? A. It was indicated that there was no way of telling whether they got out ofsight so fast that your eyes could not follow them, or if they actually hadcloaking or light-bending ability. Q. I am especially interested in what these dead occupants were like. Werethey described as biological extraterrestrials? A. They didn't use that terminology that I can remember. But yes, they weredescribed as being like us, but smaller - two arms, two legs, a head, feet andhands. Q. Were they all alike in appearance? A. Well, it said that the two bodies were badly charred. So was the interior ofthe cockpit of the craft. The report also said that they were about four feet inheight; there was no description of their features beyond that. Q. So there was no mention of sexual differences? A. No, no mention of that. But it's interesting that the report said that theclothing was not burned at all. Q. So there was a description of the fabric? A. Yes, it was some type of woven fabric and the report said that it had atensile strength of 800 pounds. Q. Was the color of the fabric mentioned? A. No, there was no reference to it. Q. How about the style of the clothing? Did they both wear the same thing?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"A. It was only described as being like a one-piece flight suit. And yes, it wasthe same on each one. Q. Was there any mention of craft propulsion systems? For example, anythinginvolving jet, nuclear, or anti-matter driven engines? A. There was no mention of a propulsion system, other than the idea that theirtechnology utilized magnetic or gravitational fields of the planets to travel inspace. It was speculated that they were able to cross greater distances ofspace within a much shorter time than we thought possible. For instance,based on our present day technology, it would take us years to get very far inspace. To them, it would only be a matter of days, or even hours. Q. How could the military figure this out? A. The report did not go into depth on this, but part of the conclusion wasbased upon the fact that there was no food or bathroom facility found withinthe cabin of the craft. Q. Was there anything in the report that indicated the reason for the craftcoming down? For example, there have been rumored reports that our militarywas under orders to intercept and shoot them down. Is it possible that we shotthis one down? A. No. According to the report, we were not responsible for bringing this craftor any of the other ones down. There was mention of a magnetic fault, oropening, or something like that, located in the area where the craft camedown. There were three of these faults or openings located in North America:one was located in the Southwest, around the Texas/New Mexico area; onewas somewhere in the Carolinas; and one was somewhere in the Northeastsector, but I can't remember exactly where. Q. You mentioned 'or any of the other ones.' Are you saying that there wasmore than one crash? A. Yes, the report referred to 'crashes' and the Farmington crash informationwas used to relate general information on similarities with other crashes. Q. Are you saying that these aliens are not able to control their craft in certainareas? A. From the report, I learned that these areas occur naturally and couldpossibly interfere with the navigation of these craft. You see, the way Iunderstand it, they use the natural magnetic lines of a planet and a gravityfield to move their ships from one place to another. That's how they are ableto make near-right-angle turns, which our jets are incapable of doing. Theycan fly circles around any of our aircraft. Q. Was there anything in the report that suggested where the craft and thelittle beings originated? Or why they are coming here? A. No, nothing in the report as to 'why' or 'from where.' But the report did saythat hundreds of alien craft flew over the town of Farmington, New Mexico,on the anniversary of this crash. That also corresponded with the celebrationof some national holiday. And it said that it might have been a tribute to thebeings that were killed, or they were letting us know - by a show of force -they had overcome the factor that had caused their ships to crash. Farmington Daily Times, New Mexico, March 18, 1950. Q. How did the military report specifically refer to it? For instance, was itdescribed as 'a tribute to their fallen comrades?'"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" A. they didn't use the term 'comrades.' Actually, there was some specificterminology used, but I can't recall what it was. (Note: Chuck speculated thatwhatever the word was that referred to the dead beings, it may have someimportant significance indicating our military's awareness of the relationshipsor order within the alien culture.) Q. Why do you feel that the military or the government is withholding thisinformation from the public? A. They felt that only people in professional levels were capable of dealingwith this information. Based on what occurred with the Orson Welles War ofthe Worlds radio presentation, this information could create panic. Then itthreatens to break down the industrial complex that supports the militarycomplex - it would obviously undermine it. And it could possibly reduce ourability to counter an attack by a hostile alien culture. But it was also clear thatthe intent of these particular beings was not known. While our techniciansworked on the craft out in the desert (trying to gain access), other alien shipswould, from time to time, fly by the site, pausing momentarily to view thescene, perhaps to see if there were any survivors. At no time did they attemptto harm our people. Q. Do you have any other comments you would like to make about this? A. I think I've covered everything. All the information on this subject wasremoved from the library in the late 1960s. One thing I can say is that I wouldsure like to know what's going on now. Craft Diagrams:Aztec Crash The following diagrams demonstrate a hypothetical analysis of randomprobings to gain access to the mechanism controlling the cabin entrance door.This method uses a thin, rigid metal rod, maneuvered through a pencil-sizedopening in a porthole. Aztec Crash - Estimated dimensions of Aztec saucer cabin were 18 feet diameter and 6 feethigh. Farmington Crash Estimated dimensions of Farmington saucer cabin, based on diagramidentified by witness. The scale used to formulate diagrams A and B was 9/32inch = 1 foot.Farmington Crash - Estimated dimensions of Farmington saucer cabin were 6 feet diameter and 3.5 feethigh."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" The following factors were used as a basis to formulate the measurements shown inthe documents: Cabin floor levels and location of portholes are based on height of reportedoccupants (36 to 48 inches high).Thickness of porthole material combined with the relatively small diameter ofthe broken area and the angle of penetration of the break itself would restrictthe play of any object used to probe inside cabin. See diagram C. Conclusion: Traversing a six-foot diameter cabin would afford one greater controland accessibility. The far side of the cabin's interior would be easily reached. Incontrast, attempting to probe inside a larger, 18-foot-diameter cabin using a long,pencil-thin metal rod would be extremely difficult. Farmington Saucer Scale: 6/32 inches = 1 foot Oldham References"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"We include a book list because we are concerned that much of this literature hasbeen passed over by present-day researchers. Some of the accounts contained herehave long been discredited and are sadly ignored. We initially avoided much of theolder material ourselves and would not have bothered with it if we did not have theinformation divulged to us by our witness (to the military file). This is furthersignificant because we first became acquainted with this person over an entirelydifferent subject of interest and it was an offhand remark about UFOs that led him toreveal his story. Ruppelt, Edward J. The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects.Garden City, New York: Doubleday & Company, Inc. 1956. In this book we found a corroborative reference to the incident in Farmington, NewMexico. Keyhoe, Major Donald E. The Flying Saucers Are Real.New York, N. Y.: Fawcett Publication, Inc. 1950. Here we found a brief account of the Farmington incident. We also read aboutKeyhoe's trip to Denver, Colorado, to check on the story about the 'little men;' hewas convinced it was a hoax. Berlitz, Charles and Moore, William L. The Roswell Incident.New York, N. Y.: Berkeley Publishing Corporation, 1980. The authors suggest that the Scully story may not have been the perpetration of ahoax after all. Edwards, Frank Flying Saucers - Serious Business.New York, N. Y.: Lyle Stuart, Inc., 1966. A very informative book. Areas of interest to us include the chapter entitled 'PickUp the Pieces' which features accounts about Wilbert B. Smith of Canada. Scully, Frank Behind the Flying Saucers.New York, N. Y.: Henry Holt and Company, 1950. New evidence indicates that he was telling the truth about the crashes of disks andthe recovery of the bodies. The story told here is an amazing corroboration of detailsthat were revealed by our witness to the file. He has never heard of Scully or hisbook. Steinman, William S. Stevens, Wendelle C. UFO Crash at Aztec.Tucson, Arizona: UFO Photo Archives, 1986. This is an extensive and impressive work that substantiates Scully's claims from1950. We feel that Mr. Steinman demonstrates a singular determination and couragethat is rarely seen in UFO research. His personal interview with Dr. Sarbacher,confirming Scully's story, is key. Stringfield, Leonard H. Retrievals of the Third Kind, 1978; The UFO CrashRetrieval Syndrome, 1980; UFO CRASH/RETRIEVALS: Amassing the Evidence,1982; UFO CRASH/RETRIEVALS: Is the Cover-up Lid Lif ting? 1989. Cincinnati,Ohio. We feel that Leonard Stringfield's series of status reports have been an immensecontribution to UFO research for more than a decade. Without this ongoing andregularly updated grounding in the physical aspect of the UFO phenomenon, manyresearchers might have become totally lost in the paranormal hypothesis. Mr.Stringfield has demonstrated great tenacity and tireless dedication, persisting in hisinvestigations despite the barrage of disinformation that discourages (and evenfrightens) other would-be researchers. We express our gratitude to him for hisrelentless quest to uncover the truth.' Len Stringfield: Unfortunately, without an exact year affixed to the saucer crash near Farmington,except that it occurred before 1950, we can only speculate that it was another caseof using a catchall name for the alleged crash in the smaller town of Aztec in 1948.If that be the case, then we must overlook Scully's cast of swindling characters in hisbook and look anew at the facts - as amorphous as they might be - that Steinmantried to resurrect in his book.\""},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" Continued in Part 12.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
