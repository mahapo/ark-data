Return to Part 1Interview:Grant Cameron, a building facility manager at the University of Manitoba; reporterand producer of www.presidentialufo.com, Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada: How Does U.S. Government ReverseIts Policy of Lies and Denials About ETsYOU CAN HEAR THAT DISCUSSION DECADE AFTER DECADE FROM TRUMANAT LEAST UP TO THE CURRENT DAY. GRANT, WHAT HAS CHANGED - IFANYTHING - THAT MIGHT OPEN UP THE TRUTH ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'RENOT ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE AND THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHERINTELLIGENCES INTERACTING WITH THIS PLANET FOR MILLENNIA? WHATWOULD REVERSE THE LIES AND OPEN UP THAT TRUTH - LET'S SAY IN THENEXT 20 YEARS?Good question. I don't know. Basically, I think you are talking the same things that haveheld it up. I can't really see unless they make a mistake. My idea is to get a high rankingleader who has been briefed and confirms the fact he was briefed, which leads you to adate, a briefing date, where you can get a document. The document will have the truth, notthe misinformation they are putting out. It will have the actual truth of what is going on.Government is very short-sighted. It's very 'Let's do things for the next four years.' There isno long term thought inside of government because it is very vote-oriented. I always saythey look at the shortest distance between two votes.GRANT, WHAT YOU ARE JUST SUMMARIZING INDIRECTLY IS THE FACT THATIT WILL PROBABLY BE ANOTHER 60 YEARS BEFORE ANY OF THE REALTRUTH WILL OPEN UP ON THIS PLANET.Yes, unless there is some sort of accident, a crash retrieval they can't control, or someaspect where somebody gets the idea that this is for real some media that is not controlledby the government. And I think a lot of them are controlled by the government. Somebodymight break ranks and say we're going to put this story out, we're going to do it and itsnowballs from there. It has to be something outside the ordinary because right now, it'sstatus quo. Things are going along, no one is asking any questions, no one seems to beinterested. It really doesn't get into the media.THAT'S THE HUMAN SIDE OF THE EQUATION. FOR A MOMENT, WHAT IS YOURPRIVATE, PERSONAL OPINION ABOUT WHY ON THE NON-HUMAN SIDE OF THEEQUATION, THERE WOULD NOT BE SOME KIND OF BLATANT PRESENTATIONTHAT WOULD PULL THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER OUR GOVERNMENT AND ALLGOVERNMENTS OF THE PLANET?You hear about the concept of universal law that you can't interfere with someone else'sevolution. They are sitting back and watching. You'll see a number of cases Bentwatersand Rendlesham Forest, for example. When we were in Las Vegas, this discussion aboutthe fact that the alien presence there sent a beam down through all this concrete and metal"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"and disarmed the nuclear weapons the Americans had in the United Kingdom that shouldnot have been there. The aliens are basically sitting on the sidelines and will step in if thereis a nuclear war. But otherwise, they are going to let us make the mistakes that we have.They are going to have gradual disclosure as well. They are sort of indicating indirectly tous through people who get discredited that there is an alien presence, and allowing peopleto gradually acclimatize themselves to the fact that they are there. They must realize thesame thing about panic and all those issues.BUT, ISN'T THERE AN IMMEDIATE CONTRADICTION TO THAT PERSPECTIVE INTHE VERY EXISTENCE OF HUMAN ABDUCTIONS AND ANIMAL MUTILATIONSWHICH ARE PHYSICAL INTRUSIONS IN HUMANS AND ANIMALS?But it's still done in the background. It's not like the aliens take 500 cattle and fly intodowntown New York City and drop them where everyone can see them. It's still done inthe background. it's very indirect. You and I can link it. We put the pieces together, but it'snot directly linked for the public. It's sort of done indirectly. It's like you are trying toprove that it's going on. I've always said that if they wanted to announce themselves, theycould announce themselves. They could land in 5 or 6 cities all at the same time. Theycould control the whole thing and come out and say, 'Here we are.' And they don't. That'swhat scares the government. That's my impression of why the aliens don't: there is a law ofnon-interference. This is disagreed with in the animal mutilations and abductions whichconfuse me as well how does this fit in? It's like a little bit of interference with ourevolution, but it's sort of passes like an exception to the rule. It confuses me.WHAT SHOULD ALSO BE ON OUR LIST IS THE COMPLEXITY OF AGENDAS ANDTHE FACT THAT IT SEEMS TO BE INCREASINGLY CLEAR THERE ARE MANYMORE THAN ONE INTELLIGENCES INTERACTING WITH OUR PLANET. ONCEYOU GET A CLEAR FOCUS ON MORE THAN ONE INTELLIGENCE, AND THATTHERE ARE MORE AGENDAS, THEN THE COMPLEXITY RATCHETS UP SO HIGHTHAT FOR ANY OF US HUMANS, INCLUDING THE GOVERNMENT, TOUNDERSTAND WHAT ANY ONE INTELLIGENCE AND ITS AGENDA MIGHT BE ISALMOST NOT POSSIBLE FOR HUMANS THAT ARE LIVING ON THIS EARTH.20) Alien agenda incomprehensible. Yes, and that's one of the big reasons thegovernment does not fully understand the alien agenda that the aliens haven't made itpublic to the government. It might in the end be a take over. That cold be one of thescenarios, through abductees and through genetic manipulation, that they are going tointerbreed and take over. That is always one of the scenarios.21) Alien intelligences deceive. ONE GUY WHO WORKED FOR THE MILITARYAND INTEL TOLD ME BACK IN THE EARLY 1980S, 'LINDA, THE GREYS LIE TOUS. WE KNOW THEY LIE.' THAT CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD BECAUSE I THINKTHE NAIVE IMPRESSION MOST HUMANS HAVE IS THAT SOMETHING FROMSOME PLACE ELSE IN THE UNIVERSE THAT IS ADVANCED ENOUGH TOTRAVEL FROM FAR AWAY TO GET HERE WOULD SOME HOW BE MOREMENTALLY, SPIRITUALLY ADVANCED AND THAT THERE WOULD NOT BEMANIPULATION OR DECEPTION OR LIES.That's one thing about the aliens. They don't seem to be much more spiritually advancedthan we are.OR AT LEAST SOME OF THEM. THEN YOU TALK TO SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVEHAD INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER INTELLIGENCES THAT SEEM TO BE VERYADVANCED AND MORE INTERESTED IN SPIRITUAL EVOLUTION THANANYTHING PHYSICAL. IT'S THIS COMPLEXITY, THIS CONFUSION, THATREIGNS AS MUCH AT THE END OF 2004 AS WE HEAD INTO 2005 AS IT DIDBACK IN 1947.22) Government does not know what to do about ETs. Yes, and back in 1950, one of thereasons that ties in with this: Wilbert Smith ran the Canadian government's flying saucerinvestigation. He talked a number of times about why the government had covered it upand he said it was very simple: They (govt) did not know what to do. He said that whenthey realized the existence of the saucers and people from elsewhere, they didn't knowwhat to do about it, couldn't control it, and they closed their eyes and hoped it would goaway.' They simply did not know what to do. That is one of the things: they are throwingtheir hands up, it's out of their control and the best thing is not to let everybody know youcan't control it.AND TO HOPE THAT IT GOES AWAY WHAT A NAIVE POSITION! ESPECIALLY 60YEARS LATER, REALIZING THAT ANIMAL MUTILATIONS AND HUMANABDUCTIONS AND A MYRIAD OTHER MORE COMPLEX PIECES OF EVIDENCETHAT SOMETHING INTERACTS WITH OUR PLANET AND IS STILL HERE, NOTGOING AWAY, AND WHEN IS THIS WORLD GOING TO BE TOLD THE TRUTH?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Yes. And another reason for non-disclosure that I have is:23) Nationalism. Especially when you consider that the U. S has a lot of the UFOtechnology and a lot of nationalism. If you go to a world view of aliens versus us,nationalism is out. But nationalism is a big thing in the USA. If you are the Americangovernment, it's hard to accept your government is not going to exist anymore. It's going tobe a world government and you're just going to be a little puppet doing what you are beingtold by a world government. So, nationalism is something the USA does not want to giveup. The Brookings Institution 1961 Report24) Advanced intelligences absorb/defeat less advanced intelligences. The Brookingsstudy on the implications of discovery of extraterrestrial life and intelligence talked aboutextinction. This is the idea that if you get an advanced civilization and a non-advancedcivilization (which would be us), the one that is less advanced could become extinct.Editor's Note: Page 215 of Peaceful Space Activities for Human Affairs by TheBrookings Institution, dated April 18, 1961, states: \"... anthropological files containmany examples of societies sure of their place in the universe, which havedisintegrated when they had to associate with previously unfamiliar societiesespousing different ideas and different life ways. Others that survived such anexperience usually did so by paying the price of changes in values and attitudes andbehavior.\" April 18, 1961, report for NASA by The Brookings Institution.This is the idea of the Native Indian. When the white man came, that Indian society justfell apart. That's probably in the back ground of the briefings that this is a very likelyscenario and would mean to the President, 'I['m just not going down this road.' This issomething we'd have a hard time dealing with if it turns out to be true.GRANT, DOES THIS MEAN THAT THERE IS NO DISCLOSURE ABOUT OTHERLIFE IN THE UNIVERSE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE BECAUSE IT IS SOPOLITICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO OPEN UP?Yes, I think there are so many scenarios they are unsure of, or they know for a fact aregoing to cause trouble, that when you weigh the way the world is right now versus all thethings that could go wrong! And a government wants to be in control. I always say"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"disclosure is like a snowball going down a hill. Once you disclose all you have to say is'ETs are real.' The snowball starts going down the hill and you could get an avalanche. Atthat point, you can no longer control it and it's a situation where, for example, it greenlights everything. If the President said, 'ETs are here, but I'm not going to talk about therest of it.' That would automatically green light all the people that you've talked to, Linda;that I've talked to; all those inside the Intel community who say, 'OK, now it's open. ThePresident has said this is for real.' They start talking and you can't control what they aregoing to say.It's something that once it's out of the bag, it's out! Now they can control it by indirectlyleaking material with misinformation to indirectly tell us what is going on. But once youconfirm it, then you have this massive rush of reporters and people who demand answersand it's something you totally lose control over; the government wants to be in control. Ifyou take a look at President Reagan when he was shot, the National Security Adviseradvised minutes after Reagan was shot that the more people think things are normal, thebetter off we are going to be. You want to keep people thinking that nothing has changed.If you change the scenario that's changed, this is changed the stock market is movingdown, a hundred different things it gets out of control.IT'S LIKE Orwell's 1984 IN WHICH THE LIE HAS BECOME THE TRUTH AND THETRUTH HAS BECOME THE LIE.Ye s .HOW DO WE UPEND THAT AND HAVE THE TRUTH BE THE TRUTH?Exactly. One of the scary things I've looked at for one of the possible reasons is:25) Counter-measures - Space-based weapons to fight ETs. The government mightactually be stupid enough to say that it can develop weapons in order to handle the aliensituation by wiping them out that we could actually win in a war against the aliens that thegovernment is working on counter-measures to go after the aliens. If that is true - and Ithink it looks like they actually are working on that kind of stuff - this is total stupidity.Clinton was asked after the movie Independence Day in 1996, 'Mr. President, do you thinkwe would win a war against the aliens?' And he said, 'Yes, I think the people would cometogether and we would win.'I hope he was joking when he said that, but that's a scary scenario that a lot of the secrecyis the fact that we are going to go to war against the aliens.BUT HOW COULD WE ASSUME SUCH A POINT OF VIEW WHEN THENON-HUMANS CAN NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY?Exactly. We would have to make the assumption that they have a certain amount oftechnology to go to war and then find out that they have ten times that and they just wipeus off the map, which would be a scary scenario. And yet you look at the whole Star Wars\"anti-missile shield\" thing. It's being built and yet there is no country that can launch amissile against the United States and you sit there and ask: What are they (U.S.government) actually doing? Why are they spending billions and billions of dollars on thisstuff that doesn't seem to work, but they are determined to get it up there and take a warinto space? U. S. National Missile Defense System -\"Unknown Anomaly\" Causes Test FailureThursday, December 16, 2004, Page A16 Headline, Albuquerque Journal, Albuquerque, New Mexico."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Editor's Note: The phrase, \"unknown anomaly\" is reminiscent of a similar phrase,\"peculiar phenomena\" used by Lt.

That is the fact that it might not be the cover-up as much as whatthey've done to cover it up. For example, let's assume in the past sixty years, they've hadto kill 5,000 people to keep it all a secret. All these things behind the scenes that you don'tknow what is going on that they are trying to cover up and that might be the real reasonfor the cover-up what they did to keep it covered up.27) Who is in charge?Former President Bill Clinton, according to Steven Greer, told Sarah McClendon - alongtime White House reporter: Reporter Sarah McClendon: 'Mr. President, why don't youdo something about the ET cover-up?'President Bill Clinton: 'There's a government inside the government and I don't control it.'"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Maybe we're going after the government for disclosure and the government has no inputwhatsoever.
