Their genitals had been removed. No evidence about how the deaths wereaccomplished. The Moffat County Sheriff's Office asked a Colorado stateveterinarian to examine the three cows.This past weekend at the Long Beach Peninsula in the state of Washington,hundreds of giant squid washed up dead. Cause unknown. Some people harvestedthem for food, but the marine fish manager in the State Fish and WildlifeDepartment warned, \"I sure wouldn't eat them. It would be like eating a deer on theside of the road.\" You don't know what killed them.Long Beach, Washington, fisherman speared dead giant squidfrom the Pacific Ocean waters and tossed them into his pickup truckon the way to freezer storage.

Exact cause unknown, but suspected is Botulism Elinked to the sudden appearance in the 1990s of Zebra and Quagga mussels from theCaspian Sea on the other side of the world. Those foreign mussels came into theGreat Lakes in tankers and boats. For an in-depth look at the Caspian Sea mussellink to the dead birds, see my report at Earthfiles.com."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"An increasingly common discovery on Lake Ontario and Lake Erie since the late 1990s- as many as 30,000 water fowl washed up from deaths now thought to be caused by Botulism Type Elinked to the invasion of Caspian Sea zebra and quagga mussels. Photograph by Jeff Robinson, CanadianWildlife Service.Since the middle of September, at least 200 squirrels primarily fox squirrels havewashed up dead on the shores of Lake Michigan at Grand Haven and P. J.Hoffmaster parks. To date, every test done on a few of the bodies have beennegative. I talked about the mysterious squirrel deaths this week with Tom Cooley,Wildlife Biologist in the Michigan Department of Natural Resources' WildlifeDisease Lab in Lansing, Michigan.P. J. Hoffmaster and Grand Haven State Parks are on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan. Fox squirrel - such as most of the dead squirrels found between P. J. Hoffmasterand Grand Haven State Parks on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan since mid-September 2004.Interview:Tom Cooley, Wildlife Biologist, Michigan Department of Natural Resources, WildlifeDisease Lab, Lansing, Michigan: \"The squirrels I looked at were picked up onSeptember 17, 2004. They were received here on September 24, and I was able to look atthem on September 27. These were squirrels that came from the Grand Haven area aroundor near the Grand Haven State Park, or near P. J. Hoffmaster State Park on the LakeMichigan shore. It was about a 7 to 10 mile area is the description I received that squirrelswere seen washing up on the shores of Lake Michigan.Evidently people were also seeing them in the water of the Grand River, which dumps intoLake Michigan near there. In many cases, they were just seeing carcasses. In some cases,they were actually seeing squirrels that were swimming.The squirrels that I got in of the three really only one of them was really fresh. The othertwo had been dead for a period of time. The organs on all three of the animals lookedfairly normal. They were in good to very good physical condition. Two of the three hadsome material in the stomach. The third one did not have anything in the stomachwhatsoever.I was able to save the contents on the two that had stomach contents and the brains on thetwo that were checked for microscopic examination and the livers from all three of them.To date, I don't really have a lot of information to go on. The liver tests were for metalsanalysis and they were negative. The stomach contents were negative. The microscopicexamination really did not show much of anything except a little bit of fluid in the lungs."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"So, at this point I am waiting for analysis on brain tissue. The one we did have checked forWest Nile and it was negative. West Nile viruses was a concern by some people as well.We did have the brain checked on that and it was negative. No Other Animals AffectedWHAT ABOUT OTHER ANIMALS DYING AS WELL?That's what you would expect. That's why we looked at stomach contents. You look atstomach contents because if they got into something, that would be the most likely sourceof material to be ingested (contaminated water) than another route. especially if you'redealing with only one species. If there was something in the water, you should have otheranimals dying. With that not being the case it does not sound like there were any fish deador any other species dead in the water. There were just the squirrels.THAT MAKES THIS STRANGER, DOESN'T IT?A little bit.DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY OTHER HYPOTHESIS NOW ABOUT WHY ONLY THESQUIRREL POPULATION IN THIS PART OF MICHIGAN SHOULD HAVEMYSTERIOUS DEATHS?I haven't heard anything from anybody. What I try to do is take the information they giveme, look at the animals that are there and see if we can come up with an explanation. Atthis point, there is nothing here to indicate there has been any kind of foul play or anythinglike that. That's why it might come back to the idea that it might just be a movement ofanimals in that particular part of the state, something kicked them off to undergo thismigration. Again, I don't how far a migration it could be. It did not sound like they were they were not seeing large numbers of squirrels moving through the woods or anything likethat. But something may have made them move and the river was right there and the riverwas too wide for them to get across.BUT IT IS ODD, ISN'T IT, FOR SEVERAL DOZEN SQUIRRELS TO BE SEEN BYPEOPLE SWIMMING IN THE RIVER?Yes. They weren't all seen swimming. A lot were seen dead.IN THE WATER.In the water. No Evidence of Water ContaminationTHEN WAS THE WATER CONTAMINATED? OR DID THEY DIE SOMEWHEREELSE AND FALL INTO THE WATER?Again, with the ones that were still there and alive, that would indicate they are probablynot picking up something at that point. You would think it was just they were trying to getacross (the river), especially when we checked the stomach contents and they come backnegative.IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT THIS TRULY IS A MYSTERY?Right now I don't have any diagnosis on why they died, so yes, I guess it could beclassified as a mystery.IN YOUR 27 YEARS WITH THE DEPT. OF NATURAL RESOURCES IN MICHIGAN,HAVE YOU EVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN BEFORE WITH THISMANY SQUIRRELS DYING WITHOUT EXPLANATION?No. I've never had numbers turned in or hear of numbers like this. You get an occasionalone, but not with the numbers eyewitnesses were seeing.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Left: Fox squirrel. Right: Grey squirrel - a few also found dead.More Information:Dr. Cooley hopes to have more lab results from fresher squirrel bodies by mid-November2004. Fortunately, the number of mysterious squirrel deaths have tapered off in October2004.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
