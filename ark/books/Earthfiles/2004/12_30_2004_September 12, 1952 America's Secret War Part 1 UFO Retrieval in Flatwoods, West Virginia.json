C.December 29, 2004 Daytona Beach, Florida - Half a century ago in 1952, fifteenhundred and one UFO sightings were reported to the U. S. Air Force's Project Blue Book(Page 108 of Blue Book Report). The most well known events were \"flying discs\" overWashington, D. C., on July 19 and July 26, 1952, that were monitored on radar.July 19 and 26, 1952 - UFOs Over Washington, D. C.Around midnight on July 19, 1952, radar operators at Washington National Airport notedseveral 'blips' on the radar over Washington D.C. The unidentified blips traveled at 100 to130 mph, but then would accelerate suddenly to speeds in excess of 7,200mph. Washington National Airport and other radar operators confirmed the radar activitywith each other and with Andrews Air Force Base. A week later on Saturday, July 26,1952, \"glowing aerial objects\" showed up again on radar over the Nation's capital and TheWa sh i n g t o n P o st even ran a story about one jet pilot's encounter with a \"saucer thatoutran\" him.Monday, July 28, 1952, The Washington Post, Washington, D. C. Six Weeks Later on September 12, 1952The late afternoon into evening of September 12, 1952, eyewitnesses along the entire EastCoast of the United States and inland in places such as Flatwoods, Braxton County, WestVirginia, saw and reported \"flaming\" objects and \"strange lights\" in the sky. Residents alsoheard and saw military planes. At least one of the military events was a UFO crashretrieval operation on the hill above Flatwoods, West Virginia, according to Frank"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Feschino, Jr., an artist illustrator, UFO researcher and author of the recently publishedbook entitled, The Braxton County Monster: The Cover-Up of the Flatwoods MonsterRevealed © 2004. About ten years ago, Frank first heard from a West Virginia cousinabout the so-called \"Flatwoods Monster\" associated with the 1952 landing of a verystrange object on a hilltop above Flatwoods. Frank Feschino wanted to know more andbegan digging into old newspaper files, interviewing surviving eyewitnesses and eventuallybecame convinced that on September 12, 1952, the American military had a \"secret war\"with whatever the flying discs were.Frank also became convinced after talking and sketching with adults now, who were gradeschool and junior high age eyewitnesses on September 12, 1952, that the so-called\"Flatwoods Monster\" was a large mechanical device, not biological. Frank explained thatthe first people to see an oval-shaped object that looked like it had red-violet-orangeflames coming off of it were about a dozen boys ranging in age from ten to fourteen.According to some of the children, the oval object stopped in mid-air and then went downon a hilltop at the Fisher Farm across from the school playground where they were allplaying. The children ran to the house of Kathleen May, mother to two of the boys -Edison and Freddie - and she went with them to see the mysterious object which localmedia and a TV program sensationalized as the \"Flatwoods Monster.\" But Frank Feschinodid his own later interviews and sketches with Mrs. May and her grown son, Freddie, thatlead him to conclude the Flatwoods event was a UFO crash and retrieval operation of greatinterest to the United States government - but nothing has ever been shared with theAmerican public.The night of September 12, 1952, eyewitnesses along the entire East Coast of the United Statesand inland such as Flatwoods, West Virginia, saw and reported \"flaming\" objects and \"strange lights\" in thesky.Flatwoods, West Virginia, eyewitnesses who saw 'monster' on September 12, 1952.

That's exactly what he told me, 'This thing was mechanical. It was notalive.' And Kathleen May told me she could hear it sizzling, like 'bacon frying.'

Military Retrieval Operation At Flatwoods, West VirginiaSiteI interviewed Col. Dale Leavitt (a Captain in 1952) who was the head of the West VirginiaNational Guard and he was called by Washington. He was called at his home in thesouthern area and he got together a bunch of troops and they went up to the site. He toldme there were 50 to 60 guys. They came into the back area of the Fisher Farm not theaccess road. It was a strict covert mission. They went up there and took pieces andremnants of stuff that was laying around. They took samples of the oil, some pieces of thetree where this thing was seen hovering there. He told me he had to box all this stuff up,put it in jars, put it in little boxes, and he had to ship it back to Washington.DID HE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE ADDRESS TO WHICH HE SHIPPED?No, he didn't. He just told me he sent it off.DID HE EVER LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT IT WAS?He never heard anything back again. He never heard a word.Colonel Dale Leavitt, U. S. Army, circa 1960s. Col.
