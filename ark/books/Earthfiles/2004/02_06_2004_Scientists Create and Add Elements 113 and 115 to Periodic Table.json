Four atoms containing 115 protonsfrom the combination and fusion of the calcium and americium were created for less than100 milliseconds - Element 115 Ununpentium - and then decayed into Element 113Ununtrium and others.

February 6, 2004 Livermore, California - Back in 1989-1990, I had severalphone conversations and a meeting with an electrical engineer named RobertLazar to talk about his alleged firsthand knowledge of non-terrestrialtechnology. Bob had previously worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory andfrom the end of 1988 until March 1989 was doing part time work at a highlyclassified place called \"S-4\" built inside the Papoose Mountains near GroomLake, Area 51, at Nellis AFB north of Las Vegas.Bob said large engineering bays were dug into the Papoose Mountains and werecamouflaged by sand-covered doors that would show up in satellite photographslike the rest of the sandy hills. Inside those engineering bays, Bob said therewere at least nine disk-shaped spacecraft designated \"extraterrestrial.\" He wasassigned to do back-engineering on one particular model that seemed to have ahighly advanced propulsion system. Bob said he was told that the fuel was\"Element 115,\" not yet discovered by any Earth science. Bob's superiorsexplained that the sources of the Element 115 were binary star systems. Bobsaid the fuel material was in a stable form that could be held in his hands.Element 115, he said, had the unusual ability to produce antimatter in a specialcontainer that powered the craft. Antimatter combined with matter would causemutual annihilation of protons, neutrons and electrons and the release ofenormous quantities of energy.According to Bob Lazar, only half a pound of the Element 115 at S-4 couldpower a spacecraft for about 30 Earth years. More amazing than that, he said,Top Secret scientific research had concluded that the huge energy Element 115could produce was used to distort space and time with strong gravitationalfields, also generated by technology on the spacecraft. The result was that the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"disk could quickly \"jump around in the cosmos from point to point,\" rather thanthe impossibly long travel in light years that current human technology wouldface.Thirteen years ago in 1991, Bob Lazar produced a documentary about hisexperiences inside S-4 with the alleged extraterrestrial craft and propulsionsystem. The title was Here is a brief excerpt of Bob describing what he learnedabout the power source that provides the energy needed to warp gravity, spaceand time.Robert Lazar, Narration Excerpt from The Lazar Tape ... And Excerptsfrom the Government Bible © 1991 by Tri-Dot Productions:\"The power source (of the craft) is a reactor that uses Element 115 as afuel and uses a total annihilation reaction that provides the heat that itconverts to energy, making it a compact, light-weight, efficient onboardpower source. I've got a couple of quick comments about Element 115 for those who areinterested. By virtue of the way it's used in the reactor, it depletes veryslowly and only 223 grams of Element 115 which is just under half apound can be utilized for a period of 20 to 30 years.This demonstrates the enormous amount of power released when youtotally convert matter to energy, which is what happens when anti-matterand matter are combined. So, back to our power source. Inside the reactor, Element 115 is bombarded with a proton which plugsinto the nucleus of the 115 atom and becomes Element 116 whichimmediately decays and releases or radiates small amounts of anti-matter.The anti-matter is released into a vacuum into a tube that keeps it fromreacting with the matter that's around it. It's then directed towards thegaseous matter target at the end of the tube. The matter and anti-mattercollide and annihilate, fully converting to energy. The heat from thisreaction is converted into electrical energy in a near 100% efficientthermoelectric generator. This is a device that converts heat directly intoelectrical energy.\"According to government insiders, all of this was and still is - kept under a TOPSECRET government order of secrecy in the interests of national security.If it's true that some isotope of Element 115 has been maintained in a stableform at S-4 Area 51 for decades, it would come as quite a shock to a team ofRussian and American scientists who announced on February 1st that they hadfinally produced four atoms of Element 115 that until now had only beentheorized, but never observed.It's especially interesting that the scientists deliberately went looking forElement 115 because it is supposed to be theoretically in a more stable region ofradioactive elements as the numbers of neutrons and protons increase in thePeriodic Table of Elements. But the scientists found Element 115 by slammingatoms of calcium against larger americium atoms at almost the speed of light.The result is so fleeting, so unstable, that the Element 115 isotope producedhung around for less than 100 milliseconds before decaying into Element 113and lower elements on the Periodic Table."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Element 115 Ununpentium decay chain: to Element 113 Ununtrium, to Element 111Unununium,to Element 109 Meitnerium, to Element 107 Bohrium, to Element 105 Dubnium.Graphic courtesy Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.This week I talked with one of the American scientists doing the Element 115research. He is Dr. Joshua Patin, nuclear chemist at the Lawrence LivermoreNational Laboratory in Livermore, California, about 60 miles southeast ofBerkeley. I asked why their specific interest in making Element 115.Interview:Members of the Lawrence Livermore National LaboratoryChemistry and Materials Science Directorate's Heavy-Elements Research Teamin January 2004 (l-r): Jerry Landrum (retired), Dawn Shaughnessy, Joshua Patin, PhilipWilk,and Kenton Moody. Not pictured: John Wild, Mark Stoyer, Nancy Stoyer,Jackie Kenneally, and Ron Lougheed (retired).Joshua Patin, Ph.D., Nuclear Chemist, Lawrence Livermore NationalLaboratory, Livermore, California: \"It was an experiment that had beenchosen because of its decay through Element 113. So, there was a notion at thebeginning of the experiment that if we saw the decay of Element 115, we wouldalso see the decay of Element 113. And those had not been seen before.AND IN THE HYPOTHESIS OF THESE HIGHER ELEMENTS, ISN'T ITTRUE THAT CONCERNING THE PERIODIC TABLE, PHYSICISTS HAVESPECULATED THERE WOULD BE A POINT SOMEWHERE AROUNDELEMENT 115 OR HIGHER WHERE THERE WOULD BE MORESTABILITY AND MAYBE EVEN A LONGER LIFE?True. When you are looking at the various isotopes that can be produced ofelements 114, 115, 116, even 113, there are some isotopes that have beenpredicted to have very long half lives. The region where initially it was proposedto have more stability was Element 114 with 114 protons. But we need to putmore neutrons in (to balance out the protons) and that's a whole other area interms of what kind of experiment we want to perform.With the current level of technology and types of targets like the americium 243and the beams that we used of the calcium 48, we can't necessarily quite getthere, but we can get close. That's why we've done these experiments."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"By doing the Element 115 and Element 113 experiment and in the past with thegroup of Element 116 and 114, we've shown that there is this enhanced area ofstability.The moment of collision between an accelerated calcium-48 ionand an americium-243 target atom which produced Element 115 that decayed into Element113and other decays.

COULD THERE BE AN ELEMENT 115 ISOTOPE THAT IS SOLID ANDCAN BE HELD IN THE HAND?Some day down the road, I think so. If it's true that we find something that islong enough lived. To hold something in your hand, you would need asignificant quantity of these atoms. We've produced four atoms of Element 115in a month. It would take you don't have enough time in the rest of the universeto create enough that you could hold in your hand through these same kinds ofproduction methods (that we are using). That's why I say a future technologymight allow us advances in terms of how much can be produced and the targetmaterial, maybe a better way of producing but somewhere down the road, theremight be a possibility, sure.AND SO WITH ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY, YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TOPRODUCE ELEMENT 115 IN ENOUGH QUANTITY THAT IT COULD BESOME KIND OF SOLID MATTER THAT COULD BE WORKED WITH ANDAPPLIED IN OTHER WAYS?Exactly.\" Robert Lazar's ExperienceI told nuclear chemist, Dr. Joshua Patin, about Robert Lazar's alleged work morethan a decade ago with a stable form of Element 115 at the Top Secret S-4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"facility in Area 51 at Nellis AFB in Nevada. I asked him if he knew anythingabout such United States government research?Dr. Patin: \"Only from what I've read, probably similar to what you've read inthe past week doing my own searches on Element 115 in my case, just to seewhat had been published about our current work. I just wanted to see how manyarticles had been written about the work we've done so far. But I came acrossthis and hadn't read it before. I wasn't familiar with it whatsoever.All I can say now is that the Element 115 we're creating lives less than 100milliseconds. There is no way that you could ever have enough of the particularisotopes that we've created to hold in your hand with the current productionmethods that we have.BUT IF HIS STORY WAS CORRECT AND OUR GOVERNMENT HASSOME KIND OF SOMETHING FROM AN OFF-PLANET SOURCE THAT'SSUPPOSED TO BE IDENTIFIED AS A STABLE FORM OF ELEMENT 115,IT IS FEASIBLE THAT SOMETHING WITH ADVANCED TECHNOLOGYCOULD MAKE SOLID FORM OF ELEMENT 115?Well, only in the sense that our theories say now there is this enhanced region ofstability. Hypothetically, if this story is true or proved true and accepted by theheavy element science community it would be probably be a form of Element115 that had more neutrons than the ones we have created. I mean that's all Ican say. If you are talking about Element 115 that's stable in the sense that youcould hold it in your hand, that's what I would think it would have to have moreneutrons. What we know, what theory has predicted about the region, we wouldneed to put in more neutrons to increase the life time or the half life of theactivity to the point where it would be stable. I don't know that I would like tohold it in my hand, considering it would still be somewhat radioactive but,maybe these things have half lives of maybe millions of years. I don't know. Thatpart of the theory I don't know. Right now, for us and the community doing theproduction like we are doing with these experiments we can only go so far.With what we are seeing, we are seeing the possibility that everything we'vecreated has very short life times. However, significantly longer than anythingelse around them, which is why we are calling it an island of stability. We're juston the shoals or the beach and getting closer and closer.IF YOU HAD THE TECHNOLOGY TO ADD NEUTRONS TO WHATYOU'VE ALREADY BEEN ABLE TO SEE IN THE COLLIDER, YOU MIGHTEND UP WITH MATTER THAT WE KNOW WOULD BE STABLE ENOUGHTO SIT ON A TABLE?I think the technology would have to be completely different. I think in ourcurrent experiments, even if you added more neutrons, you are still only goingto produce a certain number of atoms 10, 15, 20 or whatever. You need millionsand millions and millions of these before you'd have something that let alonecould see or put in your hand to hold. So, I mention this along the lines thatwhat we do, you wouldn't use what we do as a production method. It's purely anobservational sense.Also along those lines if it is something that lives as long as I guess what you aresaying, it's nothing we would see. We see the decay of these elements throughtheir radioactive decay. And we can see them because they have such short lifetimes, such short half lives. So during the course of an experiment, we expect adecay to occur. If they weren't radioactive and were stable, we would never seethem. We only see the energy that is given off in their decay.So, it's along those lines. If the lifetimes increase, it becomes increasingly moredifficult to see them. That's something that will be corrected for and there areother ways to do these experiments where you are not relying on theirradioactivity to see them, but you can separate them other ways in the chance ofseeing them if they have longer half lives. That's when you start producing themin chemical experiments where you can tell by their chemistry if they are"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Element 115. That's in the future. That's not right now. And you definitelywouldn't use our particular method for doing what we've seen to produceanything like that.From what you've told me in terms of handling it with your hand, you don'twant to handle radioactivity with your hands. So if it's something that is stablewhere there is no concern about radioactivity and this is just in general you arenot going to have radioactivity (to test), therefore you are going to have to usechemistry to identify some chemical method to identify what you have. Andthat's only with massive quantities something that is stable like that, that's whenchemistry is involved.AND HYPOTHETICALLY IF YOU WERE ABLE TO TAKE THE ELEMENT115 THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PRODUCE IN THE COLLISION OFTHE CALCIUM ION WITH THE AMERICIUM AND ADD MORENEUTRONS TO IT, HYPOTHETICALLY IT COULD BECOME A STABLENON-RADIOACTIVE PIECE OF MATTER, ELEMENT 115?I don't know. That would be something for us to discover. I don't know enoughabout what the theory predicts for the region (on the Periodic Table) to say ifthat could happen. I don't know if the life times are long enough to get to thepoint that they are stable and not radioactive.\"More Information:Dr. Patin says that Elements 113 and 115 can now be added to the PeriodicTable of Elements and probably Element 116 which is the limit to what atomicphysicists have seen so far. After that, he and his colleagues are going toexperiment to see if they can find Element 118 which will be the outer frontierof elements in human physicsBut there is the nagging question: Are there other intelligences out there that areso beyond human knowledge and technology that they can use a special isotopeof Element 115 - that is stable - to warp gravity, space and time so they cantravel in quick jumps around the cosmos?We b s it e :http://www-cms.llnl.gov/e113_115/index.htmlhttp://www-cms.llnl.gov/e113_115/images.htmlhttp://www.webelements.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
