While his mystique hasproduced a few 'Henry Watchers' who wonder about his real role in the UFO dramaor his unabashed ways to get a compromising response from sensitive sources suchas Dr. Eric Walker, others praise him for his exposure of a con-artist in the SouthAfrican crash/retrieval affair. Now, into Soviet UFO affairs, he combines hiswherewithal, with author Bruce Cathie of New Zealand to submit the followingreport from Valerey Dvuzhilnyi of the USSR:Valery Dvuzhilnyl, USSR: 'On Saturday, November 28, 1987, thirty-threeUFOs were flying at a low altitude over the eastern coast of Primorye. Theirflight took place between 9 - 10 p.m. and midnight. Different types of UFOscould be seen amongst them: cylinder, cigar and globe-shape. They wereflying over five regions and well over twelve settlements. Witnesses thoughtthey saw an aircraft crashing. Everyone of them were surprised to hear nonoise associated. Inquiries made by the investigators later showed that therehad been no flights of either civilian or military aircraft at that time. Nocarrier-rockets had been launched either from Soviet cosmodromes. The samewas the situation on the previous occasion on January 29, 1986. The objectsobserved had absolutely nothing in common with the effects of rocket-launching, which are quite different. They were not like fire-balls orball-lightning or plasmoids either. Weather report on November 28, 29 and 30, 1987, indicated no clouds orprecipitation. Wind factor: Northwest, 7 m/s, direction 320 degrees. Thedirection of the wind did not coincide with the direction of flight path ofUFOs. There was no thunder flows either. Ball-lightning is exceedingly rare inthat region. Out of thirty-three UFOs, thirteen flew over Dal' negorsk, four over RudnayaPristan, various other settlements reported seeing one UFO each. Theconclusion would be that their prime target was Dal' negorsk. UFOs flew as if having one collective objective. They changed course,direction, speed, rounded the mountains, flew over river valleys. The lowaltitude at which they were flying made radar tracking impossible. Their pathgave the impression that they were directed by an intelligent mind. The lowaltitude might have served as a radar camouflage. This happened 23 months after the report of a damaged UFO in 1986, overMount 611. There five objects hovered over Dal' negorsk, and one over"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Rudnaya Pristan. Those hovering over Dal' negorsk lit the area with thepulsating lights and searchlights. It appeared as though they were looking forsomething, maybe for the UFO which had crashed in 1986, or its traces andstudying the size and the volume of the catastrophe. It is quite possible that the damaged UFO was an automatically controlledscout probe. It was about 0,5 x 1.5 meters in diameter. Such small craft arenot necessarily made or delivered from the outer space. They could have beenmade on Earth, with the available elements. It has been proved by the isotopeanalysis of the lead that it belongs to the mineral deposit in the NorthernPribaikalye. The lead might have been used to repair the UFO, or for refueling the power,or plasma engine installation. The nature of iron isotopes is not clear yet towhether it is cosmic or terrestrial. The fact that the visitors from space apply technology on our planet, includingmetal extraction from terrestrial ores and utilize them, has been proven by thefollowing evidence: 1978, geologist Popov found a piece of metal plate fivekilometers away from Dal' negorsk. Its dimensions were 1 x 0.70 x 0.60meters. It was four to six inches thick. (Note: A similar plate was found inNorth American Arctic region in 1950s and examined by Canadian engineer,Wilbert Smith. A larger chunk of it, by mistake, was sent to Japan to berecycled because of its purity.) One of the authors climbed that mountain seven times in pursuit of somesamples, but without any success. Eventually, when this author went to seekPopov's assistance, he found out that four days before, Popov had died of aheart attack. The same was the fate of the head of the lab analyzing the platein question and its composition. Eventually, a piece of the plate was found in a private collection. Thedisappearance of the main chunk of the plate in itself is a puzzle! The plate was made of zinc. Its weight might have been no less than a half aton, meaning that it could have been shifted by the help of a crane or severalindividuals. Further inquiries at the enterprises and firms in Dal' negorskyielded no results. Nobody had ever seen the plate or heard of it. The chemical analysis of the plate-sample proved to be unusual. It containedno cadmium, one of the components of zinc. The purest zinc is considered tocontain 0.02% cadmium. Besides, there was too little silver in it. The localplants never melted zinc of this kind or molded plates of this size. Also, it isimpossible to make zinc by primitive methods. It is made only by electro-thermic treatment without oxygen. Also, in several incidents, the UFO samples or the photofilm pictures results ofsome analyses have been missing without any logical explanations, indicatingthat the organization is under some sort of control. Thus far, four people hadwitnessed the disappearance of a large piece of the sample from Mount 611. Apiece of ceramic crucible with a sample disappeared in the powdery metalindustry laboratory. It fell down on the floor and simply vanished. Ourcolleagues in Tomsk failed to find the quartz thread. In April, a tight plate ofquartz threads vanished in Vladisvostok. It was placed in the electronicmicroscope. It occurred after filling the vacuum with god dust. It seems that UFOs aim to lead all scientific research into a dark alley andnonsense.The next sign of their technology is a discovery of chrome alloy in Dal'negorsk, and near Kavalerovo. It contains 96% chrome, 0.11% nickel, 0.5%aluminum, 0.29% iron, 0.002% silver, 0.00029% gold, 0.06% cobalt, 0.003%cadmium, 0.007% copper, 0.008 zinc, 0.01 manganese. The results of thespectral analysis are as follows: lithium 1%, calcium 1.3%, arsenic 1%, silicon1%, scandium 0.005%. The rest of the elements, with very small percentage,are platinum, lantanium, strontium, iridium, renium. The composition is highly unusual due to the fact that there are no chromedeposits in the Far East of USSR. Secondly, the industries have never madechrome of this composition. The sample found in Dal' negorsk is a shapelesslump. It weighs about 50 60 kilograms and is non-magnetic, while the samplefound in Kavalerovo is highly magnetic. Number of UFO landing sites havebeen examined in that region. The mountain rock and metal samples are found"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"to be highly magnetic in these sites. The space debris from Sputniks, spacerockets and aircraft are known to be non-magnetic. We consider the hypothesis of V. Salnikov, a candidate of geological andmineralogical sciences from Tomsk to be invalid and groundless. Salnikovbelieves that the cause for the destruction on Mount 611, on January 29,1986, was a natural plasmoid. This could be refuted because:1. The time during which the destruction occurred was one hour.Plasma is known to exist for several seconds only. It could not flyhaving 60 grams of various metals (titanium, natrium, iron and someother element).2. Ionic plasma substance could not have created large pieces of leadweighing about 4 5 grams each. There were eight such pieces. Ionicplasma could have created only dust-like metals.3. It is impossible to collect or absorb 60 grams of lead and iron duringthe flight. The atmospheric concentration should have been 4,000 timesas much as maximum limit. There are no concentrations of this kindeven near the furnaces.4. While destroying plasmoid could not have magnetized flints. It couldhave caused only high temperatures. So, is it possible that on November 28, 1987, a great number of UFOs weresearching for the damaged UFO on January 29, 1986? After all, they werehovering in the sky sending searchlights on the ground. The tops of themountains and hills in the northwest direction. Probably, before itsdestruction, it had sent a powerful signal into space. The crash spot might have been spotted by the UFOs flying over Dal' negorskon November 28, 1987. It was discovered thanks to six spots of magnetic flint.Four UFOs were registered to have flown over Mount 611. On February 6,1986, eight days after the UFO crash, there appeared from the north twoyellow globes at 8:30 p.m. They approached the crash site, made four circleruns over the area and disappeared with a flash (of light). The massappearance of UFOs on November 28 was sighted by workers, representativesof intelligentsia, militiamen, military men. In all, over 100 people witnessedthe 33 sightings. These objects caused a two minutes cutting off of HF TVcircuits, telegraph lines and other appliances. Computers were also cut off.Their programs spoiled. The cause was the presence of very powerfulelectromagnetic field caused by the presence of UFOs. Incandescent lampsand 220 volt circuits were not affected by this EM field. 93% of UFOs appearwhen the moon is full or new. When the moon is in perigee, it is closer toEarth. The isotope (lead) analysis have proved that it is neither of space nor of Dal'negorsk origin. Its age is identical to those of Kholodnenskoye lead depositregions, North Baikal. Doctor U. Pooshkarev (Geology, Leningrad)corroborated the idea of secret UFO exploitations of Kholodnenskoye leaddeposit for their own purposes. The lead could be used as the plasma enginefuel. The holes in the lead balloons are identical to those from industry plasmaplants. It seems that they do not require to carry large quantity of lead duringtheir flights, if there is a possibility to exploit certain regions of the Earthsurface. That means they have vast knowledge about our mineral deposits. Certain efforts have been made to determine their mining capabilities andtechnology applied. There are some holes made by laser rays. Their diameteris about two inches. One can see vitrification of the hole edges. (Editor's Note:Vitrification cools substances to form a glass without disturbing theirstructure.)Also, an unknown chromium alloy has been found. One of the patterns ismagnetized. The magnetization is identical to the pattern from the Mount 611.This magnetization is indicative of a super-power electromagnetic fieldcreated by UFOs. These fields seem to have some significant relevance intheir propulsion systems. The 'netting' pattern observed in the sample is almost impossible toinvestigate, even with the most up-to-date devices. It is carbon in glassycondition. Absolutely amorphous, with separately standing atoms of 5 - 18elements. It is not dissolved in any acid. If one tries to put it in the liquidnitrogen, it is attracted by the magnet though the ferrum is perfectly covered.It is impossible to find out the cause of these magnetic properties. Thepresence of high percentage of potassium (K) and sodium (Na) in the samplesmight be caused by the UFOs' thermonuclear reactions. But, these reactions"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"are ecologically clean. They could not have caused the radiation of the soil. The UFO which made a crash landing on January 29, 1986, was spotted at7:55 p.m. Its speed was 15 m/s. The unidentified object seen over Dal' negorsk(Soviet Union) on January 29, 1986, at 7:55 p.m., had a solid cover that wasball-like and was stainless steel color. It did crash land at the altitude of 611meters, leaving behind samples of steel alloys, ferrous balls, and the so-called'netting' type samples. It also had strange effects on the humans, animals andradio sets. The samples of ferrous balls have a very high degree of solidity. Itcould not be cut by steel instruments, but only by diamond. These have verycomplex composition. They contain almost all the elements in the Mandeleyevtable, such as Fe (iron), Mn (Manganese), Ni (Nickel), Mo (Molybdenum), W( Tungsten ), and SiO2 (Silica dioxide, or quartz sand), Co (Cobalt), Cr(Chromium). Whence melted in the vacuum, strange glass-like structuresappear. The carbides of the metal elements are absent. View of alleged UFO crash site on hilltop in Dal' negorsk, eastern Siberia.Xerox copy of photograph provided by Michael Hesemann, Germany.Soviet scientists investigating site of alleged UFO crash in 1986 on hilltop in Dal' negorsk,near city of Vladivostok in eastern Siberia. Photo courtesy of Michael Hesemann. As mentioned before, the sample of the 'netting' element is made ofamorphous carbonaceous materials with metal atoms standing separately. Thebasic elements carbon basis, Zn (Zinc), Ag, Au, La, Pr, Si, Na, K, Co, Ni, Yand many others. It is almost impossible to interpret its structure. It resists theacids. When a temperature of 2800 Centigrade is applied to it in the air, someelements would disappear and new elements appear instead. In vacuumheating, gold, silver and nickel disappeared and molybdenum and berylliumsulfide appeared. The latter disappeared after five months. This does prove,however, that we are dealing with artificial materials. The great quantity oforganic matter might be the sign of a type of life still unknown to us. Before the heat application, the 'netting' is a dielectric substance. During thecourse of the heating, it becomes a semi-conductor and in vacuum heating, itis a conductor. After three years, the site of this incident still has some effecton the humans. It effects the blood and causes reduction in leukocyte andbacilli increase. It also causes high blood pressure, fast pulse and sense ofunknown fear. The site still affects the film imprint and simply erases it. The flint samples collected from the site are magnetized. But to magnetize aflint is as impossible as magnetizing a brick!\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The site suffered a temperature of 4,000 C. during the crash, and the radiation of anunknown nature. Vegetation are still affected by this radiation.The chemical composition of the steel alloy and the iron corresponds with the highcontent in peat after the Tunguska so-called meteorite aerial explosion (June 30,1908): Pr (Praseodymium), La (Lanthanum), Y (Yttrium), Pb (Lead), Zn (Zinc), Fe(Iron). The type of the radiation is identical. It is obvious that we are dealing with aspacecraft of an unknown civilization.Although the 1987 sighting of 33 UFOs were traced as far back as Sea of Japan and13 of them passed over Dal' negorsk, hovering and illuminating the site of theincident with their searchlights which gave the impression that they were looking forsomething. But more importantly, there was the report of a landing in January 1989,only 200 meters from the actual place of incident. In our research of these series ofincidents, we have employed computers, laser microscopes and good professionaladvice by the scientists in various fields. Analyses were conducted by professionals.In four of the 'netting' samples, alpha-quartz threads were found. Their thickness is17 microns. They were rolled up in an accurate plait and fused into the netting. Thegold wire was inside every thread. Such technology and precision is just impossiblefor our present technological capability of our civilization. They might serve as amicrocable in orientation system. Quartz is an ideal insulator and gold is an excellentconductor.Despite the Earth Light theory, it is proved that UFOs do fly over the geologicalfractures. It is quite possible that they do harness the released energy from thesemagnetic lines. An advanced civilization could easily use the fracture energy asnatural radio-range beacons and fly with their help in any weather condition. Today,we, too, can determine these fractures with the help of up-to-date sensors orregistering devices. These devices can sense fracture energy spaced around ourlandmarks. As it is widely known, fracture energy has existed for millions of years.Dal' negorsk fracture is a meridian type, dating back to Triassic period. It would notbe impossible to assume that this unknown civilization has had the surface charts -not the parallel meridian charts. One with fracture coordinates system. Those chartscould have been obtained from the ancient times by paleocontacts to serve theirpurpose today.\"Len Stringfield:If Valery Dvuzhilnyl's (USSR) disclosure, like Popovich's, is based on factual data, itis significant for several reasons:"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"1. That it provides a rare peak into the technological and/or physical aspect of theUFO phenomena.2. That it might be a signal that more information can be expected to surface as aresult of the newborn freedom of a former powerful and suppressive adversary(nation).3.
