S. Postal Service letter carrier who had worked for BendixCorporation as a machine tool technician in its contract with the Apollo program at CapeCanaveral, Florida. Apollo 11 was the first mission to put the American flag and humanfootprints on the moon. Its commander was aerospace engineer Neil A. Armstrong. Thelunar module pilot was USAF Col. Buzz Aldrin and the command module pilot was USAFLt. Col. Michael Collins. Left to right: 1969 Apollo 11 Commander Neil A. Armstrong; command module pilotUSAF Lt. Col. Michael Collins; lunar module pilot USAF Col. Buzz Aldrin. Photograph courtesy NASA. Before Bendix, Jim served with the U. S. Navy from February 1962 to June 8, 1966, andspent time along the Vietnam coast. He did not see any unusual unexplained aerialphenomena in Vietnam, but during the 1960s around Cape Canaveral, he saw so manystrange objects and beams in the sky - sometimes linked to the sudden, aggressiveappearance of military helicopters and jets - Jim began to wonder if \"something big\" wasgoing on between the U. S. government and whatever was in the unidentified objects thatthe public and media commonly lumped under the popular slang, \"UFOs.\" In an excerpt from his e-mail, Jim Oglesby wrote: \"I have kept a UFO story inside my brain since the initial UFO event that happenedDecember 30, 1967. I think the time is now to bring it forward.In 1967, I was 27 and working at the Cape. I worked for Bendix. I was lucky in thatway because the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) was just a stone's throw from theBendix complex. Launch pad 39 set in the background. When an Apollo rocketroared off the pad on its way to the moon, all I had to do was step outside my officeand watch the history-making moon mission Apollos. An experience that always touched me deeply. I was visiting my parents during NewYear's Eve weekend 1967.At the time, my in-laws (who were also there) lived in a mobile home in Bithlo.Bithlo is about 32 miles west of the Cape. At the time the area was sparselypopulated. Several ranches, a few homes, and a cluster of mobile dwellings madeup the populace. Saturday night, December 30th, a cold front had settled over thestate and temps were predicted to drop into the mid-forties. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Bithlo, Florida 32 miles west of Cape Canaveral Space Center.My brother-in-law and I were standing in the kitchen making coffee when an amberlight reflected through the kitchen window that faced east. I reacted by throwingopen the front door and staring outside expecting a meteor to hit the earth. InsteadI watched an amber ball of light about the size of a basketball just hovermomentarily in front of the mobile home and about a hundred feet east of thetrailer. The amber ball then vanished, but before it did, I caught a glimpse of theouter rim and the silver metallic underside of a circular object before it vanishedinto the darkness.Moments later, a beam of cone-shaped infrared light shot out from the bottom ofthe mysterious object. The beam of light went off and on several times. I got thefeeling that the extra-terrestrials were looking for a specific landing site. Then theobject was joined by another object that came in from its right, obviously fromanother angle. The two objects dropped below the treeline and out of sight. Severalminutes later, jets and choppers appeared and began combing the UFO hotspotarea.\" There was a lot more in the e-mail and I asked for his phone number to follow up. On July18, 2004, I talked with Jim Oglesby on the record about some of his many eyewitnessexperiences of unexplained objects - and sometimes even other human interaction with thephenomenon. The following are highlights from that discussion, illustrated with Jim's digitaldrawings, beginning with the New Year's Eve 1967 weekend in which he visited hisbrother-in-law, John, and his family at their mobile home in Bithlo, Florida, about 32 mileswest of Cape Canaveral. Interview: Jim Oglesby, writer and retired U. S. Postal Service letter carrier 1977 to 1987;former machine tool technician for Bendix Corp.'s Cape Canaveral's Apollo 11program in the 1960s; U. S. Navy in Vietnam from February 1962 to June 8, 1966,now living in DeLand, Florida: New Year's Eve Weekend December 30-31, 1967, Bithlo, Florida \"My brother-in-law, John, and I moved into the kitchen and he was making a fresh pot ofcoffee. His trailer faces north and south. He had a small kitchen window that faced east.Suddenly an amber, golden glow reflected through that small window. And when it did, Iwas probably standing about three feet from the front door and I leaped to the front door. Imean, I leaped! I swung it open and stood on the porch and looked up. At that time of theyear, the moon just happened to be in a New Moon phase and it had already settled belowthe western horizon, so it was very dark outside.I looked up and saw an amber ball about the size of a football. I say amber ball, ambersphere, amber orb, and it seemed to be swirling with electrical properties. And as soon as Ilooked at it, it went out.WHY DID YOU THINK IT HAD ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES?Because inside of it, there was swirling, movement inside a confined area and it was likeswirling around. It was not just an orange ball or orange orb. It was active inside of itself ifthat makes any sense."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"December 30, 1967, at approximately 7:10 p.m. ET, Jim Oglesby watched an unidentified aerialobject fly over the mobile home of relatives on Sixth Street in Bithlo, Florida. Drawing © 2004 by JamesOglesby.This was about 100 feet above his mobile home and about 100 feet east of where I wasstanding. Just as it went out - and there was no sound to this. It was very quiet. Just as itwent out, I caught the outer rim of a circular object and the under belly of what seemed tobe a silver metallic substance. Then it was just swallowed up by the darkness.MEANING THAT IT SEEMED TO BE EITHER FADING OUT OR DISAPPEARING?Yes. It just seemed to fade out. It must have been two or three seconds later, right directlyeast and in line of where that orange orb had seemingly vanished, I saw a red beam of lightthat came on and it went off, came back on again, went off, came back on and went offagain. It was moving very swiftly and away from me because it was getting smaller as itmoved.\"Moments later a beam of cone-shaped red light emitted from the bottom of the craft and flashedoff and on several times as if preparing to land.\" Drawing © 2004 by James Oglesby.And then, there was darkness and I noticed a disk or round-shaped object and it had a rowof red flashing lights around the middle of it. The lights were flashing in a right to left andleft to right pattern. Within a second, another object moved up along the right of the firstone and one rose and the other descended. Then they alternated their up and down motionand started dropping rather like a falling leaf below the tree line. I thought pretty sure thatthey were about to land on the ground.\"Then the craft paused just above the tree line, hovered and a pattern of red lights began flashing aroundthe craft's midsection in a 5-4-3-2-1-1-2-3-4-5, right to left and left to right sequence. A second craft glidedin from the right and hovered alongside its companion. The two UFO's then floated like two leaves caughton the wind until they disappeared from sight below the tree line.\" Drawing © 2004 by James Oglesby."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Then I see some more lights east and right well beyond where the two craft or objects hadseemingly landed. They were getting closer and closer. Pretty soon, I could hear thefamiliar sound of blades thumping in the air and they were helicopters. There was a line ofhelicopters in a straight line formation and they were headed directly in the direction ofwhere I had just watched the two objects land below the tree line.\"Within minutes a single-line formation of helicopters drew nearthe UFO hotspot.\" Drawing © 2004 by James Oglesby.Then I noticed two jets and I could hear the roar of the engines were coming in from thesouth and they crossed the area where I watched the two objects settle below the tree line.They were very, very low. I thought they were going to clip the top of the trees becausethey were so low. They banked on out and turned around and they banked back north and Icould hear the roaring of the jet engines while I'm also watching the formation ofhelicopters. As it seemed like they were close to the spot (of the craft objects), they fannedout in a circle and they switched on these really brilliant lights. They were cone-shaped,they looked like search lights to me. They were flying around in a circle and the beams oflight were really doing some aerial surgery on the ground below.\"Then the choppers fanned out before directing their bright funnel-shaped beams of lighttoward the ground. Moments later two jets flew low and over the area where the two UFOs had seeminglylanded minutes earlier. Oddly, the helicopters and the two jets abandoned the area after a short timeof concentrating on the dark terrain below their aircraft.\" Drawing © 2004 by James Oglesby.They were trying not to miss a spot. And they did that for probably a minute to a minuteand a half. Then, oddly enough, they resumed their formation and headed back east, whichI thought was very odd because I had just watched two objects settle below the tree line inthe general area where they had approached. So, I thought that was very odd that the jetsand helicopters would leave so prematurely.IT MAKES YOU WONDER WHAT THEY EITHER DID OR THOUGHT THEY DIDTHAT THEN WOULD GIVE THEM A REASON TO LEAVE?Yes, exactly. That ended the activity for the time being. This event happened around 7:10p.m. that early evening and it was probably around 7:30 p.m. by the time the helicopterscame in and the jets had gone around. And the jets did not go back around again. Theymade one pass across there, banked, turned back around and headed back to base.THE HELICOPTERS STAYED?The helicopters left, too. They resumed their formation and I watched them as they headedback in a more southeast direction toward what would have been Patrick AFB.It's around 7:30 p.m. and I'm standing on the porch and I did not move from that positionfor hours and hours. I stayed right there locked on that area and I don't know why, but I"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"did. And around 1:50 a.m., I'm looking straight out where the two craft had seeminglylanded and one of the row of red flashing lights began to move above the trees. Once again,I could see a circular object from where I was and the row of red flashing lights weredefinitely right around the middle of this craft. And the red flashing lights were moving in aleft to right, right to left pattern. As the craft rose, that row of red lights got faster andfaster and faster as the craft continued to ascend.Then, it got up to an altitude and it began to change into a more glowing affect around thecraft. Then, it paused and shot up again and then from where I was looking, it seemed to beabout half the size of its original shape.WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF GLOW?Ve r y w h i t e .SO, IT WENT FROM RED LIGHTS THAT WERE ROTATING RAPIDLY TO ALLWHITE?Yes. When it rose to a certain position, as it was rising to a higher altitude, I could see thewhite starting to fill in the area where the red lights were, as if it were changing vibrationsor fading. The red lights seemed to be fading out as the white became more prominent.It paused. Then it went up in several very quick ascending spurts, and then it just hoveredthere and looked like a star in the sky, except it was definitely very brilliant and larger thanyou would think of a star. It sat there for a second. And then the eastern horizon lit up in avery white-orangish-golden color. And it fanned all across the eastern horizon.\"At approximately 1:50 a.m. New Year's Eve, one of the UFOs began rising above the darktopography until the mysterious intruder had climbed high enough to take on theappearance of a star.\" Drawing © 2004 by James Oglesby. Minuteman II Missile Launched from Cape CanaveralMoments later, a missile come up and you could see it rising in the air and it got up maybe50 degrees above the horizon. The star-like UFO zipped over to the left and came right upwhat looked to me to be very close to the rocket. It hovered there and then shot back overto the right and then it did a falling leaf pattern in the sky and then it shot off to the rightand paused. Then it was gone.WHEN YOU SAY MISSILE OR ROCKET, ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT A LAUNCHOF ONE OF OUR SHUTTLES FROM CAPE CANAVERAL?I'm talking about a Minute Man II rocket. I found out it was a Minute Man II missile thatwas launched from one of the launch complexes. There were two they launched from andthat is what happened."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"\"Suddenly, the eastern horizon exploded in brilliant orange and white light as a Minuteman 2 missilelaunched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station climbed swiftly above the Cape. The UFO then flew upalongside the fast-moving rocket momentarily, before it zipped to the right before pausing, drifted downlike a falling leaf, then shot to the right and vanished.\" Drawing © 2004 by James Oglesby.I'm going to jump ahead and we can come back to this point.... but in April of 1968, theNew Year, I was over at my parents on Easter weekend. I'm sitting in the living room andopened up what was then the Orlando Evening Star newspaper. It is no longer. It is nownot in operation, but back then it was part of the Orlando Sentinel. I was going through thenewspaper and found a special edition and pulled it and about flipped out! I said, 'I wasn'tcrazy!' It said, \"UFO Tracks Minuteman Missile Over Cape Canaveral\" and gave the dateand approximate time.DO YOU HAVE THIS NEWSPAPER?It ran in the UPI (United Press International) press and I believe the gentleman who wrotethe article was Dick Young. He's no longer alive. I think he was a PR rep for KennedySpace Center, but he had something to do with some of the operations because he wascertainly aware of this launch because someone had blabbed and it had become leaked.HOW OFTEN WERE THEIR MISSILE LAUNCH EXERCISES AROUND CAPECANAVERAL?That is interesting you should mention that because I did some research and found out that I contacted a historian, Mark Wade, over at the Cape. He's been keeping up with all thelaunches. I e-mailed him and asked him how many Minuteman launches had there beenand specifically, over the Cape. He said, 'For Minuteman I, II and III there were exactly 92launches.'I said, 'But there is only 91 listed in your chronology.' He said, 'I don't know why thatwould be.'I went back and researched and came up with only 91. The last one that was launched Ihave the date here but I believe it was in November 1967. That was the last Minutemanlaunch from Cape Canaveral.THAT THEY HAVE OFFICIALLY LISTED.Officially listed. So, I thought, 'Why would they not list that 1967 New Year's Eve launch?And what an odd time to launch a missile, you know?YES, WAS IT TRULY AN EXERCISE OR WAS IT INTENT UPON INTERACTINGWITH WHATEVER THIS OBJECT WAS THAT ROSE BACK FROM THE GROUNDAND UP INTO THE SKY?I think I would lean toward your implication because I've never heard of a launch going ona night like this New Year's Eve weekend.DID YOU EVER GET TO HEAR OR LEARN ANYTHING MORE OFF THE RECORDABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?OK, I found a website and at this time, I won't use the name because he asked that I notuse his name because evidently he worked during the Apollo program and was a very highprofile employee of NASA. He rubbed elbows with some of the astronauts and was veryfamiliar with some of the Minuteman launches. I e-mailed him and I gave him theDecember 30, 1967 event. He did not e-mail me until a couple of weeks later. Then he said,'I had to think about contacting you because of the sensitivity of this matter that is stillongoing about our Minuteman rockets and UFOs.'He also said, 'I know you are not lying because I know of the incident.' He said at the time,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"'his group' as he referred to it was well aware of the incident that I wrote about in mye-mail. He said, 'But not to the degree of detail that you shared with me in your letter.' So itwas known at the time.AMONG PEOPLE WHO WORKED AT CAPE CANAVERAL.Who worked at the Cape, yes.DID HE TELL YOU ANY INFORMATION THAT YOU DID NOT KNOW?You mean about that night?RIGHT, ABOUT THE OBJECT, ABOUT THE MISSILE, ABOUT THE JETS, THEHELICOPTERS?No, he said they had only known from what he heard that the missile had been launchedand its telemetry had locked onto the object. That was their take on it. Somebody had goneout and done a visual on the UFO and saw it from their perspective.The tracking and telemetry that works with the missile while it's going up locked, movedonto the UFO. I guess everyone at the launch control, whoever was in charge of destroyingthe rocket, they didn't know what to do because they couldn't - their rocket integrity hadbeen compromised. But evidently, it was on it for only a few seconds, and I can confirmthat, and I was actually watching it as it moved away from the rocket.AND THE PART THAT COULD ALWAYS BE HIDDEN FROM THE PUBLIC AND THEMEDIA THAT THERE HAD ACTUALLY BEEN A LOCK-ON INTERCHANGEBETWEEN A MINUTEMAN MISSILE OFF CAPE CANAVERAL WITH ANUNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT?Correct.AND WHY?Exactly. Why? - is still a mystery. This is the one out of all the UFO Minuteman missile-related events this one here is yet to surface publicly. Blue Flashing Light and Disturbed Cattle on February 27, 1969On Feb. 27, 1969, I returned to the corner of Fort Christmas Road and State Road 420,parked there again where I'd been two prior nights. And it's getting about dark and I'mfacing east and I'm looking across a field and there are probably 25 or 30 cattle that havebeen grazing and kind of huddled together in the corner by this fence. I'm standing thereand all of a sudden, the cattle get up and start running sort of like in a circle. I look up andthere is a flashing blue light. It's right above the field, probably 40 or 50 feet above the fieldand maybe a couple hundred feet away from me and it's sitting there flashing. then it goesout and here comes a jet just as low above the tree line as it could, comes flying in rightover that spot right where the flashing blue light was, roared right across, banked out to theleft, and went back to the base.WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CATTLE?The cattle were going crazy. Then the flashing blue light returned right back in the samespot that it was where the jet went over. It stood there and hovered and flashed for three orfour seconds and I'm standing there looking at it. then I get back in my car, and it leaves. Iwrite it down as an experience.YOU DID NOT SEE A DIRECT EXCHANGE OF A BEAM OF LIGHT COMING OUTOF THE BLUE OBJECT DOWN TOWARD THE CATTLE AT ANY POINT?No, I did not. It was definitely above them sitting there. Have you seen those 4th of Julysparklers?SURE .If you take one of those and fill it full of blue with just a lithe bit of white in it and have itflashing on and off, that's kind of what it reminded me of. It was not very brilliant. It didnot affect a lot of the area around it. It was contained.After I leave there, I drive down Old Fort Christmas Road, probably a couple hundredyards and pull off the road and park my car. I'm sitting there and all of a sudden, I look upand I could barely hear a noise and I'm looking up and can barely see in the darkness Ialmost had a heart attack! This huge, huge aircraft rose up just above the tree line and as"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"soon as it came up to where I could see it, I recognized it right away as a B-52. I knew thatright away. All of a sudden, I could hear the pilots did something with the engine because itlabored and then banked to the left and then below the B-52, out near the front of it, camethis brilliant light that looked like it would light up a football field. It went swish, swish,swish... a sequence of three flashes four times. Lights underneath came out fromunderneath the B-52 as it was moving very slowly just above the treetops. It shot out thissequence of brilliant flashes of light and I counted 12 of them, but they were in threesequence intervals.AS FAR AS I KNOW IN TERRESTRIAL AVIONICS, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN AB-52 THAT COULD JUST CREEP OVER TREES SLOWLY.I'm telling you, when I say slowly, that's been 30 some years ago I can go back andvisualize that. I know for a fact, it was just above treetop level. This thing is going to cut offthe top of the trees and moving very slow. Then it made a turn and the engines kind oflabored and then it did the sequence of lights.IS IT POSSIBLE THAT IT WAS SOMETHING MIMICKING WHAT A B-52 MIGHTLOOK LIKE?I went back and did a lot of research on the various B-52 models and what they do on theirnight reconnaissance stuff. I can get that info later on. What I gathered from the research,this could have possibly happened.Let me go a little further. The next night, I'm back in that same spot, and I'm parked thereand a car pulls up beside me and rolls down a window and says, 'What are you doing outhere?'I said, 'Do you really want to know the truth?'He said, 'Yes, I do.' I didn't know who he was at the time. I said, 'Well, do you believe inUFO?'His wife kind of snickered because she was with him. I related to him what had justhappened the night before. Because I was in that same location at about the same time andhe just happened to come along about that time, guess what popped up over the tree line nosooner than I had told him what I had seen the night before that I thought was a B-=52.ANOTHER BLUE LIGHT?A repeat of the night before with the B-52 and the lights.OH, NOT THE BLUE LIGHT, BUT THE B-51..No, the B-52.IT WAS NOT THE BLUE LIGHT FLASHING. IT LOOKED LIKE THE B-52 COMINGBACK OVER THE TREES AND FLASHING A SEQUENCE OF BRIGHT LIGHTSTHAT WERE WHITE AND FLASHED THEM IN A SEQUENCE THAT WOULD BEFOUR FLASHES A PAUSE, FOUR ...No, three. A sequence of three and an interval between each sequence of three flashes.SO IT WAS 12 FLASHES SEPARATED INTO THREES?Yes. Definitely as clear today to me.DID THOSE LIGHTS LIGHT UP AS BRIGHT AS DAYLIGHT ALL OF THE GROUND?Ye s .THEN WHAT HAPPENED?Then the farmer he got very still. He says, 'That's my property where that just happened,' isthe way he put it. He said, 'You're talking about UFOs. Let me tell you what just happeneda short while ago, just a few weeks ago. I had a young heifer which was one of my favoritelittle calves, so I had her in this nice elaborate pen to keep her in because she had a habit ofjumping out. So I built it up high enough to where there was no way she could get out.I was awakened one morning by a sound that sounded like a calf in distress. I walkedoutside and found the calf out of the pen standing in the middle of the road.' He said, 'Ithought that was the oddest, most strange thing because there was no way that cow couldhave gotten out of her pen.'I asked him, 'Have you been missing any cattle lately?' I had no idea where I was stepping."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"He looked at me and said, 'We have been missing so many cattle that we've had to haveongoing meetings with the Florida Cattlemen's Association because the cattle have beenmissing left and right and we have caught only a few rustlers could not in any way accountfor the epidemic of cattle that we've had missing around here.' That's the way he put it.ANY REPORTED CATTLE MUTILATIONS?One afternoon, either in March 1968 or April, I had two buddies come out with me oneafternoon. We had driven down past the corner of State Road 420 and Old Fort ChristmasRoad (near small town called Christmas, Florida).There is another road called Brown Road and we had drove down to the end of it. At thattime in 1968, it dead ended and there were some fruit trees hanging over the fence. So, I'mstanding on my buddy's shoulder and we're picking off some fruit off this tree. And this carpulls up and I said, 'Oh, no, we're in trouble.'But the car driver said, 'Don't worry. Go ahead and have some fruit.' So we started talkingand I mentioned UFOs and he says, 'You know what, back about 4 years ago we found aheifer out on our spread out here and I don't know why anybody would do this, but theanimal was our most friendly and one of our most the animal was just in the best of health.And we found the mouth open. We looked inside and the tongue had been removed. Hesaid, 'It was like as if somebody had come in with some special surgical tools and removedthe tongue.' He said it was so precise and it has always been a mystery. That ended theconversation.THAT WAS 1964 AND THE TONGUE WAS REMOVED.Ye s . \" Worldwide Animal MutiationsAs occurred in Florida in the 1960s, unusual deaths of cattle and other domestic and wildanimals with the same pattern of excisions have been reported by media around the worldsince the 1960s. Removal of the tongue vertically deep within the throat, often along withthe trachea and esophagus, has long been associated with classic \"animal mutilations,\" aphrase originally used by ranchers and sheriffs. The typical animal mutilation includesexcisions of an ear and eye on the same side of the head; the bone-clean removal of hideand tissue from that side of the head or the entire lower jaw; removal of udder and vulva infemales and removal of penis and testicles in males; and coring out of rectal tissue in nearlyall animals, regardless of age or gender.1976 Sterling, Colorado cow was typical of so many:circular excision of tissue around eye, eyeball removed from socket, tongue excisedfrom deep within throat, jaw stripped of all flesh, smooth excision of upper jaw bone and teeth.Dead only hours, animals like this were warm to touch when sheriffs reached the scene.Photograph by Logan County, Colorado Sheriff Tex Graves.In his 1998 book The Day After Roswell, U. S. Army Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso (nowdeceased) wrote on pages 180 -181:\"In the Pentagon from 1961 to 1963, I reviewed field reports from local and statepolice agencies about the discoveries of dead cattle whose carcasses looked asthough they had been systematically mutilated and reports from people who claimedto have been abducted by aliens and experimented on. ... Local police reported thatwhen veterinarians were called to the scene to examine the dead cattle left in fields,they often found evidence not just that the animal's blood had been drained, but thatentire organs were removed with such surgical skill that it couldn't have been thework of predators or vandals removing the organs for some depraved ritual. ... Wehad no medical instruments that even remotely approached what the aliens could do.It was as though some device had simply excised the organs with techniques thateven went beyond our own surgical precision. ... It was the EBEs (extraterrestrialbiological entities) who were experimenting with organ harvesting ...\""},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Continued in Part 2More Information:See An Alien Harvest and Glimpses of Other Realities, Volumes I and II at EarthfilesShop.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
