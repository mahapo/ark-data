Today, Jeffrey Wilson, Director, Independent Crop Circle Researchers Association(ICCRA), forwarded to me an e-mail from Hillsboro, Ohio farmers, along with aphotograph they took of mysteriously downed crop in their garden plot of corn. Theywrote: \"We have what most would refer to as a 'crop circle' in our garden plot of corn. Wenoticed it yesterday (July 5, 2004). We have contacted the local sheriff's departmentand he said it did not look like vandalism to him, but rather some type of natural orunexplained phenomena. No one has stepped into it yet, as I thought it might be ofinterest to someone.\" The unanswered question over the years: Does the same energy that creates the geometricformations cause randomly downed patterns as well in grass and cereal crops?
