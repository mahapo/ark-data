Computer simulation based on memory of a military officer who alleges he saw a photograph of a crashedsaucer near Farmington, New Mexico on file at a military base library open only to personnel with TopSecret access clearances. From Chuck Oldham's 1991 interview with the unidentified officer. Len Stringfield: \"Whatever the reason, the saucer's show of force over Farmington, New Mexico, inMarch 1950, was indeed a fact and a concern to officialdom. According to EdwardRuppelt, former captain and head of the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book, in hisbook The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects (© 1956):' ...the sky over the little town of Farmington ... was literally invaded by UFOs.Every major newspaper carried the story. The UFOs had apparently been"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"congregating over the four corners area on March 15 and 16, 1950. ButMarch 17 was the big day when every saucer this side of Polaris must havemade a successful rendezvous over Farmington because on that day, most ofthe town's 3,600 citizens saw the mass fly-by. ...Estimates of the numbervaried from a conservative 500 to 'thousands.' Most of the observers said theUFOs were saucer-shaped, traveled at almost unbelievable speed and didn'tseem to have any set flight paths. ...' For the compiler who lists UFO crashes and/or landings in New Mexico according tolocation and date, the task is simple. To the analyst, it is a can of worms. Obviously,in my analysis of the Chuck and Vicki Oldham report, the Aztec-Farmington crash,or crashes, is without resolution. But, again, as a compiler, my list continues to grow. I discussed the Oldham reportwith Tom Adams of Paris, Texas. He received his complimentary copy of the samereport from our mutual source (in their exchange of information relative to animalmutilations). As a result, I received still another crash story for the Aztec-Farmington area, but with a different year. I have known Adams as publisher of Stigmata, specializing in animal mutilations andUFO-connected research for countless years. In my opinion, his credibility is amongthe best in the business. I quote from his letter of June 2, 19091, as follows:'In July 1976, I spoke with a lady, Gloria H. (pseudonym) in Colorado (we hada mutual friend). Gloria told me that her husband's sister, Jane S. (anotherpseudonym), lived in Farmington and had information about a UFO crash nearthere in 1950. Gloria said that two people had seen a craft go down behind ahill between Farmington and Aztec, near the highway. (It is assumed, thoughnot known for certain, that it would be Highway 550). The two people, whowere apparently both in one car, stopped the car, walked to the top of the hillor ridge, and saw the object on the ground. They returned to their car, got acamera, walked back up the hill, and took photos of the object on the ground.Gloria then said that other motorists had seen the object and stopped to walkup the hill to take a look. The first couple returned to town (they lived inFarmington) and turned in their film for processing the same day. After theyreceived the photos and negatives, they were visited by 'military men' whoconfiscated the photos and the negatives. 'A few days later, on July 25, 1976, I spoke by telephone with Jane S. Sheessentially repeated her sister-in-law's story, with a few additions. Thewitnesses reported seeing a silvery cigar-shaped craft tumbling end-over-endthrough the air before it finally crashed or landed behind the hill. When thewitnesses topped the hill, they saw a saucer-shaped object on the ground - theobject that was photographed. Jane's interest in the story had recently beenrevived by conversations with Gloria. Not long before I talked to her, she hadtelephoned a man who had worked for the local paper (Farmington DailyTimes) at the time of the incident. In 1976, he was representing New YorkLife Insurance in Farmington. He told Jane the exact date of the incident -March 18, 1950. He said he did not recall the identities of the people whophotographed the object - but they went back the next day to find the objectgone and no traces to indicate it was ever there. The newspaperman was Clayton J. Boddy, business manager at the DailyTimes. He is described in news reports as one of the witnesses to the apparentmassive UFO over-flight above Farmington the previous day - March 17, 1950(actually, that was the third of three consecutive days of such over-flights). Clayton Boddy told Jane that he did not see the photos of the landed object,that he only heard about them. However, a mutual acquaintance of theirs toldJane that Boddy had indeed seen the photos and she couldn't understand whyhe wouldn't admit to it. In the conversation of July 25, 1976, Jane S. also related information about anapparent crash very near Los Alamos, New Mexico. According to herinformation, the event would have happened about three years previous to ourconversation, which would place it in the neighborhood of mid-1973. (I canremember hearing the slightest of rumors concerning a UFO crash near LosAlamos in 1973 or 1974.) Jane said the present (in 1976) fire chief inFarmington had lived in Los Alamos for fifteen years. He did not claim tohave witnessed the crash, but only to have 'heard about it.' He said it wasclose to the 'outer edge' of Los Alamos. He said the crash (or landing?) sitewas roped off and guarded. The fire chief said he had reason to believe the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"object was a 'space vehicle.' He moved to Farmington just after the crashoccurred. At the time, Jane talked to him in 1976, he was very ill. He told herin no uncertain terms that he did not want to talk to anyone else about theincident, nor did he want to become further involved in any way.' THE MYSTERY MIX; LANDINGS AND/OR CRASHES In my endeavor to evaluate the revelations of 'inside' informants, like 'Bob' and 'Dr.Epigoni,' and others with peripheral bits of information, I wonder about the thin lineof difference between some UFOs that are described as crash landings and others asjust 'landings' or as known in our jargon, touch-landings. Analytical guesses are not good enough; we need facts. But to get facts for ameaningful evaluation, we're on the wrong side of the secrecy wall. However, thereare hints or clues. Epigoni tells us about landings with aliens, or robots, in suspendedanimation; Bob tells us about a landing near White Sands Missile Range within afew days of the Roswell crash and, to pick out a couple more well-publicized cases,we should consider the Socorro, New Mexico, landing in 1964, when police officer.Lonnie Zamora, watched white-suited entities who seemed to be inspecting theirtroubled egg-shaped craft. Or, let's go back to an incident near West Palm Beach,Florida, in 1952, when scout leader, Sonny DesVerges, encountered a landed crafton the edge of a palmetto thicket. According to DesVerges, a grotesque creatureemerged and then he was hit by a ball of red fire, causing temporary time loss. Clues, yes. But in my mundane opinion, the evidence is only a superficial sampling.There are many other samples, too, for which there are no obvious parallels. One isof the grisly kind and if it were not for the integrity of my source, who experiencedit, I would prefer not to believe the story. I've known my source, a high-rankingarmy officer, for several years and I know that he is a straight-shooter. After someconsideration, he sent me the following report which occurred in Cambodia duringthe Vietnam War:'We have discussed this on several occasions. Let us just say that in April1972, members of a U. S. Army Special Operations group were involved in afire fight with the occupants of an identified alien craft. There were severalalien casualties and a single human death, although several were burned by anunknown weapon. The soldiers involved were questioned under narco-hypnosis and given a 'cover memory' of a much more benign nature. When thecovered memories resurfaced, the truth was that the platoon happened on agroup of aliens sorting human body parts (some of which were not native,they were white) into large bins and sealing them. A fire fight ensued and several of the aliens were killed after it was learnedthat the light silver-colored suits they were wearing were essentially bullet-proof. All but one of the alien casualties resulted from 'head shots.' One alienwas killed by 'friendly fire.' As the soldiers pulled back, several of the aliensquickly packed as much as they could. One pressed the side of the craft and a'gangway' slid down. They all scrambled into the opening, which disappearedas it closed. The hum from the craft increased as it rose and the 'legs' pulledinto the body. It then accelerated at a fantastic rate and disappeared fromsight. When the unit was picked up, a 'mop up' team cleared the area of anytrace. The body of the slain soldier began to decompose almost immediatelyafter death. The unit was held incognito for several days during theinterrogation and warned never to discuss the incident. Over the ensuing sixteen years, surviving members suffered nightmares aboutthe incident which were increasingly different from the cover given bypost-hypnotic suggestion. When the memories finally surfaced, all personnelinvolved had nearly identical memories. When agents of the responsibledepartment were queried as to why this was done, there was no denial of theincident - only that they had been 'buying time.' Then the unit wasinterrogated originally by military personnel and then by civilians who wereidentified as representatives of 'MAJIC.' They were familiar with this group asall unusual aircraft sightings were reported through channels to 'MAJIC,'although no one knew who they were. Enclosed is an illustration with legenddepicting the craft involved.' CRAFT ENCOUNTERED IN MILITARY OPERATIONNEAR TON LI SAP, CAMBODIA IN APRIL 1972."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Craft was polished, highly reflective, mirrored in appearance. Symbol onsurface seemed to be 'ground' and 'sandblasted' as it was less reflective. Noapparent opening or door was seen until just before departure. This wasevidently due to an extremely precise fit and the nature of materials involved.Although armor was not readily apparent, the surface was impervious to smallarms fire. The craft emitted a high-pitched hum (even while motionless on theground) and was otherwise nearly silent in its ascent. Legs appeared to be onecontiguous piece with a body, but withdrew into the orb during takeoff.Spherical in shape, the craft appeared to be approximately 50 feet in diameter.The encounter and the description of the object were reported directly tocivilians who identified themselves as representatives of 'MAJIC.' - Drawing and Text by U. S. Army Officer. NEW INVESTIGATION, NEW DATA, NEW BOOK; UFO CRASH ATROSWELL From my point of view, I can vouch for the co-authors, Don Schmitt's and KevinRandle's meticulous investigation before publishing their book, UFO Crash atRoswell (Avon). In their book, if there are voids in the chain of Roswell events, it isprobably because the source is deceased or unreachable or unwilling to respond,admitting that he has been sworn to secrecy. The authors, I know, have traveledeverywhere in the USA to track down sources. The following statement by the co-authors arrived June 1, 1991, just a week or sobefore release of their book:'Something highly unusual crashed in the high desert northwest of Roswell,New Mexico, in the summer of 1947. The United States military reported therecovery of a 'flying disc' and newspapers around the world carried theunprecedented story. The military acted quickly and efficiently in response to the initial report by alocal ranch foreman, issuing a press release that declared the recovery of anactual flying disc. Then, the military abruptly changed its original statement,officially classifying the object as a downed 'Rawin Target' balloon.Apparently, officers of the elite 509th Squadron, the only nuclear bomb wingin the world at that time, misidentified the remnants of a very commonweather device constructed of mere rubber, foil, wood and twine. And whilethe cover story was going into effect, 50 to 60 troops were retrieving theactual debris, craft and its crew from two separate sites on the heavilycordoned ranch. The true wreckage, unlike anything the men had ever seen orhandled, defied all conventional explanation. Major Jesse Marcel, intelligence officer of the 509th, reported: '...I was certain...that it was not a weather balloon, not an aircraft, nor a missile. It wassomething else, we didn't know what it was.' Nine known flights transported the mysterious debris from Roswell underheavy security to at least three government installations. The men who tookpart in the recovery were sworn to secrecy and one of the most significantevents in the history of mankind faded into obscurity. The truth about Roswell was not resurrected until Marcel revealed his role toa reporter, thirty years after the press asked its last question. The provost marshal, who supervised all security measures at the crash-site in1947, told us that he considered himself still sworn to secrecy forty-threeyears after the event. So did an intelligence operative who assisted the specialoversight team from Washington, D. C. One of the MPs directly involved in"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the recovery of the bodies told us the same. However, even though more than a half-dozen reliable sources give the chiefcounter-intelligence officer a key role in the recovery, he denies even thedowned weather balloon. There is absolutely no denying the government cover-up of what reallyhappened at Roswell, a suppression that continues today. Recently, an even more disturbing aspect of the sinister nature of Roswell hasbeen uncovered. It has been reported to us by six separate witnesses that notonly did the United States government resort to physical intimidation againstthem, but included death threats to their children. We are fortunate to havesecured video depositions of a number of them, where they recount theirordeals with extreme emotional distress. The question becomes quite obvious. What event would require:1. The detainment and coercion of the rancher for a full week? 2. Aerial over-flights which located the second site and the discovery ofthe craft and crew? 3. Extreme security measures at both sites and at all outlying roads? 4. Fifty to sixty troops who took at least two days to complete the cleanup of debris at the site? 5. Special teams from Washington, D. C., including a Secret Serviceenvoy representing President Truman? 6. At least nine flights to transport the wreckage? 7. Sworn oaths of secrecy to key individuals that remain in effecttoday? 8. Use of death threats to insure both military and civilian cooperation? At present, we are confident that - if given our day in court - Roswell couldvery well prove the reality of UFOs. Roswell also makes the possibility ofother reported CRASH/RETRIEVALS a very real probability. We seek theassistance of all witnesses to all such reported incidents. We also urge all those who have witnessed any of the events surrounding theRoswell incident to add their testimony to the hundreds who have alreadycome forward, as we seek Congressional support for a full investigation. If wefail to act on this opportunity, which grows increasingly urgent, we fear thesereports of crashed UFOs will tragically become nothing more than a collectionof mundane anecdotal information. 'VERIFICATION IS MY MIDDLE NAME' - STANTON FRIEDMAN Len Stringfield: \"Stanton Friedman needs little introduction as he is a popularfigure in UFO research. Residing in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, Friedmanhas B.S. and M. S. degrees from the University of Chicago. He worked as a nuclearphysicist for GE, General Motors, Westinghouse, Aerojet General Nuclearonics andTRW. Having lectured extensively and written many papers on every aspect ofUFOs, including Roswell and MJ-12, I felt that a statement from him was a must. Hesent me the following by fax on July 2, 1991:Crashed Saucers © 1991 by Stanton Friedman: 'Because I am a scientist and have lectured on the subject 'Flying Saucers AreReal' at more than 600 colleges and to dozens of professional groups in all 50states and 8 Canadian provinces, and appeared on hundreds of radio and TVprograms, it should not be surprising that people tell me stories about UFOs ingeneral and crashed saucers in particular. My approach to the crashed saucersstories has been rather different from that of Len Stringfield, who has becomea magnet for leads about crashes and had collected and published a largenumber of such leads. I have devoted most of my attention to in-depthinvestigations of the few crashed saucer cases occurring in New Mexico inJuly 1947, with some effort regarding later cases there. Verification has"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"become my middle name. Naturally, I have a large 'gray' basket for theunverifiable. I am proud of the fact that I was the first researcher to talk in-depth withMajor Jesse Marcel, the Intelligence Officer for the 509th at Roswell; to Vernand Jean Maltais who told me of their friend Barney Barnett's encounter withan almost intact downed UFO with four alien bodies in the Plains of SanAgustin (or San Augustin or Saint Augustine); with Walter Haut, the PIO atRoswell; with Glenn Dennis, the mortician in Roswell whose nurse frienddescribed alien bodies to him; with General Thomas J. DuBose, who wasdirectly involved in the Ft. Worth end of the cover-up of the Roswell crashretrieval; and with Gerald Anderson, present with other family members at theBarney Barnett San Agustin site, and a host of others. I was irked by the false picture of the Roswell investigation by Howard Blumin his loaded-with-errors book (Ref. 1). I made major contributions to thebook, The Roswell Incident (Ref. 2) and a number of later papers (Ref. 3) byBill Moore and myself and was heavily involved - thanks to the Fund for UFOresearch - in investigating the related Operation Majestic 12 documents (Ref.4, 5) and a new effort to collect data from Roswell witnesses (Ref. 6). My primary goal is verification of stories, prior to publication. I have learnedwell how to find people and not to trust sincerity as a basis for determiningtruth. I have also proven that several great stories were a mix of fact andfiction. I am pleased that apparently my substantial efforts to instigate anUnsolved Mysteries program on the Roswell story were successful. On myown, at their expense, I managed to track down Sappho Henderson, wife ofpilot Pappy Henderson whose initially unsubstantiated story Len Stringfieldtold (Ref. 7). Thanks to her giving me names of a number of friends, Imanaged to track down independent supporting testimony about Pappy's storyas noted in my 1991 MUFON paper (Ref. 8). Len was right. The Gerald Anderson story was the focus of much of my Roswell retrievalresearch work sponsored by Robert Bigelow in the second half of 1990. I gotGerald together with John Carpenter, a psychiatric social worker, who didsome memory enhancement hypnosis sessions with Gerald and subtly testedhis veracity. Anderson, Carpenter, Bigelow, myself, and Aviation writer, DonBerliner, with whom I am writing a book about crashed saucers, spent threedays together in New Mexico. It was only after all this, that I spoke with aSpringfield, Missouri newspaper reporter (Ref. 9) about the case. He hadalready talked to John and Gerald. I find it very distressing that some peoplein UFOlogy want to dismiss Gerald's story without doing any investigation. It seems apparent in the case of Kevin Randle and Don Schmitt's new book(Ref. 10), that they will do anything to back up their initial and, I believe,demonstrably false, conclusion that there was only one crash on the Brazelranch southeast of Corona with bodies being found a few miles away. As ithappens, there is much evidence that Barney Barnett's experience indeed tookplace in the Plains and is the same story as Gerald's, and great evidence thatBarney was never near Corona in 1947. Randle's and Schmitt's only contactwith Gerald Anderson was a single phone call. They also dismiss theOperation Majestic 12 documents with no evidence and no references to themany papers and reports that have been published (Ref. 11). Uninformed attacks on Roswell have come from Philip Klass (Ref. 12) andJohn Keel (Ref. 13). Keel's Japanese Bomb balloon explanation is absurdindeed, with n evidence to back up the incredibly unsupported claims hemakes. Equally incomprehensible is the notion from respected researcherssuch as historian, Dr. David Jacobs, that governments can't keep secrets.Having spent 14 years working on highly classified R and D programs andhundreds of hours at a total of 14 archives and been duly impressed with theoutstanding work of Tim Weiner (Ref. 14) in demonstrating that the U. S.annual Black Budget is over $34 billion per year - I marvel at people whothink that secrets can't be kept. It is interesting, indeed, that Phil still has notbeen able to provide a clean copy of the 75% blacked out 21-page Top Secretaffidavit from the National Security Agency justifying withholding 156 UFOdocuments, nor any of those 156 NSA UFO documents, nor readable copies ofthe 13 CIA UFO documents the CIA admits withholding, or the many theyhaven't admitted, in keeping with their disregard for FOIA. Klass stillmaintains no secrets can be kept! I am especially disappointed with the Randle and Schmitt book because of its"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"use of propagandist reasoning, its casual dismissal of evidence that doesn't fittheir view of things, and because of their complete failure to even mention themajor support they received from the Fund for UFO Research, or the bunch ofMUFON papers about Roswell, the major reports on MJ-12, and theirresorting to anonymous sources when it suits them. I worked with them oftenand know they spent a lot of effort. About the best explanation I can find isthat Randle is too much accustomed to being a writer of fiction, havingpublished - according to him - 67 fictional books. Their book is only his third'non-fiction' work. The lines between what is, and what might be, havebecome heavily blurred. I certainly hope that the publicity associated with NBC's A Closer Look andCBS's Visitors from the Unknown, and the Randle/Schmitt book, this newcollection of Len Stringfield's crash/retrievals (Status Report VI), and finallythe Paragon hardcover book by me and Don Berliner, will soon bring forthmore of the live witnesses to what really has been happening, and will forcethe U. S. government to lift the lid on the biggest story of the millennium, theretrieval of crashed alien saucers, alien bodies, new technology and proof thatman is not alone. There is indeed a Cosmic Watergate. REFERENCES 1. Blum, Howard, Out There, Simon and Shuster, New York, 1990, 300 pg.

COMMENT"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Len Stringfield: \"Stanton Friedman, a true blue scientist, lets it be known that heseeks only bottom-line verifiable information from his sources - names of witnesses,place names, dates, old records - anything evidential that would convince ahard-nosed skeptic. If all the prerequisites are met, Stan will go to any length tofollow up and, justly, let the world know of his accomplishments. Namelessanecdotes go into the circular file. His guidelines are exemplary. Stan's rewards, although falling short of proof, are nonetheless, meaningful. His bigscoop was breaking the Jesse Marcel story which opened the floodgates to newsources to \"verify\" the Roswell crash. But, testimonial verification from one sourceor 300 is not enough. In the final analysis, testimony is not proof and, as I have saidmany times, it can only come from an official admission that our cumulativeinformation is basically true. Now, one last introspective thought about Roswell. In spite of the massive testimonyto support the incident, I cannot help but wonder about the turn of events if theMarcels or the Brazels or anyone had surreptitiously retained a scrap of substancefrom the debris field and offered it to a civilian research lab for analysis. A smokinggun - maybe the proof? As Stan and I both know, our methodologies differ. I, too, seek verification from mysources. If, for a good reason it is not accessible, my policy is that if my contacts cangive me a good gut feeling after they provide checkable references attesting to acreditable lifestyle, I will publish their material. Such is the case with Tim Cooperwho has shared the identities of his sources with me, but it was on a clear-cut basisthat they cannot be otherwise compromised. To go a step further, even in caseswhere my contacts such as Ron Madeley and Chuck Oldham - who did not share thenames of their sources - I, again, feel duty-bound, and privileged, to publish theirdisclosures. As I have said before, information of potential importance is useless if Ihide it in the back of my sock drawer. There is always the hope that my contact, orhis source, personally might make further disclosures; or better still, that newsources might surface with corroborative information.\" Continued in Part 13, Kecksburg, Pennsylvania crash of acorn-shaped craft.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
