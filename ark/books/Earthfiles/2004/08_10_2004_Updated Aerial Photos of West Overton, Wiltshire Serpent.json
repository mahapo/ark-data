The camera time was not morning.All agree the hour in which the tour and pilot became aware of the serpent pattern was between Noonand 1 p.m. Wiltshire, England time.

Peter has been returning to Wiltshire withtourists to explore crop formations since 1996. On July 29, 2004, during the sixthhelicopter trip, pilot Peter Vellacott thought he spotted a brand new formation in a WestOverton wheat field that he had not seen on his previous five flights. Peter Tadd's Swissgroup excitedly took photographs of what they thought was a \"miracle\" pattern that hadformed in twenty minutes while they were flying. By 1:30 p.m., all had flown and thegroup immediately headed for the West Overton S-shape, or \"serpent.\"Serpentine pattern in West Overton wheat field near Avebury, Wiltshire, was discoveredby farmer at 5 a.m. on July 29, 2004.

I would say the overall length of the serpent might have been 60 to 70feet. But the details - what they call the lay of the crop on the ground - was soextraordinary. Along this undulating serpent, the wheat had been laid in such a wayas to give almost a sense of like a diamond-back rattlesnake. As we walked along,the wheat was all laid in one direction on the two sides and there was this pattern inthe middle (of plants laid back and forth on each other). As we walked, we alsonoticed there were three small circles, one each in the wave-like pattern of theserpent. There was a young 15-year-old boy with me who has been somewhat questioningthe reality of these crop formations and how they are made. Then he looked at theperfect little circles and saw there was no entrance from outside. There was no waythe circles could have been created without disturbing the wheat around them - hewas convinced that this could not have been made by any person. At the very end of this formation, there was a tail that wrapped around itself in avery beautiful flowing way. Then, on either side of that tail were two small, sort ofteepees made of maybe a dozen stalks of wheat, twisted in just a perfect form. I hada sense of power of this being very delicate and very moving and needing to behonored, so that we could not walk back along the path of the formation. It wasgoing against the energy current and it was actually creating some discomfort for allof us to even attempt it. So, we went back along the tramlines which are the tractorpaths where no wheat grew.\" Peter Tadd also talked with Stuart Dike from Cropcircleconnector about the helicopterpilot's discovery of the pattern during the sixth flight at mid-day and Stuart wrote about iton the Connector. Word spread and on July 30, Bert Janssen from Holland called to tell meabout the sudden mid-day emergence of the West Overton serpent pattern. Farmer Found West Overton \"Serpent\" At 5 a.m., July 29,2004But Lucy Pringle also called me today to tell me that Alton Barnes crop circle researcherand businessman, Jonathan Sherwood, had not only talked to the farmer who said he sawthe serpent pattern at 5 a.m. that morning, but Jonathan had gone to the West Overton sitehimself at 11:30 a.m. and looked at the crop formation from the side of the road. Thus, the\"serpent\" was definitely in the wheat all morning of July 29, 2004, while the FastHelicopter tour flights were taking place.Jonathan told me today:\"Mike Harris (from Dartmoor), who was sitting over at Alton Barnes, rang me upand told me about it over the mobile. I said I was in Avebury and would just cutthrough West Kennett on the way back, so that's what I did. He came up this yearfrom Dartmoor just to drive around in his blue bus to look for patterns, like I do. Hesaid he was heading back to Alton Barnes to the car park at the top of the hill. So Isaid I would go past there and take a look and when I got there, I thought, 'Gee,that's tiny!' Had a quick look at it from the car. But I had an appointment to get to aswell, so I just stopped the car, got out and stood by the field, and planned to see itagain later in the day. SO, THE PILOT AND SWISS PASSENGERS ARE NOT CORRECT ABOUT THEFORMATION NOT BEING IN THE FIELD BEFORE THE NOON TO 1 P.M.TIME. Right, because I saw it myself at 11:30 a.m. But it would have been easy to missfrom the air. The pathway of the S-shape or 'serpent' would not have been verywide, no more than 3 feet wide if that. A real skinny thing. Later, around 6 p.m., Mike Harris, Tom and Kerry Blower and I returned to thefield. The farmer was very angry and throwing people out and went up the hill. So, Iwent up after him with Mike and I gave him my business card. The farmer said thepattern was there early in the morning at 5 a.m., that he had been throwing peopleout all day, and that he was going to get rid of it because he didn't want peoplemessing up the rest of his field. And he cut it out the next morning (July 30, 2004).\"Websites:http://www.cropcircleconnector.comhttp://home.clara.net/lucypringle"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"http://www.cropcircleresearch.comhttp://www.temporarytemples.co.ukhttp://www.bertjanssen.nlhttp://www.cccrn.ca/http://www.cropcirclenews.comhttp://www.dcca.nlhttp://www.invisiblecircle.dehttp://www.wylatowo.mogilno.pl/news.php?art=94http://www.bltresearch.com/http://thecropcirclewebsite.50megs.comhttp://www.swirlednews.comhttp://www.heramagazine.nethttp://members.iinet.net.au/~bwratten/ccc.htmlhttp://www.CropCircleAnswers.comhttp://www.busty-taylor.com/cropper/98busty2.htmhttp://www.cropcircleconnector.com/ilyes/ilyes.htmlhttp://ufo.internauci.plhttp://www.wylatowo.mogilno.plCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
