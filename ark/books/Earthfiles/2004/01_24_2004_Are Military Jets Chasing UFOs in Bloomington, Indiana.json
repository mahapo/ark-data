S. Army's Camp Attebury to the northeast. January 24, 2004 Bloomington, Indiana - John Tosti is 34-years-old, haslived in Bloomington, Indiana for the past twenty-seven years and at his currentBloomington address for the past decade. Over the years, he has seen severalstrange objects in the sky, but nothing as \"weird\" as what he and his family sawaround 8 p.m. on January 23, 2004, right from their backyard.Interview:John Tosti, Heating and Air Conditioning Contractor, Bloomington,Indiana: \"Around dinner time, there were a lot of lights in the sky that I noticedout the back door, looking east over the back yard, low in the sky. And around7:30 p.m., a couple of lights, really bright lights, appeared just over the tops ofthe trees in the backyard to the west. They were really bright. I thought theywere stars at first, but I seen one move just a little bit. I thought actually at firstit was the wind from the trees making it look like it moved. But as I noticed it,the light gently moved slowly to the south.So, I grabbed my flashlight, went back outside and started to flash it. I got aresponse. The object I was shining my flashlight at blinked out. It just totallydisappeared, so I knew it was not a star. Then I noticed the other bright lightstarted to move. It was in the west side of the sky and it started to move in anortheasterly fashion. And a long shaft of light, or tube it almost looked like atube it was multi-colored. It was green, red and white. The colors of the lightmoved back and forth. I don't know how to explain it better than that. It didn'tlook right. I've seen plenty of aircraft at night and I know what airplanes looklike, I know what helicopters are, what their light configurations are. This thingwas just like a long shaft of light, like a tube, and it started to move in the sky.It was really cold and I walked back inside the house. My friend, Mark, calledme and said he was seeing jet activity in my direction. While I talked to him, Inoticed there were more funny lights over the backyard. Didn't know what theywere, but they didn't look like any conventional aircraft that we have."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Aerial Object with Red and Yellow \"Tubes\"I went back outside and noticed this very strange object, very, very low, rightbehind the trees and it had three long tubes of yellow light with a really longtube of red light that was on top and made no noise. And I have never seenanything like it. I don't know what it was or what it was doing, but it was low,really close. I would say probably less than 1/8th of a mile away and really,really big. Really bright. My daughter noticed it. My wife noticed it after I hadhollered to them inside the house.Drawing by John Tosti right after he and his familywatched this strange aerial object around 8 p.m. in Bloomington, Indiana, on January 23,2004.The strange object was going south and then it made a turn west and as it turnedto the west, it kind of went behind the trees and disappeared. We couldn't see itbecause of the trees. Anyway, as it disappeared behind the tree, we noticed allthese jets just appeared. It was as if they just came to a certain spot right over thetop of our house. My daughter counted, I think it was actually fourteen jetsaltogether over the top of our house.WERE THESE JETS CIRCLING ONE AFTER THE OTHER? WHAT WASTHE TRAFFIC LIKE?It was almost as if they came from all directions, just like to the center of ourhouse. Some crossed each other and some were following like in formation. Itwas almost like they came from the east, the south, the north and the west, justin all directions, and they all intersected over the top of our house.AT THAT POINT, DID YOU TRY TO CALL AN AIRPORT OR POLICE ORSOMEONE TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING?No, I didn't. I elected not to call the police because we've done that before andthey've just called us 'freaks,' actually.We sat at the back window and we watched some of the lights in the backyard inthe west side of the sky and it seemed like it got really intense with aircraft.Then within five to fifteen minutes, it got really quiet. Nothing. And we didn'tnotice anything more after that and it was probably around 8:15 p.m. by thenthat everything cleared out. 8:15 to 8:30 p.m., it was just quiet. I don't know ifthey were military or who they were, but they were jets and a lot of them!WHAT IS THE NEAREST MILITARY AIRPORT TO BLOOMINGTON?That would be Attebury and Crane Naval Base. They both have airports. Cranesays they have an airport that's only large enough to accommodate things likeCessnas and things like that. But we've noticed a lot of military aircraft likeF-16s and Black Hawk helicopters lifting off from Crane Naval Base.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Request: If any Earthfiles.com viewer has any information about the source oridentification of the strange object over Bloomington, Indiana, on January 23,2004, please e-mail me: earthfiles@earthfiles.comCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
