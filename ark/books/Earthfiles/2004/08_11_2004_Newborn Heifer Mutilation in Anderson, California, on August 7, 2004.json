Further south in Red Bluff, the Jean andBill Barton ranch has experienced many cattle mutilations over the past decade. August 11, 2004 Anderson, California - Since the 1950s, unusual deaths that lawenforcement and ranchers have called \"animal mutilations\" have been reported around theworld. Both domestic animals and wild game have been affected, especially horses andcattle. Ranchers and law enforcement have long been puzzled because animals are foundwith the same pattern of hide and tissue removed - usually without blood - from the head,sexual organs, and rectum. There are no signs of struggle or tracks around the deadanimals, not even the animal's own tracks. That peculiar fact provoked law enforcement towonder if perpetrators came in and out of pastures using aerial craft.Many ranchers have also speculated that their mutilated animals have been cut with lasersbecause of the bloodless nature of the excisions. In fact, pathology exams over the yearshave confirmed in some mutilations that cuts were made with heat energy but not lasers aswe know them because no carbon residue has ben found on the cuts. I have shownpathology evidence of that in my books, An Alien Harvest and Glimpses of OtherRealities, Volume 1: Facts & Eyewitnesses.Biophysicist W. C. Levengood in Grass Lake, Michigan thinks a very complex set ofenergies are involved. He began studying soil and grass samples from mutilation sites tocompare with soil and grass from crop formations. In both phenomena, he has found thesame pattern of respiration changes in plant cell mitochondria, including grass collectednear the rectal area of a California bull found dead and mutilated on the Jean and BillBarton ranch in Red Bluff, California. Levengood called me in January 1997, to say thatblack particles found on the dead and mutilated bull were pure hemoglobin.Levengood said: \"To do this, you need to break down the cell membranes to theerythrocytes and leukocytes to remove the hemoglobin molecules. To do this, requires alaboratory procedure with very precise biochemical steps. It's totally incomprehensiblehow the hemoglobin could be removed in the middle of the night out in the middle of apasture and separated from all the other cellular components and some of it sprayed on thedead animal.\"Since 1997, half a dozen other animal mutilation cases in Canada and the United Statesalso have shown evidence of pure hemoglobin on the animals. This is strong evidence thatwhoever or Whatever kills and mutilates cattle, horses, goats, sheep, rabbits, cats, dogsand even wild animals such as deer and elk around the world is leaving a residue in somecases that requires advanced technology. I have talked to law enforcement, military andintelligence people on and off the record since 1979 when I first produced the televisiondocumentary, A Strange Harvest, about the animal mystery. Many of those investigatorshave confided that our government linked the phenomenon as far back as 1951, only 4"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"years after the infamous Roswell UFO crash, to \"extraterrestrial biological entities\"intruding on our planet.And the animal mutilations continue to this day. On Saturday, August 7, around 1 p.m.PST, rancher Harry Hawes received a call about a dead and mutilated female calf only twoor three days old. Harry is 72 and has been working his Anderson, California, ranch sincehe was discharged from the U. S. Army in 1957. Two years later he married his wife,Carole. When Harry saw the newborn with neat, bloodless excisions, he immediatelythought of the mutilated cow he had found five years earlier. His veterinarian tookphotographs of that cow and told Harry then he had no explanation for how the animal'sjaw flesh, eyeballs, udder, rectal and vaginal tissue had been so precisely and bloodlesslyremoved. Now his newborn heifer had suffered the same fate. Newborn female calf found dead and mutilated mid-day on Saturday, August 7, 2004,on the Harry and Carole Hawes ranch in Anderson, California.

Its eyeball was missing. Theleft side from the rib cage to the flank there was skin cut out and missing and all theinternal organs from the lungs heart and all the way down to the anus were missing. Theother ear on the underside was cut off about half way up, kind of a ragged cut that onewas. The tail was cut off at the base of the spine.Above : Left ear cleanly removed close to scalp; right ear cut in half; left eyeball cleanly removed.No blood, no tracks, no signs of struggle. Below: Large, bloodless excision of hide, muscleand all internal organs.

I noticed some flies had laid some eggs on thetip of the tongue and they were already hatching. So, that's why after we took photos webrought it up and put it in the cool room to stop that because I wanted to show it to myveterinary friend. He came over that evening and I showed it to him.WHAT DID HE SAY?I thought maybe he was going to open up the rib cage, but he said it was not necessary. Hesaid no animal could get in there that far and clean out those organs up in the rib cage thatway. The piece of hide where the abdomen was cut open usually when animals cut it open,there is a flap of skin. In other words, they tear it open. A lot of animals tear it off in thesame place, but this was cut from the flank to the rib cage and that piece of skin wascompletely missing. It was an oval cut. They started at the top and cut all the way aroundup to the ribs and down as far as the belly button and back up to the flank. Made sort of afootball-shaped cut. They cut all the way into the abdomen in one big cut, it looked like,because the hide, the skin and the flesh on that particular part was all gone.DID THE VETERINARIAN MAKE ANY COMMENT ABOUT WHETHER THEORGANS THEMSELVES HAD BEEN REMOVED WITH SURGICAL CUTS?Not really. He just looked in there and said there is no animal that would do that. And theycut the tail off.RIGHT AT THE END OF THE TAILBONE?Right.DID IT LOOK GLASSY WHERE IT HAD BEEN CUT THROUGH THE TAILBONE?I didn't notice that so much. It was kind of dark (in color). It had been laying in the sun forabout 5 or 6 hours. I don't know if you'd call it glassy or not, but there was no blood on theground.Yellow arrow points at excision of tail in neat cut through tail bone from newborn heifer.DID HE MAKE ANY COMMENT ABOUT HOW THE TAIL COULD HAVE BEENREMOVED FROM THE BASE OF THE SPINE?No, he didn't say anything.HOW DO YOU CUT THROUGH TAIL BONE?Very easily. You can cut it with any pocket knife or something like that. Cows have about"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"100 some odd vertebrae that you can easily cut through.

Veterinarians, Brand Inspectors and Law Enforcement\"Spooked\" by Animal MutilationsDID HE MAKE ANY PRIVATE SPECULATION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THECALF?The vet? He's a friend of mine it spooks him out!IT DOES SPOOK HIM OUT?Sure.MANY VETERINARIANS HAVE TOLD ME OFF THE RECORD THAT THE ANIMALMUTILATIONS THEY HAVE INVESTIGATED ARE THE STRANGEST AND MOSTINEXPLICABLE THING THEY'VE EVER SEEN.I would imagine that's close to what these guys say. Everyone like brand inspectors andlaw enforcement who has seen one of these things get spooked like the other one I hadabout 5 or 6 years ago. The vet took the photos on that one.The thing that really is weird is that there isn't any blood on the ground like animals woulddo. Maybe it wasn't even killed right there. You don't know. here it is laying in the grassand there is no blood around it. That's the first thing that usually happens when an animalkills a cow. That's how we find out whether it died or if it was killed (by an attackingpredator). If there is blood on the ground, it was killed (by a predator). If there is no bloodaround the animal, it just died a natural death.IF THAT CALF WAS TAKEN AWAY, WHO TOOK IT? HOW DID THEY TAKE IT?HOW DID THEY RETURN IT? AND WHY DID THEY RETURN IT?That's right. That is a big question. It's creepy sounding, but there's no use worrying aboutit. If Whoever did this are that advanced, you haven't got a chance anyway, so why worryabout it?Two to three-day-old female calf found dead and mutilated August 7, 2004,on the Harry and Carole Hawes ranch in Anderson, California.Denial As A Coping MechanismYou can take brand inspectors and all those fellas and you can take them out and showthem this thing. Or you can show some of your friends these pictures and they'll say, 'Oh,hell, that was done with animals.'I've been around animals all my life, especially predators, and never seen anything like themutilations in my life before. But people will turn right around and argue predator. Thething is, they don't want to believe it's something else. There was one brand inspector whotold me, 'Hell, it was coyotes. You know that!' I said, 'If that makes you feel secure.' That'swhat they do. They come up with an answer that is logical to them because nothing else isand that's what they glom onto and will tell everyone else that and it makes them feelbetter. They can walk around in the dark and they're OK. But if they had to come up witha spooky deal like you're talking about (extraterrestrial interference) it drives them up thewall!"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"RIGHT, SO IT'S DENIAL. Mutilated Bull's Horn Rammed Deeply Into The GroundSure, it's a form of denial. There is no question about it. When you have an animal thatfalls on the ground and it's horn is rammed into the ground so hard it takes two deputies topull it out something is wrong there. That wasn't a predator that caused that. That animalcould not thrash that hard on hard ground. That was one of Jean Barton's animals, rancherin Red Bluff, California. See More Information below.Then inspectors still turn around and say, 'Well, it was predators.'BUT THAT MEANS FOR THE HORN TO HAVE BEEN EMBEDDED INTO THEGROUND, IT HAD TO HAVE BEEN DROPPED FROM ABOVE?Either dropped or somebody grabbed it by the hind legs and flipped it around so hard thatit hit the ground like a crowbar or a pick. Things like that are highly unusual and there isno way in hell that you could possibly do that without dropping it. And yet other peoplewill turn around and blank face tell you, 'It was predators,' you know? I think it is a form ofdenial. 1999 Mutilated Cow On Hawes RanchThere are several people who saw that other animal I had. The cow was the most dramatic.NIDS (National Institute for Discovery Science) said it was one of the best cases they hadseen. It was not decomposed. On that cow, the eyeballs were gone and they cut the tongueoff deep inside (the throat). They cut the lips off. The belly button was missing. The udderwas completely removed.IT WAS A NEAT HIDE-DEEP EXCISION?Everything was really neat on that cow. Everything was cut very surgical and very precise.Then the anus it didn't take the reproductive organs but it took the anus out completely.Just cored it right out.NO BLOOD, NO TRACKS?Oh, no.\"Above: Mutilated cow discovered in 1999 on the Harry and Carole Hawes ranch in Anderson, California.Both eyeballs, jaw tissue and entire tongue removed precisely and without blood or signs of struggle. Below:Cow's entire udder removed as if with a \"cookie cutter\" removal only hide-deep, leaving the whitetissue covering abdominal muscles.
