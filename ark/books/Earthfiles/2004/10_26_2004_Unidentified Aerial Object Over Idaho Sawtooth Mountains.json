October 26, 2004 Boise, Idaho - This week I received the following e-mail with theabove photo. \"October 24, 2004Hi, Linda,My husband and I moved from Bel Air, Maryland to Boise, Idaho two years ago.Our daughter lured us with her love of the wilderness here in Idaho. Whilebackpacking in the Sawtooths, she took this (photo) in September. Of course, shewas not nearly as interested in this shot as I was. ... In the past, I have helped NancyTalbott and Dr. Levengood by sending in samples from a local crop formation inStreet, Maryland and also sent in a photo of an ice circle found in Churchville,Maryland which no one wanted to talk about!!! None of the other photos have this on them and she (daughter) has the negative. Iam very interested in images captured in ordinary photographs. L. W., Boise, Idaho\" If any Earthfiles viewer has any information about what this aerial object might be, pleasee-mail me at earthfiles@earthfiles.com.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expressly"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"prohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
