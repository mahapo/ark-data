See 09-06-03 Earthfiles. September 4, 2004 Cincinnati, Ohio - So far in 2004, there have been 17 cropformations reported in the United States beginning on May 26th with a 7-fold (wagonwheel) geometric wheat pattern in Peach Orchard, Arkansas (See 06-02-04 Earthfiles);followed on June 17, by another large geometric pattern near Cordelia, California in SolanoCounty, also in wheat (See 07-02-04 Earthfiles).Then twelve days later on June 29, in a Spanish Fork, Utah, barley field, came a ring withappendages that changed over time and was associated with mysterious lights. See07-06-04 Earthfiles.More barley was affected on Independence Day, July 4, when plants were laid downseemingly randomly in a Litchfield, Meeker County, Minnesota, field except there were atleast four layers of 90-degree angles in several places. See 07-26-04 Earthfiles. The daybefore, on July 3 in Eagle Grove, Iowa, a dozen random patterns of downed oat plantswere reported. See 07-06-04 Earthfiles.Then, on July 5th, in Hillsboro, OHIO, residents who requested anonymity - sent an e-mailto Jeffrey Wilson, Director of the Independent Crop Circle Researchers Association(ICCRA), along with a photograph of a rectangular section of corn that had been laid downwith stems all going in one direction. The e-mail said in part: \"We have what most wouldrefer to as a 'crop circle' in our garden plot of corn. We have contacted the local sheriff'sdepartment and he said it did not look like vandalism to him, but rather some type ofnatural or unexplained phenomena.\" See 07-15-04 Earthfiles.After Hillsboro, crop patterns were reported in Chuckey, Tennessee grass on July 11; NewMilford, Connecticut corn on July 14 See 07-15-04 Earthfiles.; Tilden, Wisconsin oats onJuly 19 See 07-26-04 Earthfiles.; Cottage Grove, Minnesota wheat on July 24; Spring Hill,Tennessee corn on Aug. 6; Charles City, Iowa grass on Aug. 8; West Union, AdamsCounty, Ohio soybeans on Aug. 16, which some say is a hoax, but biophysicist W. C.Levengood found soil anomalies similar to Hillsboro, Ohio corn pattern."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Above: West Union, Ohio, soybean field imprinted with a pattern of downed crop reported on August 16,2004.Aerial photograph © 2004 by Jeffrey Wilson, ICCRA.

In Wausau, six circles appeared in a barleyfield around August 19-20, 2004 the same time that several people reported UFOs andunexplained power outages from Minneapolis to Antigo. Farmer Scott Worden toldWausau's Channel 9 WAOW-TV, \"Never seen nothing like this in the field, You can seethey're all in a counter-clockwise motion the way the grain is wrapped. Something camedown on the field, ya know, and it was turning in a counter-clockwise motion.\" Two of thecircles were about 20 feet in diameter and the other four were smaller sizes.On September 1, 2004, a farmer in Miamisburg, Ohio, reported an amazing pattern in his8-foot-high corn, which Jeffrey Wilson and his ICCRA research team have investigatedthis week. Jeff said, \"It is by far the most impressive lay of any corn circle formation thatI've ever been to - not just from the sheer size of it, but the way the corn is laid down incurves.\" See 09-03-04 Earthfiles.

Photograph © 2004 by ICCRA.In Hillsboro, Jeff and his ICCRA team found anomalies in the plants, soil, magnetic fieldmeasurements, higher radioactivity and other tests. Recently I talked with him about theextensive anomalies they confirmed in the Hillsboro corn and one unusual anomaly in theLawton, Michigan corn. First, the Lawton case:Jeffrey Wilson, Director, Independent Crop Circle Researchers Association(ICCRA), Cincinnati, Ohio: \"There were quite a number of plants that they found avertical rupture on some of the growth nodes. All of those were on the side of the plantsthat were facing the ground. But they are different than what has been seen in the past asexpulsion cavities. This is something different and we're not sure because it hasn't beenreported by anyone before about exactly what we're looking at.SO, THIS IS AT LEAST AN UNEXPLAINED ANOMALY AT THIS POINT?Ye s .WHAT WAS THE CONSENSUS OF SUGDEN, LIETZAU AND ROBERTSON BASEDON THEIR PAST EXPERIENCES OF HAVING BEEN THERE WHAT WAS THEIRSENSE OF THIS CORN PATTERN IN RELATIONSHIP TO THOSE THAT HAVE BEENMANMADE VERSUS THOSE THAT SEEM TO BE AUTHENTICALLY STRANGE?They really came to the conclusion that it was inconclusive. But just the more they looked,the more they found no evidence one way or the other.Although both Ted and Roger both describe the way that it looked as being very similar toHillsboro the two were very closely similar. High Physical Strangeness in Hillsboro, Ohio CornMysteriously downed corn plants in Hillsboro, Ohio garden, discoveredon July 5, 2004. Hillsboro is near the ancient Hopewell earth mounds. In 2003,the ancient mounds were the site of complex crop formations in soybeans.Photograph © 2004 by owners who request anonymity.It turns out that the Hillsboro corn has the largest number of scientifically documentedanomalies of any crop formation this year in the United States. In as many of these cases aspossible, Jeffrey Wilson and his volunteer colleagues in their Independent Crop CircleResearchers Association, try to investigate the plants, soil, magnetic fields, radioactivityand other physical evidence that can be studied by scientists.LET'S GO TO HILLSBORO BECAUSE I HAVE TALKED WITH W. C. LEVENGOODAND RECEIVED PHOTOGRAPHS FROM HIM ABOUT THE MAGNETIC PARTICLEANALYSIS IN HILLSBORO. IN THE PHOTOGRAPHS, THERE IS A CENTRAL COREOF NON-MAGNETIC HEMATITE WHICH IS AN ORANGISH-RED SURROUNDEDBY A CRUST OF MAGNETITE. HE'S NEVER SEEN IT QUITE LIKE THAT BEFORE"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"AND I KNOW YOU WENT TO THE LAB TO LOOK AT THOSE PARTICLES.Yes, this is something that has not been seen or reported before in any other formations.We started to check some of the soil literature to see if anybody that is a soil scientist hadreally studied it, but we haven't come across anyone who has reported anything like thateither.So, this is some discovery of something new that people haven't seen before. What isamazing to certainly Levengood, who seems to be very impressed by it, is that there is thisfusion of magnetite right to the hematite core. To be able to do that both magnetite andhematite are different varieties of iron and iron melts at a pretty high rate higher than youroven does. So, there had to have been some high heat at some point to have this processaffected that way. Why there seems to be a silica shell, however tenuous it is on theoutside of this. How that can be fused to the two irons as well is a mystery without settingthe crop field on fire or something.IT'S SILICA AND MAGNETITE IN THE CRUST AROUND THE NON-MAGNETICHEMATITE.Yes, which is why I said when they pulled the magnetic particles out of the soil throughthat process of suspending the soil sample in a solution and then running a magnet throughit to collect all those magnetic particles, that's why this non-metallic hematite with thesilica was in with all the magnetic particles because the magnetite was fused to it.AND THAT'S THE PUZZLE HOW DID IT BECOME FUSED WITHOUT HIGHTEMPERATURE AND WHAT WOULD BE THE MECHANISM TO HAVE PRODUCEDTHESE KINDS OF PARTICLES?And the reason why it's so unusual is Levengood has looked at a couple hundred cropcircle formations and he's done many, many of the same soil tests and this is the first timethis has ever come out in the solution. So, this is something new he's never seen before andthat's an important diagnostic criteria to look at.\" Biophysicist W. C. Levengood's Discoveriesin Hillsboro Corn and West Union Soybean Formation SoilsW. C. Levengood, Biophysicist, Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory, Grass Lake,Michigan: \"Those crop formations where I've been able to obtain soil samples probablynumber around 100 now around the world. In about 99% of the cases, these were veryspherical, tiny and ranging from 5 microns up to 100 microns, about 1/10th of a millimeteror a little bigger. They have always been shiny black particles and those few EDS (EnergyDispersive Spectroscopy) that I've had people do for me show that they are pure magnetite.Those in themselves are anomalous for several reasons. First of all, they probably did notcome from the far reaches of outer space, but they were transformed into pure magnetitewith no nickel whatsoever. Ordinarily the iron meteorites that we know about always havea percentage of nickel. These have none. So, this indicates the model and John Burke and Ipublished in the Journal of Scientific Exploration to describe the process of formation forthese magnetite particles are probably correct. (A spinning plasma vortex with microwaveand other energy components that comes down from high in the atmosphere throughiron-rich meteoritic dust that is sprayed on plants and soil in crop formations.) The nickelmight have been separated out by the ion plasma vortex.What I found in the Hillsboro formation are hematite silica particles many of them brokenopen, which in itself is extremely unusual. I don't think I've ever seen a magnetite particlebroken open. Instead of pure magnetite, they were filled with mostly very fine particles ofhematite that's one of the non-magnetic forms of iron. The common term for it is ordinaryrust, oxidized iron. But it was very uniform, except for very tiny 1-2 micron range shinyblack beads of magnetite.Left: Reddish non-magnetic hematite core of broken open \"egg-like\" particle."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Right: Unbroken egg-like particle with silica dioxide and magnetite crust.100X photomicrograph © 2004 by W. C. Levengood.This is a typical split sphere, but this is a whole new dimension of anomalies here. Thething that makes it so anomalous is that each of these split-open-spheres (and some that arenot split) are filled with hematite (red-orange), the non-magnetic form of iron oxide. I'venever seen this before.This is 100 x magnification and you can see the graininess in the hematite. That's the redmaterial and that half particle right in the middle. It's not pure hematite. There's also somemagnetite mixed in or I wouldn't have been able to pick it up with a magnet.WHAT ABOUT THE SURROUNDING GRAINS?There is one to the immediate right that's not broken open, but it's out of focus. At thismagnification, it's very difficult to keep everything in focus. So on the immediate left is agrain, but it shows the part that IS in focus which is the edge. It shows a coating which Iwill discuss in a little bit more detail in a minute.SO, THE DOMINANT THING IS THAT WE HAVE A BROKEN PIECE THAT IS THERED PART IN THE CENTER AND THAT IS THE HEMATITE WITH A LITTLEMAGNETITE AND TO THE RIGHT IS ONE OF WHAT YOU CALL A KIND OF EGGIN WHICH IT'S NOT BROKEN. IT HAS HEMATITE IN THE CENTER AND ISSURROUNDED BY A CRUST OF MAGNETITE AND SILICA.Yes, and in the photomicrograph below, I've gone from high magnification to low and youcan see the same two particles amid others. You can see the red hematite sort inside a verythin shell. I call this the 'egg shell' effect because the hematite is inside sand grains (SiO2silica dioxide) that are fused with magnetite. That's why the particles can be picked up in amagnet drag at the crop formation.Wider view of the broken open hematite, magnetite and silica \"egg.\" Filament is piece of cotton thread.40X photomicrograph © 2004 by W.

C. Levengood.In the photomicrograph above, you can clearly see that egg shell effect. In the middle, isthe red hematite spilled out of the 'egg,' and just above that you can see the whitish eggshell reflecting quartz grains.THE QUARTZ IS THE SILICA.Yes, silica dioxide, SiO2."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE?I've never seen that before. In other crop formation investigations, we have found manytiny spherical particles of pure magnetite in the soil, but not these egg-like combinationscontaining the two types of iron.ANY GEOLOGICAL LITERATURE ABOUT THIS?No. I've looked.DO YOU HAVE ANY HYPOTHESIS ABOUT HOW THIS WAS CREATED?No, because you see it couldn't have been created after the things fell to Earth, because it'sso uniform. There are no stains in the soil, which there would be ordinarily. In other words,how ever this was formed, it formed before the particles reached the surface (of the Earth).FALLING DOWN THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE.That's correct.COMPARED TO THE AMOUNT OF MAGNETITE YOU HAVE FOUND IN SOILS INISRAEL, ENGLAND AND THE UNITED STATES INSIDE OF CROP FORMATIONS,WHAT IS THE CONCENTRATION IN THIS HILLSBORO PATTERN?It's interesting with the magnetic drag, I either find a significant amount and by that I meanan amount quite well above the upper limit for ordinary soil which is 0.4 milligrams pergram of soil. These ran around 6 to 5 to 2 in other words, roughly over 10 times the upperlimit for normal soil. That, however, is not nearly as high as I've found before (as much as750 times concentration), but it's enough to keep you going particularly when you find thatthe controls which were taken some distance from the Hillsboro pattern they were down tothe normal level around .4 milligrams of magnetite in each gram of soil, or less.Shiny magnetite particle embedded in Hillsboro, Ohio, corn formation soil gathered at the siteby the ICCRA research team for analysis by biophysicist W. C. Levengood.100X photomicrograph © 2004 by W. C. Levengood.In the photomicrograph above, there's a small magnetite particle. Its shiny appearance isembedded right in the grain. This is typical of what we are finding in most crop formationswhere there are any magnetic particles at all except in this case of Hillsboro, Ohio, thehematite seems to dominate and there is much less magnetite.Wider view of very tiny magnetite particles in the Hillsboro, Ohio, corn formation soil.40X photomicrograph © 2004 by W.

Levengood."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE SOIL SAMPLES CAME FROM IN WHATSEEMED RANDOMLY DOWNED CORN, DID YOU FIND ANY UNUSUAL PATTERNIN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE SMALL PARTICLES THAT HAD BOTH HEMATITEAND MAGNETITE IN THEM?Not really. No, you see the circular motion, the rotational motion, angular velocity of theseplasma vortices, are such that for the magnetic material that is caught up in them, they justthrow if all over the place. The only pattern I've ever found is in distance from theformation, as if centrifugal force were involved.Another example of a hematite, magnetite and silica \"egg\" particle in the Hillsboro, Ohio,corn formation soil. 40X photomicrograph © 2004 by W. C. Levengood.This was such a new discovery and so amazing. This again is a hematite sphere, or 'egg'that has broken open In this one, there are little magnetite grains, shiny black particles, inthe right side of the red hematite. It's all mixed in together and this also shows the white'egg shell' effect very nicely. This has a little thicker shell than some of the others. Theyaren't all exactly uniform.One of several tiny holes found in the middle of the \"eggs.\"40X photomicrograph © 2004 by W. C. Levengood.This is again a large irregular particle covered with the magnetite. You can see it stuck tothe sand grains. What that hole is in the middle, I don't know. This might have beenescaped gas or might have been punched in there. It's hard to say.WHAT IS THE ARGUMENT FOR PEOPLE WHO SAY THIS IS JUST SOME NATURALPHENOMENON IN THE SOIL?Because about two years ago, there were two papers in Nature and both of them hadmicrometeorite particles, spherical particles, on the cover. One thing that was emphasizedin both of those papers was how rare these particles are. These were found down at thebottom of a well in Antarctica about 80 feet underground. I don't know exactly how theyfound the particles, but in the well they found these 20 or 30 magnetite particles. My God,in crop formations, I find that many in one magnetic drag, or more hundreds! In the normalsoil, they are very rare.STATISTICALLY, YOU HAVE FOUND SO MUCH MORE OF THIS MAGNETITE ANDHEMATITE INSIDE OF CROP FORMATIONS THAN SHOULD BE IN NORMAL SOIL?Hundreds of times more, yeah.AND HERE WE HAVE IT IN HILLSBORO, OHIO, IN WHAT TO THE EYE WOULDAPPEAR TO BE RANDOMLY DOWNED CORN.This was hit by the energies."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"RIGHT, BUT IT FALLS INTO THAT CATEGORY YOU STUDIED IN BLUE BALL,MARYLAND, IN CROPS IN WHICH THERE IS NO GEOMETRIC PATTERN.Right, a randomly downed pattern.\" Hematite, Magnetite, Silica Dioxide \"Eggs\" AlsoFound in West Union, Ohio Soybean FormationWest Union, Ohio, soybean field imprinted with a pattern of downedcrop reported on August 16, 2004.
