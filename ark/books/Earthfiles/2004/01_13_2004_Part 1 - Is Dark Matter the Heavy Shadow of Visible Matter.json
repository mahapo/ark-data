January 13, 2004 Ann Arbor, Michigan - In February 2001, the BrookhavenNational Laboratory in Upton, Long Island, New York, announced thatphysicists there had made a new measurement of what is called, \"the muonanomalous magnetic moment.\" The number looks like this:From \"Theory of the Muon Anomalous Magnetic Moment\" by Andrzej Czarnecki,September 2002 Seventh International Workshop on Tau Lepton Physics, Santa Cruz,California.The problem was that this more refined calculation exceeded the theoreticalprediction of what the muon's magnetic attraction should be by about 2.6standard deviations. Or more simply, if the Standard Model (see MoreInformation below) of atomic physics is correct, the muon's anomalous magneticmoment should be a different number.Since 2001, theoretical physicists have argued about whether the Brookhavenmuon measurement is correct or not. If it is, then Something Else in the universeis not being counted in the calculations. Some physicists such as Gordon Kane,Ph.D., Theoretical Particle Physicist and Particle Cosmologist at the Universityof Michigan's Randall Physics Laboratory in Ann Arbor, argue that theSomething Else is Dark Matter, the \"shadow universe\" that does not give offlight, remains invisible to our eyes, but can be detected by instruments that can"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"measure magnetic strengths of atomic particles down to an accuracy of one partin 100 billion.Dark Matter, he thinks, is an intimate and more massive partner with our visiblematter universe, made of heavy particles that are unstable and decay into otherparticles. The Dark Matter \"super partner particles\" could be five to ten timesmore massive than our visible matter protons. If this hypothesis is true, that\"heavier shadow\" would make up more of the universe. That might explain why23% of the universe is unseen Dark Matter, 73% is mysterious Dark Energy andonly 4% is visible matter.Dark Matter Distribution in the UniverseAn international team of astronomers based in France has obtained the first-everglimpse of the distribution of dark matter over a large section of sky. The teamused images from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope's high-resolutionwide-field imaging camera to analyze the light of 200,000 distant galaxies,looking for distortions caused by intervening dark matter. The results givecosmologists their first clear window into the possible roles of dark matter in theevolution of the Universe.Deflection of light rays crossing the universe, emitted by distant galaxies.The box shown spans a distance of about one billion light-years. The structures aredisplayedso that the brighter regions have a higher density (that is, more dark matter) than the darkerregions.The dark matter is concentrated into a web-like distribution of filaments that intersect atdense nodeswhere great clusters of galaxies are expected to form and become visible. This numericalsimulation was made available by S. Colombi of the IAP.At the rear of the cube (to the left), three blue disks represent three distantgalaxies. The yellow lines that cross the box represent light rays from thosegalaxies propagating through the universe. In the absence of interveningmatter, the light would travel on straight lines but in the presence ofmatter, the paths of the rays are evidently deflected by the gravitationaleffects of the clumpy matter (the breaks in the yellow lines illustrate thelight passing behind a clump of dark matter). The light from a distant galaxy rarely encounters a clump of mass tostrongly bend the light and cause an easily seen distortion. Instead theindividual light rays suffer a series of small deflections such that anobserver located at the front of the box (to the right), sees that the imagesof all the galaxies in some small patch of the sky, near to one of our testgalaxies say, are all very slightly elongated in a common directiondetermined by the distribution of dark matter along that particular line ofsight. This gravitational distortion is expected to be very small and requiresa careful statistical treatment on many patches over the sky."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" This view shows what the observer at the front of the box would perceive whenlooking at galaxiesin the sky. The blue elongated disks are the images of distant galaxies formed bytheir light after it has passedthrough the box.This numerical simulation was kindly made available by S. Colombiof the IAP. The observer can see these galaxies but the filaments of dark matter, shownhere in red and white, are invisible, even to the largest telescopes availableto our observer. However, one can see that the galaxy images are elongatedin a special way on average: they are stretched along a direction parallel tothe filaments of dark matter. This effect is a consequence of gravitationallensing which stretches the tight bundle of light rays from a single galaxymuch like the moon's gravity stretches the Earth to cause the ocean tides.By measuring the systematic distortion in the images of distant galaxies,one can \"see\" the dark matter. The ultimate goal of the French team is tomap the dark matter with the new CFHT instrument MegaCam, as one ofthe special survey programs now being planned. Interview:Gordon Kane, Ph.D., Theoretical Particle Physicist and ParticleCosmologist at the University of Michigan's Randall Physics Laboratory inAnn Arbor, Michigan: \"What the experimenters find is what they observe is alittle bit stronger magnet (in the muon) than what the prediction says. So, it is asignal that there is an affect of some physics that is not included in the StandardModel.THAT COULD BE CAUSED BY THE SHADOW UNIVERSE?Shadow universe, yes, of dark matter. So the connection is the following - it'sbeen known for some time that an extension of the Standard Model called'Supersymmetry' does affect the magnetic strength of subatomic particles.If Supersymmetry is right as a description of Nature, then another set of particlesdoes have to exist like the particles we know such as electrons, and muons andphotons and gluons that hold together quarks, and protons. There has to be awhole other set of particles. Each of the particles we know has to have a partner.Historically, that's not such an odd thing. For example, Dirac 70 some years agopredicted that every particle had an anti-particle and that came out to be true,even though at the time it was thought to be a far out idea. This is in some waysa similar idea: every particle has a partner and what we're seeing is the affect ofthese partners on the magnetic strength. The Shadow Universe of Dark MatterIn Supersymmetry, the expected 'super partners' (to all known subatomicparticles) would exist and most of them would be heavy particles and areunstable and decay into other particles. A few are stable. But the lightest of thenew 'super partner' particles - we don't know exactly its nature yet but it's calledthe 'lightest super partner' in the literature. That lightest super partner should bea stable particle which was created at the Big Bang, just like all the otherparticles were created at the Big Bang and have persisted in the universe until"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"now.The electrons and quarks in us were also created at the Big Bang. All theparticles that make us up are ones left over from the Big Bang and this new setof particles, the lightest super partner, would be added to the set that are alreadyaround. It has, in fact, just the right properties to make up what is called the'dark matter' that makes up 23% of the universe. It is called 'dark' because youdon't actually see it in the sense that we see planets and stars. But instead, youinfer its existence because of its gravitational impact on other things. So, itmakes the motion of planets and galaxies or solar systems and galaxies differentfrom what they would be otherwise. You can measure that and you can inferthere must be some matter there, but you don't see it with light. You see itinstead by its gravitational affects. Visible universe of galaxies, stars and planets makes up only 4% of the known universe.Dark Matter that is invisible makes up 23% of the universe. Images courtesyCenter for Particle Astrophysics, University of California-Berkeley. Only 4% of Universe Is Made of Visible ParticlesSuppose the 4% is made up of a bunch of particles, namely protons andneutrons and electrons. They have some weight, those particles. OK? Thensuppose there are the same number of particles in Dark Matter as thoseapproximately. So, that would be the most naive assumption you could make that since they are super partners, for every regular particle, there is a DarkMatter particle crudely speaking. Then if the Dark Matter particles tended tohave 5 to 10 times the mass of the proton, instead of 4%, they would be 40%.SO, THE SHADOW UNIVERSE WOULD BE DENSER OR HEAVIER?The particles in it are just heavier by 5 to 10 times and some of those superpartners are the ones that are thought to explain this extra magnetic strength inthe muons that indicates something else is going on. So that is the chain ofreasoning.THE IMPLICATION IS THAT THE DARK MATTER MYSTERY COULD BEEXPLAINED AS HEAVIER PARTNERS TO EVERY PARTICLE THAT WEKNOW IN THE UNIVERSE?That's right. It's just that we haven't had enough energy and machines yet tomake them. But, right now the Tevatron Collider is looking for the hypothesizedheavy particles at the Fermi Lab outside Chicago. And around 2007 to 2008, thelarge collider being built at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, will be turned on.Those machines do have the energy to make these super particles. The Tevatronhas the energy to make them, but might make too few of them to detect. Thelarge collider at CERN might make many of them because it's much moreintense. So, then we should see this world of super partners completelyexplicitly, just as much as we see top quarks and double bosons and such things.They should no longer be hidden from us at that point. They will be completelyexplicit and we'll have lots of fun talking about them. But all of them areunstable. They have lifetimes that are only a tiny fraction of a second, except thelightest one. And that's the one that hangs around in the universe forever, oralmost forever.Finally, the implication is that there is a new physics beyond the StandardModel and that the best candidate to explain everything is the Supersymmetry"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"idea.\"More Information:Standard Model Theory of Atomic Physics:Attempts to describe all matter and forces in the universe (except gravity).
