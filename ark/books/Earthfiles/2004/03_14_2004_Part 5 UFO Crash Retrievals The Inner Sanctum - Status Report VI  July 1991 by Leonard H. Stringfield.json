Len Stringfield - continued: THE BLUE ROOM Now, we take another step into the \"breached\" Inner Sanctum's wall. For this report, werecapture the experience of one person with the right access clearance to a \"Blue Room.\"Its location is secret. The room was a veritable museum holding the artifacts of crashedsaucers and the retrieved cadavers from Roswell. My cooperative, but cautious,intermediary is a retired Army officer of high rank who got the information firsthand froman equally cautious source. I have edited the following report, as requested, to conceal theidentification of both my friend and his source. Retired U. S. Army Officer: \"I will describe this to you as it was told to me. Mysource sometime ago related an incident to me that leads me to question the 'official'government position on their research into UFO/IAC activity. In 1955, as a scientific research analyst, he was working in Texas upgrading severalradar installations. His main duties included the supervision of upgrades and fieldtesting of new equipment. He had from time to time been called in to investigate'bogies' encountered by various groups. This apparently led to the following incident. One evening during dinner, an MP (military police) pulled into the drive andinformed him that he had to go with him. This was not an unusual event and hethought nothing of it at the time. As was typical, he was not allowed to pack or washe informed of his destination or the duration of the 'trip.' He was taken to a localAFB and there held in a secure area with others involved in various fields oftechnical research. Many of these individuals were known to him and numbered inthe mid-twenties. The first order of business was the signing Secrecy Non-Disclosure papers. Again,none of this was out of the ordinary as he had been involved in compartment-tintedmissions since his day sin the Navy. They were told that the purpose of the missionwould be discussed only when they arrived on site and there was to be no discussion,even among themselves, until so ordered. This is when the tone of the situationchanged. Their pockets were emptied into marked envelopes and they were frisked.They were then led to an aircraft and seated along with armed military guards. Mysource related to me that he did not recognize the insignia on their uniforms and itconsisted of numbers only. None of the guards had ID labels on their blouses andnone of them spoke to the passengers for the duration of the flight. Just before landing, they were each given a black hood and told that removing thembefore told to do so would result in 'never being seen again.' When asked if he waskidding, the Colonel in charge merely said, 'Try me.' After the plane landed, theywere told to don their hoods and place their hands on the shoulders of the man infront of them. (He could only guess at the flight time because their watches wereconfiscated before departure, but felt that it might have been about four hours. Thenagain, he said they might have just flown around in circles for some time.) As they de-planed, he could see the ground by tilting his head down. He noticed that"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"as they left the runway, the area was 'sandy' and the air felt like the coolness of adesert evening. The shadows he could see on the ground led him to believe that itwas indeed night (further accenting his sense of elapsed time), as there were shadowsapparently cast by artificial lighting. As they were led, he tells that two of the menhad evidently raised their hoods and were told, 'You shouldn't have done that.' Heheard what he thought were handcuffs being ratcheted and the men led away. (Twoanalysts that he had worked with who had been at the airport were indeed never seenagain and their families moved away before they returned home. Any questionsregarding their whereabouts were answered with, 'You want the same thing?'). After a short walk, they encountered concrete and as they stopped, he heard ahangar door brought down behind them. After a muffled discussion between twodisembodied voices (one quite angry, after being told 'there were two violations' andthat 'no, they wouldn't be included or questioned.') they were told to remove theirhoods. At this point, my source's voice always quivered when he tells the story (hehas told it to me on five occasions without change and so far as I know, he hasrelated it to no one else.) When they removed their hoods, they were inside a converted aircraft hangar inwhich floor and walls were entirely painted blue. Around the room were tables,shelves and fixtures holding thousands of artifacts, none of which were immediatelyrecognizable. They were told that they were to study each object and determine itspurpose, operating parameters, and whether or not it could be duplicated. Lookingback, he now recognizes many things such as lasers, integrated circuits, printedcircuit boards of now commonplace design (including microprocessors and surfacemount components). They were on site for approximately four days, took their meals and sleep there.They were allowed to ask any questions necessary to complete their task, and the'curator' (as he described himself) was pleased when one of them finally asked wherethe artifacts came from. They were led to a small locked room that they hadheretofore not seen, and were shown four large aquariums filled with a pink solution,each containing a small body of gray skin, oversized cranium, huge eyes, no hair. Inthe back of this room were pieces of metal, ranging from slivers to very large twistedchunks. The curator then related the story of the Roswell crash. When they had been debriefed days later, they were told that they could return anytime and discuss the objects with anyone as long as it was done in a hypotheticalsense and no identifying data were disseminated. A year or so ago, he contacted thisgroup and asked if the offer was still good. He was told that indeed it was and thatthe collection had grown tremendously. The philosophy was that no one wouldbelieve the story unless supporting evidence was included and that would result indire consequences.\" THE ROSWELL BITS & PIECES Since the Moore and Berlitz book, The Roswell Incident (1980), I have received a numberof letters and phone calls from low-profile sources who offer cryptic morsels about theRoswell affair. Some, as I recall, were allegedly firsthand, though most were through thegrapevine. Most all were not heard from again. That's normal, regardless of the topic, in thisbusiness. As one researcher, Paul Smith of Riverside, California, told me in his letter ofFebruary 20, 1984, \"I find it interesting that people are willing to offer tantalizing tidbits tothe UFO puzzle, but when it comes down to show and tell, it's 99.9% tell, but no show.\" One letter, however, is worth quoting in part for a couple of reasons as it refers to Roswelland to Dr. Hynek. It came to me from Chuck Harder, commentator for the radio programFor the People, aired nationally from Cedar Key, Florida. Signed by Norman Richards, theletter at first recounts a UFO sighting over Japan in August 1947, by many members of hisregiment of the 25th Tropic Lightning Division. He goes on to say that General DouglasMacArthur ordered an investigation. According to a story later published in The PacificStars and Stripes, the \"huge silver disc\" remained unexplained. Richards then goes on torelate: Norman Richards: \"In 1950, I was in the ROTC program of the Air Force atIndiana University. We were sent to Lowry Air Force Base for six weeks trainingthat summer. One day, we had a lecture by a colonel from Wright-Patterson AFB.He outlined many changes and new experimental aircraft being tested. During thequestion and answer session, he was asked if UFOs were real. He got very excitedand said we had better believe it. He went on to tell us of the crash and retrieval ofthe parts and the humanoids found at the site. He said they were under investigationat Wright-Patterson after being flown from Roswell, New Mexico. The pieces wereof a material unknown to us - the humanoids he described were much like those"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"depicted on the TV show, Unsolved Mysteries. \"I was in Lubbock, Texas, in the year the Sputnik frightened the world. One night, aUFO landed between Lubbock and Amarillo. Many police, elected officials and otherreputable people reported what they had seen on local radio, TV and in thenewspapers. I corresponded with J. Allen Hynek at Northwestern University and hewrote me confirming all three occurrences. (Italics mine, Len Stringfield). I prefer to believe that Hynek was being over-graciously accommodating if, indeed, he had\"confirmed\" the Roswell bodies at Wright-Patterson AFB. I have no address for NormanRichards for a follow-up. And finally, a word from an investigative journalist, Jim Marrs, author of the bookCrossfire, published in 1989. This popular book ties together all the loose ends of evidenceabout President Kennedy's assassination and leaves little doubt about a governmentcover-up hiding the real facts. Learning of Marrs's more-than-casual interest in UFOs from researcher William Jones ofColumbus, Ohio, I called the author for details. His letter of April 1, 1991, is quoted in part,as follows: Jim Marrs: \"... I was aviation/aerospace writer for the Ft. Worth Star Telegramfrom approximately 1970-1980. During this time, I also was the primary writer onmilitary matters. During this decade, on at least two occasions, I met men whoclaimed to have been stationed at Ft. Worth Air Force Base in 1947. Both men toldme how the rumors flew around the base after several pieces of strange metal (somecovered with writing similar to hieroglyphics) were brought to the base from a NewMexico crash-site. Reportedly, this metal was from a disc-shaped device whichcrashed near Roswell, New Mexico, sometime in early July 1947. There also wererumors that dead crew members had been recovered and sent to Wright Field. ... \"It is indeed unfortunate that I did not fully interview these two men at the time. ...Imention these two only because they told me they were at the base during the time inquestion and that the incident indeed occurred.\" During our phone discussion, Marrs was quick to put down the rumor that the assassinationinvolved a Secret Service agent who turned from the front seat of the presidential limousineto fire the fatal shot. As the rumor goes, Kennedy was the target because he planned torelease the real UFO story to the public. I saw the movie sequence reputedly showing theagent firing at Kennedy and heard all the rumors for years and gave them no credence. Crossfire, however, jam-packed with a collection of startling data, is blunt about theprobability of high-level political involvement in a conspiracy to assassinate PresidentKennedy and even suggests the complicity of certain loose-cannon characters within theCIA, FBI and the Secret Service who might have used the criminal world to do the triggerwork. If this kind of twisted word is true, then where would the UFO fit if there issomething to gain or to lose by hiding the truth? While I have always respected theseagencies for their unheralded good work, they do in their respective fields, I am also awarethat each has played an undercover role in UFO affairs. But, frankly, it is only in the worldof rumor and hearsay have I heard of their use of extreme measures to control UFOsecrecy.Continued in Part 6.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
