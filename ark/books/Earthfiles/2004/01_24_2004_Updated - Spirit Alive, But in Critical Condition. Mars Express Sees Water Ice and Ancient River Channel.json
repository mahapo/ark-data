Updated - January 24, 2004 Pasadena, California -Spirit Communication Revived Briefly,But Rover's In \"Critical\" ConditionOn January 23, the flight team for NASA's Spirit rover finally received data fromthe silent robot in a communication session that began at 5:26 a.m. PST andlasted 20 minutes at a data rate of 120 bits per second. Spirit's response wasprovoked by a JPL command to Spirit at 5:02 PST via the NASA Deep SpaceNetwork antenna complex near Madrid, Spain, telling Spirit to begintransmitting about its problems.Pete Theisinger, Project Manager for the Mars Exploration Rover Project (Spiritand Opportunity) told reporters at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory inPasadena, \"The spacecraft sent limited data in a proper response to a groundcommand, and we're planning for commanding further communication sessionslater today.\" Later, he said Spirit was in \"critical\" condition. \"The chances that itwill be perfect again are not good.\"NASA scientists think something has happened to Spirit's computer hardware.The robot had taken hundreds of images and was about to make its first roboticarm \"scratching\" on the surface of the pyramid-shaped rock called \"Adirondack\"when its steady flow of scientific data abruptly stopped.\"Adirondack\" rock as Spirit rover approached to try for the first timeits scratching tool on the rock's surface. Spirit extended its robotic arm toward the rockand all scientific data abruptly stopped.

This isthe first direct confirmation.\" Allen Moorehouse, ESAOMEGA, the combined Mars Express camera and infrared spectrometer,observed the southern polar cap of Mars on January 18, 2004, as seen on all three bands.Left: H2O, water ice. Middle: CO2, carbon dioxide ice. Right: Visible image of Martiansouth pole.Images credit: European Space Agency.The European Space Agency is in high spirits as its first mission to Mars hasalready produced \"stunning results\" after instruments aboard its Mars Expressorbiter were switched on. OMEGA, the combined Mars Express camera andinfrared spectrometer, observed the southern polar cap of Mars on January 18,2004, as seen on all three bands in the ESA image above, which confirmed thepresence of water ice and carbon dioxide ice.Professor David Southwood, ESA Director of Science, said after seeing thecamera and spectrometer images, \"I did not expect to be able to gather together -just one month after the Mars Orbit Insertion of December 25, 2003 so manyhappy scientists eager to present their first results.\" ESA scientist AllenMoorehouse said, \"This is the first time water ice has been detected on theground. This is the first direct confirmation.\"ESA reports: \"The new high-resolution spectrometer data shows different carbondioxide distribution in the northern and southern hemispheres. The Marsinstrument, a sophisticated radio transmitter and receiver, emitted a first signalsuccessfully on 21 January that was received on Earth through a 70- meterantenna in Australia after it was reflected and scattered from the surface ofMars. This new measurement technique allows the detection of the chemicalcomposition of the Mars atmosphere, ionosphere and surface.\"ASPERA, a plasma and energetic neutral atoms analyzer, hopefully will answerthe fundamental question about whether the solar wind erosion led to thepresent lack of water on the Martian surface. The preliminary results show adifference in the characteristics between the impact of the solar wind area andthe measurement made in the tail of Mars.Another exciting experiment was run by the SPICAM instrument (an ultravioletand infrared spectrometer) during the first star occultation ever made at Mars. Ithas simultaneously measured the distribution of the ozone and water vapor,which has never been done before, revealing that there is more water vaporwhere there is less ozone.

ESA announced: \"This picture was taken by the High Resolution Stereo Camera(HRSC) onboard ESA's Mars Express orbiter, in color and 3-D, on January 15,2004, from a height of 273 kilometers (170 miles). The location is east of theHellas basin at 41° South and 101° East. The area is 100 kilometers across, witha resolution of 12 meters per pixel, and shows the Reull Vallis channel onceformed by flowing water. The landscape is seen in a vertical view with North atthe top.\" Valles Marineris, Largest Canyon in Solar SystemEurope Space Agency's (ESA) Mars Express first color image inside small portionof the Martian \"Grand Canyon,\" Valles Marineris, the largest canyon in thesolar system. Image courtesy ESA Mars Express.On January 14, 2004, the European Space Agency (ESA) reported that \"the firstspectacular stereoscopic colour picture\" was taken of the Grand Canyon of Marsknown as Valles Marineris. \"The image covers a 1700 km long and 65 km wideswath which was taken in south-north direction. It is the first image of this sizethat shows the surface of Mars in high resolution (12 metres per pixel), incolour, and in 3D. One looks at a landscape which has been predominantlyshaped by the erosional action of water. Millions of cubic kilometres of rockhave been removed, and the surface features seen now such as mountain ranges,valleys, and mesas, have been formed.\"The image was taken by ESA's Mars Express satellite from 275 kilometers abovethe surface of Mars by the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC).
