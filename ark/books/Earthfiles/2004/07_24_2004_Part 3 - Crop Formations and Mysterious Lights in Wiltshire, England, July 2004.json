Guro has been teaching Norwegian as asecond language to international children for twenty years. As Charles Mallett experiencedat the dinner with them, Bente is especially intuitive. But everyone was surprised that thevery field upon which Bente placed her finger during the map discussion on July 16,received the enormous pattern discovered at 6 a.m. the next morning, July 17, by the farmowner. See Part 2. Then, on Wednesday to Thursday night, July 21 to 22, 2004, Guro and Irene visited theconcentric formation at the top of the South Field below Woodborough Hill, allegedly madeby German researchers in a professional experiment in which the farmer, Tim Carson, waspaid for the crop space used. Around 10:30 p.m. - not too long after dark in the bright summer Wiltshire evenings - Guroand Irene decided to go over to the top of Adam's Grave so they could have a good view ofthe East Field below, a place long known for mysterious lights and spectacular cropformations. Neither woman had ever seen what appeared before them between the EastField and Woodborough Hill.Interview:Guro Parvanova, Teacher for 20 years of Norwegian as second language tointernational children, Oslo,Norway:\"We were standing there (atop Adam's Grave) for quite a long time, about 1.5 hours. Wesaw many lights, different colors, different shapes, different movements. They were movingall over and in all directions.WHAT KIND OF LIGHTS WERE YOU SEEING? COLORS, SIZES?We saw first some orange lights. We thought it was a street light. It was stationary andrather big like a street light you see half a kilometer away. Orange.WAS THIS IN THE EAST FIELD ITSELF?No, it was far behind. I was there today together with my colleague Irene and we saw thatit was to the right of Woodborough Hill and there were no lights there. There is no roadthere because we looked through binoculars at the site.SO IT STARTED WITH AN ORANGE LIGHT.An orange, stationary light, a round light. Then we suddenly saw another light pop out rightbehind it a small distance. From our point of view, it was only about 5 centimeters from theother one. Then these two lights started to move very slowly to and from, up and down,and sideways. The first light was much brighter than the other one. It was fading at timesand coming back.Then a third light appeared a bit over and behind the other two. It was fainter, but still veryvisible. But we just watched those lights for about 15 to 20 minutes without seeing anythingelse. We just concentrated on them. And then, we started to look around. It was a veryclear night and warm. There was no wind at all, which was strange up there (on Adam'sGrave.)Then we started to see some small white lights popping up and fainting here and there allover in front of us. It was just like a light show.WOULD YOU SAY THERE WERE DOZENS OR HUNDREDS?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"We were there at least 1.5 hours and I think we saw at least 100 lights altogether over thattime. But we started to watch one special light a white light looking like a star. That was tothe right of Golden Ball hill. It was moving and it was fairly bright, but fainting at time, andit was moving a bit up and down and sideways at the same time. It was not very high abovethe Golden Ball hill. We watched that one at the same time as we also watched the orangelights. Yellow \"Funnel\" in the SkyThen, this white light was moving quite a bit during the time we watched it. Then Isuddenly turned around and to my back (Milk Hill) at the right side of Milk Hill, there isanother hill, flatter. We suddenly saw something like a pipe or a funnel of brightyellow-white light and it was rather high and it was going behind this hill. We watched thatfor awhile. Bizarre Camera Lens ProblemYOU'RE BACK IS TO THE EAST FIELD AND WOODBOROUGH HILL?Yes. We just watched. Then my friend, Irene, was running for the camera. When she cameback, the yellow funnel was gone in the meantime. It was about 5 minutes. When wewanted to take a picture, my camera did not work. It was like the lens was broken, likethreads when you break it, it becomes blurred and you can't see through. We couldn't seeanything through it, neither of us.BUT YOUR CAMERA WAS NOT BROKEN?No. This morning it was perfectly all right. It is not a digital camera. It is 35 mm with film.Nikon camera, rather old.DID EITHER OF YOU GET ANY OF THE LIGHT ACTIVITY ON ANY CAMERA?No, it was impossible. We couldn't see anything through the lens.SO IT WAS LIKE YOU WATCHED THE LIGHT SHOW AND THEN WHEN YOUFINALLY WANTED TO GET PHOTOGRAPHS, WHATEVER THE PHENOMENONWAS, IT BLOCKED IT.We couldn't see through the lens.WAS THE YELLOW FUNNEL THE LAST THING THAT YOU SAW?No. Then, the real thing started. From the right side just over East Field, it came alive. Itwas not very high up and it was rather close to us. I was there today to see it in brightdaylight and I saw that it probably would go right over a small hill in the middle of EastField. It was going in a very funny way. It was very clear blue, like a blue star but ratherbigger than a star. And it had a very bright white light around it. I would say it was an orb.But it was flattened on the top and the bottom. And it started to move in a very slow wayand in a smooth motion. Communication from A LightWe watched that for at least two minutes. I simply felt this is something really special. I hadthe feeling that this was a kind of contact because it was so close. We had somecommunication with it.DID YOU HAVE THOUGHTS COME INTO YOUR MIND?Ye s .WHAT WERE THE THOUGHTS?The thoughts were that either we are going up there, or they are coming down.WHAT DID YOU INTERPRET THAT TO MEAN?I was happy, very happy. It was an amazing moment. We were just standing there. Wecouldn't speak. We were just looking and following this thing. We just felt contact. Then"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"after some few minutes when it was going to go behind the Golden Ball hill, it suddenlyfainted out'HOW DID YOU INTERPRET, 'EITHER WE ARE GOING UP THERE, OR THEY ARECOMING DOWN'? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?I think it was a connection.BUT FROM WHAT?I don't know.WHERE WOULD IT BE THAT IT MIGHT TAKE YOU UP TO IT, OR IT MIGHT COMEDOWN TO YOU?I felt that it was not just a light. It must be something else. I felt it was intelligent and it is ina way talking to us.And I have to tell you that today I heard that several people in front of The Barge Inn haveseen a bluish light at the same time.LAST NIGHT (July 21, 2004), WAS ANY FORMATION DISCOVERED WHERE YOUSAW THE LIGHTS?No. Not there. There was a new one today (July 22, 2004) just under the Pewsey WhiteHorse. (Thought to be a hoax. The first Pewsey White Horse formation was consideredgenuinely mysterious by some researchers).SO FAR, NOTHING HAS APPEARED WHERE YOU SAW THE LIGHTS DANCING?No. When we saw the special blue and white light fading out behind Golden Ball Hill, thelast light, we could still see it in a way. But it was just like in another dimension. I can'texplain it. We could follow it somehow, but it was not bright anymore. We left and couldnot sleep all night.\" Also see: 2004 Unique Canadian Crop Formations: Scorched Soybeans and \"Dirt\"Pattern in Barley.
