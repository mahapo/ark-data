Image based oneyewitness drawings © 2003 by Adgraphics. January 18, 2004 Grande Prairie, Alberta, Canada - A little after 7 p.m.MT in February 2003, on a very clear night outside Grande Prairie, Alberta,Canada, two grade school friends were sledding in a back yard until they saw abig triangular piece of the starry sky move. Neither wants their names to be usedin this report, but I was able to interview now-11-year-old, \"Sally,\" who is stillin grade school with an interest in art and music. Her neighbor is a year older.Interview: \"Sally,\" 11-years-old, Grande Prairie, Alberta, Canada: \"We were outsideand tobogganing on the hill and I fell and I was laying on the ground and lookedup and I saw these three stars moving at the same time and the stars inside weremoving with it.It was a perfect triangle and it was really, really, really big and it was goingreally slowly and silently. And the stars in the corner were bigger than the starson the inside. The stars on the inside were in kind of a pattern, like it was just aline around the edge and it was in a pattern. There was a little red dot in themiddle, like a very small dot in the middle of it.WHEN YOU SAY THERE WAS A PATTERN OF THE LIGHTS IN THERE,HOW WOULD IT BE DIFFERENT FROM THE STARRY SKY THAT IT WASMOVING THROUGH?The stars were more spread out everywhere and the ones on the inside (of thetriangle) were spaced evenly in a line. And had little smaller ones inside in aline.SO THERE WERE THE APPEARANCE OF MORE ORDERED STARS INSTRAIGHT LINES INSIDE OF THE TRIANGLE?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Ye s .ABOUT HOW CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE SPEED THAT THE TRIANGLEOF LIGHTS WAS MOVING?It was going very, very slowly. It barely moved. It was like you could tell it wasmoving, b ut it was going very sl owl y.WHAT WAS THE VERY FIRST THOUGHT THAT WENT THROUGH YOURMIND WHEN YOU SAW THIS MOVING?I just said, 'Oh, my gosh I know what that is!' And I started to get really scared.WHEN YOU SAID, 'I KNOW WHAT THAT IS,' WHAT WERE YOUTHINKING?I was thinking that it was a UFO.YOU WERE THINKING IT WAS A UFO BECAUSE WHY?Because I knew that stars didn't really move like that and satellites don't do thatand airplanes don't do that. I knew it wasn't just stars or a plane or satellites orsomething because three satellites couldn't move like that and have all the starsinside it move at the same time, too. So, I knew what it was and started to getreally scared. So I said, 'I'm going inside because I don't feel very good.'A UFO WOULD MEAN WHAT TO YOU?Just something like aliens it's just like then when I saw it, it was a sign of fear. It'sjust something because it's something that no one knows barely anything about.Basically, it just automatically scares you.DID YOU HAVE ANY SENSE THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING IN THISTRIANGLE THAT WANTED ANYTHING FROM THE EARTH OR US?Not really. The only thing I was really feeling right then was fear.FEAR ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD DO?That it would like take me away or something.IT LOOKED IN YOUR FATHER'S ANIMATION LIKE IT TOOK UP A LOT OFTHE SKY. DID IT?Yes, it was really big, but it was high up. But it was really big and went reallyslowly.YOU WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT HOW LONG?Four or five minutes.\" Computer Animation of the Triangle of StarsSally, who now lives with her re-married mother in Canada after her parentsdivorced, waited until Christmas time 2003 while visiting her father inVancouver to talk about the moving triangle of stars. Her father is a professionalcomputer graphics animator who asked Sally to draw what she had seen onpaper. Sally's father then took Sally's drawings and over a period of four hourswhile she worked with him, generated an animation of what the girls had seennearly a year earlier.

I described some of it to him and he drewit on the computer and then animated it.DID YOU SAY, 'NO, THAT DOESN'T LOOK QUITE RIGHT OR IT WENTSLOWER OR FASTER'?Yes, I did.WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE ANIMATION THAT YOUR FATHER NOWHAS IS VERY CLOSE TO WHAT YOU AND YOUR FRIEND SAW?Ye s .AND THAT IT TOOK AT LEAST MINUTES BEFORE YOU WENT IN THEHOUSE?Ye s .AND THIS WAS MOVING SLOWLY AND WHEN YOU FIRST SAW IT WASTHE TRIANGLE OF MOVING STARS NEAR THE ZENITH, THE TOP, OFTHE SKY?It was right above me.SO THE FIRST MOMENT THAT YOU AND YOUR FRIEND SAW THESTARS MOVING, IT WAS DIRECTLY ABOVE YOU?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Ye s .THEN AS IT MOVED SLOWLY, HOW FAR DID IT GO IN THE TIME THATYOU WATCHED?Not very far because it went really slow. It went about 5 inches or somethingfrom my perspective. It didn't go very far.AS THE TRIANGLE CONTAINING STARS SLOWLY MOVED, BEHINDTHE TRIANGLE WAS STILL THE STARRY SKY, RIGHT?Yes, and they weren't moving at all.SO YOU BECAME AWARE THAT WHATEVER THE BIG TRIANGLE WAS,IT WAS ALMOST LIKE CAMOUFLAGE USING STARS OR THE IMAGESOF STARS LIKE CAMOUFLAGE IN THE SKY?Ye s .DID YOU TALK ABOUT THIS WITH YOUR FRIEND?No, not really. Actually, I've never brought it up since that day, I've neverbrought it up before.WHY?Because I knew other people would not believe me or they would get scared orsomething.WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SCARED OF?It's not that I'm scared that anything might happen, it's just kind of a natural fearthat I have because my dad is really into that kind of stuff. So, he's alwaystalking about like aliens might abduct you or something. So I was getting afraidof that thought because I knew it was a UFO.DID EITHER OF YOU GO BACK OUTSIDE TO SEE IF IT WERE STILLTHERE MOVING IN THE SKY?No.THAT NIGHT, DID YOU TELL YOUR PARENTS OR ANYBODY?No.AND THE REASON YOU DIDN'T EVEN TELL YOUR PARENTS WASWHAT?Because I thought they would either get scared or not believe me.WHY DO YOU THINK PEOPLE WOULD NOT BELIEVE YOU?Because a lot of people especially around here wouldn't really they wouldn't it'snot the kind of thing they are interested in . A lot of people kind of know,maybe heard (about UFOs) once or twice, but it's not really a subject ofconversation around here. Hardly anybody even barely knows about it orbelieves they are out there.I WONDER IF YOU THINK EXTRATERRESTRIALS ARE HERE ON OURPLANET NOW?Yes, I do actually. I believe we are not the only ones in the whole universe, theonly life forms on the only planet able to carry living beings. I do believe therehave been visits and that there are extraterrestrials and aliens and that kind ofstuff here.DOES THAT SCARE YOU NOW?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Not as much as it did last year because now I've come to realize that it's notreally it's not like they will hurt you or anything, and there is so little chance ofthem coming to you, one person out of so many billions of people in the wholeworld.DO YOU EXPECT TO SEE SOMETHING LIKE THAT AGAIN?Most likely. I wouldn't be surprised.BECAUSE?Because there have been a lot of sightings around these parts and it's so manypeople, there have been so many frequent reports of sightings, I wouldn't besurprised if I saw one again.IF YOU DID THIS TIME, WOULD YOU TELL PEOPLE?Ye s , I w o u l d . \"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
