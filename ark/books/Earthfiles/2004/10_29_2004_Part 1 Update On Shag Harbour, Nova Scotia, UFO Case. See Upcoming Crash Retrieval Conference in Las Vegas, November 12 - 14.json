See you in Las Vegas in November! Click on banners above. October 28, 2004 Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, Canada - In two weeks, the SecondAnnual UFO Crash Retrieval Conference will be held at the Sunset Station Hotel inHenderson, a suburb of Las Vegas, Nevada. The speaker line up features Canadianresearchers Grant Cameron and Don Ledger; British researcher Nick Redfern andAmerican investigators including myself, Jim Marrs, Peter Robbins, Dr. David Pace,Stephen Bassett, Dr. Robert M. Wood and his son, Ryan Wood. The subject matter focusesas much as possible on documents and eyewitnesses about government knowledge andcover-up of non-human technologies and entities which have been retrieved in crashessince at least the 1940s. One of the speakers, Canadian Don Ledger, has investigated the extraordinary October 4to11, 1967 Nova Scotia case that provoked both Canadian and American militaryinvestigations for seven days in the region of Shag Harbour, the Canadian Forces BaseShelburne and Baccaro Point, where the NORAD radar base about ten miles from ShagHarbour was called CFS Barrington. Don Ledger learned from two military personnel thatone or two objects were tracked coming over Siberia and the Arctic Circle at 7700 mphbefore dipping down into Canadian airspace and under the water in Shag Harbour at thesouthern tip of Nova Scotia. Don Ledger worked as a civil servant sound engineer and TV producer-director for theprovincial government in the Province of Nova Scotia for thirty-four years. He is alicensed private pilot, who has owned two aircraft and has about 1,200 hours flying time.Don did not begin researching the Shag Harbour incident until the early 1990s after hisfriend, Chris Stiles, told him about the intensive government and military involvement inthe 7-day incident. Don had been haunted himself by a personal sighting on October 4,1967. He was working as a salesman at the time and was up at 3 a.m. on October 4 inorder to make a meeting in Yarmouth. Driving by Cape Sable Island south of ShagHarbour, Don was confused and amazed by aerial objects that did not fit any airplane heknew.Shag Harbour and nearby Clark's Harbour are at the southern tip of Nova Scotia, Canada. Interview:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Don Ledger, Retired Civil Servant Sound Engineer and TV Producer-Director,Province of Nova Scotia (employed 34 years); and author Maritime UFO Files ©1998, Swissair Down (Flt. 111) © 2000; Dark Object (Shag Harbour) © 2001: \"Iobserved a bunch of red lights over the water at Shag Harbour. They were veryanomalous. I've been a pilot with a license for about twenty-three years. But I've alwaysbeen interested in airplanes and I knew what aircraft could do and could not do. Theydefinitely could not do what these things in the air were doing out over the water!CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT YOU WERE SEEING?I was seeing just red lights, possibly ten or a dozen of them out over the water, but theywere zipping around. They were acting in a haphazard manner. They just weren't flying,they weren't entering or departing space or anything like that. They were just movingaround the area, flitting around out there. Very anomalous but very small andunspectacular looking except that what they were doing was very unusual.THE COLOR IF YOU WERE COMPARING THAT RED TO SOMETHING THAT WEMIGHT ALL MIGHT KNOW, WHAT COLOR RED WOULD IT BE?That's what's strange about it it was like the red you would see on a nav light on anaircraft. But, seeing what I was seeing was too unusual for them to have been nav lights onan aircraft. Plus, they were interacting with each other. They weren't flying in formation.They were sort of zipping around and passing each other, very reckless type of thing.When I got back home, my wife mentioned about there having been something strangehappen down on the South Shore of Nova Scotia. Then it was in the newspaper the nextday and that was the Shag Harbour incident. But I did not realize then that I was going tobe involved in it all these years later. How It All BeganInitially it was a young fisherman, 18-years-old, named Laurie Wickens nicknamed 'Dicky'by his friends - who was driving four girls home after a dance over in Clark's Harbor whichis the area where I saw the red lights. There are maybe ten miles as the crow flies to ShagHarbour. The five teenagers were driving along just to the east of Shag Harbour when theynoticed some lights that appeared to be hovering slightly in the sky, just holding there andpointing down at a 45 degree angle. Then the lights started coming down toward the water.They were bright amber flashing lights flashing sequentially from front to back and back tofront if you could call the front being the downward most point of the lights.The group drove around Prospect Point and someone heard a whoosh and a bang and asthey got around the corner, they pulled up in what is called the old Irish Moss Plant. Thatlooks the same as it did in 1967. It's still there, right on the edge of the water at the edge ofShag Harbour, and the road is probably no more than fifty feet from the water's edge there.They pulled over in this gravel lot and got out and saw what looked like an object sittingon the water with a pale yellow light on the top, either drifting with the tide or under itsown power, heading out to sea. At this point, it was only 800 or 900 feet away from them.The teenagers thought it was an airplane that had just crashed into the harbor. So, Lauriegot back in the car with the girls and they went just a little further up the road to anotherfishing village that is only about half or three-quarters of a mile away called Lower WoodsHarbor. There was an Irving's gas station there and a pay phone.Laurie called the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP Mounties) in BarringtonPassage which is on the eastern side of Shag Harbour, opposite from their road sighting.Laurie got hold of a Corporal Werbicki who was on duty at the time. Lauri said he thoughtan airplane had just crashed into the harbor. Werbicki said that another phone line wasringing. He was manning the station by himself. So, he asked Lauri for the telephonenumber on the pay phone and told him to hang up and he would call him back. But to juststay there for a moment.When he hung up, Corporal Werbicki got two or three more calls from people phoning insaying that an airplane might have crashed into the sound next to Shag Harbour. So, nowWerbicki was taking it seriously. After the third phone call, he called Lauri back and askedhim if he would go back to where he had seen the thing floating on the water and keep aneye on it until Werbicki could get there.Werbicki hung up with Lauri and called two RCMP officers that were in a cruiser stakingout a spot down in Lower Woods Harbor waiting for deer-jackers, which are poachers.Officer Ron Pond and Officer Ron O'Brien. The two Rons. Ron Pond was the rookie and"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"the other fellow is what is called a floating constable. He would travel from detachment todetachment along the south shore, going where needed. After talking to Werbicki , theMounties headed back to Shag Harbour.In the meantime, Dave Kendrick and Norman Smith two other young fishermen who wereonly 17 and 18 years old, were coming toward Shag Harbour. Dave Kendrick was drivingand Norman Smith, his passenger, mentioned he thought he saw something up in the sky.The young men saw what looked like four to five sequentially flashing amber-coloredlights headed down toward the water.Because of the winding road, Dave Kendrick could not keep his eye on them too muchbecause he could go off the road. So Norm Smith got the best view of this thing and he sawit for about 20 seconds before it disappeared behind a treeline.Dave Kendrick dropped off Norm Smith at his home just at the edge of Shag Harbourvillage limits and he went home and told his mother about what he had seen in the sky.Norm Smith was just going back into the house when he noticed lights in the sky again. Sohe went running in to get his father and brought him outside. They both watched this thingwhich looked like it was going to go into the water.While they were watching, they decided they should get some clothes on and go overtowards the harbor in case it was an airplane crash and they could help. As they weretalking about that, two Mountie cars went by going down toward the harbor which wereresponding to Lauri Wickens's call.So, why was Norm Smith and his father just seeing an object go into the water? Probablybecause there was more than one object going into Shag Harbour that night. As a matter offact, that's confirmed by a couple of military people. One was a radio traffic officer. I wastalking to him on the phone and he said, 'You know there were two objects that night.'I said, 'Yes, I suspected it,' but I wasn't 100% sure until he said it. There were otherwitnesses who saw two objects in the sky. That night was just phenomenal. There was thismini-UFO wave going on the southwestern half of Nova Scotia. If you look at the countryon the map, it's stretched out northeast to southwest and then joined on the mainland. Butthat southwestern part of it, a portion of it, was alive with UFO reports, which is moredetailed in my book than I can possibly get into for this phone interview.WHAT WAS THE MOST DRAMATIC ACCOUNT?The most dramatic account was the object going into the water, the Mounties arriving onthe site and seeing this pale yellow light floating out on the water. Nobody knew what itwas. But anybody who was there will tell you that it was not a buoy light or anything likethat. They knew where they all were and not where this thing was. It appeared to bedrifting above the water at maybe 10 to 12 feet in the air. It was one of these situationswhere what you could make out was more an absence of light, rather than seeing theobject. But it looked like it was about 60 feet long and possibly 10 to 12 feet thick through a lens shape, your classic UFO object or flying saucer what government documents latercalled a \"dark object.\"But don't forget now that everyone was thinking that they were seeing an airplane on thewater, or at least an airplane that crashed into the water. So, the first thing to do was to tryto get to them. There might be survivors or bodies out there.It was a fairly calm, cool, starry night and no moon. Three Mounties arrived - CorporalVictor Werbicki RCMP, was in charge. The other two were constables. Corporal Werbickidecided he would find a couple of fishing boats to get out there and told Ron O'Brien to goand contact the RMCP in Halifax the Rescue Coordination Center, which is a military-operated tri-service operation that can bring in the Navy, Coast Guard, and the helicopters.The rookie, Ron Pond, was left to take down the stories of the witnesses.Now, everybody saw the thing out there, but about the time they decided to do somethingabout it, the yellow light disappeared. They didn't know whether it went out, or sunk. Thefishermen got some vessels from the government wharf up in Shag Harbour. They went outthrough the western approach. This would have been Norman Smith's uncle, LawrenceSmith and Bradford Chand and their boats those were the first two out. Eventually therewere six boats up there and then the Coast Guard cutter showed up and there was quite asearch effort. Yellow Light and Yellow, Glittering \"Foam\"But the first two boats went out across the sound and encountered the first of theanomalies which was this thick, cream, golden-yellow, glittering 'foam,' as the fishermen"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"described it, the ones we've interviewed. It was really thick on the water, about three tofour inches thick. It was about 80 feet wide and about half a mile long. There was a roilingin the water and some bubbling. There was maybe the smell of sulfur in the water.Now, they were thinking this might have something to do with the interaction of jet fuel orsome time of aviation fuel with sea water. They didn't know. They were all kind of nervousthinking they were going to find bodies. But they never found anything except this foam.WAS IT GLOWING?It sort of glittered. One of the fisherman said, 'Like as if you took shaving cream.' It didn'tlook like sea foam. They all knew what sea foam looks like and this wasn't anything likethat. If you took sort of shaving cream and sprinkled sort of yellow speckles or goldspeckles on it, it had that kind of shimmer to it.Later on, in one of the military documents, it said it was a shame that nobody thought totake a sample, but no one was thinking that they were looking for anything unusual exceptfor bodies.I remember Ron O'Brien telling me that it was so clear that night and quiet out there on thewater. They could hear the twin diesels starting up on the Coast Guard cutter over onClark's Harbor, thirteen miles away. It took the Coast Guard almost an hour to get to RonO'Brien and gave him a message that the Rescue Coordination Center had done a fullmilitary search and even checked down in the eastern U. S. looking for commercial flightsand military flights as well. Nothing was missing. Everyone was wondering, 'What the heckwere we looking for? What was this that went into the water?'The rest of the story comes after that. The ensuing search. The Navy sent down divers.They were looking for something that might have been on the bottom.Remember, the main part of the incident - or at least the Shag Harbour sighting beganaround twenty minutes after 11 p.m. on the evening of October 4, 1967. So, we're quicklyinto October 5, and by October 6, the newspaper in Halifax was taking this pretty seriously particularly the Halifax Chronicle Herald, which has been around for about 200 years inone form or another and is one of the most widely read newspapers in eastern Canada. It'sa pretty prestigious newspaper as well. They posted a headline at the top of theirnewspaper on the following Saturday saying, 'Could Be Something Concrete In ShagHarbour UFO-RCAF.' That was quite a thing for this newspaper to put something like thaton their banner headline at the top of the newspaper because it's a pretty conservative ragand still is today.The Chronicle-Herald, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, October 6, 1967.Anyway, the divers were down by Friday afternoon to do a look. They wanted to knockoff around 6 p.m. that evening and say they had not found anything. But the word cameback from Halifax to stay at it until they were told to stop, which was kind of unusual. So,they kept at it until Sunday night around 8 p.m. Then they were told they coulddiscontinue the search and go back to Halifax. Canadian and American Counterintelligence?There was a portion of the story I've been investigating off and on for the past couple ofyears which has a connection to the Yukon here where a couple of twin sisters live upthere now and claim there father was involved in this thing and he was a captain in theRCAF at Greenwood AFB and was told to go to Halifax to pick up material that had beengathered from the water and taken to Halifax, the Naval Armament Depot there, and thentransported to the United States.Some of it is anecdotal and some records, but it's difficult to prove any of it. We do knowthere was a man by the name of Mace Cofee, Maurice Cofee, who was a psychologistworking for the Defense Research Board here in Canada. He was assigned somehow to the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"case. He was the receiver of goods from Shag Harbour and took them and had theminvestigated at the Naval Armament Depot. Now, we don't know for sure whether thisparticular stuff that was brought up off the bottom was anomalous or not. But it seemsstrange to me that if it was anything other than anomalous, why would they put it on aflatbed truck and take it down to the United States?DID YOU EVER GET ANY DETAILS ABOUT WHETHER HIS WORK INPSYCHOLOGY HAD TO DO WITH COUNTERINTELLIGENCE?I imagine he had something to do with counterintelligence. We touched base eventuallywith his daughter. (He has since passed away.) She told us she remembered a lot of peoplein and out of their lives who were involved with the military. There was always some sortof secret thing going on. She would ask him about UFOs on different occasions and hewould not talk about it. But of course, the fact he wouldn't talk about it does not make itfact that there was something there. But our subsequent attempts to contact people heworked with long ago have been fruitless. They won't talk to us.HAVE YOU ASKED POINT BLANK, 'DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEFOAM OR THE YELLOW LIGHT IN SHAG HARBOUR ON OCTOBER 4 to 6, 1967?No, there was no one to talk to because no one would talk to us in that regard.WHAT IS THE STRONGEST EVIDENCE, EITHER IN EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY ORDOCUMENTS OR PHYSICAL EVIDENCE THAT YOU'VE COME ACROSS IN YOURINVESTIGATION, THAT WOULD LINK THE SHAG HARBOUR INCIDENT IN 1967TO SOMETHING IN THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL REALM?I mentioned the people involved as original witnesses thought it was an airplane. But it wasthe military that tagged it as a UFO on the documents. There's quite a document trail here,starting with the Air Desk in Ottawa. This is the one that used to handle UFO reports.Squadron Leader Bain, who was in charge that particular night, is the one who made themargin notes on the document stating 'UFO' and he underlined it three times. He is the onethat got the search initiated through the Rescue Coordination Center in Halifax to go lookon the bottom.The paper trail after that there is a Col. Turner involved. He was the overall coordinator ofthe search who made no bones about the fact that this could not be explained away by anyspace junk, could not be explained away by flares, it could not be explained away byaircraft. We have different documents denoting particular occurrences after the fact. Forinstance, there was a flight of B-52 bombers that went over within 20 to 25 minutes afterthis heading north. These would have come out of Loring AFB in Maine. One wonderswhy?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"October 6, 1967 Memorandum from Col. W. W.
