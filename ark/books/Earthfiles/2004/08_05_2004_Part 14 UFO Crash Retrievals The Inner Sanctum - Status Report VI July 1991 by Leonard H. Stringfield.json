Len Stringfield: \"ANOTHER 'ACORN': ITS CRASH/RETRIEVAL NEAR EDWARDS AFB,1971 "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Earlier I made reference to a case of a UFO landing at Edwards AFB which wasrecorded on movie film by an Air Force officer (and his crew), who later became anastronaut. Without knowing that UFO's fate, or perhaps of others we never heardabout at the base, we now have a report that 'something' landed, or crash-landed, in1971 just 15 miles outside of its vast property near the small town of California City,California. This incident surfaced from a firsthand witness, Debbie Clayton, who feltobliged to report her experience after watching the rerun of the Kecksburg UFOcrash on Unsolved Mysteries. When I talked with Debby by phone after getting hername from Stan Gordon, she said she thought the craft depicted on the show,described as an acorn shape, looked similar to the object she had seen - except thathers was like a mushroom at the top. Her letter recounting her experience follows:Debby Clayton: 'Since last talking with you, I gathered more information. Icalled my old girlfriend's ex and he said that she remembered the incidentoccurring in the summer of 1971 because they hadn't moved to our area untilwinter of 1970. So, I was incorrect about the date. It was late afternoon, but it was still daylight when we (my girlfriend's familyand I) heard a loud, roaring noise similar to the roaring of a plane warming up.Then we heard the crashing sound and went outside to see what happened.We found a cloud of dust three blocks in front of us. Since there were only sixhomes in our neighborhood, it was easy to spot. My friend's older brother grabbed his father's camera and we walked to thecrash-site. An elementary school's mobile classrooms are now where the craftwas, but at the time I believe there was a small baseball field near it. A few other neighbors had arrived and we were all speculating on it being anAir Force 'toy' that had gotten out of control. An Air Force car and one truckarrived within 15 minutes. The truck had about five men in it with rifles. Anofficer got out of the car and told his men to move us back away from thecraft. He saw that Dalton, my friend's brother, was taking pictures andgrabbed the camera, threw it to the ground and broke it. (He never tried toremove the film.) Dalton yelled and argued with the officer, but we were toldto leave, ignoring Dalton and his threats. About that time, other trucks arrived- one with men aboard; another with a trailer on the back and a third one witha small crane. The officer told us that we had to leave or be arrested. But we moved onlyacross the street at first. We watched while the men attached a large canvas tothe craft and lifted it by attaching cables to metal hooks that were on thecanvas. After the craft was loaded, they all left. There was no mention of theincident in the newspapers. As for the craft itself, we searched for markings but found only some oldscratches that we could not read. Because it was upright, we couldn't see thebottom. There were no windows or seams, appearing to be made from aone-piece mold. If I remember correctly, it was a dark grayish color withgreenish highlights - no a color one normally sees. The texture was quitesmooth. There was a mild heat coming from the craft somewhat like a carengine after traveling for an hour. One more thing I thought was strange: therewas no dust that clung to the shell. Here in the desert, dust is everywhere andclings to everything. Because we were only 15 miles from Edward's AFB and the speed in whichthe first car and truck arrived, I believe the craft was being tracked and theyknew exactly where to find it. Also, I believe that when the officer brokeDalton's camera, it was to draw attention to himself instead of the craft.Otherwise, he could have taken the camera ... The size of the craft ... 5 feethigh and 10 feet wide -- are estimates from a fourteen year old's memories,but I think they are pretty close.'"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" My follow up phone call to Debby revealed a few more details. She recalled that theobject appeared to fall straight down from the sky and that it was not a speedydescent and that it landed (or crashed) in a perfect upright position - no tilt. She alsorecalled that the tumbleweeds surrounding the object appeared to be darkened as ifburnt or singed, but she saw no fire. And she clearly recalls the soldiers busilyshoveling soil at the site, and the next day there was no trace of a depression causedby the craft. I asked bout physical effects. Only Dalton complained, she said, anddescribed the terrible pain he endured later that night in his arm from wrist to elbow.My guess here is that the culprit was the officer who got carried away in grabbingthe camera. No wonder Dalton 'yelled and argued' as Debby explained in her letter. But, the real mystery is the object's identity. A U. S. secret 'toy,' as Debbyspeculated, or another errant craft similar to the one that descended into Kecksburgin 1965? There are parallels; except in the Edwards' incident, there were no signs ofradiation and no protective clothing observed to be worn by the retrievers. Also,there was no ambulance on the scene in event of casualties or ejected occupants -unless the retrievers knew that they were safely at rest in suspended animation. MORE NEWS AND VIEWS: UFO CRASHES, MJ-12 AND THE ROLE OFDR. ERIC WALKER I am pleased to have a personalized statement by T. Scott Crain of Port Matilda,Pennsylvania, who - with co-author Grant Cameron of Winnipeg, Canada - releasedtheir book, UFOs, MU-12 and the Government, published by MUFON in May 1991.Knowing them mainly by correspondence and by phone, they have responsiblytracked down early year UFO crashes and specifically, a scientific source, Dr. EricWalker, who they had reasons to believe had MJ-12 connections and was involvedin crash/retrieval operations. His letter dated May 14, 1991, follows:Grant Cameron: 'Shortly after the release of the Operation Majestic 12Briefing Document at the 1987 Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) symposiumheld in Washington, D. C., Manitoba, Canada UFO investigator, GrantCameron, and Pennsylvania State Section Director for MUFON, T. ScottCrain, Jr., joined forces to search for government personnel who hadknowledge about the government's handling of alleged UFO crashes. IfMajestic-Twelve represented a real group of 12 scientists, military andintelligence officials to oversee the U. S. Government's program to recovercrashed UFOs, we reasoned that there should be former government officialswho are cognizant of the committee's existence. According to the Briefing Document, it was prepared for President-electDwight D. Eisenhower in November 1952. MJ-12 was allegedly established inSeptember 1947, as a Research and Development (R&D) intelligenceoperation responsible directly to the President. Since the team was allegedlyestablished in 1947 and was still active in 1952, we began searching forformer members of the R&D board, active during that time-frame, who mightknow something about the MJ-12 committee. We were already aware of one former R&D board member whoacknowledged the government was actively participating in UFO recoveries.Dr. Robert Sarbacher, who was on the Missile Committee in the 1950s, saidhe was invited to attend discussions about the recoveries at Wright-PattersonAir Force Base. He wasn't able to attend, but he states in a 1983 letter toCalifornia UFO researcher William Steinman, that the material in the flyingsaucer crashes was very light and tough and the 'aliens' recovered looked likecertain insects observed on Earth. (Ants? Praying Mantis? Other?) Sarbacher was instrumental in leading UFO researchers like nuclear physicist,Stanton Friedman, and William Steinman to another R&D board member, who"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"he claimed attended all the discussions at Wright-Patterson AFB. His namewas Dr. Eric A. Walker. Walker was Executive Secretary of the U. S.government's R&D board in the early 1950s, and later he became President ofthe Pennsylvania State University. Dr. Walker was one of six individualsnamed by Fred Darwin, former head of the Missile Committee of the R&Dboard, who he believed would be involved in a UFO recovery operation, 'ifthere ever was such a happening.' Steinman claims he called Walker on August 30, 1987. During theconversation, Walker allegedly admitted attending those UFO recoverymeetings, new of MJ-12 since its inception in 1947, and had in his possessionnotes of those meetings he attended in his files. According to Steinman,Walker discouraged him from pursuing this matter because he was '...delvinginto an area that you can do absolutely nothing about.' Subsequentconversations between Walker and a number of other UFO researcherslooking for more information, has yielded mixed results. The most interestingdata was obtained by Armenian physicist, Dr. Henry Azadehdel, who phonedWalker several times from England. During a conversation on March 8, 1990, Azadehdel claims Walker describedthe MJ-12 committee as a 'handful of elite' and that he was sent a copy of theBriefing Document in 1987 by Steinman. When asked by Azadehdel if hethought it was authentic, Walker allegedly said, 'I don't think so.' According toAzadehdel, when he asked Walker if he was ever a member of MJ-12, Walkeranswered, 'I cannot answer that.' Walker would not say whether or not theMJ-12 group was still active, Azadehdel said, and Walker reportedly indicatedit has been some time since he had anything to do with them. To our knowledge, this is the first time a scientist with impeccable credentialshas admitted that Majestic-Twelve is real. If the telephone notes we havecollected from researchers who have interviewed Walker are correct, then theU. S. government has done a splendid job of keeping this committee a secret. Cameron and Crain researched the Walker connection from 1987 to 1990, andhave put the results of our investigation into the book, UFOs, MJ-12 and theGovernment, published in May 1991 by the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON).' THE 'HENRY' AND ERIC DIALOGUE, SUBJECT: KECKSBURG On June 2, 1991, I got a phone call from Armen Victorian (formerly known as HenryAzadehdel) who said he had important news about Walker's link to the Kecksburgincident during an interview with him on May 30, 1991. On June 3, I received a faxcopy of the interview as follows:'AV: Doctor, I want to ask you about something that might not have anythingto do with the UFOs. Would you mind me asking you? EW: What is that? AV : Doctor, it is about an incident which happened in the mid-1960s. To beprecise, on December 9, 1965, in Kecksburg, Pennsylvania. It was - one couldsay - almost in your back garden. Could you tell me something about it? EW: What about it? AV : Well, what did you find out about it? EW: You still have not given up?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"AV : Doctor, you would say I am like a turtle - you turn me over to get rid ofme, and I struggle for awhile in my shell and eventually get back on my legs. EW: Well, we went there. AV : With the military? EW: You see, two were from the military, but not on duty. AV : How about the others? EW: He was a fellow colleague of mine. (Len's note: Who was the secondmilitary person?) AV : What did you find? Was it a - I know you are not going to like the word,but - was it a UFO? EW: I cannot comment on that. I cannot tell you. AV : Were you there for long? EW: Why? AV : Well, curiosity. I thought maybe there was a purpose in the sense of -maybe preparing a report or taking some notes. EW: We did not prepare any reports. AV : Well, doctor, apart from everything, how are you nowadays? EW: I am fine.' Comments by Henry Azadehdel, also known as Armen Victorian: 'Based upon my previous conversations with him (Eric Walker), I would sayhe has not changed at all. He did not give any solid piece of information toconfirm the fact that a UFO did come down in Kecksburg. ...I could say that itwas his way of telling me, without putting himself into any jeopardy. I believe that Walker was at the Kecksburg site as admitted which furthersuggests that the incident was important enough to require his presence. I alsobelieve that his visit was not during the retrieval operation when a largecontingent of military personnel were present. Probably, his 'inspection' withtwo military colleagues came later.' KECKSBURG UPDATE: STAN GORDON Following is a statement by Stan Gordon which I received in April 1991, updatingthe Kecksburg Affair.Stan Gordon: 'What was the object that slowly dropped from the sky into awooded area near the village of Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, late on theafternoon of December 9, 1965, that apparently caused military units toquickly respond to that site? This is only one question among many others thathave surfaced since the 25-year-old mystery occurred. While some wish todeny that anything happened that day, many dozens of people have surfacedover the years who had some part to play in the Kecksburg UFO incident. Anumber of these people have now gone on public record, but as in so manysimilar incidents, quite a lot of those involved wish to remain anonymous."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" At this time, many leads are being pursued, and other new sources ofinformation on the case are being interviewed. A detailed study is beingconducted into technical and scientific data associated with space probeexperimentation during the 1960s, conducted by the United States and otherforeign countries. Before we can claim the Kecksburg object was somethingextraterrestrial, we must first rule out any man-made devices. Severalwitnesses who saw the object making a slow descent towards the Kecksburgarea independently described the object hovering for a period of time beforeslowly descending towards the wooded area. These reports seem to indicatethat the object, whatever it was, had some control and did not crash as theterm might indicate. There apparently was little structural damage to theobject and no fire or major damage at the site. Even though some arearesidents heard a loud explosive sound about the time of the occurrence,m anumber of people who actually saw the object fall into the woods followed byblue smoke rising and quickly dissipating, said that there was no sound at themoment of impact. As investigation has progressed on the case over the years, rumors going backto 1965 that the government tried to cover up the events concerning theKecksburg incident have surfaced. Recent information now seems to supportthose claims Some new information on the event includes the following: A week after the Kecksburg UFO incident, now deceased News Director ofWHJB Radio in Greensburg, John Murphy, along with other staff members,prepared a documentary on the event called Object in the Woods. At thebeginning of the broadcast, it was noted that some witnesses, who had beenpreviously taped and interviewed for this special, had notified the station thatthey wished their voices not to be aired due to fear of getting in trouble withthe U. S. Army or the State Police. Sections of the radio special had to be'censored' to comply with the witnesses' requests. One staff member whoworked at the station at the time has given us a notarized statement that sherecalls 'the government confiscating news tapes of eyewitness accounts andnot being allowed to broadcast said tapes.' A medical doctor has given us a written statement that after the Kecksburgincident occurred, a close associate of his who was an ophthalmologist, toldhim in the strictest confidence that severalAir Force officers had brought a young man to be examined at a Pittsburgharea clinic. 'Dr. --- said the young man had observed a flaming object nearKecksburg.' The heat from the object had turned the patient's corneas totallywhite and opaque from the normal window glass clear state. The doctor closedhis statement with the following comment, 'I am sorry that I do not have moreinformation, but I am certain this was a military investigation of a highlyclassified nature associated with the Kecksburg sightings.' Many more important details have come to our attention. As more informationis gathered and time permits, update reports on our findings will be released. Itis our hope that some day a governmental inquiry will be held on theKecksburg incident. This would likely have to be a closed door session, so thatcivilian observers who wish no publicity can talk freely, and militarypersonnel who might have taken a security oath will be able to discuss theirknowledge of the events without possible repercussions.' Len Stringfield: Stan Gordon and I met privately at the MUFON Symposium inChicago on July 6, 1991. We discussed several sensitive 'backup' events concerningthe case which we agreed should remain confidential at this phase of investigation.\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Continued in Part 15 - More Crash Retrievals of Unidentified CraftCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
