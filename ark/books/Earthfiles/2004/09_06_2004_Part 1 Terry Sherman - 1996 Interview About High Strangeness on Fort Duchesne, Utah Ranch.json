Duchesne, Utah, is the 480-acre ranch owned by Terry and Gwen Sherman from 1994 to 1996and now owned by the National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS). September 6, 2004 Fort Duchesne, Uintah County, Utah - In June 1996 when I wasreporting about the unidentified bismuth and magnesium layered metal that allegedly camefrom bottom of a wedge-shaped craft in 1947 at White Sands Missile Range (See 03-26-04Earthfiles), I received a call from longtime Utah Bigfoot, crop circles and UFO researcher,Ryan Layton. He wanted me to interview a rancher named Terry Sherman. Two yearsbefore in 1994, Terry and his wife, Gwen, had moved to a 480-acre cattle ranch in centralUtah south of Fort Duchesne after the owners passed away. It was not long before theShermans noticed circles in their pasture grass and cattle missing and mutilated at the sametime that unidentified aerial objects showed up. After two years of high strangeness, theShermans wanted to move again - away from the ranch. Here for the first time at Earthfilesare several excerpts from my June 30, 1996, interview that was broadcast on Dreamlandwith Art Bell. Interview: Terry Sherman, Rancher, Fort Duchesne, Uintah County, Utah: \"In the beginning, wesaw circles in the field before we had even purchased the property. That would be the firstthings we noticed, but paid no heed to them and just thought the grass had died there.THAT WAS IN 1994?Ye s .WHAT KIND OF GRASS?Just pasture grass, most of it.SO THE GRASS IS DEAD IN A CIRCLE AND YOU SEE SOIL?It will be dry and you can set it afire where it was green the day before. It will burn, but itdoes not kill the roots, so whatever makes the rings is not hot enough to kill the grass roots.It does come back.SO YOU PURCHASED THE LAND. WHAT WAS THE FIRST DRAMATIC SIGHTINGOR ENCOUNTER?The first year we were here around April 15, 1994, I believe.WHAT HAPPENED? Unidentified, Silent \"Box-Shaped\" Aerial ObjectWe were calving cows and if you've ever been around that sort of thing, you know you'reup all night watching the cattle in case they have trouble. We were watching a particularanimal and while she was in the process of calving, we noticed a light at the bottom of the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"next field from the ranch house. We thought it was an RV of some kind. It was small with afront headlight and we just assumed it was an RV, of someone else or our neighbor has aJohn Deere which is a little 4-wheeler. We thought it was him and maybe his cattle hadgotten out of something. After the cow gave birth to her calf, we walked down there in thedark. We thought if it was him, it was kind of a joke, you know. We walked down thereand when we got within 100 yards of it, it proceeded to move away. We could never hearany sound coming from it and it went some distance across very wet ground. It had reallybeen storming about that time and went for several hundred yards ahead of us and thenwent over some trees.WHAT DID IT LOOK LIKE SPECIFICALLY?Just guessing back to the time, we'd say it was maybe 8 feet long, 6 feet wide and maybe 6feet tall.WAS THIS THE RECTANGULAR-SHAPED OBJECT?No, it was almost like a square, slightly smaller at the top than bottom, but pretty wellsquared like a box.OK, SO THIS IS THE MOVING BOX.Ye s .THE MOVING BOX WAS THE FIRST THING YOU SAW AND AS IT MOVED, WASTHERE A BEAM OR LIGHT COMING OUT OF THAT BOX AT ALL TIMES?Not at all times, but part of the time.THE LIGHT THAT CAME OUT OF THE BOX, WHAT WAS THE COLOR ANDDIMENSIONS?The best I can explain it was that it looked more like sunlight than light. It would projectout in front of it like you would project a spotlight, but it was more like sunlight where itwas shining. It was illuminating everything just like daylight, but it was night and youcouldn't really see the beam projecting from the craft out to where it was illuminating.SO WHAT YOU ARE SEEING WAS AS IF YOU WERE LOOKING AT A SECTION OFGROUND THAT LOOKED LIKE THE SUN SHINING ON IT, EXCEPT ALL AROUNDIT WAS DARKNESS?Ye s .AND IN THAT SUNSHINE PART, HOW WIDE WAS THAT BEAM?It seemed to adjust all the way down to a handheld light and up to a very large area.LIKE?Several times it changed while we were watching the cow. We noticed that. We thoughtthat was really odd. We thought at the time that maybe the neighbor had a big handheldspotlight or whoever was on the supposed RV.WHEN YOU SAW THIS BEAM, DID IT WIDEN OUT 15 FEET? 20 FEET?I'd say at the most maybe 20 to 25 feet.DOWN TO SOMETHING NO BROADER THAN THE WIDTH OF A HAND?No, I wouldn't say something that small. I'd say like a handheld flashlight.IN THAT BEAM, WERE COWS WHAT THE LIGHT SEEMED TO BE FOCUSED ON?No, there were no cattle in the area where they were. The cattle were in another field upfrom there and at the time as we got closer, we thought that someone was poaching deer ordoing something illegal. They shut their lights off like they was set, or gave that impression.We really did not see them fix the beam on anything, on any particular thing for any lengthof time.WHEN YOU SAW THAT IT WAS BOX-SHAPED, WHAT WENT THROUGH YOURMIND?We were trying to figure out what it was. We had never seen anything quite like it and as itbegan to move, we noticed there was no sound. Then we also noticed it was not leavingany tracks after a substantial distance. We followed it for probably 200 to 300 yards beforewe noticed that it was not leaving tracks."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"BECAUSE YOU COULD SEE WITH FLASHLIGHTS?No, we were walking along in the dark just following it.HOW COULD YOU SEE THE GROUND?We had a flashlight that we turned on to look to try to follow where it had went after it wasgone.THAT'S WHAT I MEANT. YOU WERE TRYING TO FOLLOW ON THE GROUNDWITH A FLASHLIGHT.But we followed it without flashlights for quite awhile. We walked down there withoutflashlights going so we could get up close and see what they were doing.AND THAT WHOLE TIME?We were going to scare whoever it was if it was not our neighbor.BUT THIS THING WAS IN THE AIR, CORRECT?Correct.AT WHAT POINT DID YOU REALIZE THAT THIS WAS NO LONGER ARECREATIONAL VEHICLE?It kind of sunk in at first, but not really. You don't have the time to really analyze what youare seeing. And it was completely dark. It was a really black night. But it went across thetop of several barbed wire fences and at first I thought they had drove through a barbedwire fence and mentioned to my nephew who was with me, 'They drove right through abarbed wire fence!' Figuring out whether they were 2 feet off the ground, 4 feet off or 6feet off the ground I was assuming at the time that they were on the ground. So, I thoughtthey drove right through a barbed wire fence.YOU STARTED FOLLOWING THROUGH THE PASTURE AND GOT TO THEBARBED WIRE FENCE AND WHAT DID YOU FIND?That the fence was untouched.UNTOUCHED. THAT MEANT THAT WHATEVER IT WAS HAD TO BE IN THE AIRABOVE THE BARBED WIRE.Yes and shortly after that within 20 or 30 seconds, it had gone across the field, picked up alittle more speed I'd say to maybe 30 mph and then went over some poplar trees that are 30to 40 feet tall. At that time, we saw the craft suspended in the air and that's the time we gotthe best definition of size and shape against the skyline.ABOVE THE TREES.Right.AT THAT POINT, YOU ESTIMATED THE MEASUREMENT WAS WHAT?Maybe just purely a guess but maybe 8 feet long, 6 feet wide and 6 feet all maybe.SORT OF A SMALL BOX IN COMPARISON TO AVIATION VEHICLES?Ye s .WAS THE ONLY LIGHT THAT EMANATED FROM THAT JUST THE BEAM OFLIGHT THAT LOOKED LIKE SUNSHINE ON THE GROUND?No, it wasn't. On the back of the vehicle, there was a round area in the middle of the backof the vehicle it was not really a light, but it would turn rosy colored. It was not bright byany means, but just a real dull rosy light color from time to time.OK, THAT'S ON THE BACK. AND THE SUNSHINE BEAM IS GOING FROM THEFRONT?Ye s .THE DIRECTION IN WHICH IT WAS TRAVELING.Right."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"AS IT MOVED, DID YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHAT THE BEAM MIGHT BELOOKING FOR OR EXPLORING KNOWING THAT PART OF YOUR RANCH?Once they started moving away from us, I felt sure they spotted us and were just movingaway.YOU'VE ALSO GOT DISAPPEARING ANIMALS WHICH IS ANOTHER ASPECT OFTHIS PHENOMENON.We feel the only animals we've found are where we interrupted them somewhere in theprocess. Every time we've had a mutilation, we've seen craft without exception.WHICH KIND OF CRAFT?We have seen the box shape. Another Flying \"Box\"THAT WAS APRIL, MAYBE A YEAR AGO OR TWO. WHAT WAS THE NEXTASSOCIATION OF THIS BOX WITH WHAT I UNDERSTAND WAS A MUCH LARGERCRAFT?We've never seen the box in relationship to any other craft particularly.HAVE YOU SEEN THE BOX MORE THAN ONCE, THOUGH?Ye s .WHEN THE BOX IS THERE, DOES IT ALWAYS SEEM TO BE SEARCHING FORSOMETHING?My wife and I saw it once. It came up in the air behind us just a little while after sunset.We heard something behind us. We had been in the fields irrigating and we turned aroundand it came up to 100 to 200 yards behind us. It came up and was skylighted again for justa small, maybe 3 or 4 seconds.WAS THIS DARK OR LIGHT, MEANING WAS IT DAY OR NIGHT WHEN THISOCCURRED?The time we saw it was around midnight, my nephew and I, when we followed it throughthe fields. The time my wife and I saw it was maybe 30 minutes after sundown there wasstill light in the sky.SO YOU COULD SEE IT SILHOUETTED IN THE SKY?Ye s .THE SHAPE WAS STILL CLEARLY THAT BOX?Ye s .DID IT HAVE THAT SUNSHINE BEAM COMING OUT OF IT?No.JUST A MOVING BOX?Ye s .WHEN IT DISAPPEARED THAT SECOND TIME, HOW DID IT DISAPPEAR?It just propelled itself along maybe 12 to 15 feet above a road that goes down there. Theway the terrain goes, it went a short distance and then was out of line of view where wecould not see it. Another Larger Unidentified Aerial ObjectWHAT WAS ANOTHER IMPRESSIVE EVENT?We've seen a bigger craft. We've seen one that has four holes, doors, lights whatever you"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"want to call them. We thought for a long time, they were just lights. But after looking withbinoculars at a very short distance, you can see depth and see into the holes.YOU CAN SEE INTO THE HOLES?Ye s .THE COLOR IN THE HOLES IS WHAT?It looks to be just lights kind of an auburn to orange, maybe.IS THE WHOLE OBJECT GLOWING AN AUBURN ORANGE? OR IS IT JUST THELIGHT INSIDE THE HOLES THAT COLOR?Just the light that's inside the holes and when the doors are shut - or holes or whatever youwant to call them you can see a spiral covering that comes over them. It spirals open andspirals shut. When the doors are shut, we can see nothing. I know that sounds bizarre, butthat's how it is.THIS IS LOOKING THROUGH BINOCULARS?I've looked at it with a 40X spotting scope. I've looked at it with 15X binoculars.THIS IS WHEN THE OBJECT WAS STATIONARY IN FRONT OF YOU AT ABOUTHOW FAR DISTANCE?Closest I've been to it is about 400 to 500 yards.CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE EVENT WHAT WERE YOU DOING AND WHATHAPPENED WHEN YOU WERE 400 TO 500 YARDS AWAY?What had happened is that my wife had come home before me and she said she saw a craftfly over her car and come down by our house and went up over some cottonwood treesthat are here and then up over a big ridge that is behind the house. We were talking aboutthat and we noticed one of these large lights or holes or whatever open up down in thefield, down below our house in the cattle pasture. We started watching them. There is somestuff outside my house that we use for a spotting scope to look for cattle or whatever. Weset it up and watched it for quite a period of time.There are four windows. We've videotaped them. We've seen them many times. They stayin respect to each other, they never move. We had some real good video of it and we tookit to a guy and he said it was destroyed and we lost it.WHO DID YOU TAKE IT TO?Just a guy who had a computer with an imaging system that he could blow it up or makestill shots or anything out of your videotape. I told him I don't want to get into it. I have noproof because I gave it to him. I never got a receipt. He just said he would see what hecould do with them. I just got the feeling he was lying to me. He seemed real nervous aboutit and reluctant to talk to me. I don't really know what his story is.DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE VIDEOTAPE THAT SHOWS THE SPIRALING OPENINGOF THE HOLES?We have some that was taken from a much greater distance and by a kid who had neverrun a camera before and it's not nearly as good. But putting on the right equipment, it mightshow more.HOW FREQUENTLY ARE THEY COMING AROUND YOUR PLACE?Oh, we won't see them for three or four months and then we'll see a large barrage ofdifferent things and then gone again.WHEN WAS THE LAST BARRAGE?We had a storm of them here about two months ago.WE ARE NOW AT THE END OF JUNE (1996) ARE YOU EXPECTING THEM TO BEBACK IN JULY OR AUGUST?There is no way to tell. That's part of the problem of getting any videotape. You can be outirrigating in the middle of the night or moving cows and you see something and it lasts forminutes or seconds or longer length of time, but it's hard to be prepared at all times."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Smaller \"Box\" Craft Going In and Out of Larger CraftBut the main thing I think is that all of it is connected in my mind. On the one videotapewe lost, we saw a craft coming in and out of the orange hole that I was talking about.That's when we took on a whole new way of thinking. You could see it flying in and out ofthe openings.THE OBJECT THAT HAS THE OPENINGS IN IT HOW BIG IS THAT OBJECT YOUHAVE SEEN THINGS FLY IN AND OUT OF?The holes in it are big enough to see the craft we've seen. We guess the craft at maybe 40feet wide. At 400 to 500 yards, it's spectacular. It's quite enormous. We figured after wesaw it above a field on the ranch that it appeared to be centered over that field and wetried to guess by measuring up the field. It's about 100 yards wide and about 300 yardslong. That's the only real thing we've had to try to figure out how large it is.IT APPEARED TO COVER MOST OF THAT SIZE?Covered all you see is just those four openings and when they close an opening, you cansee nothing. You see the trees behind them or stars behind it or whatever is behind it. Youmight go a few minutes or seconds and they might have all four open or two open or oneopen or none open.ON THE VIDEOTAPE, YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE A MECHANICAL OBJECT OFSOME SORT SPIRALING OVER THOSE ORANGE GLOWING WINDOWS ORHOLES OR WHATEVER?The craft we've seen is not a dome or a dish. It's more like a craft with wings. It's more likean enlarged,, over-sized totally different kind of a craft.WHAT SHAPE?It's kind of rectangular in the back, similar to the little box-shaped craft, except it seems tohave large protrusions off the corners like wings. But much larger.SO YOU ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT ANYTHING THAT IS ROUND?No.YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ANYTHING THAT IS DIAMOND-SHAPED?We've seen something that is diamond-shaped, but it was a light. Above this ridge here onenight, we were sitting there in fact, that was the same night that we saw a large diamond-shaped light emitting kind of a red... I don't even know how to describe it. We just sat andlooked at it it was just kind of a big, wide, wandering I wouldn't say a 'beam.' I don't reallyknow how to describe it. It's like water running in every direction down to the ridge, but itwas diamond-shaped.HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A BOOMERANG-SHAPED OBJECT?If you look at the back of these craft, it kind of gives that effect.AT THE BACK, IT LOOKS LIKE A BOOMERANG.Well, you've got those wings kind of coming off the bottom, if they are wings or whateverthey are.WHAT ABOUT TRIANGLE-SHAPED?I think in the front, the craft kind of pinches down to smaller than it is in the back. It seemsmuch wider in the back than it does in the front.BUT BASICALLY, YOU'VE GOT A VERY LARGE CRAFT THAT MIGHT BE UP TO900 YARDS OR SO IN DIAMETER THAT IS BOX-SHAPED SORT OF?No, the lights and the craft are three different distinct things we've seen. The craft I'mtalking about, the doors or windows or holes or lights I can never see anything that has anystructure around them.ALL YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT YOU ARE INFERRING THAT BECAUSE THEYDON'T MOVE IN RELATIONSHIP TO EACH OTHER AND YOU'VE SEEN THINGSFLY IN AND OUT OF THEM, THAT THEY MUST BE ATTACHED TO A LARGERSTRUCTURE?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"We thought that in the beginning.BUT YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THE WHOLE SHAPE OF WHAT THESE FOUR AREAT TA C H E D T O ?I've never seen a ship associated with the four openings, ever. We have seen a craft I wasdescribing a minute ago fly in and out of those holes.WHICH WAS BOX-LIKE?It's narrower at the top than the bottom. It would be like drawing a square and tucking it inat the top to about half the width it is at the bottom and elongating it. It's maybe justguessing 10 to 12 feet thick, 40 feet wide, and longer than it is wide.SO WHATEVER THE OBJECT IS WITH THE FOUR ORANGE HOLES HAS TO BELARGE ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE SOMETHING AT LEAST 40 FEET LONGENTERING IT. AND YOU WERE RUNNING A VIDEOTAPE CAMERA ON THISOBJECT WHEN ONE OF THESE SLIGHTLY COMPRESSED BOXES WENT INTOONE OF THE ORANGE HOLES YOU WERE RUNNING A VIDEOTAPE AND YOUSAW SOME KIND OF A CLOSURE SPIRAL DOWN OVER THAT HOLE WHEN THEOBJECT WENT IN?Most of the time, they will be standing wide open when the craft make their approach.We've seen them come in at a very slow speed, maybe 10 to 15 mph to a very high speed,I'd say over 100 mph when they go through the hole.HOW MANY AT ONE TIME HAVE YOU SEEN ENTER THE LARGE OBJECT? HAVETHERE BEEN SEVERAL AT ONE TIME?We've seen as many as three outside of the object at once.ENTER IT?We've seen them come in and out, three outside at a time. Moving Cattle To Prevent MutilationsON THAT NIGHT WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN THESE OBJECTS ENTER AND EXIT,HAVE YOU ALSO HAD MUTILATIONS THAT SAME NIGHT OR FOUND THE NEXTMORNING?As bizarre as this sounds, it almost always occurs on the darkest night of the month. Andon the night of all the activity, we've had cattle mutilations before and after. We've got tothe point, we just immediately get horses and gather the cattle up. We've had twice cattlehave disappeared a day apart. The day we see them the most active, we haven't had amutilation on that specific day. But we've had them on the day before and after.BY 'THEY,' YOU MEAN THE CRAFT IN THE AIR?Ye s .NOW, WHEN YOU SEE ANY OF THESE CRAFT IN YOUR SKY, YOU ARESENDING PEOPLE OUT TO ROUND UP YOUR CATTLE?We do it ourselves. We just move them.WHEN YOU MOVE THE CATTLE, IS IT AFTER YOU HAVE MOVED THE CATTLETHAT YOU HAVE HAD THEM DISAPPEAR FROM WHERE THEY HAVE BEENMOVED?No, if we get the cattle up by the house, there's about a 50 acre field up here by the house.We move the cattle into there and we've never lost anything out of that field.CLOSE TO YOUR HOUSE.Ye s .WHEN HAVE YOU NOTICED YOU HAVE HAD DISAPPEARING ANIMALS?I can't recall the time exactly. It's been not too long after we've been here, we had cattlemissing. And we rode and tracked and tried to find them and never could find them."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"HOW MANY ALTOGETHER?We've had seven that we really documented as being gone and we felt something happenedother than normal.SO SEVEN ANIMALS DISAPPEARED? HOW MANY MUTILATED?Three. (Seven more cattle mutilations would occur after this June 1996 interview.)WHEN DID THE THREE MUTILATIONS OCCUR?I can't tell you exact times. One was in September and another was just before Christmas.EACH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRESENCE OF THESE CRAFT IN YOUR AIRTHEN?Yes, we felt like they were, absolutely.\" Continued in Part 2 - Pod Marks Formed Triangular Pattern in PastureWebsite:http://www.nidsci.org/Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
