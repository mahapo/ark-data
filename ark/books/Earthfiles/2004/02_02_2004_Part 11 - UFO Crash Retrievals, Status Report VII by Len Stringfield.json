Roswell Crash/Retrieval Update UFO debunkers have had, and will continue to have, a hard time shootingdown the 1947 Roswell crash/retrieval case. They would have to makeliars out of the hundreds of firsthand and support witnesses who haveemerged to tell about their roles in the case. I am pleased that I had the opportunity to talk with the former 509thBomb Wing intelligence officer, the late Jesse Marcel on three occasions -the first on April 7, 1978, and twice again later, before his passing. Hisfirsthand account of his retrieval task, backs up the testimony he hadrelated to Stan Friedman. It was Marcel who broke the silence aboutRoswell which opened the floodgates. New firsthand information about Roswell strengthens the case even more.This will be released in a newly published hardcover book in the Spring of1994, authored by Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt. Following is astatement about some of the disclosures, received from Randle, datedNovember 1993:\"The last two years have been extraordinary in the search foradditional information about the Roswell UFO crash. Many newimportant firsthand witnesses of the craft and the bodies, includingboth military and civilian, have been located and interviewed. The search for the archaeologists, at least in one aspect, ended whenwe - with the assistance of Tom Carey - located the leader of theexpedition. In an interview conducted just weeks before he died, heconfirmed that he had been there and he had seen it all. Interestingly,he said that he had been just north of Roswell and not on the Plainsof San Augustin in western New Mexico. Another scientist, avertebra paleontologist, told us that he had seen the military cordonthrown up just off Highway 285 north out of Roswell. All the nameswill appear in our hardcover book, The Truth About the UFO Crashat Roswell, available early in 1994. Skeptics have often said that Roswell was a balloon and they say that"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"no on e saw the object in the sky. Because of that, the balloonexplanation makes some sense, at least to them. We have found,however, a number of people who saw the object fall to the ground. Eyewitnesses Watch UFO Fall Outof Sky Near Roswell in 1947 These (eyewitnesses) include William Woody, an eleven-year-old boyin 1947, who said he saw a falling star that took a long time to fall.The next day, he and his father tried to locate the object, but wereturned back by the military. His story fits into the new scenario we'vedeveloped based on the firsthand testimony. Corporal E. L. Pyles, stationed at Roswell in 1947, also saw theobject crash. Although at a radio facility 15 miles southwest ofRoswell, he told of seeing a shooting star fall north of the town.Pyles, along with Woody and three others, have been able tocorroborate the exact date of the crash: July 4, 1947. Other aspects of the case have not progressed as well. The story toldby Gerald Anderson, who claimed that as a five-year-old child he hadseen the crashed saucer and dead, dying and uninjured alien pilots,collapsed when it was learned that he had lied about one aspect ofhis story and then created a forged document to prove his claims.Other supposed documentation, such as a diary allegedly created byUncle Ted Anderson, was written - not in 1947 - but sometime after1974 about ten years after Ted died. With the lies, forged documents,and failed corroboration, the Anderson testimonies should beeliminated from the files. MJ-12, or Operation Majestic Twelve, which seemed to verify theRoswell event has also collapsed. The fact that Rear AdmiralHillenkoetter's rank, as it appears on the document, is wrong suggestsit was created, not by Hillenkoetter or someone inside the military,but by a civilian without an understanding of proper militaryprotocol. Because Hillenkoetter is listed as the briefing officer, this isnot a mistake he would have overlooked. Those with militaryexperience understand this completely. Those who never servedbelieve it to be unimportant. But the real problem with MJ-12 is that it reflects the state of theRoswell investigation in the mid-1980s, rather than the truth. Forexample, the evidence now shows the recovery operation began onJuly 5, 1947, and not July 7, as the document claims. There were fivebodies recovered and not four. It would seem that a document that issupposed to have been written by those on the inside would havereflected the truth. (For a complete analysis of both Gerald Andersonand MJ-12, see the forthcoming book, History of UFO Crashes,available at the end of 1994.) The whole story of the Roswell crash, including the names of most ofthe firsthand witnesses who were on the impact site where the bodieswere found, will be included in our new book. One problem we hadwas the interference of third parties. One man interjected himself intothe Roswell case, questioned the integrity of one of our firsthandwitnesses, and caused the witness to withdraw his permission to usehis name. It should be pointed out that the information wascorroborated by at least four other sources. Roswell continues to be the best documented of the UFO crashstories. Questions that had lingered for years will soon be answered.And it is no longer necessary to rely on secondhand testimony. Wenow have firsthand sources who saw it all.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Kecksburg Crash/Retrieval Update (See Earthfiles 10/25/03) As with Roswell, a few vociferous, diehard debunkers, pick at Kecksburg.Ignoring a bedrock of correlative testimony by new and old witnesses, theygrasp for minor peripheral flaws in a witnesses' character or behaviorseeking out the guy who might claim he finally reached the crashed objecton this cold December night in 1965 after tripping in a patch of daisies andgetting stains on his Bermuda shorts. If no such silly anachronism can beexploited to discredit the case, the debunker might then try to negate theveracities of the dozens of witnesses or the reality of anonymous sources,hoping to create enough doubt about the event that the big media willshrug it off as too controversial. Having talked privately with Stan Gordon, the prime investigator into theKecksburg case, I know some of the details revealed by his anonymous andmilitary sources. I, too, have a firsthand informant, an involved businessman in the case who saw the bell-shaped object at Wright-Patterson AFB.Yes, something crashed at Kecksburg. Whether it is of extraterrestrialorigin, or Russian, or a NASA fluke, or launched by a Somalian warlord,the event remains TOP SECRET. \"Acorn-shaped\" UFO with strange symbols carved around its lower end wasdescribedby firemen who went to the crash scene. Object was a \"strange copper color.\"Drawingon December 9, 1993 by Rick Rieger for investigator, Stan Gordon. Stan Gordon, who extends investigative credits to Keith R. Bastianini andDennis Smeltzer, updates the case as follows:\"The Military Interest by Investigator Stan Gordon Since the publication of Stringfield's Status Report VI, I havecontinued to seek out and investigate information and locate peoplewho have knowledge of events concerning this important UFO casewhich occurred on December 9, 1965. This case regardless of thenature of the object involved, is important because it shows that ourmilitary already had in place a procedure to quickly respond tocrashes of aerial objects of undetermined origin. This continuoussearch for evidence has been exciting and yet very frustrating at times.There is no doubt in my mind that late on the afternoon of December9, 1965, an object plummeted from the sky into a wooded ravine nearthe village of Kecksburg in rural Westmoreland County,Pennsylvania. From the testimony of multiple observers within a relatively shorttime after impact, military personnel and equipment arrived on sceneand an operation was begun to locate, recover, and transport theobject from the site. It is quite apparent that the military"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"accomplished their mission quickly. According to news accounts andthose who were in the area that night, hundreds of people crowdedthe narrow winding road (now called Meteor Road in remembranceof the 1964 event) that bordered the wooded area where the objectwas said to have impacted on that day. In the last few years since theKecksburg case has become the subject of major TV and newscoverage, much controversy has erupted around Kecksburg withoutcries from a few of the remaining long time residents of the area,that the event is a hoax. Some claim that nothing happened at all thatnight, that nothing fell from the sky, and that few if any military typeswere even in the area. But numerous other Kecksburg residents from that time have comeforward, along with many outsiders, who found their way to thevillage that night after hearing news reports that a UFO had fallen inthe area and that the military was searching for it. These observershave recorded their testimonies and are willing to testify that militarypersonnel did conduct a mission in the area on that day. Theenclosed map (sketch by Charles M. Hanna) which shows some ofthe major landmarks pertaining to the event. A) is curve on Meteor Road where citizens watched; B) is Fire Hall; C) isHays family'srented farmhouse; D) military concentrated on private lane; E) UFO impactarea in ravine.Drawing by Charles M. Hanna, 1990, for Stan Gordon. The map attempts to indicate that from point (A) the curve on MeteorRoad where most people were lined up that night glimpsing downinto the woods, traveling down and around to the fire station and upthe road that connects to the private lane (D) where much of themilitary activity was taking place, is separated ;by quite a distance.Those people who were on Meteor Road could only see lights in thedistance, the actual impact area of the object was in fact not in thewoods near the road, but on the opposite side of the woods down inthe ravine (E). The Kecksburg Fire Station (B) was over the hill fromthe impact area. Observers, including some firemen, swear thatmilitary personnel, brought equipment into that building that nightand used it as a temporary command post. From all indications, mostof the military personnel and equipment involved with the actualsearch and recovery were located along the private lane (D). At theend of this lane and down into the field somewhat was the smallwhite farmhouse that was being rented by the Hays family at the time(C). Military Entered Hays Farm House"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" This family states that military personnel also came in and out oftheir home during the evening hours after the crash, using their phoneto make calls. This house was well isolated and close to the impactsite in the woods which was not that far away. While many of theroads around the village were closed that night to keep more peoplefrom entering, a number of observers did manage to find their wayonto that private lane where military equipment and personnel wereobserved. What is apparent is that some people that night were in theright place at the right time to observe certain activity. Others couldsee nothing from their vantage point. While the Army denies having any knowledge of having personnel orequipment involved in this event, detailed descriptions fromobservers - including former military people who were in the area ascivilians - strongly suggest that most of the military presence wasrepresented by the Army. Air Force personnel were also on thescene. Only a brief mention in the Air Force Project Blue Bookreport on the case confirms that a three man team from the 662ndRadar Squadron based in Pittsburgh were involved in theinvestigation. But there were indeed more than three military types in the area thatnight, according to those who watched. While thousands that daylikely saw the brilliant fireball in the sky, other residents closer toKecksburg could see in some case a more structured object thatseems to have displayed at least limited controlled re-entrycapability. Some who saw the object heading towards the impact siteindicate that the object was not moving that fast. Those who saw theobject impact into the woods said there was no sound of a crash, butmoments later a blue column of smoke rose from the spot andquickly dissipated.A young boy playing outside at the time caught the object for aninstant as it dropped in the woods ahead. He ran home to tell hismother and after she heard a radio report about the object being seenin the sky, she phoned radio station WHJB in Greensburg to reportthat the object had gone down in the Kecksburg woods. WHJB Radio Swamped with CallsAbout Fiery Object in Sky WHJB Radio was the area's major radio news source and the stationhad been swamped with calls from area residents reporting the fieryobject in the sky. Some had reported that what they had seen mighthave been an aircraft on fire. John Murphy, WHJB News Director atthe time, now deceased, was returning from investigating another areastory when he received a radio call about the object in the sky. Afterresponding to the vicinity of the reports and seeing nothing, hereturned to the station. Mable Mazza was the WHJB office managerat the time and she was helping to answer the numerous phone callsabout the sighting. When the call was received from the Kecksburgwoman about the object falling into the woods, Murphy took thecall. He obtained the information, contacted the Troop APennsylvania State Police Headquarters in Greensburg, and soon leftthe station to head for the site at Kecksburg. It is now apparent thatMurphy got to the scene quite awhile before the Pennsylvania StatePolice Fire Marshall and others, along with the woman and small boywho had reported the object to the station, arrived in the area. Military Asking for Directions to Kecksburg,Pennsylvania UFO Crash Site"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Back at the station, Mazza was having a hard time trying to keep upwith the continuing calls. It is from Mazza that we learn about themilitary interest as the event was unfolding. Mazza stated, 'The callscame in from all over the United States. Other radio stations, wireservices, government agencies and military asking for directions tothe site, and what I knew from the calls about it.' Mable also statedthat she had received calls from the Pentagon as well. Mazza went on to say that Murphy later called from the site and said,'Mable, we have a big one here. I will call you as soon as I can -probably by radio. So stick by it.' Mazza said that Murphy told herthat the military was there investigating and the security was tight. Inthe days after the event, Murphy along with other WHJB staffmembers put together a radio documentary called Object in theWoods. Interestingly, the broadcast had information contained withinit that had to be censored from what was originally recorded becauseas it states in the program, some individuals were afraid of troublefrom the Army or state police. Bonnie Millslagle, who was married to John Murphy at the time ofthe Kecksburg incident, has recently revealed more informationpertaining to her late husband's participation. Bonnie was in touch bytwo-way radio with Murphy from the scene that evening. Murphyalways carried a camera and tape recorder and a black notebook.(This seems evidence from the precise times of occurrencesmentioned on the radio documentary.) Murphy later told her that hehad time to get down into the woods and he himself had seen thestrange metallic object on the ground. Bonnie believes that Murphydid take some pictures there that night and feels that the military hadconfiscated the film from him. Bonnie also indicated that Murphywas very excited over this story, but not long after the radiodocumentary was aired he suddenly stopped talking about it. Bonniedoesn't know what happened, but from the tone of the conversations,it was implied that the government was behind it. In time, Murphydied out of state in what Bonnie feels was a suspicious hit and runaccident. Whether or not his tragic death had any association with hisinvolvement in the Kecksburg case will likely never be known. Kecksburg, PA Eyewitnesses Talk AboutDecember 9, 1965, UFO Crash and Military \"MartialLaw\" During the 1980s, a massive amount of new information has becomeknown to me about the Kecksburg case. After the story was aired onUnsolved Mysteries, and then by other TV and radio sources,newinformants who claim to have knowledge of the case began to showup from many areas of the country. Some of these were Pennsylvaniaresidents who had seen the object as it passed through the sky. Somewere people who had been to the site that night. Other local residentsbegan to come forward to verify that indeed something did happenthat night. Some informants were former military or governmentsources who claimed to have been involved with certain activityrelated to the sighting. As I stated earlier in this report, the search for evidence has beenexciting and very frustrating. While quite a number of eyewitnesseshave had the fortitude to go public with their personal accounts ofwhat occurred that day in 1965, many important sources have givenme their information. But for various reasons, they wish to remainanonymous. Many Kecksburg area residents don't want to getinvolved publicly because of the on-going debate between some local"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"folks. There are many other individuals that I know of who have briefly toldme of their participation that night, but have indicated 'that they don'twant to get involved.' Some anonymous sources, which appear tohave been of military origin, at times have provided some veryinteresting leads to follow. While my search goes on to find theevidence to unlock the secrets surrounding the Kecksburg case, Ihave located individuals whom I believe were involved in the militaryinvestigation at the site that night. Some of these people refuse totalk. Others have given only suggestions as to their involvement.Some important sources have already passed away. Other sourceshave told me of their concern if they reveal what they know about theincident. It has always been my position to protect confidentiality ofmy sources. In some cases, even revealing information about theiractivity without using their name could cause problems. There are many individuals unknown to each other over many yearswho have verified many details about the military operation atKecksburg that night. Once again, most of the military activity wastaking place along the private lane which was on the side of thewoods where the object had impacted. There was also militaryequipment and personnel observed around the Hay's home andfurther down in the fields near the impact site. One individual whowas considered a very credible witness (now deceased) provided mewith his detailed account as to what he saw on the lane that night. Hehad gotten out of the military prior to the Kecksburg event and hadworked in intelligence. He was very impressed with the militarypresence that night. He had arrived at the site sometime early eveningjust as some of the military was arriving. One of the first events herecalls that stuck in his mind was an Air Force officer that he believeswas a major, plus a state trooper, walking up from the direction of theimpact site towards a military car parked on the lane. He heard thetrooper say, 'I've never seen anything like that before.' He stated thatfrom their facial expressions, they were both significantly upset. Bothmen got in the back seat of the military car and were driven away.The witness observed various military vehicles including jeeps andtrucks. Of even more significance, he later sneaked down through the fieldstowards the impact site, very curious because he had seen brilliantblue flashes of light coming from that area. (Just after the objectimpacted that afternoon, numerous people saw unexplained bluelight from the impact area for some time.) As he got closer to theedge of the field towards the woods, he was stopped by armed Armypersonnel who had set up a security perimeter in the event thatanyone would try to approach the crash site. Other individuals haveprovided me with written statements that they also had creeped intothe woods to look for the object, but were stopped by military-typesand sent back. Another former Kecksburg resident, Robert Blystone, Jr., who wasyoung at the time recalls the events of that night clearly. Shortly afterthe object impacted, he went down the hill and he states that theArmy was everywhere. 'It was like in no time and the Army was there.Kecksburg was under martial law (witness interpretation). No one inand no one out. My mom and dad tried to get in, but they would notlet them in. So they called my grandpa and asked him to come upand see if we were OK and he did. I heard people saying we wereunder martial law. You could see the Army everywhere, the jeeps andtrucks and manpower.' Later that night, this witness and others saw alarge cab with flatbed trailer hauling away something from the area.\""},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"To be continued in Part 12.Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
