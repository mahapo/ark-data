The following continues the July 1993 Ohio UFO Notebook article about analleged Clovis, New Mexico UFO crash site in the late 1950s by William Jones,Director, Mid-Ohio Research Associates (M.O.R.A.) that was begun inEarthfiles, Part 7. \"M.O.R.A. Follow-Up Data from Ohio UFO Notebook July 1993 articleby William Jones According to Jake, he and his two friends had gotten into the area withoutbeing noticed. There were between 40 and 50 people in the area, sometaking notes and measurements. Fire trucks, pickup trucks, wreckers, andjeeps were parked near the road they came in on. Several 'four-by' coveredtrucks were parked near the object which was located down in a river bedarea. The object was sitting on the surface of the ground. It appeared thatthe object had come down, skipping over the surface of the ground beforesliding down into the river bed. A telephone pole, a fence row, and anumber of bushes and small trees had been knocked down. The object 'looked like a whale.' It was charcoal in color and it did notappear to be damaged, although he couldn't see what the bottom lookedlike. He viewed the object from what he concluded was its rear or tail-end.The object was perhaps thirty feet long. It had 'slits' along its sides. As theywere leaving the area, Jake picked up the small metallic pieces that weredescribed in the previous issue of the Notebook. According to Jake, he and his friends had returned to the Clovis area threeweeks later on U. S. Air Force business unrelated to their experience.While there, they had gone to a restaurant in a small town south of Clovisand entered into conversations with some civilians. One was a rancher whosaid that his cows were 'spooked' one night by a 'big object' that had landedon his property. The object had a glow to it. While he was watching, ittook off suddenly. It emitted no sound. It flew over a hill in the distance.There was a flash, then nothing. Two or three days later, the rancher heard that something strange hadcrashed in the area where the flash occurred, but he had heard no details.This area was near where Jake and his friends had seen their crashed objectand the rancher's sighting had occurred only a few days before Jake and hisfriends had their experience. Jake does not remember the name of therancher after all of these years. According to the rancher, other sightingswere reported in the area during this same time period, some of which werementioned in the local paper. A search for these articles is currentlyunderway in Clovis thanks to the efforts of Carolyn Duce-Ashe of NewMexico MUFON. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"There were sightings reported near Clovis at or near the time of the allegedcrash as noted in Thomas R. Adams' 1992 report entitled, Pardon theIntrusion or UFOs Over, On & Under (?) New Mexico. Mr. Adamsreceived personal communications which told of an October 23, 1957,UFO landing in the Clovis-Portales area; no other details are available.Also, on October 24, fifteen miles south of Cannon Air Force Base,multiple witnesses reported a daylight landing which left unspecified tracesbehind. The November 3, 1957, issue of the Medford (Oregon) MailTribune reported that a radio station owner had seen a streaking fireball onSaturday night, November 1, 19957. On Sunday, sightings and landings ofegg-shaped craft were reported just across the state-line in the area ofLovelland, Texas. It goes without saying that Jake's story rests solely upon his own testimony.So far, nothing that he has told us has been confirmed by any third partyor independent source. We want to place on record that Jake has showedus his United States Air Force Certificate of Appointment to the'permanent grade of Staff Sergeant' dated in 1959, and an Air Force AirTraining Command Certificate of Proficiency dated in 1956 recording thathe had successfully completed a course as an aircraft mechanic on aspecific engine-type for the F-80C aircraft.'\" Len Stringfield: We cannot dismiss the Clovis crashed object as an awkward U.S. space experiment or as a nondescript spaceship. If such a U. S. RubeGoldberg creation existed in 1957, or was developed long before or long afterSputnik, it probably was never duplicated - as I have never received anotherreport of that description. Impressed by the investigations of the Mid-Ohio Research Associates (MORA), Icalled Jake again on November 18, 1993, and leaving no stones unturned totrigger his recall into extraneous events, I managed to uncover a few more details- some significant. At first we tried to define its shape, comparing it to everything from a manta ray,a whale, a cigar with a radical swept-back wing and finally a submarine with aslender nose with an inflated mid-section. Jake said, \"For sure, it was not a U. S.aircraft, nor a modified cylindrical rocket fashioned after the German V-2. Butwhatever it was, it appeared to be a metallic, charcoal-colored vehicle heestimated to be 150 to 160 feet long. \"It's slender nose was slightly tilted up,\"Jake said, \"but I couldn't see its rear which had scraped a path of destruction forsome distance, knocking down trees, a telephone pole and disintegrating a hugeboulder before it got stuck in a deep ravine.\" Jake reaffirmed that he saw no ambulances on the scene, indicating the absenceof dead or injured crew members. On the other hand, he had no way of knowingthat one or more had been there during early retrieval operations. However, hedid recall that a bus was parked alongside the craft which could havesubstituted as a medical conveyance. Military Personnel On Scene Wore Asbestos and Silver Suits On the issue of military personnel on the scene, I got new information. I hadasked if tents had been pitched to accommodate the troops or aheadquarters-type tent as a command post. No tents, he said, but there weremany vehicles including the bus. Then came a surprise disclosure. Near the craftwere a number of personnel wearing asbestos and silver suits. To Jake, thatmeant the possibility of their exposure to dangerous radiation. In this case, wasthe vehicle a U. S. atomic-powered test flight that failed? Or was it a UFO,known to be radioactive in some past instances in tactical operations? Whichever, it would account for the prevailing secrecy when he and hiscompanions were told to leave the area and to forget what they had seen and tokeep their mouths shut."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" As far as the metal fragments found scattered several hundred yards away fromthe craft - some of which were surreptitiously pocketed by Jake or one of hisbuddies - we cannot be sure if they were the property of the downed craft orfrom a U. S. aircraft on an intercept mission which exploded and crashed.According to lab tests, the retrieved fragments were of terrestrial origin. See2-page analysis reported by Andeco below. Two-page metal analysis (1993?) of fragments allegedly picked up at July or August1957 or 1958 UFO crash site in Clovis, New Mexico.Two-page metal analysis on Page 33 of Len Stringfield's 1994UFO Crash/Retrievals, Status Report VII."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"In terms of physical effects, Jake came up with another surprise. One of hiscompanions had a new Bulova digital watch, he said, that stopped workingwhile near the crash site. He added that his (Jake's) watch, with a standardtimepiece mechanism, was discovered to be running 20 minutes slow afterleaving the crash site area.What ever happened near Clovis, New Mexico, in the late 1950s, Jake feltunsafe to discuss his experience with anyone for years knowing that his twocompanions - after leaving the service - disappeared mysteriously and were neverheard from again. The Clovis case is by no means closed.
