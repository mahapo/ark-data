Drawing by Charles Hanna © 1998 by Stan Gordon Productions. Updated August 6, 2004 - In 2002, former President Bill Clinton's Chief of Staff, JohnPodesta, joined the Sci-Fi Channel in a request to NASA to release all documents it has onthe Kecksburg, Pennsylvania “UFO crash” of December 9, 1965. Kecksburg is a small town southeast of Pittsburgh. At 4:47 p.m., on December 9, 1965,witnesses there described seeing a fireball in the sky that seemed to move slowly in acontrolled landing. Afterward, military moved in to recover the object. LongtimeKecksburg investigator, Stan Gordon, interviewed dozens of eyewitnesses who also sawNASA badges on the white overalls of some men who showed up that night in Kecksburgto get the object transported out on a large truck covered by canvas.“Acorn-shaped” object with strange symbols carved around its lower end was describedby firemen who went to the crash scene. Object was a “strange copper color.” Some witnesses saidthat men showed up with NASA badges on their clothes. Drawing made onDecember 9, 1993 by Rick Rieger for investigator, Stan Gordon.In October 2003, Sci-Fi Channel President, Bonnie Hammer, said in a press conferencethat “despite serious effort to uncover the facts, NASA and the Department of Defense arestill maintaining their wall of silence. Whether or not this has anything to do with UFOs -the public has the right to know.”With her statement, the Sci-Fi Channel also threatened to file a lawsuit against NASA andother government agencies for documents about the Kecksburg event. Even though therewere many Kecksburg eyewitnesses, for the past thirty-nine years NASA and the U. S.government have remained silent about what was retrieved.Shortly after Bonnie Hammer's statement, on October 24, 2003, NASA agreed to turn over36 documents relating to the Kecksburg crash. The release came after ten months of"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"pursuing the records through the Freedom of Information Act. The Department of Defenseand the U.S. Army still had not released any records under Sci-Fi's FOIA requests.It's now August 2004 and last month, the Sci Fi Channel's attorney filed an “opposition toNASA's motion for summary judgment.\" Reporter Leslie Keane, who has been workingwith Sci Fi on the FOIA requests, told me this week that what the \"opposition to NASA'smotion” means is that NASA wants a judge to rule that the government space agency hasdone a “satisfactory search” of all its records on the Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, 1965 crash.Therefore, NASA wants the Sci Fi Channel to stop pressuring for more documents andevidence about Kecksburg.The judge has 6 months to rule. The SciFi Channel's legal argument about why NASA hasNOT been completely forthcoming about Kecksburg will be posted later this month at thewebsite, www.freedomofinfo.orgRecently at Earthfiles.com, I reprinted the Kecksburg UFO information reported byLeonard H. Stringfield in his 1991 Status Report VI about the Kecksburg crash, Part 13:UFO Crash/Retrievals: The Inner Sanctum - Status Report VI. I remembered a 1998interview I had done with a truck driver eyewitness named Myron. Longtime investigator,Stan Gordon, had put me in touch with Myron, whose last name has always been withheldto protect him and his family. Myron told Stan and me that not only had he seen theKecksburg object, but also saw what he called a “lizard” arm on a table at Wright-Patterson AFB. Myron was a truck driver from 1957 to 1983. He made a lot of brickdeliveries to construction sites around Wright-Patterson and drove at least four loads ontothe air base.Back in the days after December 9, 1965, Myron said he listened to CB radio chatter whiledriving a load of bricks to Wright-Patterson. Those CB radio communications, Myron said,are how he learned that the Kecksburg object was first taken to Lockbourne AFB in Ohio,and kept overnight. The next day, Myron said it was transported to Wright-Patterson AFBoutside Dayton, Ohio, where Myron was headed with his truck load of bricks.Interview (by Linda Howe on March 26, 1998, for Dreamland and Coast to Coast AMwith Art Bell radio): Myron, Born, Raised and Retired in Ohio, Former Truck Driver from 1957 to 1983:“They took us in the back gate and they drove us across the runway and out the front gate.Then they took us down through Fairborn, (Ohio - located northeast of Dayton at theintersection of I-70 & I-675), and that's what threw me. Twenty years later, I went back toWright-Patterson with some people and we could not find the buildings.But then I have another friend stationed at Wright-Patterson and he told me where it was.(Where we went with bricks in 1965) was at the old training center. That bell-shaped thingwas buried in the building at the old training center.LET'S GO BACK, IF YOU WOULD, TO THAT PERIOD OF TIME IN 1965 AND YOUWERE DRIVING A TRUCK WITH MATERIALS ONTO WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB.WERE THEY BUILDING A BUILDING?No, we took brick in there and we really didn't know what was going on until I got into thefront door of it. But they had this thing in one corner and they were going to entomb thewhole building.WHAT EXACTLY WERE YOU SEEING?It was a bell-shape, or acorn, really. They were cutting a hole through the top of it to getinside.YOU ARE INSIDE OF A HANGAR AT WRIGHT-PATTERSON?No, we're inside of a car garage.YOU WERE A TRUCK DRIVER AND YOU WERE TAKING BRICKS TO THISGARAGE AT WRIGHT-PATTERSON?Ye s .SO, YOU HAVE A LOAD OF BRICKS AND YOU ARE UNLOADING THE BRICKS ATTHE AFB GARAGE. IT MUST HAVE BEEN A LARGE GARAGE?It was about 40 feet long and probably 20 to 25 feet wide.WHO IS IT THAT YOU SEE IN THE GARAGE?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I see Navy men and Air Force all wearing these white uniforms, rubber boots, rubbergloves, masks over their faces.LIKE THEY WERE DRESSED UP AS IF THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUTEXPOSURE TO SOMETHING?Ye s .PROTECTIVE SUITS.Protective suits, because they washed them down every time they come out of the garage.ARE YOU STANDING IN THE GARAGE?I was until they ran me out.SO YOU ARE STANDING IN THE GARAGE AND YOU ARE SEEING THESE NAVYAND AIR FORCE MEN IN WHITE PROTECTIVE SUITS AROUND AN OBJECT.CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT WHAT THE SHAPE AND SIZE WERE?It was shaped like an acorn and about 10 feet 3 inches wide. And the reason I say 3 inchesis because when they tried to get it in the door of the garage, they pulled off the casing thatgoes around the door. It was probably about 12 to 13 feet high because it just lacked onlyabout 3 or 4 inches of touching the lights that were shining on it.WHAT WAS THE COLOR?It was darker at the bottom and copper colored at the top.WHEN YOU SAY COPPER COLORED, DO YOU MEAN LIKE A SHINY COPPERKETTLE IN A KITCHEN?Like it had been hot and had a lot of soot on it.IT WASN'T SHINY COPPER?No.BUT IT WAS AN ORANGISH COLOR OF COPPER ON THE TOP?Yeah. And down around the bottom, there was some writing on it. But no one over thereknew what the writing meant.WHAT COULD YOU SEE WITH YOUR OWN EYES IN THAT WRITING?I could see that we did not invent something like that unless Russia did.DO YOU REMEMBER ANY OF THE SYMBOLS?No, they didn't even look like any of the symbols I've seen on TV on Egypt or it lookedlike it was welded on there.THE SYMBOLS WERE RAISED ABOVE THE SURFACE?Yeah.DO YOU REMEMBER ANY SHAPES?No.LIKE STARS OR CIRCLES?No, it was just triangles and like a plus mark and what looked like an X mark. Navy and Air Force PersonnelCut Into Acorn-Shaped ObjectWHAT WERE THE AIR FORCE AND NAVY MEN DOING WITH THE ACORN-SHAPED OBJECT?They had a ladder propped up on one side of it and when we first got there, they wastrying to get into it. Then by the time we left that day at 3:30 or 4 p.m., they must have gotinto it. I got off for awhile on break and wandered in there."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"They was trying everything to get in. They was trying to use cutting torches and somespecial acid one of the officers brought in to see if it would melt a hole in that copperdome or what was copper-colored.WHAT WORKED?I don't know. They must have got into it because they said it was a mess on the inside thatmost everything was just burned to a crisp.ON THE INSIDE. DID YOU SEE ANY KIND OF HOLE OR OPENING ON THE'ACORN?'I could only see about half of it. There had to be a door at the top or they wouldn't havebeen up there trying to get it open.SO THE AIR FORCE AND NAVY WERE TRYING TO WORK THROUGH THE TOP?WERE THEY WORKING WITH ACETYLENE TORCHES AND THINGS LIKE THAT?Yeah, they had everything in there. They had stuff I ain't never seen before.WERE YOU THERE THEN AFTER THEY HAD IT OPEN?Yeah.WHAT DID THEY TAKE OUT OF THE INSIDE?They took something out of it, but I never seen any skin like that before. It looked like alizard skin.SO WAS IT A BEING WITH LIZARD SKIN?It was a greenish, reddish color. Then I only seen the left arm of it and it only had threefingers on it. I worked in a garage part time and I tried to operate a crescent wrench withthree fingers and it's hard to do!WERE THEY BIG FINGERS?About the size of a woman's fingers. It was the thumb and the middle finger and the littlefinger.WITH SPACES IN BETWEEN?Yeah, there wasn't nothing there in between. But I only seen the hand and arm of the leftside because they carried it over and laid it on the bench that had one of those great bigpaper white sheets laid over it. The arm was sticking out. He told me right then, 'You didn'tsee nothing, you don't say nothing because we can lose you in this base somewhere and noone would ever find you.'WHO SAID THAT TO YOU?The goddamn Navy!WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THIS THREAT FROM SOMEBODY IN THE MILITARY?After we got back to the brick yard, my uncle was in the Navy and he said, 'Them guysover there called and told us that one of you boys was in that building when they wasdoing all this.' And I said, 'Yeah, it was me, and they done told me to keep my mouth shutand don't say another word.' So after a couple of weeks, we forgot all about it. A “Lizard” Entity?GOING BACK TO THE BEING THAT THEY LIFTED OUT, ABOUT HOW BIG WASIT?I'd say it was about 4 feet tall because the paper dropped over the head and feet. But theonly thing I seen was the one left arm.DESCRIBE AGAIN WHAT YOU WERE SEEING IN THE TEXTURE AND COLOR OFTHE SKIN?It was a dark greenish-reddish color. It was darker at the bottom and reddish up on to theelbow towards where it connects up to the shoulder."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"THE CLOSEST SKIN ON EARTH THAT YOU COULD RELATE THAT TO WOULD BEWHAT?We had one around here, but I don't know what you call it. It looked like a lizard with along tail with a head with a rooster comb on top of its head.LIKE A GILA MONSTER?Yeah.T H AT ' S W H AT T H AT S K I N T H AT Y O U S AW B A C K I N 1 9 6 5 I N T H E G A R A G E ATWRIGHT-PATERSON AFB LOOKED LIKE ON SOMETHING THEY TOOK OUT OFAN ACORN-SHAPED OBJECT THAT HAD COME FROM KECKSBURG,PENNSYLVANIA?Ye s .DID YOU KNOW IN THE GARAGE THAT WHAT THE AIR FORCE AND NAVYWERE WORKING ON WAS FROM KECKSBURG, PENNSYLVANIA? DID SOMEONESAY THAT?Yeah, we know it come from Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, because they was talking about itover the CB radios (in the trucks).WHEN YOU WERE TRACKING ALL THE WAY, WHAT KIND OF INFORMATIONWERE YOU HEARING ON YOUR TRUCK RADIO?I was hearing everything. It come into Columbus, Ohio, and the Navy people, when theywere ordering the brick they said, 'Yeah, we left a guard on it and he had orders to shootanyone looking at it or being around it.' About two days before the Navy come in, wedelivered brick at Wheeling, West Virginia. That was before that tunnel was built and wehad to go the old way. And THEM boys was telling us that when they brought that throughat 2 o'clock in the morning, that it hit the trolley lines and they made a big crack everytime that acorn object would hit the lines. So they had to take it back and put it on Route198 and took it through the south end of Wheeling, West Virginia, and brought it throughBridgeport or somewhere there and brought it up the higher side.THEY HAD TO FIND A WAY TO TRAVEL WITHOUT HITTING THOSE TROLLEYLINES?Yeah.THAT'S WHY THE TRUCK DRIVERS WERE TALKING ABOUT IT ON THEIR CBRADIOS?Ye s .YOU KNEW IT WAS THE CRASHED OBJECT FROM KECKSBURG,PENNSYLVANIA?Well, they didn't know what it was, but they said that the Army had the lowboy trailer anda tractor and they had it all covered up with canvas.AND AT THE WRIGHT-PATTERSON GARAGE, THE MEN WERE HAVINGPROBLEMS GETTING IT THROUGH THAT GARAGE DOOR.Yes, they tore the casing off that door trying to get it in there.DID YOUR UNCLE HAVE ANY MORE FOLLOW UP FROM ANYONE IN THENAVY?My uncle worked in the Pentagon in Washington, D. C. But see, all the governmentcontracts he got for bricks. My uncle had in Lockbourne down there in Columbus, hefurnished all the brick for all the buildings down there. We hauled down there for three orfour years. Then, he got the contract to deliver bricks to a hospital up at Cleveland, Ohio.Anything tied in with the government, he got the orders.DID HE EVER COME BACK TO YOU AND SAY, 'YOU KNOW, THAT ACORN-SHAPED THING AND THAT LIZARD ARM YOU SAW IN THE GARAGE ATWRIGHT-PATTERSON... AND TELL YOU SOMETHING MORE?No. He said, 'Keep your mouth shut and don't tell no one!' Because he took an oath beforehe left to the service down there and he took what he knew to the grave with him. Now,the cousin, he took an oath when he got out of the Navy down there and he really don't"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"want to say nothing.DOES HE KNOW ABOUT EXTRATERRESTRIALS?Yeah.HE DOES KNOW?Yes, but he won't say nothing. Some way they must take an oath for the rest of their livesnot to tell what went on or what goes on or nothing else.BUT YOU SAW THE ACORN-SHAPED OBJECT AND THE LIZARD-SKIN ARMWITH YOUR OWN EYES.Yeah! Government Policy of Secrecy and DenialWHY DO YOU THINK THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS SUCH A POLICY OFSUPPRESSION ABOUT IT?Ain't none of them can tell the truth.WHY DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT IS LYING ABOUTEXTRATERRESTRIALS?They lie about everything.HAVE YOU EVER HAD A CONVERSATION WITH ANY OF YOUR RELATIVESWHO ARE IN THE NAVY ABOUT EXTRATERRESTRIALS?Yes, and I'll tell you right now, I talked to a guy at Wright-Patterson about one year ago.And he said if we don't do something with these damn UFOs flying around, we're going tobe in one helluva mess. Then I talked to him awhile back and he said, 'Well, we're ahead ofthem now.' He said we're going to have a war between them two (?). But now he saidwe've caught up with them.DID HE SAY WHY WE WOULD HAVE A WAR?He said there were hundreds stopping in here at earth all the time and now the U. S. AirForce and Navy have caught up with them and shooting them down.SHOOTING THEM DOWN?Yeah.DID THIS PERSON SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WHICH TYPES OF BEINGS THEYHAVE SHOT DOWN?No, but he worked on all the airplanes over at Wright-Patterson. He said, 'We're just nowstarting to catch up and get ahead of them.' Years later, I went back a couple of times andcouldn't find it.THAT BUILDING THAT WAS BRICKED OVER?That building. Then one day this woman who worked at Wright-Patterson was with me andand another researcher. She said, 'Let's take a short cut and go through this way.' And Isaid, 'Hell, that's the guard shack we passed!' And I said, 'Where is this other piece ofbase?' I told her about the general direction that we had went and she said, 'That was theold training center and they don't use that no more.' I said, 'When did they stop using it?'And she said, 'Right after WWII.' She took us down past there and I said, 'That's it! Seethose five buildings sitting way back there in the back corner.' I said, 'That's where it'sburied at in that garage back there.' But boy, you can't get in that garage! You can't evenget on that part of the base.BACK IN THE DAY WHEN THE NAVY AND AIR FORCE MEN WERE WORKINGON THAT ACORN-SHAPED OBJECT, WHY DO YOU THINK THEY ALLOWED YOUTO WATCH WHAT THEY WERE DOING?They didn't see where I was at. I just climbed off the trailer and they was all taking a breakand I moseyed up to the big door and walked about 6 or 8 feet inside it, standing there likea dummy, looking at everything. After a few minutes, some guy got down off of thisscaffold and he come over and said, 'What can I do for you?' And I said, 'Nothing, I'm just"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"looking at that.' He said, 'Well, you aren't supposed to see it or tell anyone, and we couldlose your whole corpse here in these walls and no one would ever know what happened toyou.' They were going to entomb that building with the brick.THEY LITERALLY BRICKED UP THAT ENTIRE GARAGE?Yeah! And made that end of the garage (where the acorn object was) so that no one couldget to it. And if anyone asked, they would say it's a cistern.WHAT THE NAVY AND AIR FORCE HAD WAS THE PROBLEM THAT YOU WERETHERE TO TRANSPORT IN BRICK THAT WAS GOING TO COVER UP THEGARAGE THEY WERE IN AND IT WAS HARD TO MAKE YOU GO AWAY UNTILYOU GOT THE BRICKS UNLOADED?Yeah. It's on the part of the base where no one goes anymore.SO FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW, THAT BRICK BUILDING IS STILL THERE WITHTHAT ACORN-SHAPED MACHINE THAT CAME DOWN IN KECKSBURG,PENNSYLVANIA?Yeah.WHERE IS THAT LIZARD-SKINNED BODY? WHERE DID THEY TAKE IT?I don't know.IT IS A PUZZLE ABOUT WHY THIS POLICY OF SILENCE CONTINUES FOR 50SOME YEARS.Yeah. Like I told one of the Navy men over there, 'If I ever see one or find one, yougoddamn guys will be the last ones to know about it.'BECAUSE?Because I'll load it up, if I can get a truck and trailer, and I'll bring it home with me.BECAUSE WHEN THEY GET IT, WE DON'T LEARN ANYTHING.Right. And the only way to wake up the American people is find one of them and drive itright down goddamn Main Street!”More Information:If you have any information about the Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, UFO crash on December9, 1965, please contact:Stan Gordon's Pennsylvania Hotline: 724-838-7768Stan Gordon's website: http://www.stangordonufo.comWebsite:http://www.freedomofinfo.orgCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
