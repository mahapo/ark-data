C., Canada - This morning I received thefollowing e-mail with images attached from Paul Anderson, Director, CanadianCrop Circle Research Network (CCCRN). He and others have been looking atOpportunity and Spirit images on Mars in some detail and have questions aboutyet unexplained features. Below is Paul's e-mail with images and I will follow upwith planetary geologists for further comments in a future Earthfiles.com report.February 4, 2004 E-mail from Paul Anderson,CCCRN, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada:\"Hi Linda,Just forwarding you some images and information to you from theOpportunity and Spirit landing sites on Mars. Didn't know if you had seenany of these yet? I did send an e-mail to Andrew Knoll of the Mars Rover Team at JPL andhe replied this morning saying he thinks the 'plant' is probably airbagdebris, though I'm curious as to there being no markings in the soil aroundit at all and it is not next to or in any of the other airbag bounce or dragmarks, it is some ways away all by itself in (or on) the barren dark soil inthe panorama (see photo attached). He did say also there is a lot of interestand discussion re the 'Sushi' rock at JPL (see below) even though the roverseems to have bypassed it (??). He said it may be a magma-producedvesicle. Do you have any contacts at JPL you could follow all this up onmore? People in anomalist groups are talking a lot about these things, butnobody in the mainstream (as per usual I guess). Section of Opportunity Panorama ImageWhich Includes 2-Pronged FeatureA portion of the color image by Opportunity's panoramic camera which includesthe light-colored bedrock and unidentified 2-pronged feature in the lower rightcorner.This shallow hematite-rich Meridiani Planum crater is where the spacecraft came torest when itlanded on Mars on January 25, 2004. Image credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell. The first (shown above here), at Opportunity, is an odd little something"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"first noticed in four of the raw images taken of the nearby soil on Sol 2, asmall object which looks almost, dare I say it, like a tiny plant with twoupward-pointing 'stalks' or else some kind of debris from the lander itself.It is also better seen in the new colour panorama just released on February2. I've attached two cropped, but otherwise untouched photos I made fromthe high-res panorama: one showing it in relation to the bedrock (it is onthe soil 'below' the far right-hand end of the exposed bedrock, near thebottom right corner of the image) ... and the other is a closer zoom (shownbelow).

Image blown up by Paul Anderson. Another Puzzling Opportunity Image: Sphere \"Rock\"? Opportunity took this image of the hematite-rich soil and unidentified light-coloredsphere with its microscopic imager on February 4, 2004. Image credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell. This image is from the Opportunity microscopic imager just released today.One of at least two similar objects in this photo, they seem to be sphericalwith a spot or hole in their side. I've attached a cropped and zoomed butagain otherwise untouched photo (microball_zoom.jpg). Again, looksorganic, sort of like diatoms, but may be mineral or dust grains? Original images:http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/all/opportunity_m010.html Comments from NASA/JPL/Cornell about spherical structures in Martiansoil: \"This magnified look (above) at the Martian soil near the Mars ExplorationRover Opportunity's landing site, Meridiani Planum, shows coarse grainssprinkled over a fine layer of sand. The image was captured by the rover'smicroscopic imager on the 10th day, or sol, of its mission. Scientists are"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"intrigued by the spherical rocks, which can be formed by a variety of geologicprocesses, including cooling of molten lava droplets and accretion of concentriclayers of material around a particle or 'seed.'Small patch of Martian soil near Opportunity lander in which unidentified lighterobjects are seen. Image credit: NASA/JPL/US Geological Survey.The examined patch of soil is 3 centimeters (1.2 inches) across. The circulargrain in the lower left corner is approximately 3 millimeters ( .12 inches) across,or about the size of a sunflower seed.\" \"Sushi\" RockAbove: foreground squarish rock that NASA has dubbed \"Sushi\"has on its left face an unidentified dark \"square.\" Below is a close-up of Sushi.Image credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell. The third above, at Spirit, is the rock nick-named \"Sushi\" by NASA/JPL. Itwas to have been one of the first targets for the rover, but then determinedto be too rough for grinding. The rock itself appears very interestinghowever, with the sort of rectangular looking \"hole\" in it's flattest face (leftside of rock), clearly seen in the images. I've shown the photos to a coupleof geologists I know here, and they are quite interested in it, but they needcloser photos. They both say this could be the hole left by a dissolved"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"crystal, such as glendonite, for example. I'm surprised this hadn't beenexamined more closely yet (before the software problems), or at least it hasnot been commented on by JPL. To these geologists and myself also, itwould seem this particular rock could potentially be more interestinggeologically than these next ones on the list, 'Cake' and 'Blanco.' and isalso nearby.
