Provided by Timothy CooperFourth interview with retired USAF M/Sergeant, \"Bob,\" April 7, 1991Location: Confidential \"I brought the book, The Roswell Incident by William Moore, and the report onMJ-12 by Stanton Friedman. When Bob saw them, he guessed the reason for thediscussion we had the night before. I showed him the picture of Major Jesse Marcelholding the wreckage of an alleged crashed flying disc. Bob said, 'I knew about thatwhen it happened; Bill Moore had only half the story.' So I asked him if the Roswellrecovery was tied in with the White Sands-Tularosa operation. He just looked at me.He did not say a word. Then he just grinned and changed the story. He just wanted tochange the subject. Bob knew more than he was letting on. I noticed a medal in acase hanging on the wall of his mobile home. It was the Air Force DistinguishedService Medal. It was awarded him for outstanding service in the Strategic AirCommand photographic intelligence service during the 1962 Cuban missile crisiswhile he was stationed at Ent AFB, Colorado Springs, Colorado. Then, Bob made an abrupt statement to me. He said, 'Roswell is only part of the UFOcrash/landings in New Mexico.' I took that to mean, yes to my previous question(about White Sands and Tularosa.) Digressing a little, he told me that a few years later, the new base commander(Colonel William Baines) brought to him blow-ups of frames taken by Askaniatracking cameras. The pictures showed formations of oblong objects pacing the vaportrail of a V-2 rocket and over Holloman AFB itself. The officer that actually orderedhim to print copies of these pictures was Colonel Don R. Ostrander. The colonel wasinsistent that everyone except him leave the production area (a repeat of previousassignments). The Air Force wanted to know what these were. The prints did not turnout well (because of the glass-dot screens then in use). The Air Force Office ofSpecial Investigations was involved in securing photographic material of theseover-flights near Holloman AFB in 1949 and in the early fifties. He mentions a MajorEdward A. Doty as being in charge of security for Holloman AFB. Bob said he knewhim. Since Bob had a Top Secret Q Clearance Crypto, he was not bothered verymuch - possibly because he could keep secrets well and did not talk about what hesaw in the reports he printed. A Major Edward Doty, OSI, is mentioned in an April 18, 1949 and April 30, 1949,summary of Project Grudge distributed in 1952. Major Doty is mentioned in theabstract on the GRD (Geophysics Research Division, AMC) under Post ContractualInquiry. On August 9, 1951, Lt. Col. Cox of the 17th OSI District (Kirtland AFB)was quoted as saying that they were still receiving reports of 'aerial objectphenomena.' On August 27, 1951, Major Edward A. Doty had assumed responsibility"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"for Holloman AFB investigations. Major Doty was 'to collect reports, make periodicreview of the files ... maintain liaison with OSI, the Provost Marshall's Office and anyother agencies whose activities may serve to provide information concerning futureaerial phenomena developments.' On August 28, 1951, Dr. Lincoln La Paz met withHolloman security (Maj. Doty) and intelligence staff concerning the 1947 fireballsightings. The report mentions La Paz as saying, 'The fireballs may be of our ownmilitary origin, but if not, they are a matter of serious concern.' The report goes on to state that, 'Major Doty also arranged a conference with Mr.Warren Knot who is in charge of Land-Air Operations. Mr. Knot pointed out that aformal report covering the years (1950) vigilance period had not been issued(possibly the one of several Bob says were highly classified and was not included inany official report) since the contract contained no such provision.' The abstract also contains this bit of information. In a classified letter from Chief ofStaff, USAF to CG, AMC, subject \"Light Phenomena,\" on September 14, 1949, Lt.Col. Frederic C. E. Oder of CRD attended a conference at Los Alamos, October 14,1949, on the subject of 'Green Fireballs' observed in northern New Mexico area.Since the phenomena had been observed only in this area and only since 1947, it hadcaused considerable concern among security agencies in the area. I remember that a lot of generals were being flown to Alamogordo Field from July 10through July 14, 1947. I was told that Generals Twining, LeMay, Groves,Vandenberg, Wainwright, and Doolittle were being flown to the base and flying out toother bases. There was also some top ranking German scientists, as well asAmerican, at Alamogordo. Some of them were von Braun, Oppenheimer, vonNeuman, Steinhoff, La Paz, and I think Bush - but I can't be certain about(Vannevar) Bush. I know this because I read the names on the reports. I asked the following questions concerning the test activities at Holloman AFB andany association with Roswell SAC base. Tularosa, New Mexico Linda Moulton Howe editorial note: Below is a map provided to me by Andy Kissner, LasCruces, New Mexico, of 1947 UFO events he has researched that occurred around WhiteSands Missile Range. He also found the June 28, 1947, El Paso Times newspaper articleabout unidentified \"falling objects\" sighted by witnesses on June 27, 1947, near Tularosaand Eagle, New Mexico. The article says, \"Search parties were sent out from White Sandsin attempts to locate the objects or secure additional information.\" I wonder if this June 27event could be the real date for the craft retrieval described below in Len Stringfield'sStatus Report VI? The Majestic-12 research of Timothy Cooper's documents by Bob and Ryan Wood the pastdecade indicates there were at least three \"Landing Zones\" of crashed UFOs between July2 and July 5, 1947. Landing Zone 1 is placed on the Mac Brazel ranch between Corona andRoswell. Landing Zone 2 is identified as near the Trinity Test Site in the White SandsMissile Range. Landing Zone 3 is placed thirty miles east of Alamogordo on an AmericanIndian school property. Changing dates, or floating several dates, for a variety of eventswhether true or not is a classic intelligence tool to muddy waters and keep the press andpublic confused about sensitive, classified matters. It's also possible that objects of unknown origin came down in the Tularosa area on bothJune 27 and July 4, 1947."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"El Paso Times, El Paso, Texas, June 28, 1947. Provided by Timothy CooperFourth interview with retired USAF M/Sergeant, \"Bob,\" April 7, 1991Location: ConfidentialQ: Did you know about the Roswell base finding and transporting unidentifiedwreckage to 8th Air Force HQ? A: Not at first. Remember, White Sands and Alamogordo reported to the AMCat Wright-Patterson. Roswell was a SAC base and reported to Offut Field, sowe did not work together. I did not know of any of the alleged activity untilafter July 8, 1947, when our base went on a security alert until the 16th. Therewere MPs all over the hangar area and near the strip. After I talked to mybuddy, Paul, I knew something was not right. He related to me how he andothers were called to the base commander's office for a 'special shoot' in theNorth Range. This was on July 4, 1947, near Tularosa. He said he had heard that a target wasbeing tracked clear across the northwestern New Mexico area and wasprojected to fly over the North Range from the West and straight into Texas.All camera crews and photographers were to report to the motor pool withtheir equipment. They were told no more than that. Some were still drunk fromcelebrating (4th of July). Some were in civilian clothes; the MPs were pickingthem up everywhere. Q: What happened next? A: The convoy left the base and proceeded north up the highway and thenturned west into the range. Paul told me, 'It took about an hour to get to wherewe were supposed to go. Crossed a lot of open sand until we reached somehilly area. After they stopped, they fanned out in a long line and started tomove toward the hilly area. Most had flashlights and some vehicles hadsearchlights. The Askania camera operators were told to point their cameras"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"towards the northwest. We all thought it was the balloons launched theprevious day. They had brought some 80's and starshell (illumination) rounds.Why? For balloons!? Some time around midnight, the tube crews dropped some illumination rounds- lots of them. They lit up the whole sky pretty good, Paul said. A radiomanyelled for the colonel to come to the radio van. Then he yelled out for allcameras to train at a certain heading their cameras at a certain angle (relativeto true north and compass bearing). Sometime around midnight, the mortarcrews started to drop illumination rounds again. A bright object wasapproaching from the northwest at a 60 degree position in the night sky (fromthe horizon). All Askania cameras were tracking the object until it disappearedbehind some hills. Q: What happened then? A: My 1st Sergeant buddy said that the search teams got back in their vehiclesand drove off in the direction where the craft came down. It took another hourbefore they reached the landing site. Some MPs found a large metallic discresting against a sand hill, slightly tilted. It was approximately 100 to 150 feetor so in diameter, maybe larger. Difficult to tell for sure because it was darkand only the reflection of the searchlights was visible from my position(approximately 100 yards away). There were a lot of lights being shone on thecraft and a lot of base personnel surrounding the craft, but keeping arespectable distance from it. Everyone was excited and scared at the sametime. They soon brought generators and floodlights for better lighting. Q: What did the 1st Sergeant see at the landing site? A: He did not see much. He was some distance away. He could see a bigdisc-like craft with a flat bottom and a slightly round-shaped dome on top. Itwas shiny with a rim surrounding the craft. It was big, kinda grayish in color,but very shiny. There were a lot of MPs and base technicians surrounding it.They seemed to just stand there looking at it. All the time, they were takingpictures with flashbulbs and there were some motion picture photographerstaking pictures as well. A little later (about 2 or 3 a.m. in the morning), some ofthe technicians were able to climb on top of the craft. Some had black rubbersuits on with geiger counters, I think (checking for radiation possibly). About 3 a.m. in the morning, some scientists and engineers had arrived. Theybegan to put up canvas all around the craft and set up a command post andstorage tents. There were a lot of guards surrounding the site. He knew thatsome of the scientists did not come from Alamogordo or White Sands becausethey were accompanied by some high ranking generals. They appeared to entera tent and emerged wearing some overalls and carrying masks of some kind.There were trucks arriving and departing all morning. I think I heard aircraftflying or landing nearby near the highway. I do not know what these truckswere transporting, but it must have been important. By 6 or 7 a.m. thatmorning, the Askania crews were ordered out of the area and back toAlamogordo. There were security checkpoints all along the way to thehighway. All of us were debriefed at Alamogordo by CIC people and had tosign non-disclosure statements as to what we did, saw and heard. That waswhen I saw him first. He told me some days afterward. Q: When did you become involved with this event? A: As I told you before, I was in my office a few days after I saw Paul. It wasat the Base Production Unit. We were printing the results of a V-2 launchwhen the base commander, Colonel Helmlek, arrived at the building with adetail of MPs that surrounded the premises and ordered everybody to leaveexcept me. The rest, you already know. Len Stringfield: I note again that Bob emphasizes a crash, or a landing, in the WhiteSands Range (near Tularosa) and goes into detail about the tracking team and theretrieval operation at the site. The date he gives for this activity is July 4th. However,he does admit without elaboration to having had knowledge of a crash at Corona (theso-called Roswell crash) to which he does not affix the known date, July 2nd. Thisadmission came when Cooper, showing Bob the picture of Major Jesse Marcelholding the alleged wreckage, stated, 'I knew about that when it happened and"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Moore had only part of the story.' And later, he said, 'Roswell is only part of the UFOcrash landing story in New Mexico.' In summary, according to Bob, a saucer crashed near Roswell and at White SandsMissile Range and maybe elsewhere. Maybe Bob knows more and is not yet willingto talk about the specifics.\"Continued in Part 8.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
