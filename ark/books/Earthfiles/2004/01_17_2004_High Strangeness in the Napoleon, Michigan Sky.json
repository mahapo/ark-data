January 16, 2004 Napoleon, Michigan - Since the middle of December,residents of Horton and Napoleon, Michigan, west of Ann Arbor, have seensome very strange lights and objects in the sky. Another mystery was a large,nearly perfectly round ice circle discovered on December 28th at Mud Lakenear Horton. The ice circle was probably created by Nature. But the sky objectsare highly strange, returning to the same places, and changing shape in front ofat least half a dozen people. One of the shapes included hawk-like wings.The day after Christmas three policemen in Huntington, Indiana, reported amysterious aerial object in the daytime that kept rolling over and changingshapes, one of which was also compared to hawk-like wings. (Earthfiles011004) Oddly enough, another bizarre aerial object with wing-like projectionswas seen near Philadelphia on New Year's Day.None of the local Huntington airport radars had picked up anything unusual andno other radar reports of unidentified aerial objects surfaced from Michigan orPennsylvania at a time when the American Homeland Security Departmentraised the terrorist attack alert to orange throughout the Christmas and NewYears holidays.What is flying around in the skies of Illinois, Michigan and Pennsylvania undetected except for a few eyewitnesses? It's also worth noting that Napoleon,Michigan has a huge limestone quarry that has long been linked to theappearance of mysterious lights. Limestone around the world seems linked tomysterious lights, but no one knows why. Bizarre Aerial Objects in Napoleon, MichiganJanuary 9, 2004In Napoleon, on January 9, 2004, at 7:30 p.m., Mark Payne was leaving the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"store where he works. As he was driving home, a big, white light in the skycaught his attention. Mark thought the light was hovering and pulled his car overto get a better look and to listen for sound. There was no sound and he couldnot understand what the light was. He continued on to his home and the lightseemed to follow him, ending up over a field across the street. Soon a secondlight appeared and the two objects began circling each other and changingshapes to the astonishment of Mark, his father, mother, 10-year-old daughterand their neighbors, Dwayne and Anita Lantis.Mark Payne, Country Market Stock Clerk, Napoleon, Michigan: \"When Ifirst seen it, all I could see was the white light on top. But then when I got to myhouse, you could see like these lights coming out of the bottom like red, blue,green. Then when it took like the form of a rod, it was like pure white. That's allI could see.One of two unidentified aerial objects that circled each other and changed shapefrom 8-9 p.m. ET on January 9, 2004, Napoleon, Michigan. Drawing © 2004 by Mark J.Payne. Then another thing, when they looked like they were going together, these twothings come together, it looked like a top of a rainbow, like an arch, but itlooked like these wings were coming out of the back of it. And they wouldchange into like a silver-green when it did that. And it did that like twice. Itchanged from (the 'bell') to like a rod-looking thing, then into a thing withwings. My dad kept commenting on that. He said, 'What do you think that is?' Itjust sat there for a whole hour. It would kind of move away, but it would comeback, you know?Original sketches on January 9, 2004, after Mark Payne, his family"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"and neighbors watched unidentified aerial objects in Napoleon, Michigan,that kept changing shape from a \"bell\" emitting short beams to a long bar of lightto green wings sprouting from the bell-shaped object.Drawing © 2004 by Mark J. Payne.AT ANY POINT, DID YOU SEE ANY TRIANGULAR SHAPES, ROUNDSHAPES, SQUARE SHAPES, OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?Yes, it looked like a triangle shape, but it was kind of rounded on the sidesinstead of to a point.DID YOU AT ANY POINT EVER LOOK AT ANY OF THESE OBJECTSTHROUGH BINOCULARS?No. I didn't even think of it. My mom had a camera, but she didn't have any filmin it. I didn't really want to leave because I didn't know if that thing was going toleave. I was just kind of mesmerized by it.WAS IT CLOSE ENOUGH THAT YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD SOUND IF ITWERE AN AIRPLANE?Oh, yeah. Definitely. We live right by an airport here. It's about a half milestraight over and I see airplanes all the time and this was no airplane at all. Itwasn't no helicopter and nothing like that. It wasn't making any sound at all, noteven a hum, low humming sound, or nothing.WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT RED, BLUE AND GREEN COLOREDOBJECTS COMING OUT OF THE BOTTOM OF IT DID YOU MEAN THEREWERE COLORED OBJECTS THAT WERE LEAVING THE OBJECT ORCOMING OUT INTO THE AIR OR WHAT?They were just lights, like flashing lights. I mean, it was just like they werecoming straight down in a beam, but it would be red and then turn blue andwhite and just like weird it wasn't nothing like a plane would do. Because likeI'm watching this thing and there is like a flight pattern from like Detroit youcould see jets like every five minutes. Well, these jets were going - these thingswere like right in between the jumbo jets, you know?DID THE TWO LIGHT OBJECTS, THE TRIANGLES, DID THEY EVERCOME TOGETHER TO FORM ONE BAR?Ye s . Ye s .HOW MANY TIMES DID THEY DO THAT?They did that twice.After the two unidentified aerial objects came together, a bright, long barappeared before changing back into the bell-with-wings. Drawing © 2004 by Mark J.Payne.SO TWICE THE TRIANGULAR OBJECTS THAT WERE SEPARATE CAMETOGETHER AND FORMED ONE LONG BAR. COULD YOU DESCRIBEMORE THE WINGS THAT APPEARED ON THESE TWO OBJECTS?Yeah, the wings they looked like an eagle's wing or something. They went"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"straight out, but then they come down like say to 180 degree slant on the end.They would slant downward, but I don't know what that was either. My dad, Ikept asking him what that was and he didn't know what that was.WERE THE WINGS ANY SPECIFIC COLOR?Yeah, they were when it did that, the whole thing would turn like a silverish-green. It did that twice. I remember that because it was like, 'That thing isturning green now.'Mark Payne in this drawing tried to show the way the wings bent down180 degrees at the tips. He said the actual green during the sighting wasvery pale green. Drawing © 2004 by Mark J. Payne.The wings were huge. You could see them like really good. But then when likethe whole thing would I don't know the wings, they would like disappear and allyou would see is the bright light on top. But then you would see the other lightoff to the left of it, like the thing I don't know if they separated and then wentback. But the only time you would see it change is when they would gotogether.It just seemed like when they (two lights) went together it would seem like onelight would go around the other one but they would like almost go together andthat's when I would see that it would change.TO THE WINGS?Ye s .THAT'S WHEN YOU WOULD SEE THE HAWK WING SHAPES?Right, but it would only hold that for a few seconds and then it would go backto the bright light. There are two times it changed like that and held that wingshape for only a few seconds, but then it would go back to the bright light. Thenit would seem like it would move away and turn to a bluish color, but when itcame back, you could only see that bright light up there.WHEN IT CHANGED INTO THE BAR, DID IT CHANGE INTO THE BARBEFORE YOU SAW THE WINGS OR AFTER?Before. Both times it did that, at first it was like a long rod, a white rod, andthen it would look, take the shape of the top of a rainbow with an arch. Thenyou would see these wings coming out of the back of it, like they would bepointing straight out and then the tips would be pointing straight down on eachside.SO IF I HAVE THE PATTERN OF CHANGE CORRECTLY, YOU WOULDSEE A BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT THAT WOULD THEN TURN INTO ABLUISH COLOR THAT WOULD THEN TURN INTO A LONG, WHITE BAR,THAT WOULD THEN TURN INTO A GREENISH-SILVER COLOREXTENDING THESE HAWK-LIKE WINGS FOR A FEW SECONDS, ANDTHEN RETURN BACK TO A BRIGHT, WHITE LIGHT?Right.BOTH OBJECTS DID THIS?Right. I've only seen a few things I couldn't explain, but this thing the other night I don't know, I just it was kind of like a life-changing experience, you know?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"You see something like that, it scares you.AND IT SCARES YOU WHY?Because of the unknown, I guess.DO YOU THINK ABOUT WHERE IT MIGHT BE FROM?Yes, I would say it is definitely not from this world. I don't know. It was nothingmanmade, I know that.\" January 16, 2004A week after Mark, his family and neighbors watched the shape-changing aerialobjects, on January 16, 2004, not long after midnight, I received a telephone callfrom 20-year-old Ralph Hansel who also works as a stock clerk at the CountryMarket. He had heard about Mark Payne's experience, but never thought hewould see anything so bizarre - until he actually did that night. Ralph told mehe had left work and was driving down Austin Road in Napoleon, the same roadMark had traveled on January 9. Straight ahead in the distance, he could seebright lights about three times higher than the tree line. He decided to drivetoward the lights and was amazed when he found himself right under the bottomof one.Interview:Ralph Hansel, Stock Clerk, Country Market, Napoleon, Michigan: \"Wedrove under the UFO, got out. I got out. My girlfriend did not. She stayed in thecar. I got out and looked up and could see flashing red and blue lights, singlered and blue lights, and then the strobing white lights in a circle. As soon as Igot out of the car and got under it, then it started moving shortly after I hoppedout. Then it started moving back the way I came, except at an angle.So I got back in the car, turned around and started chasing it. Then all of asudden, we were chasing it and we were looking and there were two more sets oflights! One coming from the left and one coming from the right, both lookinglike they are going to intersect with the one we were currently following. Wekept following it and then it just kept getting farther and farther away real quick.Then that one pretty much just shot out of view. I mean, just took off!When I was under the one UFO, I hopped out and it was real close, but thelights were just a hair too bright for me to make out any kind of structure to it,any type of metallic plates or anything like that. But I did make a note therewere no cars driving by at the time, so it was real quiet. I did make the mentalnote to see if I could hear the whir of any propellers or anything, but there wasjust no sound.YOU DID THAT BY TURNING THE WINDOW DOWN TO LISTEN?No, I got out of the car and was standing under it looking straight up at it. I wasdirectly under it.NO SOUND AT ALL?No sound.DESCRIBE THE CONFIGURATION OF THE LIGHTS YOU WERE SEEING?OK, the white strobing lights were in a circle. The circle was laying horizontaland then there was a red or blue light on top and a red or blue light on thebottom. I can't remember which was which.AND COULD YOU SEE THE WHITE LIGHTS STROBING IN A CIRCLE?Ye s , I c o u l d ."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"SO EVEN WITH THAT ABNORMAL LIGHT ACTIVITY ABOVE YOU, YOUSTILL COULD NOT HEAR ANYTHING?No.HOW HIGH WAS THAT OBJECT THAT YOU GOT OUT TO LISTENCOMPARED TO AIR TRAFFIC?It was low. I have seen personal airplanes fly that low, but unless someone hasone that can hover and has strobing, spinning lights on it and makes no sound.That's the only way I can see that happening.ALSO, TO HELP US UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU SAY SPINNING,STROBING LIGHTS UNDERNEATH THIS IN A CIRCLE, IS THEREANYTHING I HAVE SEEN?Your strobing Christmas lights. The light up at the beginning of the cord flashesfirst and then goes toward the end of the cord flashing one at a time, like boom,boom, boom. Boom. That's the best way I can describe it but in a circle, though.A chasing light that was chasing itself pretty much in a circle is what it lookedlike.I used to live in Florida, but I did get to see all your space shuttles. I've seenthem. I've seen your military jets and stuff, but I've never seen anything like this.It's mind boggling.
