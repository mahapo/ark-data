She had beenseen alive the afternoon before and was discovered twenty-four hours later at 3 p.m., deadand mutilated. The unborn foal's back legs were still in the mare's abdomen, but its headseemed melted away by some incomprehensible force. The mare was the granddaughter of a Grand Champion American quarter horse and wasworth at least $5,000. Her owner who has requested anonymity has been raising quarterhorses for more than forty years and this spring has about 100 head in her pastures.Thirty-four of those were pregnant and being watched over by a ranch hand. On Thursday,May 20th, he counted them and realized one was missing. So he went to look for thepregnant mare.Ranch Hand Who First Found Mare and Foal on Thursday, May 20, 2004, Around 3p.m. Central: \"Well, when I went down there, the eyes were completely gone. The tonguewas gone. The mouth was pried open and the colt was half way out, but there was no headto it.THE MARE WAS ON HER BACK WITH FOUR LEGS UP IN THE AIR?Yeah, she was on her back, but one leg was laying on the ground and the other three wereup in the air.THE FOAL COULD YOU DESCRIBE WHAT WAS STILL INSIDE OF THE MARE ANDTHE CONDITION OF THE HEAD?The head on the colt was completely gone. There wasn't no head.WERE YOU LOOKING AT NECK BONE?Just shoulders is all you could see. Everything else was gone.DO YOU MEAN THAT THE NECK BONE AND SKULL HEAD WERE NOT THEREEITHER?Right, they were not there. And there were two round holes in the stomach and one by thechest. (The next day on Friday, May 21, 2004, the veterinarian found pieces of skull andneck bone on the ground that were strangely mushy and smooth.)IN THE MARE?Yeah. And there weren't no tracks. No blood.WAS THERE ANY EXCISIONS FROM THE BODY OF THE YOUNG BABY ASIDE"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"FROM THE HEAD? WERE THERE ANY CUTS ON THE FOAL?I couldn't tell for sure. I didn't examine it thoroughly.AS YOU STOOD STARING AT THIS SCENE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT MIGHTHAVE HAPPENED, WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND?I didn't know for sure! It was kind of weird. I haven't seen anything like that. It's strangebecause usually when you have a carcass laying around - we've probably got 100 to 200coyotes. You can hear them out there at night. They wasn't even up there (at the ravinewhere the mare and colt were dragged) at all. Like the birds they didn't have nothing to dowith them. There was no coyote tracks or nothing. It's a strange deal. I haven't quite figuredit out yet.\" Mare's Owner ShockedI asked the owner if in her nearly half century of raising quarter horses had she ever seenan unborn foal with a missing head - from a mother whose eyeballs, tongue, teats and vulvawere also missing?Owner of Dead Mare and Foal Who Has Raised American Quarter Horses for MoreThan Forty Years: \"Never. I've had horses hit by lightning. I've had foals that aremummified in the mares from absorption. I've had all kinds of odd births. I've had all kindsof different things happen, but nothing comes even close. All those other things wereexplainable. This is not explainable. There is nothing like it.The excision the one in the stomach was so perfectly round it would I couldn't draw a circlethat round. It was just perfect.DID ANYONE AROUND YOU OR ON YOUR PROPERTY NOTICE ANYTHINGUNUSUAL IN TERMS OF LIGHT OR SOUND BETWEEN MAY 19 AND MAY 21?No. I'm the only person here. It's very quiet here. My dogs would bark if there wasanything unusual going on.AND NO BARKING EVEN?No barking.\" Veterinarian Thinks Technology That RemovedMare's Vulva Destroyed Foal's SkullThe owner called her local veterinarian who has seen three previous unusual animal deathsin cattle since 1995. But the vet who also requested anonymity was not prepared for theinexplicable foal's missing head. It looked as if only the foal's head had been subjected tointense energy while the rest of the unborn body was unaffected. And the mare hadsuffered bloodless excisions that law enforcement over the past 50 years has called the\"animal mutilation\" mystery.Local Veterinarian Examined the Mare and Foal Remains on Friday Afternoon, May21, 2004, Approximately 26 Hours After Dead Animals Discovered: \"I think theprocedure used to amputate the vulva (of the mare) and probably part of the vaginalsphincter that procedure caused damage to the tissue of the (foal's) head such that it was...HEATED UP?Well, rapid decomposition, that's the only thing I can tell you, just mushy.HEATED OR MELTED?I don't know that term would be accurate.BUT SOME HOW HEAT WAS APPLIED WHEN THE VULVA TISSUE WASREMOVED?I wouldn't say that was accurate either.THAT WE DON'T KNOW.We just don't know. Looking at the other cases that I've seen and looking at the edges ofthe tissue trying to determine what technique was used, I don't know. No sign of singeing or"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"burning. No evidence of normal cutting action like you would use with a sharp instrument.Of course, no sign of blood because all the blood from these animals had been removed. Ithink that because the foal was close to being delivered maybe just hours away from beingborn that the technology used in the removal of the vulva inadvertently destroyed throughsome means the flesh of the foal's head.THAT WAS DOWN IN THE BIRTH CANAL.That was down in the birth canal and it was just inadvertent that the head tissue wasaltered. What method? I don't know. When I look at it and I have handled it with protectivegloves on and it's like the consistency of runny oatmeal. It's like it had been in a pressurecooker for a long period of time. (Also, the uterine sac that would have encased the foalwas not found.)The mare had both eyeballs were missing. The tongue was missing clear back to itsattachment back in the base of the throat. The udder had been removed. The vulva andvaginal sphincter had been removed and there was a small incision made in the midline ofthe abdomen one that in looking at it, my first impression was that I was looking at thesame excision made on a 650-pound heifer, the first animal I had witnessed.AS A MUTILATION.Yes, I had gone through this and the first thing I came to my mind was what I call a 'spaycut.' It's an incision you would make to perform a hysterectomy and the location is criticalso you can exteriorize the entirety of the ovaries and uterus for excision.WERE YOU ABLE TO CONFIRM IN THAT OTHER (HEIFER) CASE THAT AHYSTERECTOMY HAD ACTUALLY BEEN DONE?Ye s .AND WERE YOU ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT THE MARE HAD BEENEXSANGUINATED ALL THE BLOOD HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THE MUSCLETISSUE?Ye s .THE MUSCLE TISSUE WAS PALE P INK-WHITE?Ye s .THAT'S UNUSUAL IN ITSELF, ISN'T IT?Very unusual, but it's been the case with the four that I have seen. The technique used onthese animals is very exquisite. Something that I don't know if we have the technology toduplicate. So using the term 'mutilation' is really a very inaccurate term and does injustice.People hear that and they think weirdoes or cult people, but these things that happen arenot things that humans can duplicate.The first incident that I saw nine years ago this month (June 1995), the heifer that wewalked up to was lying in grass that was about knee-deep. And there was no lodged overgrass there was no grass that had been stepped on and bent over, either by the calf herselfor anything else. It was as though she had been floated and laid down where she was. Itwas disturbing.WHY ARE YOU AND OTHER VETERINARIANS RELUCTANT TO SPEAK ON THERECORD?Because of the highly unusual nature of what takes place. The fact that it's a secretiveoccurrence. And when you consider the possibilities after a logical evaluation of what youdo have, the choices on who is responsible are narrow and disturbing. And here are the twomost logical possibilities: that we have alien beings in spacecraft that are coming here fromsome place else. Or we have demonic beings that are already here and have been heresince the beginning.AND EITHER WAY, A PROFESSIONAL VETERINARIAN DOES NOT WANT TO GETNEAR THAT KIND OF SUBJECT MATTER BECAUSE IT COULD JEOPARDIZEYOUR CAREER?Maybe not so much a career, but it could (affect) your business!WELL, THAT WOULD BE YOUR CAREER.Yes, you would have to go somewhere else. I recently went to a conference where therewere many veterinarians there. I took a private survey and even then, I had to be careful"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"how I approached some of them and inquired if they had any experience with mutilations.There were several. I would say the majority of small town country veterinarians those whodo rural food animal practice had had personal experience with these things. Most don'ttalk with anybody, not even their wives about it.THEY DON'T BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID WHAT WILL HAPPEN?I suppose it's the unknown, probably more than worry about ridicule. It's the unknown.Fear. I don't know, but I know it occurs an awful lot ...BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO GO ON THE RECORD WITH YOUR NAME ANDLOCATION.Not at this point, no.THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT YOU AND MOST VETERINARIANS MAKETHE SAME DECISION AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY IF THIS ANONGOING INTRUSION ON OUR PLANET.They can't prove anything. Even the most thorough of autopsies and investigations havenot provided any answers.MEANING YOU CAN SAY THAT EXCISIONS WERE DONE IN SOME CASES WITHHIGH HEAT, BUT YOU CAN'T PROVE WHAT THE INSTRUMENT WAS OR WHOOPERATED THE INSTRUMENT?Right. Or why.\"More Information:In my 1989 book, An Alien Harvest (See Earthfiles Shop), I discussed a Hope, Arkansasevent in which five pregnant cows were found dead and mutilated in a straight line onMarch 10, 2989. From one of them, its unborn calf - still in the uterine sac - was protrudingfrom a large, bloodless excision in the mother's abdomen.Four of five pregnant heifers found dead and laying in a straight line on theL. C. Wyatt farm near Hope, Arkansas, March 10, 1989. Three had rectum tissue excised in clean,bloodless \"cookie cutter\" ovals. One had an eye removed. Another had an 18-inch by 22-inch section of itsbelly removed from which its unborn calf in the uterine sac was protruding.
