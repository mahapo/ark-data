Interview (cont): Don Ledger, Retired Civil Servant Sound Engineer and TV Producer-Director,Province of Nova Scotia (employed 34 years); and author Maritime UFO Files ©1998, Swissair Down (Flt. 111) © 2000; Dark Object (Shag Harbour) © 2001:Canadian and American Military Investigation for SevenDaysTHESE EVENTS OCCURRED BEGINNING 11:20 P.M. OCTOBER 4, ANDCONTINUED PAST MIDNIGHT INTO OCTOBER 5 FOR HOW LONG?The whole event took place over a period of seven days. I think it was two objects, not justone, which went into the water and made their way out of the sound next to the harbor andtraveled northeast up the coast and settled on the bottom off the mouth of ShelburneHarbor.WHEN YOU SAY THAT, YOU ARE IMPLYING THAT THESE WERE OBJECTS THATWERE INTELLIGENTLY CONTROLLED AND FOR WHATEVER REASONS DIDNOT WANT TO BE OBVIOUS AND WERE USING THE WATER TO HIDE?Yes. They made their way up the coast off the mouth of Shelburne Harbor off an islandthere that is called McNutt's Island. On that island, there is a lighthouse called CapeRoseway Light. Just to the left of that coming back on the extreme left of that islandcoming ashore again you end up on a point called Government Point, the site for CanadianForces Station (CFS) Sheburne about six miles from the town of Shelburne at the mouth ofShelburne Harbour. It's been called Government Point for many years because there hasalways been a military installation there. It's thought to be a Canadian and Americanoceanographic study station to study the North Atlantic. Government Point was"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"IS GOVERNMENT POINT ON McNUTT'S ISLAND?No, Government Point is back on the mainland. You have to imagine the island being aplug in the mouth of the harbor. It's a long inlet. If you were facing out of the harbor, ifyou were going out on the left hand side between McNutt's Island and the point, there is agovernment installation there. At least there was. Right now, it's no longer there.HOW FAR IS McNUTT'S ISLAND AND GOVERNMENT POINT FROM SHAGHARBOUR?They are about 23 miles up the coast northeast from Shag Harbour.SO WHAT HAPPENED AT McNUTT'S ISLAND AND GOVERNMENT POINT?We don't have documentation. All we have is anecdotal evidence of the event throughmilitary sources. There are six or seven who have come forward so far to talk to us aboutthis.What apparently happened is that these two objects came up and settled on the bottom inabout 80 feet of water on the magnetic detection grid off of Government Point, which wasthought to be some kind of mundane government oceanographic study installation. But itturned out to be a undersea sonar monitoring base for the U. S. Navy. SUSA was theunderwater listening microphone system set up in the North Atlantic. It was TOP SECRETfor years and did not become public knowledge in Nova Scotia until about 1988.It was only in 1967 that any Canadian military were even involved in the work at theGovernment Point base. For the most part, we were just ancillary - guarding, doing thecleanups and cooking the food. But eventually, the Canadians ended up sharing theoperation of the base up to about 1994, after which it was closed.WHAT YOU MEAN IS THAT THE AMERICANS WERE DOMINATINGGOVERNMENT POINT IN NOVA SCOTIA?They were. They owned it at that point. They bought it and got rights to use it starting backaround 1949.SO, THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT BOUGHT AND CONTROLLEDGOVERNMENT POINT?They brought the cables in from the North Atlantic. They had microphones salted all theway over from Russia and Greenland and down around Labrador, right down the coastinto Government Point and then down as far as the New England area. They could pick upthe propeller noises and hull noises of ships passing through the water. They couldtriangulate by using the microphones.SO THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT WAS VERY AWARE OF ANY SOUND, ANYVIBRATION, THAT WAS OCCURRING UNDERNEATH THE WATER ATGOVERNMENT POINT AND BEYOND?Oh, for sure!HAVE YOU EVER HAD ANYBODY TELL YOU, ON OR OFF THE RECORD, ABOUTWHAT THEY HEARD FROM GOVERNMENT POINT THE NIGHT ALL OF THISWAS OCCURRING WITH THESE OBJECTS UNDER WATER?Never. Never got anybody to talk about that. Don't forget, this was still a really well keptsecret up to 1988 and the base continued to run full blast until 1994.The reason for it closing out was because in 1994, Johnny Walker the spy in the UnitedStates was caught and it was discovered that for seventeen years he had been feedinginformation about this particular base and other bases like it to the Soviets. So, they knewwhat was going on. But by 1994, it was a mute point because the Berlin Wall was alreadydown. Russians Tricked American Underwater Listening NetworkThe Russians were able to use the American underwater microphone system for overseventeen years to their advantage by simulating hull signatures. It's almost funny! TheAmerican Naval authorities for many years thought the Russians had four times morenuclear submarines than the American fleet and it was a big concern to them. It turned outthe two countries had about the same number of submarines, but the Russians were faking"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"new hull signatures every time they came up because they knew the Americans werelistening to them (from Government Point).THE SOVIETS WERE MAKING IT SOUND LIKE THEY HAD MORE SUBMARINESTHAN THEY DID?Yes. They would have a submarine out on a mission that the Americans already knewabout. They were able to record the hull sounds. They would get them and computerizethem and they could get a signature on them and apply a code name for it. I talked to a guyone time who had worked on this years before I got involved in UFOs and did not evenrealize I knew what I knew until the Shag Harbour incident came along. Then it came backinto my head again. But the Russian submarines would go back to port, they would put thething up in dry dock, maybe change the prop and put a little bit different pitch on it, weldsomething on the hull to change the sound of the hull going through the water, maybe evenput a squeaky ball bearings into it and then put it back to sea again. It would be heard (bythe Americans) and they would think, 'Aha, another one!'OUR GOVERNMENT WOULD ASSUME IT WAS YET A DIFFERENT SUBMARINE.Exactly. And they assigned it another code name. Once the Americans found out about theRussians knew all about it, their cover was blown. But it still did not blow the value ofknowing that when something was moving around the ocean the magnetic anomalydetection grid was a little more refined than that. It was not as widespread. It did not goway up in the North Atlantic. It just covered along the Continental Shelf from aboutLabrador down into New England. What it did is that it was laid out in a grid underwater.When a vessel, a hull, passed over the top of it, it would make an anomaly in the grid. Inother words, it would show up as a magnetic source in the grid. All it had to be was somekind of metal hull - even the engine block would do it.AFTER OCTOBER 4, 1967, WERE ANY MAGNETIC ANOMALIES PICKED UPFROM THE OBJECTS HIDING UNDER THE WATER NEAR GOVERNMENT POINT?No, I can't claim that. Maybe they did. I don't know for sure. We never were able todiscover that. But military investigators were sitting right on top of the underwater objects.And don't forget, back in 1967, we only had a 12 mile protection limit, even for themilitary in those days. There was no 200 mile limit like we have today.IF THEY DID NOT PICK UP A MAGNETIC ANOMALY THAT YOU HAVE BEENABLE TO CONFIRM, HOW DID ANYONE KNOW THAT THE TWO OBJECTSWERE UNDERWATER OFF OF GOVERNMENT POINT?Apparently, they did. I'm not saying they did not. I'm just saying we have no proof thatthey did. I'm pretty sure they did pick up magnetic anomalies. I would be very surprised ifthey did not. But our information comes from people who were in the area at the time andwere in on the operation, which is what I'll be talking about at the crash retrievalconference in Las Vegas. Unidentified Aerial Objects Trackedfrom Siberia Over Arctic to Shag HarbourIn fact, they gave us some of the details we did not know before about the original object/scoming in from over Siberia into North American airspace and scaring the hell out ofeverybody.SO THESE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS ORIGINATED FROM SIBERIA BEFORE THEYCAME DOWN IN SHAG HARBOUR AND THEN WENT UP THE COAST INTOGOVERNMENT POINT?Two of the military personnel who told us about this told us that the objects made a halforbit and came in over Siberia and then came across the Arctic Circle and down intoCanadian airspace. \"Things Not From This World\" UnderwaterWHAT DID PEOPLE SAY THEY KNEW WAS OCCURRING OFF OF GOVERNMENTPOINT?To narrow it right down, there were two objects on the bottom in 80 feet of water. Therewere seven government vessels, at least seven, parked over these things for about seven"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"days while they could get government assets into the area. They observed the objects usingdivers. 80 feet of water - that's not very deep, not for diving. Pictures were taken andobservations were made. At one point, whether suspicious or not, there was apparently aSoviet submarine that was testing the 12 mile limit and made a run at the post. Several ofour vessels departed to give chase or defend, and these \"things\" under the water thenstarted to move. They moved back down again to the Shag Harbour area.THE TWO UNIDENTIFIEDS UNDER THE WATER MOVED FROM GOVERNMENTPOINT BACK TO SHAG HARBOUR?Ye s .COULD PEOPLE SEE LIGHTS MOVING UNDER THE WATER?Nobody mentioned anything about moving lights under the water, no.ONLY THROUGH MAGNETIC ANOMALIES DID THEY KNOW THAT THESETHINGS WERE MOVING?I'm assuming that (government investigators) knew that, but I don't know for sure becausethere is no documentation on it. We cannot nail it down definitely, but the people who areinvolved and we have no reason to disbelieve them say that this happened.HOW DID PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE DESCRIBING, PHOTOGRAPHING THESEOBJECTS 80 FEET DOWN UNDERWATER WHAT DID THEY SAY WASPHOTOGRAPHED?'Things.' That's as far as they would go. It turned out the divers were from Canadian ForcesBase Shelburne who were keeping an eye on these underwater things. Of those five divers,two have since passed away from cancer. There are three left. One lives up in Cornwallis,Ontario. He won't talk about it. Apparently he was the photographer. The other fellowworks in this area here (Halifax, Nova Scotia). He is an older retired diver and refuses totalk about it. The third guy did talk about it and then shut up after apparently somebodytalked to him.WHAT DID HE SAY?He said they were camped over these things for seven days and keeping an eye on them.They were diving on them and watching them and they were being told to keep theirmouths shut about what they were seeing and were not even allowed to talk about itamong themselves. Some arguments occurred on the support vessel. This is a bit strange,too. This was not just Canadian Navy involved here. Apparently, the American Navy wasconcerned or at least officers from the American Navy. In one particular episode, the diverdescribed where he was reamed out by an American officer on a Canadian ship which hethought was kind of unusual, but apparently that happened back then with the NATOthing.DID ANY OF THESE PEOPLE DESCRIBE WHAT THE OBJECTS LOOKED LIKEAND IF THERE WERE ANY ENTITIES?Oval shaped object, what you would describe as your usual UFO oval shaped objectsabout 60 feet in diameter, two of them on the bottom. One appeared to be givingassistance to the other. That's how they interpreted it. They weren't sure if that was theexact truth of it. But it seemed to them that one was helping the other one. Theneventually, two of the vessels moved up because they were sitting right over the top of theobjects. Somehow that prevented the underwater objects from moving away, buteventually they did move off the bottom, kept going underwater and headed back the sameway they came.Then we have a report from later that evening almost within 1/2 mile of the Shag Harbourincident where two objects climbed out of the water and climbed out over the Gulf ofMaine and disappeared down toward the United States. Two of them came out of the waterat Woods Harbor.SO THAT WAS 7 DAYS AFTER OCTOBER 4, 1967.Yes, on October 11.ON OCTOBER 11, EYEWITNESSES SAW TWO OF THESE OBJECTS COME OUT OFTHE WATER AT SHAG HARBOUR JUST LIKE THEY HAD GONE INTO THE WATERON THE NIGHT OF OCTOBER 4?Only half a mile from where the original sighting took place.DID ANYBODY TELL YOU THAT THEY HAD SEEN ON PHOTOGRAPHS OR ANY"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"OTHER WAY ANY KIND OF ENTITIES UNDER THE WATER ASSOCIATED WITHTHESE ROUND OR OVAL-SHAPED CRAFT?No photographs. But there were anecdotal the divers say they saw 'things' down there.That's as far as they would go with what the shapes not only the objects, but there were'things' working on it. The original cover story was that the government forces were sittingover a Soviet submarine. They were told even the divers were told that this was what itwas a Soviet submarine. This is what you're telling everybody this is what it's going to be.THAT WAS THE COVER STORY.Yes, and an argument ensued in the mess galley while some of the divers were eatingsupper one night. It was an argument between an American officer and this particulardiver about what these 'things' were. The language was kind of strong so I can't repeat itover radio. But the diver who was a bit of a feisty character the one who actually told thestory and showed a great deal of bravado in telling the story eventually he did not backpedal on the story, but would keep his mouth shut. He would not retract it, but he wouldnot talk about it any more either. He said some people talked to him and they told him notto talk about it anymore, so he would not. We had a lot of interference like that while wewere doing this and we still have it happen.IF HE WAS FEISTY, DID HE DESCRIBE WHAT THE 'THINGS' WERE?He did not describe what they looked like. He just said there were 'things,' and they werenot from this world. There were 'things' working on it and they weren't from this world that's the best I can give you (from him). Government Cover-Up of Shag Harbourand Government Point EventsHAS ANYONE GIVEN YOU ANY DOCUMENTS OFFICIALLY OR NOT THATDESCRIBES THESE EVENTS AS WE'VE JUST DISCUSSED?No, that part of the Shag Harbour incident is not documented. The first part of it isdocumented up the ying yang in Shag Harbour, up until the end of the dive is over with.Then there is some more anecdotal evidence about what happened around that time withlocal fishermen. Other odd occurrences such as three submarines parked off the coastsitting out there, which could not have been ours. We only had one at that time and it hadjust returned from England.THAT WAS THE COVER STORY THAT THIS WAS A SOVIET SUB OUT THERE.This is at Government Point. But I'm talking about down in Shag Harbour 3 submarinesjust sitting on the surface. The fishermen saw them out there, maybe 3 or 4 miles justsitting there.YOU MEAN SAW REAL SUBMARINES?Yeah, they saw them out there. The fishermen wondered why the 3 American submarineswould be sitting off Shag Harbour? What were they doing there? Clearly there weresecurity concerns.We are convinced that NORAD must have been aware of something coming into our airspace, particularly since this thing came over Siberia. They scrambled jets up in NorthBay, Ontario, on these things and they scrambled them up at Goose Bay in Labrador tointercept. That's a serious thing to do because North Bay is far enough north as it is rightnow in Ontario and so is Goose Bay in Labrador even further north. When you scramble ajet which in this particular day would have been a F-104, a Star Fighter or something whenyou scramble a jet and pilot out there, you aren't going to see either one of them back ifthey are going to intercept with something half way to the Arctic Circle because there is noway they can get back. They didn't have the fuel for it. It was going to be a cold, lonelydeath up north somewhere.So they scrambled north and then they were recalled when this thing or these things, cametearing in the military sources we have say these things were coming in around 7700 milesper hour, which originally were thought by NORAD to be an ICBM coming in. All thebells and whistles would go off at NORAD when they saw this thing coming, right? Thenall of a sudden, it just stopped and hovered up over Elsmere Island and then it startedcoming back down again. But this time, it's only moving 4400 mph. Then someone recalledtheir jets.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"On May 18, 2001, the Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia Post Office inaugurateda cancellation stamp depicting the October 4-11, 1967 event.
