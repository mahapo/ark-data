To be more computer-upload-friendly, the reprints will be divided into parts.Here begins Part 9 of Status Report VII, from February 1994. Mexican Crashes and U. S. Retrievals?An Alleged Crash in Chihuahua Reveals U. S. Intervention In my series of Status Reports, I have maintained a policy that I would notpublish a major UFO event, including crash/retrievals, from anonymoussources unless it came from an intermediary known to me who, in turn,knew the source. The 1942 crash case and the geriatrics alien exam casereported earlier in this Status Report are examples. Too often, research has been misled by hoaxed reports of UFOcrash/retrievals designed to muddy the waters. But, in my judgment, thereseems to be a legitimacy to the 1974 Chihuahua crash report. Despite therisk of publishing a bunch of baloney, the full text of the report isreproduced herewith, hoping that the incident can be verified or exposedas misinformation. The Chihuahua report came to me from Elaine Douglass of Washington, D.C., officer of Operation Right To Know, who coordinated the picket marchin Washington, D. C., in July 1993. Receiving it in the mail in the summerof 1993, postmarked Santa Ana, California, she said, \"It came probably asa result of publicity following the march.\" The report was entitled Research Findings on the Chihuahua Disk Crash,bore the sender's initials, \"JS,\" and was addressed to \"Deneb TeamMembers\" dated March 23, 1992. When Elaine and I discussed the reportin August 1993, neither of us had seen it published before or knew ofother copies in the hands of researchers. One compelling reason I believe the report is worthy of space in this statusreport is based on my recollection that I had heard of the Chihuahua casebefore, either in the late 1970s or early 1980s. The only detail I vaguelyrecall is that a U. S. military team had covertly crossed into Mexico toretrieve the object. Alleged UFO Crashes in Mexico"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" More on Mexico. I am aware of other incursions into that country. Onewas a naval retrieval in my January 1989 UFO Crash/Retrievals: Is theCover-up Lid Lifting? I reported a case occurring in 1948 when a U. S.naval team from the U.S.S. McKinley docked in San Diego. It was acommand ship, cargo class for amphibious operations, and was dispatchedinto a remote region to retrieve a \"flying saucer.\" According to my firsthandsource who was a messenger aboard the ship, he heard a task force officeron his return say, \"We got some dead bodies and some managed to getaway.\" He also remembers reading a brief item in a San Diego newspaperabout a crash in Mexico. Also of pertinence, when I made my initial disclosure about UFOcrash/retrievals in my Retrievals of the Third Kind at the 1978 MUFONSymposium in Dayton, Ohio, I was informed circuitously by the CIAseveral days in advance that it would be inadvisable for me to revealinformation about UFO crashes in Mexico and West Germany. Actually, I had no reference of Mexican crashes, but neither the CIA noranyone else knew what I had tucked into my status report. Looking back,as I learned more about Mexican expeditions, I suspect that the concernfocused on illegal entries into that country to recover alien craft. Thus, thealleged Chihuahuan crash in 1974 would have been of significance. SeeThe UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome (1980) for reference to the CIAadvisement that I should avoid mention of retrievals of UFO crashes inMexico. Reviewing the text of the report initialed \"JS\" which follows, Ifind that it is authoritatively written, using correct military terminologyand, of note and unlike a hoax, draws a line between so-called \"hardevidence\" and that which is speculative.Research Findings on the Chihuahua Disk Crash - August 25,1974, initialed by JS. \"On 25 Aug. 74 at 2207 hrs., U.S. Air Defense radar detected anunknown approaching U.S. airspace from the Gulf of Mexico.Originally the object was tracked at 2,200 knots (2,530 mph) on abearing of 325 degrees and at an altitude of 75,000 feet - a coursethat would intercept U. S. territory about forty miles southwest ofCorpus Christi, Texas. After approximately sixty seconds ofobservation, at a position 155 miles southeast of Corpus Christi, theobject simultaneously decelerated to approximately 1700 knots(1,955 mph), turned to a heading of 290 degrees, and began a slowdescent. It entered Mexican airspace approximately forty miles southof Brownsville, Texas. Radar tracked it approximately 500 miles to apoint near the town of Coyame in the state of Chihuahua, not farfrom the U. S. border. There the object suddenly disappeared fromthe radar screens. During the flight over Mexican airspace, the object leveled off at45,000 feet and then descended to 20,000 feet. The descent was inlevel steps, not a smooth curve or straight line, and each level wasmaintained for approximately five minutes. Tracked On Two Military Radars The object was tracked by two different military radar installations. Itwould have been within range of Brownsville civilian radar, but it isassumed that no civilian radar detected the object due to a lack ofany such reports. The point of disappearance from the radar screens was over a barrenand sparsely populated area of northern Mexico. At first it wasassumed that the object had descended below the radar's horizon and"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"a watch was kept for any re-emergence of the object. None occurred. At first it was assumed that the object might be a meteor because ofthe high speed and descending flight path. But meteors normallytravel at higher speeds and descend in a smooth arc, not in 'steps.'And meteors do not normally make a thirty-five degree change incourse. Shortly after detection, an air defense alert was called.However, before any form of interception could be scrambled, theobject turned to a course that would not immediately take it over U.S. territory. The alert was called off within twenty minutes after theobject's disappearance from the radar screen. Fifty-two minutes after the disappearance, civilian radio trafficindicated that a civilian aircraft had gone down in that area. But itwas clear that the missing aircraft had departed El Paso internationalwith a destination of Mexico City and could not, therefore, have beenthe object tracked over the Gulf of Mexico. It was noted, however,that they both disappeared in the same area and at the same time. With daylight the next day, Mexican authorities began a search forthe missing plane. Approximately 1035 hours, there came a radioreport that wreckage from the missing plane had been spotted fromthe air. Almost immediately came a report of a second plane on theground a few miles from the first. A few minutes later, an additionalreport stated that the second 'plane' was circular shaped andapparently in one piece although damaged. A few minutes after that,the Mexican military clamped a radio silence on all search efforts. CIA Monitored Mexican Government UFO CrashRetrieval The radio interceptions were reported through channels to the CIA.Possibly as many as two additional government agencies alsoreceived reports, but such has not been confirmed as of this date. TheCIA immediately began forming a recovery team. The speed withwhich this team and its equipment was assembled suggests that thiswas either a well-rehearsed exercise or one that had been performedprior to the event. In the meantime, requests were initiated at the highest levels betweenthe United States and Mexican governments that the U. S. recoveryteam be allowed onto Mexican territory to 'assist.' These requestswere met with professed ignorance and a flat refusal of anycooperation. By 2100 hrs., 26 Aug. 74, the recovery team had assembled and beenstaged at Fort Bliss. Several helicopters were flown in from someunknown source and assembled in a secured area. These helicopterswere painted a neutral sand color and bore no markings. Eyewitnessindicates that there were three smaller craft, very probably UH1Hueys from the description. There was also a larger helicopter,possibly a Sea Stallion. Personnel from this team remained with theircraft and had no contact with other Fort Bliss personnel. Mexican UFO Recovery Team Died - From What? Satellite and reconnaissance aircraft overflight that day indicated thatboth the crashed disk and the civilian aircraft had been removed fromthe crash sites and loaded on flat bed trucks. Later flights confirmedthat the convoy had departed the area heading south. At that point, the CIA had to make a choice: either to allow this"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"unknown aircraft to stay in the hands of the Mexican government; orto launch the recovery team, supplemented by any required militarysupport and take the craft. There occurred, however, an event thattook the choice of of their hands. High altitude overflights indicatedthat the convoy had stopped before reaching any inhabited areas ormajor roads. Recon showed no activity and radio contact between theMexican recovery team and its headquarters had ceased. A lowaltitude, high speed, overflight was ordered. The photos returned by that aircraft showed all trucks and jeepsstopped, some with open doors, and two human bodies lying on theground beside two vehicles. The decision was immediately made tolaunch the recovery team, but the actual launching was held up forthe arrival of additional equipment and two additional personnel. Itwas not until 1438 hrs. that the helicopters departed Fort Bliss. The four helicopters followed the border down towards Presidio andthen turned and entered Mexican airspace north of Candelaria. Theywere over the convoy site at 1653 hrs. All (Mexican) convoypersonnel were dead, most within the trucks. CIA Recovery Team Took Over Disk Some (CIA) recovery team members, dressed in bio-protection suits,reconfigured the straps holding the disk object on the flatbed truck,then attached them to a cargo cable from the Sea Stallion(helicopter). By 1714 hrs., the recovered object was on its way to U.S. territory. Before leaving the convoy site, members of the (CIA)recovery team gathered together the Mexican vehicles and bodies andthen destroyed all with high explosives. This included the pieces ofthe civilian light plane which had been involved in the mid-aircollision. At 1746 hrs., the Hueys departed. The Hueys caught up with the Sea Stallion as it re-entered U. S.airspace. The recovery team then proceeded to a point in the DavisMountains, approximately twenty-five miles northeast of Valentine.There they landed and waited until 0225 hrs. the next morning. Atthat time, they resumed the flight and rendezvoused with a smallconvoy on a road between Van Horn and Kent. The recovered diskwas transferred to a truck large enough to handle it and capable ofbeing sealed totally. Some of the personnel from the Hueystransferred to the convoy. CIA Transported Recovered Disk from Mexico toAtlanta, Georgia All helicopters then returned to their original bases fordecontamination procedures. The convoy continued non-stop, usingback roads and smaller highways and staying away from cities. Thedestination of the convoy reportedly was Atlanta, Georgia. Here the hard evidence thins out. One unconfirmed report says thedisk was eventually transferred to Wright-Patterson A. F. Base.Another says that the disk was either transferred after that to anotherunnamed base, or was taken directly to this unknown base directlyfrom Atlanta. Disk Description The best description of the disk was that it was sixteen feet, five"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"inches in diameter, convex on both upper and lower surfaces to thesame degree, possessing no visible doors or windows. The thicknesswas slightly less than five feet. The color was silver, much likepolished steel. There was no visible lights nor any propulsion means.There were no markings. There were two areas of the rim that showeddamage, one showing an irregular hole approximately twelve inchesin diameter with indented material around it. The other damage wasdescribed as a 'dent' about two feet wide. The weight of the objectwas estimated as approximately one thousand, five hundred pounds(1,500 lbs), based on the effect of the weight on the carryinghelicopter and those who transferred it to the truck. There was noindication in the documentation available as to whether anything wasvisible in the 'hole.' It seems likely that the damage with the hole was caused by thecollision with the civilian aircraft. That collision occurred while theobject was traveling approximately 1700 knots (1,955 mph). Evenignoring the speed of the civilian aircraft, the impact would have beenconsiderable at that speed. This is in agreement with the descriptionof the civilian aircraft as being 'almost totally destroyed.' What wasbeing taken from the crash site were pieces of the civilian aircraft.The second damage might have resulted when the object impactedwith the ground. The speed in that case should have beenconsiderably less than that of the first impact. Disk Occupants? No mention is made of the occupants of the civilian aircraft. It is notknow if any body or bodies were recovered. Considering thedestruction of the civilian light aircraft in mid-air, bodies might wellnot have come down near the larger pieces. Unfortunately, what caused the deaths of the Mexican recovery teamis not known. Speculation ranges from a chemical released from thedisk, as a result of the damage, to a microbiological agent. There areno indications of death or illness by any of the (American) recoveryteam. It would not have been illogical for the recovery team to havetaken one of the bodies back with them for analysis. But there is noindication of that having happened. Perhaps they did not haveadequate means of transporting what might have been a biologicallycontaminated body. Inquiries to the FAA reveal no documents concerning the civilianaircraft crash, probably because it did not involve a U. S. aircraft nordid it occur over U. S. airspace. It should be noted that the above facts do not tell the complete story.Nothing is known of the analysis of the disk craft or its contents.Nothing is known about the deaths associated with the foreign(Mexican) recovery team. Nor is it known if this craft was manned ornot. Other questions also remain, such as why would a recovered disk betaken to Atlanta? And where did the disk come from? It was firstdetected approximately 200 miles from U.S. territory, yet U. S. airdefenses extend to a much greater distance than that. If the objectdescended into the atmosphere, perhaps NORAD space tracking hassome record of the object. Alternate possibility is that it entered theGulf of Mexico under radar limits and then 'jumped' up to 75,000feet. Considering prior behavior exhibited by disks of this size, it isprobable that the entry was from orbital altitude. The facts that are known have been gathered from two eyewitness"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"accounts, documentation illegally copied, and a partially destroyeddocument.
