He radioed for an extra set ofeyes; he got two. Greg Hedrick and Randy Hoover looked skyward; they saw it,too. All three are Huntington law officers, guys who have seen just abouteverything. But this time they didn't know what they were seeing.\"Since that article, the Huntington Police Department was flooded with calls andCNN did a report. I talked with the Assistant Chief of Police, Tom Hughes, andone of the police officers this week who told me, \"We have two people whowork the phones in our dispatch and this dang near shut the police departmentdown. I've got a stack of papers where other people say they saw something, too.What is credible and what is not, I don't know.\"Contrary to some of the explanations of hot air balloon, child's toy mylar UFOballoon or debris floating in the sky, one of the Huntington police officers toldme, 'To me it was a once in a life time deal, what I saw. I don't expect to see"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"anything like that again.\"J amison, PennsylvaniaI also received a drawing of an unusual aerial object seen only a week later onJanuary 1, 2004, in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, suburb of Jamison. BertJanssen from The Netherlands was visiting for the holidays. On New Years Dayaround 4:30 p.m., we both were amazed at a dark object moving slowly in theair not more than a thousand feet above us as we drove on Route 263 near theAlmshouse Road intersection. We watched the object move slowly for nearly aminute and Bert drew the sketch below which closely matches what I saw aswell.Unidentified black aerial object seen at 4:30 p.m. ET on January 1, 2004,in Jamison, Pennsylvania. Drawing by Bert Janssen .Bert, who is an award-winning documentary filmmaker and photographer,signed and dated a report for Earthfiles.com which reads,\"Unidentified black object was seen at approximately 4:30 p.m. ET movingslowly in the sky at an estimated height of 1,000+ feet, on New Year's Day,January 1, 2004. Length of sighting time was 45 seconds to one minute. Ifirst thought the object was a microlight (motorcycle-like body with wingsused in England to photograph crop formations and landscapes.) When wepulled over to the side of the road to watch, the object either changed inform or turned to reveal the profile indicated in the drawing. I thought thelarger circles above the lower circles of the object were 'bat-man-capeshaped,' but did not know how to draw the slightly wing-like curves. Theobject seemed to slowly rise in altitude until it disappeared in the lateafternoon blue-grey sky.\" Roger Sugden in Indiana, who researches crop and ice formations with JeffreyWilson and others in the midwest, called to tell me about The Herald-Pressreport on January 5. He had seen it at UFO researcher Kenny Young's website.Roger visited the newspaper and Huntington Police Department soon after.Roger had hoped to get a copy of the drawing that Huntington Police OfficerChip Olinger had done for his department, but was not successful. I talked withAsst. Chief of Police, Tom Hughes, about Bert Janssen's drawing and wonderedif Mr. Hughes would compare it to Officer Olinger's and an alleged photographfrom an Antwerp, Ohio, couple who told Antwerp police they, too, had seen an"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"unusual black object in the sky before Christmas. I faxed Bert's drawing to TomHughes who shared it with his police officers. Early Thursday morning, January 8, 2004, I was able to talk with one of theHuntington eyewitness police officers to compare his description with BertJanssen's. I learned then that the Ohio photograph showed only a landscape andno detail in the sky. However, when the Huntington police officer saw BertJanssen's drawing, he told me the following:Interview:Huntington, Indiana Police Officer: \"Comparison to what I have here in frontof me, a drawing by Bert Janssen? Yes, from what I'm reading, it's a lot like that,yeah.WHAT IS THIS THING THAT HALF A DOZEN PEOPLE OVER A TWOWEEK PERIOD HAVE SEEN IN THE SKY?I don't know, but at first I thought it was a paraglider that's what it looked to mein the distance the size of it. It was a long ways off, but a beautiful day. Ithought, 'No matter how nice and bright and shiny and blue sky it is, this is aheck of a day to be doing that.' (Such cold temperature.)TO BE UP PARAGLIDING?Yes, those parachutes you can steer. Not a round parachute, but the long, curved they do stunts with them and things like that.BERT JANSSEN'S FIRST REACTION WAS THAT HE WAS LOOKING ATSOMEBODY IN WHAT IS CALLED A MICRO-LIGHT IN EUROPE AND ITS'SORT OF SIMILAR. CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT ELSE HAPPENED ASTHIS THING SEEMED TO ROLL OVER AND CHANGE?It was a graceful, ballet-type move. There was no quick movement or anythinglike that. It was just a nice roll.WHEN IT ROLLED OVER, WHAT DID YOU SEE?It would turn to a flat line, just a small line in the sky, until it completed its roll.After that, it just gradually turned into a circle.IN THE NEWSPAPER IT SAID: \"FIRST, IT LOOKED LIKE A PARACHUTETHAT YOU CAN STEER, BLACK AND CURVED, BUT THERE WASNOBODY IN IT. IT STARTED ROLLING, A SLOW ROLL, AND TURNEDUPSIDE DOWN. THEN IT LOOKED LIKE A GIANT SET OF BIRD WINGS.IT DID MORE ROLLS AND TURNED INTO AN OBLONG CIRCLE THATWAS ORANGE.\"Yes. The bird wing part another of my first impressions were that it was one heckof a big bird because it had tips (on the wings), like two fingers, like a big set ofeagle wings or something. And it rolled and basically turned into an oblongcircle. It was basically rolling all the time.IN BETWEEN, IT WOULD GO INTO A LINE?That's all you could see, a straight line.AND THERE WERE NOT MORE THAN TWO WINGS?No, just one solid there wasn't any body to it just a great big set of wings. If youcut the rest of the bird off in the front part and back part and just had a set ofwings. That's it.AND THEN, WHAT WAS THE TRANSITION OR CHANGE FROM THEWINGS TO THE OBLONG ORANGE?It just did that when it was in its roll. It went from thin line and started gaining a"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"round shape and reflecting sunlight, a blazing orange. At one point, it lookedlike a mirror reflecting light.IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE OBJECT ITSELF COULD HAVE EMITTED THEORANGE LIGHT?Well, I don't know because it was such a beautiful day. The sun was just asbright as could be and the sky was just blue. There wasn't a piece of white in thesky. It was just perfect blue sky, just as clear as can be. And the sun was verybright. I don't think it was emitting its own light. I think it was reflecting it.THIS HAPPENED AT 2:30 P.M. EASTERN TIME, RIGHT?It was between 2:30 to 2:45 p.m. ET.YOU WATCHED THIS FOR HOW LONG?Not very long. The whole thing might have lasted half a minute to 45 seconds. Itwasn't anything fast. It was a graceful movement across the sky.WHEN OR HOW DID THIS DISAPPEAR?Well, it reached the church steeple and was going across the roof line headedeast and when it got to the church steeple, I lost sight of it. Other people thatsaw it said it headed straight north from the church steeple. Well, that wouldhave put the church steeple between me and it. And I never saw it again.DID IT PAUSE OVER THE CHURCH STEEPLE?No. It wasn't above the church steeple. I thought it was going to get wrappedaround the church steeple. I thought it was going to hit it. It's a pretty tallsteeple, but it wasn't that far off the roof line.THEN THE PART THAT TURNED FROM THE ONE SET OF WINGS AND ITTURNED, DID IT IMMEDIATELY FLASH OR BECOME THE ORANGESUNLIGHT OR WHATEVER?Yes. Whenever it turned oblong, that's when it reflected light. But after it turnedoblong, it only did that during three or four rolls, and then it turned to just ablack spot, not reflecting anything.DID IT START OFF AS A BLACK SPOT WHAT WAS IT?A black parachute-looking paraglider type thing. The wing part was black. It wasnot until it turned oblong did it show any kind of color. Then once it got to acertain size, it turned into a black circle.IT STARTED OUT LIKE A PARAGLIDER LIKE THAT PART THAT LIFTS INTHE AIR. THEN WHEN IT TURNED, THE PARASHOOT PART SEEMEDTO CHANGE INTO A SET OF WINGS?Yeah. It was after it rolled a few times like that. As it got closer, then it lookedlike it had two fingers on the end of it (like a bird). And it wasn't quite as square(or rectangular)-looking. It had rounded edges like a bird's wing.YOU SAW THIS THING ROLL HOW MANY TIMES?I'd say three or four times when it looked like a paraglider; three or four timeswhen it looked like a wing no, maybe it rolled only two different times when itlooked like a wing; then when it turned oblong. Basically that's what it did, justkept turning, just a graceful. Didn't go up or down, nothing fast. It just rolledlike it was a ballet.It was something I like watching science fiction stuff. One of my favorite moviesis The Day The Earth Stood Still. That used to scare me when I was a little kid.But I'd never seen anything like that. Basically I hoped other people would see itso we could find out what it was. But we never expected anything like the pagesand pages and pages of calls our dispatch received! People have even ridiculed"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"us for reporting it.THE THING ABOUT IT IS THAT UNUSUAL THINGS IN THE SKY THATARE NOT EXPLAINED, ESPECIALLY IN A TIME OF TERRORISM ISSOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY REPORTERS, POLICE AND CITIZENS SHOULD BE PAYING ATTENTION TO - WHAT IS IN THE SKIES ANDREPORTING THEM. NOBODY SHOULD BE RIDICULED. IT ISSOMETHING THAT EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT. AND HEREWE'VE GOT THREE STATES: OHIO, INDIANA AND PENNSYLVANIA IN ATWO WEEK PERIOD IN WHICH APPARENTLY PEOPLE HAVE SEENSOMETHING ODD IN THE SKY. SO WHAT IS IT?I agree with you wholeheartedly. Everybody should be aware of everything thatis going on around them. But things get so out of hand. At times, I wish I hadnever seen it because what it caused is just I've got people who are mad at me. Itjust caused more than what we ever anticipated.I'M GLAD I GOT TO TALK WITH YOU IN MORE DETAIL AND YOU GOTTO SEE THE DRAWING.There might be something related because this thing was headed east. Ohio andPennsylvania are both east of here.THAT'S RIGHT.Where it originated from? Who knows. And it was absolutely calm that day. Itwas absolutely calm. I mean, it was a beautiful, bright, sunny pure blue day aspure as a robin's egg. There wasn't enough wind to push it along, I thought. But,up higher maybe there is.The church sits on a big hill, the highest point in town. And where I was sittingwas one of the lowest points (police station parking lot in his car), right down atriver level. So, we're talking 300 to 400 feet off the ground, probably.SO, THE TOP OF THE CHURCH STEEPLE MIGHT HAVE BEEN 300 TO400 FEET HIGH?Well, the roof of the church compared to where I was setting down in the valleybecause we're in the Wabash Valley we're basically sitting on the riverbed of theWabash Valley and the church is on one of the upper sides. Yeah, it wasprobably that high off the ground. If it was straight above me, it would havebeen that high above the ground, but seeing how it was to the north, the churchwas above me also.YOU THOUGHT THIS OBJECT MIGHT EVEN COLLIDE WITH THECHURCH STEEPLE?Yeah, I thought it was going to get hung up on it, or run into it. But it didn't. Itwent behind it and partially disappeared. I mean, as it went behind it but itdidn't come out the other side. That's what I should say. It just didn't come outthe other side.SO YOU SAW WHAT SEEMED TO BE AN OBLONG OBJECT LARGEENOUGH TO BE A PARAGLIDER AND IT SEEMED TO BE HEADEDTOWARD THE STEEPLE AND YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD COLLIDE, BUTIT NEVER CAME OUT THE OTHER SIDE.No, it went to the church steeple and went behind it, but never came out theother side. I talked to another guy who called later a few days afterward. He is apilot. He chased it. He saw basically the same thing and he compared it to thesize of the model of some aircraft. I think it was a Cessna in comparison of size.But he ran out of road and lost it.SOMETHING THE SIZE OF A CESSNA IS PRETTY BIG.I thought it was pretty big. A back yard kid's trampoline is pretty big."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"What was printed by the Herald Press that reporter, they contacted the localairports which are basically about 25 miles east of here like around Fort Wayne,Indiana they have several smaller airports and their large one has radarcapabilities. None of them said they saw anything.We saw it. One of the guys (police officer) here. He still thinks it was just a bigpiece of Mylar or something.WHAT DO YOU THINK?I don't know. I don't know. I don't think it was something being driven byanybody. I don't think that at all. It didn't other than being round at the end, itwas round, but it had no thickness. There was no thickness. Just thick enough tosee it looked like a straight line (before it rolled and turned into round blackcircle). Just enough to be visible as being black. There was no thickness to it.BUT WHEN IT HAD LIKE A BIRD WITH THE FRONT AND BACKCHOPPED OFF AND BIG WINGS, I WOULD ASSUME IT HAD SOMEDIMENSION TO IT.It was a curved dimension. It was always curved at that point. It was eithercurved with a hump or curved with a belly. It was just like rolling a horse shoe.WHEN YOU FIRST SAW IT, DO YOU THINK IT WAS ABOUT THE SAMEALTITUDE OF 300 TO 400 FEET?It never gained or lost or anything. It just stayed the same height. It changedshape as it got closer, but it was large enough that it looked like a paraglider offin the distance and I just thought as nice a day as it is, whoever that guy is doingthat, they are crazy because I wouldn't be out there. It was fairly cold, youknow? Even though it was beautiful out. We do have hot air balloon enthusiastsaround here and they go up in those things all the time, but they are all realcolorful.IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE YOU WOULD MISTAKE A HOT AIR BALLOONWITH WHAT YOU SAW AND ARE DESCRIBING.No, I know what a hot air balloon is. There is a local group here called 'CloudChasers' and they go up all the time.THIS WAS NOT A HOT AIR BALLOON?No, it made no noise. There was no noise. There wasn't anything except forreflection. But then that stopped and it was just a big, black circle up there. Doyou know what a kid's back yard trampoline looks like?RIGHT.That's about the size it gained, and it could have been a bit bigger than that. Butthat's what I'm guessing the size was.SO IT ENDED UP LOOKING LIKE A PERFECTLY ROUND, BLACKCIRCLE?Right. With no color other than dark. It wasn't jet black. It was just a deep, deepgrey. There was no physical features other than a round dot. There was no depthto it. You couldn't see through it or anything like that. But there was noevidence of any kinds of lines in it or anything.WAS THE DARK CIRCLE THE PART THAT ENDED UP LOOKING LIKE ITWAS GOING TO COLLIDE WITH THE CHURCH STEEPLE?Right. It was like it rolled and turned sideways and then it just I thought it wasgoing to get hung up on the church, on the steeple. But it went behind it andthat's the last I saw of it. At that point is when the other fellow (pilot) chased it.He was headed north on a street. He had seen it coming and turned and hechased it until he ran out of road. He is the one who said it was the size of a"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Cessna or some kind of airplane. He said, 'I'm a pilot.' It interested him enoughto chase it with his car.DID HE DESCRIBE THE SAME TRANSFORMATIONS, ROLLING ANDCHANGING INTO THE SHAPES THAT YOU SAW?Yes. But he kind of thought it was some kind of reflective stuff. But he readwhat was in the paper and called in and said, 'I saw it and chased it.' I talked tohim and it's nothing I can back up about exactly what he saw. He compared it tothe size of an airplane.BUT HE AS A PILOT COULD NOT RECOGNIZE THIS AERIAL OBJECT,RIGHT?He could not recognize? No, he didn't know what it was either. But it was hedidn't go into detail about what it did while he was watching it becauseevidently, he saw it come to the church area and head north and the street hewas on was a north street only just a couple of blocks from me. And it goes upto the higher part of town the same level as the church and he just ran out ofroad.IN THAT WHOLE TIME THOUGH, HE NEVER RECOGNIZED IN THE AIRWHAT HE WAS LOOKING AT - BUT HE COMPARED IT TO THE SIZE OFA CE SSNA?Yes. He can't and didn't give any explanation. He said size-wise, it looked thesize of a Cessna. Or I should say, a Cessna or whatever. Being a pilot, they talkin a different lingo, 'small passenger plane.'HE AT LEAST DID SAY HE SAW IT ROLL AND CHANGE SHAPE LIKEYOU DID?He saw it reflect color. I can't recall whether he saw it rolling or what. I don'tthink it was going any faster, or he wouldn't have been able to follow it.RIGHT, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE SLOW FOR HIM TO KEEP GOINGALONG IN A CAR, WOULDN'T IT?And it was a 30 mph zone. It's just a local city street. You wouldn't dare get anyspeed up.TO BE FOLLOWING IT TOWARD THE CHURCH, HE WOULD HAVE TOBE RISING IN ALTITUDE TOWARD WHATEVER THE OBJECT WAS.Right. I think that's why he said it was losing altitude. And he was going to tellhis local flying buddies to keep an eye out for something flying around, to keepa look out for a big hunk of something in someone's tree or field or whatever.Also, a lady called in and said they had one of these child's toy balloons thathad gotten loose from them. I guess they fill them with helium and it got loosefrom them and that's what we saw. But they are only about three feet wide.THAT WOULD NOT BE THE SIZE OF A CESSNA PLANE.No.SO, RIGHT THERE, YOU'VE GOT A CONTRADICTORY REPORT FROM APILOT.Yeah. One of the other people down here who saw it said to him it just lookedlike a big piece of tissue. So, we didn't know what it was, but it's unusual.TISSUE WOULD NOT END UP BEING A PERFECT DARK CIRCLE.I can't explain all that. To me it was a once in a life time deal, what I saw. I don'texpect to see anything like that again.\""},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
