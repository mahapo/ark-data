June 7, 2004 Antigua, Guatemala - About half the people on Earth might be able to seeVenus move as a small black dot across the disc of the sun on June 8, 2004. It takes aboutsix hours and you need a sun filter to protect your eyes. Astronomers have seen the rareevent only five times before in the 18th and 19th centuries. For U.S. East Coast observers,the transit is underway at sunrise and ends around 7:25 a.m. EDT. The starting and endingtimes are listed for major cities at http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/Venus2004.pdf. \"We are now on the eve of the second (Venus) transit of a pair, after which there willbe no other till the twenty-first century of our era has dawned upon the earth, andthe June flowers are blooming in 2004... What will be the state of science when thenext transit season arrives (June 8, 2004), God only knows.\"- William Harkness, U. S. Naval Observatory Astronomer, 1882 1882 photograph of Venus transit (black dot) across sun.Photograph from U. S. Naval Observatory. Technically, the transit begins on June 8, 2004, around 05:13 Universal Time (U.T.) andends around 11:25 U.T. However, 5:13 a.m. on June 8 in Greenwich is actually late atnight on June 7 for some North American time zones.

Two weeksago, he wrote about the upcoming Venus transit for Saq' Be.' Saq' Be' in the Mayanlanguage means \"White Road of the Sacred Path\" and also is the name of the dense centerstars of our galaxy known as the \"Milky Way.\" Carlos has been given the mission by hiselders to share Mayan prophecies and teachings with the world in order to generateawareness and support for the rescue and preservation of the ancient Mayan tradition in hishomeland. Carlos is also the author of Kam Wuj: El Libro del Destino, an out of print bookon the astrology and prophecies of the Mayans.Saq' Be' is a non-profit organization and website based in Santa Fe, New Mexico, dedicatedto the study and communication of ancient Mayan knowledge and traditions. With thepermission of Adam Rubel, Co-Director of Saq' Be,' here is a reprint of the Englishtranslation from the original May 24, 2004, Spanish text by Mayan priest, Carlos Barrios.\"THE PATH OF VENUS OVER THE FACE OF THE SUN © 2004 by Carlos Barrios, Mayan Ajq' ij For the Mayan world, the planet Venus has been one of the most predominantCelestial phenomena as well as one which entire centuries of observation have beendedicated to. It can almost be said that the ancestral Mayan Wise men had anobsession with Venus. The earliest written accounts on this subject are found in thefirst pages of the sacred book of the Maya-Quiche nation, the POPOL WUJ. Itdescribes how Wukub Kaquix (one of the original names for Venus) tried to takeover the place of the Father Sun. This happened in a previous humanity, and relatescataclysms and destruction caused by Wukub Kaquix and by his sons Cabracan andZipacna. This destruction included the predominant incarnation of humanity of thattime, the 'Men of Wood.' In the same way the oral tradition of the Elders describes to us: 'millions of years agoVenus suffered the crash of another celestial body that provoked the destruction ofthe latter (perhaps by an asteroid?), at the same time taking Venus out of its orbit.This provoked a series of cataclysms and readjustments in the planetary system, onthe way to its current orbit and due to its proximity to the terrestrial orbit. It changedthe rectitude of the Mother Earth (the terrestrial axis?). It also tried to take over theSun's position, since it seemed bigger than any other celestial body in the skies and itoutshone the Sun and the Moon. Furthermore, they where no longer visible, and itspride and vanity grew to a point that it demanded the humanity of that time toworship it and pay tribute to its children, who could raise the mountains in one night(Zipacna) and destroy them on the next day (Cabracan) . This is how this humanity, the Men of Wood, lived mistakenly in their end, until theGreat HUN AB KU intervened and set it on its place. This way the Great Father Sungot its power back and the Moon appeared at night. Now when Venus is seen, it isonly announcing that the Father Sun is coming and its (Venus's) power has beenreduced to being the first star to be seen at night. In few words, this is the story ofVenus told in the year 1987 by Don Pascual , who was one of the highest Wise menof the Eagle Clan of the MAM nation, the most ancient next to Qanjobal in the greatMayan civilization.Aside from predictions based on the Sacred calendar (TZOLKIN or CHOLKIJ), theMAYAN CODEX ,the KUMATZIN WUJ JUN (better known as the Dresden codex)contains descriptions of the rituals for some of the Mayan Deities, as well ascalculations for a few thousand years for Solar and Lunar eclipses. The codexespecially contains the charts for the calculations of the cycles of Venus, its transitover the face of the Father Sun. This codex is proof of the amazing astronomicalknowledge and mathematics in Mayan writing. The fascination of scientists andmystics has been limited, because few of them know the real meaning of the contextof this extraordinary document. Regarding the sinodic phases, cycles and transit ofVenus, they only confirm the close attention (almost obsessive) that the Mayan worldhad about this planet. The apparent Path of Venus over the face of the Father Sun (an ecliptic transit inrelation to the Sun) has announced drastic changes in the Earth, from cataclysms,wars, destruction (lack of food, plagues, etc.) to historical changes regarding theevolutionary development of both human beings and the Mother Earth (a destinythat is connected although not intertwined). Now that we are at the gates of a New Path of Venus over the Face of the Sun onJune 7-8 2004, the least we can do is expect a new change in the outcome ofhumanity. Death is knocking at our doors. The drums of war can be heard."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Intransigence, the destruction of our Mother Earth, pollution, new diseases, theresurging of old plagues, global warming, the fear of world conflict, intolerance andfundamentalism in any of its manifestations, negligence, apathy, the confusion orworst still the extreme estrangement of drug abuse. All of this is a reaction to the fearcaused by the thought that the world as we know it can be destroyed, and to the pooranswers that materialism gives, having reached its limit and offering no otherdirection, because it is based in distractions, in momentary satisfactions. Whilereason and logic tell us that we have to stop all this madness, we are living in the ageof prophecies, and the responsibility of balancing things is ours. There is no moretime to play; it is know time to act.Venus is for the Mayan world the messenger; it brings its share of events that do nothappen from one day to the other, those that are irreversible. It is the announcementof change. The movements that are being organized for this date (ceremonies,meditation, fasting, etc.) are important and are aimed towards a new path for as weknow them. We can minimize Pluto's energy and especially Orion's energy, both ofwhich provoke violence and destruction, because they move the rest of the planetstowards chaos.The Mayan Cross for this day tells us that this day's energy is preceded by the hiddenmagic of the Aj Itz (Black Magicians) to create chaos. The heart manifests powerover the mind, and a powerful and psychic energy which carries violence. Destinyshows that great authorities reveal themselves and uncover their sins, and a newauthority will come that will change the path of things. However, this can be painful(unless we are prepared and willing). In the material hemisphere, forgiveness and sinsurge in their highest expression. A balance in the spiritual hemisphere starts to surgefrom duality (this is if we are prepared and willing). Conditions to plant a newdestiny are created. The Great Ajaw, the Father Sun, goes hunting. This means thatin the hope of making a balance between the forces of the positive and the negative,we can count upon that magnificent assistance. There are payments, but the net is willing to contain the destruction of themanifestation of the material reality. The regent carrier is the one of wisdom. Theother part carries an energy with a great deal of strength (violent).The pyramid of forgiveness and sin that rules the material world; that has ruled for allthese years, has the law in its heart, authority of the beginning (hope), its crest (head)has the energy of the number seven (this number gives access the knowledge ofmagic within the material) and its bases give us the winal the twenty that is thenumber of purity and at the same time it manifests the human being. The great guardian brings the energy of a new beginning, the beginning of a new era(it will begin after the change of attitude and the action of the beings of light). Herewe can make a relation with the beginning of FIVE AJAW, the FIFTH SUN. This isthe cycle of a new humanity: of peace, harmony, balance, knowledge and thekingdom of wisdom, the return to the Original Law, to the basic, to the harmony withMother Earth, the encounter with ourselves. This cycle begins on December 21 of2012.\" The Maya kept time with a combination of several cycles that meshed together to markthe movement of the sun, moon and Venus. Their ritual calendar, known as the Tzolkin, was composedof 260 days and the \"grand count\" allegedly began on August 31, 3114 B.C. and ends on December 21,2012.Website:"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Saq' Be' (White Road Sacred Path and Milky Way) Organization for Mayan and SpiritualStudiesCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
