Official Documents: The Real and The Fakes Many of us over the years have received or have seen copies of an allegedofficial document. They reach a selective list of activists hoping to find afew gluttons who will swallow its dramatic \"inside\" hoopla even though itssource will never be known. Eventually, most of these documents, if notall, turn out to be fraudulent. Coming to mind are the questionableMajestic 12 papers. After their release through William Moore and JaimeShandera, there was a flush of joy among researchers over their ostensiblegenuineness. But critics who dug deeply into the papers' 'officialese' formatsuch as Barry Greenwood, Editor of Just Cause, found flaws galore andthe joy and the document eventually withered away into oblivion. As Ihave said before in this status report, there are clever tricksters in the Hallof Mirrors. Some are sick, some have agendas. Hopefully, unlike the aforementioned, the document that follows seems tohave a solid source, though it is a person I have never met. Myintermediary, however, whom I have known for several years, prefersanonymity for reasons he explained and that I can accept. Also, I knowthat under these conditions, the document at face value cannot be asmoking gun. But, in this business, where is the gun that smokes? Whilesworn testimony by solid witnesses might be legally persuasive in ourjudicial system, (it doesn't count) in the tightening disciplines of scientificUFOlogy, tons of UFO testimony is not proof. Well, unless it can bebacked up by the claimant revealing a frozen alien cadaver from storage inhis refrigerator or the spaceship's propulsion system hidden in his garage. The text of the document presented here, I was told, was faded with age.But its pages have been re-typed for me by my intermediary to be readable.The covering letter, (shown below) however, copied from the original,remains obscure with parts of the text illegible, but I believe it is importantthat it is published for the record.

The data furnished in this report was provided by theengineer staff personnel of T-2 and Aircraft Laboratory, EngineeringDivision T-3. Additional data furnished by the scientific personnel ofthe Jet Propulsion Laboratory, CIT, and the Army Air ForcesScientific Advisory Group, headed by Dr. Theodore von Karman.Further analysis was conducted by personnel from Research andDevelopment. 2. It is the collective view of this investigative body that the aircraftrecovered by the Army and Air Force units ... are not of U. S.manufacture for the following reasons:a. The circular, disc-shaped 'platform' design does not resemble anydesign currently under development by this command nor of anyNavy project. b. The lack of any external propulsion system, power plant, intake,exhaust either for propeller or jet propulsion, warrants this view. c. The inability of the German scientists from Fort Bliss and WhiteSands Proving Ground to make a positive identification of a secretGerman V weapon of these discs. Though the possibility that theRussians have managed to develop such a craft remains. The lack ofany markings, ID numbers of instructions in Cyrillic has placedserious doubt in the minds of many that the objects recovered are notof Russian manufacture either. d. Upon examination of the interior of the craft, a compartmentexhibiting a possible atomic engine was discovered. At least this isthe opinion of Dr. Oppenheimer and Dr. von Karman. A possibilityexists that part of the craft itself comprises the propulsion system,thus allowing the reactor to function as a heat exchanger andpermitting the storage of energy, unlike the release of energy of ouratomic bombs. The description of the power room is as follows:1) A doughnut-shaped tube approximately thirty-five feet indiameter, made of what appears to be plastic material,surrounding a central core (see sketch in Tab 1). This tubeappeared to be filled with a clear substance, possibly a heavywater. A large rod, centered inside the tube, was wrapped in acoil of what appears to be of copper material, ran through thecircumference of the tube. This may be the reactor controlmechanism or a storage battery. There were no moving parts ofthe spaces examined. 2) This activation of an electrical potential is believed to be theprimary power to the reactor, though it is only a theory atpresent. Just how a heavy water reactor functions in thisenvironment is unknown. 3) Underneath the power plant was discovered a ball-turret,approximately ten feet in diameter. This turret wasencompassed by a series of gears that has an unusual ratio notknown by any of our engineers. On the underside of the turretwere four circular cavities coated with some smooth materialnot identified. These cavities are symmetrical, but seem to bemovable. Just how is not known. The movement of the turretcoincides with the dome-shaped cupola compartment above thepower room. It is believed that the main propulsion system is abladeless turbine, similar to current development nowunderway at AMC and the Mogul Project. A possible theory was devised by Dr. August Steinhoff (aPaperclip scientist), and Dr. Werner von Braun and Dr."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Theodore von Karman: as the craft moves through theatmosphere, it somehow draws the hydrogen from theatmosphere and by an induction process, generates an atomicfusion reaction (see Tab 2). The air outside the craft would beionized; thus, propelling the craft forward. Coupled with thecircular air foil for lift, the craft would presumably have anunlimited range and air speed. This may account for thereported absence of any noise. e. There is a flight deck located inside the cupola section. It is roundand domed at the top. The absence of canopy, observationwindows/blisters, or any optical projection, lends support to theopinion that this craft is either guided by remote viewing or isremotely controlled.1) A semi-circular photo-tube array (possibly television). 2) Crew compartments were hermetically sealed via asolidification process. 3) No weld marks, rivets or soldered joints. 4) Craft components appear to be molded and pressed into aperfect fit.'\" To be continued in Part 11.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
