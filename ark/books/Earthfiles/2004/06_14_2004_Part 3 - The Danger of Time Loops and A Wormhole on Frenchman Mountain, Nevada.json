If one would spin off a technology from the project, which isanother reason why I'm guarding as carefully as I'm guarding it!DO YOU THINK THAT ANY OF THIS SHEDS ANY LIGHT ON WHAT WILL HAPPENIN 2012?I think the signatures that are due on June 8, 2004, for the T-9 Treaty is an indicator to methat we are looking toward the positive meaning a fruitful outcome of 2012. The propernegotiations have been completed, or are being completed, and are awaiting signatures. So,if everybody cooperates, we should have a collapse of the time lines in 2012.THE CONVERGENCE OF TIME LINE PARADOX HOW CAN YOU CONVERGE THETIME LINES AND HAVE THE SPLIT TIME LINES OF THE J-RODS, THE BLONDSAND THE HOMO SAPIENS ALTOGETHER IN A CONVERGED TIME LINEWITHOUT THE ELIMINATION OF SOME OF THEM?Presently, they (J-Rods and Blonds) are simply traveling in time to come back to thispresent time. So, we're not exactly existing in the same time line with them. It's the actionsof time travel which cause the temporal paradoxes. Further than that, talk to Bill Hamiltonbecause he is the physics guy. But two time lines would co-exist. Our present time line andthose from Orion and the J-Rods. Those two species are concurrent in a time line becausethey were concurrent at the point of catastrophe (in a previous 2012 in the repeating timeloop problem).SO, THEY ARE CONCURRENT NOW AND THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TOCONVERGE IT INTO ONE IN WHICH THEY WILL REMAIN, FROM OUR POINT OFVIEW, EXTRATERRESTRIALS?Ye s , m' a m.WHAT WILL THAT ACCOMPLISH FOR THEM IF THEY ARE STILL VERY SICK?It won't. But it will accomplish for us in our reality of not having a catastrophe thatultimately splits our human species.IT WOULD END THE CYCLE (TIME LOOP)?Yes, m'am. When it comes to the prevalence of the poly neuropathy and associatedconditions with the J-Rods, that's a totally separate issue and it's one that is still beingworked upon. It's one of the team that I was lucky enough to head I actually failed to findan answer to. However, there have been some significant inroads of late concerning theirbiology and so hopefully, we will have at least some treatment to alleviate their problems. ERB Events on Frenchman MountainTHERE WAS AN ACTUAL STAR GATE EVENT HERE?Ye s ."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"WHAT HAPPENED?We had some interpretive folks up here. They started doing remote viewing on the area. Irequested they remote view the area for the original theory, the one before the biophotonicburst on May 31, 2001. They started getting unusual feelings about the area, that there wassomething located slightly to the east of where we are standing now. I asked them to definethat. The remote viewers started coming up with drawings of the mountain, the small onethat we nicknamed the 'Conquistador's Helmet,' and were drawing U-shapes on pieces ofpaper. They became quite agitated and were not understanding their own feelings about it.Frenchman Mountain - the white arrow points at a scalloped ridges nicknamed \"Conquistador's Helmet\"behind which Marcia McDowell, Dan Burisch and other investigators monitored and tried to use what wasidentifiedas a temporarily existing Einstein-Rosen Bridge (ERB) wormhole for communication with J-Rods andunsuccessful time travel experiments. Photograph © 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe.I took a look at all the drawings and started doing what I do and that's to connect the dots,to create geometric patterns. Finally, I decided to connect just the ends of the U shapes. Wethought if there were U's everywhere, maybe there was a uranium deposit here. But no.The area was in fact checked out to see if there was a uranium deposit here and there wasnot.We started connecting the dots and when we connected the dots, we got a very interestinggeometric pattern. That geometric pattern both related to work done by Dan Winter for the\"Ophanic star gate,\" as well as the Shri Yantra, the sacred mandala of creation. So at thatpoint, I started asking questions: why would we have something relating to both structuresin one geometric pattern?Shri Yantra mandala.(Editor's Note: From the permutations of Sri Yantra and the pentagon, especially in theirprimary relations to circle and square, we can derive the actual proportional series thatgovern the relationship of the notes with the musical scales (ragas and raginis) and thederivation of the secondary raginis from the primary ragas. This is the secret of Sri Yantrawith its corresponding mantras.Yantra and the musical modes of the raga system are inherently related through theirmathematically-proportioned foundation. Just as the basic notes of each raga areharmonized so are the visible lines in each yantra. And just as the musical string must beplucked in a particular fashion to sound a certain note, so must the yantra line be masteredand mentally plucked to bring forth its image or power. Thus, the yantra diagram ofapparently static lines will, with mental application, vibrate in perfect relation like a finelytuned musical instrument.) Time Anomalies Allegedly Caused by ERB on Frenchman Mountain"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"At that point, clocks were left around the Conquistador's Helmet. Then we started noticinga great time disparity in the clocks. Once that happened, then a team moved in from theSTAAR FL OWE R unit.WHAT WAS THE OPERATING MEDIA FOR THE CLOCKS?They were digital as well as analogs left there.WAS THERE EQUAL DISPARITY, WHETHER THEY WERE DIGITAL OR ANALOG?It was equal disparity. In the areas where they were placed side-by-side - and I believe ourteam had them placed side-by-side - just to run a control over the type of machinery.ANY IDEA OF THE PERCENTAGE OF DISCREPANCY?No, I was not told that. In fact, the Star Gate issue here has been the least of my concerns.I've been coming here to run the biology and take a look at the geology and see how itrelated to the biology and try to extend the theory from the serendipitous occasion we had(biophotonic flash).The remote viewers continued to work and ultimately, I was asked to walk into the area acouple of times because there were some events reported by spotters. There were also acouple negative events which occurred to a couple of the personnel out here. They wereseverely injured. Ultimately, the Operations Director took over the interpretations having todo with the ERB. It's quieted down. I'm not even sure that it's passing through the earth atthis area any more.THE EINSTEIN-ROSEN BRIDGE WORM HOLE YOU ARE REFERRING TO?Ye s .DOES IT MOVE?Yes, apparently we passed through some sort of I would not hazard the physics, but somesort of 'cord,' if you will if you can imagine a gelatinous sphere passing through a cord andthe cord ran through the Earth at this location.CORD?When I think of a worm hole, I think of a rope. I think of a serpent rope. However, like Isaid, the one to interpret the material to the east of here is down there (Marcia A.McDowell.) It's her ball game. I just did the biology work. What I tried to make sure andultimately with her (Marcia) being assigned to the eastern area did make sure that I wouldnot be confusing the elements of the theory. Since the ERB was defined over there, theremote viewers began closely tying the events of the LOTUS to the ERB activity. From mypoint of view, that was a no-no because we were getting too many confounding variablesinto the equation. We needed to know step-by-step what science we were finding. It's justtoo willy nilly for me over there (ERB location on Conquistador's Helmet). Connection Between ERB and Ganesh Particles?I suspect that in every mote of dust there exist the probability of producing these (ganesh)particles literally life springing the potential for life, the creativity is literally springing allaround us in the dust. (\"From dust to dust we come.\" Bible)Rob from England: HOW PHYSICAL IS THE VOLTAGES THAT ARE APPLIED INYOUR GANESH PARTICLE RESEARCH?The 16.47 to 16.96 millivolt range is critical for maximizing the number of ganesh particlesbeing emitted per cubic millimeter.WITH A DIFFERENT VOLTAGE, YOU COULD GET REDUCED EMISSIONS?Ye s .I NOTICED THAT IN YOUR EARLIER EXPERIMENTS, BOTH OHM METERREADINGS WERE TAKEN AS WELL AS CURRENT READINGS. AM I CORRECT?Yes. The resistance, in fact, bottoms out and drops when ganesh particles are being emitted.SO YOU ARE USING THAT AS AN INDICATION OF WHEN THE PARTICLES WEREACTUALLY BEING EMITTED?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Yes. In fact, in most cases I would run a cinematography unit through the scope and notactually watch half the time. I'm just watching the instrumentation. When I know they arebeing emitted, I take a time on it and I run it back to the tape log at that point run the clockback on it and see what we have. That way, it can be done on several trials at the sametime where I don't have to have one eye on this microscope and one eye on that one.ANY IDEA HOW THAT OCCURRED NATURALLY?I think we are just discovering something that has been going on all the time. We're the newkids on the block.GENERATING 17 ...Millivolts.MILLIVOLTS OH, YEAH, YOU COULD DO THAT.It's in an ambient range.\" Marcia A. McDowell and ERBs on Frenchman MountainThose hilly mounds up there are the outcropping, but we go around to the other side.Linda Howe: ON THE OTHER SIDE WAS THE ERB STAR GATE?Yes. That's where we ended up having the transmission problems that day when it missedthe target and everything blew up.BECAUSE ENERGY CAME THROUGH FROM A WORMHOLE?We were doing a test. Actually we were trying to test the communication equipment. Wewere testing our communication protocol.THAT WOULD BE TO TEST FROM OUTER SPACE? OR BETWEEN YOU GUYS?Well, we sent out and were expecting something back. What we got back missed the targetslightly. We had a target set up. It was a silver plaque.YOU WERE TRYING TO COMMUNICATE BETWEEN?Between us here and them there.BETWEEN US AND THE J-RODS?Absolutely.AND THIS IS THE COMMUNICATION AREA BECAUSE?This had a natural ERB.A WORMHOLE ACTUALLY HERE?Yes, an actual worm hole here. So we were using it for a communications protocol.TO SEE IF YOU COULD ESTABLISH LIKE WE WOULD A TELEPHONE LINE?Ye s .AND IT WOULD STAY?The thing is people were disappearing, so it was a very unstable one and was a littledangerous.LITERALLY PEOPLE HAD DISAPPEARED?Yes, literally.IN THE PROGRAM WHO CAME OUT TO WORK ON THIS?Yes. We lost personnel. (Two people)THE DISAPPEARANCE IS THAT THEY ARE NOW GONE TO SOME OTHER PARTOF THE GALAXY OR UNIVERSE?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Yes, they are gone! We have literally lost personnel.SO WORMHOLES ARE NOT THE HYPOTHETICAL - THAT HAWKING, WHEELERAND KIP THORNE THEY WRITE ABOUT THEM AS BEING ONLY THEORETICAL.They are theoretical to them.BUT NOT TO YOU AND J-RODS.No, not to the J-RODS.YOU WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE WORMHOLE ERB WITHOUT THEJ-ROD?I'm not sure if it is a chicken or egg situation or what. At first our people tried to manipulateit, but even I got burned in an experiment. Then we just started trying to use it as acommunications protocol instead of trying to transport people.The thing was, we simply could not get it stabilized. And when they sent the transmissionthrough, it missed the target. It was supposed to hit the silver platter, plaque thing. Oh, boy,it missed and hit rocks to the side of it!WHAT HAPPENED?The rocks etched. Part of the platter etched with the message. Then the rocks from thesheer magnitude of the force exploded, fragments everywhere. We called them 'bacon bits.'We had to send a team in to try to recover them. The team freaked out. They said the onlypeople who could go in and handle the damn stuff was Dan or me. So, we ended up havingto physically come in here in the middle of the freaking night to try to recover pieces of thetransmission. We came up in the middle of the night looking for pieces of the target thatwere damaged and fractured and faces of rocks that were fractured.CAN OUR GOVERNMENT CONTROL ERBS NOW AT ALL?I don't think so. I think after the problem with personnel loss - I don't think anyone isattempting to right now. I think they may have learned their lesson.Dan Burisch: They are trying to control the equipment.Marcia: Dan was begging them to stop.Dan: Yeah, I was telling them to knock it off here. One of the reasons is that it wasdisrupting my sampling up here.Linda: BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE DISAPPEARING?Marcia: I think that was the ultimate problem that stopped them.Dan: We've had a couple of disappearances and a couple of physical as well as psychiatricmaimings.LINDA: COULDN'T THE J-RODS AND THE BLONDS HELP FIGURE THAT OUTAND FIX IT?Dan: I don't know. I am only aware of the emotions that were pulled to me having to dowith time travel. I'm not aware whether or not they could ameliorate the situation or not. Ithink that's part of the problem that was engendered with the T-9 Treaty to get one faction(of J-Rods) to sign on so that they would not attempt to manipulate the governments of theworld to continue trying to build these ERB \"star gate\" contraptions that would ultimatelyturn on, on their own when the Great 2012 Happening happens. Whatever it is.Rob: The silver plate would have been positioned where?Marcia: About where she (Linda Howe) is sitting now. A little further up actually, right onthe flat section there.Rob: Is there anything you can tell us about the deciphering of what bit was inscribed onthe silver plate?Marcia: I could, but I would be in a lot of trouble if I did.Rob: Positive or negative information?Marcia: Very positive, indeed, but it's just that I can't disclose any of the details. Anyway,this is where that happened."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Saddam Hussein in Iraq and ERB MachinesLinda: SO IS IT TRUE THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN HAD TWO ERBs HE KNEW HOWTO OPERATE - LEFT OVER FROM SUMERIA AND MESOPOTAMIA?Marcia: No, that's not my understanding of it at all.Dan: Hussein et al accessed the plans to build the base device to the Djed pillar. The thingis when the actual Djed pillar is erected in 2012 - it's not a physical erection it is anelectromagnetic erection.(Editor's Note: The Djed pillar was a roughly cruciform object with at least three cross bars,but almost always four, that became one of the most recognizable symbols in ancientEgypt. It was sometimes surmounted by a small capital (or perhaps more correctly, anabacus used to support the architrave), and often stands on a rectangular base. Somedepictions of the pillar portray it with human arms holding the royal regalia. Inrepresentations and in other instances, such as amulets, the Djed pillar could be depicted asflat, but at other times it was produced as a fully round pillar. Egyptian scholars do nothave a consensus about its meaning or function.) Left: A Djed pillar in raise relief; Right: Djed pillar showing the rings of a papyrus column.Predynastic Period in Egypt: 5,500-3,100 B. C.When that happens, too many of these little items (ERB star gates), one too many would beenough to have too much energy - from what I understand - to the biosphere andgeosphere. What he (Saddam Hussein) did from what I've been told I was not there in hislittle evil Santa's workshop or anything but what he did is that he had the ERB informationaccessed and started building copies of these machines, selling some and handing others offto leaders in the Middle East so he could gain prestige as being a wider Islamic leader whoknew Nebucanezzer II, as it were, and it was his (Saddam's) hope that he would be able togain access in 2012 to essentially the Son of God, Quetzacoatl, to come through the 'fieryfurnace' once again as he allegedly did back in Sumerian times.But we're (U.S. government) getting them picked up (ERBs).IS THAT THE MAIN REASON WE WENT INTO IRAQ?That's the main reason that I'm aware of.RIGHT NOW, AS FAR AS YOU KNOW, THERE ARE NO MORE ERBS IN IRAQ?As far as I'm aware, there are no machines there. If you're talking about natural ERB pointsof star gates, that I don't know. But the manmade equipment to access them, as far as Iknow, that's all been taken down and removed by the United States.\"More Information:See these previous Earthfiles.com reports:·· 06/08/2004 -- Part 3: Whistleblower Microbiologist Dan Burisch Interview on June7, 2003"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"· 05/23/2004 -- Part 2: Whistleblower Microbiologist Dan Burisch Interview on June7, 2003· 05/19/2004 -- Part 1: Whistleblower Microbiologist Dan Burisch Interview on June7, 2003· 04/26/2004 -- Update About Microbiologist Dan Burisch, Ph.D.· 03/17/2004 -- Part 2 - \"Horrible Secret\" in UFO Crash Retrievals Near Roswell,New Mexico, in July 1947?· 11/19/2003 -- Updated - 1954 Manual: \"Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology\" -Reasons It Is Authentic· 09/15/2003 -- Part 3 - Whistleblower Microbiologist Speaks Out About Alleged\"Alien\" Named J-Rod· 09/15/2003 -- Part 2 - Whistleblower Microbiologist Speaks Out About Alleged\"Alien\" Named J-Rod· 09/15/2003 -- Part 1 - Whistleblower Microbiologist Speaks Out About Alleged\"Alien\" Named J-Rod· 10/05/2002 -- Part 2 - J-Rod and Microbiologist Danny B Burisch, Ph.D.· 10/05/2002 -- Part 1 - Two Scientists Describe An Extraterrestrial Biological EntityCalled \"J-Rod\"· 10/05/2002 -- Part 3 - More Background On the Scientists Linked To \"J-Rod\"· 06/22/1999 -- The Strange Story of J-Rod, An EBEBrief BackgroundDan Burisch is a microbiologist who received his Ph.D. from the State University of NewYork, Stonybrook, in 1989. He is 40 years old now, born on February 2, 1964. His birthcertificate name was Danny B (no period) Crain. I have met and talked with his mother,Dodie Crain, and with Dan who confirm the name change and reason for it.Copy of Danny B Crain (aka Dan Burisch) \"Certificate of Live Birth\" at 4:28 a.m. on February 2, 1964,in St. Francis Hospital in Lynwood, California - a suburb of Los Angeles. Birth certificate provided by\"Dodie\" Crain.In 1990, Dan married Deborah Kay Burisch who had a child from a previous marriage.Five years later in 1995, Dan legally changed his last name from Crain to Burisch to matchthe child's legal last name.In 1989, as Dan Crain graduated from SUNY Stonybrook with a Ph.D. in Microbiology andMolecular Genetics, Dan was at the same time employed by the U. S. Navy's DOD NavalResearch Laboratory. His rank was Captain and his title Microbiologist IV.In 1994, he was assigned to work in an underground laboratory at S-4/5 at Area 51, fivefloors under the Papoose Mountain installation at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The fifth floor isaccessible only by one secure elevator. Dr. Burisch told me that in the year 1994, he suitedup in the fifth floor underground laboratory like an astronaut with breathing and urinationhoses. His assignment was to enter a round \"clean sphere\" filled with a cold atmosphere of4% by volume hydrogen, argon and other gases. Inside the clean sphere was an entityoriginally called \"extraterrestrial\" by his government superiors and later described as a\"time traveler\" from 50,000 years in the future. According to Dr. Burisch, his boss reportedto a MAJI committee, an extension of the Majestic-12 Special Studies Group organized byPresident Harry S. Truman in 1947. Majestic 12 included top scientific, military andbusiness leaders asked to study the extraterrestrial phenomenon.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
