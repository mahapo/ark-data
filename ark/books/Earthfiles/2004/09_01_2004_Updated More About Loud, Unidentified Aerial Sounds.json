September 1, 2004 Everett, Washington - After I filed the August 28, 2004, Earthfilesand DREAMLAND Online reports about the Farnam, Nebraska, cow mutilation thatoccurred around the same time that a dozen residents heard a very loud, unidentified aerialsound, I received the e-mail below from Everett, Washington resident, Gary Val Tenuta.With his permission, I am reprinting here and hope that other viewers and listeners whomight have had a similar experience will e-mail me: earthfiles@earthfiles.com Update : I have received several e-mails from viewers and listeners which are now includedin this updated report. 1)August 30, 2004From: Gary Val TenutaEverett, Washington, north of Seattle \"Hi Linda,Just heard your report on Dreamland about the August 2004 cattle mutilation whereseveral people heard a loud noise that remained unexplained. As I listened to thosepeople describing what they heard, I was reminded of what goes on here in theEverett and Mill Creek area of Washington state. I live in Everett (just north of Seattle). Back around 1996-97 (close as I can recall) Ikept hearing a loud noise that would wake me up in the middle of the night. Itsounded very much like the sound of a jet engine. It would start at a low volume andincrease in volume and then gradually subside to nothing. The event would last formaybe 3 to 5 minutes. It happened maybe 3 or 4 times at night and then I beganhearing it once in a while during the day. When it happened during the day I wentout to see if I could see anything in the sky above my apartment. It sounded like a jetengine, very loud, seemingly coming from everywhere yet nowhere. I couldn't seeany planes in the air although it seemed loud enough that if it was a jet it would haveto be flying very low. Now some subsequent details:After this happened a couple times one night (somewhere around 1 a.m.), it occurredto me that maybe they were testing jet engines at some facility near the north Boeing"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"plant which is about 5 miles from my apartment. So I got up and made some phonecalls to Boeing. One person I talked to said not only were they not testing enginesbut there was a city ordinance prohibiting the testing of jet engines after somethinglike 9 p.m. I told the person that I could hear the sound even as we were speaking onthe phone. The person then transferred me to a guard posted outside the building. Iasked the guard to listen outside to see if he could hear the sound but he said hecould hear no such sound. Soon the sound went away and I went back to bed only tobe awakened by it again about an hour later. So I got up and called Boeing again butgot the same response. The next day, at work, I was telling one of our regular customers about all this andshe laughed. I forget the exact circumstances now, but she happened to have someconnection to a company near Boeing or perhaps located on the Boeing property.Maybe she was employed there. I just can't recall for sure. The company in questiondoes some kind of work for Boeing; fabrication work or something like that I think.Anyway, apparently word about my phone calls had gotten around and they weremaking jokes about \"some guy who was hearing things in the middle of the night\".Then she, too, told me about the city ordinance regarding the testing of jet engines. I told my girlfriend about all of this within the next day or so and she knew exactlywhat I was talking about! She lives about 20 minutes east of me and she said she andher daughters have heard the same thing many times. When they go out to see whatcould be causing it they can see nothing. The sound just comes and goes, starting at alow volume, then increasing in volume, then subsiding to nothing. It's pretty weirdbecause the rise and fall of the volume, combined with the fact that closest thing wecan relate it to is a low flying jet plane, makes it seem like a plane is approachingfrom afar, then is directly overhead, then passes on out of sight, or in this case, outof sound. But I've paid close attention to the sound, trying to analyze it, and Irealized it's not really like a jet because when the volume is at its peak it lasts toolong. A jet would be here and gone in seconds. The peak volume of this noise canlast several minutes. If it was a jet it would have to be hovering in one place. And,no, it doesn't sound anything like a helicopter. At least not like any helicopter I'veever heard. Besides, there's absolutely nothing to be seen, no matter if its day ornight. Now I haven't heard this sound around my apartment for perhaps a year or more. Afew years ago it seems I would hear it at least a couple times a month. My girlfriendsays she still hears it once in a while over at her place but not as often as before. Don't know if this relates to the phenomenon in your report or not but just thoughtI'd let you know about it.Best,Gary Val Tenuta\" 2)August 31, 2004From: Steven R. MohnsMount Vernon, Washington \"45 miles North of Everett, Washington August 14th, I was awakened at 12:55AMby a jet sound. Being a commercially rated jet pilot myself for 30 years, it alwaysgets my attention. I thought the Navy was conducting night operations, since wereonly miles away from Whidbey Naval Air Station. We see the Grumman A-6'spracticing all the time over town, but only during the day and the occasional flight ofF-18's on their way in with MD-80 Medivac and Lockheed P-3 Orion sub huntersaround. But this was different.It started as a low growl then grew to intense volume so much so, that it wasvibrating the windows of the house. The culmination almost sounded like there weretwo jets that went supersonic, because I heard a double, but subdued boom thatthudded the house so much you could feel it and it rattled the pictures on the wall asthe sound rolled off the foothills of the Cascades like the reflection of sound wavesfrom thunder. At first I thought we had an earthquake, we get one once in a whilehere, but this was again, different and there were no earthquakes in our area thatnight as reported. The Navy denies anyone went supersonic at a low altitude as it isprohibited because of airspace procedures over a population base and there arepractice areas for that over way out over the Pacific and well marked inland trainingareas in the less populated desert interior of Washington State.No one I talked to knew what it was. No bolides were reported that night either. Iwill admit one spring night a year ago, to seeing what I thought was the Aurora spaceplane, which as you know has never been a publicly admitted existence. This thingonly flies at night and the only way you can tell is by its burn. It leaves a pulsed -long white steak of burned propellant as it passes by overhead very quickly. It"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"traveled within my scope of view about 120 degrees of arc, totally silent through twoburn pulses in about 4.5 seconds and was gone. If this was on a trajectory to enterthe atmosphere and land at the military base in Idaho, it could possibly be lowenough to hear this kind of sound as it entered the atmosphere over the cost andcontinued inland like the Shuttle. It may be another mystery, but very similar to whatyou should hear and the experiences of Mr. Gary Val Tenuta if it was indeed theAurora.Sincerely,Ste ven R. MohnsMount Vernon, Washington\" 3)September 1, 2004From: Bob WilsonPerth, Western Australia \"G'day,Along the lines of your article I would like to report the following. Not sure of thedate but would have been around 2002 in Perth, Western Australia. Laying on the bed reading a book in the house alone with the door opened onto thebalcony with the fly screen closed, I heard what could only be described as a jetfighter flying over the top of the house seemingly only about 100 feet above it. Thisspooked me a little and I went out on the balcony to check, but couldn't seeanything. I carried on reading the book and five or so minutes later exactly the same, but thistime - just after the noise passed - there was a pressure wave that rattled the flyscreen in the frame and blew the curtains around surrounding the door. Thesensation was akin to what I would imagine would be the pressure wave of anexplosion or the back wash of a jet, but from a medium distance. Again I jumped out onto the balcony, but couldn't see anything, although there wasno one else really around - no traffic had stopped and all appeared normal. I cannot provide an explanation for what happened - for a jet's backwash to blowcurtains then I would have thought it would have to be pretty close and forsomething to rattle the fly screen it would need to be fairly powerful. I can't explainit as a sudden very high gust of wind due to it's synchronisation with the sound. Not quite the same as your article I know but I have seen on the NUFORC report lista couple of similar reports and even one that was also from Perth, but a couple ofyears previously that was almost identical.I am not underneath any standard flight path or close to any Air Force basesalthough regularly I see normal civilian traffic and occasionally a fighter jet -although always at a decent altitude. Also, I haven't experienced anything unusual orsimilar since.RegardsBob Wilson\" 4)September 1, 2004From: \"Bicycle Bob\" SoetebierMaryland Heights, Missouri (Northwest St. Louis County) \"My wife and I have heard the EXACT same loud, jet-like noises asdescribed by both Gary Val Tenuta and the Nebraska folks, too, righthere in Maryland Heights, Missouri, (a suburb in n.w. St. LouisCounty - about a half-dozen miles 'as the crow flies' from LambertInternational Airport) over at least the last decade. We have frequently heard these loud noises both day and night asrecently as just a couple of days ago. The sound is MUCH louder thanany of the regular Lambert Field take-offs by commercial jets and/orthe daily Missouri Air National Guard jets flight runs -- even whenthe ANG jets execute their almost straight-up 'Sikorski' take-offsand/or their always brief after-burner kick-ins! Same as noted by Gary Val Tenuta, we NEVER see anything in the sky(day or night) that could remotely be responsible for these loud andprolonged (3 to 5 minutes) noises. Lambert Field also has a Boeing(former McDonnell-Douglas) facility, too. NO WAY these are jet engine"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"'test runs!' Hope somebody, somewhere, somehow is able to come up with anexplanation for this perplexing enigma! Good luck.Take care,'Bicycle Bob' Soetebier\" 5)September 1, 2004From: Jeremy C.St. Louis, Missouri \"Wow, now I don't feel like a freak! Occasionally here in St Louis, I hear a sound that sounds very muchlike a big jet engine, but heard as if I'm standing on the tarmac (sp?)itself!.. but I'd be at the park or something, and no jets around. Evenif there were a jet up in the sky, only a fool would think the soundcomes from the jet. It's to far away to be so intense. When I sayintense, I mean the bass volume alone is so powerful I can feel it inbody, but it also has the distinct impression of being from very far away(Low frequency sounds as you know travel much further). I've heard this sound maybe 4 times in 3 years, and it is very distinct. When I hear it,I instinctively know this is not a normal sound I should be hearing. I'mvery familiar with jet sounds in my area, I know where the airport is, Iknow what I should and shouldn't be hearing. This noise is too intenseand BIG... the only way this sound comes from a jet engine is if I'mstanding in front of it (and it's much more intense on the low end thanon the hi-end... keep in mind that hi frequencies don't travel nearly asfar as the low end.. more circumstantial evidence that this soundoriginates from quite aways away). And it does start slowly and build upto intensity.. then slowly goes away. It seems like it might be what arocket taking off might sound like, from 20 miles away or something.I KNEW SOMETHING WAS WEIRD ABOUT THAT SOUND!Thank you for posting that... now if you could only find out why street lightsgo off (and on) a lot when I get near them, that would solve a great mystery for me,ha ha!Thanks again,Jeremy,PS: There is a major Boeing plant hear in St Louis too, like in yourreport... I thought that might be an interesting coincidence to consider.Although it may be nothing, there are Boeing plants in a lot of places.\" 6)September 1, 2004From: M.B.Sequim, Washington \"Linda,Re the unexplained loud jet-engine type noises heard in the Everett area of WAstate. I live almost directly west of Everett, probably 30-40 miles 'as the crow flies',in Sequim, WA. I hear these noises often and was frustrated by not being able to seeanything when I go outside. However, since this was such a warm summer, I spent alot of time lying in a hammock at night, staring up at the night sky. On severaloccasions (3 or 4 at least) I have seen a smaller jet, very fast-moving, very highaltitude, zip overhead. A few seconds after it is completely out of sight, I would hearthe familiar rumble, which would come and go in the direction of the plane. If Ihadn't been looking in the right direction at the right moment, I would never haveseen it. I am curious about what direction the sound in Everett moved. West and east aroundhere tend to be commercial airline routes. The jets that travel from north to south areusually smaller, faster, and I have always thought, come from Whidbey Island NavalAir Station. (The signs on the island say \"The Sound of Freedom\") approximately 20miles east of Sequim. Twice I have seen what appeared to be a rather large, whitefuselage traveling through the sky ( always from the north to the south) with no noiseaccompanying it at all, ever. This is always curious. They have always been so faraway that I can't make it out well enough to see if there are small wings, and I'venever had my binoculars with me at the right time."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"South of me are the Olympic Mountains...mostly National Park, with almost noinhabitants. West is the Pacific Ocean. There is a huge amount of uninhabitedcountry around us so we would be an ideal spot to test anything...and Boeing is just ahop and a skip from here. We are a hot spot... McCord Field, Bangor and the lovelyTridents (Have you read A Nuclear Peace, by any chance, or heard of it? Not manypeople in this country have; It's big in Europe), and Boeing. There are more; prettydepressing, eh? At any rate, I think if the writer of that post had been outside,looking up a few seconds before he heard the noise, he might have seen what causedit.Thanks for Earthfiles.
