The Macabre Case of \"Agent\" Robert Lee Malone Here is still another sobering, high-intrigue case slinking its way out of theHall of Mirrors that defies any cut-and-dry explanation. With so many keydetails missing, I would have dismissed the case had it not been for the 6months of prior, in-depth investigation by Georgeanne Cifarelli of SanMarino, California, who is MUFON's Assistant State Director for SouthernCalifornia. During this period, Georgeanne tried to rationalize the bits and pieces ofinformation she was able to obtain by phone, mail and personal interviewsfrom the wife and daughter of Robert Malone - a military mystery man. On the theoretical basis that crash/retrievals might have been a factor oreven played a major role in the peregrinations of patriarch Malone,Georgeanne was advised by friends in research to contact me to help findcorrelative evidence.After phoning me to present the salient facts, she agreed to send me hercumulative notes on the case which I received December 16. The Malonereport, representing a lot of hard work, is long: the case is complex. ButGeorgeanne is convinced that the testimony she heard and the documentsshe saw (and sent copies to me) is a macabre story that must be told. According to the 34-page report, the central figure in the case is the fatherRobert Malone, who was a \"blood and guts\" military career type whosealleged undercover work in the murky labyrinths of intelligence might haveled to his strange death in a Navy hospital in 1964. Since that hushed-upevent, his wife (the couple married in 1948 in Germany) has lived inisolation in a state of grief and fear. The daughter, Nancy, incensed by the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"injustices to her parents, now seeks the truth. Unlike her mother, Nancyhas spared nothing good or bad about her family affairs to Georgeanne.Mrs. Malone, however, with a change of name, prefers to remainunidentified. But the high strangeness goes beyond Robert Malone. Weird, and perhapsan incongruity, are the claims of his wife of UFO experiences before shemet him in 1946. While imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp, shewitnessed low-level UFOs over the camp, even alarming the Germanauthorities. Just as freakish are the disclosures by Nancy claiming life-longUFO encounters, including a lizard-like creature, as she followed herfather on his errant calls to duty to all parts of the USA and beyond. Who was Robert Malone, the military mystery man? His wife and daughterknew he worked on hush-hush assignments full time, but could neverexplain why he never kept a military uniform in his home. Official recordsshow that he served as Master Sergeant and Warrant Officer, but therewere times, said Nancy, that he was addressed by other military associatesby various ranks, including colonel. In fact, Nancy revealed on a couple ofoccasions that her dad worked as a double for President Eisenhower. While some of Malone's assignments in a UFO \"hot\" area, perhaps near acrash or a landing site, might have been the trigger for Nancy's exposure toalien activity\" But the wife, admitted encounters while in a Naziconcentration camp during WWII seems strange in that she and Malonehad a common ground of interest - unless there was an arranged UFOintelligence connection? Is it unreasonable to believe that if that were the case, it also might be thereason behind Mrs. Malone's preference not to discuss all of her husband'sintelligence activities? But agents assigned to perform UFO duties aresworn to secrecy and they do play games with curious outsiders who neednot know the truth. On the other hand, coupled with her obvious fears for \"talking too much,\"there is Mrs. Malone's revelation of her husband's records that show thathe was an active member of an Army band as Master Sergeant - and lateras a bandsman with rank as Warrant Officer in the Air Force. But she saysshe never saw him play the alleged trombone or have one stored in theirhome. \"It was a cover,\" she told Georgeanne. Mrs. Malone also producedas evidence of her husband's undercover work an official directive toSouthwestern Bell Telephone Company, San Antonio, Texas, datedFebruary 1, 1944, from G. C. Brant, Major General U. S. Army,Commanding General AAFCFTC, which reads as follows: \"It is requested that a telephone be installed for private use in thehome of Robert L. Malone, CWO, U. S. Army, 214 Army Blvd., SanAntonio, Texas. Mr. Malone's duties necessitate the installation of a telephone at hishome inasmuch as he is subject to call for duty at all times, and maybe needed after regular duty hours. Your prompt attention to this matter will be kindly appreciated.\" Ordering a special telephone for a Master Sergeant who played a trombonewould hardly be the kind of request from a Commanding General. Yet,briefly, in all of the official records pertinent to Robert Malone - includinghis discharge - he is classified as a bandleader or bandsman. In each,however, are conflicting data as to his duties and year of discharge andother discrepancies. His available records just don't make sense if we are tobelieve his wife's and daughter Nancy's testimonies. MUFON's Georgeanne, in summing up his military records that she"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"reviewed after her interview with Mrs. Malone, commented: \"The wife saysher husband, Robert, served for 30 years in the military, enlisting in 1924.The military says he served 35 years. That's a little ridiculous since theyhave him retiring in 1945 and again in 1947 for reasons that are not true.The wife says Social Security is only paying her benefits for 19 years,claiming that Robert was only in for 19 years, according to their(government) records.\" One of Four U. S. Military Reports of Separationand Honorable Discharge for Robert Lee Malone Above: One of four Honorable Discharge Enlisted Record and Report ofSeparationfor Robert Lee Malone. This document is U. S. AIR CORPS \"Date ofSeparation\"October 24, 1945. Below: The other three are USAF October 25, 1948;INFANTRYDecember 16, 1949; and U. S. Army August 31, 1950."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"To be considered in all the confusion over records and the nature of hiswork is the possibility, although remote, that Master Sergeant or WarrantOfficer Malone later served in a covert UFO-connected intelligencecapacity as a civilian. But obviously, records of secret transfer areunaccountably missing. Thus, no pension for Mrs. Malone. To speculatefurther, the records might have been simply lost (not unusual). Or theymight have been maliciously destroyed by some individual in the samedeep-throat service as a personal vendetta for reasons we will never now.Or because he might have been under suspicion as a security risk for someserious indiscretion. This, too, might explain his strange death in a Navalhospital and the denial of allowing his family to see his body - even at hisfuneral. Surely, something is amiss in this case. But it is known that suchDraconian measures have been used by covert agencies that dealt withRussian espionage and the UFO problem in the 1960s. It is beyond the scope of this report to publish the 103 official recordscovering many phases of Malone's military career that I have received fromGeorgeanne. Several items, however, I have chosen to reproduce. Thesewere copies received by the Malones from the Veterans Administrationthrough the Freedom of Information Act which relate to Malone'sDischarge or Separation From Service records. These examples, whichfollow, show the inconsistencies of data about the year of his discharge,alleged health status, duties as a bandsman and the absence of anyreference to covert intelligence work while in the military. Although other records might be withheld or were destroyedcoincidentally with the demise of Malone, we have found additional cluesthat reveal the magnitude of UFO interaction in the lives of the Malonefamily dating back to the days of the holocaust of WWII. Following areexcerpts from the 34-page report submitted by Georgeanne, based on herinterview with Mrs. Malone and daughter, Nancy, in December 1993:Mrs. Robert L. Malone Interview 1942: I was 12 years old in a cattle car on the way to the Polish"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"border. We were on our way to a forced labor camp. We stopped atLidist and the sky 'blacked out' at about 9:00 a.m., and then it lit upwith a 'dome-like' shape with flashing lights. It covered about afootball field area. It strobed. The lights were all around and we wereengulfed as they descended nearer. The Nazis ran and we were allalone until the next morning and then it came again; then there werelights like rays coming through slats and then it was gone. That nightit came again and the Nazis were just as confused as us. 1945: In labor camp at Teisianstadt. The camp was in an uproar - theNazis prior to the U. S. soldiers coming were frantically trying to getrid of evidence of what had happened and in the confusion, 23 othergirls and I (between the ages of 12 and 18) escaped into the swamp.It was cold - winter. We were walking in the woods and watching forNazis when all of a sudden a dome-like thing appeared with nosound, but lights pulsing. We felt an energy rush through us like anelectrical charge. The craft hovered over us and we could see lines alllit up like on a carousel in oranges and golds. We felt the urge tomove toward it and felt an upward pull. We all reached up with ourarms toward it and then we felt as if we were released and thendrained. It then sped away. 1946: I was ill for 11 months. I met Bob. 1947: Bob came to live at our house to help me and my familysurvive after the war. Bob and I were all alone talking and he askedme if I'd ever seen anything unusual with flashing lights and he toldme about his experience on the ocean with a strange object over theship. He was on the aft of the boat with others near Greenland andall of a sudden, the water lit up from beneath with an orange glowand they saw something emerge so quickly that it was hard to follow. 1948: Living in Freising. July 28th I married Bob. Dr. Frik (Chaplainin the U. S. military) told Bob that I might be a discredit to themilitary, after my interrogation, for corroborating Bob's stories.Everyone was investigated like crazy when we wanted to tell themilitary about these incidents. Bob said he would get to the bottomof it in the States. In the U. S., Bob was ordered to a mission - fast - to Fort Ord andwithin 24 hours, we were there in Monterey. That night there was adomed object over the Bay and a soldier yelled, 'There's the tunnel.People disappear when that's around.' About 3 miles or so out, youcould see the tube descend to the water. It wavered - sort oftransparent. Bob said, 'Man, what a mission!' I asked what he meant,but he said he could only tell me it was 'totally bizarre, never mind.'Then one day, he said he was being transferred to Camp Carson andwould send for me. I stayed with my sister because I had pneumoniaagain. Bob left in the fall, but before he left he told me about therelay station by San Pedro. he said he looked out over the ocean anda smaller, glowing wheel/disc/ball came at him and then whizzed thecamp. It maneuvered like a small plane and was about the size of ahot air balloon. As it closed in, it was a disc with beam-like spokeson a wheel. It came to treetop level and then it took off in a zigzag.Again, it seemed like he was being followed. 1951: We traveled around the U. S. with my sister, Katy. We sawlights and things following us on these old highways. We were lonelytravelers on these roads. This was a time when we were moving fromplace to place a lot. I don't know why there was so much activity.1949 is when Bob started getting steady calls to go out. In 1951, itescalated. Calls came all hours of the day and night and off Bobwould go. A few months here or there and I always felt followedbecause people would show up once in awhile asking questions."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"When I asked Bob about them, he said they were military intelligencecheck up. He even said he had to impersonate Eisenhower severaltimes. 1954: Now starts all the years of traveling intensively across thecountry - night moves, sudden calls needing Bob. We went to Indianaand one night a man came up to Bob and took him around back ofthe house to a jeep with three other men and they talked. Then therewas a gunshot. Bob came around and said, 'Let's go!' In the car, Iasked him about it and he said 'gangsters' thought they were helpingthe government, but they were only making things harder to do hismissions. We drove Rte. 66 and at the next gas stop, Bob metsomeone and brought a box back with weapons in it. He said we hadto detour to weird mountainous areas close to Denver and there werealways lights following behind the sky on these deserted highways.Then, suddenly we hit something in the road. It felt like the back endlifted as we stopped. Bob went outside and there was an ugly thinglying on the ground. It was about two feet long - a solid, greenishman. Mostly head with long, thin appendages. The body wasindescribable - very icky. Bob picked it up, covered it, threw it in thetruck, but he didn't take it to the military. I don't know if Bob wasreally aware of these 'aliens' at this time. We talked of beings, mostlyof odd happenings and strange sightings. Then, we went to Texas and on the way, more lights in the sky. More'pursuing,' but no contact. We heard so much about mutilations,animals missing, people missing. Everywhere Bob went he'd startconversations about strange phenomena and people would tell him oftheir experiences. The authorities would tell him to 'get lost' oftenand he'd say he was with the military and they'd get even moreagitated. There was a lot of repression going on. On our way toDenver, we made really out-of-the-way detours going up to Phillips,South Dakota, to see friends. One day, we were totally engulfed in alight on the highway - that only my daughter, Nancy, could see. Shewas adamant and squinting and I thought she was fevered, but wecouldn't see this light she talked about. A little later toward evening, Bob saw something in the road allcurled up and he grabbed a blanket, covered it up and tried to lift it,but as he did, it uncurled and got up and staggered. It was ugly. Ithad a big head and eyes like empty sockets - black with no pupils.Long, thin legs and arms, and it looked like an emaciated old man. Itlooked odd, but had gentle movements. Bob talked to it and itresponded like it understood somewhat and made some responsivemovements. There was no resistance to Bob. It was leaking a clearfluid from the arm and Bob put a piece of cloth over it and it didn'tresist again. Then Bob carried it off the road and it looked to the sky.Then, someone else came running over from the desert side with agun and said he'd been following it and would take charge and for usto get out of there. So we did. Two days later, we were leaving andwent by the area and stopped to look around and we found it deadwith gunshot wounds where we'd left it. We left it there, but Bobtook a sample (that disappeared later.) 1955: Finally, one day Bob mentioned to me that he was going to a'crash-site' by a town outside of Alamogordo, Texas. Later that night,he came home and told me he'd need to talk to me and Nancy. Wewoke Nancy up and he sat her down and explained about the'creatures.' One in particular, he had just hit and killed on the way toa crash site. I had already seen plenty of strange phenomena andcreatures with him, so I knew (about them). But I never made aconnection until this moment when he talked of spacecraft and 'otherlife forms.' He was bent on Nancy knowing the 'truth' about theirexistence, but also the importance of neither of us telling anyone"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"because it could put us in danger. 'And people won't believe youanyway.' Over the years, I've forgotten so much and I'm only tellingmy daughter for her sake. She wants to know about her father. ButI'm telling you this stuff was weird and scary at the same time.\"To be continued in Part 14.Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
