We realized that we were really luckythat we did not have a nuclear accident and studies indicated that we were just a month orso away from it (potential melt down event).\" - Scott Portzline, Three Mile Island Alert Six-inch hole eaten away by leaking boric acid from a cracked reactor drive nozzle at the Davis Bessenuclear power plant in Toledo, Ohio. Discovered and photographed in 2002 and plant shut downto avoid potential core melt down. Photograph from Nucle ar Re gulatory Commission.April 5, 2004 Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and Washington, D. C. - The worst Americannuclear power plant accident began at 4:00 a.m. on March 28, 1979. The Unit 2 reactor atthe Three Mile Island nuclear power facility near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, overheated.Due to the loss of reactor coolant, fuel rods began to melt. Because the fuel rods weresticking up out of the lowered water level, the nuclear chain reaction could not becontrolled. The rods actually melted into the remaining water, dropped to the bottom of thereactor where enough collected to start another uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction.For five days, scientists and engineers struggled to prevent the unimaginable nightmare of acore melt down that would have poisoned all the Harrisburg population with radiation.Fortunately, the nuclear chain reaction was finally stopped, but a lot of radiation wasreleased into the atmosphere. On March 29, 1979 - the second day of the ongoing crisis -the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) reported a reading of 3,000 millirads per hourtaken above Three Mile Island. The 1979 President's Commission on Three Mile Islandfinally estimated that the radioactive release over thirty-one days to the environmentranged from 2.4 million to 13 million curies - or 13 megacuries.\"The total release of radioactivity to the enviroment from March 28 through April 27 hasbeen established as 13 to 17 curies of iodine and 2.4 million to 13 million curies of noblegases.\" (Page 31, Section 13, 1979 Report of the President's Commission on the Accident atThree Mile Island.) For comparison, all combined radioactive isotope contamination at theChernobyl melt down is estimated ato have been100 to 130 million curies, or 100 to 130megacuries.Here is how the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines curies, megacuries andother curie fractions: - Curie (Ci) is defined as 37 billion disintegrations per second.- Megacuries (MCi) are 1 million curies (1 x 106 Ci).Megacuries are used in measuring the very large amount of radioactivity releasedfrom nuclear weapons.- Picocuries (pCi) are 1 million millionth of a curie (1 x 10-12 Ci). Picocuries areused in measuring the typically small amount of radioactivity in air and water."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"- Millicuries (mCi), or 1/1000 Ci- Nanocuries (nCi), or 1 billionth of a curie.- RADs and Millirads: See More Information below. Any Evidence of Radiation Damage in Three Mile Island Region? Higher Cancer Rates On February 24, 1997, the National Institutes of Health issued a press release entitled\"Three Mile Island Nuclear Accident Data Revisited\" by Professor Steven Wing, M.D., andhis colleagues at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who published their studyof medical data about TMI community cancer rates in the February 24, 1997,Environmental Health Perspectives, the journal of the National Institute of EnvironmentalHealth Sciences. \"NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH------------------------------------------------------------------------Monday, Feb. 24, 199712:01 AM Eastern TimeThree Mile Island Nuclear Accident Data Revisited \"Exposure to radiation after the 1979 nuclear accident at Three Mile Island mayhave increased cancer among some Pennsylvanians downwind of the plant,according to a recalculation of data to be published Feb. 24 in Environmental HealthPerspectives, the journal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.The controversial new study was carried out by Professor Steven Wing andcolleagues at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The new studyinvolved re-analyzing data from a 1990 report that concluded the nation's worstcivilian nuclear accident was NOT responsible for excess cancers because radiationexposures were too low. However, the new analysis takes a contradictory position.Dr. Wing comments: 'Several hundred people at the time of the accidentreported nausea, vomiting, hair loss and skin rashes, and a number said theirpets died or had symptoms of radiation exposure. We figured that if that werepossible, we ought to look at [the data] again. After adjusting for pre-accidentcancer incidence, we found a striking increase in cancers downwind fromThree Mile Island... I would be the first to say that our study doesn't prove byitself that there were high-level radiation exposures, but it is part of a body ofevidence that is consistent with high exposures.' \"In 1998, U. S. District Court Judge Sylvia Ramob dismissed more than 2,000damage claims filed against the Davis-Besse power plant by nearby residents.\" In December 2002, the U. S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals found that the district courthad erred in excluding increased incidence of lung cancer data, but declined to hear anappeal of Judge Rambo's dismissal. Attorneys representing 1,990 remaining plaintiffs in theTMI case declared they would take no further legal action, despite their conviction that Dr.Wing's research indicated higher cancer rates after March 29, 1979, in the Three MileIsland region. 2003 Follow-Up On TMI Cancer Rates In November 2003, Dr. Wing published \"Objectivity and Ethics in Environmental HealthScience\" in the journal, Environmental Health Perspectives. He described informationfrom a spring 1987 survey of 450 people living with \"unobstructed views of TMI atdistances of between 3 and 8 miles.\" After the TMI accident, residents who had beenout-of-doors reported \" a metallic taste, nausea, vomiting, hair loss, erythema (redness ofskin caused by chemical, poisoning or burn). ...Residents reported 19 cancer deaths during1980-1984 (5 year period after nuclear disaster), compared with an expected number of2.6.\" \"We found positive relationships between accident dose estimates and cancer rates for allthree categories of cancer (lung cancer, leukemia, childhood cancers). The slope of thedose-response estimates was largest for leukemia, intermediate for lung cancer, andsmallest for all cancers. ...Lung cancer showed the most consistent dose-responserelationship across levels of dose.
