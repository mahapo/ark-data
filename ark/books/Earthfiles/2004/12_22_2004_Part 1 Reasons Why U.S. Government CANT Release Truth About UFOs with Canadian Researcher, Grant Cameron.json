December 21, 2004 Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada - Last month in Las Vegas at theMJ-12 UFO Crash/Retrieval Conference, Canadian researcher Grant Cameron and I talkedabout several reasons why the U. S. government continues to sustain a strict policy ofdenial about the extraterrestrial phenomenon even while it has back engineered physicalobjects retrieved from several UFO crashes since at least the early 1940s (For example,Cape Girardeau, Missouri, in 1941).Recently Grant told me he is working on a paper for lecture presentations in 2005 that willlist \"64 Reasons Why the U. S. Government Hasn't Released Truth About UFOs!\" His listis not completed, but Grant talked to me for Earthfiles and Dreamland about his growinglist of non-disclosure reasons (27 listed below), in spite of his conviction that all humansdeserve to know the truth about other life in the universe interacting with our planet.Interview:Grant Cameron, a building facility manager at the University of Manitoba; reporterand producer of www.presidentialufo.com, Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada: \"Why dothe people whoever control this why have they decided to cover it up? I've made twoassumptions:One is that they are not evil men. They might do evil things. They might be deludedor whatever. But I think the majority of them are people who think they are doingthe best for the American people, or whoever they think they are working on behalf.Two, the other thing I assume is there is a process of discussion and review. Therehave been numerous discussions about a possible split inside this control groupalleged to be MJ-12 (Majestic 12 appointed by President Harry S. Truman).Supposedly some want to release and some people don't want to release. Indirectlyworking in government here, I know if you are part of government, you spend anawful lot of your time with policies and protocols and procedures, so I am assumingthere is some sort of processed paperwork. It might be fifteen levels deep insecurity, but there is some sort of process in which someone has sat down, looked atthe whole UFO scene and the ET visitations - all the different aspects - and havemade a conscious decision to say, 'No, we're not going to release it.'Then I tried to look at if I were on their side and the prime example I always use is if youtake an honest man like Jimmy Carter. He went into the White House, had seen a UFO,was determined when he got into the White House to release the UFO files, went into theWhite House and it does appear that he was briefed on the subject. Then, according to theactress Shirley MacLaine, he said that it was true, there were occupants. He wanted toshine the 'sunshine laws' on the UFO subject to see how the people would react, but that hecould not and would not. That seems to indicate that he knew what the story was and hehad decided he couldn't and wouldn't release the UFO secrets.So, what I look at while I'm writing this article and what I've always thought about is: If Iwere given the same briefing that Jimmy Carter was given, would I change teams likeJimmy Carter did? We had a guy who actually was on our side and went to their side.Why?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"IF YOU WERE IN JIMMY CARTER'S SHOES, WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD BETHE REASONS HE DECIDED THAT KEEPING EVERYTHING SUPPRESSED IN APOLICY OF DENIAL IS STILL THE BEST POLICY?Jimmy Carter, I think, spelled it out himself why he decided to keep it a secret. He made astatement that I think some people have not heard. He stated that he was going to releasethe UFO files, but it had to do with national security, secret weapons he referred to, thatkind of stuff and said, 'I wouldn't release that, but I have no problem releasing the UFOfiles.'So, if you are a briefer and you wanted to turn the President and every President appearsto have turned (to non-disclosure side) and every President has gone along with thispolicy. Reasons For Non-Disclosure1) National security. Basically that sort of goes over all the 64 reasons it can encompassall of them, the national security. That's the big one, the main one, even though I haven'ttried to rate them in terms of importance. But national security in terms of if we releasedweapons information, if foreigners get hold of this. The government insiders could easilytie this into national security if we release the whole story. So, I think national security isnumber one.Inside national security, the government's priority is:2) Weapons development and military's Need-To-Know elite.3) Technology development lead time.4) Reverse engineering. Back-engineering of alien technologies from UFO crashretrievals and getting those technologies functional in the American space and corporate-industrial programs and patents. (See book: The Day After Roswell by Lt. Col. Philip J.Corso © 1989.) Trying to get as much done to develop this technology before we have torelease the truth. A Need To Know policy it's a concept that the military has. It's sort oflike, 'We're the military and we're going to do the thinking and therefore, we have a needto know and the general population does not. We are not going to release it because it'spart of the military. It's our secret. It's not part of what the population should know.'So you get this thing where someone has a TOP SECRET clearance. 'I am special and Ihave this need to know.' You want to maintain this sort of special status that you have.Some of the other ones that I looked at were:5) Complexity. When you start looking at all the 64 reasons, you realize that the UFOsituation and a lot of researchers know this, but the public does not know this it is actuallya very complex subject. It's not simply 'ET's are here.' There are all sorts of complicationsin terms of abductions and mutilations and all sort of things, crop circles. The more youlook at it the more complex it gets. That in itself is more reason why they are trying to sitback and understand it better. It's a very complex thing and very hard to explain to thepeople. That would be one of the reasons.6) Abduction phenomenon. I think that is one of the key reasons they don't release.George W. Bush just recently came to Canada. He made a speech in Halifax, Nova Scotia.In that speech, he tried to promote the idea that Canada should get involved with thisspace-based-weapons stuff. In there, he stated that to keep our people safe, that is themost solemn duty I have. Constitutionally, the President is responsible for the protection ofthe American people. Some of the estimates of abduction numbers run to 6 to 8 millionpeople. I think the President not only does not know how to stop abductions, I don't thinkhe even knows why abductions are taking place. So, this is the kind of thing that you can'tput the President or governments, for that matter in front of people to make them lookstupid. It's something they can't deal with and they are postponing it until they can getcontrol of it.7) Psychological warfare. If you look at the psychological warfare that's involved inabductions, this is like candy to intelligence agencies that you can actually abduct aforeign leader, go into his mind, find out what he is thinking, feed stuff into his mind. Thisis very powerful stuff they might want to work on behind the scenes.8) Animal mutilations. It sort of confirms the fact that there is an evil element to thisthing. Even when I researched, people believed they were angels of God, people whobelieved they were angels of the devil. The whole mutilation thing gets into the fact there"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"might be an evil element to the alien presence.OR EVEN JUST SURVIVAL THAT DEMANDS GENETIC HARVESTING. AND THEFACT THAT WE ARE KEPT IN THE DARK AND UNCONSCIOUS ABOUT OURPLANET AND ANIMALS AND OURSELVES BEING HARVESTED IN AND OFITSELF HAS A NEGATIVE UNDERBELLY.Sure, it's scary stuff. The media people could really spin this whole thing to make it lookvery bad.SO ON OUR LIST, WE START WITH NATIONAL SECURITY, AND THEN WE GO TOABDUCTIONS THAT ARE VERY COMPLEX. AFTER THAT THE WORLDWIDEANIMAL MUTILATIONS HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR AT LEAST 60 YEARS.AFTER YOU GET PAST THOSE THREE CATEGORIES, CAN YOU TICK OFF WHATOTHER ITEMS YOU HAVE ON YOUR GROWING LIST?9) Alien cover-up. The aliens are covering up as well, which I'm sure disturbs theAmerican government to no end. Why are the aliens not releasing? And yet, another onethat involves that is: Are the aliens in control? Have the aliens made, told the governmentto cover this thing up? Are they being controlled like the \"alien masters?\" So there is thiswhole thing that the aliens aren't releasing if they are staying in the background and notannouncing themselves, we're (human governments) not coming out first. There is this fearof why the aliens are not there.MEANING, WHY ARE THEY KEEPING IT SECRET AS WELL?Exactly, and that makes for distrust. Or that the aliens might have actually said, 'You can'trelease it.' We don't know. There might be something behind the scenes where the alienssay you can't release it (because they are) the \"alien masters.'10) Government gridlock: The whole thing that Whitley Strieber talked about when heinterviewed Lawrence Rockefeller. Lawrence Rockefeller, during the Clintonadministration, had tried to get the Clintons to release the UFO story through declassifyingeverything. The Clintons we know were very interested. Hillary was going through thirdparties to researchers. They were very interested. But when Lawrence actually sat downwith I think it was Hillary. Some people say the President was there, but I don't think hewas there. Hillary was there and actually went through the briefing (with Rockefeller) anddescribed to her why UFOs should be released, why this is an important subject. Hillarycame back after the briefing the next morning and said, 'Don't ever bring up the subjectagain.'Part of that was that the Clintons were the people who wanted to release it, but theycouldn't release it. They already had Monica Lewinsky. They had all sorts of scandalsgoing. Hillary had been tied in with this Jean Houston out of New York and channelingdead people (Eleanor Roosevelt). It was very embarrassing, so it was something that eventhough they wanted to do it, the Clinton Administration, it was a giggle factor thing wherethey didn't need it. It wasn't something that was going to get them anywhere, so theybasically backed away from trying to force disclosure.BUT YOUR IMPLICATION IS IN YOUR RESEARCH THAT CLINTON, THEPRESIDENT, DOES KNOW MORE ABOUT SOMETHING HAVING TO DO WITH ANEXTRATERRESTRIAL PRESENCE ON THE PLANET THAN HE HAS EVERADMITTED?Yes, and like everything else people don't realize the President does not have so muchpower. He can't just come in and take an idea and bring it out. That's not the way it works.You have to put it through Congress, you have to have the backing of Congress. You haveto have the lobbyists on your side. There are all sorts of different things that are involved.Even though Clinton wanted it, I was told inside the CIA that they (Hillary and Bill) wereboth looking. They were very interested in UFOs. They were contacting admirals anddifferent people and asking them about UFOs. The Clintons were very interested. Evenwhen I was lecturing at the Ozark conference last year, one woman came up to me andsaid her sister owned a barbecue restaurant where Bill and Hillary went and that they hada UFO sighting. So, there are all these indications of their interest. They asked WebsterHubble to go out and get the information on UFOs. They had a number of indications thatthey tried to get it and it was like they kept banging against the wall and finally decided itwas not worth it and gave up. They gave up on disclosure. They tried, but it's the same asJimmy Carter tried.IF CLINTON AND CARTER WERE UNACCEPTABLE TO THE MJ-12 POWERCONTROLLERS ON THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITY STORY,WOULDN'T YOU THINK THAT GEORGE W. BUSH, THE CURRENT PRESIDENT,WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE BECAUSE OF HIS CONSERVATIVE STANCE? IF SO, DOYOU THINK THERE IS ANY CHANCE THAT THIS ET STORY, THE TRUTH ABOUT"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"IT OR AT LEAST THE BEGINNING TRUTH, COULD OPEN UP IN THIS SECONDROUND OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION?I don't think so because of this: the Democrats want disclosure. It's like Bill Clinton hetalked about his new library that has a lot of glass and a lot of light and this is to show thatthe Clinton Administration was an open administration. They declassified 800 millionpages of documents. That was their thing. So was Jimmy Carter. The vast majority ofdocuments we have today came out during the Carter Administration. So, they wantedopenness, but because they were not liked by the military, they were cut out of the loop.The Republicans, on the other hand, they have the power and association with high endsof the military. The problem is that they work in an aspect of secrecy. Dick Cheney, forexample, the Vice President, one of his ideas is if you have the three branches ofgovernment - the judiciary, the legislative and the executive - he wants the executivebranch to be stronger. Therefore, you have a policy of no disclosure of any conversationsof anything that goes on inside the executive White House.And that is the policy the Bush Administration has used. You want to work on UFOs insecrecy because you don't want to air your dirty laundry, the things that are going on, thedisagreements, the things that are not working. You want to work in secrecy and keep itaway from other nations. That's the mentality that the Republican Administration seems tohave, sort of a paranoid mentality about the fact that the world is out to get us and thereare evil forces in the world and we are called by God to do this. You saw it in the ReaganAdministration and in this Bush Administration. That's why even though they have thepower George W. Bush made Roswell jokes when he went to Roswell, he made the jokeabout the unidentified object over town that morning and then jokingly said, 'Oh, no, thatwas me in Air Force One.'So he knows the story, he makes little jokes about it. He probably knows but for him hewould definitely see it as an aspect of military weapons development, back engineering,the fact that we have terrorism. This might help us to fight terrorism and North Korea andall the enemies we have around the world. To do it, we have to do it in secrecy. We can'tbe leaking stuff out. I think Dick Cheney is a big part of keeping things secret.YOU AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT WHAT SEEMS TO BE A PRETTY CLEARINDICATION THAT 4-STAR GENERAL WESLEY CLARK HAS HAD SOME KIND OFBRIEFING ON THE UFO STORY. IF HE HAS, WOULDN'T CHENEY, WOULDN'TBUSH, WOULDN'T THE CURRENT HIGH RANKING PEOPLE IN THE WHITEHOUSE, ALL HAVE HAD A BRIEFING AS WELL?Yes, I think all those people have been briefed. I asked Vice President Cheney right afterhe came into the White House. I asked the briefing question: 'Mr. Cheney, in all your jobsin government, have you ever been briefed on the subject of UFOs? If so, when was it andwhat were you told?'And he said, 'If I had been briefed on that subject' he did not mention the name, he said'that subject' 'it probably would have been classified and I wouldn't be talking about it.'That comes down to the military aspect that it's tied into national security. You have tohave security in these programs and I'm going to play the good role and not going to talkabout it.Wesley Clark was more indirect and tried to talk around the subject the same as GeorgeBush, Sr. He was asked on the campaign trail and he had been Director of CentralIntelligence the bushes are seen as very strong leaders, going to war. But Bush when hecame in was seen as a very weak Vice President. he had been Director of the CIA. Whenhe was asked by Charles Hufford, 'Come on, you were CIA Director. You know what'sgoing on. Are you going to release the UFO information?' He said, 'Yes, I know a little bit.'Almost what Wesley Clark had said, 'Yes, I know a little bit about what's going on.'SO NATIONAL SECURITY KEEPS COMING AROUND FULL CIRCLE AS ONE OFTHE MAIN REASONS WHY THIS COVER-UP HAS BEEN PERPETUATED FOR ATLEAST 60 YEARS FROM THE TRUMAN ADMINISTRATION, MAYBE EVENBEFORE. AND THE ANIMAL MUTILATIONS AND ABDUCTION SYNDROMECOMPLICATE THE ABILITY OF THIS GOVERNMENT, OR ANY GOVERNMENT,TO OPEN UP THIS COMPLEX AND POSSIBLY DANGEROUS SUBJECT. ON YOURLIST OF TRYING TO SAY 64 REASONS FOR WHY THE POLICY OF DISCLOSURESHOULD STILL BE IN PLACE, WHAT ELSE IS ON YOUR LIST?11) Population resistance. The fact that the population will resist any sort of attempt tointegrate aliens into society. They fear this. some of these things are what people fear, theyare not 100% sure, but we are better off just leaving off. That's something governmentinsiders are scared of population resistance.12) Collapse in belief systems. It's scientific people who are going to really take a bath onsuddenly realizing the vast majority of things they believed are wrong."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"13) Religious collapse. How are the Arabs going to deal with this, for example? You can'tjust look at Americans. Worldwide, how are different cultures going to deal with this wholescenario?14) Past lying statements. The fact that you are tied into lying for 60 years, you are sortof stuck. You have to keep telling one lie to cover up the other lies of the past.15) Old style conservatives. This is not a big issue. But, basically it's that in religions, youhave old style conservatives who resist. Thus, new ideas aren't born; old ideas just die way.More and more of the young people believe in ETs and the older people don't want newconcepts. It's conservatives that are blocking release of different truths.16) Kick backs and profits. Behind the scenes is probably a very highly classifiedprogram and there is probably a lot of money exchanging hands, a lot of kickbacks, a lot ofpeople who are going to fight tooth and nail to keep the system the way it is because thereare a lot of people making money on the technology and what's going on. They are notgoing to give that up without a fight.17) Loss of power. Whether it's government or people running the thing, you are going tolose if the system changes with the release of the extraterrestrial truth. The people who arein power now are no longer going to be in power. That's almost for certain. These peopledon't want the power to shift away from them.18) Dependence on oil. The entire economy is based on oil. It's the whole fact that if weare so dependent, so used to oil-driven engines, that we can't break that tie. We are soreliant upon oil it's almost like an addiction to a drug. Another big reason tied to oil is:19) Crash of the stock market. I believe the stock market would crash. I was first warnedabout this when I used to study the guy, Wilbert Smith, who used to run the Canadiangovernment's UFO program. One of his close associates was a military scientist who didthe metallurgy work when pieces came up from the United States to Canada to beanalyzed. He did the metallurgic work. I had a number of interviews with him back in the1970s. He sort of stopped the conversation and said, 'Grant, let me tell you something. Iwant to warn you about something. If you know they are going to disclose the UFO storytomorrow morning, I'm telling you, I'm warning you, sell everything you've got todaybecause tomorrow nothing is going to be worth anything. When you think about that, it'sactually true. The stock market works because people are going to buy stocks according towhat they think a stock will be worth tomorrow. You want to make money on it. If youthink a stock is going to be worth less tomorrow, you're not going to buy the stock. Assoon as the UFO truth is released, stocks become worth literally nothing. Everybody whohas oil stocks will start to sell. Anyone who feels tied in, whether it's the car industry,anything that has to do with engines they are going to figure 'I have to get out before mything melts down.'So, why would the President and his advisers rock the boat? Why would they take the bigchance? We are doing OK. Let's spend another ten years, we can get another pile ofanswers to abductions, mutilations, back-engineering ET technologies and all the differentthings we're working on. If you disclose ten years from now, we'll be a lot farther ahead indealing with the problems we're going to have and in back-engineering the technology thanwe are right now. 'So, Mr. President, why take the chance? Why would you go out on thelimb and risk people panicking?'\"Continued in Part 2 - How Does U.S. Government Reverse Its Policy of Lies and DenialsAbout ETs?More Information:For more information about MJ-12, the \"Secret Government\" in charge of ET research andcover-up, please see other Earthfiles reports: 'MJ-12':· 12/10/2004 -- Part 3: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation?· 12/10/2004 -- Part 4: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation?· 12/07/2004 -- Part 2: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation?· 12/04/2004 -- Part 1: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation?· 11/03/2004 -- Gen.
