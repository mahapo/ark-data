October 20, 2004 Pollok, Texas - I have been receiving dozens of e-mails from peoplearound the world concerning the Pollok animal that some refer to as a \"Chupa,\" after thechupacabra mystery in Puerto Rico in the mid-1990s. The most common explanation hasbeen a coyote with mange. Manuel and Tammi Rego sent the photograph below of amangy coyote shot in the ribs. When you compare the known mangy coyote with the animal shot in Pollok, Texas, thereare similarities. The strange Elmendorf animal with the spots on its body shot in May 2004,is also shown below. This week, BBC news in England reported that a \"mystery creature\" was photographed inLisvane, a suburb of northern Cardiff. The Welsh Mountain Zoo's Zoological Director saidit might be a \"young kangaroo.\" The body was described as grey with a pointed nose,resembling somewhat the body shapes of the Elmendorf and Pollok creatures. Several others insist the Pollok and Elmendorf animals must be Xoloitzquintle, Mexicanhairless dogs. See 07-31-04 Earthfiles. Many people have also e-mailed about theTasmanian Tiger, Thylacine, which is supposed to be extinct and has stripes. You cancompare the dogs and tiger from the photographs below.Coyote With MangeCoyote with mange, shot in the rib cage. Image by Manuel and Tammi Rego.

It is contagious to other pets and occurs inmany different animals. It causes intense itchiness, especially affecting the ear margins,elbows, and face. People can pick up this disease from their pet and show symptoms ofitching, but it goes away by itself in a short time and does not require treatment in mostcases.

Today our Judge, who has extensiveexperience with dogs (he raises Brittany Spaniels) remarked in court that the'chupacabras' in Elmendorf and East Texas (Pollok) were nothing more thancoyotes with 'Sarcophagus Mange, according to a vet friend of his.\"2) October 19, 2004From Neuropathology researcher in Dallas, Texas: \"My colleague sent yourEarthfiles link to me. We are most interested to hear the genetic analysisresults and to find what gender the deceased animals are. Let us know if youwill post to Earthfiles? This has really caught our interests as animal loversand scientists.\" 3) October 18, 2004\"I thought I would write to let you know I have seen the strange creature inOakville, Ontario, Canada as well. The pictures and descriptions matchexactly the description I gave my friends and family trying to make themunderstand this strange animal I had seen. It is difficult in your heart youknow what you have seen, but your brain has trouble because you can'tcategorize it because it is unlike anything you have ever heard of or seenbefore. Everyone chalked it up to a genetically messed up, mangy coyote. Yet,another lady and myself who had both seen it on different occasions knew itwas different.\"I am a perfectly healthy, sane 31-year-old divorced mother of one, whoworks for my father's company. I have seen this creature on two differentoccasions and there is no mistaking it. I also have a lot of experience workingwith animals and am familiar with wolves/coyote/foxes/deer. What I saw wasnone of those. It was exactly what you see in the pictures you show. I don'tknow if I should be glad or concerned that there are more of them out there. Itwas truly bizarre. Not to mention everyone thought I was nuts (except for theother lady that saw it) because in their minds how could something like that Iwas describing exist, especially around here without people knowing about it?At least I feel better knowing that other people have seen it, too, and that theyknow what it's like to know what you have seen but have no one able orwilling to believe you. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I'd probably beskeptical, too.It's a little hard to believe that you could see a creature around here thatreminds you of a deer/coyote/jackal/hyena/Mexican hairless, all in one.\" 4) October 20, 2004\"I forwarded the link to the photo of the \"Lufkin Animal\" to my Showdogs-Lemail list. We are a large group of dog fanciers from all over the world.Some folks thought this might be a Xolocuintli, or large Mexican hairlessdog. It was obviously not well cared for, and as David says they are foundin the wild on occasion, and can automatically be registered with theMexican Kennel Club if captured.WOW!!!!! They should contact the Mexican KC.That does look like a Xolo, in severe poor condition and indeed, severeover bite. It is said that even up to recent years they still were found in thewild. I don't know of any specific case, but if you get one out of the blue, theMexican KC will give you automatic full registration.\"More Information:"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Please see other Earthfiles reports in the Earthfiles Archive:· 10/14/2004 -- Another \"Chupacabra\" Shot in Texas· 07/31/2004 -- Strange Animal Shot by Elmendorf, Texas Farmer· 07/19/2002 -- Unusual Animal Deaths and Unidentified Aerial Lights in Argentina· 06/15/2002 -- Cattle Mutilations In LaPampa, Argentina· 06/01/1999 -- Puncture Wounds On Dogs In Woodleaf, North CarolinaCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
