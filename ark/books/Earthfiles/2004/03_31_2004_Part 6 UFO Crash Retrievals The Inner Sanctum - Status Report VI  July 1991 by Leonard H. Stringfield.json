Len Stringfield - continued: THE \"ROSWELL\" ERA: INSIDERS BARE SECRETS Survivors in-the-know, going back to the \"Roswell\" UFO crash era, both before and afterthe established date of July 2, 1947, are thinning out. For most of the few remaining, so aretheir memories when they try to recapture the details of the role they played in the dramaof events. While we might never be privy to the whole \"inside,\" unexpurgated story hiddenunder the lid of secrecy, I believe it should behoove all of us in research to get all the factswe can from these old-timers - now. The so-called Roswell era was a time when officialdom, already baffled by the foo-fighterof WWII, was suddenly faced with a new crisis of incalculable consequences - the crashesof alien saucers and crews in the New Mexico desert, circa 1947. Almost instantly after thefirst shock wave, secrecy prevailed, understandably, and up went the proverbial wall.Rumors and yet-to-be-proved documents have surfaced over the years about the earlycrisis, but the wall has held firm - never to be seriously breached,. Senator BarryGoldwater, with his political clout, tried. So did Major Donald Keyhoe along with apowerful NICAP (National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena.) Both failed. But now the wall of secrecy weakens a little with some old hands emerging to tell abouttheir part or knowledge of the untold story. Credit must go to them, of course, for theircourage however. If there is praise, it should be shared by those who knew the value oftime in relation to aging people and managed to get their \"pasts\" on record. To this end, Timothy Cooper - an energetic sleuthing newcomer who surfaced to StanFriedman and me in the fall of 1990 - has performed well. A resident of Big Bear Lake,California, and a member of MUFON, Cooper is professionally an experienced industrialtechnical writer and works for a licensed private investigation agency. For this status report, Cooper shares information from four sources each delving into thecrash/retrievals of yester-year. Since the name Roswell has become a generic name for anyand all crashes in New Mexico, Cooper and I cannot yet determine if his collectiveinformation is applicable to the famous Roswell crash of July 2, 1947, or to crashes orlandings in other areas in the same time frame. After receiving Cooper's introductory letter to which I responded by phone for anhour-long exchange of expressions of mutual trust, I soon received the following report,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"properly edited, which he got firsthand from a life-long close friend: THE CLOSE FRIEND (submitted to Stringfield by Timothy Cooper) \"This is my interview on September 9, 1990, with a retired Air Force enlisted manwho was stationed at Holloman AFB in the month of July, 1947. My source wishedto remain anonymous and will be known as 'Bob.' Bob was a technical sergeant stationed at Holloman at the time when the U. S. ArmyAir Force recovered the wreckage of a craft described as a flying saucer. Bob's mainduty was to oversee the printing for the Operations Section at Holloman. It was inthis capacity that he became involved with sensitive papers and photos documentingthe recovery of a crashed UFO in 1947. According to Bob, he was ordered by the Holloman Base Commander who wasColonel Paul F. Helmlek (confirmed by Stanton Friedman and the Alamogordo News,dated July 17, 1947) to print a typed report of 50-pages that included some black andwhite photographs. Bob told me what was unusual about this request was that thebase commander pulled up at the printing facility with a complement of MPs armedwith Tommy guns who surrounded the building. Helmlek came into the sergeant'soffice and ordered everyone to go home except him. After his order was carried out, Bob told me, Helmlek pulled out a portfoliocontaining a report and gave it to him and said, 'Print this.' Bob said he told thecolonel that it would be difficult and would take a long time to do it without his staff.The colonel became stern with him and ordered him to do it now. Bob told me that the report basically contained information about the crash orlanding of a UFO at White Sands Missile Range. He was ordered not to look at thecontents and to forget what he saw in the photos. Bob said that he proceeded to shoot camera film of the report for off-set plates andto lay glass-dot screens for the black and white photos (stills from a large formatpress camera, he believes). What he saw in the photos was amazing. They depicted asaucer-like craft on the ground. He doesn't remember how many photos there were.He said the craft was shiny and metallic with no apparent markings nor any visiblepropulsion system. Since this event happened back in 1947, he could not recall thefeatures of the craft nor the contents of the report. I asked Bob how long this printing assignment took? Finished the same day, he said -adding that he was ordered to put the negatives and plates in the security safe andthat some security personnel would come later for them. He did not say how manycopies were made, only that each copy was numbered. Colonel Helmlek took all thecopies and left. I asked if he could remember the precise date in July. He could not.\" Following up by phone on October 19, 1990, Cooper asked Bob once again if he knew thedate on the report he printed for Colonel Helmlek. His source interrupted and said, 'That issecret.\" Cooper enclosed a second set of papers relating to his interview with Bob, most of it asummary of the foregoing information or a dialogue of instances where Bob, unable toanswer questions, often resorted to speculation. But in every instance, from my point ofview, his responses were forthright, honest and based on his keen knowledge of events inthe Roswell era. One item, however, stood out, when Cooper questioned his source aboutMJ-12, Bob's response follows: \"He at first hesitated to answer for a few seconds; he said that there was agovernment and military working group in existence during his tenure at Ent AFB(Colorado). He knows this to be true because he said the classifications of printedmaterial for NORAD was given priority of Above (Ultra) Top Secret with a '12'"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"designation. He did not know what the classification '12' was, but knew it was 'hand-carried by armed courier with military escort.'\" There was no question that Cooper's source, Bob, had an endless well of knowledge aboutUFO crashes in the summer of 1947 in New Mexico. Cooper's inability to extract definitelocations from him might have been due to vague recall of available records. As we allknow now, the \"Roswell\" at Corona is reasonably well established. However, Bob wasunaware of it by either name. Yet, he is aware of a crash landing near White Sands. aboutwhich we in research have only the barest information. And there were other crash cases inNew Mexico in the summer of 1947, the latest surfacing in 1990 with lots of details from anew firsthand witness, Gerald Anderson, who claims as a child with his family he witnesseda crashed disc in the Plains of San Agustin. Still others, in the same time-frame, have beenreported in New Mexico's remote and wild mountainous regions, places with strange namesand hardly any details. Persistent, Cooper again tried his key source, Bob, and another well-informed contact,hoping to get more definitive answers about the crashes or at least some new clues. OnApril 28, 1991, he called to relate that he had new information from Bob which follows: Provided by Timothy CooperThird interview with retired USAF M/Sergeant, April 6, 1991Location: Confidential Tularosa west of Roswell near the eastern border of White Sands Missile Range. \"This interview was conducted under relaxed conditions as a social visit. The subjectof my conversation with Bob was about the targeting method employed by the U.S.Air Force during the bombing of Iraq. We discussed the ability of the bombs tofollow a laser beam to its target. Bob said that 'smart' bombs were developed at theTularosa Bomb Range after WWII and was no great deal. I asked him about theactivities at Alamogordo Field (Holloman) while he was stationed there. Eventually,Bob was in the mood to talk about a 'special job' he was personally asked to do bythe base commander, Colonel Paul Helmlek. Q. Do you remember what was in the Top Secret Ultra report you were ordered toprint by Colonel Helmlek? A. Yes. As I recall, it was a technical report of a radar target that was tracked andfilmed over the North Range (Tularosa). It was a report of a landing of a saucer-typecraft. There were Askania (movie) and still films taken. Q. Where was the filming taken? A. On the North Range (Area) of White Sands Missile Range. I believe it was nearTularosa, but inside the range."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Q. How were the pictures taken? What cameras? What unit? A. By Askania and Mitchell tracking cameras. A 1st Sergeant by the name of Paul,an Askania camera crew chief, told me that he shot some of the footage from a truckmounted tripod somewhere near Tularosa. The unit was the White Sands Trackingand Photographic section of the TOPPO Battalion. I remember a party going on atthe Rocker Club (Staff NCO), I am sure it was on the 4th of July (1947). Paul waspaged by phone to report to the base commander's office. I did not see him for over aweek. This was unusual because Askania Ops did not work at night. I think on oraround Friday next is when I was approached by Colonel Helmlek for a priorityprinting job (see my first interview). When I did see Paul, he was very quiet andseemed nervous. This was not like him. Paul was a robust and hardy fellow. Abomber pilot who saw much action and seen men die. He was not himself. He finallytold me that all the tracking teams were sent out to the Tularosa area with theirequipment. He said that S-2 sent photographers out into the North Range on July 4-8,1947. Some of the Askania film was taken from a truck and on an airplane (trucksand aircraft appeared in some of the motion picture films). The stills were taken fromthe air and on the ground. I think various types of cameras were used. Some of themotion picture film was in color. They must have used flares or illumination roundsfrom mortars. Q. What did you see in the pictures? How many were there? A. I remember a dozen or more 8 x 10 B&W glossies of the craft resting near ahillside. It appeared slightly tilted. The craft appeared to be a large, rounddome-shaped, almost egg-shaped disc with a flat bottom. It looked bigger than aB-29 in size. The personnel in the foreground gave a sense of scale to it. I guess itwas approximately 100 feet in diameter and about 15-20 feet high at the center. Isaw a rim or a dihedral edge near the bottom of the craft in one photo. I saw nolanding gear, exhaust ports or windows. I did see one access opening or door-likeopening that seemed to open outward. Some stills are of the base technical personnelsurrounding the craft. Some were wearing suits. They were climbing on top. Therewere some close-ups of the craft's structure, but can't recall what it looked like. Q. What do you remember of the technical report itself? A. It was a technical description of the craft. It was prepared for the AMC and theATIC. It did not analyze, but recorded dimensional, structural and materialspecifications. The report also contained radar data. There was a section thatincluded the possible flight path, guidance and navigation systems, propulsion theoryand flight controls. Part of the report was done by a German scientific team headedby Ernst Steinhoff and Wernher von Braun. There were a few aeronautical engineersflown into Holloman (Alamogordo Field) from ATIC. I did not read the report per se,but recall some topics it covered. It was approximately 50 pages with a lot ofphotographs. I did not process any motion picture film at that time. Bob said he remembers another 1st Sergeant that was an A/E mechanic that also wasa pilot. He flew in some top Air Force Generals (Twining, Canon, LeMay,Vandenberg, Doolittle, Wainwright and some other high-ranking brass) to HollomanAFB. His name was Robert G. Baines (was later assigned to fly generals of USAE). Ithink General Groves was flown in with Oppenheimer, Bush, von Neuman, vonKarman I think (their names were mentioned in the report). I do not think anyonehad any idea what kind of craft this was or what it was doing there. The base wassealed for a week or so. Even the airstrip and hangars were off-limits to most of thebase. I did not see any reference to any 'astronauts' being taken into custody, but Iheard there was an armored vehicle sent to the landing site along with some 'meat-wagons.' The base dispensary was under MP guard at one section of the building, butI think it was not related."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"There were a lot of former bomber pilots that got out of the Air Force after the war,but later came back in because there were no jobs. There were not airplanes eitherfor them. So those pilots came back in the Army Air Force as Staff and 1st Sergeants.Some were unassigned. They came back in so they could complete 20 years andretire. Some were assigned to photographic units, parachute sections, crash andretrieval teams and so on. All of them were professionals. Highly trained and skilledpilots and technicians composed most of the Alamogordo Field's White Sands MissileRange operations. Bob said in 1948, orders were coming in for a lot of people at Alamogordo. Bobstayed on there until 1952 and was assigned to Weisbaden, West Germany.\"Continued in Part 7.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
