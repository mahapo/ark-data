Ten animals have been airlifted by helicoptersto veterinarian pathologists trying to find an answer for the bizarre paralysis. So far, no answers,as the numbers of disabled elk keep rising. Image courtesy WGFD.March 9, 2004 Cheyenne, Wyoming - On February 8, 2004, Wyoming coyote hunterscontacted the Wyoming Game and Fish Department in Rawlins to report their finding twolive elk down on their chests, unable to rise. The location was about 15 miles southwest ofRawlins on land actually owned and managed by the Wyoming Game and FishDepartment. A Rawlins field biologist went to investigate, found the two elk andsubsequently, other field investigators found another 80 live, paralyzed elk. The number ofdebilitated animals has now risen to almost 300 today. Nine more, all alive, were found theweekend of March 6-7, 2004. Sadly, all found alive and paralyzed have been euthanized toput them out of their misery.This week I talked about the baffling phenomenon with Tom Reed, Publications Supervisor,Wyoming Game and Fish Department, Cheyenne, Wyoming.Interview:Tom Reed, Publications Supervisor, Wyoming Game and Fish Department, Cheyenne,Wyoming: \"It's a very odd malady. These wild elk are all pretty alert. They are verycognizant of what is going on around them. They are very afraid when our people approachthem, but they can't get away. They can't rise. This is a very harsh environment. It's asagebrush zone that is basically high desert with sub-zero wind-chill factors at this time ofyear. Lots of snow and wind and very remote area and so we've been euthanizing theseanimals. Probably the majority of them at least 2/3's of them have been euthanized by ourfield personnel because of the harsh conditions. This thing, whatever it is, is not reallykilling the animals, but is debilitating them so badly that if we don't take care of them rightaway in terms of euthanizing them, they die a pretty horrible death. They eat everythingaround them that they can reach right down to the dirt and then they die of starvation ordehydration."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Above: Wyoming Game and Fish Department (WGFD) field investigators examiningone of the paralyzed elk. Two-thirds have been found alive and the WGFD are euthanizing them to put themout of their misery. Below: the other one-third are dead at the scene like the animal below. Images courtesyWGFD.So, it's a very emotional thing for our people because wildlife is something that we verymuch care about and we don't want to see these animals suffering. It's been an ongoingthree weeks of some real hard times emotionally and getting these animals taken care of.And this is a widely scattered area, probably about 50 square miles of public and privateland that they are scattered over. As you can imagine, we have also used a few folks in theair in helicopters as well as fixed wing aircraft to try to find more elk. But it's very hard tofind them. Some of them we find are too late to really help them and put them out of theirmisery which is very distressing because you can tell that they died a pretty hard death. Veterinarian Pathologists Still Have No Cause for the ParalysisWHAT HAVE PATHOLOGISTS LEARNED SO FAR?So far, we've necropsied about ten elk and we've ruled out a lot of the majorbacteriological, viral and many of the toxic metals have all been ruled out. For example,arsenic, selenium, manganese, lead, zinc all that has been ruled out as possible toxicpoisoning. Also ruled out are all the common bacteriological things and ruled out chronicwasting disease.Ten paralyzed elk have been airlifted to veterinarian pathologistsfor euthanization and fresh necropsies in an effort to find out what is causingthe paralysis of otherwise healthy animals, mostly all pregnant females."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"So Far, No Evidence of Prion Disease (Chronic Wasting)HAVE THEY FOUND ANY PRIONS (Chronic Wasting Disease Similar to Mad CowDisease) IN ANY OF THESE ANIMALS?No, no, completely unrelated to chronic wasting disease. And the thing about it is that theseare very healthy animals from every appearance. They are almost all breeding age cows, 3to 5-year-olds. The fetuses are in great state of development. They are exactly what youwould expect elk this time of year to be in. The bone marrow and fat content andeverything are absolutely fabulous. So, it's not a wasting disease or starvation type ofdisease. We are really keying in on possible toxin either in the environment or somethingthat was man-caused.IS THERE ANYTHING THAT VETERINARIAN PATHOLOGISTS ARE PURSUINGSINCE THIS SOUNDS LIKE SOME KIND OF NERVE DISEASE PROBLEM?Literally, there could be hundreds of different types of toxins that could cause thesesymptoms. We really aren't eliminating anything. We are just going step-by-step eliminatingthose toxins and certainly for a small agency such as ours, it is very time consuming andvery costly. It's going to be a repeated long process of eliminating of each of these toxins. No Other Animals or Scavengers Have Been AffectedHAVE YOU FOUND ANY OTHER ANIMALS IN THAT 50 SQUARE MILE AREATHAT SEEM TO BE AFFECTED THE SAME WAY AS THE ELK?That's a great question, Linda, and honestly no. The answer to that is that this is onlyaffecting elk. In that area, there are cows, horses, antelope and a few deer and nothing hasbeen affected but the elk. That is very disconcerting to us because elk are such a veryhardy, tough animal. They are built for really tough winters, tough conditions.HAVE SCAVENGERS THAT HAVE FED ON THE FEW CARCASSES THAT YOU'VEFOUND THAT ARE ACTUALLY DEAD HAVE YOU FOUND ANY DEADSCAVENGERS?We haven't. In fact, the carcasses of the animals that we are euthanizing, we are leaving outthere as well. It is public land and there are a ton of scavengers eagles, coyotes, ravens,magpies, crows all of those animals are looking great. So, they are all doing fine. There isno indication that whatever this toxin is it's jumping from species to species as theyconsume carrion. What Would Target Only Elk Central Nervous System?THIS SEEMS VERY BIZARRE AND I WONDER IF TALKING WITH VETERINARIANPATHOLOGISTS OR BIOLOGISTS OR ZOOLOGISTS, HAVE YOU HAD ANYONEHYPOTHESIZE WHAT WOULD TARGET JUST AN ELK'S CENTRAL NERVOUSSYSTEM?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Right. Bizarre is a great word for it. It's got everyone scratching their head about it andcertainly there have been a bunch of hypotheses flying around out there and that's why Ithink people are keying in on something the elk consumed and something that would beconsumed by just elk.W H AT W O U L D T H AT B E ?We don't know. We just don't know. We are looking for answers. We've got people out inthe field right now. Antelope are typically a browsing animal. Horses and cattle are grazinganimals. Elk do both. So that's disconcerting for us because we just plain do not know rightnow. We've got people out in the field collecting plant samples and also, looking for moreelk that might be down. We'll get to the bottom of it one way or another.Certainly, the Wyoming State Veterinarian Laboratory in Laramie, Wyoming, is probablythe tops in the country in terms of narrowing in on things like that. The definitive work onsuch things as chronic wasting disease comes right out of that laboratory. So, we've gotsome great professionals on this and hope to get to the bottom of it.WHICH MAKES IT EVEN MORE AMAZING THAT THEY ARE STUMPED AFTER AMONTH.Exactly. All the usual suspects have been eliminated and we're fairly standard proceduresto eliminate them. Now, it's going to be something a little bit odder that folks have not seen.OF THE 300 ELK YOU HAVE EITHER EUTHANIZED OR FOUND DEAD SO FAR INA MONTH, DO YOU HAVE NEW CASES THAT SUGGEST THIS IS AN ONGOINGPROBLEM?Yes, we found another 9 over the weekend. Five of those elk looked like they had beendown for some time. These were all live elk, all nine were alive. But the five were almostnot alive, right on the border of dying. Four that looked like they had just recently beenaffected by whatever it is they've gotten into. It's disconcerting to us that this is stillcontinuing.\"Website:http://gf.state.wy.us/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
