November 17, 2004 Darmstadt, Germany - SMART-1 is the first space probe theEuropean Space Agency (ESA) has ever launched to the moon. SMART stands for \"SmallMissions for Advanced Research in Technology.\" This is also the first time that ESA hastried an \"electric primary propulsion in space,\" which is an ion engine that uses aHall-effect thruster fueled by xenon gas and powered by solar energy. SMART-1 waslaunched in September 2003 with the plan to make 332 orbits around the Earth, each onegoing further and further until its experimental ion drive was fired at 05:24 UT, November15, 2004, to bring the spacecraft into lunar orbit. The engine will be fired repeatedly overthe next two months to lower the spacecraft into an operational orbit of 3000 x 300kilometers by January 13, 2005. In September 2003, ESA's SMART-1 was launched with the goal of expanding each of 332 orbitsaround the Earth as shown in this computer simulation. As the spacecraft neared the moon, its orbits werealtered by the moon's gravity which helped pull SMART-1 into its first lunar orbiton November 15, 2004. Image © 2002 by Medialab. SMART-1 ObjectivesSMART-1's mission is to orbit the moon for at least six months. ESA describes its goals thisway:\"The moon's scarred face gives an impression of what the Earth looked like around 4billion years ago, when comets and asteroids rained on the newly formed planets of the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Solar System, creating craters large and small. The Earth has mostly healed its wounds, butthe Moon has scarcely changed since 3.5 billion years ago, when molten lava made theflat, dark features called maria.From their six landings during NASA's Apollo program 1969-72, astronauts brought rocksamples home for analysis in the world's laboratories. Three unmanned Soviet spacecraftalso recovered Moon rocks. Scientists prized them as samples of the primordial mineralsthat went into building the Moon and the Earth, and as chroniclers of impacts. However,these samples were mostly from the near-side equatorial region. The far side of the Moonand polar regions, which have a quite different geological history, were not sampled.Small American spacecraft, such as the Clementine and Lunar Prospector, went into orbitaround the Moon in 1994 and 1998, carrying a variety of remote-sensing instruments toexplore the whole lunar surface. Lunar Prospector also mapped the Moon's gravity anddiscovered magnetic regions. However, many unanswered questions still perplex the lunarscientists.SMART-1's camera AMIE will enable scientists to study the Moon's topography andsurface texture once again. It measures visible light at a million points in a field of view 5degrees wide, and filters can select yellow light, red light or very short infrared rays. Bylooking at selected regions from different angles, and under different lighting conditions,AMIE will provide new clues to how the lunar surface has evolved.With longer infrared rays, the infrared spectrometer SIR will map the surface distributionof minerals such as pyroxenes, olivines and feldspars. It will do this in far more detail thanClementine did, when it scanned the lunar surface at six different infrared bands. SIRdistinguishes about 256 wavelength bands, from 0.9 to 2.4 microns. The mineralogy willreveal effects of cratering and maria formation, and the nature of subsurface layersexposed by fractures in the Moon's crust. Looking for Ice in Dark CratersAny water on the lunar surface would be very helpful in the creation of permanent baseson the Moon. However, to have survived, the water must be in the form of ice in placesalways hidden from the Sun, where the temperature never rises above -170 C. Such darkplaces exist, notably in the bottom of small craters in the polar regions.The most difficult task for the SMART-1 scientists is to peer into the darkness with SIR,looking for the infrared signature of water ice and perhaps of frozen carbon dioxide andcarbon monoxide. By definition, no direct light falls in the target areas. However, raysfrom nearby crater rims, catching the sunshine, may light the ice sufficiently for SIR todetect it, once data from many passes has been collected. Did Moon Form After Small PlanetCollided with Earth 4.5 Billion Years Ago?The fashionable theory is that the Moon is the result of a collision during the birth of theSolar System 4500 million years ago. When the Earth was nearly complete, a giganticwandering asteroid the size of Mars supposedly collided with our planet, flinging vaporizedrock and debris from both bodies into space. Some of it went into orbit around the Earth,and solidified to make the Moon.The impact would have greatly altered the outer layers of the Earth also. Fullerunderstanding of both the Earth and the Moon depends crucially on confirming or refutingthis theory.If the theory is correct, the Moon should contain less iron than the Earth, compared tolighter elements such as magnesium and aluminum. By measuring the relative amounts ofchemical elements comprehensively for the very first time, SMART-1 can make asignificant contribution to this momentous scientific issue.X-rays from the Sun cause atoms in the lunar surface to fluoresce, emitting X-rays of theirown. The precise energy carried by each X-ray is a signature of the element emitting it.D-CIXS is the X-ray spectrometer on-board SMART-1 that can detect these signatures.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"SMART-1 by European Space Agency.Websites:http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/area/index.cfm?fareaid=10Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
