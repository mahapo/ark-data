Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Part 8: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases © 2008 by Linda Moulton Howe “A nthony told me the small, grey, non-humans lived for a long time. He also said that knowledge could be transferred from a dying or dead non-human into a replacement body.” - “S tein,” Former Army/CIA UFO Analyst R eturn to Part 1 November 16, 2008 Albuquerque, New Mexico - My June 29, 1998, interview with Stein at his Florida home continues from Part 7. “A ntony Barden said the smelting of gold was the big thing the small Greys taught the Incas – at least that’s what he understood from telepathic communication. WHICH CAPTURED BEING DID THE CIA GET THAT INFORMATION FROM? The 3-foot-tall Greys. HOW DID THE ALIEN KNOW? It apparently was saying he and other beings with him had actually taught the Incas, so that would make that alien communicating with us very old, centuries old. DID ANTHONY BARDEN COMMENT ABOUT THAT? Yes, Anthony told me the small, grey, non-humans lived for a long time. He also said that knowledge could be transferred from a dying or dead non-human into a replacement body. HAD ANTHONY BARDEN RECEIVED A BRIEFING AT CIA HEADQUARTERS ABOUT CLONING THE REPLACEMENT BODIES? [ Editor's Note: For more information about life force transfer from bodies to cloned replacement bodies, please see Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness © 1998 by Linda Moulton Howe in Earthfiles Shop. ] No, I don’t think so. I don’t remember him mentioning cloning, but he said the replacement bodies and very long lives of the non-humans were brought up in meetings at the CIA. These things either live a thousand years and/or their knowledge can be transferred to a new body unit if their body wears out. DID ANTHONY BARDEN REFER TO THEIR BODIES AS ANDROIDS? No. At that time, even when we went to Area 51 in August 1958, the being there in that office building was described as being ‘extraterrestrial.’ At that time with us, we also never heard the phrase, ‘extraterrestrial biological entity (EBE).’ That particular term was never brought out to us. It was the term ‘alien’ that was always used as the all-encompassing word to describe the beings. At that time, apparently, our government thought they were independent beings from somewhere else in the universe – not programmed androids working for someone else. Not Much Known About 6-Fingered Non-Humans? IF ANTHONY BARDEN HAD A BRIEFING IN WHICH IT WAS EXPLAINED THAT THE 3-FOOT-TALL GREYS HAD BEEN INVOLVED WITH TEACHING THE INCAS ABOUT THE SMELTING OF GOLD, WAS THERE ALSO A BRIEFING ABOUT THE 6-FINGERED HUMANOIDS? No. I had the impression that there was no detailed knowledge about the 6-fingered, 6-toed "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"entities, what they were up to or why they were here. All I ever heard was that the Greys were here to help and had helped different nations do different things over the centuries. I never heard anything about why the 6-fingered beings were different from the Greys and I never heard any information about where the 6-fingered aliens were from. WHAT ABOUT THE TALLER 5-FOOT-GREYS? I understood they were from the same solar system, but a different planet. But at that time in the late 1950s, only the planet Aldebaran was mentioned to me as a possible source. But I don’t know. THE ONLY STAR THAT ANTHONY BARDEN BROUGHT UP IN THE SOUTHEASTERN MILITARY BASE WAS ALDEBARAN? Ye s . NO OTHER? At that time, no other. When we were at Area 51 in August 1958, some other stars were mentioned, but I cannot remember what, except they were identified only by numbers, not names. Electromagnetic, Anti-gravity and Anti-matter Propulsion Systems IN WHAT ANTHONY BARDEN LEARNED AT LANGLEY CIA, IS THERE ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THE TYPES OF BEINGS AND CRAFT TECHNOLOGY THAT HE TALKED TO YOU ABOUT? Yes, he mentioned that the propulsion system was electromagnetic anti-gravitational. Also, they had some craft that operated on an anti-matter propulsion system, which was a different type of propulsion system. Also, they had found one ancient saucer craft that was atomic powered and was still highly radioactive. It had been put into a cave out west in the United States and when there was an earthquake somewhere, the side of a mountain tumbled down and exposed this radioactive craft sitting in a cave. It was atomic powered. Our government investigators had no idea about the age of it, but thought it was much older than anything else they had found. Extraterrestrial Uranium Mining in Europe? Anthony Barden told us that in Europe they had found a place where long ago someone had mined uranium, but the mining went back maybe 50,000 years or some really ancient time. In the uranium mine, there was no sign of picks and shovels because all the wall mines had been very precisely removed by some kind of cutting tool that removed the uranium. URANIUM MINES HAVE BEEN FOUND WHERE GOVERNMENTS CONCLUDED NON-HUMAN ALIENS HAD DONE THE WORK CENTURIES BEFORE? Yes, the region is triangular-shaped in Germany and France. I don’t know if it was the French or Germans mining uranium that discovered it, but they got into this one area where it had already been mined out. There were no tools or wood bracing in the tunnels and the precisely cut tunnels were very small. THE TUNNELS WERE CLEANLY CARVED OUT IN RECTANGLES? OR? Yes, and the discoverers followed where the uranium ore had been cut out and it was the highest quality uranium. The sub-quality mineral was just left. The modern human miners then mined what was left of the lower quality stuff. The discoverers said they thought the smooth, carved tunnels in the high quality uranium had been done thousands of years ago. ANTHONY BARDEN HAS A BRIEFING AND HE MUST HAVE SAID SOMETHING TO YOU ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE PAST ALIEN INTERACTION ON EARTH AND WHY THERE IS INTERACTION NOW? I believe he asked a similar question to his briefers at Langley and the answer was a run around that they didn’t know, but they thought the aliens had been here for many hundreds of thousands of years before. The difference between our modern times and"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"ancient times is now we have fast communication between towns and nations. Back when humans lived in small villages, the aliens could operate around the planet however they wanted because from one village to another, there was little communication about their activities. SO, WHY WOULD THE NON-HUMANS BE HERE NOW? Anthony Barden said his briefers stressed they did not know why. The answer they gave him was that the aliens said they had come before as helpers of humanity and that’s the only answer he got from anyone. DID ANYONE BRING UP GERMAN TECHNOLOGY? No, he never heard of any German WWII technology until I found the document in the CIA library. OK, THAT WAS IN JULY 1958 WHEN ANTHONY BARDEN HAD GONE TO THE CIA FOR A BRIEFING WITH SOME CIA COLLEAGUES ABOUT THE ALIENS. HE COMES BACK TO THE SOUTHEASTERN MILITARY BASE AND HAS A SESSION WITH YOU AND HOW MANY OF YOUR COLLEAGUES? There was just the two of us, Anthony Barden and me – we were the only two with TOP SECRET WHITE HOUSE clearances. The other men just had TOP SECRET and there were three of us. SO A TOTAL OF FIVE OF YOU ALTOGETHER AS AN INNER GROUP STUDYING THE HIGHLY CLASSIFIED CIA PROJECT BLUE BOOK FILES? Yes. We were in a larger group of 26 men, including Anthony Barden, ranging from Florida to other CIA units beyond our school and TOP SECRET Blue Book stuff. SO, FIVE OF YOU ARE IN A ROOM AND ANTHONY BARDEN BRIEFS YOU ABOUT WHAT HE LEARNS. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? He gives me and three others the message that we are going to Area 51 to see some of the craft there because we had to make a report on it when Anthony and I went to the White House. Anthony said that since we in the CIA unit were working on the international UFO situation and would be receiving more and more of the foreign photographs and other materials, the Langley CIA headquarters wanted to have some of us fly out to Area 51 to see some of the craft there hauled in from various places and in two weeks we would travel there (mid-August 1958). By then, I was teaching a Signal Corps training course for new instructors and refreshing others and had to finish my class work. Then we flew to Area 51 in mid-August 1958. Screening the 6-Fingered, 6-Toed Autopsy/Dissection Film, July 1958 SO WHAT HAPPENED FOR YOU TO SEE THE AUTOPSY/DISSECTION FILM OF THE 6-FINGERED, 6-TOED BEINGS? That dissection film was shown to us before Anthony Barden went to Langley. SO YOU HAD THE ITALIAN PHOTO AND MEXICAN PHOTOS. WHAT HAPPENED TO LEAD TO THE SCREENING OF THE 6-FINGERED FILM? Anthony Barden received a message that a package with a TOP SECRET classification had been delivered to him and it was a film of an alien autopsy. There really was no sound to it other than a narration introduction saying the autopsy was done shortly after the craft was recovered and some was done in a clinic in the town of Roswell and some of the film was done at the Army Air Base near Roswell. GO BACK TO THE DAY OF THE SCREENING AND TELL ME HOW IT WAS ORGANIZED. WAS ANTHONY BARDEN THERE TO TALK ABOUT IT? He only had a printed report that came with the film. He had no idea the film was coming until it was there. SO, YOUR BOSS IN CHARGE OF THE CIA PROJECT BLUE BOOK UNIT IN THE SOUTHEASTERN MILITARY BASE HAS YOU AND OTHERS GO TO A SCREENING OF A NON-HUMAN AUTOPSY IN WHAT KIND OF A ROOM?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"It was the top floor of a 2-story classroom type of building in the classified section of the base known as Cryptography 722, fenced in by huge fences that had barbed wire on the top. The place was manned with armed guards and gun turrets, and if anyone tried to climb over the fence, the guards would shoot them. We had some KGB agents that tried to break in and a number of them were shot trying to get in. ALL THAT FORCE PROTECTION WAS IN PLACE AT THE ARMY BASE FOR WHAT REASON? Because it was the CIA headquarters base for the southeastern United States. But other highly classified cryptography schools in the United States also had manned guards. And once we had the CIA Project Blue Book there, then we had something that was highly, highly classified beyond normal CIA activities that included information about CIA field agents – highly sensitive information. We didn’t want any Soviet spy to get any information about our CIA field agents. We had a number in Cuba, for example, and they would have been killed if Castro learned they were agents. WHAT TIME OF THE DAY IN JULY 1958 DID YOU GATHER IN THE CLASSIFIED BUILDING TO SCREEN THE NON-HUMAN DISSECTION FILM? It was about 10 AM and all the doors were locked in the building. YOU HAD NO IDEA WHAT YOU WERE ABOUT TO SCREEN? No, no idea. HOW DID PEOPLE GET INTO THE CLASSIFIED SECTION OF THE BUILDING? You had to go through the gate and the gate had M.P.s there. Also, we all had weapons that we carried and they checked our weapons permits we carried with our CIA identifications. But we did not have to check our weapons at the gate; security wanted to make certain each of us was authorized to carry the weapon we had. I had been issued a Luger pistol with a silencer for when I began teaching the Asiatic classes. We were armed because we were concerned that Communists in the group might try to kill us. IN 1958, WAS A METAL DETECTOR USED OR ANY ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGY FOR FINGERPRINTS? They had no electronic fingerprint scanning, but when we entered the building, they had our photograph with fingerprints there to compare. WHEN YOU GOT TO THE ROOM, WERE THERE GUARDS AT THAT DOOR? There was a guard outside the door and there were two guards at the gate when we first came in. Once we were in the building and on the second floor for the meeting, there was no more checking. And my boss, Anthony Barden, was downstairs on the first floor and told each of us to go up to the second floor. He knew each of us and he counted everyone going to the room for the screening. There were twenty-six of us, counting Anthony Barden. Once we got to the second floor room, all the window shades were drawn and a couple of big fans were going. We could not open any windows and there was no air conditioning, so it was about 110-degree F. temperature up there at the time! I remember sitting there with sweat running down my back. WHAT WERE THE SCREENING FACILITIES LIKE IN THAT ROOM? WHO HANDLED THE FILM? Anthony Barden handled the projector and we had a white screen that pulled down in front of the blackboard that was on the front wall of the room. It was a motion picture screen we would normally use to show films during our 722 Cryptography classes. Anthony already had the dissection film in the projector ready to go when we got into the classroom. Anthony Barden told us it was going to be a special film of aliens (non-humans) and it was the aliens that crashed in New Mexico who were dissected. He didn’t say specifically Roswell. Later on, he told me it was the Roswell, New Mexico, crash. He didn’t tell the whole group for some reason. HOW DID HE DEFINE THE ROSWELL CRASH TO YOU? After the autopsy, he asked me if I had read about the Roswell, New Mexico, UFO crash. I remembered it well because I listened to the radio and saw newspaper explanations about it being a weather balloon."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Anthony Barden said it was NOT a weather balloon. It was an alien crash in New Mexico. I asked him which crash because I had heard about other crashes. He said it was the Roswell crash. I asked him why he did not tell the whole group that the 6-fingered beings were from the Roswell, New Mexico, crash. Anthony Barden told me those were instructions in the report and correspondence that came in the TOP SECRET classified package that contained the film. He was to say only that the beings were picked up in New Mexico. On the film itself, when there was a narrator’s voice that gave a verbal lead into it, the narrator mentioned that the alien autopsy/dissection took place in the hangar at the Army Air Force hangar near Roswell and that some of the body dissections took place in a clinic that was in Roswell itself. THERE STILL WAS NO IDENTIFIER ON THE FILM ABOUT THE SPECIFIC LOCATION FROM WHERE THE BEINGS WERE RETRIEVED? No. There was nothing in the audio narration and nothing specific in the printed text of the narration we were given to read as well. The few photographs of the bodies in addition to the autopsy were photographed in a hangar at the Army Air Field near Roswell. DID ANTHONY BARDEN EVER HAVE SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHERE THE 6-FINGERED NON-HUMAN BODIES WERE RETRIEVED? Yes, from Roswell. BUT WAS IT THE CRAFT BETWEEN CORONA AND ROSWELL, THE TRINITY SITE AT WHITE SANDS, THE PLAINS OF SAN AGUSTIN, CAPITAN MOUNTAIN OR EAST OF ALAMOGORDO OR ANY OTHER PLACE? ROSWELL, AS AN ARMY AIR FORCE BASE, WOULD HAVE BEEN USED IN A GENERIC WAY FOR ANY CRASH IN THE REGION. DID HE KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THE BODIES HAD BEEN RETRIEVED? He said these were the ones from the early July 1947 from the first saucer craft. I asked him what type of craft and propulsion system it was. Anthony said he had no information at all and hoped that in two weeks when we went to Area 51 that someone would give us more details. Anthony Barden stood up in the front of the room and said we were going to see a film that had just been sent to us (CIA unit) received that morning and was the reason for that particular meeting. It was a film of aliens that were picked up after a crash in New Mexico and this is an autopsy film and this is our first view for any of us as far as a film of this type of alien. Anthony said it was very important and for us to get a good image in our minds of what this type of alien looked like so if we saw photographs come into our unit of aliens that looked like this, we would know about this particular type of alien. ANTHONY BARDEN SITS DOWN NEXT TO THE PROJECTOR AND BEGINS TO PROJECT THE FILM.
