Maccabee - Part 2 © 2000 by Linda Moulton Howe \" Objects that were flying and recorded on a theodolite camera at White Sands Missile Test Range in New Mexico were flying at 150,000 foot altitude and were about 30 feet in diameter. We had nothing that could approach that altitude then. Even the high altitude balloons only went up to 100,000 feet. And of course, the balloons did not move fast. The unidentified objects moved very fast. Here is a document which I guess you could say proves that UFOs are real.\" - Bruce S. Maccabee, Author, The UFO/FBI Connection © 2000 - Excerpt about unidentified flying objects from July 13, 1950 Memo from Mathematician Wilbur L. Mitchell, Data Reduction Unit,White Sands Missile Range, to Commanding Officer, Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory, Cambridge, Massachusetts. June 19, 2000 Sabillasville, Maryland - Part 2 of the interview with Bruce S. Maccabee, Ph. D., Research Physicist at the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) in Dahlgren, Virginia. On May 1, 2000, his book The UFO/FBI Connection was released detailing his research since 1976 into FBI documents and knowledge about the UFO mystery. Currently, Dr. Maccabee is st ill in high energy laser research and is trying to develop ways to protect sensitive devices such as eyeballs or sensitive viewing instruments from damage by high powered, very brief laser pulses. I asked him what provoked him to write his new book about the FBI's involvement wth UFO investigations. Interview: Bruce S. Maccabee, Ph.D., Research Physicist, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), Dahlgren, Virginia: \"It can be traced back to the McMinnville, Oregon Trent photographs. First of two disk photographs taken on May 11, 1950 at 7:30 PM by Paul Trent of McMinnville, Oregon. Physicist Bruce Maccabee, commercial photographers and the analyst for the Condon Committee at the University of Colorado, 1966-1968, studied the negatives and prints and concluded the photographs were genuine.

Howe Note: On May 11, 1950, Mr. and Mrs. Paul Trent saw a UFO silently approach their house around 7:30 PM. The couple said the aerial object was very bright, almost silvery. Mrs. Trent ran indoors to fetch a camera. Mr. Trent was able to take two photographs before the object moved away rapidly to the northwest. The photographs were studied by commercial photographers and by the Condon Committee at the University of Colorado. The consensus was that the Trent photographs were genuine. The Condon Committee came about when the U. S. Air Force paid physicist Edward Condon and his appointed project members to investigate and evaluate UFOs from October 1966-1968. Bruce Maccabee: \"We just celebrated the 50th Anniversary of those photos. I gave a lecture out at McMinnville, Oregon on May 11th at 7:30 PM, the time of those photos exactly, fifty years to the minute after they were taken, I was talking at a hotel in McMinnville, Oregon to maybe 100 people who wanted to find out what was going on about this sighting that had occurred so long ago. This was probably one of the most famous photo events in the history of Ufology. The Trents died a few years ago, by the way, but one of their sons and daughter was there. Well, what do the Trents have to do with my new book? Well, I was investigating the Trent case in 1975 to 1976 and talking to Evelyn Trent and she told me a few weeks after the photos had been taken, or publicized in a newspaper, that an FBI man came to their house, sort of ransacked it looking for something. She described very graphically how he came and went into their bedroom and took a drawer and dumped it out on the bed and another drawer and dumped that out on the bed. WITH HER WATCHING? Yes, with her watching. Then he wouldn't put anything back. You can well imagine that that offensive behavior stuck in her mind. She said it was an FBI man. There Really Was An \"X-Files\" in the FBI 1. 2. So in the fall of 1976, I wrote to the FBI under the Freedom of Information Act. The FOIA became law in 1975. In 1976, I wrote to the FBI and asked if they had any record on a Paul A. Trent of McMinnville, Oregon. And I put in as an afterthought, 'If you have anything else on UFOs, please let me know.' I did not expect to get anything. Why wouldn't I expect to get anything? There was the Ruppelt book about 3."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"unidentified flying objects. (The Report On Unidentified Flying Objects by USAF Capt. Edward J. Ruppelt, Former Head of the United States Air Force Project Blue Book investigation of flying saucers, an operation of the Air Technical Intelligence Center.) In the book, there is a statement that the FBI was never involved. So, I didn't expect to get anything. Six months or so later, May 1977 I think it was, I got a phone call from a very surprised FBI agent who told me he had no idea there was this stuff in the files, but there was over 1000 pages of material and he had read through it. It looked like it was mostly newspaper articles and letters to the FBI offering information, or asking for information, \"but there is some good stuff there and if you want, I will copy the good stuff and send it to you.\" So, he did and that began my long FBI saga, I guess, lasting over decades. Ultimately 1600 pages were released. You can get them at http://foia.fbi.gov. If you go to that part of the FBI web site, you'll find a number of released Freedom of Information Act documents. A lot of people have files there. And there's something else called 'Unusual.' You click on Unusual Phenomena, you'll get UFOs and a few other things. There are 1600 pages in pdf format (which needs the Acrobat Reader) on the FBI web page. The pages are all jumbled up, not in any order. I got the documents 20 some years ago. I wrote articles that appeared in all four of the major UFO journals: the NICAP Bulletin (National Investigations ommittee on Aerial Phenomena), the MUFON Journal (Mutual UFO Network), the International UFO Reporter (Center for UFO Studies) and the APRO Bulletin (Aerial Phenomena Research Organization). NICAP was just about dead by that time. NICAP, APRO, MUFON and CUFOS all took what I wrote and published stories on the FBI files. So, they've been around for some time. Then in the 1980s, we got the U. S. Air Force intelligence files for the first time. Project Blue Book had been released in 1975 as microfilm records that you could read at the National Archives. Or you could buy the microfilm. But they didn't include everything that the Air Force did. Air Force Intelligence documents were not made available until so-called Record Group 341 or something or other, released in 1985. And more record releases have occurred in the past ten years as well. So, all of this stuff goes into my book. But it can be traced originally to the Trents because of the FBI documents, but I hadn't thought about writing a book about it until 1995 in December when I saw an article in the Washington Post Sunday Magazine. They had a front page article about a tour that this reporter had taken of FBI Headquarters. And they were of course playing on the X-Files phenomenon. And the reporter said, 'Well, you went into the FBI and the tour guide was there and we asked him where they kept the Real X-files?' And he said, 'They are down this way, ha, ha.' So, it suddenly occurred to me that the guys at the FBI don't even know what they've got. And that provoked me to do the book. YOUR FOCUS AROUND THE FBI WHERE YOU STARTED WITH THOSE DOCUMENTS. BUT CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT YOU LEARNED ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FBI AND"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"OTHER AGENCIES? The FBI and the U. S. Air Force The FBI acted like a window on Air Force activities. The Air Force documents show some interesting things. I put a lot of Air Force document material into my book in order to build up the history. In order to understand what they told the FBI, you have to understand the context. What was going on? What was the Air Force itself doing and saying that would indicate why they would say some things to the FBI? The FBI was asked by the Air Force on the 10th of July 1947 to investigate sightings (of UFOs). This was two days after Roswell made the newspapers, three weeks after Kenneth Arnold's sighting, basically a little bit past the middle of the 1947 UFO flap. And the Air Force told the FBI that it was interested in trying to find out if there could be Soviet subversion involved. Soviet agents making up flying saucer stories to undermine the confidence of the American people and the ability of the Air Force to protect everybody. They didn't literally say this, but I'm paraphrasing between the lines. So, was there Soviet subversion going on? There is a document in the FBI file (shown below) in which an FBI agent summarizes his talk with Brigadier General George Schulgen who is the general in charge of requirements, the intelligence requirements branch. General Schulgen told the FBI that the Air Force wanted the FBI to investigate. The summarized conversation was floated up through the chain of command in the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover. His assistant, Clyde Tolsen recommended that they do it and Hoover's hand signature on the document says, 'I would do it, but first we must insist upon full access to disks recovered. For instance, in the La. case, the Army grabbed it and would not let us have it for cursory examination.' Here, La. stands for Louisiana where there had been a hoaxed object thrown in somebody's back yard and the FBI wanted to analyze it and see if there was any evidence of parts from another country or anything they could trace back to the actual person who built it to find out if he had been a Soviet agent. 4."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Internal FBI Memorandum about a conversation that an FBI agent had on July 9, 1947 (day after Roswell, NM flying saucer crash made newspaper headlines) with Brigadier General George F. Schulgen, Chief of the Requirements Intelligence Branch of the Army Air Corp's Intelligence, about 'FLYING DISKS' as indicated in the Subject category of the memo. At the bottom of the FBI memo, the first handwritten line says, \"I think we should do this,\" dated 7-15-47. That writer is Clyde Tolsen, personal assistant to FBI Director, J. Edgar Hoover. The second handwritten note signed simply \"H\" is Hoover's response: \"I would do it but before agreeing to it, we must insist upon full access to discs recovered. For instance, in the La. case, the Army grabbed it and would not let us have it for cursory examination.\" Memorandum provided by Dr. Maccabee from FBI files released under the Freedom of Information Act. But that established a link between the Air Force and the FBI. Now, it's well known that the FBI acted as a black hole for all sorts of information. And Air Force information was not treated any differently. The FBI did an investigation of witnesses for about two months and filed a number of documents under the classification: Security Matter - X. So, there really was an X File! And if Chris Carter had called his TV show The Y FILES, he would have been wrong.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Next: FBI and USAF Clash Over UFO Investigations in Part 3, continued on June 20, 2000.
