Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Newborn Heifer Mutilation in Anderson, California, on August 7, 2004 © 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe The Harry and Carole Hawes ranch in Anderson, California, had a cow mutilation in 1999; now a newborn female calf has been mutilated. Further south in Red Bluff, the Jean and Bill Barton ranch has experienced many cattle mutilations over the past decade. August 11, 2004 Anderson, California - Since the 1950s, unusual deaths that law enforcement and ranchers have called \"animal mutilations\" have been reported around the world. Both domestic animals and wild game have been affected, especially horses and cattle. Ranchers and law enforcement have long been puzzled because animals are found with the same pattern of hide and tissue removed - usually without blood - from the head, sexual organs, and rectum. There are no signs of struggle or tracks around the dead animals, not even the animal's own tracks. That peculiar fact provoked law enforcement to wonder if perpetrators came in and out of pastures using aerial craft. Many ranchers have also speculated that their mutilated animals have been cut with lasers because of the bloodless nature of the excisions. In fact, pathology exams over the years have confirmed in some mutilations that cuts were made with heat energy but not lasers as we know them because no carbon residue has ben found on the cuts. I have shown pathology evidence of that in my books, An Alien Harvest and Glimpses of Other Realities, Volume 1: Facts & Eyewitnesses. Biophysicist W. C. Levengood in Grass Lake, Michigan thinks a very complex set of energies are involved. He began studying soil and grass samples from mutilation sites to compare with soil and grass from crop formations. In both phenomena, he has found the same pattern of respiration changes in plant cell mitochondria, including grass collected near the rectal area of a California bull found dead and mutilated on the Jean and Bill Barton ranch in Red Bluff, California. Levengood called me in January 1997, to say that black particles found on the dead and mutilated bull were pure hemoglobin. Levengood said: \"To do this, you need to break down the cell membranes to the erythrocytes and leukocytes to remove the hemoglobin molecules. To do this, requires a laboratory procedure with very precise biochemical steps. It's totally incomprehensible how the hemoglobin could be removed in the middle of the night out in the middle of a pasture and separated from all the other cellular components and some of it sprayed on the dead animal.\" Since 1997, half a dozen other animal mutilation cases in Canada and the United States also have shown evidence of pure hemoglobin on the animals. This is strong evidence that whoever or Whatever kills and mutilates cattle, horses, goats, sheep, rabbits, cats, dogs and even wild animals such as deer and elk around the world is leaving a residue in some cases that requires advanced technology. I have talked to law enforcement, military and intelligence people on and off the record since 1979 when I first produced the television documentary, A Strange Harvest, about the animal mystery. Many of those investigators have confided that our government linked the phenomenon as far back as 1951, only 4 "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"years after the infamous Roswell UFO crash, to \"extraterrestrial biological entities\" intruding on our planet. And the animal mutilations continue to this day. On Saturday, August 7, around 1 p.m. PST, rancher Harry Hawes received a call about a dead and mutilated female calf only two or three days old. Harry is 72 and has been working his Anderson, California, ranch since he was discharged from the U. S. Army in 1957. Two years later he married his wife, Carole. When Harry saw the newborn with neat, bloodless excisions, he immediately thought of the mutilated cow he had found five years earlier. His veterinarian took photographs of that cow and told Harry then he had no explanation for how the animal's jaw flesh, eyeballs, udder, rectal and vaginal tissue had been so precisely and bloodlessly removed. Now his newborn heifer had suffered the same fate. Newborn female calf found dead and mutilated mid-day on Saturday, August 7, 2004, on the Harry and Carole Hawes ranch in Anderson, California.

Its eyeball was missing. The left side from the rib cage to the flank there was skin cut out and missing and all the internal organs from the lungs heart and all the way down to the anus were missing. The other ear on the underside was cut off about half way up, kind of a ragged cut that one was. The tail was cut off at the base of the spine. Above : Left ear cleanly removed close to scalp; right ear cut in half; left eyeball cleanly removed. No blood, no tracks, no signs of struggle. Below: Large, bloodless excision of hide, muscle and all internal organs. All photographs © 2004 by Carole Hawes."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WHAT ABOUT THE JAW, TEETH AND TONGUE AREA? There was a little ragged cut on the tongue. I noticed some flies had laid some eggs on the tip of the tongue and they were already hatching. So, that's why after we took photos we brought it up and put it in the cool room to stop that because I wanted to show it to my veterinary friend. He came over that evening and I showed it to him. WHAT DID HE SAY? I thought maybe he was going to open up the rib cage, but he said it was not necessary. He said no animal could get in there that far and clean out those organs up in the rib cage that way. The piece of hide where the abdomen was cut open usually when animals cut it open, there is a flap of skin. In other words, they tear it open. A lot of animals tear it off in the same place, but this was cut from the flank to the rib cage and that piece of skin was completely missing. It was an oval cut. They started at the top and cut all the way around up to the ribs and down as far as the belly button and back up to the flank. Made sort of a football-shaped cut. They cut all the way into the abdomen in one big cut, it looked like, because the hide, the skin and the flesh on that particular part was all gone. DID THE VETERINARIAN MAKE ANY COMMENT ABOUT WHETHER THE ORGANS THEMSELVES HAD BEEN REMOVED WITH SURGICAL CUTS? Not really. He just looked in there and said there is no animal that would do that. And they cut the tail off. RIGHT AT THE END OF THE TAILBONE? Right. DID IT LOOK GLASSY WHERE IT HAD BEEN CUT THROUGH THE TAILBONE? I didn't notice that so much. It was kind of dark (in color). It had been laying in the sun for about 5 or 6 hours. I don't know if you'd call it glassy or not, but there was no blood on the ground. Yellow arrow points at excision of tail in neat cut through tail bone from newborn heifer. DID HE MAKE ANY COMMENT ABOUT HOW THE TAIL COULD HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THE BASE OF THE SPINE? No, he didn't say anything. HOW DO YOU CUT THROUGH TAIL BONE? Very easily. You can cut it with any pocket knife or something like that. Cows have about"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"100 some odd vertebrae that you can easily cut through. If you hit the right one, it slides right through the bone. Veterinarians, Brand Inspectors and Law Enforcement \"Spooked\" by Animal Mutilations DID HE MAKE ANY PRIVATE SPECULATION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CALF? The vet? He's a friend of mine it spooks him out! IT DOES SPOOK HIM OUT? Sure. MANY VETERINARIANS HAVE TOLD ME OFF THE RECORD THAT THE ANIMAL MUTILATIONS THEY HAVE INVESTIGATED ARE THE STRANGEST AND MOST INEXPLICABLE THING THEY'VE EVER SEEN. I would imagine that's close to what these guys say. Everyone like brand inspectors and law enforcement who has seen one of these things get spooked like the other one I had about 5 or 6 years ago. The vet took the photos on that one. The thing that really is weird is that there isn't any blood on the ground like animals would do. Maybe it wasn't even killed right there. You don't know. here it is laying in the grass and there is no blood around it. That's the first thing that usually happens when an animal kills a cow. That's how we find out whether it died or if it was killed (by an attacking predator). If there is blood on the ground, it was killed (by a predator). If there is no blood around the animal, it just died a natural death. IF THAT CALF WAS TAKEN AWAY, WHO TOOK IT? HOW DID THEY TAKE IT? HOW DID THEY RETURN IT? AND WHY DID THEY RETURN IT? That's right. That is a big question. It's creepy sounding, but there's no use worrying about it. If Whoever did this are that advanced, you haven't got a chance anyway, so why worry about it? Two to three-day-old female calf found dead and mutilated August 7, 2004, on the Harry and Carole Hawes ranch in Anderson, California. Denial As A Coping Mechanism You can take brand inspectors and all those fellas and you can take them out and show them this thing. Or you can show some of your friends these pictures and they'll say, 'Oh, hell, that was done with animals.' I've been around animals all my life, especially predators, and never seen anything like the mutilations in my life before. But people will turn right around and argue predator. The thing is, they don't want to believe it's something else. There was one brand inspector who told me, 'Hell, it was coyotes. You know that!' I said, 'If that makes you feel secure.' That's what they do. They come up with an answer that is logical to them because nothing else is and that's what they glom onto and will tell everyone else that and it makes them feel better. They can walk around in the dark and they're OK. But if they had to come up with a spooky deal like you're talking about (extraterrestrial interference) it drives them up the wall!"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"RIGHT, SO IT'S DENIAL. Mutilated Bull's Horn Rammed Deeply Into The Ground Sure, it's a form of denial. There is no question about it. When you have an animal that falls on the ground and it's horn is rammed into the ground so hard it takes two deputies to pull it out something is wrong there. That wasn't a predator that caused that. That animal could not thrash that hard on hard ground. That was one of Jean Barton's animals, rancher in Red Bluff, California. See More Information below. Then inspectors still turn around and say, 'Well, it was predators.' BUT THAT MEANS FOR THE HORN TO HAVE BEEN EMBEDDED INTO THE GROUND, IT HAD TO HAVE BEEN DROPPED FROM ABOVE? Either dropped or somebody grabbed it by the hind legs and flipped it around so hard that it hit the ground like a crowbar or a pick. Things like that are highly unusual and there is no way in hell that you could possibly do that without dropping it. And yet other people will turn around and blank face tell you, 'It was predators,' you know? I think it is a form of denial. 1999 Mutilated Cow On Hawes Ranch There are several people who saw that other animal I had. The cow was the most dramatic. NIDS (National Institute for Discovery Science) said it was one of the best cases they had seen. It was not decomposed. On that cow, the eyeballs were gone and they cut the tongue off deep inside (the throat). They cut the lips off. The belly button was missing. The udder was completely removed. IT WAS A NEAT HIDE-DEEP EXCISION? Everything was really neat on that cow. Everything was cut very surgical and very precise. Then the anus it didn't take the reproductive organs but it took the anus out completely. Just cored it right out. NO BLOOD, NO TRACKS? Oh, no.\" Above: Mutilated cow discovered in 1999 on the Harry and Carole Hawes ranch in Anderson, California. Both eyeballs, jaw tissue and entire tongue removed precisely and without blood or signs of struggle. Below: Cow's entire udder removed as if with a \"cookie cutter\" removal only hide-deep, leaving the white tissue covering abdominal muscles.

Often the dark edges in mutilation excisions examined by hematologist and pathologist John Altshuler, M. D., and other veterinarian pathologists have shown evidence of high heat.
