July 4, 2009 Cannings Cross near Allington, Wiltshire County, England - The Cannings Cross wheat pattern near Allington, Wiltshire, England, has been evolving through great confusion. The farm owner originally took his tractor into the first part of the formation reported on June 27, 2009, and drove in big circles to cut down the interior "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"points of the pattern. Eva-Marie Brekkestø flew over the pattern after the farmer's destruction and took the first aerial photograph. A computer graphics artist north of Wiltshire known as Psycho Clown then volunteered to reconstruct what the formation looked like before the farmer's tractor destruction and produced a Photoshop reconstruction. Then on July 10, the formation evolved into a second part with more circles added to the outside points and the damaged interior points were reconstructed into fresh points. By the night of July 12 to 13, the angry farm owner apparently hired a man to walk the field with a gun and shoot any “croppies” that entered. Then yesterday afternoon, July 13, 2009, the Wiltshire Police arrested either the hired man or the farmer allegedly for firing a shot gun. The news was carried in the July 14, 2009, edition of the Gazette & Herald. T uesday, July 14, 2009, Gazette & Herald, Wiltshire, England. This morning, July 14, 2009, I also received the following communication from Psycho Clown and report it here for more clarity. As this story continues to unfold, Earthfiles will report follow ups on the police arrest and any more additions or changes to the Allington formation.

I have attached the original photo taken by Eva-Marie Brekkestø in it's unaltered state, this file is called “gfdre.jpg.” [ after the farmer drove around the circle cutting off the inner formation points.] P art 1 of Cannings Cross wheat formation near Allington, Wiltshire, England, first reported June 27, 2009. Then the farmer took his tractor and cut down the formation where the round rings of destruction are between outer points and inner points. Aerial image © 2009 by Eva-Marie Brekkestø.

The latest events are quite bizarre (the farmer was arrested yesterday for brandishing a gun at police and passers by. Hope this helps. Psycho Clown PS: I don't usually use my real name. It's for no other reason than usually I like to keep myself to myself, hope you understand. Thanks.
