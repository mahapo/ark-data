August 20, 2000 East Kennett, Wiltshire, England - This weekend I learned from crop circle researchers, Ed and Kris Sherwood of Millennium Research in Santa Monica, California, that when they were in Wiltshire this summer doing a meditation experiment, the couple had a close encounter with a helicopter and two unidentified aerial craft. The date was July 31st around 11:30 PM and the location was the East Kennett square inside a circle formation. Part of their meditation experiment was psychic photography, to photograph with a flash camera the air around them in an effort to capture images of luminosities and translucent spheres that increasing numbers of people have photographed the past several years. The exact source of the images is still a mystery. Their camera was flashing in the darkness when they first heard a loud helicopter approaching. Interview: Ed and Kris Sherwood, Millennium Research, Santa Monica, California: Ed: \"I became aware of the helicopter staying in one place and hovering at low altitude. Kris and I carried on flashing the camera taking pictures. Then suddenly, another object appeared very close to the helicopter a couple of fields away. This object had a very different light configuration than the helicopter. And it was completely silent. Instead of lights spaced apart that you would expect at night with a helicopter, the lights were close together and large and kind of a yellowish-white color. They were flashing, too, but in a sequence that was very different from the helicopter.

Drawing © 2000 by Ed Sherwood. This started basically at about 1,000 meters away from us, a couple of wheat fields away, and then very quickly began to move towards us. The object moved towards us from across the field and the helicopter came with it. Perhaps 250 feet beyond where we were, the object then turned to fly along and behind a hedge row we could clearly see and the helicopter then positioned itself between us and the UFO. The helicopter stayed between us and the object as if it were hedging the object in. All this happened very quickly. The helicopter at first seemed to be more preoccupied with the object and then came in our direction straight at us. Just before it crossed the hedgerow where the object was behind and slowly moving up the hill, it turned out all of its lights... THE HELICOPTER? The helicopter. So, in one moment, it had several flashing lights and was very loud. Then the next moment, it turned out all its lights just before it crossed the hedgerow and came into our field straight towards us. We suspect it had seen us. Kris: It was quite low over the crop, too. It was about eight to ten feet above the ground and in the field with us and we could see a sideways silhouette advancing towards us, coming very close and aggressively. I was quite alarmed. Ed had experienced this before, but this was my first experience and going from the dead of night in a very quiet crop circle during this meditation. Then before we knew it, we were being approached by this large, dark, unlighted helicopter that was even below the silhouette of the hilltops that are quite low and rolling and the helicopter was below the opposite hilltop from us. So, it was very low and very dangerous. Ed: Yeah, I would say it was even lower than ten feet. To me, it was only two or three feet above the crop. Once the helicopter crossed the hedgerow and shut off its lights, it came straight at us. And there was a moment when I said to Kris, 'Get down in the crop, in the tramline!' I was kind of hoping the helicopter had not seen us and was doing some kind of maneuver to continue to hedge the object in. But after a second or two, it was fairly obvious that it had spotted us and it was coming straight for us. I was about to stand up and flash a flash light at it to at least let it know that we were there and on a direct course to us. It would have hit us. Just at that moment, it veered off suddenly to then fly straight towards where the object was which was slowly going up the slope of the hill behind the hedgerow. Quite impressive to see it flying behind the hedge and making no noise. This was a large object. The helicopter itself was not a small helicopter. It was something the size of a Black Hawk or maybe a Puma. It was not a small one. And the object was at least the same size, if not larger. And to see the object moving"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"behind the hedgerow, which from our position was not more than 250 feet away, passing behind the trees, lit up very brightly, flashing, but making absolutely no noise. AT THIS POINT, IS THE HELICOPTER STILL WITHOUT ITS LIGHTS? It was until it reached the hedgerow, and then as it hopped over the hedge to rejoin the object staying between us and it, the lights all came back on again. But our experience is in two parts because right after this, the object flew below - this is the UFO - flew below the hill line and disappeared from view. It also was flying very low over the landscape with now the helicopter in tow. The helicopter was now a little way back because it had veered off to come towards us. Then the first bright object disappeared beyond the hedgerow. The next thing that happened was confusing and that's when I started to record with the video camera. Suddenly from the far left, at the top of the field, traveling down towards where the object had been flying and to where the helicopter was now proceeding - another luminous object appeared. It was a flashing object, large, very bright, yellowish-white color. At first I assumed it was another helicopter coming to intercept the very unusual, completely silent object we had just seen fly below the hill line along the hedge, but as seconds ticked on while we were taping this, we both realized that this was not just another helicopter coming or anything else we know. It was either the first object suddenly coming back, and if so, it had covered a great distance very quickly. Or, it was a second object, second UFO, which was also completely silent now traveling down the hedgerow in the opposite direction. On film, we have this possibly second UFO flying left to right behind the hedgerow, coming down crossing the path - actually closer to us this time than the helicopter, but crossing the helicopter path which itself very quickly disappeared behind the hedgerow and hill rise as if it were still following the first object. We could clearly hear the helicopter receding in the distance and I assumed it was hotly pursuing the first object as the sound got dimmer and dimmer. Kris: And we have that on tape. On tape, you can clearly hear the helicopter motor going from very close and loud and it recedes away gradually while this other object approaches closer and moves to the right and makes absolutely no sound whatsoever and not a helicopter or anything we knew what it was. Ed: The helicopter had veered off its course to fly towards us and then it had rejoined the object to follow it and the object had disappeared behind the hill line and then the helicopter did eventually and then gradually went off in the distance. So, to us it was very confusing that the helicopter should just leave and then another one appeared where the first one had disappeared. Kris: They looked identical, the light configuration on the objects in question were exactly the same and had the same flashing light sequence. Ed: We have this on film. You can see the hedgerow and the field we're in, and the object after the helicopter has disappeared behind the hill rise and you can hear it recede in the distance and eventually you can't hear it at all - what is left is this single, bright, flashing UFO traveling behind the hedgerow making no noise, gliding very cleanly at very low altitude. The way this finishes, this object returned to the spot where the experience began where the 1st object appeared with the helicopter. On the video film it blinks out. Then there are three quick bursts of a flashing light. And then it's gone. This object was in front of hills that weren't far away and there was nothing to block its view. So, either it turned off all its lights or vanished or"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"both. Sequence of events illustrated by Ed Sherwood for more clarity. Graphic © 2000 by Ed Sherwood. A) Large, low hovering, noisy, flashing military helicopter initially attracted our attention to an area several fields away. B) Moments later a second object came into view with a very different flashing light configuration making no noise. The lights were large, closely arranged, and a brilliant yellow/white color. The structure of the object could not be seen as it glided across the landscape at first coming towards us. C) Before the flashing 'UFO' reached the hedge separating the field that we were in from the one the object was in about 250 feet away, it veered off to our left and began to glide parallel to the hedge, slowly climbing the hill rise, below tree top level approximately 25 feet off the ground. D) The flashing helicopter continued to follow and 'flank' the UFO and then headed straight towards us, only six to ten feet above the ground. As it entered the corner of the field we were in, it abruptly turned off all of its navigation and cockpit lights. The helicopter was medium sized, its type perhaps a Puma or Black Hawk helicopter. E) Approximately fifty feet from us, the helicopter suddenly banked away and headed back towards the UFO with its lights still off. F) The UFO slowly and silently continued up the hill behind the hedgerow. G) The helicopter caught up with the UFO and 'hopped' over the hedge before a group of large trees. As it did this, it turned its flashing navigation lights back on again. H) Moments after the helicopter caught up with the object, the UFO disappeared below the hill rise behind the tall trees. At this point , Ed began videotaping the event with a Sony HI8 Handycam set to Night Vision mode. I) With the helicopter still in view, another (possibly the first?) flashing UFO appeared, traveling from left to right from the top of the field at speed towards the helicopter. Like the first object, it glided parallel to the hedgerow without making any noise. J) Behind the trees, the helicopter seemed to head away from us as if following"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the first object. K) At one point, the second UFO and helicopter appeared to cross paths, though in actuality the flashing helicopter was heading away from us (we suspect it followed the first object we saw) and the second UFO. Moments later, the helicopter disappeared behind the hill rise and could be clearly heard by us to recede into the distance. L) The second UFO continued to flash and glide parallel to the hedge until it 'blinked out' towards the bottom of the field.\" More Information: On Tuesday, August 22, 2000, Kris and Ed Sherwood sent a follow-up e-mail with a photograph attached, an image they captured on a digital camera in the East Kennett crop formation \"...only minutes before our experience with the unidentified aerial craft and helicopter. \"Shortly after arriving inside the crop circle formation, I sensed clairvoyantly what I have come to recognize as the psychokinetic 'presence' of the circle making intelligence above and at the edge of the 'square' inside the circle. Quickly taking several photographs towards this spot, Kris and I saw hundreds of bright luminosities of different sizes in the light of the camera flash.\" Digital camera with flash photograph taken at night on July 31, 2000 at East Kennett square inside a circle crop formation minutes before the unidentified yellow aerial object and helicopter approached. Digital photograph © 2000 by Ed and Kris Sherwood. The Sherwoods videotaped the helicopter and yellow object and learned that other people did, too. Frank Laumen, a researcher and photographer from Germany, was at the bridge in Allington and could see lights and a helicopter back toward East Kennett. He videotaped the interactions. Andy Buckely from Manchester, England was also on Martinsell Hill and videotaped helicopter and light activity about the same time. To communicate with Ed and Kris Sherwood: Millennium Research P. O.
