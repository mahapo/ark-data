The ship won’t work unless it knows you. If you walked up outside the ship and put your hands at the right place, if it does not know you, the ship is not going to open up.” - A rizona Abductee R eturn to: Part 1 June 15, 2008 Phoenix, Arizona - Interview Continued: “WHEN EXACTLY DID YOU FINALLY GET TO GO INTO THE CRAFT? This would be like the next summer in 1966. By then, I had been seeing Zo every two weeks or so. HOW? He would land and I would hear the beeping sound. WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF ZO’S EVERY TWO WEEKS TRIPS? Just to talk. That changed, though. After about six months, there were others that came with Zo. Before, I had always had a sense there were people inside the disc. When Zo did come out with others together, they looked like the same type of people, but they didn’t look like identical clones. Each was an individual in the way they spoke and what they did. About six months later in the wintertime, I met up with Zo. We didn’t have as many meetings in the winter as we did in the summer. I just remembered that when I was around that disk in the winter, I was not cold. It was when I left where the disc was that I got cold. In January 1967, he showed up in the winter and I went down to the woods. Zo had this other fellow with him. Zo introduced him as a star scientist, an astronomer. Zo told me scientist could answer my questions. So, we were talking and he was pointing out stars and telling me about different ones. I told him I had been reading books and wanted to learn a lot more. He said he would be back and Zo asked me if I were ready to go to school with them so I could learn what they knew. I asked, ‘Can we really do that?’ I was excited! Zo said, ‘Sure, I think that would be perfect.’ After that, every time they came back, there would be someone to teach me. There came a point in time around the spring of 1968 when they would teach me that I was allowed to go inside the disc. The way they would teach me is to sit me down and we would talk a few minutes. Then they would say telepathically, ‘Are you ready?’ I closed my eyes and the next thing I knew, there was a pressure in my head like if someone had their hands on the sides of your head and was pushing really hard? But there was no one physically doing that. Then the pressure would release and Zo and the others would be standing there looking at me and asking, ‘Are you all right?’ I’d say I was OK and then they would say, ‘Then let’s talk about ...’ and we would go into a subject and I would know the answers and could tell them! That’s how they validated that their teaching process from the pressure "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"worked (download into his brain). THE INTERPRETATION IS THAT WHEN YOU HAD THE PRESSURE ON THE SIDES OF YOUR HEAD, IT WAS A DOWNLOAD OF INFORMATION INTO YOUR HEAD. THEN THE DIALOGUE AFTERWARD WAS FOR ZO AND THE OTHERS TO ASSESS HOW MUCH HAD YOU RECEIVED AND WERE COMPREHENDING? Exactly. But quite rapidly there was a problem. After I went home from that encounter, I started having really bad headaches. My head hurt with spikes of pain and I could not make it stop. The pain would last for maybe an hour and then it was over. The next time they showed up, I told them that happened and they were all very concerned. Zo asked me how often it was happening and I told them it was happening every two or three days. Then they had me go to another part of the craft where I would sit down. I don’t remember exactly what happened, but they put me in a reclining kind of seat that seemed to fit me very well. My head went back into a bowl-shaped thing. Then I fell asleep. They were talking to each other telepathically. When I woke up again, I was still there with my head in the bowl. It did not seem like I was there very long. When I got back outside, it was still afternoon. This was a day time event, not at night. The sun was still up in late afternoon. They seemed to be pleased with what happened and Zo asked me, ‘How does your head feel now?’ I said, ‘Well, it doesn’t hurt.’ And Zo said, ‘We’ll see how that works.’ And I never had a headache again after that. What Zo told me later is that the right and left hemispheres of my brain - something about the way they communicate with each other was not as it should be and they had to link the right and left hemispheres in order for me to be able to use what they had given me. LIKE ROBERT MONROE’S HEMI-SYNC TECHNIQUE? Yes, very much like that. I’ve done that before and it works really great for me. Zo said it was necessary because I had been trained to separate the left and right hemispheres – and my hemispheres did not communicate at the same level. They were supposed to be balanced. In order for me to use Zo’s information and do so in a way that I could see and interpret and digest and then bring forward the information, my brain hemispheres had to be linked. That was the only way it would all work. So, what they had done is to link my left and right brain hemispheres. From that point on, when they put information in me, there wasn’t any more pressure or headaches and I ended up for awhile with a photographic memory. I had all this information. It was astonishing. I was very smart at one time. Interior of Craft - Hand-Imprinted Panels Used to Pilot Disc CAN YOU GIVE A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THE DISC INTERIOR LOOKS LIKE? It did not look like Star Trek. It was actually quite simple. The area where there were chairs, the chairs looked like they were metal, but they did not feel like metal. When I sat in one of the chairs, it seemed to conform to my body. The way the ship was piloted – the only thing that looks anything like it and I was astonished when I saw it – was a Disney movie about a little boy who gets inside a UFO and he puts his hand on this panel thing. The way the ship is piloted is that your hands go down on these two places. Your right hand is where all the control is. The left hand can do some other aspects of control, but most is your right hand. THE IMPRINTS IN THE CONSOLE LOOK LIKE RIGHT AND LEFT HANDS? Yeah, and it does not matter how big your hand is because the hand spaces changed and molded right to my hand."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"In other words, if you put your hands in there, your fingers go into kind of sockets, little indentations. You can move each finger independently or make a fist or undo the fist. The console imprints move with you very fluid-like, but that is what makes the disc go and you can’t make it go unless it knows you. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU? Zo told me that the ship was alive and it recognizes who is in there. The ship won’t work unless it knows you. If you walked up outside the ship and put your hands at the right place, if it does not know you, the ship is not going to open up. The ship knows what is going on – it’s keeping track of everything. DOES THAT IMPLY THAT THE CRAFT IS MADE OF NEURONS? I never got that far in what I knew about the craft from what they taught me. They did not teach me about how the craft lives or how it is made – just that the craft is alive and it knows me. DID ZO TRY TO TEACH YOU HOW TO FLY THAT CRAFT? No, but I knew how because after a certain point, I was able to pull things out of his mind just like he was able to put things in my mind. I had already learned how to merge with him and pull all his information into my mind. Zo was not upset with that at all. He thought that was great. BUT YOU NEVER DID TRY TO FLY THE CRAFT? No. LET’S GO BACK INSIDE THE CRAFT AND TRY TO GIVE COLORS, DIMENSIONS, WHAT KINDS OF SURFACES. WERE THERE EMBEDDED DRAWERS, CABINETS, SCREENS, LIGHTS? When you walk up to the craft, you don’t even have to put your hand flat. You just put the back of your hand and touch a specific area on the craft. YOU TOUCHED WITH THE BACK OF YOUR HAND, NOT WITH THE PAL M? Yes, you don’t have to touch it with your palm. Or you can touch it with your fingertips after turning your hand over. The craft knows me. When that happens, very quickly you see a door opens and there’s a little ramp you can use if you need to. The ramp will extend itself out depending on whether the craft is on the ground or above the ground. If the craft is above the ground, the ramp acts as an incline to go inside. I had to bend over because the edge of the entrance in the craft is about at my hairline. So, I bent over, walked inside and it’s open so I can enter. When you are inside the craft, the craft knows you are in there. If no one else is outside with you, the craft just closes right up behind you really fast. There is no sound. The door opening is there and then it’s not. You can’t see where the door was. It’s just one contiguous piece, but then the opening just shows up. When you get inside, it’s pretty obvious where the door was because you can turn around and look and there is a place there that you know that’s where you would go outside. You walk inside the area on this particular craft, which was circular, and probably 20 feet across. And inside, one part of it had a pretty high ceiling because I could not reach up and touch it. But going up there were some sort of supports, but not like grid work. It was more like beams that move out of the ceiling and into the walls. Then there was something at the very top that flattened off. It doesn’t come up like a dome on the top. It comes up and flattens off. Inside, there are a series of chairs to sit in. HOW MANY? ARE THEY IN A SINGLE ROW? There’s one when you walk in that is immediately to the left and that’s next to a work station of some sort. To the right of that – and we’re going around clockwise now from the entrance – to the right there is an area that had screens and there was like a table that was part of the wall, but somehow it would fold down or come up. I was never really clear on the details of that other work station. You did not see any beakers or cups with pencils in it – meaning, there was nothing loose and lying around. Everything was very tidy. You continue going around and there was a door that went somewhere else"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"and I think it went where you could lay down. Further to the right was another work station and then another one. So, there were three work stations and then a space. Back from that space – but not really in the center – more like the next ring back from the chairs at the work stations, there was a pilot’s chair where the person would sit who flew the craft. It was built up on a pedestal and he sat there. Skin of Craft Can Become Transparent That was where the person would be looking outside because they showed me how they turned the walls clear and it was incredible. Where there had been a window, that would disappear and become a solid wall. Then they could make the window reappear. They could do that to the floor. SO THE OPAQUENESS OF A SILVER DISC, FOR EXAMPLE, COULD BE MADE COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT TO THE ENVIRONMENT? Yes, it seemed to be. THAT’S WHAT TRAVIS WALTON DESCRIBED AS WELL. [ Apache- Sitgreaves National Forest near Heber, Arizona, November 5, 1975. See The Walton Experience © 1978 by Travis Walton. ] Then to the right of where the pilot would be looking forward – a wide view between two chairs – the person on the left chair would be looking off to the right and their view would start at about their shoulders and go around probably between noon and 4 pm on a clock. Then there was another work station and the door space again. That work station in the 4 o’clock position was smaller than the rest of them. DID YOU GET TO SEE ALL THE WORK STATIONS FILLED WITH BEINGS? No, there were only two or three people with Zo. 1969: Zo Takes William Into Space Around Earth DID YOU EVER SEE ZO IN THE POSITION OF THE CENTRAL PILOT POSITION? Yes, he sat there. There were two things that happened. One time when I was a little older, I was probably 16 in 1969, I told Zo I wanted to see what it was like to go somewhere in the disc craft. I had been seeing it for three years. I wanted to see what it was like to fly in it. So, he met me one afternoon way back in the Kentucky woods. It was not near the house. Zo told me where to go in the woods and I got there at the time he told me to be there, even though it was a long way. I remember it was a white, puffy cloud day in early summer. He met me outside. We walked into the craft after he had me open the thing up. I touched with my fingertips and the opening was there. We went inside and the opening closed right behind us. He asked me to have a seat, so I sat at the work station that would be to Zo’s left of the raised pilot's platform. Zo was very casual and put his hands in both of the hand imprints on the console. He moved his left hand and said, ‘Watch the floor.’ There was no sensation of any movement. I looked down and, My God! It was like you were watching something in an IMAX theater. I had the view to my left and through the floor and Zo was sitting right over the floor view. We’re just moving straight up! But I don’t know how to explain it because there was no feeling of movement. YOU WERE SEEING THE EARTH RECEDING BELOW THE TRANSPARENT FLOOR? Yeah, and quickly until we got to a point where we were way above the Earth – kind of like what you see in the NASA shots with the space shuttle. I could see this thin – I know now it was the Earth’s atmosphere - but I remember"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"seeing the thin, blue line and we went in a direction. Zo said we were going into darkness and we went into darkness on the dark side of the Earth. Then Zo said, ‘Here’s the moon.’ And we turned and there was the moon. Then Zo said, ‘Now, it’s time for dawn.’ Then I saw the sun starting to shine through the atmosphere and it was just absolutely astonishing. There aren’t any words. You could see the ocean. You could see the planet. You could see ice at the pole. And there were so many places I wanted to go! I wanted to go to South America and to see what it would be like to buzz the Eiffel Tower in Paris. But Zo said, ‘I have to get you back. We can’t do this for very long.’ WHY DO YOU THINK THERE IS ALWAYS A RUSH, A SHORTNESS OF TIME, WITH THE NON-HUMANS? For Zo, I think it was where I lived and my living situation. He knew I had only a certain amount of time to be away from home without getting into trouble. BUT COULD SHORT TIME RELATE TO WHERE HE IS FROM? DID YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT ZO BEING FROM ANOTHER SOLAR SYSTEM IN THIS GALAXY? OR WAS HE A TIME TRAVELER? I never had a sense that he was a time traveler, but he certainly seemed to know a lot about the future because of the things they were intent on showing me after this flight experience. First, they showed me the flight and then on the next visit, Zo came in a different ship. WHAT DID THAT NEXT CRAFT LOOK LIKE? Instead of a flying saucer, it looked more like a big, thick, flat, flying pancake. And thick at the center. WAS IT LIKE A COIN SEEN FROM THE SIDE? It was like that, maybe 12 feet tall. HOW DID YOU ENTER THE PANCAKE CRAFT? Same way. But after it landed, I was walking around looking at it thinking, ‘Oh, great, what if this is not Zo.’ I got worried that it might be somebody else inside who wouldn’t care about me. Zo told me there were visitors who were not friendly to humans on this world. So, I took off running and I heard in my mind, ‘Stop! This is Zo!’” C ontinued in: Part 4 More Information: For further information about the human abduction syndrome, please see my books and documentaries in the Earthfiles Shop and in the Earthfiles Archive: • 05/20/2008 — High Strangeness in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada • 04/29/2008 — Part 1: Insights from An Experiencer with Greys and Blond Humanoids • 04/06/2008 — Final Part 10: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 04/02/2008 — Part 9 - Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/30/2008 — Part 8 - Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/20/2008 — Part 7 - Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/15/2008 — Part 6 - Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/08/2008 — Part 5: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/04/2008 — Part 4: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/03/2008 — Updated Part 1: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/02/2008 — Part 2: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/02/2008 — Part 3: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 02/22/2008 — Updated: Three Eyewitnesses in Selden, Texas, Saw Two, Large Rectangles of “White Flames” in Sky • 02/14/2008 — Update: Mysterious Symbols Projected in Night Sky by Aerial Disc Near Stephenville, Texas, Local Airport • 02/08/2008 — Law Officers Describe Unidentified Shape-Shifting Aerial Craft in Stephenville, Texas, Region • 01/28/2008 — Updated 01-28-08: Viewer Letters About Aerial Craft and Military Flyovers Above Dublin, Stephenville and Selden, Texas • 01/18/2008 — Updated: Huge Aerial Craft Over Dublin, Texas, “Longer Than 3 Football Fields”"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"• 01/07/2008 — Part 15: In League With A UFO • 12/22/2007 — Part 10: In League With A UFO • 12/16/2007 — Part 8: In League With A UFO • 12/14/2007 — Part 7: In League With A UFO • 12/11/2007 — More Confirmation of May 1974 Discs in Albuquerque and Huge Cylinder Craft At White Sands Provi ng Ground. • 11/25/2007 — Part 4: In League With A UFO • 09/16/2007 — Part 5: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 09/11/2007 — Part 4: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 09/07/2007 — Part 3: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 09/05/2007 — Part 2: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 08/31/2007 — Part 1: Betty and Barney Hill: Captured! • 08/31/2007 — Part 2: Betty and Barney Hill: Captured! • 08/30/2007 — Part 1: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 07/31/2007 — Part 2, Non-Human Blonds, Greys and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Lizards • 06/26/2007 — Part 1: Explanation of the Recent \"Strange Craft\" Sightings • 05/11/2007 — CIA Origin of National Enquirer? • 03/16/2007 — Tenth Anniversary of March 1997 Phoenix Lights: What Was the 2-Mile-Long Triangular Craft? • 02/18/2007 — Part 4: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers and Listeners • 02/15/2007 — Grey Non-Human Floats in Air At New Orleans Defense Contractor Site • 02/14/2007 — Part 3: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers and Listeners • 02/12/2007 — Part 2: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers and Listeners • 02/11/2007 — Part 1: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers and Listeners • 01/26/2007 — Part 1: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans • 01/26/2007 — Part 2: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans • 01/26/2007 — Part 3: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans • 01/08/2007 — Updated: Attorney Describes His Encounter with Non-Human Entities • 12/14/2006 — Abductee Jim Sparks's Encounter with Reptillian Beings, Their Warning and Possible Agenda • 10/11/2006 — Part 2: Time Travel, Insights from USAF Sergeant and UFO Abductee • 10/08/2006 — Part 1: Time Travel, Insights from USAF Sergeant and UFO Abductee • 09/29/2006 — Manipulation of Time and Matter by Non-Humans: The Experiences of Jim Sparks • 09/05/2006 — Part 2: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet? • 09/04/2006 — Part 1: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet? • 07/28/2006 — 1940s USAF Flight Surgeon's Account of E.
