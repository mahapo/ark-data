Out of print.Return to Part 1December 22, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Chapter 7, The Second Encountercontinued.“‘Humans are not even in dominion of their own soul!’All the body containers on earth belong to the Aliens.The Aliens did not disclose to Bill who owns the souls -just that the Aliens had no claim to that part of humanity.” - AuthorBill Smith (not real name of committee member and human abductee)advanced to where he was allowed to roam freely aboard the craft. The craftmoved at speeds that are inconceivable if taken out of the realm of sciencefiction. The Aliens let Bill choose the destination and as quickly as it formedin his mind, the craft was half way there. He visited every country on earthand even spent time on the moon. The Aliens declined his request to visit theplanet Jupiter, a favorite of his, and told him that other parts of the solarsystem were still off limits to him. But the Aliens told him that possibly in thefuture, Bill would be able to visit some of them."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"While on the moon, he was not encumbered by a bulky space suit or anyspace suit, but was attended by a bubble of air that surrounded him whereverhe went. The bubble was invisible and emanated from a device the size of abutane lighter that he kept in one of his pockets.It frustrated Bill that the Aliens did not indulge others in the committee. Itmade it difficult for him to share his excitement with them since thecommittee remained suspicious of Bill and his tales of adventures, especiallyof those that took place on the moon.All the committee members did spend time with the Aliens, but the scientistswere not allowed to remember what took place. Bill told them that they weretreated no differently than the majority of those who are abducted, except thathe was able to verify that it did happen to them. His colleagues questioned Billabout why the scientists were taken, but not allowed to remember the incidentas Bill was able to. Bill could not give them answers. Bill could only relay tothe committee what happened to him with the Aliens - which implied onlywhat Bill was allowed to remember with the Aliens.The Aliens told Bill to discourage his colleagues from going to anyone forregression therapy. Ever since the time that Bill told his colleagues that theyhad been abducted, some of the scientists did not believe Bill and wereconsidering undergoing regression to confirm whether an abduction had takenplace.The Aliens pointed out to Bill that they can implant whatever memories theywant into the subconscious of humans and that many of the recalled episodesare intentionally painful and misleading. The human abductees areprogrammed that way to dissuade the abducted from learning the truth aboutwhat really happened to them. “A truth that is not for them to know and isnone of their business to know!”Bill was told that humans in the western world have the illusion that eachman, woman and child has “personal rights.” That belief is not prevalent inthe rest of the world.“Humans do not own their bodies. They are on loan to them. To ownsomething,” the Aliens told Bill, “ means you have control of it.” What humanhas control of his body? No human can keep his body from dying or frombecoming ill. The only thing that humans can do is feed and take care of theirbodies - not much more complicated than putting fuel in a car and changingthe oil once in awhile. “Humans are not even in dominion of their own soul!”All the body containers on earth belong to the Aliens. The Aliens did notdisclose to Bill who owns the souls - just that the Aliens had no claim to thatpart of humanity.On his last two encounters with the Aliens, they showed Bill how to performsome of the medical procedures that he and the committee had been strugglingwith. That new information helped to convince his colleagues that Bill waseither a genius - or did, in fact, have contact with the Aliens. Because of thecomplexity of what the Aliens demonstrated to him, Bill could only performthe procedures on board the Alien craft. The craft provided a level of puritythat did not exist anywhere outside of the craft. It was also less strenuous,similar to being on the moon with its reduced gravitational pull. Working whileon board the Alien craft allowed the Aliens to perform with ease and speedthat was impossible anywhere else. The purity of the air helped them to thinkmore clearly and the Aliens performed superhumanly while in the Alien ship.Bill showed his colleagues how to repair a severely damaged heart. Thecommittee operated on a woman who was badly injured in a one-car accident.She ran off the road after leaving a bar. Like the rest of the people that thecommittee acquires, the woman had no family and no friends that could beidentified. The hospital that she was taken to had given up on her andexpected her to die that same morning.When the committee received her, she was already declared brain dead by herphysician. Her body was still alive, but her heart and liver were damagedbeyond human ability to repair them. The committee was going to repair herheart and then repair her damaged liver. Bill and two others, who wereaccomplished surgeons, operated on her. Although they were good at whatthey did, their hands were guided by an invisible force far superior to them.During the open-heart surgery, Bill left the craft for only a moment to getmore sutures. The committee did not have a nurse, so they took turns fetching"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"things. Bill left at a point where she was in a stabilized condition. When hereturned six minutes later, he found the other two surgeons standing over thedead body. They both had a confused look on their faces. Outside the craft,the surgeons told Bill that everything that they were doing during theoperation seemed clear and made sense until Bill left the craft. The surgeonsthen reverted to knowing only what each had learned in medical school and intheir practices before coming into the committee's program. Gift of KnowledgeApparently the Aliens gave Bill a gift that he was not aware of. He had areservoir of knowledge installed into his subconscious mind. The informationonly came to him as he need it and shared with all those who need to knowthe information who are around him. It was obvious to Bill that he was beingprimed for something, but what?Much of what was stored in his head by the Aliens was not available toanyone but him. He was not aware of all his capabilities and only became sowhen he actually needed the information. He was the best doctor in the worldand getting better by the day. He was able to diagnose and repair afflictionsthat would baffle the best doctors. But Bill could not publish any of hisknowledge. The information came only when he needed it for a work inprogress and left as soon as the job was done. Bill tried many times to writedown some of the procedures soon after he performed them, but was unableto make any sense of what he had just done. So, Bill was unable to share hisknowledge with his colleagues, which only intensified the distrust thecommittee already felt between them and Bill. The committee saw that asproof that Bill was trying to isolate himself from them.Bill decided it was pointless for him to work with the others and he knew thefeeling was mutual. The committee were uncomfortable working around Bill.The scientists wanted to comprehend what they were doing and not merely beextra hands for Bill Smith. Mutually, the committee agreed that Bill wouldwork on his own projects.Bill was absent from the office most of the time. When he was there, hebreached the security system with his unusual mode of movement. Thesecurity system that monitored all who entered and left the premises showedthat Bill, who used to be the first to arrive at work and the last to leave, wasnot bypassing the security guards altogether. It was prohibited - not tomention impossible - for anyone to enter or leave the building without passingthrough security first. Yet Bill was observed working in his office many times,even when the security roster indicated that he was not in the building.Bill's supervisor approached him with that concern, assuring Bill that heunderstood how he was able to breach the security field, but that Bill shouldadhere to the same rules that everyone else in the department followed for thesake of morale. Although Bill was a much humbler person than he used to be,he felt that his special circumstances allowed him certain privileges. Heexplained to his superior that because of his new abilities, the Aliens expectedmore from Bill and required more of his time. Bill came and left by way of theAliens' supernatural means many times during the day and night and could notbe restricted. Bill was not beaming up and down from the Alien ship like theydo on Star Trek, but his mode of coming and going was not discernible.Bill's boss knew that no one could stop Bill from doing what he needed to door wanted to do. Bill was the only connection to the Aliens the committeehad, so the boss conceded to Bill's requirements. Bill had become thecommittee - no other member made any substantial contribution to theprogram. At the weekly meetings, the whole focus was on Bill, what he haddiscovered and most importantly, what Bill was willing to divulge to the restof the committee members.At one of the committee meetings, Bill suggested that the committee shouldnot add any more people to the program. “The number of people that wereinvolved with the Alien craft was already excessive,” he told the scientists.Since it was impossible to shift people into other less secretive programs, Billsuggested that the program be allowed to shrink through attrition. AlthoughBill was exempt from the high security measures, Bill was against lowering thesecurity and had some suggestions about how to make the committee moresecure without more burdens."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The Aliens gave Bill something that was similar to a computer chip to be usedfor the new security system. It was the size of a period at the end of asentence. The chip could be placed anywhere on the body. It monitored thelocation of the recipient twenty-four hours a day. When placed on the body,the chip embedded itself below the skin and remained visible as a freckle orsmall blemish. This eliminated the need to do a body search and allowed thecommittee members to come and go with considerably less restraint. TheAlien unit that monitored the chip was fashioned to look and perform as if itwere a man-made machine. The chip contained all applicable informationabout the individual and allowed that individual access only to his or herassigned place of duty.Surprisingly, there was no objection by committee members or from any ofthe people who worked there. Everyone was happy to do away with the oldand humiliating system. The scientists had become adapted to having theirevery move monitored, so inserting a tiny device under their skin was justanother part of the job.How much control Bill had over those who were on the base was not known,nor could anyone know. But when Bill suggested something, there were fewwho challenged him. Those who did always came around to Bill's point ofview before the committee meeting adjourned. It was obvious that Bill'sinsights were much keener than anyone there, which could explain why thescientists deferred to his ideas. His manner was so gentle that it was difficultto get mad at him. He never lost his temper and was always composed.Did he have the committee under a spell? Bill himself was under Alieninfluence. The person that was known as the original Bill Smith faded away.Something much more than Bill ever was or could have been on his own nowemerged. In every physical aspect, Bill was the same person. For those whodid not know him before his abductions, the slow transformation Bill wentthrough was hardly noticeable. He seemed normal, except for the fact that hisIQ was so high.
