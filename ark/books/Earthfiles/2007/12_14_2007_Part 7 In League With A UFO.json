Out of print.Return to Part 1December 14, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - *****Chapter 5Alien Cover-UpConcern over the increase of the media frenzy and the public's persistence toknow more about the “Alien cover-up” in the late 1970s forced thedepartment to clamp down and make it virtually impossible for leaks tohappen. Every document and report that was not essential to the committeewas ordered destroyed. A new procedure was adopted for the documents thatwere kept. The chronological order of everything that happened, every eventthat took place, was coded and the time sequence scrambled.The committee was not allowed to keep records and documents for more thana week. It did not matter what they were working on or whether they felt itsignificant enough to carry a particular project into the next week. At the end"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"of each week every note, folder and all documentation was removed from thepossession of the committee. The committee could request any information itrequired of past experiments and get access to them with no problem, but theycould not keep their own files.Security was made tighter due to the changing times, specifically because ofthe new legislation that went into effect in the decade of the 1970s. TheFreedom of Information Act, which was adopted in 1966 and was amended toallow more information to be accessed in 1974, primarily because of theNixon Watergate scandal.Those who worked on the committee or under its jurisdiction were notallowed to bring “anything” to work with them. Nor were they allowed toleave with “anything,” not even a pencil. Everything they needed wasprovided to them. Personnel who were “independent” of the committee werethe only ones allowed to remove and take office supplies and othermiscellaneous items to the committee and their staff. The committee was notallowed to shred or destroy anything. Their trash was taken and incinerated bythose same people. Everyone associated with the committee had to passthrough a screening room before they could enter their assigned work area.They had to leave clothing and all personal belongings, wallets, purses in thelocker rooms. They wore a special garb made of paper and it was collectedfrom them whenever they left the building and burned.Everyone who left the building had to go through a body check. Their bodieswere checked to make sure no one made notes or sketches on them. Ifsomeone was inclined to take information out of the facility, they needed tohave a photographic memory. But for the nature of what they were studying,it was highly improbable that even that would work. As one scientist told acolleague, “Easier it would be to emerge from a tornado with a handful ofsand than to grasp what was in our labs and still make any sense of it once weleft the building.”It was difficult enough to communicate with colleagues about Alien items, letalone someone who had no idea what they were dealing with.For those reasons, many of them questioned the need for the strong securitymeasures they had to endure. How could they possibly go out and prattleabout the things they had discovered when they themselves do not believewhat they have. When they go home after work, it is as if they come out of adream state. The scientists are forbidden to discuss their work with theirspouses and they don't. Not for fear they will be found out (they have nodoubt that they would be), but the fear that their loved ones would think theywere insane.Part of the contract they agreed to when they signed on for the job was thatthey would be kept under constant surveillance at work and at home. Thesurveillance technique was not unfamiliar to government personnel, especiallythose who were adept at working under high security clearances.One system used microwaves as a means of surveillance. The system workedby bouncing microwaves off a windowpane. The microwaves detected minutevibrations on the glass surface. Talking and noise will cause glass to vibrate.Most vibrations are so small, they cannot be detected by the naked eye. Itdoes not matter how many conversations are going on at the same time or ifthere is other background noise. A computer synthesizes the vibrations andrecreates any or all the conversations that take place. Conversations that takeplace in a crowded restaurant can be monitored using this system. Stored in acomputer's memory bank are the voice prints of those in the program. Withthat information, the surveillance team can zero in on a particular member andlisten in on his or her conversation. They also have plain clothes agents whokeep watch over the scientists.In the weekly pep classes given by the committee to department heads,security is the main topic. At one of the meetings, a security officer from theCIA informed them that before the dropping of the atom bomb on Japan, therewere less than a dozen individuals in the world who understood the principlesrequired to build that kind of device. To this day, few understand how nuclearparticles can be manipulated to make a powerful bomb. Yet, the knowledgewas leaked out and in a short span of time, many countries around the worldhad nuclear capability.That same CIA agent told the committee, “It is foolish to think that America is"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"the only country to have an Alien spacecraft in its possession.” With thatassumption in mind, it's plausible to believe that those countries who do haveAlien “knowledge,” regardless of the extent of that knowledge, would notlimit the resources expanded to acquire more of it.The fear that this information would fall into the hands of the general publicwas secondary. What the committee feared most was that a competingcountry would acquire that material. The general public was fedmisinformation since the time the committee came into possession of theAlien craft. This was done to confuse the public and at the same time to makeit more difficult for foreign agents to acquire reliable material. Much of themisinformation about UFOs was leaked out by an agency that worked closelywith the committee.There was a bit of ambiguity in this area. At times, it seemed that those whocontrolled the direction of the committee members had given them specificinstructions to withhold everything about the UFO phenomena from thepublic. They contradicted themselves when they gave orders to release certaininformation via the underground for the purpose of misinformation. Some ofthe information was truthful, but because of its bizarre nature, it was amongthe first to be denounced and rejected by the critics of the phenomena. Thecampaign to discredit the entire civilian UFO research groups is funded on asmall budget. The incredibility of “ Beings” from outer space alone allowedthe campaign to literally perpetuate itself and required little effort by thecommittee. Power of the IntangiblesThough there are thousands, and possibly millions, of people who believewithout doubting the existence of extraterrestrials, there are billions who don'tbelieve. Likewise, the vast majority of humanity does not believe in anything,especially if it can't be seen, tasted or touched. Tangible things are what life isall about to the vast majority of people. “Kooks who talk about Miracles, andthe nuts who see Little Green Men with big eyes, should be locked up.” Withprevailing public opinions such as these, the committee should not need totake many security measures.Security measures are primarily used to keep information from falling into thehands of agents from other governments - governments who not only believein the strange and unexplainable, but who spend large sums of moneygathering up as much of that “hokey-pokey” stuff as they can get their handson!Nations and people who are caught up in the “tangible” things of the world donot stand a chance against the unseen power of fate. In the Old Testament,God gave his people something that their enemies could neither see, hear nortouch, but whatever it was, it was real enough to conquer many of their farsuperior enemies. So powerful was that invisible weapon that thousands ofyears later, historians are still mystified by it. PoliticsDuring the seventies, the committee became more determined in their searchfor answers. Not necessarily because of any demands from their superiors, butfrom a general feeling they had among themselves that they were on the brinkof a major new discovery. There was no hard evidence for this. It was only afeeling they all shared. Still, the wolf was at their door. Vocal UFO groupspersuaded a few in the major media to put pressure on certain congressmen toshed some light on the UFO cover-up conspiracy.Although some politicians pounded their fists and vowed to get to the bottomof the conspiracy, they did it only for show and to placate that element oftheir constituency. Most politicians know there is a limit to their inquiries anddon't really expect to get factual answers on certain topics - UFOs being oneof those off limits subjects. But they did manage to get the U. S. Air Force torelease some files - albeit, insignificant dummy files that were createdspecifically for that dummy purpose.The politicians know, or should know, they are only getting “junk.” But, theydon't care because it makes them look like at least they are trying to get to the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"truth. All democracies have their limits and the United States - with the bestversion of democracy in the world - will never reach the point where thecommon people have access to all that goes on in government. Fulldemocracy could never work anyway. It would only invite the enemies ofdemocracy to take it apart, one freedom at a time.Nevertheless, there is always a Firebrand Freshman from the House ofRepresentatives or the Senate who will come along and try to kick the doordown. But within a week or two, like all the rest who came before them, theyemerge with the \"proverbial tail between their legs,\" no longer looking for afight and gladly taking the crumb that was thrown to them.\"There are things in the real world that the general population need not knowabout. UFOs is one of them.\" That is a quote from a memo that was sentanonymously to one senator who tried and failed to get information about theUFO cover-up.In solicitude, the committee felt as if they possessed secrets and knowledgethat they and humanity are not ready to accept. Many involved with theprogram, if they had to do it over again, would not. Unfortunately, leaving theprogram was impossible. The scientists knew too much. Ironically, if theywere allowed to leave with no consequences, most would not. Leaving wouldnot remove the knowledge of the Aliens from their minds. Living a normal lifewith the things they knew was not possible. Their only link to sanity was theirability to be around other people like themselves who were stuck in the samedilemma.Once a connection between the Aliens and human abductions was made, thecommittee was sure that it would be their \"Rosetta Stone\" (a stone inscribedwith one message, but written in three different languages) that would unlockthe secrets of human evolution. Although the scientists thought they wereclose to making that connection several times, the Aliens managed to eludethem. The committee had given up chasing after UFOs and were hoping thatthey, the Aliens, would somehow guide them to their next stage of discovery.The scientists knew the Aliens were watching them (again, it was just afeeling). There were suspicions in the committee ranks that someone in \"their\"midst conspired with the Aliens, or perhaps was an Alien himself in humanform.Ever since the chamber restored the damaged human body, the idea thatAliens could take human form was no longer Fantasy. It was possible that theAliens were steering the committee to that conclusion. The committeepondered about whether the body they had in the Alien craft could be used bythe Aliens as a vehicle. Perhaps it was a way for the Aliens to enter into ourworld unnoticed! The body was like a machine that was on idle. The enginewas running, but no one was at the controls. It sat there waiting for something,or someone, to activate its circuits and put it into gear.It is known that people under hypnotic suggestion will do things they have norecollection of doing once they come out of the hypnotic state, which provesthat it is possible to make the body “ perform,” even though it has noconsciousness. That opens the door to the use of ESP (extra sensoryperception) as a possible way of controlling someone. Could the Alienscontrol the body in that manner? Would the Aliens have to enter into thebody? Or could the Aliens do it remotely? Or maybe the scientists couldcontrol the body with the help of psychics? These were questions thecommittee bounced around. Their first approach to study that theory was tosee if the body would react to psychic thought waves. After several trials, oneof the psychics working with the body was able to get it to move some of itsfingers. Unfortunately, that wa the extent of the scientist's achievements. Thecommittee gave up on that project after six months.The experiment did produce some negative consequences for the scienceteam. A few weeks after they had stopped those experiments, two scientistswho were working near the body reported that it came to life. According tothe testimony of one of the scientists, “It got up and danced and in oneinstance, it turned around and looked right at me. Then it screamed a streamof profanity at me.” There was another incident where the body attacked oneof the technicians who had taken it out of the craft for a short time during adifferent experiment.Those who were personally affected by the antics of the “body” have refusedto enter the Alien craft. One skeptic on the committee attributed what"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"allegedly took place to fatigue by those who made those claims. He told themembers that the incidents could be explained by the fact that the craftaffects some people differently than it affects others. That did not explain theincident that supposedly took place outside the craft, but the committeemember reviewing the matter did not believe that incident took place either.Other committee members were not convinced. They questioned why thebody that had not moved for two years was now playing pranks on the twoscientists. One on the committee belied the claims and tied them to theexperiments that were performed by the psychics. He believed that theexperiments somehow opened up an opportunity for “poltergeist” to enter thevacated brain of the body.“If psychics are able to have some limited success in penetrating andactivating the brain, as wa shown by the moving fingers, then who is to say aghost or some other spirit could not enter the body?” he asked.The committee was divided between those who believed in the possibleexistence of ghosts and those who thought it was ludicrous. (It is bizarre thatanyone on the committee could be skeptical of the existence of “strangephenomena” after witnessing all that they had seen. Nonetheless, there werethose in the committee who were not convinced.)The scientists all agreed that more testing would be done before they madeany judgments. After a few weeks of observing the body in and out of theship, the committee concluded that the body did, in fact, come under ghostlyinfluences - but only when it was out of the incubator room.It was possible that the psychic research had little to do with triggering theghostly shenanigans, as was previously thought. The researchers were able tomove the body to any location by simply taking it by the hand and guiding itto the place they wanted it. When the body was left unattended for more thanten minutes at a time, it simply walked back to the incubator room by itself. Ifthe researcher was not through with the experiments, all he needed to do wastake the body by the hand and guide it back to where the experiment wastaking place. The body was completely obedient.It was believed by the committee that the eerie yellow glow in the incubatorroom had something to do with shielding the body from unwanted spirits.After the incident with the ghosts, the scientists decided to leave the body inthe incubator for several months. They thought if the poltergeists were indeedattracted by the psychic experiments “in the same way sharks are attracted toblood dropped into the ocean,” then removing the body from the area mightsolve the problem.It worked. There were no more strange behaviors from the body. Still, no onefelt at east working around it again. All who came in contact with the bodywere aware that it was a vehicle that did facilitate the entry into this world(from who knows where?) “Evil things.” The body up until then was nevernamed. It was always referred to as the “body.” But after those reports, it wascalled “Frankenstein.”Continued in Part 8 - Chapter 6: Biodegradable Alien ObjectsMore Information:For further reports about extraterrestrial biological entities and technologies, please seemy books, An Alien Harvest and the 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities in theEarthfiles Shop.
