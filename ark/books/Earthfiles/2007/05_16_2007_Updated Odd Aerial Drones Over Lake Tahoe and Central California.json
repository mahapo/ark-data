Over Lake Tahoe and Central California© 2007 by Linda Moulton Howe Left: Odd aerial \"drone\"? photographed in Lake Tahoe, California, on May 5, 2007.Right: Another odd aerial \"drone\"? photographed in Central California, on May 6, 2007.Both photographers request anonymity.[ Editor's Note: The words \"Chad\" and \"Drone\" at the beginning of my imagefile names are only an organizational effort for Earthfiles. I work on a MacG-5 and re-size images for Earthfiles formats. I downloaded the Chad imagesfrom the COAST website, which I understand were also re-sized there. So, theonly May 6, 2007, original images would be with Chad. Same applies to theMay 5, 2007, Lake Tahoe Submitter 7013; and May 16, 2007, Capitolarajman1977 images.Further, the two individuals quoted in 05/16/07Earthfiles EngineerComments provided me names and contact information and are notanonymous to me, but I protected their confidentiality.As a journalist, I would like to learn if our military has some kind of blackproject for ion electrostatic propulsion drones.]May 15, 2007 Lake Tahoe and Central California - Today I received the first photobelow by email from a source simply identified as \"Lake Tahoe-05-05-07 MUFONSubmitter 7013\" that was recently posted at UFO Casebook.com. Later, I was referencedto the second image and the wife's comments. Lake Tahoe, California, May 5, 2007by MUFON Submitter 7013\"My husband and I were in Lake Tahoe over the weekend. We left on Fridayafternoon and came back Monday morning. On Saturday at about 7 PM, I waswalking out to my car to get a sweater when I saw this thing in the sky. It waspretty close I think, but still above the trees. It was moving and spinningslowly, heading towards my right.\"I was startled and confused at first and wanted to take a picture, but ourcamera was still inside so I took two pictures with my camera phone before itpassed behind the roof of the house.\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"\"I ran around to the other side and was yelling to my husband to come out. Wecame around the other side and saw it just as it was going down behind sometrees. He didn't get a good look at it, but he saw enough to convince him that itwas something really strange.\"We decided to take a drive around the area to see if we could see it again, butwe never did. We didn't see it the next day either. Since we were renting thecabin for the weekend we didn't know any nearby residents but I would bet atleast a few other people saw it. It was very visible and very strange looking. Iwas definitely a little freaked out but my husband didn't seem very botheredby it. He was more interested in it than scared.\"He wanted to drive around a lot longer trying to find it than I did! It didn'tmake any noise except for a very, very faint sound that is hard to describe butsounded like something vibrating. We both heard the sound although justbarely. It moved in a very straight line when it went over the house but whenwe saw it on the other side of the house, when it was going down behind thetrees, it made a very sharp turn. It didn't move like a helicopter or airplane, itwas very \"exact\".\"We did see one person on our drive who was a few blocks away taking a walkand asked him if he saw it, and he said no. Then we asked him if he heard anyweird noise and tried to describe it as best we could, and he said he might havebut he wasn't sure. By this time it was at least 20 minutes since we first sawthe thing so who knows.MUFON Submitter 7013\"I realized the Lake Tahoe aerial craft is similar, but not identical, to another posted a weekago at the Coast to Coast AM website. Coast webmaster, Lex, and I have talked about theemail letter with attached images of a very odd aerial object from a Central Californiaresident who calls himself \"Chad.\" He says he took the images nine days ago on May 6,2007. That would be the next day after the Lake Tahoe photos was dated."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Chad is worried about his family's safety and health since he has now seen the bizarreaerial object at least eight times from his house windows and on hikes near his home.Neighbors, he said, have also seen the unidentified aerial object. Central California, May 6, 2007by \"Chad\"Chad wrote to me on May 10, that the \"drone craft\" is almost silent, but \"because of thestrange noises of the craft which crackles and hums very quietly, I worry that perhaps thereis radiation or something that is affecting us.\" Chad had concern in his first letter toCOAST because he had \"maybe 4 headaches in the last week, and I am normally not thekind of person who really ever gets them. Also, my wife has been tired and fatigued lately.She is about a month pregnant. ...Basically what I'm worried is that this 'craft' has got somekind of radiation or something. Like I said, it sounds like power lines if you get closeenough to it.'\"I shared Chad's images and observations about the low crackling, humming sound withsome people knowledgeable about military and civilian aviation technology and militaryand civilian \"drones\" - unmanned aerial devices that generally look like variations on smallhelicopters or airplanes. The first comments were about the asymmetry of the aerial object,which is not consistent with with the assumption that symmetry is necessary for balancedflight on air molecules."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"So far, an aerial drone specialist in California cannot find an exact match with any droneknown to be currently manufactured. But there are \"black\" projects which would be offlimits and thus, he would not be able to know everything that might exist or is in theresearch stages.But the sound described is consistent with electrostatic field discharges. Tesla coils, forexample, give off electrostatic charges that crackle and hum. Such fields are notradioactive. But positively charged ions in plasma fields are known to give peopleheadaches and nausea. One of the hypotheses in the crop circle mystery is that some cropformations have more positively charged ions than negative, which would explain whysome investigators become ill with bad headaches and nausea and dogs and other animalsstay away. Negatively charged ions are associated with thunderstorms, for example, whichenergize most people.Chad also had a very interesting comment about the aerial object's motion. Chad wrote, \"Itmoves almost like an insect. If you have ever seen a bug on a pond, it is kind of like that. Itis very smooth and slow most of the time, but then every now and then it will rotate veryquickly and go very fast into another direction, then stop, and repeat the process all overagain. There is just something very unnatural about the way it moves.\"I emailed Chad that the water insect analogy has been used by people I've interviewedabout UFO sightings - both smooth motion, followed by rapid, jerky motion in a differentdirection, and then smooth motion again. It would be very valuable to record the aerialobject's motion on videotape and Chad is going to try.
