Attorney is now 57-years-old.Image © 2007 by \"John Smith.\"January 5, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Recently in my Earthfiles mail, I receiveda 4-page, typed and well-written letter from a successful attorney living and working onthe West Coast. For more than three decades, this man - whom I will call John Smith tohonor his request for anonymity - has kept secret his interactions with a non-humanintelligence.First he trusted them, but now worries that the agenda of the particular type he hasencountered is to manipulate and suppress humans. Attorney Smith’s abductionexperiences have included being taken right through a wall, examinations by non-humansof his head and genitals and visions of an apocalyptic Earth future. Guiding AttorneySmith through his experiences was a telepathic voice that entered his life with winningraffle tickets and other inside information that convinced John Smith he was being givenspecial protection by extraterrestrial, or other-dimensional, intelligences. Attorney Smith isnow 57-years-old and says his first memories of high strangeness go back to odd, repeatingdreams he began having around age 25.Interview:“They (odd dreams) sort of centered around an awareness of entities around me and Iwould become literally paralyzed in my bed. I felt this extraordinary pressure that had asound associated with it that was really quite disturbing.COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHERE YOU FELT THE PRESSURE PHYSICALLY ANDPERHAPS TRY TO MIMIC THE SOUND?The sound would be a very powerful thrumming, as if we had very powerful soundamplifiers - not like a 60-cycle hum, but we’re getting close in saying that."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"DO YOU MEAN IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE (I make a pulsing hum)?Yes. Something like that, but increasing in intensity. And I was aware that these entitieswere having communication between themselves saying things like, ‘We’re not in yet. Iwonder if we can get in?’ That for some reason registered in my awareness. So those wouldhave been my first kinds of awareness I had.WHERE DID YOU FEEL THE PRESSURE?In my head.WAS IT AROUND YOUR ENTIRE HEAD? OR WAS IT A BAND? OR WHERE?I would say it was the back of my head toward the base of the skull and radiating out fromthere.WHAT WOULD BE THE EARLIEST AGE AND WHAT DO YOU REMEMBERCONSCIOUSLY HAPPENING?At that time, I think I’m in my late twenties. Out of that time period, that’s all I recall. Iremember that my wife at the time would b awakened by my noises afterwards and bequite startled. Apparently, she was out, too, until I came out of whatever.WOULD YOUR NOISES BE SCREAMS OR OTHER SOUNDS?Yes, she described my sounds as being terrified, muffled screams.DID YOU HAVE ANY RECALL CONSCIOUSLY OR RESIDUE IN DREAMSAFTERWARD ABOUT YOU AND NON-HUMAN ENTITIES?Not during that first episode. I certainly have more precise recall from later episodes. 1970s - Tall and Short Entities in BedroomLET’S JUMP TO WHAT YOU REMEMBER AS THE MOST VIVID IN WHICH YOUHAVE CONSCIOUS MEMORY AND WHAT AGE WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN?Now, we’re probably fast-forwarding another ten years and that took place after I movedfrom one house in the area to another. The house I moved to – it’s one of those thingswhere I looked at it and said, ‘Wow, this place is the house for me!’ for some reason. Itwas a very lively house. It had a lot of appeal to it. But little did I know that it, for somereason, seemed to be far more open and I’ve been questioning since whether certain areason the planet are just more portals to what I believe to be inter-dimensional activity. So, itwas more of an open area in hindsight. From the time I moved into that house, thevisitations became more frequent, far more intense, and I was far more prone to have somerecall on it.The typical thing that would happen is that it would be nighttime. There might be someevents preceding it like my animals getting a little out of control. I had some motion-sensitive security lights outside my house and they would flash on and off. I would go tothe windows and nothing was there. Finally, for some reason I’m asleep – or think I am –and then I would see clear alien presences – nothing I’ve ever seen on this Earth, believeme! When it happens to you, it is absolutely startling, terrifying, something you have tolive through to appreciate. But usually, there would be two different types of beings. Therewas a taller variety and then a shorter variety. Following my awareness of their presence, Iwould literally be pulled straight through my bedroom wall and directly up into aspacecraft.BEFORE WE GO INTO THE CRAFT, COULD YOU CONCENTRATE IN AS MUCHDETAIL AS YOU CAN REMEMBER IN TRYING TO PAINT WORD PICTURES FORLISTENERS OF THE TALLER ONE AND THE SHORTER ONE? COLOR?FEATURES? CLOTHES?I can’t identify who they were, but I will say that the taller ones were thinner. They tendedto be elongated, lighter in color. The shorter ones were darker in color and quite a bitshorter – maybe 3 feet tall. Something on that order. I don’t have a lot of recall aboutdetails other than the taller ones tended to be much lighter in color, almost a shinyappearance. The darker, shorter ones – hard to make out much detail.SOME PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE IMPRESSION OF METALLIC COATING IN SOMEENTITIES. CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHEN YOU SAY SHINY WHAT THE COLOR AND"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"TEXTURE WERE?I would have to say kind of a silvery sort of appearance.HOW TALL WERE THE TALLER ONES?They were 5 to 6 feet tall.DO YOU REMEMBER ANY KIND OF CLOTHING AT ALL?The shorter ones seemed to have some kind of clothing, but I would be speculating on itsnature except it seemed foreign to me.THE TALL ONES IN THEIR SILVERY SHININESS, DID YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OFCLOTHING OR COMPLETELY NUDE?I would tend to think the latter. It seemed to me it was either a one-piece arrangement ormaybe their natural state.HOW THIN IN COMPARISON TO A HUMAN BODY?Much thinner, quite thin. \"Pulled Directly Through the Wall\"CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE IN DETAIL AND CONTINUE ONINTO WHEREVER YOU END UP?What struck me is the suddenness of the event of being pulled directly through the wall. Itwas as if the wall did not exist. My bed was located directly below an exterior window andI would be pulled not through the window, but directly through the wall and immediatelyup into the spacecraft. I cannot tell you how far the spacecraft was above my home.Frankly, Linda, I can’t even tell you whether it was in the same dimension! It was almostto some degree like being pulled into another dimension. Extraterrestrials? Other-Dimensionals?CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THAT? THIS IS THE SECOND TIME YOU’VE SAIDTHESE MIGHT BE OTHER-DIMENSIONAL RATHER THAN EXTRATERRESTRIALBIOLOGICAL ENTITIES FROM INSIDE THIS GALAXY OR SOME OTHER PLACE?That’s just been my sense. I couldn’t defend it scientifically. I just have a subtle impressionthat they simply do one of two things:1) Either they are literally from another dimension;2) Or their mode of travel incorporates inter-dimensional aspects, much as sciencepostulates that we can go in a black hole and come out the other end somewhere.That might account for the fact that some thing winked in and out of existence from onepoint into another. So, whether they are entirely in another dimension, I can’t tell you. ButI certainly can say it’s been my direct experience that they are very, very capable ofmoving through space-time in ways we don’t understand and I would associate withhaving mastery of the ability to go from one form into another.But my impression at that moment was that the journey from my bedroom to thespacecraft was rather quick. There was not a lot of impression of floating for a long periodof time on my way up. It was WHOOMP! Gone!!The next thing I knew, I was on a very cold metallic table within an alien craft. I doubtvery much whether it was terrestrial origin at all and I was subjected to a number ofprocedures.WHY DO YOU SAY IT WAS NOT TERRESTRIAL AND VERY ALIEN – THIS CRAFT?Because the aliens were there. So, that’s tip off number one. Tip off number two is theequipment does NOT resemble any medical equipment that I’ve ever seen and some of mybest friends are doctors. It resembles absolutely nothing I’ve ever seen! Probe of Genitals and Neck"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CAN YOU GIVE A WORD PICTURE ABOUT WHAT YOU REMEMBER THE MOST?I remember being absolutely terrified and I remember being probed with long, thin probesand they seem to be interested in different areas of the body. There were a couple of areasthey seemed most interested in. First, they continually wanted to focus on the neck areaand also on the genitals. Occasionally, when I came back I would have physical markingsin those areas, which I took pictures of and tried to document as best I could. But those arethe two areas they really seemed to want to probe.WHAT WERE THE MARKS LEFT ON YOUR HEAD AND ON YOUR GENITALS?They would be like red pinhole-type markings. Other than that, there was no physicalinjury or trauma, although I do believe I was in the genital area, had an injury that hascaused me some difficulty over the years.WERE THE RED PINPOINTS IN ANY KIND OF PATTERN?Yeah. The pattern that I recall most commonly were two points separated by about half aninch to three-quarters of an inch.White arrow points at two round, reddish \"pinhole-type\" markingsbehind the attorney's left ear. Photograph by attorney's wife. \"Empty Bodies\" Hanging On HooksAttorney: \"The attached is from my perspective observing the interior of the craftfrom the table I am laying on. Contrary to what I've shown there was really a double row of bodies,one above the other, but you get the idea. One thing that stuck me was that I could not see the endof the row of bodies - they just continued beyond my range of vision. In other words,one heck of a huge inventory of human (body) material - for what?\" Image © 2007 by \"John Smith.\"WHO, OR WHAT, WAS AROUND YOU THAT YOU REMEMBER GIVING YOU THEEXAMINATIONS?Yeah, that’s another startling and terrifying aspect of this. There seemed to be others therein the spacecraft – and maybe the most appalling memory is of seeing row upon row ofpeople hanging, much like on meat hooks and appearing not to be conscious."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I’VE HEARD THAT DISCUSSION BEFORE FROM A WOMANIN MICHIGAN. WERE THESE PEOPLE HANGING BY SKIN OR BY THEIRCLOTHES? I thought it was by skin. I don’t know why I’m saying. I didn’t go and investigate. It didn’tlook like a comfortable position.DID THOSE HANGING BY SOMETHING THAT WAS HOLDING THEM UP ONSOME KIND OF HOOK OR INSTRUMENT, DID THEY ALL LOOK HUMAN? ORWAS THERE A MIXTURE OF HUMAN AND NON-HUMAN?Of what I saw, because they were not reactive – they were either in a coma or notresponsive for some reason or another – I don’t know that they were actually what wewould call human. To me, human means an embodied soul, a conscious soul. Theseseemed to be – and this is just a subtle perception I can’t shake – that they were justholding vessels. That they were just there. They did not – even though they appeared to behuman – there was something really off there.OTHERS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH ONE OR MOREINTELLIGENCES THAT HAVE A CLONING TECHNOLOGY THAT CREATESCONTAINERS THAT LOOK HUMAN, BUT ARE USED TO BE OCCUPIED BY THEINTELLIGENCES THAT MAKE THEM.That could certainly fit in here, consistent with what I saw. Non-Human CommunicationWHAT TYPES WERE IN THE CRAFT?I don’t recall seeing the little ones in the spacecraft. These were the taller ones who justseemed to be going about doing quite robotic moves. This was like their job as if they werethe Teamsters on the loading dock.Just going about their business. Very little conscious involvement at all. Very cold. Very,very cold, as if this was some sort of horrific play that they had done so many times, it wasjust routine.WAS THEIR WORK WITH YOU ONLY INVOLVED WITH YOUR HEAD AND YOURGENITALS?That’s all I recall.DO YOU REMEMBER ANY KIND OF TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION TO ANY OFYOU?Not at that time.LATER, WHAT HAPPENED?Later, I started to get the telepathic connection. I suppose in hindsight that came out of – Ithink they left implants of some type in my head area. That seemed to facilitate atelepathic connection.WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER ABOUT CONTENT?I can only describe it this way. I thought in hindsight I was absolutely seduced by theseentities. Not in a sexual sense. This was in the sense of utterly and completely beingsubjected to a program that stripped me of my free will and essentially turned me into arobotic controlled entity that would have done their bidding. Voice In HeadI need to back up here and give you a little bit more. I’m getting ahead of myself. Theystarted off by just having this voice appear in my head. I’m a competent professional. I’mnot used to hearing voices in my head. This was something new to me. But I rememberdistinctly the first time they would begin to feed me information. I was a member of ourlocal Rotary Club in the city I lived in at the time. The voice said, ‘Go buy a raffle ticket.Just buy one ticket. You only need one and you’ll win.’"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Sure enough I did and that caught my attention. I went, ‘Boy, how can this voice do thistype of thing?’ It would be a progression of those types of insertions into my reality wherethey began to almost as if reading into my thoughts as to my philosophy and my ownmotivations in life, which at that time and still are around a passionate desire to do goodfor our humanity and for the environment of our planet. I have taken a lot of myprofessional life in that direction.So, the thoughts they would put in my head were around: we can really help the planet bydoing x, y and z. We need to do this or that. When that would be completed, good thingsseemed to happen. So, I became more and more convinced that what I was dealing with, inspite of my recall of the rather unpleasant abduction experiences – I thought maybe I wasdealing with different ones. But, I began to trust this voice implicitly. Trust in Non-Humans Changed to MistrustIN THAT TRUST, WHAT DID YOU THINK YOU WERE TRUSTING?I honestly can’t say that I knew. All I know is that I felt that it was some – it was not myown mind. It was an alien intelligence – and not in the sense of knowing it was a grey orany other label for what kid of alien intelligence it was. It was merely alien to a humanintelligence and seemed to have spiritual wisdom about it, which in hindsight was theultimate seduction in believing that I was dealing with a benign and benevolent spiritualvoice.WHAT CONVINCED YOU OTHERWISE?What convinced me otherwise after many of these experiences and doing many errands onbehalf of whatever this entity was, I had occasion to want to get some help for my fatherwho was quite ill. I was interested in alternative energetic healing. I’ve always had thisinterest in energetic healing, hands on healing, that type of thing. I went to a number ofschools to learn techniques. It was a sideline and interest of mine. I got to know one ratherwell known healers. While he was still taking private clients, I called him and he agreed to.After doing a remote telephonic session during which he absolutely convinced me of hisprowess by describing exactly where I was living, all the surroundings of my house –extraordinarily accurately. Then he tuned into my father and told me straight out that hewas closed and there was nothing that could be done for him. He just was not open to it.The healer then suggested that we use the balance of the time I had paid for to work onmyself. Within the first minute or two, he asked, ‘What do you think about E. T.s?’After talking, I think he had his own suspicion validated and came out and said, ‘You haveimplants and you need to have them removed.’ I thought about that for a second because Ihave to tell you in all candor, I had a kind of ego attachment to being able to channel thisvoice. From time to time, I had dazzled my friends by being able to connect them to actualsightings of spacecraft and pulled through some amazing information in kind of channeledformat. So, I was a little reluctant to let go of that connection. Nevertheless, it felt like theright thing to do. Something I knew I had to do. So, I agreed to have the implants removed.So, this healer quite adeptly through a process that lasted ten or fifteen minutes pulled outthe inter-dimensional, energetic connections – however you want to visualize those. Theywere gone. It changed my world – absolutely put me on the floor. I don’t think I’mexaggerating when I say it made my world look completely different to me. It took meprobably three months to come back to a sense of normalcy. Free Will HijackedWHAT WAS THE BIGGEST CHANGE FOR YOU?I guess in a word, freedom. I guess this gets to the heart of what really gets to me nowabout that experience. They hijacked my free will and I don’t take kindly to that. I believein our country’s founding principals. I think they were brilliant at the time and they arebrilliant now.We’ve got individual liberty and to take that away from anyone is not a good thing to do.We value, as a nation, freedom and individual liberty. I'm a well-trained professional. Butthese entities took away my liberty and hijacked my free will through a process that I’mcalling a seduction. That’s not nice. So, it got back to regaining that sense of myself as anindividual."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THE QUID PRO QUO IN THE SEDUCTION WAS GIVING YOU INFORMATIONTHROUGH YOUR MIND THAT COULD WIN RAFFLE TICKETS, COULD PREDICTTHE FUTURE AND ALL OF THAT?Yes, it came with a number of psychic gifts. In hindsight, they really designed it to feed theego, which I suppose is the ultimate seductress. They really got me.THE LOSS OF FREEDOM IS THAT IF YOU ARE SEDUCED BY WHAT YOUCONSIDER TO BE HIGHER KNOWLEDGE, INSIDER KNOWLEDGE, THAT ONLYYOU HAVE, THEN YOU BEGIN GIVING OVER TO THAT VOICE. YOU STOPTHIKING FOR YOURSELF, CORRECT?Yes, and what is especially disturbing to me in hindsight is I would have done anything forthat voice. If they had said ‘Walk out in front of a truck,’ I don’t know that I would havethought twice about it.HOW DO YOU THINK THIS EXPERIENCE OF YOURS – BECOMING CONSCIOUSTO HAVING BEEN SEDUCED, HAVING LOST YOUR SENSE OF SELF AND FREEWILL – HOW DO YOU THINK THAT YOUR EXPERIENCE RELATES TO ALL OFTHE OTHER THOUSANDS OF ABDUCTIONS AROUND THE WORLD?The short answer is that I don’t know. But I have a strong suspicion that what I wentthrough was not an isolated event. Yes, there are many people who are also implanted andwho are controlled to varying degrees. That really causes me great concern.I don’t know why they (aliens) pick the people they do, but clearly many of the peoplethey pick are either in positions of power or influence – or have spiritual inclinations, agreat deal of subtle perception capability, deep sensitivity. Those that could be – I’m justgrasping for what might be going on. I truly don’t know. Alien Agenda to Suppress Humanity?But I suspect what we might be facing is an attempt by these entities to suppress humanityas a species and to keep us from our birthright, from our own spiritual and physicalevolution into the next stage of our development.I’m struck by some of the ancient Mesopotamian text where Enlil and Enki (in Sumeria)where there was an effort to genetically create useful beings. Then when the brother cameback and found that, he made every effort to suppress it. I think since that very ancienttime, we just have an extension of that battle between those reaching for the Garden ofEden and those who want us kicked out.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - EN.KI \"lord of the earth\" was a deity in Sumerianmythology, later known as EA in Babylonian mythology, originally chief Godof the city of Eridu. The name Enki is misleading because he was god of thewaters and not of earth. The exact meaning of his name is not sure: thecommon translation is \"Lord of the Earth.\" The Sumerian \"EN\" is translatedas a title equivalent to \"lord\"; it was originally a title given to the High Priest.\"KI\" means \"earth,\"or possibly \"mound.\" The name Ea is of Sumerian originand was written by means of two signs signifying \"house\" and \"water.\"Enki is also the master shaper of the world, God of wisdom and of all magic.He is the lord of the Apsu (Akkadian, Abzu in Sumerian, hence Greek andEnglish Abyss) , the fresh-water ocean of groundwater under the earth.His symbols included a goat and a fish, symbols at the opposite ends of theyear (Pisces and Capricorn) which later combined into a single beast, theCapricorn, which became one of the signs of the zodiac. Enki in Sumerianastronomy also represented the planet Mercury, known for its ability to shiftrapidly, and its proximity to the Sun, Sumerian Utu, Akkadian Shamash, theGod of Justice.Enki's symbol is the caduceus (2 serpents on a eagle winged stick) is one ofthe most ancient of symbols. The symbolism in the caduceus reflects theKabbalah Tree of Life.Enki proposes that the Gods make humankind as their servant, and givehumans the task of keeping creation going. It is agreed, and Enki formshumanity out of the red earth (Hebrew Adamah), mingled with the red bloodof the God Kingu, slain for his part in Tiamat's attack. Enlil fills his lungs withair (Hebrew ruach, Greek pneuma, Latin spiritus), and humans are alive. Inthis way, Humanity is given the task of maintaining the balance of nature andkeeping the created order in place.]"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"WHAT IS THE REASON TO SUPPRESS?You know, from some of my other contacts, I think they are scared of us and scared ofwhat we could do. I think somehow, we threaten someone’s power structure. That’s just anintuition. I really don’t know.THERE IS A GREAT IRONY IF IN FACT HOMO SAPIENS SAPIENS AS A SPECIESWAS SET IN MOTION BY THE ANNUNAKI AS DESCRIBED SUMERIAN TEXT.AND THEN TURNED AROUND AND WAS THREATENED BY THAT WHICH ITMADE?Yeah, that is ironic, isn’t it?WHAT DO THE SUPPRESSORS WANT?I can only speculate that it’s power. Power over what and for what purpose? I’d only bespeculating.YOU ARE THE ONE WHO HAD INTERACTIONS WITH THEM. WHAT DO YOUINTUITIVELY FEEL?I think it’s been a pretty good deal for the suppressors so far. I think they use us for ourgenetic material, I can say firsthand. But I think beyond that, there is a possibility that theysort of symbiotically – maybe that’s not the right word – if it’s as if they can use us toexperience our vast capacity for emotional and heartfelt experience that is more foreign tothem. They can experience that vicariously through us.DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW THEY DO THAT?No, I really don’t know the mechanisms other than what I directly experienced anddescribed to you.THE SEDUCTION. AND THEN USING THE HUMAN IN A WAY THAT BECOMESTHE ENTITY’S PUPPET OR PAWN OR WHICH THEY ARE OPERATINGTHROUGH?Yes. I was certainly aware that they were able to experience MY experience.Communication was obviously telepathic and I suspect almost holographic in the sensethat they could – much like we would turn a channel on the television – switch from oneimplanted human being to another and enjoy the show.ALMOST LIKE HUMANS WERE THEIR CDS?Yes. CD-ROMS, they are interactive. They can almost make it to order.OTHERS IN THE HUMAN ABDUCTION SYNDROME HAVE SUGGESTEDSOMETHING LIKE THIS – THAT THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SPECIESTHAT IS BEING USED. YOU COULD SAY AS RECORDING DEVICES, PLAYBACKDEVICES. IT MAKES THE INTELLIGENCE THAT IS TRYING TO USE US,MANIPULTE US, HARVEST US AND MAYBE CREATED US, THAT MUCH MOREHAUNTINGLY STRANGE TO ME AND I WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHOTHEY ARE, WHAT THEY ARE, WHAT THEY REALLY WANT AND WHERE THEYARE FROM?Me, too. Humans and Aliens In Collusion?I think there is a collusion between certain arms of our government and the alienintelligence that goes along with whatever their master plan is – there is some quid pro quohere that I don’t understand. But there is clearly some kind of marriage that has beenarranged here that both sides see some benefit in. But I don’t think it is good for humanityand I don’t like all of the silence and secrecy around it.I don’t like the fact that people who do things like I used to do often times disappear. AndI’m certainly not about to get into it again. I’m convinced that our own spiritual capacityneeds to evolve and win the day for the good guys.These people who are colluding, both within our government and from wherever the heckthey come from, don’t serve that interest. They are there to suppress us for reasons that Idon’t understand, but know enough to be offended by it."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" Apocalyptic Images of Earth's Future -Controlling Humans by Fear?HAVE YOU EVER BEEN SHOWN A SCREEN IN A CRAFT OR IN A DREAM, 3-DHOLOGRAPHIC IMAGES THAT WERE PROJECTED AS BEING THE FUTURE OFTHIS PLANET?Yeah – they used to play those for me. They tended to show sort of an apocalyptic versionof our future unless we change. Part of that seduced me into wanting to help them – or atleast the ones I was dealing with. There may be some that are truly benevolent dealingwith us as well as some that are not. The ones I was dealing with, I think in hindsight,clearly were not. But they did show me visions of the future and it was not going to be aneasy time.WHAT ARE SOME OF THE DETAILS THAT YOU REMEMBER?An environmental disaster of absolutely monumental proportions where the Earth becamecompletely out of balance and one apocalyptic vision after another.WHAT WERE IN THOSE APOCLYPTIC VISIONS?What’s coming up for me is one that has the Earth shrouded in this dense sort of smokeand it’s almost an unlivable sort of atmosphere that’s been left. Most of humanity hassuccumbed to whatever has been unleashed. I don’t get the sense that it’s World War IIIatomic kind of cataclysm as some might think. But something is altered fundamentally inour environmental balance that cascades out of control and creates something that is nolonger very user friendly for we carbon-based life forms.WAS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THE SUN’S INTERACTION WITH EARTH ANDTHE SOLAR SYSTE M?Not in those screenings, although I do think the Sun is absolutely crucial here – not onlythe connection with our sun, but the connection of our Sun with other suns as well. One ofthe visions I had was of something I call the ‘cosmic webbing’ where there is a webbing ofenergetic connection between our sun and all of the other suns in the Milky Way – and aparticular connection with the galactic center. And those energies modulate activity hereon Earth to a much greater degree than I think science presently recognizes. That’s just anintuition and vision I’ve had, not something the aliens showed me. What Is Point of Alien Deception?COULD YOU ADDRESS WHAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE A HUGE CONTRADICTION?I’VE ENCOUNTERED THIS IN SO MANY DISCUSSIONS WITH PEOPLE IN THEHUMAN ABDUCTION SYNDROME. VISIONS OF A FUTURE THAT ISAPOCALYPTIC IS SHOWN BY A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TYPES OFNON-HUMANS. IN SOME CASES, THE HUMANS ARE IMPASSIONED FOR THEREST OF THEIR LIFE TO TRY TO HELP THE EARTH, AS YOU WERE. BUT INYOUR CASE, YOU COME TO FEEL THAT THE INTELLIGENCE THAT WAS ONCESHOWING YOU IMAGES AND ONCE WAS GUIDING YOU IS SEDUCING YOU ANDTAKING OVER YOUR FREE WILL.YET, IF THE PLANET IS ON A COURSE OF DESTRUCTION BECAUSE OF WHATHUMANS DO, WHY WOULD THESE BEINGS NOT INTERFERE DIRECTLY?It’s a good question and one I’ve thought about as well. I really don’t know, obviously.There are forces at work here that are very much at war with each other, or at least that isthe theme that I kind of came away with. There are those who, yes, would and areintervening on behalf of our environment and on behalf of humanity. And those who areintervening on behalf of the suppressive forces, as I call them.THE SUPPRESSIVE FORCES WANT GENETIC HARVEST AND THE USE OF BODYCONTAINERS. WOULDN’T IT BE IN THEIR INTEREST IN GUIDING HUMANITYTO PROTECTING THE PLANET AND HUMANITY AND NOT ALLOWING IT TO BEDESTROYED?(long pause) I don’t know about that. Yes, if that were truly their motivation. But let’s saythat we’re coming into a time period where it is no longer possible for them to continue"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"their activities. Let’s just say that we are coming into a period of time – and maybe 2012means something and maybe it doesn’t – but lets’ say we’re coming into a time where it’sinevitable that mankind will come into its own. Where their (suppressive forces) actionswill no longer be successful – that we’ll see through them as our awareness grows. Theyare just playing out the game while they can – to get what they can while they can,knowing they are going to get kicked out of here. Or at least for many epochs while we areunder the influence of some of these subtle energies from this greater galactic center orwhatever, facilitate us using the other 90% of our brain we haven’t figured out yet and allof our collective psychic abilities – we really will re-create the Garden of Eden on thisplanet. They won’t be able to get through. They won’t be able to mess with us.WHAT YOU ARE IMPLYING IS THAT APOCALYPTIC VISIONS ON SCREENSINSIDE OF THE DISC TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE LIES AND DECEPTIONS?That was clearly my sense. It’s the psycho-spiritual rap that they have that was incrediblyseductive to me and to many others. But it’s just for the purposes of getting you to playalong through these earth changes and to prolong the time that they have power. Again,whether you are an anthropologist or political scientist, you’re going to say what is theprimary motivator once you get past survival? It’s the acquisition and use of power and thelingering question: why don’t I have more.
