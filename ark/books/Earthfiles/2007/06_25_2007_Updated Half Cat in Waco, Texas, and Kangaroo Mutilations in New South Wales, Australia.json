June 23, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Texas has had repeating cycles of cat andother animal mutilations for at least sixteen years. In Plano, Texas, an affluent suburbnorth of Dallas, in 1991 and 1993, police received dozens of reports about cats found cutin half, usually with the front half near the owner’s yard or sidewalk. Plano police also hadmissing reports on more than 80 domestic house cats that wore collars and identificationtags, but were never found. Police investigated satanic cult activities, but could not findany evidence that connected them to the mutilated and missing cats and other animalssuch as dogs.Between March and September 2001, twenty-three mutilated half cats had been reportedto the Austin, Texas, police and the Travis County Sheriff's Office.Between February and July 2005, 7 seven dead and bloodlessly cut up cats were found onDallas, Texas, lawns and reported to police.In the past eight months since November 2006, Corpus Christi has had reports of half adozen cats cut open, organs removed and sometimes the head and paws excised - allwithout blood. Similar waves of cat, and half cat, mutilations have been reportedthroughout the world since at least the 1970s. Waco, Texas"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Waco, Texas, has McGregor AFB and is near two other military installationsnot far to the southwest: Fort Hood Military Reservation and Gray AFB.Then on Thursday, June 21, 2007, I received email from an Earthfiles.com viewer aboutmore half cat mutilations in Texas – this time in Waco, which is located on I-35, halfwaybetween Dallas and Austin. This is what the email said:“A friend of mine found half of his neighbor’s cat on his front lawn. He tellsme that it was cut with surgical precision and must have been intentionallyplaced in the yard. Once he discovered the cat, he spoke with neighbors andfound that there have been other such mutilations in the neighborhood. Themutilations were discovered in the week of June 18th to 22nd. What I findtroubling is that I can’t figure out how the killers are doing this. I worked in avet clinic once and I know it is just about impossible to do anything with afrightened cat, much less mutilate one. I have the scars to prove it. Are theperpetrators killing the cats first? If so, how are they killing or trapping them?”The writer and I are in correspondence and I hope soon to interview the Waco residentwho discovered the half cat. Whatever I learn from that eyewitness and any otherveterinarian information, I will report in an Earthfiles update to this report. Australian Kangaroo MutilationsMelbourne, Australia - July to August 2005Forty-five minutes by car northeast of downtown Melbourne, Australia, is the YarrambatGolf Course. From July to August 2005, a dozen kangaroos were found dead anddecapitated without blood or signs of struggle on the neat, green grass. No one at the RoyalSociety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was contacted until Tuesday, August 9.What the RSPCA heard was so baffling, so unprecedented, that authorities are at a loss toexplain what happened. Groundkeepers in the early mornings of twelve different daysfound kangaroos dead with their heads cut off."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"South Durras, NSWSouth Durras is 10 miles (17 kilometers) north of Batemans Bay.This year, on June 13, 2007, police in New South Wales, Australia, began investigating themutilation deaths of three kangaroos in a national park at South Durras, south of Sydney.Durras North, Durras Lake and Durras South are 174 miles (280 kilometers) south ofSydney and 10 miles (17 kilometers) north of Batemans Bay. The region is very rural withlittle tourist development on the edges of Murramurrang National Park, famous for thelarge population of beach-loving kangaroos.Wildlife rangers said they were shocked at the gruesome deaths. Authorities said one ofthe kangaroos was decapitated – but did not specify if the beheading was without blood. Inthe cat mutilation syndrome over the decades, several have been found with the headsurgically removed, without blood. Another kangaroo had been beaten to death, the reportsaid, but gave no other details.A third kangaroo had its eyes “gouged out” – again without specific details concerningpossible clean, bloodless removal of the eyes as reported for nearly half a century in largeanimal mutilations. The kangaroo missing its eyes had a 5-month-old baby kangaroo stillalive in its pouch. The baby is now being cared for by a wildlife officer.The Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service in New South Wales toldreporters: “I have never come across anything as bad as this in my many years with thewildlife service. The staff and I are completely disgusted by what has occurred – the factthat the mutilation of these kangaroos has happened in a national park, land set asidespecifically to act as a haven for native animals, is beyond comprehension.”"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"To date, no one has been arrested or arraigned on charges of killing and mutilating thethree kangaroos.If viewers have more information about other unusual cat or animal mutilations, pleaseemail me at earthfiles@earthfiles.com.More Information:For further information about worldwide animal mutilations, please see reports below inthe Earthfiles Archive and my books, An Alien Harvest, the 2-volume Glimpses of OtherRealities, and my documentaries in the Earthfiles Shop.• 05/29/2007 — Final Part 7: Eyewitness Links Animal Mutilations to Non-Humans• 04/09/2007 — More Cat Mutilations - This Time in Corpus Christi, Texas• 01/02/2007 — Grey Aerial Disk Reported by Chicago O'Hare United Airlines Pilots and Mechanics• 12/07/2006 — Earth Headed for Warmest Period in 55 Million Years?• 10/02/2006 — Unusual Deaths of Six Female Goats in White Salmon, Washington• 08/23/2006 — More Cat and Dog Mutilations• 07/17/2006 — Area 29 - A Reverse Engineering Center of E.
