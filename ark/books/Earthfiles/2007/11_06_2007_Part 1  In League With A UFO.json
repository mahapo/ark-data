I talked with Lou Baldin about the content, which he confirmed is based onfirsthand factual knowledge, whose source he is still reluctant to reveal. I greatlyappreciate Lou Baldin's permission to electronically reprint for the Earthfiles audience InLeague With A UFO.PrologueMy curiosity about extraterrestrial life was kindled when my father told me astory that took place when he was young. It was a few years before the adventof the Second World War. He and his brother were walking home from schoolwhen they noticed something odd in the sky. He described what he saw as\"three large metallic circles.\" The circles remained in the sky in closeformation for a few minutes before dispersing in different directions and thenvanishing. There were no clouds in the sky nor any factories in the town topollute the air with smoke that could be mistaken for the three perfect circles.This took place in a small town in Italy in an era when the fantasies of spacetravel and the existence of \"Aliens\" was unheard of. They did not have atelephone or a radio. Television was not yet invented. His family was typicalfor that community. Few who lived there were aware of the happeningsoutside of their own town. The only books available to him were schoolbooks.One was about arithmetic and the other book was about reading and writing.He never equated what he saw as being UFOs and scoffed when I suggestedthat they were. Even though the disks he described to me were, in fact,\"Unidentified Flying Objects,\" he and others in the town had no clue to whatthey were. Like many skeptics of the phenomena, he was unwilling toconcede to the possibility of life from another planet and dismissed the threecircles as an oddity of nature.* * * * *Chapter 1Enchanted MansionMy name is Jeff Matisse, not my real name for reasons that will be obviousonce I tell my story.After moving to a city in the Midwest from New York City, my wife Ann andI bought a house there. The house was a modest three-bedroom split-level andwas ten years old. It was situated in a beautiful, well-kept neighborhood withmature trees lining most of the streets. Our house was in the newer section ofthe subdivision, so the trees on our street were not as large or majestic as inthe older part of the neighborhood. Still, the tranquility of that neighborhoodwas pleasant and we didn't seem to be in as big a hurry as we were when welived in New York City.We had sold most of our furniture before moving from New York. Annwanted to fill our new house with antique furniture, furniture that was madefrom solid wood, preferably cherry or walnut. We had been to a few auctionsin New York and became hooked when we stumbled onto an old desk loadedwith nooks and crannies. The desk was solid oak. But at the auction, it wasstill covered with five coats of a rusty-colored paint. We could not believe it,but there was only one other fellow who bid against us. We quit bidding atfifty dollars. We bought that desk for fifty-one dollars!When we got home, Ann could not wait to strip the old paint off to reveal thetrue treasure that we had found. It was in mint condition. We didn't know theage of that desk, but an antique dealer that we showed it to gave an estimateof 100 years or more.Two weeks after Ann refinished that desk, one of our friends in New Yorkoffered us two thousand dollars for it. We took it without giving it muchthought. But to this day, we have not found any deals that paid off as quicklyor as much as that one desk. The thrill from that one experience kept us goingto auctions from then on. As a result, most of our house is filled with old relicsand antiques from the past.Unfortunately, one of those relics turned out to be a link to the paranormal.We had acquired it at an auction that neither of us wanted to go to. It wasraining that day and Ann wanted to go see a movie. As we drove into the city,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"we passed through an old, upper-bracket neighborhood that was littered withmansions. Many looked like they belonged in a fairy tale. Some were from the18th Century, but most were built in the early 1900s. We could have gotten tothe theater quicker if we had stayed on the freeway, but it was a treat for us todrive through this neighborhood and dream what it would be like to actuallylive on that street. As we drove down one street after another. We spotted asign advertising an auction. The sign was in the yard of a house that both Annand I were particularly fond of. If it weren't for that one reason, we wouldhave driven on to our intended destination, the movie theater.We were more interested in seeing the inside of that house than staying for theauction, though that changed once we got inside. The auction had been inprogress for three hours when we got there. Still, the house was so big(twenty-some bedrooms) that the auctioneer had barely sold a fraction of thecontents. Because of the rain, the turnout was less than the auctioneer hadexpected.Still, from what I could tell, there were more than a hundred people present.This house was a treasure trove. Most of the furniture looked like it came outof the palaces of European royalty. Hand-embroidered material drapedaround meticulously carved cherry hardwood, detailed with flying cherubs.Because of our modest income, Ann and I could only watch, albeit with a bitof envy as those and many other pieces escalated rapidly into thousands ofdollars once the bidding started.We knew it was pointless to stay, so we left. As we made our exit, a womanwho worked for the auction company handed us a flyer. In it was listed all ofthe items that were to be auctioned off that Saturday. She then told us that theauction would be continued the next day because of the size of that particularestate. We thanked her and took the list home with us.That Sunday, I got up early. I didn't sleep well the night before and decided toget an early start reading the paper. Ann was still in bed and the sun hadbarely peeked over the horizon when I poured my first cup of coffee. By thetime Ann got up, two hours had passed and I was through reading the paper.As she fixed herself a cup of coffee, I looked for something else to read.That's when I remembered the handout from the auction. At the bottom of thehandout was written that on the last day of the auction, the remainder of theitems, mostly odds and ends, would be sold in lots. I mentioned that fact toAnn, but she was uninterested She mostly was looking to find unique pieces offurniture and since all of it was out of our price range, she was not thrilledabout going back. She decided that she needed to do some shopping at themall. So I went back to the auction by myself. I'm glad I went alone. That wayI did not have to show Ann what I found in the four boxes I brought homethat day.Normally I would not buy boxes of old papers and documents, but I wasdetermined to buy something that was part of that old mansion. Everythingthat I bid on that Sunday was never high enough. I lost all the bids except forthe lot that consisted of a few boxes of old books, papers and an assortment ofmagazines and documents. I rationalized my purchase by convincing myselfthat even though these boxes looked to be full of nothing but junk, maybethere was some value because they came from that magnificent house. Whocould know what secrets might lurk there?After unloading the boxes into the garage, I didn't feel like looking throughthem. I was exhausted from the auction and was looking forward to relaxingin front of the television. Ann was not home yet and I didn't expect her foranother two or three hours.After fixing myself a sandwich, I plopped down in front of the television setand made myself comfortable. I began to feel like a fool. How would I explainto Ann that I paid money, about one hundred dollars to be exact, for all thatgarbage I stacked in the garage? I lost my appetite about then. So I put mysandwich down and went into the garage to decide just what I was going to dowith all that stuff. Since I couldn't easily hide all the boxes, I knew I needed togo through them and throw away whatever I could.As I sifted through the boxes, I thought my fears were realized. I foundnothing of value in them. There were old magazines at the top of the boxesand under them were some technical journals of sorts. Nothing I foundinterested me. But when I got to the bottom of one of the boxes, I found"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"documents stamped \"TOP SECRET.\" And under that heading was typed inbold letters, \"To be destroyed.\" Every box had several folders with the samemarkings on them. All the documents were hidden under frivolous magazinesand irrelevant technical reports. I filled up three trash bags with the magazinesand the bogus technical reports, as well as the boxes that I cut up so that Icould dispose of them easily. The top-secret documents I was able to fit intoone of the boxes. I put the box in my office where I knew Ann would not findit. I had stacks of other boxes there and that particular box blended right in.My intentions were not to keep secrets from Ann. At first, I did it because Iwas embarrassed with what I had bought. But later as I read and discoveredthe bizarre nature of what the documents revealed, I was afraid to tell her oranyone about them until now. Here is what I found at the bottom of thoseboxes.*****Chapter 2UFO CrashThe year was 1947. The place was Roswell, New Mexico. On July 2 of thatyear, townspeople reported seeing a bright disk stream across the sky. Theunidentified flying object (UFO) fell from the sky and crashed approximatelyseventy-five miles northwest of town that day. A rancher who heard the crashthought that an airplane had fallen into his field and investigated. What hefound at the scene was nothing he could relate to and certainly did not looklike it was from this world! He told some friends that the craft was made of astrange material that looked like aluminum foil, but was unbreakable. He wasunable to elaborate further and then outright refused to discuss what he hadfound with anyone after showing an officer in the Air Force what was in hisfield. At first, when news got out that there had been a UFO crash in afarmer's field, the excitement spread quickly through the town, and then theworld.Ironically, most of what was known about the UFO crash was released to thenews media by a public relations officer from the Air Force. H told the pressthat a flying disk had crashed and that the Air Force had recovered it. Fromthat statement, news media from around the country converged on thatonce-obscure small community. Some of the townspeople wondered ifmankind finally had proof that other life forms did exist and what a scarythought that was! Orson Welle's 1938 broadcast of H. G. Wells' War of t h eWo r l d s was still fresh in the minds of many of the town folks, as well as therest of America.[ Editor's Note: George Orson Welles first gained wide notorietyfor his October 30, 1938, fictional radio broadcast as if it were anon-fiction live news report of H. G. Wells' The War of theWo r l d s about Martian creatures invading Earth. That theatricalradio broadcast caused a large number of listeners to panic andhas been used to explain why the government has a policy ofdenial about the non-human presence on Earth to prevent panicand maintain national security.]Not knowing what they had in their possession and at the same time trying tohalt what was quickly turning into a media frenzy, the Air Force quicklyretracted its earlier statement about a flying disk. Their new report simplystated that a new kind of weather balloon that was being tested in the nearbymilitary base is all that was recovered from the now \"famous\" crash. Thecrash of a weather balloon was much easier to swallow than an Alien ship, notto mention a lot less scary. Few people doubted the Air Force's explanationsand the public quickly forgot the whole matter.The Air Force was unable to give the President of the United States anydetails of what they had in their possession other than it did appear to be fromouter space. That was all the President needed to hear to make the decision tokeep the whole affair a secret until further notice.A secret committee was formed with the sole intention of studying the Aliencraft. It was put under the jurisdiction of the Air Force and received itsfunding from them. The committee operated under the guise of \"developingand testing new kinds of aircraft.\" The facility is located in Nevada and isknown as \"Area 51.\" It was one of the most secret bases in the country until"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"sometime in the 1970s to 1980s when UFO buffs started mentioning it in theirmeetings and writers started writing about it. The information came from amultitude of sources - from the average citizen who reported to the media thatthey had seen aircraft perform fantastic feats of maneuverability toprofessionals who claimed what they saw defied all concepts of what militaryaircraft or any aircraft can do. Moving diagonally while traveling at a high rateof speed was one of the more bizarre instances reported. Other sources orleaks came from former Air Force personnel who worked at the base andspoke under the condition of anonymity. Area 51 remains a TOP SECRETfacility, but its whereabouts are no longer a secret.The Air Force had in its possession a flying machine so advanced that some ofthe scientists who were assigned to investigate it theorized that it could onlybe from the \"realm of the angels.\" No explanation was given for what thatcomment meant. Auction's TOP SECRET Files\"The craft was like a living organism,\" claimed a document in one of thesecret files. When it was first recovered, there was a large hole on one side ofit (presumably caused by an internal explosion). The hole was equivalent toone-third the size of the ship (the actual size of the ship was not found in thesedocuments). Miraculously, three weeks after the craft was discovered, theship completely healed itself. To say the least, it was a very mysterioushappening, since the craft was monitored 24 hours a day. If Aliens did therepair work, they would have had to be invisible. The scientists whomonitored the craft reported that the healing occurred similar to a woundhealing on a human body. The skin simply grew back.At the end of the three weeks, there was no sign that the ship had ever bendamaged. The debris from the explosion covered several acres of land withmaterial that had the appearance and consistency of aluminum foil. Becausethe craft repaired itself, the scientists investigating it were unable to determinethe cause of the crash. But the size of the hole led them to believe that it hadto be an internal explosion - or the crash itself had caused that much damage.After studying the material and its strength, they knew it was highly unlikelythat any of their aircraft would ever have been able to knock down or evendamage the Alien craft.Of the three beings that were recovered from it, one was dead and two werestill alive. The three Aliens were removed from the craft at the time of itsrecovery and taken to an undisclosed location. The secret committee who hadpossession of the Alien craft had no knowledge of the whereabouts of theAliens and at that time were unconcerned. They had plenty on their handswith the Alien ship.Several months would pass before the scientists felt comfortable workinginside the Alien craft. Entering it was like walking into a \"time warp.\" Allsense of time vanished. Wrist watches did not operate inside the Alien craftand neither did any of their five senses. Things smelled differently or not atall. Food smelled peculiar and gave off a slight offensive odor, making itinedible. Perfume and cologne or body odor were undetectable. From whatthey could tell, the food was not contaminated from being on the ship andregained its natural smells and taste when it was taken out of the Alien craft.The other senses of sight, hearing, touch and taste were also changed. All thesenses were improved. They could see better and did not need eyeglasses. Ifthey had glasses, they had to take them off in order to see. It was the samewith hearing. All sound was crystal clear regardless of previous hearingabilities. Touch was so sensitive that it was almost erotic. The ship just simplyfelt good! But the scientists were not adapted to anything like this and it tooktime before they became comfortable in it.Although all the senses were on high alert, the description that was unanimousamong all who have entered the ship was that it was like being in a dream,literally. The other thing that bothered them was the feeling that somethingwas present in the ship, as if they were under observation. Because timepieces did not work onboard the ship, the scientists kept track of time byposting a sentry outside the craft who would enter it every few minutes. Whenthe craft was first discovered, the scientists spent hours and sometimes dayswithout being aware that a single moment had passed."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The interior of the craft was much larger than its physical exterior suggested.No one is sure that all of the rooms and compartments on board the craft havebeen discovered. All who entered it came out with a different number. Eachperson comes out with a different count each time they leave the craft.Another problem they faced was leaving the craft with intelligible notes.Everything they wrote down end dup being a maze of half-written words andsentences. They attempted to take pictures of the instruments and otherinterior rooms of the ship, but were unsuccessful. When they developed thefilm, it was as if it had been exposed. They tried different methods ofphotography. First, they enclosed the camera in an assortment of alloys. Whenthat failed, they tried metal and ceramic combinations to protect the film. Still,the film ended up exposed.Continued in Part 2 - Experiments on cadavers.More Information:For further reports about extraterrestrial biological entities and technologies, please seemy books, An Alien Harvest and the 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities in theEarthfiles Shop.
