For the next fewminutes, Justina heard rocks raining down on the roof so loudly that she worried her housewould collapse. What 74-year-old Justina Limache did not know was that a meteorite hadfallen near her home in Carancas, Peru, 62 miles (100 kilometers) southeast of Puno andnot far from Lake Titicaca. Carancas is a farm community of about 2,000 people who raisecows, alpacas, llamas and other animals on the high Andean plateau near the Bolivianborder.Carancas, Peru, meteorite crater on September 15, 2007,where ground water seeped in after impact.The crater filled with ground water quickly and first news reports stated that severalanimals were hurt and at least two hundred residents near the impact suffered headaches,nausea and breathing problems after inhaling “toxic fumes” emitted from the impactcrater. Back in September 2007, I interviewed Jose Machare, Science Doctorate andGeological Engineer in the Geology, Mining and Metallurgical Institute in Lima. He wastrying to understand what the meteorite was made of, whether the crater water wascontaminated with arsenic or other substance that might have sickened people andanimals, and whether there might still be a meteoritic fragment at the bottom of the water-filled crater."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Now in March 2008 at the NASA Lunar and Planetary Institute Conference in Houston,Peter Schultz, Ph.D., Prof. of Geological Sciences who specializes in impact cratering atBrown University, presented his first field research in Carancas from December 2007.Prof. Schultz reported to the conference that he and his graduate student measured thecrater to be 50 feet in diameter and on average 6 feet deep. The meteorite debris wasstoney H4H5 chondrite, not metallic iron that might be expected to punch a hole in theearth. The stoney meteorite came in from the east and sprayed some debris to the west asmuch as 656 feet (200 meters) away.The Carancas, Peru, debris field indicates the rockey meteorite came hit the ground atabout 15,000 miles per hour. Prof. Schultz's hypothesis is that high in the Earth'satmosphere, this meteor did not explode apart as would be expected and come down moreslowly at around 200 miles per hour. Instead, Prof. Schultz thinks the stoney meteorite wasencapsulated in its own shock wave all the way to Peru, hitting with unprecedented forcefor such soft and fragile rocky material.Recently I talked with Prof. Peter Schultz about his December field research that led himto his startling conclusion.Above and below: In December 2007, Prof. Peter Schultz on field research tripin Carancas, Peru, at meteorite crater which Prof. Schultz hypothesizes was caused by15,000 mph incoming stoney meteorite - \"unprecedented\" - on September 15, 2007.Images © 2007 by Peter Schultz, Ph.D.Interview:Peter Schultz, Ph.D., Prof. of Geological Sciences specializing in impact cratering,Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island: “What we discovered was that thisindeed came in at a very high speed. We had initially wondered: Was this like an object"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"coming in like the space shuttle where it comes in at a low angle and as it comes in, itdecelerates slowly in the atmosphere, gradually reaches terminal speed – kind of likejumping out of an airplane - and then plops on the ground. That was the going-in modelthat we had and other people had.But, when we got there, we looked at the nature of the crater, how widespread the ejectawas of the debris thrown out from the crater and we looked at the condition of thematerials thrown out by the crater. We discovered that this thing had to come in fast. Thiswas an unusual event. And this was the very first impact crater actually witnessed byhumans and recorded by humans that we know of, other than legend and lore.WHAT KIND OF SPEED ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?Our best guess, based on damage to the minerals that we found – my associate, graduatestudent Scott Harris was responsible for this. Based on those analyses, we think this wascoming in somewhere between 1 and 3 kilometers per second. If you think about this interms of miles per second, we’re talking about essentially 2/3s of a mile per second up toaround 2 miles per second. So this was coming in at a very high speed.SO, THIS IS WHERE THE 15,000 TO 17000 MPH COMES IN?Yes, and that’s the upper limits based on our estimates. It’s corroborated by eyewitnessaccounts of watching this come through the atmosphere. It’s eyewitnesses that weinterviewed while we were there.WHAT DID PEOPLE TELL YOU THEY SAW?They saw this thing brightening in the sky, got brighter and brighter, probably to thebrightness of the sun, passed quickly overhead and then slammed into the ground. Somereports had these people being washed over with dust from debris that was ejected out ofthe crater.DID YOU ASK ANYBODY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY HEARD SOUNDWHILE IT WAS IN THE AIR?Oh, yes, of course. We talked to people about that and we are pulling together a paper inmore detail.WHAT WAS THEIR DESCRIPTION OF THE SOUND?It ranged from being a whistling sound to a boom.From what I’ve seen in reports so far, the people took notice. They knew something wascoming and they turned to watch.HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK SAW IT IN THE AIR AND IMPACT WITHTHEIR OWN EYES?That’s a really good question. I know we were in a nearby town and they saw it in thedistance going over the mountains heading towards Carancas. There were other peopleliving in the Carancas area who saw it and felt it. I would imagine we are dealing withdozens and more. The small town nearby was not a tiny town. There were many peoplethere and right across the border in Bolivia because this flew right over Bolivia.WHAT ABOUT THE STORIES THAT ANIMALS DIED AT THE SCENE AFTER THEIMPACT?I heard the same stories. I don’t know how many were true. I heard there were some stockthat were injured.HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO GET ANY CHEMICAL ANALYSIS THAT MIGHTCONFIRM THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE ARSENIC OR SOME OTHERKIND OF TOXIC INGREDIENT THAT MIGHT HAVE MADE THOSE LOCALS SICK?The question is whether or not this was an illness induced by the dust? Or was it from thepercussion of the impact?If you have ever been very close to a sonic boom, you can feel how it reverberates in yourchest. That’s probably what happened here. This does not belittle people who were feelingill, but I don’t think we have to attribute this to arsenic or anything unusual delivered fromspace.DID YOU EVER CONFIRM WITH ANYBODY WHO WAS DOING WATERANALYSIS ABOUT WHETHER THEY FOUND ARSENIC IIN THE CRATER WATER?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Two things: if there is arsenic in the water it’s there and everybody in that area wouldshow signs of arsenic , which is a very distinctive kind of poisoning – especially over thelong term. Short term, it has to be very extreme. There is no way you could have thatextreme arsenic level – I don’t know if you have ever seen arsenic poisoning? There aresores that develop on the lower torso, but usually that is due to long term exposure. So justsaying arsenic is probably insufficient to cause sort of an instant reaction that you mightget from an impact slamming into the ground.SO, IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY, THERE IS NO HARD DATA ABOUTWHETHER THERE WAS ARSENIC IN THAT WATER?That’s my understanding, but there could be. I’m still questioning whether it would beattributable to the reported sicknesses because I think they were probably exaggerated.But I know for a fact that something hit. I know for a fact it would have scared peoplequite a bit. I know for a fact they probably would have felt pretty dizzy following the eventbecause of the repercussions that would have been formed by the impact. But the idea thatthere were people who were falling ill due to toxic substances, I don’t think is real.WHEN YOU AND YOUR GRAD STUDENT GOT THERE IN DECEMBER 2007, WASTHERE ANY WATER LEFT IN THE CRATER?Yes, there was. We poked around in the water. The water very quickly filled in right afterthe impact occurred. The water came bubbling up. The reason is that it hit in a dry streambed and these dry stream beds might be dry on the surface, but just below the surface –and in this case, about 3 to 4 feet there was still water pretty saturated. So, as soon as themeteorite slammed through the upper surface, that water came bubbling through. Stoney Meteorite Hitting At 15,000 MPH - “Unprecedented”Michael Farmer: “These are the largest pieces I acquired of the Carancas meteorite.Note the black fusion-crusted areas of the meteorites. It is actually not fusion crust, but ratherthese are clasts that were inside the matrix and blasted out on impact. These meteorite fragmentsare covered in black shock-veins, showing that this meteorite is clearly a very nice breccia.The meteorite seems to be very fragile, whether naturally, or from the pressure ofthe impact with planet Earth.” Image © 2007 by Michael Farmer.IT’S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IF THIS WERE ONLY A STONY METEORITE –SOME SORT OF AGGRAGATE COMING IN AROUND 15,000 MPH – WOULD BEUNPRECEDENTED?That’s right and why it’s such an interesting thing to study because the models up until thistime, except for a couple of models, would suggest that anything that is stony would havebroken apart and through interacting shock waves would have spread out like a pancakeand then the meteorites would simply have fallen to earth. That’s the typical model thatwe have been working with for awhile.But there is another model that involves something that is weak and as it comes throughthe atmosphere, it tends to break apart. This aggregates, and as it aggregates, it changesshape somewhat. That allows it to get much deeper into the atmosphere and all indications"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"that we have is that this did not spread out in a pancake, either on the basis of what wesaw on the ground, or on the basis of witnesses.SO, IF WE’VE GOT A LOT OF STONY BOULDERS IN SOME SORT OF ANAGGRAGATE, TIGHT OR LOOSE, COMING IN OUT ATMOSPHERE AT 15,000 OR16,000 MPH, WHAT WAS THE IMPACT LIKE ON THE GROUND THAT MADE THATCRATER?I can imagine it was pretty profound! I understand there were some seismic events thatpeople did pick up the impact in seismic records. There were reports of people talkingabout the extremely loud boom – the shock that must have been generated. So, this wouldhave been a scary event.WHY DO YOU THINK IT CAME IN SO FAST?Two things: in the upper atmosphere where this came in, it was probably going muchfaster. It had to be going perhaps as fast as 10 miles per second when it entered theatmosphere. So, the issue is: How did it make it all the way through the Earth’s atmospherewithout exploding?And I think the reason was it was weak enough that it broke apart (in upper atmosphere)before it had a chance to explode. As it came through, it changed its shape a bit andreduced the aerodynamic drag, which allowed it to get much deeper into the atmospherethan it would have normally. But much of this is still speculation because that’s what weare really trying to find out.SO UNTIL THIS CARANCAS, PERU, METEORITE, IT WAS NEVER THOUGHTPOSSIBLE THAT STONY METEORITES COULD PENETRATE THE ATMOSPHEREWITHOUT EXPLODING BEFORE THE GROUND ON EARTH?Basically. Typical terminal speed for iron or stony meteorites is on the order of 200 mph.So, if this had come through the atmosphere that way, then it would have come downabout 200 mph. So, we’re looking at something much faster than that.IN TERMS OF TNT, WHAT WOULD THE ENERGY IMPACT HAVE BEEN IN YOURCURRENT HYPOTHESIS?It was equivalent to a couple of tons of TNT. Meteorites, when they come through theatmosphere, should spread apart and fall to the ground and form pits with meteorites inthem. Carancas did not do that. It appeared to stay together, pierced the atmospherestaying at a very high speed when it slammed into the Earth. That’s what made it unusual.”More Information:For further reports about meteorites, please see reports below in the Earthfiles Archive:• 10/11/2007 — Carancas, Peru Meteorite Could Be 10 Tons• 09/26/2007 — Meteorite Fell in Carancas, Peru - Not Satellite• 12/31/2006 — Part 8: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 12/15/2006 — Stardust Comet Mission Reports New Kind of Organics• 12/08/2006 — NASA Wants Permanent Moon Base by 2024• 12/01/2006 — Deep Impact and Stardust: Are Comets Made of the Same Stuff?• 12/21/2005 — Updated: Part 2 - Peculiar Phenomenon, Early United States Efforts to Collectand Analyze Flying Discs• 06/29/2005 — July 3-4, 2005: NASA \"Deep Impact\" Spacecraft to Blast Hole in CometTemple I• 04/20/2005 — Outer Space Impact At Serpent Mound, Ohio, 256 Million Years Ago• 03/20/2005 — Astronaut John Young: \"The Moon Can Save Earth's Civilization.\"• 02/17/2005 — Iapetus and Enceladus: Baffling Moons of Saturn• 01/13/2005 — NASA \"Deep Space\" Craft Will Hit Comet On July 4, 2005• 09/04/2004 — Hillsboro, Ohio Corn Formation - High Strangeness in Soil and Plants• 06/25/2004 — Wild 2, An Amazing Comet• 05/13/2004 — Updated with Navy Physicist: Unidentified, Invisible Aerial ObjectsVideotaped in Infrared by Mexican Air Force Pilots• 03/31/2004 — Methane on Mars - Biology?
