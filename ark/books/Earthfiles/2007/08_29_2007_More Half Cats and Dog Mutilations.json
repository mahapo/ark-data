Updated September 4, 2007 Edmonton, Alberta, Canada - On Saturday, September 1,2007, a cat was found dead and mutilated behind Holy Cross School in Edmonton.Edmonton Police Service Sgt. Jeff Anderson confirmed the cat had been partially skinnedand some of its internal organs had been removed without blood. He also confirmed thatthe cat had a collar tag and on August 26th had been reported missing from a residencethree blocks from the Holy Cross School. This would be at least the 22nd mutilated catreported in Edmonton over the past year. Police and the Edmonton Humane Society arewarning residents to keep their cats inside. If anyone has any information, please call theEdmonton Police Service at: 780-423-4567.Updated August 30 /August 29, 2007 - I have been reporting about half cat mutilationssince the 1980s. I have interviewed grieving cat owners and Societies for the Prevention ofCruelty to Animals in London, all over Canada and from the west to the east and Gulfcoasts of the United States. To date, no one has ever been arrested, arraigned andconvicted on one of the bloodless half cat mutilation assaults.Now between August 19th and 24th, 2007, in Barrie, Ontario, Canada, north of Toronto onthe west side of Lake Simcoe, the back half of one cat was found August 19th, the fronthalf of another two days later on August 21st and two days after that on August 23rd,another front half of a cat was found. The general lack of blood and fur at most scenessuggests to authorities that the cats were taken, cut in half in another location and thehalves returned for reasons unknown to the neighborhood lawns where the half cats havebeen found.Ontario, Canada: Cat MutilationsBarrie, Ontario, Canada, August 19 - 24, 2007"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Barrie, Ontario, Canada is north of Toronto on the west side of Lake Simcoe.Beaverton, Ontario, is directly to the east of Barrie across Lake Simcoe.Both tow ns have had half cat mutil ati ons i n past ni ne months.The most recent top half of a cat found on August 23rd, was near a popular walking trailoff Ferndale on the north side of Barrie – the opposite side of town from the first two inthe south.The next day on August 24th, Rachel Banks who is the Animal Cruelty Investigator for theBarrie SPCA, went to the scene. This was her 3rd half cat investigation and the first threein her five years of working animal cruelty in Barrie, Ontario, Canada.On Friday, August 24, 2007, Rachel Banks on left, Animal Cruelty Investigatorfor the Barrie, Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (OSPCA), and branchmanager, Sandra Kiyonaga, bagged the third and most recently mutilated cat found in Barrie, alongthe Nine-Mile Portage Trail, off Ferndale Drive North.

We do not believe that these"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"injuries and mutilations were caused by other animals. It looks like there is more humaninvolvement.COULD YOU PLEASE DESCRIBE EACH OF THE THREE CATS AS THEY WEREFOUND?I can give you what I’m allowed to, certainly. I can let you know that each of the cats wasfound cut in half, unfortunately. The first one we were only able to locate the bottom half(August 19). The second one we were only able to find the top half (August 21). Therewas only the top half in the third cat as well (found August 23, Banks investigated August24). The third also had its legs cut off and placed beside it.ON THIS THIRD CAT, IT IS THE FRONT HALF OF THE CAT THAT WAS THEREAND LYING NEXT TO IT WERE THERE TWO OR FOUR LEGS THAT HAD BEENCUT OFF AND LAYED NEXT TO THE FRONT HALF?There were only two legs placed next to the body. The other two legs were not found.WERE THEY THE TWO FRONT LEGS?They were. “We haven’t been able to locate the owners of the cats based on the halfremains we did find. All were healthy adult cats. One was wearing a collar. Unfortunately,it had no tags. They were all three well-groomed, well cared for cats, so we are assumingthese are owned cats. And we have had some inquiries from people as well as somephotographs dropped off (for comparison) to try to I. D. these animals. But nothingconcrete yet, unfortunately.WAS EACH CAT FOUND IN A FRONT YARD OR BACK YARD OF A HOUSE?The first cat was found in the back yard of a fairly new, busy residential area here in town.The second cat was found a few kilometers away – I believe at a local high school in theirfootball field.The third cat was found on the other side of town on a popular dog-walking trail.THE FIRST TWO CATS WERE ON WHICH SIDE OF BARRIE?On the south end of Barrie.AND THE THIRD CAT WAS FOUND IN WHAT DIRECTION?In the north end.TOTALLY THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF TOWN?Yes. (about 10 kilometers apart)DID YOU GO TO EACH SITE?I did.DID YOU SEE SIGNS OF FUR, BLOOD OR STRUGGLE?Not in the first two. There was nothing out of the ordinary to indicate these cats werekilled or had a struggle at the sites. The third one we found was a little more odd. Thewoman who had reported it, she found it when she thought it was newly deceased, so shedid note some blood. By the time we got there the next day, there was no blood. However,there was fur. So, it did look like some sort of struggle had occurred, or if it’s a criminal actwe’re looking into that it occurred at that spot.IN THE FIRST TWO CATS – WHICH IS SO TYPICAL OF HALF CAT MUTILATIONSOVER AT LEAST THE PAST THIRTY SOME YEARS – WHAT ALWAYS IMPRESSESLAW ENFORCEMENT AND PEOPLE WHO OWN THE CATS IS THE SCENE ISBLOODLESS, CLEAN, NO SIGNS OF STRUGGLE. WOULD THAT SUGGEST TOYOU THAT THE CATS ARE PICKED UP, TAKEN SOME PLACE, AND THENRETURNED?It looks as if the first two were. We can’t say with definitive certainty right now, but itdoes look as if they were placed in the locations that we found them.WHEN YOU TALK WITH POLICE AND AUTHORITIES ABOUT THAT, WHAT ISTHEIR COMMENT ABOUT THE PROCESS OF TAKING THE ANIMALS FROMTHEIR NEIGHBORHOODS TO SOME PLACE, CUTTING THEM IN HALF ANDRETURNING ONLY THE FRONT OR BACK HALF BLOODLESS?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Certainly they are concerned. It’s not a very usual occurrence here in this town. We’venever dealt with it before and everyone is quite horrified by this if these acts are beingcommitted by a resident of our community. Certainly, they are very concerned. There is adefinitive link between cruelty towards animals and continuing on eventually leading toviolence and cruelty towards people. Certainly, the police are very concerned about this aswell.DO YOU OR ANY OF THE AUTHORITIES INVESTIGATING THIS SPECULATE HOW THIS PROCESS OF GETTING THE CATS, TAKING THEM SOME PLACEELSE, CUTTING THEM IN HALF AND RETURNING THEM IS ACCOMPLISHED?Everything is pending the necropsy reports. We’re not sure how these acts were done,what weapon these acts were committed with or anything like that. But I have to reiteratethat it does look like the first two cats that were found were certainly injured or killed inanother location and then taken and dumped at the locations found. All three sites arepopular areas in the neighborhoods and they were placed in such a way to lead us tobelieve that somebody wanted them to be found.So, whether it’s an adult who has some sort of a large fenced back yard away from peoplewhere nobody is going to notice, or a basement perhaps, or a local teenager? We’re notsure at this point in time of how they are doing this. But we are hoping that the necropsyreports will give us a better idea after they have studied the cuts and bones – what theseacts were committed with and whether they were pre-mortem, or post-mortem will give usa better idea of what we’re looking for anyway.WHO IS DOING THE NECROPSIES?We’re sending them down to the University of Guelph (Gwelf), which is our leadinganimal laboratory in Canada.DO YOU KNOW WHEN THEY EXPECT THE RESULTS OF THE NECROPSIES AREAVAILABLE?I’m hoping in the next few days. It depends on how many emergency cases they get. Theywork very closely with us. We’re estimating another couple of days.HAVE YOU ASKED THEM TO CHECK THE EXCISIONS FOR EVIDENCE OF HIGHHEAT ?We’ve asked for any information they can give us on the incisions – anything at all – ifthere is high heat involved, if there is a blade that’s involved? What kind of blade?Everything. They are pretty much doing a complete work up for us.IN WORK I DID WITH A HEMATOLOGIST/PATHOLOGIST IN DENVER IN THEEARLY 1990S, INVOLVING HALF CATS FOUND IN VANCOUVER, B. C. ANOFFICE THERE SHIPPED ONE OF THE FRONT HALF CATS TO THEHEMATOLGIST/PATHOLOGIST IN DENVER, JOHN ALTSHULER, M. D. IN HISEXAMINATION, HE CONFIRMED THAT THE ENTIRE EXCISION OF THE CATHAD BEEN DONE WITH HIGH HEAT, HOT ENOUGH TO COOK THEHEMOGLOBIN AND COLAGEN.Wow. I’ll certainly put a call into the university and let them know they should look forthat as well.This is a very odd case for us in Barrie and we are not generally used to dealing withsituations like this. Usually we deal with animals that are alive and we’re able to help. So,it’s quite frustrating for us in this case that I’m now not only dealing with deceasedanimals, but ones that have also been mutilated. So, we’re certainly hoping that we canfind an answer to what is going on - it’s certainly odd!” Barrie Police Sergeant, David Goodbrand, told The Barrie Examiner, \"Some of our mostserious criminals and serial killers started by mutilating animals. You wonder what’s goingon in that person’s head. Is this someone who really hates cats, or is doing this for his ownenjoyment?” Police are waiting for necropsy results.Anyone with information, please call the Barrie OSPCA at 705-728-7311.

Nine months ago onNovember 21, 2006, a 9-year-old family cat named Tigger raised from kittenhood by itsowner, Kim Besaw, was also found \"cut clean in half.\" In that case, the back half of thecat had been left on a neighbor's lawn. Both the Durham Regional Police and DurhamHumane Society investigated and confirmed that a number of pets had been reportedmissing from the Beaverton region in the weeks following the gruesome death of Tigger.The Durham Humane Society: (905) 433-3965 or Durham Regional Police Service: (888) 579-1520.Debbie Houghton of the Durham Humane Society and the Ontario Society for thePrevention of Cruelty to Animals (OSPCA) has investigated half cats before. In late 1999to 2000, Toronto police and OSPCA investigated at least ten cases, but no perpetrator wasever found.During the first week of November 1999, a $60,000 reward was offered by the OntarioSociety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals for information about ten mutilated catsafter that round of half cats began in August 1999. During that same time period in 1999,beyond Ontario, Canada, half cats were also being reported in London, England; San Jose,California; and Ft. Worth, Texas. Over the past couple of decades, odd cat mutilationshave also been investigated repeatedly in Plano, Texas; Tustin, California; Falls Church,Virginia and several other U. S. and Canadian regions.

Recently, the Edmonton Humane Society,Edmonton police and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) met to discuss the catmutilation phenomenon and to form a joint task force for investigations. Officials aren'treleasing details of the deaths yet during the ongoing investigations, but it is presumed tobe the same half cat syndrome as in Ontario.

Tony Tenore found his cat cut inhalf on his front yard lawn. Half a dozen other neighbors have found mutilated cats in theiryards. And at the end of May, Henry Boenning, who lives only a couple of doors fromTony Tenore, found his 16-year-old cat gutted without blood.Since then, Florida Okaloosa County Sheriff’s deputies and animal control officers stillhave unsolved cases about mutilated cats in Destin and Fort Walton Beach. Only twomonths ago, 14-year-old Jackie Gibson's cat, Bubba, was found mutilated with a sharpinstrument in the Kell-Aire Gardens region of Destin and placed in a neighbor's yard onJune 26, 2007.The Northwest Florida Daily News reported, \"Bubba’s death is one of two recent catdeaths that have been confirmed as being done by a human. The other one happened twodays later on June 28,2007, in Mary Esther. The cases are eerily reminiscent of a rash ofcat cruelty cases that occurred last summer in 2006. Investigators are looking into apossible connection.\"Three of the cats — including Bubba — lived on Kell-Aire Court in Destin.The details of the deaths are grisly. Many of the cats were found skinned and missingparts. Some of them were cut in half. In the case of the dead cat in Mary Esther, the fronthalf of the cat was never found.“'We have so few of these and they are so close in proximity.
