Out of print.Return to Part 1November 14, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Chapter 2 (continued)UFO CrashAladdin's TreasureThere are many gadgets on the ship. Most of them have been taken out of theship and experimented with. Others, even though they are portable, cannot betaken out of the craft. An invisible force keeps them from being carried out.Every Alien gadget somehow knows what its purpose is. Unlike humangadgets (such as hammers and toasters, which are static and only functioncorrectly if at all with the help of a human), Alien objects seem to haveconsciousness and perform duties on their own, if they feel like it!The opening or doorway to the ship is another mystery. When someone"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"approaches the craft with the intention of entering it, an opening appearsinstantly. If there is no intention of entering it, nothing opens. It can beentered from any location around its perimeter. Wherever one approached it,an opening occurred. Once the door opened, it led to the exact same place, nomatter which location it opened from. And \"yes,\" if all those who studied thecraft formed a circle around it and all intended to enter at the same time, theydid! According to the testimony in the documents: \"There are no doors as weknow them, only an opening that accommodated the size of the person orpersons entering it.\"The largest number of persons that entered the alien craft during that oneexperiment was 42. They were fearful of adding too many more, thinking thatthey might squeeze someone into an alternate reality or into anotherdimension. The people who worked on this project were all avid viewers ofRod Sterling's The Twilight Zone. To them, fictional shows were moreinformational than entertaining.Many and possibly all of the items had animation qualities. They moved ontheir own, meaning they squirmed, crawled, levitated and flew. Somescientists swear they've seen them walk! The size of the gadgets ranged fromas little as a deer tick to the size of a basketball, with the majority of the itemsfitting in the palm of the average man's hand. Some gadgets were treated bythe scientists as enjoyable toys. They fought over them like children do over anew plaything, each impatiently waiting their turn to inspect and tinker withthat particular object. Many of the items are made of a metallic substance.Others are made from a highly refined type of plastic, or what appeared to beplastic. Unlike toys, all are indestructible.When the scientists attempted to dissect the Alien gadgets or tools orwhatever they are, they discovered there are no seams or other means to openthem. They appeared to be cast from one solid piece. Their attempts to studythe items were further blunted when x-ray did not penetrate the material.They had no means to understand what made these things work. The powersource was equally mysterious. The items did not require batteries and stillmaintain optimum performance whenever or wherever they are used, on oroff the ship. Nothing connected with the craft aged at all; if anything, theAlien gadgets appeared to improve. Experiments are performed on cadaversSince the ship had more than one room (some had counted three) that lookedlike surgical rooms, the scientists felt that many, if not all, of the gadgets wererelated to, or performed medical functions. With that in mind, the scientistsexperimented on cadavers. But after many tries, they came to the conclusionthat most of the Alien equipment did not respond to dead flesh. They theyexperimented on dead and living animals. Again, no instrument responded onthe dead animals, but some of the instruments became activated when placedon certain animals, mainly cattle and horses.Because there is no outward appearance or labeling that identified thefunction of any of the Alien objects, they had to stumble around, sometimesawkwardly, until a function \"happened.\" This was accomplished by placingthe objects on the animals or in a close proximity to the animals to see whatmight take place. Unlike human gadgets such as forks, spoons, scalpels andwrenches, whose functions are easily understood by most people by simplylooking at them, the function of the Alien gadgets are found only through trialand error.During the experiments with the animals, they discovered that someinstruments responded when they came within one inch from touching theanimal. Others needed to have direct contact with the animal before theywould activate. An Alien object was considered \"activated\" when it reacted inany number of ways such as: changing colors, size or shape, or simplyperforming its function on that animal - for example, removing a specific bodypart or performing a biopsy. What these instruments did was unclear to theearly experimenters. In their notes, they could only describe that the Alienobjects mutilated the animals by removing tissue and sometimes organs for noapparent reason. The animals were all healthy prior to the experiments andwould have probably survived if the scientists had known how to reverse theprocedure."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Experimenting on humans was not too taboo in the 1940s and was practicedin many countries, as well as in the United States, albeit covertly. But evenbefore tests were begun on human guinea pigs, some scientists who fiddledwith these Alien tools unwittingly were maimed and in a few cases killed bythe instruments. Some incidents have been recorded. Others were discussedword of mouth, passing information from one scientist to another. Manythings that were written down were not meant to be shared by other scientistswithin the program, but were to be forwarded directly to the committee. Howmany scientists lost their lives will never be known due to the secret nature ofthis project.One of the first injuries recorded took place the second month after the shipwas found. It happened to a metallurgist who was studying the behavior ormetal when it became animated. He and a colleague were closely monitoring abatch of Alien objects that were assigned to them that morning. The scientistswere located in a separate building from where the Alien craft was stored. Byputting some distance between the craft and the Alien objects, they had hopedto eliminate any interference or potential influence that the craft might haveon the objects. They knew by then that experimenting while inside the craftwas a waste of time, not to mention practically impossible. It was a place like\"Alice in Wonderland,\" a nice place to visit, but impossible to get any workdone there.They had scattered the Alien objects around a large table in the metallurgist'slab. They were going to observe and then study any object that activatedwhen they placed a live rabbit on the table. They watched for responses fromthe objects. It did not take long. As the rabbit hopped about, the scientistnoticed that one of the objects changed color when the rabbit passed by it.Thinking that the metal might change shape, he wanted to hold it in his handto get a feel for what was taking place. The metal quivered, so he took it to hisdesk where the light was better for a closer look. As he studied it under thelight of his desk lamp, somehow his face made contact with the object. That'swhen the thing became animated and instantly scooped out his eyeball!It happened so quickly that he didn't have time to drop the object, which wasstill holding his eyeball securely in its scoop. His colleague, after seeing whathad happened, thought that the Alien object was attacking his fried andsummoned the guard who was posted outside the room in the hall. He and theguard rushed over to help. Reluctantly his associate grabbed the instrumentwith the eye in it as the injured scientist collapsed to the floor. There was noblood coming from the collapsed scientist, but he was in severe pain and wentinto shock. His colleague was perplexed about what to do with the eyeball. Hetold the guard to stay with the injured man. He then ran down the hall andplaced the eyeball, along with the Alien object which was still holding it, intoa refrigerator that was in the lunchroom.They were unable to save the eye, even though it was not damaged in anyway. The doctors who examined the injured scientist were baffled by theprecision with which the eye was removed. No doctors or technique that theyknew of could perform that kind of an operation. This Alien instrument, on itsown, completed a complex surgical procedure in a split second: it cauterizedall the blood vessels without damaging the eye socket or the eyeball!Everyone present knew that this was beyond \"magic.\" It was outright scary!What frustrated the scientists most was the fact that they were certain theyhad an instrument in their possession that would put the eyeball back into itssocket, but no one knew how to use it.Because of that incident and others, the team that was assembled for thisparticular project decided that if they were going to continue and have anychance of unlocking the secrets of these magical instruments, they would needto shield themselves from future similar mishaps. Most of the accidents werejust that - \"accidents.\" But the scientists did knowingly take risks andexperiment on one another on a few occasions.The first week that the scientists were allowed to experiment with the Alienobjects, the objects began disappearing. At first, it was thought that someonewas playing some kind of a prank on them, taking the objects from thelaboratories and returning them back to the ship. But that scenario did notmake sense because all of the labs were locked and none of them were brokeninto. Each lock had a special key that would have been difficult to duplicate.The scientists were baffled, but after a few weeks a pattern did emerge.Every item from the ship, regardless of where it was, whether it was in"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"another state or some other place in the world, vanished exactly three daysfrom when it was taken out of the ship. Each and every item then emergedback on board the ship at the precise moment they vanished. Somehow theAlien ship remained in contact with all that was associated with it, no matterthe distance. Cataloguing each item was a nightmare. Items changed shapeand size in response to handling by the scientists, by the intensity of light inthe room, by the temperature or even by the mood of the person handling it.There was so much magic in this one Alien craft that it was practicallyimpossible for the specialists to stay focused on their work. At times, thescientists displayed signs associated with psychosis. Their personalitiesgyrated from \"giddy with delight\" one moment and totally \"frustrated\" and\"demonic\" the next. On several occasions, guards were called into the labs torestrain a belligerent scientist making all sorts of preposterous accusations anddemands. One told a co-worker to kneel and kiss a ring on his finger. Then heyelled at the top of his voice when the co-worker refused. Another onethreatened to kill a colleague's family if he didn't receive a birthday card fromhim. Two others played like children, singing and clapping their hands whiletalking to a make-believe friend.Those cases are a small sampling of strange happenings that took place. Thesewere not episodes of bored scientists horsing around. Most of them had to berestrained and taken off the base. Many of them recovered within a day ortwo and had no recollection of what they did. But in a few cases, the scientistshad to be institutionalized permanently.The scientists were never able to master the Alien instruments. Instead, theinstruments seemed to be playing mind games with them, kind of a \"SimonSays\" routine: \"Do as I say, not as I do.\" Not that the instruments talked,which was amazing, since they seemed to be able to do everything else.But they did play guessing games. Scientists sometimes had to guess what anitem did before it became operational. For instance, what part of the humananatomy was it programmed to function on: The brain? Internal organs?Nervous system? Digestive track? If the instruments were placed in thevicinity of the body that was not \"its specialty,\" it did nothing and stayeddormant. But on occasion, if it was in one of those \"playful moods,\" itremained dormant when placed where it should be and activated when placedwhere it had no function.Continued in Part 3 - Alien Technology ExperimentsMore Information:For further reports about extraterrestrial biological entities and technologies, please seemy books, An Alien Harvest and the 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities in theEarthfiles Shop.
