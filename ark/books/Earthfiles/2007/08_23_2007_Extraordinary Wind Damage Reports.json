After it was over, Raymond Wood, who has farmed for 45 years in BooneCounty north of Columbia, could not believe the damage to his cornfield. Half of his sixacres were laying flat to the ground, \"snapped clean off\" at or near the base of the stalks.“This is the first time I have ever seen so much crop down like that.”Raymond Wood estimates that more than 50 percent of his 6-acre cornfield was flattened byan August 12, 2007, storm that hit off Route E in Boone County north of Columbia, Missouri.Image © 2007 by Tyson Anderson/Missourian.The Missourian interviewed Scott Truett, a forecaster at the National Weather Service inSt. Louis, who said that “sometimes during severe thunderstorms, a ‘downburst wind’ canhit a specific surface area and fan out, leaving the rest of the area undamaged.”The Missourian also talked with Bill Wiebold, a professor of plant sciences at MissouriUniversity, about the flattened-to-the-ground corn stalks. Prof. Wiebold said it is called“green snap.” Wiebold explained that “before corn reaches full maturity, the stem is stillfull of water and very turgid, which makes it easier to break.” Santa Fe, New Mexico National Forest"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Hikers reported the extraordinarily large \"blowdown\" in June 2007.Forest ranger investigations since have confirmed 1300 acres of trees -almost 4 miles long and about a mile wide in places - are flattenedto the ground. Video frame © 2007 by KOAT-TV.In June 2007, some hikers in the Santa Fe National Forest contacted forest rangers withthe Santa Fe National Forest office. The hikers reported that thousands of trees were\"snapped off\" at the ground.Miles Standish, at the Santa Fe National Forest office, confirmed to KOAT-TV that\"thirteen hundred acres, almost 4 miles long, almost a mile wide in places, almost acontinuous swath of trees were just mowed down.\"The devastation can be seen from the air or from the top of Pecos Baldy mountain. Butgetting in there is now difficult because downed trees block the Rio Medio, Rio Capulinand Horsethief Meadow trails. Rangers say that at least the Rio Medio trail through abouteight miles of back country will get to the edge of the huge tree blowdown.Still not understood by foresters is why so many trees snapped off at the ground. Onehypothesis is that the trees might have had more shallow root systems than normal. Orthere was a lot of moisture in the soil from more rain than normal, making the trees heavierand perhaps more likely to fall over in heavy winds.More Information:If viewers have more information about extraordinarily large wind blowdowns in yourregion, please email me at earthfiles@earthfiles.comWebsites:NOAA's Storm Prediction Center: http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/061115_rpts.htmlTornadoes In Swedish Forests: http://svemet.org/tornado.html Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
