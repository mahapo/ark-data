S. military space program and found thatit struck a cord from my past. In the mid 80s I was stationed at LosAngeles Air station, California, as a medic. This, I was informed, was whereAirForce personnel and private military contractors designed the SpaceShuttle.Without getting to the many rumors of advanced research that I heard whilestationed there, I can tell you that my fellow Air Men and I wheresolicited for duty in a new devision of the Air Force. At the time wewere told that it would be called the \"Space Force.\" It was to handlemilitary matters from space. It was (as far as we were told) involvedwith support for manned military space missions.I believe that this program must have been in existence for many yearsbefore we were solicited for duty as we were not informed of any securityrestrictions such as would be imposed by a confidential or secret rating.Generally, medical non-commissioned officers are the last to know what issecret, as the military works on a need to know basis.Coincidentally, I have an old Popular Science magazine that details amilitary space program that involved orbiting space platforms thatharbored nuclear missiles aimed at various countries. As I recall, theplatform had a crew of 6. A space shuttle was used to routinely changecrews. The really interesting part was that this was supposed to havetaken place around the 1950s! And according to Popular Science, all ofthis was supported by government documents that were released through theFreedom of Information Act. I guess my point is that if the military werecarrying out routine space shuttle flights and maintaining orbiting spacestations in the 1950s or early 1960s, what incredibly advanced spacevehicles our military must be flying in now! And apparently, NASA must beused to convince the public that our current technology, such as with ourvery old and decrepit Space Shuttle program, is the best we have, whileour military conducts space missions with technology that we can onlyfantasize about while watching Star Trek. 2) Subject: Secret American Military Space Program?Date: December 20, 2007To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comI've just read through your article about \"a secret American military spaceprogram\" with great interest, especially since reading a couple of yearsago about it (existence of ) on an Australian government website: ProjectWormwood, Learmonth Solar Observatory, Australian Government, IPSRadio and Space Services.The URL is http://www.ips.gov.au/IPSHosted/neo/index.htmlThe information on the website hasn't changed as far as I can tell and thepurpose of \"Project Wormwood\" at Learmonth Solar Observatory inWestern Australia is \"Planetary Defense and Space Debris\" studies.This site is the only place I have ever read of the \"U.S. Air Force SpaceCommand\" which, according to the description page quoting the commanderof the \"50th Space wing\" Colonel Simon (Pete) Worden, is \"planetarydefense.\"The site may well be worth your and Earthfiles viewers perusal as it showshow NASA fits into all this as an instigator of the project - and readingbetween the lines just what they are up to, but don't quite spell out - especially"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"how defense actually means offense in today's Orwellian doublespeak. 2) Subject: \"Secret Air Force Space Program\"Date: December 9, 2007To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comLongtime listener to Coast to Coast. Caught your story about the \"secret\"program. I'm a retired Electrical Engineer from Bechtel Corp. in SanFrancisco. In my career, I worked on a variety of projects for Bechtel in the1950s, 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, ranging from refinery and chemicalplants to the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline in the early 1970s and several nuclearpower stations.Our company, published a monthly magazine called the Bechtel Brief, thatspotlighted new and ongoing projects around the world. One that I particularlyremember was the award of a contract to Bechtel for the construction oflaunch facilities for a \"reusable\" space plane at Vandenberg AFB. The projectwas started and I even had a small part in it designing launch control panelsfor the onsite facilities. A photo shoot was included in one of the company'sBriefs that clearly showed the pad and the plume shoots for the boosters andmain engines.One of the interesting features of this facility was the design of a waterinjection system to control particulates from the solid rocket boosters and toreduce acoustic damage to the concrete from the engines (something that wasretrofitted to the pad in Florida several years into the NASA program).Time frame for this, in my fading recollection, would have been in the early tomid 1970s. The project was abruptly shut down and the engineers reassigneddue to what I recall was a dispute with the California Coastal Commission orsome environmental group(s) because of the site's proximity to the Californiacoast, nesting birds and the launch tracks over southern California andconcerns over possible mission aborts with \"military\" cargoes.This WAS during the time when the Air Force was starting the Global GPSprogram and had hinted at the launch of nuclear powered satellites. As amatter of fact, I recall that one of the first geostationary sats was a spy satprogram named Pegasus that was believed to have been nuclear powered (itwas), but denied by the Air Force...let them come and get me!I worked with many engineers who came to Bechtel from AeroJet inSacramento, California. AeroJet was where most of NASA's engines weretested (including the later SRBs) and they spoke constantly of the work outthere.Interestingly, the Soviets were building a parallel program to the Air Force's\"Shuttle.\" It was a bit smaller in dimension than the current NASA shuttles,but very very similar in shape, design and materials. The original Air Forceplane was also smaller than NASA's current configuration - but as a smallerconfiguration, identical to the Soviet's plane.Kinda provokes the question: \"Who stole who's design? Did we steal theirs?Or did they steal ours?\" But \"secret\"... not very. 3) Subject: Secret Astronaut CorpsDate: December 1, 2007 6:00:24 AM MSTTo: earthfiles@earthfiles.comMost of my military career was served as a technical intelligence officer /space systems designer for the NRO (National Reconnaissance Organization).In 1979, I wrote the \"Security Classification Guide for DOD STS (i.e. SpaceShuttle) Missions.\" Seven such semi-covert missions were - at that time - fullyplanned and scheduled for launch during the early years of the operationalflights.We couldn't make shuttle launches invisible. But the nature of the payload - ofwhich there were many types, each with (1) a specific final orbit and (2) aunique payload specialist (by name) - had to remain Top Secret. Identifyingeither of these items in the open press would have given the Russians a \"heads"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"up.\"All launches which did lift off before the Challenger disaster - at which timeall DOD Shuttle flights were cancelled - were identified only as \"DODMission 11-A,B,C...\" etc. (See the NASA/SHUTTLE/HISTORY webpage fordates)The cadre of some 20 secret DOD astronauts routinely trained with thenormal astronauts, but their names or faces never appeared in any NASAdocuments, training schedules or PIO films. Their uniforms and spacesuits didnot have name tags. While writing classified procedures or training forpayload-related activities, they lived in a Top Secret \"city\" built inside thegiant Crawler which carried (carries) Apollo and the Shuttle from the VerticalAssembly Building to the launch pad.USAF was building a huge STS launchsite and training facility at VandenbergAFB, California, so security on later classified missions could be maintained.Rockwell International even built a secret fifth shuttle for use there. But,when Challenger exploded, DOD payloads returned to using expendablelaunch vehicles. The secret shuttle became NASA's ATLANTIS.Again, this secret DOD Space Program ended with the Challenger explosion.The Vandenberg launchsite (SLC-6) is now leased to a private firm. I have noknowledge of any currently secret military or NASA manned space programs. 4) Subject: Military UFODate: December 7, 2007 9:01:27 AM MSTTo: earthfiles@earthfiles.comReport by physicist and pilot from two years ago on 04-09-2005: I saw what I believe to be a UFO in Comanche County, Texas, at9:12 PM local time.That evening, I was walking back to my motor home after wildboar hunting in an unpopulated area that I lease for hunting. Thesky was clear; wind calm and the sun had just set. The sky wasgrowing darker and darker blue straight above and stars werebeginning to show. The sky was becoming black in the east. Thesetting sun was still keeping the western horizon illuminated andindirect lighting from the west made it possible to see my waywithout a flashlight.I had my .243 Win. Remington 700 varmint rifle of which I am aquite an accomplished shooter. It is considered a \"high-powered\"rifle. I do quite a bit of bench rest competitive shooting with it aswell as hunting. The rifle is set up with a high-tech \"Leupold\"optical sight, (scope) which is extremely accurate and highlyspecialized for great light gathering ability and performs best inlow light conditions. It is not what is called a \"night vision\" sight.The scope magnifies the target image with great sharpness anddefinition and the magnification is adjustable from 4.5 to 14 timesthat of the natural image.Upon my return to the motor home, I was tired after a long walk.I had carried quite a bit of equipment with me. I sat on a chair,took my eyeglasses off and toweled my face as it is alreadybecoming hot in Texas. While I rested, without my glasses on, Inoticed three very \"unfocused\" lights to my south and these lightswere moving toward me. Immediately I put my glasses back onand saw what I believe was a UFO."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Illustration by eyewitness who saw the triangularcraft with his glasses on, © 2005.The object approached from the south-southwest and whilemoving north-north east, passed almost directly overhead makingno sound whatsoever. I estimate its altitude to be somewhereabout 800 feet and its airspeed speed approximately 30 mph. It\"floated\" and did not fly as it obviously had insufficient airspeedto fly. (I am a physicist & an FAA licensed pilot) While the skywas almost entirely black behind it, I could clearly see itsunderside as it was illuminated from the fading sunlight to thewest. I estimate that the machine was about 60 feet wide and 80feet long and 10 feet thick at the rear. Under its belly, there was astraight line going from its leading tip toward the center of the aftedge of the fuselage, which was perpendicular to its travel. Thisstraight edge clearly showed its shape to be three-dimensional.The straight line showed that its belly was V-shaped, much likethe hull of a speedboat. It was similar to the space shuttle as whenviewed from in front and below the shuttle.This machine was directly over me and I was alone in the middleof nowhere, therefore, I felt quite \"uneasy.\" It made nothreatening moves whatsoever, but I aimed my rifle at it andthrough the riflescope, which was set on 8.5 power, I couldclearly see surface detail in explicit detail. The machine’s surfacedetail appeared to be covered with well-fitted tiles, much like theceramic tiles used on the United States Space Shuttle. Then in thefading light, I noticed a distinct marking.This marking was absolutely shocking, as I could actually read it!It was white print outlined in black on a red arrow pointingtoward a rectangle of sorts. The arrow pointed at a somethingrectangular that I cannot define, but I clearly could read thesethree words, “EMERGENCY RELEASE and RESCUE.” In thesame place were other words that appeared too fuzzy to read. Isuspect that these words were “PULL FOR...” Instantly I realizedthat this was a military machine and no “flying saucer.” I feltmuch better as I knew that these were surface details that wereintended to help rescue people access and then be able to removethe pilots on board in the event of a crash.I kept the crosshairs on the center of the aircraft as it disappearedinto the darkness but as I realized it was “one of ours” and it wasnot a threat to my own personal safety (I think) I put the riflesafety back on. I can see however that others may have"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"“defensively” shot at it --- and that may have resulted in a crashof the vehicle.I am somewhat “pissed off” at the military as while this area isdirectly under the Ft. Hood, Texas MOPA and practice flights areflown daily, really - they should not be taking chances like thiswhere someone on the ground could actually be shooting thedamned things down! I am sure that the military pilots (if it evenhad a crew...) were aware of my presence but they NEVERexpected possible “offensive action” to be taken against them onthis low level flight. The last thing I would have ever have wantedwould have taken a “defensive” shot and then find Americanmilitary pilots onboard in the wreckage. 5) Subject: DIA and EBE's/military?Date: December 9, 2007 4:38:03 PM MSTTo: earthfiles@earthfiles.comHad a good friend who used to work at Denver International Airport (DIA)and I grilled him at length about anything he's seen at the airport, as I knewvery well the \"conspiracy theories\" that abound about the place. Note that heworked as a cleaner at the airport and so, had extra access in terms of timeframes (overnight) and access points. These were some things he told me hepersonally witnessed.1) A \"bleep\" approaching on control tower that appeared at same time eachnight, but never appeared to the naked eye.2) Once they saw a shower of what looked to be fireworks or some kind ofexplosion far out in the landing areas in middle of the night.3) Large collections of dead creatures (squirrels, rabbits, etc) found in openareas.4) A place where the \"ground flips up\" and blacked out SUV's routinely drivein and out. An official told them once that it was \"NASA\" operating there.5) Entered what appeared to be an elevator room on the lowest known floorand pushed the down button, whereupon FBI agent immediately appeared andshoo'd him away.6) Once while walking past a mysterious door an agent appeared and told himthey were never to even go past this door! When he said they had a pass, thenthe guy bragged that you needed a pass \"like this\" and showed him some kindof electronic flashing pass thing. Has experienced similar \"shooing\" in sometunnel areas. 6) Subject: EAST Loring Air Force Base!Date: December 8, 2007To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comI have a friend who was in the U. S. Air Force and worked guarding nuclearsites, like up in Montana. At one point he was stationed at Loring AFB inMaine (near Limestone, Aroostook County, Maine). He said that there werealways rumors of \"something\" happening at one of the facilities there, but hesaid it was another part called \"East Loring,\" which had been shut down yearsbefore he was stationed at Loring.He had a few friends who were dangerously bold and decided they wanted togo see the closed down East Loring base. I don't know their names, so let'scall them friends #1, #2, and #3. Friends #1 and #2 were determined to go;friend #3 would go along with their plan, but he didn't want to go himself.Friend #3 would just try to cover for them while they checked it out.What we know is friend #1 and #2 reached a large concrete facility that wassort of like a big courtyard. It was a wreck and abandoned, but had huge,thick walls of concrete around it with guard towers there. The first bizarrething they noticed about this place was the machine-gun mounts (no gunswere there, just the quick-set mounts to put them on). The mounts wereinstalled around the base to face inward, instead of to face outside the base,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"like you'd assume a normal defensive setup would be. Friends #1 and #2continued to look around and they got deeper and deeper into the base.Finally they reached some heavily blocked in areas, but they wanted tocontinue.I don't know exactly how this is possible, but they found a way inside andwent down vehicle ramps that were going several stories below ground andfinally reached another impassable area. They found a way around anddiscovered what they described as an \"underground city.\" They drew a mapfor my friend and he showed me.Underground, there was a Burger King, a pharmacy or something, and half ofa K-mart like store. Then the whole area had concrete that had been pouredin. I'm pretty sure they were telling that these were actual full-scale, workable,self-standing buildings. Maybe this place had been the site of a weird socialexperiment or something to see if normal life could exist in a huge bunker? Idon't know. I'm guessing.They reached a point where they could only go further by crawling throughsome ruined parts and #1 took off his pack and gun and wanted to continue.#2 thought this was crazy and wanted to leave right then, but #1 told him towait. Anyway, #2 was waiting outside, getting impatient because #1 had beengone too long. But then #1 came running out, told #2 he saw \"something\" andthen they both scrambled back to Loring AFB.The reason they were discovered and got into trouble was because in hispanic, #1 left the pack and gun and that's a serious, serious problem. Theywere both in severe trouble, and I'm pretty sure they were sent to other bases.#1 told #2 about \"whatever\" he saw that scared him so bad, and then theyboth explained it to #3. #3 was very specific about retelling the story to mybuddy, and said that they told him what they saw, but he would NOT tell myfriend.I guess that implies one of those \"better off not knowing\" sort of deals if it isto be taken seriously, but I don't know. The rumors that the base circulatedwas that whatever was going on in the East Loring underground was aborted,and the facility was flooded to secure it. I don't know if this means theyflooded it with all the staff unknowing, still inside, to silence a problem, orwhat?
