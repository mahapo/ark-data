I can see an animal being taken up in this.\"- Judy Doraty, Houston, Texas April 18, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - I think what persuaded me to seriouslyconsider that extraterrestrials might actually be the worldwide mutilators of cattle, horses,goats, sheep, pigs, rabbits, cats, dogs and wild animals such as deer and elk was an\"eyewitness\" named Judy Doraty. I qualify \"eyewitness\" because the information wasgained through hypnosis. However, Judy's story began in full consciousness with four otherfamily members.On a clear moonlit night in May 1973, Judy was driving back from a bingo game inHouston, Texas. She and her mother, her teenage daughter, Cindy, her sister-in-law andbrother-in-law watched a bright light hover in the sky. The family argued about what itcould be. Judy's brother-in-law thought it was a helicopter going to the Galveston airport.But Judy was not sure. Finally, after the light stayed with them for several miles, shepulled the car over to the side of the road near a pasture. She got out and walked to theback of the car.At that point, she and her family simultaneously lost time. It was as if everyone were put insuspended animation. When Judy got back into the car, she was thirsty and nauseous. Shecomplained to her family that she did not feel well, but no one was aware there was losttime until they arrived home later than expected. Waiting for them were worried relativeswho had been baby sitting young children.After that night, Judy suffered from terrible headaches and anxiety. In 1978, sheunderwent her first hypnosis session with a medical doctor. That session brought out partof her suppressed experience, but not all of it.Sometime after that hypnosis session, she recalled a strange face, drew it and mailed thesketch to Leo Sprinkle, Ph.D., then Director of Counseling and Testing at the University ofWyoming in Laramie. He was one of the few professionals at the time trying to helppeople who had encountered UFOs and experienced missing time. Dr. Sprinkle showed mea copy of the sketch."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Praying mantis-shaped face with \"cat eyes\" was sketched by Judy Doratyfor Leo Sprinkle, Ph.D., received by mail on September 24, 1979.Over a period of two months in early 1980, I spoke with Judy by long distance phone calls.I explained that I had listened to the first hypnosis session in which she saw an animaltaken up in a pale, yellow beam of light. I said her experience might help me in mydocumentary film, A Strange Harvest, which I was producing for KMGH-TV in Denver,then a CBS affiliate. I suggested that hypnosis with Dr. Leo Sprinkle might bring out moredetails of her experience, relieve some of her pent-up anxieties and reduce her headaches.She welcomed the idea to work with Dr. Sprinkle, but she was extremely nervous aboutany publicity She did not want me to reveal her married name or where she lived. She wasalso afraid to travel. So, I had to get Dr. Sprinkle, myself and a film cameraman to Judy.Finally, on March 13, 1980, we all met in a southwestern city. Judy was a short womanwith dark hair and very large, brown eyes. I thought of a wounded deer when I first sawher.Television colleagues had helped me find a room where we could work uninterrupted. Itwas quiet and Judy had a reclining chair to lie on. My cameraman, Richard Lerner, and Iset lights up while Leo talked quietly with Judy. On the airplane flight, Leo told me that inthe first hypnosis transcript, he thought there was significance in Judy's statement that shesaw both outside and inside the light, as if she were in two places at once. He felt thatexploring the outside and inside perspectives might move her further into the repressed1973 experience.As we finished lighting the room, Judy wanted to smoke a cigarette. I walked with her tothe bathroom. It was my first chance to talk with her alone.\"Judy, Dr. Sprinkle has asked us not to film during his relaxation work withyou. I hope that makes you feel better when we get started. We're ready to gowhenever you are.\"She paused and picked some tobacco from the end of her tongue with herthumb and third finger, the cigarette held in between. She looked at the floor,then quickly back at me. Her dark eyes were moist.\"I just want to know what happened to me. Sometimes when I'm washingdishes or working around the house, I remember something aboutcontamination, medical, lives will be lost. I don't know. Sometimes my handsshake, it bothers me so much.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"\"Do you still have dreams or nightmares?\"\"Yes, not as much as I used to. But I still have the headaches.\"\"Dr. Sprinkle says that when people relive their repressed experiences underhypnosis it helps. Like lancing a boil.\"Judy smiled nervously. \"Sometimes I'm not sure I want to know.\"Judy Doraty was a good hypnosis subject, who relaxed easily. Soon, we were filming. Atfirst the material was a repeat of the first tantalizing hypnosis session in 1978 when Judysaw a pale beam of light that contained a small brown and white animal. Leo went backand forth in time, taking Judy deeper and deeper into relaxation, helping her to explore hersense that she was both outside and inside the light. As he did, she finally began to have amore complete recall of that late evening drive in May 1973 outside Houston, Texas.Complete Transcript of March 13, 1980, Hypnosis Sessionwith Judy Doraty for my KMGH-TV documentary special, A Strange Harvest,which was broadcast for the first time on May 25, 1980.
