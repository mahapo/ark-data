Recently, aperson has come forward with some intriguing photos of a crop circle that hasappeared on 2nd of June 07 on the outskirts of Ptuj, Slovenia. I believe I havenot yet seen a photo of a circle with a bird nest full of eggs, unharmed, ofcourse.I think it is a special photo so I felt like I needed to show it to somebody withextensive knowledge and the first person I could think of is you.You can take a look at the picture in my picasa album, here:http://picasaweb.google.com/reptile256/ItniKrogPriPtujuThe circle itself is 100 meters in diameter and the line connecting the twocircles is oriented east-west. In one circle, the wheat is laid down clockwiseand in the other it's the opposite, as my readers have reported. The aerialphoto can be found here: http://24ur.com/naslovnica/ekskluziv/zanimivosti/20070603_3099071.phpBest regards,Omer, from Slovenia\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Aerial of 320-foot-diameter (100 meters) crop formation reported on June 2, 2007,in Ptuj, Slovenia.
