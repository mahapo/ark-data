It’s the fastest, large rotating objectin the solar system.\" - Michael E. Brown, Ph.D., Cal TechClick for Earthfiles Podcast March 30, 2007 Pasadena, California - For the first time in astronomical history, a huge,bizarre rock beyond Neptune has been linked to other orbiting bodies out there. Some howthe big rock called 2003 EL61, which is almost the size of Pluto, got into orbit out in theKuiper Belt where most every other object is made of ice. Not only is this huge rockyobject there, it is the only object in our solar system shaped like an American football andtumbling long end-over-end every four hours.Computer-generated image of 2003 EL61,courtesy Michael E.

The ice and rock objects in the Kuiper Beltcircle the sun in stable orbits with periods of about 300 years. The firstdiscovery of a Kuiper Belt object was not until 1992. ]"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Kuiper Belt and dwarf planets, now including Pluto, orbit at the edgeof our solar system beyond Neptune. The solar system and Kuiper Belt are embeddedinside the icy Oort Cloud left over from the creation of the solar system. Graphic byNASA/JPL.Where did the bizarre, nearly planet-sized rock in the Kuiper Belt come from? And whatcaused it to be the fastest spinning object orbiting the sun? Planetary astronomer MichaelBrown, Ph.D., at Cal Tech, says he has discovered the “smoking gun.” In the March 15,2007, Nature journal, Dr. Brown describes finding icy satellites in the EL61 region thathave surface properties nearly identical to those of 2003 EL61. This is the first “family” ofKuiper Belt objects ever discovered and imply all came from one, gigantic impact longago.The big spinning rock has never been given a real name. It’s only referred to as 2003 – theyear it was discovered – and EL 61, which is from an astronomical code list. Why hasn’t2003 EL61 been given a proper name yet? I talked about all this with Prof. Brown,well-known for his surveys of distant objects in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune andPluto. Dr. Brown was named one of Time magazine’s \"100 Most Influential People of2006.\" In fact, it is one of Dr. Brown’s discoveries that demoted Pluto from being the 9thplanet to being only one of many “dwarf planets.” The largest dwarf planet is Eris (2003UB 313), second in size is Pluto and the third largest dwarf planet is 2003 EL61.Eris (2003 UB313) is inside the circles. The three images were taken 1.5 hours aparton the night of October 21, 2003.The planet moved very slowly across the sky over the course of three hoursand that is how it was discovered.

Brown, Ph.D., Professor of PlanetaryAstronomy, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California.Michael E. Brown, Ph. D., Professor of Planetary Astronomy, California Institute ofTechnology, Pasadena, California: “This is one of the biggest surprises. We had alwaysassumed that everything we see out there is essentially half ice and half rock. We havefound some things that seem to be almost all ice and no rock. So, to find this object andrealize it’s almost entirely rock, that was a big surprise to us. The strange part about it is ifyou look at the surface, it is incredibly bright and shiny and icy and you don’t see anythingbut ice on the surface. So, it must be a very thin frosting of ice with all rocks underneath.One of the first ideas that someone came up with initially just throwing out thoughts abouthow this could be: maybe this actually came from the asteroid belt closer to the sun andsomehow got tossed out. But the funny thing is that this one object is bigger than the entireasteroid belt put together. You could stuff the entire asteroid belt inside this one object.All the things we learned about this as time went on just made it stranger and stranger. Thefirst thing we realized is that it gets brighter and darker with a 2-hour period and werealized that’s because it’s tumbling end-over-end with a 4-hour period. We see the smallend and then the big end and then the small end and big end over the course of four hours.This thing is shaped almost like a football, except if you took a football and let some airour out it and then you stepped on it – it’s shaped more like that. The long dimension isabout the size of Pluto, so it’s a pretty big football. The short dimension is about half thatsize.When we first found this, we were very surprised. We didn’t expect to find anything sostrangely shaped and so rapidly rotating. It’s the fastest, large rotating object in the solarsystem. All of these things point to something very strange having gone on in the past.IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY THERE WAS SOME BIG EVENT THAT AFFECTEDTHE ATMOSPHERE ON MARS, THE MOON, THE WHOLE SOLAR SYSTEM ANDMIGHT HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING THE STRANGE 2003 EL 61?There were many large bodies in the asteroid belt, other asteroids that collided with eachother, collided with planets – things like the size of Mars that hit the Earth that lead to themoon being spun off the Earth. Those sorts of things have been well known in the innerparts of the solar system. We also know that in the outer part of the solar system, we cantell that collisions between Kuiper Belt objects must have been important. They appear tohave been grinding down the objects to smaller and smaller sizes. But we had no directevidence, we had no smoking gun that this had ever happened until this EL61 object.The first idea we really clung on to about how this object got to be the shape and rotationis that perhaps it had been larger in the past and had been hit very hard by another verylarge object with a sort of glancing blow. That glancing blow would have led it to spin andthe spin itself would have pulled it out into the shape like the football. The same glancingblow could also have knocked off a lot of the ice that would have been around. We think itstarted out as a large Pluto-sized Kuiper Belt object and hit something that was maybe60% of its size at a tremendous speed, many hundreds of miles an hour, slamming into itand that gave it the energy – not to move large distances, but to remove all the ice, tomake it spin, and to give it that crazy shape.The interesting thing we learned is that once we had the idea that this thing had been hit,most people did not believe the idea. You could easily calculate the probability that such alarge thing could hit another large thing and you get something like there is 1 chance out of10 million that this would happen. Those are pretty low odds. So, most people sort ofdiscarded that hypothesis. 2003 EL61 Has An Icy Family"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"2003 EL 61 is the dark object at center. Two of its icy satelliteswere imaged here by the Keck Observatory's laser guide star adaptive opticson June 30, 2005. Image courtesy Michael E. Brown, Ph.D., Cal Tech.But the big piece of new data that we just came up with is that we actually found the otherpieces that used to be part of 2003 EL61. We found a family of ice Kuiper Belt objectsthat are pure ice. We have El 61, which is almost pure rock, and these new objects whichare almost pure ice that are in orbits very closely related to the original 2003 EL 61 orbit.So this is definitely the smoking gun that these objects had really once all been part of thesame object.So, now that we know this impact happened, we can now watch where these objects havegone since the impact. Since the impact occurred, most of the objects have stayed more orless in the same area that it happened. EL 61 itself – the big, rapidly rotating body - hasmoved slightly. The reason it has moved slightly is because of many, many long-term,long-range gravitational interactions with Neptune. 2003 EL61 Could Become \"Yard Sprinkler\" CometEL61 is sort of half way through its evolution. When it gets to the end stage, it willactually encounter Neptune. Once it encounters Neptune, it will be on a one-way journeyinto Jupiter. Then Jupiter is sort of the goal keeper of the inner solar system. If Jupiter let’sEL61 go by, it becomes a comet. If Jupiter does not let it go by, it just flings it out of thesolar system entirely. So, EL61 itself will go down this path and has the potential tobecome a spectacularly bright comet.WOULD IT CONTINUE TO HAVE ITS FOOTBALL SHAPE AND BE MOVING ENDOVER END AS IT BECAME A COMET FLUNG BY JUPITER?It would! It would be an interesting sight because you would get these jets coming off of itlike a yard sprinkler – imagine a yard sprinkler moving incredibly quickly. You’d get thesevariable jets going in different directions. I sort of vaguely calculated that it would be asbright as the full moon for decades at a time. It would be a pretty spectacular sight, ifyou’re willing to wait a billion years for when it happens.SO YOU THINK IN ONE BILLION YEARS, IT MIGHT TURN INTO THISEND-OVER-END COMET?That’s right.WHY WOULD IT TAKE A BILLION YEARS?It’s very slowly evolving and it’s already been doing it for 4.5 billion years. It has a littlebit more to go before it gets to encounter Neptune. That’s because it only gets a tiny littletug from Neptune every time it goes around the sun and you have to add up those tiny tugsbefore you have enough of an effect to get close enough to really change your orbitdramatically.IF YOU ADD THE ICY PIECES THAT YOU HAVE FOUND, PLUS THE BIG, ROCKYFOOTBALL, AND YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER, THAT WOULD BE LARGER THANPLUTO?No, it’s about two-thirds the size of Pluto. It’s not quite as large as Pluto."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Why Doesn't 2003 EL 61 Have A Proper Name?WHEN IS IT GOING TO GET A NAME?That is an excellent question. I don’t know the answer to that. We submitted a name sixmonths ago now to the International Astronomical Union and the IAU has not said a word.So, we don’t know.AND YOU CAN’T TALK ABOUT THE NAME YOU’VE SUBMITTED?I can at least tell you that the name we submitted is from Hawaiian mythology. It’s a namefor the main object, the two moons that go around it and for the entire family (of icyobjects) – they all go together. So, it’s a nice combination. We hope they accept it. Butthey have been a little bit slow.BUT WHY WOULDN’T THEY JUST NAME THIS LARGE OBJECT?It’s a sordid story. It’s because this is the object that most people don’t remember, luckily,but 2.5 years ago when we first announced the existence of the large object, Eris – the onebigger than Pluto - the day before, another group had announced the existence of EL61.We thought they had legitimately discovered it, so we supported their discovery and themas the discoverers, even though we had discovered it ourselves earlier and we had notannounced the discovery. The way science works – and I think rightly so – whoeverannounces the discovery first is the one who officially gets to be the discoverer.But we learned later that the other group had not actually discovered it. They had onlydiscovered our website that told where it was and their claims have been essentiallyfraudulent, as far as we can tell.However, the IAU has not decided who to side with yet at this point. So, theannouncement of the name will tell you who they believe.DO YOU EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN ANY TIME THIS YEAR?I have zero idea.Dwarf Planet Bigger Than PlutoBEYOND PLUTO NOW, WHAT IS THE LARGEST OBJECT IN THE SOLAR SYSTEMBEYOND NEPTUNE?That’s still Eris. Eris is the one we discovered in 2003 and is the one that caused poorPluto to get demoted.IT IS HOW MUCH BIGGER THAN PLUTO?It’s not much bigger – only about 5% bigger than Pluto. And it’s about 25% more massivethan Pluto. So, it’s clearly heavier, but just barely bigger.IS IT ALL ICE? OR ICE AND ROCK?It’s like Pluto – it’s about half ice and half rock.IS ERIS DEFINED AS A PLANET OR KUIPER BELT OBJECT?Definitely Kuiper Belt object. The current definition puts both Pluto and Eris as dwarfplanets and I think that’s a very good place for them. Dwarf planets, which are members ofthe Kuiper Belt.WHAT IS THE MAIN DISTINCTION NOW BETWEEN A DWARF PLANET ANDONE OF THE MAIN PLANETS?Just purely size and whether you reside in one of these belts – things in the asteroid belt,things in the Kuiper Belt – are not legitimate planets. Large objects that are outside thosebelts are planets.WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON NOW THAT EXCITES YOU THE MOST?We’re looking for more of these very distant, very large objects and the hope is we’ve justhit the tip of the iceberg and we’ll continue to find more.YOU THINK THERE MIGHT BE OTHER OBJECTS IN THE KUIPER BELT ANDBEYOND AS LARGE OR LARGER THAN PLUTO?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Not in the Kuiper Belt, but definitely beyond the Kuiper Belt. So, that’s where we arelooking now.YOU WANT TO TRY TO FIND THEM BECAUSE?For two big reasons: first, by finding these things that are left over from the creation of thesolar system, we are learning about what was there back when the solar system formedand where it was.Second, the big ones are the ones we can study in most detail, so we are learning moreabout the processes that are involved in making a large, icy planet-sized thing and whathappens geologically.” Background Behind Conflict Over 2003 EL 61Four years ago, Dr. Brown and his team had been observing the strange object for sixmonths, trying to better understand EL61’s odd shape and rotation before announcing theirfind. Then suddenly, astronomers at the Sierra Nevada Observatory in Spain, lead by JoseLuis Ortiz Moreno, claimed EL61 was their discovery.However, further investigation showed that a website containing archives of where theBrown team telescopes had been pointed while tracking 2003 EL61 had been accessedeight times in the three days preceding Ortiz Moreno’s announcement. Further, computerswith IP addresses were traced back to the website of the Institute of Astrophysics inAndalusia, Spain, where Ortiz Moreno works. That was a week after Prof. Brown hadpublished an abstract for an upcoming conference at which he had planned to announcethe discovery of 2003 EL61. Dr. Brown’s abstract referred to 2003 EL61 by a code whichwas the same code used in the online telescope logs. It was learned that the Andalusiacomputers had accessed those telescope logs containing that code directly, instead ofthrough Dr. Brown’s research home page.When Ortiz Moreno was asked about his online activity, Ortiz emailed back to Dr. Brownthat the Cal Tech professor was \"hiding objects\" and that \"the only reason why we are nowexchanging e-mail is because you did not report your object.\"As Dr. Brown has pointed out, such an accusation contradicts the accepted scientificpractice of analyzing one's research until there is some confidence that data is accurateand then submitting for peer review prior to any public announcement.Although the matter has not yet been settled, Prof. Brown has petitioned the InternationalAstronomical Union to credit his team rather than Ortiz Moreno as the discoverers of 2003EL61. At least one authority within the IAU has indicated Brown's team will end up beingrecognized as the discoverers. Saturn's Amazing PolesAs if our solar system could not be more strange, Saturn continues to amaze everyone. Itwas only a few months ago that the Cassini spacecraft photographed the ringed planet’sSouth Pole, which looks like a huge eye staring out into space.South Pole Hurricane \"Eye\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"In the fall of 2006, NASA's Cassini spacecraft now orbiting Saturn flew directly over the South Poleof the ringed giant. NASA reports: \"Cassini found a spectacular massive swirling storm system with awell developed eye-wall, similar to a hurricane here on Earth.

North Pole Hexagon\"This is a very strange feature, lying in a precise geometric fashionwith six nearly equally straight sides. We've never seen anything like this on anyother planet.

Yet, there itis!\"Kevin Baines, Ph.D., Atmospheric Physicist, Cassini’s Visual and Infrared MappingSpectrometer Team, NASA’s Jet Propulsion LabIn the past six months, for the first time since Voyager’s flybys of Saturn in the early1980s, Saturn’s North Pole has been clearly seen in both visual and infrared spectrometry.There in all its baffling glory is a 6-sided hexagon nearly 15,000 miles across and 60 milesdeep, apparently created by North Polar winds that have been blowing in the hexagonalshape for at least two decades. Saturn’s North Pole hexagon is so big that nearly fourplanet Earths could fit inside. \"Once we understand its dynamical nature, this long-lived,deep-seated polar hexagon may give us a clue to the true rotation rate of the deepatmosphere and perhaps the interior,\" said Dr. Baines.This nighttime view of Saturn's north pole show s a bizarresix-sided hexagon feature encircling the entire north pole.

Image credit: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona.NASA reports: \"NASA's Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft imaged the feature over two decadesago. The fact that it has appeared in Cassini images indicates that it is a long-lived feature.A second hexagon, significantly darker than the brighter historical feature, is also visible inthe Cassini pictures. The spacecraft's visual and infrared mapping spectrometer is the firstinstrument to capture the entire hexagon feature in one image.\"The hexagon is similar to Earth's polar vortex, which has winds blowing in a circularpattern around the polar region. On Saturn, the vortex has a hexagonal rather than circularshape. The hexagon is nearly 25,000 kilometers (15,000 miles) across. Nearly four Earthscould fit inside it.\"The new images taken in thermal-infrared light show the hexagon extends much deeperdown into the atmosphere than previously expected, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) belowthe cloud tops. A system of clouds lies within the hexagon. The clouds appear to bewhipping around the hexagon like cars on a racetrack.\"'It's amazing to see such striking differences on opposite ends of Saturn's poles,'\" said BobBrown, team leader of the Cassini visual and infrared mapping spectrometer, University ofArizona, Tucson. 'At the south pole we have what appears to be a hurricane with a gianteye, and at the north pole of Saturn we have this geometric feature, which is completelydifferent.'\"The Saturn north pole hexagon has not been visible to Cassini's visual cameras, becauseit's winter in that area, so the hexagon is under the cover of the long polar night, whichlasts about 15 years. The infrared mapping spectrometer can image Saturn in both daytimeand nighttime conditions and see deep inside. It imaged the feature with thermalwavelengths near 5 microns (seven times the wavelength visible to the human eye) duringa 12-day period beginning on Oct. 30, 2006. As winter wanes over the next two years, thefeature may become visible to the visual cameras.\"Based on the new images and more information on the depth of the feature, scientiststhink it is not linked to Saturn's radio emissions or to auroral activity, as oncecontemplated, even though Saturn's northern aurora lies nearly overhead. The hexagonappears to have remained fixed with Saturn's rotation rate and axis since first glimpsed byVoyager 26 years ago. The actual rotation rate of Saturn is still uncertain.\" As Nobel Prize winning physicist, Richard Feynman once said: \"Not only is the universestranger than you imagine, it is stranger than you can imagine!\"More Information:For further information about astronomical discoveries, please see reports below in theEarthfiles Archives:• 01/13/2007 -- Confusing Sun: Will Solar Cycle 24 Be Most Intense On Record?• 01/07/2007 -- Universe's Mysterious Dark Matter - First 3-D Map• 01/06/2007 -- Liquid Methane Lakes on Saturn's Titan Moon• 12/19/2006 -- First Stars - Or First Black Holes - in Universe?• 12/07/2006 -- Earth Headed for Warmest Period in 55 Million Years?• 12/01/2006 -- Deep Impact and Stardust: Are Comets Made of the Same Stuff?• 11/27/2006 -- Namibia Telescopes Find First \"Gamma Clock\" in Milky Way Galaxy• 11/09/2006 -- Outer Space Sunshade to Cool Earth in Global Warming?• 10/23/2006 -- One, Maybe Two, More Mysterious Radio Bursts from Galactic Center• 09/05/2006 -- Part 2: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet?• 08/23/2006 -- Solar Cycle 24 - Headed for Intense X Flares by 2010-2012?• 08/19/2006 -- Red Rain Cells of Kerala, India - Still No Definite DNA• 06/15/2006 -- \"Extraterrestrial Life\" in Red Rain of Kerala, India?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"• 05/19/2006 -- Simple \"Binocular\" Telescope Finds Another Planet Beyond Solar System• 04/22/2006 -- Cassiopeia A Is Not Dying Peacefully.
