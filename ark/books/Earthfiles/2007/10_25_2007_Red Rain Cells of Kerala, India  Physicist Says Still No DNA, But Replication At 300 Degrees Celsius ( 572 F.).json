There is no known organism on Earththat can grow and multiply at this temperature actually. No DNA has been found either.”- Godfrey Louis, Ph.D., Prof. of Physics, Kochin University, Kerala, IndiaUpdated photos on November 5, 2007 / October 25, 2007 Cochin, Kerala, India - Ayear and a half ago the April 4, 2006, journal Astrophysics and Space Science had a reportentitled “The Red Rain Phenomenon of Kerala and Its Possible Extraterrestrial Origin.”Kerala is a state at the southwestern tip of India on the Malabar Coast.South of Bombay, the state of Kerala, India, is in the southwestern tipof the country bordered on the west by the Arabian Sea. Its capital isThiruvananthapuram. Map © by maps ofindia.co m.Six years ago in July to September 2001, several red-colored rains fell over Kerala. Peoplesaid they heard a loud boom. Then red rain fell and stained white T-shirts. Residentswondered what was happening? News of the red rain mystery reached Dr. Godfrey Louis,a Professor of Pure and Applied Physics at Mahatma Gandhi University. He collectedmany test tubes full of the red-colored rain water and put some of the odd liquid under amicroscope.He told me in an interview last year that when he first saw the red rain magnified, he wasstruck by the beautiful rust color of what seemed to be living cells. The cell diametersaveraged 10 microns, a little bigger than a human blood cell, which is about 7 microns.Red adult \"mother\" cells and clear, or white, \"daughter\" cells in Kerala red rain water,magnified under a microscope by a power of 1000.

Photomicrograph courtesy Wikipedia.Over several months, Dr. Louis began experimenting with different temperatures to see ifthe cells would respond. As the temperature rose, he saw more activity. Eventually he gotup to 300 degrees Celsius, which is 572 degrees Fahrenheit. He also increased the pressureto 300 pounds per square centimeter. It is assumed that normal Earth life would die at sucha high temperature and pressure. But the red-walled cells in the Kerala rain water seemedto thrive.During his experimentation with temperatures and pressures, Dr. Louis studied the cellsunder a microscope. As he watched,the cells produced smaller cells internally that werecolorless, or whitish. He began calling those new, little cells “daughters” of the original“mother” cells. Once he counted as many as fifteen daughter cells bud inside one of theadult “mother cells.” As the daughter cells grew, their cell walls also became red andeventually, the daughter cells erupted through the wall of the mother cell. This is clearly aprocess of replication. The budding is what provoked some biologist to say the red raincells must be a form of yeast, since yeast cells also replicate by budding. But yeast cellshave DNA, as all normal Earth biology has. On Earth, replication of cells requires thepresence of DNA. But Dr. Louis could not find DNA.So, he sent red rain water to scientists at Cornell University in the United States forisotopic ratio studies of the elemental composition of the red rain water. Elementsconfirmed so far are hydrogen, silicon, oxygen, carbon, and aluminum. No phosphorouswas confirmed, which would be present if Earth DNA were present.Prof. Louis also sent red rain cell water to Cardiff University’s Center for Astrobiology inWales, directed by now-retired Prof. Emeritus, Chandra Wickramasinghe to see if DNAcould be confirmed – but to date, DNA has not been confirmed.

I talked with him recentlyabout his ongoing red rain cell research, which he hopes to publish in the next few months.I learned to my surprise that there have been three red rains, all with cells that replicate at300 degrees Celsius (572 degrees F.), but without any known DNA for replication as weknow in all other Earth life.Interview:Dr. Godfrey Louis, Ph.D., Professor, Department of Physics, Cochin University ofScience and Technology (formerly School of Pure & Applied Physics, MahatmaGandhi University), Kochi, Kerala, India:"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Godfrey Louis, Ph.D., holding vial of red rain water.Photo courtesy Prof. Godfrey Louis.“This organism is operating comfortably at such a high temperature.

This is what we find. They (Cardiff University) were notable to amplify DNA so nobody has detected DNA in this.HOW WOULD THEY (RED RAIN CELLS) REPLICATE AND KEEP REPRODUCINGAND SPLITTING WITHOUT DNA?Yes, that is a whole interesting question. Red Rain Has Fallen On Keralain 2001, 2006 and 2007This year when we collected the red rain water, we have exactly the same in red rain cells.This was another incident of red rain and we got the samples. It's the same cells. Samething happened last year in 2006. So now we have three different red rain samples.WHAT MONTH WAS THAT?That was in August 2007.ONLY TWO MONTHS AGO?Ye s .WHEN YOU TAKE THE AUGUST 2007 RED RAIN WATER AND COMPARE IT TOTHE 2006 AND 2001 RED RAIN WATER, HOW DO THEY COMPARE?They are the same, the same kind of cells have fallen in both these cases.

LOUIS, WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IT HAS BEEN SIX YEARS SINCE THEFIRST RED RAIN IN KERALA, INDIA. THE RED RAIN HAS BEEN STUDIED BYYOUR LABORATORY, BY PROF. WICKRAMASINGHE’S LABORATORY BEFOREHE RETIRED AT CARDIFF UNIVERSITY. WHY IS IT THAT AS WE SPEAK IN"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"OCTOBER OF 2007 THAT NO ONE HAS IDENTIFIED WHAT THE CELLS AREMADE OUT OF?This is because there is a reluctance among many to accept results like this because itsounds like fiction. So in announcing the absence of DNA, it is difficult for a scientist toannounce there is no DNA in the cells because it is so outrageous to say that. It deviatesfar from what we know about life. So, it is a drastic difference what we find. There isalways hesitation for any scientist to do this. So, it takes time.WHAT ABOUT THAT RED COLOR? I THOUGHT CARDIFF UNIVERSITY WASGOING TO TRY TO DO SOME SORT OF ENERGY DISPERSIVE SPECTROSCOPYTO SEE IF THEY COULD IDENTIFY THAT RED SUBSTANCE.The red rain substance has not been identified. It is a difficult task. We have to find themethods to extract chemicals from this and separate the chemicals because, as I saidearlier, the molecular composition is totally unknown. So, the conventional techniquesmight not work. For example, when we tried to extract the DNA, there is no DNA comingout. That particular (red) pigment, we don’t know that. We have to identify it.SO, EVEN THOUGH YOU’VE GOT A CARBON, OXYGEN, NITROGEN AND SOMETRACE ELEMENTS BROKEN DOWN, NONE OF THOSE WOULD EXPLAIN THERED COLOR?We are not able to identify the red pigment out of it (can’t extract red pigment from raincells).DO THE CELLS IN THE VIALS OF WATER THAT YOU HAVE KEEPREPRODUCING AND SPLITTING?They don’t do that in the water (test tubes) because it requires heat to multiply it. Notwhen you keep them at ordinary room temperature in water. Then they are stable.DOES THAT IMPLY TO YOU AS A SCIENTIST, THAT WHATEVER THE ORIGIN OFTHE RED RAIN WATER IS, IT IS COMING FROM SOME SORT OF SURFACE THATMUST BE HOT IF THIS IS IN FACT A FORM OF LIFE THAT REPLICATES ONLY INTHE PRESENCE OF HEAT?It might not be the surface. It can be the interior of comets because the comet – eventhough it’s a very cold object – it can be warm at the core. So far, no one has discoveredany life form without DNA.” Efforts to Retrieve DNA from Red Rain CellsWhen I visited the Cardiff University lab with Prof. Chandra Wickramasinghe in August2006, his lab assistant, Nori, said he was not happy with what he had been able to do withthe red rain cell walls. Nori said they were extraordinarily thick and stiff. He did not feelhe had actually been able to penetrate the cell walls the way he needed to extract materialto look for DNA.Prof. Wickramasinghe told me he thought that was true. He said: “When I looked at someof the electron microscope pictures and optical microscope pictures of these broken cells,there was evidence of broken cell walls and fragments of cells. But there was also verylittle evidence of anything that came out of those cells. I think that’s the bottom line. Wehave to identify something that came out of the cells as being the DNA that we try toamplify. But so far that still hasn’t happened to everyone’s satisfaction.\" Is Red Rain from Cometary Debris Orbiting Earth?Both Prof. Louis and Prof. Chandra Wickramasinghe hypothesize that the red rain cellshave been coming from orbiting cometary debris. But why cometary debris wouldrepeatedly fall in 2001, 2006 and 2007 in the state of Kerala at the southern most tip ofIndia has not been explained.Prof. Louis told me he strongly feels the red rain cells are from an outer space source.“The cells are not decaying even when you keep the rain water for years (2001 to 2007 issix years). The cells can still be cultured – and the culturing is a definite clue that these arenot earthly organisms because they culture at such high temperatures – 300 degreesCelsius, which is 572 degrees Fahrenheit.”"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Professor Emeritus Chandra Wickramasinghe,Director, Center for Astrobiology, Cardiff UniversityProf. Wickramasinghe told me, “I think other places on the Earth also would have beenreceiving these red rain cells. But it would not be noticed. If you think a belt of latitudethat goes around the Earth where Kerala is, then east of Kerala is the Indian Ocean all theway to the Sahara. And going West, you have mountains. So, if this red rain fell over ahuge strip of the Earth's surface going all the way, or half the way, around the world,Kerala might have been the only place with a population able to detect it.\"But why the latitude of Kerala, which is about 10 degrees north of the equator? TheEarth’s latitude at Kerala seems to be implicated in some way and that might be related insome way to where the comet’s stream intersects the Earth.\"There is a mystery of almost unparalleled proportions in terms of any terrestrial biologicalcycle. If you can think of any Earth-bound cycle that has a 5-year period, in yeast cellsthat is very difficult to come up with. To me, that is a clear indication that this is drivenfrom outside.\"But on the existence of DNA, there still remains a considerable uncertainty. I would liketo think that wherever the cells came from – whether from the Earth or from space – thatthey had DNA, simply because that is the kind of life that I’m used to thinking of – that alllife on Earth is based on DNA. So, it would be a great surprise if there were red biologicalcells that did not contain DNA.\"But the arguments of Godfrey Louis, I think, are quite important to explore. And to thisday, we haven’t had definitive evidence of DNA from the tests that were done by Nori.There were fluorescence tests that were used, very standard tests (with DAPI), and theydo show a positive for DNA. But it’s well known that these could be false positives fromcontamination. There is really no 100% detection of DNA, based on fluorescence.”More Information:For further reports about red rain cells, please see other reports below in the EarthfilesArchive:• 08/19/2006 — Red Rain Cells of Kerala, India - Still No Definite DNA• 06/15/2006 — \"Extraterrestrial Life\" in Red Rain of Kerala, India?Websites:Godfrey Louis, Ph.D.: http://education.vsnl.com/godfrey/Cardiff University Centre for Astrobiology: http://www.astrobiology.cf.ac.uk/index.html Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
