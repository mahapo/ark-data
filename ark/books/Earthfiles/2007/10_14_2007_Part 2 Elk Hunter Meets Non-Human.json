Transcript of Interview with Carl Higdon,November 17, 1974CH I don't know what they mean by \"super blood.\" I guess it is better thannormal.LS Right!CH I haven't got hold of the doctor yet. I want to find out for sure. He saidthere were no spots whatsoever on my lungs.LS This was Dr. Tongca? There had been spots earlier?CH Yes, in 1970. In 1958, they put me in the hospital and said I had TB.Then they found out it came out negative. Nothing to it. They told me to get anx-ray every six months. So when I was in Kimball, I was getting x-ray everysix months. Up to 1970, there were still spots.LS Did they say what they were?CH Scar tissue. The last x-rays I got were in 1971. When did we go to Byers?Maybe it was 1970 or 1971, the last x-rays I got. I still had spots on my lungs"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"then, but there is none on it now.LS Now, after this last x-ray, nothing?MH I didn't talk to him yet. He didn't say there was not any. He just saidwhen I asked about if he could be anemic, he just said his blood is better thannormal and he said his chest x-rays were OK.CH The first thing they say, if they see spots, they'll ask you about them.MH They will start testing right away.LS Right!MH Anyway, the hospital is being sued right now because they would notadmit a drunk. The doctor has been kind of indisposed for the last couple ofdays.LS Did Roy Flemming tell you that he called me? Did Rick Kenyon tell youthat a guy called me who said he was Roy Flemming? (Carbon CountySheriff's Deputy involved in search for Carl Higdon.)CH I was working the last three days and he did not say anything about it.LS Well, a man said that his name was Roy Flemming. He said, \"Do youknow who I am?\" I said, \"Yes, because I talked with Carl Higdon.\" He told methat his supervisors had talked with him. One man said that he was interestedin the case and wanted to know if it would be possible to get some kind ofcopy of the recording. I said I had no objections if Rick Kenyon and CarlHigdon had no objections. I said, however, that I felt that they should have asay in it. He said that he had been interested in the case. Also, he said, \"It's notthat I don't believe him. But there is some question about what actually wenton.\" Then I said, \"Carl has a copy of the recording, also.\" He said, \"Oh, is thatright?\" Then he did not say much more. And I haven't heard from him anymore.CH: I think it is this old boy right here. (Showing a letter written to CarlHigdon from LeVesque, not identified).LS: UFO Newsletter, Pyramid. I'm familiar with those publications. So, itcould be that he is supplying information for these groups. Although if it is thesame person, I don't like the idea of someone giving a name.CH: Yeah.LS: It is interesting.RK: Whoever he was, he is well enough versed to know that I was involvedand Leo was involved.CH: Well, I don't know why Roy would call.RK: Roy would drive up to my house.CH: I talked to Roy here one evening. I told him just as quick as I got all thisstuff together that I would give it to him. That has been two weeks ago. Hewas welcome to read everything that went on - the tapes, too.MH: If they ever call again like that, just tell them they can come down to thehouse and listen to them. If that is them, OK. If not...?RK: I'd have them meet me in a certain place. Hypnosis of Carl Higdon by Leo Sprinkle, Ph.D.[ Leo Sprinkle gave hypnotic suggestions to Carl Higdon for regression to theUFO experience and review of events.]CH: I see the elk in the clearing. I raised the gun to shoot. I could see thebullet coming out of the gun. Walked down, bent over, picked up the bullet,steadied the gun in my right hand. When I heard the branch snap, I swung, putmy left hand back on the gun, holding the gun down."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"LS: Now you can remember what happened.This transcript in October 2007 was typed from the original November 17, 1974,onion skin, carbon copies of the hypnosis session with Carl Higdon, typed by secretariesfrom audiotape for then Leo Sprinkle, Ph.D., Director of Counseling and Testing, University ofWyoming, Laramie, Wyoming.

(Pause)7mm bullet that Carl Higdon saw drop straight down to theground about 50 feet from where Carl shot his rifle at an elk around4 p.m., October 25, 1974, 40 miles south of Rawllins, Wyoming, in theMedicine Bow National Forest. Original Polaroid photograph takenin November 1974 by Leo Sprinkle, Ph.D.LS: OK. So that helps explain what happened when you were picking up thebullet. Then at that time, did you...?CH: I did this at the time I was turning around.LS: While you were turning around. You had heard a sound?CH: I heard this sound. Then this man was standing up on the side of the hillby the trees ... shaded.LS: About how far away did he seem to be?CH: Oh, 50 or 70 feet. Really couldn't tell his facial features too good at thatpoint. He walked toward me. Then I could see that he wasn't one of our planet.Then the pills. He says, \"Are you hungry?\" I told him, \"Maybe a little.\" Hethrew a package of pills. I took one. He wanted to know if I wanted to go withthem. And I said, \"Might as well.\" The next thing we was inside thiscubicle-type of office. It was kind of transparent.LS: Could you see through it so you could see trees?CH: You could see trees through it. You could look down and see the ground.Then he pointed at this lever on the front, and then the next thing you could"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"see a ball below, like a basketball, where the ground was there before. Thenwe landed where the lights were bright.LS: Did it seem like the lights were bright all around, like during the day? Orat night?CH: It must be night because the lights were in a confined area. Like artificiallight, not sunlight. They only case out maybe 100 yards in a circle. Real bright,different colors. (Pause) Then there was a shield! (Raising his hand.)LS: A shield comes up?CH: Yeah, they're pushing it towards me. Then I'm behind the shield. Thenthey take it way.LS: Did they say what the shield was for?CH: No. Only one talked: Ausso.LS: Did you see anyone else beside him with the shield?CH: No. Just him. The shield just slides, kinda rolls. I told them, \"The lightshurt.\" The sun, our sun, burns them. I'm not what they want. They'll take meback. (Pause) Then, they kind of drifted me down, or beamed me down. I wasstanding flat-footed on the side of the hill when they left. Then, I slept androlled over the rocks to the ground. Then I got up and started walking downthe road.LS: And your rifle?CH: Rifle? I had it in my hand. I walked down the road. Seen the pickup.Passed the pickup. A mile or so down the road, I turned around and came backto the pickup. I heard a woman talking. I tried to talk to her on the radio andshe wouldn't answer. I kept trying and Roy Flemming (Carbon County Sheriff'sDeputy) got on the radio. We talked for a long time. They come and got me.(Pause)LS: OK. Can you recall anything else at that time that was unclear before?CH: The pickup just ... disappeared.LS: The pickup disappeared? When did that happen?Two-wheel drive pickup, which Carl Higdon drove up to the Medicine BowNational Forest on October 25, 1974, to go elk hunting.Photograph in 1974 by Leo Sprinkle, Ph.D.CH: Oh, when we got above the trees a little ways, then the pickupdisappeared.LS: So when the cubicle was up above the trees?CH: But I didn't see where they put it.LS: Did you see how it happened?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"CH: He (entity) just pointed his arm at the pickup, his right arm, and itdisappeared.LS: Did you look at the cubicle? Did you see anything else around thecubicle? You said you saw levers before.CH: Just a big star on the left-hand side of the levers, up a ways.LS: The star was similar to the star he had on his belt? And you said you sawsome letters on the levers? On the knobs of the levers, or on the sides?CH: On the side.LS: Can you look closely to see if you can focus on them? Can you see thoseletters?CH: Can't see them.LS: Can you see anything else beside the levers? How many levers can yousee?CH: Three.LS: And are there slots?CH: Up and down.LS: Can you estimate how long the slots were?CH: About six or eight inches on the first. About an inch shorter on the nextone. Then, about an inch and a half shorter on the last one. They're just smallerlevers as you go that way. I don't know what they're for.LS: OK. How long were the levers? Could you estimate that?CH: About six, four and two.LS: Inches?CH: Yeah.LS: Do they have a knob on them?CH: Knob on each one. Black, like a shifting knob on a pickup.LS: About that same size?CH: Graduated down to different sizes.LS: How big would you estimate the diameter of the first one?CH: About an inch and a half in diameter. The other one was about an inchand the other one was about a half-inch.LS: Did you see any of the knobs move?CH: Only the big one - down.LS: Can you see anything else around the lever? Were they on any type ofobject?CH:: Just a little square box, like kind of round over to the back and down tothe floor, but it is transparent, too. There's nothing coming off of it.LS: Could you estimate the size of the box? Or how high it was?CH: Well, I would say about two feet high. About a foot flat across the front.The back about five inches, towards the wall and curved down.LS: So it was wider at the base than it was at the top?CH: No. It was narrow at the base, about four inches wide from the wall out.Then it come up and it curved out to a flat surface about a foot to the front tothe three levers.LS: OK.

In the cage like a door.LS: A cage-like door? Bars or?CH: Cross pieces. Like a corral, only built all the way to the top.LS: You could see them (elk)? Do they seem to be moving? Or do they seemto be still?CH: Still. Like stuffed animals. Standing just like they were in the sameposition.LS: Were they in the same position in relation to each other - like when theywere in the clearing?CH: They are sideways to me now. They look just about the same.LS: OK. So you can tell there is a mirror on top of the right-hand corner ofthe cubicle? You can see the elk reflected in the mirror?CH: (Nodding and pause) Power. What powers the craft? All you could seewas kinda, not really daylight and not really dark. They power it by \"magneticforce\" - no sound.LS: This is what you were told?CH: Ausso said.LS: Ausso said what?CH: Powered by magnetic force.LS: Did he say anything about the pickup?CH: No.LS: When he moved the hand toward the pickup and the pickup disappearedwas there any sound?CH: No.LS: Did he talk to you any time about the rifle?CH: Primitive weapon.

How long was the shield? Wasthe shield between him and you?CH: Yes. I couldn't see him when the shield was there. It was about - oh, I amnot sure how big. It would be - well, with normal height, it would be about fourfeet and about eight feet high. It blocks out all vision. You can't see nothingexcept the shield.LS: What did the shield look like?CH: It looked like a wall coming toward me.LS: Did it look like it was made out of metal? Could you tell any texture?CH: Kinda glassy-like. You couldn't see through it. Like maybe slate, but itwas real glossy.LS: Glossy? Could you tell how thick it was?CH: No. I didn't get to see the side. It come from the front.LS: Could you estimate how long the shield was in front of you?CH: Oh, about four or five minutes.LS: During that time, was the helmet on your head?CH: No. We were standing up.LS: You were standing up - so you didn't have the bands around your arms orlegs?CH: No. We were out, we weren't in this craft.LS: You were outside the cubicle, outside the craft?CH: We were inside this big (sounded puzzled) - oh, I can't describe it - like atower.

It's not so bright here. There's otherpeople. Not them (entities), but people like us (humans). Three ... five -standing by the door. Going back.LS: Back in time? Back to see those people?CH: No. Back in the building.LS: OK, go back and see what you see.CH: It's dim. Then the shield. We go down a tube, like an elevator. Didn't seenobody. Then we're back outside, back in the craft.

Hejust kept talking. Nothing important, really, just small talk. Looking for birds,animals. They don't want nothing but animals.LS: Did he say what kind of animals they like?CH: No, just animals.LS: They want animals or food?CH: Food. Places to breed them on their planet.LS: Did he say anything else about their planet?CH: Fish.

According to size, I can't tell for sure.LS: Were you close enough to touch him?CH: No, can't touch him.LS: He wouldn't let that?CH: No.LS: How about when you were sitting in the chair? Did he seem closer then inthe craft?CH: Maybe 20 feet, according to the way the seats were, straight across. But(sounding puzzled) the cubicle ain't that big.LS: So it just seemed that way? Maybe later on you can draw a diagram orsketch of where the seats were in relation to one another.CH: Yeah. The \"force fields\" are around all of them and me. You can move,but can't reach out too far. Unless the \"force field\" expands, he said. That's theway they travel without helmets or any type of oxygen gear, through magneticforce.LS: So that they can move on our planet without the use of the helmet,because they can regulate the size of the \"force field\"?CH: They got oxygen inside the force field.LS: Did Ausso say that they use oxygen at the same level, at the same rate, ason this planet Earth?CH: He didn't say nothing about it, except that if our animals could live there,it seems like the oxygen would be about the same.LS: Did he say that they can move without walking?CH: Freely.LS: Is there some other way of transporting themselves?CH: No. They don't touch the ground.

No, he said, \"We move freelyanywhere we ant to go ... any WHERE we want to go.LS: Is this the way Ausso did when he was on the elevator? He would point?CH: I don't remember walking.

We walked back down the hall. The door opened and westepped on a platform and went down. We got down and walked throughanother hall to a door.

I seen the five people standing in the doorway,going in.LS: Going in?CH: Platform - must be a platform, or something, that opens the door. Whenyou land on the platform, or stop, then the door opens.

Then he said, \"You're not what we need. We'll take you back.\"LS: Was that when the pills?CH: The pills were in my shirt pocket. Went up towards the \"star\" on theleft-hand side and they stopped. They stayed there (sounded puzzled). Maybethere was a shelf - transparent or something.

(Carl rubbed neck and shoulder)OK. Just work on that and say now you are going to get past that event and thepain is going to be gone. In a few minutes, the pain will be gone. You'll be ableto ease that shoulder and that neck. You'll feel better than ever. So that if youever go through that experience again, you'll be able to do so withoutdiscomfort. You'll be able to ease that pain in the neck and shoulder andthere'll be no discomfort associated with that experience. But if there is anyfeeling, itt will be something that will remind you of the experience, reality ofit and the significance it has for you. There's no need to have the discomfortand you can let the feeling to away, just let it disappear. But if there is anysignificance to the discomfort, you can use it, you can use it to recall any otherfeelings or memories of the experience. Then you can recall it, describe it, andadd to the basic description of the event. OK. As you relax deeper and deeper,now mentally, just quickly review. You can go through your mind quickly, likea series of shots, and see if there is anything else that occurred that you didn'tdescribe, that might be significant or important. You can find yourself goingback to the crest of the hill, seeing the elk, lifting the rifle, firing, seeing thebullet, picking it up,, turning, talking to the man (Ausso), being in the cubicle,going to the other place, getting out of the cubicle, being in the tower, walkingalong, going to the big room, the shield.Does the shield, is the shield for an examination? Were you told what theshield was for?CH: No.LS: Then going back through the hall, back to the end of the tower, back tothe cubicle, being told that you would be going back, the lever moving down,back to the spot where the pickup was, then being glided down. Now, withoutthe discomfort in the shoulders.Now anything else that might be important in terms of the hospital?OK, fine. Doing a good job remembering. Later on, if there is anything elsewhich does occur in terms of remembering, you'll be able to recall anddescribe it. Now feeling good about being able to have gone back, feeling goodabout recalling events, knowing that the experience is over.
