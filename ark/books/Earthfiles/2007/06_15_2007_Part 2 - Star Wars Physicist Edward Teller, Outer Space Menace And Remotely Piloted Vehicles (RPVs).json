Originally leaked to Bob and Ryan Wood for their Majestic-12documents project at majesticdocuments.com. The document is entitled “Edward Teller’sPitch to President Reagan for SDI\" (Strategic Defense Initiative). The date is July 2, a yearor two after Ronald Reagan became president in January 1981.President Ronald Reagan awarded physicist Edward Teller, Ph.D.,the National Medal of Science in 1983.Image courtesy Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.[ Editor's Note: The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) was proposed by U.S.President Ronald Reagan on March 23, 1983, to use ground-based andspace-based systems to protect the United States from attack by strategicnuclear ballistic missiles. The initiative focused on strategic defense ratherthan the prior strategic offense doctrine of mutual assured destruction (MAD).The research and technologies of SDI paved the way for some anti-ballisticmissile systems of today. The Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO)was set up in 1984 within the United States Department of Defense for theStrategic Defense Initiative. It gained the popular name \"Star Wars\" after thetitle of the 1977 George Lucas feature film, the first in a series. Under theadministration of President Bill Clinton in 1993, SDI was changed to theBallistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) and its emphasis was shiftedfrom national missile defense to theater missile defense; from global toregional coverage. BMDO was later renamed Missile Defense Agency(MDA).]"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Return to: More Drone Photos and Other EyewitnessesReturn to: Birmingham-Type \"Drone\" Seen At Barksdale AFB, La., in Mid-1980s.Return to: Previous Odd Aerial \"Drone?\" Earthfiles.Return to: Engineer Comments About Odd Aerial \"Drone?\" Earthfiles.Return to: Odd Aerial \"Drone\"?
