Leo Sprinkle, Ph.D. Summary of Carl Higdon UFO Experience: “According to the newspaper article, Carl Higdon (an oil driller for the AmWell Service of Riverton, Wyoming) had been hunting elk on the north edgeof the Medicine Bow National Forest (40 miles south of Rawlins) at 4:00 p.m.,Friday, October 25. Then, approximately at 6:30 p.m., he called on the radioof the pickup truck, which he had been driving. By talking with his boss, RoyFleming, Carl was able to give directions about the approximate location of"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"the pickup truck. He said that it was parked approximately three miles fromwhere he parked it initially; it was in a 'mud hole' where no one would drive atwo-wheel-drive vehicle.“A rescue party (Sheriff Ogburn, Deputy Sheriff Ed Tierney, Roy Fleming,Bob Rosacker, Dave Martin, Harold Schurtz) drove several four-wheel-drivepickup trucks into the area. With difficulty, they found Carl and the truck(approximately at 11:40 p.m., Friday, October 25). The truck was towed outby the four-wheel-drive trucks.“Mrs. Margery Higdon, Carl's wife, was with Mr. and Mrs. Don James. Theywere waiting about two or three miles from the area where Carl was located.During the rescue operation, they observed a flashing light for about 20minutes. the light changed from red to green to white, in a pulsing pattern andmoved in an arc, which was described as 'three feet,' at arm's length.“When Carl was found, he was described as dazed and confused. He haddifficulty in talking and recognizing his wife. He said he was taken to CarbonCounty Memorial Hospital, approximately at 2:00 a.m., Monday, October 28,1974.“During his hospitalization, Carl said that the physician, Dr. Tongca, hadX-rays taken. Carl was told that the films were OK. (However, he had beenhospitalized for TB at one time before in Kimball, Nebraska. Chest X-rays in1958 and 1970 had indicated there were scar tissues on his lungs, according toa Kimball, Nebraska physician.) During his recent hospitalization, a nurse, Ms.Ella Petterson, told Carl that he was, 'OK,' and his blood was 'OK.' In fact, itwas 'super, very rich.'“Carl is hopeful that information can be obtained from medical personnel,which will support these statements. However, the Sheriff has made somepublic statements that raise questions about his acceptance of the report.“Rick Kenyon said that he had interviewed Carl Higdon and obtained thebasic description of his experience, plus some drawings of the 'man.' (entitybelow) Carl had agreed to other interviews, plus the use of hypnotictechniques for the purpose of obtaining further information about hisexperience.Illustration of odd, android-like entity encountered on October 25, 1974,by Carl Higdon for Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) investigator Rick Kenyon.“On Saturday, November 2, 1974, Bob Nantkes (MUFON) and I met withRick Kenyon (MUFON), who had arranged an afternoon appointment withCarl Higdon at his home. From approximately 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., wetalked with Mr. and Mrs. Higdon, their children and several relatives abouttheir reactions to the events of October 25, 1974. The pendulum techniqueand other hypnotic procedures were utilized to obtain more information fromCarl about his UFO experience."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"“Then, on Sunday, November 17, 1974, Rick Kenyon and I talked with CarlHigdon, his wife and children, from 11:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., including an hourof hypnotic procedures. Also present for a short period was Mrs. MarilynJames, who described her reactions to the experience of observing a flashinggreen-red-white light over the area where Carl was waiting for the rescueparty.“During the interviews, photographs were taken of the map area where Carlhad been elk hunting. Also, photographs were taken of the bullet, which Carlhad retrieved and placed in his canteen pouch. He was willing to release thebullet so that Dr. Walker, Aerial Phenomenon Research Organization (APRO)consultant could examine it. However, Carl asked that the bullet be returnedafter the examination.“Carl indicated that he was willing to have his name associated with the UFOreport. However, he wishes that his address be omitted from any publicationof the report. He believes that most people accept his story, but he wishes toprevent any 'crank' calls.“My impression of Carl Higdon is that he is a man of integrity, with averageeducation, but a keen sense of curiosity about the world around him. He is anoutdoors man and seems to have developed good skills of estimating size anddistance.“Although the sighting of a single UFO witness often is difficult to evaluate,the indirect evidence supports the tentative conclusion that Carl Higdon isreporting sincerely the events which he experienced. Hopefully, furtherstatements from other persons can be obtained to support the basicstatement.”To be continued in Part 2 - Hypnosis Session with Carl HigdonMore Information:For further reports about the human abduction syndrome, please see my books anddocumentaries in the Earthfiles Shop and other reports below in the Earthfiles Archive:• 09/16/2007 — Part 5: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 09/11/2007 — Part 4: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 09/07/2007 — Part 3: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 09/05/2007 — Part 2: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 08/31/2007 — Part 1: Betty and Barney Hill: Captured!• 08/31/2007 — Part 2: Betty and Barney Hill: Captured!• 08/30/2007 — Part 1: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 08/24/2007 — Orange-Red \"Fiery\" Aerial Spheres• 08/01/2007 — Part 3, Non-Human Blonds, Greys and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Lizards• 07/31/2007 — Part 2, Non-Human Blonds, Greys and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Lizards• 07/26/2007 — Part 1, Non-Human Blonds, Lizards and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Greys• 07/14/2007 — Schofield Barracks, Oahu, Hawaii - Huge, Lime Green UFO Over Battalion Headquarters• 05/29/2007 — Final Part 7: Eyewitness Links Animal Mutilations to Non-Humans• 05/13/2007 — Part 6: Eyewitness Links Animal Mutilations to Non-Humans• 05/11/2007 — CIA Origin of National Enquirer?• 05/06/2007 — Part 5: Eyewitness Links Animal Mutilations to Non-Humans• 05/05/2007 — Part 4: Eyewitness Links Animal Mutilations to Non-Humans• 04/28/2007 — April 24, 2007 - Part 3: Eyewitness Links Animal Mutilations to Non-Humans.• 04/19/2007 — Part 2: Eyewitness Links Animal Mutilations to Non-Humans• 04/18/2007 — Part 1: Eyewitness Links Animal Mutilations to Non-Humans• 04/20/2007 — 2006 Human Encounter with Translucent Entity• 12/14/2006 — Abductee Jim Sparks's Encounter with Reptillian Beings: Their Warning and Agenda• 10/28/2006 — Close UFO Encounter by USAF Eyewitnesses• 10/11/2006 — Part 2: Time Travel, Insights from USAF Sergeant and UFO Abductee• 10/08/2006 — Part 1: Time Travel, Insights from USAF Sergeant and UFO Abductee• 09/29/2006 — Manipulation of Time and Matter by Non-Humans: The Experiences of Jim Sparks• 09/05/2006 — Part 2: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet?• 09/04/2006 — Part 1: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet?• 06/18/2006 — Viewer Letters About NASA Airbrushing Photos; EBENs and Reptilian Humanoids• 05/12/2006 — An Extraterrestrial School for Humans• 04/28/2006 — Modern Warfare Applied to Extra-Terrestrial Invasion• 04/03/2006 — Genetic Harvest in Cimarron, New Mexico?• 02/23/2006 — Huge Boomerang Craft and Blond Beings• 02/10/2006 — Crashed Disc Photos, \"Ebens,\" and Area 51 \"Anti-Gravity\"• 01/27/2006 — Part 2: Navy Physicist and USAF Geophysicist Discuss UFOs and ETs• 12/02/2005 — Abduction by Grey ETs in Huge, Black Triangle• 10/22/2005 — A Lifting Beam Technology in Colorado Human Abduction• 08/11/2005 — Part 4: Two Men See Cow Mutilated in Light Beam• 08/03/2005 — Part 3: Two Men See Cow Mutilated in Light Beam• 07/26/2005 — Part 2: Two Men See Cow Mutilated in Light Beam• 07/22/2005 — Part 1: Two Men See Cow Mutilated in Light Beam• 02/04/2005 — Part 2: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report V - Is The Cover-Up Lid Lifting?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"• 12/22/2004 — Part 2: \"Reasons Why U.S. Government CAN'T Release Truth About UFOs!\" with CanadianResearcher, Grant Cameron• 09/25/2004 — Part 6: \"Clearview\" Report on the Investigation of UFO Experiences on A Rocky MountainRanch• 09/23/2004 — Part 5: \"Clearview\" Report on the Investigation of UFO Experiences on A Rocky MountainRanch• 09/19/2004 — Part 4: \"Clearview\" Report on the Investigation of UFO Experiences on A Rocky MountainRanch• 09/18/2004 — Part 3: \"Clearview\" Report on the Investigation of UFO Experiences on A Rocky MountainRanch• 09/14/2004 — Part 2: \"Clearview\" Report on the Investigation of UFO Experiences on A Rocky MountainRanch• 09/13/2004 — Part 1: \"Clearview\" Report on the Investigation of UFO Experiences on A Rocky MountainRanch• 01/24/2004 — Oregon Man's Experiences with High Strangeness• 10/28/2003 — Part 2 - U.
