I could hear a crackling noise. And I looked up and see this weird thingand it’s buzzing past me right above me.\" Ned White, SitgreavesNational Forest, Arizona, October 1995Around 4 PM, in October 1995, Ned White set up camp inside the SitgreavesNational Forest between Payson and Heber, Arizona (middle green dot). June 22, 2007 Phoenix, Arizona - The first alleged \"drone\" photographs were dated May5, 2007, from an anonymous Lake Tahoe, California source. The next day, on May 6,2007, more digital images were taken by a man named Chad in the Bakersfield, California,region. The Lake Tahoe images were submitted to UFOcasebook.com and the Chad imageswere submitted to the Coast to Coast AM webmaster, Lex. He and I talked about the Chadimages and Lex put me in touch with Chad.Since then, eyewitnesses to such a dragonfly-shaped aerial craft have gone back as far as1987 in a hangar at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana. I now have a list of eleven witnesses. Inaddition to Shirley in Sequoia National Park and Robert Mariotti in Northridge, California– who talked with me for audio broadcast – another eyewitness has now agreed to speakabout his October 1995, encounter north of Tucson in the Sitgreaves National Forest. Hehas requested anonymity and I will call him Ned White. Ned is 41-years-old and lives andworks in Phoenix. He has spent his professional career in electronics and now works as anautomation engineer producing assembly lines and robotics to supply a majorpharmaceutical company. In October 1995, he was on a weekend camping trip a couple of miles north of WillowSprings Lake near Payson, Arizona, at about the 7,500-foot elevation. The big lake is 22miles southwest of Heber and in the national forest in which Travis Walton was abductedon November 5, 1975."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Green circle marks Ned White's camp site northeast of Willow Springs Damand Lake between Payson and Heber, Arizona. Map by Ned White.Ned had set up his camp on one side of a meadow and realized that other people werethere near a bordering tree line, people he thought looked like gun-carrying militiamenwho were politically active in the mid-1990s. Ned said he didn’t want anything to do withthem, but thought his camp site was far enough a way to not be bothered. Then somethingvery strange happened.Interview:Ned White, Automation Engineer, Phoenix, Arizona: “I untied all my gear and wasgetting my tent up and I noticed the hair on my arms starting to feel like it was rising up. Iknow what it’s like to be around a high amount of power from electricity. And I startedhearing like I was near a power transmission line. I could hear a crackling noise.And I looked up and see this weird thing and it’s buzzing past me right above me and Iwould say from some of the photos I’ve seen (since May 2007), this was in its simplestform. Some of these new pictures I've seen, the thing looks a lot more elaborate. Thisthing back in 1995 above my camp site was a lot more simple. 1995 Arizona \"Drone\" Looked LikeBirmingham, Alabama 2006 \"Drone\"Dragonfly-shaped aerial object above power poles near construction sitein May 2006, in Birmingham, Alabama. Photo by Mr. Smith.DID YOU LOOK AT THE BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA, PHOTOGRAPH?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Yes, and that one looks more like it (what I saw). Not the later ones where it has all thoseextra things attached to it. And it just gracefully went over me. And I thought, ‘What thehell is that?’ That’s the family version of what I was thinking.When it passed me I felt as if I was near a power line. So there was a lot of electrical – likeI said, I could hear the crackling. It was just above the trees, just barely clearing the trees. \"Drone\" Interfered with GPSI tried to get a GPS fix on it, but my LED screen kept going off and on, off and on, off andon, acting very weird. Whatever that thing was giving off, my GPS wouldn't work in itspresence. I bought that GPS new in September 1995, one of the first ones on the market.Ned White: \"I found my old GPS and took a pic of the boot upscreen. The software copyright is 1994-95 and it shows on the screen,even though I know it isn't the easiest to see. But it's there, and youcan see that I've used this GPS lots of times.\" Image © 2007 by Ned White.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - \"The Global Positioning System (GPS) iscurrently the only fully functional Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS).Utilizing a constellation of at least 24 medium Earth orbit satellites thattransmit precise microwave signals, the system enables a GPS receiver todetermine its location, speed and direction. Developed by the United StatesDepartment of Defense, it is officially named NAVSTAR GPS. The satelliteconstellation is managed by the United States Air Force 50th Space Wing.GPS has become a widely used aid to navigation worldwide, and a useful toolfor map-making, land surveying, commerce, and scientific uses. GPS alsoprovides a precise time reference used in many applications includingscientific study of earthquakes, and synchronization of telecommunicationsnetworks.GPS Interference and JammingSince GPS signals at terrestrial receivers tend to be relatively weak, it is easyfor other sources of electromagnetic radiation to desensitize the receiver,making acquiring and tracking the satellite signals difficult or impossible. Solarflares are one such naturally occurring emission with the potential to degradeGPS reception, and their impact can affect reception over the half of theEarth facing the sun. GPS signals can also be interfered with by naturallyoccurring geomagnetic storms, predominantly found near the poles of theEarth's magnetic field.Man-made interference can also disrupt, or jam, GPS signals. In one welldocumented case, an entire harbor was unable to receive GPS signals due tounintentional jamming caused by a malfunctioning TV antenna preamplifier.Intentional jamming is also possible. Generally, stronger signals can interferewith GPS receivers when they are within radio range, or line of sight.\"]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"HOW HIGH ABOVE YOUR HEAD WAS IT FLYING?Probably about 20 feet. And it didn’t pay any attention to me. It just bobbed around andthen it went around and followed the tree line and got in basically behind them and itactually sunk down a ways into the trees. And it stayed there for a while behind thosepeople (militia-types).LIKE IT WAS HIDING?Like it was hiding, watching and listening. This probably went on for a good ten minutesand then it rose up and took a right and just veered off as gently as you please and justdisappeared out of sight.Path of October 1995 dragonfly \"drone\" coming over Ned White's campsite about 20 feet abovehis head, proceeding straight, then curving around to trees across a meadow where \"militia people\"were gathered. The \"drone\" seemed to hide low in the trees for about ten minutes, without being seenby militia, and then flew off on path marked \"Exit path of Drone.\" Map © 2007 by Ned White.And I thought, ‘Great, all I need is to have someone spying on me!’ I wasn’t involved inany of that (militia activity). I do own guns, but I wasn’t involved in any of that stuff. Thisreally bothered me. I thought, ‘Great, now they (government) are taking whatever thesethings are and following people.’ So at that point, I packed up my gear again and headedback to my truck. I didn’t stick around. I was pretty scared! I didn’t know what to expectnext. Dragonfly-Shaped \"Drone\" Changed Direction by \"Jumping\"and Caused Tree Leaves to MoveWhen it was moving in a constant direction, it was fairly smooth. But when it wanted tochange, it was fairly jumpy – jumping in another direction.I’m thinking back in my mind’s eye and remember watching that thing settle in – I sawleaves on the trees where it moved over - they moved like it was pushing air down.THE OTHER PEOPLE DIDN’T HAVE ANY RESPONSE?I don’t think they even saw it. And that’s what scared me. It was hugging the treetops andjust moving very gracefully. But when it changed direction, it was sort of like a skip.OTHER EYEWITNESSES THIS YEAR, LAST YEAR OR IN 2005, HAVE COMPAREDIT TO THE WAY A DRAGONFLY MOVES OVER WATER OR THE WAY A WATERBUG – WHICH IS A JERKY, SKIPPING MOTION.When it was moving in a constant direction, it was fairly smooth. But when it wanted tochange, it was fairly jumpy – jumping in another direction. Long \"Tail\" Turned First Before Direction ChangeSINCE IT WAS ONLY ABOUT 20 FEET ABOVE YOU, COULD YOU SEE ANYTHING"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"IN THAT DRAGONFLY-SHAPED VEHICLE THAT SEEMED TO BE RESPONSIBLEFOR IT MAKING A CHANGE IN DIRECTION?No. I know airplanes. I know – my dream as a child was to be an astronaut. But when 2ndgrade came around and I had to wear glasses, that dream was trashed. But I knowairplanes, helicopters; I can recognize different kinds of engines. And looking at this thing,there were no moving parts.Now, looking back - after seeing the thing in photographs brought back the memory.Seeing the way that thing was moving, I swear by knowing about aviation, it is usingelectrostatic energy to force air down to make it stay up in the air.DID THE RING ALWAYS STAY GOING FORWARD? OR DID THE TAIL TURNAROUND THE RING?The tail, when it moved in a different direction, the tail would turn first and then it wouldmove.THE TAIL MOVED FIRST?The tail moved first. So if it changed like making a right hand turn, the tail would move forthe ring to be in front.LIKE IT WOULD STOP AND PIVOT?Yeah.THAT MATCHES THE MOTHER WITH TWO SONS LAST YEAR IN YOSEMITEPARK. SHE SAID WHEN THEY SHINED A FLASHLIGHT ON IT (“DRONE”), ITSTOPPED IN MID-AIR AND THEN IT SEEMED TO MAKE A FAST, JERKY TURNGOING INI ANOTHER DIRECTION. EACH TIME THE AIMED THE FLASHLIGHTON IT, THE CRAFT WOULD MAKE A STOP AND STRANGE, JERKY TURN,MAYBE LIKE A PIVOT.Right.IF YOUR EXPERIENCE OCCURRED IN OCTOBER OF 1995 AND WE’RESPEAKING IN JUNE OF 2007 – THAT’S NEARLY TWELVE YEARS AGO – INTHOSE 12 YEARS, HAVE YOU DESCRIBED THIS DETAIL ABOUT THE MACHINEIN THE AIR TO ANYONE ELSE?Just recently to my sisters. Arizona \"Drone\" Witness Afraidof U. S. Government RetaliationSO YOU DIDN’T TALK ABOUT IT AT ALL UNTIL NOW?No. I had a scary experience some years before where I was at the wrong place at thewrong time and I saw something I should not have. And I was warned the next day not totalk about anything.That was fresh in my memory (in Oct. 1995) and I didn’t want to put myself at risk. So Ibit my tongue. I didn’t know what it (“drone”) was and I didn’t want to draw attention tomyself.WHAT DID YOU SEE BEFORE AND WERE WARNED ABOUT?It was a stealth fighter. It’s out in the open now. I used to work at the Goodyear plant (inPhoenix) and I answered an alarm call. I went out there – and this was about 1985. I wentout to answer the alarm call and I saw this plane and it was having engine trouble. Itlanded at the Goodyear airport, not at Luke AFB (in Glendale suburb of Phoenix).I was like, ‘Wow, that’s a cool silhouette!’ I was talking to a police officer and decided todrive up past the Goodyear plant and there it was and there were guys out there withmachine guns. I went, ‘Oh, that’s a neat looking plane. Oh, crap, these guys are looking atme.’ And then I got a visit at my apartment the next day.DID THEY TAKE DOWN YOUR NAME, ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBER THEREAT THE SITE?No, they were behind a fence. I was driving on a road and they took down my plate"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"number, probably. And that’s how they tracked me down. They told me, ‘If you see thatthing on TV, then you can talk about it. Other than that,At first, they were polite about it. They said, ‘We’re asking you as a patriot citizen not tosay anything to anybody.THEN THEY BECAME MORE STERN?They became sterner and said, ‘If you do talk about this, there are things we can dobecause, you know, you should not have seen this and it’s not a good thing that you did.So, if you start bragging about this thing, we have found people out in the desert.’THEY ACTUALLY SAID THAT TO YOU?Right, in front of my girlfriend at the time.AN IMPLIED DEATH THREAT.An implied death threat. And I turned around and told them, ‘Look, I’m a patriotic guyand there is no need for that. All you have to say is - Don’t say anything - and I’m notgoing to say anything.’At the very end of this thing, they said, ‘If you see it on TV then you can tell everybodyabout what you saw. But until then, don’t say a word.’Seeing that probe thing right above my camp and those militia guys was like, ‘I don’t wantto be in another situation where I said something or saw something I was not supposed toand then talk about it and have some visit like the last time. I don’t want that to happenagain.SO, YOU KEPT YOUR MOUTH ABSOLUTELY SHUT BETWEEN 1995 AND 2007BECAUSE OF THE 1985 RUN IN WITH GOVERNMENT AGENTS CONCERNINGTHE STEALTH THEN. BUT NOW WE’RE DEALING WITH WHAT WE’RE NOTSURE WHAT IT IS, WHAT ITS ORIGIN IS OR WHO MADE IT.Right.IN 2007 WITH THESE DRAGONFLY-SHAPED ‘DRONES’ THAT HAVE BEENMORPHING IN THE SHAPES AND WITH APPENDAGES AND NOW TO THISCURRENT, VERY MENACING-LOOKING ONE WITH ALMOST A WAR MACHINEAPPEARANCE, IF IT IS AMERICAN – IF IT IS A ‘BLACK PROJECT,’ WHY WOULDIT BE OUT IN THE PUBLIC BETWEEN 1995 WHEN YOU SAW IT AND NOW IN2007?I don’t know. What I would be curious about is what kind of political situation is going onin the areas it is going to?WHY IS IT BEING SEEN ONLY IN STATE OR NATIONAL PARKS?Yeah, that’s kind of weird. I don’t know. I wish I had an answer for that! (laughs)BUT YOUR BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WHAT YOU SAW IN OCTOBER OF 1995 MOSTCLOSELY RESEMBLES THE PHOTOGRAPH FROM BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA?Yes. What I saw was the more simpler version (than Big Basin, California).AND WHO IS BEHIND THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD ALL LIKE TO KNOW.Yeah. Out of fear, I just kept my mouth shut. My Mom and my two sisters, I have to bethere for them. I don’t have any kids of my own and I’m not married. But, I worry aboutmy Mom and my sisters. The reason I’m calling you now is that I called my sisters up andI talked to them and told them what I saw. And I told them what I was thinking abouttalking (to Linda for Earthfiles).My family turned around and said, ‘Tell them. Tell them what you saw.’” Writing In Chad \"Drone\" Image -A Link to NASA Clementine 1 Moon Mission?I first interviewed Ned White on Saturday, June 16.

In other words, the characters yx7+ in thisdocument are merely ASCII character interpretations ofwhat are really numerical data that are part of thedigital description of an image made by the Clementinespacecraft ...\"While pondering this, I half remembered (here comesthe frustratingly vague bit) a British TV documentarythat I had seen maybe two or three years ago in whicha senior journalist, who worked either for one of themajor flying magazines (Flight International?), ormaybe it was for Jane's Aircraft, set out to provethat while UFOs are real, they have nothing to do withaliens but are rather all the products of governmentblack projects dating back to the Nazis in WWII.Because of the particular clout that he possessed inthe aviation business, he was able to secureinterviews with many top people in the industryincluding one in particular that my pondering on thedrones had brought to mind. \"Electrostatic Levitation\"\"This was with a high-upexecutive in one of the major American aircraft (anddefense) manufacturing companies. He enthusiasticallyendorsed the journalist's theory of the black-opsorigin of UFO sightings, and by way of supportingevidence, proceeded to demonstrate electrostaticlevitation by plugging a coil of bare copper wire intohis office electricity socket and suspending it overan aluminum plate (not only was this extremelydangerous from the point of view of possibleelectrocution, but the heat generated was such that hehad to end the experiment after a few seconds lest heset fire to the office). He then said something alongthe lines of: 'We in the industry are much furtheradvanced along the line of exotic propulsion andlifting technologies than the public realizes.'\"Why he should make such an admission (when I would assumethat he would be sworn to secrecy on the matter), Icannot even guess. I remember that in the documentarythis demonstration of electrostatic levitation wasthen linked to an explanation of some of the GulfBreeze UFO photographs which appeared to show glowing(it was suggested from heat) cylindrical apertures atthe base of the craft.\"For further information about the dragonfly-shaped \"drones,\" please see reports below:Return to: 06/18/2007 - Writing In Chad \"Drone\" Image - A Link to NASAClementine 1 Moon Mission?Return to: 06/17/2007 - More Big Basin, California, Bizarre \"Drone\" ImagesReturn to: 06/15/2007 - Part 1: Northridge, California, Aerial \"Drone\" EyewitnessOn the RecordReturn to: 06/15/2007 - Part 2: Star Wars Physicist Edward Teller, Outer Space"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Menace And Remotely Piloted Vehicles (RPVs)Return to: 06/08/07 More Drone Photos and Other EyewitnessesReturn to: 05/30/07 Birmingham-Type \"Drone\" Seen At Barksdale AFB, La., inMid-1980s.Return to: 05/28/07 Letters About Unidentified \"Drone\" Aerial Objects.Return to: 05/21/07 Odd Aerial \"Drone\" Photographed Over Capitola, California.Return to: Updated 05/21/07 Previous Odd Aerial \"Drone?\" Earthfiles.Return to: 05/16/07 Engineer Comments About Odd Aerial \"Drone?\" Earthfiles.Websites:Lawrence Livermore Lab: http://www.llnl.gov/llnl/history/edward_teller.htmlNASA Drones: http://uav.wff.nasa.gov/relatedlinks.cfmIon Propulsion, NASA: http://nmp.nasa.gov/ds1/tech/ionpropfaq.htmlHigh Power Electric Propulsion Program (HiPEP): http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/ion/present/hipep.htmMajestic 12 Documents: http://www.majesticdocuments.comCoast to Coast AM We bsi t e : http://www.coasttocoastam.comUFO Casebook: http://www.ufocasebook.com/strangecraftlaketahoe.htm Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
