Image by Cassini-Huygens/NASA JPL.January 6, 2007 Pasadena, California - NASA's JPL reports that scientists now have\"definitive evidence of the presence of lakes filled with liquid methane\" on Saturn's moonTitan. The radar data was published in this week's journal Nature cover story. Radarimaging data from a July 22, 2006, fly-over by the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft providedconvincing evidence for large bodies of liquid methane. on Titan today. Liquid Methane Lakes On Titan"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Liquid methane lakes, perhaps even larger oceans, on Saturn's moon Titan.False color radar image on July 22, 2206, by Cassini-Huygens/NASA JPL.Characteristics:Radar-dark patches are interpreted as lakes based on their very low radarreflectivity and morphological similarities to lakes, including associated channelsand location in topographic depressions.1.Radar-dark surfaces are smooth and most likely liquid, rock, ice or organics. Morethan 75 radar-dark patches or lakes were seen, ranging from 3 kilometers (1.8 miles)to more than 70 kilometers (43 miles) across.2.Some lakes appear partly dry, while others seem liquid-filled. Some of the partlyfilled lakes may never have filled fully, or may have partly evaporated at some pointin the past. The dry lakes have margins or rims and a radar brightness similar to therest of the surrounding terrain, making them appear devoid of liquid.3.The varying states of how full the lakes are suggest that lakes in this region of Titanmight be temporary on some unknown timescale.4.NASA/JPL: \"Approximately fifteen of the dark patches seem filled and show no clearevidence of erosion. These dark patches resemble terrestrial lakes confined within impactbasins (for example, Clearwater Lakes in Canada) or within volcanic calderas (forexample, Crater Lake, Oregon). The nest-like nature of these lakes and their limited rangeof sizes make it unlikely that they originated from an impact. A volcanic origin for thedepressions is possible, given their appearance.\"Some lakes have steep margins and very distinct edges, suggesting a topographic rim.These lakes are consistent with seepage or groundwater drainage lakes. Other lakes havediffuse, more scalloped edges, with a gradual decrease in radar brightness towards thecenter of the lake. These lakes are more likely to be associated with channels, and may beeither drainage lakes or groundwater drainage lakes.\"Yet other lakes have curvy channel-like extensions, similar in appearance to terrestrialflooded river valleys (for example Lake Powell). Bright patches near the lake edges couldbe small islands peeking through the surface. Floating \"icebergs\" are unlikely because mostmaterials would not float in liquid hydrocarbons.\"Based on the lake characteristics, Cassini scientists think they are observing liquid-filledlakes on Titan today. Another possibility is that these depressions and channels formed inthe past and have now been filled by a low-density deposit that is darker than anyobserved elsewhere on Titan. However, the absence of wind-blown features in this areamakes the low-density hypothesis unlikely.\"These northern hemisphere lakes are the strongest evidence yet that Titan's surface andatmosphere have an active hydrological cycle, though with a condensable liquid other thanwater. In this cycle, lakes are filled through methane rainfall or intersect with a subsurfacelayer saturated with liquid methane."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"\"As Titan's seasons progress over the 29-year cycle of Saturn's orbit around the sun, lakesin the winter hemisphere should expand by steady methane rain, while summer hemispherelakes shrink or dry up entirely.\"More Information:For further information about Saturn and its moons, please see the Earthfiles Archivesbelow. • 07/25/2006 -- Giant Hydrocarbon Lakes Found On Saturn Moon, Titan• 05/05/2006 -- Saturn's Titan Moon Has Puzzling Dunes• 11/09/2005 -- Dust Storm On Mars, Cosmic First Light and Black Hole At Our Galaxy's Center• 09/16/2005 -- \"Planet X\" and the Kuiper Belt's Oddballs, \"Santa\" and \"Easterbunny\"• 05/19/2005 -- USAF Wants Space Weapons Program• 05/06/2005 -- What Are The Straight Lines on Saturn's Titan Moon?• 02/17/2005 -- Iapetus and Enceladus: Baffling Moons of Saturn• 01/22/2005 -- Titan - A Moon Where It Rains Methane Into Seas and Soils of Hydrocarbons• 01/14/2005 -- Updated - Cassini/Huygen's First Look At Titan's Surface• 11/25/2004 -- Closest Look At Mysterious Titan from Cassini Spacecraft• 06/11/2004 -- Cassini Spacecraft Will Rendezvous with Saturn July 1, 2004Websites:Saturn's Moons: http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/science/moons/index.cfmCassini-Huygens Mission: http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features/feature20070103.cfm Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2010 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2010, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
