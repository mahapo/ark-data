It was my first trip to investigate crop formations and one night, half a dozen of uswatched a small, spherical orange-white light moving along the trees atop the hill.Since the early 1990s, many videotapes and photographs have captured glowing, smalllights in crop formations. Some eyewitnesses without cameras say they have seen the cropgo down beneath moving lights.Eventually I wrote my fourth book about the phenomenon in Mysterious Lights and CropCircles. [ See: Earthfiles Shop. ] The first edition was published in 2000 at about the sametime that digital cameras were beginning to replace 35mm negative cameras.Coincidentally, I began to receive hundreds of digital photographs from people all over thisplanet showing glowing spheres, or orbs, in forests, churches, birthday parties – all kinds ofplaces. Most of the photographers never saw the glowing orbs at the scenes. It was onlylater looking at the images that the orbs would be in the pictures – sometimes hundreds oforbs of different colors, sizes and varying surfaces would be in the same image.And now in November 2007, comes a book entitled, The Orb Project by physicist KlausHeinemann and theologian and philosopher, Miceal Ledwith, D.D. [See More Informationat bottom of this report.] The new book's Foreword was written by William Tiller, Ph.D.and Prof. Emeritus of Materials Science and Engineering at Stanford University. Prof.Tiller wrote the 1997 groundbreaking book, Science and Human Transformation, whichpostulates the existence of subtle energies beyond the four fundamental forces:Electromagnetic, Strong, Weak and Gravitation. Prof. Tiller hypothesized that there is afifth fundamental force of subtle energies, which act on human consciousness. Prof. Tillerfurther comments for The Orb Project, “My working hypothesis is that the orbphenomenon should be looked at as a positive experience for humanity, as just the first ofa variety of communi-cation manifestations to appear in the unfolding adventure of ourfuture. ...The orbs are certainly not creatures of our spacetime world.”Are the glowing orbs intelligent plasmas? Are they from beyond our 3-dimensionalspacetime universe? Would that mean they are angels? Or from angelic realms?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"This week I talked about these questions with Klaus Heinemann, Ph.D. In 1968, he received his degree in physics from Tubingen University in Germany. Between 1969 and1990, he worked at NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California. His NASAresearch was devoted to studying the reactions of solid surfaces and small crystals in theharsh environment of various gases and temperatures. The goal was always to developshuttle and space vehicle surfaces that could withstand space travel.Between 1979 to 1984, Dr. Heinemann also worked at Stanford University on the physicsof gaseous impacts on metal and crystal surfaces and how such surfaces behave in anoxidizing environment.Today he is retired from that work, but continues his research of the orb phenomenon. Hehas taken thousands of photographs in which the orbs show up – and the first one was onSeptember 26, 2004, at a seminar called “Healing Prayer Intensive.” One of his digitalcamera images had a very bright circular feature which so surprised and puzzled Prof.Heinemann that he went back to the hotel ballroom of the seminar to see if he could figureout what had reflected so brightly. But he could not solve the orb image by anyconventional explanation.I began our interview by asking what finally convinced him that many of the orbs are notthe product of electrostatic discharge in digital cameras, dust or moisture reflecting light inthe air.Interview:Klaus Heinemann, Ph.D., Physicist, Retired from NASA Ames Research Center,Moffett Field, California (1969 - 1990), and from Stanford University (1979-1984),Sunnyvale, California: “If you see an orb eclipsed by an object – for example, by thehead of a person or a chair so that the orb is clearly behind the object and far away fromthe camera – that is a very convincing argument (that orbs are not static build up insidecamera, or dust particles or moisture drops outside the camera).We have seen a number of these pictures where orbs are not fully seen, but eclipsed by anobject in front of it. The evidence is that the orbs are emitting light in a highly coherentfashion, almost like a laser beam and beaming that light into the camera. That is the resultof a lot of experimentation that I have done with orbs.Rev. Ron Roth in another prayer healing seminar, February 26, 2002,Scottsdale, Arizona. Orb is in the distance and partially eclipsed by Rev. Roth's head."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Enlarged and cropped section of February 26, 2002, Scottsdale, Arizona,in which intricately structured orb is partially eclipsed by Rev.

Orbs Move Rapidly and Change SizeI would say that there is something missing in the equation that we’ve discussed so far andthat is the velocity that these orbs have and their change in size. I believe the only reasonwhy we cannot see them with our bare eyes is because they are moving so fast and areconstantly changing their size. So in order to see them, they literally have to remain still fora moment and have to decide, ‘Yes, I want to be seen.’ Then they move on after that. So, itis not as if they are there all the time like we are. Their normal position is of great mobilityand speed, while our normal position would be one of rest (in comparison). So the orbs arein a different space.WHAT IS PROVOKING THE CHANGE IN SIZE AND SPEED?That might be simply their way of being. I really don’t know."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Orbs moving rapidly against static yard scene. Image © by Miceal Ledwith, D.D.Healing Prayer Seminar, September 26, 2004, Chicago, Illinois. Rev.

Image © 2004 by Klaus Heinemann, Ph.D. Intelligent Plasmas of Unknown OriginIF YOU WERE GOING TO TRY TO DO A THOUGHT EXERCISE ABOUT WHAT THEORBS ACTUALLY ARE AND IN WHAT FREQUENCY THEY MIGHT EXIST ANDWHAT RELATIONSHIP THAT FREQUENCY MIGHT HAVE TO THE FREQUENCYOF OUR CARBON-BASED LIFE HERE AS WE KNOW IT ON THE SURFACE OFTHE EARTH AND THROUGH THE UNIVERSE, WHAT KIND OF A THOUGHTEXERCISE COULD YOU DO?I think the only thought exercise I could do is one where I would have to frame it entirelydifferently, in a way that it’s not limited to the physics that we are, that our physical realityis based on. I believe these are phenomena that are outside our normal physical reality. So,many of these questions are really, at this point, totally unanswered in my mind.I see the orbs existing in a different energetic form, in a form we do not yet have a hold of,in a form that is not in any way related to our physical universe. The orbs are not related toour physical atoms. The orbs are not related to how the atoms vibrate. The orbs are notrelated in any way to velocities limited by the speed of light. None of that.I would resonate with a metaphor that would simply say there must be other universes,other realities, that are subjected to a different set of physical constants in such a way thatwe are not seeing those. The orbs are totally interspersed with us within the vacuum spacethat is all around us. We all know that our reality is essentially one that has huge voids anda little bit of substance here and there.I’m talking about the fact that we are composed of mostly empty space. This empty spacecan be interspersed with a lot of different universes that we cannot see, but neverthelesshave energetic aspects.IF I’M FOLLOWING YOU, WHAT YOU MEANS IS THAT THE SPACE HAS TO DOWITH THE SPACES IN THE ATOMIC AND MOLECULAR LEVELS OF WHICH WEARE MADE AND ESSENTIALLY THAT’S MORE SPACE THAN IT IS SUBSTANCEOR MATTER.Yes, that is almost all space and very little substance.THE ORBS, WHEN YOU SAY ENERGETIC BODIES, YOU MEAN THEY COULD BEPLASMA ENERGIES MOVING AT A FASTER THAT WE DON’T SEE?That is more likely the matter of what I’m looking at, yes.WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHEN YOU USE THE TERM ‘ENERGETIC BODIES’ FORTHE ORBS?I would see them as energetic plasmas, but what people call ‘subtle energy.’UNDETERMINED AND UNDETECTED BY OUR CURRENT NORMAL PHYSICS?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Yet undetermined and undetected by our current physics, correct. Orbs and Divine PresenceIF THEY ARE INTELLIGENT PLASMAS OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN AND YOURBOOK IS PRESENTING THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THEY HAVE ONLY SHOWED UPIN THE PAST DECADE OR TWO WITH TREMENDOUS INTENSITY AROUND THEWORLD ...Ye s ....AND IF I AM UNDERSTANDING CORRECTLY, YOU ARE LINKING THE ORBSTO A FASCINATING CHAPTER IN YOUR BOOK ENTITLED, ‘ORBS: EVIDENCE OFDIVINE PRESENCE.’ COULD YOU TAKE THE CONCEPT OF INTELLIGENTPLASMAS OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN AND TALK ABOUT HOW THAT MIGHTRELATE TO EVIDENCE OF DIVINE PRESENCE?Well, in my mind, they can be very easily one and the same. What is really divine? It’ssomething that is beyond the understanding, beyond the physics that we have. It goesbeyond. Divine is, in my understanding, the reality that is beyond the physical reality.Consciousness is in the divine realm. Even human consciousness extends into the divinerealm. So, there is a vast continuum of something that is not nothing.IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS EVER-PRESENT EVERYWHERE INTHE COSMOS, AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING LIKE A PHOTON HAVING TOTRAVEL A CERTAIN DISTANCE?That is a very good statement. I would say that is fair to say. In my mind, consciousness isprojected and available to be received everywhere in the universe. It will not decay and istherefore, good, almost like it is there to be picked up by anybody anywhere in theuniverse.LIKE A DIVINE FIELD.It is a field, yes.FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE, YOU’RE SAYING THEN THAT THE ORBS WOULD BEIN WHAT RELATIONSHIP TO THAT DIVINE FIELD?They would be in the same relationship as I would see, for example – I see the humanexistence as a very temporary excursion from the reality that is the divine reality, isbeyond this reality. The consciousness part would remain after the physical death of theperson. There are, in fact, huge numbers and varieties in that reality that we cannot see.THAT WE PASS INTO AFTER THE MOMENT OF DEATH?Yes, that we would likely pass into after our physical existence ends here.THEN, PROF. HEINEMANN, YOU ARE IMPLYING THAT THE ORBS WOULDHAVE A DIRECT LINK TO THE SOULS OF THE BODY CONTAINERS IN WHATWE’LL CALL THIS DIMENSION. THEN AFTER THE MOMENT OF DEATH HERE,WHERE THE SOUL/SPIRIT ENTITY WOULD GO COULD BE RELATED TO THEORB PHENOMENON?It is possible. It could be. I would not exclude that. I would say that’s a likely explanation,but if you go in the direction of orbs being those who no longer live with us on Earth, thatmight be far too limiting. I would simply call them entities in a reality beyond our reality.THEN WHY IS IT THAT THE ORBS ARE EVER-PRESENT HERE?Because in that reality (they come from), space and time have no meaning. So,ever-present and here are only meaningful for us in this physical reality where yesterday isyesterday and tomorrow is tomorrow. But if in this other reality I’m talking about, theaspect of time and space do not exist.A STEADY STATE CONSCIOUSNESS?A steady state consciousness.IN A DIVINE FIELD.In a field that is permanently perceived as divine or spiritual."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THE FIELD AND CONSCOUSNESS ARE ETERNAL. BUT THE MATTER WORLDSAND ENERGY WORLDS COME AND GO WITHIN THAT STEADY STATECONSCIOUSNESS AND DIVINE FIELD?That sounds very good, yes. The only change I would make is that there might even be aconcept of time in that steady state field, but time would be vastly different from ours. Sofrom our perspective, it would be totally steady state, but there might be a time element. Inother words, with the consciousness that we human beings ‘produce,’ this steady stateconsciousness will be increased. We are vehicles to influence that field with our ownconsciousness. Orbs Show Up More in Infrared FrequenciesWHY IS IT THEN, FROM YOUR PERSONAL POINT OF VIEW STUDYING ALL OFTHIS, THAT THE ORBS WOULD SHOW UP IN THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF HUMANSSUDDENLY IN THE PAST 15 YEARS?I think it is explainable by the digital cameras. There have been orbs seen in images bynormal cameras (35mm negatives), but they were never taken for serious (by investigatorsor scientists). They appeared at a very low contrast. It just was not a phenomenon that wasreally studied because they were so rare.But with the advent of the digital cameras, especially those with a high sensitivity to theinfrared range, which is a lower energy range, this became much more prominent. Andthen, only relatively very few orbs are seen in high contrast. Most of the orbs come outonly with the aid of contrast enhancement techniques that you can use with digitalcameras. You can very legitimately increase the contrast of an image and therefore makethe orbs much more prominent.YOU MAKE THE POINT IN YOUR BOOK THAT IN YOUR RESEARCH THAT THEORBS EXIST IN A FREQUENCY THAT WOULD BE INFRARED?Yes. A lot are, but not all of them. It appears as if they are at somewhat a lower frequencythan our visible spectrum. But the main point is that the digital cameras can very easily beused to enhance a contrast, even a color, in such a way that if there is anything in it, youcan make it visible. Why Such Variety in Orb Appearances?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" Type A: Extremely bright, strong interior structure, unchanged by color enhancement.Type B: Lower intensity, rounded \"eye.\" Type C: Linear features. Type D: \"Eye\" in center.Type E: High intensity, fewer interior features, irregular bright spots. Type F: Low brightness,no \"eye,\" mandala-like interior pattern. Type G: Low br ightness and hi gh-contrast peri phery,but virtually no interior pattern. Type H: High brightness, low contrast outer border,no interior pattern. Images © by Klaus Heinemann, Ph.D.WHY IS THERE SO MUCH STRUCTURE IN SOME OF THESE ORBS – THE ONESTHAT APPEAR ALMOST LIKE RODS AND CONES IN EYES. WHY WOULD THEREBE SO MANY VARIATIONS IN STRUCTURES OF THE ORBS AS YOU SHOW INYOUR BOOK?I think this is a very interesting question. I only have a very pragmatic answer to that. Ibelieve this reality in which the orbs exists is at least as rich in variety as our own reality is.In our reality, we have living things of everything you can imagine. So in the orb reality,there is a huge variety.IF IT IS A WORLD OF PLASMA, THAT IS TECHNICALLY NOT A WORLD OFMATTER AND NOT JUST LIGHT, BUT IS SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN?Yes, somewhere in between. The orbs might be from a place of intelligent plasmas orintelligent beings that are not physical. Are Orbs Emanations Linked to PlaceWhere Souls Go After Moment of Death?IS THERE A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN THE LIFE FORCE THAT ANIMATES OURCONTAINER BODIES IN THE LIFE IN THIS DIMENSION AND AT THE MOMENTOF DEATH, IS THERE A TRANSITION THEN OF THAT CONSCIOUSNESS ANDSOUL/SPIRIT ENTITY INTO THAT WHICH YOU HAVE SAID IS THE BEYOND,THAT PLACE AFTER THE MOMENT OF DEATH. COULD THAT BE THEN THEPLASMA PLACE OF THE ORBS?It could be. I really don’t know. But I would think that these are all questions that we haveto ask ourselves. They are very much questions that go into the realm of belief, but I dothink there is some validity to that."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"I GUESS I AM TRYING TO WRAP MY MIND AROUND THE PROVOCATIVE IDEATHAT WHEN WE SEE OR PHOTOGRAPH THE ORB PHENOMENON, THAT SOMEHOW WE WOULD BE CAPTURING A PIECE OF ETERNITY FROM APERSPECTIVE THAT WOULD BE NON-ETERNAL – MEANING THE 3-DUNIVERSE WORLDS, WHICH WILL DISAPPEAR. AND THEN WOULD ALL THEUNIVERSES THAT EXIST – WOULD THE ORB PHENOMENON BE INTERACTINGIN A CONSCIOUSNESS FIELD IN ALL THE UNIVERSES?I would say yes, they probably would. This is a truly phenomenal situation in which we arewitnessing something that is visiting us and making itself visible in our physicalinstruments, our cameras, yet coming from a reality that is not ours, that we cannotdescribe. We have no way of describing the orb reality. All we can say is that the orbreality is not subjected to space and time.WHY IS IT THAT THE DIVINE FIELD AND STEADY STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESSCONTINUES TO WORK SO HARD OVER MILENNIA TO INTERFACE WITH THISCARBON-BASED HOMINID LIFE FORM THAT SEEMS TO BE SO VIOLENT ANDSELF-DESTRUCTIVE?Yes, yes. Why is that? It’s very interesting that they (in divine field) consider us on thissmall planet in this vast universe important enough to even bother. That is the question andit is mind boggling if that is the case, considering the vastness of the universe and beyond.But apparently, they have a stake in us.”More Information:The Orb Project © 2007 by Miceal Ledwith, D.D., and Klaus Heinemann, Ph.D.,with Foreword by William A.
