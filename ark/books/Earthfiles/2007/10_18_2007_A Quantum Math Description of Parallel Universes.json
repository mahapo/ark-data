Click for podcast.October 18, 2007 Davis, California - There could be another Earth, a Doppelgangerplanet, full of healthy bees in another parallel universe - just like the famousSchroedinger's cat in the physics thought experiment about quantum mechanics - in whichall states of existence are probable at the same time. That's why Schroedinger's cat can beboth dead and alive at the same time.Erwin Rudolf Josef Alexander Schroedinger,Ph.D., August 12, 1887 – January 4, 1961. Physicist who achievedfame for his contributions to quantum mechanics, especially the Schroedingerequation, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1933. In 1935, after extensivecorrespondence with personal friend Albert Einstein, he proposed theSchroedinger's cat thought experiment.Schroedinger's Cat - one experimental model.When the nucleus (bottom left) decays, the Geiger counter (bottom center)may sense it and trigger the release of the gas. In one hour, there is a 50%chance that the nucleus will decay, the gas will be released and the cat killed.Atoms are never in only one location, but are in all probable locations at the same time.That irrationality of quantum mechanics caused Einstein and other 20th Century physicists"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"great frustration. Albert Einstein didn't like the concept that \"God would play dice with theuniverse.\"But now comes controversial mathematical theory from Professor David Deutsch atOxford University in England that explains how Schroedinger's cat really can be alive anddead at the same time - in parallel universes.Prof. Deutsch's quantum physics equations show a cosmic structure that can be comparedto a bush or tree with branches and each branch is a parallel universe. That would meanour universe is only one of the many probable states that universes can take.Schroedinger's cat can be alive here - and dead in the parallel universe next door - all atthe same time, as atoms are everywhere at the same time in a molecule.Recently I talked about this controversial parallel universe theory with Prof. AndreasAlbrecht, Prof. of Physics at the University of California-Davis. Since his Ph.D. at theUniversity of Pennsylvania, Prof. Albrecht has been trying to understand how all-proba-bilities-are-possible in quantum mechanics relates to the physical 3-D universe we live in.Interview:Andreas Albrecht, Ph.D., Professor of Physics, Department of Physics, University ofCalifornia-Davis, Davis, California: “Many physicists to this day remain veryuncomfortable about quantum mechanics. In fact, I teach quantum mechanics toundergraduate physics majors now and the book we use has a lot of that discomfort in it aswell.WHICH IS THE CAT CAN’T BE BOTH DEAD AND ALIVE!Yeah, you can say it’s all well and good that the equations confirm that we get to becertain about this (multiple realities), but what are we actually doing keeping track of allthese different outcomes? We are hard-nosed physicists who want to talk about what wecan really measure, not metaphysics. I think I can know this is what I’m putting my fingeron, this is how you go and measure it – don’t bother me with any other crap!And so here I am trying to have this hard nosed attitude, but what do I have: thisfundamental theory that says most of my effort when I compute the future direction ofphysical systems, most of my effort goes into keeping track of all the things that couldhave happened, but didn’t! (laughs)IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT PROBABILITY GROWS OUT OF A STRUCTURE OF THECOSMOS IN THAT THIS COSMOS IS MULTIPLE PARALLEL UNIVERSES, WHICHIS WHAT SETS UP THE PROBABILISITIC NATURE OF WHAT’S AROUND US?I think that is fair to say.HERE IS A QUOTE FROM THE PRESS ASSOCIATION BACK ON SEPTEMBER 23,2007: ‘The Oxford team lead by David Deutsch, Ph.D., showed mathematicallythat the bush-like branching structure created by the universe splitting intoparallel versions of itself can explain the probabilistic nature of quantumoutcomes.’Absolutely! That’s absolutely right.TO ME, WHAT THIS DOES IS PUSHES US INTO SEEING THAT THE STRUCTUREOF THE GRAND COSMOS IS ONE OF BRANCHES, WHICH ARE PARALLELUNIVERSE S.Ye s .AND THEN QUANTUM MECHANICS FALLS OUT OF THAT AS A RESIDUE IN OUR3-D WORLD REFLECTING THOSE PARALLEL UNIVERSES. AND IT WOULDEXPLAIN HOW, IN SCHROEDINGER’S DILEMMA THAT THE CAT CAN BE ALIVEIN THIS UNIVERSE AND BE DEAD IN THE PARALLEL UNIVERSE.That’s right.THE CAT CAN BE ALIVE AND DEAD IN TWO DIFFERENT REALITIES.Right.HOW COULD WE GO ABOUT PROVING THE EXISTENCE OF PHYSICAL,PARALLE L UNIVERSE S?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The most direct connection with the parallel universes comes from laboratory experiments.The catch is that parallel universes seem to be nicely separated. But it turns out thatparallel universes are never perfectly separated. In the case of the cat (Schroedinger’s), thedegree of separation is so great that it’s really secure.THAT THE CAT IS ALIVE HERE AND DEAD IN ANOTHER UNIVERSE.Yeah. But you can consider other systems that are not as solid as the cat. You can go intothe lab and say, ‘Here are two parallel universes that I’ve separated apart. But theremaining interconnection between the two is not so small as it was for the cat. And I candig in carefully with my really super high tech equipment and study that connection.Whenever people have done that, they’ve really seen it, just as predicted by quantummechanics. So, it’s not just that the parallel universes are out there, but they are notperfectly separated. As you consider the various possible branches. You can actually seethe interference among the branches in the laboratory.AND THE LAWS OF PHYSICS COULD BE VERY DIFFERENT IN EACH UNIVERSE?Exactly. And what you try to do is find very sharply defined probabilities so you can makepredictions. Dark Energy Could Relate to Existenceof Parallel UniversesIF THERE ARE PARALLEL UNIVERSES, THEN THEY MIGHT BE SEPARATEDFROM EACH OTHER BY AN ELECTROMAGNETIC MEMBRANE, JUST TO USE APHRASE. COULD IT BE THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE OTHER UNIVERSESCOULD RELATE TO THE MYSTERIES OF DARK ENERGY AND DARK MATTERAS WE PERCEIVE IT IN THIS PARTICULAR UNIVERSE?Yes, some people are trying that line of reasoning – especially the dark energy. They aretrying to argue that maybe the processes of looking for the most probable laws of physicswill guide us to a set of laws that are closely tied to having a certain amount of darkenergy.THAT THE UNIVERSES ARE SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER BYELECTROMAGNETIC MEMBRANES OR ARE ON DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES, ORSOMETHING LIKE THAT?The idea that we have built a theory that fundamentally has these many branches (ofparallel universes) would, in the end, be feeding into our understanding of the dark energy.AND RIGHT DOWN TO THE VERY SMALLEEST, THE FACT THAT ATOMS ARENOT IN ONE PLACE, BUT ARE IN ALL PLACES AT ONCE IN THE DIFFERENT‘SHELLS’ THAT MAKE UP OUR MOLECULES – IT’S A METAPHOR FOREVERYTHING AT THE MACRO LEVEL OF THE COSMOS.Right. That’s definitely what we think – no matter how hard we struggle to understandatoms, those same features seem to be at work in the cosmos as a whole.ON THE LARGE SCALE.Right.THEN IT COMES BACK TO THE HUMAN LOOKING OUT AT THE STARS ANDSAYING, ‘IF THERE ARE MULTIPLE PARALLEL UNIVERSES, THEN THERE MUSTBE MULTIPLES OF US IN PARALLEL UNIVERSES, OR AT LEASTCONSCIOUSNESS.Yeah, it’s a lot of fun to think about!”More Information:For further reports about astronomical and cosmic mysteries, please see other reportsbelow in the Earthfiles Archive:• 10/11/2007 — Carancas, Peru Meteorite Could Be 10 Tons• 09/26/2007 — Meteorite Fell in Carancas, Peru - Not Satellite• 01/07/2007 — Universe's Mysterious Dark Matter - First 3-D Map• 12/31/2006 — Part 8: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"• 12/15/2006 — Stardust Comet Mission Reports New Kind of Organics• 12/08/2006 — NASA Wants Permanent Moon Base by 2024• 12/01/2006 — Deep Impact and Stardust: Are Comets Made of the Same Stuff?• 06/29/2005 — July 3-4, 2005: NASA \"Deep Impact\" Spacecraft to Blast Hole in Comet Temple I• 04/20/2005 — Outer Space Impact At Serpent Mound, Ohio, 256 Million Years Ago• 04/01/2005 — What's Killing Off Marine Life Every 62 Million Years?• 03/20/2005 — Astronaut John Young: \"The Moon Can Save Earth's Civilization.\"• 02/17/2005 — Iapetus and Enceladus: Baffling Moons of Saturn• 01/13/2005 — NASA \"Deep Space\" Craft Will Hit Comet On July 4, 2005• 06/25/2004 — Wild 2, An Amazing Comet• 03/31/2004 — Methane on Mars - Biology?
