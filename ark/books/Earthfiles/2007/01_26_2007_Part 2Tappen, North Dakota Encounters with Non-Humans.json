Evan said amid the shadows, he couldsee \"a couple of things going across the corral.\" His first thought was coyotes or deer goingafter feed at the pig corral next to the barn. So, Evan got dressed, went to the equipmentshed to get a gun and headed for the corral.Orange gate of pig corral. Evan went in with his .22 and shot oneof the non-human creatures dragging the dead pet sow. 1:20 a.m. - September 11, 2006,Sow Death and Disappearance Evan Briese, 16, Tappen, North Dakota: \"Grabbed my .22 rifle and walked up there. Icould hear the pigs scurrying around and one of the pigs – not sure which it was – wasriled up. I started walking up there and pretty soon there was dead silence. Completesilence. Nothing. I walked up to the (corral) gate and then I seen a couple of these thingsmessing around with my pig.WHAT MADE YOU TAKE THE .22?I was going to go out there shoot and scare out whatever it was.WHAT EXACTLY WERE YOU SEEING WITH YOUR HOG?They were messing around with her.WHAT WERE THEY DOING AND WHAT DID THEY LOOK LIKE?Fairly tall. Dark from what I could see because they pretty much had shadows cast onthem. Real skinny-looking. They had these big hands on them. I could not see what theirfeet looked like."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"First drawing by Evan after September 16, 2006,hypnosis session with Craig R.

It shines pretty much around the yard andup in the corral a little ways, so I could kind of see because when I go out there to feed mypigs at night, I can kind of see them. (Also, the moon was out that night.)WHAT DID THE HANDS LOOK LIKE?Long. With those claws on them.WHAT DID THE CLAWS LOOK LIKE?Like hooks.CURVED HOOKS OR LONG BLADES?Kind of a combination of both, really. Their hands were like hooks combined into blades.Whatever they were made for, they were made to really do some tearing, you know? Orcutting."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Evan's close-up illustration of the hands he saw on thenon-human entities in the pig corral © 2006 by Evan Briese.CAN YOU NOW REMEMBER ANYTHING YOU SPECIFICALLY SAW THESEENTITIES DOING WITH YOUR PIG?I think she was dead at that moment. I didn’t see when they killed her. Just seen when theywere kind of moving her around.WERE THEY MOVING HER AROUND WITH A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT? ORDRAGGING HER? OR WHAT?The creatures were using those claw blades on their hands. I think they were hooking her(sow) and pulling her. That's when I walked to the corral gate. I don’t know what drove meto do it, but I jumped in there (corral) right away and shot one of them. It kind of hoppedaround and made this funny noise, just a weird screech.Evan Briese, 16, showing the spot inside the pig corral where he shot the nearestcreature with his .22. The three wooden stakes stuck in the ground represent where the entities draggedoff the dead sow. At least one of four entities in front of Evan was nearly seven feet all. The missingsheet metal panel was discovered after the encounter and Evan thought it was linked to theactions of the entities. Image © Richard Moss and Lorna Hunter.WAS THE SCREECH HIGH PITCHED? LOW PITCHED?It was fairly high-pitched, but not extremely high-pitched. It was just a mixture betweenhigh pitch and low pitch - just a strange sound.WAS IT LIKE A SCREAM? OR SOMETHING ELSE?Like a holler, but kind of a high-pitched holler. Not like us humans holler when we gethurt. It was strange.WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE YOU SHOT? DID YOU HAVE EYE CONTACT? DIDTHEY LOOK AT YOU? WHAT HAPPENED?After I shot, they looked at me.SO YOU ARE STANDING HOW FAR FROM THEM?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Ten to fifteen feet from the closest one.WERE THEIR BACKS TO YOU?There was one bent over the pig, screwing around with her, and there was another thatcame up to help and the one who came up to help had his shoulder toward me. The onethat was screwing around with her had its back toward me.WHICH ONE DID YOU SHOOT?I shot the one that was standing closest to the fence, which is the one that had its shouldertoward me. Because when I walked in there, they both were startled that I was there and Ishot the one right in the side. I know I hit him because he made that noise.WHAT HAPPENED NEXT TO THAT BEING? WHAT DID HE DO?Walked around, hopped around, obviously in pain.DID THE OTHER ONE WITH THE PIG TRY TO DO ANYTHING?No, they both looked at me, and the other two. There were two more standing there. Theylooked at me. They were fairly close to me.SO THERE WERE AT LEAST FOUR THAT YOU COULD SEE IN FRONT OF YOU?I think so. I can just kind of remember bits and pieces. I can’t even remember the wholething.WERE THEY ALL THE SAME HEIGHT?From what I remember, it didn’t look like it.WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER IN TERMS OF THE HEIGHTS?I can just remember tall, probably close to 6' 9\". (Not the 8 to 9 feet reported by somemedia.)IT SOUNDS, THOUGH, THAT ONE WAS MAYBE ABOUT 7 FEET TALL AND THEOTHERS YOU THINK MIGHT HAVE BEEN SHORTER?I think so, yeah. Creatures Had Shiny Skin or ClothingDID YOU HAVE ANY IMPRESSION THAT THE TALL ENTITY OR OTHERS HAD ONANYTHING WE WOULD CALL CLOTHING?It was shiny from what I can vaguely remember.SHINY. ON THE ONE DRAGGING THE PIG? OR BOTH? OR WHAT?The one that I seen that I can vaguely remember and I don't remember which one it was.BUT THE SURFACE SEEMED TO BE SHINING?Yeah, kind of.SO THE QUESTION WOULD BE: DID IT HAVE ON SOME KIND OF ARMOR THATWAS SHINY OR IF THAT WAS THE NATURE OF WHATEVER THEY WERE?Or whatever they were wearing, yeah.

WHAT HAPPENED?There are five tears in it, like fingers. They were all placed just like a big hand. Thumb ontop because obviously whatever was grabbing me from the back - the rest of the fingerswere toward the bottom.The five slices in the Adidas T-shirt Evan was wearing on September 11, 2006,when a fifth non-human entity with curved blade-like fingers grabbed Evan from behindbefore he fell unconscious to the corral ground.

That was about it.IS THAT SCARRED? OR STILL THERE?It healed up already.SO MOST LIKELY, YOU WERE JUST ALLOWED TO COLLAPSE ON THE GROUNDAND THEY LEFT.Yes. They didn’t really want me or something. They left me there.WHEN YOU BECAME CONSCIOUS, WAS THE FIRST THING IN YOUR MIND TOLOOK FOR THE CREATURES AND YOUR PIG?First thing was to get out of there.DID YOU KNOW THEN THAT YOUR DEAD PIG WAS GONE?I didn’t know right away, no. Not until I went up there and looked. But I kind of figured soafterward because they were screwing around with her.SO, IT WENT FROM YOUR SEEING (CREATURES), SHOOTING, THE SOUND, THEARM AROUND YOU, GOING UNCONSCIOUS, WAKING UP, GOING TO YOURSISTER’S, AND RETURNING LATER WITH YOUR FAMLY?Ye s .AND THAT’S WHEN EVERYBODY DISCOVERED THAT THE SOW WAS MISSING?Ye s .AND HAS NEVER TURNED UP?Nope."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" Kidder County Sheriff InvestigatedWHAT ARE THE EVENTS THAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT?They called my dad and he came over here.

Killed Sow Was Most DocileANY OTHER SOUND BESIDES THE BEING MADE WHEN YOU SHOT IT WITHTHE .22?No, because I don’t think they were tapping into my head.THE PIG WAS DEFINITELY DEAD ON THE GROUND?Oh, definitely! If she was alive, she wouldn’t have let them touch her like that.HOW OLD WAS THAT PIG?I think she was two.WAS SHE YOURS? OR YOUR SISTER’S?She was my little sister’s.IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THE PIG THAT THESE ENTITIES KILLED THATWAS A DIFFERENT BREED? DIFFERENT BLOODLINE? ANYTHING SPECIALABOUT IT?No, the only thing different about her compared to the other ones is that she was not asfeisty. She was a very docile pig. She didn’t really fight. She never gave me any trouble.Even when I’d be chasing her, she would not get hostile with me or nothing. She was a realdocile pig. It would not be too hard to take advantage of her to kill her.WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THIS AND THESE VERY STRANGE, THINCREATURES THAT AREN’T HUMAN – WHAT DO YOU WONDER ABOUT?I don’t have an explanation.DO YOU ASSUME THEY ARE FROM SOME PLACE IN OUTER SPACE?I don’t know exactly where they are from. I know they definitely were not people. But Idon’t know where they are from.WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT UPSETS YOU THE MOST, WHAT PART UPSETSYOU THE MOST?That they were here. And what did they put that pig through? And the fact I couldn’t savethat pig. And I couldn’t get any of them.I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT FEELING. THEY WERE PETS FOR YOU AND YOURSISTERS.They were just like a cat or a dog, just as smart and just as close. I’d go out there and feedthem twice a day and scratch them all the time. Pigs are not stupid. They are smart.Supposed to be smarter than dogs. Yeah, they were just like pets. They were my bestbuddies.\" October 24, 2006 -After Sow Death and Disappearance,Neighbor's Sheep Buck MutilatedSix weeks later on Tuesday, October 24, 2006, a neighbor within ten miles of the Briesefarm was stunned to find dead his prized sheep buck used for breeding. He said the buckand all his sheep were fine the night before when he checked on them. But the nextmorning, the sheep buck was dead without signs of struggle or tracks around his body.There was no blood anywhere."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The death was so puzzling that the neighbor took his dead sheep buck to the veterinarianfor a necropsy. The vet opened the animal up and could not find anything wrong with thelungs, heart or stomach. That's when the vet discovered that one testicle had beenremoved. A precise cut had been made on the bottom of the scrotum and one testicle hadbeen pulled out and excised straight across surgically. Official cause of death: unexplained.Torrey Briese: \"Who would go out and remove one of the testicles in somebody’spasture on one of their dead sheep? It doesn’t even make sense. It’s just something thatdoesn’t happen. And what would do that?\" December 5, 2006 - Boar PigDisappears from Briese Pig CorralThen on December 5, 2006, the big, boar pig in the Briese pig corral disappeared. Thefamily searched for a long time, but the boar has never returned. They began with six andnow all that's left is one adult sow and three young pigs.Torrey Briese: \"IF WE ARE DEALING WITH CREATURES FROM OUTER SPACE,AS SEVERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS HAVE SAID TO ME, WHAT DOYOU THINK?I guess I am assuming they would have to come from outer space because I don’t knowwhere else they would come from. What does it make me think? I’m not in a panic aboutit. I guess I’m a Christian, but I didn’t see anywhere in the Bible where it says that God didnot make other worlds. All he is concerned about in creation is this world. So, it doesn’tbother me. Am I afraid? No, I’m not afraid. A little concerned, yeah, I’m concerned andworried why and how come? Why are they taking these animals? Are they experimentingwith them? Are they studying? You’d think, if they’ve been doing this that long, theywould have learned enough. Or are they using them for some reason? But for what? Howcan a person even speculate?IF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS KNOWN ABOUT THIS FORAT LEAST 60 YEARS AND HAS CHOSEN A POLICY OF DENIAL ABOUT IT, WHATIS YOUR REACTION?My reaction is that the government doesn't think that people could handle the truth if itwas going on. Since this incident here got out into the news, there have been a lot ofpeople in the area who are very afraid. A lot of people can’t handle the idea of havingsomething go on that can’t be understood or controlled. It’s out of their control and it’sunknown. They can’t deal with that, they don’t want to. I guess that’s my philosophy. Idon’t know why the U. S. government would cover it up. Or are they covering up theirinability to control it? Or stop it?YET, NONE OF THAT CHANGES OR STOPS THE FACT THAT MUTILATIONS ANDDISAPPEARING ANIMALS HAVE BEEN GOING ON DECADE AFTER DECADE,YEAR AFTER YEAR, AROUND THE WORLD.Yes, that’s true.
