The first was sent to me on July 1, 2007, from Joe Schumacher, a retiredcomputer engineer now living in Las Vegas, Nevada. The second was sent to me on July 6,2007, from Arthur A. Reyes, Ph.D., Information and Computer Science, now teaching atthe University of Texas-Arlington in a non-tenured position.1) From: Joe Schumacher, Computer EngineerSubject: Drone commentsDate: July 1, 2007To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comHello Linda,I thought I might add my \"two cents worth\" to the debate in progress regardingthe various drone sightings.I retired some years ago, but my background includes 8 years specializing inelectronic countermeasures in the USAF followed by 20 years working as alarge systems field engineer and programmer for one of the so-called \"Big 3\"computer companies.What prompted me to write was the description by Isaac regarding softwarebeing integral to hardware and all of the various components being activatedwithin a \"field.\" The description reminded me of preliminary work we haddone to eliminate the miles of wiring required to interconnect the massivecomputer systems and peripheral networks I dealt with during my computercareer. For instance, in the headquarters of a large banking network, you mighthave 3 large central systems parallel processing and checking each othersresults, 200 or more tape and disk drives on floors above and below, andthousands of communication links to the rest of the world simultaneouslysending and receiving data. You can imagine the amount of cables required ifall the components had to be physically linked.I have been out of the industry for some time so I do not know how systemspresently connect, but our preliminary experiments used a small centralprocessor with both RF and infrared laser communications to broadcast whatIsaac described as a \"field.\"This controlling CPU had redundant mates, and it performed multiplefunctions. For instance, movement sensed within the field initiated scans ofemployee identification badges to confirm their authorization to be there, butit's primary function was to awaken additional parts of the full computingcapability as workload required additional resources. Typically, a processingunit might be accumulating a large amount of data requiring access to storagemedia so the \"field\" CPU then awakened another multiplexor handlingperipheral data exchange. Once awakened, the unit announced itself in the\"field\" and then communicated directly with all the other units, assuming ashare of the production work in progress. Conversely, when workloaddiminished, the central CPU also sent \"sleep\" signals to various units. It's a firststep toward the system Isaac describes since it eliminates miles of wiring"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"between individual units; they need only connection to main power with avery low power consumption CMOS circuit in \"standby\" awaiting a \"wake up\"signal from the \"field.\"The nearest we got to integrating software within units utilized PROM chipswhich could be reprogrammed on the fly by the central CPU when upgradeswere required. To achieve the system described by Isaac where a unit could bebroken into parts and still function, we would need units reduced to themolecular level, but nano technology may soon allow it.CARET Q4-86 Research Report, December 1986, Palo Alto, California,by Palo Alto Caret Laboratory (PACL) Staff: \"Fig. 4.3, Top-view shot of the I-beamsegments\" on Page 8. Isaac explained symbols function as self-activatingsoftware/hardware when instruments are placed in extraterrestrial field.Field is not defined. Document provided by \"Isaac.\"Regarding the various configurations of drones, it appears that the powersource relates to use of circular accelerators similar to atom smashers. Thecentral ring alone is apparently sufficient to power the first models pictured,but I noted that more circular assemblies were added as the complexity ofconfigurations expanded with additional modules. In the maximumconfiguration thus far captured on film, there is a dual circular module addedbetween 2 modules added to the central ring, and the forward assembly alsohas another large circular module possibly powering the 4 boom assemblies.The thought of an atom smasher arose because I noted the circular assemblieshave enlarged sections in the positions where we typically use magnetic pulsesto accelerate particle streams.As to the antenna array atop, it might serve as an accumulator for electrons orphotons required in driving the craft, but it is also reminiscent of aconfiguration I once noted while in the service which had to do with aninteresting transmitter known as a \"deception generator.\" If your aircraftsensed a \"lock on\" by enemy fire control, the unit modified the incoming signalto indicate a position opposite to any evasive maneuvers you might take, andthe antenna oriented itself to return the signal in the direction of it's strongestreception point from the sender. You can imagine what would happen if youwere at treetop level, doing about Mach 1, a fighter behind you had turnedcontrol of his aircraft over to weapons computers, and you initiated a steepclimb - if the pilot could not quickly take control from targeting computers, hemight find himself abruptly meeting the ground. The unique shape of theantenna elements suited it well for the purpose; highly directional when usedto transmit a return signal, but also receiving well from all directions.The big question becomes; what is the purpose of the craft? When I first sawthe Chad pictures, they reminded me of the sensor configuration found insome metal detectors. I imagined that there might be a Mr. Spock aboard whoturned to Captain Kirk and said \"sensors indicate the planet is class M withabundant resources.\"The cage assembly hanging below looks ominous. It reminds me of themachines where kids deposit a quarter and try to pickup a toy with a grapplinghook. I think I'll stay undercover while outside in the future."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"In any event, I thought it worthwhile to comment. If we all contributepossibilities, we might resolve the mystery.Many thanks for your efforts on our behalf,Joe SchumacherLas Vegas, NV 2) From: Arthur A. Reyes, Ph.D.,Information and Computer ScienceSubject: \"Isaac\" is credible & his \"language\" merits research.Date: July 6, 2007To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comI read all the content at Isaac's website carefully. I share with yousome of my thoughts about it, especially the \"language\": I feel Isaac'sdiagrammatic notation is more important than any other aspect of hiswebsite or this emerging story.A Little About MeI have served as a senior lecturer or assistant professor in thedepartment of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Texasat Arlington continuously since 1999. I earned a Ph.D. in Information &Computer Science from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) in1999 and a Bachelor of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering fromPolytechnic University in 1987. I worked as an engineer on the B-2bomber for Northrop in Pico Rivera (Los Angeles) from 1987 to 1992. Ingraduate school I researched tools & methods for software engineering,including programming languages, expert systems, & various diagrammaticnotations. I now teach senior & first-year graduate courses insoftware engineering, advise undergraduate students regarding theiracademic progress each term, and help direct the university's AutonomousVehicles Laboratory.My following comments do not represent the University of Texas-Arlington,but are my personal observations based on a long-time engineering andcomputer science career.Isaac Is Credible.I find Isaac's writing style and the content of his narrative to beconsistent with that of a knowledgeable and experienced engineer orengineering manager. Isaac's use of jargon such as \"big-O notation\",\"context-sensitive languages\", \"style manuals\", \"workflow\", thedistinction between software and hardware, etc., is correct, concise &insightful. I find nothing in Isaac's narrative to indicate fiction.However I find it humorous that he picked the pseudonym \"Isaac\", whichmeans \"he will laugh\".Isaac's Extraterrestrial Computer TechnologyIsaac states that the extraterrestrial computer is a homogeneous solidmaterial that upon (much) closer inspection is actually a holographicarray of processing elements. I believe Isaac is providing a vaguedescription of what Ray Kurzweil describes in his book The Singularityis Near: When Humans Transcend Biology © 2006, as the ultimate expressionof a computer: a quantum computing material that is precisely organized at thesubatomic level & higher.The Singularity Is Near:"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"When Humans Transcend Biology© 2006 by Ray Kurzweil.Click here for amazon.com.In the type of computational material that Kurzweil references, everyquantum metric, e.g., speed, position, spin, etc. of every particle canbe used to store information. If I recall correctly, one cubiccentimeter of this computing material would be at least as intelligentas a human being and would consume no energy, except very minute amountsto reset the input & output pins. The implications of this technologyare explored at length in Kurzweil's book.Isaac's \"Language\"Isaac describes a diagrammatic \"language\" or notation that is innatelyfunctional and operates by utilizing some universal principle. Whatcould this universal principle be? Kurzweil's book references the workof several theoretical physicists who believe the fabric of the universeis not continuous, but divided into discrete elements. Specifically,they see the fabric of spacetime as working like a cellular automaton,which is an array of cells in which the contents of any cell at anypoint in time is determined by the contents of adjacent cells accordingto a small set of simple rules. Note that in cellular automata, time &movements occur in discrete steps, like the moves in a board game. Ifthe universe is really a computer, then there should be ways to programit. Isaac's \"language\" could be a way of doing so.If Isaac's diagrammatic notation utilizes some universal principle tofunction, then I would guess that sacred geometry and alchemical notationsare actually dim recollections of how this principle was applied inearlier, more advanced civilizations. It's interesting to note that theconcept of such diagrammatic notations is finding its way into thepopular mind, e.g., the animated series Full Metal Alchemist depicts thecharacters making \"alchemist circles\" in which they stand to performalchemical operations. Full Metal Alchemist takes place in another worldwhere alchemy is the high science.\"If viewers have more information about the dragonfly-drone phenomenon, please email meat earthfiles@earthfiles.comFor further information about Issac, the CARET document and the dragonfly-droneeyewitnesses and images, please see the Earthfiles reports below filed under Environment:• 07/10/2007 — 2005 and 2006 Memphis \"Drones\"?• 06/29/2007 — Another \"Drone\" This Week Near Maxwell AFB• 06/26/2007 — Part 1: Explanation of the Recent \"Strange Craft\" Sightings• 06/26/2007 — Part 2: Documentation, Palo Alto Caret Laboratory Q4-86 Research Report• 06/22/2007 — Dragonfly \"Drone\" Seen October 1995 in Arizona• 06/17/2007 — More Big Basin, California, Bizarre \"Drone\" Images• 06/15/2007 — Part 2 - Star Wars Physicist Edward Teller, Outer Space Menace And Remotely PilotedVe hi c l e s ( RPVs )• 06/08/2007 — More Drone Photos and Other Eyewitnesses• 05/30/2007 — Birmingham-Type \"Drone\" Seen At Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, in Mid-1980s• 05/28/2007 — Letters About Unidentified \"Drone\" Aerial Objects• 05/25/2007 — Two More Eyewitnesses of Aerial \"Drones\" in 2005 and 2006• 05/21/2007 — Updated: Odd Aerial \"Drone\"?
