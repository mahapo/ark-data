That night on Coast to Coast AM with George Noory, I also reported aboutthe Tappen, North Dakota, cattle ranch family that have had an extraordinary series ofevents occur since October 2005.Farmers in Tappen, with a current population of about 200 people, have been challengedby mysterious deaths and disappearances of livestock. One of those families is Myra andTorrey Briese, both in their late forties, who have lived in Tappen all their life. Their fivechildren are Tessa 23, Trista 20, Evan 16, Tia 11 and Marshel 3.Myra and Torrey Briese family, photographed January 21, 20007.Sitting L-R: Trista, Tia, Evan, and Marshel. Standing L-R: Tessa, Myra and Torrey.Image © 2007 by Laurie Jablonski.In October 2005, high strangeness descended. Torrey Briese found one of his cows deadthat coyotes would not touch. In April 2006, 16-year-old Evan encountered a wedge-shaped craft emitting blue beams at the water pond not far from the dead cow. Afterward,the Brieses found an odd disc-shaped pattern cut into the dead cow's hair. By June, TorreyBriese and one of his neighbors watched a blue light make right angles in a midnight sky asif looking for something. In August, Torrey and the family saw several lights over theirranch making a grid pattern as if searching.Then on September 11, 2006, Evan encountered tall, thin, non-human creatures in the pigcorral dragging off his sister's dead, pet sow. A couple of weeks later, a neighbor raisingsheep found his breeding buck mysteriously dead without signs of blood, tracks or struggle.A veterinarian was hired to do a necropsy and found that one of the testicles had beensurgically removed through a straight line in the bottom of one testicle sac. On December5, 2006, a large male boar disappeared from the Briese pig corral.After my January 26th Earthfiles and Coast news updates about the extraordinary Tappen,North Dakota, events, I have received hundreds of emails from viewers and listeners whohave also encountered lights, craft and creatures. In this Part 1, and subsequent reports, Iam sharing some of those many emails without name attribution. My hope is that otherswill come forward with firsthand experiences about interactions with non-humans. Myemail address is: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.

It sounds like a crediblestory. You asked for people to come forward with their stories. I have debatedthis in my mind, but I think I need to tell you what has happened to me.In the last five years, I have experienced some major changes in my body andmy life. Whatever happened to me as a child has manifested now. I feel as ifsomething inside me has been awakened. Here is my story. This is circa early1970s in the days of Bobby Orr and the Big Bad Bruins:When I was a kid, I played ice hockey (still do). My friend, Jackie, slept overone night and my father was driving both of us to the rink at 5:30 in themorning for our practice. We got dressed in our equipment (except skates) anduniforms. My father went out to start the car and then he came back in. Whenwe were ready, he sent us out to put our equipment in the car. We went out tothe door and were putting our bags in the trunk when we looked up in the sky.Above our heads no more than 100 feet was a flying craft. We could see thebottom of it and it looked like panels formed together. It was shaped like theletter D. The flat side of the D was the front of the craft. There were brilliantwhite lights emanating in front of it. No other lights. It was moving incrediblyslow.Jackie and I were afraid and jumped into the back seat of the vehicle. Iremember looking out the windshield and seeing the houses and backyard alllit up with white light. Eventually, we saw the craft still moving slowly in thesame direction. Eventually, it went over the distant tree line and out of view.The event sent me on an interesting path. I became very interested in spaceand science fiction. I saw my second UFO when I was in the car driving onthe highway a few years later. I was in the backseat and I was looking out thewindow at a light in the sky. I kept watching it and eventually my mother,who was in the back seat, started looking in the same direction trying to figureout what had captured my attention. Suddenly, the light, which was probablyfive to ten miles in the distance, shot across the sky in an instant. It appearedfar to our right. It must have covered 10-15 miles in one or two seconds. Thatmeans about 180,000 miles in an hour. That's fast. I asked my mother if shesaw it and she said yes.\"2) Medina, Texas - 1970s - Female\"I really enjoyed your interview with the sixteen year old boy in North Dakotaand the pictures of his farm. What a brave young man who came to thedefense of his animals. I pray those entities will leave him and his familyalone. And leave ALL of us alone!Want to tell you about a mysterious object I saw at the ranch back in the1970s. I was on the screened-in porch looking up the north draw towards theold chicken house, about half a football field, or less, away. I saw a brightlycolored object with many pretty lights on it resting on the ground. It wasmaybe 12 feet high, a balloon-shape on top appeared to be attached to asquare shaped base. Thought it must be a weather balloon and I'd investigate itlater. The ranch was on land in Medina, TX and is no longer in the family. Itwas about 10 miles out of town and was over 600 acres.\"3) East Lansing, Michigan - July 1960s - Female 9 to 10-years-old\"Please allow me to relate to you an experience I had as a 9 or 10 year-oldchild. My neighborhood abutted a series of undeveloped farm fields inMichigan. We kids made a baseball diamond in a clearing, and there werevarious paths and trails through the surrounding woods, much favored bychildren out to escape parental control or boredom. On a humid July day inthe early 1960s, I took a walk in that area, following a path down a ditch, onmy way to the woods.Always fascinated by nature and wild animals, I thought I knew every birdand beast that frequented the Michigan wilds. Some movement on the otherside of a very dense brush made me stand stock still to see what it couldbe. Instead of an animal or human, a being with leathery grey skin came outof the brush ... it seemed to materialize rather than have to part thebranches to approach me."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The being was about the same height as I was, 3 - 4 feet tall, what I now cancall a typical Grey, though at the time it was totally unlike anything Iever remembered seeing. The being was of a gentle and friendly demeanor.S/he had large, slanted, black, shiny eyes. It communicated to metelepathically, told me it had been my friend for a long time.As the shock of seeing it wore off, my natural curiosity overcame my fear.I asked the being where it was from. It responded: 'From here, from thisEarth.' I asked if I might touch the being's skin, and it allowed me totouch its forearm. It felt like I thought a shark's skin would have felt:thick and leathery, but pliable. Then I did something very childish: I stucka finger directly into one of the being's eyes !It reacted with pain, flinching away. I stammered 'I'm Sorry! I thought theymight be sunglasses' -- only half truthfully. I was genuinely dismayed thatI had caused pain to this being. I had not been convinced it was reallyalive until then.Then it telepathically gave me a long conversation. It asked me if I wascurious to see a different kind of creature, one I had never met before. Isaid yes. The being told me to follow close behind it, and it proceeded intoa different part of the woods than I usually went.We came to a hummocky area where a tree had fallen, and some sunlightfiltered down to the ground. At first I saw nothing but the trees andvegetation undergrowth. The Grey stood by me, and before I saw the othercreature, my friend said s/he would protect me from being permanentlydamaged by what I would see next. My mind raced, and I asked if it was thesight of the other creature which could damage me: the answer was yes.I looked over at the fallen tree, and saw a small swirl of fog or dust,beginning to take form into some solid being. Like a blast of searing painthrough my forehead, my mind perceived an intelligence more powerful thanmyGrey friend, which my human eyes could not focus on or describe in any way.The new creature was so alien to anything I had ever encountered, that thebrain failed to register it as any corporal form that could be described.There was an incredibly strong mental blast of evil and hatred for the humanrace coming from the new entity. My eyes wept and I fell to my knees andthen covered my face and cowered to the ground. Time seemed to speed up.The new creature told me things which were to happen in the future.My best friend was to die in a car crash before he reached adulthood. Iprotested and wept. The creature told me that I would not have any childrenof my own. I screamed at it that it was wrong, that it was a liar, and wept inpain. The entity reveled in my despair.Then a telepathic disagreement broke out between my friend the Grey and theother entity. In a split second, a heavy mental veil fell over my mentalprocesses, and I was shielded from any further contact from the evil entity.My Grey friend led me back down the path, until I could find my way backhome.There you have it: my recollection of an encounter with two differentspecies of trans-dimensional beings. Needless to say, despite my protests,the events predicted by the evil entity did occur. My best friend died at theage of 19, in a car crash. I am in my fifties now and do not plan to havechildren. Whether that idea was my own or was planted by another, I leave upto speculation.\"4) Englewood, Colorado - January 15 to 16, 2007 - Adult Male\"Just last week probably the 15th or 16th of Jan, 2007, I was brushing myteeth and looking out our bathroom window. So it must have been about 9PM, I saw this craft w/ this extremely bright light on the part facing me. It wasso bright I almost had to shield my eyes. I opened my window to see if I couldhear anything - thinking search helicopter. There was absolutely no noise. Itwas zigzagging fairly slowly at a low altitude meandering northward at a(probable) distance of a half mile to a mile away. When it would turn morenorth, I could see that it was triangular and had dimmer lights on each of theopposite ends.I yelled for my wife, but she didn't get there in time to see anything. Because"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"it was just too far away by then and we have lots of trees around us.I have also seen a circular craft that I could probably have hit with a rock. Itwas as big around as a 1200 sq ft house but only about 4 to 5 ft thick in thecenter which was a dome that was possibly a yard in diameter. The craftnarrowed to about a foot-thick at the edges. I seriously doubt if a human couldhave been piloting. It came right down the center of the rooftops at treetoplevel. It was on the east side of the block. I was throwing newspapers and itwas about 4 AM December of 1999. This one made no noise and came in veryrapidly and slowed rapidly to less than 5 miles an hour. Basically floating. Itwas ringed w/ flashing type of lights. I was at a dead end so I could not followit. I guess I got a little creeped out when it made an adjustment to it's directionit was going. When it did it simply went in another direction - but nothingturned.\"5) Anonymous Source\"I wanted to describe two different instances where I believe to have hadcontact with greys, two different type of greys from my recollection. To thisday it almost seems as if it never happened. I think back to those instancesand kind of ask myself if I was dreaming, if indeed it really happened for itnow seems a bit like a blur.The first instance happened two years before the second. I was up late, whichof course always seems to be the case. I was chatting with a friend using achat program. Nothing else was on - no lights, no tvs, no radios, the only lightavailable was the computer monitor. After awhile online, I started hearingwhat sounded like tapping. The tapping was more or less like someone tappingtheir fingers on a hard surface. I looked around the room which was fairlyopen and saw nothing. I did not think to look directly behind me. Buteventually I found myself having to do just that.On the other side of the room between the front door and the steps that led tothem, I saw what looked like at first to be a floating mask. I found it odd andcontinued to stare at it. It seemed roughly to be about three feet off theground. I then came to the conclusion as to what it was when my sightchanged to the wall directly to the side. I saw what looked like fingers andthey where moving as if gripping the side of the entrance. The mask moved abit and I froze. I continued to stare and it continued to stare back as well. Iasked myself what it was doing and why it was there? After a few moreminutes, I got the nerve to turn around. When I turned to look back again itwas gone. This was the first time. I believe it to be a small grey.The second time around was two years later and yet again I was at thecomputer. I noticed out of the corner of my eye that where was flashing goingon in my kitchen. I had no lights on and the lights in the kitchen where off. Iwrote it off as lightning, but when I looked out the window I saw no clouds.Turning to get a better look, I was about to get up and see what was giving thelight show. It was the back yard, so I suspected it could not be a police car orany other emergency vehicles. As I went to get up, I saw something move inthe door way and it seemed the lights had stopped. I this time instead offreezing grabbed up something. I can't remember what it was and wasprepared to defend myself for I thought I was being robbed. But what I gotinstead was this tall skinny grey just as tall as the doorway. It stepped rightinto the doorway and it looked at me. Its expression looked as if it was angryas if it had a really angry glare. Unlike the first time, I did not freeze andinstead was deciding how to handle the situation. But as I did this, it took astep back and faded into the darkness - no flashes, no noises, it was just gone.I got the nerve to walk into the kitchen and flip the light switch and indeed itwas not there.What I don't understand is why neither the small rounded-face grey nor thetall sharp angry looking grey did anything, just stared.\"6) Vine Grove, Kentucky (near Fort Knox) - 1965 to 1966 - Female 13 to 14- Years-Old\"When I was a teenager in the the 1960s we lived near Fort Knox, Kentucky.It was little rural town, Vine Grove. I was about 13 or 14 so it was about 1965or 1966. I don't remember exactly date now but I do remember the encounter.I have not really talked about it since then.My friend and neighbor and her brother and I were walking around theneighborhood at just about dark time (not much to do there, very rural area).Anyway we were just walking and talking and were close to our homes. All of"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"a sudden there was an object just over our heads, just a little higher than thethe light poles. It made no noise at all. It was round with lights around anddome on top. We could see that it was some type of aircraft. It just stoppedabove us and was stationary but still made no sound. It scared us to death! Weall had lived near military bases and were familiar with military aircraft andthis was nothing we had seen before. I think there was some being in thedome. It was dark but I could see movement in it.My friend and her brother ran to her home to get their parents and I stayed fora few minutes and watched the object. It moved slightly and then aimed abeam of light in the open field behind our homes, still no sound. When it didthat, I ran home and got my parents. By the time our parents got outside it wasgone and no trace of it in the sky. Our parents knew we really saw somethingstrange because we were so frightened.My father worked at Fort Knox and one of the Generals was a good friend ofmy father. So the next day Daddy asked him about any military things thatmay have been in the area. He checked, but nothing was suppose to be there.Anyway I just wanted to tell someone about this. I have always wonderedwhat we saw.\"7) Lake Tahoe, California - Summer 1980 - Adult Male\"In the summer of 1980 while traveling to Lake Tahoe from June Lake, mygirl friend and I saw a large UFO - larger than a 747 airliner - just north ofMono Lake a quarter mile off Hwy 395. It was saucer-shaped with blue andorange colored lights. As we got close, it vanished, except that we lost 15-20minutes or more.I woke up on the top of the pass driving towards Bridgeport, California, notknowing how I got there after what had to be a 15 mile drive. I was freakedout! I was driving and refused to stop. Everything looked spooky and I wasscared to death. It took me until Topaz Lodge on the border of Nevada andCalifornia to calm down.We told some people, but they thought we where nuts. So, then we decidednot to contact the Military. My mind was so clouded until the following day.Two months later my girl friend Debbie got extremely ill, and was in a coma inMammoth Hospital for 10 days. They discovered an unknown virus in herbone marrow. They treated it like encephalitis, but it didn't work. They couldnot isolate what is was - it kept eating the glucose in her bone marrow. Finally,she got better.In Sept of 2006, I saw blue white orbs above San Clemente, California. Atfirst there was 2 than 5 then 0 then up to 8 then a triangle formed. Theylooked like they where having fun, they then just disappeared. Later thatnight, a family in Dana Point had these objects above their house doing thesame thing. They reported that to UFON.In Orange and San Diego counties, I have seen big holes in the clouds likewhat you described! I have seen more different types of UFOs over SanClemente, including a diamond-shaped object over TRW in 1997. Also I haveseen 3 lights that looked like a beam of energy transferred from two objectsinto one and then disappeared. That was also above TRW area in 1998.I also lived in Fallbrook for 5 years where I saw a jet fighter chasing a smallred object at under 10,000 feet. The jet came from Miramar Base and chasedit over Camp Pendleton (Marine Base north of San Diego) in 2001. As it gotso close, the object just turned left and was gone over the ocean in a blink ofan eye. The jet shut down the after burners and turned back towards Miramar.In 2001 to 2003, I saw two barbell-shaped UFOs in the same place over a yearand half apart. The first one my wife watched it through binoculars. It wasthere 10 minutes, then it just faded in to thin air. The same area a year and ahalf later, same shaped object in same spot, except I heard a large military jet- probably a Wart Hog from Miramar - getting closer. As the sound camecloser, the object just blended into the sky and vanished.I will end with when I was 3-years-old 1957 to 1958, there was a crash ofsome sort in New Jersey near Livingston. (I looked for it on the Internet butcould not find anything.) My dad took me there. I remember it looked likesilver pieces on the side of a hill off the turnpike. My Dad had a PHD inphysics and worked for Westinghouse at the time. All I remember is the silver"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"shiny pieces and he never talked about again.Losing that time in 1980 and waking up 15 miles away driving still hauntsme.\"8) Wisconsin - Date Unknown - Male 8-Years-Old\"I live in Wisconsin and I have had at least two UFO Alien experiences.When I was a little kid, around the age of eight, my friend and I used to playin a huge wooded cow pasture that did have a large forest-like area. We hadseen a few things that we couldn’t explain from time to time. We sometimesfelt like we weren’t alone, but didn’t think much of it. Then one morning wehad a life changing experience that changed my life forever.It was a nice summer day, normal like many summer days - nothing wasabnormal. My friend and I were in the woods exploring and climbing aboutthe fallen logs in a wooded are. We had been here before.All the sudden we became captivated by a vibrating and low humming sound. The was buzzing like it was electric. We were both scared and aware thatsomething was going on. We were both powerless to do anything. Our abilityto flee was frozen, we were frozen, and suddenly we both were undercomplete control of something up in the tip top tree area. Our vision wastotally impaired, we couldn’t run. We were frozen, yet aware of the buzzing,and knew we were under control of something very powerful, not of thisearth. We couldn’t see what it was. I was terrified and paralyzed with the most fear Ihad ever experienced. We were informed that we were not going to be hurt,and we would only be a little bit uncomfortable. Whatever the thing was that had kidnapped us, assured me we would not behurt. Whatever this thing was, it was not speaking out loud, but it wascommunicating telepathically. I could feel it was deep inside my mind. I felt ithad wisdom and age far beyond anything of this planet. There was no doubt Iwas in for an experience that I had no control of. I was terrified.This thing was doing an examination of me and something was going on withmy genitals. It seemed that there were others aliens present. I screamed andstruggled in terror and I went into like a drug induced coma. I was powerlessto run, scream, or do anything.For the alien it was just like business as usual. They had a job to do, and theywere going to complete the assignment. They proceeded in a very coldmanner, like they had done all this stuff many times before. The beings werenot doctors, but they were doing 'doctor-like-procedures.'I was told that the more I struggled, the longer these procedures would take. Eventually I became more comatose, like I was given more of whatever it wasthat was paralyzing me. I was totally powerless.Mentally I was still aware of the telepathic communication among the beingsdoing the procedures. It was all very medical like. I was relaxed. I couldn’tmake out what the beings were conversing about telepathically. Some of thebeings, one or two I think were female. They were mentally speaking alanguage, not spoken on this planet. The language was alien and they werespeaking telepathically!!! There was no doubt. I could hear them!The beings were very kind and reassuring. All was going well, I told that Iwas a good patient, and soon this would be all over. I think a female wascommunicating with me now. I was not so terrified, I started to believe theabductors. After all they haven’t given me any reason to not believe anythingthey told me. I felt that they had a wisdom and powers way beyond anything people of thisplanet were ever aware of.Later that evening, my buddy and I awoke out of a drug-like induced coma. We laid on the ground trying to regain our faculties. This took hours. We laynear each other, tired and unable to function normally yet. We were aware ofour earthly environment now. The ordeal was now over ...or was it?Twelve hours ago, my buddy and I were playing around at 8:00 PM; it wasnow 8:30 PM. Now, we are mangled physically, and hung over from an alien"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"medical examination. We both knew a lot had gone on.Neither I nor my buddy could speak for what seemed to be an eternity. Whatever it was that had examined us, was gone now. We were close to thespot where we had been abducted. We didn’t say much. I was wondering whatI would say to my parents. I did not know if I had been gone for hours, daysor weeks. I knew I had been somewhere, and something strange hadhappened. Something strange had happened, but how do you explainsomething not of this earth? Who would believe a kid like me?We were both very tired and hungry. Unknown to us, we looked like we hadbeen through the wringer. We slowly walked back to the residential areawhere we both lived. It was a struggle for me to walk. My crotch hurt, myhead hurt, my eyes hurt. Something had been down my throat. My belly-button area was very painful. Something had protruded into my belly-buttonand it hurt a lot. Later there was evidence of blood and bruising in theabdomen and belly button area. My whole body hurt. I wanted to cry, but Iwas unable.I knew the adults would be adding more to my pain. No, the worst was notover. Soon the inquisition would start. As tired and beat-up as I was; it wouldbe hours more before I could finally rest, in a heap, and have some peace. This had been a very bad dream, I thought; but it wasn’t a dream. It was areal life terrifying nightmare.Both of us had suffered a bloody nose and our faces hurt. Both of us hadblood-shot eyes, so red that we both received a medical examination thefollowing day. I think my buddy first went for the medical exam that night.Our parents were furious with us. My buddies’ parents had called the police.Now we were separated, nobody believed our stories. The adults seemed toget angrier, the more I attempted to tell the truth. I had been molested bysomething not of this world. My account is real, I am not making any of thisup. Keep up the good work. Like they say, the truth is out there.\"Continued in Part 2.More Information:For further information about the UFO phenomenon, please see reports below: inEarthfiles Archives and in my books and documentaries listed in the Earthfiles Shop:• 02/07/2007 -- Part 11: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 01/30/2007 -- Part 10: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 01/16/2007 -- Part 9: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 01/02/2007 -- Grey Aerial Disk Reported by Chicago O'Hare United Airlines Pilots and Mechanics• 12/27/2006 -- Part 7: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 12/18/2006 -- Part 6: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 12/14/2006 -- Abductee Jim Sparks's Encounter with Reptillian Beings, Their Warning and Possible Agenda• 12/11/2006 -- Part 5: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 12/06/2006 -- Part 4: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 11/28/2006 -- Part 2: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 11/27/2006 -- Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue © 1957 by Leonard H.
