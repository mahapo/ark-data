I photographed a lot of strange things, some of which may be ofinterest to you.I wish to remain anonymous, however I will let you know my background. Iam a Managing Director of two companies in the UK and in my spare time, Ilike to search for strange terrain features or anomalies, (Geoglyphs,) both onthe ground and using satellite imagery (normally Google Earth). Significantly Iam interested in the Chalk Down areas of England where artificial picturescould have been cut into them, (such as White Horses), but then over timehave become hidden by turf and vegetation. By processing satellite images ofthe chalk features, typically by adjusting contrast, ancient markings can berevealed.This is how I became to be interested in the Alton Barnes area of Wiltshire.The range of chalk hills, slightly north of there, (Milk Hill, Golden Ball Hilletc) exhibits some very strange features when viewed from altitude. Thesegeological features seem very artificial on a grand scale. Also there is a lot ofstrange markings in the fields here that can be viewed by using the sameprocess, (these could have been made by anyone.

This is where it gets weird, and of course questionable.The ground pictures appeared to show light anomalies where outlines ofshapes can can be seen, but nothing visible is present. So I decided to go backto take some more pictures on July 17th.This time military helicopters were overflying this area, and also an RAFNimrod surveillance plane over flew it. I went up to Golden Ball Hill and it ishere that seemed to me to be the epicenter of the anomalies. Once up there, Idiscovered huge circular depressions on the top of the hill that are indeedstrange.

My name is Rob Gardner, and I liveon the eastern outskirts of Bristol, in Warmley. Approx 30 miles from AltonBarnes.Why do I have an interest in Crop Circles? Initially, like everyone else,curiosity. But in recent years, concern. I am a data analyst by trade,51-years-old, and totally sane. One evening 4 years ago, I stood in my backdoorway on a totally normal suburban housing estate taking a late eveningsmoke. It was about 10:30 p.m. and November. It was dark. At the bottom ofmy garden is a high wall. The other side of the wall is a public footpath and astreetlight.Out of the corner of my eye I saw something small and black fly under thestreetlight at head height. It was a millisecond before it was hidden by the wall.My senses told me it was not a bird or bat, and I was puzzled. Then this 'thing'rose vertically the other side of the wall, flew horizontally over it and droppedvertically into the shadows on my side. I was staring at a black shape in ablack shadow and then realized that it was flying directly at me.It flew straight up to within 6 inches of my face and then immediately flewvertically upwards. All changes of direction were 90 degrees.It was about half the size of a video case, had a black/grey mottled surface,made no sound, had no lights and had no wings. Whatever it was, it was simplyflying around a deserted suburban housing estate late at night with absoluteimpunity and analyzing its surroundings, me included.Ever since that event, I can watch government denials about UFOs, and shamdocumentaries and laugh. I 'know' that they are here and amongst us. I don'tneed a government to approve that knowledge. I cannot understand why thegeneral population refuses to believe that alien races are with us unless thegovernment says so? It's mind control on a massive scale.Back to the East Field circles.

From: Australian Scientist Who Requests AnonymitySubject: Lunar Phase Diagrams At East Field 2007Date: July 11, 2007To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com\"A new and very complex picture appeared in crops (wheat) at East Field inWiltshire last week (July 7, 2007). It showed three long semi-circular arcs;each of which was divided on a finer scale into a series of contiguous circles,varying smoothly in size. In addition, there was a short partial 'fourth arc,' thatwas located somewhat anomalously in the field between two long ones.Some people have interpreted East Field in terms of the Hindu religioussymbol 'Aum,' to which it does bear a superficial resemblance.\"Comparison of Aum (Om) symbol in yellow at center of Mandela wheel and the East Field100+ circle pattern that emerged on July 7, 2007, after a bright, white flash of light seen bythree eyewitnesses atop Knap Hill.

[ Editor's Note: The Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres describes the Om symbol this way: \"To a yogi, no symbol is more powerful than the syllable OM, as witnessed bythese words from the Mandukya Up-anishad: 'OM: this eternal word is all;what was, what is and what shall be.'In the Sanskrit letter, the long lower curve represents the dream state, theupper curve stands for the waking state and the curve issuing from the centresymbolizes deep, dreamless sleep. The crescent shape stands for 'maya,' theveil of illusion and the dot for the transcendental state. When the individualspirit in man passes through the veil and rests in the transcendental, he isliberated from the three states and their qualities.\" See: Sivananda YogaVedanta Centres. ]"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Australian Scientist: \"Yet I will show here by quantitative analysis, as wellas by comparison to other pictures from the Cropcircleconnector Archive, thatEast Field more probably represents a series of four lunar phase cycles,spanning the summer of 2007. Three of those four cycles begin and endnormally, whereas the fourth lunar cycle will end six days after a new Moon(possibly on August 18, 2007).An overall view of East Field 2007An overall view of the new East Field crop picture is shown below, along withlabels to help understand its 'lunar phase' interpretation:Four different arcs or lunar phase cycles were drawn there, labeled as I, II, III, IV.Cycles I and II both begin and end with tiny balls to symbolize a 'new Moon.'All graphic overlays by Australian scientist.Four different arcs or lunar phase cycles were drawn there, labeled as I, II, III,IV. Cycles I and II both begin and end with tiny balls to symbolize a 'newMoon.' At the center of each arc or cycle, one very large round ball representsa 'full Moon.' There are 29 balls within each of cycles I or II, which seemsfully consistent with a lunar phase period of 29.5 days.These new symbols as shown at East Field seem quite similar to other symbolsused in the past: notably at Stonehenge 1996, Windmill Hill 1996 or Milk Hill2001. (See: Cropcircleconnector Archive.)Cycle III (upper left in the picture above) was drawn as somewhat smallerthan the first two cycles, and hence only its brighter lunar phases (or largerballs) were included. It begins with a 'half Moon' on the left, proceeds to a 'fullMoon' at center, then ends with another 'half Moon' on the right. Other tinyballs between 'half' and 'new' were omitted, probably for technical reasons.The 'full Moon' symbol from cycle III spans just one set of tramlines, and isthus smaller than the 'full Moon' symbol from cycle II (one and one-halftramlines) or from cycle I (two tramlines). That gradient of size, along withwith a long 'tail' on the far end of cycle I, enables us to say which of thosethree cycles comes first: I (large), then II (medium), then III (small).Cycle IV at East Field seems to be the most critical element of this croppicture. Why does it end only six days after a new Moon, or nine days beforethe Moon goes to full? In order to address that question, we will need to studyeach cycle from East Field in closer detail.The problem of phasing:Which Current Lunar CyclesDoes East Field Represent?When trying to provide a calendar interpretation of East Field, the majorsource of ambiguity seems to be phasing. On what day does cycle I begin andend? On what day does cycle IV suddenly end? I have chosen to assume thatwe may be dealing here with the 'summer season of 2007,' as shown in anearlier crop picture from Yatesbury.There the summer season of 2007 was defined as proceeding for 87 days fromMay 30 to August 24. Within that approximate interval, there will be four full"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Moons on June 1, July 1, July 30 and August 28. One may therefore plausiblyassociate East Field cycle I with a full Moon on June 1, cycle II with a fullMoon on July 1, cycle III with a full Moon on July 30, and cycle IV with a fullMoon on August 28 (not yet reached).A calendar interpretation of cycles I, II and IIIWith such tentative assignments in mind, we can now interpret each of thosefour lunar cycles in terms of our modern yearly calendar. Cycle I would beginwith a new Moon on May 17, proceed to full on June 1, then end with anothernew Moon on June 15. Cycle II would begin with a new Moon on June 15,proceed to full on July 1, then end with another new Moon on July 14.\"Lunar cycle I would begin with a new Moon on May 17, proceed to full on June 1,then end with another new Moon on June 15.Lunar cycle II would begin with a new Moon on June 15, proceed to full on July 1,then end with another new Moon on July 14.\"The crop artists apparently made two errors when portraying cycle II. First,its full Moon on July 1, shows a slightly smaller size than for an almost fullMoon on July 2. Secondly, a series of tiny mini-circles appear on both sides ofcycle I wherever the Moon exceeds half-illumination. In Cycle II, thosemini-circles were drawn as extending all the way down to a new Moon on July14.Cycle III at East Field was drawn only in part, owing to its smaller size in thefield than for Cycles I and II. Following the calendar assignments used above,it would begin with a half Moon on July 22, proceed to full on July 30, thenend with another half Moon on August 7.\""},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Cycle III at East Field was drawn only in part, owing to itssmaller size in the field than for Cycles I and II.\"The lunar symbolisms used in cycle III seem quite similar to another set oflunar symbols shown at Trottiscliffe on June 20, 1999, below. At Trottiscliffe,one picture showed 'three crescent Moons,' while another showed threeoverlapping lunar phase diagrams.\"An earlier crop picture from Trottiscliffe 1999, which confirmsthese lunar phase interpretations.\"Each of those phase diagrams showed half of a 29.5-day lunar cycle:beginning with a new Moon on day 1, then proceeding to a full Moon by day14 or 15.Those two crop pictures from Trottiscliffe seem to confirm, beyond anyreasonable expectation, that the three long and one short \"arcs\" shown at EastField 2007 were truly meant to represent 'lunar phase diagrams.'A Calendar Interpretation of Cycle IVFinally we come to the very heart of our analysis, which is an anomalouslyterminated Cycle IV. It begins with a long thin 'tail' (just as for Cycle I at thefar end of East Field) that is embedded appropriately between two other 'newMoons' belonging to cycles I or II.\""},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Lunar Cycle IV w ill end si x days after a new Moon: August 13 to 18, 2007?\"But instead of proceeding all the way to a full Moon as shown for Cycles Iand II on left and right, Cycle IV begins with a new Moon (presumably onAugust 13), then terminates unexpectedly after only six days before it canreach a full Moon on August 28.What could this mean? Might there be something special about a near-futuredate of August 18, 2007? A dramatic increase of cloud cover perhaps?A Related Calendar Prediction from 2005One other crop picture from 2005 also specified a near-future date ofmid-August 2007. To be more precise, Wayland's Smithy showed ahexadecimal date of '14-5-11' within our current 52-year Mayan calendar. Themajor source of ambiguity, when trying to provide a calendar interpretation,was again one of phasing.\"Wheat formation estimated to be 320 feet in diameter,reported August 9, 2005, near Wayland's Smithy burial mound (circle of trees),near county line of Oxfordshire and Wiltshire, England.Aerial image © 2005 by Steve Alexander.\"On which days might our current 52-year Mayan calendar begin and end?When counting by 365-day cycles of the Sun, that long calendar period wouldcontain a total of 52 x 365.25 = 18,993 days. On the other hand, whencounting by 584-day cycles of Venus, it would contain a total of 32.5 x 584 =18,980 which is 13 days less.So if we choose to end our current 52-year calendar on December 22, 2012(just as for the Mayan Long Count, or as shown at Silbury Hill in 2004), then it"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"could begin either on December 22, 1960 or else January 4, 1961. The formerconverts a hexadecimal date of 14-5-11 into 'August 14-17, 2007,' while thelatter converts the same date into 'August 16-19, 2007.'Neither value lies far away from August 18, 2007, as just suggested by aquantitative study of East Field. Even if our choice of phasing for East Fieldmight be one month off, still that new picture seems to say 'six days after anew Moon.'The Need for A Third Dated PictureIs something really going to happen on August 18, 2007, only a month fromnow? I don't know. It all seems rather strange. But then crop pictures arestrange, too!Let us hope that those crop circle makers will understand our natural humantendency toward cynicism, and provide us with a third or even fourth datedpicture soon.A detailed knowledge of past crop pictures seems essential, when trying tointerpret new onesWhen trying to interpret new and complex pictures such as East Field 2007, adetailed knowledge of other crop pictures from the CCC Archives 1990 to2006 seems absolutely essential, in order to understand what certain kinds ofsymbol mean.Hence, I would strongly encourage any serious students of this phenomenon tocarefully study those Archives, just as they might study a difficult academicsubject such as calculus or Chinese.
