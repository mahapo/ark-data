Mypresentation had evolved from my investigations of the worldwide animal mutilationphenomenon linked to extraterrestrial biological entities. Ranchers and other rural residentswhere the unusual animal deaths occurred had reported seeing a variety of non-humans,including \"standing up lizard or alligator,\" tall \"praying mantis\" type creatures, 5-to-6-feet-tall blond humanoids and shorter grey-skinned, large black-eyed entities. Then therewere several people in the human abduction syndrome who told me about encounters witha similar variety of entities. I had been collecting drawings from as many firsthandeyewitnesses as I could over several years. So, I decided for the first time to share thedrawings and eyewitness accounts of different non-human types at the 1992 Michiganconference.I was nervous and expected criticism because at that time, the only non-human typesgenerally discussed publicly were the small, 3.5 to 4.5-feet-tall \"greys\" with black eyes andfour, long fingers. But my investigation philosophy had always been to follow facts andeyewitness descriptions wherever they lead without trying to make answers conform to apre-selected bias of what is, or is not, acceptable reality. I had learned from my animalmutilation research that when incidents are presented publicly, other people emerge withtheir own repressed eyewitness accounts.In my Michigan conference presentation, I showed drawings of lizard and praying mantishumanoids, Bigfoot, Blond Hairs, Red Hairs, Black Hairs, Tans and a variety of Greys. Atthe end of my presentation, I asked anyone in the audience who had encountered anysimilar beings to see me afterward. There was a large surge of people around me. Somewere asking questions and others were telling me that some of the drawings were \"exactlywhat I saw, but never told anyone.\"In the clamor, I saw a thin, blond man to my right trying to push his way through thecrowd. I noticed him because he looked so frightened. He got closer and said, \"I reallyneed to talk to you.\" I asked him to wait in the back of the room. After the crowd thinned, Ifound the man and his wife sitting together. The couple asked for anonymity, so I will callthem Kenneth and Jeanne Rose, married at the time for twenty-one years. Ken was sonervous that I suggested we go find some coffee to relax. A waitress poured our cups andwhen Ken Rose tried to lift his to drink, he was shaking so badly that his cup clatteredagainst the saucer.\"Mr. Rose, what has happened? Why are you shaking?\" I asked\"Your shoes,\" he answered, pointing at me. \"Your shoes. They are the same color that Isaw on your body in a tube!\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The word \"tube\" caught my attention. I had interviewed others in the human abductionsyndrome by then who also described seeing cloned or other bodies inside a tubetechnology that haunted them. [ See Linda Porter and Wanna Lawson in my 2-volumebook, © 1998 Glimpses of Other Realities. ] But I had not talked about or published any ofthose experiences in public.I looked at my shoes. They had a silver-grey metallic sheen.\"What did you see me in?\" I asked, deciding not to disclose any other knowledge fromprevious interviews.Ken Rose began to talk very rapidly and the details were confusing. So, I asked him if hewould draw what he had seen. I handed him my notebook. At first, he protested that hecould not draw. I told him all that mattered was a clearer visual sketch of what he wastrying to say. He took my pen and as he tried to draw, he spoke about his troublingmemory.First sketch by Kenneth Rose on February 2, 1992, in Lansing, Michigan, for Howe.Rose said the incomplete female bodies with eyes shut were coated with metallic gold dustlike the woman in the Hollywood film, Goldfinger. Drawing © 1998 byLi nda Moul ton How e, Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness.\"I don't know how I got there, but these little grey things ('They are not nice') took mewhere there were three ladies inside tubes. It was a little, round room that was all darkexcept around the tubes where it was lighted. There was some kind of dim light inside thetubes. It was an eggshell white light, so beautiful, but it smelled like acid-sweet, purevanilla and made me nauseous. On the far right was a woman who looked like you. In themiddle was another one that looked like the singer Kate Bush from the 1970s."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"\"And on the left was a Mexican-Indian, or maybe more Mayan-looking, woman. The threewere all covered in metallic dust just like your shoes. Seeing you here today wearing thoseshoes made me remember. I couldn't believe it! I still can't believe it! The women in thetubes looked like the woman in the spy movie, Goldfinger, when she was painted gold.\"Second drawing of three women in lighted tubes sent to Howe by Ken Rose in March 1992.Far left tube: \"Mayan Indian\"; far right tube: Linda; middle tube Kate Bush, 1970s singer(Hounds of Love). Drawing © 1998 by Linda Moulton Howe,Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness.\"What do you think the gold dust on the bodies was for?\" I asked.\"They (aliens) said the gold dust was anti-bacteria, or to preserve the bodies.\"\"The one on the right looked like me?\"\"That's why I'm so scared! Watching you this morning, the memory came flooding back.And you and the other two were missing body parts. There were no breasts, no public hair,and there were holes in the stomach. I could look up into the open body cavities and one ofthe grey things said, 'They're under construction.' They were alive, but not awake, and thelook on their faces was so tormented. It made me hurt all over, especially the one on theleft end, the Mayan-looking one. Her head was tilted back with a painful look on her face.Everyone's eyes were closed and the hands were forward with the palms out.\"Jeanne Rose suggested that maybe Ken could do more and better drawings when he wasrelaxed in his home and he agreed. So, I gave them my address in Philadelphia at the timeand hoped he would continue to try to recall more details and send me whatever drawingshe could."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"A few weeks later, a large package came postmarked March 23, 1992. Ken Rose had madeanother attempt to depict the three women in tubs which bothered him so much. He alsosent drawings from other experiences he recalled with his comments, including anencounter with what he called the \"Overseer\" and the \"Controller,\" the same word used byabductee Wanna Lawson who had also seen human and non-human bodies preserved inlighted tubes. The hairless \"Overseer\" described and drawn by Ken Rose based on his abduction experiencesin central Michigan since the 1960s. Drawing by Ken Rose for Howe in February 1992, and© 1998 by Linda Moulton Howe in Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness.Ken Rose: \"The Overseer - controls - oversees - the power of life and death -God. He who watches - makes the Final Judgment - the decisions. He whofeels = he who hates - love - I feel no sympathy, only sorrow, for me. This wasa side glance, no direct look. No hair on his head, (but) looks human. Blackleather clothes. 6 feet - milk white skin - could not see color of eyes. (Looked)like Yul Brynner (bald actor).\" The small Greys would not look at him. Scared of him and his power overlife and death. The next time I looked at the Overseer, he crossed his arms realclose and I could feel his stare right through me. I was going to live or die atthat moment. He had the power over everything - kind and loving, but couldkill you without a moment's hesitation.\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The praying mantis-Controller \"studies everything - looking for something?\"Drawing by Ken Rose for Howe in February 1992, and © 1998 by Linda Moulton Howein Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness.Ken Rose: \"In the same room, the Controller was busy at controls where I sawhim wearing a pearl or grey-colored helmet that looked like it had horns.Understood that with a flick of a switch, the Controller could provoke anyoneanywhere in the world, manipulated people into actions and studied reactionsof other people at large. Studying all behavior. Nothing goes unnoticed. In mydrawing, I wrote, 'The Controller - makes things happen - study the reaction -controls everything - studies everything - makes everything happen, all thathappens - He makes happen - studies patterns of behavior. Looking forsomething? Can't get too close - the Overseer is watching.'\"Linda, what does it mean? Are we a former colony that our owners lost allrights to and are trying to make a case against us to prove to a council or worldrepresentatives that we as a human race are not fit to govern ourselves?\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Ken Rose wrote on his 1992 drawing: \"Overseer at some kind of control. I didn't talk - or look- stare at the Overseer. I saw at a glance - a quick look. I looked at the Controller. I didn't talk -no sound - I could hear - in my head - no sound except I did hear a hum from the ship. I feltwarm all over from the hum. The next time I looked at the Overseer, he crossed his arms, realclose and looked. I could feel his stare right through me - I was going to live or die at thatmoment - he had the pow er over everythi ng. Ki nd and l ovi ng - and ki l l you w i thout a moment'sloss. The Controller was taking measurements, recording. If I made no eye contact - I would bespared!\"Ken Rose remembered telepathic thoughts from the Overseer and sent the following textwith his drawings:Ken Rose: \"The purpose of mankind is to help raise the conscious state inlesser animal forms, like it was done for us by genetically altering to a higherstate of consciousness. We are to colonize the planets in our solar system afterbringing them to a more habitable state, which we can do with chemicalalteration. By providing more habitat for more species, we are fulfilling therole in which God intended us to have as caretakers. We were (to be) thecaretakers, not the destroyers. We were designed to be the workers in thegrand scheme. Man is a product of a genetic manipulation. Somethinghappened in man's history whereby he was abandoned by his maker becausethe Council told them (genetic manipulators) - No More Interference. [Editor's Note: Ken Rose and I discussed the contradiction between humanassignment to colonize planets versus a Council block to prevent the\"defective\" human race from traveling into space.]\"Our makers were robbing the planet of all its wealth, for whatever reasons,and they were treating human life inhumanely. Their reckless disregard forhuman life (they destroyed Neanderthal man and introduced Cro-Magnon)resulted in the Council stopping their use of slavery of mankind. There's aconfederation of ETs that are studying mankind, but they are undercommission by the Council not to interfere with human affairs.\"\"This information isn't much, but it's what I've tried to remember. I asked thepeople on the craft - why were the people of this Earth like the way we are? Ifound humans cold-feeling, killers. Life anywhere in the universe is a struggle,but life in its varied forms is quite beautiful. On this Earth, people look past themulti-forms and kill them. Instead of working with this planet, they workagainst it. So, I also asked them (non-humans): why were we in Vietnam killing"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"people?\"They answered, 'Your words do not represent your feelings, your emotions.Your actions do not represent what you believe to be truth about your ownself. Your words do not fit your actions. You have many levels of justifications,but few, if any, represent the truth. Truth is centered around you - is like acircle, is closed. Truth can be only a straight line - cannot be a circle. Truthcannot be accepted. It injures the ego, the self. To accept life means to acceptall life. You are not ready, nor will you be ready, to accept all life. This(human) race is defective. We cannot give this race the opportunity to flee thisplanet (Earth) with the knowledge of the stars. It would be too dangerous forthe rest.'\"Ken Rose said that he asked who the \"rest\" were, but there was \"no reply. End ofconversation.\" Along with his drawings, Rose also sent a separate letter on notebook paperabout his understanding of what the Overseer and Controller might be doing.Ken Rose: \"The plan is simple - create a state of mental confusion among thepopulous. This will convince a consortium of represented groups in theCouncil - (that) only intervention will rectify an ever-growing state of massconfusion.\"Breakdown - social break down - an ever-growing mentally ill society - ahyperactive state - an addictive society to anything - a state of collection -obsessive-compulsive state - ownership and the need to get stuff. (Need for)security was built into the human psyche.\"Reason for this is the outcry and eventual expulsion of the early colonistswhen, after creating Neanderthal man, they found that creation would notwork for them. They destroyed the Neanderthal and replaced them withCro-Magnon man. That with the extermination of the dinosaurs earlier - yes. Iknow what you are thinking, but I'm not crazy.\" Left: Homo neanderthalensis (La Ferrassie) or Neandertal, was a species of the Homo genusthat inhabited Europe and parts of western Asia. By 130,000 years ago, full blown Neanderthal characteristicshad appeared. Right: Modern Homo sapiens sapiens emerged about 35,000 years ago and Neanderthalsbecame extinct in Europe approximately 24,000 years ago. Source: Wikipedia.[ Editor's Note: The Mesozoic is divided into three time periods:the Triassic (245 - 208 million years ago); the Jurassic (208 - 146million years ago); and the Cretaceous (146 - 65 million yearsago). Large reptiles dominated land animals on Earth during mostof the Mesozoic Era. Then dinosaurs disappeared with the adventof a large asteroid impact near the Yucatan peninsula in the Gulfof Mexico about 65 million years ago. One abductee hypothesis isthat non-humans removed species of dinosaurs to another planet"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"for preservation prior to the global asteroid catastrophe thatmarked the end of the Mesozoic Era.]Ken Rose and his wife separated in 1992.
