I was working with her fora missing time experience and somethinginteresting came up during her hypnosissession.What she recounted was an abduction whereshe was not the subject of anyexperimentation, but she was, for whatever"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"reason, allowed to witness an alien soul orconsciousness transference into the body ofan transient human male. She describedUSAF uniforms of the officers that werepresent during the procedure. She said itapparently was being done in what mighthave been a large building like an aircrafthanger. After the procedure was done shewas released unharmed.This would have occurred in the early1990s. Terri was basically a housewifeand I was never able to learn from her whyshe was allowed to see the procedure beingdone. Her husband was not in the military,although she did live in close proximity towhat used to be Carswell AFB in Fort Worth,Texas, now Naval Air Station Fort Worth.”December 27, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Chapter 8, Meat Market.*****Chapter 8Meat Market“What was horrifying, though, was the sensation ofthe other body sucking him into it. If it were not forthe fact that Bill was under some kind of Aliensedative, his mind would not have been strongenough to survive that transformation.”The committee added five living human bodies to its inventory. The scientistsprocured the five mortally injured men from across the country. Details aboutwhere they were taken from or why the men were dying was not madeknown. The committee kept the living bodies stored in the incubator roomuntil a decision was made about what to do with them. The military requestedthat four bodies be released to them. Most on the committee were in favor ofgiving the military what they asked for. It was enough that the scientists hadto keep one Frankenstein in their midst, but having six of them made everyonewho had to work around the living bodies extremely uncomfortable. Thecommittee had converted the other five bodies because presumably thePentagon had ordered the conversion.The decision to give up the bodies was made while Bill Smith was absent. Assoon as he discovered what was about to take place, Bill intervened. He wasagainst giving the military possession of the bodies, but he gave no reason forhis resistance. Bill was the only one on the committee who was able to stopthe bodies from being taken by the military, even though the military hadalready made plans to receive the bodies and had no intention of delaying thattransactin.Apparently Bill Smith had influenced the high command in other than earthlyways. Bill never made it a part of the record, but he told one of his trustedfriends that he was with the Aliens when they dropped in on a certain Generaland abducted him.During the abduction, Bill Smith was not privy to all that was \"suggested\" tothe General by the Aliens, but the General was made aware that he would puton hold his military request for the living male bodies. There was nothing elsedone to the General at that time and the whole episode took less than tenminutes, including the time it took to return the General to his bedroom.That same week, while on board the Alien craft, Bill found himself in thesame room with one of the bodies that the committee had recently converted.Bill Smith was told that the Aliens were going to let him leave his human bodyand enter into one of the other male bodies. [ Editor's Note: Please seeEarthfiles 03/31/2007 and Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: HighStrangeness in Earthfiles Shop.]At first, the whole idea terrified him. The Aliens assured Bill that it was"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"strictly his choice. If Bill was not ready for that kind of experience, it was finewith the Aliens and they would put it off for another time. Bill decided to doit. The Aliens instructed Bill to enter into an adjacent room. The room glowedwith the same color of yellow as did the room he and the committee called theincubator room. The Aliens wasted no time and quickly placed him under atrance. After a few seconds, Bill Smith felt himself become detached from hisbody. Then it was as if someone lifted him out through the top of his head.It all happened exactly like what Bill had read about in books describingout-of-body experiences. These people claimed to have had what was called a“near death experience.” There are documented cases detailing events abouthow people die from some accident or illness and then are resuscitated backto life - or are sent back by an omnipotent being because of some unfinishedbusiness the person still has on Earth. There were hundreds of these reports inthe 1970s and 1980s.As with any phenomena, there are plenty of skeptics. Bill was one of thebiggest doubters. Like many, Bill thought it was pure nonsense, “ and that thewhole thing could be explained by the chemicals that are released naturally bya dying body.” One of Bill's favorite stories from the 1980s was that when thebody was going through the trauma called “death,” the person dying wasremembering when he originally came into this world through the mother'sbirth canal. According to the skeptics, the bright light of the delivery room iswhat the dying person sees as he desperately tries to keep from sliding into theabyss of death.The stories described how the person who died found himself floating to thetop of the room and looking down at his body. Sometimes, the near-death-experiencer (NDE) described seeing doctors and nurses working franticallytrying to revive the body. Some of the NDE people stayed on this plane ofexistence for a period of time and then got sucked back into their bodies whenthe doctors succeeded in reviving them. Others reported that in the moment ofdeath, they were sucked through what looked like a tunnel at a high rate ofspeed. At the end of that tunnel, the NDE person is greeted by loved ones,aunts, grandparents or friends who had passed away earlier. Then the NDEperson visits with a Being that radiated warm light. The Being was full of loveand compassion for the person. The Being showed the NDE experiencer hisentire life, but did not judge them.Bill Smith did not die and get whisked away, but he did experience the samecuriosity of his own body as he hovered over it. He knew it was his body, butseeing himself from a new perspective was shocking. He looked different fromwhat he had expected. What was horrifying, though, was the sensation of theother body sucking him into it. If it were not for the fact that Bill was undersome kind of Alien sedative, his mind would not have been strong enough tosurvive that transformation.Once he was in the other body, it felt natural to him. Bill was aware that thisother body did not need to eat or drink and that the Alien contraption insidewas what sustained it. Bill could not feel the object that was inside the bodyand was only aware of it because he knew it was there from the X-ray thecommittee had taken of it back in the lab. The body radiated vitality. Bill Wasnot sure if it was because the body was that of a younger man? Or because itwas energized by the Alien battery-pack?The body was fully clothed, so Bill did not need to get dressed. Bill took hispersonal belongings, wallet and keys out of the pants of his dormant body andwas ready to go. Before he could ask the Aliens about the picture on hisdriver's license, the Aliens told him to look in his wallet. Bill's license waschanged and his I. D. fit the image of the new body.The Aliens told Bill to have fun with his new self and to take a week toexplore how it felt. Bill decided that in order to become comfortable in thenew body, he would first mingle with people who were strangers to him. Billthen went out to some of the favorite hangouts where his friends andcolleagues might be. When Bill encountered someone he knew, he struck up aconversation. Bill was surprised that his colleagues from the committee, whowere familiar with the body Bill was inhabiting, had no clue that they weretalking to Bill, or that the body the committee had worked around for monthswas now having a drink and a conversation with them.Bill Smith tried to give himself away by using some of his old mannerisms.When that failed, Bill tried talking about some of the same likes and dislikes"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"that their common friend, Bill Smith, had. Nothing worked. His colleaguesnever suspected who Bill was. The scientists merely assumed that it wasfriendship with a stranger.Bill's wife and family did not miss him during that week. It was not uncommonfor Bill to be away from home for days and weeks at a time. Bill wanted badlyto disclose to some of his friends who he was, just to see the expressions ontheir faces. But after thinking about it, Bill realized that his friends would onlythink him insane. If his friends believed him, they would probably have aheart attack. As he walked around the city in the new body, he wondered howmany other humans were counterfeits, like himself?There was no human way of knowing that answer. The Aliens never gave Billa clue about that question, but the Aliens did say Bill would know sometime inthe future. Bill thought that if anyone could detect a spark of who he reallywas, it would be his family. So Bill posed as an insurance salesman and wentto his own house. His wife refused his solicitations and did not let him insidethe home. Bill was glad she refused him entry. It was a “stupid idea,” hereminded himself. If anyone made the connection, it could only prove harmfulto them.That was the lesson the Aliens wanted Bill to learn. Bill was sent down tomingle with people, knowing that he would want to share his secrets with hisfellow man - secrets that Bill thought were too fantastic to keep locked upinside of himself. At times, Bill thought he would go mad! He felt a strongneed to tell someone what he was capable of doing.After the week had passed, Bill returned to the spot where he was scheduledto meet the Aliens. The encounter took place at a house that had a “For Sale”sign on it and was vacant. He met with two Aliens who were disguised as realestate agents. In the house, Bill found his real body waiting for him. It hadbeen kept alive with an external apparatus that covered his body's mouth andnose. Bill was still not comfortable seeing his body that way and it scared him.The Aliens gave him a sedative and quickly returned him to his own body.The Aliens performed a different procedure than they had done in the craftbefore. As Bill stood next to his body, the Aliens simply fitted a device on hishead and siphoned him out of the temporary body and deposited him backinto his old self. It was a totally different sensation from the last time. It wasquicker and Bill hardly knew what happened.Bill went back to the office and convened a meeting with the committee. Hetold them what he had done and what the implications of that new informationmeant to the scientists. For those who did not believe Bill, he described thedetails of his encounter for them.Still skeptical, his colleagues replied that Bill could have gotten thatinformation from the individual that he claimed to be. Bill then told thecommittee exactly what they were each thinking at the time Bill met withthem in the body of the other man. Finally, Bill told them that he wouldduplicate with the scientists what had been done to him by using another bodythat was in storage. Bill asked for volunteers.During the time Bill occupied the other body, he was clairvoyant. He knewthe thoughts of people simply by visualizing their faces or looking at them. Hehad a feeling that the phenomena was part of being detached from one's ownbody and not necessarily because he was in a mutated human body. But Billwas not sure if that were true.Four scientists from the committee volunteered to go through the procedure.That surprised Bill. He did not expect any one of them to try it. Bill had neverdone the procedure, but he assumed the know-how would come to him as heneeded it - at least he hoped it would. Bill explained to the volunteers that theresults of what each was going to do were not absolute. After that revelation,three volunteers withdrew.Tim, the one who did not pull back, was eager to proceed. Bill took nochances and decided to perform the transfer in the incubator room rather thanuse the portable system that seemed less complicated than the one on thecraft. Bill felt more assured of himself doing complicated procedures while inthe craft. There was a sense that he was never alone when he was in the ship.The Aliens had left the portable system with him and disposed of the bodythat he had used. They gave him no explanation about why they left theportable unit or why the Aliens disposed of the body rather than return it to"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the incubator room.The Aliens implanted complicated information and procedures directly intoBill's subconscious mind (a lot like pre-loaded software that comes with somecomputers.) The Aliens did this because the amount and type of informationBill needed to know could never be learned by the human mind on its own.Nor could just any human be trusted with what the Aliens downloaded intoBill's mind.All the equipment that the Aliens used on Bill was also available in the craftthat the committee possessed. Bill was able to identify the equipment neededfor the transfer-to-another-body procedure, even though he only saw it usedby the Aliens once.Continued in Part 12 - Dark CornersMore Information:For further reports about extraterrestrial biological entities and technologies, please seemy books, An Alien Harvest and the 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities in theEarthfiles Shop.
