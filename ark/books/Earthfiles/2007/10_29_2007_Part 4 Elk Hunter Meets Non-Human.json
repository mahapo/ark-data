And the fact that Carl had an oblong, purple spot on his hand thatchiropractor Lasco, who examined Carl after the abduction event, said might be a brokenblood vessel. Leo Sprinkle, Ph.D., asked Carl if he remembered anything about whathappened. He didn't remember specifically what caused the purple oval on his skin. But hedid recall details about the odd mechanical apparatus at the end of the non-human Ausso'sright arm.Illustration of odd, android-like entity encountered on October 25, 1974,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"by Carl Higdon for Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) investigator Rick Kenyon.LS: You don't remember anything about that?CH: All except the helmet. I don't even think I said anything about the helmet- when they put the helmet on me. These guys, they didn't - in other words,they didn't walk over and pick up somethin' and bring it to you. They justpoint this deal that come out of the end of their hand, like this (demonstrates)and whatever it was, it would just ...RK: Move (things) over, huh?CH: It's just like, what do you call it? Levitation?Son: Gravitation?CH: Gravitational force, or somethin'. They'd just point at it like this and itwould just move! The same way when we took off, I could remember him -the reason I said their hands were free was 'cause this guy stuck his hand outlike this and this deal come out. It's like a cut-off sleeve, like his coat was toobig. And this deal would come out and he'd do like this (demonstrates). Andthis lever on this control board would just move down. You could feel themovement, but really not much. It wasn't like that Evel Knievel (motorcycledaredevil in late 1960s) a while back, 5000 Gs or somethin'? It didn't feel thatway. It just felt like it was ...LS: Just a gradual?CH: Gradual shifting. And then maybe the reason I can't remember nothin'else on that flight, maybe it was that fast. Then maybe again, it was just all theseein' this big ball down there that I just didn't pay no attention to nothin' else.LS: Now, you don't remember coming back and seeing that same ball comingback again?CH: No, the last thing I can remember is the lights were too bright and hesays, \"Well, we'll take you home.\" And the next thing I can remember iswalking down this road and runnin' into the pickup. Well, I didn't really runinto it. I seen the pickup and I walked by it. Then whenever I came back to itand got ahold of the office (Sheriff). I can't remember the trip back. I can'tremember how I got that far down from where I was. And I don't rememberhow I got my rifle back. But I do remember my hands being like this in theseat, where I couldn't have had a rifle in either hand. So I don't know wherethe rifle went, other than they (Ausso) took it from me and then give it backwhen we landed. I don't know.Son: They (non-human entity/ies) could have put that fingerprint (on gunscope lens), too.LS: Yeah, when it was handed back.MH: Then when they found him, he was just in a state of shock. He wasn'treally scared. He was just in a state of shock. As soon as the Sheriff opened upthe door, Carl looked at him and he says, \"Why aren't you dressed like the restof 'em?\" (laughter)Rel: Well, did those spacemen, or whatever you want to call 'em, how didthey ever get back into the cubicle?CH: Now, that I can't tell. I don't remember.LS: Did you see the cubicle when you were looking at the elk? Or did youjust see the inside?CH: No, I didn't see the cubicle. He just (Ausso), when I turned around, thisguy said, \"You want to go with me?\" Then I looked up on the hill and all I canremember seein' is just a thin outline like this (demonstrates) of thistransparent cubicle. I call it a \"cubicle.\" I don't know what else to call it. Itwas just illuminated. But this was all you could see. You could't see nothin'else visible other than just this outline. And then when you get inside, theyhad three levers. Now what these other two levers were, I don't know. Butthey only used one that I seen and it went down when we were in orbit, orwhatever you want to call it. I don't really know. These are the things I don'trally know. These are the things that maybe eventually I might, and again, Imight not. I might just forget all of it. I don't know. I haven't forgot the things"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"that did happen. I haven't forgot them yet. So, maybe in time, I'll get the restof the picture. I don't know. Leo Sprinkle's note: There is a question about the \"163,000\" which Carlrecalls as a number of \"miles\" or the number of \"light miles\" (?) which thecubicle traveled. Carl restated his belief that he was told \"163,000 light miles.\"Rick Kenyon described his conversation with a science teacher about thepossibility that there could be some large object within 163,000 miles ofEarth. RK: I was just discussing this with a science teacher. She said the only thingthat was out there were some possible asteroids at that particular distance andthose would be very insignificant radioactive (?) asteroids.MH: Wouldn't it be possible that would be how far it as to their bigger spaceships, since this was just a little one? Then could this be the light that we saw?LS: What did the light look like to you? Was it high? Or on the horizon?MH: It was - if I could take you out there, I could show you how high it wasbecause it was right to the tip of this one tree, down at the edge of the roadwhere the road bended. I didn't notice it at first. Marilyn James did. With elkhuntin' and everything, I got so that whenever you go along, you're watchingthe tree line. You watch for something to come out. At first, we thought it wasa helicopter because we had requested aerial to help search. Marilyn said,\"Well, look!\" And we looked out there and we thought at first it was ahelicopter. But it was too high to be a helicopter for searching. Then we got tolooking at it and it would be too low for an airplane. It wasn't moving fastenough for an airplane. When we first saw it, it was right up in back of thetree branches. I started watching the side of the road again and Don started togo to sleep. All of a sudden, Marilyn said, \"What in the world?!\" I said,\"What's the matter?\" She said, \"That thing's doing the loops!\"Don looked and he says, \"Ah, go back to sleep!\" She says, \"No, it's moving,it's doing the loops!\" About that time, I looked out there and I noticed thatwhen we first saw it - we'll say here's the tree (demonstrates) - and when Ilooked again, it was about over to here. But we also noticed that when I waslooking out the window on this side of us, the moon was behind the tree. Themoon had also changed this much, too, and we were only there for 20 minutesin this particular area. Now, the universe doesn't move that fast, does it?CH: I think you got a little hypnotized!MH: And then about this time, we saw the bright lights coming out of the treeline more like down at the bottom, like cars coming out. We said, \"Well, herethey come with Carl.\" And so Don got on the radio and asked them aboutthem (light/s) that we saw. And they said, \"Hah! We've just now spotted himand we haven't even got to him yet!\" And they aid that they would be comin'out a different road and weren't even going to try to attempt to come back onthe road that they had went in on.So, they told us to meet 'em farther down, so that's when we took off fromthere and went on farther down. And then when they did bring Carl out, it waslike the sun was rising. This was about right around between 1 AM and ... wegot back to the hospital, what was it? 2:30 AM, I would imagine.RK: It was an extremely bright night - even in Rawlins. It was too damn lightto be night. It was a strange night.MH: But when we got back to town, the sun wasn't rising over here. I mean,that's what it looked like over there, like the sun comin' up, you know? Buthere in town, when Roy brought me home, it was still totally dark out there,except for the airport lights, just the regular lights. And I didn't even think toomuch of that light until after I got here and looked out and it was still dark andout there it was like the sun comin' up.CH: I know a few of the guys that was out there huntin' that night and saidthat they could have dropped a needle on the ground and reached down andpicked it up. That's how light it was outside. This was only a three-quartermoon. It wasn't a full moon."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"MH: I wanted to get out and walk and the roadway was completelyilluminated.RK: I just thought of a question. You remember when you were taking thepills out of the cell phone, Carl? Took them and put them in your mouth?What did you do with the cell phone? Do you have any idea at all?CH: No, I don't. It seemed to me like these pills come in a package of four. Itore this one open and took the pill, but I slipped the package in my shirtpocket. But then I told them, too, at the hospital, I guess to get the pills. Youknow, they were in my shirt pocket and they looked all through my clothesand they (hospital) couldn't find them.MH: OK, a question: How did you swallow a pill without anything to drink?You cannot take a pill without liquid.CH: Don't ask me!Son: You can, too, Mom!MH: I can. Your Daddy can't.CH: I don't even take an aspirin unless I got that much water to go with it.MH: And then you gotta browbeat him to even take it!CH: I don't know. Maybe I figured it was candy. I can eat a lot of candy.Son: Did you chew it up? Or did you just swallow it?CH: Now, there's a question I hadn't even thought of, Son. I really can't saywhether I swallowed it or whether I chewed it up. But I do know if what Isaid, those were good for four days - their days are only 10-hour days,compared to ours. Because about 40 hours later, boy, I was starved enough Icould have eaten a horse. But until then, I wasn't even hungry.MH: Up at the hospital, he was like a whipped puppy. He'd look at you like,\"I ain't goin' to, but OK.\" You know, \"I'll do it if you don't whip me, but I don'twant to do it.\"CH: I really wasn't hungry all day Saturday until about 8 AM Sundaymorning. Well, I woke up a little before *AM and about then I was hungryenough I could eat two horses if they'd been there. Then they give me that oldpaltry breakfast, you know?MH: I made him eat Saturday.RK: What did he say that he doesn't remember? You mentioned the thingabout the levitation, or the dematerialization, of the pickup. Did he sayanything else - irrationally or rationally - when you got there?MH: You mean at the hospital? Or when we first saw...?RK: When you first saw him?MH: When I first got to him, I opened the pickup door and he just looked atme like you were just looking right straight through him. And the first thing Icould think of to say to him that would maybe make him think or anything, Isaid, \"Oh, honey, did you get any elk?\"And the minute I said \"elk,\" he started looking out the windshield like this! Ijust figured he was looking into the tree line. And the look he had on his facescared me, though. Don was on the other side of the pickup. The other guys -the pickup was just about out of gas and we had got plenty of gas with us. So,they were out filling the tank. I told Don, \"Get that gun out of the rack\"because I didn't know what \"buck fever\" is, but this is the only thing I couldimagine he had, you know? So I told him to get the gun out of there and Carlwas shaking. So, I took my coat off and tried to put it around him. Carl said,\"Don't you dare touch me! Don't you DARE touch me!\" That's all he wouldsay. And I just kept telling him, \"It's all right, it's all right.\"I went ahead and put the coat around him and he went ahead and let me put itaround him. But I was NOT to touch him. And after that, with having thedoors open and shaking like that and being in shock, we figured maybe itwould be better if maybe he just stayed warm. So, we just shut the doors."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Then I just stood there by the pickup until after they got it gassed up and gotgoin' on farther in.Well, Roy got to feeling so sorry for him settin' there in the pickup with hishead down on the dash, so he stopped the Sheriff that was driving and theyopened the door up to ask Carl if he wanted to ride in the car. And then allhell broke loose.We were riding three pickups behind so that all happened, I don't know. All Ido know is when I got to there, Carl was in - here's the road. Here's yourditch, bar ditch. And the fence over here. Carl was standing out close to thefence and he was crying and he was holding his hands over his eyes. He says,\"Those lights, those lights, get those lights out. Help me, God, help me! Getthose lights out!And Bud and I both walked up to him and he yells, \"Get outta the way, getoutta my path!\" Then as soon as - there was seven vehicles - now when youlooked around, there was an awful lot of lights there and so we told everybodyto get back in their pickups and get those lights doused. As soon as we got thelights doused, and we got out of his way, he started to head towards the backdoor of the car where Roy had it opened. He walked right up to the back door.It was open, but he opened it a little bit father and then he just SLAMMED it!He got in the front seat, closed the door, and we went on to town.Then when we got to the hospital, he kept hollerin' about his pills, his pills. Hedon't take pills! We dept asking him, \"What pills?\" \"Four-day pills, four-daypills!\" And the \"men in the black suits,\" the \"men in the black suits,\" the\"four-day pills,\" and the \"pickup.\" He said, \"I don't know where the pickup is.How did it get where?\" He said, \"Those men and a gun.\" She said, \"What?\"He said, \"They just pointed and it (pickup) disappeared.\"RK: That might explain how he got in the Craft.MH: He kept complaining he had to have those pills. He had to have thosefour-day pills and that was all the sense we could make out. Then the doctorcame and the doctor said, \"Well, this sounds like a science fiction movie.\"And the nurse that was on duty up there, either her father owns this land, orher husband does. One or the other. She said, \"No, knowing the area where hecame in from, I'm not one bit surprised he's in the shape he is.\"And he kept complaining of the light. We had a washrag all doubled up aboutfour times over his eyes. They finally even turned the lights out. His eyes werejust like - well, it as like he had a little tiny sprinkler back here running them. Imean, it just kept running continually. And then the nurse, she asked to see hiseyes and Carl says, \"I ain't on dope! I ain't on dope!\" She says, \"I know it, butwe gotta look at your eyes.\" But, \"I ain't on dope!\" And then the funny partof it was, his head hurt. She'd reach up and touch and say, \"Where does ithurt? Here?\" \"Yes, Ow! Oh, Oh! It feels fine now.\"Then the nurse would ask him, \"Does it hurt on the bottom part here?\" AndCarl would say, \"Well, I hurt here.\" He didn't point at anything. He just said ithurts. She was rubbing her hands and he said, \"Yeah, there. Oh, oh, it hurt, oh,oh!\" And as soon as she would touch it, \"It feels fine now!\" (laughter)He was telling her where it hurt bad and as soon as she'd touch it, it wouldhurt real bad and then, just like that, it don't hurt no more! Then she'd go backover those spots (head) and say, \"Do you hurt here? Do you hurt there?\" Andhe said, \"No, no!\"CH: Well, I went over to (chiropractor) Lasco on Thursday. He's achiropractor here in town. I been to him several times. He asked me if whenhe started to beat on my back, \"What did somebody do? Hit you over thehead with a tree?\" And I said, \"Naw, I just feel like I been pushed togetherlike this and then pulled strong apart.\" That's just the way I feel. I still, in myneck, right through here, I get a hard spot in there once in a while. I'll go backover there and see him again, I guess. But that's just the way my muscles felt -felt like they were compressed and then just yanked apart. I do know that inorder for, rationally, three men, my size, and five elk to be in a five by sevenfoot cubicle - you would have to be shrunk. There's no other way that you canget that many people in and five elk, inside a five by seven cubicle. You'dhave to be shrunk - there's just no other way. I mean, that's just the way mywhole body felt - like I'd just been (shrunk) and then pulled apart.BN: As you recollect, they were all standing up?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"CH: Yeah, they were all standing. Well, these two guys - I never did see themstanding up inside. They were seated in - the seat right next to me was empty.Then the next two seats farther over (the two men were in). They seemed likethey kept their distance. They wouldn't get close. They would just stay fartheraway from you.LS: OK, now, if you want to have some more coffee. Then why don't wepractice some relaxation techniques and then see if we can get not only moreof the memory, but whatever the \"feel\" was of those things that happened,OK?(Question about the star on Ausso's belt buckle)CH: Right there on the belt buckle (Ausso's) of being a gold, kind of ayellow-gold star. But this part down here is like a cloud. It was like I drew ithere. I mean it's kinda jagged affair. But it wasn't really like lightening.LS: Can you draw one right there?CH: I would say more like it kind had an oval shape in the middle. It wasn'tstraight across at the top.RK: It dipped a little bit?CH: Yeah, it was something like this. But really, the thing that got me was thestar above it in the belt. This lapel-like deal that come down - it was black,too, and the only thing that set it off was it was kind of set out from the rest.RK: What color was the bands across?CH: THEY WERE BLACK.RK: AND THE SUIT WAS BLACK, TOO?CH: The only thing that set them off as that they was set out, you know?Close enough to where you could see that they were set out away from therest of the material. You've seen these school guards with these deals across...LS: Kind of a uniform?RK: Did they go clear over the shoulder?CH: That I couldn't tell 'cause I never did see the back of 'em. It looked likethey would go up to the shoulder. You couldn't see no farther. This one guy inparticular (Ausso) is the only one that I really seen. I was aware of anotherperson, or \"being\" there, but I really don't remember seeing him as much as Idid this one (Ausso). Course this is the first one I encountered (Ausso).LS: Did that look like a 6-pointed star? And did it have something in themiddle there?CH: No. It was just a 6-pointed star.LS: Then a kind of apron or little lap covering?CH: Like a lapel, or whenever they set down, it looked to me like it would besettin' in their lap. That they could look straight down at. The design in this iskind of fuzzy. I don't remember it being either straight on the bottom orstraight on the top. The end was kind of curly.Return to Part 1To be continued in final Part 5 - More details from Carl Higdon under deep relaxation.More Information:For further reports about the human abduction syndrome, please see my books anddocumentaries in the Earthfiles Shop and other reports below in the Earthfiles Archive:• 09/16/2007 — Part 5: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 09/11/2007 — Part 4: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 09/07/2007 — Part 3: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 09/05/2007 — Part 2: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 08/31/2007 — Part 1: Betty and Barney Hill: Captured!"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"• 08/31/2007 — Part 2: Betty and Barney Hill: Captured!• 08/30/2007 — Part 1: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 08/24/2007 — Orange-Red \"Fiery\" Aerial Spheres• 08/01/2007 — Part 3, Non-Human Blonds, Greys and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Lizards• 07/31/2007 — Part 2, Non-Human Blonds, Greys and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Lizards• 07/26/2007 — Part 1, Non-Human Blonds, Lizards and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Greys• 07/14/2007 — Schofield Barracks, Oahu, Hawaii - Huge, Lime Green UFO Over Battalion Headquarters• 05/29/2007 — Final Part 7: Eyewitness Links Animal Mutilations to Non-Humans• 05/13/2007 — Part 6: Eyewitness Links Animal Mutilations to Non-Humans• 05/11/2007 — CIA Origin of National Enquirer?• 05/06/2007 — Part 5: Eyewitness Links Animal Mutilations to Non-Humans• 05/05/2007 — Part 4: Eyewitness Links Animal Mutilations to Non-Humans• 04/28/2007 — April 24, 2007 - Part 3: Eyewitness Links Animal Mutilations to Non-Humans.• 04/19/2007 — Part 2: Eyewitness Links Animal Mutilations to Non-Humans• 04/18/2007 — Part 1: Eyewitness Links Animal Mutilations to Non-Humans• 04/20/2007 — 2006 Human Encounter with Translucent Entity• 12/14/2006 — Abductee Jim Sparks's Encounter with Reptillian Beings: Their Warning and Agenda• 10/28/2006 — Close UFO Encounter by USAF Eyewitnesses• 10/11/2006 — Part 2: Time Travel, Insights from USAF Sergeant and UFO Abductee• 10/08/2006 — Part 1: Time Travel, Insights from USAF Sergeant and UFO Abductee• 09/29/2006 — Manipulation of Time and Matter by Non-Humans: The Experiences of Jim Sparks• 09/05/2006 — Part 2: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet?• 09/04/2006 — Part 1: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet?• 06/18/2006 — Viewer Letters About NASA Airbrushing Photos; EBENs and Reptilian Humanoids• 05/12/2006 — An Extraterrestrial School for Humans• 04/28/2006 — Modern Warfare Applied to Extra-Terrestrial Invasion• 04/03/2006 — Genetic Harvest in Cimarron, New Mexico?• 02/23/2006 — Huge Boomerang Craft and Blond Beings• 02/10/2006 — Crashed Disc Photos, \"Ebens,\" and Area 51 \"Anti-Gravity\"• 01/27/2006 — Part 2: Navy Physicist and USAF Geophysicist Discuss UFOs and ETs• 12/02/2005 — Abduction by Grey ETs in Huge, Black Triangle• 10/22/2005 — A Lifting Beam Technology in Colorado Human Abduction• 08/11/2005 — Part 4: Two Men See Cow Mutilated in Light Beam• 08/03/2005 — Part 3: Two Men See Cow Mutilated in Light Beam• 07/26/2005 — Part 2: Two Men See Cow Mutilated in Light Beam• 07/22/2005 — Part 1: Two Men See Cow Mutilated in Light Beam• 02/04/2005 — Part 2: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report V - Is The Cover-Up Lid Lifting?• 12/22/2004 — Part 2: \"Reasons Why U.S. Government CAN'T Release Truth About UFOs!\" with CanadianResearcher, Grant Cameron• 09/25/2004 — Part 6: \"Clearview\" Report on the Investigation of UFO Experiences on A Rocky MountainRanch• 09/23/2004 — Part 5: \"Clearview\" Report on the Investigation of UFO Experiences on A Rocky MountainRanch• 09/19/2004 — Part 4: \"Clearview\" Report on the Investigation of UFO Experiences on A Rocky MountainRanch• 09/18/2004 — Part 3: \"Clearview\" Report on the Investigation of UFO Experiences on A Rocky MountainRanch• 09/14/2004 — Part 2: \"Clearview\" Report on the Investigation of UFO Experiences on A Rocky MountainRanch• 09/13/2004 — Part 1: \"Clearview\" Report on the Investigation of UFO Experiences on A Rocky MountainRanch• 01/24/2004 — Oregon Man's Experiences with High Strangeness• 10/28/2003 — Part 2 - U.
