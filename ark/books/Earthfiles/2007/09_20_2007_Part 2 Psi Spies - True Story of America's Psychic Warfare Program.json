S. Army’s remote viewing Enigma Files:“Late in 1988, Mel Riley (remote viewer) was working on projects for the U.S. Army. He recalled that their superiors brought them a satellite photographto study. The satellite photograph showed simply a glowing object. But in MelRiley's remote viewing sessions, the craft had humanoid people in it and washovering above a nuclear storage facility. The remote viewer impression wasthat these ‘visitors’ were bean counting, taking an inventory of the number ofarmed warheads at the military depot.Mel Riley, Psi Spy, U. S. Army.“When the Psi Spies remote viewed and tracked these objects back to theirpoint of origin, the remote viewers found the objects came from sub-surfacelocations on our moon, and Mars, and that they would land in sub-surfacelocations on Earth.”"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I asked Jim to explain more details about what the remote viewers found about non-humanunderground bases on Earth.Interview Part 2: Jim Marrs.Jim Marrs, Investigative Journalist and Author, Crossfire © 1989; The Alien Agenda© 1997; Rule By Secrecy © 2000; The War On Freedom © 2003, retitled 9/11 InsideJob © 2004 and re-published as The Terror Conspiracy © 2006; and Psi Spies: TheTrue Story of America's Psychic Warfare Program © 2007, Wise Town, Texas: \"One ofthe best and earliest remote viewers was a former police detective named Pat Price. Justby happenstance, the authorities stumbled across and brought him into the testing that wasbeing done at SRI (Stanford University). Pat proved to be a tremendous remote viewer.Well, Pat Price would not only do what they asked him to do, but he would take it uponhimself to go look at things. One day, he showed up with a report he had written up aboutthe four alien bases that he had seen on the Earth.1) One is in the Pyrenees Mountains between France and Spain. As I recall, the one in thePyrenees is a transportation hub. That’s where they come and go off our planet.The Pyrenees are a range of mountains in southwestern Europe that form a natural borderbetween France and Spain.

Most of the remoteviewers talked about the small Greys. I think the lizards were also mentioned. In the fourbases, the transportation center in the Pyrenees seems to be primarily under the control ofthe little Greys. But the remote viewers see them working with other species at certainother bases. Remote Viewing Encounterwith Hooded Non-HumansYOU HAVE INTERVIEWED LYN BUCHANAN, DAVID MOREHOUSE, JIMMCMONEAGLE AND MEL RILEY, WHO HAVE ALL BEEN VERY GOOD ATREMOTE VIEWING DOWN TO VERY SPECIFIC DETAILS. HAVE ANY ONE OFTHOSE, OR OTHERS, TALKED TO YOU PRIVATELY ABOUT SEEING SPECIFICDETAILS OF NON-HUMANS?Oh, yes. In fact, at one point, when the remote viewers were discussing among themselvesthese occurrences of remote viewing UFOs and where they come from and what are theyall about – the very questions that we are always asking ourselves – they said, ‘Instead oftalking about these random sightings we are seeing, why don’t we track it right back to thesource and figure out what the control point is?’So, they tasked Mel Riley to go take a look at what they could only describe asIntergalactic Federation Headquarters. He ended up with a very bizarre experience. Heended up in a very mountainous area with a large plateau and a huge lake that he equatedas something similar to Lake Titicaca (Peru)."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Satellite image of Lake Titicaca, Peru, May 1985, courtesy NASA.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - Lake Titicaca is the highest commerciallynavigable lake in the world at 12,507 feet (3,812 meters) above sea level.Located in the Altiplano at a high altitude in the Andeson border of Peru andBolivia, at 16°S 69°W. Titicaca has an average depth of 107 meters and amaximum depth of 281 meters. The western part of the lake belongs to thePuno Region of Peru and the eastern side is located in the Bolivian La PazDepartment. More than 25 rivers empty into Lake Titicaca. The big lake has41 islands, some of which are densely populated. Lake Titicaca is fed byrainfall and meltwater from glaciers on the edge of the Altiplano. The lake isdrained by the Desaguadero River, which flows south through Bolivia to LakePoopo. However, this accounts for less than 5% of the lake's water loss. Therest is caused by evaporation as a result of the strong winds and sunlight at thehigh altitude.]There was a huge ziggurat there, or pyramid, with a sloping ramp, which Mel Rileyascended. Inside the pyramid was a huge room with a dais in the center of it and therewere hooded figures standing around there. The prominent emotion Mel felt was happinessand joy at almost a homecoming. It was like he had been there before. He went over andlay down on the dais while a beam of light came down and enshrouded him. Mel said hehad a complete feeling of well being and ‘being home’ to the point that he really did notwant to come back. But they ended the remote viewing session and he came back to hismaterial 3-dimensional existence.WHAT PHYSICAL FEATURES DID HE SEE IN THE HOODED ENTITIES?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"I don’t believe he ever got any clear picture of who these entities were. Keep in mind thatseveral remote viewers have told me that not only have they seen various extraterrestrials– you’ve got the Greys, you’ve got the Reptilians, you’ve got the tall blond ‘Nordics’ – butthey have also seen beings of energy and light, which the remote viewers called‘transcendentals.’ So, there is just a whole wide spectrum of life out there and some of it isnot even on the material plane of existence where we are.DID MEL RILEY COME AWAY WITH ANY SENSE OF THE AGENDA OF THEHOODED FIGURES SINCE THE WHOLE REASON FOR HIS REMOTE VIEWINGWAS TO GO BACK TO THE SOURCE CONTROLLING THE NON-HUMANINTERACTION WITH THE EARTH?Right, I think his experience showed us there are other planes of existence and gets intowhat I guess I could only call the spiritual and that we are all beings of energy and as such,we’re all connected and that when we come, or are relegated to this 3-D material plane ofexistence, we’re all here kind of like going to kindergarten. We’re here to learn somelessons to learn how to get along in the material world – perhaps just to experience thematerial world. And at some point, we will again graduate and we will again become partof the energy whole of the universe, which is omniscient and omnipresent and pretty wellfits the definition of God.They’ve had all kinds of strange and exotic experiences. That’s why I say in my book, PsiSpies, that if you get into this, your life will never be the same because you will be somuch more expanded in consciousness. Mel Riley once told me they really had problemswith the Psi Spy unit because they were tasked to go look at Russian submarines and hesaid, ‘When you can go out and look through the universe, who wants to go look at aRussian submarine?!’ (laughs) Remote Viewers See CollapsingOzone Layer Between 2005 and 2012WHATEVER THE AGENDAS OF THE NON-HUMANS, I WAS VERY INTERESTEDIN THE FACT THAT REMOTE VIEWERS, IN SOME CASES, EXTENDEDTHEMSELVES INTO THINGS LIKE WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE OZONE ANDHAVE PICKED UP WHAT THEY WOULD DESCRIBE AS ‘FUTURES’ OF THISPLANET IN WHICH THERE IS A COLLAPSE OF THE OZONE THAT IS SERIOUS –BETWEEN 2005 AND 2012 – THAT LEADS TO A VERY DIFFERENT SURFACE LIFEON EARTH. COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THAT IN SOME DETAIL?Right, some of the military trained remote viewers were tasked to look into the future andfind out what the future looks like and what they saw were people living underground andpeople living in domed cities to protect themselves from a harsher environment apparentlydue to increased solar activity and a continuing depletion of the ozone layer. They alsosaw in this grim future that humans were working in conjunction with extraterrestrials.And they saw that the sky was striated in multi-hues of colors like there were chemicals inthe air.From September 21-30, 2006, the average areaof the ozone hole was the largest ever observed, at 10.6 million square miles(27.5 million square kilometers). The blue and purple colors are where there isthe least ozone (loss of 40 million tons of ozone), and the greens, yellows,and reds are where there is more ozone.

It’salready happened and there it is. But when they look into the future, the farther into thefuture they try to look, the more blurry things become. This is interesting to me becausethis would seem to indicate that the future is not etched in stone. The future is in a state offlux. Therefore, we still have the opportunity to change our future by changing our actionsin the present.PEOPLE IN OUR GOVERNMENT KNOW THAT REMOTE VIEWING WORKS, HASPROVIDED THEM VALUABLE INFORMATION AND RAISES A MAJOR QUESTIONAS I CLOSE THE LAST PAGES OF YOUR BOOK. IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE THATOUR GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT STILL HAVE PROFESSIONAL REMOTEVIEWERS WORKING ON OPERATIONS RIGHT NOW.Absolutely. Here’s the way this works. Right now the government would tell you officiallythat they have no formal remote viewing group or organization within the government.Technically, that’s probably true. But what they have done is take individual remoteviewers and embedded them within various groups and organizations. For example, Iunderstand they have a remote viewer within the Navy Seals; they have at least oneremote viewer in the Army Rangers. This only makes sense because what militarycommander would not want somebody near at hand who might at least give him someindication of what’s over the next hill.I also understand there are remote viewers embedded in other government organizationsand the government is also contracting out to former Psi Spies, many of whom are nowteaching and have a cadre of students on hand and they get a contract to go work asession. Then the government gets the raw data from their viewers and they feed that databack to their government sources. In this way, the government has plausible deniability. Ingo Swann's Remote Viewingof Jupiter in Early 1970sJupiter in 2007 by NASA.I WONDER IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN WHAT SEEMS ONE OF THE MOSTIMPORTANT PARTS OF REMOTE VIEWING HISTORY – INGO SWAN WENT OUTTO JUPITER BEFORE WE HAD BEEN THERE WITH SPACECRAFT. COULD YOUSUMMARIZE WHAT HE HAD SEEN IN REMOTE VIEWING BEFORE OURSPACECRAFT WERE THERE?Right. In the early 1970s, Ingo Swann remote viewed the planet Jupiter. And Ingo wrotedown and it was filed and certified that he said Jupiter has a small ring around it; Jupiterhas a weak but present magnetic field; there are cloud banks and under the cloud banks hecould see large, craggy mountains. At that time, no one had gotten a good look at Jupiterand nobody knew any of that, so it was a great big dismissal from the science community.But almost ten years later when the Voyager space probes went out there and began totransmit back data from Jupiter, it was reported in reliable scientific publications thatJupiter has a small ring around it, it has a present magnetic field, they could detectcloudbanks and mountains under the clouds. So, it took almost ten years, but here camethe feedback that showed Ingo Swann’s remote viewing of Jupiter had been dead on. Remote Viewers Report Non-Human Interferencewith American and Soviet Martian Probes"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Phobos 1 and 2 were unmanned Russian satellite probeslaunched to Mars in July 1988. Phobos 1 disappeared on September 2, 1988,near the Martian moon, Phobos. Later, Phobos 2 arrived near the odd Martian moon onMarch 28, 1989, to make a survey of Mars. Suddenly all cameras and transmission abruptlystopped. The above photograph of a disc-shaped shadow with Mars below was captured by twodifferent Phobos 2 color cameras and infrared cameras right before Phobos 2transmission mysteriously ended. Image by Soviet Space Agency, Glavkosmos.The most astounding feedback I mentioned, and it’s detailed in Psi Spies, is that when theMars Observer was lost, I immediately picked up the phone and called the remote viewersI had been dealing with and I asked, ‘What happened to the Mars Observer?’ The MarsObserver had just gone into orbit around Mars and they had high hopes it was going tophotograph and look closely at almost the entire surface of the planet. Then all of asudden, they lost contact and it went away.The remote viewers said, ‘The same thing that happened to the Phobos II.’ The Soviet’sPhobos II named after one of the Martian moons was sent by the Soviets in the late 1980sand it, too, was lost as it went into orbit around Mars. The remote viewers had alreadychecked that out and what they saw was that a circular object rose from the surface ofMars, came out to meet the Phobos II, scanned it with some sort of electromagnetic energy– a beam.(According to the remote viewers), none of this was hostile activity. It was described to meas something like a tugboat coming out to greet the Queen Mary. But once the round thingscanned Phobos II, the disc realized Phobos II was not part of its system. So, the discturned around and went back to the surface of Mars.But in scanning the spacecraft, the disc scrambled the onboard computer of Phobos II andEarth ground controllers lost control over it and eventually the spacecraft burned up in theMartian atmosphere as it crashed. So, there was a heck of a story!But then in the early 1990s, a Soviet cosmonaut (Marina Popovich) was visiting in theUnited States and at a news conference in San Francisco, she held up one of the lastphotographs taken from the Phobos II and it showed a circular object approaching theSoviet spacecraft. Again, amazing feedback for something the Psi Spies had said beforethat they had seen.BUT, JIM, WOULDN’T THAT IMPLY THERE IS CURRENT INTELLIGENCE ONMARS UNDERGROUND OR SOME PLACE THAT IS RELEASING THE PROBES?Absolutely. And this leaves further credence to the argument that beginning with the faceon Mars in the Cydonia region, that NASA has gone to extreme lengths to cover up thisfact and to hide it away and alter photographs and documents and everything else. Theidea that they are keeping secrets about UFOs and activity on Mars and perhaps the moon– that’s been a longstanding narrative within the UFO research community. This tends toconfirm that.BUT HOW HAVE WE MANAGED TO GET THE MOC CAMERA AND THESPACECRAFT GOING AROUND MARS IN ORBIT CURRENTLY IN AIR AS WELLAS SPIRIT AND OPPORTUNITY ROVERS ON THE SURFACE OF MARS?It could be that whoever is on Mars, now they know that we’re sending things there, somaybe they dug down deeper or whatever.Then we’re back again to the allegation that some of the information our government isgetting from Mars is being sequestered and censored and kept from the public.IF INGO SWANN WAS ABLE TEN YEARS BEFORE WE HAD A SPACECRAFT FLYBY JUPITER AND SCIENTIFIC DATA MATCHES WHAT HE HAD REMOTE VIEWEDTEN YEARS BEFORE, ISN’T THAT FACT ENOUGH THAT REMOTE VIEWINGWORKS WELL AND OUR GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE USING IT GENERALLY?Exactly. But again, the people in charge don’t want remote viewing used generallybecause then we might see through all the lies and deceptions that our modern society isbuilt upon and that could cause harm to the bottom corporate line. As a result, I think there"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"has been a concerted effort not only to denigrate remote viewing, but to actually sewdissension and keep the remote viewers themselves squabbling with each other andarguing over protocols and technologies so the public does not get a clear picture.Imagine this, Linda, what if the President of the United Stats was to come on televisionand tell us, ‘There are weapons of mass destruction in this country and we have to gobomb this country to save ourselves and to defend our national security.’ Then out here,you had groups of remote viewers who had been practicing and were pretty good andwould remote view and stand up and say, ‘No, there’s nothing there, folks.’ Obviously, thegovernment controllers can’t have that.” Astronomers Are Publishing Data That Jupiter Could HaveSolid Core As Big As 10 to 20 Earth MassesWhile I was interviewing Jim Marrs, I questioned whether the Voyager and Galileo probeshad confirmed a hard core to Jupiter that might have mountains. On September 13, 2007,I called astronomer and Jupiter expert, Prof. William Hubbard, at the University ofArizona in Tucson, Arizona. He confirmed that:- Jupiter does have a thick ring of silicate dust that comes off its interiormoons.- that Jupiter does have a magnetic field.- Jupiter does have many layers of cloudbanks, each made from differentchemicals. The highest cloud layers are made up from the lightest chemicalsand the denser chemicals make up the lower cloud banks.And to my surprise, I learned that Prof. Hubbard and others, have a paper ready to submitto a major science journal very soon for publication in 2007 that will focus on a growingastronomical controversy: Does Jupiter have a solid core? If so, how large is it?Prof. Hubbard said their paper will feature new computer models and data that indicate alikelihood that Jupiter does have a solid core that could be as large as 10 to 20 Earthmasses. Would that core have mountains? Prof. Hubbard said that currently there is noscientific instrument that could determine the physical nature of the suspected Jupitercore. So, even this year we could have a scientific consensus that Jupiter has a solid core.And that would mean that Ingo Swan remote viewing more than thirty years ago wasnearly 100% correct.
