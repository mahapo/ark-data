Image courtesy Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.Updat e d map: Lake Winnebago in eastern Wisconsin at Oshkosh, Lake Michigan, Lake St. Clair at Warren,Lake Erie and Lake Ontario (all highlighted with red in above map) have had metric tonsof fresh water fish die from lethal viral hemorrhagic septicemia in 2005 through 2006;first die-offs of 2007 have now been reported to USGS. Authorities are trying to keepthe virus from spreading to the other Great Lakes and into the Mississippi River(red underlined lower left) that extends south to New Orleans. May 29, 2007 Madison, Wisconsin - The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resourcesreported on May 24, 2007, that a brown trout that died in Lake Michigan and washedashore near the Kewaunee/ Algoma area preliminarily tested positive for viral hemorrhagicsepticemia, or VHS. The University of Wisconsin-Madison Wisconsin VeterinaryDiagnostic Laboratory conducted the preliminary test on the Lake Michigan trout. Thesample has been sent to an Ames, Iowa, lab to confirm the VHS findings.The deadly fishdisease also spread earlier this month to Lake Winnebago fish in eastern Wisconsin."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The trout is the first Lake Michigan fish to test positive for VHS, but fisheries officialshave suspected for months that the virus was already in the lake because fish from aconnected water, Lake Huron, tested positive for VHS earlier this year.“This is a serious fish disease and we had developed plans to deal with a VHS find in LakeMichigan,” says Mike Staggs, Wisconsin’s fisheries director. “We had already taken stepsin our hatchery and field operations to avoid spreading the disease. In April, we asked theNatural Resources Board to pass emergency rules aimed at preventing anglers and boatersfrom Lake Michigan from spreading the virus to new waters.” The greatest fear now isspread to the Mississippi River and south to New Orleans, Louisiana. VHS can spread when people move alive fish or water carrying the virus to new waters.Infected fish shed the virus into a lake or river through their urine and reproductive fluids.The virus can remain infective up to 14 days and be absorbed by healthy fish. The viruscan also spread when a healthy fish eats an infected fish.Now that the virus has been preliminarily confirmed in fish from Lake Michigan, it’sespecially critical that all boaters, anglers and others who recreate on that water and itstributaries up to the first barrier to fish take the precautionary steps required by theemergency rules, Staggs says.People - humans are not affected by the VHS disease - are prohibited from moving livefish, including bait minnows, to another water, and are required to drain all water fromtheir boat, bilge, bait bucket and live well. Anglers should put their catch on ice to take ithome and should discard minnows in the trash at the landing. People are prohibited fromharvesting live bait from Lake Michigan tributaries over concerns about invasive species. “We’ve held ourselves to the highest standards on disease prevention”and VHS still spreads. - Mike Staggs, Dir., Wisconsin FisheriesDNR has long been testing adult trout and salmon from Lake Michigan to assure the fishthat eggs are collected from do not have any viruses, and disinfecting eggs after theyarrived at hatcheries. When VHS was first discovered in fish in the eastern Great Lakes in2005, DNR started disinfecting eggs before they were brought into the hatcheries andstarted testing fish at the hatcheries when they reached “large fingerling” size, about six to10 inches long, before they were stocked, to assure they didn’t have VHS. DNR also isdisinfecting boats and gear used in the Great Lakes before they are used in other locations.On May 17, following the discovery of VHS in fish from the Lake Winnebago system, thestate Natural Resources Board extended the emergency rules for boaters and anglers tothose waters. DNR took the additional precaution of immediately halting stocking of allfish from DNR hatcheries, transfers of fish among hatcheries, collections of forage fish oreggs from the wild, and all field fish transfers. DNR will maintain those suspensions until itis absolutely sure fish can be stocked safely.VHS is not a threat to people, pets or wildlife, but it can infect a broad range of nativespecies and caused fish kills in several eastern Great Lakes in 2005 and 2006. People canstill eat the fish they catch, but should take precautions to put their catches on ice at thelanding rather than remove live fish from a lake."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WDNR Asks:\"If you catch a diseased fish or observe a fish kill take the following steps:- Note the waterbody, date, fish species, and approximate number ofdead/dying fish.- If you caught a suspicious looking fish, place the fish in a plastic bag andthen in a cooler on ice.- Contact your local fisheries biologist or call the DNR TIP line -1-800-TIP-WDNR - (800) 847-9367.- DO NOT BRING POTENTIALLY DISEASED FISH TO DNR SERVICESTATIONS OR HATCHERIES.- DO NOT COLLECT FISH SAMPLES FROM A FISH KILL.The local fisheries biologist will contact you as soon as they are available andwill make the determination about whether the fish should be examined ornot.We are encouraging anglers to retain suspicious looking fish as part of theirdaily bag limit for examination by the local fisheries biologist.\"Also see: 05/14/07EarthfilesMore Information:More Information:For further information about worldwide threats to earth life, please see reports below inthe Earthfiles Archive:• 05/04/2007 -- Environmental Emergency Updates: Part 1 - Spreading Honey Bee Disappearances - Nosemaceranae Not the Answer?• 03/17/2007 -- Honey Bee Disappearances Continue: Could Pesticides Play A Role?• 02/23/2007 -- Part 1: Earth Life Threats - Alarming Disappearance of Honey Bees• 02/23/2007 -- Scientists Hope \"Amphibian Arks\" Can Save Frogs and Toads• 02/02/2007 -- New U.
