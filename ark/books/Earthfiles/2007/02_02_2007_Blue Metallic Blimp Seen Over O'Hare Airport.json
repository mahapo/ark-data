Hisoffice is near Chicago O'Hare International Airport, but his home is about forty-five milesnorthwest of O'Hare.Between 6 and 6:30 a.m. Chicago time on Tuesday morning, November 7, 2006, John wasin his routine daily commute to his company on the edge of O'Hare. He was traveling asusual on I-90 East toward Chicago. Suddenly, he saw something he had never seen overO'Hare Airport before.November 7, 2006, between 6 and 6:30 a.m., John Smith driving on I-90 Easttoward Chicago O'Hare International Airport highlighted in light blue. \"Blimp UFO\"seemed to be slightly west of the airport. Map by John Smith.Interview:“On I-90 East heading toward the city, I pretty much have the whole overview of theChicago landscape driving in. I do this Monday through Friday every day, approximately a40 to 45 minute drive for me.What I noticed was an object that looked like a blimp at first. It was bluish-grey metalliclooking. I thought it was weird because I’ve seen blimps before coming into the city. I usedto date a girl out near Midway Airport where they had a hangar that had the Fuji blimps.I’ve seen them there all the time. This object was quite large and it was over O’Hare. AndI knew that O’Hare Airport is a restricted airspace. I think there is a 2-mile or 5-mileno-fly zone associated with O’Hare. I saw the object there and it just seemed weird. Ontop of that, it was colder. It’s out of place there."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"John Smith: John Smith: \"This car window photo I took to illustrate for youat about the same time I saw the huge \"blimp\" object on Nov. 7th, between 6 and 6:30 a.m. There is normallythat much traffic in the AM. The way I remember it, I could only compare it to beingthe size of a Zepplin. It was huge, I would say at at least 1000's of feet,if not miles in size.\" For illustration, on January 31, 2007, John Smithtook car window photo on which he placed graphic of \"blimp\" object as he saw it.WAS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING AT THAT SEEMEDVE RY ME TALL IC?Just the color. It was between a bluish and silver color, but more a blue – like a dark bluemetallic. It did not seem real reflective, but it did look metallic.SO YOU WERE NOT SEEING A REFLECTIVE SURFACE?Correct.IF YOU WERE NAMING A BLUE I MIGHT KNOW, WHAT WOULD IT BE?Steel blue is the only thing I can think of that is close to it. Steel blue, a dark metallic blue.WHERE EXACTLY WAS THIS IN RELATIONSHIP TO O’HARE?From my vantage point, it would be O’Hare, or a little west of O’Hare.WAS IT MOVING AT ALL?Yes. Very slow paced, like a blimp would go. Then that sphere kind of thing began to turncounterclockwise and instead of a circle in the sky, it was more disc-shaped. Then I had toconcentrate on my driving. But I did notice the object because it was really out of place.MANY OTHER DRIVERS MUST HAVE SEEN THE OBJECT, TOO?You would think so, but commuters listen to the radio and think about other things.WHY COULDN’T IT HAVE BEEN A BLIMP ?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Just because I’ve never seen blimps over O’Hare. I’ve seen them in the outer portionsbeyond the No-Fly zone. Then there’s the weather. I’ve seen blimps mostly in thesummertime, especially at the Loop air and water show with advertisements flying around.But never near O’Hare and nothing in the winter there.I didn’t know about the afternoon sighting of the thing over O’Hare’s C-17 concourse untila couple of days later (Nov. 8, 2006) when I heard on the radio and saw the reports in theChicago Tribune newspaper.I didn’t put 2 and 2 together until I heard you on George Noory’s Coast to Coast AM andon another program, it was reported that someone else saw a blimp. But most of the otherreports I heard were about a disc-shaped object in the afternoon. I don't know anyone whosaw that. But after listening, that's when I decided to contact you about what I had seenearlier that morning.ABOUT 25 FEET IN DIAMETER AND ABOUT 6 FEET THICK, WHICH WOULD BEQUITE A BIT SMALLER THAN THE OBJECT YOU ARE DESCRIBING.Correct.THE BLIMP-LIKE OBJECT COULD HAVE CARRIED THE SMALLER DISC?Possibly. I know from the vantage point I had, it seemed extremely large.\"More Information:All requests for anonymity are honored. If anyone else saw the \"blimp\" in the morning orthe pearlescent, spinning disc in the afternoon of November 7, 2006, low in the air overO'Hare International Airport, please email me at: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.
