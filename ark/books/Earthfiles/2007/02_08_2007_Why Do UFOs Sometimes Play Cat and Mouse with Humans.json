Battle River,north of Coronation, is also underlined by yellow. Outlined in red is the CanadianForces Base Wainwright (C. F. B. Wainwright). The base has a 620 square kilometertraining range used for live-fire artillery and armor and infantry exercises.February 8, 2007 Calgary, Alberta, Canada - I began interviewing law enforcementand ranchers back in 1979 about the worldwide animal mutilation mystery. Often, I wouldhear about bright, aerial lights that would pace moving cars and trucks, stopping when thedriver stopped, moving when the driver moved, turning when the driver turned - \"like catand mouse games,\" many said.Recently I received another report about a large, bright light that played cat and mousewith a Canadian driver. But that encounter was soon followed by close-up communicationwith what the man describes as a \"powerful, superior being.\"The date was December 1979, right before Christmas. The location was the Battle Rivervalley about twenty miles north of Coronation, Alberta, Canada. The time was around 11PM. Lee Hudson was 24-years-old then and a licensed mechanic. He was getting off worklate and headed for his parents' farm outside Coronation. As he drove over Bedson's Hill,he noticed a bright, amber-colored glare down in the Battle River. Lee could not see whatwas causing the yellow-orange light, so he stopped his car on top of a hill to get a betterlook.Interview:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Click for Earthfiles PodcastLee Hudson, Licensed Mechanic, Calgary, Alberta, Canada: \"I stepped out of the carand I know when I first saw that (glow), my first thought was that it must be some kind ofbrush fire, a fire going on down there. But it just didn't add up because there was snow onthe ground and how and why should there be a brush fire in the middle of winter?Large, amber-yellow light, down near Battle River, Alberta, Canada, Christmas week, 1979.Lee Hudson stopped his car and got out to see the light more clearly.Drawing © 2007 by Lee Hudson.Just as soon as I stepped out of the car and was standing still, I could see the light wasmoving. It was moving eastward and westward, first forward and then backward, up anddown the river valley. But there is no road running east and west along the river. So, rightaway, I just felt a twinge like this doesn’t – of all the things I’ve seen in my life, I’ve neverseen anything I couldn’t explain at that point in time. But this was not adding up. It was avery bright glare, but it was moving in places where there were no roads. It didn’t lookright at all.So I got back in the car. I didn’t really feel fear at that point, but I was wondering, ‘Whaton earth could that be?’I thought I would get moving again and got in the car and went down through the Cooleyand swung east at the intersection. I looked over to the north toward the river and thisthing rose up out of the river bottom. Just within an instant, like one second, it was besidemy car - that's a distance of three miles!Lee Hudson's depiction of the large, amber-yellow, aerial light moving\"within an instant\" from the Battle River to the left side of his car.Drawing © 2007 by Lee Hudson."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"This thing hugged the tree line as it came toward me. It curved in and out along the treeline, making this tremendous arc as it came toward me. The speed this thing was moving, Ido believe any manmade device changing direction at that velocity, the inertia would tearit apart. So, right there I immediately knew that this was nothing like I had ever seen!Then it comes up right beside my car, just hanging off over the field a little ways, likemaybe 50 feet away from the car. It was above the ground at this point. I was still moving.The whole area was lighted up like daylight in the middle of the night. Lee Hudson Tries to Outrun Aerial LightI could have turned my lights off and driven without my lights if I wanted to, it was lightedup everywhere clearly. My first instinct was to accelerate and get away. I had this CoronetSuper Bee with a lot of power. I put the gas down and I took off quite fast, about 100 mphon a gravel road, too fast. This thing just hung right there with me. I don’t really know whyI thought I could outrun it, but it was an instinctive thing. But I could see that I was notgoing to outrun it. Fear started to set in a little bit. So, I put the car up as fast as it would goand I was up around 130 mph. I remember I was having trouble actually controlling thecar.But this thing was right there, right outside my side window. It was so bright that to look atit head on was like trying to look at a welding arc or something. It was so bright! I couldn’treally distinguish depth because of its brightness. But I could tell it was more or lesscircular, like as big as a two-story house and maybe 70 feet in diameter.I carried on for four miles east of there of the intersection. Then you come to a curve inthe road that swings north toward my dad’s farm. I slowed down enough to negotiate thatcurve. I guess I felt the thing would turn with me because it was obviously following me. Iexpected it to turn north, too, I guess.But wrong. It didn’t swing north. So when I started coming around north around the curve,this thing just keeps going straight across right in front of me. I thought I was going to hit it,or it was going to hit me. I remember my windshield just absolutely blotted out with light.When this thing crossed in front of my car, you could see nothing. It was just a blindinglight glaring through the windshield.Large, amber-yellow, aerial light appeared to be on collision coursewith Lee Hudson. Drawing © 2007 by Lee Hudson.I slammed on the brakes to try not to hit it. Somehow it did get passed me without hittingme on its closest approach when it passed in front of my car. I remember I could definitelyhear this sound associated with it, which was not like any sound you hear from anymanmade machine, that’s for sure!The sound I could hear when it crossed in front of my car was a fizzy, static-kind of sound,like a comb running through dry hair, or a cold can of coke you just cracked open and putup to your ear. That’s the sound it made. An electrically static-like sound.This thing passed on in front of me and then stopped out in the field just off to my right, onthe east side of my car and slightly forward. Now, it was like maybe a couple hundred feetfrom me. Still standing up about 20 feet above ground level. It was at that point that Iremember just staring at the thing. I don’t remember how long I looked at it. I thought I"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"looked at it for ten or fifteen seconds. But I was just stunned, amazed. This thing was likenothing I had ever seen. It defied gravity, just stood there in the air.It had just chased me for four miles. So it’s like I go, it goes. I stop, it stops. I’m sittingthere looking at it and I remember thinking, ‘It’s like some kind of little chase game goingon here.’ It’s like it was waiting for me to get going again so they can chase me some more.I got this definite feeling like cat and mouse game.I started the car back up and swung it in reverse. I did not want to go forward because Iwould have to get closer to the thing. To go home, I had to keep going north and I didn’twant to (laughs). So, I started the car up and threw it into reverse and swung it around inthe middle of the road backwards and headed back around the curve I’d just come around.I went back in the direction I’d come from.I got around the curve. Tom Black’s place was just another quarter of a mile back fromwhere I came. So, I did not look behind me. I just headed for Tom Black’s approach(driveway). I remember that when I started to turn into his approach, I slowed downconsiderably and looked back over my shoulder at that point. I got brave enough to lookbehind me once I was headed into Tom’s. I saw the thing lift off and just like in one to twoseconds, I saw this thing negotiate the curvature of the Earth probably a distance of about50 miles to the horizon. It went from the size of a huge house to a pinpoint of light and Icould definitely see it curve as it went out of sight. In that much time, this thing couldaccelerate without torn apart, mind you, and disappear down to a pinpoint of light in oneto two seconds. Anything manmade, I can tell you, would be torn apart.I was still pretty scared at that point, so I drove on into Tom’s and went up and beat on hisdoor. Tom got out of bed, turned on the porch light and he looked out. He asked, ‘What’shappening?’ I told him that this big bright light was chasing me. I knew Tom well becausehe was our neighbor. But Tom was very tired and I could see there was no point carrying itany farther, so we said good night. I felt better after I had talked to another human being(laughs). I thought, ‘Well, I’m going on home. Maybe it won’t come back.’YOU WERE 24 THEN, RIGHT?That’s right.THAT SORT OF SETS THE STAGE FOR A REMARKABLE EVENT THAT TAKESPLACE LATER. Powerful, Superior BeingThe next weekend, I was off work. I was just laying on the couch resting. My Mom andDad had gone to town to shop. I wasn’t reading. I wasn’t watching TV. I was not asleep. Ihad just lain down and closed my eyes.All of a sudden at that instant, something came in the room. Something entered my mom’sliving room, some kind of entity. I was not allowed to look at it. I was immediately madeaware that this being was a powerful being, like an omnipotent kind of being. I wasinstantly aware of its superiority to me. It made you aware that it was far superior to you.LEE, WHY IS IT THAT YOU FELT LIKE YOU COULD NOT LOOK AT IT? DID YOUHAVE TELEPATHIC THOUGHTS IN YOUR MIND? WHAT HAPPENED?This thing immediately began to speak to me, but not in words as such. Just into my mind,it projected its thought into my mind. Unmistakable. It was as crystal clear as you canimagine as far as communication between this being and me. I became instantly paralyzedwhen this thing entered the room. I could not move. I could not open my eyes. Wild horseswould not have opened my eyes. This thing just exerted such a force over you, like anoverpowering, overwhelming force. But I knew in my mind as clear as a bell where itstood. I knew it was standing right beside the couch about a foot away from my side.It was frightening, I can tell you! I’ve never had an experience like it either before orsince. It just was something I’ll never forget.It stood there and immediately started communicating to me, issuing orders at me, militarystyle, one after another - extremely powerful orders, and they were impossible todisregard. You could not disregard these orders. You weren’t allowed to.LEE, DO YOU REMEMBER ANY CONTENT?Yes, I do. As far as the orders themselves, no. It’s strange because I can remember therewere these orders. They are unmistakable. I’ve never forgotten how it barked the orders at"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"me. I had to say, ‘Yes, I understand, absolutely. Yes, I understand perfectly. Yes,absolutely.’This went on and on for like fifteen minutes or so. And I remember answering each order,‘Yes, I understand. Absolutely.’ It was like that. I was not allowed to say no in anymanner.BUT YOU DON’T REMEMBER ANY DETAIL OF THE CONTENT OF THE ORDERS?Not one tiny shred. When this thing finally released me, when it let me go, it disappeared,was gone as quickly as it came. I was released. I got up. I ran out of the house to get someair. I stood outside there and I remember immediately as I got out on the steps, I wasthinking, ‘What were the orders? What were the orders?’ I couldn’t remember anything ofthe actual orders and that is something that has bothered me ever since. What were theorders? I’ve wondered from time to time: ‘Have I carried out these orders subconsciously?Or have I defied these orders?’ Either one is probably equally undesirable. I don’t knowwhether I’ve done the orders or defied them! But I do know that for some reason it choseto blank my mind out as far as what the orders were. It did not blank out that I had beenissued orders. I definitely knew I had been issued orders.THIS WAS ABOUT 30 YEARS AGO?Yes, going on 30 years. Forehead Implant?Fifty-one-year-old Lee Hudson, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.The \"bony knot\" that appeared on the upper right of his forehead soonafter Lee's encounter with \"powerful, superior being.\" Image © 2007 by Lee Hudson.IN THOSE 30 YEARS SINCE THAT TRAUMATIC EVENT, HAS ANYTHING ELSEHAPPENED THAT WOULD FALL INTO THE CATEGORY OF OTHER-THAN-HUMAN INTELLIGENCE IN YOUR LIFE?That same day, later on that day, I noticed a sore spot on the side of my forehead abovemy temple and forward and up a bit. I did not actually notice it until I touched it. Then Inoticed this little sore area. It was on the side of my head that was exposed when this thingwas visiting me. It was tender there, but there was no bleeding. The skin was not broken. Itjust felt tender.Within the months that followed, this tender spot developed into a bony lump on the sideof my forehead and it’s been there ever since. It doesn’t hurt. It’s just there.DO YOU ASSOCIATE IT WITH MONITORING BY THE BEING?I hope not. I have wondered if this thing was tracking me? Is it manipulating me? I don’t"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"know. I’ve wondered about it. I have a daughter who is a registered nurse and this thing onmy forehead gives her the heebie jeebies. (laughs)LEE, HAVE YOU EVER HAD IT X-RAYED?No, I haven’t. I was at a doctor once who asked me, ‘Where did you get that knot?’ Ididn’t really want to go through the story, so I just said, ‘I don’t know.’ He said, ‘Well, ifyou want, I’ll get it removed, if you would like to do it.’ I guess I was afraid to do that. I’venever done that. Agendas?WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY THAT THIS POWERFUL, UNSEEN ENTITY NEXT TOYOU ON THE SOFA YOU WOULD LINK TO WHATEVER WAS IN THE LIGHT THATPLAYED CAT AND MOUSE WITH YOU THE WEEK BEFORE?I definitely do. I link the two as the same event, just days apart. In my mind they aredefinitely associated events. I don’t hallucinate. I’ve never had strange things happenbefore or since.Before the 1979 event happened, I wasn’t really a scientific kind of guy. I was mechanical,yes. But, I wasn’t into physics or science. But since that event, I’ve had many ideas cometo me – most I’m not even looking for. I don’t go looking for ideas, but quite often thesethings will come to me, and often in my sleep. I’ll wake up with an idea about differentthings regarding higher level mechanics, physics.DO YOU ASSOCIATE THAT POSSIBLY WITH WHATEVER THE OBJECT IS THAT’SIN YOUR FOREHEAD?Yes, I do. I associate it with that or with the visitation or orders. I’ve wondered if it mighthave something to do with those orders (by the superior being)?It might be that these beings had something to do with our being here in the first place,which might be their interest in us. They might be sort of watching us and from time totime, interacting and influencing us.WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE PLAYED CAT AND MOUSE WITH?It actually crossed my mind, do you suppose these beings were actually entertainingthemselves. They were going, ‘Look at this earth guy. Let’s just play with this guy a bitand see how he reacts.’ Do you think that’s possible?I WOULD NOT DOUBT IT AT ALL. BUT WHAT WE HUMANS TODAY IN 2007 WHOARE AWARE THAT WE ARE NOT THE ONLY LIFE FORM INTERACTING WITHTHIS PLANET AND WHAT WE ARE CHALLENGED BY IS TO UNDERSTAND THEAGENDAS OF AN APPARENT VARIETY OF NO-HUMANS. IN YOUR CASE,YOU’VE HAD FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE WITH SOMETHING QUITEEXTRAORDINARY. SO, WHAT I’M CURIOUS ABOUT IS WHAT DO YOU THINKTHE ENTITY THAT DEALT WITH YOU IN THE LIGHT AND PLAYED CAT ANDMOUSE AND THEN LATER APPEARED, NOT ALLOWING YOU TO SEE IT,PARALYZING YOU BUT GIVING YOU ORDERS. WHAT DO YOU THINK THEAGENDA IS?Well, it could be frightening. I’ve had this feeling that it’s possible the agenda that theyhave might have to do with the prevention of our destruction, our own self-madedestruction. That is one possibility. They might be trying to intervene, but in a frighteningsort of a way.These beings definitely mean business. I can tell you that. They mean business! Whateverthey are telling us, when you come face-to-face with them, like I did, boy oh boy! There isno joking around them. It’s serious stuff. There are no words I can come up to describe theseriousness that this thing impressed on me. It’s impossible to describe in words.AND YET ISN’T THAT THE METAPHOR FOR THE LAST DECADES ANDMILLENNIA – YOU HAD THIS INCREDIBLY SOBERING EXCHANGE WITH APROFOUND INTELLIGENCE, BUT YOU AS A HUMAN DON’T6 REMEMBERANYTHING IN DETAIL.That’s right.IT MAKES YOU WONDER – WHAT IS THE AGENDA? WHAT WAS IMPARTED T OYOU? AND LEE, DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHAT COULD BE COMING IN"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THE NEXT FIVE TO SIX YEARS OR SO?I think I do, yes. I’ve had this feeling of foreboding about the not too distant future. I thinkwe’re back on the nuclear holocaust doorstep.SO WHERE DO YOU THINK IT COULD ALL BE HEADED?I think it’s headed for holocaust, unless there is some kind of intervention.”More Information:For further information about the UFO phenomenon, please see reports below: inEarthfiles Archives and in my books and documentaries listed in the Earthfiles Shop:• 02/07/2007 -- Part 11: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 01/30/2007 -- Part 10: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 01/16/2007 -- Part 9: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 01/02/2007 -- Grey Aerial Disk Reported by Chicago O'Hare United Airlines Pilots and Mechanics• 12/27/2006 -- Part 7: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 12/18/2006 -- Part 6: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 12/14/2006 -- Abductee Jim Sparks's Encounter with Reptillian Beings, Their Warning and Possible Agenda• 12/11/2006 -- Part 5: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 12/06/2006 -- Part 4: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 11/28/2006 -- Part 2: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 11/27/2006 -- Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue © 1957 by Leonard H.
