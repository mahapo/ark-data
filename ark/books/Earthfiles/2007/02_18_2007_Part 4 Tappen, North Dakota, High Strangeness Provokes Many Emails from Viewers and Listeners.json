By theend of February 2002 I got Activated for a Homeland Security mission. I wasshipped to a secured (guards 24/7) military reservation in California namedCamp Roberts. I was there with many other soldiers getting activated also.Late one night, while sleeping in the bay (about 12 guys in one room) in thebarracks, I was awakened by something next to my bed and I felt a jolt gothrough my lower right leg. As I came more fully aware, I saw a rather tall,'grey,' lanky-type alien at the foot of my bed. I tried to pull myself up, but heraised his right arm palm outward. As it did this, I started to fall asleep againstmy will.The ensuing morning, I woke to find a thin red line, laser sharp, on the insideof my right shin/calf area with a dot on both sides of the line. The line was7/8ths of an inch long and about 2 millimeters wide (appx. 3/32 inch). It wasbright red, but not a scratch or anything. The edges were very well-defined. Aweek earlier I had a small lump in that spot. How would I remember that?Good question, my dad died of cancer. Anytime I get a lump, I take notice.My lump was gone that morning (after grey's appearance).\"20) Fairview, North Carolina Date Unknown Adult Female\"I was one of millions to see the bright light in the northern sky on Wed., Jan.24, 2007. BUT..... That's not the first time I've seen it. The first time I saw the'light,' it looked like a spark from a welder - only brighter. It had a real longtail that almost looked like it might have little sparks at the end of the tail. Icame in and told my boyfriend about it and he said he had seen the same thingearlier in the week.The strangest thing about this is that later that night I discovered a strange redmark on my forearm. It was kind of like an indention. There were 7 smallmarks that were arranged in a circle, shaped like a flower or star of some kind."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I've retraced my every step and still cannot figure out what it was, or where itcame from, but it stayed there on my arm for 4 days. Then just went away asquickly as it appeared. There was never any pain or anything like that. I amstarting to wonder if I've had some kind of close encounter.\"7-pointed geometric pattern in red discovered on right forearm of adult femaleafter she saw a strange light in the night sky. Image courtesy female eyewitness. 21) Suburb of Portland, Oregon Late July 1972 Young Adult Male\"I was working the swing shift at the local sawmill. I got off work at 2 AM,and was out running around. About 3 AM, I was headed into the local townand came around a corner. I saw a bright light above a house. I thought it wasthe moon, but the moon was behind me. I know because I had taken picturesof it that night, about 20 minutes before.The object was about 600-1000 feet a ways from me. I pulled over andstopped. It was hovering over a small house about 20-30 feet in the air. Theobject was round and lighted up the whole area. It was about twice the size ofthe house, maybe 100 feet in diameter. I sat and watched it for about 20minutes. I took several pictures of the object. Since it was below the tree line,I figured that this would be a good scale of the object. It then flashed twiceand dimmed down in brightness, and started to move. I jumped into my carand gave chase. It stayed about 200 feet off the ground and made no noise. Ichased it for over 2 miles at close to 100 mph and it keep getting farther away.I stopped at a little store and called the local sheriff's office and reported it.This is where it gets strange. Three days later, I was in bed asleep when mymother woke me up. She said I had visitors. I went downstairs and there weretwo men in the front room. They were dressed in black, including hat andsunglasses. They were very pale in color and wore dark glasses. They askedme about the sighting and asked if I had pictures. I said yes, but hadn't gotthem developed yet. They told me never to talk about this ever.The next I remember was waking up in bed. The camera, which had been inmy car, was gone, along with all the film.\"22) Notre-Dame-duLaus, Quebec, Canada November 1975 Adult Male\"After reading your Tappen, N.D. high strangeness report, you requested thatpeople come forward with their stories. My story is rather unusual.Late November l975, I was a 44-year-old RCAF Sergeant. One weekend, Ivisited my in-laws with my wife, 14-yr-old son and 11-yr-old daughter inNotre-Dame-du-Laus, Quebec. Sunday night upon my returning home to myairbase in Ottawa, Ontario, I was about halfway home on Highway #309entering the sleepy village of Notre-Dame-de-la-Salette. Crossing a highwayintersection, I was suddenly cut off by a strange vehicle. I was driving south."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"This strange vehicle came from the east after crossing a bridge over the Lievreriver. It turned right and narrowly missed hitting my car.This was a dark, misty, rainy night and the village street was completelydeserted. My wife kept saying repeatedly ''What is it? What is it?'This object was a round, metallic disc with no windows, lights or bumpers andno wheels. It certainly looked like a UFO. I started chasing it. The faster Idrove, the faster it went. Two minutes later, we were out of the hamlet andrushing south on Highway #309. The faster I went, the faster it went and itstarted to wobble, veering right and left. Each side of the road, there was alarge deep trench with a high embankment topped with a wired fence mileslong. This UFO attempted to fly off the road, wobbling barely over the fenceand then collapsed back on the road ahead of me. I was by then going over100 mph when it suddenly veered to the left entering into a narrow dirt road.This object had the width of one and a half highway lanes and the heightwould be about the height of my car hood. No noise. This vehicle was totallyquiet. We were all by now very shaken and my kids totally speechless. I madea formal report to the National Research Council of Canada.To make things odder, the following weekend since we were so shook up, wedecided to tell the whole family in Notre-Dame-du-Laus about our adventure.So off again to NDduLaus. It was Sunday night again and it was about ll PMwhen we headed for Ottawa. And of course, halfway there we crossed thevillage of NDSalette. We all were thinking about last weekend and thank Godeverything seemed normal. However, a mile down the road after exiting thevillage and it was raining as usual, I notice a parked Pontiac on the roadside.The car seemed occupied, but had no headlights on.My wife, being the good samaritan, said: 'Since it's past midnight and nogarage is open and we're forty miles from the nearest town, they might needassistance. Stop and go and check.\" I parked the car directly in front of thePontiac, got out and headed toward this car. It was totally dark and I couldbarely make out what was inside. I rapped on the driver side front doorwindow asking, 'Are you alright? Do you need any help?' No reply. I rappedon the right side rear door window again on both left front and rear windows.No movement. So I peered deeply with both my hands cupped on each side ofmy brow trying to look inside. My hair stood right up on end.Inside, there were four dark-shaped passengers with black trench coats andraised collars staring straight ahead. I managed to get enough courage torepeat: 'Are you alright? Do you need any help?' Finally I perceived that thenearest passenger seemed to slightly nod his head as a Yes. I then slowlyturned around and headed toward my car. Suddenly, the Pontiac headlights litup, the motor revved up. I thought I was going to die. However, the carveered on to the road and zoomed down the highway and coincidently??turned left entering the strange dirt road that last week's UFO disappearedinto. This happened 3l years ago and my children, who are now grown adultswith children of their own, still refuse to talk about it.\"23) Wisconsin 1950s - 1960s Young Female Born in 1948\"I decided to write to you after reading the experiences of others in responseto the Tappen, North Dakota farm story.I am 59-yrs-old. I have had a lifetime of strange occurrences. My earliestmemories are at 4-years-old, staying with my aunt and uncle at their summerhome in Wisconsin. I was playing outside one day, and I looked up and sawabout 5 or 6 'silver monkeys' trying to climb in the bathroom window. I got upto go into the house and tell my aunt, and thatâs all I remember. Later, she wasgiving me a bath and I asked her to close the window because I didnât wantthe silver monkeys to come in. She said there were no silver monkeys. I wetthe bed that night.The next significant incident that I experienced happened on Palm Sunday,but for some reason, I canât pinpoint the year. I was in high school, I think myfreshman year. I was coming home from Mass. It was about 7:15 am. ForWisconsin, it was a beautiful, but cool misty morning. I felt absolutely ecstaticdespite the problems I had at home. My walk home was at least a mile.I was at a usually busy intersection, but early on Sunday morning, there waslittle traffic. I was waiting for the street light to turn green, when something"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"told me to look in the sky behind me. When I looked, it seemed to be the sunrolling like a wheel in the sky. I knew the sun didnât move, so I was veryintrigued as to what it was. All of a sudden there was an incredible, beyond-human-experience-fear that seemed to be projected onto me. I 'heard,' in myhead, 'Letâs get her!' And in my head, I screamed a very loud 'NO!' There wasa lady standing at the bus stop next to me who stood there like a statue. I triedto get her attention, but got no response.The end of this experience is that I saw the rolling sun object take off,although I donât know when this occurred. It was the classic flying saucer-shaped object with a translucent aluminum type material on it. The inner partstarted spinning counter clockwise, and the outer part was spinning clockwise,and a substance like molten brass was shooting out of the rim. It went so fastup in the sky. I stood there totally amazed that it could go so fast. Also, I thinkit was at this time, or maybe when it landed, that it seemed to be enclosed in acube of air(?) that was kind of shimmering like mirage waves.The next thing I remember was walking into my house, and mother askedwhere I had been. I would go to early Mass, so my younger brother and sistercould go the childrenâs Mass at 9:00am. It was almost 9:00 when I got home. Inever told my mother about the experience.Now, I donât know if this information is significant to my experience - Ithought it was back then. That Sunday in 1960 or 1961, the Pope wassupposed to reveal the 3rd secret of Fatima. We were all expecting somethingterrible to be revealed. As it turned out, the secret was not revealed.\"More Information:For further information about the UFO phenomenon, please see reports below: inEarthfiles Archives and in my books and documentaries listed in the Earthfiles Shop:â¢ 02/07/2007 -- Part 11: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blueâ¢ 01/30/2007 -- Part 10: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blueâ¢ 01/16/2007 -- Part 9: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blueâ¢ 01/02/2007 -- Grey Aerial Disk Reported by Chicago O'Hare United Airlines Pilots and Mechanicsâ¢ 12/27/2006 -- Part 7: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blueâ¢ 12/18/2006 -- Part 6: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blueâ¢ 12/14/2006 -- Abductee Jim Sparks's Encounter with Reptillian Beings, Their Warning and Possible Agendaâ¢ 12/11/2006 -- Part 5: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blueâ¢ 12/06/2006 -- Part 4: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blueâ¢ 11/28/2006 -- Part 2: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blueâ¢ 11/27/2006 -- Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue Â© 1957 by Leonard H.
