August 31, 2007 Stratham, New Hampshire - Before I knew anything about theworldwide animal mutilation mystery linked to non-humans, I remember the first time Iever thought seriously about something from outer space coming to Earth and actuallyinteracting with people.It was 1975, and I watched a TV program called “The UFO Incident.” It was a docudramare-enactment of the alleged UFO and non-human encounter that Betty and Barney Hilldescribed occurring in the White Mountains of New Hampshire on September 19th to20th, 1961 – 46 years ago.[ Editor's Note: The couple was portrayed by James Earl Jones and EstelleParsons in the 1975 television movie The UFO Incident, and by Basil Wallaceand Lee Garlington in the 1996 television series Dark Skies.]The UFO Incident so provoked my interest that I got the book the broadcast was based on.That book is, An Interrupted Journey written by John Fuller and first published in 1966 incooperation with Betty and Barney Hill and the psychiatrist who did their hypnosis,Benjamin Simon, M. D., in Boston.Dr. Simon did eleven hypnosis sessions with Betty and Barney Hill, beginning on February22, 1964, and ending four months later on June 27, 1964.The reason the Hills asked Dr. Simon for help was Barney’s physical and mentaldeterioration and suffering after the September 1961 encounter. So, Dr. Simon began thefirst two hypnosis sessions with Barney, who was very soft-spoken and repressed. As areality check on Barney’s fear and panic about cat-eyed, grey-skinned beings literallycapturing Barney and Betty from Route 3 where they were driving in the New Hampshire"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"mountains, Dr. Simon also hypnotized Betty.Those hypnosis tapes recorded by Dr. Simon were the heart of a research project byBetty’s niece, Kathleen Marden. Kathy wanted to compare what Barney and Betty hadsaid in their separate hypnosis sessions with Dr. Simon – and to travel the route herselffrom Franconia Ridge and Indian Head in the White Mountains to the Hill’s home inPortsmouth.Kathleen amassed reams of meticulous notes, family photographs and had her ownmemories of being with her aunt and uncle, Betty and Barney, many times after the 1961encounter – until Barney’s unfortunate and early death in 1969 and Betty’s in 2004. Kathyasked long-time UFO investigator and nuclear scientist, Stanton Friedman, to help hercreate a book. Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience: The true story ofthe world's first documented alien abduction, co-authored by Kathleen Marden andStanton Friedman, was published in August 2007.The title is what Barney said to Betty that fall 1961 night in great fear. He had stopped thecar and got out with his binoculars. He was looking at a disk-shaped craft about 80 feetabove him. There in a window back lighted by blue-white light, he could see agrey-skinned humanoid wearing a hat who had eyes like a cat’s with vertical pupils.Barney felt the cat-eyed being's eyes were taking hold of Barney’s mind and mentallywarning him not to reach for the gun he carried in his pocket. Then Barney had the distinctfeeling he and Betty were going to literally be “captured” by the cat-eyed entity.Historically, Betty and Barney Hill were the first documented case in what has come to beknown as the \"human abduction syndrome\" in which non-human entities take humansfrom bedrooms, cars, yards, parks and other human environments into round rooms aboardwhat the human abductees assume are craft from outer space controlled by the non-humanentities. During these events, human subjects often describe medical examinations,extractions of sperm or ova, mind downloads to and from the aliens, and sometimeslearning sessions in front of 3-dimensional screens, holographic spaces or wall maps.Betty and Barney Hill (Barney died in 1969; Betty died in 2004) with their dachshund, Delsey,who was with them on their trip through the White Mountains of New Hampshire en routeto Portsmouth when Something stopped their car. Image from Kathleen Marden.Professional Backgrounds of Betty and Barney HillKathleen Marden told me that her aunt Betty Hill was a social worker for the State of NewHampshire. Barney was employed by the Boston, Massachusetts, post office making longcommutes, and was also very involved in the civil rights movement. He was a civil rightsleader and there is an archival collection about his political leadership at the University ofNew Hampshire in the Milnes Special Collections Library. Betty and Barney Hill wereinvited guests at Lyndon B. Johnson’s Presidential Inauguration.Betty and Barney were also involved with the Office of Economic Opportunity infounding the Rockingham County Community Action Program in New Hampshire andBarney was the first executive director of that program.Kathleen told me, \"I think it’s important that people know what highly credible individualsthey were and how they never wanted this story to be made public. When newspaperwriter, John Lutrelle, first approached them in August 1965 and wanted to interview them,they refused. When they realized he might go ahead anyway and do a newspaper article onthem and their experience, they contacted two separate lawyers to attempt to prevent himfrom writing the article and publishing it. They were afraid that it would have a negative"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"impact on not only their reputations, but on their work in the community. They might evenlose their jobs as a result of this sort of thing. Betty and Barney did not want publicattention.\"So, I asked Kathleen how the John Fuller book emerged?Kathy explained, \"John Lutrelle published his articles starting October 25, 1965, in theBoston Herald Traveler. They ran for a series of five nights. This brought worldwideunwanted publicity to Betty and Barney and they decided for the first time to speakpublicly. They spoke in a church in Dover, New Hampshire. There was an Air Forceinformation officer there from Pease AFB who introduced them.[ Editor's Note: On September 21, 1961, Betty telephoned Pease Air ForceBase in Portsmouth and Newington, New Hampshire, to report their UFOencounter. But fearing ridicule, Betty she withheld some details. OnSeptember 22, 1961, Major Paul W. Henderson telephoned the Hills for amore detailed interview, lasting about 30 minutes. Henderson's report, datedSeptember 26, 1961, determined that the Hills had probably misidentified theplanet Jupiter. His report was forwarded to Project Blue Book, the U.S. AirForce's UFO research project.]John Fuller was at that lecture. He talked with Betty and Barney that evening andproposed that he be permitted to tell their story in a book in order to set their story straight.Much of what had been published in the newspaper was incorrect. So, Betty and Barneydecided that since the story had already gone public against their wishes, and it was nothaving the negative impact they thought it would have, they would cooperate with JohnFuller and permit a book to be written (The Interrupted Journey © 1966 by John G. Fullerwith Introduction by Benjamin Simon, M. D.)Recently I asked Kathleen what her aunt and uncle consciously remembered in themountains and told the family back in 1961. I also asked her if I could share with theEarthfiles and Coast radio audiences some excerpts from the original 1964 hypnosissessions by Dr. Benjamin Simon. She agreed.Interview:Betty and Barney Hill were returning from a brief vacation to their Portsmouth,New Hampshire, home on the evening of September 19, 1961. At Franconia Notch(green circle on map), a light that had been moving oddly in the sky came within 1,000 feetof their car and was a \"spinning, lighted craft.\" By Indian Head, the spinning craft pulled infront of their car about 80 to 100 feet high and Barney stopped the car in the middle of the road.Then the craft \"arced\" to a field away from the road only about 50 feet above the Hills.Through his binoculars, Barney could then see a humanoid at a disc window back lightedby blue-white light; the being's eyes had vertical pupils like a cat."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Blue square is where Barney stopped car in middle of road after spinning disc craftcame down near front of their car. That's where he and Betty saw the humanoids comingtoward them. For the walk to the craft in upper left, Barney was \"supported\" by two beingswho dragged him so that the tops of his shoes were scratched. At the clearing marked \"craft,\"was a large disc which Betty was afraid to enter, but the humanoids made them enterfor physical examinations.

Marden, retired public and private school teacher, education servicescoordinator and co-author with Stanton Friedman of the August 2007 book,Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience - The true story of the world’sfirst documented alien abduction: “All she told the family about was having a closeencounter with a UFO in the White Mountains, New Hampshire. Consciously, only Barneyhad viewed the beings onboard the craft (through binoculars) and that is when he went tothe field adjacent to the car with binoculars when the UFO shifted from hovering abovethe car to the adjacent field. Betty remained in the car and from what I can figure out, theinterior light was on because the driver side’s door was open (Barney had gotten out withhis binoculars). So, Betty didn’t observe the craft in the field and did not observe thebeings on board. That was Barney.They had a conscious memory of having this spinning, lighted craft come within 1000 feetof them in Franconia Notch. It was traveling in a stair step pattern. It was bouncingforward and then receding and obviously spinning the entire time.When they were south of Franconia Notch in the area of Indian Head, Barney decided thathe wanted to pull over to the side of the road to get a better look at this craft. Now, as hewas looking for a place to pull over, the craft suddenly shifted ahead of them and hoveredonly 80 to 100 feet above their vehicle and just to the right of it.Illustration of aerial craft suddenly swooping in front of Betty andBarney Hill driving near Franconia Notch, New Hampshire.Car model should have been a brown 1957 Chevy Bel Air,instead of the 1964 in this illustration at UFOCasebook.Barney at that point was forced to stop the car and he stopped it directly in the center ofthe road. An oncoming vehicle, if there had been one, wouldn’t have been able to pass byhim.At that point, he took his binoculars, exited the car, looked at the UFO through thebinoculars as it hovered above the car and it was only 80 to 100 feet above, as I saidbefore, and Barney’s arms were jiggling. So, he stepped away from the car.Betty at that time was observing the craft through the car window. At that time, it hadstopped spinning. It was a saucer-shaped craft. It had a double row of windows and therewas a bright blue-white light coming from behind those windows.The craft then, in an arc-like fashion, glided to the adjacent field, which was to Barney’s"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"left. And he walked into that field to observe the craft through binoculars, while Bettyremained in the car watching for oncoming traffic. When he was in the field, the craft thendescended lower to within what Barney estimated was about 50 feet from him. He lookedup at it through binoculars and observed beings standing in the window.Illustration after Barney walked to field to get closer look at aerial craft throughhis binoculars and he could see humanoids at windows back lighted by blue-white light.One of the humanoids was wearing a hat and had cat eyes with vertical pupils.Oil painting © 2007 by Patrick Richard.Very rapidly, all of them at once, except for one who remained in the window, turned andmoved toward what appeared to be some type of panel on the other side of this hallway.As they moved to that panel, they started to do something with their arms. At that point,red lights started to telescope out of the sides, out of each side of the craft, on whatappeared to be very short bat-like, fin-type wings (or struts). And something started todrop down from the bottom of the craft.Betty and Barney Hill later showed investigator Walter Webb and others Barney'sdrawing of the craft and humanoids at the back lighted windows as he saw the aerialobject only about 50 feet above him through binoculars at Indian Head,New Hampshire, the night of September 19, 1961.The being in the window continued to look at Barney and was terribly frightening. Barneyfelt they were about to carry out some type of plan and he said it was the precision of their"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"movements that frightened him so badly. He attempted to pull the binoculars from hiseyes, but he could not do so. Barney attempted to reach for his gun, but his arms wouldnot move to his coat pocket. His arms kept going upward. Barney felt that he was being –or was in the process of losing his ability to take self-initiated action – that he was comingunder the control of this (leader) being who was somehow communicating to Barney tostay where he was and keep looking (at the leader) – that no harm would come to him.Under hypnosis, Barney Hill sketched humanoid he saw through his binocularswearing a hat and scarf with cat eyes standing at one of the back lighted windows in theaerial craft the night of September 19, 1961, near Indian Head, New Hampshire.Illustration made at time of 1964 hypnosis sessions with BenjaminSimon, M. D., of the \"Leader\" Barney stared at through binoculars and who seemedto take control of Barney's mind. Illustration © 1964 by David Baker.At that point, Barney was terrified and felt that he was about to be captured. But Barneysaid on the (hypnosis) tapes, he didn’t know what they were going to capture him for.Then he managed to pull the binoculars down away from his face and to run, eitherlaughing or crying hysterically – Betty was not sure which – back to the car and informedBetty that he thought they were about to be captured.Barney put the car into first gear and swiftly took off down U. S. Highway Route 3 – that’sthe route they were traveling on, the major north/south route through northern NewHampshire at that time.Then, when they were within just a few blocks away from where they had stopped, thecouple heard a series of what Barney referred to as ‘electronic buzzing’ sounds. Bettyreferred to them as ‘electronic beeping’ sounds that seemed to be bouncing off the trunk ofthe car. It caused their car to vibrate and this tingling, vibrating kind of feeling seemed topass through their bodies as well.\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Hypnosis ExcerptsFebruary 22, 1964 to June 27, 1964Barney Hill in hypnosis session at the Boston office of Benjamin Simon, M.

I saw a group of men and they were standing in the highway and it was brightly litup as if it was almost daylight, but not day.

And whenthe groups started coming up, Barney tried to start the car.\"Barney Hill: \"I thought I saw a cluster of 6 men because they came to me and 3 did not. Ididn’t think of the man in the sky in the machine that I saw. I just saw these eyes andclosed mine and I got out of the car and I put my left leg on the ground and two menhelped me out and I did not walk. I felt like I was being supported.\"Illustration of Betty Hill being guided by non-humans through field near Indian Head,New Hampshire, on September 19, 1961, to landed craft © 2007 by Patrick Richard.Betty Hill: \"And I turn around and think, ‘Barney, wake up! Barney, why don’t youwake up?’ And he doesn’t pay any attention. The object was on the ground.\"Benjamin Simon, M. D.: \"THE OBJECT WAS ON THE GROUND?\"Betty Hill: \"I think it was the same one I was watching in the sky. There were trees, apath and this clearing. The object I could see just about filled up the clearing. And they aretaking me up into the object. I don’t want to go on it! I don’t know what’s going to happenif I go on it. I don’t want to go on it!\"Barney Hill: \"That’s funny – I thought of my feet thumping on the ground and they aregoing up smoothly. But I’m afraid to open my eyes because I am being told strongly tokeep my eyes closed and don’t open them. (Pause) I don’t want to be operated on.\"Betty Hill: \"The man beside me says to go on. He’s a little angry with me. He said, ‘Oh,go on! The longer you stay out here, the longer it’s going to take. You might as well go onand get it over with and get back to your car. We haven’t got much time either.’So, I still don’t want to go. But each one takes an arm and I get sort of a helpless feeling.There wasn’t much I could do at this point except go along with them. And I go up theramp. We go inside and there is a corridor to the left. We go up the corridor. There’s aroom and they took me in the room. I’m standing in the doorway and turn around, waitingfor the others to bring Barney in. But they don’t do this. They lead Barney past the doorwhere I’m standing.So, I said, ‘What are you doing with Barney? Bring him in here where I am.’ The mansays, ‘No. We only have equipment enough in one room to do one person at a time. If we"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"took you both in the same room, it would take too long.’ Non-Human Medical ExaminerIllustration of the \"medical examiner\" © 2007 by Patrick Richard.Then, the doctor, the examiner, says he wants to do some tests. He wants to check mynervous system. He wants to find out how my nerves and his nerves are different. I think Ihope I would never have the nerve to go around kidnapping people right off the highwayslike he’s done!He tells me to take off my dress and then before I hardly have a chance to stand up to doit, the examiner – my dress has a zipper down the back. And the examiner – the zippergoes down to my waist – and so I slip my dress off.I don’t have my dress or my shoes on. The next over from me is a stool and then sort of inthe middle of the room is a table. It’s not up very high, about the height of a desk. I liedown on the table on my back and he brings over this - oh, how can I describe that? Theyare like needles. There is a whole cluster of needles and each needle has a wire runningfrom it. I don’t know, they are coming out of a gadget on the end of these needles. I thinkit’s something like a TV picture screen. You know how a TV, when the picture’s not on,you get all these kinds of lines? Something like that. So, he puts me down on the table andthey bring the needles over. They don’t stick the needles into me, but they touch me withthe needles. I feel a needle touching and it does not hurt at all.It’s some kind of record they are making. I don’t know just what it is. Then they roll meover on my back and then the examiner has a long needle in his hand. And I see the needleand it’s bigger than any needle I’ve ever seen (very upset, crying).I ask him what he’s going to do with it? And he says he just wants to put it in my navel.(crying and gasping for air)Don’t do it! Don’t do it! But he sticks the needle into my navel. (cries) It’s hurting – takeit out! Take it out!And then the leader goes over and he puts his hands in front of my eyes and he says I’ll beall right. I won’t feel it. And all the pain goes away."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Illustration of \"Leader\" based on hypnosis description byBarney Hill © 1964 by David Baker.I asked the leader, ‘Why did they stick the needle in my navel?’ And he said it was apregnancy test!

No one wouldever believe me and that most people didn’t even know he (alien) was alive (that there wasother living intelligence in the universe). What I needed was some proof that this reallyhappened. He laughed and asked what kind of proof did I want, what would I like?And I said if he could give me something to bring back with me, then people would believeit. And so he told me to look around and maybe I could find something I would like totake. And I did. It wasn’t much around, but on the cabinet there was a book – a fairly bigbook. So, I put my hand on the book and said, ‘Could I have this?’He told me to look in the book and I did. They have pages with writing, but not likeanything I’d ever seen before. It looked almost like - I don’t know – it wasn’t a dictionary.Maybe – I don’t know – the writing did not go across. It went up and down. It had sharplines and they were, some were very thin and some were medium and some were veryheavy. It had some dots. It had some straight lines and curved lines. And I was taking it toread. This was going to be my proof that this happened. This was my proof!The leader said I could have the book if I wanted it. I picked it up and I was delighted.This was more than I had ever hoped for! And I’m standing there and I’m saying I’venever seen anything like the book and I was very pleased he had given it to me and thatmaybe some way in time I could figure out how to read it.So then I asked him where he was from.
