Is it a \"sundog\"where sunlight reflects off icy, dusty rings? All Cassini-Huygens spacecraftimages courtesy NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute.Update - Email from an employee at the Space Science Institute in Boulder,Colorado, on June 23, 2007: \"I enjoy visiting your Earthfiles website for news on topics one normallydoesn't hear much about, and your reports to Coast to Coast which I listen towhen I stay up late working on art projects or photographs. I like that you'rekeeping on top of the disappearing bees situation.About your recent Earthfiles report, What Is the Moving Light in Saturn'sRings? A Sundog? The bright spots in the four images are not a sundog. It'scalled the 'opposition effect' and is seen in the rings whenever Cassini islooking in the exact same direction as the sunlight. It's due to sunlightilluminating everything face-on (what astronomers call 'zero phase angle') andtherefore, no shadows exist.I work at the Space Science Institute, doing most of the image processing forthe Cassini cameras in one of the groups.\"Editor's Note: Space Science Institute: \"The opposition effectexists because of two contributing factors. One is due to the factthat the shadows of ring particles directly opposite the Sun fromCassini–the region of opposition–fall completely behind theparticles as seen from the spacecraft. These shadows are thus notvisible to the spacecraft: all ring particle surfaces visible toCassini are in sunlight and therefore bright. Away from the regionof opposition, the ring particle shadows become more visible toCassini and the scene become less bright. The surge in brightnessfalls off in a circular fringe around that point.\"Another contributing factor to the opposition surge is an opticalphenomenon called “coherent backscatter.” Here, theelectromagnetic signal from the rays of scattered sunlight, makingtheir way back to the spacecraft, is enhanced near the region ofopposition because, instead of canceling, the electric andmagnetic fields comprising the scattered radiation fluctuate inunison.The July 23, 2006, images were taken in visible light with theCassini spacecraft wide-angle camera at a distance ofapproximately 262,000 kilometers (163,000 miles) from Saturn.Image scale in the radial, or outward from Saturn, direction is 13kilometers (8 miles) per pixel.\" June 20, 2007 Pasadena, California - A year ago on July 23, 2006, the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft orbiting Saturn took a series of images of the rings that were receivedback on earth at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, on July 24,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2006.Here is the page of raw images: http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/raw/raw-images-list.cfm?StartRow=33&cacheQ=1&browseLatest=0&storedQ=1442726http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/raw/raw-images-list.cfm?StartRow=33&cacheQ=1&browseLatest=0&storedQ=1442726Enlargements of the Four FramesShowing Light Moving Along Saturn's RingsThe four images are numbered in sequence and I have arranged them in order below. Youcan clearly see the light changes position from one ring band in image W00016503 to afurther ring band in image W00016506. The NASA/JPL text states that the images were\"taken on July 23, 2006, and received on Earth July 24, 2006. The camera was pointingtoward SATURN-RINGS at approximately 209,976 kilometers (130,500 miles) away, andthe image was taken using the CL1 and CL2 filters. This image has not been validated orcalibrated. A validated/calibrated image will be archived with the NASA Planetary DataSystem in 2007.\"On July 23, 2006, the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft camera was focused on Saturn's rings."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Four images showed a bright spot in the rings.
