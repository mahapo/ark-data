Crop Formations,Two Mysterious Grass Circles in Mission, Kansas© 2007 by Linda Moulton Howe \"Something has really knocked the heck out of the energy in the larger circle– and somewhat in the smaller circle.\" - W. C. Levengood, BiophysicistMonday, May 21, 2007, around 4 PM local time in Mission, Kansas,(suburb of Kansas City, Kansas), homeowner James Gravatt discovered two circles swirledin the high native grass of his unmowed front yard. Photograph © 2007 by James Gravatt.June 5, 2007, Earthfiles viewer's comment on the Mission, Kansas, grass circles:\"I grew up in Kansas west of Kansas City near I-70 mile marker 290. Living inthe country and working on my family's farm, I have witnessed many(probably twenty or more) circles that look like the Mission, KS circles. Thesecircles are different than an area where animals have slept in tall grass. Thecircles we experienced varied greatly in size from a few feet across to as largeas 30ft across and all seem to form a rotational pattern. They wouldsometimes appear overnight in hay meadows where we were baling the prairiegrass or in our yard. These circles were not ignored and there were manytheories as to what made them.\"The 'old-timers' would say that the circles were on top of Indian burial sites,but could not offer any explanation as to why or how they were made. In myyouth I had a few experiences with ORBS. It was my conclusion that the orbscould have been responsible for these perfect circles in the grass. That is stillmy conclusion. I have watched for your analysis of these events over theyears and still have not read, seen or heard a plausible explanation thatpersuades me to accept any other means than these ORBS. How aboutexpaining them? There is NO DOUBT that these things exist as I havepersonally experienced them, so, I will patiently wait until science can explainthem in a manner that all humans can understand and accept.\"Keep up the fantastic work - Steve\"Return to Part 1June 5, 2007 Mission, Kansas, near Kansas City, Kansas - On Monday afternoon, May21, 2007, James Gravatt went out to mow his 24-inch-high field grass front yard. Thereason the grass was so high was he had not been home to mow it. His father, a retiredMarine who had served 25 years in a Marine Aircraft wing, had heart bypass surgery. For"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"weeks, James had been at the hospital and then helping his father recover. Meanwhile, thecity of Mission had issued James an order to mow his grass or face a stiff fine.James had worked for years as a paralegal and then graduated summa cum laude from alocal college with a B. A. in business administration. Today, he is a supervisor in a largeUPS hub in Kansas City, Kansas, where the Kansas River merges with the Missouri River.Mission is a suburb of Kansas City in Johnson County, about 8 miles south. The town wasnamed after the Shawnee Indian Mission, only two miles away from the neighborhood inwhich James Gravatt lives on the highest hill in the region.Shawnee Indians, along with many other eastern tribes, were moved from the East to theKansas region in the 1820s and 1830s. A little south of where Kansas City, Kansas, istoday, the Shawnee Indian Mission was first constructed in 1839 and functioned as aschool for children of mainly the Shawnee and Delaware Indian tribes. The Mission alsoserved as an early territorial capitol, a supply point on the Santa Fe and Oregon Trails anda camp for Union soldiers during the Civil War.Green circle marks modern day Mission, Kansas, a suburb south of Kansas City, Kansas.Mission is where the original Shawnee Indian Mission was built in 1839as a school for Shawnee and Delaware Indian tribe children.Thirteen stars in Shawnee Tribe flag.James Gravatt asked Chief Jim Oyler, Chief of the United Tribe of Shawnee Indians, abouthis Mission neighborhood where the two grass circles appeared. Chief Oyler said that \"thegeographical location on which I sit has been inhabited by the Shawnee, Kaw, Kiowa andpossibly Pawnee Indian tribes. The government has for the most part wiped out all recordsof burial grounds, and has not been helpful in relocating them. Most have been built onand covered up. There are a few cemeteries left in scattered areas. I asked if he wouldbelieve, with his knowledge of Native American history that my property might have beena burial ground. He said possibly, but more likely because of the elevation it was used as alookout post, camp sight and signaling location. Jim said some information regarding burialgrounds might be found in some of the various tribal treaties.\"There are several treaties with the Shawnee dating back to the 1700's that can be read onChief Oyler's website: http://home.kc.rr.com/utosi/Further west outside Salina, Kansas, there is an ancient Indian burial pit. The Kansas StateHistorical Society has an old text about the burial site which states:\"Several hundred years ago, perhaps more than a thousand, this valley wasinhabited by men whose average height was probably well over six feet. Thesewere not the Indians of Quivira, whose '7-foot-warriors' Coronado describedin 1541, but an even earlier people. Here they lived in earth lodges, tilling thesoil, hunting and fishing, and here they left records of unusual archaeological"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"importance.\"One mile southeast of this marker is a burial pit containing more than 140skeletal remains that demonstrate the remarkable size and strength of theseprehistoric Indians.

Among the objects found in the pit are pieces ofpottery, a grinding stone, parched corn and beans. A stone tomahawk,ceremonial flint knives, and clamshell beads and ear pendants.\"On May 21, 2007, James Gravatt sent me an email with an image attached of the twocircles he was surprised to find that afternoon. Both circles were swirled counterclockwise.The larger was eight feet in diameter and the smaller was 6.5 feet in diameter.\"Dear Linda,I have listened to you on Art Bell and Coast to Coast for many years,and appreciate your work.I live in a suburb of Kansas City near the Plaza. Today before mowingthe lawn, I was walking through it looking for pieces of branches. Istopped dead in my tracks when I saw these circles.(Facing tree and house) The one on the left measures 105 inches in diameter,and the one on the right is 72 inches. They are pinwheel shaped and both arecounter-clockwise. I have seen where deer lay before, but these circlesare too big. They are under a large old tree and I can't see how theyare weather-related circles.I'm stumped. Do you have any idea what could cause this? Feel freeto contact me by phone if you prefer.Best regards and Thank you.James GravattMission, KS(phone number)\"I talked with James Gravatt by phone about what happened and he agreed to collect grassand soil samples. I had them Fed Exed to biophysicist W. C. Levengood in Michigan forstudy. Not only were there biochemical and biophysical changes in the circle grasscompared to normal controls - especially the larger of the two circles - but he also foundan anomalously high distribution of very small magnetite particles in the larger circle.Interviews:James Gravatt, Supervisor, Kansas City UPS Hub, and Resident, Mission, Kansas:“On May 21, 2007, pretty close to 4 PM, I was beginning to mow my yard, which I hadnot done for some time because my Dad had heart bypass surgery in a local hospital and Ispent a lot of time basically either working or at the hospital and I had a mowing order, asembarrassing as it is to say. My grass had grown 2 feet or more tall in a residentialneighborhood. My home was built in about 1950. I went out to pick up small branchesunderneath the tree (Red Ash) – no big limbs had fallen – in order to mow under the tree.As I walked down the slope of my front yard, I stopped in my tracks. I saw two circles thathad been laid down in a vortex of a spiral shape going counter clockwise, both of them. Itliterally took my breath away for just a moment.I’ve been a hunter and spent a lot of times outdoors. An animal lying down was the firstthing that came to mind. But when I looked at the circles closer, I realized they were toolarge and were not stomped down. I’ve got a black Labrador retriever. She’s very skilled attracking rabbits and whatever might run across the lawn. If I see one run across the lawn,two hours later, I can let her go out and she will trace where that rabbit went. So, I broughtthis dog out and called her to the circles and she showed no interest in them at all. Shedidn’t really sniff the ground. I did look closely for any fecal matter, which is common if itwere a deer or something like that which laid down. And there was none. The grass andthe stems were not bent or broken and they were not brown or discolored. And there wereno indentations in the ground as if something had been set or laid on them.The second thought I had was perhaps from some utility construction truck that mighthave set utility cable spools in my yard. But I’ve seen that done, too, and I know if you setsomething heavy on grass, the grass lays flat and is damaged."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"These two circles are about 10 feet up from the curb of the street, which is a bit of a waysfor someone to just set cable spools up there anyway. Besides that, this is a neighborhoodwhere the city wouldn’t do that anyway because the neighbors would just scream.Big tree spreads over James Gravatt front yard where two circles were swirledcounterclockwise in tall, uncut grass and discovered on May 21, 2007.Image © 2007 by James Gravatt.Measuring CirclesMeasuring tape laid across diameter of larger native grass circle, 105 inches.Measurements and photograph © 2007 by James Gravatt.I did not step into the circles. But I got a tape measure and measured them. The smallercircle measured 72 inches (6 feet) in diameter and the larger was 105 inches (8.5 feet) indiameter.WHAT KIND OF GRASS?A native grass probably planted here in 1950 by the original owner or developer. It’salmost like field grass. It’s not Kentucky-blue-grass-type lawn. And none of the treebranches hang low to the ground, because I did think about the possibility of the branchesbeing down and the wind making the swirling. But physically, that's not possible becausethe branches don't reach the ground.DID YOU SEE ANY TRACKS LEADING FROM THE SIDEWALK OVER THE TENFEET OF GRASS TO THE CIRCLES?No, nothing.SO, FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW, THESE ARE TWO CIRCLES, 6 AND 8.5 FEETIN DIAMETER, THAT ARE SUDDENLY THERE ON MAY 21, 2007, AROUND 4 PMBENEATH YOUR TREE IN YOUR FRONT YARD AND WERE NOT THERE THEDAY BEFORE?No, they had not been there. You could not see them from a car on the street, but I gooutside and I would have seen these circles before May 21, if they had been there. I think"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"they occurred within the last 8 hours, or last 24 hours.SO, IF YOU STARTED MOWING AT 4 PM ON MAY 21, YOU THINK THE CIRCLESWERE MADE AROUND 9 AM OR EARLIER THAT DAY?It could have been at night. When I leave for work, I am generally out the door and intothe car and in a hurry and I might not have noticed them early that morning of May 21st. Tornadoes?WHAT WAS THE WEATHER LIKE THEN?Clear. Sunny.AND HAD BEEN THE DAY BEFORE ON MAY 20TH?Ye s .IS THERE ANYTHING IN YOUR LIFE THAT COMES TO MIND WHEN YOU LOOKAT THOSE TWO CIRCLES AND WONDER WHY THEY WERE PUT IN YOURFRONT YARD?(laughs) I live in Kansas and we have tornadoes. That came to mind. But the circles areunder a tree and I know tornadoes, dirt devils, whirlwinds and they move across flatground. But for something to form two perfect circles such as these that close together, no– I’ve seen a lot of things, but I’ve never seen anything like this. Shawnee Indian Mission NearbyI went out front and lined up the bigger circle to the smaller and stared right at KansasCity, Missouri. I then used Google Earth to pinpoint and draw a line from the direction ofmy street - which is the approximate direction of the circles, with a slight northerncorrection - to Kansas City. From my house to Kansas City, it is a straight line when thelarger circle is the base and the smaller circle is the point, like an arrow. Passing over thisline is the site of the Shawnee Indian Mission, from which Mission, Kansas, got it's name.The Shawnee Mission used to cover many acres. Biophysicists W. C. Levengood'sGrass and Soil AnalysesW. C. Levengood, Biophysicist, Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory, Grass Lake,Michigan: “These two grass circles are a different formation. I’ve never had one exactlylike this. It shows an energy causing damage to the plants in which the internal energy (ofCharge Density Plasmas, CDP) is just dropping like crazy.[ W. C. Levengood's definition: \"Charge Density Plasmas, CDP, aremicroscopic plasmas. A plasma is a liquid or a gas that is highly ionized andorganizes itself into a very specific system with a very special kind of energy.I use a system where by I can look at a fresh specific-sized sample of planttissue, so I can measure the internal energy generated by the plant.\"]What I did was compare the internal energy in the control grass with the internal energiesof all the sampled grass James Gravatt collected from the small and larger circles. Thesmall circle was + 9% greater than the controls. That’s not statistically significant.But in the large circle, the CDP was 73% lower than in the controls. I haven’t seen thisbefore. In contrast, the normal controls grasses were exactly what I would expect in myCDP test.Then when I did a dissipation analysis of respiration in the cell mitochondria, the smallcircle was 45% lower in the rate constant than the controls. In the larger circle, it was 76%smaller. Not at all like the normal control grass!Further, when I applied a logarithmic algorithm that fits normal plants, I found the mean inthe control grass samples was .99. Controls always fit right on at .99, which is practically aperfect correlation, so the controls to the two grass circles were very normal. Incomparison to the circle correlation coefficients, the small circle was .90. And in the large"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"circle, it was .57, very little correlation at all.Something has really knocked the heck out of the energy in the larger circle – andsomewhat in the smaller circle.WHY DO YOU THINK THE LARGER CIRCLE WOULD BE KNOCKED DOWN INENERGY SO MUCH? Microwaves in Complex SpinningPlasma VorticesIt’s turbulence within the energy vortices and in this case, I would say it is microwaveenergies that are the culprit. (Biophysicist Levengood's hypothesis is that spinning plasmavortices come down from high in the atmosphere with microwave energies and positivelyand negatively charged ions. The spinning complex energies interact with plants to formcrop formations.) This follows what I’ve seen before in crop formations, but here the twocircles are in grass. Magnetite Particles in Larger Grass Circle SoilI had unexpected results with the soil. I did the magnetic drags and there was somemagnetite there. The results tied right in with what I saw in the energy of the circle plants.The amount of magnetic drag material in the soil was very small - I think it’s one of thesmallest I’ve seen so far. But there turned out to be significant differences.The controls had 0.2 milligrams per gram of soil, which is a little below the expected levelin normal soil – .4 milligrams per gram. So, the Mission, Kansas, controls are about in thatrange.The small circle samples averaged together had 0.212, which was not significant. But thelarge circle had 0.764.THAT WOULD BE THREE TIMES WHAT YOU FOUND IN THE CONTROL SOIL?Yes, a little over. Then I did a microscopic examination and the particles were exactlywhat I expected, the bright, shiny particles. But the size was tremendously small! In otherwords, these showed up as little scintillations on the surface of the soil particles when Iused reflected light. They were very profuse, but extremely small. The upper size limit onany particle I found was 21 microns (human blood cell is 7 microns in diameter). I wouldsay the vast majority was in the range of 1 to 5 microns and some in 12 microns.SO THIS WAS LIKE THE PARTICL ES W ERE SP RAY PAINTE D ON THE LARGERCIRCLE?Something like that, yeah. That’s a good analogy. But it’s electrostatic, not melted. Thesmaller particle distribution might be related to the less intense energies involved in makingthe two grass circles. The grass was not knocked down flat. It was gently swirled.Again, I think the energy involved in the \"spray\" of very small magnetite particles in thelarger circle is microwave energy, which also impacted most on the larger circle grass. Fundamental Biophysical and BiochemicalChanges in Mission, Kansas, Grass CirclesIn the Mission, Kansas, grass circles we are seeing vortex action that has a pretty potentmicrowave component that lowered the energy in the grass of the larger circle. So this isnot like the typical crop formations where you see the highest energy often affecting theplants in the smallest circles, what the British call 'grape shots.' It’s just the opposite here.The small circle had very little energy and very little magnetic material.WHY DO YOU THINK THAT OCCURRED IN THE MISSION CIRCLES?I don’t know why the smaller of the two circles would be so unaffected, while the largercircle’s grass respiration was so depleted. But I think the mechanism was entirely differentthan the ones we have found in English grape shot. There the energy has been far more"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"controlled and partitioned. Here in Mission, Kansas, there were just a couple of vorticesthat gently swirled the grass down. I’m eager to see what the re-growth looks like in thisgrass. The larger circle area could begin to show up a different color in the grass andeventually might even go brown.\"Continued in Part 3 - Wheat Pictogram in Madisonville, TennesseeReturn to Part 1 - U.
