If the spiral(gaps) were filled in, there would be 87 circles.\"If the spiral is counted both inward and outward then 87 + 87 = 174 and k’in174 in the Mayan calendar is '5 Ix.'5 Ix Mayan calendar glyph.On day '4 Ix,' according to the Mayan Chilam Balam book, the 'sky and earthtilted' when our present age began. Thus, this crop circle’s '5 Ix' number 174would relate to the birth of the next age called the Fifth World by the Hopi orthe Sixth Sun by the Aztec.\"The '5 Ix' is another portal on Pakal's tomb lid (see images below) atPalenque, which is related to the portal images I emailed you concerning theother '9 circles' in Madisonville, Tennessee, crop circle. That 'completionportal' is positioned on the tomb lid as day 134 - '4 Ix' on which the ChilamBalam book states the 'sky and earth tilted.' The portal glyph for Pakal tomblid at Palenque this symbol relates to the beginning and end of our cycle.

In the 1490s, the prophesy said, the two pathswould converge and the eagle would drive the condor to theverge of extinction. Then, five hundred years later, in the 1990's,a new epoch would begin, one in which the condor and the eaglewill have the opportunity to reunite and fly together in the samesky, along the same path. If the condor and eagle accept thisopportunity, they will create a most remarkable offspring, unlikeany seen before.“The Prophecy of the Condor and Eagle' can be taken at manylevels — the standard interpretation is that it foretells the sharingof indigenous knowledge with the technologies of science, thebalancing of yin and yang, and the bridging of northern andsouthern cultures. However, most powerful is the message itoffers about consciousness; it says the we have entered a timewhen we can benefit from the many diverse was of seeingourselves and the world, and that we can use these as aspringboard to higher levels of awareness.
