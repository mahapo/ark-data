People on the ground began seeing the clouds on June 6,2007, over Northern Europe. AIM is the first satellite mission dedicated to thestudy of these unusual clouds.These mystifying clouds are called Polar Mesospheric Clouds, or PMCs, whenthey are viewed from space and referred to as 'night-shining' clouds orNoctilucent Clouds, when viewed by observers on Earth. The clouds form inan upper layer of the Earth’s atmosphere called the mesosphere during theNorthern Hemisphere’s summer season which began in mid-May and extendsthrough the end of August. The mysterious night shining clouds are being seenby AIM’s instruments more frequently as the season progresses. They are alsoseen in the high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere during the summermonths.Very little is known about how these clouds form over the poles, why they arebeing seen more frequently and at lower latitudes than ever before, or whythey have been growing brighter. AIM will observe two complete cloudseasons over both poles, documenting an entire life cycle of the shiny cloudsfor the first time.'It is clear that these clouds are changing, a sign that a part of our atmosphereis changing and we do not understand how, why or what it means,' stated AIMprincipal investigator James Russell III of Hampton University, Hampton, Va.'These observations suggest a connection with global change in the loweratmosphere and could represent an early warning that our Earth environmentis being changed.'\" Are Increasing Noctilucent CloudsA Consequence of Global Warming?\"AIM is providing scientists with information about how many of these cloudsthere are around the world and how different they are including the sizes andshapes of the tiny particles that make them up. Scientists believe that theshining clouds form at high latitudes early in the season and then move tolower latitudes as time progresses. The AIM science team is studying this newdata to understand why these clouds form and vary, and if they may berelated to global change.Once the summer season ends in the Northern Hemisphere around mid- to lateAugust, the Southern Hemisphere spring season starts about three monthslater in the period around mid- to late November. AIM will then be watchingfor shining clouds in the Southern Hemisphere from November throughmid-March when that season ends. \"NASA's AIM satellite is managed at Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland,and the AIM Project Data Center is located at Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia.For further information about global warming and Earth's environmental changes, pleasesee the news reports below in the Earthfiles Archive:• 06/28/2007 — Hackenberg Apiary, Pennsylvania - 75-80% Honey Bee Loss in 2007.
