It’s how do we get the (greenhouse) emissions undercontrol so we don’t push past all the possible points at which theclimate change becomes a seriously dangerous issue.”- Chris Field, Ph.D., Director, Carnegie Institution'sDept. of Global Ecology, Stanford University, Palo Alto, Calif. Almost 98% of the Antarctica South Pole continent is covered by ice,which averages a mile thick. Antarctica lost much more ice to the sea than it gained from snowfall, accordingto a NASA survey done between 1992 and 2002. It also had a corresponding rise in sea level.The survey documented for the first time extensive thinning of the West Antarctic ice shelves.Credit: NASA/SVSSatellite image courtesy NASA. June 1, 2007 New York, New York - The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel onClimate Change reported this year that there is at least a 90% certainty that globalwarming is man-made and will “continue for centuries.” The IPCC also reports that incoming decades, rising temperatures and rising sea levels will cause floods and massfamine. The implication is that there will be massive dislocations of humans and animalsthat have traditionally lived near coastlines. Despite the hard data, the George BushAdministration has resisted setting CO2 reduction goals, claiming there would be too manyeconomic hardships for Americans. Ironically, it is the United States, which dominates theworld list of greatest CO2 emitters.One scientist who has been frustrated by the Bush Administration’s attitude about globalwarming is James Hansen, Ph.D. and Director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for SpaceStudies (GISS) in New York. Dr. Hansen has publicly criticized the Bush Administrationfor politicizing scientists and scientific data, suppressing data that contradict presidentialbiases."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"James Hansen, Director, NASA's Goddard Institutefor Space Studies (GISS), New York City, New York.Then in the last week of May, a few quotes began to circulate on the Internet from a majorglobal warming study scheduled for publication in the June 1, 2007, journal ofAtmospheric Chemistry and Physics. Forty-eight American and French climate scientists -lead by NASA’s James Hansen - warn about global warming tipping points. “Tippingpoints can occur during climate change when the climate reaches a state such that strongamplifying feedbacks are activated by only moderate additional warming. ...strongamplifying feedbacks are pushing Earth past dangerous tipping points.” An example of“amplifying feedback” is that as the Arctic warms and ice melts, forests are expanding,replacing the white ice with dark, heat-absorbing tundra that will contribute even moreCO2 back to the atmosphere. “The tipping point toward disastrous effects of globalwarming” could be much closer than most people realize.The NASA/GISS study concludes that if Earth nations don’t seriously curtail greenhouseemissions over the next ten years, Earth will be pushed past “critical tipping points withdangerous consequences for the planet.” As if anticipating the NASA report, on Thursday, May 31st, President Bush asked China,India and a dozen European countries to agree by the end of 2008 on a global emissionsgoal for reducing greenhouse gases. But the White House press explanation for the timingof the announcement is the upcoming G-8 summit in Germany in which global warmingand its consequences will be major topics.Germany is proposing that all nations agree to slow down global warming this century tono more than 2 degrees Celsius -- about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Experts say in order to dothat, current greenhouse gas emissions coming out of cars and industries would have to becut back 50 percent below 1990 levels over the next forty years. But the BushAdministration has rejected that idea.Contradicting Dr. Hansen and towing the Bush Administration’s political line, NASAAdministrator Michael Griffin told National Public Radio this week he did not know ifglobal warming was a serious problem and said: \"To assume that global warming is aproblem is to assume that the state of Earth's climate today is the optimal climate, the bestclimate that we could have or have had and that we need to take steps to make sure it doesnot change.\" June 1, 2007Journal of Atmospheric Chemistry and PhysicsBut not towing the Administration’s political line are the 48 American and Frenchscientists who compiled the study published June 1st in the journal, AtmosphericChemistry and Physics.Quoting from the GISS website: A computer model developed by theGoddard Institute was used to simulate climate from 1880 through today. Themodel included a more comprehensive set of natural and human-made climateforcings than previous studies, including changes in solar radiation, volcanicparticles, human-made greenhouse gases, fine particles such as soot, the effectof the particles on clouds and land use. Extensive evaluation of the model'sability to simulate climate change is contained in a companion paper to bepublished in Climate Dynamics.The authors use the model for climate simulations of the 21st century usingboth \"business-as-usual\" growth of greenhouse gas emissions and an\"alternative scenario\" in which emissions decrease slowly in the next fewdecades and then rapidly to achieve stabilization of atmospheric CO2 amountby the end of the century. Climate changes are so large with \"business-as-usual\", with additional global warming of 2-3°C (3.6-5.4°F) that Hansenconcludes \"'business-as-usual' would be a guarantee of global and regionaldisasters.\"However, the study finds much less severe climate change — one-quarter toone-third that of the \"business-as-usual\" scenario — when greenhouse gasemissions follow the alternative scenario. \"Climate effects may still besubstantial in the 'alternative scenario', but there is a better chance to adapt tothe changes and find other ways to further reduce the climate change,\" saidSa to.While the researchers say it is still possible to achieve the \"alternative"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"scenario\", they note that significant actions will be required to do so.Emissions must begin to slow soon. \"With another decade of 'business-as-usual' it becomes impractical to achieve the 'alternative scenario' becauseof the energy infrastructure that would be in place,\" says Hansen.This week I asked Chris Field, Ph.D. and Director of the Carnegie Institution’s Departmentof Global Ecology and Prof. of Biological Sciences at Stanford University, about the“tipping point” danger as greenhouse gases increase more rapidly and glaciers and polarice melt faster.Interview:Chris Field, Ph.D., Director, Carnegie Institution’s Department of Global Ecologyand Prof. of Biological Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, California: “There isan increasing body of experimental evidence that says those crude models weren’t veryaccurate and what is happening is that the ice sheets are melting much more rapidly thanour characterizations of them.What that means is that there are two risks to climate: one is that loss of ice tends to makethe underlying surface darker, which absorbs more radiation. That means the positivefeedback from warming gets to be greater.The other risk is that the land ice sheets when they melt tend to raise sea level. Theamount of sea level equivalent, for example, that is stored in the Greenland ice sheet isbetween 5 and 10 meters or about 15 to 35 feet of sea level equivalent rise – really asubstantial amount of water. Is 450 ppmv CO2 in Earth'sAtmosphere A Tipping Point?YES, AND DR. HANSEN TOLD ABC NEWS (MAY 29, 2007) THAT “CO2EXCEEDING 450 PPMVV IN OUR ATMOSPHERE IS ALMOST SURELYDANGEROUS AND THE UPPER LIMIT FOR AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATECONSEQUENCES COULD BE MUCH LOWER THAN 450 PPMV OF CO2.”THAT WAS STATED IN THE CONTEXT THAT WE ARE AT 383 PPMV CO2 IN THEATMOSPHERE RIGHT NOW, LEAVING LESS THAN 100 PPMV TO INCREASETHROUGH THE NEXT 90 YEARS TO THE END OF THIS CENTURY.WOULD YOU AGREE THAT WHERE WE ARE HEADED IN TERMS OF CO2LEVELS COULD BE WHAT TIPS THIS PLANET INTO MORE RAPID CLIMATECHANGE, MORE RAPID THAN IT IS NOW?Well, I think it has been clear from a wide range of scientific evidence over the pastseveral years that the risk of anthropogenic human influence on climate is very real andvery grave.From my own research and reading of the data, it is not 100% clear whether the dangerousanthropogenic influence occurs at 450 ppmv or 500 ppmv or 550 ppmv, but we’redefinitely headed in a direction where there is a grave risk of dangerous changes to theclimate.My personal concern is that anthropogenic emission of the heat-trapping gases isincreasing so rapidly that we might shoot well past 450 ppmv, we might shoot well past550 ppmv by the later decades of this century. So, it’s not really so much of a questionwhether the dangerous tipping point occurs at 450 or 550. It’s how do we get the emissionsunder control so we don’t push past all the possible points at which the climate changebecomes a seriously dangerous issue. National Academy of Science Report:Earth's Atmosphere Could Reach700 to 1000 ppmv CO2 by 2100\"Based on a recent study completed by the Global Carbon Projectand published last week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS),it looks possible that in the absence of controls on emissions, we could be seeing CO2"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"concentrations at the end of this 21st Century that are well above 700 ppmvand possibly, even above 1,000 ppmv.\"DR. HANSEN ALSO MAKES THE POINT THAT HE THINKS THERE IS A DECADEOR LESS IN WHICH THE INDUSTRIES OF THE WORLD AND ALL THE NATIONSCOULD PULL BACK ON CO2 EMISSIONS AND MAYBE HAVE SOME CALMINGEFFECT ON WHAT COULD BE MORE RAPID CLIMATE CHANGE THAN WEEVER EXPECTED. WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THERE IS ONLY A DECADE ORLESS LEFT FOR THE PLANET TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT IT IS GOING TOTRY TO PULL BACK ON CO2 EMISSIONS?It’s hard to know. I think the window of opportunity is really quite brief and I think it isquite brief for a couple of reasons. Probably the most important one is that there is a verystrong relationship between economic growth and energy use and between energy use andgreenhouse gas emissions.What we need to do is break that link between energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.That takes a combination of conservation efficiency and new technologies and carboncapture and storage. Basically what it takes is new technologies, new incentives and newways to make using all those strategies compelling to all of the countries of the world thathave a legitimate desire for economic development. I think the developed countries of theworld – the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia – need to take a lead in making thesetechnologies attractive for developing on an industrial scale and then making themavailable to the whole world.That’s a multi-step project and unless we get serious about it in the short run, there is notgoing to be time for the steps required to get it distributed worldwide. And I hope we havenot passed an unacceptable tipping point, but I don’t think anyone knows if we have theopportunity to solve the problem without dangerous changes to the climate system.Based on a recent study completed by the Global Carbon Project and published last weekin the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), it looks possible that inthe absence of controls on emissions, we could be seeing CO2 concentrations at the end ofthis 21st Century that are well above 700 ppmv and possibly, even above 1,000 ppmv.IF THAT OCCURRED, WOULD WE ESSENTIALLY BE GUARANTEED ATLOOKING AT WEST ANTARCTIC ICE MELT CONTRIBUTING TO EVEN MORERAPID SEA LEVEL RISE THAN THE CURRENT COMPUTER PROJECTIONS?We would be looking at substantial warming during this century. The IPCC range of globalaverage temperature by 2100 is somewhere between 1.5 degrees Centigrade to 6 degreesCentigrade warming. That’s between 3 degrees Fahrenheit and 11 degrees Fahrenheit ofaverage mean warming, with even more warming at the poles.If we’re at the high end of the CO2 emissions, we’ll tend to be at the high end of thewarming as well and a climate change scenario in which we are looking at more than 10degrees F. of warming is just a dramatically different world to the world today.The way to put that into perspective is that the average mean temperature differencebetween Los Angeles and Death Valley is about 10 degrees F. And we’re talking aboutthat level as a worldwide average and even larger differences than that in the Arctic.It also means that commitments to long-term sea level rise are greater, commitment to thechanges in precipitation and storm tracks that accompany the changes in temperaturebecome greater. How to Get Industrial Nations toCut Back CO2 Emissions?IF CHINA AND INDIA DON’T JOIN IN THIS EFFORT – WHICH HOPEFULLY THEUNITED STATES AND ENGLAND AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL NATIONS WILLBEGIN LEADING A QUEST FOR CO2 CUTBACKS AND SHIFTS TO OTHER THANFOSSIL FUEL ENERGIES. ASSUMING, THOUGH, THAT MIGHT NOT HAPPEN –THAT CHINA AND INDIA, TWO BIG CO2 CONTRIBUTORS – BACK AWAY ANDSAY THEY WANT THEIR TIME FOR INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT THE WAY WEHAD IT – AND THAT INCREASES THE CO2 INCREASE EVEN MORE RAPIDLYTHAN THE IPCC HAS BASED THE COMPUTER MODELS ON – WHAT DO YOUTHINK THE WORST CASE IS FOR THE REST OF THIS CENTURY?I think that the alternative to continued growth and emissions from India and China is thatthe technologies for high growth and energy without high growth and emissions become"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the compelling choice for them. I think that’s where the leadership is required fromcountries like the United States and Europe. That’s also where the opportunity is. Youknow, it’s like sitting in 1900 and asking, ‘What are going to be the big businesses of the20th Century?’ I don’t think there were very many people saying that petroleum was goingto be the big business of the 20th Century.And now in the early years of the 21st Century, I think we’re looking at an unknown set ofthe big businesses. But they are likely to be businesses that can provide copious amountsof energy at low cost without carbon emissions. How to Cope with Increasing Storm Strength?WE’RE ALREADY HEARING FROM A VARIETY OF SCIENTISTS STUDYING THISTHAT MORE AND MORE HURRICANES WILL BE MORE LIKE KATRINA, THATTHERE WILL BE MORE AND MORE TORNADO EVENTS LIKE WHAT JUST TOOKOUT GREENSBURG, KANSAS.WITH INCREASING STORMS AND SEA LEVEL RISE AND DEEPER SURGES OFTHE OCEANS INLAND AS WATER DOES RISE INCREMENTALLY, AREN’T WETALKING ABOUT THE COASTS OF THE ENTIRE PLANET BECOMINGBASICALLY UNLIVABLE DECADE BY DECADE BY DECADE?The issue of sea level rise is a serious one and has two really important components. Thefirst is that even a modest amount of sea level rise can lead to rapidly increasing damagesbecause when you add a small amount of sea level rise – 6 inches or a foot on top of everystorm surge and on top of every spring flood – the damages increase really rapidly.The estimates, for example, in the Sacramento delta in California are that a one foot sealevel rise would convert what currently is a flood that’s so serious it occurs every 100years into one that would occur every five to ten years.The other thing that’s really important about sea level rise is that we have continueddevelopment of more and more infrastructure along the Pacific coast. As we put more andmore infrastructure close to the coasts, and we subject it to more and more pounding bythe rising seas, the losses of property go up much more rapidly.And finally, as you say, it’s important to note that the scientific evidence for increase inthe intensity of the largest hurricanes is really pretty clear now so that even though thenumber of hurricanes might not increase in a warmer climate, the frequency with whichthey get to be mega storms is likely to increase. \"Eco-Refugees\" As Sea Levels Rise -Relocate to Where?WHERE ARE ALL THE PEOPLE GOING TO GO, WHETHER IT’S BANGLADESHOR COASTAL AREAS IN AFRICA OR THE UNITED STATES? WHERE ISEVERYBODY GOING TO RELOCATE TO?(sighs/laughs) I really don’t think we know the answer to that question. It is one of themost severe challenges we face.One of the recent conclusions of the IPCC study on impacts and vulnerability, however, isthat there are vulnerable people in almost every region – especially the elderly, the poorand children. And there are vulnerable regions in almost every country and certainly theexperience of the United States with Hurricane Katrina demonstrated that even with all thetechnical and economic resources that we have, we could not protect the vulnerable partsof our population. What Happens if West AntarcticIce Continues to Melt?LOOKING AGAIN AT THE UPCOMING CONTENT FROM JAMES HANSEN ANDNASA’S RELEASE ON JUNE 1, THE STUDY SAYS, “ONLY MODERATEADDITIONAL CLIMATE FORCING – WHICH WOULD MEAN ONLY MODERATEADDITIONAL WARMING FROM SUCH (CO2) EMISSIONS – IS LIKELY TO SET INMOTION THE DISINTEGRATION OF THE WEST ANTARCTIC ICE SHEET. MANYSCIENTISTS SAY THAT A DISINTEGRATION OF THE WEST ANTARCTIC ICE"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"SHEET WOULD MEAN CATASTROPHICLY RAPID SEA LEVEL RISE.” COULDYOU COMMENT ON THAT?The physics of melting these continental ice sheets is a very difficult problem. There’s a lotof recent experimental evidence that says the estimates that have been built into theclimate models were probably too conservative, but we still don’t have a precise estimateof too conservative by how much? If the sea level rise from either melting of theGreenland or West Antarctic ice sheet is accelerated, we’re looking at a commitment to somuch sea level rise that many of the world’s major coastal cities would have to berelocated or dramatically reinforced within a time period that is certainly much less thanthe time period over which these cities have persisted in history.WHATEVER THE SEA LEVEL RISE IS WE’RE TALKING ABOUT ONLY NINEDECADES THAT IT COULD BE ANOTHER TWO OR THREE FEET HIGHER,CORRECT?The ranges of sea level rise in the most recent IPCC report are up to 2 or a little more than2 feet. Now, those are maybe conservative based on the new information that’s available.But it’s unlikely we’ll see more than 10 feet of sea level rise during this century.One to two to three feet of sea level rise during this century would impose very majorhardships on cities, infrastructure around the world and especially on people in the world’spoorest nations.WHAT WOULD PHILADELPHIA AND NEW YORK DO? THEY ARE ONLY ABOUT25 FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL. IN OTHER WORDS, IF WE GO UP TWO TO THREEFEET OR MORE OVER THIS CENTURY, THEN THE SURGE FROM STORMS ISGOING TO BE THAT MUCH MORE WATER RIGHT INTO THE CITY STREETS,CORRECT?In places like New York and Philadelphia where there are currently water damage, it’sduring storm events. What happens with sea level rise is that it takes less of a storm eventto create a severe problem. Of course, at the same time, if we are getting more severestorm events, we put ourselves into a double bind. It might be by the later decades of thiscentury, we’re looking at the need for really massive investments in protecting assets incities like New York or Philadelphia, much as London has done recently. London has amassive engineering project to prevent high tides from coming up the Thames River.The Italian government is talking about a massive engineering budget to protect Venice. Inthe cities that have lots of economic capital, I think that’s what we will be seeing. And theworld cities that don’t have access to money, I think we’re going to see large-scaleabandonment of the areas that are cities now.HOW IS LONDON TRYING TO PRESERVE ITSELF?Oh, it’s an amazing engineering project. It’s called the Thames River Barrier. Basically it’sa series of massive steel structures that can rise up out of the bottom of the river and blockhigh tides from coming up the Thames River and flooding London.The important way to think about these coastal events is that when you try and defend acity like London, for example, the Thames River Barrier was built with the expectationthat it might be used once every ten years or maybe once a year. But now it’s at the pointwhere they are already using it several times per year. And as sea level continues to rise,the barrier will need to be used more and more frequently, and there might be eventswhere even that is not successful.IF INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL NO LONGER INSURE HOMES ANDSTRUCTURES NEAR THE SHORES, DOESN’T THAT MEAN THERE IS GOING TOBE AN EXIT AWAY FROM THE COASTLINES BECAUSE INSURANCE WON’TBACK PEOPLE UP TO CONSTRUCT THERE?Certainly insurance is a critical part in communities that people make about where to buildand what to build. I think the fact that it’s becoming more and more difficult to provideinsurance for various kinds of coastal structures indicates that the insurance companies –and especially the reinsurance companies – are aware of the risks that they face withongoing development in the coastal areas. I think we should view the insurance companies’reluctance as a clarion for the kinds of problems we’re likely to experience unless we getthis problem under control. If Greenhouse Gases Are Not Slowed?\"If we don’t (control greenhouse emissions), the risk of unacceptable"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"damaging changes from climate change are unacceptably grave.\"DO YOU AGREE WITH JAMES HANSEN THAT WE COULD BE CLOSER TO AREALLY RADICAL TIPPING POINT THAN ANYBODY REALIZES?I think there are many lines of evidence that we have a relatively brief window ofopportunity to take the steps to getting the emissions of these heat-trapping gases undercontrol.IF WE DON’T?If we don’t (control greenhouse emissions), the risk of unacceptable damaging changesfrom climate change are unacceptably grave.AND WOULD COME UPON US SOONER THAN ANYONE REALIZES?I think it’s clear that the potential risks of climate change in the next several decadesduring this century are at the level where the risks are unacceptable with large amounts ofclimate change. It’s very hard to know whether we’ve crossed a threshold this year or nextyear or in five years, but I think what you need to be clear on is the momentum and inertiain the world’s economic and technological systems and it is that inertia that we need to beworking on. We need to be turning the corner making this huge ocean-going tanker that’sthe world’s energy system start to turn. If we don’t even start to think about making it startto turn for another ten or twenty years, there’s no hope we’re going to get it to turn soonenough.”More Information:For further information about global warming, please see reports below in the EarthfilesArchive:• 05/18/2007 — Antarctica: Unprecedented Western Ice Melt and CO2-Saturated Southern Ocean• 02/23/2007 — Scientists Hope \"Amphibian Arks\" Can Save Frogs and Toads• 02/23/2007 — Part 1: Earth Life Threats - Alarming Disappearance of Honey Bees• 02/23/2007 — Part 2: Earth Life Threats - \"Noah's Ark\" for World's Seeds• 02/02/2007 — Updated: New U.
