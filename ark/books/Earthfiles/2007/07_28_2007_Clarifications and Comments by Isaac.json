Typicallythe claim runs along the lines of 'couldn't do that back then.' Ifind it interesting that some people claim such authority whenclearly they do not really know.The fact is this: The Xerox 860 was in wide use in the early tomid-80's as was the top-of-the-line dedicated Word Processor. Itwasn't a PC or a general purpose computer though; all it did wasWYSWIYG word pro (in fact pre-dating the WYSIWYG featureof the Mac which came a couple of years leater). By today'sstandards it was huge, very expensive and was somewhatcomplicated to use. I was in the publishing business at the timeand we sold newsletters to the accounting and legal profession."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"They were produced on the Xerox 860 by our dedicated '860Operator' and resulted in very high quality documents that lookedtypeset. The layout could be 100% controlled includingjustification, although the fonts were mechical font wheels thathad to be swapped in and out. The printers were huge and veryhigh-end in quality. (As a note: photocopiers were very high-endeven then, although in the mid 80's were still electrostatic/tonerbased).Given that CARET was 'next door' to XPARC I see nothingunusual in the quality or layout of the documents and anyskepticism raised on that account should be declared completelyinvalid. Here is a link to a reference page re the X860:\"http://www.digibarn.com/collections/systems/xerox860/index.htmlJuly 27, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - After the Isaac letter and CARET documentwere released on June 26, 2007, one of the criticisms was expressed this way:\"Looking at the so-called 'documentation' that goes with this stuff, thetext-formatting is obviously done with relatively recent vintage page-layoutsoftware. You can tell by the perfect nature of the block justification.\"That type of extremely precise (even in word-spacing), indeed perfect,text-formatting DID NOT EXIST IN 1985, particularly in a laboratory or evencorporate environment. After looking at all of the fancy 'documents,' includingthe Macromedia Freehand or Adobe Illustrator-designed 'alien diagrams,' Istate now and for the RECORD that this whole thing is a HOAX, and will beproven to be such.\"Another critic wondered why the extraterrestrial diagrams were formatted for 8.5 x11-sized paper? Other repeated criticism was that if Isaac really wanted the public to seesome of the research facts behind the aerial \"drones,\" why did he blacken some of theCARET document text?One of many critics emailed these comments, which Isaac addressed in 2nd reply below:\"This is a big hoax. For one thing, the US Government wouldNEVER allow this information to left in the hands of someworker. Another thing, the manual does not look anything like alegal NASA or a government document either. The pictures of the'artifact' are photoshopped and I can tell you that the aliens DOnot label every single part as pictured. The anti-grav unit picturedis fake. The photos of the drone on the floor are model parts. Theconfiguration of all the drones sent in to you and others issomething the aliens would never design as all these designspictured show gross misuse of space. All their ships are based onthe use of space. Not one inch to them is wasted and if you lookat the history of 'probes' from EBE's they are SMALL and fast. Ithink you have been had. I am surprised that you and GeorgeNoory etc. are easily tricked by this. I would definitely checkwith your reliable contacts deep in the 'Know' and find out foryourself.\"I emailed these issues to Isaac and on June 27, 2007, I received his replies in two separateemails indicated by receipt times, which Isaac gave me permission to share in an Earthfilesfollow-up. My delay in reporting these emails is that I had an indication from Isaac that Imight be able to interview him by phone. So, I waited, hoping the interview would occur.But to date, that has not happened.From: IsaacSubject: Re: \"Drones\"Date: June 27, 2007 Received 1:34 PM, Albuquerque, New MexicoTo: earthfiles@earthfiles.comIsaac: \"There are a few misconceptions that I have noticed so far and wouldlike to clear them up, and will also answer your questions:1) I realize now that I did not make this clear, but I should clarify that I amnot responsible for the blacking out of the Q4-86 report. Most of the copies Iwas able to make came from documents that were already archived, whichmeant that they had already been censored for use by outside parties thatneeded access to some, but not all, of CARET's information. I'm trying to"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"share this information, not hide it, but if I did feel that if a given topic was toosensitive for some reason, I would make it clear that I had personally coveredit up and probably try to give a reason why.2) I do not understand the question about why the diagram would be\"formatted for 8.5 x 11\"... As I mention in my letter, the diagram is areproduction, not the original. We had a team of technical artists painstakinglycopy the diagram from its original source, which was a slightly curved panelnot unlike the one seen in the Big Basin craft, although this one wasapparently inside the craft, not on the outside. We copied it into a draftingprogram over the course of about a month.Our software was understandably primitive by today's standards, but it wasstill orders of magnitude more powerful than a pencil and paper would havebeen. This made a task that would have otherwise been nearly impossiblerelatively feasible, albeit extremely time-consuming. I can assure you, \"they\"did not make anything particularly convenient for us. One of the reasons wechose to reproduce that particular diagram was because out of all the diagram-artifacts we had access to, it was on the flattest surface.Since the geometry of the forms is extremely important, curvature of thesurface it's printed on must be \"corrected\" if it is to be reproduced in a surfacewith a different contour (such as a flat page). This can be done in a number ofways, by either using a mathematical model to reverse the effect of thesurface curves on the diagram's shapes, or by methods of physical measuringthat allow precise measuring of irregular surfaces. In either case, however, itadds a significant new dimension of labor to an already extremely labor-intensive task, so it's avoided whenever possible. We really just needed one ortwo accurately copied diagrams to serve as convenient examples for our ownwork in decoding and reproducing it, so luckily this was not something we hadto do often. Some experimentation was being done on ways to \"scan\" thediagrams as well, using an almost completely automated process that couldautomatically account for curved surfaces, but during my time there, verylittle progress was made on this front.3) I think the confusion over the quality of the documents stems from the factthat he (critic) is under the impression they (CARET document) were typeset.They were not. First of all, I'm no guru when it comes to graphics or design,but being in close contact with numerous people from places like XPARC willgive you enough background to know the lay of the land. What's firstimportant to note is that systems capable of desktop publishing had been indevelopment for many years before CARET, mostly starting with the XeroxAlto (in 1973), which XPARC developed themselves.In fact, I once remember hearing from someone related to the original Altoteam that Boeing (I believe) used the Alto to lay out and print thedocumentation for one of their planes (or something to that effect, I heard thestory years ago). The joke was apparently that there was so MUCHdocumentation that the plane itself could essentially be filled with the pages.Furthermore, laser printing itself had also been around for many years (albeitin an extremely expensive form), and was also developed within XPARC(more or less). Other systems, such as PERQ and Lilith, also came out aroundthe late 70's and while none of them turned into major commercial products,they were not uncommon among large companies and [mostly] universitiesand were put to very productive use.These systems were also the inspiration for the Apple Lisa and Macintosh,which was of course perhaps the biggest factor in the consumer-level desktoppublishing boom of the late 80's and early 90's. By 1984, there were quite afew options available for producing these kinds of documents, they were justABSURDLY expensive, so they weren't on every street corner. Obviously itwas nowhere near as turnkey and simple as it is today, but it was a very crudeapproximation of the same process with similar tools. We just had far lessfeatures and everything was a hell of a lot slower. But the point I'm trying tomake is that while our method of documentation was somewhat advanced forits time, and also somewhat uncommon, it was hardly unattainable by asufficiently motivated, financed, and well-connected organization.I had very little contact with the technical writers for the most part, but I doknow that we were using this kind of technology for both page layout andprinting. CARET was expected to produce a massive amount of detailed,well-formatted documentation that could be easily modified and re-used fornumerous drafts and revisions, and we would not have been able to keep up"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"using traditional page layout and typesetting techniques. The mid-1980's werea very transitional period for these fields, and I would suggest that people donot assume we were using run-of-the-mill standards.One of the things I appreciated most about CARET was that if the technologywas available, and we needed it to work better or more effectively, it wasgiven to us with little debate. But typesetting and digital page layout areapples and oranges, so I think most of this is a moot point anyway.The bottom line is that many people both inside and outside the engineeringworld frequently underestimate how long we've had a lot of the technology wehave. 99% of the algorithms we use today were developed decades ago, theyjust didn't have the same practical applications immediately available. Most ofthe engineers of the 60's and 70's would have been right at home with today'sdevelopments and technologies. The only difference is that things have gottensmaller and faster. In the vast majority of technologies, that is the only thingthat REALLY changes from one era to the next. If I told the average personthat we had speech-synthesizing technology in 1936, they probably wouldn'tbelieve me.I could show you a prototype of a simple drafting/design system that wasoperated by a light pen directly on a screen from the 1960's. You could draw ashape freehand, then immediately rotate it, modify it, duplicate it, orwhatever. You could draw lines connecting different objects, then erase themby simply drawing a squiggly line over it. The computer could interpret thesquiggles as a sign to erase something, all in real time. And this was half acentury ago, and decades before CARET. Think about that for a moment. Thepoint is, most of what we have today is much older than we think. The onlydifferences are that it's faster, cheaper, and a marketing team has given it aglossy finish and found a commercial application for it. But if you take awaysome of the speed, power, ubiquity and consumer appeal, you'll find a lot oftoday's technology scattered throughout much of the 20th century. I hope thisis helpful.Isaac\" From: IsaacSubject: Re: \"Drones\"Date: June 27, 2007 Received 4:28 PM, Albuquerque, New MexicoTo: earthfiles@earthfiles.comIsaac: \"1) While I wasn't a major player in the (CARET) organization, I washardly 'some worker.' My middle-management position is the only reason Iwas able to make out with what I did. Bear in mind that even someone in myposition would never get the chance to leave with even the smallest of actualartifacts, but paperwork smuggling was feasible for anyone who wasn'tsubjected to the frisking.Also, let's not forget that paperwork only proves so much. I'll be the first toagree that everything I've provided could be faked, I suppose. It is, after all,just a series of images. While the powers that be obviously don't want thismaterial leaking if they can help it, they're certainly aware that scans ofdocuments aren't in the same league as UFOs landing on the White Houselawn. I'm not the first person to leak a document or a photo, and I won't be thelast. The information I've shared is very unlikely to change the world, and thisis the reason I'm not worried about being literally murdered if I'm identified.I'll face consequences to be sure, but it's not the kind of thing they kill for.2) Of course the manual doesn't look anything like typical government andmilitary documents. The entire purpose of CARET was to recreate the lookand feel of silicon valley private enterprise, populate it with private industryengineers, and let it tackle the problem of extraterrestrial technology research.Style manuals were among the numerous things we brought with us from the'outside world.' I'm not sure what else can be said about this. I agree it'suncommon for non-standard documents to come out of this kind of research,but it's even more uncommon for people like myself (and even more so formany of my co-workers) to be brought into this kind of project in the firstplace. Most of us were decidedly not military men. I find it a lot more bizarrethan the fact that we were able to design our reports a certain way. CARETwas an exception to many of the usual rules.3) If he (one of many critics who emailed Earthfiles and which I shared with"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Isaac) believes the pictures are fake, I certainly can't do or say anything toprove otherwise. He sounds very sure of himself.4) Most importantly, be very wary of anyone who claims to 'know the mind'of extraterrestrials. The comments he's made are, to put it lightly, naive andextremely presumptuous. Firstly, he's referring to 'the aliens' as if there is asingle collective group of them. The universe is not split into 'humans' and'non-humans,' any more than Earth is split up into 'Spanish' and 'non-Spanish'or something equally arbitrary. There are numerous races - and again, like ourown races of humans here on earth, they do things in very different ways.His comment that 'the aliens don't do this or that' is akin to saying 'humansdon't speak Japanese.' Well, many humans don't, but Japanese humanscertainly do. The point is not that his statement is right or wrong, but simplythat it's phrased illogically. He then goes on to suggest that the design of thedrones is wasting space, which is again, alarming in its arrogance. We hadsome of the brightest minds in the world spending years just to understand asingle facet of their technology, while this individual claims to be able toassess basically every detail of a given design after looking at a single photoand conclude that it's inefficient. I'm not even sure such a statement should bedignified with a response, and I'm sure you can understand why.To be honest, whoever this person is, I wrote him off as soon as he said 'thealiens would never design as these pictures depict.' That's about aspresumptuous (if not ignorant) as a statement on this subject can be, at leastcoming from a fellow human. Unless there's an alien engineer on the otherside of this email, there's simply no way such statements could have merit. I'mreally only writing this as a courtesy to you.At best, he's been exposed to technology from a radically different race, andat worst, he doesn't know what he's talking about. This individual may haveaccess to real information, and he might not. If he is a fellow 'whistle blower,'then I'm not interested in attacking him. If he's not, and is simply makingthings up, then I'm even less interested. Whatever he is or isn't is not for me tosay, but judging by the way he talks about this issue I have my doubts.It's a big world and these are complicated issues. A sense of humility and theadmission we don't know everything is one of our greatest assets.Isaac\"More Information:For further information about the dragonfly-shaped \"drones,\" please see EarthfilesEnvironment reports below:• 07/11/2007 — Professional Computer Engineers Comment About \"Isaac\" and CARET Document• 07/10/2007 — 2005 and 2006 Memphis \"Drones\"?• 06/29/2007 — Another \"Drone\" This Week Near Maxwell AFB• 06/26/2007 — Part 2: Documentation, Palo Alto Caret Laboratory Q4-86 Research Report• 06/26/2007 — Part 1: Explanation of the Recent \"Strange Craft\" Sightings• 06/22/2007 — Dragonfly \"Drone\" Seen October 1995 in Arizona• 06/18/2007 — Writing In Chad \"Drone\" Image - A Link to NASA Clementine 1 Moon Mission?• 06/17/2007 — More Big Basin, California, Bizarre \"Drone\" Images• 06/15/2007 — Part 1: Northridge, California, Aerial \"Drone\" Eyewitness On the Record• 06/15/2007 — Part 2 - Star Wars Physicist Edward Teller, Outer Space Menace And Remotely PilotedVe hi c l e s ( RPVs )• 06/08/2007 — More Drone Photos and Other Eyewitnesses• 06/08/2007 — More Drone Photos and Other Eyewitnesses• 05/30/2007 — Birmingham-Type \"Drone\" Seen At Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, in Mid-1980s• 05/28/2007 — Letters About Unidentified \"Drone\" Aerial Objects• 05/25/2007 — Two More Eyewitnesses of Aerial \"Drones\" in 2005 and 2006• 05/21/2007 — Updated: Odd Aerial \"Drone\"?
