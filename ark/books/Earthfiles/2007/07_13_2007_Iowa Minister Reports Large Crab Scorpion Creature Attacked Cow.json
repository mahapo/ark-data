In August in either 1996 or 1997, he was in an 18-wheeler semi-truck travelingfrom Garden Ci ty, Kansas, to Grand Island, Nebraska. Tryi ng to make up for a ti me del ay, he travel ed north on283 (lower left corner) to Norton, Kansas, and went east to Highway 383 cutting acrossto Highway 183, which he took north to a small, rural Highway 4 (upper red circle). He turned east andbetween Upland and Campbell (red highlighted line) was an \"unearthly\" creature on theback of a cow in a pasture along Highway 4.July 13, 2007 Council Bluffs, Iowa - The first phone calls I made to law enforcement,ranchers and fellow journalists about the animal mutilation mystery was in earlySeptember 1979 - twenty-eight years ago. I was Director of Special Projects at theCBS-TV station in Denver, Colorado, where I produced documentaries, live studioaudience broadcasts and news updates about science and the environment. That summerof 1979, hundreds of animals, ranging from cattle and horses to goats, sheep and wildgame such as deer and elk, were found with the same pattern of bloodless excisions fromtheir bodies without signs of struggle or tracks - not even their own tracks.I remember being with one sheriff in northern Colorado at the scene of a fresh mutilatedcow when he found a quarter-inch-wide hole about an inch deep where the right shoulderjoined up with the cow's neck. The sheriff stuck his pen in the hole and said to me, \"This isnot a bullet hole.\"In the nearly three decades since, I have investigated dozens of fresh mutilations andseveral have had an odd quarter-inch by about one-inch deep hole in the chest and neckarea that have never been explained.Further, in northern New Mexico, on October 1, 2006, a red Angus bull was found withone of its eyes, the genitals, and anus \"surgically removed\" without blood. On both sides ofthe bull's rib cage, there were three round circles impressed into the hide.

He entered the U. S. Marines out of high school in 1976to 1979, followed by one year in Marine Reserves. During the Carter Administration, heflew as a Marine security guard on Air Force One.Then for sixteen years, he worked as a firefighter and paramedic. He received medicaltraining at Wichita State University and an Emergency Medical Technology Degree fromKansas University Medical School in 1985. After suffering a physical injury, in 1996 JohnClick retired to driving trucks for Feekes, a division of KMJ Trucking. Then in 2006, hebecame an ordained minister who works part-time in a Council Bluffs, Iowa, Baptistchurch. To pay bills, he also continues his trucking experience for an armored service thattransports money for Federal Reserve banks.A decade ago in August of either 1996 or 1997, between 7:30 and 8 PM, he was in an18-wheeler semi-truck traveling from Garden City, Kansas, to Grand Island, Nebraska.Trying to make up for a time delay, he traveled north on Highway 283 and went east toHighway 383 cutting across to Highway 183, which he took north to a small, ruralHighway 4 used mainly by local farmers. On Highway 4 going east between Upland andCampbell, Nebraska, John Click saw a bright light above a pasture where an \"unearthly\"creature, like a crab/scorpion combined, was on the back of a cow bellowing in pain.Interview:Rev. John Click, Ordained Minister, Iowa Baptist Church, and former U. S. Marineand firefighter/paramedic, Council Bluffs, Iowa: \"It was still light out and I was justdriving down the highway. The first thing that caught my eye was – I don’t know how todescribe it – it was a bright light and yet it was not like you were looking at a light bulb. Itwas just kind of a ball of light and I caught it out of the corner of my eye.WHAT COLOR?It was kind of a pale whitish-yellowish color.BIG OR SMALL?It was, in my estimation, maybe 10 feet in diameter.AND HOW HIGH ABOVE THE GROUND?I’d say from where I was out into the field, it appeared to be 10 or 15 feet above thetreetops.HOW FAR FROM WHERE YOU WERE IN YOUR TRUCK?The light was about 100 to 150 yards out in the field."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"STATIONARY OR MOVING?It’s just sitting there.CAN YOU SEE LIGHT REFLECTING ON THE TREES BELOW IT?The trees were probably about 75 yards from the road and this was on out in the openfield. But I didn’t notice any light coming to the ground or anything like that. And I lookedat the light and then glanced down and I saw some cattle along the fence along the road.And I’m going to say they were only one or two yards from the fence. \"Crab/Scorpion Thing\" On Backof Large, Bellowing CowI was driving along and saw that and thought, ‘That’s kind of weird.’ I looked at the roadand looked back and when I looked back I saw this (laughs) – the only way I can describeit is that it looked like a cross between a crab and a scorpion-type thing. It was probably agood 1200-pound cow. So, it was a big cow and this thing covered, I’d say from half itsback up to its neck, you know, where it starts on the back?WAS IT JUST ON TOP OF THE COW?Yeah, it was just lying on top, but the legs were like about half way down it. The creatureitself was probably three to four feet long. Unidentified \"crab/scorpion\" creature on top of cow bellowing in pain around7:30 PM, in either August 1996 or 1997, on Highway 4 between Upland and Campbell,Nebraska. Cow was only 25 feet from John Click's semi-truck on Highway 4, Nebraska.Drawing © 2007 by Rev. John Click.It was like three legs were over the back and another leg was kind of shorter and on theback toward the rear. I remember that I hit the brakes and backed the truck up. When Idid, there was this – I don’t know how to describe it except like a tail that had curved upover this (creature) whatever it was and it (tail-like tube) disappeared on the other side ofthe cow’s neck. The cow had its head back and neck kind of turned to the side and itsmouth was open. And the cow was making a weird noise like it did not like it at all (whatthe creature was doing).LIKE IT WAS IN PAIN?Yeah, like it was in pain. And I thought, ‘What the heck is this thing?’ The creature was apale reddish color.WHEN YOU BRAKED YOUR TRUCK BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU WERE SEEING,THE CREATURE THING ON TOP OF THE COW DIDN’T TRY TO MOVE AWAY ORHIDE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COW BECAUSE YOU HAD STOPPED?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"No, it didn’t seem to care at all! (laughs) And that’s what was kind of making me think,‘What the heck?’ I could still see it in my mirror, so I put the truck in reverse and backedup. \"Scorpion Tail\" Extended from Creatureinto Cow's Shoulder Area \"Sucking Blood\"When I got even with it (cow and creature), I looked out the window and I could see thattail-like thing stuck ... it wasn’t so much in the neck. The way the cow’s head was back, itwas more like down by the shoulder where the neck and shoulder connect.I could not believe what I was seeing. And then I could see like a pinkish fluid runningthrough the tail-like tube. And then the light started moving. I put the truck in gear andtook off down Highway 4 there. Where I saw this was between Upland, Nebraska, andCampbell, Nebraska. I think it’s about a 12-mile stretch right in there. And I was abouthalf way in between there.I got kind of scared then because I didn’t know what I was looking at. This thing lookedlike something not of this planet because I’d never seen anything like it. But that light Isaw out in the field, it moved around to where I could see t through my windshield. It wasstill at kind of a 45-degree angle and it raised up. And when it did, I thought, ‘It’s time forme to get out of here.’ Light Paces Semi-Trailer TruckCB Radio StaticI took off down Highway 4 and it (light) followed me and it switched sides of the truck,but it never went in front of the windshield. I’d see it out my driver’s window and then Iwouldn’t see it. Then all of a sudden I’d see it out the passenger’s window.AS IF THE LIGHT WERE PACING WITH YOUR TRUCK?Right. And I’m getting a little more worried, picking more speed up and I’m on my CB(Citizens Band radio), but I can’t get anybody to talk back to me. And I’d been talking to acouple of guys before that. But it was just static. I couldn’t get anybody to answer me oranything. So, I took off down Highway 4 and that followed me until I made the turn onHighway 281 North, northbound, which would be about Blue Hill, Nebraska. When I gotto Blue Hill, I did not see the light anymore.So, I went on and made my delivery at Grand Island. Then I came back the same way andturned on Highway 4 and by now it was dark, but I had a good flashlight and one of thoseQ-Beam type lights. I think it was about 10,000-candle power. I was shining it out in thefield between Campbell and Upland and I could not find that cow anywhere. But Iremember the feeling I got was that this thing (creature) was hurting the cow and I feltsorry for the cow because it was tossing its head back like it wanted the creature off andmaking this God awful noise – but that’s what I saw. To this day, I still don’t know what itwas. More Details About \"Crab/Scorpion\" CreatureCOULD WE GO BACK NOW AND DESCRIBE IN DETAIL WHY YOU THOUGHT ITLOOKED LIKE A COMBINATION OF A SCORPION AND A CRAB?You know how crab legs look? That’s kind of what the legs looked like. At first, I thoughtit looked like a giant spider. But the more I thought about it, I thought those legs werebigger, they were thicker, they were more like crab legs. And then when I saw that tail orwhatever it was up over the top (of the cow) and into the cow’s neck or wherever it wentbecause I could not see because that was on the other side of the cow’s head. But itappeared it went in where the shoulder attaches to the neck. I thought, ‘That’s like ascorpion!’ So, I just put the two together that it (creature) looked kind of like a crossbetween a crab and a scorpion.CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE SIZE OF THE TAIL TUBE THAT SWUNG UP OVER THECREATURE?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"I’m going to say it was at least as big around as my index finger.OH, SO QUITE THIN THEN?Yeah, it wasn’t a big huge thing. Of course, I was looking at it from a distance (about 25feet away), but it appeared to me it was only about as big as my index finger, maybe alittle bigger.MORE LIKE LOOKING AT THE END OF A STINGRAY TAIL?Yeah, exactly!IT COULD HAVE BEEN AN ARTIFICIAL MECHANICAL TUBE?I guess it could have been, but it looked alive to me.WAS IT THE SAME REDDISH COLOR AS THE CREATURE?Yes, it was all one color. It was more of a pale yellowish, but it had some kind of red to it.Now, the tail – I’m not sure where it was when I first saw this thing on the cow. By thetime I had got stopped and backed up, it was up over this thing (creature) and into thecow. But I do remember seeing a reddish-looking fluid flowing through this. The only wayI can describe it is that this thing looked like this thing was drinking this cow’s blood.WHICH MEANS THAT WHATEVER THE TAIL TUBE WAS, IT HAD TO BETRANSLUCENT FOR YOU TO SEE FLUID GOING THROUGH IT.Yeah, I could see movement through the tail, but I didn’t see anything like in the bodypart. This thing was kind of pulsating, or breathing or something. You could see the bodyof it moving. That’s what I mean by it looked like it was alive because it looked like it wasbreathing or sucking or – I’m not sure what it was doing.But I didn’t see any eyes or anything like that. It was pretty attached. I don’t think if thecow took off running that it was going to shake it off because it almost looked like thosecrab-looking things – you know, how crab legs have spiny points on them? It looked like itwas dug into the cow. It didn’t look like it was going anywhere.The light I saw was about 100 to 150 yards out in the field. But the cow, I was on thehighway and then there was like a little ditch that was maybe 10 feet across and there wasthe fence and then the cow was about 3 feet on the other side of the fence. So, I waslooking at the cow and this thing at a distance of maybe 25 feet maximum.EVEN WHEN YOU BACKED UP?Yeah, that didn’t seem to bother it (creature) at all and that’s what started me getting kindof worried. I figured when I backed up, it would be gone. But nope, it was still there.SO YOU ARE WATCHING FROM ONLY 25 FEET AWAY SO YOU COULD SEE THISTHING IN VERY CLEAR DETAIL?Oh, yeah.BUT YOU HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE IN EARTH LIFE?No! I’ve been scuba diving and all kinds of things and I’ve never encountered anythingquite like that! (laughs)WHAT DID THE BODY OF THE CREATURE LOOK LIKE THAT HAD THE LEGSHOOKED INTO THE COW?It was weird looking. It didn’t look hairy. It looked smooth, kind of like – how do Idescribe it? It looked smooth kind of like human skin, only with that opaque yellowish-reddish color. I didn’t see any hair on it. It was weird!THE SHAPE?It covered the whole cow’s back, but it appeared to me to be kind of from what I could seewide in the back and then came around almost like a roundish – kind of wide in the backand then came kind of straight up the back of the cow and then came around in the frontlaying on the cow’s neck. About the only thing I could compare it to would be a footballthat somebody cut the back off of. (laughs) If that makes sense.A FOOTBALL AND THE BACK IS CUT OFF ONE END?Right."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"WITH THE FOUR LEGS, THREE ABOUT THE SAME LENGTH AND ONE SHORTERCOMING OUT OF THE FOOTBALL SHAPE ON TOP OF THE COW.Right.IT LOOKED LIKE HUMAN SKIN, BUT WAS YELLOWISH-RED.Yeah, it was more yellow than red.WHEN THE THIN, STINGRAY-LIKE TAIL CAME UP, IT CAME UP OVER THEFOOTBALL INTO WHAT YOU ASSUME WAS THE NECK OR CHEST OF THE COW?Right. It was sort of like a blob sitting on the cow! But the legs did not look jointed. That’sanother thing I remember – it didn’t look like the joints of a crab. The thing’s legs were justkind of rounded and in there (the cow’s hide).DID YOU THINK OF A CRAB BECAUSE THE LEGS ARE SORT OF REDDISH ANDYELLOW-WHITE?Yeah. And the way they were stuck in (to the cow). You know, from watching a crab –what the creature’s legs kind of reminded me of was kind of like a King Crab because theyare bigger and have that sharp point on the end. The points were not deeply into the cow,but you could tell it was like gripping the cow, hanging on.I JUST DID AN EARTHFILES REPORT A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO IN MAYABOUT A MUTILATED BULL FOUND IN CANJILON IN NORTHERN NEWMEXICO. THE PHOTOGRAPHS SHOW THREE CIRCULAR IMPRESSIONS IN THEHIDE ON EACH SIDE OF THE RIB CAGE. THE RANCHER HAD NEVER SEENTHAT BEFORE AND NOW I AM WONDERING WOULD THOSE ROUND MARKSPOSSIBLY BE WHERE THE LEGS OF WHATEVER THIS IS WERE CLAMPED ONTO THAT COW IN NORTHERN NEW MEXICO?It could be. It didn't look like the legs were deeply in (the cow), but like it was hanging on. Why John Click Left the SceneWHY DID YOU LEAVE THE SCENE? IN OTHER WORDS, ARE YOU SITTING INYOUR TRUCK TRYING TO RAISE SOMEBODY ON YOUR CB RADIO WHILE YOUARE 25 FEET FROM THE COW AND CREATURE?No, I was pretty fixated at what was going on. I was more curious than I was scared atfirst. And then when I saw what was going on and got a good look, then I started getting alittle worried. And when the light moved and kind of got out where I could see it at a45-degree angle through my windshield and I thought, ‘Now, wait a minute. Something isgoing on here!’ And I just had this overwhelming feeling that I should not be there.SOME PEOPLE LISTENING MIGHT THINK, ‘WHY DIDN’T HE GET OUT OF THETRUCK AND APPROACH THAT FENCE AND MAYBE EVEN GO OVER THEFENCE? WHY NOT GET OUT AND TRY TO AGGRESSIVELY TRY TO INTERACTWITH WHAT WAS HAPPENING?If I would have had a weapon with me at the time, I probably would have. But I didn’thave a weapon and this thing was big and I didn’t like what it was doing to the cow and Ididn’t want to be next!THE COW DIDN’T TRY TO RUN AWAY?By the time I backed up, he (cow) was trying to walk forward, but was stumbling. Thecow’s head was back and up. I was facing east and the cow was facing west. His head wasup and kind of towards me and making a God awful noise. I never heard a cow make thatkind of noise before, but it sounded like he was in pain. The cow was starting to move atthat time forward. There were some other cows out there that had taken off.THEY WERE RUNNING AWAY FROM THE SCENE?Right. And this cow was trying to move forward, but it was like he was stumbling.WHEN YOU SAY A HE, CAN YOU SAY FOR SURE THAT THIS WAS A MALE COWAND NOT A FEMALE?No, I’m pretty sure it was a female, a cow. There were others out there that had horns andthis one did not."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"DID ANY OTHER CARS OR TRUCKS SLOW DOWN OR STOP AROUND YOU?No, that’s a pretty deserted highway. That’s why I was running it because I had gottenshort on time. I had got out of my previous stop late, so I was trying to make up some timeand on Highway 4, you can kind of go over the speed limit. (laughs) So, that’s why I tookHighway 4. Usually, I would run up Highway 183 to Highway 6 and cut over to Hastings.Or just go up 283 up to Lexington and over. But this day I took 383 to cut across Kansas,which cut off some time. And then Highway 4 is pretty deserted. Mainly farmers use it, soit doesn’t get a lot of traffic.REPEAT AGAIN EXACTLY WHERE YOU THINK THE PASTURE WAS.Between Upland and Campbell, Nebraska, on Highway 4. It's about an 8 to 10 mile stretchof road.DID YOU CALL POLICE OR ANY AUTHORITIES?No, I didn’t mainly because I didn’t think they would believe me.IT’S A SAD COMMENT ON THE WORLD, ISN’T IT?Yeah, and had I been able to find the cow and it had been down when I came back by, Iprobably would have. But I couldn’t find it. I don’t know if it wandered off or somethingpicked it up (out of the pasture) or what happened. Animal Mutilations Caused byExtraterrestrial Biological EntitiesOVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY AND MORE, THERE HAVE BEEN LINKSBETWEEN WORLDWIDE ANIMAL MUTILATIONS AND WHAT OURGOVERNMENT’S OWN ALLEGED DOCUMENTS REFER TO AS‘EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES.’ THE PERPETRATORS OF THESEUNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHS ARE NON-HUMAN CREATURES. WHAT IS YOURREACTION TO THAT AS THE EXPLANATION FOR PERHAPS WHAT YOU SAWAND FOR WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE SEEN IN TERMS OF BEAMS OF LIGHTSHINING DOWN ON ANIMALS?I have a pretty open mind to that. I do know what I saw was not any species here on Earththat I know of.DID YOU ASSOCIATE THE CREATURE WITH THAT LIGHT THERE THAT WASABOVE THE TREELINE?Yes, they were together. I just had this feeling, especially when the light was following me.‘Oh, my God, they are going to get rid of the eyewitness!’ That was my first thought.NOW YOU ARE A PRACTICING REVEREND IN 2007. WHY DO YOU THINK THATRELIGIONS AND GOVERNMENTS SEEEM TO BE SO PROTECTIVE, HAVE SOMANY POLICIES OF DENIAL ALLEGEDLY IN THE INTEREST OF NATIONALSECURITY TO KEEP THE MEDIA AND PUBLIC AWAY FROM FACTS SUCH ASWHAT YOU HAVE SEEN? THAT THERE IS AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL LINK TOWORLDWIDE ANIMAL MUTILATIONS.I think the reason they try to deny all this is:1) We’ve already made contact.2) We’re already sharing information.3) I don’t think they (govt) think we can handle the information, that it would cause amass hysteria. So, I think our government thinks that we can’t handle the truth.WHAT DO YOU THINK?I think we can. There have been a lot of movies out dealing with extraterrestrials. Prettysoon they are going to make it known they are around, but I don’t know if our government– how much contact they’ve had. But I think it’s a mass hysteria.THAT'S WHAT GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES ARE WORRIED ABOUT?Right.\"More Information:"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"For further information about worldwide animal mutilations, please see reports below inEarthfiles Archive:• 06/25/2007 — Updated: Half Cat in Waco, Texas, and Kangaroo Mutilations in New South Wales, Australia• 05/29/2007 — Final Part 7: Eyewitness Links Animal Mutilations to Non-Humans• 05/25/2007 — Update: Part 1, Unusual Animal Deaths• 05/13/2007 — Part 6: Eyewitness Links Animal Mutilations to Non-Humans• 05/11/2007 — CIA Origin of National Enquirer?• 05/06/2007 — Part 5: Eyewitness Links Animal Mutilations to Non-Humans• 05/05/2007 — Part 4: Eyewitness Links Animal Mutilations to Non-Humans• 04/28/2007 — April 24, 2007 - Part 3: Eyewitness Links Animal Mutilations to Non-Humans.• 04/19/2007 — Part 2: Eyewitness Links Animal Mutilations to Non-Humans• 04/18/2007 — Part 1: Eyewitness Links Animal Mutilations to Non-Humans• 04/09/2007 — More Cat Mutilations - This Time in Corpus Christi, Texas• 01/10/2007 — 2006: USA's Warmest Year On Record• 01/02/2007 — Grey Aerial Disk Reported by Chicago O'Hare United Airlines Pilots and Mechanics• 11/24/2006 — Scientific Data Supports Theory That Mutilated Montana Cow Dropped from Sky andBounced• 11/16/2006 — Pregnant Cows Disappear in Ohio; Horses Beheaded in Vancouver• 10/19/2006 — Another Cattle Mutilation in Pondera County, Montana• 10/02/2006 — Unusual Deaths of Six Female Goats in White Salmon, Washington• 09/29/2006 — Manipulation of Time and Matter by Non-Humans: The Experiences of Jim Sparks• 09/20/2006 — Updated: Three Sets of Concentric Rings in South Texas Field• 09/20/2006 — Animal Mutilations Increase Again in Argentina• 09/13/2006 — Part 2: Enchanting Wheat Bundles of Charlbury, Wiltshire• 09/05/2006 — Part 2: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet?• 09/04/2006 — Part 1: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet?• 08/23/2006 — More Cat and Dog Mutilations• 08/17/2006 — Military Helicopter Aggression Toward Red Sphere in U.
