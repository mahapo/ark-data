With current technology, one could only conceive oflevitating very light objects.” - Thomas Philbin, Ph.D., Theoretical PhysicistAugust 10, 2007 Fife, Scotland - Theoretical physicists work in their mind and on paperwith math and formulas trying to understand the laws of the universe. Some of the greatestof those minds have been Max Planck and Albert Einstein. More than a hundred years agoin 1900, Planck was struggling to understand radiation from black bodies. Actualexperiments forced him to suppose that the electromagnetic energy of the light at a givenfrequency could only take discrete values: it is \"quantized.\" Planck found that if he chosethe spacing between the allowed energies correctly, his equations agreed with theexperiments. This spacing is determined by a number, now called Planck's constant. Forthat theoretical physics work - now regarded as the birth of quantum physics - Max Planckreceived the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918. For that theoretical physics work – nowregarded as the birth of quantum physics - Max Planck received the Nobel Prize in Physicsin 1918.Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck, Physicist. Born April 23, 1858,in Kiel, Germany. Died October 4, 1947. Received 1918 Nobel Prizein Physics for his quantum theory and Planck's constant related directlyto the modern world's concept of \"vacuum fluctuations.\"Later in the 20th Century, when Planck's original idea had been developed into acomprehensive quantum theory of matter and radiation, physicists realized that Planck'sconstant also had profound implicatinos for the nature of empty space. There is constantunrest in this universe, a perpetual motion that even excites the vacuum of space.Physicists have learned there is no such thing as true emptiness. Imagine a humming,throbbing invisible engine behind the universe that we don’t see and don’t understand, butis always running. As long as that unseen engine vibrates, the vacuum of space still hasresonance with that invisible engine. Even after all matter, light, radio waves and otherfields are removed in a physics lab vacuum, there are still ceaseless and measurablefluctuations in what should be empty space. That strange unrest in emptiness is whatphysicists call “vacuum fluctuations.”Those vacuum fluctuations are like ghostly residues of the light, radio waves, strong andweak forces that were in the vacuum chamber before all matter and fields were removed.Mysteriously, those ghostly residues have a resonance with the matter and energyremoved. Those resonances fluctuate and create a physical force in the space betweenobjects.Because the strength of the force falls off rapidly with distance, it is only measurable whenthe distance between the objects is extremely small. On a submicron scale, this forcebecomes so strong that it becomes the dominant force between uncharged conductors.Dutch physicist Hendrik Casimir first proposed the existence of that force in 1948. Anexperiment proved him right when two uncharged metal plates were laid parallel to eachother in a vacuum. The force exerted by the vacuum fluctuations tried to pull the two"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"plates together and that force was measured. Now called the Casimir force, or effect, it’sbecome a problem in nanotechnology where that force is causing nano-sized elements tostick together and not work correctly.Hendrik \"Henk\" Brugt Gerhard Casimir, Physicist.Born July 15, 1909, in The Hague, Netherlands, anddied May 4, 2000. Predicted the Casimir effect.Now, in the latest New Journal of Physics, comes a theoretical method to reverse theattraction of the Casimir force so that it repels. The pencil-on-paper thought experimentuses two parallel mirrors instead of metal plates in a vacuum with a “perfect lens” betweenthe mirrors. Perfect lenses have been made and proved in lab tests to actually focus lightmore accurately than ordinary lenses. This newly published theory is based on focusinginfrared wavelenths in the vacuum fluctuations of around 1 millionth of a meter through aperfect lens. Then the Casimir force can be tricked into reversing its attraction to repulsionand could levitate light-weight bodies. Shorter wavelengths focused through the perfectlens could levitate even heavier bodies. So far, no lab on Earth has tested this theoreticalconcept, but the theoretical physicists behind the idea think it is only a matter of time thatexperimental physicists will be able to use a reversed Casimir force to levitate matter.The authors of this reversed Casimir work are Ulf Leonhardt, Ph.D., and Thomas Philbin,Ph.D., theoretical physicists in the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University ofSt. Andrews in Fife, Scotland. I talked with Dr. Philbin recently about their potentialbreakthrough in which ghostly vacuum fluctuations could be engineered to do work forhuman technologies.

In the 20th Century, itwas discovered that there really is not such a thing as completely empty space. You cansay this space is empty, there is not matter or material there. However, there are thingscalled ‘fields,’ such as light and radio waves, and they are not matter. You can think, ‘Well,then take those out of the empty space as well.’But then quantum mechanics came along and it was discovered that these fields cannotreally be exactly zero. There’s a fuzziness, a fluctuation in the fields, even in empty space.That fluctuation cannot be removed in any way. It is these vacuum fluctuations, orquantum fluctuations, that cause the Casimir force."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"In the Casimir effect, it is the vacuum residue of the vibrating fields that is all pervasive.Pervasive because you cannot remove the residue. There is no way to take it out. Even ifspace is empty, the vacuum residue of vibrating fields is still there. That’s what ‘vacuumfluctuations’ are.IT SEEMS THAT WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE VACUUMFLUCTUATIONS THAT SOMETHING IS SUSTAINING A VIBRATION ORRESONANCE EVEN IN THE VACUUM. WHAT DOES THE SUSTAINING?One way to understand why quantum mechanics requires the all-pervasive vibrations inthe fields, or fluctuations in them, is to take the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.Werner Karl Heisenberg, Physicist.Born December 5, 1901, in Würzburg, Germany, anddied February 1, 1976. Received 1932 Nobel Prize in Physicsfor his pioneering work on the Uncertainty Principle in quantum mechanics.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia: - “According to Heisenberg's UncertaintyPrinciple, it is impossible to have a particle that has an arbitrarily well-definedposition and momentum simultaneously. For example, the pattern (probabilitydistribution) produced by millions of photons passing through a diffraction slitcan be calculated using quantum mechanics, but the exact path of eachphoton cannot be predicted by any known method.“It is this interpretation that Einstein questioned when he said, 'I cannotbelieve that God would choose to play dice with the universe.' Physicist NielsBohr responded, 'Einstein, don't tell God what to do.' Bohr himselfacknowledged that quantum mechanics and the uncertainty principle werecounter-intuitive when he stated, 'Anyone who is not shocked by quantumtheory has not understood a single word.' ]People are perhaps familiar in hearing about this in terms of particles – that a particleessentially cannot sit still doing nothing. That violates the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principlebecause the particle’s position and momentum cannot be exactly known. So, it cannothave a definite position and at the same time, a definite momentum of zero, which wouldbe sitting there not moving. The particle must be jiggling about in some way.Now, what is probably less familiar to a general audience is that when you talk aboutfields, such as the electromagnetic field, the same thing applies to them. When you applyquantum theory to fields you find that they also cannot rest. Zero Point EnergyBut because of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, there’s a certain Zero Point Energy(ZPE), it’s called, that is required by the principle. This prevents one from saying inquantum physics that the vacuum is entirely devoid of fields. There always has to be somefuzzy presence of the fields. That’s the vacuum fluctuations. The vacuum fluctuations arepresent for all fields in the universe, not just the electromagnetic fields. There are fieldsthat govern forces in nuclear physics and all the fields have their own ghostly presence inthe vacuum.THERE ARE THE STRONG, WEAK, ELECTROMAGNETIC AND GRAVITATIONALFIELDS.Yes. However, I would stress that it is the electromagnetic one that is causing the Casimir"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"effect, not the others.THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PHOTON ENERGY IN ALL OF ITS FREQUENCIESAND THE VACUUM FLUCTUATIONS IS WHAT?The difference is that the photons that we can detect and others we see as light are real inthe sense that we can detect them. They can hit a detector and leave a signal. The vacuumfluctuations – we would not describe them as being real photons. They are sometimescalled 'virtual photons.'It’s very mysterious and strange and I would say it’s not something we understand fullyyet, the nature of the quantum vacuum, what it actually is. However, we have some ideasabout what it is and more importantly, we have ways of calculating the effects thequantum vacuum has and the Casimir force is an example of it. And we’re finding nowthat we can even engineer these vacuum fluctuations. But what they are is not somethingwe have a really good picture of. What Would 'Perfect Lens' Do to Casimir Force?WHAT PROVOKED YOU AND PROF. ULF LEONHARDT TO TRY REVERSING THECASIMIR FORCE SO IT WOULD REPEL RATHER THAN ATTRACT?We were thinking about what are called ‘perfect lenses.’ It was shown that these lenseswere theoretically popssible to build in 2001 by an English physicist called Sir John Pendryfrom Imperial College in London.An ordinary lens will form an image of an object. However, there is a limit to how sharpthat image can be in a normal lens. Essentially the limit is given by the wavelength of lightthat is being focused to form the image. It turns out that any structure, any detail in theobject being imaged that is smaller or finer than the wavelength of light will not be imagedsharply. It will be fuzzy. You cannot pick out any details in the image that are closertogether than the wavelength of light. They will just be blurred.However, Sir John Pendry predicted that you could build a lens that did not have thislimitation and would image objects to an accuracy, a sharpness, finer than the wavelengthof the light. These are called ‘perfect lenses.’ In practice, the perfect lens can only be builtto operate at a certain wavelength of light. Then if you have an image of an object that isradiating at that particular wavelength, you send that radiation through the perfect lens andit will focus that radiation and form an image of the object. In that object, you will be ableto see details of the object that are closer together than the wavelength of the light. That isthe perfect lens trick. That is what ordinary lenses cannot do.Subsequently, since 2001, those perfect lenses have been built experimentally and theyhave been shown to have this property of imaging objects more accurately than normallenses.Both Ulf Leonhardt and I were thinking about ways to understand how a perfect lensoperates. Having done that, we thought about what we could use this way of visualizinghow the perfect lens operates to discover new properties. An obvious one to try would bethe Casimir force – what would happen if you put one of these perfect lenses between themirrors? How would it affect the force?The perfect lens is imaging light so even though there is empty space between the mirrorsand the perfect lens is in between, there are the vacuum fluctuations going on between themirrors. Those vacuum fluctuations will also be imaged by the perfect lens.The question we asked ourselves is: What effect will the vacuum fluctuations have on theCasimir force?What we discovered is that if the distances are arranged properly, the Casimir force canturn from an attractive force into a repelling force.WHY?One thing I could say to try to get an idea of the effect the perfect lens has is to say thatbecause it’s imaging the light, the light sees the mirrors as being closer together than theyactually are due to the lensing effect of the perfect lens.Therefore, if the mirrors are sitting in physical space at a certain distance apart with theperfect lens between them, the vacuum fluctuations – as far as they are concerned – theysee the mirrors as being closer together than they really are."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"And if you can imagine – and this is the difficult bit now - pushing the mirrors actuallycloser together in physical space, then you get to a stage where as far as the vacuumfluctuations are concerned, the mirrors are sitting on top of each other.Now push them together even further in physical space, they sort of move past each otheras far as the vacuum fluctuations are concerned. It is this that causes the reversal of theCasimir force. The mirrors are sitting separated with the lens in between. But as far as thevacuum fluctuations are concerned, they are on the opposite sides of each other. They aresort of swapped around the positions of the mirrors.BUT WHY ARE THE FIELDS, FROM THE FLUCTIONS’ POINTS OF VIEW, ONOP P OSITE SIDES?As far as the fields, the vacuum fluctuations, are concerned, they are bringing the mirrorscloser together than the mirrors actually are in physical space. So, there is still room inphysical space to bring the mirrors even closer to each other when the vacuum fluctuationsthink the mirrors are actually on top of each other. So, when you physically move themirrors closer together in physical space, as far as the vacuum fluctuations are concerned,the mirrors move past each other and swap positions. That is the key thing that will reversethe Casimir force. Perfect Lens Focuses Vacuum Fluctuations,Causing Casimir Force to ReverseThe perfect lens is focusing the vacuum fluctuations. This is the incredible and mysteriousthing! There is nothing there. It’s vacuum. But as we were just discussing, in quantumphysics, it’s not completely a vacuum. There are the fluctuations taking place in theelectromagnetic field and the perfect lens is imaging those fluctuations. The fluctuationssee the perfect lens and they adjust to it. So, if you like, the perfect lens is altering thequantum properties of empty space.THE PERFECT LENS DOES NOT NEED PHOTONS TO FOCUS?Correct. It will focus the vacuum fluctuations. The vacuum fluctuations will see this lensand be focused by it. This is the remarkable thing. Even though there are no REALphotons there, the vacuum fluctuations in the field – sort of like virtual photons – areseeing the lens.WHAT IS THE PERFECT LENS MADE OUT OF?They can look rather different from each other, depending upon the wavelength of lightthey are engineered to operate at. One of their features is that they don’t do this focusingtrick, the perfect imaging trick, for all wavelengths of light. In practice, they are limited toa very narrow frequency band.What they look like is they are essentially repeating regular structures made of metal. So,there are certain metal shapes that are repeated in a sort of lattice-like arrangement.Metal lattice of \"perfect lens.\" Image courtesy University of California, San Diego.WHAT IS THE METAL THAT THE PERFECT LENSES ARE MADE OUT OF?Some that are made for the bending light the wrong way that I spoke about, gold is used.The metals don’t have to be exotic. It’s the shapes that the metal takes in the repeatingstructures that’s important. The lenses work by finding the right shape and having the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"shape repeated in a lattice-like structure. You can melt gold, put it into a mold, and you geta shape.SO WHAT DOES HAPPEN IN MAKING THE PERFECT LENS OUT OF GOLD?One of the shapes is a kind of horseshoe-like shape to achieve this bending light in astrange way. So, you just have a repeating structure of horseshoe-shaped gold.Perfect lens can focus on and engineer vacuum fluctuationswith a lattice of repeating geometric structures in a gold metamaterialsuch as the \"horseshoes\" above, which are about 50 microns wide,less than the thickness of a human hair. Photomicrographcourtesy St. Andrews University.Normal lenses are made out of glass and they bend light and focus things. The glass theyare made of is a nice homogeneous sort of material, right? But the perfect lens issomething completely different in terms of its structure and what it looks like. Instead ofbeing a nice smooth, uniform material, it’s actually engineered to be composed of lumps,repeating lumps of material. This is how it does this trick. The lumps are acting as thefundamental unit in the material, as far as the light is concerned. Of course, in matter thereal fundamental unit is the atom. However, in these perfect lenses, one builds structuresmuch bigger than the atom and has them repeating in a lattice. In normal solids, you haveatoms which are the lumps repeating. But in the perfect lens, you build much biggerrepeating structures made of metal and it is these arrangements, which cause the perfectimaging trick. How Does Perfect Lens \"Trick\"Casimir Force Into Reversing?WHY IS IT THAT THERE IS A MISINTERPRETATION OF HOW FAR APART THEMIRRORS ACTUALLY ARE AND SUDDEN FLIP TO THE OPPOSITE FOR THEVACUUM FLUCTUATIONS?We found that the way of thinking about what the perfect lens does to light is that it acts assort of a negative distance. I can explain this with a well-known example. If you view anobject in water, it can look closer to you than it actually is. For example, the bottom of aswimming pool looks a bit closer than it is. The water in the swimming pool is actuallydeeper than it looks from the surface. The reason for that is the light from the bottom ofthe swimming pool does not get to your eye in a straight line. It follows a bent path.One way in optics that we understand how light chooses the path to take is to say it doesnot choose the shortest path in space. It measures distance in a different way. The lighttakes in the properties of the different materials. Certain materials act as if they havelonger distances (for the light to travel) than other materials. Light takes the shortestdistance the way it calculates distance, which is different than our standard way ofmeasuring distance. This will explain the bending of light, why it follows a bent path.Of course, the distance between two points in space is a straight line. But light does notmeasure the distance that way. Light measures the distance depending upon the propertiesof the material. The light wave calculates the distance and followed the shortest pathaccording to the way the light calculates it. That’s one way of explaining these opticaleffects such as refraction, mirages in the desert.What we discovered is that a way of viewing what the perfect lens does is that it acts as anegative distance for light. The perfect lens constitutes a negative path length for the light.Therefore, when you have the two mirrors a distance apart, if you put in a perfect lens, itacts as a negative distance as far as light is concerned. So, the total distance between themirrors as far as light is concerned is the distance apart in space, but then there is thenegative distance you have to add in and so the distance light sees is smaller.THAT’S THE OVERLAP."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Yes. And so it is smaller as far as light is concerned. Therefore, you can push the mirrorstogether in physical space such that they are on top of each other as far as light isconcerned because of the negative bit you have to add in. You can push them togetherfurther so they swap over positions. That’s when you get the repelling Casimir force.THE REPULSION IS BECAUSE OF THE CONFUSION AT THE FIELD LEVELBECAUSE FROM THE FIELD POINT OF VIEW THAT SWAP SUDDENLY MEANSTHEY ARE STILL TRYING TO PUSH TOGETHER THOSE MIRRORS. BUT IN FACT,IN SWAPPING POSITIONS, THEY ARE NOW REPULSING THE MIRRORS.Yes, that is precisely it. You could say that the vacuum fluctuations have been tricked intothinking that they are pushing the mirrors together, which is what they have to do. That’swhat the Casimir force is. It attracts things together. So the vacuum fluctuations think theyare trying to pull the mirrors together, but because of the swap over, in fact, in the realphysical space, they are pushing the mirrors apart.So, we have this way of reversing the Casimir force. Then we have to ask: Can the perfectlens be built that will do this trick (beyond theoretical pencil on paper)? First, it wouldrequire a special type of perfect lens. We put in some numbers into the calculations and weestimated that with current technology what we could conceive humans could use thisrepelling force to levitate an extremely thin metal foil.Artist's impression of a thin mirror being held upabove another mirror by the quantum levitation effect.Image courtesy St. Andrews University, Fife, Scotland.So, the idea is that you would have a mirror on the table. Then you would have one ofthese perfect lenses sitting on top of that mirror.Then some distance above the lens in mid-air floating would be this extremely thin metalfoil that would be held in place against its own weight of gravity because the repellingCasimir force would balance the force of gravity pulling down the foil and it would levitatein mid-air. So, that’s the picture from our paper.IN THAT EXAMPLE, WOULD YOU NEED A PARALLEL MIRROR? OR IS THETHIN METAL FOIL TAKING THE PLACE OF THE PARALLEL MIRROR?It is the parallel mirror, yes. It is a very light mirror, is the point. Since the Casimir forces,in general, are very small, and the repelling force will be very small, the only weight itcould balance with current technologies would be very light like a thin piece of aluminumfoil.In principle, you could use this repelling Casimir force to levitate heavier objects, but notwith current technology. With current technology, one could only conceive of levitatingvery light objects.WHAT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO SCALE UP THE PRINCIPLES YOU HAVEBEEN WORKING WITH TO LEVITATE PEOPLE AND CARS AND LARGEROBJECTS?These perfect lenses only operate over a very narrow frequency range. They only do thetrick of perfect lensing for only a single wavelength of light. It turns out that thewavelength in which the perfect lens operates determines how heavy an object you canlevitate.Making perfect lenses that do this focusing trick for very short wavelengths is verydifficult. So, there is a limitation with current technology as to how short a wavelength youcan make a perfect lens work. As I said, the shorter the wavelength, the heavier the objectyou can levitate. So, to levitate heavier objects, you would need to have a perfect lensoperating at much shorter wavelengths than can be done with present technology.But in principle, if you could build one that could operate at extremely short wavelengthscompared to what has been achieved so far, then you could levitate heavier objects."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The exciting thing is to realize that one can engineer the properties of empty space, thevacuum fluctuations, to achieve very interesting physical effects and in nanotechnology inthe future, perhaps some very important applications.\"Physicists Ulf Leonhardt's and Thomas Philbin's theoretical proposalto reverse the Casimir force uses a single frequency of infra-red light that is 1 millionthof a meter in wavelength.
