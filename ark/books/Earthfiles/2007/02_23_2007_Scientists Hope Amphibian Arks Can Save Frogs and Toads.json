Click for Earthfiles PodcastFebruary 23, 2007 Corvallis, Oregon - In the past few weeks, I have interviewedscientists who are alarmed that global warming could destroy the Amazon and otherrainforests and devastate the biodiversity of plants around the world. In Svalbard, Norway,construction begins in March to build a Noah’s Ark to preserve the Earth’s plants in a seedbank built inside an Arctic mountain. In the oceans, corals and much marine life arethreatened with extinction. On land, millions and millions of honey bees that pollinate somany of the fruits, vegetables, nuts and melons we expect in supermarkets have beendisappearing in the United States, Spain and Poland.Amphibians around the planet are dying out at an alarming rate. In the 20th century, therewere about 6,000 species of amphibians. Today in 2007, nearly half (43%) are in seriousdecline, one-third (32%) are threatened and an estimated 122 species have becomeextinct since 1980! Amphibian species were around when dinosaurs dominated Earth. Andamphibian species survived that asteroid catastrophe 65 million years ago that wiped outthe dinosaurs. But amphibians now are not surviving what industrialized human civilizationis doing to this planet."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"PhysOrg.com 01-11-06: \"Recent studies show the Earth's warming climateis contributing to the increase of Chytrid disease, a fungus infection that is responsiblefor the extinction of many tropical frog species.

Scientists Urge \"Amphibian Arks\"Recently scientists from around the world met in Atlanta, Georgia, to launch a global“Amphibian Ark” project in an effort to save thousands of frogs, toads and salamanderspecies threatened by fungi, pathogens, increasing UV radiation, rapidly changing habitatsin the face of global warming - and the unknown. The idea originated with the Conservation Breeding Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union. The goal forthe Amphibian Ark is to have zoos, aquariums and botanical gardens around the planetconstruct bio-secure facilities to preserve at least 500 each of nearly 2,000 endangeredamphibian species – especially frogs.After amphibians are collected for the Amphibian Arks, they would have to be cleaned ofdamaging fungi. Raising funds for such an international effort is linked to an upcomingglobal publicity campaign that will designate 2008 as the “Year of the Frog.”One of the world’s leading amphibian researchers is Andrew Blaustein, Ph.D., andDirector of the Environmental Sciences Graduate Program at Oregon State University inCorvallis. I asked Prof. Blaustein why scientists are now saying it is urgent to build“Amphibian Arks” around the world.Amphibian declines have occurred around the world. The areas that have sufferedthe most declines include Central America, the Caribbean, Australia andother parts of Asia. Map by Amphibiaweb.Interview: Andrew Blaustein, Ph.D., Director, Environmental Sciences Graduate Program,Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon: “It seems like we’re at a desperate pointright now. We have a major extinction event on the planet. Extinctions are naturalprocesses, but the rate at which extinctions are occurring across the planet in almost alltaxonomic groups – different types of organisms from plants to microorganisms to big"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"animals to frogs – is unprecedented.At this point, we are losing species at such rates that we are so desperate that we’re tryingto do everything we can to preserve some of these great species, such as amphibians andmany of those species are frogs.COULD EVEN THE AMPHIBIAN ARK BE TOO LATE?For some of the species, it’s probably going to be too late. For example, there was theGolden Toad, which used to be really common in Central America. But they are gone!In modern times, there were about 5700 species of amphibians, maybe 6,000. It isestimated that:- 43% of those species have populations declining.- 32% of them are threatened.- 168 species are presumably extinct.- Out of that, 122 species became extinct since 1980.So, you’re talking about 6,000 species, 43% are declining, 32% are threatened, 122 speciesprobably have become extinct since 1980, and this is worse than birds and mammals.Amphibians are hit harder than birds and mammals. Like dinosaurs, they are gone! Many Causes of Amphibian Die-OffsWHAT DO YOU THINK IS CAUSING THE DIE-OFF OF AMPHIBIANS AROUNDTHE WORLD?I’ve always said there are multiple causes for amphibian extinctions and I’ll name a few ofthem. All these things are going on.- Habitat destruction and alteration is obviously one of the major causes.- There are different kinds of pathogens. There is the fungus called theChytrid fungus, but there are also water molds such as Saprolegnia.- There are viruses.- There are bacteria.- Then there are also climate change problems with increasing temperatures,global warming.- There is ozone depletion and UV radiation (that increases with thinningozone).- There is pollution, contamination.- There are introduced exotic species. An example is bullfrogs introduced tothe western United States. They are not native, but they are eating andcompeting with native western species.WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE WORST CASE IF THE AMPHIBIAN ARK ANDOTHER EFFORTS CANNOT GET SOME KIND OF CONTROL ON THIS DECLINE OFAMPHIBIANS? WHAT IS WORST CASE IF THE AMPHIBIANS CONTINUE TO GOEXTINCT?If you took amphibians away from the planet tomorrow, you would see a very big changein the ecosystems. Amphibians are really important predators. They eat billions andbillions of insect pests per year. They eat other things, too. They’ll eat vertebrates, they’lleat snakes, they’ll eat fish and some of them eat birds. You would notice a great increase,in my opinion, in mosquitoes and flies and things like that, which carry a lot of diseasesthat humans get.Also, lots of things eat amphibians! There are lots of fishes who eat them, birds eat them,mammals eat them. So, the ecosystem would be drastically changed. In fact, someecosystems such as the northeastern forests of the United States the amphibians sometimescomprise the largest group of invertebrates. There are more amphibians, if you weighedthem, then there are birds or mammals, for example.If all the amphibians disappear, we would have drastic changes in ecosystems, we wouldhave an increase in the number of insect pests, we would have a decrease in the number ofanimals who eat amphibians. So, there would be unbelievable changes in ecosystems. Youwould not recognize them. Amphibian Ark Effort to Stop"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Amphibian ExtinctionsWHAT DO YOU SEE THE AMPHIBIAN ARK PROJECT DOING TO HELP?The Amphibian Ark is going to try to get as many amphibians as possible – mostly whatthey are talking about are from the Central America area – and try to propagate them incaptivity with the expectation to release them later on and back into the field after wefigure out what is going on down there.But, it’s going to be difficult because the amphibians are really not that easy to keep andbreed in captivity. We don’t know all the habits of these amphibians. We don’t knowexactly what they all eat or what they all need. There are some great exhibits – one is atthe Great American Museum in New York City a couple of years ago where they hadthese exotic species from Central America and they are doing a great job. It’s a travelingsystem. But to get the amphibians to actually breed in captivity and get their numbersincreased is going to take great effort.DO YOU THINK THE NOAH’S ARK IDEAS COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE?I think it’s possible. It’s going to be really difficult. It’s like a desperation move where youhave to take all these animals from their native habitats and try to rear them in captivity,propagate them and release them. There are some success stories, though. American bisonalmost went extinct the early part of the century, but there were a few remnant individualsaround and the populations were put in captivity so they could reintroduce them. We triedto do this with the California condor.Amphibians might be a little tougher because we don’t know a lot about them. They are alittle bit more difficult in captivity. But it’s what we have to do. That’s about it. I don’tknow what else to say – it’s a desperation move.But I’m talking about a group of animals – amphibians – that were around when thedinosaurs were around! The amphibians were around before the dinosaurs. Now, theamphibians are starting to get hit. They survived all that before, and now they are goingdown the tubes!YES, THEY SURVIVED WHATEVER WIPED OUT THE DINOSAURS.They made it! But they aren’t making it anymore. They are hurting. Thinning Ozone and IncreasedUltra Violet Light RadiationWHAT ABOUT YOUR RESEARCH ON INCREASING UV LIGHT WITH THINNINGOZONE? DO YOU THINK THAT IS PLAYING ANY ROLE IN THE EXTINCTIONS OFAMPHIBIANS?We think increasing UV light is one of five or six reasons why the amphibian populationsare crashing. One of the things that UV does – and we did not know this when we firststarted our research. There seems to be ..You know, UV hits a living system, such as an amphibian, a fish or a person. It hamperstheir immune systems. When it hits the immune system in an animal or a person, they can’tcope with pathogens, with diseases.We think there is a relationship here between habitat destruction that causes stress andozone depletion, which allows in more UV radiation and actually inhibits the immunesystem of these amphibian animals. Then they get diseases more easily.I don’t think, for example, that it’s just that a pathogen moves in and starts to wreakhavoc. I think some environmental change induces some other changes where thepathogen gets to go rampant.SO WHAT YOU MEAN IS THAT THE FUNGUS SPREADING IS OPPORTUNISTIC ONWEAKENED IMMUNE SYSTEMS?That’s what I’m thinking. I might be wrong, but it’s what I’m thinking and a lot of mycolleagues think. We think that very thing.

THE QUESTION IS: WHY WOULD FUNGUS ALL OF ASUDDEN BE KILLING OF MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF BEES IN THE UNITEDSTATES, SPAIN AND POLAND?We think that would be another case of some environmental change occurring or sometype of stress due to environmental change that causes these fungi to be opportunistic andto knock off some of the natural populations of amphibians and bees and whatever.PROF. BLAUSTEIN, WHAT KIND OF FUTURE WOULD WE HAVE IF THE HONEYBEES AND AMPHIBIANS DIE OUT?I’m not a honey bee expert, but I’ll tell you this: I’ve been hearing about this. You know,we’re not just losing honey bees here. But, honey bees – they are incredible pollinators!They are really important and you’ve got to get some insect person to talk about that.If frogs disappear, there would be unbelievable ecosystem damage. We have a lot ofspecies that are disappearing that are going to influence how ecosystems function in thefuture. I mean we’re losing native earthworms because exotic species of earthworms thathave been introduced have already changed the soil! If you change the soil, you’re goingto change what grows in the soil. Worst Case from Amphibian ExtinctionsWHAT YOU MEAN IS THAT THE EARTH IS CHANGING SO RAPIDLY ANDEXTINCTIONS ARE THE PRODUCT OF ALL THESE CHANGES, LIKE DOMINOESFALLING. WHAT IS WORST CASE FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW?That’s a good way to look at it. The fact of the matter is I can’t tell what is going to happenin the future, but we could make some predictions. As a matter of fact, I have a colleaguewho works with me. His name is Josh Lawler. He’s going to be at the Univ. of Washingtonin a few months as a new professor there.We have modeled some of the things that would happen if certain climate changesoccurred. For example, if there are increased temperatures or different moisture regimes.You will see shifts in the range of species. You will see some species that will becomemore northern. Some of the southern species will move upward.When you get extinctions and climate change, like from global warming, you will getspecies in new areas that were not there before. So, if the climate warms up in NorthAmerica - we’re already seeing this. We’re expecting animals and plants and things thatfly to move up north. They might bring new pests with them, or new diseases. We’realready seeing an increase in malaria. We’re already seeing increases in animals that causedengue fever. We’re seeing tropical diseases going into North America right now."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Sea Level Rise and Food Shortages SEA LEVEL RISE OVER THE NEXT NINETY YEARS COULD, IN WORST CASE,BE AS HIGH AS FOUR FEET.

My home area of New York would be under water.And lots of Florida. The fact is you have to make the public aware about some of theseproblems. Global climate change is a fact. Ninety-five percent of the scientists who studythe phenomenon agree. There are about 5% who don’t and they get about as much pressas the 95% who do. But you’ve just got to make the politicians and public aware of all this.We’re looking at massive extinctions of many species. We have a major biodiversity crisiswhere animals and plants and microorganisms are declining at unprecedented rates. Wehave climate change that’s helping this out. And we have a lot of problems here! We haveincreasing populations. I don’t even want to predict what’s going to happen in 90 years.It’s a scary situation. Can the Chytrid Fungus Be Stopped?IN 2007, WHAT WILL YOU AND OTHERS BE DOING TO SAVE AMPHIBIANS?What I’m doing now is working on some diseases. I’m working on that Chytrid fungus andon Saprolegnia, which is a type of water mold. These are two types of diseases that havehit amphibians where I live in the Pacific Northwest. They are also global. They are allover the world. We don’t exactly understand everything about the Chytrid fungus. Wedon’t know where it came from or why it’s starting to be so prevalent all over.We do know that the other disease I’m looking at has been around for a long time and a lotof it has come in from stocked fishes, transfers from fishes to amphibians. So, what we’retrying to do is look at the Chytrid fungus in more detail to see if there are someenvironmental changes that have triggered the Chytrid fungus to break out.IS THERE ANYTHING YOU ARE WORKING ON THAT MIGHT STOP THE SPREADOF THE FUNGUS?I’m not looking at how to stop the fungus. There are other people looking at that. I’m justlooking to see what is triggering the fungus and which animals are susceptible.Interestingly enough, some types of animals are more susceptible than others. Bullfrogsseem to be carriers of the fungus, but they don’t seem to get sick. And they seem to bespreading it.WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE ANSWER TO THAT?They have some type of immune system that doesn’t let them get sick. But the bullfrogsare carrying the Chytrid fungus around and we have done experiments in my lab to showthey can give it to other species.Lots of animals have some kind of peptides that allow them to cope with different types ofpathogens. Bullfrogs might have some of them. Some people have isolated peptides thatknock off pathogens from herpes all the way to the Chytrid fungus. People are looking atthat.HOW WOULD YOU DISTRIBUTE MEDICINE IN THE WILD AMPHIBIAN WORLDIF YOU COULD COME UP WITH SOMETHING FROM THE BULL FROG THATMIGHT FIGHT OFF THE FUNGUS?Good question. I don’t really know how you would do that! (laughs) I don’t know how youwould do it in the field.What I’ve been trying to do is showing how these amphibians are susceptible to differenttypes of environmental insults.

AAS has invited Prof. Blaustein to speak attheir upcoming May 29-31, 2007, meeting in Honolulu, Hawaii. A special session isplanned to discuss “the reality of bolide impacts as a significant effect on the terrestrialenvironment is a real possibility, but radiation effects are not generally considered.However, radiation events are expected over geological timescales and have been shownto have potentially strong effects on the terrestrial environment. Such events might includenearby supernovae, gamma-ray bursts and unusually large solar flares. While there is newinterest in climate change in the geological and paleontological community, there isincreasing evidence for strong coupling to astrophysical causes. Confirmation of theabundance of extrasolar planets has created new interest in the possible distribution ofhabitable planets.”Prof. Andrew Blaustein has substantial data about increased UV radiation on Earth causedby thinning ozone and the link between that increased radiation and damage to immunesystems in amphibians.

A number of causes are believed to be involved,including habitat destruction and modification, over-exploitation, pollution, introducedspecies, climate change, increased ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB) and disease. However,many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and amphibiandeclines are currently a topic of much ongoing research.BackgroundIn the past three decades, global declines in populations of amphibians (the group oforganisms that includes frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, and caecilians) have occurredworldwide. An international convention of amphibian biologists in 2004 has announcedthat over a third of the world's amphibian species are threatened, and more than 120species have likely become extinct since the 1980s.Declines have been particularly intense in the western United States, Central America,South America, and eastern Australia (although cases of amphibian extinctions haveappeared worldwide). While human activities are causing a loss of much of the world’sbiodiversity, amphibians appear to be suffering much greater effects than other species oforganisms. Because amphibians generally have a two-staged life cycle consisting of bothaquatic (larvae) and terrestrial (adult) phases, they are sensitive to both terrestrial andaquatic environmental effects. Because their skins are highly permeable, they may bemore susceptible to toxins in the environment than other organisms such as birds ormammals. Many scientists believe that amphibians serve as \"canaries in a coal mine,\" and"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"that declines in amphibian populations and species indicate that other groups of animalsand plants will soon be at risk.Declines in amphibian populations were first widely recognized in the late 1980s, when alarge gathering of herpetologists reported noticing declines in populations in amphibiansacross the globe. Among these species, the Golden toad of Monteverde, Costa Ricafeatured prominently. The Golden Toad, Bufo periglines, was the subject of scientificinvestigation until populations suddenly crashed in 1987 and disappeared completely by1989. Other species at Monteverde, including the Monteverde Harlequin Frog (Atelopusvarius), also disappeared at the same time. Because these species were located in thepristine Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, and these extinctions could not be related tolocal human activities, they raised particular concern among biologists.Natural Population Fluctuations orProblematic Declines?When amphibian declines were first presented as a conservation issue in the late 1980s,some scientists remained unconvinced of the reality and gravity of the conservation issue.Some biologists argued that populations of most organisms, amphibians included, naturallyvary through time. They argued that the lack of long-term data on amphibian populationsmade it difficult to determine whether the anecdotal declines reported by biologists wereworth the (often limited) time and money of conservation efforts.However, since this initial skepticism, biologists have come to a consensus that declines inamphibian populations are a real and severe threat to biodiversity. This consensus emergedwith an increase in the number of studies that monitored amphibian populations, directobservation of mass mortality in pristine sites that lacked apparent cause, and anawareness that declines in amphibian populations are truly global in nature.Potential Causes of DeclinesNumerous potential explanations for amphibian declines have been proposed. Most or allof these causes have been associated with some population declines, so each cause islikely to affect in certain circumstances but not others. Many of the causes of amphibiandeclines are well-understood, and appear to affect other groups of organisms as well asamphibians. These causes include habitat modification and fragmentation, introducedpredators or competitors, introduced species, pollution, or over-harvesting. However,many amphibian declines or extinctions have occurred in pristine habitats where the aboveeffects are not likely to occur. The causes of these declines are complex, but many can beattributed to emerging diseases, climate change, increased ultraviolet-B radiation, orlong-distance transmission of chemical contaminants by wind.Habitat DestructionHabitat modification or destruction is one of the most dramatic issue affecting amphibianspecies worldwide. As amphibians generally need aquatic and terrestrial habitats tosurvive, threats to either habitat can affect populations. Hence, amphibians may be morevulnerable to habitat modification than organisms that only require one habitat type.Amazon rainforest destruction. Overhead view of clear-cutting for slash-and-burnagriculture in the Peruvian Amazon. Location: Southeastern Peru; from Cuzco to Boca Manu.Between May 2000 and August 2005, Brazil lost more than 132,000 square kilometers of forest -an area larger than Greece—and since 1970, over 600,000 square kilometers (232,000 square miles)of Amazon rainforest have been destroyed. Image by Mongabay.com."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Habitat FragmentationHabitat fragmentation occurs when habitats are isolated by habitat modification, such aswhen a small area of forest is completely surrounded by agricultural fields. Smallpopulations that survive within such fragments are often susceptible to inbreeding, geneticdrift, or extinction due to small fluctuations in the environment.Introduced SpeciesNon-native predators and competitors are also affecting the viability of frogs in theirhabitats. The mountain yellow-legged frog which typically inhabits the Sierra Nevada lakeshave seen a decline in numbers due to stocking of non-native fish (trout) for recreationalfishing. The developing tadpoles and froglets fall prey to the fish in large numbers. Thisinterference in the frog’s three year metamorphosis is causing a decline that is manifestthroughout their ecosystem (\"On the Rebound.\" Elizabeth Daerr, National ParksMagazine, January-February 2005, p. 49).Chemical ContaminantsThere is clear evidence that chemical pollutants are causing frog developmentaldeformities (extra limbs, or malformed eyes). Pollutants have varying effects on frogs.Some alter the central nervous system; others like atrazine cause a disruption in theproduction and secretion of hormones. Experimental studies have also shown thatexposure to commonly used herbicides such as Roundup or insecticides such as malathionor carbaryl greatly increase mortality of tadpoles. Additional studies have indicated thatterrestrial adult stages of amphibians are also susceptible to Roundup, particularly POEA,which is itself not a pesticide but a surfactant. Atrazine has been shown to causes maletadpoles of African clawed frogs to become hermaphroditic with development of bothmale and female organs. Such feminization has been reported in many parts of the world.While most pesticide effects are likely to be local and restricted to areas near agriculture,there is evidence from the Sierra Nevada mountains of the western United States thatpesticides are traveling long distances into pristine areas, including Yosemite National Parkin California. Some recent evidence points to ozone as a possible contributing factor to theworldwide decline of amphibian.DiseaseA number of diseases have been related to mass die-offs or declines in populations ofamphibians, including \"red-leg\" disease (Aeromonas hydrophila), Ranavirus (Familiy:Iridiviridae), Anuraperkinsus, and Chytridiomycosis. It is not entirely clear why diseaseshave suddenly begun to affect amphibian populations, but some evidence suggests thatthese diseases may have been spread by humans, or may be more virulent when combinedwith other environmental factors.TrematodesThere is considerable evidence that parasitic trematode platyhelminths (a type of fluke)have contributed to developmental abnormalities and population declines of amphibians insome regions. These trematodes of the genus Ribeiroia have a complex life cycle withthree host species. The first host includes a number of species of aquatic snails. The earlylarval stages of the trematodes then are transmitted into aquatic tadpoles, where themetacercariae (larvae) encyst in developing limb buds. These encysted life stages producedevelopmental abnormalities in post-metamorphic frogs, including additional or missinglimbs. These abnormalities increase frog predation by aquatic birds, the final host of thetrematode.Chytridiomycosis FungusIn 1998, following large-scale frog deaths in Australia and Central America, researchteams in both areas came up with identical results: a previously undescribed species ofpathogenic fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. It is now clear that many recentextinctions of amphibians in Australia and the Americas are linked to this fungus. Thisfungus belongs to a family of saprobes known as Chytrids that are not generallypathogenic.The disease caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is called Chytridiomycosis. Frogsinfected by this disease generally show skin lesions and hyperkeratosis, and it is believedthat death occurs because the fungus makes it impossible for the amphibian to respireacross the skin. The time from infection to death has been found to be 1–2 weeks in"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"experimental tests.Subsequent research has established that the fungus has been present in Australia since atleast 1978, and present in North America since at least the 1970s. The first known recordof Chytrid infection in frogs is in the African Clawed Frog, Xenopus laevis. BecauseXenopus are sold in pet stores and used in laboratories around the world, it is possible thatthe Chytrid fungus may have been exported from Africa.Climate ChangeLarge stands of ecosystem such as rainforests are being destroyed at a phenomenal ratedecreasing available habitat. Also pollutants indirectly affect frogs by way of ozonedepletion causing sun burn damage to the delicate moist skins of frogs, and furtheraffecting their immune systems.Increased ultraviolet-B radiationLike many other organisms, increasing ultraviolet-B (UVB)radiation due to stratosphericozone depletion and other factors harms amphibians. However, the amount of damagedepends upon the life stage, the species and other environmental parameters. Thus, forsome species, UVB harms early stages such as egg or larval stages whereas for otherspecies it is more harmful to adult stages (e.g. eye damage). Exposure to UVB radiationmay not kill a particular species or life stage but may cause sublethal damage. UVBradiation may act synergistically with climate change, contaminants and diseases.A recent review of most published studies done to test effects of UVB on amphibiansshowed that very few studies found any significant mortality on embryos when exposed tonatural levels of UVB. Moreover, the few studies that did report increased mortality afterUVB exposure were carried out with experimental procedures that were unrealistic whenconsidering the life history of the species being tested. For example, the eggs of a speciesof salamander which are normally deposited on the undersides of submerged logs andstones were exposed to full sun in shallow water.Amhibian tadpoles which can swim and seek shelter from open sunlight (UVB) wereexposed to UVB for long periods without any opportunity to seek refuge. Overall,amphibians are well protected from damage from natural ambient levels of UVB by severalfactors: the enzyme photolyase in eggs, melanin pigment of eggs and embryos, jelly coatsaround eggs and developing embryos. Especially effective is the dissolved organic contentof the water which darkens water and attenuates UVB within the first few centimeters ofwater in lakes and ponds used for spawning by amphibians.Over millions of years, amphibians have evolved efficient protection against damage fromUVB exposure.The death or deformity of even a single amphibian after exposure to UVBunder natural conditions has never been documented. Despite a small increase of UVB dueto atmospheric ozone thinning the evidence for UVB as a causal factor in amphibiandecline is very weak.Increased Noise LevelsFrogs and toads are highly vocal, and their reproductive behaviour often involves the useof vocalizations. There have been suggestions that increased noise levels caused by humanactivities may be contributing to their declines. In a study in Thailand, increased ambientnoise levels were shown to decrease calling in some species and to cause an increase inothers. This has, however, not been shown to be a cause for the widespread decline.\"Notes and references Blaustein, Andrew R., and P.T.J. Johnson. 2003. The complexity of deformedamphibians.
