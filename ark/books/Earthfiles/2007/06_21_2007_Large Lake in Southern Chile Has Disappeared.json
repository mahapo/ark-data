The only things left were chunks of ice on the drylake bed and an enormous fissure.\" - Juan Jose Romero, Reg. Dir., CONAFPerhaps as much as 10 acres of lake water one hundred feet deep are gone fromthe Magallanes region of southern Chile.Ice chunks were left behind and a new ,large ground fissure, w hich might have resulted from an earthquake between Marchand May 2007. Perhaps the lake water is underground. Image courtesy CONAF. June 21, 2007 Santiago, Chile - Chile's National Forestry Corporation (CONAF) reportsthat water in a well known lake covering perhaps as much as ten acres 100-feet-deep inthe Magallanes region near Chile's southern tip has vanished.CONAF's Regional Director, Juan Jose Romero, told Reuters: \"In March we patrolled thearea and everything was normal. ...We went again in May and to our surprise, we foundthe lake had completely disappeared. The only things left were chunks of ice on the drylake bed and an enormous fissure.\"The lake water source was largely melting glaciers. Some speculate that perhaps betweenthe March and May patrols, there was an earthquake that opened up the fissure and all thelake water went underground. That hypothesis is unproved, but Southern Chile has hadthousands of minor earthquakes in 2007 - although no specific seismic event is known tohave occurred between March and May at the lake site."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Red circle marks the Magallanes region of southern Chile wherethe lake disappeared, leaving behind ice chunks and a large ground fissure.For further information about global warming and melting glaciers, please see reportsbelow in the Earthfiles Archive:• 06/01/2007 — Is Earth Close to Dangerous Tipping Point in Global Warming?• 05/18/2007 — Antarctica: Unprecedented Western Ice Melt and CO2-Saturated Southern Ocean• 03/17/2007 — Honey Bee Disappearances Continue: Could Pesticides Play A Role?• 02/23/2007 — Scientists Hope \"Amphibian Arks\" Can Save Frogs and Toads• 02/23/2007 — Part 1: Earth Life Threats - Alarming Disappearance of Honey Bees• 02/23/2007 — Part 2: Earth Life Threats - \"Noah's Ark\" for World's Seeds• 02/02/2007 — Updated: New U.
