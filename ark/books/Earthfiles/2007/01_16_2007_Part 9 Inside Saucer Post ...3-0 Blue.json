Each group had about five objects. They came down the beamand then turned out of the beam.\" - Donald R. Berger, ROTC, University of CincinnatiReturn to Part 1January 16 , 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico -An official publication of Civilian Research, InterplanetaryFlying Objects (CRIFO) © 1957 by Leonard H. Stringfield.THE PHOTO 'FINISHERS' - Official and OtherwiseEvidence, in saucer lore, assumes many forms. If not a three-dimensional filament of angelhair or a controversial \"hot rock,\" it can be a photograph or a movie showing a shape inthe sky, a blip on radarscope, or a voice or sound on a tape recorder. When \"contact\"stories became popular in 1952, the tapes were quick to follow. I've heard several, eachpurporting to be evidence. One, sounding like a musical arrangement of Morse Code andbelieved to be signals from a space species, was in my opinion, wishful thinking. Mostothers, preachments and warnings by space people, are just pure bunk.Where the shysters really shine is in the photo lab. Their \"rogues' gallery is enormous.However, there are a number of \"fraudulent\" photographs in public circulation that belong,in all fairness, on the debatable list. In these instances, the photographer does not intend tobe spurious, but is tricked unwittingly by optical phenomena, such as Newton Rings, or bya high-flying \"something,\" such as a meteor or balloon. Doubtlessly in this category, thereare thousands of \"saucer\" photographs that will never be heard of, or seen, by either theAir Force or a civilian agency because ( 1) the photographer doesn't give a hoot aboutsaucers, or (2) his scruples go beyond opportunity!A good example of unexploited opportunity is that involving a 35mm Kodachrome slide inthe collection of Jack Gunderman of my advertising office. The photograph was snappedby Gunderman through his automobile's windshield while en route to a Mexican vacationin September 1956. My first opportunity to see the slide was at a friend's home and it all"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"happened quite unceremoniously. We had just passed pictorially through Texas into thedesert wastes of Mexico, when the slide was projected and everyone exclaimed, \"Flyingsaucers!\" In view was a simple roadside scene and a spacious sky. In the upper left handcorner were two silvery discs, one astride the other, both tilted as though ready to sweepdown on the road. Asking Gunderman if he had been holding out on us, he smiledknowingly and said that he never thought of them as being saucers, but was sure they werejust optics.On the other hand, the Air Force handling of saucer film is just as mysterious as some ofthe film submitted to them for study. Despite their Fact Sheets which attempt to explainaway all saucer film, they are not eager to admit possession of certain film, especially suchthat is not so easily explained away! In mind is the photograph taken July 19, 1956, by ateenager, Michael Savage, of a disc flying near his home in San Bernardino, California.According to the town paper, The Daily Sun, officers at George AFB were interested inthe boy's experience and wanted to see the negatives. And, according to a letter publishedin APRO, which its editor received from Dr. Leonard Taylor, friend and neighbor of theSavage family, \"...We reported to the Air Force at George Air Field and were contacted bypersonnel from Norton AFB who personally reviewed the site of picture taking. I havepersonally examined the No. 127 negative prior to giving it to AF personnel, who asked toborrow it and send it to ATIC.\" (Air Technical Intelligence Center)But in October of 1956 when an informed ATIC agent visited my home to pick up theangel hair specimen, I asked about the Savage film, and was told that it had never beenreceived by ATIC. Had Norton AFB actually sent the film to ATIC? If so, were theyunable to explain away the object in the photo, thereby classifying its analysis - andcausing their agent to deny its possession?Another act of hocus pocus involves the Mayher film, a 16mm movie which shows a brightsaucer-shaped object streaking over Miami, Florida, July 29, 1952. Accompanied byfriends, Ralph C. Mayher shot forty feet of film, but today he owns only a few framesthanks to somebody's slight of hand. After shooting the film, Mayher phoned the MarineAir Station. Sent to the scene was Lt. Aldridge who took the film roll with him when heleft. For the rest of the story, I quote from Tom Comella's Research Bulletin of June 21,1955, as follows: \"Although denied the right to show his (Mayher's) films while in uniform,copies were supposedly sent to the Air Force for analysis.However, a letter addressed to Mayher and dated April 13, 1954, revealed the following:'This is to advise you that a search of the Air Technical Intelligence files has failed to showthat the Air Force has ever received the film you mentioned. It is our belief that since thisfilm was originally submitted to a naval base, it must still remain with naval intelligence.'The letter was signed by 1st Lt. R.C. White. Mayher then wired the Marine Corps AirStation in Miami where he was stationed as a service photographer the night he caught theUFO on film. The reply, dated April 19, 1954, stated: 'Saucer film turned over to Air Forceon July 31, 1952.' The telegram carried the name of Col. T. G. Enis, C. O. of the airstation.' USAF Takes UFO FilmsAnother movie film which apparently fell prey to Air Force legerdemain was thatphotographed by Nicholas Mariana on August 19, 1950, at Great Falls, Montana. Thestory is told in a technical article by R. M. L. Baker, appearing in the Spring 1957 issue ofSaucers as follows: \"...Mr. Mariana recalls that the Kodachrome original, as returned tohim from the Eastman Kodak Processing Laboratory, comprised 315 frames. This originalfilm was shown by him before several clubs and other audiences in Montana. He recallsthat the first 30-odd frames showed larger images of the UFOs with a notch or band at onepoint on the periphery of the objects by which they could be seen to rotate in unison, whileon the rest of the film the objects show up only as unarticulated bright, white dots. Thefilm as returned by the Air Force, according to Mr. Mariana, had had the first 35 framesremoved and only the remainder of the film was returned and that the clipped-off part waslost.\"Still another case of apparent mishandling involves the famous Tremonton film, theproperty of Mr. Delbert Newhouse, a Chief Warrant Officer in the U. S. Navy, whophotographed 10 to 14 UFOs seven miles north of Tremonton, Utah, on July 2, 1952. Afterextensive analysis, according to Newhouse, by the Air Force, Navy and privatelaboratories, the original was not returned. Other Confiscations"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Faring worse was William Rhodes who, in July 1947, snapped a photo of a UFO overPhoenix, Arizona, submitting it to authorities for analysis. According to a letter whichappeared in the Spring 1948 issue of Fate magazine, Rhodes got nothing in return.My first and only experience with a controversial film and its controversial handling by theAir Force began on October 14, 1956, when I received three separate reports of UFOstraversing the skies over and near Cincinnati. Later I learned that on the evening of thatdate, Harry Baston, a photographer interested in lunar studies, had taken severalexperimental photos through his 6-inch telescope, three of the moon. In a fourth photo notfocused on the moon, a luminous object appeared. the object was off-center and cut off atthe edge of the photograph. But the portion showing is semi-oval and sharply defined.Radiating around the semi-oval is a misty aura of light. The background is totally black, nocelestial bodies showing. Baston says he cannot explain the object, or image, and is certainthat it is not a type of Newton Ring or other optical phenomena. Baston is also of theopinion that the apparent object was not a result of the film's development fluid, for he hasthe negative and this also shows the semi-oval and the aura.Unable to explain the one photograph, I phoned Captain Gregory at ATIC. I told him of myacquisition and when he indicated interest, I offered to submit three photos (and fivenegatives) to his office for analysis. While on the subject of photographs, Gregoryemphasized ATIC's extensive employment of top scientists, including foreign, to analyzeany purported evidence concerning UFOs. He also remarked on the \"rumor\" charging theAir Force of being \"guilty of not returning UFO film or the originals\" to its owner andsuggested that I personally number the backs of each photo submitted so that I coulddetermine its return. The rest of the story is best told in a letter dated May 14, 1957, fromMajor T. J. Connair, Jr., Adjutant, ATIC, which follows:\"Attached herewith are the original three (3) photographs and five (5)negatives which you submitted to this organization for review and commenton 7 November 1956. Reference is also made to your letter of 12 January1957 in which you requested the status and disposition of this material.\"We regret the delay, but as part of the study and reviews, the photographswere submitted to a scientist who later was assigned to an overseas project,leaving them behind.\"With respect to our findings, please be advised that the photographs andnegatives were subjected to a series of microscopic and other examinations,including a motion picture size projection. The light appears to be emanatingfrom an outside source into a container believed to be the inside of a telescopetube and photographed with the camera at the eyepiece and being at a slighttilt or angle. A comparison of the sky around the moon with the dark portionaround the ovoid of light further indicates that the latter coloration is not aphotograph of the sky. The fringe of light to the left of the ovoid (in ouropinion) attest to this.\"We are not in position to comment whether your source, which you state isan astronomer, was or was not aware of this, or if this is merely a case of anattempted hoax with you as an unwitting intermediary.\"Copies have been made of the original material to be included with ouranalysis and other data in case files.\"I have only two comments. One, Harry Baston, who is not an astronomer, never declaredthat the ovoid image in the photo was a UFO or a saucer. Having given consent to submitthe photo to Air Force specialists, he would have realized the chances of himself beingexposed as a hoaxer. Thus, I am sure the photo is not a hoax! Two, the original threephotos I submitted were not returned! THE NORWOOD SEARCHLIGHT INCIDENTIf we were to use another exemplary case in which photographs, including movies, play aprominent part, not only as evidence but again illustrating a possible legerdemain, I wouldcite the Norwood searchlight incident.But as the facts stand, this one case is exemplary in more ways than photography. To me,it is one of the best cases on civilian record in regards to testimonial evidence. That is: ifwe accept as evidence certain scientific statements and evaluations, plus thousands ofwitnesses, including members of the Catholic clergy, the press and the military."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The incident begins August 19, 1949, during a carnival on the grounds of the St. Peter andPaul Church in Norwood, Ohio, a city of 35,000 population \"within\" the city of Cincinnati.For such occasions, Reverend Gregory Miller, pastor of the church, had purchased fromarmy surplus an 8 million candle power searchlight. Borrowed to operate it was SergeantDonald R. Berger of ROTC of the University of Cincinnati. It was during the height offestivities when Sgt. Berger's sweeping searchlight suddenly flashed across a stationarycircular object in the sky. Rev. Miller was called to the scene and later others joined in.That was the beginning. From that date until March 10, 1950, when the object was lastseen, Sgt. Berger, who thought he had picked up a \"space platform,\" began logging theevents which follow:\"August 19, 1949. Place: St. Peter and Paul Church, Norwood, Ohio. 2015 to2300 hours. While operating for festival, picked up object at 1585 milselevation. The object was stationary, appearing as glowing disc. When Imoved the searchlight away, the disc continued to glow. Estimated range: 4 or5 miles. The sky was clear with thin haze at high altitude. I took no action, butnext day articles appeared in two local papers re: object.Sept. 11, 1949. Place: St. Gertrude Church, Madeira, Ohio. 1915 to 2315hours. Picked up object at 15,000 to 20,000 feet at 1620 mils elevation. Theobject disappeared within a few seconds, traveling straight up. I picked it upagain at much greater altitude. Then, when I changed carbons, I lost it againuntil 2115 hours. As soon as it reappeared, I phoned Wright-Patterson Field.The sky was clear with no visible clouds or haze. Several thousand people alsosaw object.Sept. 17, 1949. Place: Milford, Ohio. 1900 to 2000 hours. Testing thesearchlight about dusk, I had it set at 1600 mils. I could see an object whichlooked like a white glow. When I turned the light off, I could see nothing. Idid this several times. As soon as it became dark, I turned on the light at sameelevation and caught object in the beam.Oct. 23, 1949. Place: St. Peter and Paul, Norwood. 1915 to 2245 hours. Iturned on the light and picked up object at 1600 mils. Among those presentwere William Winkler, Father Gregory Miller, Robert Linn (Managing Editor,Cincinnati Post) and Leo Hirtl (Post reporter). Reverend Miller and Linnphoned Wright-Patterson and reported object to Intelligence Officer. About2200 hours, two distinct groups of triangular-shaped objects seemed to comeout of the main disc. Each group had about five objects. They came down thebeam and then turned out of the beam. The same performance was repeatedabout half hour later. The disc was still visible when I turned out the light forthe night.Oct. 24, 1949. Place: St. Peter and Paul. 1915 to 2100 hours. Set light at 1600mils. The object appeared immediately in the beam. ATIC agent and LouGerhart with me at the time. Held object in beam for about half hour untilcovered by clouds.Nov. 19, 1949. Place: Norwood, Ohio. 1830 to 2245 hrs. At 1915 hours thebeam of the light flashed on the object. Guiding the light back on the object, itthen disappeared immediately. About a minute later I picked it up again muchhigher. The elevation was between 1605 and 1610 mils. Many witnesses,including William Winkler. Sky was covered with low broken clouds. At time,objects appeared much brighter.Dec. 20, 1949. Place: Norwood, Ohio. 2015 to 2200 hours. Turned light on at2015 and picked up object immediately. At first it was faint and small. Ashaze cleared, object brightened. At 2130 it got much brighter and spread outalmost as large as beam, then disappeared. Present were D.A. Wells (Un. ofCincinnati physicist), Dr. Paul Herget (Un. of Cincinnati astronomer), twoO.S.I. members, Father Miller, the mayer of Norwood (R. Ed Tepe) andReginald Myers. According to Rev. Miller, their names were suspiciouslyalike: one Eichleberger and the other Eichlebarger. In discussing this, weagreed the similarity seemed more than just coincidence.Jan. 11, 1950. Place: Norwood, Ohio. 1930 to 2115 hrs. turned on light, butdidn't find object until about 1945 hours when haze blew away. Observed itfor about 15 minutes, very clearly, then it dimmed. It was called to myattention that some smaller objects were passing through the beam. I saw atleast two objects several times. Also present were William Winkler and M/Sgt.R. Ekleberry, M/Sgt. John Savage and Sgt. W. Pflueger of the Air NationalGuard."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"March 9, 1950. Place: Norwood, Ohio. 2000 to 2200 hours. About 2000 Ipicked up object with the light. About 2045 hrs. two small objects came out ofthe disc and it looked as if the disc was pushed out of the beam. In about tenminutes, the disc moved back into the beam. The sky was clear. Elevenpeople were present.March 10, 1950. Place: Norwood, Ohio. 1900 to 2300 hours. Caught object inbeam at 1600 mils. At 1945 hours the object moved up and across the beamand disappeared. Half hour later, object reappeared in beam in same position.Object stayed in beam until I turned light off for the night. Present wereFather Miller, Capt. Wilks, R.Myers, Wm. Winkler and others. Capt. Wilksphoned Wright-Patterson Field. Capt. Wilks watched the object with glasseswhile I moved the light.\"Had I awaken several months earlier in 1950 from my great oblivion, I might have beenlucky to glimpse the searchlight-illumined object. But as fate had it, it was not until 1952,while appearing as a guest on a special \"saucer\" program on WCPO-TV that I got a properperspective into the case. Among the program's participants, which included local saucersighters, was Rev. Gregory Miller who reviewed Sgt. Berger's log and described his ownobservations. Also present was Harry Mayo, City Editor of the Cincinnati Post. He wasnot talking because of laryngitis. Leo Hirtl, a Post columnist honked skeptically at saucersbecause he thought that the small objects seen on the eventful night of October 23, were\"geese.\" Tempers flared. Rev. Miller reminded Hirtl that geese do not have tail lights. I, notto be outdone, put in my interplanetary two cents worth. After the program, and with thecast once again becalmed, Rev. Miller called me aside. From his pocket, he handed meseveral photographs. \"They'll show you the object in the searchlight beam. If you and yourwife have time, I'd like to show you some movies.\"Continued in Part 10 - Scenes from Norwood, Ohio, Searchlight IncidentMore Information:For further information about Leonard Stringfield's UFO Status Reports, please see reprintsbelow from the Earthfiles Archives:Status Reports I• 10/25/2005 -- Final Part 6: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 10/13/2005 -- Part 5: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 10/05/2005 -- Part 4: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 09/30/2005 -- Part 3: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 09/26/2005 -- Part 2: Retrievals of the Third Kind - Kingman, Arizona Crash• 09/25/2005 -- Part 1: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary CustodyStatus Reports II• 09/19/2005 -- Final Part 9: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/17/2005 -- Part 8: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/14/2005 -- Part 7: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/06/2005 -- Part 6: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 08/22/2005 -- Part 5: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 08/17/2005 -- Part 4: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/20/2005 -- Part 3: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/14/2005 -- Part 2: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/12/2005 -- Part 1: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New DataStatus Reports III• 07/05/2005 -- Final Part 15: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 06/20/2005 -- Part 14: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 06/17/2005 -- Part 13: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 05/10/2005 -- Part 12: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 05/04/2005 -- Part 11: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 04/19/2005 -- Part 10: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence © June 1982 byLeonard H.
