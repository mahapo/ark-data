The ten warmest years in the past 150 years have all occurred after 1990.Temperature graph by NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies.August 8, 2007 Geneva, Switzerland - In mid-July at the Cheltenham Science Festival inEngland, global warming was a featured topic. One of the speakers was Fred Pearce, anenvironmental journalist and author of a new book entitled, The Last Generation: HowNature Will Take Her Revenge for Climate Change. He told his audience, “I want to scareyou about climate change. We are probably the last generation to be able to rely on astable climate. ... The truth is, the more we observe about the climate system, the morefrightening the scenarios that scientists are starting to develop. Past climate change hasbeen more violent and extreme than we have been led to believe. Tranquility looks like theexception rather than the rule. We could be measuring sea level rises in meters, notcentimeters. Old ideas about climate chang are just not how the world works. Whenclimate does change, it does so suddenly and violently.”Is human civilization, with its industrial pollution of methane, carbon dioxide and othergreenhouse gases, flicking on the switch for more rapid global climate change than anypopulation can adequately handle? If global weather is erratic in 2007, what will it be likein another ten years?The United Nations World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reports that the “globalland surface temperatures for January and April 2007 will likely be ranked as the warmestsince records began in 1880.” Further, the head of the Climatic Research Unit at theUniversity of East Anglia, U. K., has predicted that 2007 could surpass 1998 as thewarmest year on record owing to rising concentrations of greenhouse gases and a growingEl Niño warming of the Pacific. The ten warmest years in the past 150 years have alloccurred after 1990.The U. N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), reported in 2007 thatthere has been an increasing trend of extreme weather events over the past fifty years andthat erratic weather events are likely to intensify as the Earth continues to warm up.

More than 20 million people in India andBangladesh have been forced to leave their homes after recent monsoon rains andHimalayan glacier melts have flooded rivers. Now post-flood diseases threaten to kill morepeople.- Franklin Joseph, Director of India's World Vision Emergency Response, said: \"There is afear when the water recedes that diseases will strike. Water sources will be contaminatedwhen the villagers return. We need to provide clean food and homes.\"- The U.K. Meteorological Office reports that in the period May to July 2007, 387.6 mmof rain have already fallen across England and Wales, making it the wettest early summersince precipitation records began there in 1766. At least eight people were killed in theheavy rainfalls.- Northern England and parts of Texas saw torrential rain and flooding in June to July2007. Austin, Texas, has had its wettest year on record so far.- In Sudan, abnormally heavy rains and flooding destroyed 23,000 mud homes and killedat least 62 people.- The Arabian Sea had its first documented cyclone in June 2007, which affected Oman.- The Maldives islands average only five feet above sea level and were overcome by15-foot-high ocean waves and flooding in May. \"It is an annual occurrence at this point ofthe monsoon. Storm surges are quite common, but it is unusual to have them to the extentwe have had today,\" said government spokesman Mohamed Shareef in the Maldives'capital of Male. \"It is essentially a rise of the tide. The water came in at least 100 feet (30meters) on some islands, and then receded in the evening.\"- Uruguay in May 2007, unusually heavy rains in Uruguay have caused the worst floodingto hit that country in 50 years. More than 12,000 people were evacuated and another110,000 people were affected by the emergency, most of them children, women andelderly living in poor communities. A week of heavy rain also caused landslides and riversto break their banks. “Within two days, we received precipitation between 350 and 400millimeters, while on average in most parts of the country we get 800 to 1000 millimetersper year,” said UNICEF Uruguay Representative Tom Bergmann-Harris.- Mozambique's government on February 4, 2007, declared a “red alert” for theevacuation of communities along the Zambezi River Basin, as rising water levelsthreatened to flood low-lying areas. Heavy rains in Mozambican territory created thisthreat, as well as in the neighboring countries of Zambia and Malawi, which also feed theZambezi River and its tributaries. An estimated 285,000 people were affected by thefloods.On February 22, 2007, Mozambique suffered another natural disaster when Cyclone Faviomade landfall in Vilanculos, in the coastal province of Inhambane. Thousands of acres incrops were destroyed, health centers and schools were badly damaged and an estimated150,000 people were displaced from their homes.Scorching Heat in Northern Hemisphere- Temperatures in Greece reached 110 degrees F. (46°C) in a heat wave across southernEurope. The Greek government has activated a civil emergency defense plan to deal withthe heat wave, which is also affecting the rest of the Balkan peninsula, with forest firesfrom Croatia to Romania. A previous extreme heat wave in 1987 killed at least a thousandpeople.- China has also had a heat wave in recent days reaching 104 degrees F. (40 degreesCelsius) in southwestern regions such as Chongqing. More than 3,500 people werehospitalized and at least five people died. China.org reports the highest temperature so farwas in the central Chinese city of Shijiazhuang at 109 degrees Fahrenheit (43 degreesCelsius.)"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"- Russia had an extreme heat wave across western and central regions during May 2007,breaking several temperature records. On May 28, 2007, in Moscow, temperaturesreached 32.9°C (91.2°F), the highest temperature recorded in May since 1891(31.8°C/89.2°F). This is the first time in 128 years that the Russian capital has suffered asustained 30°C (86°F) or higher temperatures. This heat prompted Russia's energyadministrator to restrict the use of non-residential energy for the first time on record in thesummer.- Drought and Fires in Southeastern Europe: Millions of acres in destroyed crops andwidespread forest fires are direct results of high temperatures and severe drought insoutheastern Europe, according to the Global Drought Monitor.- Montana, Idaho and California have been fighting huge wildfires all summer long andthe Midwestern states have exceeded 100 degrees F., including Montana and NorthDakota. The National Weather Service has issued excessive-heat warnings for severalstates in the South and Midwest. To date, three people have died from heat exposure andthe Tennessee Valley Authority said that the Monday, August 6, power consumption brokea peak record of 32,095 megawatts for 8.7 million customers.August 8, 2007 Large Fire Incidents of 100 acres or moreoccuring in timber, or a wildfire of 300 acres or more occuring in grass/sage.Red, blue and black colors are where firefighters are working.Green is naturally ignited wildland fires allowed to burn.Map by National Interagency Fire Center, Boise, Idaho.Unusual Cold in Southern Hemisphere- During the floods, heat and fires of the Northern Hemisphere summer, South Americahas been suffering one of its coldest winters on record, with blizzards and snowfall sendingtemperatures down to 0 Fahrenheit freezing and below in Argentina and Chile.- Argentina's capital Buenos Aires witnessed snowfall in July for the first time in 90 years.Wet snow fell for hours without accumulating. A cold snap caused by freezing air fromAntarctica killed two people. Before then in late May 2007, was a bitter cold snap thatproduced subfreezing temperatures, the coldest in forty years in Buenos Aires. That coldwave contributed to an energy crisis and 23 people died from lack of heat.- South Africa had almost ten inches (25 centimeters) of rare snow fall in late June 2007on the city of Johannesburg. Mountain passes were closed and one person died."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Credit 2002 by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.More Information:For further reports about global warming, please see reports below in the EarthfilesArchive:• 07/11/2007 — Mystery of Night Shining Clouds - Another Global Warming Change?• 06/21/2007 — Large Lake in Southern Chile Has Disappeared• 06/01/2007 — Is Earth Close to Dangerous Tipping Point in Global Warming?• 05/18/2007 — Antarctica: Unprecedented Western Ice Melt and CO2-Saturated Southern Ocean• 05/08/2007 — Exploded Star 5 Times Brighter Than Any Supernova Seen Before• 02/23/2007 — Scientists Hope \"Amphibian Arks\" Can Save Frogs and Toads• 02/23/2007 — Part 1: Earth Life Threats - Alarming Disappearance of Honey Bees• 02/23/2007 — Part 2: Earth Life Threats - \"Noah's Ark\" for World's Seeds• 02/02/2007 — Updated: New U.
