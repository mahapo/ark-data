Then columnist Jon Hilkevitchat the Chicago Tribune followed up with a story about a dozen or so United Airlinesmechanics, pilots, baggage people and a manager who watched a silvery-grey disc hover inthe sky over Chicago O'Hare's Concourse C-17 for several minutes. [ See 010207Earthfiles. ]Some eyewitnesses said the egg-shaped disc was spinning. Others reported that when itsuddenly rose vertically at high speed, it punched a hole in the thick cloud cover. The holeallegedly lasted for several minutes before the wind blew the clouds back together. In histelevision interviews for CNN and other news media, Jon Hilkevitch said that photographshad been taken - perhaps even by a pilot leaning out of his cockpit window. But no imageswere published by the Chicago Tribune. I checked with one of the newspaper's editors onJanuary 25, to see if the paper had received any photographs, but the answer was no.However, two days before on Tuesday, January 23, 2007, in the Comanche, Oklahoma,offices of AboveTopSecret.com, an anonymous emailer sent a cell phone image showingO'Hare airport in the lower left and a pale, egg-shaped object in the upper right of theframe.The popular website, AboveTopSecret.com has specialized in posting UFO-related imagesand anonymity is guaranteed. AboveTopSecret.com was started in 1997 by Simon Grey.He was interested in secret military projects and government bases. The website grew andMark Allin joined the effort. Then a third partner, SkepticOverlord, who prefersanonymity, got involved about three and a half years ago. Today, AboveTopSecret.comaverages 350 million hits a month, about 9 to 12 million page views per month, andupwards to 3 million unique visitors a month.While Mark Allin and I were doing a phone interview about the first cell phone image hehad received, a second image was sent to the website. Mark has shown both cell phoneimages to top Photoshop and other electronic graphics experts. The consensus is that thecell phone images are real.Interview:Mark W. Allin, Co-Owner, Above Top Secret.com, Oklahoma: “On January 15, 2007,a new member signed up on our site. We had an existing thread that another memberstarted. We have 80,000 registered numbers, just to give you an idea of that aspect of thewebsite. A member in Chicago started a thread about the Chicago O’Hare incident(originally occurred on November 7, 2005, but kept quiet, apparently at the requests of ofUnited Airlines and Federal Aviation Administration ). It was just a curious thing he heardabout and was surprised that it made the mainstream news, but then went kind of quiet.By January 15th, we had a new member sign up with the Username 'RampAgentX.'Now this person claims to be an employee, baggage handler, at O’Hare for United Airlines."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"He also claimed that he witnessed the event.Now, vetting this individual has been difficult because he also makes the statement that hissupervisors had warned his crew that they were not to go public or not to speak publiclyabout the incident for the reason ‘they don’t want United looking like kooks.’So this guy is concerned about losing his job, and we have been unable to vet him beyondbeing able to trace his IP address back to Chicago. We do have other members at our sitethat are FAA employees, very familiar with airport operations and we have a few membersthat actually work at O’Hare Airport. We have a flight controller who told me kind ofprivately that if RampAgentX – he might not have been a witness to the UFO, but hecertainly appears to be a baggage handler at O’Hare. So, I’m trying to make very clear thatI make no assumptions, and AboveTopSecret makes no assertions as to the validity ofthese peoples’ reports. They just are what they are and are what we have to work with.RampAgentX went on to say that not only did he witness this event, but he knew of afellow employee who had their cell phone in hand during the event and took a picture of it.This person he was going to try to contact and get the picture put on our website.

The more narrow croppingof this image might have been done to eliminate the photographer's reflection.Image directly above sent to AboveTopSecret.com with January 25, 2007, email, includedhere with Mark Allin's permission: \"Hi, this probably seems crazy, but I was at o'hair airport in a terminalwaiting to board a flight (which happened to be delayed), and I saw thesupposed UFO. I snapped a picture with my camera phone. this is not FAKE.It's not a hoax, and it looks somewhat similar to the picture posted,however I think the one already posted might be a fake because in thatpicture the object looks bigger than in the picture I took. I was lookingout one of the terminal windows during that time and snapped the pic. Wherecan I e-mail the pic to? Also, PLEASE keep my entire name anonymous. if youw ant, you can use an alias, just don't mention my name.\"ark Allin: \"On Tuesday night, January 23, 2007, we had an anonymous membersigned up behind a proxy. For those who don’t know what that is: it’s a way of hiding youractual IP address on the internet. So, it’s pretty much impossible for us to tell where thisperson actually is or anything about this. So, it’s a completely anonymous person whosigned up with the User Name ‘000000.’ It doesn’t get more anonymous than that. Thatperson puts up a picture of O’Hare Airport under a cloud cover that seems to perfectlymatch a description of what happened on that fateful day (November 7, 2006). And thereis an object in the sky above the runways and apparently from the angle that the camera isshooting at, real close to being over C-17.Now, we’ve had several fairly high level to extremely high level digital analysts review thisphotograph and the reports have come back that if it’s not genuine and legitimate and it isa hoax, it’s a hoax done at the highest levels of professionalism. However, they can’t writeit off as a hoax. I leave that with you however you want to interpret that.DID YOU HAVE ANY TEXT COMMUNICATION THROUGH THE INTERMEDIARYFROM THE PERSON WHO TOOK THE CELL PHONE IMAGE?None. This was absolutely a hit and run. They came by the website, registered as amember – behind the proxy. Did one post, put the image up and we haven’t heard fromthem since. Obviously we’re pursuing any avenue we can to get back in touch with them,but it’s pretty difficult at this point. I suspect that person might come back to the websitewhen they realize how much attention this has stirred up. And maybe not. If this person islegitimate and they are in fear of their employment, which certainly seems to be the casebased on the testimony we got on the site, heck, they might not come back.THIS IS ESPECIALLY SIGNIFICANT IN THE CONTEXT OF JON HILKEVITCH, THECOLUMNIST AT THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE WHO WAS ON CNN AND ALL THENEWS PROGRAMS TALKING ABOUT THE STORY THAT HE ESSENTIALLY"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"BROKE – THAT HE KNEW THERE WERE PHOTOGRAPHS. HE’S BEEN ONVACATION AND THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE SAYS THEY HAVE NOT RECEIVEDPHOTOS YET. BUT IT WAS JON HILKEVITCH HIMSELF WHO STATED: ‘THEREARE PHOTOGRAPHS.’That’s the way I understand it as well. As a matter of fact, I understood that one ofHilkevitch’s witnesses had made the statement that there was a taxiing (airline) pilot whohad a cell phone in the cockpit and shot a picture of this thing.One of the other interesting aspects of the photograph that appeared on our site is some ofmy experts have come back to me and said: ‘You know, the elevation and level thiscamera would have been at and slight distortion around the edges, really could lend itselfto being taken from the cockpit of an aircraft. I find that really interesting because thedistortion around the edges does appear to be kind of a convex bend. We know that a cellphone camera is flat. We know the passenger windows typically on an airliner are flat. Thecockpit windows on certain models of aircraft do have curves to them. So, we have oneguy who is speculating – again, pure speculation – that there is a greater than zero chancethat if this image is legitimate, then it really was taken by someone kind of leaning forwardin the cockpit of an aircraft, holding his arm out, and pushing the Take Picture button on acell phone. That adds to the intrigue of this in my mind dramatically.The experts I’ve talked to and who have examined this first image have assured me that ifit is a hoax, it was a really a high level hoax. That just racks my brain to think why wouldanyone spend potentially several thousand dollars paying a person to create a hoax of this? IT DOESN’T MAKE SENSE IN THE CONTEXT OF AT LEAST A DOZENEYEWITNESSE. UNITED AND THE FAA FINALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THATTHERE WERE REPORTS OFFICIALLY FILED ABOUT THE SIGHTING WITHMANAGEMENT.Yes. A theory that has been tossed about is that in several cases throughout the last ten orfifteen years, I’ve been told that there have been many incidents where a pre-emptivestrike, if you will, has gone down to where there’s a fairly well-documented, fairly highwitness count event, and as the dust is settling and the evidence is coming together,someone will put out a fairly elaborate hoax directly tied to that incident that looks reallygood, but damn! could cause a little doubt and kind of keep it in that grey fenced area towhich the skeptics and people who are closed minded to this possibility will write thewhole story off.Then five to fifteen days later, a piece of evidence will appear that there is really no doubtabout, or very little doubt. But everybody has kind of blown the whole thing off and it’skind of meaningless.IT’S CALLED CALCULATED GOVERNMENT MISINFORMATION.Yes! That is the angle I am personally pursuing at a fairly fast pace and at high levels, if Ican. I am really astounded that if there is manipulation going on and deflection andmisinformation going on and it’s purely to save the public relations reputation of an airline(United), that disheartens me, to put it mildly. I would really like to find out.\" n Friday, January 26, 2007, Mark called to talk about the odd cropping of the second"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"image. The electronic graphics experts told Mark that the image had been altered onJanuary 25th, the day the image arrived in the AboveTopSecret.com office. But theeducated speculation was that the alteration was to crop out the lower part of the image.There were no manipulation artifacts in or around the disc in the image. Perhaps, Marksaid, the photographer's reflection was in the window and he wanted it cropped out topreserve his anonymity.Mark Allin: \"We haven't been able to plot on a map yet where Shooter 1 was comparedto Shooter 2. It appears as if they were on opposite sides of O'Hare Airport, but we haven'tconfirmed that yet.THE TWO IMAGES OF THE EGG-SHAPED AERIAL OBJECT LOOK REMARKABLYSIMILAR.We agree with that. The other important part of this is that the experts we are dealing with- David Biedny and Jeff Ritzmann. Mr. Biedny was author of the first How-To manual forPhotoshop. This guy is absolutely top level digital image analyst.[ Editor's Note: Biedny is a longtime author and editor in the world oftechnology publications, having served as one of the founding editors ofMacUser magazine in the earliest days of the Macintosh computer, and hisreviews, tutorials and opinion columns have appeared in a wide range ofpublications including New Media, MacWorld, The Macromedia User Journal,Morph’s Outpost, Details, ID and others.He is currently a Contributing Editor for MacAddict magazine. Biednycoauthored The Official Adobe Photoshop Handbook (Bantam), the firstPhotoshop book ever published, and also coauthored Photoshop ChannelChops (New Riders), which has recently become the most valued collectiblebook in the world of technical trade publishing.At Industrial Light and Magic (ILM), he created digital special effects formovies including Memoirs of an Invisible Man, Terminator 2: Judgement Day,The Rocketeer and Hook.Biedny was IDIG, Inc. Effects Supervisor for the motion picture Spawn, anddirected the production of 35 digital effects shots in 35 days. His popular TheDavid Biedny Zone segment can be heard on Gene Steinberg’s Tech NightOwl internet radio show. ]When they break it down to the various channels - in digital imagery you have severalchannels of data, several channels of color. These guys have software that can break theseimages down to one channel and they can look at it literally one channel at a time. It'salmost like you could slice the layers away from the picture and you could just see thatcertain things are going to show up in this channel naturally. Certain things should notshow up in the channels naturally. When things do show up in the channel when theyshould not, then they know something is up.IT'S THE ABSENCE OF ARTIFACTS THAT CONVINCES THEM THAT THESEIMAGES ARE FOR REAL.Yes, exactly. The absence of artifacts, the absence of obvious edit points, the absence oftypical hoaxer manipulations of images. And it's the inclusion of things you would expectto see of something in the atmosphere. You would expect in certain channels - you cankind of see interaction with the atmosphere. They are there.We hope that either one of these shooters have more images. This latest one – he certainlyhas the gear, he’s got the camera in his phone. It’s a high quality camera. I completelyunderstand how somebody sees something in the sky like that – you’re not going to stopand stay calm and go: ‘Let me line this up just right.’ The adrenalin is going to be pumpingand you’re going to grab your phone and Wow! Bam!"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"I would think, though, that you would also keep shooting until the thing went away. So youwould have several images of it. One possibility is that he caught it right before it blinkedout and blew a hole through the clouds. Or, the possibility still stands that he’s got severalmore images. Like I said, we haven’t heard back from him.AND I KEEP HOPING THAT THERE IS SOMEBODY WHO TOOK A HOLE IN THECLOUDS.Yeah, that would be the one! Wouldn’t it? That would be the one I would love to see.” The Chicago O'Hare sighting raises a question about the hole-punch cloud phenomenonreported and photographed occasionally. Are the cloud holes produced by rapidly movingdiscs from another world? Mysterious cloud holes. Le ft: Stavely, Alberta, Canada.Middle : Derbyshire, England. Right: Nashville, Tennessee.January 12, 2004, hole punch cloud over Mobile, Alabama.Image © 2004 by Joel Knain.NASA reported about the Alabama hole punch cloud: \"Such a hole, likely hundreds ofmeters across, was photographed from a driveway near Mobile, Alabama. Very unusual tosee, hole-punch clouds like this are still the topic of meteorological speculation. A leadinghypothesis holds that the hole-punch cloud is caused by falling ice-crystals. Theice-crystals could originate in a higher cloud or be facilitated by a passing airplane exhaust.If the air has just the right temperature and moisture content, the falling crystals willabsorb water from the air and grow. For this to happen, the water must be so cold that all itneeds is a surface to freeze on. The moisture lost from the air increases the evaporationrate from the cloud water droplets so they dissipate to form the hole. The now heavier ice"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"crystals continue to fall and form the more tenuous wispy cloud-like virga seen inside andjust below the hole. Water and ice from the virga evaporates before they reach theground.\" CAN YOU EXPLAIN FOR THE GENERAL AUDIENCE, HOW THEY CAN SUBMITVIDEOS AND PHOTOS TO AboveTopSecret.com?Absolutely. If you have anything relative to this incident, all you need to do is type in: www.abovetopsecret.com in your web browser. The website will load up and there’s abutton on the bottom or top that says, ‘Contact ATS.’ If you’ll push that button, itautomatically emails myself and my two partners and inform us whatever you want toshare with our group. I will make sure that it gets put up immediately.If you would rather do it anonymously, then you can go to the site. We’ve got very easy tofollow and easy to ride guidebook that will give specific instructions about how to postwhatever it is you have: pictures, video, whatever it is. You can do that and we won’t trackyou, trace you, or anything else.HOW MANY SUBMISSIONS DO YOU GET A MONTH?Of really important things – not thousands. But in general, in an average month, we’ll getthousands of anonymous-style posts. But in actual submissions of actual documents orevidence, that would be – of really credible stuff – that would be in the tens, twenties,thirties per month.Stuff that’s not really so credible, in the hundreds. And then I’d say, just total anonymousthings would be in the thousands per month.WAS IT ATS THAT BROKE THE STORY WITH THE CELL PHONE VIDEO OFSADDAM HUSSEIN’S HANGING?I’m not sure if we broke it or not. I know we were real close, if it wasn’t us. But I can’thonestly answer that. I don’t want to speculate. I know we had a fairly big thread aboutthat.THE REASON I BRING IT UP IS: AGAIN, IT WAS SOMEBODY FORWARDING TOME AN ATS LINK AND IT’S WHERE I SAW THE ENTIRE FALLING THROUGH THETRAP DOOR. I WONDERED WHAT THE PROCESS WAS GETTING THAT TAPE TOYOU?Yeah, that’s nothing more than putting a link up. Someone can load a videotape to one ofthe hundreds of YouTube, ImageShack. There’s all kinds of venues out there to which youcan pretty anonymously upload video images, audio, whatever you want. You can do it atour site, too, if you want. At that point, you get a link to the movie or audio or image andsimply come on to AboveTopSecret.com and register as an anonymous member and createa thread and type the link in, using URL tags, which are very self-explanatory and easy todo. Hit Submit or Post, and it’s there!If someone doesn’t care about being anonymous, they can actually load the video itselfinto a post through the embedded video option. That means when you pull that post orthread up – the submission that the person made – the video will just start playing. Thenyou wouldn’t even have to click another link and go to another site to view it."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"IN TERMS OF THIS CONTEXT OF PLACING VIDEOTAPES AND IMAGES ANDAUDIOTAPES THAT MIGHT HAVE SOME POLITICAL SENSITIVITY FOR THEGOVERNMENT, SO FAR ARE YOU AWARE OF ANYBODY HAVING ANY SERIOUSNEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FROM POSTING ANYTHING AT YOUR WEBSITE?That’s a yes and no question. We have certainly been contacted by certain governmentagencies over pretty mundane stuff, really. But there was one instance where we had amember post the direct phone lines to several NSA (National Security Agency)not-obvious operators. Within 30 minutes, we were contacted by telephone, interestinglyenough, since the number was unlisted, by a manager at NSA and asked very politely andin a very non-threatening way to remove the phone numbers – which we did. We looked atthe situation and there really wasn’t any value to having these poor peoples’ phonenumbers splattered all over the internet. At that point, the member who did it was actuallya French national in France. There really wasn’t a heck of a lot anyone could do to thatperson.We’ve had a couple of other instances where members have told us they got an interestingemail because of something they posted. I kind of find that hard to believe because Iwould think we would have gotten the email, too. Really that has not happened to anygreat degree.WHAT YOU LEARNED IN YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE FRENCH POSTING ISTHAT THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY HAD NO TROUBLE IN GETTINGYOUR PRIVATE PHONE NUMBER CONTACT.Yes! (laughs) Which doesn’t surprise me at all.IS IT BECAUSE THEY ARE KEEPIING INTIMATE TRACK OF WHAT’S GOING ONAT ABOVETOPSECRET.COM AND SOME OF THE WEBSITES THAT AREDEALING WITH THE SUBJECTS THEY KEEP DENYING – BUT ARE REAL?I would have to think that they would be remiss in their duties if they were NOT. I can tellyou that every moth we have pretty much across the board representation from theintelligence and military agencies – their IP addresses on our server. Pretty much everymonth everybody has come by and taken a look.SO THE GOVERNMENT IS MONITORING ABOVE TOP SECRET.I don’t know if I would call it monitoring, but I don’t know what else I’d call it, so I guessthat’s a fair statement.Again, if I was an intelligence officer and I wanted to keep a pulse of what was going on –the internet is certainly a good place to do that. That’s why we have the anonymousabilities on the website. Literally, you can come to AboveTopSecret.com and postsomething and there is absolutely nothing – they (government) could hang us by ourfingernails and we still couldn’t tell them who you were. There’s no way they can find outwho you were either.Well, I say that. I’m guessing there isn’t because I don’t know what I don’t know as far astechnology they have. But it hasn’t happened yet, anyway.”More Information:If viewers have more information about the November 7, 2007, Chicago O'Hare Airporthovering disc over concourse C-17, please email me: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.For further information about aerial discs and other intelligences, please see reports belowin the Earthfiles Archives and my books, An Alien Harvest and the 2-volume Glimpses ofOther Realities, in the Earthfiles Shop.• 01/02/2007 -- Grey Aerial Disk Reported by Chicago O'Hare United Airlines Pilots and Mechanics"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"• 06/22/2006 -- Horse Suspended in Mid-Air Near Milan, Italy, Apartment• 11/24/2006 -- Scientific Data Supports Mutilated Montana Cow Dropped from Sky and Bounced• 10/19/2006 -- Another Cattle Mutilation in Pondera County, Montana• 10/02/2006 -- Unusual Deaths of Six Female Goats in White Salmon, Washington• 09/20/2006 -- Animal Mutilations Increase Again in Argentina• 09/20/2006 -- Updated: Three Sets of Concentric Rings in South Texas Field• 08/23/2006 -- More Cat and Dog Mutilations• 07/01/2006 -- Cattle Mutilation and Glowing Discs in Saskatchewan, Canada• 06/29/2006 -- Another Horse Suspended in the Air• 06/28/2006 -- Half Cats in Destin, Florida, and Beheaded Animals in Rochester, N.
