Its disintegration was the third, suddencollapse of an Antarctic ice shelf, following the collapses of the 425-square-mileWilkins Ice Shelf in 1998 and the 618-square-mile Larsen AIce Shelf in 1995.

This is supposed to be a consensusfrom scientists and computer labs around the world about where global climate change isheaded."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science BasisProjected globally averaged surface warming and sea level rise in fractions of meters by 2100.Page 11 of 21, Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change, \"Climate Change 2007:The Physical Science Basis,\" Summary for Policymakers.This report says it is “ very likely” (90% likelihood) that increasing carbon dioxide iscaused by human activity. The report also acknowledges that there has been an increase instronger storms in various parts of the world – and specifically, storms in North and SouthAmerica are linked to global warming.How high does the IPCC now think the average global temperature will rise over the nextninety years? Updated final projections: The official February 2, 2007, public report saysby the year 2100, Earth could warm up in a range of scenarios from 1.8 degrees to 6.4degrees Celsius, which is 3.2 to 11.52 degrees Fahrenheit. That upper 11.52 degrees F. iseven higher than the previous 2001 projection of about 10 degrees F. It means in the worstcase, each coming decade could warm at least one degree Fahrenheit! For comparison, ittook the previous 100 years for the Earth to warm up 1 degree Fahrenheit.And how high will sea levels rise? For reasons that are not clear, the rapidly increasing icemelts of Antarctica and Greenland were left out of the initial draft of the IPCC’s 2007report – allegedly because computer models don’t have current data to accurately accessthe impact. The February 2, 2007 IPCC report projects only a 28 to 43 centimeters (11 to17 inches) rise in sea level.But scientists who have been studying glacier ice melt their entire careers are alarmed atrecent increases in the rate of Greenland and Antarctic ice melt. This week I talked withLonnie Thompson, Ph.D., Distinguished Professor of Geology at the School of EarthSciences and a Research Scientist in the Byrd Polar Research Center at Ohio StateUniversity in Columbus. He thinks the worst case for sea level rise could be five timeshigher than the IPCC’s most conservative estimate.Interviews:Lonnie Thompson, Ph.D., Distinguished Professor of Geology, School of Earth"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Sciences; and Research Scientist, Byrd Polar Research Center, Ohio StateUniversity, Columbus, Ohio: “When you look at those numbers that the IPCC 2007gives for increasing sea level, it’s like 5 inches to something like 23 inches. I think this isvery much understating what we know already. And so I have problems with that.I know a number of scientists around the world that complained about this being aninadequate number, based on what we know. You cannot ignore Greenland and Antarcticawhere we have most of the water stored in ice on land.SO, DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE UNITED NATIONS HAS COME UNDER SOMEPOLITICAL PRESSURE TO BASICALLY FALSIFY DATA IN WHAT SHOULD BE ASCIENTIFIC REPORT?(laughs) Well, that’s an interesting question. Unfortunately, IPCC is a science document,but also a political document. It has to be signed off by 154 countries, including the UnitedStates and oil-producing countries and so it tends to be conservative from that perspective.But I think on top of this is a lot of uncertainty about our knowledge of how these big icesheets are actually going to respond to increased warming.But what we do know is that over periods where we have observations and we now havesatellite observations of these ice sheets that show changes due to the current climate aredramatic. There are quite likely to be some surprises as we go forward in an unfamiliarclimate.WHAT DO YOU THINK IS A FAIR ESTIMATE ABOUT WHAT THE SEA LEVEL RISEWILL BE BY 2100?The thing I’ve been surprised by having spent my life and last 30 years on some 51expeditions around the world is just how fast ice can respond to climate change. I think wehave really under estimated the rates at which ice can disappear on land. When itdisappears, that’s frozen water that makes its way to the rivers and into the oceans of theworld and leads to global sea level rise. Sea Level Rise Over Next 90 YearsCould Be 55 InchesIF YOU WERE MAKING AN EDUCATED GUESS, WHAT DO YOU THINK A FAIRESTIMATE OF SEA LEVEL RISE WOULD BE IN THE NEXT 90 YEARS?I find it more reasonable to look at numbers like in the order of 30 to 40 inches of sea levelrise. We have to be prepared for more extreme changes because of the uncertainty and thesurprises we’ve seen in the last five years in how fast ice can disintegrate.WHAT DO YOU PERSONALLY THINK IS THE WORST CASE FOR THIS CENTURYIN TERMS OF SEA LEVEL RISE?I think the worst case for sea level rise by the end of this century is up around 55 inches. Ithink that’s a possibility.IF IT REACHES 55 INCHES, HOW MUCH OF FLORIDA WOULD BE GONE?Well, we would looking at about one-third of Florida disappearing (under water).A THIRD OF FLORIDA AND HOW MUCH OF THE GULF COAST?That’s exactly what we are working on. I don’t have those numbers, but it would besignificant. Of course, all that infrastructure - even places like New York City. Thepotential cost and impact of that kind of sea level rise is tremendous.IT WOULD MEAN THAT NEW ORLEANS IS NOT AT ALL A PLACE THAT WOULDSURVIVE ?Exactly. In fact – these are why the projections are so important. Right now, we’reinvesting a lot of resources in rebuilding in New Orleans. The question is whether that’smoney well spent?IF WE’RE HEADED FOR A 55-INCH RISE WORST CASE – WHEN WOULD NEWORLEANS, FLORIDA AND THE GULF COAST KNOW IT WAS NO LONGERPOSSIBLE TO HAVE REAL ESTATE ALONG THE CURRENT COASTLINES?I think they are already realizing in the really low areas like the Everglades. You’re right atsea level. The salt incursions that have been coming – and if you get an inch rise in sea"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"level, you will displace the vegetation and animals a mile inland in those areas because youare right at sea level.FOR EVERY INCH OF SEA LEVEL RISE, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A MILE OFINCURSION OF OCEAN WATER INLAND?Yes. That affects the types of vegetation. When you look at the ecosystems, you go all theway from the salt-adapted vegetation along the coast to the fresh water vegetation as yougo further into the Everglades. Those boundaries will shift as sea level rises.WHEN YOU SAY IT MIGHT, AT WORST CASE, BE FIFTY-FIVE INCHES BY THEEND OF THIS CENTURY, THOSE FIFTY-FIVE INCHES WOULD THEN TRANSLATEINTO 55 MILES INLAND?That’s pretty much correct, yes, fifty-five inches could displace 55 miles inland. And howfar it goes, depends on the topography, the elevations that you are looking at. But thechange could be tremendous.THAT’S WHY AT LEAST ONE-THIRD OF FLORIDA’S COAST COULD BE GONEAND MIAMI WOULD BE UNDER WATER?Exactly.\"The above map from a computer model shows how much of the Florida coastlinewould be under water with a 2 meter sea level rise (6.5 feet). Image created by JonathanOverpeck and Jeremy Weiss, courtesy University of Arizona Departmentof Geosciences Environmental Studies Laboratory. Carbon Dioxide Could Reach 800 ppmv By 2100Today in 2007, the measured amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere is 381parts per million volume (ppmv). The last time it was at this level was between a million to20 million years ago. But long before that nearly 300 million years ago in the LatePaleozoic, CO2 levels rose to 1,000 parts per million and higher. That’s when ice meltedall over the planet. Then the CO2 levels went back down. Earth’s CO2 levels have beenlike a yo-yo, going up and down for millennia.Scientists have learned that when CO2 levels fall, the Earth cools down and there havebeen many mini-ice ages. When CO2 levels rise, the Earth warms up, the ice melts and sealevels rise. Late Paleozoic Research Indicates CO2 Can Yo-Yo,Causing Very Erratic Global ClimateOne scientist who recently studied geological evidence from the Late Paleozoic era (305million to 265 million years ago) reports that as CO2 levels increased from around the 381parts per million volume that Earth has now in 2007 upward to 1,000 ppmv and higher, the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"world climate was highly erratic and very stormy. She is Isabel Montanez, Ph.D., Professorof Geology at the University of California-Davis. She and other researchers are concernedthat since computer models indicate CO2 levels are now expected to double to around 800ppm over the next 90 years, will the whole planet be challenged by increasingly erraticweather? If so, how many coastline populations will have to move? And how much Earthlife will be forced into extinction?[ Editor's Note: The Paleozoic era lasted from about 540 to 250 million yearsago, and is divided into six periods. The 320-odd million years of thePaleozoic era saw many important events, including the development of mostinvertebrate groups, life's conquest of land, the evolution of fish, reptiles,insects, and vascular plants, the formation of the supercontinent of Pangea,and no less than two distinct ice ages. The Late Paleozoic also had an icyperiod that moved to intense global warming and was associated with CO2levels that exceeded 1,000 ppmv. The earth rotated faster than it does today,so days were shorter. The moon was also closer, which produced strongertides. During the middle and late Paleozoic (Devonian to Permian), about athird of the Gondwanan land mass (no continents then) was torn into smallpieces and moved rapidly to equatorial regions.]Interview:Isabel Montanez, Ph.D., Prof. of Geology, University of California - Davis,Department of Geology, Davis, California: \"Various other studies and mine are allpointing at the same message: climate change does not come gradually. It comes with veryerratic behavior.We chose a period of time from about 300 million to 260 million years ago because it wasthe last time that the Earth had conditions very much like today. It was a time period thathad ice at the poles, big continental ice sheets like we do. And it was a time period thathad very low atmospheric greenhouse CO2 like we do today. It was also a time periodwhen the Earth went to a completely different state where there was no ice. The icecompletely melted and there were significantly higher levels of CO2. So, we were reallyinterested in how that transition was made and what impact it had on climate and on Earthlife. Ancient Climate Was A Yo-Yo of CO2What we found was that the transition was very strongly linked to the amount of CO2 inthe atmosphere. I don’t think anyone disputes anymore that rising CO2 means warmertemperatures and changing climate. My study shows there is a direct link between CO2levels and ancient global warming and cooling.But rather than a gradual progression, CO2 went up and down and there was a muchgreater instability of climate. Temperatures on Earth and in the oceans also went up anddown by several degrees. All the other climate behavior – the amount of rainfall, dry ornot dry, windy – all those indicators also alternated very erratically. What this told us isthat major climate transitions in the past have been associated with very unstable climatebehavior. Late Paleozoic and Earth Today -Both 381 ppmv Carbon Dioxide;Late Paleozoic Increased to Over 1,000 ppmv CO2Now, for the future, the thing I think is important about the time period we studied is thatthe natural changes in CO2 from levels very much like today (381 ppmv) like we live intoday to levels of more than 1,000 ppmv or 2,000 ppmv. I don’t know if we will go tothose levels quite, but if we were to exhaust our fossil fuels, we could easily go to 1,000ppmv, if not 2,000 ppmv.These changes when we were looking at them happened over a long time period, 40million years. It took literally hundreds of thousands of years and millions of years forchanges to happen. But today, we’re looking at predicting levels of CO2 at about 500ppmv by mid-century even; certainly by the end of the century when they could be evenhigher."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Burning Fossil Fuels Increases CO2 More RapidlyThere are those who say if we burn through our fossil fuels more aggressively or at thesame rate as now, we’re going to reach 1,000 ppmv. But this is all happening at a muchfaster time period than in the past. This is happening in decades, a century, or century anda half.The parallel between the ancient climate, now and our future is that we see such unstableclimate in the past whenever CO2 goes up dramatically. So, we should expect that climateand life on Earth is going to respond just as erratically as CO2 continues to go up, but at amuch faster rate than what we studied. That’s what the big uncertainty is. We really don’tknow how to predict that. We don’t know how to model and predict future change when itcan be erratic. Paleozoic CO2 Rise: Volcanoes?WHAT CAUSED THE CO2 TO RISE IN THE 40 MILLION YEARS THAT YOUSTUDIED?That is the million dollar question. The best guess is that there was a natural increase involcanic activity, quite a bit of it. Part of the reason was that the continents were allcolliding into one another. So that was certainly a source to cause CO2 to go up. That’sprobably a pretty good connection there. Why Did Paleozoic CO2 Yo-Yo?What is not clear is why did it yo-yo? Why did it come back down and then go back upand yo-yo? It probably had a lot to do with tropical rainforests in the equatorial regions –really much larger than today’s rainforests. They probably did a good job of sweeping outa lot of the CO2 in the atmosphere, but clearly could not keep up with it. That might be thereason why things did yo-yo so much until eventually CO2 took over and got high andstayed high.IF CO2 DID A YO-YO THEN, WHAT WAS THE WORST CASE OF ERRATICWEATHER BEHAVIOR? WHAT MIGHT BE AHEAD FOR US NOW IN THISCOMPRESSED TIME OF 90 YEARS?Exactly. Two things I would say. From my study there might be a direct parallel, because itseems like that window of 1,000 ppmv is what we might call a threshold. Ice might bestable below that level, but in our records when we hit 1,000 ppmv – whether CO2 wasgoing up or down – that seems to be the stability point for the ice sheets to come back orto melt.The other time period is when we actually developed our ice on Earth in the last 34 millionyears. That’s when we got Antarctica and then the northern hemisphere ice. If that 1,000ppmv window is real, then it’s pretty scary. We could approach that.We see temperature changes in the tropical oceans of 4 to 7 degrees Celsius. In the past ona short time scale, they too have seen changes of about 3 to 5 degrees Celsius change inthe tropical oceans as well (warmer). That leads to a whole domino effect when you startto change the ocean temperatures so much. Rapid Climate Change Causes Plantand Animal ExtinctionsLOTS OF EXTINCTIONS?Yeah, ultimately it can. No doubt about that. We see it in our records with the plants. Butat first, what it does is if you change the temperatures of the oceans, you change the oceancirculation patterns. When you change the circulation, you also change the way the waterinteracts with the atmosphere. Ultimately, that also changes weather and climate, there canbe much more storminess and increased temperatures in the air because the oceans arereleasing their heat and even more sources of greenhouse gas. There can be acceleratedwarming even."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"But when the circulation of the ocean changes, so does the climate – especially in placeslike northern Europe and Great Britain and Canada. They can really get cool quickly andkind of oscillate between very cold and very warm again. Anything that lives in thoseregions and can’t migrate at the rate to keep pace with the climate change? They have onlyone choice: extinction.WHAT IS THE WORST CASE THAT COMES OUT OF YOUR RESEARCH IN TERMSOF HOW BAD THE WIND COULD BECOME, HURRICANES, TORRENTIAL RAINS?HOW BAD COULD IT BECOME IN JUST THE NEXT NINETY YEARS?One of the things we see is when we reach periods of 1,000 ppmv carbon dioxide, themonsoon type climate intensifies dramatically. That’s because at the Paleozoic time therewas a huge monsoon system, very much like those in Southeast Asia now – but muchbigger scale. What that means is storminess. No doubt, when we hit that threshold whenwe start to lose some of the ice caps, it changes atmospheric circulation enough and makesthe exposed continents much more capable of warming the atmosphere and you getincreased storminess. No question about that. Last Time Earth Had 382 ppmv Carbon Dioxide Level:Between 1 to 20 Million Years AgoThe 382 ppmv of CO2 that we have now are higher than we have seen in the last 20million years. For certain, higher than we’ve seen in the last 600,000 years. So, already weare outside of the norm of basic stability of this planet. And with that increase beyond thenorm, we’ve seen already a little warming – a half degree Celsius (1 degree F. in 20thCentury). But we also know that those levels are going up. There is nothing we can do tostop it rising to at least 500 ppmv.And if we do nothing to contain our energy uses, we’ll probably go to a doubling up tomaybe 1,000 ppmv. We fully expect that with the increase in CO2, there is a parallelincrease in warming – much more than the half degree Celsius we’ve already seen. Withthis warming is the ice issue: the instability of the ice. A Very Different Earth in 2100?Where Will All Coastal Refugees Go?BASED ON EVERYTHING YOU KNOW SO FAR, IF YOU WERE GOING TO MAKEAN EDUCATED VISUAL PICTURE FOR THE MODERN WORLD ABOUT WHATTHE EARTH WILL LOOK LIKE IN ANOTHER 90 YEARS, WHAT WOULD YOUTHINK?I think about that a lot, actually. I have two kids. But also academically and as a human insociety. I think going to a seasonally ice-free Arctic is very reasonable. I think that’s goingto happen. I don’t think we are going to escape that. That will inevitably affect oceancirculation. That means much of northern Europe and Great Britain are going to live theway they are living now. They won’t be able to. They will have very erratic, very stormyweather. That population will need to survive somewhere else and likely will demandmigration to more southern locals.Areas like the equatorial regions of the tropics and sub-tropics in developing countries likeAfrica, they will probably see much more drought. So, they, too will need to findalternative locations to grow their products and to live, as well as the Middle East. I thinkwe will see places like India and Bangladesh, low lying areas that will see increasedstorminess. They will also have to deal with increased flooding and disasters ofmega-monsoons.So, the bottom line to me is: Where are we going to put as many people as we alreadyhave, plus the increasing population, in that much less inhabitable land on Earth? Spread of Insects, Weeds and DiseasesThen there are issues like diseases. A lot of species will go extinct because they can’tmigrate fast enough. But those who do migrate are usually insects because they can. Thatmeans disease-bearing insects such as malaria by mosquitoes. I think it could be potentiallyeconomically devastating."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" North American Climate: \"More Katrinas\"and More DroughtWHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE UNITED STATES ANDCANADIAN CLIMATE?The United States is strongly impacted. Mid latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere aregoing to see changes. But it changes by regions. For example, for us in California, weworry a lot about water resources as does the whole southwest because here in California,in particular, we are so dependent on snow pack. We move water around so much, so weimpact a lot of people. We’ll see more droughts probably, as will the southwest.I think for the mid-continent where we grow – the Bread Basket – they are predicted tohave lower soil moisture, more drought, certainly earlier growing seasons and later frosts.But that in itself can have a bad impact.The East Coast might become wetter and stormier, but warmer. Milder winters, which isn’talways a good thing because of how earth life is adapted.Then clearly the Gulf and southern Atlantic region of the U. S. is an issue because ofhurricanes. Hurricane seasons will be longer-lived and probably much more intense.When we do have hurricanes, the idea that they could be Class 5 with 200 mph winds isvery feasible and they could be more frequent.MORE KATRINAS?Oh, more Katrinas. The modeling predicts there should be more Katrinas. Worst Case by 2100?Definitely sea surface temperatures in the tropics can change. That’s important in that wedid not think that was the case. We thought the tropics were pretty buffered – that that wasa part of the Earth which remained stable. It’s not so stable. It can get warmer by morethan we thought. That’s not good because when that happens, a whole lot of other thingshappen in response and hurricanes happen more often. The circulation of the oceanchanges.The other thing is that we looked at the vegetation in the tropics. There were remarkablylarge migrations of rainforest-type plants – the ones that would normally live in ourtropical regions today. They like it wet and warm. They migrated very far distances. Wedon’t know how much, but minimally tens to hundreds of kilometers. In their place, whenglobal warming came on and the ice disappeared and CO2 went up, in their place came theopportunists from the dry land plants. Those were the conifers and ancient pines, but todayare shrub lands and weeds. These are opportunists and can live in very severe climate. Butwe don’t live off of them and they don’t do the beneficial things that the rainforest can do. Could Rainforests Die Out?Another thing the rainforests do that very few people appreciate is that the tropics is thesink for a lot of atmospheric CO2. The lush vegetation takes out quite a lot of CO2 fromthe atmosphere. If you don’t have that photosynthesis going on, there’s that much moreCO2 you keep in the atmosphere.IF I HAVE UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY, 90 YEARS FROM NOW IF THE CO2CONTINUES TO RISE ALONG WITH THE AVERAGE GLOBAL TEMPERATURE,THE GIGANTIC EQUATORIAL RAINFORESTS MIGHT EVEN BE DEAD?Very possible. I have actually said to my colleagues when I wonder what will my kids bethinking when they are grandparents. I don’t know that they will have rainforests. I thinkthe tropics will look very different, in part to accommodate all the people who will have tomove to different areas. But also because I don’t think the rainforests will survive thiscoming change.\""},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Small tributary of Amazon River, Brazil.
