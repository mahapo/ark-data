National Park Service Fisheries Biologist, Jeff Miller,monitoring decline of coral in Virgin Islands National Park.Image by Caroline Rogers, Ph.D., USGS.December 13, 2007 Palo Alto, California - The 2007 United Nations Climate ChangeSummit was held in Bali, Indonesia, from December 3 to December 14, 2007. Delegatesfrom 187 nations tried to come up with a globally acceptable agreement to cut backgreenhouse gas emissions to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012.The United States – one of the biggest CO2 emitters on Earth - refused to accept languagein a draft document that proposed industrialized nations consider cutting emissions by 25%- 40% over the next twelve years. The European Union favors the text, but the U. S.,Canada and Japan argued the proposal is too limiting. Angered and frustrated by theAmerican position, European Union leaders threatened not to show up at the BushAdministration's global warming conference in Hawaii planned for January 2008.Nobel Peace Prize winner and speaker, Al Gore, acknowledged before the Bali delegatesthat America was the biggest stumbling block to a new global commitment to reducegreenhouse gas emissions. Sadly, of the nations that did ratify the 1997 Kyoto Protocol,nearly half failed to meet their CO2 reduction targets.The two-week-long Bali conference would have concluded without any global concensusto curtail greenhouse emissions, but delegates stayed up all night after the conference wassupposed to have ended Friday, December 14, and proposed two compromises. Finally,the United States said, “We will go forward and join consensus.” Earlier boos against theAmerican delegation then turned to cheers.The final draft for a “road map” of global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissionsdropped explicit mandatory reduction goals of 25% - 40%, which the Bush Administrationresisted.

Earth Continues to Warm Upin Greenhouse Gas BlanketMeanwhile, the Earth continues to heat up. The National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration’s Climatic Data Center in Asheville, North Carolina, reports that theaverage global surface temperature for 2007 is expected to be the fifth warmest sincerecords began more than a century ago. 2007 will also be the 8th warmest year on recordin the United States.Seven of the eight warmest years globally on record have occurred since 2001 - and the 10warmest years have all occurred since 1997.Since 1976, the global average surface temperature rate of increase has beenapproximately three times faster than the previous century."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"2007 Arctic Record-Breaking Melt DownThe greatest warming has taken place in high latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.In 2007, the Greenland ice sheet melted nearly 19 billion tons more than ever before. Andby the end of summer, the Arctic Sea had another record melt down. NASA climatescientist, Jay Zwally, said this week: “At this rate, the Arctic Ocean could be nearlyice-free at the end of the 2012 summer, much faster than previous predictions.”Envisat ASAR satellite image of the McClure Straitin the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, acquired on August 31, 2007.The McClure Strait is the most direct route of the Northwest Passage and has beenfully open since early August 2007. The dark gray color represents the ice-freeareas while turquoise represents areas with sea ice. Image by ESA.August 2007, Arctic Ocean, open water and ice seen froman icebreaker research vessel. Image by Andy Armstrong, NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).Climate scientists everywhere were surprised by the rate of Arctic sea ice melt in 2007.The Associated Press summarized the record-shattering Arctic and Greenland melt downsthis way:- More surface ice melted in Greenland than ever before, 12% more than theprevious worst year of 2005.- 552 billion tons of ice melted, according to satellite data –and that’s 15%more than the annual average Arctic summer melts have been.- Arctic sea ice melted away to nearly 23% below the previous record melt,opening up the Northwest Passage to ships. That forced 6,000 walruses tocome ashore in northwest Alaska in October for the first time in recordedhistory.- The remaining Arctic sea ice was also the thinnest on record. Combining theshrinking sea ice with such thin ice means the overall volume of Arctic sea icewas only HALF of what it was only three years ago in 2004!- Alaska’s frozen permafrost is warming up also – All the way down 66 feet,the soil heated up about half a degree between 2006 and 2007. As permafrostwarms and melts, methane will be released into the atmosphere, adding to thegreenhouse blanket around the Earth.NASA scientist Jay Zwally says, “It’s getting even worse than the modelspredicted.”"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Carbonic Acid Build Up in OceansExpected to Kill Off Coral Reefs by 2050 And now in the December 14, 2007, issue of the journal Science, chemical oceanographersreport that carbon emissions from human activities are not only heating up our planet, butthe ocean chemistry is changing so much that if the CO2 build up continues at the currentrate, by the year 2050, no coral reefs will be alive. That’s only 42 years from now.What’s happening between the oceans and the increasing CO2? About one-third of thecarbon dioxide that goes into the Earth’s atmosphere is absorbed by the oceans. Theabsorbed CO2 produces carbonic acid. Unfortunately, carbonic acid dissolves away theskeletons of planktons, shellfish and coral reefs. Why? Because the skeletons are madefrom carbonate minerals such as aragonite in seawater that are being greatly reduced bythe increasing CO2 production of carbonic acid.[ Editor’s Note: Aragonite CaCO2 crystals are one of the carbonate mineralsin seawater which planktons, shellfish and coral reefs usedto build their skeletons. The problem is that CO2 absorbed inseawater creates carbonic acid which interferes with carbonateneeded to make skeletons for planktons, shellfish and coral reefs.Wikipedia: “Aragonite is a carbonate mineral, one of the two common,naturally occurring polymorphs of calcium carbonate, CaCO3. The other isthe mineral calcite. Aragonite's crystal lattice differs from that of calcite,resulting in a different crystal shape, an orthorhombic system with acicularcrystals. Repeated twinning results in pseudo-hexagonal forms. Aragonite maybe columnar or fibrous, occasionally in branching stalactitic forms calledflos-ferri (\"flowers of iron\") from their association with the ores at theCarthinian iron mines. The locations for aragonite is Molina de Aragón inGuadalajara, Spain, 25 km. from Aragon, and the Ochtinska Aragonite Cavein Slovakia. In the U.S., stalactitic aragonite is in Carlsbad Caverns in southernNew Mexico. Massive deposits of oolitic aragonite are found on the seabed ofthe Bahamas. Aragonite forms naturally in almost all mollusk shells and as thecalcareous endoskeleton of warm and cold water corals. ]In the year 1750, over 98% of coral reefs (reddish-pink dots)grew in optimal conditions with aragonite saturation greater than 3.5 (blues)."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Such water is rapidly disappearing on Earth and will be gone in several decades if currentcarbon dioxide emission trends continue. Atmospheric CO2 levels in 1750 were 280 ppm;in 2007 are 383 ppm; and 550 ppm for 2050. Graphic by Carnegie Institution for Science.Right now, the amount of CO2 in the Earth’s atmosphere is measured at 383 parts permillion volume (ppmv). By the middle of this 21st century, that number could double to766 ppmv. More conservative estimates are 550 ppmv by the year 2050.One of the coral reef research scientists is Ken Caldeira, Ph.D., Chemical Oceanographerat the Carnegie Institution for Science in Stanford University’s Dept. of Global Ecology.He and his colleagues say, “ If atmospheric CO2 stabilizes at 550 ppm – and even thatwould take concerted international effort to achieve – no existing coral reef will remain insuch an environment.”So, even the most conservative estimate for CO2 in the atmosphere by 2050 is still toomuch for coral reefs to survive in the world’s oceans! I talked with Prof. Caldeira thisweek about the latest research and the implications for our future.Interview:Ken Caldeira, Ph.D., Chemical Oceanographer.Ken Caldeira, Ph.D., Staff Scientist and Chemical Oceanographer, CarnegieInstitution for Science, Stanford University’s Department of Global Ecology, PaloAlto, California: “ I think we can expect that coral reefs will not be found on this planetsome time later this century if current greenhouse gas emissions continue.It’s something that has been on this planet for millions of years. For us in a few decades towipe them out is pretty dramatic!Beyond corals, there are a lot of other affected sea life – surface plankton make theirskeletons out of calcium carbonate – so it is really imperative if we are to preserve ourmarine environment that we really have to bring down CO2 emissions very rapidly.ACCORDING TO THE CARNEGIE RELEASE, THE PROJECTION IS THAT BY 2050– WHICH IS ONLY 42 YEARS FROM RIGHT NOW – THAT THE ATMOSPHERICCO2 LEVEL IS PROJECTED TO BE 550 PPM, WHICH IS THE FOCUS OF YOURSTUDY – MEANING THAT IN 42 YEARS THE CONDITION OF THE OCEANSCOULD BE SUCH THAT NO CORAL REEFS COULD SURVIVE?Yes, I think that is correct. The last time that similar conditions were known to haveexisted in the oceans was 65 million years ago after the dinosaurs became extinct. Thenthere was an ocean acidification event and corals and planktons that make their shells outof calcium carbonate disappeared from the geological record. It took about 2 million yearsfor corals to come back and repopulate the coasts of the continents and be common onceagain.So, it’s entirely likely as a result of our policy decisions over the next decades that we willbe affecting the life of the oceans for millions of years to come.Our model suggests that the chemical recovery of the oceans will occur over some tens ofthousands of years, which is plenty long enough. But the biological recovery time scalesseem to be much longer.AND THAT’S PROVIDED THAT HUMANS AND THEIR INDUSTRIALCIVILIZATIONS WOULD PULL BACK ON CO2 AND OTHER GREENHOUSE GASEMISSIONS.Yeah, the doubling of pre-Industrial Revolution CO2 levels to something like 550 ppm,from a climate point of view, some people look at that as a goal and acceptable target. Butfrom the point of view of oceans, that will produce ocean chemical conditions that have"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"not been seen for many tens of millions of years – which is much longer than the averagespecies have been around. So we will be producing ocean chemical conditions that thespecies that now live in the oceans have never experienced. Will the current species beable to adapt to those changes? Maybe. Will they not? We don’t really know howecosystems will respond.But the acidification is getting worse and worse and worse and eventually, even if we doeverything right on the other management practices, the acidification alone will be enoughto kill off the coral reefs. Why Is Modern CO2 Build UpDifferent from Time of Dinosaurs?Iguanodons illustration © by Heinrich Harder.WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO ARGUE THAT 65 MILLION YEARS AGOWHEN THE DINOSAURS WERE HERE, THERE WAS NO ICE AT THE ARCTIC ORANTARCTIC AND THE CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS WERE UP AROUND 1,000PPM?When the dinosaurs were around 65 to 100 million years ago, lots of volcanoes wereputting out carbon dioxide about twice what they are today. But our carbon dioxideemissions from the burning of coal, oil and gas are about 50 times the amount of carbondioxide coming out of volcanoes.If we were only doubling the natural CO2 fluxes, then the chemistry of the ocean would beable to handle it and adapt to it. But when we are putting out CO2 fifty times faster thannatural sources, it overwhelms the ocean’s natural ability to buffer its chemistry. So, weare putting the CO2 in way too fast for the oceans to be able to deal with it.SO THE RAPIDITY OF THIS IS WHAT SEPARATES RIGHT NOW – THE 20TH TOTHE 21ST CENTURIES – FROM 65 MILLION YEARS AGO IN THE TIME OF THEDINOSAURS?Yes, and even if you go back to the ice age. We can all see the figures where the CO2 isgoing up and down with the ice ages. But right now, the rate of increase of carbon dioxidein the atmosphere is about 100 times faster than the increase in CO2 at the end of the lastice age. So the current change in atmospheric CO2 is extremely unusual, even whenviewed from a geological perspective. The argument among geologists is that you have togo back 55 to 65 million years to find a similar event. Worst Case If CO2 Not ReducedTHERE HAVE BEEN 187 DELEGATES AT THE GLOBAL WARMING SUMMIT INBALI DISCUSSING HOW TO CONTROL CARBON DIOXIDE AND OTHERGREENHOUSE EMISSIONS. RIGHT NOW, IT'S CLEAR THAT THE U. S. AND CHINADO NOT WANT TO SIGN PACTS HAVING TO DO WITH RESTRICTING CO2EMISSIONS TO STANDARDS THAT OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD ARE SAYING,'LET'S DO THIS TOGETHER.' IF THE U. S. AND CHINA - THE TWO BIGGESTGREENHOUSE EMITTERS - DO NOT AGREE TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASEMISSIOINS, WHAT DO YOU THINK THE WORST CASE IS FOR THE YEAR 2050,ONLY 42 YEARS FROM NOW?We did a calculation for how fast ecosystems would have to move to keep up with climate"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"change this century and ecosystems would need to move about 30 feet a day just to keepup with the temperature bands as they move towards the poles. Things like oak treescannot move 30 feet a day. Maybe wind born weeds can move at those kinds of rates.What we are doing to this planet is extremely unusual, even when viewed from thegeologic perspective. It’s not like this is the kind of thing that has happened to this planetmany times. What we’re doing now is way outside the bounds of normal chemicalvariability in the oceans.When you change the environment very quickly, you just need one link in that change notbeing able to make it, unable to survive, and then that whole system falls apart.Further nightmare scenarios have to do with collapsing ice sheets and methane beingreleased from permafrost that melts in Siberia. There’s no end to what could possibly gowrong scenarios.AND THIS COULD BE THE LAST GENERATION TO HAVE KNOWN THE EARTHAS IT HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST 5,000 YEARS?Yeah. Or you could even say – coral reefs have been on this planet pretty continuously forthe past 63 million years. Coral reefs have been around for our entire evolutionary history,so for us in the blink of an eye to be destroying what we co-evolved with over so manyyears is really dramatic!AND TRAGIC.And tragic.” Dr. Caldeira and his associates are so concerned about the extinction potential of all theplanet’s coral reefs that this coming summer of 2008, he and a team will be at the GreatBarrier Reef off the northeast coast of Australia to see if they can directly measureongoing carbonic acid damage to the huge coral reef and at what rate the coral willprobably die over the next four to five decades.Beyond coral reef extinctions and the marine life that might die off as a consequence oflosing those “ocean houses,” Dr. Caldeira told me: “I guess my nightmare scenario forhumans is what would happen as climate changes, rainfall patterns shift and the places wenow rely upon for growing food are no longer able to sustain the kind of population wehave on Earth. There is a potential for widespread famine.”More Information:For further reports about global warming and its consequences, see other reports below inthe Earthfiles Archive:• 10/05/2007 — Earlier, Faster and Deeper Arctic Ice Melt Down• 08/08/2007 — 2007's Warm, Erratic Global Weather• 07/11/2007 — Mystery of Night Shining Clouds - Another Global Warming Change?• 06/21/2007 — Large Lake in Southern Chile Has Disappeared• 06/01/2007 — Is Earth Close to Dangerous Tipping Point in Global Warming?• 05/29/2007 — Deadly VHS Fish Virus Has Spread to Lake Michigan• 05/18/2007 — Antarctica: Unprecedented Western Ice Melt and CO2-Saturated Southern Ocean• 02/02/2007 — Updated: New U.
