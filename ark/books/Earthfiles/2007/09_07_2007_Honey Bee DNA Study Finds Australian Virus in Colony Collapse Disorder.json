Soon beekeepers all over the United States werereporting massive disappearances - some losing 90%. By the end of summer 2007, officialsestimated that at least 25% of American honey bee colonies had disappeared and thecause was still unknown.One of the first scientists to be called into study Dave Hackenberg's emergency was DianaCox-Foster, Ph.D., Professor of Entomology at Penn State in University Park,Pennsylvania. Dr. Cox-Foster told me in an Earthfiles interview that she was verysurprised by the number of viruses - some unidentified - she was finding in the honey beebodies given to her to study in what is now called Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Shecontacted W. Ian Lipkin, M.D., Professor of Epidemiology in the Mailman School ofPublic Health, and Director of both the Laboratory for Immunopathogenesis andInfectious Diseases, and the Center for Developmental Neuroscience, at ColumbiaUniversity. He agreed to study the DNA of dead honey bees from four CCD-affectedcolonies and two healthy colonies to see if genome sequencing could find a culprit.That's how they discovered that 96% of the CCD-affected honey bees also had a virusdubbed \"Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV).\" Their research was published for the firsttime on Thursday, September 7, 2007, in Science Express, the online version of thejournal, Science. After the media embargo was lifted late Thursday afternoon, I talkedabout the virus research with Jerry Hayes, Director, Apiary Division, Florida Departmentof Agriculture, and President of the Apiary Inspectors of America.Interview:Jerry Hayes, Chief, Apiary Section, Florida Dept. of Agriculture, and President,Apiary Inspectors of America, Gainesville, Florida: “The Colony Collapse Disorderresearch by our colleagues Diana Cox-Foster, Ph.D., lead author on the Science journalreport released on September 6, 2007, in association with Ian Lipkin, M. D., ColumbiaUniversity, has found a new virus called “Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV)” that is nowcorrelated with Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). It’s an association - not the single cause.THE VIRUS PARALYZES THE HONEY BEES?Yes, after it causes tremors, shaking, and neurological problems. In other countries where"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"this is found – in Israel in particular – the bees crawl out from the colony and tremble andshake and twirl in circles and show signs that are clearly neurological problems. 96.1% of CCD Honey Bees HaveAustralian IAPV VirusWHAT PERCENTAGE OF CCD HONEY BEES HAVE THE IAPV VIRUS?It’s 96.1% correlation. The scientists checked the genetic sequences for bees collectedover the past three years from 30 colonies that suffered Colony Collapse Disordercompared with 21 healthy colonies. There was a 96.1% correlation of the IAPV virus withthe CCD-infected colonies.The virus seems to have come from Australia on packaged bees that were probablyimported into the U. S. without proper oversight. The question is: why doesn’t Australiasuffer from massive amounts of CCD? Does it mean this IAPV virus has evolved with thebees in Australia? Or as the varroa mites, as it feeds on bees, might activate viruses thatare already in the bees, so is the varroa mite activating the virus that is already in the bees?Then you have to add other stressors of chemicals (pesticides) and diet and other things, sothis is still going to be an interplay or mix of many different things, I think. DID THIS VIRUS ORIGINATE FROM ISRAEL? AND HOW OLD ON THE PLANET ISIT?As far as we can tell, it did not originate in Israel, but it was found in 2004 when theIsraelis went through the problems that everyone else had when the parasitic varroa mitewas introduced and they lost all their wild colonies and a high percent age of theirmanaged colonies. So, Israel purchased bees from all over the world and it’s thought that ishow the IAPV virus entered Israel.DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THE ORIGIN OF THE VIRUS IS?It seems to be similar to another honey bee virus called the Kashmir bee virus (northernIndia) which caused neurological disease in bees as well, but this IAPV seems to bedistinct enough that it is either a variant on the Kashmir, or a new species all its own.We’re still trying to figure that out.WHAT TIME PERIOD IN KASHMIR?In the late 1970s.SO BETWEEN THE LATE 1970S AND 2006, THAT VIRUS HAD NOT CAUSEDMASSIVE DISAPPEARANCES LIKE COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER BEFORE?Yes, and I don’t think the IAPV or Kashmir viruses cause Colony Collapse Disorder. Ithink the virus is a component of the disorder, but you have to understand there are a lotof components to CCD and to think this particular IAPV virus is what is causing bees tofly out of the colonies and not come back or disappear is not the case because where thevirus is found active, the bees crawl out of the colony and their are dead bodies all aroundthe colony. So, the IAPV virus is certainly interesting, but I don’t think it’s the smokinggun.It’s important to point out that Australia has not had verroa mites, so this IAPV virus wasexisting for whatever reasons in Australian populations of honey bees and not beingactivated into neurological disease as it has apparently here in the United States.SO, IN THE UNITED STATES, WE’VE HAD INTENSE VARROA MITE INFECTIONS,FOLLOWED BY THE AUSTRALIAN BEES COMING INTO THE UNITED STATESWITH THE ISRAELI PARALYSIS VIRUS AND THAT ONE TWO PUNCH MIGHT BEWHAT HAS WEAKENED NORTH AMERICAN HONEY BEES?I think it’s a 1, 2, 3 and maybe 4 punch because we have a new Nosema ceranae(protozoan) that we’ve talked about before. I’ve had some Israeli colleagues here visiting the U. S. Dept. of Agriculture U. S. the past couple of days and they always find the newstrain of Nosema along with the IAPV virus that has been activated. So, maybe there issome type of synergism between the Nosema (protozoan) and the IAPV virus and thevarroa mites. Then you add on the stress of pesticides and the bee’s immune system isoverwhelmed.IS THERE ANY WAY TO GET RID OF THIS IAPV VIRUS?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"No, humans get viruses and we can take some medicines to slow down virus reproduction.But in insects such as honey bees, it’s almost impossible – there are no virus medications. Embargo To Keep Australian Honey BeesOut of United States and Canada?I think what will be suggested is a temporary embargo on Australian beescoming into the United States.Then, as I’m President of the Apiary Inspectors of America, we’ve been asked toparticipate with the USDA in a sampling survey to see how widespread this virus is? Arethere any honey bee populations out there already that might be resistant to this IAPVvirus that we could selectively breed bees from?WHEN WILL AN EMBARGO AGAINST IMPORTATION OF AUSTRALIAN HONEYBEES BEGIN?I don’t know for certain that it will begin, but I think the bee industry is probably going tocontact the Animal, Plant Inspection Service (APIS) in the U. S. Department ofAgriculture, who will contact the Agriculture Research Service (ARS – USDA) and pushfor the embargo, at least on a temporary basis. We certainly don’t want to hurt the beeindustry in Australia, but we need to have a break (in North America) in re-infection forawhile until we all understand it more clearly.IF YOU WERE GUESSING WHEN AUSTRALIAN HONEY BEES WILL BE KEPTOUT OF NORTH AMERICA, WHEN DO YOU THINK THAT WILL OCCUR?It has to happen sometime between now and October to November because that’s been thetime period in the past couple of years when Australian bees were allowed in and whenthey were shipped in. So, hopefully, if the bee industry decides this is the direction theywant to go, it will be just a matter of weeks.WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HAVING THE EMBARGO PUT IN PLACE?That would be APIS. They would consult with ARS and ARS will give their opinion on thesituation. But in the past, ARS stood up very strongly and said we’ve got too manyproblems and we don’t need bees imported from other countries. Then APIS ignored thatsuggestion.But with everything happening with the data behind what we have now (on the AustralianIAPV virus), APIS will probably listen more closely. North American Honey BeesStill Weak and UnhealthyWE ARE STILL FACING WEAKENED HONEY BEES IN NORTH AMERICACURRENTLY, AREN’T WE?Absolutely.WHAT IS THE CURRENT STATUS IN THE U. S. OF COLONY COLLAPSEDISORDER?Bees will be arriving in Florida for the winter in about 30 days. Last year, the beedisappearances began in October 2006."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Hives of honey bees are loaded on to truck for transport up and down,and between, American coasts as pollinators for hire.We know the North American honey bee health is not getting better. The IAPV virus is afactor, but not the smoking gun answer to Colony Collapse Disorder. Bees are stilldisappearing. Alberta, Canada, has lost at least 100,000 honey bee colonies in the pastseveral months. There is great concern that there are not enough pollinators now for thealmond growers and other farmers dependent upon honey bees for pollination.
