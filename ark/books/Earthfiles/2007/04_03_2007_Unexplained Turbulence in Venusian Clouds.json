April 3 , 2007 Paris, France - New images and data from the European Space Agency’smission to Venus provide more details about the turbulent and noxious atmosphere ofEarth’s sister planet. What causes violent winds and turbulences? Is the surfacetopography playing a role in the complex global dynamics of the atmosphere?The images, showing a complex cloud system, were takenon the night-side of Venus at a wavelength of 1.7 micron that allows viewing thedeep atmospheric layers.
