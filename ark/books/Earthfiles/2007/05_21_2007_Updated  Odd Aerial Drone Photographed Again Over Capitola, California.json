I work on a MacG-5 and re-size images for Earthfiles formats. I downloaded the Chad imagesfrom the COAST website, which I understand were also re-sized there. So, theonly May 6, 2007, original images would be with Chad. Same applies to theMay 5, 2007, Lake Tahoe Submitter 7013; and May 16, 2007, Capitolarajman1977 images.Further, the two individuals quoted in 05/16/07Earthfiles EngineerComments provided me names and contact information and are notanonymous to me, but I protected their confidentiality.As a journalist, I would like to learn if our military has some kind of blackproject for ion electrostatic propulsion drones.]May 21, 2007 Capitola, California - Around May 11, 2007, Coast to Coast AMwebmaster, Lex, received an email letter with attached May 6, 2007, images of a very oddaerial object from a Central California resident who calls himself \"Chad.\" Chad is worriedabout his family's safety and health since he has now seen the bizarre aerial object at leasteight times from his house windows and on hikes near his home. Neighbors, he said, havealso seen the unidentified aerial object. Then on May 15, 2007, I received another similaraerial \"drone\" image allegedly taken by a person at Lake Tahoe, California, on May 5,2007 and identifying themselves at UFO Casebook.com as \"Lake Tahoe-05-05-07MUFONSubmitter 7013.\"Now on May 21, 2007, the following images have been posted at Flickr.com with this emailby rajman1977:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"\"This week I was visting my fiance's parents in Capitola (we were actuallythere to tell them about our engagement, in fact). We were eating dinner on theback porch when we noticed this \"object\" sort of hovering in the sky. Thecamera was still out from earlier so I grabbed it and tried to get some clearshots of it. It took off over the roof shortly after, so I ran into the street in frontof the house to follow, trying to get more shots without wobbling around toomuch (which was harder than it sounds). It then came in lower over atelephone pole, where I was able to get a few more pictures, before it finallytook off into the distance pretty fast. I thought it was gone but noticed it wasstill visible, so I grabbed a few more pictures.At one point a car stopped to look as well. No one had any idea what this thingwas, but everyone in the car was visibly freaked out by it. Once it was gonethey told me to call the news and drove off. :) I'm not sure who else saw it inthe neighborhood since I don't live down there, but I'm sure at least a fewothers must have noticed it. It was way too werid and way too close to gounnoticed. Once it was gone and I caught my breath I could barely stop myhands from shaking for the next hour or so. Needless to say, this is all wetalked about for the rest of the night. None of us can figure out what it was(and that's saying something, because my fiance's dad is a mechanicalengineer).We sent a copy of the photos to their newspaper but haven't heard back yet. Idunno how long that kind of thing takes.There's also some writing on this thing, which I didn't recognize (and I readboth English and Hindi). You can see it in a few of the pictures.Anyway, I created this Flickr account for the best of these pictures. I have noclue what this thing is so I'm putting it out there to see if anyone else saw it.\"Rajman1977 Image 0013, taken with a Konica Minolta DiMAGE X on May 16, 2007,in Capitola, California.

May 18, 2007 - Email from Earthfiles Viewer:\"I read with keen interest your Earthfiles and Coast To Coast articles aboutwhat was described as 'drones' photographed over Lake Tahoe and somewherehere in the Central Valley of California. It jolted my memory to something thathappened a few years back when I was at the Sequoia National Park with mydad (now deceased).\"At the time, there was alot of road repair going on at the park. We werepreparing to leave the park and we were a bit confused as to which road totake to get out of the park and back on a main road heading home toPorterville. We made a couple of stops to ask directions: first with a parkranger and again later from one of the road repair crews.\"As I was getting directions from the park ranger this WEIRD THING flewoverhead, going at a nice, leisurely pace and reminding me of a dragonfly! Iasked the park ranger: 'WHAT was THAT?!' to which he replied: 'I'm told it'ssome kind of a communications device that's supposed to help the park servicemonitor the area for potential problems-stuff like fires and such.'\"I joked: 'So it's NOT a UFO?' to which he kind of chuckled and casually said:'Ha! Nah, I don't think so!' He was just so CASUAL about the whole thing that"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"I really didn't give it much thought at the time, and I'd almost FORGOT aboutit until I read that story posted by a 'Chad.' My dad (who was up in his lateeighties at that time) never saw it, but I AGAIN spotted it off in the distance aswe got directions from the road crew.\"Ask Chad if he took his photographs in or near the Sequoia National Park. Ifhe DID, he might want to casually approach one of the park service personneland show them one of the photographs he took, asking them for any/allinformation they know about it. I actually did have a camera with me that day( a small, hand-wind 110), but I wasn't holding it when I got out of the car toask directions (though I likely would NOT have gotten photos anywhere nearas GOOD as what Chad (or the other guy at Lake Tahoe) did, as I didn't havehigh-speed film and it was such a CRUMMY little camera anyway!\"P.S. Not sure if there is any connection to the funny thing I saw, but that dayI got a TERRIBLE headache and nausea, which was WHY we decided toleave the park earlier than we'd planned that day. I'd chalked it up to driving atsuch high elevations (and Dad going too fast on those tight, winding roads), butthen again you never know!\"Unmanned Aerial VehiclesUnited Kingdom PoliceThe 'spy drone' was originally used for military reconnaissanceand will now be used by civilian police in Liverpool, England,this 2007 summer for the first time.
