Among the observed phenomena consistent with the existence of darkmatter are the rotational speeds of galaxies and orbital velocities of galaxies inclusters, gravitational lensing of background objects by galaxy clusters such asthe Bullet cluster, and the temperature distribution of hot gas in galaxies andclusters of galaxies.\"Dark matter also plays a central role in structure formation and Big Bangnucleosynthesis, and has measurable effects on the anisotropy of the cosmicmicrowave background. All these lines of evidence suggest that galaxies,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"clusters of galaxies, and the universe as a whole contain far more matter thanis directly observable, indicating that the remainder is dark.\"The composition of dark matter is unknown. Current evidence favors modelsin which the primary component of dark matter is new elementary particles,collectively called non-baryonic dark matter. The dark matter component hasvastly more mass than the \"visible\" component of the universe. At present, thedensity of ordinary baryons and radiation in the universe is estimated to beequivalent to about one hydrogen atom per cubic meter of space. Only about4% of the total energy density in the universe (as inferred from gravitationaleffects) can be seen directly. About 23% is thought to be composed of darkmatter. The remaining 73% is thought to consist of dark energy, an evenstranger component, distributed diffusely in space.\"]NASA/JPL report that \"because the dark matter can’t be seen directly, its distribution onthe sky is measured via weak gravitational lensing. This is the distortion of light fromdistant galaxies, rather like the effect of a funhouse mirror, due to the gravitationalwarping of space by dark matter along our line of sight. The Hubble Space Telescope’skeen ability to measure these distortions allowed this map to be created with fineresolution. Constructing the entire map required the measurement of the shapes of half amillion background galaxies and reveals a loose network of dark matter filaments,gradually collapsing under the relentless pull of gravity, and growing clumpier over time.\"The three axes of the box correspond to sky position (in right ascension and declination),and distance from the Earth increasing from left to right (as measured by cosmologicalredshift). Note how the clumping of the dark matter becomes more pronounced, movingright to left across the volume map, from the early universe to the more recent universe.\"This 3-D map confirms theories of how structure formed in our evolving Universe, whichhas transitioned from a comparatively smooth distribution of matter at the time of the bigbang. The dark matter filaments began to form first and provided an underlying scaffoldingfor the subsequent construction of stars and galaxies from ordinary matter. Without darkmatter, there would have been insufficient mass in the universe for structures to collapseand galaxies to form.Three slices in time at 3.5 billion, 5 billion and 6.5 billion years ago look backinto the universe's evolving dark matter past like coring throughgeologic strata. Image by NASA/JPL.\"The slices-of-time dataset above is created by splitting the background source galaxypopulation into three discrete epochs of time (like cutting through geologic strata), lookingback into the past. This is calibrated by measuring the cosmological redshift of the lensinggalaxies used to map the dark matter distribution, and binning them into differenttime/distance “slices.” Each panel represents an area of sky nine times the angulardiameter of the full Moon. Note that this fixed angle means that the survey volume isreally a cone, and that the physical area of the slices increases from 60 million light-yearson a side to 100 million light-years on a side from left to right."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"These two false-color images compare the distribution of normal matter (red)with dark matter (blue) in the universe. The brightness of clumps corresponds to thedensity of mass. The map covers an area of sky nine times the angular diameter of the full Moon,and is the largest sample of the distribution of dark matter ever obtained. It demonstrateshow normal matter - including stars, galaxies and gas - is built inside anunderlying scaffolding of dark matter.This composite shows three different components of the Hubble COSMOS survey.The normal matter is in red, determined mainly by the European Space Agency’s XMM/Newtontelescope. The dark matter is in blue. The stars and galaxies are white-grey observed invisible light with Hubble. Images credit: NASA, ESA and R. Massey, Cal-Tech.\"The Hubble Space Telescope has a narrow field of view, which is only a fraction of theangular diameter of the Moon. Certain research programs have devoted a substantialamount of Hubble observing time to survey comparatively larger areas of sky to address awide range of galaxy evolution and cosmological questions. This is accomplished byassembling mosaic images taken with Hubble’s cameras. These surveys constrain the starformation history of the universe, probing the faintest galaxies and tracking the origin,structure, and merger history of galaxies as they evolve.\"More Information:This first 3-D map of dark matter distribution in the universe was derived from the HubbleSpace Telescope’s largest ever survey of the universe, the Cosmic Evolution Survey(COSMOS), carried out by an international team of 70 astronomers. In making theCOSMOS survey, Hubble photographed 575 adjacent and slightly overlapping views of theuniverse using the Advanced Camera for Surveys' (ACS) Wide Field Camera onboardHubble. It took nearly 1,000 hours of observations. The distances to the galaxies weredetermined from their spectral redshifts, using the Subaru telescope in Hawaii. Thedistribution of additional gas outside galaxies was measured with the European SpaceAgency’s XMM/Newton telescope.For further information about dark matter and energy, please see the Earthfiles Archivesbelow. • 01/17/2004 -- Part 2 - Is Dark Matter the \"Heavy Shadow\" of Light Matter?• 01/13/2004 -- Part 1 - Is Dark Matter the \"Heavy Shadow\" of Visible Matter?• 10/25/2003 -- Science Data Reinforces Invisible \"Dark\" Matter and Energy Make Up 96% of Our Universe• 02/24/2002 -- Mysterious Slowing of Pioneer Spacecraft 7 Billion Miles from Earth• 12/20/2001 -- Will Our Universe End With Its Final Light Frozen in Time?• 12/14/2000 -- A Pleiadian Star Tears Apart Black Interstellar Cloud• 02/01/1999 -- Astronomy Updates with Brian Marsden and John Huchra, Harvard"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Websites:European Space Agency: http://www.esa.int/esaCP/index.html Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2010 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2010, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
