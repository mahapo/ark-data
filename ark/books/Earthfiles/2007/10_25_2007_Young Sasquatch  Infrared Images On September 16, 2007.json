October 25, 2007 Northwestern Pennsylvania - Big, hairy primate-looking Sasquatch,or Bigfoot, have been reported in North America and other parts of the world for morethan a century. Some eyewitnesses have described seeing male and female Sasquatch withsmaller animals thought to be Sasquatch juveniles. Even though no one has gotten anyclear photographs, movie film or videotapes of young ones, eyewitnesses say largeSasquatch have been known to aggressively protect their territory, and presumably theirfamily. Campers have described having rocks thrown at them and been physically chargedby big, growling, long-haired ape creatures, apparently trying to get humans out of theirterritory.In mid-September 2007, deer hunter, R. Jacobs, was not thinking about Sasquatch/Bigfootwhen he placed a deer mineral lick and deer-attracting scents where he set up his Bushnellgame trail camera in northwestern Pennsylvania. All he wanted to know was how manydeer – especially big bucks – were using the trail so he could plan his deer hunt. Thelocation is three hours north of Pittsburgh in very remote forest. Mr. Jacobs’ cameraautomatically senses light and can take color photos in daytime - then switch to infrared atnight – with or without flash. The camera was set to go off at motion in front of the lens."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"\"Sasquatch/Bigfoot Country\" - eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania northof Pittsburgh. The R. Jacobs game trail camera was set up about three hours north of Pittsburgh.On three frames dated September 16, 2007, beginning at 4 minutes and 23 seconds after 8PM, there are two black bear cubs at the block of mineral lick.Then about a half hour later, according to the electronic time on the image, the minerallick was knocked over and there was an animal that looks more like a primate than a bear– but the head is not visible.36 seconds after that, a third image shows the primate-looking animal in a posture that atfirst is confusing. But to people knowledgeable about primate behavior, the odd posturecould be an animal that is smelling the ground, while its buttocks is up in the air.The deer hunter, R. Jacobs, was so puzzled about what his game trail camera hadphotographed that he started showing the images to his family and friends. His teenagedaughter suggested it might be a juvenile Sasquatch, or Bigfoot. She searched on theinternet and came to the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization, also known as BFRO.BFRO was formed in 1995 by a group of field investigators who wanted to pool resourcesfor expeditions to find Sasquatch. The group’s director is Matthew Moneymaker, who hasbeen on 40 Sasquatch expeditions and been within 100 feet of the big, hairy primates atleast a dozen times. Once, in the moonlight at 2 AM, Matthew was approached by an8-foot-tall hairy creature that was growling only 15 feet away. Matthew told me, “I didn’tfeel he wanted to kill me. He just wanted us to move out of his territory.”By Friday, October 19th, with the deer hunter’s permission, Matthew placed the threeimages on the BFRO website for feedback. That night I interviewed him and began byasking Matthew what his own personal first reaction was to the infrared images.Infra red image 20:32:05 cropped on close-up of \"unidentified primate\" near tree.Image © 2007 by R. Jacobs.Interview:"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Matthew Moneymaker, Director, Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO),San Juan Capistrano, California: “Oh, I immediately knew that it was a young Squatch!Especially to see the bear cubs and using that as a gauge for the size and knowing this wasa fairly small figure - and especially the quadruped stance. Like in the first image (of‘unidentified primate’), people say, ‘Oh, it’s leaning over.’ I’ve told them, ‘No, that’s theway they walk.’ That’s the thing walking along as it normally does, what you see in thefirst image.And I’ve talked to a few eyewitnesses who have seen them run quadrupedally and thenthey will get up on two legs.PHOTO ONE (20:32:05 above ), IT IS LEANING AND STRETCHING OUT AND YOUDO NOT SEE A CLEAR PICTURE OF THE HEAD.AND THEN, IN THE NEXT PHOTOGRAPH (20:32:41 below ), WHICH AT FIRST ISCONFUSING. BUT THEN IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP OF THE CREATURE ASBEING ITS BUTTOCK GOING STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR AND IT HAS ITS HEADDOWN - THAT MAKES SOME SENSE OUT OF THAT SECOND PHOTO.Infra red image 20:32:41 cropped on close-up of \"unidentified primate\" near tree.Image © 2007 by R. Jacobs.I THINK YOU HAVE TALKED WITH SOMEBODY ABOUT THIS BEING ACHIMPANZEE TYPE OF BEHAVIOR?Yes. Apes will very often smell the ground and they will get into that kind of posture(buttocks in the air) with outstretched arms and they’ll put their face right onto the groundlike that. Any Larger Sasquatch Tracks AtPennsylvania Camera Site?DID THE HUNTERS GO BACK TO THAT SITE AND LOOK FOR ANY OF THELARGER 14-INCH TO 17-INCH TO 18-INCH PRINTS THAT HAVE BECOMEASSOCIATE D W ITH SASQUATCH?I believe they did. They even said they were surprised that they did not find any largertracks there. But you’re only going to get clear tracks if you have exposed soil. Even then,it’s got to be exposed as either wet soil like mud or very loose soil like sand. You just don’tget very clear, obvious tracks in most situations because usually in a forest, the ground isnot exposed. It has pine needles and leaves and sticks and usually has a good layer of thatif it’s a dense forest. They didn’t find any, but of course, they are looking for them now!(laughs)WELL, THAT’S GOOD! IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT YOU AND BFRO ARECONVINCED THAT THIS IS THE CLEAREST PHOTOGRAPH OF A YOUNGSASQUATCH THAT ANYBODY HAS BEEN ABLE TO RECORD?I believe it is. As far as photos that have been circulated, yeah, these are far and away themost compelling. Two R. Jacobs Game Trail Cameras"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Damaged Before - By Sasquatch?THE CAMERA WAS DAMAGED TWICE OR THE TWO CAMERAS WEREDAMAGED THERE AT THAT TRAIL?Yes, I asked them (hunter and his brother) after I saw the photos, ‘Are the cameras still upthere?’ And the brother said they had to take them down because they got broken and theyhad to get them fixed. He said on the first camera, something had smashed the lens. Theysent it back to Bushnell and they got it repaired. Then they put out another camera of thesame type and it got smashed even more.Both brothers, they didn’t know what this small figure was – they didn’t know what weknew about the history of Bigfoot researchers placing cameras out where Sasquatches(Bigfoot) are seen and then coming back and finding the cameras smashed.RIGHT. AND ISN’T IT TRUE THAT IT’S THE FLASHES ON CAMERAS THAT SEEMSEEM TO PROVOKE THE SASQUATCH/BIGFOOT?It might be the flash. And it might simply be the appearance of the camera, a man-madeobject, on the side of a tree. It could very well be that it’s the flash. And I’ll tell you, whenwe’ve set up game cameras – flash cameras – when you walk in front of a flash gamecamera and it goes off at night, it will blind you temporarily. You won’t be able to seeanything for a little while because it’s such a bright flash. I tell you, if I was walkingthrough the woods and one flashed at me, I’d be a little angry myself and I might want todo something to that camera! (laughs)And in some cases where they put the cameras on a tree, they found the tree pushed overso it would fall onto the camera. People that we’ve talked to who have tried to use gametrail cameras to get photos of these (Sasquatch/Bigfoot) things have tried that numeroustimes. And the researchers who put those cameras out there thought (who was responsible)was the thing they were trying to photograph had actually damaged the camera.AND YOU MEAN SASQUATCH.Yes! I’ll always remember one particular witness who I got to know very well. He hadhelped take me to the place where I had the closest encounter I ever had to one, where Ihad one walk up to about 15 feet away from me. It was growling at me. And not far fromthere, he (friend) had been pursued by a young one and it ran. They would see them atnight in the dark and they described them almost as panther-like, running very agilely onall fours and being able to climb and go over fences – climb up a fence and then down theother side of the fence, using its arms and legs as it was climbing up a fence.Being able to climb up in a tree and sit up on its haunches. And from other parts of thecountry, there were sketches of young ones showing them in that kind of quadrupedstance. So, this is very consistent with what we folks in the BFRO has suspected a youngone would look like. Close Encounter with Big Sasquatch in OhioI’ve been close to these things (Sasquatch/Bigfoot) on several occasions. Their behavior –the way they’ll come up and growl and follow you and sometimes they will throw things.There was one occasion where it could only have taken a few steps to be right on top ofme.WHEN WAS THAT? WHAT DATE? WHERE? AND HOW BIG WAS THATSASQUATCH?It was about 7.5-feet-tall and it was in July 1994 in Portage County, Ohio, in a wildliferefuge. We were staking out this road coming out of the wildlife refuge leading into afarming area where a lot of farmers in the area had reported seeing them and hearing themand finding their tracks. We were staking the road out and expecting him (Sasquatch) tocome out along this road and they did.We think it’s because the light coming out of our night vision devices – the guy I was with– we think they (Sasquatch) spotted us first and instead of walking down the road in frontof us, they circled around and bluff charged at him. Then the larger one came up andaround in back of me and came to the edge of a tree line. I was hunkered down behind alittle berm and he came out and growled at me. It let me know that it knew I was there andthat I shouldn’t be there! That was certainly the sense I got from it. And I got up and wastalking in its direction like if you had a dog coming your direction and growling at you,how you would instinctively say, ‘OK, it’s alright.’ That’s what I was doing toward this"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"thing as I was picking up all my stuff and walking away. And I wasn’t really scared asmuch as I was happy. I knew if it stopped and growled in the kind of raspy way it wasgrowling, I knew that’s all it was going to do.The fact that it would not come out very far – it was staying right at the tree line so itcould just take a step back and would disappear back into the brush. It was partialmoonlight and it was about 2:30 AM, so I could see the shape of the thing. I could see thatit was hairy and about 7 to 8 feet tall and that it was clearly not a person. The proportionswere just way off the scale!The guy who was with me that they (Sasquatch) had bluff charged, he was close to 100feet away – he did shine a light on it and he did a detailed drawing of it. We have a pageon the website about eyewitness sketches from Ohio and one of the sketches was fromwhat he saw that night. It’s on our website.OHIO IS RIGHT ON THE BORDER WITH WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA.It is indeed. And there’s a lot of sightings – especially in eastern Ohio and westernPennsylvania. We believe the reason is because there is a large deer population. Why Hasn't A Sasquatch Been Captured?YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED THAT SASQUATCH EXISTS AND YOU’VEHAD YOUR OWN FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCES. WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THISCREATURE REMAINS MYTHOLOGICAL FOR MOST OF THE POPULATION? WHYHAS ONE NOT BEEN CAPTURED IN THE LAST 100 OR 200 YEARS?(laughs) If you were in the thick of it like we are and you’d say, ‘Where would they go?Where would they hide?’ It’s funny because when you go to the sorts of remote places thatwe go, you know that humans in these vast wilderness areas will only walk along the roadsor the trails and will only be on like 2% of that land. And it’s dangerous to walk off a trailor road in a really thick, rugged area. And then try to catch them? That would assume thatlike everyone is trying to capture them, whereas NO ONE is trying to capture them!(laughs)And these things operate at night!” Prof. of Human Anatomy CommentsOne of the few academics to take the Sasquatch/Bigfoot phenomenon seriously is JeffMeldrum, Ph.D. He received his Masters of Science Degree from Utah’s Brigham YoungUniversity in 1984 after studying Vertebrate Locomotion. Five years later in 1989, hereceived his Ph.D. in Anatomical Sciences from the State University of New York inStoneybrook. His Ph.D. research focused upon terrestrial adaptations in the foot skeletonsof African monkeys with implications for hominid bipedalism - which is walking andrunning on two legs. After that he did post-doctoral work at Duke University for two anda half years. Then he worked as Professor of Evolutionary Morphology in the Cell,Molecular and Structural Biological Department at the Medical School Campus ofNorthwestern University in Chicago. By 1993, Jeff Meldrum became Professor of HumanAnatomy at Idaho State University where he has taught for the past fourteen years.His book, Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science was released in September 2006. Prof.Meldrum also has more than 200 plaster casts of alleged Bigfoot/Sasquatch footprints –some of which he has gathered himself from field investigations."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Sasquatch, Legend Meets Science© 2006 by Jeff Meldrum, Ph.D.Jeff Meldrum, Ph.D., Professor of Anatomy and Anthropology,Idaho State University, with alleged plaster casts of Sasquatch/Bigfootin exhibit at the Museum of Natural History, Pocatello, Idaho, that isopen to the public until June 16, 2007. Photograph courtesy Jeff Meldrum.When I asked Prof. Meldrum about the infrared images, beginning with what BFRO callsPhotograph 1 of an “unidentified primate,” Prof. Meldrum said, “It’s intriguing.” His firstthoughts were that the limb proportions in the photograph could NOT be a bear becausethey are so long. But he qualified that the infrared images might be a black bear thatfollowed the two cubs a half hour earlier.We also talked about the fact that the evolution of Sasquatch/Bigfoot from birth toadulthood is not known. Dr. Meldrum said it’s possible that the young primates could haveproportions more similar to a chimpanzee, as might be the case in these infrared images.That issue was provoked by the size of the feet in the infrared photographs, which aresmaller in proportion to the legs than the very large feet on full grown adult Sasquatch.Prof. Meldrum said the characteristics he uses to distinguish a human track from aSasquatch track are:- The Sasquatch footprints don’t show arches like human feet do.- Sasquatch prints are much wider.- Sasquatch toe prints are much longer.- Sasquatch heel prints are much wider than humans’, particularly in contrastto the remainder of the foot."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Sasquatch track on left cast by John Bindernagel, Ph.D., in Strathcona Provincial Park,Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, October 1988. Sasquatch track is15-inches-long compared to 11-inch-long human foot cast on right.Photograph © 1988 by John Bindernagel. See: 092901 Earthfiles.Prof. Meldrum acknowledged that “maybe some of those features don’t manifestthemselves until the Sasquatch individual has grown up and obtained a much greater bulkand weight (as an adult).”Finally, Prof. Meldrum stressed – as Matthew Moneymaker says - that Sasquatch’sapparent strategy is to avoid human contact whenever possible, which is why we don’tknow much about the mysterious creatures, whether young or adult.More Information:To keep up with the BFRO Sasquatch research and upcoming expeditions, visit theirwebsite, http://www.bfro.netFor further reports about Sasquatch/Bigfoot, please see my 2-volume book, Glimpses ofOther Realities, in the Earthfiles Shop, plus other reports below in the EarthfilesArchive:• 12/29/2006 — Earthfiles Mail About Sasquatch• 12/28/2006 — Physical Evidence That Sasquatch Lives?• 09/05/2006 — Part 2: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet?• 06/22/2006 — \"Vacuum Black\" Entity in Mexico Reservoir• 09/06/2004 — Part 1: Terry Sherman - 1996 Interview About High Strangeness on Fort Duchesne, UtahRanch• 02/24/2004 — Part 1: UFO Crash/Retrievals: The Inner Sanctum - Status Report VI © July 1991 by LeonardH.
