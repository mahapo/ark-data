Graphic illustration © 2007 by eyewitness Paul McKeever. November 29, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Eleven months ago in January 2007,I received an email from an Albuquerque resident named Paul McKeever. He said he andhis family had seen a glowing disc – first in the sky and then on the ground surrounded bymilitary. He gave his phone number and I called him. By March 4, 2007, I met with Paul atthe apartment where his aunt, Sandy Rivers, lived with her family in the early 1970s andwhere Paul at age 8 was visiting with his mother, Rebecca McKeever Armstrong. He andhis two cousins were playing outside when the three saw a brightly glowing, white discmoving in the evening sky at the same time that Sandy and Rebecca heard radio station770 KKOB announce a news alert that an unidentified flying object was in the air overAlbuquerque.The family rushed to their car and chased down Albuquerque streets as they watched theglowing, white disc move slowly and steadily downward in the sky toward the Sandia Hills.What they saw has haunted them for the past thirty-three years. What still puzzles them -and now me – is how could something so seemingly public to at least a few curiousAlbuquerque residents be so completely erased from media and public discussion afterwardfrom May 1974 to 2007?1974 was a year that stands out in the past half century as a time when mysterious aerialdiscs and non-humans were reported almost daily around the world – along with animalmutilations linked to unidentified aerial lights and beams. Newsweek magazine reported inits September 30, 1974, issue about the mysteries of “midnight marauders.”"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Those shiny, glowing discs were being seen everywhere in both hemispheres and somereports were even about disc retrievals, with or without non-human entities.

Then we talked a couple of minutes about whether we should see if we couldgo find it or not. That’s when we got up and went to the door and the kids were coming in.Aunt: And we came out to get the kids to take them and we could see the glow, what Ithought was the glow from it. PAUL, WHAT WERE YOU SEEING IN THE SKY OUT HERE?Like looking at a football sideways and it had a really intense glow like a fluorescent bulb,or like those globes that have a bulb inside of them and are white. It had a real intense glowto it and it was moving kind of towards us to the left, is what I remember. We got in the carand that’s when we drove and were chasing it down, trying to see where it was going.Mom: He and the other two children were outside playing, so they actually saw it beforewe did because we heard the announcement on the radio.Aunt: We more or less followed the glow. We went out Pennsylvania ... and when we gotto Menaul, it looked like it was at the end of Menaul.\""},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" Menaul Blvd. (yellow name) is road(red) that intersects with Tramway Blvd. (green).Back in 1974, there were only dirt roads (dotted lines) to the east of Tramway and that Maynight, the family traveled on one trail as far as they could go in their chase after the white,glowing disc that ended up horizontal (hovering?) near the bottom of a rocky hill.Map produced by Linda Moulton Howe.On April 1st, 2007, I traveled with Paul McKeever, his mom and aunt out Pennsylvaniaand Menaul beyond Tramway Blvd. as far as we could go after 33 years of housingdevelopments spreading at the base of the Sandias in what were only dirt trails back in1974. The family thought one particular rock-covered hill looked like the place they droveto following the glowing disc in the sky.Rocky hill in Sandia Mountains beyond Menaul and Tramway Blvd. that familythought was close to where they were back in May 1974 when military surrounded glowing,white disc.

April 1, 2007, photograph © 2007 by Linda Moulton Howe.Aunt: We came up as far as we could on the pavement and then it was like a – I guess youwould call it almost like a dirt trail that we took. It wasn’t really a dirt road. It was like cartracks make through a field or something. We drove onto that and we could see an objectwith a lot of light around it, bright light. And we were stopped. And we were told that wehad to turn around and to leave the area.Mom: Immediately!Aunt: Immediately!Paul: Yeah, he was very agitated.Aunt: He meant what he said.Paul: Yeah, he was very, very serious, but we were fairly close to the object. I mean, closeenough to get a really good look at it. We could see the people around it.Mom and Aunt: Soldiers, yeah, the military.Paul: There were soldiers around it and had pretty much a perimeter around it. Every somany feet, there was a soldier dotted around the thing.Aunt: They were armed.Paul: Yes, they had M-16s and they were facing the object and the thing was glowingintensely. The funny thing to me was that it was at the very bottom slope of the hill. Butthe thing was pretty level. But you couldn’t really see anything underneath it. It was just"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"kind of sitting level. But it looked like it was close enough to the ground to be on it, but itwas level. That baffled me.Aunt: Because it was more or less on a rocky surface.Mom: Yeah, the hill was at an angle to it.IS THE IMPLICATION THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HOVERING THERE?Mom: That’s what I would think. Now, thinking back, that’s exactly what it was – it washovering.Paul: You couldn’t see any gears or legs or ...Aunt: No, you could not see anything underneath it.Paul: And it was glowing, so it was illuminating the area around it, plus the military hadthe deuce and a half truck, which is a 2.5 ton truck that has a canvas back on it, but thecanvas was off of it and they had a spotlight mounted on the back. They were searching thebushes and the area in the rocks outside and around of the disc object. It looked like theywere trying to see if anything was like hiding in the bushes or around the rocks becausethey had soldiers around it. But the soldiers were back. They were away from the thing.They were not like close to it. They were back away from it. To the right of the object fromour point of view to the right, there was a whole pool of vehicles and there was morepersonnel mixed in among the vehicles. From what I noticed, they were all militarypersonnel.Illustration of white glowing disc in May 1974, seeming to hover on rocky hillside,while a military deuce and a half aimed a strong beam of light at the disc.

He had a New Mexico State Patrol uniform on and I remember thecar being a state police car because it was black and white and the state trooper cars wereblack and white. That’s what I remember anyway.The whole time this thing was glowing and he (police officer) just made us turn around. Weturned around and pretty much left the area. But that was it. We just left.Mom: There were other cars parked behind us that were coming up the road also.Mom: I would say there were at least six (other cars) behind us that I remember.IT APPEARS THAT THE MILITARY IS ALREADY IN OPERATION.All: Oh, yeah!Paul: They were here before us, which means they had to be following the object thewhole time because there wasn’t that much time between when we saw it and went after itand when we saw it on the ground - I mean it could not have been more than 15 to 20minutes, something like that.Aunt: Seems like it. And it seems like I remember seeing other military vehicles drivinginto the area.Mom: Yeah, that’s what I was thinking, too."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Aunt: There were a lot of (military) people there, but there were some more coming in.And it was all military and we were very close.Mom: Very close – closer than we thought we could. (laughs)Paul: Yeah, we got a lot closer than you would think you could get to something like that.Nowadays I don’t know if ...Aunt: ... we could have gotten in that close before we were stopped.Mom: We were very close!

AND YOU ARE LOOKING AT A DISC THAT’S ABOUT – ITHINK YOU SAID ABOUT 40 FEET IN DIAMETER?Paul: Yeah, approximately 40 feet, judging by how big I thought the soldiers looked to thething. I remember it being about 40 feet in diameter, maybe 10 to 12 feet high. The discwas quite a bit taller than the men, but not enormously so.SO, FOR THAT DISC TO BE LOOKING TOTALLY FLAT AND HORIZONTAL TOYOU, HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT, IF THERE IS A SLANTED HILL?Paul: It was still glowing, so it must have been under some kind of power to hold it therein a level position because you could not see anything underneath ..."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Mom and Aunt: Nothing under it came out.Paul: Nothing protruded ...Mom and Aunt: To help it sit there, or whatever.Paul: It was lighting up the whole area and you could see the ground underneath it andaround it, plus the spotlight (on deuce and a half) was shining around. So, it was verystrange to me that it was level on the side of a hill.Mom and Aunt: Yeah! (both laugh)Mom: Very strange. Pre-Arranged Meeting?AND DOESN’T THAT IMPLY THE POSSIBILITY THAT RATHER THAN A CRASH,THIS WAS LIKE A MEETING WITH THE MILITARY?Paul: Well, the way the soldiers were around it with the spotlight and everything, it wasn’tsomething I think they were expecting. To me, it looked like it was disabled or was causedto be disabled.Mom: They had reason, the military, for being there so quickly. It’s hard really to say.Paul: What’s amazing is that they got all that stuff together so quickly. It’s almost like itwas a group put together in case something like that happened. How do you get all thatstuff, all that equipment and all those people ready so quick?Aunt: It was like they were standing there guarding it, like they were waiting for someone,or some thing, to come out of it.Mom: Or for someone to come and tell them what to do! (all laugh)Paul: You could definitely tell that they were cautious of it. You know, when I was in theU. S. Army, when you guarded something, you faced away from it. So, they weren’tguarding it like it was ours. They were around it like they were keeping it contained,almost, because if it were ours, the guards would have been facing away from it. How Was Sandia Hills Discand Military Encounter \"Erased\"?HOW DO YOU THINK THAT THEY KEPT THIS TOTALLY BOTTLED UP ALL OFTHESE YEARS?Paul: I’m sure if the government wanted to keep it quiet, they probably went to the radio,TV and newspaper and told them to keep it quiet because there was nothing on the news.There was nothing in the newspaper or on the radio the next day, or even for several daysafter. It was just like it never happened.Aunt: Like it never happened.Mom: As to why the people, though, who were there like us and the people who were inthe cars, I don’t know why no one ever said anything. We didn’t! (laughs)Paul: Yeah, I don’t know if they were contacted and told not to, or if they thought peoplewould think they were crazy? Or?Mom: But we were definitely intimidated because we immediately – we did not ask,‘What’s going on?’ after he told us to leave. We immediately turned the car around andwent straight home.Paul: When he told us to turn around and the way he was acting – I remember it scaredme when I was a kid.Aunt: And he said it in a very authoritative voice. There was no point in asking anyquestions because we weren’t going to get any answers.DID HE AIM A GUN AT YOU?"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"All: No, he didn’t.BUT THERE WERE GUNS ON THE MEN WHO WERE RINGING THE DISC?All: Ye s, t h e r e w e r e .Paul: They had M-16s.WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE IN 2007 TO CONTACT ME?Paul: I was just curious. I wanted to know if other people were on the web or somethingand reporting the same event that we saw. I was curious to get their take on it andperception and so I started contacting and asking questions to see if I could get otherpeople who had witnessed the event.AND SANDY AND REBECCA, YOU WERE YOUNG ADULTS THEN. HAVE YOUEVER TALKED ABOUT THIS WITH OTHER PEOPLE TO FIND OUT WHETHERTHEY SAW IT?Mom: No, strangely enough.Aunt: Just family.Mom: Right, just family. I have never told anyone except family.DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHY?Mom: No, I don’t.Aunt: I don’t know why either that I never mentioned it.Mom: And we didn’t talk that much about it even with family.DO YOU THINK IT WAS THAT YOU WERE LITERALLY SO SCARED?Aunt: We did tell family, but.Paul: It’s hard to talk about something like that. You don’t want people...Mom: Don’t want people to think you’re crazy.Paul: ...to think you’re crazy or weird or something. But over the years, it’s gotten to thepoint to where I just didn’t really care.”Historically, a decade before the Sandia hills event, back on April 25, 1964, there wassupposed to have been a pre-arranged meeting between extraterrestrial biological entities,known as EBENs, and American military at Holloman AFB near White Sands MissileRange south of Albuquerque. [ See my book An Alien Harvest in the Earthfiles Shop.]During that alleged alien and human meeting, three football or egg-shaped, white crafthovered in a defensive triangular pattern close to the ground. I have been told that thenon-humans gave us some advanced technologies and agreed to take three of our militaryto their planet in an exchange program while two or three of the EBENs remained on Earthas “visitors” at Los Alamos laboratory and other sites.It’s possible that the brightly glowing disc that seemed to hover horizontally on the rockySandia hillside was actually anticipated by some agency or unit from Kirtland AFB andthat’s why so much military got to the site so rapidly before Paul’s family and the othercars.As Paul McKeever and his family said to me, “We all deserve to know the truth about thediscs and if enough witnesses speak up, maybe that can make a difference.”I am hoping that others will contact me who were also in Albuquerque, New Mexico, onMay 28, 1974, at the Sandia hills on the eastern edge of the city beyond Menaul andTramway Boulevards, watching the glowing disc surrounded by military - or were one ofthe military security police.
