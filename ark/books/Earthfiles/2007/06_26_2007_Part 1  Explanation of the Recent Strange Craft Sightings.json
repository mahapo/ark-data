It is a companion to numerous document and photoscans and should not be separated from them.You can call me Isaac, an alias I've chosen as a simple measure of protectionwhile I release what would be called tremendously sensitive information evenby todays standards. “Sensitive” is not necessarily synonymous with“dangerous”, though, which is why my conscience is clear as I offer thismaterial up for the public. My government has its reasons for its continualsecrecy, and I sympathize with many of them, but the truth is that I'm gettingold and I'm not interested in meeting my maker one day with any morebaggage than necessary! Furthermore, I put a little more faith in humanitythan my former bosses do, and I think that a release of at least some of thisinfo could help a lot more than it could hurt, especially in today's world.I should be clear before I begin, as a final note: I am not interested in makingmyself vulnerable to the consequences of betraying the trust of my superiorsand will not divulge any personal information that could determine myidentity. However my intent is not to deceive, so information that I think istoo risky to share will be simply left out rather than obfuscated in some way(aside from my alias, which I freely admit is not my real name). I wouldestimate that with the information contained in this letter, I could be narroweddown to one of maybe 30-50 people at best, so I feel reasonably secure.Some Explanation for the Recent SightingsFor many years I've occasionally considered the release of at least some of thematerial I possess, but the recent wave of photos and sightings has promptedme to cut to the chase and do so now.I should first be clear that I'm not directly familiar with any of the crafts seenin the photos in their entirety. I've never seen them in a hangar or worked onthem myself or seen aliens zipping around in them. However, I have workedwith and seen many of the parts visible in these crafts, some of which can beseen in the Q3-85 Inventory Review scan found at the top of this page. Moreimportantly though, I'm very familiar with the “language” on their undersidesseen clearly in photos by Chad and Rajman, and in another form in the BigBasin photos.One question I can answer for sure is why they're suddenly here. These craftshave probably existed in their current form for decades, and I can say for surethat the technology behind them has existed for decades before that. The“language”, in fact, (I'll explain shortly why I keep putting that in quotes) wasthe subject of my work in years past. I'll cover that as well.The reason they're suddenly visible, however, is another matter entirely.These crafts, assuming they're anything like the hardware I worked with in the80's (assuming they're better, in fact), are equipped with technology thatenables invisibility. That ability can be controlled both on board the craft, andremotely. However, what's important in this case is that this invisibility canalso be disrupted by other technology. Think of it like radar jamming. I wouldbet my life savings (since I know this has happened before) that these craftare becoming visible and then returning to invisibility arbitrarily, probablyunintentionally, and undoubtedly for only short periods, due to the activity ofa kind of disrupting technology being set off elsewhere, but nearby. I'mespecially sure of this in the case of the Big Basin sightings, were thewitnesses themselves reported seeing the craft just appear and disappear. Thisis especially likely because of the way the witness described one of theappearances being only a momentary flicker, which is consistent with the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"unintentional, intermittent triggering of such a device.It's no surprise that these sightings are all taking place in California, andespecially the Saratoga/South Bay area. Not far from Saratoga is MountainView/Sunnyvale, home to Moffett Field and the NASA Ames Research center.Again, I'd be willing to bet just about anything that the device capable ofhijacking the cloaking of these nearby craft was inadvertently triggered,probably during some kind of experiment, at the exact moment they werebeing seen. Miles away, in Big Basin, the witnesses were in the right place atthe right time and saw the results of this disruption with their own eyes. Godknows what else was suddenly appearing in the skies at that moment, and whoelse may have seen it. I've had some direct contact with this device, or at leasta device capable of the same thing, and this kind of mistake is notunprecedented. I am personally aware of at least one other incident in whichthis kind of technology was accidentally set off, resulting in the suddenvisibility of normally invisible things. The only difference is that these days,cameras are a lot more common!The technology itself isn't ours, or at least it wasn't in the 80's. Much like thetechnology in these crafts themselves, the device capable of remotelyhijacking a vehicle's clacking comes from a non-human source too. Why wewere given this technology has never been clear to me, but it's responsible fora lot. Our having access to this kind of device, along with our occasionallyhaphazard experimentation on them, has lead to everything from cloakingmalfunctions like this to full-blown crashes. I can assure you that most (and inmy opinion all) incidents of UFO crashes or that kind of thing had more to dowith our meddling with extremely powerful technology at an inopportune timethan it did mechanical failure on their part. Trust me, those things don't failunless something even more powerful than them makes them fail(intentionally or not). Think of it like a stray bullet. You can be hit by one atany time, without warning, and even the shooter didn't intent to hit you. I canassure you heads are rolling over this as well. If anyone notices a brilliant butsloppy physicist patrolling the streets of Baghdad in the next couple weeks, I'dbe willing to guess how he got there. (I kid, of course, as I certainly hope thathasn't actually happened in this case)I'd now like to explain how it is that I know this.The CARET ProgramMy story begins the same as it did for many of my co workers, with graduateand post-graduate work at university in electrical engineering. And I hadalways been interested in computer science, which was a very new field at thetime, and my interest piqued with my first exposure to a Tixo during gradschool. In the years following school I took a scenic route through the techindustry and worked for the kinds of companies you would expect, until I wasoffered a job at the Department of Defense and things took a very differentturn.My time at the DoD was mostly uneventful but I was there for quite a while. Iapparently proved myself to be reasonably intelligent and loyal. By 1984these qualities along with my technical background made me a likelycandidate for a new program they were recruiting for called “CARET”.Before I explain what CARET was I should back up a little. By 1984, SiliconValley had been a juggernaut of technology for decades. In the less than 40years since the appearance of Shockley’s transistor this part of the world hadalready produced a multi billion dollar computer industry and madetechnological strides that were unprecedented in other fields, from hypertextand online collaboration in '68 to the Alto in '73.Private industry in Silicon Valley was responsible for some of the mostincredible technological leaps in history and this fact did not go unnoticed bythe US government and military. I don’t claim to have any special knowledgeabout Roswell or any of the other alleged early UFO events, but I do knowthat whatever the exact origin, the military was hard at work trying tounderstand and use the extra-terrestrial artifacts it had in its possession. Whilethere had been a great deal of progress overall, things were not moving asquickly as some would have liked. So, in 1984, the CARET program wascreated with the aim of harnessing the abilities of private industry in siliconvalley and applying it to the ongoing task of understanding extra-terrestrialtechnology."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"One of the best examples of the power of the tech sector was Xerox PARC, aresearch center in Palo Alto, CA. XPARC was responsible for some of themajor milestones in the history of computing. While I never had the privilegeof working there myself I did know many of the people who did and I can saythat they were among the brightest engineers I ever knew.XPARC served as one of the models for the CARET program’s firstincarnation, a facility called the Palo Alto CARET Laboratory (PACL,lovingly pronounced “packle” during my time there). This was where Iworked, along with numerous other civilians, under the auspices of militarybrass who were eager to find out how the tech sector made so much progressso quickly. My time at the DoD was a major factor behind why I was chosen,and in fact about 30+ others who were hired around the same time had alsobeen at the Department about as long, but this was not the case for everyone.A couple of my co-workers were plucked right from places like IBM and, atleast two of them came from XPARC itself. My DoD experience did make memore eligable for positions of management, however, which is how I have somuch of this material in my possession to begin with.So in other words, civilians like myself who had at--at most--some decentexperience working for the DoD but no actual military training orinvolvement, were suddenly finding ourselves in the same room as highlyclassified extra-terrestrial technology. Of course they spent about 2 monthsbriefing us all before we saw or did anything, and did their best to convince usthat if we ever leaked a single detail about what we were being told, they’d doeverything short of digging up our ancestors and putting a few slugs in themtoo just for good measure. It seemed like there was an armed guard in everycorner of every room. I’d worked under some pretty hefty NDAs in my timebut this was so far out of my depth I didn’t think I was going to last 2 weeks inan environment like that. But amazingly things got off to a good start. Theywanted us, plain and simple, and our industry had shown itself to be so goodat what it did that they were just about ready to give us carte blanche.Of course, nothing with the military is ever that simple, and as is often thecase they wanted to have their cake and eat it too. What I mean by this is thatdespite their interest in picking our brains and learning whatever they couldfrom our way of doing things, they still wanted to do it their way often enoughto frustrate us.At this point I'm going to gloss over the emotional side of this experience,because this letter isn't intended to be a memoir, but I will say that there'salmost no way to describe the impact this kind of revelation has on your mind.There are very few moments in life in which your entire world view is turnedforever upside down, but this was one of them. I still remember that turningpoint during the briefing when I realized what he'd just told us, and that Ihadn't heard him wrong, and that it wasn't some kind of joke. In retrospect thewhole thing feels like it was in slow motion, from that slight pause he took justbefore the term “extra-terrestrial” came out for the first time, to the way theroom itself seemed to go off kilter as we collectively tried to grasp what wasbeing said. My reflex kept jumping back and forth between trying to look atthe speaker, to understand him better, and looking at everyone else aroundme, to make sure I wasn't the only one that was hearing this. At the risk ofsounding melodramatic, it's a lot like a child learning his parents are divorcing.I never experienced that myself, but a very close friend of mine did whenwere boys, and he confided in me a great deal about what the experience feltlike. A lot of what he said would aptly describe what I was feeling in thatroom. Here was a trusted authority figure telling you something that you justdon't feel ready for, and putting a burden on your mind that you don'tnecessarily want to carry. The moment that first word comes out, all you canthink about it is what it was like only seconds ago, and knowing that life isnever going to be as simple as it was then. After all that time at the DoD, Ithought I at least had some idea of what was going on in the world, but I'dnever heard so much as a peep about this. Maybe one day I'll write more onthis aspect, because it's the kind of thing I really would like to get off mychest, but for now I'll digress.Unlike traditional research in this area, we weren’t working on new toys forthe air force. For numerous reasons, the CARET people decided to aim itsefforts at commercial applications rather than military ones. They basicallywanted us to turn these artifacts into something they could patent and sell.One of CARET’s most appealing promises was the revenue generated bythese product-ready technologies, which could be funneled right back intoblack projects. Working with a commercial application in mind was also yet"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"another way to keep us in a familiar mind state. Developing technology for themilitary is very different than doing so for the commercial sector, and nothaving to worry about the difference was another way that CARET was verymuch like private industry.CARET shined in the way it let us work the way we were used to working.They wanted to recreate as much of the environment we were used to as theycould without compromising issues like security. That meant we got free reignto set up our own workflow, internal management structure, style manuals,documentation, and the like. They wanted this to look and feel like privateindustry, not the military. They knew that was how to get the best work out ofus, and they were right.But things didn’t go as smoothly when it came to matters like access toclassified information. They were exposing what is probably their singlebiggest secret to a group of people who had never even been through basictraining and it was obvious that the gravity of this decision was never far fromtheir minds. We started the program with a small set of extra-terrestrialartifacts along with fairly elaborate briefings on each as well as access to amodest amount of what research had already been completed. It wasn’t longbefore we realized we needed more though, and getting them to provide eventhe smallest amount of new material was like pulling teeth. CARET stood for“Commercial Applications Research for Extra-terrestrial Technology”, but weoften joked that it should have stood for “Civilians Are Rarely Ever Trusted.”PACL was located in Palo Alto, but unlike XPARC, it wasn’t at the end of along road in the middle of a big complex surrounded by rolling hills and trees.PACL was hidden in an office complex owned entirely by the military butmade to look like an unassuming tech company. From the street, all you couldsee was what appeared to be a normal parking lot with a gate and a guardbooth, and a 1-story building inside with a fictitious name and logo. Whatwasn’t visible from the street was that behind the very first set of doors wasenough armed guards to invade Poland, and 5 additional underground stories.They wanted to be as close as possible to the kinds of people they werelooking to hire and be able to bring them in with a minimum of fuss.Inside, we had everything we needed. State of the art hardware and a staff ofover 200 computer scientists, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers,physicists and mathematicians. Most of us were civilians, as I’ve said, butsome were military, and a few of them had been working on this technologyalready. Of course, you were never far from the barrel of a machine gun, eveninside the labs themselves (something many of us never got used to), andbi-weekly tours were made by military brass to ensure that not a single detailwas out of line. Most of us underwent extensive searches on our way into andout of the building. There it was, probably the biggest secret in the world, in abunch of parts spread out on laboratory tables in the middle of Palo Alto soyou can imagine their concern.One downside to CARET was that it wasn't as well-connected as otheroperations undoubtedly were. I never got to see any actual extra-terrestrials(not even photos), and in fact never even saw one of their compete vehicles.99% of what I saw was related to the work at hand, all of which wasconducted within a very narrow context on individual artifacts only. Theremaining 1% came from people I met through the program, many of whichworking more closely with “the good stuff” or had in the past.In fact, what was especially amusing about the whole affair was the way thatour military management almost tried to act as if the technology we wereessentially reverse engineering wasn't extra-terrestrial at all. Aside from theword “ extra-terrestrial” itself, we rarely heard any other terms like “ alien” or“UFO” or “outer space” or anything. Those aspects were only mentionedbriefly when absolutely necessary to explain something. In many cases it wasnecessary to differentiate between the different races and their respectivetechnology, and they didn't even use the word “races”. They were referred tosimply as different “sources”.The TechnologyA lot of the technology we worked on was what you would expect, namelyantigravity. Most of the researchers on the staff with backgrounds inpropulsion and rocketry were military men, but the technology we weredealing with was so out of this world that it didn’t really matter all that muchwhat your background was because none of it applied. All we could hope to"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"do was use the vocabulary of our respective fields as a way to model theextremely bizarre new concepts we were very slowly beginning to understandas best we could. A rocket engineer doesn’t usually rub elbows much with acomputer scientist, but inside PACL, we were all equally mystified and wereready to entertain any and all ideas.The physicists made the most headway initially because out of all of our skills,theirs overlapped the most with the concepts behind this technology (althoughthat isn’t saying much!) Once they got the ball rolling though, we began tofind that many of the concepts found in computer science were applicable aswell, albeit in very vague ways. While I didn’t do a lot of work with theantigrav hardware myself, I was occasionally involved in the assessment ofhow that technology was meant to interface with its user.The antigrav was amazing, of course, as were the advances we were makingwith materials engineering and so on. But what interested me most then, andstill amazes me most to this day, was something completely unrelated. In fact,it was this technology that immediately jumped out at me when I saw theChad and Rajman photos, and even moreso in the Big Basin photos.The “Language”I put the word Language in quotes because calling what I am about todescribe a “language” is a misnomer, although it is an easy mistake to make.Their hardware wasn’t operated in quite the same way as ours. In ourtechnology, even today, we have a combination of hardware and softwarerunning almost everything on the planet. Software is more abstract thanhardware, but ultimately it needs hardware to run it. In other words, there’s noway to write a computer program on a piece of paper, set that piece of paperon a table or something, and expect it to actually do something. The mostpowerful code in the world still doesn’t actually do anything until a piece ofhardware interprets it and translates its commands into actions.But their technology is different. It really did operate like the magical piece ofpaper sitting on a table, in a manner of speaking. They had something akin toa language, that could quite literally execute itself, at least in the presence of avery specific type of field. The language, a term I am still using very loosely,is a system of symbols (which does admittedly very much resemble a writtenlanguage) along with geometric forms and patterns that fit together to formdiagrams that are themselves functional. Once they are drawn, so to speak, ona suitable surface made of a suitable material and in the presence of a certaintype of field, they immediately begin performing the desired tasks. It really didseem like magic to us, even after we began to understand the principlesbehind it.I worked with these symbols more than anything during my time at PACL,and recognized them the moment I saw them in the photos. They appear in avery simple form on Chad’s craft, but appear in the more complex diagramform on the underside of the Big Basin craft as well. Both are unmistakable,even at the small size of the Big Basin photos. An example of a diagram in thestyle of the Big Basin craft is included with this in a series of scanned pagesfrom the [mistitled] \"Linguistic Analysis Primer\". We needed a copy of thatdiagram to be utterly precise, and it took about a month for a team of six tocopy that diagram into our drafting program!Explaining everything I learned about this technology would fill up severalvolumes, but I will do my best to explain at least some of the concepts as longas I am taking the time to write all this down.First of all, you wouldn't open up their hardware to find a CPU here, and adata bus there, and some kind of memory over there. Their hardwareappeared to be perfectly solid and consistent in terms of material from oneside to the other. Like a rock or a hunk of metal. But upon [much] closerinspection, we began to learn that it was actually one big holographiccomputational substrate - each \"computational element\" (essentiallyindividual particles) can function independently, but are designed to functiontogether in tremendously large clusters. I say its holographic because you candivide it up into the smallest chunks you want and still find a scaled-down butcomplete representation of the whole system. They produce a nonlinearcomputational output when grouped. So 4 elements working together isactually more than 4 times more powerful than 1. Most of the internal\"matter\" in their crafts (usually everything but the outermost housing) is"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"actually this substrate and can contribute to computation at any time and inany state. The shape of these \"chunks\" of substrate also had a profound effecton its functionality, and often served as a \"shortcut\" to achieve a goal thatmight otherwise be more complex.So back to the language. The language is actually a \"functional blueprint\". Theforms of the shapes, symbols and arrangements thereof is itself functional.What makes it all especially difficult to grasp is that every element of each\"diagram\" is dependant on and related to every other element, which meansno single detail can be created, removed or modified independently. Humanslike written language because each element of the language can be understoodon its own, and from this, complex expressions can be built. However, their\"language\" is entirely context-sensitive, which means that a given symbolcould mean as little as a 1-bit flag in one context, or, quite literally, containthe entire human genome or a galaxy star map in another. The ability for asingle, small symbol to contain, not just represent, tremendous amounts ofdata is another counter-intuitive aspect of this concept. We quickly realizedthat even working in groups of 10 or more on the simplest of diagrams, wefound it virtually impossible to get anything done. As each new feature wasadded, the complexity of the diagram exponentially grew to unmanageableproportions. For this reason we began to develop computer-based systems tomanage these details and achieved some success, although again we foundthat a threshold was quickly reached beyond which even the supercomputersof the day were unable to keep up. Word was that the extra-terrestrials coulddesign these diagrams as quickly and easily as a human programmer couldwrite a Fortran program. It's humbling to think that even a network ofsupercomputers wasn't able to duplicate what they could do in their ownheads. Our entire system of language is based on the idea of assigningmeaning to symbols. Their technology, however, somehow merges the symboland the meaning, so a subjective audience is not needed. You can putwhatever meaning you want on the symbols, but their behavior andfunctionality will not change, any more than a transistor will functiondifferently if you give it another name.Here's an example of how complex the process is. Imagine I ask you toincrementally add random words to a list such that no two words use any ofthe same letters, and you must perform this exercise entirely in your head, soyou can't rely on a computer or even a pen and paper. If the first in the listwas, say, \"fox\", the second item excludes all words with the letters F, O andX. If the next word you choose is \"tree\", then the third word in the list can'thave the letters F, O, X, T, R, or E in it. As you can imagine, coming up witheven a third word might start to get just a bit tricky, especially since you can'teasily visualize the excluded letters by writing down the words. By the timeyou get to the fourth, fifth and sixth words, the problem has spiraled out ofcontrol. Now imagine trying to add the billionth word to the list (imagine alsothat we're working with an infinite alphabet so you don't run out of letters)and you can imagine how difficult it is for even a computer to keep up.Needless to say, writing this kind of thing \"by hand\" is orders of magnitudebeyond the capabilities of the brain.My background lent itself well to this kind of work though. I'd spent yearswriting code and designing both analog and digital circuits, a process that atleast visually resembled these diagrams in some way. I also had a personalaffinity for combinatorics, which served me well as I helped with the design ofsoftware running on supercomputers that could juggle the often trillions ofrules necessary to create a valid diagram of any reasonable complexity. Thisoverlapped quite a bit with compiler theory as well, a subject I always foundfascinating, and in particular compiler optimization, a field that wasn't half ofwhat it is today back then. A running joke among the linguistics team was thatBig-O notation couldn't adequately describe the scale of the task, so we'dsubstitute other words for \"big\". By the time I left I remember the consensuswas \"Astronomical-O\" finally did it justice.Like I said, I could go on for hours about this subject, and would love to writeat least an introductory book on the subject if it wasn't still completelyclassified, but that's not the point of this letter so I'll try to get back on track.The last thing I'd like to discuss is how I got copies of this material, what else Ihave in my possession, and what I plan to do with it in the future.My CollectionI worked at PACL from 1984 to 1987, by which time I was utterly burned out."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The sheer volume of details to keep in mind while working with the diagramswas enough to challenge anyone's sanity, and I was really at the end of myrope with the military's attitude towards our “ need to know”. Our ability to getwork done was constantly hampered by their reluctance to provide us with thenecessary information, and I was tired of bureaucracy getting in the way ofresearch and development. I left somewhere in the middle of a 3-month bellcurve in which about a quarter of the entire PACL staff left for similarreasons.I was also starting to disagree with the direction the leadership wanted to takeas far as the subject of extra-terrestrials went. I always felt that at least someform of disclosure would be beneficial, but as a lowly CARET engineer Iwasn't exactly in the position to call shots. The truth is, our management didn'teven want us discussing non-technical aspects of this subject (such as ethicalor philosophical issues), even among ourselves, as they felt it was enough of abreach of security to let civilians like us anywhere near this kind of thing inthe first place.So, about 3 months before I resigned (which was about 8 months before I wasreally out, since you don't just walk out of a job like that with a 2 weeknotice). I decided to start taking advantage of my position. As I mentionedearlier, my DoD experience got me into an internal management role soonerthan some of my colleagues, and after about a year of that kind of status, theoutgoing searches each night became slightly less rigorous. Normally, we wereto empty out any containers, bags or briefcases, then remove our shirt andshoes and submit to a kind of frisking. Work was never allowed to go homewith you, no matter who you were. For me, though, the briefcase search waseventually enough.Even before I actually decided to do it, I was sure that I would be able tosneak certain materials out with me. I wanted to do this because I knew theday would come when I would want to write something like this, and I knewI'd regret it until the day I died if I didn't at least leave the possibility open todo so. So I started photocopying documents and reports by the dozen. I'd thenput the papers under my shirt around my lower back, tucked enough into mybelt to ensure they wouldn't fall out. I could do this in any one of a few short,windowless hallways on some of the lower floors, which were among the fewplaces that didn't have an armged guard watching my every move. I'd walk inone end with a stack of papers large enough that when I came out the otherend with some of them in my shirt, there wouldn't be a visible difference inwhat I was holding. You absolutely cannot be too careful if you're going topull a stunt like this. As long as I walked carefully they wouldn't make acrinkling noise. In fact, the more papers I took, the less noise they made, sincethey weren't as flimsy that way. I'd often take upwards of 10-20 pages atonce. By the time I was done, I'd made out with hundreds of photocopies, aswell as a few originals and a large collection of original photographs.With this initial letter I have attached high resolution scans of the following:A page from an inventory review with a photo that appears to depict one ofthe parts found in the Rajman sighting and parts very similar to the Big BasincraftThe first 9 pages of one of our quarterly research reportsScans of the original photographs used in that report, since the photocopiesobscure most of the details5 pages from a report on our ongoing analysis of the “language”(inappropriately titled “linguistic analysis”), depicting the kind of diagram justbarely visible on the underside of the Big Basin craftThis material is the most relevant and explanatory I could find on short notice.Now that these are up, IF I decide to release more in the future, I'll be able totake my time and better search this rather large collection of mine that I'vesadly never organized. I'm not sure what I'll be doing with the rest of thecollection in the future. I suppose I'll wait and see how this all plays out, andthen play it by ear. There are certainly risks involved in what I'm doing, and ifI were to actually be identified and caught, there could be rather seriousconsequences. However, I've taken the proper steps to ensure a reasonablelevel of anonymity and am quite secure in the fact that the information I've sofar provided is by no means unique among many of the CARET participants.Besides, part of me has always suspected that the government relies on theoccasional leak like this, and actually wants them to happen, because itcontributes to a steady, slow-paced path towards revealing the truth of thismatter."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Since Leaving CARETLike I said, I left PACL in '87, but have kept in touch with a great many of myfriends and coworkers from those days. Most of us are retired by now, exceptof course for those of us that went on to get teaching jobs, but a few of us stillhear things through the grapevine.As for CARET itself, I'm not sure what's become of it. Whether it's still knownby the same name, I'm quite sure it's still active in some capacity, althoughwho knows where. I heard from a number of people that PACL closed upshop a few years after I left, but I've still yet to get a clear answer on whyexactly that happened. But I'm sure the kind of work we did there is still goingstrong. I've heard from a lot of friends that there are multiple sites like PACLin Sunnyvale and Mountain View, also disguised to look like unremarkableoffice space. But this is all second-hand information so you can make of itwhat you will.Around 2002 or so I came across Coast to Coast AM and have been hookedever since. I admit, I don't take most of the show's content as anything morethan entertainment, but there have been occasions when I could be sure aguest was clearly speaking from experience or a well-informed source. Forme, there's just something very surreal about hearing all this speculation andso-called inside information about UFOs and the like, but being personallyable to verify at least some of it as being true or false. It's also a nightlyreminder of how hectic things were in those days, which helps me enjoy myretirement all the more. Knowing I'm not part of that crazy world anymorereally is something I enjoy on a daily basis, as much as I miss some of it.ConclusionWhat I've shared so far is only a very small portion of what I have, and what Iknow. Despite the very sheltered and insulated atmosphere within CARET, Idid ultimately learn a great deal from various colleagues, and some of what Ilearned is truly incredible. I'd also like to say that for what it's worth, duringmy time there I never heard anything about invasions, or abductions, or manyof the more frightening topics that often pop up on Coast to Coast AM. That'snot to say that none of it is true, but in my time working alongside some of themost well-connected people in this field, it never came up. So at the very leastI can say my intent is not to scare anyone. My view on the extra-terrestrialsituation is very much a positive, albiet still highly secretive one.One thing I can definitely say is that if they wanted us gone, we would havebeen gone a very, very long time ago, and we wouldn't even have seen itcoming. Throw out your ideas about a space war or anything silly like that.We'd be capable of fighting back against them about as much as ants couldfight back against a stampede of buffalo. But that's OK. We're the primitiverace, they're the advanced races, and that's just the way it is. The otheradvanced races let them live through their primitive years back in their day,and there's no reason to think it will be any different for us. They aren't in themarket for a new planet, and even if they were, there are way too manyplanets out there for them to care about ours enough to take it by force.To reiterate my take on the recent sightings, I'd guess that experimentationdone in the last couple months on a device that, among other things, is capableof interfering with various crafts onboard invisibility has resulted in a suddenwave of sightings. It may not explain all of the recent events, but like I said,I'd bet my life that's exactly what happened at Big Basin at least, and it'sprobably related in some way to the Chad, Rajman and Tahoe sightings. So,despite all the recent fanfare over this, I'd say this doesn't mean much. Mostimportantly, they aren't suddenly “here”. They've been here for a long time,but just happened to turn unintentionally visible for brief periods recently.Lastly, there are so many people selling books, and DVDs, and doing lectures,and all that, that I would like to reiterate the fact that I am not here to sellanything. The material I'm sharing is free to distribute provided it's all keptintact and unmodified, and this letter is included. I tend to question themotives of anyone charging money for their information, and will assure youthat I will never do such a thing. And in the future, just to cover all the bases,anyone claiming to be me who's selling a DVD or book is most certainly notgoing to be me.Any future releases from me will come from the email address I've used tocontact Coast to Coast AM, and will be sent to them only. I'd like to make thisclear as well to ensure that people can be sure that any future information"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"comes from the same source, although I must be clear: at this time I do nothave any future plans for additional information. Time will tell how long I willmaintain this policy, but do not expect anything soon. I'd really like to let thisinformation “settle” for a while and see how it goes. If I find out I'm getting anIRS audit tomorrow, then maybe this wasn't too smart. Until then, I'm going totake it slow. I hope this information has been helpful.Continued in Part 2: Documentation, Palo Alto Caret Laboratory Q4-86 ResearchReportMore Information:For further information about the dragonfly-shaped \"drones,\" please see Earthfiles reportsbelow indexed under Environment:• 06/26/2007 — Part 2: Documentation, Palo Alto Caret Laboratory Q4-86 Research Report• 06/26/2007 — Part 1: Explanation of the Recent \"Strange Craft\" Sightings• 06/22/2007 — Dragonfly \"Drone\" Seen October 1995 in Arizona• 06/18/2007 — Writing In Chad \"Drone\" Image - A Link to NASA Clementine 1 Moon Mission?• 06/17/2007 — More Big Basin, California, Bizarre \"Drone\" Images• 06/15/2007 — Part 1: Northridge, California, Aerial \"Drone\" Eyewitness On the Record• 06/15/2007 — Part 2 - Star Wars Physicist Edward Teller, Outer Space Menace And Remotely PilotedVe hi c l e s ( RPVs )• 06/08/2007 — More Drone Photos and Other Eyewitnesses• 06/08/2007 — More Drone Photos and Other Eyewitnesses• 05/30/2007 — Birmingham-Type \"Drone\" Seen At Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, in Mid-1980s• 05/28/2007 — Letters About Unidentified \"Drone\" Aerial Objects• 05/25/2007 — Two More Eyewitnesses of Aerial \"Drones\" in 2005 and 2006• 05/21/2007 — Updated: Odd Aerial \"Drone\"?
