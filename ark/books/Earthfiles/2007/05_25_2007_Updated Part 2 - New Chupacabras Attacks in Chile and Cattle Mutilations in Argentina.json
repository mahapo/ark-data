It sounded strong and dragged its wings, walkingquickly and making a thundering noise, as though it were very heavy. It's justlike the last time. The same happened years ago - we heard the same noises onthe roof,\" explained Margarita Ugalde.The family's chickens, kept in the backyard, were nervous and making loudcrowing sounds, as though something was happening to them. One by one, thebirds went quiet. Seven out of ten chickens were killed.\"I went to the backyard and I saw it. It was like a large bird, standing about ameter, with the bearing of a dwarf. It has feathers, wings and left footprintslike those of a goat. It was looking for food, and I think it must've beenhungry,\" she explained.When the subject of the Chupacabras first emerged into public awareness,Margarita Ugalde experienced a similar situation - the same noises on the roofand the killings of animals. In that occasion, they were among those whoexperienced the greatest number of losses.The woman is afraid. She is terrified by this experience. However, she feelssad about her hens, which she had raised from chicks. The birds present oneor two small perforations, some on the neck, others on the wings or legs, butthe similarity they share is that they are completely dry, without a drop ofblood. The family decided to call Carabineros (Chilean State Police) to inspectthe site in case there was something to be found.\"They told us it was that (the Chupacabras) and that they had never seenanything like it. They were overwhelmed as well,\" said the woman."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"When the strange animal passed over the roof and reached the backyard, itbroke the henhouse door and extracted the birds one by one, for a total ofseven. When he was surprised by the homeowner, the Chupacabras took off,flying toward the hills.\"May 25, 2007 Sumampa, Argentina - Beginning in 2002, there has been a wave ofanimal mutilations in Argentina. Authorities estimate there have been more than 3000cases. Now again this April to May 2007, there have been cattle mutilation reports fromArgentina and new chupacabras reports from Chile.Specialists from Argentina's federal INTA agency(similar to USDA's Food Safety Inspection Service) are inspectinga mutilated cow in the La Pampa province in late June 2002. More than 3,000mutilated cows, horses and other farm animals have been reported to local authoritiesin seven provinces. Image © 2002 by Rio Negro Online, Argentina.This month I received another Argentina cattle mutilation report from investigatorGuillermo D. Gimenez with a photo from El Porrón near the Saladillo and Dulce Rivers.The translation below was provided by Scott Corrales, Director of the Institute of HispanicUfology and editor of Inexplicata in Bradford, Pennsylvania. Scott has been translatingSpanish newspaper articles about UFO and often associated unusual animal deaths sincethe wave of mutilations began in Argentina and Chile.El Porron is a small, rural village a little over 31 miles from Sumampa, Argentina. \"Cattle Mutilations in Argentina Cause AlarmDate: 05/11/07Source: Nuevo Diario We bTranslation by Scott Corrales, Inexplicata\"In El Porrón, Department of Mitre, five heads of cattle turned up mutilated,causing concern among the residents of this location 50 kilometers (31 miles)distant from the city of Sumampa. The mutilated animals include four heifersand one calf, who were missing their tongues udders, eyes and tails."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Photograph of one of the El Porron mutilated cattle provided byArgentina animal mutilation investigator, Guillermo D. Gimenez.\"They were found some three hundred meters (186 miles) from the home offarmer Julio Farias, who explained that 'it has been a week since we found theanimals, and they haven't shown any signs of decomposition. Birds of prey areonly now starting to approach the location.' Another notable condition is thatno traces of blood were found at the site, or traces of having struggled againstan attack. These animals were mutilated.\"It should be noted with the Dulce River having reached its flood stage, thesefields were completely flooded and covered in mud after the water level wentdown. If there had been any attack, footprints should have been left behind.This is the first time that such a strange event has occurred and local residentscannot find an answer to events like this, which are not a regular occurrencehere.\"Recently I talked with Scott Corrales about the Argentine government's effort in July 2002to explain away all the increasing cattle mutilations in half a dozen provinces by an officialpress release that said the perpetrators of all the dead animals were \"red-nosed mice ...whose nutritional habits had changed to eating cattle.\" Even veterinarians there laughed atthe government's explanation as preposterous. The veterinarians knew they had seenexcisions on animals that showed signs of high heat as if cauterized and no red-nosed micecould do that!Oxymcterus, \"hocicudo rojizo\" (red muzzle), a rodent now officially blamedby Argentina federal officials for the animal mutilations in Argentina since April 2002.Photograph provided by SENASA, Buenos Aires.Interview:Scott Corrales, Director, Institute of Hispanic Ufology and Editor, Explicata, (M. A.Spanish Literature, Rutgers Univ.) Bradford, Pennsylvania: \"There are a number ofprint and electronic sources that have appeared in Argentina, which have not been afraidto convey information about mutilations, even after the government accused them of fearmongering after the 2002 wave of cattle mutilations.WHEN THE ARGENTINA GOVERNMENT TROTTED OUT THE RED-SNOUTEDMOUSE AS THE EXPLANATION?!"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"That’s correct. They figured, ‘Look, we’ve already given you the answer to this mystery.If you insist on suggesting there is something beyond this, you’re creating a panic and youcould be liable.SO, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN AFRAID TO REPORT MUTILATIONS ... EVEN WITHTHE FACT THAT MORE THAN 3,000 CASES HAVE BEEN REPORTED OVER THELAST FIVE YEARS?Absolutely! Many of these farmers, we’re talking about very small land owners here.Sometimes you are talking about huge ranches, but the concept of insuring your herd – notan issue. Most of these people lose the animals and they have lost livelihood. They figure,‘Let’s not get ourselves involved in government trouble and add to our misery.’But in this case from the Nuevo Diario Web, in El Porron – a town in Mitre Province – acause for concern among the residents of this location 50 kilometers distant from the cityof Sumampa.The victims in this case involved 4 heifers and 1 calf and this has occurred in many othercases. The cattle were missing tongues, udders, eyes and tails. The dead animals werefound 300 meters from the home of (984 feet) from farmer Julio Farias who explained, ‘ithas been a week since we found the animals and they have not shown any signs ofdecomposition. Birds of prey are only now starting to approach the location.’ (Predatorsstaying away) has been a common factor throughout Argentina and Chile.Part of the article mentions that the Dulce River, which runs through that area, has been atits flood stage and as the flood waters have receded, a lot of mud and loam have been leftin its wake in sufficient quantities so you should be able to see any kind of prints/tracks byanyone who tried to approach the animals. This has not been the case.SO WE HAVE ANOTHER ANIMAL MUTILATION INCIDENT WHERE WE HAVEFIVE ANIMALS THAT ARE MISSING THEIR TONGUES, UDDERS, TAILS ANDEYES AND THERE IS NO BLOOD ON THE BODIES OR AROUND THE BODIESAND NO SIGNS OF TRACKS, EVEN IN WET SOIL.That is correct. \"Winged Chupacabras\" in ChileOriginal drawing © 2005 by Madelyne Tolentino on September 12, 1995,in Puerto Rico, of a creature that walked in front of her house at a timewhen bloodless puncture attacks of farm animals were occurring."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"A Puerto Rico dog attacked by the chupacabras entity,which left bloodless holes in its belly.Every two years, we seem to get a resurgence of these cases. I think it was back in 2003 or2004 we had those cases in Chile, not Argentina, involving the winged simian creaturesthat attacked a farmer in Chile.Perhaps the most impressive of these cases involving this particular type of mutilating-creature associated with mutilations occurred in Chile when a university professor heardnoises coming from the courtyard of her apartment building at 1:30 am. When she went tolook, she sees, ‘An immense man 2 meters tall (6.5 feet) with shoulder blades split as if ithad wings.’The following day, interestingly enough, she found a dead dog with puncture marks in itsneck in the courtyard. So that entity was clearly exsanguinations with something in thatlocation.THIS IS A BIGGER HUMANOID FORM WITH WINGS, WHICH IS YET AGAINDIFFERENT FROM THE SMALLER BAT-SIZE WITH WINGS THAT WEREREPORTED IN PUERTO RICO AND WOULD SEEM TO HAVE BEEN REPORTED INAPRIL 2007 WITH THE NEWSPAPERS REPORTING, ‘THE CHUPACABRASRETURNS TO CHILE.’This is correct. The chupacabras cases - there is a seasonality to them. Do they come outof hibernation? Are we talking about real creatures? Physical creatures? Is that the timethey can actually slip into our reality and do whatever activities they have to carry out?Thinking back to the first chupacabras wave in Puerto Rico (1995), the cases involvingsightings of strange creatures always seemed to begin in April. And usually peter out sayAugust or September, except in that first time around of 1995, those creatures that wereseen at first over the summer were never reported again. And then in August 1995, youstarted getting the traditional chupcabras with the spines down the back.AND THAT’S THE ONE THAT STANDS AND WALKS AND CAN GO DOWN TOFOUR LEGS AND SPRING, WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM THE BLACK BAT-LIKEWHATEVER IT IS.Absolutely correct.WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE TIME LINE FROM 1995 TO 2007 AND REPORTSOF TWO KINDS OF CHUPCABRAS ATTACKS THAT MAKE PUNCTURE HOLESTHAT DO NOT BLEED IN A WIDE VARIETY OF ANIMALS AND PARALLEL THATON ANOTHER TRACK WITH GENERALLY LARGE ANIMALS LIKE COWS,HORSES, SHEEP AND GOATS BEING SUBJECTED TO THE CLASSIC ANIIMALMUTIILATION OF THE EAR, EYE, TONGUE, JAW FLESH, GENITALS ANDRECTUM TISSUE REMOVED WITHOUT BLOOD OR TRACKS. Why A Focus On Argentina and Chile?WHY DO YOU THINK THERE HAS BEEN A FOCUS OF THOSE TWO PHENOMENASPECIFICALLY IN ARGENTINA AND CHILE?That’s a very good question and I guess would have to do with Argentina and Chile havebeen focuses of strange phenomena going back at least until the 1950s. Lets say these are,as many have suggested, some kind of extraterrestrial force."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"IN ARGENTINA, THERE ARE BASICALLY 6 PROVINCES WHERE THERE HASBEEN THE FOCUS OF THE ANIMAL MUTILATIONS IIN ARGENTINA. ARE THOSE6 PROVINCES WHERE ALL OF THE CATTLE IS RAISED IN ARGENTINA?Most things seem to be reported in La Pampa and Rio Negro and as you start going fromthe Buenos Aires area on down into Patagonia. That’s the region where you get most ofyour cases.If you go back to cases translated by an excellent correspondent in Santa Rosa, Argentina(Mr. Chavez), the city of Santa Rosa and that entire area for 50 to 75 miles around is oneof the very strange parts of the world that seems to attract any kind of weirdness to it.They have UFO cases; they have cases where small private planes can’t find their wayback to the local airport because they report the terrain beneath them has changedcompletely. You have your chupacabras cases, you have the cattle mutilation cases back in2002, cases involving witchcraft, cases involving ritual magic. You have so much stuff inthat one particular area.Back in 2002, it became a litany – if it was not Santa Rosa it was General Acha wherethere is a particular stretch of road that seems to be the place where people reporteverything from UFO sightings to strange creature sightings. Do Other Intelligences Use Earth's Magnetic FieldsCOULD THERE BE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ELECTOMAGNETICFIELDS OF THIS PLANET - THAT SOME CAN COLLAPSE AT POINTS AND IFTHERE ARE COLLAPSES IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPIC AREAS BECAUSE OFGEOGRAPHIC ANOMALIES, MAYBE IT ALLOWS PARALLEL TIME, PARALLELUNIVERSE, SOMETHING ELSE IS ALLOWED TO COME IN WHERE MAGNETICFIELDS ARE NOT STABLE?If you look at the map of mutilations back in 2002, a lot of the cases seemed to beoccurring in almost a straight line. Perhaps they were following some kind of fault, as youjust suggested, where there was a weakening of some kind of energy or a ley line of somesort. It was very interesting. The animal mutilations all seemed to be lined up. Phenomenon of Mutilated AnimalsPlaced in Straight LinesRIGHT, AND THAT LINING UP OF DEAD ANIMALS HAS OCCURRED IN THEUNITED STATES AS WELL.

As the creaturesattacked the lambs, they were described as laughing grotesquely. One of the creaturespunched a lamb until it fell to the ground. This is something that had not been seenpreviously in any incidents involving strange creatures and farm animals.What I found stranger still in this report was that the six onlookers were said to be in astate of stupor throughout the event, unable to react, unable to do anything about it, justhelpless onlookers as their animals were being attacked by these strange creatures.Also in Chile, there were chupacabras attacks and sightings and mutilations. In someinstances, you had school children on their way back home who reported seeing ‘ananimal’ jump off a rooftop at them and confront them and block their path.The interesting thing in this particular close encounter was that the chupacabras entity withglowing eyes was hovering off the ground after it jumped off the roof.
