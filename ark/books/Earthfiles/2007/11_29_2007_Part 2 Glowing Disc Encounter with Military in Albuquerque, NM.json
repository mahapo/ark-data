McKeever, in August 1984 at age 18, was accepted into U. S. Army Reservesat Ft. Leonard Wood, Company D44, Missouri.Ten years after the Sandia hills event, Paul McKeever at age 18 enlisted in the U. S. ArmyReserves in August 1984. He is pictured here on far left. Paul was sent for basic training atFt. Leonard Wood in Missouri where he trained with Company Delta 44 (Battalion 4,Brigade 4).Paul often remembered – during his own military training - how the soldiers in 1974 werestanding facing the disc as if on guard. He studied art in college and drew this scene frommemory. He knew that the disc he and his Mom and Aunt had seen “was not ours” and hefigured it was extraterrestrial.Illustration of May 1974 military security surrounding white, glowing discin the Sandia hills of the Cibola National Forest at the eastern edge of Albuquerque,carrying M-16 weapons and wearing hard hats. Graphic © 2007 by Paul McKeever. Paul asked a friend who had served in the Air Force at Kirtland if he had ever seen any“strange things” in Coyote Canyon. The friend answered that once in 1989 on guard duty,he was at Coyote Canyon sitting in an Air Force truck reading a book. Suddenly, he wasnervous and “felt the hair on the back of my neck rise up.” He looked in his rear view"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"mirror. Two, glowing red eyes were staring at him. He said he tried calmly to put his bookdown, turn the key in the ignition and drove away.Coyote Canyon (red underline) is the access to (red circle) ERDA (Energy Researchand Development Administration) where nuclear weapons are storedinside the Manzanos between Coyote and Lurance Canyons.Few people knew at the time that Coyote Canyon - red underlined at bottom center ofabove map - in the Manzano Mountains east of Albuquerque, and not far from Chilili, wasthe access road to the highly guarded secret of nuclear weapons stored inside theManzanos by E.R.D.A. - marked by red circle - the U. S. Energy Research andDevelopment Administration – which includes the Lurance Canyon Burn Site andExplosive, Electro-Explosive, and Aerial Cable Test Facilities. Is that what attracted theattention of the non-terrestrial disc technologies? The map below shows the closegeographical relationship of Coyote Canyon and the ERDA nuclear missiles stored insidethe Manzano Mountain to Kirtland Air Force Base, Chilili and where the white dischovered in the Sandia hills east of Menaul and Tramway Boulevards.Red line on map is Menaul Boulevard that intersects with Tramway Boulevard N. E. Paul McKeeverand his family drove out a dirt trail beyond Menaul to a rocky hill where the white, glowing disc wassurrounded by military security carrying M-16s. Map by Linda Moulton Howe.Coyote Canyon and Manzano Mountains facing west.Another colleague of the Air Force man said he was driving up Coyote Canyon in the1980s, came around a hill and there was a disc hovering in an open area next to the road.Paul McKeever also wondered what kind of military operation was able to be already onguard around the glowing, white disc by the time he and his family got to the Sandia hillsdirt trail? And why wasn’t there TV, newspaper and radio news the next day on May 29,1974, about the amazing disc landing in the Sandia Hills. He and his family knew that otherpeople in other cars were turned away like they were – but everyone could see the military"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"ringing the white, glowing disc.Front Page, Albuquerque Journal, Wednesday Morning, May 29, 1974.Paul, his Mom and I searched the Albuquerque Journal microfilm over an entire 12-monthperiod from May 1973 to June 1974. We started a microfilm search soon after our April 1,1974, trip together to the Sandia Hills. Paul was certain the event was late spring 1974,when he was 8-years-old and in third grade. His mom and aunt wondered if Paul mighthave been in 2nd grade in 1973. So we decided to search the whole 12 months time spanfrom May 1973 to June 1974.When we began our microfilm search, I had not learned anything about the May 17, 1974,Chilili alleged crash and the NICAP reports about glowing discs seen in the morning ofMay 28, 1974. But by mid-summer 2007, I did learn about the May 17, 1974, Chililireport. So, I asked Paul and his mom to especially check the Albuquerque Journal's May1974 microfilm. Paul’s mom, Rebecca McKeever Armstrong, called to tell me she found ablocked out section on May 29, 1974. But the library was closing and she didn’t have timeto get a photograph of the page. So, I went to the Albuquerque Journal microfilm library.On Page C-20, is “The Daily Record” dated May 29, 1974, and in the lower half of thepage was a block out card.Albuquerque Journal, Page C-20, \"The Daily Record,\" May 29, 1974.But the next three pages in the microfilm were identical copies of Page C-20 without the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"blocking card. I went to the librarian and asked why there was a blocking card on one pagefollowed by three perfectly readable pages. He had no explanation and seemed puzzledhimself.One of three identical C-20, May 29, 1974, pages that follow each other in the microfilmwithout the blocking card, but each clearly readable in the microfilm machine.Is it possible that an agent of the American government, under orders, went to theAlbuquerque Journal publisher and said, “In the interest of national security, we need youto change Page C-20 of your May 29, 1974, issue?” I know there was selective removal ofcertain newspapers in the 1947 to 1949 time period in New Mexico because a decade ago,I called every New Mexico library I could find and asked for specific newspaper dates.Over and over I was told by various librarians that no newspapers could be found forcertain dates in the 1940s throughout the state of New Mexico. Another specific incidentthat suggests selective sanitizing is Aztec, New Mexico. At least one family rememberedreading a local newspaper about a disc crashing in Hart Canyon back in March of 1948only 9 months after the crashed disc headlines of July 1947. Many people in Farmingtonand Aztec have looked for such an historic newspaper, but so far, none have been found. How Did Military Security Get tothe Sandia Hills Disc So Quickly?Back to Albuquerque on May 28, 1974 - how did military security get to the Sandia hillslocation with rifles and equipment while the disc was still being seen in the sky by thefamily chasing after it in the car? And how would powers-that-be pull off a media blackoutafter 770 KKOB broadcast the first news alert that Sandy Rivers and Rebecca McKeeverArmstrong heard?The answers appear to have been written down in detail twenty years earlier in the April1954 U. S. War Office printing of the Restricted SOM1-01 Majestic-12 Group SpecialOperations Manual entitled “Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology, Recovery andDisposal” - classified TOP SECRET/MAJIC EYES ONLY."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"April 1954 U. S. War Office printing of the Restricted SOM1-01Majestic-12 Group Special Operations Manual.[ Editor's Note: See 111903 Earthfiles - Reasons SOM1-01 Manual IsAuthentic. The training manual first appeared as 35mm black and whitenegative film in a package addressed to Don Berliner of the Fund for UFOResearch in Maryland. The package was postmarked March 7, 1994 fromLaCrosse, Wisconsin, and bore a return address of a pharmacy in LaCrosse.On the 35mm film were thirty-two pages of text and drawings and the fingersof whoever photographed the pages of the TOP SECRET/MAJIC classifiedmanual.Bob Wood had a 43-year-long career as an aerospace engineer, first workingfor Douglas Aircraft that merged with the McDonnell Corporation in 1967 tobecome McDonnell-Douglas, later purchased by Boeing in the early 1990s.Over those four decades, Bob Wood worked on aerodynamic heating, ballisticmissile defense, radar, and the space station before his retirement in 1993.That year, nuclear physicist and UFO researcher, Stanton Friedman, had seenthe 35mm negative in Berliner's possession and contacted Bob to see if hewould be interested in researching what was on the film.Bob Wood agreed and a decade later says, \"Basically what was on the 35mmnegative is a 32-page manual dated 1954 which describes for special fieldunits how to recover crashed flying saucers, how to take them apart, how topack them, where to ship them, how to take care of the bodies and how tokeep the public in the dark.\"]"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Page 8, SOM1-01 Manual, Chapter 3, Recovery Operations,Section I. SECURITY, Section 12. Press Blackout.On page 8 of the SOM1-01 manual, is Chapter 3, Recovery Operations, Section “I.”SECURITY, Se ction 12. P ress Bla ckout: “Great care must be taken to preserve the security of any location whereExtraterrestrial Technology might be retrievable for scientific study. Extrememeasures must be taken to protect and preserve any material or craft fromdiscovery, examination, or removal by civilian agencies or individuals in thegeneral public. It is therefore recommended that a total press blackout beinitiated whenever possible. If this course of action should not prove feasible,the following cover stories are suggested for release to the press. The officerin charge will act quickly to select the cover story that best fits the situation. Itshould be remembered when selecting a cover story that official policyregarding UFOBs is that they do not exist.a. Official Denial. The most desirable response would be that nothing unusualhas occurred. By stating that the government has no knowledge of the event,further investigation by the public press may be forestalled.b. Discredit Witnesses. If at all possible, witnesses will be heldincommunicado until the extent of their knowledge and involvement can bedetermined.”Now, that did not happen in the Sandia Hills – perhaps because by 1974, the U. S.government had achieved considerable success since at least the early 1940s withmisinformation to cover up UFO incidents “in the interest of national security.” SoMajestic-12 authorities probably felt that the manipulated public and media wereconditioned enough that police authority could turn the half dozen cars and citizens awaywithout explanation. It was also near-dark and most of Albuquerque indoors would beunaware, unless they heard the 770 KKOB news alert. MJ-12’s educated assumptionwould be that police intimidation would be enough to keep people quiet. Apparently thatassumption was right in May 1974.The SOM1-01 manual continues with exactly that point:“Witnesses will be discouraged from talking about what they have seen, andintimidation may be necessary to ensure their cooperation. If witnesses havealready contacted the press, it will be necessary to discredit their stories. This"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"can best be done by the assertion that they have either misinterpreted naturalevents, are the victims of hysteria or hallucinations, or are the perpetrators ofhoaxes.c. Deceptive Statements. It may become necessary to issue false statements topreserve the security of the site. Meteors, downed satellites, weather balloonsand military aircraft are all acceptable alternatives, although in the case of thedowned military aircraft statement, care should be exercised not to suggestthat the aircraft might be experimental or secret, as this might arouse morecuriosity of both the American and the foreign press. Statements issuedconcerning contamination of the area due to toxic spills from trucks orrailroad tankers can also serve to keep unauthorized or undesirable personnelaway from the area.Section 13. Secure the AreaThe area must be secured as rapidly as possible to keep unauthorizedpersonnel from infiltrating the site.

Perimeter. It is desirable that sufficient military personnel be utilized to setup a perimeter around the site large enough to keep both unauthorizedpersonnel and the perimeter personnel from seeing the site.”"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"b. Complete or Functional Craft. Craft are to be approached with extremecaution if they appear functional, as serious injury may result from exposureto radiation and electrical discharges.”That text would explain why the military security at the Sandia hill site stayed back fromthe glowing, white disc.Whatever was happening from morning to evening on May 28, 1974, between the discintelligence and Kirtland AFB, the various discs reported that day did not seem under ourgovernment’s control. Perhaps the speed with which the military security reached theSandia hills location, however, is because some kind of meeting or event had beenanticipated all day long and the security team was ready to go wherever and whenever.Another uncontrolled part of the May 28, 1974, event seems to be 770 KKOB Radio. Theguess is that an innocent Albuquerque resident called the station to report a white, glowingdisc moving over the city. Maybe even a KKOB employee walked outside and could seethe glowing disc for themselves, just as Paul McKeever and his mom, aunt and cousinscould see. Perhaps the KKOB news report triggered the other half dozen families who alsodrove to Sandia Hills. Or, the other UFO chasers had been outside, saw the glowing disc inthe night sky and out of curiosity, chased after it like Rebecca McKeever Armstrong withher sister, Sandy Rivers and the kids.Continuing with the SOM1-01 document about securing the perimeter aroundextraterrestrial craft:“Once the site is contained, regular patrols will be set up along the perimeterto assure complete security, and electronic surveillance will be utilized toaugment the patrols. Perimeter personnel will be equipped with handcommunication and automatic weapons with live ammunition. Personnelworking at the site will carry sidearms. No unauthorized personnel will beallowed into the secure area.c. Area Sweep. The site and the surrounding area will be cleared of allunauthorized personnel. Witnesses will be debriefed and detained for furtherevaluation by MJ-12. Under no circumstances will witnesses be released fromcustody until their stories have been evaluated by MJ-12 and they have beenthoroughly debriefed.”The fact that none of the people in the cars at the Sandia hills disc site were stopped, heldand interrogated would seem to be because MJ-12 knew a lot more about the disc andwhat the military security were looking for around the disc than any of the eyewitnesses.So, less interaction with the witnesses was preferable. If there had been any attempt in1974 to hold and interrogate those Albuquerque residents, that would certainly havereached the media.Continuing with the SOM1-01 document:“c. Situation Evaluation. A preliminary evaluation of the situation will becompleted and a preliminary report prepared. The MJ-12 Group will then bebriefed on the situation at the earliest possible opportunity. The MJ-12 Groupwill then make a determination as to whether or not an MJ-12 RED TEAM orOPNAC Team will be dispatched to the area.”The closest identification of the acronym OPNAC I have been able to find is OperationsNaval Command. The MJ-12 Red Teams, from off-the-record sources I’ve interviewedwere controlled and operated by the CIA. But I can’t prove that on the record. However, Ithink it was OPNAC and MJ-12 CIA Red Teams that so suddenly appeared 40 miles southof Brownsville, Texas, on August 25, 1974 – only three months after the Sandia hills discand military event."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Coyame, Mexico (red circle map bottom) is about 200 miles southeast of El Paso, Texas.That’s the alleged Coyame, Chihuahua, Mexico, disc collision with a small plane about200 miles southeast of El Paso and not far from White Sands.UFO Casebook Archives wrote about that 1974 Mexico incident, “The radio interceptionswere reported through channels to the CIA. Possibly as many as two additionalgovernment agencies also received reports, but such has not been confirmed. The CIAimmediately began forming a recovery team. The speed with which this team and itsequipment were assembled suggests that this was either a well-rehearsed exercise or onethat had been performed prior to this disc crash. Requests were initiated at the highestlevels between the United States and Mexican governments so the U. S. recovery teamcould be allowed onto Mexican territory to “assist.”Mexico flatly refused, but allegedly the CIA persisted and retrieved the disc for transportback to an unnamed base in Atlanta, Georgia. UFO Casebook says this was possiblebecause the CIA team was monitoring by satellite the Mexican military transport of thecrashed disc on the back of a flatbed truck. The convoy stopped and truck doors opened.Allegedly the CIA team found all the Mexican military security personnel dead and burnedevery body at the site before transporting the disc in a sealed transport of some kind backto the United States.This might also explain why a Corona, New Mexico, rancher once told me there was a\"horrible secret\" from the Roswell UFO July 1947 crashes. It might relate to a disturbingevent that would also have provoked the Truman Administration's decision to keep all thereal facts about UFOs and what was in them from the press and public. In the year 1952,Truman's appointed Majestic-12 Special Studies Group issued its first annual report as \"AReview of the President's Special Panel to Investigate the Capture of UnidentifiedPlanform Space Vehicles by U. S. Armed Forces and Agencies.\"Majestic-12 Project, 1st Annual Report, 1952, about“the capture of unidentified planform space vehicles by U. S. Armed Forces and Agencies.”See www.majesticdocuments.com for whole documents."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" Annex A, Paragraph 8., Page 9, Majestic-12 Project, 1st Annual Report, 1952.In Annex A, Paragraph 8, Page 9 of the TOP SECRET MJ-12 report it states:“8. The Panel was concerned over the contamination of several SEDpersonnel upon coming in contact with debris near the power plant of the craftsecurity. One technician was overcome and collapsed when he attempted theremoval of a body, referring to non-human. Another medical technician wentinto a coma only four hours after placing a body in a rubber body-bag. Allfour men were rushed to Los Alamos for observation. All four later died ofseizures and profuse bleeding. All four were wearing protective suits whenthey came in contact with body fluids from the occupants.”Maybe that’s also what happened to the Mexico military security in Chihuahua state onAugust 25, 1974. Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit Summary,Classified TOP SECRET ULTRAAdding to the sobering details of what military security found at non-human aerial disccrash sites, here is another important document, Interplanetary Phenomenon UnitSummary. It is dated September 4, 1960, by the authority of Lt. General John A. Samford,Director, National Security Agency, and approved by Allen Dulles, Director of the CentralIntelligence Agency, and stamped TOP SECRET MAJIC ULTRA. This is one of thedocuments leaked to Bob and Ryan Wood in their accumulation of files on Majestic-12.The IPU Summary includes a reference to “bodies found not far from LZ-1 that looked asif they had been dissected as you would a frog. It is not known if army field surgeons hadperformed exploratory surgery on those bodies. Animal parts were reportedly discoveredinside the craft at LZ-2, but this cannot be confirmed.”Page 6, Paragraph 12, Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit Summary, September 4, 1960. I am hoping that others will contact me who were also in Albuquerque, New Mexico, onMay 28, 1974, at the Sandia hills on the eastern edge of the city beyond Menaul andTramway Boulevards, watching the glowing disc surrounded by military - or were one ofthe military security police.
