Out of print.Return to Part 1December 18, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Procurement of Civilians for ExperimentationThere is no problem obtaining injured or sick people for experimentation bythe committee. Thousands who have no immediate family or friends fill therooms of nursing homes and state hospitals. This was the pool of choice forthe committee. The nursing homes were chosen over the hospitals because, asone committee member said, “They are like warehouses of the damned. Thelucky ones are barely conscious of their surroundings. Many are only alivebecause of all the drugs that are pumped into them daily.”Whatever the committee did with these people was more humane than the lifethey were living while at the nursing home. Taking them out of the nursinghome was in a sense “like rescuing them.” Even when they were in failinghealth and barely conscious, they always perked up when one of thetechnicians working for the committee came there to pick them up.They were a pitiful sight. No one on the committee had any intention ofadding to their misery, so only those who were not conscious of their"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"surroundings and dying were used to experiment on. When someone wasmiraculously healed from their ailments, they were taken back to the nursinghome. This happened several times. That was a dilemma for the committee.None of the rejuvenated elderly wanted to return to the nursing home. Thecommittee was not set up to re-establish the lives of the cured individuals andhad little choice. The committee had never expected to have so manyrejuvenated people.Returning people who were froth with problems of the aging when they weretaken away and then returned healthier than most of the attendants whoworked there eventually caught the attention of the media. That one episodenearly uncovered what the committee had been doing. After that incident, thecommittee moved quickly and severed all links that could lead the events tothem. They then implemented a new policy which relocated those who werecured and gave them new identities.The elderly themselves never suspected a thing. They just assumed that whenthey became ill that paramedics came and took them to a local hospital. Theelderly patients had no reason to think otherwise. The media soon lost interestwhen they could not find anyone who could give them proof of whathappened. A few healthy old people with no story to tell was not enough tokeep the media interested. The Myth of Human AutonomyUnderstanding the Aliens was a slow and difficult process, but their bigproblem was not the Aliens, but the arrogance that had developed over theyears among committee members because of their untouchable status. Thescientists were not invincible, although that had become the mood. Whathappened at the nursing home could never have been tied to them. Thecommittee was under too many layers of bureaucracy. What concerned theirsuperiors was the possibility of the media giants taking a serious interest inwhat took place at the nursing home and snowballing into a full-blowninquiry, possibly forcing a Senate investigation.With the equipment the committee had in its possession, they had the meansto become more secretive than they already were. Technically, the scientistswere already invisible. Only a handful of people in the world know of theirexistence. But with the use of the Alien equipment, the committee wouldbecome “literally” invisible. For a time, the group was fearful of using thisability outside their protected base of operations. The scientists were afraidthat if they bungled a mission and exposed their operation, they - andultimately the whole organization - could be destroyed.The committee scientists are shadowed by what is appropriately called “theclean-up crew.” The job of that team is to dispose of them along with theirequipment should a mission be compromised.Killing one or all of the committee on the spot was not a last resort, but acertainty if the scientists were unable to be removed from the sceneexpediently. The part about “expediently” bothered the committee membersthe most. The men knew they were expendable, but they had no intention ofgetting themselves into a situation that jeopardized their lives. The otherreason the scientists delayed taking the Alien equipment off the base and intothe homes of unsuspecting civilians was due to their belief in the sanctity ofone's home. The ability to enter a person's home and go into their bedroomwithout their knowledge took getting used to.What made the whole thing palatable was that they were aware that they, aswell as thousands of other humans, are visited in this manner every day. Somecall it “ violated.” A few people in the general population know they are beingabducted, but the vast majority of humanity has no clue that it is happening tothem.The committee felt that they had no other choice but to enter that realm: aplace where up until then was inhabited by the Aliens alone.We humans place the highest value on privacy. We naively think that ourinnermost thoughts belong only to us. We are living a fantasy. Privacy of bodyand mind is a human delusion. The committee members know that and havecome to the conclusion that one cannot break a trust of a fellow human beingwhen truth and trust are also illusions."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The committee decided that nursing homes were still the safest place to testand experiment with the Alien equipment. This time, the scientists wouldattempt to abduct a person using the Alien equipment instead of having thehuman brought to them by conventional means as had happened in the past.The scientists gained entry by using the Alien device that allowed them topermeate solid objects and to walk through walls. The committee membersused an unmarked passenger van to carry them and the equipment theyneeded, which fit nearly into a briefcase. The nursing home they picked waslocated in a rural area. The committee did not have operatives at the nursinghome. This was a test to see how the Alien technology would perform in anuncontrolled environment. The scientists had simple instructions: abduct apatient and take her back to the base. Then two hours later return her to theexact spot where the scientists picked her up.Arriving at the site a few minutes after dark, one of the committee members -who drove in a separate unmarked car - entered the building first. He enteredthrough the front entrance, posed as a state health inspector, and told theattending nurse at the front desk that he was there to perform a “surprise”inspection. He was equipped with all the necessary credentials and if anyonecalled the health departments for verification, the phone call would have beenintercepted by committee members who monitor the calls coming and goingfrom that building.While he kept the staff distracted, three of the committee members, who werestill in the van, looked for a dark area close to the building where there wereno street lights. The scientists activated the Alien equipment and instantlypermeated through the brick wall. The men emerged in a room that wasoccupied by an elderly woman. She was sitting alone in a wheel chair in onecorner of the two-bedroom unit. There was no one else in the room with her.She appeared to be asleep. The television was on, but the sound was turneddown.When the scientists passed through the wall, they did not feel a thing. Thecomposition of the wall became as a whiff of smoke. But the energy field thatemanated from the box caused the television and the lights in that room andthose adjacent to it to flicker. The men had rehearsed entering a similarbuilding back at the base before attempting this exercise. But the committeedid not anticipate having all the attendants converge on them all at once.There were six attendants on duty that night. When the lights startedflickering in that wing of the building, all six of the attendants went running tothat location. The committee member whose job it was to distract theattendants - instead had them so nervous from the surprise inspection thatthey over-reacted.As the attendants converged on the room where the committee members hadjust entered, the committee had no choice but to subdue and paralyze theattendants one-by-one as they entered the room. The scientists had neverparalyzed healthy people before and never out of a lab setting. Now, they hadsix people standing limp inside that room, all looking like mannequins.Because they had not planned to interfere with any of the staff or of theoperation of the nursing home, the committee aborted the mission. It was onlyto be a training mission, a way to judge the difficulty that might beencountered when entering a private building with the intention of removing aperson from it without arousing any suspicion. In the past, when thecommittee needed bodies, the scientists harvested bodies from hospitals andnursing homes with the help of people that they had installed covertly into themanagement of those institutions. This new method allowed them to harvestwithout any inside connection. It also reduced their exposure: feweroperatives in the field.The committee members removed the quarter-sized discs from the temples ofthe attendants that the scientists had placed on the side of their heads as theattendants came ito the room (this freed the attendants from their paralysis)and laid the bodies down on the floor. The attendants were aware of what wasgoing on the whole time, but were unable to move or talk. After the attendantswere released from the spell of the discs, they became dazed and disoriented.The attendants remembered nothing of what happened to them (not why theywere all in one location of the building or why the attendants were all lying onthe floor). As each individual regained equilibrium (less than five minutesafter the committee members left), the first to reach a phone called the firedepartment. He had assumed that carbon monoxide or some other poisonousgas had leaked into the building. None of the members of the staff"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"remembered there was an inspection in progress prior to the attendantspassing out. Apparently the discs on the temples not only paralyzed people,but also the discs left the victims with a bit of amnesia about what had beenexperienced during and just prior to the time each was paralyzed.The committee members who were monitoring the phone lines the whole timecontinued to do so. The committee listened in on the conversation betweenthe staff member and the police department. The scientists made sure thingswere under control before they left. Only two of the attendants were taken toa hospital for observation and were released that same night. The others hadno problems and declined to go to the hospital.No damage was doe. The final police report indicated that none of the elderlypatients were affected. The report stated that the staff must have succumbedto the fumes from a cleaning solution that was found near the area where theattendants claimed to have had their dizzy spells. The committee wasundaunted by what took place that night. The scientists were confident thatthey could overcome unforeseen problems in future operations.Shortly after, those in charge of the program pulled the plug on the use ofnursing homes as a source of humans on which to experiment. The committeedid so for two reasons: first, they knew that all the newly rejuvenated oldpeople would eventually draw attention and possibly give credence to theUFO phenomena. Secondly, the cost of relocating all those people wasprohibitive. All the money that was earmarked for the committee wassufficient for the present needs of the committee. There was no contingencyfund. If they had to increase their budget by a million or so to allow for arelocation department, the committee risked becoming more visible to theCongress - who ultimately funded all government programs, even the onesthey know nothing about.In the years during the Cold War, it was simpler to finance clandestineoperations. Increasingly, the funding of the committee became its “AchillesHeel.” The committee was told that the funding they were receiving was stillcoming from the National Treasury, but that would not be the source in thefuture. *****Chapter 7The Second EncounterBill Smith (not his real name), the committee member who was abducted andallowed to observe the Aliens, had his second encounter. It happened fourmonths after his first. The Aliens took Bill Smith while he was at work. Therewere others in the building at the time, but Bill was working alone in his officewhen it happened. It was around noon and he was eating a sandwich, whichone of his colleagues had picked up for him. Bill was eating while going over areport he had to turn in that afternoon. An instant later, he was in an Alienship without his sandwich. The Aliens did not give him an explanation aboutwhy he was not allowed to finish his lunch before w2hisking him away. Notthat he asked, but it was certainly on his mind. Bill Smith knew he could notkeep secrets from the Aliens.There was a woman in the craft with him. She was on a table and he wasstanding nearby. She was young and somehow Bill Smith knew her exact age.She was nineteen-years-old. She was naked, yet he felt no sexual desiretoward her (despite her attractive features). She was lying on the surgical tablewith a horrified look on her face. She was scared and confused with no clueabout what was going on around her. She was not able to talk, but Bill knewall her thoughts - a privilege he did not have the first time he was abducted.The girl kept her eyes on Bill and in her mind, she kept asking, \"Why are youdoing this to me?\" She was not sure if she was being raped, or if she had beenin some kind of accident and was in an emergency room.Bill Smith knew her thoughts, but it was not mutual. She did not know histhoughts. He had the urge to speak to her and give her comfort, but he wasunable to, verbally or otherwise.Bill knew she was three months pregnant, but he did not know how he knew"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"all these things or why. As he stood there watching the girl, her whole life wasmade known to him. He then realized why the Aliens were giving himinformation gradually, while letting the hundreds of questions that popped intohis head go unanswered. No human mind is big enough to hold but a fractionof what there is to know - and only piecemeal at that! The little informationthat Bill Smith did receive about the girl was overwhelming his mind. But whydid he need to know all about her? He felt he knew her, but did not recall evermeeting her.Bill Smith watched as the Aliens removed the fetus from the girl's body andthen carried it to an adjacent room. Another Alien came back moments laterand inserted another fetus into her. Bill was not told if it was the same fetusthat the Aliens took out of her, or if it was a different one. If it was the sameone, what had been done to it?The Aliens told Bill it was not yet time for him to know that answer. Bill wasallowed to know that this girl was genetically linked to him. In fact, Bill washer biological father, even though he never met her mother. Her mother wasimplanted with his semen on board that same Alien craft nineteen yearsearlier. That fetus was is grandson! Bill was told that he fathered many otherslike her and it was not important for him to have contact with any of them,nor would it be possible for him to have contact, even if he were allowed toknow who they all were.He was not allowed to know who this girl was, other than what the Aliens hadalready let him know. Bill was also not allowed to know where the girl wasfrom. She could be from anywhere in the world, the Aliens told him. After theAliens returned Bill Smith to his office, he would never see her again.The Aliens told Bill that the physical body was of little importance. It was amere vessel that held the essence of what humans are. Because that girl andcountless others are related to his body, it had no bearing to who they werespiritually. His genes did not pass on any part of the soul. Although many ofthe features such as looks, color of hair and eyes are passed on by the genes,disposition and some traits that a child shares with parents are learned fromparents as the child grows up - so not necessarily a part of the gene pool.Although this last statement is ambiguous, the Aliens did not feel they neededto clarify that idea for Bill.The whole scope of what the Aliens are doing would never be revealed tohumanity, although there would be limited information given to some, like theinformation that Bill received. There have been many throughout history whowere given knowledge by the Aliens - mostly in the form of new technology.From whom the decisions were coming was not told to Bill (he asked themwho they were taking orders from). Some of the things that were divulged tohim seemed pointless and made no sense. “Eat bananas on Wednesday. Feedthe lions every Friday.” Others were equivocal: “Save the rain forest, destroythe trees.” Bill felt that many of the answers to his questions (when he didreceive them) were purposely vague. Other comments were completelyconfusing and occasionally mean-spirited.After Bill Smith was returned to his office, he looked at the clock on the walland determined he was gone for one hour. Bill had no recollection of theAliens taking him or returning him. He found himself sitting at the desk in thesame position he was in before his abduction. If it were not for the fact that hewas in an area with Alien objects strewn all around him, he would havebelieved he was hallucinating.The experience and his memory of it were clear. Bill pondered what theAliens told him about his offspring not being his. He had two children at homewith whom he had a strong bond and felt cheated and overwhelmed at thethought that he sired untold numbers of children, who are all strangers to him.Bill Smith was depressed after that encounter. No one in his departmentnoticed that Bill had been abducted. He took the rest of that day off and toldno one what had happened to him that afternoon. As he drove home, he couldnot help but see a little bit of himself in everyone he passed. He never felt thathis body was “all that special.” Why then did they use him as a human stud? Envy Stymies the CommitteeTwo weeks went by before Bill told the committee members about his lastabduction. Rather than being excited about that revelation, his colleagues"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"were envious and puzzled about why no others in the committee group hadbeen given the privilege that Bill Smith seemed to be enjoying. There wassome jealousy in the committee and Bill's colleagues seemed less interested inwhat Bill learned from the Aliens on that encounter. Some of his colleaguesaccused him of making up the stories. The scientists could not understand whyBill was singled out from the rest of them. Was he smarter than the rest ofthem? Was he better looking? Was his blood type special? The committeemainly wanted to know why the Aliens could not make themselves known tothe whole committee. After all, \"They (committee) were in this together,\" themen reminded Bill.The committee members had no doubt that Aliens did exist, but they did notbelieve Bill was being visited. The scientists thought Bill was becomingdelusional from the many years of working around Alien things and notmaking contact.Bill was accused of dominating the committee meetings because he claimed tohave more knowledge about the Aliens, which he did. During that time hiscolleagues voted to have him expelled from the committee. The higher-upswho felt his link with the Aliens was real vetoed that vote. The committeethen made matters worse by putting Bill in charge of the committee. ThenBill's committee colleagues rebelled and a mediator had to come in and try tofix the rift. After two weeks with no progress, the program was put on hold.Two months passed before the committee was reactivated. Presumably thedepartment continued operating during that time, probably under theleadership of one of the higher-ups. An operation of the magnitude that thiswas could not easily be brought to a stop. None of the documents indicatedwhat went on while the committee was absent. Bill Smith was again put incharge of the committee. Some of the original members were reinstated.Others were transferred to different departments. Bill spent the two monthsvacationing in the Hawaiian Islands. While he, a committee member, wasthere, the Aliens visited with him every day.Continued in Part 10 - Alien Manipulation of Human MindsMore Information:For further reports about extraterrestrial biological entities and technologies, please seemy books, An Alien Harvest and the 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities in theEarthfiles Shop.
