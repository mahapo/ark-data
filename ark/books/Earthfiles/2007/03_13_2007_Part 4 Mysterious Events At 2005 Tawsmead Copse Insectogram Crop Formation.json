Buckley: \"SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONSAs a seasoned researcher and investigator into UFOs, crop circles and theparanormal for over thirty years, I have always been extremely careful tomaintain a somewhat cautious and grounded approach when dealing withunexplained phenomena. However, in the light of recent events, some ofwhich have been documented in this report, I feel it is time - to use a timephrase - for 'stepping outside the box.' In many respects, the crop circlephenomenon, whatever its origin, has remained largely 'inside the box.' Eventhough there might be many thousands, if not millions, of people who haveencountered the phenomenon in one way or another and might haveexperienced very mysterious and bizarre events, it is the crop circlesthemselves which have manifested as a tangible, physical occurrence, whichcan be measured and recorded.At this point in time, I sense very strongly that the phenomenon, or whateveryou wish to call it, is very definitely moving into a new phase, or paradigm.For those who have been conditioned to accept a 'nuts and bolts'/materialisticinterpretation of what they experience, adapting to this new paradigm will bepainful.Just as modern society is largely unaware and unwilling to come to terms withthe relatively new quantum mechanical view of the universe, it will take timeand patience for this transformation to bear fruition. Those of us who havealready stepped out of the box should not, in my opinion, condemn otherswho are experiencing this difficulty of acceptance. Instead, we should offersupport and guidance wherever possible. That is not, however, to condoneignorance and apathy, traits which are all too familiar within the publicdomain. The 'phenomenon' will ultimately move at its own pace, regardless ofhow or whether we choose to react.I have always maintained that we are dealing with a co-creative process,which is especially true of the crop circle phenomenon. On a personal level,my life has been profoundly affected by what I have experienced fromchildhood to the present day. Some of my experiences have been positive andenlightening; others painful and confusing. There has been a personal price topay for 'dipping one's feet in the water,' as many other experiencers willtestify. Pandora closely guards her box and offers no guarantees of comfort tothose who choose to enter.Although the events described in my report are based on solid observations, Ido concede that I am asking most readers to take this report with some degreeof faith and trust. I have no reason to lie or fabricate information. Loyalfriends who know me well will readily testify to my honesty and sincerity.Skeptics should understand that not only do I have my reputation to consider,but I also have had some difficulties in coming to terms with some of thesehighly strange experiences.Before addressing some of the issues raised in my report, I feel it is importantto stress that while I have always attempted to maintain a scientific andobjective approach to my research and investigations, my background is in thearts. I have come to appreciate that when dealing with the imagination, mindand intellectual reasoning are not always appropriate and tend to stifle newknowledge that tries to come through the heart and spirit.'Stepping out of the box' sometimes requires a change in methodology.Paradigm shifts also demand a shift in consciousness if one is to make anyprogress in coming to terms with these new realities. Two years ago, I had theenormous privilege of meeting and speaking with the late Dr. John E. Mack,the Harvard Professor of Psychiatry, who researched the so-called 'alienhuman abduction syndrome' in the United States and wrote the best-selling1994 book, Abduction, and 1999 book, Passport to the Cosmos. He was fullyaware of the crop circle phenomenon and during the year of his untimelydeath (Born: October 4, 1929 – Died: September 27, 2004), he had visitedWiltshire where I met him in one of the many crop formations that year of 2004."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"In his ground-breaking book, Passport to the Cosmos, he makes severalreferences to another author whose work I respect and admire, PatrickHarpur. Just how deeply held is the world view that separates radically thematerial world from the realm of unseen spirit - or as Patrick Harpur wouldsay, from unseen 'daemonic reality'? The encounters penetrate into thematerial world, but those manifestations are elusive, sporadic and difficult todocument convincingly.The greatest source of information is the reports by experiencers themselves.UFOs and phenomena related to them (sometimes including crop circles) are,for Harpur, the ultimate daemonic realities. The physical evidence, althoughquite real, 'is as ambiguous as the phenomena themselves - just enough toconvince those people who want to believe in their literal reality - just toolittle to win over the unbeliever. There is always a point of discontinuity atwhich the spiritual ceases to be spiritual and becomes material and vice versa.'[ Source: Passport to the Cosmos © 1999 by John E. Mack, Ph.D.]I concede that many of the events described in my report will stretchcredibility to the limit for the average lay person. From my point of view,however, what I experienced was merely part of a continuing series ofinexplicable happenings, which I now accept have been occurring since mychildhood.Since the mid-1980s, the county of Wiltshire, England, saw an unprecedentedincrease in not only the crop circle phenomenon, but also sightings ofunexplained aerial objects, sometimes referred to as UFOs or structured craftor balls of light (BOLS0, or luminosities.Twenty years before then in the mid-1960s, the quiet Wiltshire market town ofWarminster was plunged into the international headlines when its residentsexperienced an extraordinary outbreak of paranormal phenomena, includingUFO sightings, strange sounds, reports of 'alien entities' and 'invisible walkers'and perhaps importantly, unusual ground markings in cereal crops.By 1972, with the Warminster happenings still happening, I wasted no time intraveling down to Wiltshire to interview witnesses and experience some ofthese unusual phenomena for myself.By the summer of 1988, the attention and focus shifted to the agriculturallandscape making up the Kennet Valley, locally known as the Vale of Pewsey.The appearance of the famous 1990 crop agriglyph at Alton Barnes heraldedan unprecedented wave of crop circles and UFO sightings, which continue tothe present day. Throughout the 1990s, I continued to research, investigateand experience a diverse range of phenomena, especially in the southwest ofEngland.It would be unrealistic of me to attempt to describe these experiences in detailwithin the confines of this report. They have included the crop circlephenomenon, sightings of UFOs, balls of light or luminosities, together with amyriad of paranormal happening, often in the company of witnesses. Themany websites, books and video documentaries, including my own publishedarticles, testify to the reality of these phenomena.I have also accumulated a large body of research material, including adatabase of video footage, which I have shared with fellow researchers,friends and members of the public. Some of these experiences are so personalthat it would be very difficult to explain them to a wider audience in a formthat would be comprehensible in rational terms. They include the inexplicableappearance of mysterious entities, whether in the form of the archetypal 'greyalien or as invisible 'walkers,' strange sounds and disturbing presences.Reports of these entities, whether in the form of so-called aliens, faeries,elementals, devas, nature spirits and ghosts, have been part of a globalfolklore throughout history. While conducting my research and investigationsin Wiltshire, it soon became apparent that an increasing number of witnesseswere reporting similar occurrences and it was not long before I began toexperience them for myself.Throughout the early 1990s, there were many attempts to contact orcommunicate with these unexplained entities. For example, such groups asCSETI (Center for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) led by StevenGreer, M.D. Another Project Starlight was initiated in 1992 around varioussites in the Vale of Pewsey with varying degrees of success, including the'vectoring of a structured craft' near Woodborough Hill on the night of July 26"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"to 27, 1992.Many would argue that the crop circles themselves are in the form of a codedreply from extraterrestrial agencies. Other researchers such as Andy Thomas,Karen Douglas and Paul Bura also achieved varying degrees of success in'channeling' information from what they perceived to be the circlemakers,outlined in their fascinating book, Quest for Contact.My own somewhat humble attempts to communicate with these unexplainedagencies using a series of 'meditation protocols' have also produced results andI include the events in this report as evidence of my own 'quest for contact.'What follows are some of my provisional observations and analysis. Myinterpretation of these events are often admittedly subjective, but nonethelessvery real. Their ultimate meaning is yet to be fully understood, but certain'clues' are emerging out of the confusion. I would also welcome the views andopinions of other readers, which are extremely valuable if we are to arrive at agreater understanding of these phenomena. 1) Woodborough Hill 'Insectogram' Crop FormationBased on the information contained in this report, I maintain that the abovecrop formation occurred in broad daylight on the morning of Friday, August12, 2005, between 10:30 and 11:45 AM. I have classified the formation as an'insectogram' because of its obvious similarity to the insect form. The nameinsect means literally 'in sections;' an insect's body is divided into three parts:head, thorax and abdomen. In the 2005 Woodborough Hill formation, thesecould be taken to correspond to the antennae, the head (comparable topreying mantis), the middle circle, and long, sinewy body and 'tail' section.To place this formation in an historical context, crop circle 'insectograms'occurred frequently in Wiltshire and Hampshire in the 1990s. Therefore, I feelthe description of this formation given by researcher Andreas Mueller atwww.cropcircleconnector.com [Crop-Circle Rumours] not only inaccuratelydescribes the formation as an alien or snail, but also misleads the reader intoconcluding the formation is a hoax without providing any hard evidence tosubstantiate his claim.I also cannot place much credence that he and his associates discovered thisformation in darkness on the night/morning of August 11-12, 2005. Bear inmind that according to my own account, the 'insectogram' was certainly notthere on the morning of Friday, August 12, 2005, at 10:45 AM, some eighthours after Andreas says they found it. Since the formation was so small inwhat was a massive crop field, the chances of accidentally discovering it indarkness would have been virtually zero.\"[ Update - Editor's Note: Andreas Mueller's comment:\"Because the author of this report is questioning my credence andwith it the credence of my friends and research colleagues, W.Anderhub and A. Witteveen, I would like to take the chance toclarify the discovery of the discussed formation at least as ithappened to us during the night of August 11/12 in 2005: Wewere together on our regular crop circle night-watch-tour throughthe area between Avebury and Alton Barnes. We arrived on theEast Field lay-by at about 3:00am and had a look around. Thenout of the blue we decided to walk along the straight tramline ofthe still standing part of the field (just next to the Tawsmeadcopse fields) to the top of the hill to have a look from this vantagepoint, too.\"We took the first tramline and had quite a walk. During this walkwe used our torch-lights time after time to see where we weregoing and to scan the field. (Afterwards we were thinking that wewould have looked very suspicious or mysterious for otherobservers.) However, after some 200+ metres, I used again mylight and just a few steps ahead I saw a small crop formation thatI did not know of at that time - what a strange coincidence! Aftersome looks around it became quite clear that what we werelooking at was a small crooked sketch of something like an\"alien\" or \"snail\" (if you like you may also call it an\"insectogram\") figure. One can imagine how surprised and"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"amazed we were ourself about this discovery! Believe it or not -but this is the story as we experienced it. Furthermore I have noexplanation if this discovery was chance, coincidence or intention(by what-or whoever) or what it means, nor do I have anexplanation of why Andy Buckley had not seen it when hewalked through the field some hours later in broad daylight whenhe is so sure that he had not confused the tramlines. All I can sayis that my colleagues and I have no intention to lie about ourexperience.\"Andreas Müller, March 13, 2007http://www.cropcirclescience.org Andrew J. Buckley: \"A short account in the Circular Review magazine,edited by Nick Nicholson, is also similarly misleading. The article implies theformation is a hoax, without providing any evidence. My own conclusion,having conducted a thorough ground survey in what was a formation inpristine condition, was that there was absolutely no evidence of any deliberatehoaxing or mechanical flattening of the crop, either by ropes, stomping boardsor garden roller. I find it difficult to understand why the formation shouldhave been eagerly classified as a hoax by certain researchers simply because itdoes not conform to their 'criteria' of what they perceive to be a 'genuine'formation.Below is an interesting observation of the 2005 Woodborough Hill cropformation by Wiltshire researcher, Gill Nicholas:'I entered the formation on Sunday, August 14, 2005, with myhusband, Rob; Karleigh (young foster daughter); and GordonStewart (long-time friend). Gordon showed us the way into thefield. After walking the whole formation, which didn't take longas it was smaller than most, I made my way to one of theantennae and sat down to tune into the energy.I found the energy to be extremely powerful, but eventually felt Ihad connected and asked if it were a Preying Mantis?Instantly, I was shown hundreds of little beings, such as in thisdrawing I produced [ Fig. A], busily scurrying about their lives. Ifelt a little annoyed at first with this, but realized that it was theirsense of humour making its mark again, as it so often does.Drawing of 2005 Woodborough Hill/Tawsmead Copse'insectogram' © 2005 by Gill Nicholas."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"I decided to move from the antenna, as I was not too comfortablewith the energy. Everyone else was sitting around the tuft in themain circle of the body. On entering the circle part, I was amazedhow the energy changed. I intuitively felt that this center sectionwas to let us know that they have incredibly large hearts. It was avery peaceful, yet joyful place to be.Both Karleigh, who is our foster daughter, and I made drawings.We counted seven standing tufts, one flattened swirl, whichKarleigh called the nose, and two knots for eyes, which weretwisted to a height of approximately one foot. They had twoindividual loose stems of wheat positioned into each of the knots,which protruded horizontally away from them.'- Gill Nicholas, August 2005\"To be continued in Part 5 - Ball of Light and Appearance of Mysterious GirlMore Information:For further information about crop formations, please see reports below and going back to1999 in the Earthfiles Archives and my book, Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles in theEarthfiles Shop:• 09/06/2006 -- Part 4: Five Circle Pattern in Geneseo, Illinois, Soybeans• 08/31/2006 -- Part 3: Five Circle Pattern in Geneseo, Illinois, Soybeans• 08/28/2006 -- Part 2: Five Circle Pattern in Geneseo, Illinois, Soybeans• 08/27/2006 -- Part 1: Five Circle Pattern in Geneseo, Illinois, Soybeans• 08/17/2006 -- Military Helicopter Aggression Toward Red Sphere in U.
