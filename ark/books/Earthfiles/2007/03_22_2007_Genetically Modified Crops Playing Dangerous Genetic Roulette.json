This cancreate unpredictable side effects.\" - Jeffrey SmithMarch 22, 2007 Fairfield, Iowa - The United States accounts for nearly two-thirds of allbiotechnology crops planted globally. Since 1996, the United States has consistentlyplanted more GM crops than any other country. Total acres of genetically modified corn,soybeans, cotton, and canola planted in the United States in 2006 totaled 128.3 millionacres – an increase of nearly 10% more GMs planted than in 2005.In addition to large farming of soy, corn, cotton, canola, and alfalfa, other smaller GMcrops now include zucchini, crooked neck squash, and Hawaiian papaya. Meanwhile, datakeeps piling up about human allergies and sick and dying animals and amphibians linked tointeractions with GMs. One man is convinced that GMs should be eliminated from theworld’s agriculture. He is Jeffrey Smith, author of the best selling 2003 book, Seeds ofDeception. His follow-up book will be released in April with a title he says sums up thesituation in two words: Genetic Roulette. His subtitle is: “The documented health risks ofgenetically engineered foods.” The Foreword is written by Michael Meacher, former U. K. Environment Minister, whostates: “The case presented is absolutely a smoking shotgun that should stop in its tracksany dabbling with GM foods, whether by individual families, food companies or indeed,nations. ... Jeffrey Smith is the modern David against the GM Goliath. This book may wellprovide the slingshot to change the global course of events this century.”Recently, I talked with Jeffrey Smith about some of the documented health risks tohumans and animals and why genetically modified crops are different than naturallyevolved crops."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Genetic Roulette © 2007 by Jeffrey M. Smith will be releasedin April 2007, and will be available from GeneticSeedsofDeception.comand toll free 888-717-7000.Interview: Jeffrey M. Smith, Author, Seeds of Deception© 2003 and Genetic Roulette © 2007.Jeffrey Smith, M.B.A., Author Seeds of Deception © 2003 and Genetic Roulette ©2007, and Producer of www.responsibletechnology.org, Fairfield, Iowa: “When youcreate a genetically modified crop or organism, it’s not like you’re sticking a gene in like aLego piece that snaps into place. There is massive collateral damage that occurs within theDNA. This can create unpredictable side effects. This comes from the process of insertingthe gene, as well as controlling the output through tissue culture. You can end up with 3%to 4% of the entire DNA physically different than the DNA was to begin with because itinvolves mutations, deletions, re-arrangements. Not only that, a single insertion –according to one study – changed the expression level up to 5% of the genes in the DNA.We’re talking about massive changes in the DNA from sticking in one foreign gene. So theconcept that it’s a precise, well-ordered transformation is completely false and it’s theproduct of public relations – certainly not of science. So you have some examples of"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"GMOs that have caused massive damage in rats fed these GM products, but it was not thespecific protein that the gene was producing that caused the problem. It was simply theprocess of creating the genetically modified crop that caused the massive damage thatcaused the massive unpredicted changes that caused the health effects in the animals. So,that’s one thing.The second is that you have a gene that produces a protein that is specific and has neverbeen a part before of that organism. You have the pesticide, for example, that youintroduce to the cotton or the corn. The regulators claim that this pesticide was safebecause organic farmers have used it for years in its natural form and it had a history ofsafe use. They ignore entirely that hundreds of people complained of allergic reactionswhen they were sprayed with it during a gypsy moth infestation. They ignored entirely theresults of mice studies that showed an immune response equal to that of cholera toxin –abnormal and excessive cell growth and other problems. They ignore the scienceselectively in order to claim that they don’t need to test the fact that they are putting apesticide in every bite.That’s the second possibility. You have the collateral damage on the one hand and theintroduced protein on the other. But that protein might not be what you intend. When youstick the gene in, it can be truncated, mutated, re-arranged – or the protein that isproduced can be changed after it’s expressed in a new organism. They found, for example,peas in Australia that were supposed to have a completely identical protein to the naturalone. Turns out, the GM version had a potentially deadly reaction in mice. They had to stopthe commercialization process and what they found was a very subtle change in theprotein that they would not normally found through the normal studies. This could behappening already with the foods on the market. [ Editor's Note: An herbicide is a pesticide used to kill unwanted plants orweeds. Selective herbicides kill specific targets while leaving the desired croprelatively unharmed, such as Roundup herbicide manufactured by Monsanto,which is used on genetically modified crops such as corn and soy. The idea isthat the sprayed herbicide will kill the weeds, but not the genetically modifiedcrop. However, a new problem is the emergence of herbicide-resistant weedsto which farmers must apply more and more toxins.]Now, you have the increased use of herbicides as a result of herbicide-tolerant crops. About 80% of the crops genetically engineered are designed not to die when sprayed withherbicide. This results in a much higher amount of herbicide use. In the first 9 years, it wasabout 138 million pound increase in the use of herbicides in the U. S. By 2004, it wasestimated there was about 86% more herbicides sprayed on RoundUp-ready soy acres thanon non-GM soy acres. What this means is that it changes the whole soil composition,increases the residues in the food, increases fungus in the soil and changes the wholeecosystem in ways that might be very dangerous. In fact, it might get into the ground waterand we might be drinking the herbicide.If you genetically engineer a crop with genes from bacteria, you are putting bacteria genesinto corn and into soybeans and you are knocking down the normal barriers that preventone gene from one species to transfer into bacteria. So, it’s possible that we are populatingour own gut bacteria in massive quantities by eating these GM crops. WHAT IS THE STRONGEST MEDICAL EVIDENCE THAT HUMANS CAN BEBADLY AFFECTED BY GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"There is a lot of evidence. I’ve just spent about two years gathering all that evidence withinput from at least 30 scientists to put into my new book that’s coming out in April that iscalled Genetic Roulette: The Documented Health Effects of Genetically EngineeredFoods. There are very few studies on GM. There is only one published, peer-reviewedhuman feeding study.We know of a food supplement in the 1980s that was genetically engineered and only thatgenetically engineered brand killed about 100 Americans and caused five to ten thousandto fall sick. We’ve documented how information was withheld from the public andCongress, which would have put the blame squarely on genetic engineering. But therewere alternate explanations put forth with partial information that created a distraction. Sothat is one very strong piece of evidence that processes of genetic engineering can causenew diseases.We also know that soon after genetically modified soy was introduced to the U. K., soyallergies skyrocketed there by 50%. We know that genetically modified soy has anincrease of a known allergen called a trypsin inhibitor. In fact, the cooked GM soy had alevel about 7 times the allergen compared to a non-GM soy control.We know when GM soybeans were fed to mother rats, the offspring died at a rate of about56% in the first 3 weeks. When the mother rats were fed non-GM soy, the offspring diedat a rate of only 10%. That’s an alarming finding.It’s preliminary research, but at the same Russian institute where that occurred, theystarted introducing GM rat chow to all of the housed rats and within two months, the entiremortality rate was above 50% for the rat offspring, suggesting this might be a general thingfor GM soy.In other research, they found that mice fed GM soy had problems in the development oftheir sperm cells. In the offspring fed GM soy, in the young embryos, there was a changein their gene expression that was not seen in the embryos from parents that were fednon-GM soy.They saw potentially toxic reactions in the liver from GM soy; changes in the enzymelevels of major organs in the body. All sorts of things indicating a massive response in thephysiology of animals to the introduction of GM soy. HOW COULD SO MUCH EVIDENCE OF SOME KIND OF HARMFUL IMPACTFROM GM BE ESSENTIALLY DISMISSED? CLEARLY GM CROPS ARE BEINGGROWN AND INCREASING IN THEIR AMOUNT OF GROWTH AROUND THEWORLD.I’ve documented in my first book, Seeds of Deception, the way that evidence has beensuppressed. For example, a U. K.-funded study found that the process of geneticengineering was most likely the culprit in causing massive damage in rats fed GM potatoes.They had potentially pre-cancerous cell growth in the digestive tract, smaller brains, liversand testicles, partial atrophy of the liver, damaged immune system. When the scientistwent public with his concerns, he was fired from his job after 35 years and silenced withthreats of a lawsuit. His 20-member research team was dismantled and they gagged himand would not allow him to respond and then put out all sorts of misinformation.WHO WAS DOING THE THREATS AND THE FIRING?What happened was: he was working for the prestigious Rowett Research Institute inScotland and he was working with a $3 million grant from the government and he wasasked to speak on television. He did a short interview (Oct. 10, 1998) and for 2 days afterthe interview, he was a hero at the prestigious institute. Then 2 days after that, two phone"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"calls were allegedly placed from the U. K. Prime Minister’s office, forwarded through thereceptionist to the director of the institute. The next morning, that director fired Dr. ArpadPusztai. Now this type of treatment is not unique.I’ve talked with many scientists who were kicked out – I interviewed, for example, ascientist from the FDA who was doing the evaluation of Monsanto’s genetically modifiedbovine growth hormone. He was asking for more studies and was concerned about theapproval process. He was kicked out.So, there is a whole tradition of muzzling scientists and distracting against evidence thatwould normally be sufficient to stop production.WHAT INCENTIVE ARE THE GM MANUFACTURERS GIVING TO UNIVERSITIESTO HAVE THAT KIND OF INFLUENCE?It’s a fuzzy line right now between industry and academia as well as between industry andgovernment. In the case of the Univ. of California-Berkeley, Novartis had given $25million to the university in exchange for gaining the rights to research in certain ways andto have a strong position about what was being researched. Dr. Ignacio Chapela wasagainst that and was president of the UC-Berkeley faculty at the time and mounted acampaign to try to stop it. He became the target of the biotech industry. He tried to stoptheir control over the university and failed. People who were recipients of the grant moneywere some of those who apparently tried to get him to not have tenure.[ Editor’s Note: Ignacio Chapela, Ph.D., is a microbial ecologist andmycologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and an outspoken criticof the University's ties to the biotechnology industry. He is also notable forauthorship of a controversial Nature paper about the flow of transgenes in towild Mexican maize. In 2005, studies published in PNAS by Mexicanscientists do not support Prof. Chapela's findings. Prof. Chapela is also notablefor his work with natural resources and indigenous rights. Prof. Chapelaobjected to his faculty's taking of money from Novartis, taking a strongposition on the issue. Prof. Chapela was denied tenure in 2003, allegedlybecause of intervention by pro-industry faculty members. However, Prof.Chapela was finally awarded tenure on May 17, 2005.Novartis: On March 7, 1996, an earthshaking announcement was made tothe business world: Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy, the two Swiss-based chemical/lifesciences giants, had agreed to become one. Novartis, as the new company wascalled, was at that time the result of the largest corporate merger in history.Both Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy already had a rich history of their own. This yearNovartis celebrates its 10th anniversary.]A lot of universities have said they have been told by Monsanto or others that if they allowa certain professor to do certain research or to criticize Monsanto products that they willlose funding from Monsanto. A lot of professors in the plant biotechnology field – in fact, apredominant number of them – get their funding either directly or indirectly throughindustry. So, if they take an anti-industry, or even independent approach, they will losetheir funding and not be able to progress in that field. There’s only a handful ofindependent researchers right now in the entire world. So, it’s a very dangerous situationwith respect to plant biotechnology.What happens is that the U. S. has been bullying the rest of the world to try to make themaccept our GM crops under the guise that it’s the same thing (as natural crops) and wouldimprove the economic outlook for the United States. It turns out that neither is true. Now,the United States spends about $3 billion to $5 billion per year in extra price subsidiesboosting the price of the GM crops that no one wants. We’ve lost incredibly large markets.We’ve lost the European corn market. We’ve shrunk our soy market. Canada lost itshoney market to Europe because Europeans don’t want honey made from geneticallymodified canola. And we have this disaster now with the mounting evidence of problemswith GM crops. There are about 25 farmers in the Midwest that say certain GM corn"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"varieties cause sterility in their pigs and cows. There is a farmer in Germany who claims 12of his cows died when he fed them exclusively a GM corn variety. There are Filipinos whoclaim that water buffalos and chickens and other animals died when fed a certain type ofGM corn.And we don’t know the extent of these dangers in human beings because no one ismonitoring the problem. It’s just being put out there and we are being used as guinea pigsin this uncontrolled experiment for the economic and political interests of the biotechindustry and the U. S. government.There was someone doing research in the U. K. and he contacted the person who runsMonsanto’s cafeteria there at their headquarters. He asked if they used GM productsthere. This was in 1999 and he got back a letter that said:‘In response to complaints from our customers, we have decided to remove as far aspossible GM soy and corn from all food products served in our restaurant. We willcontinue to work with our suppliers to replace GM soy and corn with non-GM ingredients.We have taken the above steps to ensure that you, the customer, can feel confident in thefood we serve.” That was to the Monsanto executives in their U. K. headquarters. WHAT IS THE ARGUMENT THAT GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS ARE BETTERTHAN NATURAL CROPS?Farmers, in natural selection, will cross one species with another in order to combine traits,to combine the disease-resistant plant with a high-yield plant to try to get a high-yield cropwith disease resistance. So, with GM, you can take a single gene where you’vecharacterized a single trait and add it so you don’t have to go through a period ofsometimes years with thousands of plants in order to introduce a particular trait. But withGMs, what you are doing is crossing the species barrier. That’s made clear, for example, insome of the odd combinations. They’ve taken a spider gene and put it into a goat in hopesto milk the goat for spider web protein in order to make bullet-proof vests.They’ve put jellyfish genes into pigs so that the pig noses glow in the dark. They’ve puthuman genes into corn to create spermicide. And they create pesticide in corn so there ispesticide in every bite.These combinations are putting genes in that have not evolved as part of the years ofevolution. The process of gene insertion causes damage, the introduction of these newproteins and new genes can cause unpredicted side effects. But what they get is a corn thatproduces its own pesticide and that they get to patent and get to sell as a pesticide-producing product.But they don’t do the necessary work to verify that the foods are safe for consumption. Ifyou look at what they actually do, the studies are so poorly designed - actually, I wouldsay they are brilliantly designed to avoid finding problems. It would have to be an acutepoison with an instant result in order for some of the industry-funded studies to show anyhealth risks. And sometimes they do – we still have evidence of terrible problems in someof the animals fed GM crops. IT SOUNDS AS IF THESE FRANKENSTEIN APPROACHES TO MAKINGGENTICALLY MODIFIED CROPS COULD BE REDUCING THE BIODIVERSITY OFPLANTS ON THE EARTH. IF WE DEPENDED ON GM CROPS, WE MIGHT END UPWITHCROPS THAT CAN BE KILLED EASILY BY ONE THING AND THEN WE"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"WOULD NOT HAVE BIODIVERSITY TO BACK UP OUR FOOD SUP P LY.Genetic engineering of the food supply is very dangerous for food security. It’s verydangerous for biodiversity. In Argentina where there are millions and millions of acres ofGM soy, someone who was there told me it’s like a desert. There are no insects. There areno leaves of other plants. It’s just like a factory to produce soy. It is destroying theecosystem and the over-use of the herbicide is also causing very serious problems inhuman health and environmental health.IT’S LIKE DOMINOES FALLING FROM AN UNKNOWN HAND IN AN UNKNOWNPATTERN WITH AN UNKNOWN END RESULT.You really get it! (laughs) You really get it. That’s why my book is called “GeneticRoulette.” A roulette wheel is a good example. You spin it. You don’t know where the ballis going to land, but it has huge consequences when it does.The process of putting a gene into the DNA – it’s like throwing a dart with 2 billiondifferent ways it can land. When it goes in, it can knock out genes at random, turn themoff permanently, turn them on permanently, re-arrange things. And you have no idea whatit’s actually doing because we don’t know that much about how the DNA orchestrates themassive complexity of the organism. So we just have rudimentary knowledge. We’re at theinfant stages. In fact, when genetic engineering technology was created, it was based onassumptions that we now know are untrue. So, it’s an obsolete technology based onmisinformed science and being fed to millions of people and released into the environmentwhere it can never be recalled. It’s a very serious situation.” On February 16, 2007, Greenpeace in the U. K. won an 8-year-long court battle with aRussian institute and Monsanto, which tried to hide the damage to tumors, organs and cells in lab rats fed genetically modified potatoes.At the heart of the legal battle was a 1998 study by the Institute of Nutrition of the RussianAcademy of Medical Sciences that confirmed the U. K. research by Dr. Arpad Pusztai. Dr.Pusztai was fired from the prestigious Scotland Rowett Research Institute for reporting celldamage in rats fed Monsanto’s GM potatoes. After his research was publicized, Dr. Pusztaiwas fired by the Rowett Research Institute – allegedly because Rowett had some kind oflink to Monsanto.After U. K. Greenpeace sued the Russian Academy to release its GM potato research data,a Russian biotech consultant for Greenpeace conducted her own animal experiments withseveral GM foods. Irina Ermakova has a Ph.D. in Biology, is a member of the U. N.’sEcological Women's Assembly and is Vice President of the Russian National Associationfor Genetic Safety. Dr. Ermakova reported: “The Monsanto GM potatoes were the mostdangerous of the feeds I used in the trials – and on the basis of this evidence, they cannotbe used in the nourishment of people.”Greenpeace says that the Russian tests were also badly done. Half the trial rats died andonly the surviving rats were used for data – a serious violation of ethical scientificprotocol."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"More Information:Jeffrey Smith’s new book, Genetic Roulette: The Documented Health Risks of GeneticallyEngineered Foods will be released in April 2007, and will be available at:GeneticSeedsofDeception.com.Toll free: 888-717-7000.
