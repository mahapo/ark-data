That’s the only way to ensure you won’t have the E.colior salmonella present and alive on something that you eat.” - Trevor Suslow, Ph.D., UC-Davis A joint UC Davis/USDA research project sampled crops such as this spinachin the Salinas Valley of California, as well as animal droppings and water. Genetictests will be used to “fingerprint” and track bacterial contaminantssuch as E. coli O157:H7.

Spinach grownin the California Salinas Valley and packaged and distributed by two companies,including Natural Selection Foods LLC, were traced to the September 2006E. coli outbreak that killed three people and sickened more than200 others in twenty-six states. Image © 2006 by AP. September 18, 2007 Davis, California - There are two events that have occurredrecently. Dole Food Company, after a spot check discovery of E. coli, has issued aninternational recall of its \"Hearts Delight\" salad mix for bags stamped \"best if used bySeptember 19, 2007\" and production code numbers, A24924A and A24924B."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Scanning electron micrograph of Escherichia coli,grown in culture and adhered to a cover slip. Photomicrograph© by Rocky Mountain Laboratories, NIAID, NIH.A week ago, the Associated Press reported it had obtained documents and data through theFreedom of Information Act (FOIA) which show that \"federal officials (FDA) inspectcompanies growing and processing salad greens an average of just once every 3.9 years.\"Some Congressional representatives think there should be a law that requires federalinspections four times a year.Further, since the repeated E. coli and salmonella outbreaks the past few months in theUnited States and Canada, AP found that California public health inspectors have still notbeen given the authority to conduct spot-testing for pathogens and no spot-testing has beendone. And yet, California lettuce and spinach have been the source of thirteen E. colioutbreaks since 1996 - plus this most recent Dole spot check discovery of E. coli.I called Trevor Suslow, Ph.D. Plant Pathologist, Extension Research Specialist for 12years, Dept. of Plant Sciences, University of California-Davis, Davis, California. He andhis colleagues \"evaluate the risk potential for contamination by pathogens in fruits andvegetables and leafy greens. A lot of our work has been trying to figure out how longE.coli, salmonella and other pathogens can survive and grow on field crops. We’re lookingat ways to kill pathogens in irrigation water beyond adding chlorine, such as ozone andother pathogen-killing treatments.\"I asked Prof. Suslow why there have been so many prepared salad bag recalls the past yearand what the United States can do to stop repeated E. coli and salmonella contaminationsof salad greens.Interview:Trevor Suslow, Ph.D. Plant Pathologist, Extension Research Specialist for 12 years,Dept. of Plant Sciences, University of California-Davis, Davis, California: “WHATDO YOU THINK IS THE MOST LIKELY CONTAMINATING FACTOR IN THE DOLELEAFY GREENS JUST PULLED OFF THE MARKET?I honestly have no idea. As they do a trace-back, as they investigate the sources of all thedifferent components in that salad mix, could it be transfer from cattle? Could it be fromwild animals that are in proximity to cattle? Or deer? Or it could be water contamination oror contaminations from something happening on adjacent land.BECAUSE E.COLI’S LARGEST SOURCE IS FECES?Correct. Ultimately, E.coli contamination on leafy greens has to come back to fecalcontamination. But the distance in time between fecal contamination and cropcontamination could be relatively immediate, or it could be more separated in time and it’sa persistent pathogen introduced somewhere else down the line prior to the closure of theplastic bag.At this time, inspections are not uniform and standardized. They are not implementedacross all companies. But everybody is certainly doing something different than they werea year ago. Is it sufficient or adequate? Not yet.LET ME BRING UP CALIFORNIA STATE SENATOR, DEAN FLORES. HESPONSORED THREE BILLS TO ENACT MANDATORY REGULATIONS FOR LEAFYGREENS EARLIER IN 2007. THIS WAS AFTER A SERIES OF E.COLI ANDSALMONELLA OUTBREAKS. FROM ONLY ONE 50-ACRE PARCEL OF GREENSCROP, 200 PEOPLE BECAME ILL. ALL THREE OF SEN. FLORES'S BILLS TOENACT MANDATORY REGULATIONS FAILED AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT,THERE IS NOT MUCH GOING ON IN CALIFORNIA EXCEPT VOLUNTARY CROPINSPECTION?The difficulty is in trying to balance what is expedient and what can be put in placeimmediately versus what might be a better long-term solution. The fastest method in thepast few months was to have the leafy green growing industry adopt self-regulation."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Mandatory regulations and oversite would take a long time to put in place and have thedifficult challenge about answering: what is a science-based approach? And what wouldreally change consumer protection? And how would you federally standardize and regulatespot-checking, auditing and so on?WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO SOMEONE LIKE DARYL HOWARD, WHO LOST HIS83-YEAR-OLD MOTHER AFTER SHE ATE E.COLI-CONTAMINATED GREENS?It’s an extremely tragic event and it’s not the outcome you expect from consuming foodsin the United States.BUT IT’S HAPPENING.Yes, and it’s very serious. But part of the problem is: What exactly do we do about it? Asyou point out, contamination clearly happens. The industry itself is finding from its owntesting that there are detectable levels of contamination in the salad greens crops.AFTER HIS MOTHER DIED, DARYL HOWARD TOLD A REPORTER, ‘WE HAVESTRICT STANDARDS FOR LEAD PAINT ON TOYS. BUT WE DON’T SEEM TOTAKE THE SAME LEVEL OF SERIOUSNESS ABOUT SOMETHING WE CONSUMEEVERY DAY.’The fact is there is no currently known way to guarantee the elimination of pathogens onproduce that is consumed without a cooking step or some kind of thermal treatment. That’sthe only way to ensure you won’t have the E.coli or salmonella present and alive onsomething that you eat.It’s only been more recently that people have greatly increased their consumption of fresh,uncooked spinach and salads. I eat a lot of them. So does my family. We love them. Butunfortunately, there is a very low, but very real risk of becoming ill. So, until there is a fullproof ‘kill step,’ you don’t have the same type of approach that you would for testingproducts for lead. If Poultry and Beef Are Regulated by Federal Laws,Why Not Salad Crops?BUT WHY IS THERE RESISTANCE TO FEDERAL REGULATIONS LIKE WEWOULD HAVE ON LEAD PAINT TO MONITOR THE FIELDS OF LEAFY GREENSTHAT CONTINUE TO HAVE SO MANY PROBLEMS. IN FACT, ONE OF THEDETAILS IN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS INVESTIGATION WAS THAT THERE WEREONLY 10 AUDITORS IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD ANDAGRICULTURE MONITORING FIELDS IN CALIFORNIA.How do you develop a mandatory program with rules, standards and criteria that makesense and actually do the job of protecting consumers? Consumers need to make noise,need to demand the allocation of resources to this problem. If you’re going to have anational federal program, you have to allocate resources to have the kind of staff that cando that.HAS ANYONE WORKED OUT WHAT IT WOULD COST AND HOW MANY PEOPLEIT WOULD TAKE?I think that realization is one of the barriers. We might desire mandatory programs at stateand federal levels, we can’t put it together quickly and we don’t have the finances today.BUT IF WE CAN DO IT FOR LEAD PAINT ON CHILDREN’S TOYS, WHY CAN’TWE DO IT FOR THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF GREENS THAT PEOPLE ARECONSUMING EVERY DAY?Think you have to ask the folks at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). But one ofthe reasons is that those types of products (toys), you can hold them and they are stableand they don’t change while you do your testing. Generally, something that ismanufactured with a uniform treatment such as lead-contaminated paint, it would be onalmost every single unit made.That’s not the case when you have contamination of fresh produce and you have a highlyperishable product that all the testing and inspections have to happen in a very timelymanner or you can’t monitor.WHAT I’M HEARING IS: IT WOULD COST TOO MUCH MONEY TO PROTECT OURFOOD SUPPLY."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"No, what you are hearing is that given the knowledge we have and the contaminationevents that have happened, people need to make protecting the food supply a priority.WHAT IS IN COMPETITION WITH PUTTING FOOD SAFETY AS A HIGHPRIORITY?You name it, there is a lot of competition for federal funds in the American economy.WE HAVE STRICT REGULATIONS FOR THE POULTRY AND BEEF INDUSTRIES,FOR EXAMPLE. AND YET THIS SPRING, AFTER ALL THE E.COLI ANDSALMONELLA OUTBREAKS IN THE LEAFY GREEN ADMINISTRATION, THEBUSH ADMINISTRATION ISSUED GUIDANCE TO ‘MINIMIZE MICROBIALHAZARDS OF FRESH CUT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES.’ BUT IT TURNS OUT,THERE ARE NO NEW LAWS. IT WAS JUST GUIDANCE FOR ANOTHERVOLUNTARY PROGRAM. WHY DO MEAT AND POULTRY HAVE STRICTCONTROLS AND LEAFY GREENS NOT?I can’t give you a specific answer. But I think part of it is that the meat and poultryregulations developed over time with risks to consumers. There was a demand bothinternally and internally to fix what was wrong with that industry and to bring everythingunder the same set of practices and oversight. I believe that will likely happen with theproduce industry as well.SO YOU ARE SAYING THAT BECAUSE THE E.COLI AND SALMONELLAOUTBREAKS HAVE ONLY HAPPENED IN THE PAST TEN YEARS THAT NO ONEHAS ACTED TO MAKE STANDARD REGULATIONS ON HOW TO HANDLE ANDPROTECT THE LEAFY GREEN INDUSTRY?I think that’s a good summary. Unfortunately, it often takes a very serious and tragic eventand pressure from a number of external influences to cause and accelerate change. That’swhat’s been happening over the past year after the outbreaks in spinach and lettuce. Thathas really forced the industry to deal with the seriousness of the situation whereas before,as in any group, you have divided agendas. You have those who feel responsibility andthose who do not. I think maybe following the track of the meat industry makes since, butit’s not there yet. What Are the Sources of thePathogen Contaminations?EVEN WITH THE ACTION OF NO LAW WITH TEETH ABOUT WAYS TO REDUCEMICROBIAL HAZARDS LAST MARCH BY THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, THECENTER FOR SCIENCE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN WASHINGTON, D. C.,FOUND THAT LEAFY GREEN GROWERS DID NOT EVEN KNOW ABOUT WHATTHE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAD SAID WERE THEIR VOLUNTARYGUIDELINES. OR THE GROWERS JUST WERE NOT FOLLOWING THEM.HERE IS A QUOTE FROM CAROLINE SMITH-DE WALD, DIRECTOR FOR THECENTER FOR SCIENCE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST FOOD SAFETY DIVISION:‘INSPECTION ALONE IS NOT GOING TO FIX THE PROBLEM UNLESS THEFARMERS UTILIZE FOOD SAFETY PLANS THAT ARE EFFECTIVE FORCONTROLLING PATHOGENS. THEY ARE NOT GETTING TO THE SOURCE OFCONTAMINATION ON THE FARMS.’THAT MEANS WE WILL CONTINUALLY HAVE CONFIRMATION OF E.COLI,SALMONELLA AND OTHER MICROBES IN THE LEAFY GREEN INDUSTRY THATARE CONSUMED IN THE UNITED STATES.I certainly agree that inspection alone is not the answer. Microbiological testing alone isnot the answer.IT’S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT FIELD WORKERS HAVE URINATED IN THESOIL OR ON THE PLANTS WHERE THEY ARE WORKING BECAUSE THEY DON’THAVE ANY BATHROOMS. IF THEY CUT THEIR FINGERS AND BLOOD DRIPS ONCROPS, DISEASE CAN BE SPREAD THAT WAY.All of those risk factors have occurred and there might be current problems. But thequestion is: how do you guarantee that people are being properly trained so none of thosethings happen?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Require Surprise Inspectionsand Stiff Company Fines If ViolationsThe only way I know is both by having routine and unannounced audits and inspections byindependent third parties, as well as very high fines on companies that have violations likethat. I don’t know any other way. You can’t guarantee compliance in any other mannerthat I’m aware of.SO, YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT SURPRISE FIELD INSPECTIONS BY SOME KINDOF AGENCY THAT WOULD HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO GO AROUND AND DOSURPRISE FIELD INSPECTIONS. APPLY HEAVY DUTY FINES ON PEOPLE WHOARE VIOLATING IN THE LEAFY GREEN GROWER INDUSTRY. ARE GROWERSACTIVELY PUTTING OUT 'PORTA-POTTIES' FOR THE FIELD WORKERS?From personal field experience, the availability of portable sanitary facilities has becomewidespread, especially in California, in the past ten years and especially in the past four tofive years. Now, are adequate facilities available in every field all the time? I could notanswer that.BUT IT HAS BEEN A PROBLEM.It has been a problem and can still be, but I’m sharing with you that where I go in manyregions in California and elsewhere, there is training and education for hand washing andpersonal hygiene. And portable toilets are widely used. U nd e r g r o u nd We l l Wa t e r a nd A q u i f e r sUsed for Spray Irrigation Need to Be TestedExample of spray irrigation in which water is pumped from undergroundwell or aquifer through sprinklers on wheels to roll through crop. Image courtesy USGS.WHY DO YOU THINK WE STILL DON’T KNOW THE SOURCE OFCONTAMINATIONS OF E.COLI AND SALMONELLA OUTBREAKS IN JUST THEPAST YEAR?Part of the challenge are the many points of contamination.LIKE WHAT?Like wildlife, soil amendments, water...YOU MEAN CONTAMINATED WATER THAT IS BEING SPRAYED ON THE CROPS?That’s possible. All the data collected suggests there is not a lot of contamination insprayed water, but that does not mean it doesn’t happen. You’re not sampling every dayeverywhere.BUT ISN’T IT TRUE THAT MOST OF THE WATERING OF THE GREEN LEAFYINDUSTRY IS FROM SPRAYERS ABOVE THAT COMES DOWN ON THE PLANTS?There are a combination. Certainly, overhead irrigation is a very common form ofirrigation. But when that water is tested, it’s not commonly found to be contaminated.THEN HOW DOES WILD LIFE CONTAMINATE THE LETTUCE AND SPINACH IFIT ISN’T THEIR URINE AND FECAL MATTER CONTAMINATING THE WATERSPRAYED ON THE CROPS?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"In an open field environment, you have the chance of wild animals walking in. I know thatevery company I’ve worked with has increased their field scouting and are rejecting fieldsbased on how often wildlife intrudes. You have birds. You have small mammals and otherthings that can get in.One of the things we do not understand is precisely how contamination in the leafy greenfields happens. Cattle grazing near leafy green fields could easily cause contamination.There have been instances where water has been the proven contamination. So have dustaerosols. The movement of insects. The movement of small mammals. So, it has not beenpossible yet to pinpoint the precise sources of contamination. Therefore, it’s very hard todesign a full proof control system.BUT ISN’T IT TRUE THAT THE WATER SPRAYED ON ALL THE LEAFY GREENCROPS IN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATES IS LARGELY PUMPED FROMUNDERGROUND?A lot of it is ground or well water from very deep aquifers. It’s a combination of using thatwater directly or moving that water into an on-farm reservoir, which becomes surfacewater.BUT HAS ANYONE DONE A SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS OF UNDERGROUNDWATER SOURCES THAT ARE BEING PUMPED UP AND SPRAYED ON OUR LEAFYGREENS?Most companies have had well-monitoring programs for several years. You can argue thatthe frequency of testing should be increased and that has happened. There are wells thatare not adequately protected, or their construction are more vulnerable to surface run-offcontamination. But as far as I know, periodic well water tests have generally turned upnegative for dangerous pathogens.I KNOW THAT IN ONE OF THE BIG SALMONELLA OUTBREAKS, I TALKED WITHA UC-DAVIS FOOD SAFETY PROFESSOR ABOUT IT AND HE TOLD ME IT WASHIS OPINION THAT UNLESS A SYSTEMATIC GRID TESTING WAS DONE ONUNDERGROUND WATER, NO ONE WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND WHAT THECONTAMINATION SOURCE IS. IT WAS HIS OPINION THAT AS ALONG AS THEREIS UNDERGROUND PUMPING AND NO ONE IS STUDYING WATER RUN-OFFTHAT COULD GET TO UNDERGROUND WATER AND CONTAMINATE THATWATER, WE’LL CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE PROBLEMS.I think there are a number of people, both within the industry and government agencies,who have arrived at the same conclusion and are developing plans for a morecomprehensive grid analysis of the key aquifers, exactly as you have described.HOW DO YOU DO THAT?We need hydrologists and experts in pathogen testing and do it on a regional basis andhave the funds and resources to test multiple locations over multiple periods of time and itreally needs to be a long-term study because factors that might be important in movingpathogens into well water might happen one year under heavy rainfall and then not inanother year when it’s drier. There has to be a comprehensive scientific study.IF THERE IS A CONSENSUS THAT DOING GRID SAMPLING OF UNDERGROUNDWATER THAT IS SPRAYED ON LEAFY GREENS IS NECESSARY, WHY HASN’T ITBEEN DONE BEFORE 2007?It’s being discussed now because of the outbreaks of E.coli and Salmonella that haveoccurred in recent months and the damage done to the grower industry. They want toprotect their business and consumers which form the basis for their business. What Can Be Done to Stop Contamination?ISN’T IT CATCH-22 THAT UP TO 2007, THERE WERE ALL THESE PROBLEMSTHAT PEOPLE IN THE GROWER INDUSTRY AND FOOD SAFETY ALL KNEWWERE FESTERING. BUT NOTHING GETS DONE BECAUSE THEY SAY IT COSTSTOO MUCH MONEY TO DO IT. AND THEN, ALL THESE AMERICANS GET SICK.A LOT OF PEOPLE DIED. AND FINALLY SOMEBODY SAYS, ‘WELL, I GUESS IT’STIME TO START CHANGING OUR WAYS’?Unfortunately, it often takes a tragedy and economic consequence to trigger the kind ofaction that many people have been advocating should have been done for many years. Butthere is simply not enough agreement about how to go about it and who is going to pay for"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"it to make it happen?DO YOU FEEL COMPLETELY IGNORED AS THE E.COLI AND SALMONELLAOUTBREAKS CONTINUE TO OCCUR MORE FREQUENTLY?No, I don’t feel completely ignored. I’m trying to be a neutral source of science data forboth the industry, regulators, public health safety people. A lot of our funding clearlycomes from industry sources, but I don’t think that compromises what we are doing toprovide data base information for others to make decisions.REALISTICALLY, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN NOW THATTHERE HAS BEEN ANOTHER E.COLI OUTBREAK?For clarification, the Dole recall was prompted by a positive detection on a bag of greens,but is not linked to illnesses, which I think is important as a window into what will happenin the future. I think it’s highly likely that the level of surveillance by various governmentagencies and independent assessments by buyers will accelerate detection like this andgetting it out of the marketplace before it does make people sick.BUT ISN’T THAT A CONTRADICTION TO WHERE WE STARTED THIS INTERVIEW– YOU WERE SAYING THERE IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY OR INSPECTORS TOEXPAND INSPECTIONS AT THE FEDERAL OR STATE LEVELS?Not contradictory in that this Dole catch was a spot inspection. Larger mandatoryinspections is a whole other issue: going out to the fields, to the harvesters, to theprocessing and packing facilities demands a larger level of time and money than periodicsamples of product in the marketplace doing a spot check to see if there is anycontamination.BUT IF IT’S A FACT ESTABLISHED BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS FOIAINVESTIGATION THAT FEDERAL OFFICIALS INSPECT COMPANIES GROWINGAND PROCESSING SALAD GREENS ONLY ON AN AVERAGE OF JUST ABOUTONCE EVERY FOUR YEARS, HOW DO WE INCREASE THAT FEDERALINSPECTION FREQUENCY? AND SINCE ALL THE E.COLI AND SALMONELLAOUTBREAKS, NO CALIFORNIA HEALTH INSPECTORS HAVE GONE OUT TO DOA SINGLE SPOT TESTING.I don’t have an answer for that except the inspections have to be done by trained peoplewith knowledge. There are multiple competing needs for federal money andpeople/politicians have to determine where food safety fits into those priorities.IN ADDITION TO THE CONSENSUS ON THE NEED TO DO SOME GRIDSAMPLING ON UNDERGROUND WATER, WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND IN YOURWORK IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS IN CAUSING CONTAMINATION?We still don’t really have a fix on exactly where contamination comes from becausematching possible sources of contamination in the field to actual product is so infrequent,that it’s like a needle in a haystack. So, we try to understand the behavior of pathogens andunder which scenario the pathogens survive and when they die.Perhaps what we should be doing is not concentrating on the sources of contamination, butfinding the most effective and safe way to kill the pathogens in the irrigation water.HOW LONG CAN E.COLI AND SALMONELLA LIVE IN WATER?They certainly can live for one month, or longer, depending upon a variety of factors. Itcan be several weeks to longer and they will live longer in some of the sediments thatcollect at the bottom of a water source – well or aquifer.KNOWING THAT, WHY ISN’T THERE SOME TREATMENT OF ALL THE WATERTHAT IS BEING SPRAYED ON LEAFY GREENS THAT WOULD KILL THE E.COLIAND SALMONELLA IN THE WATER?That’s an excellent question. One of the factors to consider are: if you are going to treatthe water, what are some of the unintended consequences of that treatment? Whatmaterials do you use? And how do you do it safely?People are taking measures to treat water, rather than rely on testing and over time wehope we can validate other options that are more environmentally compatible.WHAT CHEMICALS IN WATER ARE BEING USED RIGHT NOW TO KILL E.COLIAND SALMONELLA IN THE WATER?There are a number of growers using low levels of chlorine just like we treat swimmingpools and municipal water supplies. Others are looking at copper ionization, ozone"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"treatment, things like that.IS THERE ANY REASON WHY LOW LEVELS OF CHLORINE COULD NOT BEUNIVERSALLY USED IN ALL WATER?In the short term, it’s OK. In the long term, there are problems with the use of chlorine inwater that has a higher organic load.YOU MEAN THE IRRIGATION WATER THAT’S SPRAYED ON THE CROPS CAN GOINTO THE GROUND WATER THAT ENDS UP IN KITCHEN FAUCETS?Not so much. Chlorine interacts with organics and turns into substances that might harmthe environment. The question is: are the levels of discharge to a watershed be largeenough to cause harm? It’s thought they are not because most of the sprayed water iscoming from deep wells in which the water is pretty clean. If you start treating other typesof water that have more organic materials.CHLORINE INTERACTS WITH WHAT ORGANICS AND PRODUCES WHAT?It interacts with organic material just as you would if treating waste water and creates aclass of compounds called trihalomethanes.[ Editor’s Note: Tr i h a l o m e t h a n e s (THMs) are chemical compounds in whichthree of the four hydrogen atoms of methane (CH4) are replaced by halogenatoms. Many trihalomethanes find uses in industry as solvents or refrigerants.THMs are also environmental pollutants, and many are consideredcarcinogenic. Trihalomethanes with all the same halogen atoms are calledhaloforms(chloroform, fluoroform, bromoform, iodoform.)Water pollutantsTrihalomethanes are formed as a byproduct when chlorine or bromine areused to disinfect water for drinking. They result from the reaction of chlorineand/or bromine with organic matter in the water being treated. The THMsproduced may have adverse health effects at high concentrations, and manygovernments set limits on the amount permissible in drinking water. In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limits the total concentrationof chloroform, bromoform, bromodichloromethane, anddibromochloromethane to 80 parts per billion in treated water. This number iscalled \"total trihalomethanes\" (TTHM). Chloroformis also formed in swimming pools, which are disinfected with chlorine orhypochlorite in the haloform reaction with organic substances (urine, sweatand skin particles). The reaction to phosgene under the influence of UltraViolet (UV) light is also possible.]These are among the types of disinfection by-products. They can also form materials suchas chloromine, which is the thing that often in swimming pools stings your eyes. That’s acombined form of chlorine and there are concerns that if there are extensive and long-termuse of these treatments, what would the consequence to the environment be?WHAT DO YOU THINK IT’S GOING TO TAKE TO INCREASE THE SAFETY OFAMERICAN FOODS?I think the reality is that it will take a lot of coordinated effort between industry, theirassociations, government – both local and federal, public health agencies, environmentalprotection, technology and academia has a role. And it’s going to take time.MEANWHILE, E.COLI AND SALMONELLA OUTBREAKS KEEP HAPPENING.Meanwhile contamination clearly keeps happening. As it continues to happen, I think thateveryone recognizes that consumer confidence in these products will either continue toerode or be severely challenged.The likelihood of becoming ill is extremely small, but it’s not zero. So each person has tomake the choice about buying pre-packaged leafy greens for themselves.AND EATING CONTAMINATED GREENS CAN BE LETHAL.And can be lethal.”More Information:For further reports about food and environmental contamination, please see reports belowin the Earthfiles Archive:"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"• 09/07/2007 — Honey Bee DNA Study Finds Australian Virus in Colony Collapse Disorder• 06/28/2007 — Hackenberg Apiary, Pennsylvania - 75-80% Honey Bee Loss in 2007.
