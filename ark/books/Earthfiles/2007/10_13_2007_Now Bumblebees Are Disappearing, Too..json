October 13, 2007 Davis, California - Another scientific mystery is expanding: thedisappearance of pollinators in North America. First, it was the massive disappearance ofat least 25% of all the honey bees in the United States and Canada this past year in what iscalled Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Now it is the severe decline of four bumblebeespecies that used to be prevalent on the West and East coasts of the U. S. and Canada –but now scientists can’t find them. In fact, one species known as Bombus franklini – orFranklin’s Bumblebee – might be extinct. And it’s all happened since 1994.One of America’s bee experts is Robbin Thorp, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus in the Dept. ofEntomology at the Univ. of California - Davis. He received his Ph.D. in Zoology in 1964from the University of California-Berkeley. Over the past 43 years, he has focused on bees– especially bumblebees. I talked with him this week about the disturbing disappearance offour species that used to be so prevalent.Interview: Robbin Thorp, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus, Department of Entomology, University ofCalifornia – Davis, Davis, California: “We have about 45 different species ofbumblebees in North America. Of these, four are showing rather severe decline in recentyears and I have a hypothesis as to why the circumstantial evidence points to anintroduced disease, which might be another species of Nosema that is known to affectbumblebees, but does not affect honey bees. And the honey bee Nosemae do not affectbumblebees. Those kinds of tests have been tried."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Various Nosema species are single cell protozoans,which resemble the one above. Photomicrograph © by Science Source.WOULD THE NOSEMA THAT AFFECTS BUMBLEBEES HAVE TO HAVE COMEINTO UNITED STATES THROUGH IMPORTED BEES FROM SOME PLACE ELSE INTHE WORLD?That’s my hypothesis and a lot of things fit that hypothesis because bumblebees were justgetting into being commercially reared in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1992,permission was given by USDA APHIS to export queens of Bombus occidentalis, thewestern bumblebee and a species of Eastern bumblebee that were candidates for rearingby beekeepers. Those queens were then shipped to Europe and colonies were reared fromthem in facilities there where they normally reared Bombus terrestris, which is a Europeanbumblebee, fairly closely related to Bombus occidentalis.Bombus occidentalis.Bombus terrestris queen.Images by bumblebee.org.Then those colonies were shipped back to North America and distributed for pollinationpurposes. Most of the Bombus occidentalis colonies went to the west and the Bombusimpatiens colonies were used on the East Coast, which is part of their historic, naturalranges."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Bombus impatiens native to East Coast. Image © by Thomas Baltimore.In the late 1990s, I began intensive surveys of Bombus franklini and Bombus occidentalisin the western United States. I noticed that although their populations were fairly high in1998, they declined very rapidly in the next few years and I have not seen Bombusoccidentalis in the areas where I was surveying since 2003 and I have not seen Bombusfranklini in its smaller range in 2004 to 2005. I did find one worker in 2006 and none thisyear of 2007. So these bumblebees have declined very severely.May 7, 1998, Bombus franklini on a California poppynear Gold Hill in Jackson County, Oregon. This once-prevalent bumblebeemight now be extinct for unknown reasons. Photo © 1998 by Robbin Thorp, Ph.D.DOES THAT MEAN THEY HAVE ACTUALLY GONE EXTINCT?I hope not. But that bumblebee was once very common all the way from MonterreyCounty all the way up to southern British Columbia and it is virtually undetectable in thoseareas now.So, my hypothesis is that this disease came into the United States between 1992 and 1994in that three-year period when queens were shipped to Europe and colonies shipped backand that those escaped into the environment and began causing this decline in theseparticular bumblebees – two in the west and two in the East.So, we need to learn a cautionary tale from this kind of thing that we need to be verycareful in making sure that our stocks of bees and all t hat we export and import aroundthe world are free of diseases. Shortage of Pollinators in 2008?JERRY HAYES AT THE DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE IN FLORIDA TOLD MERECENTLY THAT THERE MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH POLLINATORS IN 2008 WITHDECLINES ACROSS THE BOARD IN NORTH AMERICAN POLLINATORS.Yes, that’s one rather dire prediction and it could be true. We certainly have to beconcerned about this.JERRY HAYES TOLD ME THAT IN 2006, HE ATTENDED A MEETING THAT WASHELD BY THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES IN WASHINGTONCONCERNING AN OVERALL GROWING CONCERN THAT THERE IS SUCH A"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"UNIVERSAL DECLINE IN POLLINATORS IN NORTH AMERICA.Yes, I attended that same meeting. And they (NAS) has published a book about pollinatorsin North America and there are some grim warnings in there about some of the things wehave lost.MAY BIRENBAUM AT THE UNIV. OF ILLINOIS, WHO HAS STUDIED THEGENETICS OF THE HONEY BEES IN TRYING TO HELP ON CCD, SAID IT ISABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING HOW LITTLE WE KNOW ABOUT THEPOLLINATORS.She’s absolutely correct. Can North American Pollinators Be Restored?WHAT DO YOU THINK COULD BE DONE TO RESTORE BACK NORMALPOPULATIONS OF HONEY BEES, BUMBLEBEES AND OTHER NORTHAMERICAN POLLLINATORS?That’s a very complex problem. There’s a lot of reasons why some of these are decliningand they are different for different species.Most of the wild population of bees have declined so severely that people who used todepend on them for pollination of their backyard crops, trees and fruits have noticed ageneral decline in honey bees there. Commercial beekeepers are really stressed in trying tokeep viable colonies going so they can stay in business. We’re losing not only honey bees,but we’re losing people who are working with honey bees as well. It’s a very difficultbusiness for people to stay with and make a living at. It’s not just the bees themselves, butthe spin-off in economics and consequences on the beekeeping industry.EVEN IF BUMBLEBEES DON’T PRODUCE HONEY, THEY ARE VERYIMPORTANT POLLINATORS IN CROPS SUCH AS TOMATOES, PEPPERS ANDSTRAWBERRIES. AND OUT TO THE WILD POPULATION OF ANIMALS SUCH ASELK AND DEER AND BEARS DEPEND ON FOODS BUMBLEBEES POLLINATE. IFTHERE IS A GENERAL DECLINE IN BUMBLEBEES, WOULD THE DOMINOESFALL THAT EVEN FOOD FOR WILD ANIMALS WILL BE REDUCED?Oh, certainly that’s a threat and concern. It’s unlikely that all bumblebees are going todisappear because we have a variety of species, each of which is quite different from oneanother. We have 45 species in America north of Mexico.DO YOU THINK IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT EVEN IF THIS IS NOT ON THE DAILY 6O’CLOCK NEWS, THAT THE DECLINE IN POLLINATORS IN NORTH AMERICA ISIN FACT ONE OF THE BIGGEST THREATS THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US?I think so. But I’m biased because I work with these pollinators and have a deepappreciation for what they do in the natural environment. We’re continuously disturbingand destroying and altering habitat out there where the native pollinators exist. California's Huge Almond IndustryNeeds At Least 1.2 Million Colonies of BeesThe biggest pollination crisis is going to be with almonds in California. It turns out that thealmond industry has been planting over 600,000 bearing acres right now. At 2 colonies (ofbees) per acre, you need 1.2 million colonies to pollinate that during the period ofmid-February to mid-March. So the real crisis is predominantly for one crop. Atremendous number, about half of the bees in the U. S., are moved to California during thatperiod.The almond industry is concerned, justifiably so, and are looking into alternativepollinators such as the Blue Orchard Bee. It’s being produced in large numbers, at least inexperimental plots in the southern part of the Great Valley here in California. It will be along time before that bee reaches enough numbers to supplant honey bees. I don’t thinkthat will ever come. But the Blue Orchard bee might supplement honey bees in some areaswhere there is a real need and shortage of pollinators."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Blue Orchard Bee (BOB).Image © by Scott Bauer.Overall, it is of concern and it’s hard to predict what will be, but it’s not a happy-lookingpicture.”More Information:For further reports about disappearing pollinators and Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD),please see reports below in the Earthfiles Archive:• 09/26/2007 — North American Honey Bees Still Weak• 09/07/2007 — Honey Bee DNA Study Finds Australian Virus in Colony Collapse Disorder• 06/28/2007 — Hackenberg Apiary, Pennsylvania - 75-80% Honey Bee Loss in 2007.
