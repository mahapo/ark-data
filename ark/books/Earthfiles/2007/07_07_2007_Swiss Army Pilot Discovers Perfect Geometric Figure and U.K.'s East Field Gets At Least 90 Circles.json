Aerial image © 2007 by Francois Blancoud.July 7, 2007 Corcelles-près-Payerne, Switzerland - The Swiss website, 24 Heures (24hours) reports this week a Swiss Army pilot was flying over a wheat field in Corcelles-pres-Payerne, Switzerland, on July 2, 2007, when he saw \"a perfect geometric figure\" ofsix arcs swirled in a flattened circle about 197 feet (60 meters) in diameter.24 Heures: \"Locals in Payerne in the northern part of Vaud are scratchingtheir heads after the discovery of a corn (wheat) field where the crop has beenflattened in a round shape 60 metres wide. The farmer who owns the field saidhe does not know who did the design and he is just as puzzled as others as tohow it got there.François Blanchoud, a Swiss army pilot, first spotted the crop circle, in thefield near Payerne's military airport, while flying over the Broye region thisweek. Surprised by the appearance of the geometric figure, he asked his fatherPierre, a specialist in unexplained phenomena, to accompany him on anotherflight to take photographs of it.\"His father claims the crop circle is 'authentic,' meaning no-one can say whomade it. 'The work is huge,' he said. 'It is not humanly possible.' PierreBlanchoud said the design is too precise to have been the result of heavy rainand 'it is not in the interest of the farmer to flatten the corn (wheat).'\"Pierre Blanchoud said about 20 percent of phenomena initially thought to becrop circles turn out to be made by humans. He claims the others are the resultof 'light balls' that produce microwaves, which heat the corn and flatten thestalks. Crop circle enthusiasts, known as cereologists, have offered variousparanormal and naturalistic explanations for them. However, in England twomen revealed a few years ago that they created a variety of crop circles usingplanks, rope, hats and wire as their only tools.\"The owner of the 7.5-hectare field containing the crop circle in Payerne saidhe will harvest the corn (wheat) in 10 days. But the circle is expected toremain after the harvest as the flattened corn (wheat) will not be collected.\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"197-foot-diameter \"perfect geometric figure\" discovered in wheat field inCorcelles-pres-Payerne, Switzerland, by Swiss Army pilot on July 2, 2007.Aerial image © 2007 by Francois Blancoud.

I couldn't even guess the area covered. It seems to ray out froma very large central circle then all the lines of circles decrease in size tonothing. There are lots of grape shot circles, some with tufts.\"The formation dowsed positive. I borrowed a pendulum from a young lady,when I used it my arm tingled. This happened at New Barn last year.As you can see from my pictures, the lay of the crop is good although afteronly a day it is jumping up again. I couldn't visualize the formation from aboveand wait eagerly for an aerial photograph. Ahh just seen it, wow.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"One of at least 90 different-sized circles reported on July 7, 2007, in the East Fieldof Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, England.
