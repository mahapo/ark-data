For this oneneeds to use a programme like Alias Wavefront, Lightwave or Maya. Oncethis image has been constructed and textured plus the lighting applied and theimage rendered one can use Photoshop to place the image on a photographicbackground.So when people say the dragonfly UFO or any other image has been'Photoshoped' then, technically speaking, this is incorrect as the whole processtakes far more than just Photoshop to complete and therefore such statementsare misleading.As I have nearly 20 years experience of using the Photoshop application andother 3D CGI applications, I for one, believe these images are real, meaningthat I can see no mistakes if it is a manipulation."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I always listen to your reports and podcasts.

I told the story to an old friend and coworker ofmine, who did her best to be supportive, but just couldn't quite accept thestory 'as-is'. We made a friendly bet ($20) that at some point, someone elsewould see what I saw and would come forward with information that backedup my story. Your recent reports bear such a resemblance to what I describedto her that she paid me without argument (in two brand-new $10 bills, by theway ;-)Attached is a sketch of what I saw. As you can see, it's not identical to thephotos you've posted, but it's obvious they're related.Sketches of unidentified aerial object seen on June 10, 2006,at Yosemite National Park, California.As for the story itself, it took place on the 10th of June, 2006. I know thisbecause our trip lasted from the 9th to the 11th and this took place on thesecond night we were there. So the date as I remember it is definitelyaccurate.It was about a half hour before sundown and we were about 10 minutes fromour camp site (we were looking for marshmallow roasting sticks.) We firstnoticed this 'thing' almost directly above us, not much higher than the tops ofthe trees. It looked just like the sketch, despite my lack of drawing skill, andwas moving extremely slowly. The way it moved really looked effortless. Asyou can see in the sketch, it was like two very long, thin shapes connectedwith a ring. The arms looked just like the photos you posted although I don'tremember seeing any of the lettering. It was getting pretty dark, though, so I'm"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"not going to say it wasn't there, I just don't remember seeing anything like that.Coming off the top of the ring were those same curved spike things in thephotos. Unlike the other pictures I've seen, however, the thing I saw also had akind of 'arm' that reached down from the ring as well. I have no idea what anyof these features were for, as I never saw it 'do' anything other than flyaround.My hearing hasn't been that great for the last few years, so I can't say I heardit make any sounds, but my sons both said they remember hearing a very faintcrackling noise that sounds similar to what your articles mention. What I didnotice was more of a 'feeling' than a sound. If you can imagine 'feeling' thechopping sound of a helicopter, rather than hearing it, and if you can imagineit much faster, then that's a pretty good idea of what it was like. But it wasextremely faint, and I admit it's the part of the story I remember the leastclearly. So make of that what you will.I was very unsettled at first. I've been around long enough to know whensomething doesn't 'look right,' and this was one of those things. I've also beencamping since I was a girl and this is the first time I've ever seen anythingstrange in the sky. The boys, however, were fascinated, and my oldest (who is10) decided to shine his flashlight on it to get a better look. By the way, theflashlight he was carrying was a gift from my ex-husband, is extremelypowerful, and is his favorite thing to toy around with on these trips.I didn't even have a chance to react to what he was doing when things gotweird- it was like the moment the light hit the thing, it jerked very quickly andstarted to move in another direction. The boys found this amusing to say theleast. They chased after it and hit it with the light again, which caused it tochange direction a second time. I of course ran to keep up with them, whichwas the first movement I made since I first saw the thing. They did this maybethree or four more times until it finally stopped reacting to them and just -stopped. Like, literally froze in the air without even slowing down. I must say,seeing this thing totally motionless was a lot more unsettling than seeing itmove. Even the boys stopped in their tracks at that point. It just hung there forabout 5 seconds, and then got going again.From then on it stuck to its direction (still moving very slowly) and no longerjerked around. You could say that this moved like the other reports, like a\"water insect\" as I think you put it, but in our case it only seemed to do this inreaction to the flashlights, not on its own.I must admit, I was amazed at how the boys took it all in stride, and this mademe a lot more at ease. Plus, the way this thing freaked out whenever aflashlight touched it made it seem almost harmless in a way. I guess I neverfelt all that scared because I never felt out of control. Of course I worry aboutmy sons more than anything else, but seeing them laugh and shine theirflashlights around under this thing made it seem like there was nothing toworry about (whether that was true or not). It didn't look anything like theso-called 'UFOs' we've all seen, so I wasn't even thinking about aliens andmonsters and stuff. In fact, my first 'rationalization' was that it had somethingto do with weather tracking. Just thinking back on it as I write this, it wasmore weird than it was frightening.This thing never made a big dramatic exit like your articles mention. It wasmoving generally in the direction of our camp site, so we were able to followit as we walked back, and arrived at our tent just as the sun went down. Itkept going, and from then on we never saw it again, including the next night.My oldest in particular had a lot of questions when it was all over, so I simplyleveled with him. I had no idea! I mentioned the weather tracking idea and heseemed to accept it, but I didn't hide the fact that I wasn't sure. I really waslucky this wasn't a scarier experience, because I honestly don't know what Iwould have done to explain it or calm the boys down.The last thing worth mentioning is that about an hour after the event ended,just as I was falling asleep, I heard an - extremely - loud, high-pitched soundcome from somewhere in the distance. It sounded like it was coming from along ways off, but was still loud enough to startle the hell out of us. It was likea buzzing, but - very - loud and very brief. I have no idea if it had anything todo with the craft, but I though I'd mention it.I just looked back and realized I've pretty much written a novel in this email.;-) Sorry to ramble, but it's been almost a year since this happened and in this"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"whole time I haven't had a chance to dump the full story out and not worrythat people are going to call the men in white coats. For similar reasons, I'veasked the boys to refrain from talking much about it, at least in class. Ofcourse they've already blabbed it to all their friends but it hasn't been a bigdeal so far.Fortunately unlike what you posted on the site, none of us have suffered anyheadaches or anything like that. Not yet, that is! ;-)Anyway, I hope this information is useful to you, and I'll be reading your sitein the future to see if this whole mystery can be figured out. I think I've sharedeverything here, but if there's anything else you'd like to know just ask. It'sgood to know that other people have seen these things and that someoneappears to be working hard to figure out what it's all about. Keep it up!\" 4) Eyewitness, May 17, 2006, 10:20 PM, Northridge, California\"Hello Linda,It was May 17, 2006 at 10:20 P.M. Thursday, Northridge Ca. Driving westtowards Canoga Park on Parthenia Street. Driving to the corner of Corbin Aveand Parthenia and about 50 yards to go before reaching the intersection ofCorbin Ave. One other pickup truck was in the lane to my right and slightlybehind me. In front of us there were single family homes. Visibility was clear.We could see the night sky clearly just west of the corner of Corbin Ave.There was a tall, fully rounded tree which was very visible. It is a tree that youcan't miss noticing as it dominates the view. There are other smaller treesthere.When suddenly about three feet above that tree there was a display offluorescentlighting that was similar to firecracker sparklers. The color was apple green,the color of a pippins apple - only the color was brilliant. It took the shape of ahorseshoe crab when viewed from the side.Horseshoe crab.It spread about 30 to 35 ft. The bottom was a straight line to its tail thatforms a point. The top is round from the front to the top and taperinggradually to the point of its tail. This thing whatever it was, and sparkling,took off at the speed of thought and was gone in a blink.Needless to say, it caused both of us to jam on our brakes. We (paralleldrivers) looked at each other and simultaneously said, 'What the hell wasthat?!'Now after seeing the first (Chad) pictures where one of them was sidewaysand showing some kind of wire structure on top that would ignite intosparkles, I can easily see that it would form the shape of a horseshoe crab.Anyway, Linda, I hopes this helps you with your investigation.\"Return to: Birmingham-Type \"Drone\" Seen At Barksdale AFB, La., in Mid-1980s.Return to: Previous Odd Aerial \"Drone?\" Earthfiles.Return to: Engineer Comments About Odd Aerial \"Drone?\" Earthfiles.Return to: Odd Aerial \"Drone\"?

I hope this is okay.My name is Jenna and I participate in a listserv for photographers in Saratoga,CA. Today a member named Stephen posted some pictures he took yesterday(the 5th) for a class assignment in the area around Big Basin. The picturesvery clearly depict some kind of large object in the sky, and he was able to gettwo clear shots and one out-of-focus shot before it apparently disappeared. Irecognized certain details on this object immediately because a friend had sentme your About.com article on different UFOs that have appeared recentlywith a similar appearance.Now, I should mention that this is a private listserv for a very close-knitgroup. I have met almost everyone that participates in person and I have metStephen in particular many times, so I take his word seriously.We have been discussing it for the last couple of hours and I suggested westart by sending pictures to your web site since you clearly have somefamiliarity with this situation so far.
