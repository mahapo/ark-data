That night on Coast to Coast AM with George Noory, I also reported aboutthe Tappen, North Dakota, cattle ranch family that have had an extraordinary series ofevents occur since October 2005.After my January 26th Earthfiles and Coast news updates about the extraordinary Tappen,North Dakota, events, I have received hundreds of emails from viewers and listeners whohave also encountered lights, craft and creatures. In this Part 1, and subsequent reports, Iam sharing some of those many emails without name attribution. My hope is that otherswill come forward with firsthand experiences about interactions with non-humans. Myemail address is: earthfiles@earthfiles.com. All requests for anonymity are respected.9) Place Unidentified - 1993 - Adult FemaleAnother Alien \"Bowing\" Incident\"I'm afraid I would like to remain anonymous, but I would like to tell youwhat happened to me in 1993. I was a nursing student and working part-timewhile going to school. I had come home from school and laid down to take ashort one hour nap before leaving for my part-time home health care job laterthat afternoon. It was daylight and very light in my bedroom.I was fully dressed, just lying on top of the bed resting with my eyes closed,not really even asleep yet when I felt someone watching me. I opened myeyes to see what I first thought was a little boy standing next to the bed justintently looking at me. My first thought was that it was one of the neighbor'skids who came in, since they have four little boys. But as my eyes focused, Irealized it was a pale little character - I guess a kind of hybrid-looking person,but more human looking than alien. He looked almost familiar to me for asecond. He had on a kind of shiny looking jumpsuit, one piece, with noinsignia or zippers or anything that I could see.What surprised me was that I wasn't scared at all, but he obviously was uponseeing that I was looking back at him. He looked startled. I just laid there andlooked at him, which I guess was very odd behavior for me as well. He was soscared that he ran full speed right into a large chest of drawers against the wallat the foot of my bed, as if he thought he was going to run right through it tothe outside back yard. Instead he bounced right off of it and got knockedbackwards.When he righted himself, he turned quickly as if to see if I was still lying thereand not coming after him. He looked terrified of me. He started bowing at meas if to be apologizing or something. Then he ran full speed right at thenightstand next to me. He passed right through it and the lamp and the wall tothe outside! My bedroom was in a corner of the house, so two walls led to theoutside.This event happened all those years ago, but it's like it happened yesterday. Ican remember his pale, pale skin and light wispy hair and his small dark eyes.Yet he seemed almost serene in a way. I never felt threatened at all. For some"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"reason I just felt he was curious about me and just wanted to look at mewithout me knowing it. This experience crosses my mind at least once a day. Ijust can't forget it. I was not asleep, but I was in that in-between state offalling asleep. Once I saw him though, I was completely awake. I didn't feelparalyzed, but just very relaxed and observing him. I didn't feel anycommunication from the pale being, except when he was bowing I felt like hewas saying, 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll leave now.' Almost like a child who wasgoing to get in trouble for coming there.I decided to write to you because of the bowing part of this incident. Hewasn't just nodding, he was bowing, like Chinese people used to do in oldmovies, from the waist forward. When I heard your radio broadcast of thestory from North Dakota, I wanted to write and tell you about it.\" [ Editor'sNote: Evan Briese in Tappen, North Dakota, also saw non-human entities bowand kneel to him as if trying to communicate that their intrusion into the pigcorral did not involve him - only the animal.]10) Yelm, Washington - January 22, 2007 at 2:45 p.m. Pacific - Adult Male\"I am a listener of Coast to Coast, and heard you on the program Friday night,Jan. 26th.My name is -- and on 1-22-07, I had an experience that I can't quite believemyself yet. It was about 2:45 PM in the afternoon. I was on the roof of aconstruction site in a town known as Yelm in Washington state, about a 30Min. drive east of Tacoma. While I was on this roof of a Walmart, inspecting a roof, I caught something inthe sky out of the corner of my eye. We are about 15 min south of McChordAFB. So I thought nothing of it and went on with my work. This was a littlestrange though because I realized that there wasn't an engine or any noisecoming from what I had caught. I looked back up to see what it was, and thatwas when I caught the image of a craft, wasn't really a saucer, but was round.Almost spherical. That was when it passed through a cloud and stopped just asit penetrated the side facing south.That was the side I was on, but it seemed to be right above McChord AFB.This caught me off guard cause as it started to penetrate out of the cloud, thecloud and the craft both stopped the north easterly movement that the cloudswhere moving in. It was a silverish color, almost the color of non-polishedaluminum. This craft stayed in this cloud for about 10 min, and then promptlypulled back into the cloud. Directly after the craft pulled into the cloud, waswhen I noticed what looked like a tunnel forming in the cloud. The tunnelthen just disappeared and the cloud returned to its normal wind drift.Now the part that gets me the most, and please stick with me, the most freakyfor me. After all this happened, I felt a little strange, Wasn't quite sure what Ihad just saw, or what to think. I went to my truck off the roof to sit and takein what had just happened. It was now about 3:30 pm. I was sitting in mytruck for about 3 minutes when through the front windshield of my truck Isaw this tunnel appear in the cloud again. Then the craft that I had seen about30 min earlier, came out of this tunnel, in a totally different cloud this time. Ijust about freaked and got this really dizzy feeling. Just after I got this feeling,I saw this craft appear at a high rate of speed over the site that we were on. Itdisappeared right as it got over the construction site about 5000 feet above us.Rough estimate.That was when all the guys that were up installing the roof came runningdown and asked if I had seen what just happened. We were the only ones onsite, about 5 of us altogether. At that moment we all started getting the feelinglike we were going to faint.I looked at my watch right as these gentlemen asked me if I had seen whatthey saw. It was 3:42 PM on my watch. Immediately after the feeling offaintness, I happened to look at my watch again and in what seemed only 30sec, my watch said that it was 4:49 PM. I can't explain what happened, andneither could the rest of the other 4 gentlemen that were there. Not oneperson said a thing and we all got into our vehicles and left. We left everythingwere it was.I've seen these men twice since the incident, and none of us can remember athing about the time that is missing - except that we all get an overwhelmingfeeling of scaredness, or overwhelming feeling of impending doom. All 5 of us"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"also hear this female voice that says 2011, over and over again throughout theday, each day since it happened. The feeling of overwhelming doom is sostrong that it makes me want to cry. I get shivers, and feel like you would ifyou where looking down the barrel of a gun. It's a very strong intense feeling.\"11) Memphis, Tennessee - Date Unknown, 1 a.m. Central - Adult Male\"I drive a truck for the U.S. Postal Service. I run a regular contracted routetwice a week from Memphis Tennessee to Jersey City, New Jersey with mypartner. I drive the night shift.While driving south on Interstate Highway 81 in the state of Virginia I saw asmall bright red/orange light shooting toward me at a very high rate of speed.It was about 1:00 AM and it was a crystal clear night for a change after nearlytwo weeks of rain and bad weather. There was a cold stiff wind blowing fromthe west to the east at about 20 to 30 miles per hour. The wind was rockingthe truck violently and making for a very hard night of driving.The Interstate highway at this point was running north/south along the side ofa ridge just north of the city of Harrisonburg somewhere near mile marker161. The landscape to the east was low and the land to the west rose gently toabout 150 feet above average terrain. This afforded me a wide panoramicview of the valley to my east. My vantage point was halfway up the slopeabout 75 feet above the eastern landscape. The north bound lanes were about15 to 20 feet below me.This is a rural area and there were only a few homes and farms scatteredthroughout the panorama. There were mostly cattle pastures and a few grovesof trees between me and the Blue Ridge mountains two or three miles to theeast.It was a quiet night and there was very little traffic at this hour. The only othervehicles in view were two other trucks. One was coming toward me on thenorthbound side about a mile away and the other was behind me about half amile to the rear.I was gazing out over the panorama to the east when I saw a small red point oflight racing toward me. The object seemed to be about the size of a softball orgrapefruit but it was hard to tell it's true size and shape due to it's luminance.All I can say for sure is that it was very small. It seemed no larger than the redbeacons that blinked on the top of a couple of radio towers that were alsovisible in the distance.The point of light was flying on a very flat, horizontal trajectory at an altitudeof about 50 feet above average terrain. Just above the tree tops. I noticed thetree tops being illuminated by the glow of the bright object as it flew overthem.I estimate it's speed at approximately 2000 feet per second or around Mach1.5 to Mach 2.0. I could not tell if there was any sound associated with theobject as I was inside a truck and the noise of the engine and the wind wouldhave drowned out any sonic effects. I was also wearing headphones as I waslistening to the radio while my partner slept. The entire episode lasted onlyabout 1.5 to 2 seconds but I saw a whole lot in that brief span of time.It appeared to me that the object would strike the side of the slope in themedian between the north and south bound lanes of the highway but it curvedupward at the last milli-second and shot straight up into the sky in a perfectlyvertical attitude. The light went out and disappeared about 300 feet above thehighway.My very first thought was that it was a military tracer bullet fired from a rifle.I had been in the Army myself and I have seen thousands of tracer roundsfired in my life from all angles. In all respects it looked just like a large calibertracer round except for it's very flat trajectory and the fact that it sweptupwards in a wide arc just before hitting the side of the slope.This collision avoidance maneuver seemed to indicate some intelligent design.It seemed to deliberately avoid colliding with the slope. Besides, I also cannotimagine why anybody would fire a military tracer toward a busy highwayeven if they were from a mile away and it was in the wee hours of the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"morning.Anyway, it could not have been a bullet due to the trajectory behaviors that Iwitnessed and described here. A bullet does not travel on a flat leveltrajectory. They begin to drop toward the ground in a very gentle arc almostfrom the moment they are fired. This object came from a mile out. Over thatdistance a bullet would have had a very noticeable downward arc to it'strajectory. A bullet also does not fly upwards as this object did just beforestriking the hillside. It did not ricochet. The change of direction was a verywide smooth curve not a sudden, angular shift of direction. There was also avery stiff wind blowing. It was traveling straight into the wind without anyapparent loss of energy or velocity.It was not a firework or other pyrotechnic device due to the speed anddistance that it traveled. There was no trail of sparks or sign of smoke whichwould have been visible in it's luminance. The object illuminated thelandscape beneath it with the brilliance of a high wattage spotlight. Anysmoke trail would have been likewise illuminated.This may seem like a minor event compared to the type of reports that you getbut this object clearly defies any logical explanation.\"12) Yuma, Arizona - November 1975? - Male Adult\"I live in Yuma, AZ, and I had an encounter with something that left me withmissing time and little memory of what happened at the time. Years later bitsand pieces began to come back and what I was remembering was nothingshort of unbelievable.First lets get my credibility straight. I was a correctional officer for two yearsand then I ran for public office. I lost, but I gave the incumbent a run for hismoney. I would truly like to be hypnotized and see what really happened.This happened around the same time frame that Travis Walton (November 5to November 9, 1975, abduction for five days) got unwelcome notoriety forhis encounter (give or take a year I am not really sure). It was the middle ofthe day spring time in AZ and I was in a very good mood. I like to go into thedesert as it seems to have a tranquil affect on my well being. I headed outtowards Picacho Peak just across the border in California's Imperial Countywhere there is a 20 mile dirt road that ultimately leads to the Colorado rivernear an old mining town. I was cruising along northbound in the brightsunshine in an American motors Hornet when I noticed my radio going backand forth across the dial. This was very strange and I remember turning theradio on and off in an attempt to make it stop.When it did not stop, I just thought that I would get to it later. It was shortlyafter this that I looked out at the hood of my car and noticed that it appearedto be in the shade. As I am a rational person, I thought this is not possible. Iam traveling at around 35 miles an hour and there is not much shade in thedesert, especially shade that moves. I then looked to the driver's side anddown at the ground and noticed that there was shade and it was following me.I then looked up and saw a round object no more than 100 feet give or take.I tried to slow down, but the car was no longer responsive to me. I turned thesteering wheel and had no control. I laid down on the seat saying to myselfand out loud \"this is not happening,\" but it was in fact. My car eventuallystopped and I pretended to be paralyzed with fear (partly true) when the carwas approached by what I think were two short beings and one very tall beingstanding off at a bit of a distance. The two short beings - one stood next to theback door and the other opened the driver's door. It was opened with quite aforce as some doors make a pop sound when they are opened too far and thisdoor made that sound.It was at this point I had a fight or flee response and I jumped out of the carand reached over the top of the driver door and hit the one that opened mydoor as hard as I could. It felt like I had hit a balloon! There was not muchmass to it. The being immediately let out a squeal that can only be describedas other worldly. I then was overcome with remorse and felt sorry that I hadhit it.From behind, I think it was the large being that grabbed me and I said, 'OK,OK, stop!' I somehow managed to slip away and ran just far enough to get agood look at the whole scene. I saw the angry, tall (and very beautiful) being"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"started to communicate to me with outstretched hands as though it weretalking, but not really talking. I can describe this as the same way a personwould communicate with an animal - it doesn't matter what is said as long as itis said in a sweet manner.The next bit of time is fuzzy. I was looking through a window of sorts and sawthe tall being standing at the end of a table like structure that was sunken in.Another being was sitting 10 or 15 feet away at some sort of console. Therewere about 4 more short beings standing with the tall one, but there wasabsolutely no movement. Then a being came and looked at me through thewindow. He gave me what I can only describe as a dirty look. I believe that Imay have been taunting them, but its fuzzy.I can then remember being on what I thought was the outside of the objectand going up. I looked to the south and saw the Sea of Cortez about 90 milesaway. I then realized I was having trouble breathing and I stated out loudnumerous times that I am going to die if you leave me here.The next thing I remember was being behind the wheel headed back to townwith an overwhelming urge to not look into my rear view mirror or even intothe back seat. I was driving back when I felt an itch on my leg and noticed asmall scab on the outside of my right leg, the same as when you get a shot.Then I noticed that there was another on my left leg in the same spot. When Iarrived back at home about three hours after I had left, I found my mommindlessly sweeping the garage and she seemed to not notice me. I thought tomyself, 'That's odd.'I went in the house and greeted my dad who was at the dining room table andhe said to me, \"Your friends came by.\" I asked who, but he just repeated thesame thing. Then he said to me they brought your knife back. After muchinquiry, dad still could not tell me who those friends were. He appeared verysubdued, which was rather odd again for a retired Sgt Major USMC. I didhave that knife in my pocket when I left earlier that day.One of the things that I will never forget is the smell associated with thisexperience. If I ever smell it again, I will know immediately. As I live andbreath I attest this to be truthful as close as I can recall.\"To be continued in Part 3More Information:For further information about the UFO phenomenon, please see reports below: inEarthfiles Archives and in my books and documentaries listed in the Earthfiles Shop:• 02/07/2007 -- Part 11: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 01/30/2007 -- Part 10: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 01/16/2007 -- Part 9: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 01/02/2007 -- Grey Aerial Disk Reported by Chicago O'Hare United Airlines Pilots and Mechanics• 12/27/2006 -- Part 7: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 12/18/2006 -- Part 6: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 12/14/2006 -- Abductee Jim Sparks's Encounter with Reptillian Beings, Their Warning and Possible Agenda• 12/11/2006 -- Part 5: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 12/06/2006 -- Part 4: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 11/28/2006 -- Part 2: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 11/27/2006 -- Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue © 1957 by Leonard H.
