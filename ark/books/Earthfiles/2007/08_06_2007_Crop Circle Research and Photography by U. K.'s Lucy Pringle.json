K.'s Lucy Pringle© 2007 by Linda Moulton Howe\"There comes a time when the mind touches a higher plane of knowledge,but can never prove how it got there.\" - Albert Einstein, PhysicistAugust 6, 2007 Petersfield, Hampshire, England - Lucy Pringle has beenphotographing crop formations from the air and on the ground since 1993. Her latest book,Crop Circles: Art in the Landscape, was released as a North American edition in July2007. This book has prints large enough to study in detail - some photographs are given2-page spreads. From her hundreds of English crop formation photographs since the early1990s, Lucy focused on ninety-five crop formations. Her photographs sweep you into thepage as if you were in the air with her. A good example is Furze Hill near Beckhamptonand the ancient stone circles of Avebury reported on June 5, 2005.Wheat pattern 600-feet-long at Furze Hill near Beckhampton, Wiltshire, England,reported on June 5, 2005. Aerial image © 2005 by Lucy Pringlefrom her book Crop Circles: Art in the Landscape © 2007.Recently I talked with Lucy Pringle by phone about the current 2007 English cropformations - some of the most outstanding patterns on record - and what provoked herdoing her latest and third book about the crop formation mystery.Interview: Lucy Pringle, Author, Crop Circles: Art in the Landscape © 2007, Hampshire,England: “In this 2007 crop circles season, what has impressed me most were the spiraland single circle at Yatesbury."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Yatesbury Field, Wiltshire, England, reported May 30, 2007, fifty-seven swirled barleycircles in large spiral about 300 feet in diameter; in foreground, a 60-foot-diametersingle circle in wheat. Aerial image © 2007 by Peter White.Also see: Cropcircleconnector.com.It had rained the night before and there was mud everywhere when the first people walkedto it. But there were no traces of mud anywhere on the spiral or circle - absolutely pristine!And the single circle in the field next to the spiral had the most extraordinary ground lay. Iburied my little bottles of water in that circle to test for concentrations of nitrate nitrogen(NO3).\"[ Editor's Note: Nitrogen is found in the cells of all living things and is a majorcomponent of proteins. Inorganic nitrogen may exist in the free state as a gasN2, or as nitrate NO3-, nitrite NO2-, or ammonia NH3+.Nitrate nitrogen is a commonly used lawn and agricultural fertilizer. It is also achemical formed in the decomposition of waste materials, such as manure orsewage. If infants less than six months of age drink water (or formula madewith water) that contains more than 10 mg/L nitrate nitrogen, they aresusceptible to methemoglobinemia. This disease interferes with the blood’sability to carry oxygen. Recent studies also suggest that high nitrate watermay be linked to birth defects and miscarriages, so pregnant women shouldavoid drinking high nitrate water. High nitrate levels also suggest that othercontaminants might be present.

Jim Lyons at York University thinks this is the one substance that is going toshow up when the force of energy that makes crop formations hits the ground. Our waterbottles were tested blind.What Jim Lyons has found so far is that Bottle 440 showed a 71.3% in the nitrate nitrogencontent compared to the control bottle, which was buried the furthest away from theformation. In fact, Bottle 440 was buried in the center of that Yatesbury single circle.What was so extraordinary is that the results on the bottled water went in a descendingscale from the center out to the furthest bottle. Jim Lyons told me today that the nitratenitrogen content in Bottle 440, which was in the center was 2.57 milligrams per liter. Ichecked the Volvic water for the nitrate content in milligrams per liter. It is 6.3.But the highest content in the center buried bottle was 71.3 % over the control sample,which was only 2.57 milligrams per liter versus the 6.3 normally listed in Volvic water. So,what we are finding is a diminishing quantity of nitrate nitrogen. Why is that happening?We don’t know.ANY HYPOTHESIS?Not yet. Jim Lyons is working on it."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"THE SMALL CIRCLE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN TIED TO THE SPIRAL. DID YOU DOANY BURYING IN THE SPIRAL?No, I regret that now.

A friend of minewent in and she felt terrific energy in one specific spot. She called to another researcher tocome and stand there. He was taking pole shot photographs. He had three rechargeablebatteries, which he had charged fully. But every time he put the batteries in his camera inthat East Field formation, they completely drained of all power.He had another fourth battery that was completely new, but he hardly got it into hiscamera when that one went completely dead as well.My friend who called and said the East Field formation has terrific energy had terrible painin her legs that night. She wondered if calcium had been reduced in her muscles bywhatever energy was in the East Field? Lucy's Latest and Third BookAbout Crop Circle MysteryCrop Circles: Art in the Landscape © 2007 by Lucy Pringle.Lucy's previous two books: Crop Circles: The Greatest Mystery ofModern Times © 1999 and Crop Circles © 2004.WHAT PROVOKED YOUR LATEST BOOK, ART IN THE LANDSCAPE?The book goes back to where I began, a gathering together in anthology of my images from1993 onwards in the Wessex triangle and as far out as Cambridge. It was a challenge and Iam lucky to have a publisher who wanted the highest quality. When you open up the book,on the inside of the book cover is a 2-page-wide photograph of the \"yin yang\" thatappeared in Avebury around 2002.THE LARGE PHOTOGRAPHS THROUGHOUT THE BOOK REINFORCE THEARTISTRY OF THE CROP FORMATIONS.They are forms of art with so many geometries. It’s as if we have a universalconsciousness at work, rather like Rupert Sheldrake talked about the morphic resonance –a consciousness passed along in the ether."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - \"'Morphic field' is a term introduced by Britishbiologist, Rupert Sheldrake, the major proponent of this concept firstpresented in his Hypothesis of Formative Causation in the early 1980s.Morphic fields have been described as the universal database for both organic(living) and abstract (mental) forms.\" Basically, the concept is that at theunseen level are pre-existing templates in which matter creates forms.\"Sheldrake proposes that the process of morphic resonance leads to stablemorphic fields, which are significantly easier to tune into. He suggests that thisis the means by which simpler organic forms synergistically self-organize intomore complex ones, and that this model allows a different explanation for theprocess of evolution itself.\" ]Some of my friends say to me, ‘Lucy, I really don’t know what you are doing. Year afteryear you pursue this. We know they are all manmade. I cannot understand why you aredoing this.’Then several of them looked at my new book, sat down with it and became completelyquiet. One of them said, ‘Now, I know. Here they all are right in front of us on these pagesand we can see the progression and we can see they are all different. People didn’t makethese!’ My friends are now awestruck. And I think that’s what the world needs is to havetheir eyes opened up. In my book, there is picture after picture after picture.People who had ridiculed before now suddenly can’t say that anymore, which is sodelicious. The circles are winning aren’t they?!THE ACTRESS, SARAH MILES IS QUOTED ON THE BACK OF YOUR BOOK: ‘THECIRCLES DRAW ME LIKE A MAGNET YEAR AFTER YEAR, EVER CLOSER TO THEIRMIND-EXPANDING MYSTERY.’ I WONDER WHAT IT IS THAT MAKES THE SMALL PERCENTAGE OF US HAVESUCH INTENSE INTEREST AMID A WORLD THAT HAS BEEN CONDITIONED BYGOVERNMENT MISINFORMATION TO DISMISS EVERYTHING AS MANMADE?This is one of the joys of the circles. If you are ready for them, you see them and want toinvestigate them. If you are not ready for them, and are fearful – there are so many people,even intelligent, who cannot cope with this subject. They cannot cope with theunexplained. Remember Doug and Dave in 1991? So many people were relieved by thatridiculous explanation, when all the actual evidence pointed the opposite direction: thosetwo men made only a few circles in two counties of England!IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS BECAUSE THERE HAD BEEN CROP FORMATIONS INTWENTY-THREE COUNTRIES IN THE SUMMER OF 1991.Exactly. And I think it’s still the agenda of the powers that be that this subject of cropformations is more serious than they like to admit publicly and therefore, they have toridicule it. That’s their best offensive – to ridicule. Obviously Doug and Dave were set up.Dave couldn’t keep his story straight and someone packed him off to Australia.Subsequently there, he became an alcoholic and died. Those two men were used. There isno doubt about it in my mind. They were brought out just at the time that the cropformations were gaining global momentum.WHAT GETS ME IS HOW COULD THE NEW YORK TIMES AND THE LONDONTIMES ACCEPT A LOCAL EXPLANATION FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS GLOBALWITHOUT ANY INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION OF THEIR OWN?My guess would be that there were authorities directing those newspapers how to portrayit. I think that manipulation, misinformation, continues to this day.What annoys authorities is that the phenomenon and mystery continue. The cropformations don’t go away! Apart from the beauty of the formations are all the hardscientific evidence such as my bottles of water and biophysicist W. C. Levengood’s workwith the plants and soil that you have long reported about in your Earthfiles and your ownbook, Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles.Then there is the magic of it all – what I call the ‘cathedral effect.’ When you go in theformations, you feel as if you are isolated from the rest of the world, even if you are closeto a main road. You might see cars going by, but you’re not part of that while you’re in thecrop formation. The formations seem to have their own unique spacetime dimensions. Global Crop Formations - Why?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"WHY DO YOU THINK, LUCY, AFTER A QUARTER CENTURY, THERE STILL IS NOANSWER TO WHAT THE CROP FORMATION PURPOSE IS?First, I think in our wildest imaginations, we never seem to keep up with the ingenuity ofthe circle-making force. It comes up with the most amazing new creations every singleyear. We’re all left in a perpetual state of amazement.WHICH IS A COMMENT ITSELF ON THE COMPLEXITY OF THE INTELLIGENCEBEHIND THE FORMATIONS.This is why I love the spiral and circle. They appeared in rain and mud without any tracksand challenge interpretation.People always ask me what the crop formations are doing? I think part of their function isto challenge dogmas. Humanity has to get rid of preconceived ideas. We’ve got to openour minds to things we have not met before and to things we don’t understand. I think thisis one of the crop formation messages, if you like.CRACKING OPEN OUR MINDS.Cracking open our minds – yes, indeed!\"More Information:To order directly from Lucy Pringle, click on: http://www.lucypringle.co.ukAlso being carried by Barnes and Noble bookstores.Crop Circles: Art in the Landscape © 2007 by Lucy Pringle.If viewers have more information about other crop formations in your area, please emailme at earthfiles@earthfiles.comFor further reports about crop formations, please see reports below in the EarthfilesArchive and my book Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles in the Earthfiles Shop:• 07/27/2007 — Part 1: 1,033-Foot-Long East Field Wheat Formation \"Happened Within 90 Minutes.\"• 07/27/2007 — Part 2: Military Helicopters Over East Field Wheat Formation• 07/23/2007 — 070707 East Field Wheat Formation: Viewer Comments• 07/07/2007 — Swiss Army Pilot Discovers \"Perfect Geometric Figure\" and U.K.'s East Field Gets Circles!• 06/29/2007 — Another \"Drone\" This Week Near Maxwell AFB• 06/18/2007 — Crop Circles On Rings and Three Mysterious Aerial Lights in Slovenia• 06/06/2007 — Part 2: Yatesbury, England and Madisonville, Tennessee - A Mayan Link?• 06/05/2007 -- Part 2: U.
