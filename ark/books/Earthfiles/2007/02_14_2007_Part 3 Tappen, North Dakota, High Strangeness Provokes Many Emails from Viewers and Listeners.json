That night on Coast to Coast AM with George Noory, I also reported aboutthe Tappen, North Dakota, cattle ranch family that have had an extraordinary series ofevents occur since October 2005.After my January 26th Earthfiles and Coast news updates about the extraordinary Tappen,North Dakota, events, I have received hundreds of emails from viewers and listeners whohave also encountered lights, craft and creatures. In this Part 1, and subsequent reports, Iam sharing some of those many emails without name attribution. My hope is that otherswill come forward with firsthand experiences about interactions with non-humans. Myemail address is: earthfiles@earthfiles.com. All requests for anonymity are respected.13) Louisiana - January 27, 2007 - Adult Female\"I read about the recent experiences of a farming family in Tappen, NorthDakota, and the death of their sow and other problems they have encounteredrelevant to possible encounters with unusual craft and beings. I will try andrespond as per your request to hear from experiencers of such events. I havedecided the best way to begin is from the most recent experiences I have hadand work back in time from those.My most recent sighting event was on January 27, 2007, around 11 PM atnight or later...can't be exact on this as I was outside feeling compelled to 'skywatch,' as is often the case. After some time, I observed two large, bright,white lights moving at tree-top level in the east. We live in a country/foresttype out-of-the-way location. I thought at first they may have been landinglights turned on as the Shreveport airport here in Louisiana often has planescome in over this flight path direction and the lights can be startling at first.It turned out not to be the case this time, the lights were moving very slowlytogether, from north to south direction in the area. They then hovered forabout 10 seconds and then went back northerly and hovered again. They didthis kind of maneuver for about 10 minutes or so before finally disappearingwithout changing in size. They were about the size of 2 golf balls held at armslength, seemed fairly good-sized.....just fading away. No sound involved at allwith these lights and I got the impression that they were acting independentlyof each other and not connected to one airborne craft.About one hour after the objects disappeared, I observed a very bright flash oflight and white object/streak, at altitude, extremely high and fast, on a directeasterly heading. No sound and the light was rapid and in view for shortduration...about 3 seconds?? I felt very tired after all of this and went to bedand had an extreme urge to fall asleep, which is very unusual for me...I havesleep problems. I woke the next day with extreme eye irritation which lastedfor about one week duration. I was watching History Channels UFO Fileswhen I heard of 2 separate UFO witnesses complain of eye irritation after asighting...like eye burns from a welding incident and that sounded exactly likewhat I was feeling/experiencing."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The above is just the 'tip' of the iceberg...I have been an experiencer sincearound 4 yrs. old, in New Jersey, around July 1946. Once, when driving atnight from my hospital work as a nurse, I had about 20 min. of missing time,involved me AND my car and ending up in a totally different location after abright light came upon me from above/behind. An intense 'vibration' feelingwas involved and a voice/feeling in my head realizing that such had occurredto me before and not to be afraid.I had an experience in the 1980s where I remember being transported from myhome in Haughton, La., at night, to a craft hovering outside in the wooded areawhere we lived at the time. Most memorable was the fact that I was put into atank of some kind of thick fluid...the tank was about 7 feet long, 4 ft. wide andabout 2 1/2 ft. deep. I saw four of what are now called the 'greys,' peering overme....about 4 ft. tall or so.I was amazed, a few months later, to read in OMNI magazine that someexperiencers were reporting memories of being submerged in a fluid filledtank...I read this well AFTER my own experience and was shocked and quitetaken aback by the article. It seemed to confirm, in my mind, that thatparticular event was NOT a dream, although it did have 'dream-like' qualitiesto it. Also, my own research has revealed that liquid filled tanks possiblyenable travel in space with less problems/affects from the 'G' forces?\"14) Chatham, New Jersey - 1963 - 14 to 15-Year-Old Male\"I'm 58 now, and when I was about 14-15, I was camping out in the woodswith my buddies in Chatham, NJ. We were sitting around a fire and I noticedan orb in a tree less than 20 feet away about 8 feet up. Trying to stay as calmas I could, I asked my friends to look up in the tree. I looked away and theyscreamed and then it disappeared. It was a luminescent orb about 16\" indiameter bluish /greenish glow.20 years ago (1987) while going to a plastics convention in Nashville, I saw ashinny sphere, maybe 13-15 feet in diameter - chrome, like a chrome marble,tracking our plane. It stayed in the same relative position for at least 10 to 15minutes prior to diving down and then popping up vertical. Once it arched upfrom the dive.The time of this transition was maybe 1 to 1-1/2 seconds. During thismaneuver, the chrome sphere kept pace with the plane.To my colleague next to me, I said: 'Look, Bob, a UFO!'He said, 'No, it's a plane.'I said, 'Bob, do you see any wings?'He said, 'No.'I asked, 'Any tail?'Bob said, 'No.'At this point, I grabbed him by the shirt collar and shook him.Then he said, 'You're right it is a UFO.'\"Sketch of chrome sphere's movements in relationship to airliner in 1987en route to Nashville, Tennessee. Sketch prepared by eyewitness."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"15) Westchester, New York - 1955 to 1956, 6 to 7:30 PM - 6 to 7-Year-Old Male\"I have seen three UFOs in my 58 years on this earth. The first UFO I saw waswhen I was 6 or 7 years old about 1955 or 56. I was at a boarding school inWestchester, NY, called Graham School. This school overlooks the HudsonRiver. I was coming out of the front of the main building which overlooks afield. It was after watching a movie that started at about 6 PM and was overabout 7:30 PM.I had an escort with me he was older and had to watch over me because of myage. I stood on the front steps and saw a small crowd of about 20 older boys ina circle in the middle of the field. I said to my escort, 'What are they doingdown there?' He said, 'Let's go see.'So we walked over to them where they were all looking up in the sky. I asked,'What are you all looking at?'I was told to look up and there it was, a large black disk with about 12different colored lights spinning slowly in a clockwise direction. It made nosound. I could not see the sky for at least fifty feet in any direction. Thedisk-like object seemed to be about fifty feet above us. We all stared at theobject for what seemed to be 2 or 3 minutes. Then the disk-shaped object wentstraight up and zigzagged to the west and out of sight in about 2 seconds.Eyew itness: \"I have included a photo taken in Waterbury, Conn. of a UFO.These are like the color lights I saw at Graham School when I was a child, but the lightswe saw back in 1955 to 1956 were in the center of the disk, not just the outside.\"We all were amazed at the speed at which this disk accelerated. For somereason not much was said among the group after the object left, we all justdispersed and I went back to our cottages. I was met by the House Motherwho then asked my escort, 'Why are you coming in so late?'We seemed to be the only ones up and the whole house was dark andeveryone was asleep. Everyone in the house was to be in bed by 9 PM or 10PM at the latest for the older boys. Yet, the movie was only an hour or so? Forsome reason nothing more was said about the black disk. I never mentioned itto anyone until I was in my twenties!The second UFO that I saw was in Upper Manhattan about 1986. I waswalking my dog in Inwood Park near the Hudson River. I looked up and sawthis large green light. It was in a circle and about the size of a small airplane. Itwas about 200 feet up and slowly going over the Henry Hudson Bridgeheading east toward the Bronx. It made no sound and slowly moved out ofsight to the east.The last UFO I saw was in 1989 on Long Island, N.Y. in the town ofPlainview. I was working for Grumman Aerospace at the time and was rentingthe bottom half of a Mother-Daughter House. One night about 1 AM, my landlady called my name and made sure I was up and then told me to go to thedoor and look outside to the sky. It was a clear night and the moon was out.There was not a cloud in the sky except one small cloud moving slowly to thewest. Inside the cloud was electrical lights flashing, like lightening. The cloudmade no sound and kept on moving west. I have asked a lot of weather menabout this and have not got an explanation as to what type of cloud this was.\"16) Sandpoint, Idaho - Spring of 1985 - Adult Female\"I listened to your Coast broadcast the other night (January 26, 2007) aboutthe UFO encounter in North Dakota. The experiences I have had are notnearly as"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"dramatic, but I thought I would e-mail you the one that I think is the mostunusual.In the spring of 1985 in Moscow, Idaho, at approx. 8:00 AM in the morning,I woke up, got out of bed and reached for my robe. It was bright and sunnyand a slight breeze was blowing through the open window above the bed. Thewindow was propped open and there was no screen. As I was putting my robeon, I looked over to where my now ex-husband was still sleeping. There about3ft. above and to the right of him was a metal looking canister shaped UFOhovering in the air. It resembled a large coffee can with a top like a grain silo.A pink, pencil-thick beam of light was coming out of it and was aimed at myex-husband, moving slowly across his face just above his right eyebrow.I moved to the foot of the bed and watched it for a minute or so and thenmoved closer to within touching distance of it. I tried to get up the courage totouch it and reached out 3 times. The third try seemed to alert the UFO as itgot still, pulled in the beam and shot out the open window.My feelings are that the UFO itself was alive or aware, not just a machine andno little people inside like a craft.\"17) Peoria, Illinois - November 1959 - Adult Female\"It was Nov. 1959. We lived on a bluff overlooking the Illinois River in Peoria,Illinois. There were large picture windows in the bedroom. I awoke at about5:00 AM. I had a baby of a few months. Out the picture window just over thebluff, there was a huge, bright, white light. It was oblong like the shape of ablimp. It made no sound, but it appeared to vibrate or move slightly. There wasa contrail type part.All of a sudden this tail raised and the thing shot across the river and over thehills on the other side of the river and out of sight. It went very fast. It hadbeen very near the houseâmaybe 300 feet away at eye level.When the first national news came on the radio, it said that an unexplainedobject had been seen over 3 states and had been chased by planes from theNaval Air station in Chicago, but it had gone so fast it could not be caught. Aneighbor also living on the river bluff and up with a new baby saw it also, asdid my husband. I called the airport and they said they had watched it from thetower. A radio station had a roving reporter called 'Big Red' who drove aroundall night. I called the station and they said he had watched it for some timeover the river. I called our newspaper and gave the story to the newsroom.In the paper that night there was no local news about it - only an AssociatedPress article that said it had been seen and explained as possibly a weatherballoon that got away, or anti-radar foil that had been dropped. I am sure itwas neither. When my old neighbor was in town a few years ago she said,'Suzy, donât let anyone say you did not see that thing. I saw it too!'I feel very privileged to have seen a UFO in my lifetime. The baby is now aUnited Airlines pilot. He flies into OâHare, but was not there the daysomething was seen there. I have asked him if he has ever talked to any pilotswho have seen any UFOs when flying and he has not. The one I saw did nothave any colored lights and there did not appear to be structure like metal oranything.\"18) Augusta, Georgia - Summer 2006 - Adult Female Police Officer\"Last summer, multiple reports came in about plane crashes in the swamp nearthe Augusta Airport - several reports over a couple of weeks. My husband andI saw something. My husband saw it first. He came home from work and toldme that he saw something that looked like a meteor, only it was not goingdown. It was going across the sky.About two weeks later, we were driving home when we saw somethingstrange. This is where it gets weird. My memories and my husband's are notthe same. They don't seem to take place in the same area. I remember being atHighway 25 and Willis Foreman Road and looking up out of the passenger sideof the truck. I saw a large object hovering above the trees. The instant I lookedup, the sky lit up like daylight, extremely bright, white light. I remember ablue-white light illuminating the inside of cars passing by. But that particularmemory is strange and feels wrong to me - I don't know why.Anyway, when the sky lit up, the craft took off. The blue-white light moved so"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"fast, it was not like it was flying. It was like it jumped through space andreappeared off in the distance. When it reappeared, several small white ballsof light came from it and started moving at tremendous speed, changingdirection rapidly. They just zigzagged all over the place. I continued to seethem almost all the way home that night. My husband remembers the incidentoccurring at a different location on the same road.I saw several things in the sky a few weeks later, maybe 15 or 20 white lightsmoving to the south fairly quickly. Now calls are coming in again here aboutplane crashes in the swamp. They started about three weeks ago in January2007. And my husband saw them again a few nights ago. It was extremelyovercast. You should not have been able to see the stars or anything else. Buthe saw them. He said there were several of them and the lights glowed blueand red and white. They glowed very bright and then blinked out.I don't know what's going on. My husband's memories differ slightly frommine, but he doesn't talk about it. I wonder why we disagree on the point ofcontact and why my memories feel wrong? We are both in law enforcement.We do not wish to be known as we will probably find ourselves in theunemployment line if we come forward. If you are interested, start payingattention to reports about the sky in southern Augusta, Georgia. There is anuclear power plant there, as well as Savannah River Site close by.\"To be continued in Part 4More Information:For further information about the UFO phenomenon, please see reports below: inEarthfiles Archives and in my books and documentaries listed in the Earthfiles Shop:â¢ 02/07/2007 -- Part 11: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blueâ¢ 01/30/2007 -- Part 10: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blueâ¢ 01/16/2007 -- Part 9: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blueâ¢ 01/02/2007 -- Grey Aerial Disk Reported by Chicago O'Hare United Airlines Pilots and Mechanicsâ¢ 12/27/2006 -- Part 7: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blueâ¢ 12/18/2006 -- Part 6: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blueâ¢ 12/14/2006 -- Abductee Jim Sparks's Encounter with Reptillian Beings, Their Warning and Possible Agendaâ¢ 12/11/2006 -- Part 5: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blueâ¢ 12/06/2006 -- Part 4: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blueâ¢ 11/28/2006 -- Part 2: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blueâ¢ 11/27/2006 -- Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue Â© 1957 by Leonard H.
