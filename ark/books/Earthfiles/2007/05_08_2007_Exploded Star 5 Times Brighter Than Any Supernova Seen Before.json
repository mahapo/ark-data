It's really astonishing.\"- Nathan Smith, Ph.D., UC-Berkeley May 8, 2007 Cambridge, Massachusetts - The brightest supernova ever seen by humaneyes was discovered in Fall 2006 by NASA's orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory and theLick Observatory ground-based optical telescope. The exploded star is called \"SN 2006gy\"and is five times brighter than hundreds of supernovae seen before. SN 2006gy is also themost energetic stellar explosion ever recorded. In fact, astronomers wonder if it is a newtype of explosion that did not become a black hole like other supernovae, took 70 days toreach its supernova peak and remained brighter than other known supernovae for severalmonths.Illustration of SN 2006gy supernova in the constellation Perseusabout 238,000,000 light-years from Earth. Illustration courtesy NASA/CXC/M.Weiss.The Chandra X-Ray Observatory science team in Cambridge, Massachusetts, reports:\"The fireworks-like material in white shows the explosion of an extremely massive star.This debris is pushing back two lobes of cool, red gas that were expelled in a large eruptionfrom the star before it exploded. The green, blue and yellow regions in these lobes showswhere gas is being heated in a shock front as the explosion material crashes into it andpushes it backwards. Most of the optical light generated by the supernova is thought tocome from debris that has been heated by radioactivity, but some likely comes from theshocked gas.\" Lick Infrared and Chandra X-rayImages of SN 2006gy"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Left: Infrared image, using adaptive optics at the Lick Observatory, of galaxy NGC 1260'scenter (dimmer) that contains SN 2006gy (brighter).

The reason it'snot the explosion of a low-mass star is that if it had been a white dwarf star exploding intoa dense, hydrogen-rich environment, SN 2006gy would have been about 1,000 timesbrighter in X-rays than what Chandra detected.\"More Information:For further information about astronomical events, please see reports below in theEarthfiles Archive:• 03/30/2007 -- Fastest Orbiting Object in Our Solar System is One of Strangest• 01/07/2007 -- Universe's Mysterious Dark Matter - First 3-D Map• 12/19/2006 -- First Stars - Or First Black Holes - in Universe?• 12/01/2006 -- Deep Impact and Stardust: Are Comets Made of the Same Stuff?• 11/27/2006 -- Namibia Telescopes Find First \"Gamma Clock\" in Milky Way Galaxy• 11/09/2006 -- Outer Space Sunshade to Cool Earth in Global Warming?• 10/23/2006 -- One, Maybe Two, More Mysterious Radio Bursts from Galactic Center• 05/19/2006 -- Simple \"Binocular\" Telescope Finds Another Planet Beyond Solar System• 04/22/2006 -- Cassiopeia A Is Not Dying Peacefully.
