The day before, on September 10th, 2001,then Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, declared his own war on the Pentagonbureaucracy for wasting so much unaccounted money. Sec. Rumsfeld said, “According tosome estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions.”One of Rumsfeld’s worried employees was Jim Minnery from the Defense Department’sFinance and Accounting Service. He backed up Rumsfeld by saying, \"We know the moneyis gone. But we don't know what they spent it on.\" Minnery, a former Marine turnedwhistle-blower, risked his job by speaking out about millions of dollars missing fromDepartment of Defense (DOD) balance sheets.Twenty years earlier in the early 1980s, Department of Defense Analyst Franklin Spinneyalso made headlines exposing what he called \"accounting games in which the books arecooked routinely year after year.”Trillions of dollars “ cooked” – by whom? And for what reason? These questions werebehind one of the presentations at the Las Vegas UFO Crash Retrieval ConferenceNovember 10-11, 2007. Michael Schratt, 38-year-old, has always had a passion forstudying airplanes and even took some Parks College courses in aerospace engineering inSt. Louis. He did not earn a degree, but he went on to become an autocad draftsmanworking on aerospace components. Today, he is an Aerospace draftsman for ArmstrongAerospace based in Elmhurst Illinois.Michael has a theory about where all the black budget DOD trillions have been going overthe past 60 years: to fund a TOP SECRET space program that no citizen in the UnitedStates knows about – including most of Congress. If true, it means that NASA is onlypublic window dressing for a much bigger and more advanced American clandestineprogram to dominate and weaponize space. Schratt thinks it all began in the 1940s whenPresidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman realized that non-human,“celestial” and “interplanetary” technologies were interacting with our planet. By 1958,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the public arm of a space program - NASA - is what Michael Schratt thinks was created inparallel with another secret space program.Interview:Michael Schratt, Aerospace Draftsman, Armstrong Aerospace, Elmhurst, Illinois: “ We’re spending multiple billions of dollars on classified black budget programs with noCongressional oversight whatsoever. One quick example is a document that I ran across atthe Library of Congress, which is directly in back of the Capitol in Washington, D. C. There you can pick up a document called, “DOD Budget for Fiscal Year 1994” orwhatever year.The new budget is handed out to Congress every January and the document has thesubtitle: RD T&E Programs (R-1), which stands for Research Development Test &Evaluation Programs R-1. It’s approximately 24 pages in length and when you go throughthis document, it starts to describe a number of programs that the Air Force is involved inand the funding for particular programs and they are called “Program Elements” or “LineItem Numbers.”When you look through the budget document, it gives you specific details about a numberof programs they are working on, such as Foreign Technology Division.

Then the other is a muchmore privatized defense contractor program that is exempt from Congressional oversight.I did interview a number of retired Skunk Works engineers who did work on thoseprograms and said they did reach the flying status, so a number of those programs were aflying prototype."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Wright-Patterson AFB Hangar #4, Bay E.

And I can highlight a document that was written by Mr. Ben Rich, theformer head of Lockheed Skunk Works just after Kelly Johnson. Rich took over the reinsfrom Johnson back in 1975. Ben Rich was a very close friend of John Andrews, who wasthe Senior Special Projects of Special Divisions at Testor’s Model Corporation in SanDiego, California. John would ask Ben Rich questions about classified aircraft and Ben never released anyspecific classified answers, but he did provide John Andrews some interesting points. Oneof these points was a question that John posed to Ben Rich. He was asking Ben if he was abeliever in manmade UFOs and extraterrestrial UFOs. We have Ben’s response – I’mlooking at this document. It’s dated July 21, 1986. It’s on official Lockheed letterheadfrom Ben Rich."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Ben Rich and the F-117A Nighthawk. Benjamin Robert Rich (June 18, 1925 – January 5, 1995)was the second director of Lockheed's Skunk Works from 1975 to 1991, succeeding its founder,Kelly Johnson. Regarded as the \"father of stealth,\" Ben Rich was responsible for leading thedevelopment of the F-117, the first production stealth aircraft. He also worked on the F-104,U-2, SR-71, A-12, and F-22 among others, many of which are still classified.‘July 21, 1986Dear John:Yes, I'm a believer in BOTH categories. I feel everything is possible. Many ofour manmade UFOs were unfunded opportunities.In both categories, there are a lot of geeks and charlatans. Be cautious.’So, the question is: what exactly did Ben Rich mean when he talked about ‘unfundedopportunities’? Was he speaking of classified programs within the Skunk Works that didnot get proper funding? Or, was he speaking of hand-me-downs that we received fromothers? ISN’T IT BEN RICH WHO SPOKE ONLY A FEW YEARS AGO AT A MEETING INCALIFORNIA AND SAID WE HAD THE TECHNOLOGY ‘TO TAKE E. T. HOME’?That’s exactly correct, Linda. I have that quote right here. Mr. Ben Rich passed away in1995 and before he passed away, he dropped a number of bombshells. This took place atWright-Patterson AFB back in 1993. He gave a slide presentation there and also at theUCLA School of Engineering Alumni speech – he gave on March 23, 1993. At the veryend of his presentation, in both of these venues, he completed his slides with the followingquote: ‘The U. S. Air Force has just given us a contract to take E. T. back home.’He also mentioned, ‘We also know how to travel to the stars.’ And he also mentioned atthe UCLA speech, ‘It is time to end all secrecy on this as it no longer poses a nationalsecurity threat and to make the technology available for use in the private sector.’ That’sexactly what we’re talking about here.He was telling us about a whole level of aircraft, of spacecraft, of advanced propulsionsystems that are so far advanced. He even mentioned technologies that are 50 yearsbeyond even what we could possibly dream of. Now, when you hear that coming from theDirector of the Skunk Works, I think it is important to really take that to heart. Thisgentleman knew something and he was trying to tell us something. And I think this is the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"space program that none of us have a clue about in the civilian sector. This is what BenRich was trying to tell us about.THAT THERE IS A SECOND, SECRET PARALLEL SPACE P ROGRAM TO NASA.Absolutely – 100%. DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER DETAILS TO FILL IN ABOUT WHO THEASTRONAUTS COULD BE AND WHAT MIGHT BE THE CURRENT MOST CUTTINGEDGE AERIAL CRAFT WE MIGHT HAVE IN SECRET?I do not know who the secret astronaut corps would be, but I do have at least an idea ofsome of the craft they might fly. I will reference an event that took place on November 12,1988 – this is two days after the F-117A was declassified and put into the public domain.This was an exhibit to garner support for black budget aerospace programs. We know thatCalifornia Congressman George Brown, Jr., was present. We also know that U. S. SenatorAlan Cranston was present and a number of high-level military brass was also present atthis classified exhibit. This was not open to the general public.Now, one aerospace engineer who did come forward and provide details – he was actuallyat this exhibit. He mentioned that there were a number of aircraft in this hangar. Therewere two semi-classified hovercraft that have now since gone into the commercialindustry. He also described a flattened football, diamond-shaped aircraft.Reference: Aviation Week & Space Technology December 24, 1990, has a very gooddrawing, a schematic of what this particular aircraft looked like. Roughly it was 100 feet inlength and approximately 65 feet wide – completely composed of heat-ablative thermo-resistance space shuttle tiles - the same tiles that you would see on the space shuttle.[ Editor's Note: Thermal Protection System (TPS) reinforced carbon-carbonthat can withstand up to 3,000 degrees F. on reentry into Earth’satmosphere.] On control surfaces along the leading and trailing edges of the aircraft; tricycle landinggear with wire mesh wheels; and this was a completely unmanned aircraft. This was one ofthe aircraft that was at the 1988 exhibit.This was an unmanned aerial vehicle that had 121 launch tubes at the lower portion of thefuselage. They had the capability of launching a 1/10th megaton warhead at less than1/10th of a second. There were 18 of these aircraft built during the Reagan Administration.THAT MEANS THE NUCLEAR MISSILES COULD BE LAUNCHED FROM HIGH INOUR ATMOSPHERE WITHOUT HAVING PILOTS INSIDE THOSE AIRPLANES?That’s exactly correct. They could be to the Soviet Union in less than three hours and thenbe back home and the Soviet Union would not even know what was going on becausethese things are extremely stealthy and could not be intercepted via missiles or aircraft.WHERE DO YOU THINK THESE AIRCRAFT ARE TODAY?No one knows, but I can only guess that some of them are at a remote facility at EglinAFB, Florida. They could also be at an underground facility called ‘Dyson’s Dock’ at theremote test site in Nevada, also known as ‘Area 51.’ And then also the third option isEdwards North Base, Mohave, California."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"IN YOUR PRESENTATION, I THOUGHT ONE OF THE FASCINATING BUTDISTURBING PART WAS A DRAWING FOR A PLANE OF A MILITARYAPPLICATION IN WHICH ELECTROSTATIC FIELDS WERE PLACED ON THEFRONT OF THE WINGS AND I THINK AND IN THE TAIL IN ORDER TO REDUCEDRAG.That’s correct. Now, this comes from March 9, 1992, Aviation Week & Space Technology.That is the reference for this and you will recall that twenty-one Northrup B-2 ATV stealthbombers have been built at the cost of $2.2 billion per aircraft. The Northrup engineerswho worked on the program were getting really disgusted that the technologies associatedwith the B-2 were not being trickled down into the commercial airline industry. That’s whythey came forward.Text and illustrations above and below by Michael Schratt."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"What the engineers said is that a number of technologies that are actually in use on the B-2were classified technologies. One of them referenced, ‘T. T. Brown [Townsend Brown] Electrogravitic Patent No. 3,187, 206, specifically talking about how the B-2 electricallycharges the leading edge of the wing to reduce the radar cross section. Then it negativelycharges the exhaust gases to reduce the infrared signature. They also found out that a 1968report from Northrup Grumman Corp. was that when you electrically charge the leadingedge of the wing, there is a resulting drag coefficient reduction up to 60%. That could beretrofitted to the commercial airline industry, but it’s not happening. And that’s why theengineers came forward.IF WE WERE ABLE TO REDUCE THE DRAG ON OUR AIRLINERS BY 60%, THATWOULD REDUCE THE FUEL DEMAND BY A LARGE AMOUNT.That’s exactly correct, yes. The implications are staggering and this has so manyapplications, but is not being used and that was the reason Northrup engineers cameforward. And I certainly hope some day we do see this technology.IN A DAY AND AGE RIGHT NOW WHERE WE ARE FIGHTING FOR EVERY DROPOF OIL AND JET FUEL THAT WE CAN GET, ISN’T THERE SOMETHINGCRIMINAL ABOUT THE SEPARATION AND SUPPRESSION OF ADVANCEDTECHNOLOGIES FROM CIVILIAN APPLICATIONS?I could not agree more, Linda. It’s our Constitutional obligation to question authority andthat’s what we are doing tonight. I think an accounting should be made of these programs.They should be brought out into the light. Many of these programs represent absolutely nothreat to the national security. That’s why I think they should be exposed.WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WOULD TAKE TO GET THIS OTHER SECRET OPENEDUP ?I think it would take a massive effort of engineers who have worked on the programwilling to come forward with the hardware to back it up. We just can’t have only lights inthe sky and we can’t just have testimonies and documents. It’s got to be a full frontalattack. We’ve got to have the actual hardware.You and I both know that the U. S. Air Force, the industrial-military complex privatizedsector, they have archives, buildings, storage facilities with gun camera footage, withdocumentation, black and white glossy old time photos officially stamped ‘USAFPhotographs’ that used to be at MacDill AFB, Florida, Armed Guard facility. Thesefacilities do exist. Some of the secrets are in those and it’s my goal to at least tap into some"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"of that.THE PHOTOS YOU ARE REFERENCING WOULD BE SUPPRESSEDGOVERNMENT PHOTOS OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS THAT ARE NOTFROM EARTH?Some of them that used to be classified programs that did have stability problems andthose photographs have never been seen, yes. But they were manmade craft.SO THEY ARE MANMADE CRAFT PERHAPS MIMICING SOMETHING THATWE’VE BEEN TRYING TO BACK-ENGINEER (OF AN ALIEN SOURCE)?That’s a very high possibility, yes, and that’s exactly what Ben Rich might have beenalluding to when he made that comment about ‘unfunded opportunities.’ WHEN YOU TAKE ALL OF THE RESEARCH THAT YOU HAVE DONE, WHAT WASYOUR OWN GREATEST SHOCK?My greatest shock – I would have to say there were two shocks. Shock # 1 came when Igot some details about the other aircraft at Norton AFB that looked like a flattenedfootball, plus a group of other aircraft - and we can’t even call them aircraft because theydon’t work on the principles of aerodynamic lift.Illustration based on eyewitness descriptions of Norton AFB, California,Alien Reproduction Vehicle (ARV) © by Mark McCandlish.These were three craft measuring 24, 60 and 130 feet in diameter. They looked like aclassic flying saucer, or almost like a Jell-o mold. There was an upper crew compartmentthat looked somewhat like a sphere with composite panels about a 35-degree angle fromthe centerline of the craft. The smallest craft had a crew of four that used off-the-shelfcomponents. Now, that was very much stressed – off-the-shelf components. This was acompletely manmade craft. An ejection system taken directly off the F4 Phantom wasused on this particular ‘Jell-o mold’ craft. There were six CCD cameras along thecircumference of the upper crew compartment and one on top for a total of seven (cameras). They could all be used in conjunction with each other and produce an artificialimage on the inside of the pilot’s visor via the Apache display system.Now, along the central column, we believe there was a nuclear containment device and anarticulated arm on the lower portion of the craft and a number of copper capacitor platesthat used the Biefeld-Brown effect."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - The Biefeld–Brown effect is an effect that wasdiscovered by Thomas Townsend Brown and Dr. Paul Alfred Biefeld. Theeffect is more widely referred to as electrohydrodynamics (EHD), orsometimes electro-fluid-dynamics, a counterpart to the well-known magneto-hydrodynamics. Extensive research was performed during the 1950s and1960s on the use of this electric propulsion effect during the publicized era ofgravity control propulsion research. During 1964, Major De Severskypublished his related work in U. S. Patent 3,130,945, and with the aim toforestall any possible misunderstanding about these devices, had termed theseflying machines \"ionocrafts.\" Similar modern flying devices are now calledEHD thrusters.]These craft were hovering off the floor and they were bobbing, just like you would see alarge tanker at port, just bobbing on their own waves.The U. S. military general who was giving the lecture at this exhibit stated that these craftcould do light speed, or better. So, I think that was one of my first shocks. Thatdemonstration coincided with a public Norton AFB Air Show, which was public. But theexhibit (of Jell-o mold craft) inside the big hangar was not public.Interestingly, at the Vegas Crash Retrieval Conference, I received a comment from a manwho said he was at Norton AFB at the time and he said that base just prior to the air showwent on lock down and they had dogs all over the place and armored personnel, militarypolice and it was very unprecedented.DO YOU THINK THE 'JELLO MOLD' LIFTING BODY WAS LITERALLYNON-HUMAN TECHNOLOGY AND NOT BACK-ENGINEERED?Well, the craft had two code names. It was called the ‘Alien Reproduction Vehicle (ARV)’and it was also called the ‘Fluxliner’ because it was based on high voltage electricity. Thegentleman that I spoke to stressed that this was off-the-shelf components. There wasnothing alien specifically about the components of the aircraft. However, it might havebeen based on something that was alien and hence the name, ‘Alien ReproductionVehicle.’They had a small VCR connected to a monitor showing this craft making hops, high speedhops – hopping and stopping and then moving and then making a hopping motion and theywere showing this thing in motion. There was nobody in the cockpit when they had theseon display. They were unmanned, but they did have the capability of being manned. So, the implications are that if you look at the reference works and the literature from thevintage 1950s talking about atomic-powered spacecraft and nuclear-powered aircraft, it’sclear that the nuclear energy for aircraft propulsion program in the 1950s, we were alreadyworking on ways to crack the gravity barrier. By 1960, I believe we had the first workingprototype. Now, that’s nine years before astronaut Neil Armstrong landed at TranquilityBase on the moon. That might be one reason why Neil Armstrong doesn’t talk aboutApollo 11 because he knows he was not the first man on the moon.WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT BEFORE ARMSTRONG LANDED ON THEMOON, THERE WERE EITHER NON-HUMAN CRAFT ALREADY UP THERE? OR ASECRET SPACE PROGRAM FLIGHT MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN TO THE MOONBEFORE THE OFFICIAL NASA SPACE PROGRAM?Yes, Linda, that is consistent with the literature. The literature in the aerospace industrystarting in 1955 was just full of references of atomic-powered spacecraft, nuclear engines,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"things that could be retrofitted to trans-atmospheric vehicles.By 1960, all of that was completely expunged from the literature 100%. So, it’s clear theymade a breakthrough somewhere around 1960 where they started with these prototypes.That’s why I believe that we already had a flying prototype at that time that couldprobably get to the moon.The implications of what that means to NASA while it is still using Nazi SS liquid rockettechnology that’s been obsolete for over 60 years is ridiculous!YOU MEAN THE SHUTTLES ARE BEING BLASTED UP INTO THE AIR IN ACRUDER TECHNOLOGY WHILE MORE SOPHISTICATED LIFTING BODIES AREAVAILABLE IN THE SECRET AMERICAN SPACE PROGRAM?Absolutely. The whole liquid rocket launch concept is flawed. There is a much better wayto access space, and THEY (powers-that-be-in-secret-programs) know it.MICHAEL, CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW ENRAGED THE NASA EMPLOYEES ANDADMINISTRATORS WHO DON’T KNOW ABOUT A SECRET SPACE PROGRAMWOULD BE IF THEY KNEW?Not only do they not know, but less than 5% of Congress knows and in many cases, ourpresidents don’t know either.THE PROBABILITY IS THAT THE IMPETUS OF THE SECRET AMERICAN SPACEPROGRAM WAS THE NON-HUMAN PRESENCE AND CRASH RETRIEVALS OFTHEIR DISC TECHNOLOGIES. I WONDER WHETHER THE SECRET SPACEPROGRAM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED IN ALLIANCE WITH THOSE NON-HUMANSOR IN SPITE OF THOSE NON-HUMANS?That’s a really good question. Certainly we have a number of craft that certainly seem tomimic what we would classify as extraterrestrial vehicles.HOW DO WE PROVE THIS?We’d have to speak to some of the engineers who worked directly on the program fromLockheed and also from SAIC (Science Applications International Corporation) in SanDiego, California. They are aware of these craft, too.HOW IRONIC IF IT IS GOING TO BE IF THE CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES OFGLOBAL WARMING AND THE DECLINE OF FOSSIL FUELS ARE WHAT FINALLYFORCE THE GOVERNMENT TO EXPLAIN WHAT THEY HAVE HIDDEN FORSIXTY YEARS.I think that is something they might not have considered when they started the secretspace program. They didn’t think about the environmental implications of keeping thisunder wraps. And now that we are so bogged down in so many environmental issues, wedesperately need this technology. It’s their decision whether they want to release theinformation or not, but it’s clear that the time has come for this to be brought out into theopen.”More Information:"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"or further reports about government cover-up of back-engineering non-human advancedtechnologies , please see my 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities in the EarthfilesShop.
