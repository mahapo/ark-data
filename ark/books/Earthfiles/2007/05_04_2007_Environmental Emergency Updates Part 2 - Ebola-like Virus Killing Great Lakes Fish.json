Return to Part 1May 14, 2007, Update: The deadly VHS virus (viral hemorrhagic septicemia) has nowalso been found in the Lake Winnebago chain of lakes - the first VHS infection confirmedin Wisconsin inland waters. The Wisconsin Dept. of Natural Resources confirmed on May12, 2007, that two freshwater drum fish, or sheepshead, from the Little Lake Butte desMorts tested positive for VHS and describes the situation as \"a major fish health crisis inWisconsin.\"May 4, 2007 Seattle, Washington - Another threat in the American landscape that somemicrobiologists are calling “potentially catastrophic” to fresh water fish is a deadlyEbola-like virus known as “viral hemorrhagic septicemia,” or VHS. Until 1988, VHS wasbelieved to infect only European fresh water fish, especially rainbow trout exported fromthe U. S. at the end of the 19th Century (known as “Egtved virus” in Europe.) Buteventually, the virus was confirmed in Asian waters and the Pacific.Then only two years ago in 2005, to the shock of aquatic specialists, millions of fish died inLake Ontario, Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair in the Great Lakes - bleeding from viralhemorrhagic septicemia. And more died in 2006. What happens in 2007 if the virusspreads into the Mississippi River and beyond?USDA Map of VHS-contaminated Great Lakes: \"Since Spring 2005, a number of die-offs have occurred in the Great Lakes area,including muskellunge, freshwater drum, round goby, yellow perch, smallmouth bass, bluegill, crappie,gizzard shad and other fish species. Some of these die-offs reportedly involved large numbers of fish (metrictons). VHS virus has been isolated and confirmed from these die-offs. VHS has also been detected insamples of walleye, white bass, and silver redhorses and shorthead redhorse suckers that were notpart of a die-off and were not symptomatic. It is not known how VHS virus was transferredto the Great Lakes , or how long it has been in the ecosystem; however,one possible scenario is that the virus may have mutated from a marine formand become newly pathogenic to naive freshwater fish species.\"One scientist who has been studying the lethal virus is Jim Winton, Ph.D. Microbiologistand Chief of Fish Health for the U. S. Geological Survey’s Western Fisheries ResearchCenter in Seattle. I asked him this week what the size of VHS die-offs have been in theGreat Lakes and what the disease symptoms are.Click for Earthfiles Podcast Interview:Jim Winton, Ph.D., Microbiologist and Chief, Fish Health, U. S. Geological Survey,Western Fisheries Research Center, Seattle, Washington: “We’re talking aboutthousands of metric tons of (dead fish) in some of the species. Some of these die-offs have"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"resulted in dead fish piling up on the beaches literally one to two feet deep. We never seeall the fish that die in an outbreak, even in fresh water. In the marine environment, wehardly see them at all. But if you see a thousand fish on the beach, there’s probably morethan ten times or maybe even fifty times that many out in the water some place. Symptoms of Viral Hemorrhagic SepticemiaBleeding around the eyes, bases of the fins, sides and head1.Pale gills2.Bulging eyes3.Distended (fluid-filled) belly corkscrew swimming behavior4.Darkened skin overall5.Bulging eyes and darkened skin of VHS-infected fish.Image courtesy NOAA.The symptoms of the virus – it attacks fairly quickly – are principally as the name implies:hemorrhages of the skin and necrosis, or destruction, of the internal tissues – mainly theblood-forming tissues of the kidney and spleen and to some extent the liver as well. So, thevirus destroys the organ function and tissue function of the fish. They die sometimes ofosmotic shock from the destruction of the skin, but more often due to failure of the kidneyor other organ systems.WOULD THE FIRST SYMPTOM WE WOULD SEE ON THIS FISH BE OUTRIGHTBLEEDING FROM THE HEAD OR THE BODY?Yes. You would see reddish areas of hemorrhage and lesions on the body of the fish. It’simportant to say that this virus has no affect on humans. Viral hemorrhagic septicemia onlyaffects cold and cool water fish.Fresh water fish from Lake Ontario in Great Lakesinfected by lethal viral hemorrhagic septicemia that causes bleedingthrough gills and skin and organ collapse. Image courtesy USGS.PROF. PAUL BOWSER AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY WAS QUOTED AS AYING:“WHAT’S SO DISTURBING IS THAT IT’S KILLLING FISH FROM SO MANYSPECIES AND WITH AMAZINGLY HIGH MORTALITY LEVELS.”Yes, he’s exactly right. We are surprised that this virus has such a broad host range. Wehave over 20 species of fish in Great Lakes that have produced virus isolates sent to ourlaboratory for confirmation or identification. Several species have died in very largenumbers and that’s somewhat surprising. In Europe, the virus caused high mortality, butonly in a few species. Paul Bowser has actually seen the degree of the mortality thatoccurs and they have been very impressed by it.THE FACT THAT THE GREAT LAKES DIE-OFFS ARE AFFECTING AT LEAST 20SPECIES, DOES THAT REINFORCE THE QUESTION ABOUT IS THERE A TOXIN"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"OR SOMETHING ELSE IN THE GREAT LAKES WATER THAT IS SUPPRESSINGTHE IMMUNE SYSTEMS OF ALL OF THESE SPECIES AND MAKING THEM MOREVULNERABLE TO THE VIRUS?We don’t think so. That might yet be proven correct, but we have no evidence that this isother than the introduction of a highly virulent mutation of the virus into a population thathas never seen it before. That was true of small pox with Native Americans. There was notoxin or other things, but people died at very high levels. Influenza in Inuits killed like100% of the population in some villages. Naive populations have no innate resistance tosome introduced pathogens and it does not take a toxin or anything else to make themmore susceptible. Summer 2007 - Could VHS Spread Geographically?RIGHT NOW WE ARE BEGIINNING MAY 2007. WHAT IS YOUR GREATEST FEARAS THE WATERS START WARMING UP THIS SUMMER?I think we have already seen the beginning of a couple of potential outbreaks. We’rewaiting for confirmation.But my greatest fear is that the virus will spread outside of the Great Lakes basin.My second greatest fear is that the virus will spread to the remainder of the Great Lakes.The virus is not currently known to be in Lake Michigan or Lake Superior.My third greatest fear is that it will continue to cause high levels of mortality for a fairlylong period of time.If the virus leaves the Great Lakes basin, spreads into aquaculture, it could have very higheconomic impacts. If it spreads into other parts of the country, it could have very highecological impacts because the species that are shown to be susceptible in the Great Lakesare widely distributed and they include things like Large Mouth and Small Mouth Bass,which might be present in almost every state in the country.WHAT IS THE WORST CASE BY THE FALL OF 2007?That the virus is found to have left the Great Lakes and is spreading down the MississippiRiver or into other parts of the country where in the wild populations it’s largelyuncontrollable. We have very few tools that we can use to actually manage disease in wildpopulations. We have good diagnostic tools and we have vaccines that can help if the viruswere to spread to aquaculture. But even so, it’s going to be an increasingly difficultmanagement and economic problem.I HAVE A NEWS ARTICLE FROM USA TODAY BY DENNIS CAUCHON AND HEWAS QUOTING YOU: “VHS is the most important and dangerous fish virus knownworldwide. Its discovery in our fresh water is disturbing and potentially catastrophic.”VHS is catastrophic certainly within the context of the Great Lakes ecosystem and thefishery resources. As a fish health problem, it is in fact catastrophic. Could Fish Species Be Wiped Out By VHS?IF THE IMPACT OF THE VIRUS IN 2007 IS IN THE CATASTROPHIC RANGE IN THECONTEXT OF THE FISH POPULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, DOES THATMEAN THAT WHOLE SPECIES COULD BE NEARLY WIPED OUT?No. No species is commonly wiped out by an introduced pathogen. The populations will bereduced. Eventually they might acquire some resistance, and might not recover to theirformer numbers. But they will not be wiped out.IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT THE NUMBER OF FISH DIE-OFFS WILL PROBABLYSTART INCREASING IN A VERY SIGNIFICANT WAY AS THE SUMMER COMES?I think die-offs will start increasing. We don’t know how significant because we don’tknow what percentage of the population has already seen this virus over the last two years.If a significant fraction of the existing fish in the Great Lakes have experienced this virusand have some increased resistance to it, the die-offs won’t be as large as they were lastyear. But my feeling is that there are still a very large number of susceptible fish in someparts of the Great Lakes. I think we’ll see the virus causing mortality in some of thosepopulations and it might be in new parts of the Lakes and it might be in new lakes and itmight even be in new species."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"IF IT GETS OUTSIDE THE GREAT LAKES, WOULD IT BE IN THE STATES AROUNDMICHIGAN? OR?It’s hard to know. The Great Lakes basin drains a fair number of states in the north centralportion, but there are connections and pathways outside the Great Lakes into theMississippi drainage.SO IF IT GETS INTO THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER, THEN IT SPREADS THROUGHOUTTHAT WHOLE MISSISSIPPI RIVER DRAINAGE ALL THE WAY DOWN TO NEWORLEANS, CORRECT?Potentially.THEN WHAT EXPONENTIALLY IS THE PROBLEM YOU ALL FACE IN TRYING TODEAL WITH IT?Obviously, it’s easier to contain a virus to a given watershed, even as large as the GreatLakes, than it would be to try to contain it if it starts spreading to significant portions ofthe United States. We’re very concerned about the virus spreading outside the GreatLakes, whether it’s into the Mississippi or across the Rocky Mountains. Should thathappen, then the problem will be magnified considerably.ARE WE TALKING THEN ABOUT MILLIONS OF FISH DIE-OFFS IN THEMISSISSIPPI DRAINAGE?It’s hard to put any kind of numbers to that. This is something with which we have verylittle past experience. This is almost certainly the largest example of a natural outbreak inmultiple fish species that any of us have ever experienced. So, we don’t have a lot to goon. I think we have a long way to go before we know how this is going to play out.” Urgent VHS Containment EffortThe U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, the Canadian government and states in the Great Lakesregion are now enacting emergency regulations to stop people from transporting potentially infected fish from infected Great Lakes regions to still-clean waters. As Dr.Winton said, if the lethal hemorrhagic virus spreads outside the Great Lakes into riversystems such as the Mississippi, it will be catastrophic for fresh water fish and their relatedecosystems in the United States.Continued in Part 2 - VHS Spreading into Lake MichiganMore Information:For further information about worldwide threats to earth life, please see reports below inthe Earthfiles Archive:• 05/04/2007 -- Environmental Emergency Updates: Part 1 - Spreading Honey Bee Disappearances - Nosemaceranae Not the Answer?• 03/17/2007 -- Honey Bee Disappearances Continue: Could Pesticides Play A Role?• 02/23/2007 -- Part 1: Earth Life Threats - Alarming Disappearance of Honey Bees• 02/23/2007 -- Scientists Hope \"Amphibian Arks\" Can Save Frogs and Toads• 02/02/2007 -- New U.
