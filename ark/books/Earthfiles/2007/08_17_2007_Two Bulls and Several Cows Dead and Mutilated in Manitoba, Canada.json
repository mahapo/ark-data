The teats on theirs was cut off in circles just like mine.”- Sheila Vigfusson, Manitoba RancherAugust 17, 2007 Komarno and Gimli, Manitoba, Canada - The modern era ofworldwide animal mutilations goes back to the 1960s. Canada had as many reports as theUnited States. For example, in August 1967, exactly forty years ago, on the SarceeReserve near Twin Bridges in Alberta, a dead horse was found where a witness claimed a“domed saucer craft” had been seen earlier that day.Then three months later in early November 1967, two horses were found dead nearLivingston, Ontario. One had a long, bloodless cut on its neck. The other had its throat andjugular vein cut off, yet there was no evidence of blood. That was November 6, 1967. Theday before, near Livingston, a resident reported seeing a large UFO.Since then, literally thousands of animals – including wild game and all kinds of domesticstock – have been found with a similar pattern of bloodless excisions: an ear is cut offclose to the scalp. On the same side of the head, an eye is often removed along with acircular excision of hide around the eye. Half the jaw flesh is cut out along with the entiretongue from deep within the throat. In almost all cases, genitals are excised in neat oval orcircular hide-deep patterns and often the rectum and/or vaginal tissue is cored out as well.All without blood or signs of struggle. 7 Cows, 2 Calves and 1 Bull Die Mysteriouslyin Komarno, ManitobaGimli, Manitoba, Canada (pink circle) is about 50 miles north of Winnipegand has a population of 6,000. A couple miles away, 125 residents live in thesmall farm town of Komarno, which means \"mosquito\" in Ukrainian.And now come more cattle mutilation reports in the province of Manitoba between July 8and August 9. Sheila Vigfusson has lived and farmed in Komarno the past twelve years.She runs a herd of 300 cattle, about half male and half female. Komarno is a very smallrural community only a couple of miles from Gimli, which has a population of about 6,000.Both towns are near Lake Winnipeg north of Winnipeg, Manitoba. And this summer, bothtowns are now on the animal mutilation map."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"On July 8, Sheila found five of her adult cows and two calves dead with odd, bloodlessexcisions of hide and circular excisions of teats from the udders. Her vet came out to gettissue samples to send to a Canadian lab testing for anthrax. That dreaded disease hadsuddenly appeared in Komarno and Gimli, much to the shock of farmers and ranchers whohad never had to deal with anthrax before.The next day, on July 9, Sheila found another dead cow. Then two days after that on July11, she found another cow and one of her bulls mutilated. None had any blood on oraround them. Most had the odd circular excisions of hide from their bloated bodies. Sheilawas very confused and troubled because anthrax causes animals to bleed.When she got the tissue test results back, none of her animals had tested positive foranthrax, but she still had a total of 10 dead animals, cause of death unknown, and an 11thmissing that never turned up. Sheila told me, \"Now I wish I had taken photographs, but Iwas so upset and so confused about what was happening that I didn't even want to look atmy dead animals.\"Sheila Vigfusson, Rancher, Komarno, Manitoba, Canada: “It’s just so weird to me.What gets me is that I have ten animals dead and I don’t know what they died from. AndI’ve never seen this (dead animals) with no blood. We’ve been farming a long time andhave quite a lot of cattle. I’ve had dead animals before, but I’ve never seen them like this,you know? And then Greg (Wotowich) lost his bull and just recently, Lois and Steve Matislost one of their cows. The teats on theirs was cut off in circles just like mine.\" A 2,700-Pound-Bull Is Mutilatedin Gimli, ManitobaTwo and a half weeks later on July 29, only a couple of miles down the road from Sheila'splace, Greg Woytowich was working on Sunday afternoon, July 29, around 3:30 PM. Gregis 42-years-old and has farmed in Gimli the past eleven years. One of his prize purchasestwo years ago was a 10-year-old pedigreed black Angus bull from Scotland. That bullweighed 2,700 pounds and was the best bull Greg had ever owned.That hot, sunny day, Greg and his brother were bailing hay. Greg had just started makinghis first found of the pasture when he was perplexed about what he was seeing sticking upfrom pasture grass about two hundred feet away.Greg Woytowich, Farmer and Mechanic for the Province of Manitoba NaturalResources Department, Gimli, Manitoba, Canada: “I made the corner with the tractorand bailer and I looked over to my right. I seen a leg sticking up out of the tall grass and araven flew up.So, I stopped the tractor and went over the fence and walked out approximately 60 yardsfrom the fence and there was my bull lying on the ground. His head was facing north andhis legs were facing east. I walked up to (his back) and figured, ‘Oh, crap!’ because we hadanthrax break out in the area. So I left (without looking at bull closely) and phoned theveterinarian to come out and take samples from him. And I was cheesed off! (laughs) But Ifigured there was no use standing around. The bull’s dead, so I got back in the tractor andcontinued to bail.It was about 90 minutes from the time I discovered the bull until the vet showed up thatSunday. Then, we returned back to where the bull was and now I noticed he was missinghis skin on his abdomen and his scrotum was cut out and I noticed his ear and tongue weregone."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Right ear cut off at its base and tongue removed. Right eye never examinedto see if intact or not. The depression in neck is where the veterinarian on Sunday,July 29, 2007, took a sample for anthrax lab tests which came back negative.Image © 2007 by Greg Woytowich.Bull's scrotum and penis were removed in large oval, hide-deep excision.The remaining internal penile tissue fell out onto the bull's left rear leg througha second hole in the bull's lower abdomen. Image © 2007 by Greg Woytowich.I said to the vet, ‘You know, this is kind of weird. What’s with this?’He looked and just said, ‘Oh, it’s just wildlife. Animals were getting at him.’ He took asample from the neck (depression on neck in top photo) as a tissue sample and that was it.I asked, ‘Can I bury him?’He said, ‘No, we have to send the test in, so he’s not going anywhere – just leave himthere.’I found that odd if it’s a suspicion of anthrax. There’s certain things you have to do withanthrax-infected animals. But that was it. I was cheesed off, my bull was dead, he took thesamples, I closed the gate and carried on.In the meantime, since it was a Sunday, I talked to another vet I have used and usuallydeal with. And he contacted me Monday morning and asked what had happened. I toldhim and said this Dr. Katreece (first vet on Sunday) had come out and taken samples.Now, this vet on Monday told me I should get in contact with Dr. Megan Bergman, incharge of the anthrax outbreak with Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFI).So I contacted her and she asked, ‘Have you covered him with a tarp?’ She said, ‘Do thatas soon as possible. Why cover with the tarp is because if it is anthrax, you basically cookthe anthrax (spores) under the tarp in the hot weather we were having and it kills thespores."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Greg Realizes Missing Tissue from BullWas Cut with Sharp InstrumentSo, I went back to the pasture on the afternoon of Monday (July 30, 2007), and I took atarp and I covered him. But as I pulled the tarp over, I started looking more closely and gota really good look at the front of him and thought, ‘There is something wrong here!’ So, Iphoned the vet back and said, ‘I was tarping him to cover him up and those are not wildlifewounds or whatever you want to call them.’ I’ve butchered my own animals for beef andI’ve been skinning steers since I was 8-years-old. There’s a way that hide is taken awayand you can tell it’s been skinned.So I was telling the vet this and basically he gave me a blast back. He said, ‘No one hastouched that animal. Wildlife did that and on and on and on.I said, ‘OK, fine!’ But I went to work – I work for Natural Resources for Province ofManitoba – and my district supervisor, he’s been a game warden for 30 years. And I wastelling him about this. And he said he had heard something not too long ago in Rivertonwhere a rancher lost a bull that was mutilated.So, Irwin says to me, ‘Come on. I’ll bring my camera and let’s go take a look.’So we went out to the bull and uncovered him and Irwin is looking and says, ‘Geez, youknow’ – he’s been all over the place and a game warden for 30 years. He said, ‘I’ve seencaribou, I’ve seen moose – I’ve seen everything eaten from wildlife. And there’s nobloody way in the world that that’s wildlife.’So he said, ‘If I were you, I would get hold of the RCMP.’ (Royal Canadian MountedPolice)So, I phoned the RCMP – this was a couple of days after – and they did not soundsurprised or shocked. They didn’t call me an idiot over the phone by no means. They werejust interested in the location of the animal. They wanted to go take pictures to comparethem with some other photos that they had.THAT WERE ALSO CURRENT NOW?Yeah. Or with what they have on file. I’m not sure. But they went out and when theypulled the tarp off, the bull was white and crawling with maggots and like typical cops,they just put the tarp back over him. But they requested that I give them copies of myphotographs. So, I went and did that. The bull was lying out there and the tests came backnegative.IT CAME BACK NEGATIVE FOR ANTHRAX?Right, the first tests were negative, but Dr. Bergman’s reason was the state of decay thatthe bull was in – that they could not get an accurate test. They had to send it to a betterlab. So she went and sent the samples to another lab.In the meantime, the authorities came out. I had the hole dug already and we treated it as apositive anthrax case. They never even took the tarp off of him. They just sprayedeverything down with disinfectant and I pushed him in the hole and buried him.Now, I had my photos and that’s when I went to show them to Sheila because I heard shehad lost a bunch of cows. She was actually just finishing burying some.She said, ‘I thought I was crazy. Some of mine were cut. One was missing a tongue, onewas missing an ear, and the teats were cut off.’ But she said, ‘I didn’t want to say nothingbecause everyone is going to say I’m looney, eh!’I said, ‘No. Look at my pictures. This isn’t wildlife. There’s no way in hell!’A week later she came and got my pictures and emailed them to you to get your opinion.IT’S A CLASSIC ANIMAL MUTILATION.\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Oval-shaped gouge penetrated about three inches into the \"armpit\" regionof the left front leg.

When we got looking closer, the ear was definitely cut. You could seethe mark where when you cut into the hide, the white part inside the hide, you could see itvery visibly.
