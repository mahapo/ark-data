C. Levengood's Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory Case No. KS-07-101about his analysis of the Sorghum bicolor plants in the Chandler, Arizona, randomlydowned formation first discovered on March 25, 2007, by Michael A. Polani. Return to April 12, 2007, Earthfiles about Chandler formation.May 1, 2007 Grass Lake, Michigan - After Chandler, Arizona, resident, Michael A.Polani, discovered the randomly downed pattern of Sorghum bicolor plants on March 25,2007, I asked him if he would be willing to sample the plants for biophysicist W. C.Levengood. Michael agreed and went to the formation field on April 12, 2007, to gatherboth downed and standing formation plants and normal controls far outside the formation.To Michael's great surprise, at least 95% of the young, lush green plants had been cut outand removed. It was definitely not time for harvest and Michael still has not been able toconfirm who owned the field, let alone why the premature removal of the plants. Butabout 5% of the randomly downed formation was left where he could collect samples fromboth flattened and standing sorghum. I provided Federal Express so that the plants wouldarrive at biophysicist Levengood's lab the next day, April 13, 2007.W. C.

He has examined crops and soil frommore than 300 crop formations since the early 1990s. His research has been published(105:615:624) in the distinguished international botany journal, Physiologia Plantarum.The fundamental biophysical and biochemical changes biophysicist Levengood hasdocumented have provoked him to develop a measurement method to measure therespiration activity in the plant cell mitochondria - often described as the eukaryotic cells'\"power plants\" because they convert NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.) NADHis an important coenzyme found in cells that carries electrons in the transfer of reductionpotential and is reduced to NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) used inanabolic reactions, such as fatty acid and nucleic acid synthesis, which require NADPH asa reducing agent.NADH and NADPH are converted into energy in the form of ATP (adenosine5'-triphosphate) during the process of oxidative phosphorylation. A typical eukaryotic cellcontains about 2,000 mitochondria.Electron micrograph of a mitochondrion showingits mitochondrial matrix and membranes. Image by Wikipedia.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - \"Mitochondria contain DNA that is independentof the DNA located in the cell nucleus. Some theories hypothesize thatmitochondrial DNA descended from free-living prokaryotes (unicellularbacteria and archaea).\"Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) is a multifunctional nucleotide that is mostimportant as a \"molecular currency\" of intracellular energy transfer. In thisrole ATP transports chemical energy within cells for metabolism. It isproduced as an energy source during the processes of photosynthesis andcellular respiration and consumed by many enzymes and a multitude ofcellular processes including biosynthetic reactions, motility and cell division.ATP is also incorporated into nucleic acids by polymerases in the processes ofDNA replication and transcription.\" ]Biophysicist Levengood found a way to measure the plant's respiration energy changes bymeasuring the Charged Density Plasmas (CDP).Plasma lamp colors result when electrons in excited states relaxto lower energy states after they have recombined with positivelyor negatively charged ions. The ionized gas emits light.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - An ion is an atom or group of atoms that has lostor gained one or more electrons producing any molecule that has a negativeor positive charge. An ion consisting of a single atom is called a monatomicion, and an ion consisting of multiple atoms is called a polyatomic ion. Largerions containing many atoms are called molecular ions.

The recombining of ions and electrons toform neutral atoms or molecules is called recombination. ]In biophysicist Levengood's CDP testing of the Chandler, Arizona, Sorghum bicolorformation plants, he found significant respiration change, compared to normal controlplants. He also found significant expansions of the growth nodes and even expulsioncavities caused by microwave energy heating up the node water to steam which burststhrough the plant tissue, creating a hole (expulsion cavity).I talked with him on April 25, 2007, about his conclusion that whatever happened toproduce the Sorghum bicolor formation in Chandler, the process of leaving clumps ofstanding crop and flattening other crop in waves and layers, produced the samebiophysical and biochemical changes biophysicist Levengood has documented in cropformations around the world, whether geometric or randomly downed. CDP Test of Chandler, Arizona, Sorghum FormationUpper half of Figure 1 shows the Charge Density Plasmas measured in microampsin the Sorghum bicolor leaf tissue of sampled Chandler, Arizona, formation plants.CDP graph © 2007 by W. C. Levengood.Interview:W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist and Owner, Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory,Grass Lake, Michigan: “The first thing is a determination of the energy in the leaves byputting very specific weight and quantity of the leaf in a system I have in the lab forlooking at the internal energy. That’s how Figure 1 was derived. I had never done thatbefore in sorghum, so I looked at it over a little longer time than I generally do.COULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN FOR THE GENERAL AUDIENCE WHAT ‘CDP’ENERGY IS TO YOU?CDP means ‘Charge Density Plasmas.’ These are microscopic plasmas. Now, a plasma is aliquid or a gas that is highly ionized and organizes itself into a very specific system with avery special kind of energy. And by using a system whereby we look at a freshspecific-sized sample of the tissue, we can tell its internal energy in the tissue of the plant.ALL LIVING PLANTS HAVE CHARGE DENSITY PLASMAS THAT CAN BEMEASURED?All living systems. We have them. They go on in us all the time. There is a multiplicity ofplasma types and they very closely interact with one another under a short circuit – anelectrical short circuit. There’s an imbalance of those, so they set up an electric current.So, that’s what I’m measuring because the amount and the specific configuration of themtell me a lot about what these plasmas are doing.COULD YOU EXPLAIN FOR A GENERAL AUDIENCE EXACTLY WHAT YOU AREMEASURING IN FIGURE 1?Yes, as you notice from the caption at the top, this is the CDP energy I was just talkingabout. And I measure it at very precise time periods of 10 minutes – 10-minute-intervals –"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"over a period of one to two hours. Since this (sorghum) was something entirely different, Iwent for the 80 minute to two-hour period.The points you see on there are the specific energy at that – since this is a living system it’schanging all the time. So, what this shows is the change in that (energy) with time. Thelower control leaf, you see a very precise change after about 20 minutes. There is a veryprecise increase in energy. From doing literally hundreds of these time interval tests overthe last year or so, I could tell that something was going on in the leaf from the formation.These curves in Figure 1 – these are called algorithms. They are mathematical relationshipsby which you can get a lot of information. So I have this algorithm that fits normal plantsand the normal animals and normal water. And if that (energy) doesn’t follow thealgorithm, it means there has been some damage to the plant, either internally orexternally.Well, in this (Chandler) case, I saw no external damage whatsoever. There was noapparent difference in looking at them between the leaves from the formation or the leavesfrom the control plants. But when I used this algorithm over the same time interval as thecontrol – I took it over that interval where it shows that rise at 20 minutes. Now the reasonit takes that long is because the plant has to adjust to the trauma of the leaf being excisedand so on. So, there is always an adjustment in these internal molecular mechanisms if youdo something to the plant: if you give it plant food, if you take all the leaves off it – itchanges these plasmas very drastically.OK, in the case of the control leaf, I got a curve that fit this algorithm with a 0.99correlation coefficient. Now, you don’t get much better than that! I almost invariably findthat with living tissue, with water, and plants or animals. I knew then that in the sorghumplants that everything was going in a very, very efficient manner to get that correlationcoefficient.I’M LOOKING AT THE GRAPH AND ON THE LEFT, THE MINUS 0.15 GOING UPTO 0, AND THEN 0 UP TO + .20, WHICH ARE MICROAMPS OF ELECTRICALENERGY THAT YOU ARE MEASURING. COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHY IT IS THATTHE NORMAL CONTROL SORGHUM BICOLOR THAT IS DEPICTED ON THEGRAPH IN THE BOTTOM HALF IS OPERATING AT LESS MICROAMPERAGETHAN THE FORMATION SORGHUM BICOLOR IN THE UPPER HALF OF FIGURE1?Yeah, this time of year in the CDP system I use, the normal plants have a minus CDP level.So that’s normal. What is abnormal, or unusual, is the leaf from the formation has not onlychanged that (charge) sign in the electrical output (to +), but it is very irregular. I ran thesame mathematical analysis from the .99 correlation on the control leaf. The sorghumformation leaf dropped to 0.40.Now, that tells me right away that there is something wrong here. Are the leaves damagedmechanically? No. There was absolutely no difference in appearance of the (formation)leaves from the controls. But internally, there has been damage (in formation plants).The upper curve does not drop toward the zero – that dashed line – nearly as fast as thecontrols and it shows fluctuations. That’s what gives the low correlation coefficientnumber. You notice it goes up and then it goes down and up and down.The reason for that is that the mitochondria, when they get damaged, they release freeradicals and it’s the hydroxyl radical, OH. And when that’s released, that is a damagingradical. So, that’s causing disruptions in the oxidants and antioxidants in the plants. And sothat’s what gives these fluctuations and these are all involved - particularly themitochondrial damage - in affecting the respiration of the plant. So, what you are seeinghere are variations in the respiration cycle of the plant in those peaks and valleys.Now, in the control leaf, you notice it drops down to the zero level – a dissipation effect –very, very smoothly. That’s why you get the .99 correlation coefficient. The usefulnesshere of this algorithm and looking at these curves, it tells you something about what’sgoing on in the respiration cycle of the plant. Basically, that’s why I use it. Levengood Hypothesis On EnergyCausing Crop FormationsIT’S YOUR HYPOTHESIS THAT A SPINNING PLASMA VORTEX COMING FROMSOMEWHERE HIGH UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE COMES DOWN, INTERACTS WITHTHE PLANTS, AND YOU HAVE FOUND THAT THERE IS AN IMPACT ON THERESPIRATION OF THE PLANTS IN THE FORMATIONS?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Yes, that’s correct.AND THIS IS WHY, JUST LIKE MEASURING THE GROWTH NODES, THAT BEINGABLE TO USE THE CDP TECHNIQUE AND MEASURE WHAT HAS HAPPENED TOTHE RESPIRATION IN THE PLANTS, IS A VALID BIOPHYSICAL TECHNIQUE TOANALYZE CROP FORMATIONS.One technique, yes. For this to be a really valid tool, which it was in this (Chandler,Arizona) case, the plant material has to get to me pretty quickly – like within 48 to 72hours.THAT’S WHY WE USED FED EX TO GET THE SORGHUM BICOLOR TO YOU.Yeah, that’s right. That’s the advantage. If it were just the stems and nodes of the plants,regular mail would be OK, but even there I like to get it as fresh as possible.

B and C = Reoriented growth nodes with discoloration and stretched tissue in Chandlerformation sorghum. D = Node expulsion cavity in Chandler formation sorghum.Photograph © 2007 by W. C. Levengood.“OK, Figure 1 showed that there is some internal damage in the leaves of the plants. So,the next question is: What is that damage? And that is the advantage of looking at the plantstem nodes. Left: A, control node, normal Sorghum bicolor node width.Right: B, expanded growth node and chlorophyll green neutralizedto beige color with horizontal tension cracks in sorghum formation plant.Photographs © 2007 by W. C. Levengood.If you look at Figure 2, you’ll notice the control node 'A.' The arrows are not too far apart."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"That’s the spread of a normal node.But in 'B,' you have not only a bent node, but you’ve got it stretched out. So, I take thesemeasurements of the node length between those arrows on the right hand side of Figure B.You also see a beige area there. Well, there is no indication of mechanical damage. So thishas to be damage – particularly because you see the green color very abruptly stops at theedge of that gray area. That means there has been something that has neutralized thechlorophyll within the cellular tissue of the plant. It’s not disease. I would recognize that.It’s not insects. It’s not any problem in the atmosphere. It’s internal and it has to be heating– the thing I saw in these (Chandler) nodes. And I examined quite a few of them.One thing about Figure B is the sorghum fibers are much tougher than wheat. And if youlook closely in that beige region, you’ll notice horizontal, thin, sharp lines in the gray area.Those are tension cracks.When the node expands, it’s like the surface of a balloon. All the rubber is stretched andput under a tension stress. And here, the tension stress was great enough to break thoseouter fibers.Figure C = Sorghum bicolor formati on grow th node expandedand tissue has been pulled apart by pressure of node water heated by energythat made formation. Photo © 2007 by W. C. Levengood.I say the outer fibers because now if we look at the central region of Figure C, we see thatthe outer fibers have been pulled apart. Here we have a little higher pressure probably,internal pressure. But if you look real closely in that center, oval region of Figure C, you’llsee some whitish lines going up inside vertically. Those are bigger fibers inside that havenot been broken.Figure D = Expanded growth node and expulsion cavity at center (red arrow).Photo (slightly blurred in extreme close-up) © 2007 by W. C. Levengood. The Figure D formation node has what we call an ‘expulsion cavity,’ where the cavity hasbeen broken right through most of the node and cytoplasmic material from the cells of the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"plant is expelled outward.The central red arrow points to a tiny hole, an ovoid hole, that shows it goes right down tothe central region of the node. That is typical of an expulsion cavity. I think instant steamforms that creates the expulsion pressure.SO THIS WOULD REINFORCE THE IDEA THAT THIS WATER IN THAT GROWTHNODE HAS BEEN HEATED UP SO RAPIDLY BY SOME MICROWAVE ENERGYTHAT IT LITERALLY BURSTS OUT OF THE GROWTH NODE, CREATING A HOLE.Exactly. That’s exactly what happened.DO YOU FIND THIS (EXPULSION CAVITIES) IN ANY NORMAL GROWINGPLANTS?I’ve looked at thousands and thousands of normal plants – controls from each of theformations – and I have never seen this in the normal plants.\"More Information:If viewers have more information about other crop formations in your area, please emailme at earthfiles@earthfiles.comFor further information about American and other crop formations, please see reportsbelow in the Earthfiles Archives and my book, Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles in theEarthfiles Shop:• 04/12/2007 -- First 2007 Crop Pattern in United States• 03/14/2007 -- Part 5: Mysterious Events At 2005 Tawsmead Copse \"Insectogram\" Crop Formation• 03/13/2007 -- Part 4: Mysterious Events At 2005 Tawsmead Copse \"Insectogram\" Crop Formation• 03/06/2007 -- Part 3: Mysterious Events At 2005 Tawsmead Copse \"Insectogram\" Crop Formation• 03/04/2007 -- Part 2: Mysterious Events At 2005 Tawsmead Copse \"Insectogram\" Crop Formation• 02/27/2007 -- Part 1: Mysterious Events At 2005 Tawsmead Copse \"Insectogram\" Crop Formation• 06/11/2006 -- Updated: Two Mysterious Circles in Wheat Baffle Kansas Farmer• 09/02/2005 -- Part 1: New York and Ohio Corn Circles \"Flattened 2 to 5 Feet Above Ground\"• 08/02/2005 -- Part 1: Anomalies Confirmed in Pennsylvania and Arizona Randomly Downed Crops• 07/23/2005 -- Mystery of Six Grass Circle Formations in North Carolina• 05/26/2005 -- Phoenix Barley Mystery: Apparently Irrigation and Wind• 05/09/2005 -- Mysterious Lights and 2003 Serpent Mound Soybean Formation• 04/20/2005 -- Outer Space Impact At Serpent Mound, Ohio, 256 Million Years Ago• 10/17/2004 -- American Crop Formations: 1880-2004• 09/22/2004 -- Miamisburg and Serpent Mound, Ohio Crop Formations: Geometries Compared• 09/17/2004 -- Updated: Part 1 - High Strangeness in Canadian Cattle Corn• 09/12/2004 -- Part 2 - High Strangeness in Canadian Cattle Corn• 09/10/2004 -- Update on Miamisburg, Ohio, Corn Pictogram - Balls of Light?• 09/05/2004 -- Part 2 - Hillsboro, Ohio Corn Plant Anomalies• 09/04/2004 -- Hillsboro, Ohio Corn Formation - High Strangeness in Soil and Plants• 09/02/2004 -- Updated Photos: Big, Impressive New Corn Formation in Miamisburg, Ohio• 08/09/2004 -- Pictograms in Poland• 07/25/2004 -- 2004 Canadian Crop Formations: Scorched Soybeans and \"Dirt\" Pattern in Barley• 07/24/2004 -- Part 3 - Crop Formations and Mysterious Lights in Wiltshire, England, July 2004• 07/06/2004 -- Mysteriously Downed Oat Plants in Eagle Grove, Iowa; Downed Corn in Hillsboro, Ohio• 04/08/2004 -- FBI Is Investigating Animal Deaths in Johnston County, North Carolina• 11/01/2003 -- Another Soybean Formation in Ohio• 10/10/2003 -- Updated - Ohio Hunter's \"Deer Camera\" Photographs Mysterious Glowing Disk• 10/05/2003 -- Part 3 - Paint Creek Island, Ohio Crop Formation Photographs• 10/03/2003 -- Part 2 - Military Interest in Serpent Mound and Seip Mound Formations?• 10/02/2003 -- Part 1 - Another Soybean Formation Near Seip Mound in Ohio• 09/12/2003 -- 2nd Ohio Soybean Crop Formation is Manmade.
