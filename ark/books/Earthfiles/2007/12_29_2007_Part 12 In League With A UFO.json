Out of print.Return to Part 1December 29, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Chapter 8, Meat Market, continued.ill Smith was never sure if an Alien was standing in one of the dark corners inthe room, just out of sight, waiting to come to the rescue if Bill or one of thecommittee members botched up a procedure. He had that strange feeling manytimes, especially when he was doing something that he knew was out of hisleague - yet succeeded as if he were a master at it."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Tim, who had volunteered to go through the out-of-body procedure, was askedto lie down on the surgical table next to the body that he picked from the fivethat were available. As the process began, Bill (who was doing the procedure)felt the sensation that time slowed down. At first he thought he was having apanic attack and was going to pass out. He had the sick feeling that one getswhen subjecting a friend or family member to mortal danger. Bill wasresponsible for initiating something that only he, out of the four present,“supposedly” knew how to perform.Then, in the blink of an eye and to his relief, Bill saw the same two Aliens thatbrought him back days earlier. The Aliens appeared seemingly from nowhere.The beings quickly immobilized all of Bill's colleagues and performed theprocedure on Tim. Bill was allowed to watch the whole thing, although he wasin a semi-conscious state. The event lasted two or three minutes and then theAliens disappeared as quickly as they came. Bill found himself standing in thesame place were he was before the Aliens played interference for him. He wasback to normal, composed and no signs of the stress he had moments earlier.His colleagues were not aware of what had happened, although the scientistswere impressed that the procedure was done so effortlessly and congratulatedBill on his miraculous abilities. Tim was in his new body and walking around theroom. He could not believe that it actually happened!Tim went to his old body and marveled at it. He “yelled” in disbelief as helooked at his old body and kept saying, “Is that what I REALLY look like?!”His excitement overwhelmed him and he passed out. No sooner than Tim wasrevived, he again worked himself up and fainted again. After the second time,the scientists decided to let Tim come out of it on his own, which he did afterfive minutes.During that time, Bill Smith asked his colleagues if they saw anything out of theordinary? Did they feel anything different? The scientists responded with anegative. All three of them remembered watching Bill as he performed with theprecision of a machine. The other men told Bill how impressed they were withthe level of expertise he achieved from working with the Aliens. The menexpressed admiration for Bill's know-how, but they also recognized that Bill'sabilities were gifts from the Aliens. “ They had to be,” the scientists told Bill. Hiscolleagues did not hide the fact that they, as well as others in the committee,were envious of Bill and still wanted to know why they were excluded fromcontact with the Aliens.Bill told his colleagues that he could not answer that question for them. Then hetold them that he was not the one who performed “like a machine” and thatwhatever the others had witnessed, it was not him, Bill Smith. The scientistsargued with Bill and swore that they saw with their own eyes that he and healone worked at the table, although they acknowledged that being inside theAlien ship could easily fool the human mind. Bill told his colleagues that whatthey had witnessed was a vision. Bill said he was not even at the table when theactual procedure took place and neither were the other scientists! The Alienshad paralyzed them and moved them out of the way as one would move chairsaway from a table in order to sweep under it. As a matter of fact, all three of theother scientists were put into one corner of the room facing away from thesurgical table altogether. The men looked like mannequins bunched in thecorner.Bill told them that he was allowed to watch, but the Aliens did not communicatewith him. The Aliens did the job, moved the committee members back to thespot they had occupied around the table and then left. Bill figured that theAliens let him watch so that he would know what really goes on when the goinggets tough. Though Bill was a super nice guy, his abilities combined with theprivileges that were given to him, made Bill feel a little superior to otherhumans. That's why the Aliens brought him down a few notches."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Tim told Bill and the others that he was able to read their minds. He knew whatthey had been talking about while he was unconscious, but thought he wasdreaming. They determined after some testing that extrasensory perception(ESP) was enhanced when the soul is detached from its body. Apparently, whenin a host body, the consciousness remained detached enough from the host bodythat their soul - or the essence of what the person's consciousness is - was freeto roam the “psychic air waves.”The success that Tim had and the knowledge that the Aliens were keeping aneye on them gave the other three scientists the courage to jump out of theirbodies and test the waters. The group experimented with four of the bodies.Since Bill was the only one with some knowledge of the procedure, he remainedin his own body. The committee members discovered that they could allcommunicate without talking to one another, except for Bill, who was in hisown body. It was as if the men had two-way radios in their heads, with no wayof turning them off. That was the drawback. Every thought they had wasavailable to the others.It took discipline and some time before the scientists were able to limit theirthoughts to constructive and meaningful dialogue. Distance posed no barriersfor them. They were able to communicate telepathically, regardless of the milesbetween them.Bill felt close to the Aliens, more so than did the others. He did not feel that theAliens are capable of doing anything bad to humans, even though the Aliensrevealed to Bill that all human bodies are under their ownership. “Whateverthat meant,” he did not see that as a threat to humans. The scientists wereconcerned about where the Aliens acquire the human bodiesthat they use when the Aliens mingle ‘incognito’ among the human population.Bill told the committee that it was probable that the Aliens either grew thebodies in one of their ships; or at worst, the Aliens did what the committee wasdoing and harvested humans who are dying.With the equipment that the Aliens possessed, they could keep anyone fromdying - so why didn't they? Bill had no answer. The Aliens told Bill that they didnot interfere with the soul, but the Aliens had equipment that allowed them toremove the soul and place it into another body. Could the Aliens also store thesoul outside of a human body - like in a container? If so, for what purpose? Arethe Aliens God's little helpers? Bill Smith could not answer those questions forhis colleagues. [ Editor's Note: The first week of March 1991, I received a brown,legal-sized envelope by Certified Mail postmarked February 28,1991, from Porterville, California. The envelope contained anaudiocassette, letter and drawings from a woman named LindaPorter then 45-years-old, having been born in 1946.The incidents and drawings from her life time of interaction withnon-humans is detailed in my book, Glimpses of Other Realities,Vol. II: High Strangeness - see Earthfiles Shop. One of Linda'sexperiences relates directly to Chapter 8 from In League With AUFO © 1997 by Lou Baldin.So, I want to share an excerpt from Pages 240 - 282 in my bookGlimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness © 1998 byLinda Moulton Howe. ]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Linda Porter: “I was shown at some time a room with very tall,clear tube-like containers or cylinders on a raised platform, whichseemed to be at the center of the room. Inside these tubes -standing upright, naked and appearing to be asleep - were humans,or at least they looked human to me. They looked like they were insome kind of suspended animation.“I don't think they were dead because their color was too good.They were floating in what appeared to be a purple gas. It was verythick and hard to see through, but it swirled around so much thatyou could see the people as it moved. I was never told anything, atleast that I remember. It was just like I was taken into the room,showed them, and then brought back out, and that was it. I don'tremember asking questions, and I don't remember the non-humanssaying anything.Linda Porter said she was taken by a “grey-skinned scientist” to a roomwhere three people were in tubes. She felt the people were alive, but in a state ofsuspended animation and that the man on far right in tubes was a younger clone shelater saw activated by a “soul transfer” from his older body that died nearby.Drawing by Linda Porter for Howe © 1991.“ There was a praying mantis being and light-filled room. Iremember the being slowly coming around the corner and facingme. He stood very still and simply waited, as if he knew howfrightening he appeared to me. Eventually he began to talk to me,although as yet, I do not have any memory of what was said. Heseemed to possess a great deal of dignity and gave the impressionof being quite old.“After he finished saying whatever he had to say, I turned aroundand he walked me to this room (filled with dense light). Thememory ends with me about to enter the room and the thought,‘Translated into the Light.’ Whatever that means, it has to do withwhat happened.”"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Linda Porter's drawing of praying mantis being and light-filled roomshe remembered from a 1963 abduction experience in Covina, California,when Linda was 17-years-old. She thought what happened in the light-filledroom was connected to her later \"soul transfer\" into a healthier cloneof her body. Drawing by Linda Porter for Howe © 1991.Later, Linda Porter remembered that the praying mantis creatureand the room of light were connected to the people in the tubes andsent me more sketches along with the following letter:Linda Porter: “ When I was twelve, I became deathly ill with ahigh fever and a badly infected throat. The fever was so high that Iknow, for at least one day, I was delirious. I have a memory offloating on the ceiling and looking down at ‘myself’in bed. I wasthat sick. My parents did not believe in doctors, so I was left torecover on my own - which I did - or at least thought that I did!\"I was taken abaord the craft that all of this occurred on. Eventhough it began with the praying mantis type, the alien who wasactually with me through all this was whitish, about five feet tall(maybe a little taller), and had huge eyes with black pupils.“I was taken into the ‘room of light’ and shown a man about46-years-old who was very close to death. He was lying in arectangular container.“I do not remember the mechanics of how this was done, but hissoul was then lifted up out of his dying body! It left the body in thearea of the solar plexus (abdomen). It was about two and one--halffeet long, five inches wide and was a breathtakingly beautiful, soft,iridescent yellow with a white, glowing inner core that radiated avery gentle heat. There was a pastel orange layer around theyellow.“The soul floated across the room to another body taken from one"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"of the tubes. The tube body looked like the man would haveappeared at about 25 years of age. The new body appeared empty.I don't know any other way to describe it - like an empty container.The 'old body' was now bluish in color and obviously dead.Linda Porter's depiction of dying man's bright “soul light” lifting out of his body,floating to younger cloned version of the man now in suspended animation outsidethe tube, descending through top of clone's head and settling into solar plexus.Drawing by Linda Porter for Howe © 1991.“The soul floated above the new body, which was standing uprightoutside the tube, unsuppported and slumping forward a little. Thesoul light then descended, entering the body at the top of the backof the head, moving all the way down to the area midway betweenthe shoulder blades. It then merged into the body totally and settledin front of the spinal column in the area of the solar plexus (densecluster of nerve cells and supporting tissue, located behind thestomach in the region of the celiac artery just below thediaphragm).“It then seemed to stretch itself out longer, a few inches up, a fewinches down. The younger body then took on an ‘occupied’ look, asif the person were merely asleep.“The rectangular tube container that held the ‘old’ vacant bodyfilled up with a liquid to preserve the tissues until it could bedissected. The non-humans wanted to find out how some kind ofpoison had entered that man's body, how it had progresssed throughthe bodily systems, and at what point the poison (contaminant) hadreached a level that the body could no longer deal with the poison.“After the dissection, I was told that the body would be discarded.The non-humans seemed very surprised that I was upset that thebody was just going to be tossed overboard! They told me it wasonly a container for the soul and of no other value.“The non-humans think our concept of funerals is barbarous. Tothem there is no difference between an empty beer can and anempty body.“I was told that the (resurrected) cloned man would be relocatedelsewhere (maybe Australia) and would continue on with his life.Part of the reason the non-humans take tissue samples fromabductees when they are quite young is to have this tissue in"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"reserve in case a new body becomes necessary later on. (Howe'semphasis.)“New bodies can be stored indefinitely. The containers in thesketch with the three people in the tubes are storage containers.There are 'activation' containers, which have a light in the top thatmust be on the person for (unknown) amount of hours before abody can be activated - if a body has been in storage. If newlymade, it does not need light. In the sketch with the three people inthe tubes, the body on the far right was the (younger) one given tothe man.“I got the impression the non-humans do not like to do this soultransfer very often. Actually, I got the feeling they're not supposedto be doing this at all.“But they seemed to be backed into a corner and have no otherrecourse. The non-humans seem to be trying to hide all this fromsome 'higher' form of life. Whatever the ‘authority’ is that prohibitsthis soul transfer also prohibits the non-humans from interfering onthis planet. (? Isn't there interference?) Whoever the authority, it ismuch higher evolved than the non-humans are and wields a greatdeal of power over many, many other realms of existence.” ontinued in Part 13 - More Alien ManipulationMore Information:or further reports about extraterrestrial biological entities and technologies, please see mybooks, An Alien Harvest and the 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities in the EarthfilesShop.
