S., or any worldly development,I can categorically deny this.\" - USAF Capt. Edward J. Ruppelt,Former Head of USAF Project Blue Book Return to Part 1February 7, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico -An official publication of Civilian Research, InterplanetaryFlying Objects (CRIFO) © 1957 by Leonard H. Stringfield.BALANCING THE EVIDENCELumping all the heterogeneous loose ends o the so-called evidence together, one logicallyasks, Where does it all fit? Look magazine, in an Air Force-approved article entitled \"HuntFor the Flying Saucer,\" printed in June 1952, said: \"Air Force officials feel the finalsolution to the flying saucer mystery will be found under one or more of the followingheadings: 1) misinterpretations of known objects 2) ... phenomena of nature or optics 3) ...man-made developments and 4) ... interplanetary spaceships or missiles.But in the same breath, the Air Force-approved article squashed item one, admitting \"eventhe most cautious Air Force authorities feel certain that many people are not describing thebehavior of any conventional form of aircraft, not even an aircraft on the mostexperimental drawing boards.\" Under item two, Captain Ruppelt, then head of ProjectBlue Book, was quoted as saying: \"If saucers turn out to be natural phenomena, we willdrop out and hand the problem over to scientists. But if they turn out to be 'hostilevehicles,' we will keep after them.\" (And for the record, the USAF is still chasing \"hostilevehicles.\") Under item three, the articles quote Ruppelt as saying, \"If these are man-made,whoever is making them is way ahead of us technologically.\" Item three also says,\"...although this is constantly denied, they might be a part of a secret U. S. developmentproject.\" Then it quotes an intelligence officer as saying: \"I'm quite sure there is no secretproject. There is more chance that they are from Mars...\" Under item four, the article"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"states, \"Air Force intelligence men say they are continually astounded by the number oftrained scientists who believe they are interplanetary in origin.\"The article ends with this statement by Ruppelt, \"...They have been around for five years(now ten years) and haven't struck yet. But that doesn't mean they are not a potentialthreat.\"Outside the Air Force, the best brains in saucer research generally agree that saucers are acontrolled machine. Beyond this accord, however, feelings run rampant. Two major campsexist, one who sees all the evidence as interplanetary; the other, as belonging down toearth.The best argument for earth-made saucers comes from the writings of James Moseley,Editor of Saucer News, formerly Nexus, and Dr. Leon Davidson, a frequent contributor tothis magazine. I first became acquainted with Moseley by letter, which was dated February23, 1954. An excerpt from his correspondence to me: \"My reason for writing you is that Iam in receipt of information that leads me to believe that you are quite interested in 'flyingsaucers,' as I am, and that you have a good deal of information on this subject.\"In answering Moseley, I asked how he learned of my name and my interest in saucers. Hisnext letter, written on \"Gran Hotel Bolivar\" stationery from Lima, Peru, replied: \"...I spentseveral days at the Press Desk at the Pentagon. During that time, I became quite friendlywith one of the lieutenants there. In the course of a general 'bull session' on saucers, hestarted reading questions off a sheet he had. I did not know at first what sort of documentit was, but eventually told me that it was a series of questions someone had sent in, and hegave me your name and address. He said that whoever sent those questions apparently hadmade quite a study of saucers and that I might be interested in corresponding with him.\"After several months of exchanging information by correspondence, Moseley visited myhome in July 1954, en route to Columbus, Ohio, where he said he was to check into a\"lead from a woman who worked with the Army there, and who says that a capturedsaucer went through her base on its way to Wright-Patterson.\" During our chat, Moseleytold me he felt 90% sure that saucers were interplanetary.Shortly after his visit, Moseley startled everyone in research by announcing in the October1954 issue of Nexus that he had come across \"irrefutable documented evidence\" thatsaucers were secret U. S. weapons. He also announced that this \"evidence\" would bedivulged in his next issue of Nexus. Knowing that he in the meantime made acquaintancewith Dr. Leon Davidson, I began to wonder what the two had discussed beyond whatDavidson had mentioned in his correspondence with me. But a letter from Moseley, datedNovember 5, 1954, provided at least a partial answer: \"If you have gotten Nexus No. 5 bynow, you already know that I can't come out with my 'irrefutable evidence' after all. It hadnothing to do with Davidson's information, however, although he is very logical andconvincing. ...As for the other material, I won't be able to use it. I have learned the hardway that the 'U. S. Weapon' theory is a dangerous one to deal with. As long as youcontinue to push Space, I think yo will be all right with your newsletter.\"Because of Moseley's big switch, many researchers have come to look upon him as a sortof jester in the business. While I cannot see Moseley as a jester, remembering some of hismore constructive work in exposing several flaws in the \"contact\" stories, otherresearchers have taken him to task.It was Moseley who opened the scabs from the sores of his earlier promises by publishing,minus his \"irrefutable evidence,\" certain high points of his theory in his June to July 1956issue of Saucer News. For convenience here, I quote from Lex Mebane's summary of theMoseley text, which he critically reviewed in CSI's June 1956 News-Letter, as follows:Lex Mebane, 1956: \"Unknown to the public, radioactive contamination ofthe earth's atmosphere has reached a very dangerous level because not onlybombs, but also secret non-bomb tests which 'got decidedly out of hand' havebeen contributing to it. However, there is not only secret contamination, butalso secret decontamination going on. This is done by what we know as flyingsaucers. The type of saucer involved is manufactured and flown from a super-secret underground base in the Southwest and is sent out all over the world tomop up atmospheric radiation.\"It is powered by an atomic engine, which converts atomic energy directly toelectricity (a secret discovery) and uses this electricity in some manner toproduce 'an entirely new and previously unknown type of propulsion.' There isa special branch of the government that carries out these operations; itsexistence is known to very few. Project Blue Book's investigators knewnothing of it and never discovered the truth. The radiation 'absorbed' by thesaucers is converted to electrical energy and released to the air, 'overloading itwith electricity,' which accounts for various abnormal weather conditions of"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"recent years. These 'mops' are remotely controlled. They are capable of thesilent, super-fast flight in the atmosphere so characteristic of flying saucers:they reduce air friction to a small fraction of the normal by simply ionizing theair in front of them. 'I have proof,' Moseley declares, 'but it is of such a naturethat I do not feel it advisable to identify it here.'\"Mebane then comments: \"...the story as it stands bears the marks of psuedo-science\" andin his review he lists seven valid reasons in support of his argument. Curious, and desiringan official view on the Moseley revelations, I wrote to the Atomic Energy Commission inJune 1956, but my letter was ignored.\"Others befriending Moseley for years began suspecting him as an Air Force agent. GrayBarker, in his May 1957 issue of the Saucerian Bulletin, called Moseley \"violentlyanti-saucer and evidently a believer in the almost ridiculous theory that saucers are madeby the government.\"In the same bulletin, Barker also aired an anonymous letter, which was sent originally toCosmic News, a discontinued saucerzine published in Strongsville, Ohio. The letter said inpart:\"...In my research, I learned that Mr. Moseley is in reality a reserve FirstLieutenant in the U. S. Air Force. From 1950 to 1953, he was working inIntelligence in connection with some highly secret work the CIA was doing inGermany. Since 1953, he has held the position of a liaison officer with AirTechnical Intelligence Center (ATIC), Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio,which as you must know has been connected with the Air Force'sinvestigation of the UFO problem. I first met Mr. Moseley here in Miamiin1955, at a private meeting of the Southern Aeronautical Association. Sincethen, I have had the opportunity to meet him three more times at aeronauticaland military conferences here in Miami and elsewhere.\"Due to my personal interest in the UFO problem, I have for several yearssubscribed to the various amateur UFO publications, such as yours. I can tellyou that it came as quite a shock to me when I first learned that Moseley waspublishing a UFO journal. The shock was all the greater when I saw his journaland learned the type of erroneous material he wa trying to mislead the publicwith. I can tell you with absolute certainty that should Moseley wish to do so,he would be in possibly the best position of anyone in the United States toexpose the true nature of the UFO mystery. The reason he does not do soshould be clear from all I have said so far. In short, Mr. Moseley is nothingmore or less than a paid tool of the U. S. Air Force.\"Timely and pertinent is an article in the August 1957 issue of UFO News-Letter edited byLee Munsick, entitled \"Unsensational, Not Confidential.\" It goes into detail on theMoseley-Barker feud. Says Munsick, \"Obviously the Cosmic News letter is bunk. ...Themilitary business about Moseley might be prompted by the fact that a relative was anofficer of fairly high rank in another service. As far as being a paid stooge for the AirForce, it's fairly well known that Mr. Moseley need not rely on the Pentagon for his dailymeals. The USAF informs us there is no Lieut. James W. Moseley. Neither of two AFJames Moseleys with other initials live anywhere near New Jersey.\"In the June-July issue of Saucer News, Moseley also denies the charge of being an AFagent, calling Cosmic News' anonymous letter a \"fantastic hoax.\" In this same issue,however, Moseley continues the \"U. S. Weapons\" hue and cry, publishing Part Two of\"The Air Force and the Saucers,\" in which Dr. Leon Davidson speculates on the\"Psychological Warfare Applications of Flying Saucers\" and the secret U. S. agency whoruns its operations. Said Davidson, \"The true solution, if saucers were indeed realinterplanetary spaceships, would certainly have been found in the past ten years of study.It can be taken for granted that if the Air Force had been in doubt of the true nature ofsaucers since 1949, it would unquestionably hav asked the National Academy of Scienceto conduct a full scientific study of the subject, using the nation's leading scientists andscientific organizations...\"Contrary to Davidson's contention that leading U. S. scientists have not been summoned tostudy UFOs, I was told on two occasions by Capt. Gregory of Section 4E4 of ATIC (asection which studies UFO phenomena) that in its employment were \"many leading U. S.scientists.\" He also said, \"If they can't find the answers, we go to scientists overseas forevaluations.\"For years, the Air Force, through its spokesman and in letters, has said that the UFOresearch section of ATIC was small or \"undermanned\" with hints that the Ruppelts,Hardins and Gregorys, who were reportedly in charge of its operation, were \"practicallyworking alone.\" But if Gregory's disclosures are true, scientists are as hard at work now as"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"they were when Colonel O'Mara told me in 1954 that the Air Force had \"over a thousandof the nation's leading scientists\" working on the UFO project. Major Keyhoe also told melong ago he believed that Ruppelt and Hardin, as in the case of Gregory at this writing,were sitting in front of a big operation.Assuming that Capt. Edward J. Ruppelt was in the know about \"inside\" ATIC affairsbefore he left Project Blue Book in 1953, his letter to me dated February 21, 1955, is thensignificant. It said in part, \"As for their (UFOs) being a U. S., or any worldly development,I can categorically deny this.\"[Editor's Note: The Report On Unidentified Flying Objects © 1956 byEdward J. Ruppelt, Former Head of the U.S. Air Force Project Blue Book.]Back flap: \"Here is the first serious, unbiased accountof the United States Air Force investigation of these mysterious objectsin the sky, written by the man who was head of Project Blue Book\"(from 1951 to 1953), © 1956 by Edward J. Ruppelt.Another letter of significance, dated February 16, 1955, from Capt. White of OPI, USAFDefense Department, said: \"...We have been experimenting with new type aircraft andmissiles for a long time. Possibly some of them have been reported as unidentified flyingobjects. However, the number of such sightings would be negligible. We have nothingwhich spins through the air like a disc, pulsates, glows, dematerializes, changes colors,goes from a mid-air standstill to a supersonic speed, or that can turn at square angles in fullflight, as some sighters report.\"According to the Davidson camp of theoreticians, White's letter is essentially true, but thecatch phrase in it is the word, \"We\" in the sentence which reads: \"We have nothing whichspins through the air like a disc, etc.\" This \"We,\" according to Davidsonian perspicacity,refers only to the Air Force and does not necessarily include a saucer development by theNavy. Davidson's argument in part appeared in the June-July issue of Saucer News:\"...In 1947, the production prototype of the Navy's circular prop-driven flyingwing, the Chance-Vought XF5U-1 'Flying Flapjack,' was just due for testflights at Muroc, California. (See Janes' All the World's Aircraft, 1947 and1948 editions.) This airplane is described in an N. A. C. A. report issued June7, 1949, Report RML9C29, where it is called a 'convertible-type airplane,'which was 'expected to assume attitudes approaching hovering and verticaldescent...' There is no public record that the test flight at Muroc were eitherheld or called off. However, LCDR Pickett Lumpkin, USN, informed me in1952, that 'it became apparent that the desired speed characteristics could beattained with less difficulty in a jet-powered aircraft,' and LCDR F. M. LloydUSN informed me in 1952 that 'the XF5U was officially dropped on March 12,1948.'\"All that can be fairly concluded from the above is that the U. S. Navy, about1947, was trying to get a flying wing aircraft which could hover as well as flyat high speeds. By coincidence, just at the time that the XF5U-1 wasscheduled for test flights at Muroc, there came the first (and I mean the veryfirst) flying saucer sightings which entered the Air Force files.\"In the Project Grudge report of August 1949, cases 1, 2, 3, and 4 are listedfor July 7 and 8, 1947, at Muroc and Rogers Dry Lake, California (now calledEdwards Air Force Base). These first reports were made by Air Forcepersonnel and refer to an oscillating object which flew slowly and had tacticsunlike an ordinary airplane. There were two fins on the upper surface (theXF5U had these also) which crossed at intervals, suggesting a slow oscillation."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Some observers at that time at Muroc reported seeing two discs at about 8,000feet altitude, maneuvering in tight circles with varying speeds and oscillating.\"So I wrote to the Navy for a statement. Their reply, dated July 24, 1957, and signed by P.G. Conwell, LCDR. USN, Technical Information Officer, follows:\"Since its organization in 1946, the Office of Naval Research has engaged inan extensive program of upper atmosphere research. Among the tools used toobtain information are plastic SKYHOOK balloons. Some reports ofunidentified flying objects have subsequently proved to be these SKYHOOKballoon floatings at high altitude. This might account for the rumors you haveheard that the Navy is developing a device similar to a 'flying saucer.'\"While the Navy (not very forcefully) scuttles its hypothetical \"flying saucer,\" calling sucha development \"rumors,\" the most significant letter in my collection which should erasethe United States weapon theory was received from General Saturnino G. Armenanzas, AirAttache of the Argentine government. Attached to this letter, dated May 9, 1955, weretwo pages in Spanish which describe a better-than-average UFO sighting over CordobaAirport in Argentina on November 25, 1954.Copy of Argenti ne letter sent to CRIFO, w hi ch suggests i nternati onal i nterestin the UFO puzzle. Attached to this letter was a report of a UFO seen over Cordoba Airport in 1954.For the U. S. Navy, or any other agency, to flaunt a secret weapon over Argentina,especially when relations with the Peron regime were already strained, would not be inaccord with U. S. policy. Just as inconceivable is the notion that a U. S. secret weaponwould be used to spy on Argentina. Here, logically, our first question would be, \"Spy onwhat?\" and \"What could an aerial weapon uncover in Argentina that any old-fashionedtwo-legged spy would not?\"But the best answer against such an adventure would be the risk of the saucer's powerfailure. Not only would the U. S. lose its biggest secret, but the ignominious dud wouldbring tremendous reverberations in foreign capitols. In short order, Argentina would havecalled the U. S. an aggressor - and they would have been justified.Perhaps a better argument against the U. S. weapons theory lies in the mildewed testimonyof the old sightings. As Major Keyhoe once pointed out, many are undoubtedly \"old wivestales,\" but others on record seem on face value to be just as credible as those reportedtoday. On the other hand, Dr. Donald Menzel has tried to lump them all into the wastebasket of optical or natural phenomena. But again, certain cases, which describelow-flying metallic objects, are not so lumpable.Perhaps the best reference to historical UFO data is in the works of Charles Fort. Butresearchers are constantly uncovering new \"old\" reports. I found one while taking a breakreading galley proofs of this book. My source was John Evelyn's Diary, Vol. I, page 43, in"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"which the author describes a UFO seen March 10, 1643. Better testimony, however, arethe firsthand reports dating back to the turn of the century to and including World War II.Typical of one of these is a report I received, which described a \"flying horseshoe\" seenover Newfoundland in 1922. Another was of a silver ball seen over the same area in 1943during wartime construction work. Still more interesting is an account sent by CharlesPaisley of Atlanta, Georgia. The place was West Point, Mississippi, and the time was\"early 1900s.\"\"As was customary for Mississippi summer months, the day was one of hotdrowsiness. Through a cloudless, haze-free sky, the early afternoon sun shonedown almost undisturbed by wind. My father, C. W. Paisley, Sr., then in hisearly teens, was alone in the back yard of his family's home, which wassituated on the outskirts of town. Walking toward the house, he noticed anunusual whirring noise in the easterly sky. Idly glancing up in that direction,he was astounded to see a small, darkish bob hurtling through the air with thewhirring sound that had attracted his attention. The unknown object shot bynot far overhead of my incredulous father at a speed rivaling that of a modernjet. It continued on in a perfectly straight and horizontal line of flight until lostfrom view in the indistinct green of a far distant clump of trees.\"The UFO - as it would undoubtedly be termed nowadays - had been in plainview over level countryside long enough for my father to note the followingdetails:\"Its color was uniform, the blackish-grey of slate; especially when at closeproximity. The object was clearly defined against the bright sky, presenting anunmistakable disc to the naked eye; the solidity of the object could not bedoubted.\"It did not occur to my father at the time to make any estimates as to apparentsize compared with known objects, speed, etc., so the following estimatesmade over 50 years later are understandably indefinite: the object's sizeapproximated a baseball held at arm's length; speed 200 to 300 mph; altitude1500 feet.\"My father admits that a sighting made so long ago can hardly be regarded asconclusive evidence for the UFO, but he stoutly maintains that he saw whathe saw and that the object was neither a plane, balloon nor opticalphenomenon. But he stops there. He is certain about what he did not see - andthat's all.\" My favorite was the \"flap of 1897,\" reported first by Readers Digest in 1952:\"In April 1897, U. S. newspapers from coast to coast gave front page space toa huge, cigar-shaped 'airship' cruising around Chicago. Late in March,dispatches from the West had described a cigar-shaped object, with no motivepower, 'certainly not steam,' first reported near Sacramento and then Denver.On March 29, according to the New York Herald, it was seen 'by a majority ofthe resident of Omaha. It was in the shape of a bright light, too big for aballoon.' The New York Sun stated that Kansas City trolley cars stopped 'andsoon the whole population was watching it from the street and rooftops. Thelight was as big as that produced by 20 stars.' Stories poured into the ChicagoTr ibune. 'Reputable citizens (of Eldora, Iowa) say they observed the giganticairship. One man said it resembled an immense bird of polished silver.' InMilwaukee, 'thousands of people saw it. The machine floated over the CityHall, where it stopped for a quarter of an hour.'\"In The Case for the UFO, professional astronomer M. K. Jessup has published someexcellent material he ferreted out of old astronomical records and notes which reveal\"strange objects\" in space. Another important discovery is a time-worn book from thelibrary of John Kiss of Cincinnati. Published in 1880, the book entitled The Great Eventsof Our Past Century, relates that during the meteor shower of 1833, the \"whole firmamentover all the United States, being for hours in fiery commotion.\" It also calls attention tosome \"remarkable\" meteors during that period and tells of one seen from Poland, Ohio, as\"a luminous body distinctly visible in the northeast for more than an hour ... very brilliantin the form of a pruning hook ... gradually settling toward the horizon.\"Another example was, \"At Niagara Falls, a large luminous body shaped like a square tablewas seen nearly in the zenith, remaining for some time almost stationary and emitting largestreams of light.\" Still another: \"At Charleston, S. C., a meteor of extraordinary size wasseen to course the heavens for a great length of time and then was heard to explode withthe noise of a cannon.\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"But for the readers who like drama with their old sightings, I quote from a letter by N. M.Cranmer of Hammersley Fork, Pennsylvania, appearing in the November 1955 issue ofBluebook magazine. \"...On July 6, 1940, a neighbor's hired man saw what looked like an'aluminum dishpan going up this narrow valley. He grabbed his pet goose and ran in thehouse and hid. They sent him to the insane asylum for treatment. Two miles farther up thevalley, another young man saw it and told his wife. She told him he was crazy, so he tookhis rifle and blew his head off.\"Continued in Part 12: Saucer Sancta - 801 and 4E4More Information:For further information about Leonard Stringfield's UFO Status Reports, please see reprintsbelow from the Earthfiles Archives:Status Reports I• 10/25/2005 -- Final Part 6: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 10/13/2005 -- Part 5: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 10/05/2005 -- Part 4: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 09/30/2005 -- Part 3: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 09/26/2005 -- Part 2: Retrievals of the Third Kind - Kingman, Arizona Crash• 09/25/2005 -- Part 1: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary CustodyStatus Reports II• 09/19/2005 -- Final Part 9: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/17/2005 -- Part 8: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/14/2005 -- Part 7: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/06/2005 -- Part 6: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 08/22/2005 -- Part 5: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 08/17/2005 -- Part 4: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/20/2005 -- Part 3: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/14/2005 -- Part 2: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/12/2005 -- Part 1: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New DataStatus Reports III• 07/05/2005 -- Final Part 15: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 06/20/2005 -- Part 14: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 06/17/2005 -- Part 13: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 05/10/2005 -- Part 12: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 05/04/2005 -- Part 11: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 04/19/2005 -- Part 10: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence © June 1982 byLeonard H.
