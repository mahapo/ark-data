Polani on March 25, 2007. Two yearsago in May 2005, other odd randomly downed patterns in barley were foundon the west side of Phoenix in the suburb of Tolleson. April 12, 2007 Chandler, Arizona - The first unusual downed crop in the 2007American season was discovered on March 25, 2007, by Michael A. Polani, a resident ofChandler, Arizona. It is very similar to the first American cases of randomly downed crop Iinvestigated fifteen years ago in the neighbor communities of Linfield and Limerick,Pennsylvania, where odd patterns were found in different fields on May 24, 1992.Wheat flattened with scalloped edges of standing crop extending 600 feetin Linfield, Pennsylvania, on May 24, 1992.

Somesections of the flattened crop were parted neatly like hair, with each side going in oppositedirections."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"One of several \"hairline parts\" found in the Linfield, Pennsylvania,wheat field.

But according to a Ursinus College scientist backin 1992 who collected plants for study, he found stems bending at angles from growthnodes as Biophysicist Levengood would also report over the following years from cropformations all over the world. \"Not wind damage,\" the scientists concluded.Then in May 2005, a farmer in the Phoenix, Arizona, suburb of Tolleson, found three ofhis barley fields affected by plants flattened in staight pathways about 600 feet long,parallel to the power lines and road edging his fields. Biophysicist Levengood's analysis ofthe Tolleson \"randomly downed\" barley confirmed the same biochemical and biophysicalchanges he had seen in more dramatic geometric crop formations.

May 25, 2005, aerialphotograph © 2005 by KTVK, Channel 3 News.Tolleson is west of Phoenix. Now, the latest unusual downed plants were discoveredsoutheast of Phoenix in the suburb of Chandler on March 25, 2007. Michael Polani tookmany good photographs, which were forwarded to Jeffrey Wilson, Director of theIndependent Crop Circle Research Association (ICCRA) in Ohio. When Jeff sent me anemail with the photographs, I immediately thought of the unusual Linfield and Limerick,Pennsylvania, and Tolleson, Arizona, fields. In all three, the standing crop has pulsing,wavy edges on long stretches of downed plants. In this new Chandler case, the farmer hasstill not been located and the exact identity of the crop is unknown. But it might be asorghum or Sudan grass grown as ground cover or low-grade animal feed.Whatever the crop is, the wavy, pulsing edges signify that something extraordinaryhappened that is not characteristic of normal wind damage. I talked with Jeff Wilson aboutthe anomalous features in this first American \"randomly downed\" crop formation of the2007 season."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Standing clumps and criss-crossing downed plants discovered on March 25, 2007,in Chandler, Arizona.

You're looking down a very long,extended, straight, flattened pathway. On either side of the flattened crop where thestanding crop is, you essentially have a regular indentation every two to three feet goinginto the standing stalks, which seem to be perpendicular to the general flow of the plantsthat are flattened in a straight line. We've seen this type of wave-like flattening in thestanding edge of the crop right adjacent to the flattened stuff in several randomly downtype of formations in the past.Above and below: red arrows point at the pulsing indentations, or waves, in the standing plantsalong the edge of the downed plants discovered on March 25, 2007, in Chandler,Arizona.

Acouple more recent ones: there was the Tolleson, Arizona, one that was in barley fromMay of 2005. And also Carmichael's, Green County, Pennsylvania, that was late June2005, where we had these straight lines in the crop, but also exhibiting this wave-likeeffect.The most recent one we saw last year on April 22, 2006, in Fairfax, Ohio, where there wasanother example of the wave-like pattern in the standing edge.WHICH I'VE ALWAYS REFERRED TO AS THE PULSING EDGE BECAUSE IT IS SOREGULAR. I ALSO ASSOCIATE THE PULSING, OR WAVE, EDGE WITH90-DEGREE ANGLED WOVEN SECTIONS ALSO IN THE SO-CALLED'RANDOMLY DOWNED' CROP FORMATIONS. THERE IS ALSO THISCROSS-WEAVE 90-DEGREE ANGLE OF THESE (CHANDLER, ARIZONA) PLANTSIN THE PART THAT IS FLATTENED.Yes, Michael Polani - in one of the photographs he took - shows very clearly the flatteningat 90-degree angles to each other and creating a three-layer weave, at least in one section.Three layers of 90-degree plant \"weaving\" in Chandler, Arizona,randomly downed formation discovered March 25, 2007. Image © 2007by Michael A. Polani; graphic overlay by Jeffrey Wilson, ICCRA.This 90-degree effect we've now seen in several cases, including the Fairfax, Ohio, fromlast year and the Carmichael's, Pennsylvania, one from 2005, in which there were small,rectangular square sections flattened first in one direction and then perpendicular to thatone there is another small square section and then another one and another one whichcreates what we call a 'checkerboard' effect being flattened in these long linear pathways.IS THERE ANY OF THIS THAT YOU THINK COULD FALL INTO AMETEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENON CATEGORY?That's a good question. We don't have any information about when this formation inChandler took place. We don't know if there was any weather involved or wind involved.But certainly, the effects left behind match up very well with other randomly downedformations that we've looked at in years past."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"IF IT'S NOT METEOROLOGICAL, WHAT COULD DO THESE PATTERNS WITHTHAT PULSING, WAVE EDGE, WITH THE 90-DEGREE WOVEN FLAT AREAS?Yes, that's still the big question! That's why we're still looking at crop circles. I will say thatthis particular location (Chandler, Arizona) has many of the same contextual featuressurrounding it that we find in a lot of other crop circle formation cases, both geometricaland non-geometrical - in the sense that it was adjacent to power lines. The closest powerline had a transformer box on it. It was the lowest section of the area. This area is very flat,but Michael Polani told me that this field, in particular, is about four feet lower than all theadjacent properties.Chandler, Arizona, randomly downed crop formation bounded by power linesand water-filled canals. Image © 2007 by Michael A. Polani.Why Phoenix?Now, this is in Arizona and you think it's very dry there and it is. One of the things we findis that crop circle formations are coming down very close to water. In this (Chandler) case,it turns out that the whole length of the field is bordered on two sides by one of the canalsthat is filled with water right now. That canal actually dates back to prehistoric times. Thatwas one of the ancient Hohokam canals that was built maybe 2,000 years ago. That kindof feature seems to be one of the things that we find - that these crop circle formations arecoming down near old, ancient archaeological sites. This (Chandler) seems to have all thesame contextual features surrounding it that all the other crop circles seem to have.The Hohokam produced refined bowls and jarsand already had engineering skills to create large canals for water transportto their crops when they reached the Southwest. Image courtesy Cave Creek Museum.[ Editor's Note: The term denotes the culture of the ancient agriculturalpopulations, which inhabited the Salt and Gila river valleys of SouthernArizona around 300 to 1200 A. D. The Hohokam are noted for their extensiveirrigation systems, with canals over 10 miles long that channeled water toagricultural fields in an otherwise arid and inhospitable environment. Manyarchitectural features of Hohokam settlements, including sunken ball-courtsand pyramidal mounds, are similar to structures found in central Mexico. TheHohokam maintained extensive trade connections with groups further south,leading to speculation that the Hohokam settlements were founded byMesoamerican migrants. Debate persists regarding the fate of the Hohokam -was it drought or some other environmental change which caused their"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"demise? The region was also inhabited by the Pima and Papago, but it is notclear if the Hohokam were ancestral to either group.See: E. W. Haury, The Hohokam © 1976.]Hohokam Indian Ancient Sites Near PhoenixNot only did the Hohokam people fill the enormous canal structures, which allowed themto become some of the first farmers in North America, but they also built very largepyramids that are called 'platform mounds' - flat top pyramids and large pueblo villages,many of which are found throughout the Phoenix area and an enormous concentration tothe northeast of Phoenix. The closest of these to the Chandler formation is not very faraway. It's called the Hokoman Pima National Monument. The U. S. National Park Servicedoes not allow people to go out there, but it is relatively close and they don't allow peopleto go out there in order to protect those archaeological sites.SO, IN THIS MODERN DAY OF 2007 WHEN WE DON'T THINK OF PHOENIX ASBEING A PLACE OF ANCIENT SITES, IT REALLY IS. I WAS GOING TO ASK YOUIF YOU HAD ANY SPECULATION ABOUT WHY THIS PHENOMENON IN ALL OFITS MYSTERY MIGHT CHOOSE THE PHOENIX, ARIZONA, REGION TO PUTDOWN EARLY PATTERNS IN THE UNITED STATES?We have a very long, extended growing season. Crop circles need to have crops to comedown in, so this is where there are crops right now in the United States. So, early on we seethings in Arizona and the most recent geometric pattern that's happened in North Americahappened in December 2006, in Mexico, two hundred miles to the south. So, we see cropcircles throughout the whole year across the North American continent. December 2006 Crop Circles in MexicoJeffrey Wilson at ICCRA reported on January 28, 2007: \"This geometric formation wasdiscovered about 14 miles east of Monterrey, Mexico in the village of Juárez in theMexican state of Nuevo León. The local channel 7, TV Azteca Norreste, had sent out theirhelicopter “Angel 7” to get some video footage of a traffic accident on December 22,2006. They were in-flight, returning, when the cameraman, Victor Hugo Lujan, spottedseveral circular marks in a pasture. While still airborne, they quickly transmitted andbroadcast live coverage of the crop circle formation to their TV audience.\"Local police were notified of the formation, and they cordoned off the site to protect itfrom visitors and to investigate – no further details have emerged from this policeinvestigation as of yet.\"The formation consists of four flattened circles and three flattened rings of various sizesand placement across the field (perhaps there may be more circles there, as the quality ofthe video capture from the TV broadcast isn’t particularly good), as well as at least onearea of RDF-type flattening.\"Three circles and three rings found on December 22, 2006, in the town of Juarez,Nuevo Leon, Mexico.

I don't think we really know the full extent ofany connection of that right now. However, there does appear to be this correlation verystrongly between where crop circles are being reported and finding these ancient sitesacross North America. The number we have in our ICCRA data base is somewherebetween 60% and 70% of the crop circles being reported are coming down in very closeproximity to these ancient archaeological sites.\" Global Warming and Crop Formations:Life is not guaranteed?By the late 1990s, researchers who had followed the mystery for several years werespeculating more about crop circle makers being from other dimensions, parallel universesand time travelers. But why would crop fields be the medium? And why so widespread inEngland, France, the Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy,Japan, Australia, Russia, Peru, Canada, Mexico, the United States and other countries?Biophysicist W. C. Levengood who has studied so many crop formation plants and soilshypothesizes that spinning plasma vortices are involved with crop circle creations. Butwhat unidentified trigger provokes the spinning plasmas? Could low energy plasmas withmicrowave frequencies produce the physical impacts on soil and plants and leave imagesof mysterious lights and spheres on videotapes and photographs? Are the mysterious lightsso often associated with crop formations an unidentified natural phenomenon? Or couldthey be plasmas supervised by an advanced intelligence which humans have yet toencounter. Could the mysterious lights and crop circles be connected to the same ancientintelligence which inspired other marks around the world in ziggurats, pyramids, moundsand stone circles?In addition to the mysteries about how the complex crop formations are created, there isalways the question of why? Do the often geometric patterns contain a mathematicallanguage? If so, has Something over the past two decades been trying to warn us that lifeon Earth is not guaranteed and that great changes are upon us in global warming, rising sealevels, expanding droughts, intensifying storms and hurricanes, threats to food productionand increasing extinctions in earth life which cannot adapt to the speed in whichecosystems are changing? Drowning polar bears are an example.Even the U. S. Supreme Court decided in the first week of April 2007, in a 5 to 4 vote, thatthe Environmental Protection Agency has an obligation to regulate greenhouse gases fromautomobiles and industries as global warming threatens the security of Earth life in thedecades to come.A few days later on April 6, 2007, the U. N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changeissued another report about the consequences of global warming in the Earth's future. Hereis a short and sobering list of some expected outcomes:- One-quarter of Africa's billion people will lose most of their water supplies"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"- Food production will fall by half in many countries- Sea level rise by a meter or more will force millions of coastal residents tomove inland, provoking unimaginable refugee and political crises.- North America will suffer more intense hurricanes, floods, droughts, heatwaves, and wildfires.Before the IPCC report was released April 6, scientists were complaining that the factsand computer projections would be watered down. One of the scientists who contributedto the report is Stephen Schneider, Professor of Biological Sciences and InterdisciplinaryEnvironmental Studies at Stanford University. Professor Schneider has been studying theEarth's climate since 1971. I asked him if he thought the IPCC report was watered down.Interview:Stephen Schneider, Ph.D., Prof. of Biological Sciences and InterdisciplinaryEnvironmental Studies, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California: \"There is always atypical propensity to find the components of an event that are lurid. And at the event Iwas at last week (IPCCC report meeting), there were components of the events that werelurid! You can find them. But the truth is that about 85% of the document really was atleast as good or – in some cases improved – by the interventions of the governments.We ran into trouble on two or three and I won’t deny that for fairly significant componentsof the report, that a few nations chose to refuse to cooperate on. I guess they thought itwas an iconic threat against their own interests and when you are in the U. N. system, it’sby consensus. Consensus means everybody. If two countries say, ‘No!’ The system isblocked.If the scientists say what they want to do is scientifically inaccurate, the system is blocked.Then you go into what we call ‘contact groups’ face-to-face and you resolve the language.Even the contact groups could not resolve the language. That’s very unusual. And therewere a couple of issues that got watered down. WHICH COUNTRIES GAVE THE BIGGEST RESISTANCE?One has done it every single time since the IPCC began and that's Saudi Arabia. Isanybody surprised? Why would they want to have a report that discusses the seriousnessof a problem created by the burning of their primary export product: oil? So, it's not asurprise.And they play the game very honestly. They say, 'This language is not acceptable to ourdelegation. They don't even pretend to use scientific arguments. They just refuse.China, on the other hand, which up to now has generally been occasionally suspicious, butby and large a pretty good player. But now, China just over and over and over blocked -but they used a different tact. That's what got many of the lead authors angry. The Chinesesaid their own experts found what a particular lead author said was not scientificallyaccurate. They produced no such experts. They did not give the nature of the details. Theyjust asserted it and when challenged, they stiffened their back and said, 'We're not going tovote for it.'That lead to a pretty angry outburst because scientists are not the type to be told bysomebody whose power comes from being a government person, 'You're wrong and you'rewrong scientifically, but I won't tell you how and I have the power to block you.So a lot of people were pretty angry about that. Now, they didn't do this in everyparagraph, or we would not have had a report. They only did it four or five times, but theycertainly picked important items and it was very difficult to get a compromise from eitherthe Chinese or the Saudis.Once or twice, the United States did it. I was not very happy about that, but 80 times theU. S. was cooperative. Three or four times, I thought they were really making kind ofridiculous - in one case legalistic and in another inappropriate ways - which slightly"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"weakened the IPCC report. But the U. S. was a very minor offender and on balance, theywere much more positive than negative. That surprised me, considering the history of theBush administration dealing with the blockade of their own government scientists fromtalking to the media. You know, government scientists in climate change (research) havebeen forced to have all their media questions bounced over to the public relations people.That's been going on for years and finally, this 2007 Congress being of the other party ishaving hearing after hearing and smashing them (Bush administration) on this behavior.So, at this IPCC meeting, we had kind of expected that. But I was very pleasantlysurprised that the U. S. was an overall positive force at the meeting, although once ortwice, were not.WHAT WERE THE STICKING POINTS SPECIFICALLY FOR CHINA AND THEUNITED STATE S?The U. S. removed some language in a table about the long-term commitment to sea levelrise if we start melting the Greenland ice sheet on the grounds that it was too speculative.Now, it is speculative (about how much Greenland ice will melt over what time period).But it was labeled as speculative. And the probability that your house or mine will burndown is about 1%, yet everyone of us has fire insurance.We're talking about the planetary life support system of the planet with a probability ofmore than 1% of a potential de-glaciation of major ice sheets and a thousand yearcommitment to ten or more feet of sea level rise. That's not a trivial issue! Just because it'sspeculative does not mean it should have been removed. It was removed because it wasdramatic and the United States did not want a dramatic statement in there. We disagreewith the U. S. on that, but of course if the U. S. had supported it, it would have beenblocked by the Chinese and Saudis anyway.There was another even more important item where in this table I'm talking about - the onewhich had listed as a function of how warm it is. So we had 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 degrees Celsiuswarming (about 3 to 10.5 degrees Fahrenheit). Of course, nobody knows how much it willbe warming because we would have to know how many people will be in the world, whatstandards of living they will demand and what technologies we use. And those are socialassumptions about how the world will be organized. Plus, there were other uncertaintieshaving to do with the climate itself.So, what we wanted to do to try to give people a guide is underneath each of theseheadings of how much warming there might be, was a block of text, words like:- Up to 10% of species threatened.- 10% to 14% of species threatened with extinction.And as you get warmer, of course, it gets more intense:- Greater than 40% of species are at extreme risk of extinction if you goabove 4 degrees Celsius warming.So, that's how the table is constructed:- Up to 1 to 2 degrees C., crop yields improve in higher latitudes because oflonger growing seasons.- After 3 degrees C., crop yields decrease everywhere and even at 1 to 2degrees C., crop yields are already declining in the hot and poor countries.All of those factors were there and what we wanted to do was show the world how muchdoes it take to warm up 1 to 3 degrees C. So we put above the table a time line for 2020,2050 and 2080 with a wide range of warming associated with greenhouse gas emissionsfrom very high to very low. That way people would see that if we had policy to eliminatesome of the emissions, it would make a difference in lowering risks. And the U. S. wasvery supportive of leaving that in and we were very proud of them for that. So, on thereally big issue, they were on the right side.But the Chinese and the Saudis were their usual blocking selves on that one and we couldnot get it in the report.I CANNOT HELP THINKING THAT MT. KILIMANJARO WILL PROBABLY NOTHAVE ANY SNOW AND ICE BY 2009 OR 2010. THAT MEANS THAT A MOUNTAININ WHICH THE GLACIERS HAS HELPED FEED THE WATER FOR THE MILLIONSOF PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE - THAT JUST IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS IN ONEPART OF AFRICA, WE'RE GOING TO BE FACING WATER SHORTAGES ALREADYBECAUSE OF GLOBAL WARMING."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Mt.

That's why I said weshould have started 25 years ago (trying to reduce greenhouse emissions).Another favorite metaphor is that you're in a school bus - because it's the kids now andinto the future that's going to get the worst of this - and it's going down a steep hill withpretty iffy brakes. When they start getting hot, they stop working. What do they say? 'Sofar, so good.'IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE ALREADY HAVE PASSED THE POINT OF NO RETURNAS THE EARTH BECOMES WARMER AND WARMER AND THERE IS NOTHINGTHAT HUMANS CAN DO?No, I don't think that's the case. I have never been a catastrophist in that regard. Earth isnot going to become Venus from anything that humans are going to do. We're just going tomake it pretty miserable for us and other species, but very differentially around the world.Don't be a poor person in a hot country. Don't live in hurricane alley.Some world areas won't be severely harmed for many decades. Others are being harmedalready. So, it's a patchwork quilt that is very uneven. As a result of that, not everybodysuffers equally. Then you have a hard time getting the political accommodation andcooperation that we need because a lot of people perceive themselves as not particularlyvulnerable. So, why should they give up their SUV?\"If viewers have more information about other crop formations in your area, please emailme at earthfiles@earthfiles.com.
