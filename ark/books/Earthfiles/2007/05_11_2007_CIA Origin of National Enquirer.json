Terryis author of an important 2000 book entitled The Missing Times – News Media Complicityin the UFO Cover-Up.Terry described his research of World War II when America’s Office of Strategic Services(OSS) – the precursor to the CIA – appealed to major news media, in the interest ofnational security, to help with censorship and propaganda during the war.By September 1947, right after World War II and only a couple of months after the allegedcrash of a UFO disc between Corona and Roswell, New Mexico, the Central IntelligenceAgency was formed. Over the next decades, the CIA used the WWII relationships withCBS, The New York Times, Associated Press, United Press International and other majorUnited States media to maintain its control over sensitive subjects – including the UFOphenomenon – by keeping CIA control over certain well-placed executives in newsagencies.Facts about the CIA's propaganda and censorship relationship with certain Americanmedia executives came to light three years after the 1972 Nixon Administration Watergatebreak-in scandal. The 1975 hearing of the United States Senate Select Committee to StudyGovernmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities was chaired by U. S.Senator Frank Church, Democrat from Idaho.U.

Over the years, the CBSnetwork provided cover for CIA employees, including at least one well-known foreigncorrespondent and several stringers; it supplied out takes of news film to the CIA;established a formal channel of communication between the Washington bureau chief andthe Agency; gave the Agency access to the CBS news film library; and allowed reports byCBS correspondents to the Washington and New York newsrooms to be routinelymonitored by the CIA.\"One of the highly controlled subjects for decades has been the UFO phenomenon.

She talked about Major Keyhoe and what he said about the astonishing aerial discmaneuvers. Later, Terry wanted to know why UFO events always seemed to be coveredup or dismissed as balloons, swamp gas or Venus by the media.During his research for The Missing Times, he read the Church Committee's reports aboutdirect CIA control of major media, including The New York Times and CBS.

S., Biology; M. A., Journalism; author The Missing Times -News Media Complicity in the UFO Cover-Up (© 2000): “When the CIA was involvedin Guatemala in the 1950s, I think 1954, the CIA was anxious for the American public tobe kept ignorant of that fact. The New York Times had a reporter down there who wascovering the story and the CIA – in order to make sure the American public did not findout what was gong on – simply contacted the publisher of The New York Times andrequested that he pull the reporter off the story. So, the CIA effectively killed the storyright there before the public could find out about it.Another example that just came out fairly recently – in fact, it was written up in The NewYo r k Ti m e s in March 2001 – had to do with the bay of Pigs invasion in (April) 1961. Atthat time, the CIA had a relationship with the Associated Press and the UPI wire servicesso that the CIA could actually place propaganda stories directly onto the internationalwires through those agencies. In other words, the CIA could literally write propagandastories and have the cooperation of those wire services to distribute stories worldwide."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The New York Times, Saturday, March 24, 2001.It’s was very well documented in 1975 by the U. S. Sen. Frank Church Committee that TheNew York Times, CBS and most of the major broadcast networks had a covert relationshipwith the intelligence community and carried out all sorts of assignments, includingproviding cover for intelligence agents to censor the news to distributing propaganda. Thiswas all widely exposed and written up in the Columbia Journalism Review and then insome popular publications such as Rolling Stone. Eventually, The New York Times, after ithad been exposed, did a series of articles in which they confessed that they had done this.The news media up through the mid-1960s and mid-1970s was doing this kind of thingbehind the scenes.THE JUSTIFICATION WAS ALWAYS IN THE INTEREST OF NATIONAL SECURITY?That’s correct. Former CIA Psychological WarfareAgent Creates National EnquirerCOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF THE CIA LINK TO THECREATION OF THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER?OK, that’s a very interesting story because it does actually begin in WWII. There was awell-known Italian newspaper on the East Coast called Il Progresso. It was owned by afamily, the Pope family. Gene Pope, Sr., who started the newspaper, was a very influentialEast Coast power broker and he was really supportive of Mussolini during WWII. That gotthe attention of the U. S. intelligence community - the O.S.S. at the time (Office ofStrategic Services). The intel people decided to infiltrate his newspaper to find out whyPope Sr. was supporting Mussolini.I think it turned out that Pope just wanted a better relationship between Italy and the U. S.more than being a backer of Mussolini. At any rate, this was the first time that Il Progressocame to the attention of the intelligence community.Possibly as a consequence of intel monitoring the Gene Pope family, intel agents becameaware of the son, Gene Pope, Jr. He was a bright, young man. He graduated from M. I. T.at age 19 in engineering. That gives you an indication of how smart he must have been.Around 1950, there was an internal family struggle over control of Il Progresso and forsome reason, Gene Pope, Jr., lost out in that struggle and was forced to go elsewhere,separate himself from the paper. He found a job in of all places, the CIA’s PsychologicalWarfare Unit. That was 1951 when he started working for the CIA.About 1952, Gene Pope, Jr., leaves the CIA. He’s about 25-years-old and he purchases anewspaper called the New York Enquirer, which was part of the Hearst newspaper empire,for about $75,000. Pope described it as an interest-free loan with $20,000 as a down"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"payment.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - \"The first New York Enquirer was founded in1826 by Mordecai Noah. According to the masthead, it was 'published everyTuesday and Friday at No. 1 Williams St., New York, New York.' Noah was astrong supporter of Andrew Jackson and published often highly slantedpro-Jackson news reporting, along with international news. By the early-1830sit had merged with a Whig paper to become the Morning Courier & New YorkEnquirer. By 1926, a second New York Enquirer was later sold and renamedThe National Enquirer in 1954 and was converted to a tabloid format.\"American Media Inc (AMI), one-time owner of the National Enquirer,further explains its publishing history. \"The New York Enquirer was acquiredby the zany Generoso (Gene) Pope, Jr. (1927-88) in 1952 for $75,000. Pope'sfather (1891-1950) was a political powerbroker and quarry magnate whoseItalian-American newspaper interests included the Correire d'America anddaily Il Progresso Italo-Americano. He had also acquired New York radiostation WHOM from Gardner Cowles in 1946.\"The Enquirer purchase was supposedly assisted with a loan from crimefigure Frank Costello. An FBI report on Pope Jr. drily notes that he was diningwith Costello at the Monsignore Restaurant when the latter was shot to death.In 1954, Pope revamped the format from a broadsheet to a tabloid, renamingit the National Enquirer.\"Pope ramped up circulation in competition with exploitationist publisherssuch as Bernarr MacFadden, a character almost as strange as Pope. He movedthe Enquirer to Florida in 1971, moving away from unashamed gore to'exposes' as part of a shift from newsstand to supermarket distribution. Pope,Jr., died in 1988.\"]WAS GENE POPE, JR., ALSO WORKING FOR THE CIA AT THE SAME TIME?We don’t know that for sure. Officially, he left the CIA, but there is some reasons tobelieve he maintained contact with them. He has a mysterious background. From whatI’ve read, those who have tried to find government documents on Pope, Jr., have beenblocked for national security reasons. So, his true relationship with the government has notbeen fully revealed at this time.At any rate, he somehow managed to come up with the money quickly to buy the HearstNew York Enquirer. Then he later re-named it the National Enquirer, which is well-knownto many people now.The paper he bought was actually in bad financial shape and it required a constant infusionof money to keep it afloat. I think the total funds needed to keep the paper profitable wasabout a quarter million dollars. Now, that might not sound like a lot in today’s dollars, butif you adjust it for inflation, that’s about $1.6 million in 2003 dollars. So, it was a big chunkof change for a 25-year-old kid to come up. It raises a question then about where he gotthe money? There’s been a lot of speculation about that.THE IMPLICATION IS THAT HE MIGHT NEVER HAVE OFFICIALLY LEFT THECIA, THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BUYING THE NEWSPAPER AS ANASSIGNMENT AND THE CIA IS WHERE THE MONEY CAME FROM?It’s certainly a possibility because you have to ask the question: how did someone thatyoung come up with such a large amount of money? We know for a fact in the early 1950sthat the CIA was spending very lavishly on a broad range of media assets, as the CIA callsthem. It would have been very natural for someone who just came out of the CIAPsychological Warfare Division to appeal to the CIA for funding, or at least be qualified toobtain funding for some type of propaganda operation such as a National Enquirertabloid.Some people say the money came from his god father who was mobster, Frank Costello.Frank Costello was also connected with the OSS during WWII when he did a lot of thingsfor the intelligence community. Any way you look at it, there are these ties between theNational Enquirer and the intelligence community.AND THE MAFIA!Yeah, the mafia, too. But, of course, the mafia and intelligence community workedtogether for many years as well. So, they are all one big family!Another connection to the intelligence community is that one of the first employees of theNational Enquirer was a man by the name of Bill Bates. He was a former OSS officer, so"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"you find these consistent ties between the intelligence community and the NationalEnquirer from a very early point in the paper’s founding.IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT PERIOD OF HISTORY, THECIA WAS TRYING TO \"WIRE\" MEDIA INSIDERS SO THE INTELLIGENCEAGENCY HAD INFLUENCE AND CONTROL ON ALL THE MAJOR MEDIA?Yes, there is no doubt about that. One person told me some might think it’s a stretch thatthey funded the newspaper, but it was a fairly common practice for the CIA. Wheneconomist John Kenneth Galbraith went to India as ambassador under John Kennedy, hefound a newspaper very much like the National Enquirer in India that he later discoveredwas financed by the CIA. So, this kind of psychological warfare trick was something theCIA was doing in other parts of the world. That provides some circumstantial support forthe theory that the National Enquirer may very well have been a CIA operation. Wa s National Enquirer Part of Robertson Panel'sPsychological Warfare UFO-Debunking Strategy?On March 14, 1949, at Princeton University, physicists celebrate Albert Einstein's 70th birthday(born March 14, 1879 and died April 18, 1955). Left to right: H. P. Robertson (Robertson Panel),E. Wigner, H. Weyl, K. Goedel, I. I. Rabi, Albert Einstein, R. Ladenburg, J. R. Oppenheimer,G. M. Clemence. Photograph courtesy estate of Howard Schrader.IF IT WERE, COULD YOU TALK ABOUT HOW THERE WAS A CONCENTRATIONON UFO STORIES IN THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER?People aware of the UFO history of controversy are probably aware of something calledthe Robertson Panel. In 1953, the CIA got involved in debunking UFO reports. They puttogether a panel chaired by a scientist called H. P. Robertson. He was a very high-levelscientific intelligence man who was a leading physicist, as well as an intelligence officerand had played an important role in WWII. The recommendation of Robertson’s panel wasthat UFOs be debunked by a covert mass media program of ‘training and debunking,’ asthey called it.This was about the same time that the National Enquirer was getting started by GenePope, Jr., For many years after, the National Enquirer was one of the few nationalnewspapers to consistently cover the UFO topic. What’s interesting about it is that most oftheir stories were quite accurate. They were sensational, by their very nature, but werequite accurate and written by a journalist named Bob Pratt. The stories were true, for themost part, but they mixed them in with the celebrity stories and trashy, sensationalistictopics so that anyone who saw these stories in the National Inquirer would make a mentalconnection between UFOs and rather dubious sensationalistic reporting. So, it cast thewhole subject into disrepute. And of course, that’s exactly what psychological warfarepeople do. They use these ploys to muddy the waters and confuse people about what isreally going on.WHICH IS EXACTLY THE OFFICE THAT GENE POPE, JR. – FOUNDER OF THENATIONAL ENQUIRER – WORKED FOR IN THE CIA.That’s right. It gets even more interesting when you follow the story a bit further. In the1960s and 1970s, the National Enquirer made national, sensational UFO coverage sort of"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"a laughing stock and it kind of set the pattern for other tabloid newspapers to come, whichalso, I think, had peripheral links to the intelligence community – although that’s maybe alittle less clear than with the Enquirer.During the 1970s, Gene Pope, Jr., was having difficulty getting the National Enquirer intothe Winn Dixie grocery store chain. He got help from of all people Melvin Laird, who wasNixon’s Secretary of Defense. Laird arranged a tour of the Nixon White House for WinnDixie store executives and they were so impressed with Pope’s clout with the White Housethat they finally agreed to let the Winn Dixie grocery store chain carry the NationalInquirer.In a story about this in a Forbes magazine, a reporter asked Pope about this connection hehad with the White House and why he had such clout with the national defenseestablishment, and Pope said, ‘It’s just politics. One hand washes the other.’The implication was that Pope was doing something for either the Nixon White House orthe Secretary of Defense and in return, they were helping him get his newspaper out intoas many places as possible. Nixon Defense Secretary Melvin LairdGave Eulogy At Gene Pope, Jr.'s 1988 FuneralNow, the final footnote to this whole amazing story is that when Pope died in 1988, he wasnow one of America’s wealthiest men. Who, of all people, gave the eulogy at his funeralbut former Defense Secretary Melvin Laird under Nixon (Secretary of Defense from 1969to 1973). So, again, you have this interesting tie between the national securityestablishment and the National Enquirer.TWO PLUS TWO EQUALS FOUR – THAT THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER WA S ACENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE PROJECT.Yes, that’s certainly the way it looks to me. The CIA fingerprints are all over it. It’s hard tocome to any other reasonable conclusion.There’s no doubt that the National Enquirer had a huge impact on how many people inthe public at large and also in the journalistic establishment see the UFO topic. Byconnecting flying saucers with UFOs and this kind of trashy UFO reporting, it’s made thelink in peoples’ minds that UFOs are, by definition, disreputable and questionable material.That’s exactly what the Robertson Panel set out to achieve in 1953.The CIA’s official position is that they never really followed through on the RobertsonPanel’s recommendations, but a letter has come to light through recent research thatmakes it clear the CIA was in fact doing this sort of thing because one member of theRobertson Panel in 1966 wrote a hand-written letter to a fellow CIA associate in which heconfessed that he had helped organize a CBS broadcast around the Robertson Panel’sconclusions. This was a famous broadcast narrated by Walter Cronkite. And we know atthat time, CBS had a very close working relationship with the intelligence community. So,it was not at all surprising that if the CIA wanted to debunk UFOs, it would appeal toorganizations such as CBS to help them do that. This letter really establishes that theRobertson Panel’s recommendations were being carried out at least as late as 1966, whichis thirteen years after the recommendations were first made.UFO Policy of Denial in Interest of National SecurityWHY DO YOU THINK THAT SO MUCH EFFORT HAS BEEN PUT INTODISCREDITING AND MISINFORMATION AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE TOKEEP THE MEDIA AND PUBLIC AT AN ARM’S LENGTH DISTANCE FROM WHATLEAKED GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS CALL “EXTRATERRESTRIALBIOLOGICAL ENTITIES?”Well, that’s really the $64 million question. The question everyone would like to have theanswer to. I think initially, there was quite obvious concern expressed in a lot of internalgovernment documents about the surveillance of U. S. military installations and nuclearweapons facilities by flying saucers, or UFOs. So, there was naturally in the minds of themilitary establishment, there was a concern about potential invasion by some unknownforce. In fact, in 1954, President Dwight Eisenhower actually made a denial on the frontpage of The New York Times saying the earth was not being invaded by flying saucers fromouter space."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The New York Times, Front Page, December 16, 1954.This was a topic of great concern at that time and on up into the late 1970s, flying saucersor UFOs were still flying over our nuclear weapons facilities and interfering with ICBMs,according to military personnel. [ For more information about Montana Minuteman missilesilos and UFO phenomena, including bloodless animal mutilations, please see my book, AnAlien Harvest, in the Earthfiles Shop and the reprinted Mystery Stalks the Prairie in theEarthfiles Archive. ]So, there does seem to be this issue of surveillance and interference with military facilities.There might be other issues as well having to do with economic considerations and militaryhardware considerations.Mutilated steer found in Caldwell, Kansas, on January 31, 1992.The jaw flesh had been removed in a neat, bloodless rectangular excision,typical of thousands of other mutilated animals reported around the worldsince the 1940s.

I think the Defense establishment wants to project an imageof being in control and they are obviously not in control! (laughs) And haven’t been forquite a long time. I don’t think they want to confess that to the public because that’s thesource of their power.I suppose another concern is about what the public reaction would be if the government"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"came out and said, ‘Yes, these things are going on and there’s really very little we can doabout them.’ARE YOU CONVINCED THAT THE PRESENCE OF MORE THAN ONEEXTRATERRESTRIAL – OR SOME KIND OF NON-HUMAN INTELLIGENCE – IS ATWORK ON THE PLANET NOW AND HAS BEEN PERHAPS FOR MILLENNIA?It looks that way to me, Linda. I’ve read many thousands of these accounts from what Ithink are credible sources and I don’t think you can come to any other conclusion thatthere is some sort of intelligence more advanced than human beings has been involvedwith human affairs for quite a long time. I think we first became aware of this in a big wayfollowing WWII, but I suspect it’s been going on for much longer than that – probablymany thousands of years if not a good deal longer.DO YOU THINK THE CIA AND OTHER INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES STILL HAVETHE FIX IN TO WIRE THE NEW YORK TIMES AND OTHER MEDIA?I think they do. I haven’t seen any real change in media policy about this in the UnitedStates. So, I think there is still a very large tendency to try to keep the subjects underwraps. But, it’s a question of whether the CIA and government really have muchcredibility left with the public anymore because if you look at public opinion polls, it’spretty clear that most people don’t believe what the government is saying about the issue.So, in a sense, they’ve already lost the battle – even though they continue fighting it, usingthe old methods they’ve had for so many years.DO YOU THINK IN OUR LIFE TIME THAT THE TRUTH WILL FINALLY COME TOTHE WORLD THAT WE’RE NOT ALONE, THAT OTHER ADVANCEDINTELLIGENCES ARE HERE INTERACTING WITH THE EARTH AND HAVE BEENFOR MILENNIA?That’s a good question. It depends on who you look to for your source of what is true. Imean, if you look to the political establishment, they are not very good at telling the truthabout much of anything, much less UFOs! (laughs) I think it’s against their nature to speakthe truth about almost anything. But the preponderance of the evidence that’s leaking out– and largely because of the internet, I think – makes it pretty clear that this is going on. Ithink the public has reached that conclusion independently of any officialacknowledgement by the Power Elite.I see this as a sort of microcosm of a much broader political problem in the United Statesright now, which is a battle for an open society. There is a battle going on between peoplewho want to continue an open democratic society and those that want to try to suppressthat. We see this manifesting in a lot of areas outside the UFO area, but the UFOs are partof that whole problem of secrecy in government and unwillingness to run our country in ademocratic fashion.AND TELL THE TRUTH.And tell the truth, that’s right.\""},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Above: September 8, 1966, handwritten letter from astronomer Thornton Page, Ph.D.,Professor of Astronomy, Wesleyan University Middletown, Connecticut.
