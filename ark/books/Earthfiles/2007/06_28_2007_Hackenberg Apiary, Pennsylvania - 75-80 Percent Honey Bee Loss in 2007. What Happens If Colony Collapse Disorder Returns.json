Millions have disappeared without explanationso far in North America, Europe, Ukraine, China, Taiwan, Guatemala, Brazil. Highon the list of possible causes are pesticides such as neonicitinoids madefrom nicotine, which can harm bee memories and immune systems. June 28, 2007 Lewisburg, Pennsylvania - The Apiary Inspectors of America reportedlast week that the still-puzzling phenomenon of disappearing honey bees that scientists call\"Colony Collapse Disorder\" has been reported in 35 states, 5 Canadian provinces, a dozenEuropean countries, China, Taiwan, Guatemala and Brazil. And today I learned from theApiary Inspectors of America President, Jerry Hayes, who has been in Russia the pastthree weeks, that Ukraine honey bee keepers have reported massive disappearancesthrough March of this year as well. The Apiary Inspectors estimate that a quarter ofAmerican beekeeping operations in the United States lost more than 50% of their coloniesbetween September 2006 and March 2007, and that some beekeepers lost 90%.On Tuesday, June 26, 2007, U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA), John Thune (R-SD) andBob Casey (D-PA) introduced legislation to \"help research, protect and maintainAmerica’s bee and native pollinator population and ensure the viability of crops that relyon them for pollination.\" Experts estimate crops nationwide that depend on honey bees forpollination are valued near $18 billion.Since October 2006 through March 2007, it's now estimated that more than 25% of theAmerican honey bee population disappeared in a still-unsolved phenomenon that scientistscall \"Colony Collapse Disorder.\"The Pollinator Protection Act would authorize $89 million in federal funding for researchand grant programs at the USDA for five years to maintain and protect honey bees andother native pollinators such as bumblebees and yellow jackets.California's U. S. Senator Boxer stressed that, “California’s almond crop alone is worth $2billion a year and requires nearly one half of all the honey bees in the country forpollination. The future of that crop and other important crops such as avocados, apples,berries and soybeans is in jeopardy if there aren’t enough bees to pollinate them forharvest.”I also talked recently with Marianne Frazier, who is overseeing the investigation ofpesticide impacts on honey bees. Currently, there is preliminary data that indicate higher"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"amounts of nicotine-based pesticides in the wax and pollen of deserted colony collapsedisorder hives. One fact is certain: the immune systems of the few Colony CollapseDisorder bees that have been left behind for study all show severe weakening.Entomologist and Penn State Prof. Diana Cox-Foster reports, \"We were shocked by thehuge number of pathogens present in each adult bee.\"Further testing on the nicotine-based pesticides and many others is ongoing and the ColonyCollapse Disorder Science Team hopes to have another report to the public this fall.Meanwhile, David Hackenberg, owner of Hackenberg Apiaries in Lewisburg,Pennsylvania, for nearly half a century is worried. He lost nearly 80% of his honey beesand went into debt to stay in business. Right now, his bees - plus honey bees he importedfrom Australia - are doing OK. But Dave doesn't think they are as strong as they should be.He's trying to avoid as many pesticides as possible, especially the nicotine-based toxins,and says if Colony Collapse Disorder hits again this fall and winter, he might be forced outof business. I talked with Dave Hackenberg this week in Maine where he had taken honeybees to pollinate blue berries.Interview:David Hackenberg, Owner, Hackenberg Apiaries, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, since1962: \"In our own operation, we ended up losing probably 80% of them – 75% to 80% ofthem and we’ve rebuilt back from roughly 100 hives to 2400 hives. Normally this time ofyear, we would have 3200, but we’re still down 800 hives of bees. So, we’re not back towhere we normally should be and we’re not alone. There are a lot of beekeepers across thecountry that weren’t able to get their numbers back.HAVE YOU PERIODICALLY CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE DISAPPEARANCES?Yes. We’re still seeing – not in great numbers – but we’re still seeing colonies here andthere that are having the problem. And other guys are, too. Bees just don’t want to comeback right. There’s something wrong. They don’t want to build up. Or they were lookingpretty good and now they’re starting to fall apart from whatever. And whether they’ve gotsomething stored in the beehive, it’s hard to say.SINCE YOU HAD LOST ABOUT 80% OF YOUR BEES, WHAT HAVE YOU DONESINCE OCTOBER UNTIL NOW TO REPLACE THOSE BEES?One of the things we’ve done is bring bees in from Australia. Another thing we did wasirradiate a lot of the boxes and equipment. We really think that has helped because you’rebasically putting the bees on a brand new irradiated – everything is gone. I mean there’s nopathogens, no viruses – whether or not - scientists tell us something is breaking down theimmune systems. So, if you can get rid of all the (disease pathogen) problems that’s therewhen the immune system is broke down, why then the bees have a better chance.BUT WHAT IF WHAT IS BREAKING DOWN THE IMMUNE SYSTEMS AREPESTICIDES LIKE THE NEONICITINOIDS?What if? Well, then we – unfortunately, right now we’re trying to run as far away, stay asfar away from all those chemicals – those particular chemicals (nicotine-based) as we canuntil we figure out what this whole problem is about. We can’t get totally away from them,but we’re trying to keep as many bees as we can without coming in contact with thosedifferent products.Most of our growers that we pollinate for have been real cooperative and have not usedthem. We’re hoping all this is going to keep more of them alive than we did a year ago. Avoiding Pesticides As Much As PossibleSO, ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHANGES THAT YOU AND A FEW OTHERS ARETRYING IS TO ELIMINATE AS MANY PESTICIDES AS POSSIBLE?Yeah, we’re trying to stay away from them. One of the things we do before we go movebees into an area is go around and talk to farmers and see what they are using forinsecticides.IF THEY SAY THEY ARE USING IMIDACLOPRID OR OTHER NICITINOIDS, WHATDO YOU SAY?‘I’m sorry, we ain’t coming back this year.’ Or, if we’re renting bees to a vegetable growerthat’s used it, the cost, we’ve made some real increase in the cost for them just to protect"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"ourselves.Whether it’s the insecticide or not still remains to be seen, but if you look at the literatureput out by the manufacturers of these products (nicotine-based pesticides), they say fourthings:1) Break down the immune system2) Cause memory loss3) Cause nervous system disorder4) And cause the insects to quit feeding.THIS IS THE NICOTINE-BASED PESTICIDES?Right. And basically, that’s what is going on inside the beehives where these things(disappearances) happen.ARE YOU SEEING THAT YOUR IMPORTED AUSTRALIAN BEES ARE BETTEROFF AND HEALTHIER THAN THE OTHERS?Well, not really. I don’t think you could say that. I mean, they (Australian bees) are doinglike the rest of them. Imported Chinese Pollen - Could It Be A Problem?WHAT ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT HAS SURFACED IN THE LAST MONTH OR SOTHAT SOME BEEKEEPERS IN THE U. S. WERE IMPORTING POLLEN FROMCHINA TO HELP SUPPLEMENT THE HONEY BEE FOOD HERE IN THE U. S. ANDIT MIGHT HAVE HAD SOME TOXIC PROPERTIES?There’s a lot of us that’s never used that stuff. And I’m one of them. Never once in ourlives have we ever used Chinese pollen or anybody else’s pollen for that matter. A lot ofother guys that had this (CCD) problem never used it. We’re not sure what all it is, butsomething is definitely breaking down their (honey bees) immune system.SO, THERE IS NO DIRECT LINK AT ALL BETWEEN THE IMPORTED CHINESEBEE POLLEN AND WHAT YOU’VE EXPERIENCED?No, we have never fed collected/imported pollen to our bees. Still Worried About GMOsin Combination with PesticidesIN YOUR GUT, WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS ALL GOING TO COME DOWNEVENTUALLY TO BEING THE CAUSE OF COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER?Personally, I think you’re going to find it’s a lot of different things that piled up – anaccumulative effect. But with the insecticide situation and whether or not putting thisinsecticide with genetically modified crops – corn, soybeans, canola, cotton and all that –as a seed treatment? That might be a very large portion of this thing (CCD). We don’tknow what putting this on as a seed treatment (nicotine-based pesticides) has to do – Imean, the manufacturers say the seed treatment goes up only so far in the plant. Well,there’s already been pollen studies been done and found that the pesticide is in the pollen.So, if it’s going up only so far in the plant, how did it get into the flowers?WHICH MEANS THAT EVEN THE MANUFACTURERS OF THE GENETICALLYMODIFIED CROPS AND HERBICIDES DON’T REALLY KNOW WHAT ISHAPPENING OUT THERE IN THE WILD FIELDS?Correct. Could CCD Be Back in Fall 2007?DO YOU THINK THERE IS STILL A POSSIBILITY THAT THE FALL OF 2007 MIGHTSEE A RESURGENCE OF COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER?Well, I’m worried about that. I mean, that’s one of the reasons I’m trying to run away fromcorn, soybeans, vegetables I’m not getting paid for. Fortunately, most of my vegetable"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"growers have switched chemicals and going to something different. Our fruit and blueberrygrowers have all quit using this stuff and several of my pumpkin growers have quit using it.So, we’re hoping that’s going to remedy the situation.WHEN YOU TALK PRIVATELY WITH SCIENTISTS AND OTHER BEEKEEPERS, DOYOU GET THE SENSE THAT IT IS THE NICOTINE-BASED PESTICIDES THATMIGHT BE MOST RESPONSIBLE?Well, a lot of beekeepers will tell you that’s what they think is going on. Some of thescientists, for reasons to protect the universities they work for – you know, you’ve got tohave everything down on a scientific sheet or printout before you can make somestatements. But there are a number of them that I think are leaning in the same directionthat we are.For instance, I got a call and they made the comment like, ‘One of the scientists told me tocall you, that you could probably say more than they could.’ Well, because I’m a privateperson, I can have an opinion, whereas the person in the university, they got to watch whatthey say until it’s all in black and white for university reasons.I DO REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST TALKED TO YOU ON FEBRUARY 16, 2007, THATYOU WERE ADAMANT THAT YOU FELT THAT PESTICIDES WERE SOMEHOWRELATED.Well, I still do. There’s no ifs, ands or buts about it.WHAT CAN THIS NATION AND THE WORLD DO TO REDUCE PESTICIDES?(laughs) That’s an interesting question because we’re controlled, especially in this country– agriculture is pretty much controlled by the chemical companies and the large seedcompanies. And now that they’ve gone together and made agreements betweenthemselves, it’s pretty hard to go up against City Hall. Other Pollinators DisappearingBut one of the facts is that not only are they finding honey bees that are in this condition(disappearing), we’re also finding the lack of other natural pollinators that normally havebeen here. A laboratory in Pennsylvania that makes venom for allergic shots for bee stingsfrom yellow jackets and so forth, the gentleman who runs that business, we sell him beesto collect venom from to make the allergy shots. He was telling me a week or ten days agowhen he came by to pick up some bees one day that they’ve actually had to import yellowjackets from New Zealand for the last two years because they are not here. They normallycollect yellow jackets in the fall when they know the nest is as big as it’s going to get, andthey’ve done this for years. This business has been going on for at least 25 to 30 years atleast, or longer than that – 37 to 38 years this company has been in business. This gentleman’s father started it and it’s owned by several individuals now, but what he’stelling me is that all of a sudden when they go to collect the yellow jacket nests in the fallof the year, there’s hardly any yellow jackets left in them. The nests are there, but thepopulations are gone.THIS IS JUST THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS?Last two years.SINCE 2005?Right.THEY’VE NEVER HAD TO IMPORT YELLOW JACKETS BEFORE?No.THEY HAVE TO GO TO NEW ZEALAND TO GET THEM?Right. You get small orchard people calling up after the fact saying they didn’t have anybees in their orchard. They never worried about it before and now all of a sudden they arefinding they hardly have any apples because there was no bees there. So, where did theygo? I don’t know. Where do wild pollinators go? I don’t know.Penn State does a survey every several years – I think 2002 and again this year – on thewild natural pollinators in apple orchards. And they said the decline was just staggering. Imean, the difference in numbers over the last couple of years is just staggering."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Are There Enough Pollinators for American Crops?I TALKED WITH JERRY HAYES IN FLORIDA’S DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE ABOUTA MONTH AGO IN EARLY MAY. I ASKED HIM IF HE THOUGHT THERE WEREENOUGH POLLINATORS IN AMERICAN HONEY BEES NOW TO MEET ALL OFTHE POLLINATION NEEDS FOR ALL OF THE FOODS FROM COAST TO COAST.HE SAID, ‘MAYBE. IT LOOKS LIKE A 50/50 CHANCE.’DO YOU HAVE ANY PROFESSIONAL APPRAISAL NOW ABOUT WHETHERTHERE HAVE BEEN ENOUGH POLLINATORS TO MEET ALL OF THE FOODGROWING NEEDS?The job got done pretty much. I mean the pollination season for the most part is over,except for vegetables and watermelons and pumpkins, which are not as big a high demand.But, here just in Maine alone where I’m right down the road from where I’m sitting, thecompany brought bees all the way from Bakersfield, California, all the way to thenortheast corner of the United States to pollinate the blueberry crop. This is unheard of. You’re trucking bees 3000+ miles across the United States to get the job done here. Now,never before have they (blueberry growers in Maine) had to go to California to find beesto cover the blueberry crop here.The prices they paid were kind of astronomical. We’ve had a 50% increase in the price ofbees this year. The company I pollinated for here in Maine got a good crop of blueberries,but it’s adding cost and somebody down the road is going to have to pay that. The personwho has to pay it is the consumer.Whether there is going to be enough bees in the future to get the job done, that’s going todepend on what happens down the road. The next big test is almonds in California. That’snot until January and February. So, it’s going to depend on what happens with the bees thissummer and this winter. If we can survive? Total bee colony numbers are downconsiderably.IF COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER RESURFACES IN THE FALL TO THE WINTERGOING INTO 2008, WHAT HAPPENS?We’ll be short on bees and probably short on bees in California probably. I mean, you canalways rent boxes. But to get the job done, you’ve got to have bees in the boxes. There’s adifference between just renting beehives and renting good quality hives of bees. In ourown operation, we normally bring 3,000 hives of bees here to Maine. But we only hadabout 2,000 to bring. So, we had to go out.... We could have split those bees some moreand made more bees out of them. But then they would not have been strong enough to dothe job. Whether it’s a blueberry or apple farmer or almond grower or whoever, they aredepending on strong beehives. If they don’t have good, strong hives to get the (pollination)job done, then they don’t get a crop!WHAT THIS ALL BOILS DOWN TO IS THAT THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOWBARELY HAS ENOUGH POLLINATORS TO MEET THE FOOD GROWINGDEMANDS.Right. There are bees out there, but the problem is that they aren’t in the right places. Andit’s going to cost a lot more money to get them moved from place to place. I meantransportation alone – I just heard the other day here that transportation alone to get thebees out of California to here (Maine blueberries) cost $40/hive. It was only a couple ofyears ago that $40/hive was all we were getting to pollinate the crop, let alone - but thisyear, the trucking bill ALONE was $40/hive to bring them bees to Maine. If the farmer isgoing to get his money back, he’s going to have to pass it on to the consumer.WE’RE AT AN UNKNOWN JUNCTION THEN IF WE DON’T KNOW WHETHERCOLONLY COLLAPSE DISORDER IS GOING TO COME BACK.That’s correct.” What Happens If CCD Hits AgainFall 2007 - Spring 2008?Dennis vanEngelsdorp, M.

That will mean they are bankrupt and out of business.And that will have impact not only on them, but the farm growers who are relying on themfor pollination.
