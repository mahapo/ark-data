April 21, 2007 Port Charlotte, Florida - The Port Charlotte Sun-Herald reported onApril 18, 2007, under the headline Cows! or The Bovine Invaders: \"There were eight,big-eyed and long-horned, voraciously eating lawns and carelessly trampling the gardensthat lay in their path. ... Cindy Collins was one of those who called 911 when she saw theanimals. Collins didn't think anyone would believer her. 'There's cows at my house! There's"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"cows with horns!' is what she told the 911 dispatcher.\"Cindy's 911 call was around 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday morning, April 17, 2007. Otherneighbors were also calling the police which called Charlotte County Animal Control. By9:30 a.m., Sergeant Cathy Katzman arrived on the scene and managed to get the eightlong-horns together in one place while she waited for Florida \"cowboys\" to come andround up the mysteriously displaced animals into a truck for safe keeping at AnimalControl until they could find the owner.Interview:A dog barks at a long-horn-mix heifer on Burlingame Avenuein Port Charlotte, Florida, early Tuesday morning, April 17, 2007.Eight long-horns trampled lawns and tomato plants before being rounded upand taken to Animal Control.

He came out,took a look at them, told me they were not his cows. He tried to help me find out wherethe cattle might have come from and neither one of us could find the property.My department contacted some local cowboys that we knew and who had helped out onprevious calls for other animals and they came out, rounded up the eight head of cattle andtransported them to our impound area which is in Punta Gorda.Flori da cow boys tryi ng to round up the ei ght l ong-horn cattl e for transport toCharlotte County Animal Control on April 17, 2007.

He came toour office and identified the cows through photographs, described the animals to me anddescribed their brands. The cattle are in fact his. He does not know how they escaped theconfinement area that he had them in, but he did tell me that his gate had been taken off itshinges. But neither of us can figure out how the eight long-horn cattle ended up wherethey did.WHERE WERE THE CATTLE BEFORE THEY ENDED UP IN PORT CHARLOTTE?They were on a piece of property approximately two miles east, if you could draw astraight line, from where they were supposed to be off of a road called Loveland Blvd.,which is here in Charlotte County. It’s one of the few areas here in Port Charlotte whereyou can have livestock."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"He’s a local man who lives in DeSoto County, which is the neighboring county. And hehad the eight long-horn cattle on a piece of leased property in Charlotte County. When hecontacted us, he said, ‘I believe you have my cows!’ (Owner's name withheld at AnimalControl's request.)They’re all long-horns and fairly young. Two of them had their year brands on them. Onewas a 4, which tells me that she was born in 2004. The other was a 5, which tells me shewas born in 2005. So the animals are somewhere between two and three years of age.\"4\" brand on one of female long-horns,indicating she was born in 2004. Image © 2007 bySgt. Cathy Katzman, Charlotte County Animal Control.WHAT DID THE OWNER SAY ABOUT THE GATE LIFTED OFF ITS HINGES?He’s not sure if someone was doing vandalism or trying to steal the cattle. He’s not surewhat was going on there. He is going to file an offense report with our Charlotte CountySheriff’s Department just in case there are any further problems out there at his leasedproperty.DID HE SAY HE FOUND ANYTHING UNUSUAL AT THE GATE HINGES?No, he didn’t. He just told me that the gate had been removed.WAS THE GATE LYING ANYWHERE NEAR THE CORRAL?It was apparently lying off to the side.HAD HE EVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAPPEN BEFORE?Not that he stated to me, no.HAVE YOU EVER ENCOUNTERED ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE?I haven’t encountered it personally, but I have heard from various ranchers in our areawhere they are having problems with people going in and cutting their fences, usually toget to something on the other side to go 4-wheeling. They’ll go in by cutting the fence andthe cows will get loose. But you usually find out when it’s too late after the cows are gone.With these eight long-horns, somebody might have been trying to pull a prank orsomebody was trying to trespass on his property. It could have been that someone wastrying to take the cows. This is speculation. I don’t really know. Home Corral Is 2 Miles Eastof Port Charlotte NeighborhoodHOW DID THE CATTLE TRAVEL TWO MILES FROM THEIR ORIGINAL CORRALINTO PORT CHARLOTTE?(laughs) That’s what I would like to know because they had to cross a very busy road. Wedidn’t get the first call (at 7:30 am) until after they wound up in the neighborhood. Theroad that they crossed, Kings Highway, is heavily traveled and it’s beyond me how anyonecould have been going down that road and not seen eight cows, either trying to cross orstanding on the side! (laughs)IT’S ALMOST AS IF THEY WERE PICKED UP BY SOMETHING IN THE AIR FROMWHERE THEY ORIGINATED AND THEN WERE PUT DOWN IN PORTCHARLOTTE FROM THE AIR?Yeah, you could say that. They just kind of appeared out of nowhere quite literally."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"WERE THE CATTLE ON TUESDAY MORNING AGITATED, NERVOUS ORDISORIENTED?They seemed a little nervous. They were in an environment they weren’t used to. Therewere neighbors coming out and possibly spooking them. But when there weren’t peoplearound, they stayed very calm in the area where I had them until the cowboys could comeout and round them up.SO, IT’S FAIR TO SAY THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED, YOU STILL HAVE A BIGMYSTERY ABOUT HOW THESE EIGHT LONG-HORNS GOT FROM THEIRORIGINAL LOCATION 2 MILES TO THE EAST TO THE PORT CHARLOTTENEIGHBORHOOD?Exactly. I would really like to know how they wound up there! But I think that’s going tobe one of the great mysteries because if they traveled two miles on foot, they had to crossa large, busy road.”Charlotte County, Florida, Animal Control truck and two of the eight long-horncattle that mysteriously turned up in a Port Charlotte neighborhood the earlymorning of April 17, 2007, two miles west of their home corral.Image © 2007 by Sgt. Cathy Katzman.More Information:In the book, The Dyfed Enigma, © 1979 by Randall Jones Pugh and F. W. Holiday, inChapter 5 the authors report the mysterious and repeated transport in England of cowsfrom one farmer's gated pasture to another farmer's pasture about a mile away - in thenight.In the Ripperston-Broadmoore area at Ripperston Farm run by farmer Billie Coombes,\"...a herd of some 100 cattle had escaped during the night about half a dozentimes. On these occasions the entire herd had apparently slipped silently pastthe house, gone down the lane, then turned down a side-road to end up atBroadmoore Farm, half a mile away. This meant that over an hour was wastedin bringing the animals back.Pugh asked Billie Coombes: 'How can you account to me that about 100 cattle- fully-grown beasts - get out of a bolted yard, without anyone opening thegate, and creep past the house without disturbing yourself or any member ofthe family or your dog, Blackie, and manage to travel half a mile to aneighbour's field?''It's the same as I said at the time, they must have flew there!''What was the state of the gate when you went over to the yard?''It was still locked! That's the funny part of it. It was still locked, but therewere no cattle in it!'\"Another remarkable fact described by Billie Coombes to Randall Jones Pugh was, \"Thecows can't cross any of the fields (on foot) because of electric fences.\"For further information about mysterious animal disappearances and deaths, see my booksAn Alien Harvest, the 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities, and my documentary films inthe Earthfiles Shop.
