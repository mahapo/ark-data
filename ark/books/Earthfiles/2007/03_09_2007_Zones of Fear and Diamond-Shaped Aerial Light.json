Residents there reportedlots of unidentified aerial lights and silver disks, both day and night, along with strangeflying creatures that resembled large humans with bat wings. That year, one of the mostfamous investigators of earth mysteries was John A. Keel. He went to Point Pleasant toinvestigate and coined the term “Mothman” for the winged humanoids being seen flying inthe air.Visitors from Space: The Astonishing True Storyof the Mothman Prophecies © 1976 by John A.

Image by Wikipedia.John Keel wrote a book about his investigations entitled The Mothman Prophecies,published in 1976. In Chapter 7, he describes one night being on the trail of a creature withglowing red eyes who was seen by many, but never photographed or caught. Keel wasdriving in rural country after midnight and reported: “As I passed a certain point on one of the isolated roads, I was suddenlyengulfed in fear. I stepped on the gas and after I went a few yards, my fearvanished as quickly as it came. I continued to drive, eventually returning againto the same spot. And again, a wave of unspeakable fear swept over me. Idrove quickly away from the place and then stopped, puzzled. Why would thisone stretch of road produce this hair-raising effect?I turned around and slowly headed back, trying to note trees, fence posts, andother landmarks in the dark. Once again, when I reached that particular point,the hair tingled on the back of my neck and I became genuinely afraid. WhenI emerged from the other side of this invisible zone, I stopped and got out ofmy car. The air was perfectly still. There wasn’t any audible sound – not evena bird call.I walked back to the “zone of fear” slowly, alert for any rustle of bushes,measuring my own breathing and emotions. I was perfectly calm until I tookone step too many and was back in the fear zone. I almost panicked and ran.But I forced myself to look around and proceed slowly. ...I steeled myself andwalked once more through that invisible stream, scared out of my wits intransit...”Thirteen years later on December 29, 1980, another bizarre unidentified aerial objectshaped like a bright, white, glowing diamond, hovered low over a Texas highway. Drivingtoward it was 51-year-old Betty Cash, her friend Vickie Landrum and Vickie’s 7-year-oldgrandson, Colby. The three could see the object shoot down a stream of reddish-orangeflames at regular, fast intervals. Vickie Landrum later described it as “like a diamond offire.” There was also a constant beeping sound coming from the strange diamond-shapedcraft. Then the travelers saw dozens of helicopters circling the object.The Cash-Landrum UFO Incident© 1998 by John F. Schuessler, Geo Graphics.Since 1980, there has been intense controversy about whether the diamond was a U. S. topsecret military project – or a vehicle from outer space some how involved with theAmerican government. If the big diamond-shaped craft was not made by humans, who – orwhat – was piloting it? Zones of Fear in Rocky MountainsRecently a 44-year-old North Dakota resident contacted me about her own experienceswith zones of fear and a large diamond-shaped aerial craft that appeared before her andher nephew around 2003. The woman has requested I not use her real name or exactlocation. So, I will call her Terry Jones from southwestern North Dakota near theBadlands."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Terry Jones and her husband, a ranch manager, moved to theTheodore Roosevelt National Park Badlands regionof North Dakota in 1999, with their three young daughters.Terry was born in 1962 and spent her twenties working for the Forest Service in Idaho as afire fighter and on a road survey crew. She met her husband in the mid 1980s and theymoved to a place north of Livingston, Montana, near the Bridger Mountains. By 1999, herhusband accepted a job to manage a ranch at the edge of the Badlands in southwesternNorth Dakota. Occasionally where she worked in the Rocky Mountains, Terry would comeacross specific zones that seemed to repel her with fear. Smart and tough, she was shockedwhile backing away from one of those zones of fear because she got the clear mentalimpression of a small, grey, non-human entity, sensed it was alien and that it wasunderground and did not want humans in its “territory.”She has given me permission to share some of her experiences. One occurred in 1990when Terry was living on a ranch at Henry's Lake, Idaho, with her husband and first child.After dinner, she was doing dishes in front of a window with a view of the mountainsaround Henry's Lake. Suddenly she noticed a very bright light in the sky.Henry's Lake is underlined in yellow on the Idahoside of the Montana border in the Targhee National Forest.Click for Earthfiles Podcast Interview:1990: Zone of Fear"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Mountain At Henry's Lake, IdahoTerry Jones, Rancher, Southwestern North Dakota: \"From my kitchen window, I’mlooking west towards the lake. The mountains are to the north and the south and I see thisbright light up in the sky – very, very bright. Stationary, just sitting there, too large to be astar. And I’m thinking, ‘Wow, That is a very large, bright light and it’s just sitting there.How strange! Where did this come from?’ And as I stood there looking at the light thinkingthose thoughts, three smaller lights come shooting out of it just as bright, but smaller. Andthey come out one after the other, not at the same time and are shooting out of it (biggerlight) to the north and are going behind the mountain range to the north, disappearingaround the mountain range. These lights have like a comet tail on them as they travelthrough the sky. They are going very fast.‘Whew! Whew!’WHAT COLOR?They were just white – very bright, white light. And they were the same intensity ofbrightness also. All of them, the stationary light as well as the three that traveled out of it.The three lights shot out behind the mountain range and disappeared out of sight. I reallygot the feeling they were headed toward the ground behind the mountain range (north ofHenry’s Lake Mountains) – that was their destination. Then the stationary light shotstraight up and disappeared.Now, this area the lights went into is definitely zone of fear like you and I were talkingabout where you don’t go there because there is just this feeling that humans don’t belongthere. For myself, I’ve spent my life working in the woods backpacking, mountainclimbing, and there are a few areas I’ve been to that feel the same way.Bright light emitted three smaller white lights that moved rapidly downbehind the Henry's Lake mountains, the location where Terry had sensed suddenand inexplicable fear. Terry's ranch house in bottom center was 1 mile from Henry's Lake,Idaho, 1/2 mile from the base of Henry's Lake mountains and 2 miles from the Zone of Fearbehind the 10,000-foot-altitude Henry's Lake mountain. Drawing © 2007 by Terry Jones.One is up on that 10,000-foot-peak that rises next to Henry's Lake in Idaho. One time afriend and I had probably got a mile back in there and just got too nervous, too upset. Wecould not go any farther. We felt like it would be wrong to go any farther, like somethingbad would happen, sort of an overwhelming fear of dread came over us. And we didn’t go.We turned around and left and I’ve never had any desire to go back to that area everagain, although I’ve been curious since I saw those lights travel back there and I knowthey must have landed because of the angle they were shooting down. They were kind ofdefinitely heading straight toward the ground, it looked like to me.YOU HAVE COME TO FEEL THAT THERE ARE AREAS OUT IN THE WILDERNESSTHAT SEEM TO BE ALMOST MARKED BY ZONES OF FEAR - THAT HUMANSSENSE THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO GO INTO THEM?Yeah, I’ve felt that feeling as though this was just a bad energy area – a negative feeling –and humans did not belong there.LET’S GO INTO WHAT YOU HAVE COME TO SUSPECT MIGHT BE BEHINDTHESE ZONES OF FEAR BECAUSE OF EXPERIENCES YOU’VE HAD. Mid-1980s, Zone of FearNorthwest of Dubois, Wyoming"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The first time I had that feeling was a prophetic sense that it was an alien energy, that’s theonly way I can describe it. I was in Wyoming north and west of the town of Dubois,Wyoming. It’s another very remote area. I was with my boyfriend at the time hiking.Dubois, Wyoming, is marked in blue southeast of Yellowstone National Park.Terry's mid-1980s Zone of Fear experience was on a 10,000-foot peak northwest of Dubois.There was a 10,000 peak there we had climbed to the top and were climbing back downthe backside of it and we got into this area where I just got really scared. I said, ‘My gosh,this is really a negative energy area! What is it?’ I’m sitting there feeling this energy andfeeling scared and nervous – it was the first time I felt this in the back country and the onlything that came to my gut level feeling was aliens. And at that time I had not had anyexperience seeing lights or anything, but I could not get out of that area fast enough.WHAT YEAR WAS THIS?Back in the mid-1980s.DID ANY IMPRESSION COME INTO YOUR MIND WHEN YOU FELT THATOVERWHELMING FEAR?No, just that I needed to get out of there as soon as possible, that it was not a good place tobe.WHY DO YOU THINK BACK THEN THAT YOU LINKED IT TOEXTRATERRESTRIALS?In that Zone of Fear, it was just a gut level feeling that it was an alien energy – mechanicalalmost. Does that sound strange?MECHANICAL AND NOT HUMAN?Yeah.YOU HAVE LIVED WITH INTUITIVE SENSES THROUGH MOST OF YOUR LIFE?Yes, I’ve had a lot of psychic experiences and dreams that have come true.YOUR LIVING LIFE WITH INTUITION HAS REINFORCED THAT WHEN YOU DOFEEL A SENSE OF FEAR OR DREAD THAT THERE IS A REASON FOR IT?Yes, absolutely. A Diamond-Shaped Aerial Light"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"But it was here (Badlands of North Dakota) that I had my most intense alien encounterfour or five years ago (around 2003-2004). It was on the ranch. It was evening. Mynephew was living with us at the time and I had my three daughters and we were justsitting around in the evening having a conversation. My nephew had grown up inCalifornia and was a city boy. And I knew he had never really slept outside and looked atthe night sky. And I just got this overwhelming urge to get him outside to look at the stars.So, we go outside and there is this fantastic display of northern lights going on at the time.That was a nice added benefit because he got to watch the northern lights for the first timein his life, plus see all the fantastic stars in the sky on the prairie and Badlands of NorthDakota.Pretty soon there was a light cruising along the northern sky within the northern lights,traveling through it and zigzagging back and forth. We see this and go, ‘Wow, a UFO!Look!’ We were all excited. I had two of my daughters outside with me and just with themention of ‘UFO,’ they ran to the house because it scared them.My nephew and I stayed out there to watch. This UFO continues to travel across thenorthern sky in a zigzag pattern and then suddenly shoots straight down behind the horizonin the north with kind of a bright flash.This was just another bright, white light. It was kind of neat because here the northernlights were going on and here was this fantastic night outside and ‘Wow, we get to watchUFOs, too!’ (laughs) And pretty soon, there are three lights up there and they are all kindof dancing, that’s the only way to describe it – dancing around in the northern lights. Thisis really a fantastic thing to watch. Three little lights, but very bright, several miles a way, Iam thinking, because here in North Dakota you can see pretty far to the horizon.Three unidentified aerial lights making patterns in the green aurora borealis (Northern lights)above the Badlands, North Dakota, ranch where Terry Jones and her nephewwatched 2003 or 2004. Drawing © 2007 by Terry Jones.North of us, they are just sort of zipping around in the northern lights and it was like:‘What were they doing? Why were they zipping around in the northern lights? Was there areason why they were doing that?’ I don’t know. Or did the northern lights have anythingto do with it? I don’t know either. My husband and I speculated later that maybe they dosomething with their craft like collect the negative and positive ions out of theatmosphere? I don’t know.Pretty soon they all broke up, all three going in different directions. One takes off to thewest, one takes off to the east, one took off another direction and they all disappeared outof sight. My nephew and I are just standing there saying ‘Wow! That was so cool’So, we’re watching the sky to see some of the lights show back up and all of a sudden,we’re like, ‘Holy crap! Look in the sky!’ I look up where he’s looking and there is a huge,very bright diamond-shaped light right above us. When I say huge, it was not bigger thanthe moon. But very big, bigger than a star. (Sketch # 3, diamond in upper left.)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Terry and her nephew are pointing at the diamond-shaped light straight above themthat appeared to be about half the size of the full moon on an evening in either 2003 or 2004,at the ranch in the Badlands of southwestern North Dakota. Drawing © 2007 by Terry Jones.AND VERY CLEARLY A DIAMOND SHAPE AS YOU WOULD DRAW A DIAMOND,LET’S SAY, IN SCHOOL?Very clearly a diamond shape. We both agreed to that. We said immediately, ‘That’sdiamond shaped! That’s weird. It’s got to be a UFO!’ We don’t have any diamond-shapedcraft that we know about anyway. We’re watching this diamond-shaped light right aboveus in utter excitement and fascination.A few minutes have gone by and it’s just sitting there and we’re sitting there watching it.Then all of a sudden, I get a little nervous like, ‘Maybe they are getting ready to abduct us.Maybe any minute now a beam is going to come shooting out of the bottom of it and we’regoing to go up like you see in TV shows.’The minute I start feeling this fear of abduction, the craft starts moving away from us tothe north, zigzagging as it goes very slowly across the sky.ALMOST LEAVING WITH A SASHAY LIKE, 'OK, YOU'RE AFRAID. WE'RE GOINGTO LEAVE'?Yes, I thought it was related to my fear. The second I started feeling the fear andimagining abduction in my mind, the light started moving north very slowly. Then I wasalmost sorry I felt that way because I felt like I had chased it away. And it just slowlydisappeared up into the sky – the light got smaller and smaller and smaller, zigzagging thewhole time, and then just disappeared straight up. A Reptilian HumanoidIt was after this incident, within a year afterwards, I had a dream that I feel is relatedsomehow. The dream is very clear to me to this day, so maybe it wasn’t just a dream.Maybe it was their way of contacting me without putting fear into me. Maybe they arecapable of doing that and I think there is a part of me that believes that is true. I wasactually dreaming that I was awoken out of my sleep telepathically from this alien who hadjust landed on a butte near us."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Facing east, this is a butte near Terry Jones's Badlands ranch. A year after seeingthe diamond light, Terry had an encounter in what she thinks was either a dream, or altered reality.\"In my dream, a reptilian man landed on a ridge at the left side of this butte.\"Photograph © 2007 by Terry Jones.He parked his craft on the butte and is actually hiking down to the ranch where I live tocontact me, personally. And he’s letting me know that he’s on his way and I can see himtelepathically hiking along this ridge that leads down to the ranch. I know I have to get upand go outside and hike out a little ways beyond the corral behind the house to meet withhim. I do, in my dream.Terry describes this photograph: \"The path the reptilian man walked down to the ranchdown in the trees you can see in the center distance. It was at the tree line that I met him. Theskyline in this picture is facing north, the direction the dancing lights and bigdiamond light would have been when we saw them fromthe ranch.\" Photograph © 2007 by Terry Jones.And I get out there and we shake hands. There is really no verbal communication going on,other than he says, ‘I just wanted to meet you.’ And he wants to shake my hand. Andinstantly there is this bond with this reptilian creature. I feel no threat from him. He’sreptilian to the degree that he’s green, scaly. I remember silver boots on his feet, tall silverboots. I remember he was wearing something else – either like a shield or armor orclothing. I can’t remember. But it was not part of his skin."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Terry Jones sketched the reptilian man and wrote: \"Over 6-feet-tall,very pleasant demeanor. Seem to remember ears, but not sure about eyes,except color was yellow. High cheekbones. Don't remember the hands, exceptthat he had gloves on. Long legs, skinny. Gloves and boots lighter than coloredhere, more silver than grey. Smooth, lighter-colored skin on inside of legs.\"COULD YOU SEE EYES, NOSE AND ALL OF THAT?There was something about him that was human, too. That was the really odd part of thedream – the humanness in him is what was putting me at ease. He had an inner strength,like a warrior’s strength about him, and a kindness at the same time. And I felt veryhonored and privileged that he even wanted to meet me. This was all in dreamland, youknow?AND HOW BIG WAS HE COMPARED TO YOU?He was very tall, well over 6 feet tall. I’d say 6 to 7 feet tall.WAS HE MORE MASSIVE IN HIS CHEST AND SHOULDERS?Yes, he was very muscular. I remember him being very – but he was slender, too. He hadvery long legs, very long arms. The arms were very beefy, but the legs were kind of longand skinny.CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE SCALES IN TERMS OF COLOR, SIZE AND WHAT THEYLOOKED LIKE?I just remember he was kind of mottled, multi-colored. Kind of aqua and kind of darkgreen.SO THERE WAS BLUE IN THERE AS WELL AS GREEN?Yeah, the aqua. It seemed like on his face, there was a definite small snout at the end of hisface that was light colored, lighter color than the rest of him.IF YOU WERE PICKING A REPTILIAN ON THE EARTH THAT YOU KNOW THATIS CLOSE TO WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE, WHAT WOULD THAT ANIMAL BE?I remember some spikes coming off of him somewhere, like the back of his head maybe,and down his spine.DO YOU THINK OF AN IGUANA, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Green Iguana (Iguana iguana), Jalapao Region, Brazilian Cerrado, Brazil.Photograph © by Laurie Vitt, Ph.D.Maybe like an iguana, yeah. But, I thought of a chameleon because I felt his color couldchange with the environment. He was pretty rough scaled. Very large scaled.SO WOULD IT BE LIKE A STANDING UP ALLIGATOR? Similar. But there was a lot human about him, too. Maybe he is what they call hybrid? Idon’t know.He was completely harmless – very gentle in nature, but he also had a very warrior-like –to have him as an ally or somebody who looked out after you would be a good thing.(laughs) That’s just how I felt about him.WHAT RESIDUE HAVE YOU HAD ABOUT WHY THE REPTILIAN IS THERE?Just to make contact. Nothing else.BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK THE RELATIONSHIP IS BETWEEN THE REPTILIANBEING AND THE NON-HUMANS YOU HAVE SENSED IN THE ZONES OF FEAR?I don’t really see a connection between them. I just know that those zones of fear and thealiens I feel are connected to them don’t have our best interests in mind.BUT THE REPTILIAN DOES?Yeah, does.WHEN YOU THINK OF THE ZONES OF FEAR, WHAT NON-HUMAN COMES TOMIND?The Greys, mostly, just little tiny Greys. Grey, little short ones.AND THAT COMES TO MIND BECAUSE YOU HAVE HAD INTERACTIONS WITHTHEM? OR YOU JUST SENSE THEM?No, I just sense them. Zone of Fear: Mental Impressionof Grey Non-HumansDO YOU GET IMAGES IN YOUR MIND?I have, yes. Definitely have, up in the mountains – very strongly once. I was in Idaho andworking for the Forest Service. For some reason, we had to drive pretty far up into themountain range to do some road surveying. I was on a road survey crew at that time. Therewas a road that went up there pretty close to one of the mountain peaks.And I can’t really explain it, but all I know is that this was Grey alien territory. That wasall I knew and we should not be there. And the only reason I knew it was Grey alienterritory was because I got a clear definite image in my mind of Grey aliens and shipslanding there and they did not want us there.THEY DID NOT WANT HUMANS THERE."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"No.WHERE EXACTLY WAS THAT? WHERE WERE YOU WORKING?That was in Targhee National Forest in Idaho.THAT’S ON THE BORDER OF?Right next to Yellowstone Park.NEAR WYOMING.Yes, and near Montana, kind of in that corner there.WHAT YEAR WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN?The mid-1980s.NOW WITH ALL THESE VARIOUS EXPERIENCES IN WYOMING, MONTANA,NORTH DAKOTA, ARIZONA IN WHICH YOU HAVE SENSED ZONES OF FEAR,ZONES OF ‘STAY OUT HUMANS’ - CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT YOU THINK ISBEHIND THOSE ZONES OF FEAR? WHAT EXACTLY WANTS TO KEEP HUMANSOUT?It’s just a hypothesis that they are on their own personal agenda and they don’t want us tobe a part of it and they don’t want us humans to be aware of what that is or where they’reat.YOU WOULD SAY IT IS THE LITTLE GREYS.Yeah. I’ve never really connected reptilians to any of that. I think the (reptilian) one I wasintroduced to through dream state is here probably for different reasons than the ones I’veconnected to those zones of fear.DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHAT COULD BE UNFOLDING IN THE FUTURE?Yeah (laughs), I do! I don’t know if people want to hear it. I think we have a lot to lookforward to, though. I think that was the message I was getting from this reptilian – thatthere is a lot of good, a lot of very powerful souls out there that are rooting for us as thehuman race and they are there to help us.And I’ve had a premonition about this butte where he landed his craft. Some day there willbe several smaller craft hovering over this butte. And at that time, there’s a definite energyshift in the air. That’s the only way I know I can describe it.Facing west toward the butte the reptilian landed on in Terry's dream,or altered reality, she writes: \"This is the same butte I have the premonition aboutseeing UFOs hovering over it in the future.\" Photograph © 2007 by Terry Jones.IN YOUR MIND’S EYE RIGHT NOW, CAN YOU THINK OF THE BUTTE AND SEETHE IMAGE THAT HAS COME INTO YOUR MIND OF CRAFT OVER THAT BUTTE?There are many craft.LIKE THE SKY IS FILLED WITH CRAFT?No, maybe just like maybe 25 or 30 in the air over this butte."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"AND WHAT ARE THEIR SHAPES?Saucers.THE SAUCERS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH WHICH TYPE OF NON-HUMAN?That’s the part I’m not sure of!
