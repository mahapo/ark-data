They’ve had a rough season,so there aren’t as many bees in the colonies as one would expect at this time of year.”- Jerry Hayes, Chief of Apiary Section, Florida Dept. of Agriculture Western honey bee, or European honey bee (Apis mellifera),gathering pollen from purple aster.September 26, 2007 Gainesville, Florida - The September 7, 2007, Science Expressreported the discovery of the \"Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV)\" in 96% of honey beesaffected by Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). [ See 090707 Earthfiles.] IAPV was firstidentified in Israel in 2002 to 2003 at the same time that Israeli beekeepers were strugglingto cope with Asian varroa mites as North American beekeepers have since the 1980s.But beginning in 2004, the American Department of Agriculture opened up honey beeimports into the United States for the first time in 83 years. What was imported most werehoney bees from Australia. Now it has been confirmed that Australian bees carry theIsraeli Acute Paralysis Virus without succumbing to it.With CCD seriously threatening to weaken North American bees to the point we won'thave enough for crop pollination, there have been recent Congressional discussions abouttemporarily banning the import of bees from Australia.Today I talked with Jerry Hayes, Chief of the Apiary Section in the Florida Department ofAgriculture, and President of the Apiary Inspectors of America in Gainesville, Florida. Iasked him why the Australian bees, which carry the Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus don't getsick.Interview:Jerry Hayes, Chief, Apiary Section, Florida Dept. of Agriculture, and President,Apiary Inspectors of America, Gainesville, Florida: “Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus(IAPV) has been found in 96% of the CCD bee body samples we looked at in the U. S. Itcame here from Australian bees. IAPV has also been found in Australia, but that country’sbees are not suffering from CCD. We think the reason is that Australia has not had theparasitic varroa mite that has infected North America. Varroa mites could be activating theIAPV virus in some way. So Australian bees might be stronger to begin with.THE PRESENCE OF VARROA MITES WEAKENS THE IMMUNE SYSTEMS OFHONEY BEES TO THE POINT THAT THE IAPV CAN ATTACK ALREADY-WEAKENED BEES?Yes, varroa is not a good thing in bees. It’s an introduced parasite from Asia and it has notevolved with our bees and that is why it’s so damaging to our North American bees. Try"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"this exercise. Make a fist and put it some place on your body. That is proportionately howbig a varroa mite is to a honey bee body. Then consider having three or four of thesethings on you. It would be like having parasitic rats on you. That would not be good foryour health.Varroa mites are about 1 millimeter longand suck blood from both adult honey bees and theirdeveloping brood.

FOR A WHILE?I know we have had some Congressmen support a temporary ban until we can figure thisout. APHIS - Agricultural Plant Health Inspection Service, Dept. of Agriculture – whoapproves all the imports of plants and animals. APHIS approved the importation ofAustralian bees in the first place in 2004. And yet it is APHIS who is now saying that sinceIAPV is here, why should we quarantine with a temporary ban of bees. So, it’s all still upin the air.WHAT DO YOU PERSONALLY THINK ABOUT THE LOGIC OF KEEPING THEAUSTRALIAN BEES OUT?We have the tantalizing clues that the IAPV virus is a marker for CCD. Nobody is saying itis a CAUSE of CCD, but it is found in bees with CCD symptoms. That’s why we’re callingit a marker.The bees from Australia have that viral marker. We were not allowing the importing ofbees for 83 years. Then all of a sudden, APHIS decides that we can bring things in withoutchecking them more thoroughly in 2004. And that’s the year – as we backtracked on thehistory of CCD – that’s when we started getting reports of CCD-like symptoms. So, thevirus might already be here, but do we want more re-infections is the question that has tobe asked?YOUR OPINION WOULD BE?Temporarily ban the Australian bees and let’s figure this out because after 83 years of notallowing imports of bees and then we bring something new in and we get a new disease.So, let’s use our heads here and go at this a little more slowly.IF THE AUSTRALIAN BEES ARE NOT KEPT OUT OF THE UNITED STATES BY ANEMBARGO, WILL THAT MAKE EVERYTHING WORSE FOR THE NORTHAMERICAN BEES BECAUSE OF RE-INFECTION?Probably, but we don't have enough research data to know so far. Virus Activation by Varroa Mites?IS ANYONE RIGHT NOW TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY THE AUSTRALIANBEES ARE NOT AFFECTED BY CCD LIKE THE AMERICAN AND CANADIANBEES ARE?The only difference between the Australian bees and ours is that Australia does not havethe varroa mite. Varroa has been shown in its feeding on larva and pupae that its feedingactivity activates viruses.There is another virus called the “deformed wing virus” that deforms the wings of bees asthey are developing and you can have a lot of this virus, which is normal in the bees, andthe viruses don’t do anything until they have contact with varroa and varroa activates the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"deforming virus and makes it reproduce and causes the deformed wing symptoms.The thought is then that perhaps varroa activates this IAPV virus, which might also becommon in Australian bees. But because they don’t have varroa, they don’t show anyparticular symptoms, such as CCD.ARE YOU ANY CLOSER TO FINDING ONE CAUSE FOR CCD?No, we all agree there appears to be many factors and we need more broad rangingresearch to see where specific combinations might cause CCD. The Israeli Acute ParalysisVirus is a marker for CCD, but not the single cause as far as we know now. American Honey Bees Are Still WeakWHAT IS THE HEALTH OF HONEY BEES IN THE U. S. RIGHT NOW?Beekeepers are starting to come back to Florida for the winter as they usually do fromtraveling around the country (pollinating crops). The bees in many cases are not in realgood shape. There could be several causes of that. This year, we had almost a nationwidedrought, which has affected bees so they did not have appropriate food and nectar andpollen from normally blooming plants because there wasn’t the moisture out there. It willbe interesting to see what happens as this fall and winter progress.WHEN YOU SAY THE BEES CURRENTLY ARE NOT IN GOOD SHAPE, WHATDOES THAT MEAN IN THE CONTEXT OF COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER?The bees are in a weakened state. They’ve had a rough season, so there aren’t as manybees in the colonies as one would expect at this time of year. Is it CCD related? The beesaren’t in good shape as they come back to Florida for the winter. Enough Pollinators for North America in 2008?WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO, THERE WAS A QUESTION INYOUR MIND ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE WOULD HAVE ENOUGHPOLLINATORS IN THE UNITED STATES FOR 2008?Yes, and that’s still a question in my mind. With the CCD losses of the past year and theway the bees are coming back to Florida in poor shape, will we have another dramatic lossthis fall and winter which will put us behind on pollinators available for agriculture.WE WON’T KNOW UNTIL WHAT MONTH?I would say probably December to January is the time we’ll know how many bees will bemaking it to almonds, which will be the next big crop for beekeepers.ARE YOU ABLE TO DO ANYTHING CONCRETE ON THE STATE LEVEL TO HELPHONEY BEES AND OTHER POLLINATORS REGARDLESS OF WHATWASHINGTON, D. C. IS DOING?When the Australian bees were first approved to be brought in to the U. S. in 2004 by theDepartment of Agriculture’s APHIS, I told APHIS I wanted to quarantine the bees inFlorida, let them establish themselves and then have my inspectors inspect the bees to seeif there is anything we should be concerned about. I was told that if I did so, I would beinterfering with international trade and that I would be sued. So, I dropped that one. Future of CCD in North America?WHAT IS CURRENT RESEARCH ON CCD?We’re analyzing samples, do a survey of what is out there such as the IAPV virus, Nosemaceranae (protozoan), the vorroa mite loads. We are sending sample kits out right now to 18states, 3 Canadian provinces and Bermuda to collect samples to analyze. We’re looking atnutrition, genetics, pesticides, and other data to look for a pattern.IF WE HAD NOT IN 2004 MADE A TRADE AGREEMENT TO ALLOWAUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND BEES INTO THE UNITED STATES, THEVARROA MITE LOAD IN NORTH AMERICAN BEES MIGHT NOT HAVE LEAD TOCOLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Absolutely.”More Information:For further reports about honey bee colony collapse disorder, please see reports below inthe Earthfiles Archive:• 09/07/2007 — Honey Bee DNA Study Finds Australian Virus in Colony Collapse Disorder• 06/28/2007 — Hackenberg Apiary, Pennsylvania - 75-80% Honey Bee Loss in 2007.
