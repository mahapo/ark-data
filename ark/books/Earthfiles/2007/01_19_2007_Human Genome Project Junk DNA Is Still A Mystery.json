January 18, 2007 Houston, Texas - The human body has about 100 trillion cells. Insideeach of those cells is the nucleus that contains the genome—46 human chromosomeswhich have the blueprint for building a human body.Every one of the 100 trillion cells in the human body has a blueprintabout how to build that body. Those \"genome\" instructions are laid out in3 billion \"letters\" on the 46 human chromosomes of DNA.

Those nucleotides are laid out likezeroes and ones in computer software, but are bunched in groups of genes and long,puzzling non-coding sections. Those non-coding sequences are referred to as \"junk DNA\"and make up a surprisingly large 97% of the genome, which no one understands.Each chromosome is one long string of DNA carrying genetic codeto build a human body.

National Institutes of Health formally created the project. Thegoal has been to identify all the genes in human DNA, the blueprint for a human body.Why the Dept. of Energy? Because since the creation of atomic bombs in the 1940s,scientists have tried to understand what radiation does to human bodies and whatmutations it causes in human DNA.After sixteen years and the hard work of 2,800 scientists around the world, there are someanswers and surprises.First, if you think of the human body as a book, then all of the pages and text together arethe genome. The word was coined from genes and chromosomes. The DNA in every cellcontains the whole book about how to make a human body.The “words” in each genome “book” are the genes. The Human Genome Project expectedto find at least 100,000 genes were necessary to create a human body. But one of the bigsurprises is the number of genes is only about 22,000, less than several other Earthcreatures, especially plants – which have as many as 40,000 genes.The main reason for the smaller number of genes than expected is that human genes arecapable of multi-tasking the production of proteins. You might say the human genomebook has a more advanced text, but it still takes 3 billion letters to write out those 22,000words.Now we come to the current main problem in the Human Genome Project: what is thepunctuation in a string of 3 billion letters? Scientists have learned some sentencefragments, but do not know full sentences. That could take at least another decade tofigure out how all those letters and words make our bodies work.Another big puzzle is that inside some of the 22,000 genome “words” are strings ofrepeating “letters.” Imagine seeing a hundred letter g's together and not having a clue whythey are there. Scientists call long strings of repeating letters “non-coding sequences,” or“junk DNA.” Strangely, there is a lot of junk DNA in the human DNA molecule.That’s why a January 11, 2007, Canadian blog by John Stokes and distributed on the webcaught my attention. The headline was: “Scientists find extraterrestrial genes in humanDNA.” Then the first paragraph stated: “A group of researchers working at the HumanGenome Project indicate that they made an astonishing scientific discovery: They believeso-called 97% non-coding sequences in human DNA is no less than genetic code ofextraterrestrial life forms.”[ Editor's Note: Scientists have long been puzzled by the fact that 97% of theDNA in human cells does not code for proteins and appears to consist ofmeaningless and repeating sequences. The possibility that this apparentlyuseless DNA has some as yet unknown function continues to tantalizescientists.See: F. Flam, \"Hints of a language in junk DNA,\" Science 266:1320, 1994.]"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"January 11, 2007, \"Canada's Progressive Blog.\"The Canadian blog says the name of the Human Genome Project “group leader”responsible for the discovery that junk DNA is genetic code of E.T.s is Prof. Sam Chang. Icould not find any Google listing for Prof. Sam Chang, so I decided to get a reality checkon the truth from John McPherson, Ph.D. Dr. McPherson is currently Associate Professorin the Dept. of Human and Molecular Genetics at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston,Texas. Over the past ten years, Dr. McPherson was also Co-Director of the GenomeCenter at Washington University in St. Louis. There, he was the lead scientist in thatuniversity’s efforts to map the human genome, as well as mouse and chicken genomes. Ibegan by asking him: What is junk DNA?Interview:John McPherson, Assoc. Professor, Dept. of Human and Molecular Genetics, BaylorCollege of Medicine, Houston, Texas, and former Co-Director of the Genome Center,Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri: “ That still remains to be seen. But it couldbe many different things. There are some of the DNA that we have termed ‘junk’ in thepast, which might have been essentially a virus that infected us and jumped around andmade copies of itself within our DNA. Then over time – because eventually over time thatwould destroy us – it was quieted down, but its remnants are still there. There aredefinitely pieces of DNA that are still mobile within our genome, but they are just veryquiet. You can activate these things artificially in cell culture, for example. You can getthem to jump all over the place. There are cases where diseases have been shown to becaused by one of these elements moving into a gene in an individual. It then getspropagated in their family and that causes the disease. So there are what we call mobileelements in the genome. Where they come from originally is a good question. But there isthe theory they are just basically viruses that came along and tagged along with us.Genomes are growing and expanding and some are decreasing. So, the junk DNA - rightnow it might have a role in that the spacing it puts in our genes might be required. Wedon’t really know.HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE BEFORE YOU REALLY DO KNOW?I don’t know. I mean, we certainly have some ideas of what things are doing, but I think inthe next ten years, we’ll have a better idea.IT WILL TAKE AN ENTIRE OTHER DECADE?I believe it will another decade to figure out much of the genome. Even then, there willstill be a lot of questions. But just even to come up with what we think are all the genesand how they interact with each other is at least another decade.WOW, THAT’S 2017!Yep. Getting the sequence was just the start. It really was. It took a long time to get it. Thatwas a 15-year-long project from the beginning. Not all sequencing was done in the last few"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"years, but it was all the preparation before that in learning how to do it. Now that we havethe (human genome) sequence, we have to figure out what it does. And that’s one of thereasons we’re sequencing lots of other genomes so we can compare them and bycomparing them, figure out what things do. So, there’s lots more to be done.IS THERE ANYTHING YOU’VE FOUND THAT WOULD FALL INTO THECATEGORY OF BAFFLING, UNEXPLAINED, IN THE SEQUENCING OF THEHUMAN GENES?I think the biggest thing that is baffling to me is how it all works. We have – it’s oftenreferred to as the ‘Parts List.’ We know the genes, we can look at them, but we still haveto figure out what they do. Just by looking at the sequence, we can’t – there are some wecan predict what it does, but there are many that we can’t. It’s still a big puzzle. It’s justlike an analogy might be a jigsaw puzzle where you’ve got all the pieces, but you don’thave the box that shows you what the picture is. And you have to put it together. Andfigure out what it all is. We’re sort of in that stage in many ways. There are some genes weknow a lot about, but there are many genes we have no idea what they do. So, that’s thebaffling part to me – there is still so much work to be done just to figure out how it allworks. Canadian Blog - Who Is Prof. Sam Chang?HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF A SCIENTIST NAMED PROF. SAM CHANG?Sam Chang. Not, it does not ring a bell.SO YOU PERSONALLY HAVE NOT WORKED WITH HIM ON THE GENOMEPROJECT? SAM CHANG?No, not that I’m aware of. There are a lot of people involved we never got to meet, but weonly met through emails. But that name does not ring a bell.IN THE CAPACITY YOU HAD IN ST. LOUIS AND TODAY, SHOULD YOU KNOWMOST OF THE MAIN PEOPLE?Most of the main characters, yes. Although it was very international and there were somelabs that we never got to go to or meet the people from. So, some of the names don’t stickin my head from back then.THE REASON I’M ASKING IS THAT I HAVE A JANUARY 11, 2007, CANADIANBLOG ABOUT A PROF. SAM CHANG SAYING THAT HUMAN JUNK DNA HASNOW BEEN PROVED BY THE HUMAN GENOME PROJECT TO BE FROM SOMEKIND OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL CODING.(laughs) Well, I’ve never heard of that! (laughs) I’ve never heard of that before and itcertainly does not sound very credible to me. But I haven’t seen the article. [ I give himthe URL.]I WONDER HOW THIS LONG ARTICLE WAS MADE UP?Actually I’m just looking on the web while I’m talking to you. If you do a search, there areall sorts of things pointing towards that.WHERE WOULD THIS INFORMATION AND NAME, PROF. SAM CHANG, COMEFROM?I don’t know. (laughs) I find it actually kind of funny. PanspermiaSINCE YOU ARE AN EXPERT IN GENETIC RESEARCH, CAN YOU AT LEASTCOMMENT ON THE POSSIBILITY THAT HOMO SAPIENS SAPIENS MIGHT HAVEBEEN SEEDED BY LIFE FROM SOME PLACE ELSE AND IT MIGHT SHOW UP INSOME WAY IN OUR HUMAN GENOME SEQUENCING PROJECT?Well, as far as I know, there is no evidence to support that. So, this is all news tome. CRICK AND WATSON WON THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR DESCRIBING THE DOUBLEHELIX DNA MOLECULE – AT LEAST 50 YEARS AGO?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"1953, I think.Francis Crick shows James Watson the double helix model of DNAthat they started building on March 4, 1953, and finished in the evening of March 7, 1953,in their Austin Wing room at the Cavendish Laboratories, Cambridge, England.I KNOW THERE WAS A PAPER CRICK PUBLISHED IN ICARUS WITHBIOCHEMIST, LESLIE ORGEL. THEIR HYPOTHESIS WAS THAT BECAUSE THEREIS THE SAME SPIRAL DNA MOLECULE IN ALL LIFE ON EARTH - WHICH THESCIENTISTS DID NOT THINK COULD HAPPEN ACCIDENTALLY - THEN ITMEANT PANSPERMIA, THE ACT OF SEEDING DNA ON THIS PLANET FROMOUTSIDE HAD TO HAVE BEEN OUR ORIGIN.[ Editor's Note: \"Directed Panspermia,\" Icarus, International Journal ofSolar System Studies, Vol. 19, No. 3, July 1973 by F. H.C. Crick and L. E.Orgel,© 1973 Academic Press, Inc.]Right, I’ve seen theories like that where people believe that DNA or bacteria or somethingcame to Earth on an asteroid or what have you and that DNA and RNA weren’t formed inthe bubbling oceans of the world. Anything is possible because they are all theories at thispoint. We don’t know for sure where things came from, so it is possible that the first DNAcame to the world from outside and then evolved. Whether you want to bring up religiousarguments, I think that’s fine, too. They can all in a way fit into the same arguments. Youcould say the first DNA was seeded by God. Or you can say it came from anextraterrestrial source? Who knows?WOULD YOU AGREE WITH ORGELL, CRICK AND THAT GROUP THAT IT ISIMPOSSIBLE ALL EARTH LIFE WOULD HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME DNA?It’s an interesting observation. You might think if it was all coming from the primordialsoup, so to speak, that there might be different sources that came up with different ways ofdoing (life). There are, for example, RNA viruses which have only RNA and don’t haveany DNA. So, some of the theories re that the RNA came first and the DNA evolved later.I don’t know. It might be that it’s such a rare event for it to happen at all that it(panspermia event) did seed everything. I think any theory is just as likely as the next atthis point in time.WOULD YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY WAY OF IDENTIFYINGSOMETHING THAT WAS INTRODUCED IN THE GENE SEQUENCE THAT WOULDSEEM HIGHLY ARTIFICIAL TO YOU, SUCH AS EXTRATERRESTRIALPROGRAMMING, COMPARED TO THE REST OF HUMAN GENOMESEQUENCING?Probably not. If you look hard enough, you’ll find patterns in anything and depending onhow you want to interpret them. For example, there’s lots of articles by people who say ifyou take every 5th letter of every 3rd word of the Bible, you spell out this or that. Genesare the same sort of thing. If you look at patterns long enough and find different ways oflooking at them, you will eventually find something by chance.So, whether we would recognize something, I don’t think we would be able to recognize it(E. T. genetic manipulation) as being anything out of the ordinary. We can certainlyrecognize patterns within the DNA. But what maybe we don’t understand yet what theydo and they might be involved in the structure of the DNA and how it is all compacted intoeach cell. We just don’t know that yet."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT EVEN IF HOMO SAPIENS SAPIENS WA S T H EPRODUCT OF SOME KIND OF SEEDING AND THEN GENETIC MANIPULATIONBY OTHER THAN HUMAN INTELLIGENCES, THAT HUMANS WOULD NEVER BEABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE CURRENT DNA THAT THEY ARE AND IT HAVING BEEN MANIPULATED BY ANOTHER INTELLIGENCE?It would be unlikely to have, to be certain, that’s for sure. I think you could look at a lot ofpatterns and come up with a lot of things, but I think someone else can look at it just alittle different way and see something different. I think people will see what they want tosee in the patterns. No Sexual Link BetweenNeanderthalis and Homo SapiensTHIS COMES TO THE WORK OF PABLO SVANTE, WHO HAS BEEN ANALYZINGAN ELBOW THAT WAS FOUND IN A GERMAN CAVE. THEY THINK THE CAVEWENT BACK TO THE END OF NEANDERTHALIS ABOUT 40,000 YEARS OLD?Right.IF THERE ARE AT LEAST 19 MAJOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GENOMESEQUENCING ON THE NEANDERTHALIS BONE COMPARED TO MODERN HOMOSAPIENS SAPIENS. THE CONCLUSION WAS THAT THERE COULD NOT HAVEBEEN SEXUAL INTERCOURSE BETWEEN NEANDERTHALIS AND CRO MAGNONHOMO SAPIENS SAPIENS.I don’t know – there are certainly more differences than nineteen. It’s very difficultsequencing because most of the samples are contaminated with modern DNA. So, it’sdifficult to sort out the Neanderthal sequences from the modern human. But there are afew samples that are supposedly uncontaminated. But DNA is not stable, either. Over timeit changes. So, the other problem you have is determining which changes are real andwhich are things that have happened to the DNA over time. So, the DNA degrades in sucha way that bases change. So, when we sequence them, we see a different base there thanwas actually there at the time. And there are ways to estimate that error rate based onother things in the bone.But you still have to apply the rate of change to what you are seeing and come up withsome conjecture of the number of errors, or differences, that are there. So, I think it is stillvery early on to be analyzing that data to make any statements whatsoever about it.IF THERE WERE NO SEXUAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE NEANDERTHALISLINE AND HOMO SAPIENS SAPIENS THAT CAME LATER, WHERE DID CROMAGNON HOMO SAPIENS SAPIENS COME FROM?Well, they didn’t have to breed together to diverge, right? I mean they could begeographically isolated offshoot in evolution, which evolved independently. I mean, if weall evolved throughout time out of Africa, there could definitely be groups that weregeographically isolated and have evolved independently.BACK TO THE ORGELL/CRICK PANSPERMIA HYPOTHESIS, IF THERE WASMANIPULATION OF DNA IN ALREADY-EVOLVING PRIMATES ON THE PLANET,THEN IT’S POSSIBLE THAT HOMO SAPIENS OR NEANDERTHALIS OR EVENHOMO ERECTUS COULD HAVE BEEN THE PRODUCT OF SOME KIND OFGENETIC TAMPERING?I don’t believe that. If you look at all over the planet, there are species of birds, forexample, that are clearly related, but cannot inter-breed. How did they all becomedifferent? Well, they became different because they were isolated in different areas andthey started to evolve and adapt to the local environment, so the beak changed so somecould eat certain things. And then, as they changed and evolved, the chromosomeschanged enough that they could no longer interbreed. But they are all very, very relatedand can be connected back to some progenitor bird. So, the fact that they are differentdoesn’t mean that anyone manipulated them, they just changed over time. No Way to Prove GeneticManipulation of Already-Evolving Primates by E. T.s?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"SO THE BOTTOM LINE TO ALL OF THIS IS: EVEN IF THERE WERE ANEXTRATERRESTRIAL MANIPULATION OR SEEDING OF DNA ON THIS PLANETOR OTHER PLANETS, OUR CURRENT LIFE FORM RIGHT NOW – HUMANS –WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO PROVE IT?I would think probably that we could not prove it. It would be very difficult for us to provethat. It’s very difficult to prove anything in the past, right? All you can do is look at theevidence and come up with a theory. But proof is something that you can just come upwith the facts based on the current data and you can formulate a theory. And a theory issomething that’s not just a wild story. It’s something that is sort of accepted to be whathappened in the past, or what will happen in the future, based on what scientists believe.So, it’s sort of the accepted, current knowledge. But to actually prove something isextremely difficult. Surprisingly Few Genes Needed to Make HumansAN M.I.T. HEADLINE IN 2004 WAS ‘THE NUMBER OF GENES IN THE HUMANGENOME IS LOWER THAN PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED’ – CONSIDERABLYLOWER. COULD YOU ELABORATE AND EXPLAIN THIS?When we started sequencing the genome, the prediction was that there would be 100,000human genes. That prediction was based largely on the few genes that had beensequenced. Their size was around 30,000 base pairs. Since the human genome was 3billion base pairs, just doing the math, it seemed that if the average gene was 30,000 basepairs, then there would be 100,000 genes (in a human). I think that is sort of a simplisticview of where that 100,000 number came from.Of the things that had been sequenced at the time, a worm was being sequenced and itlooked like 20,000 genes in it. So, it seemed reasonable – maybe it was part of ourarrogance – that we thought there should be 100,000 human genes.But in the end, when we sequenced the human genome, it turned out to be – and it’s still adebatable point actually how many genes there are (in humans) – but there are maybesomething like 22,000 human genes. The difference is not the number of genes, but thecomplexity of the genes that has more to do with the complexity of the organism.IF I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU JUST SAID, YOU MEAN IF HUMANS HAVE 22,000GENES AND OTHER CREATURES MIGHT HAVE 30,000 GENES OR MORE, THENOUR GENE SEQUENCING IS MORE COMPLEX?In human genes, one gene tends to make multiple proteins, whereas a lot of things like theworm it's one gene makes one protein. Our human genes make at least two proteins onaverage. Some genes make many, many proteins. It’s called ‘differential splicing’ and it’s away of mixing and matching parts within that gene to make a different protein for adifferent function. So human genes get more complexity out of the genes that we havethan something like a worm.IS THERE OTHER EARTH LIFE THAT IS SIMILAR TO OUR GENE SEQUENCING INCOMPLEXITY?In complexity – yes. We have sequenced some of the primates such as chimpanzee andmacaque and they have very similar genomes to our own - and almost any mammaliangenome, including cows, which have been sequenced. All of those genomes have roughlyabout the same number of genes as humans.I think the largest numbers of genes have been in plants actually. Some plants have 40,000genes and some of that is that plants tend to be chemical factories. They produce a lot ofcompounds to protect themselves from insects since they can’t run away like we can. Theyare stuck in one spot and so they have lot of chemical synthesis machinery. That mightaccount for a lot of the genes that they have.WHICH IS CLOSEST OTHER EARTH LIFE TO HOMO SAPIENS?Chimpanzee, but we haven’t finished sequencing all the other primates yet, though. Looking for Disease Causes in GenesWHAT IS CURRENT FOCUS OF YOUR WORK RIGHT NOW?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Right now we are using the information we have to go in and sequence genes withinindividuals looking for the cause of disease – we’re looking for differences in the genes(compared), which might then be related to the diseases that we’re studying.COULD YOU GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING WE WOULD ALL KNOW ANDHOW THIS WORK HAS APPLIED?We have a number of projects going on: epilepsy, obesity, many others. We’re looking atcancer as well. The idea is that we pretty well know what a normal gene looks like bydoing the human sequencing, so we’re looking now for variations on those genes whichmight be associated with disease.IS THERE A PARTICULAR DISEASE LINK THAT YOU THINK IS ABSOLUTELYFIRM THAT MIGHT BE A DISEASE WE WOULD BE SURPRISED ABOUT?I’m always surprised. I’m surprised every day by things that we see. I don’t know aboutsurprises – what we’re finding, I think, and it’s early days – but many of the diseaseswe’ve known about in the past like cystic fibrosis – there was a very definite change in thegene that we could associate with the disease. Now, what we’re looking at are what wecall complex disorders where it may be subtle variations in a number of genes, which alladd up to give you the disease. In the subtle variations, you may find that someone withoutthe disease have some of those. But having all of them together is what gives the disease.So it can be very difficult to tease it out.That’s why we are sequencing lots of diseases in a lot of people looking for theseassociations where a change in this gene is not enough to give you the disease, but achange in Gene 1 plus the change in Gene 2 plus the change in Gene 3 all add up to giveyou the disease.I think the surprising thing is that what we are seeing is how much variations there are inall the genes in all of us. But it depends on how they mix and match whether you get heartdisease or other.”More Information:For further information about human genetic history, please see the Earthfiles Archivesbelow:• 12/14/2006 -- Abductee Jim Sparks's Encounter with Reptillian Beings, Their Warning and Possible Agenda• 10/11/2006 -- Part 2: Time Travel, Insights from USAF Sergeant and UFO Abductee• 10/08/2006 -- Part 1: Time Travel, Insights from USAF Sergeant and UFO Abductee• 09/29/2006 -- Manipulation of Time and Matter by Non-Humans: The Experiences of Jim Sparks• 05/12/2006 -- An Extraterrestrial School for Humans• 10/10/2004 -- Part 1: Texas Case of Shape-Shifting Human-to-Reptilian• 02/25/2003 -- Part 2 - Corguinho, Brazil: Inside the Non-Human Craft from September 15 - 18, 2002• 01/11/2003 -- Part 4: Tall, Red-Haired Extraterrestrials - The Abduction and \"Transformation\" of BrianScottWebsites:National Human Genome Research Institute: http://www.genome.gov/Dept. of Energy: http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/home.shtmlNat'l.
