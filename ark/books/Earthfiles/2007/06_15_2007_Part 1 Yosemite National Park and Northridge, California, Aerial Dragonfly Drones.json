June 15, 2007 Canoga Park, California - Since the first week of May, seven people inCalifornia, one in Birmingham, Alabama, and another from Louisiana – for a total of 9 -have reported seeing a dragonfly-shaped aerial object in the sky that has a ring body, a longtail and variations of appendages extending from the ring.Four of those seven California eyewitnesses have provided photographs toUFOcasebook.com and Coast to Coast AM.com.

Lex and I talked about the photographs and Lexagreed to see if Chad would communicate with me. He did in a series of emails, whichstressed his anxiety about his pregnant wife and worries about whether the strange aerialcraft was emitting radiation that could harm her and their unborn child. Based on Chad’sdescription of a humming static sound, I emailed to him that was more characteristic ofelectrostatic discharges and not radiation. Because of all the controversy his photographsprovoked about whether they were Photoshopped or not and his insistence the photographswere taken with his camera. The aerial object, Chad wrote, kept returning to the area oftheir rural home. Chad was nervous and emailed me that he was going to travel away fromit all with his wife for awhile.Then on May 16, 2007, in Capitola, California, east of Santa Cruz on Monterey Bay,another series of six clear images were allegedly taken by someone calling himself“rajman1977” and submitted to flickr.com.

She agreed to a taped interview, provided I protecther full name and location.After the Shirley interview was made public at my news website, Earthfiles.com and inbroadcasts for Dreamland and Coast to Coast AM, I received emails from two moreeyewitnesses. The first was a military subcontractor working in the southeast, who alsorequested anonymity, but wanted me to see a photograph he had taken in May 2006 inBirmingham, Alabama.Odd, aerial object above power poles near construction sitein May 2006, in Birmingham, Alabama.

There were no"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"answers and Mr. Smith returned to the power pole to see if the dragonfly-shaped aerialobject was still there. But it was gone. Mr. Smith gave me permission to show hisphotograph of the May 2006 Birmingham, Alabama, dragonfly object at Earthfiles.Right after Mr. Smith’s photograph was public, I received another email from aprofessional engineer who also requested anonymity. The engineer wrote that he had seena strange craft very similar to what Mr. Smith photographed. But the year was around 1987and the location was inside an airplane hangar at Barksdale AFB in Louisiana. He wasattending an air show, was touring various displays, and wondered what the approximately25-foot-long, dragonfly-shaped craft was. But before he and others on the tour could askquestions, men in military uniforms showed up and ordered the tour out of the hangarsaying a mistake had been made. That hangar was for military personnel only, not the airshow tour.The engineer emailed to me the following comment included at Earthfiles.com: “I don'tremember what the thing was called, but it was some kind of surveillance or intelligence-gathering drone. I didn't see why they thought they had to run us out of the hangar, but, ofcourse, I respected their notion of 'security.' I didn't see what the big deal was about somefunny-looking ring-gadget with a 'wing.'” Then on May 23, 2007, I received another important email - including a sketch of adragonfly-shaped aerial object - from a California mother who had been camping with hertwo sons in Yosemite National Park a year ago. She asked for anonymity, but wanted me toknow that on the night of June 10, 2006:“It was about a half hour before sundown and we were about 10 minutes fromour camp site looking for marshmallow roasting sticks. We first noticed this'thing' almost directly above us, not much higher than the tops of the trees. Itlooked just like the sketch, despite my lack of drawing skill, and was movingextremely slowly. The way it moved looked like it didn’t take any effort. Asyou can see in my sketch, it was like two very long, thin shapes connected bya ring."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Sketch of dragonfly-shaped aerial object seen by motherand two sons on June 10, 2006 in Yosemite National Park, California.Aerial object stopped for several seconds in mid-airw hen boys flashed light at \"drone.\"The arms looked just like the photos you posted although I don't rememberseeing any of the lettering. It was getting pretty dark, though, so I'm not goingto say it wasn't there. I just don't remember seeing anything like that. Comingoff the top of the ring were those same curved spike things like in the Chadand other photos. However, unlike the other photographs, the thing my sonsand I saw also had a kind of 'arm' that reached down from the ring as well. Ihave no idea what any of these features were for, as I never saw it 'do'anything other than fly around.My oldest, who is 10, decided to shine his powerful flashlight on it to get abetter look. I didn't even have a chance to react to what he was doing whenthings got weird - it was like the moment the flashlight light hit the thing, itjerked very quickly and started to move in another direction. The boys foundthis amusing to say the least. They chased after it and hit it with the light again,which caused the thing to change direction a second time. I ran to keep upwith them.The boys did this maybe three or four more times until the thing finallystopped reacting to them and just - stopped. Like, literally froze in the airwithout even slowing down. I must say, seeing this thing totally motionless wasa lot more unsettling than seeing it move. Even the boys stopped in their tracksat that point. It just hung there for about 5 seconds, and then got going again.From then on it stuck to its direction (still moving very slowly) and no longerjerked around. You could say that this thing moved like the other reportswhere people said it was like a \"water insect.\" But in our case it only seemedto do this in reaction to the flashlights, not on its own.”About the same time that I received the email about the Yosemite experience, I received anemail from a professional California hypnotherapist and Doctor of Divinity, who describeda May 2006 encounter in Northridge, California, with an aerial object that he compared to"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"a horseshoe crab with a long tail seen in profile.

I would say it was a UFO. But you could count no more than the count ofthree – like one, two, three – and this thing streaked forward maybe about five feet andthen disappeared. For me, it was a clear sky. There was nothing above that tree! The starswere out and we could see them clearly when all of a sudden this thing was there above thetree.

The date is July 2, a year or two after Ronald Reagan became presidentin January 1981."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"President Ronald Reagan awarded physicist Edward Teller, Ph.D.,the National Medal of Science in 1983.Image courtesy Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.[ Editor's Note: The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) was proposed by U.S.President Ronald Reagan on March 23, 1983, to use ground-based andspace-based systems to protect the United States from attack by strategicnuclear ballistic missiles. The initiative focused on strategic defense ratherthan the prior strategic offense doctrine of mutual assured destruction (MAD).The research and technologies of SDI paved the way for some anti-ballisticmissile systems of today. The Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO)was set up in 1984 within the United States Department of Defense for theStrategic Defense Initiative. It gained the popular name \"Star Wars\" after thetitle of the 1977 George Lucas feature film, the first in a series. Under theadministration of President Bill Clinton in 1993, SDI was changed to theBallistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) and its emphasis was shiftedfrom national missile defense to theater missile defense; from global toregional coverage. BMDO was later renamed Missile Defense Agency(MDA).]Edward Teller’s memorandum to President Reagan begins with a warning: \"I wish to bringto your attention a very real and dangerous situation that threatens not only us, the world,but our very existence as a race. ...A menace greater than the nuclear arms race exists. Itdoes not originate here on earth, but comes from space itself. The agent of mass destructionhas no reasoning psychology other than the ultimate destruction of our civilization and ourway of life as we know it.\" The fact that the outer space threat is not defined more in thisremarkable, alleged government document, implies that President Reagan had already beenbriefed about the \"menace.\""},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"See below full text of alleged Teller memo to Pres. Ronald Reagan,dated July 2, between 1981 and 1983.In his memo, Dr. Teller outlines defense systems he thought necessary to cope with theouter space menace. On Page 4 of his memorandum to President Reagan, he wrote:“Remotely piloted vehicles (RPVs) have been developed and tested withmarginal success. The possibility of RPVs exist for the enemy as well as for us.The use of RPVs was first explored by the U. S. Air Force. It can also beapplied to small space objects. An ingenious new circular airfoil design is nowin experimental stage. A single wing is used in this design. Another design isalso under development. This other one uses a single wing as well, pivoting atits center at the fuselage. The wing is at right angles to the plane at takeoff andlanding, but as the right wing points forward while the left points backward.”At the bottom of the memo there are two check off boxes labeled Yes or No, next to thetwo words: “Presidential Approval.” On the memo copy I have, there is no indication ofPresident Reagan’s answer. But the Star Wars Strategic Defense Initiative program wasapproved in 1984 under the direction of physicist Edward Teller – and remotely piloteddrones built around a “new circular airfoil design” with a single wing pivoting at the centerwere on his priority list. ontinued in Part 2 - Full Text of Alleged Edward Teller Memo to Pres.
