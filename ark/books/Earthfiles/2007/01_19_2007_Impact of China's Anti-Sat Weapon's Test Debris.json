I would be surprised if it was bad enough to cause thedestruction of many satellites.\" - Jonathan McDowell, Ph.D., Harvard AstrophysicistIllustration of aging FengYun-1 weather satellite destroyed January 11, 2007,in Chinese anti-satellite weapon test, courtesy Earth Observation Resources.January 19, 2007 Cambridge, Massachusetts - Craig Covault in Aviation Week &Space Technology online reported January 17, 2007, that \"U. S. intelligence agenciesbelieve China performed a successful anti-satellite (asat) weapons test at more than 500miles altitude (new estimate is 530 miles up) on January 11, 2007, destroying an agingChinese weather satellite target with a kinetic kill vehicle launched on board a ballisticmissile.\"The Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the Defense IntelligenceAgency, NASA and other government organizations have a full court press underway toobtain data on the alleged test. If the test is verified it will signify a major new Chinesemilitary capability.\" Previously, only the U. S. in the mid-1980s and Russia hadsuccessfully performed anti-satellite weapons tests.In 1986, Jonathan McDowell graduated from Cambridge University in England with aPh.D.-equivalent in Astrophysics. He has worked as a staff astrophysicist at HarvardUniversity's Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, since1992. In addition to his university work, he has become a space historian keeping logs onas many satellite launches from all countries as he can. In the process he has expressedconcern as a scientist against the weaponization of space, which Dr. McDowell sees as avery de-stabilizing path for this planet.On January 17, 2007, he began receiving phone calls at his Harvard office about an allegedanti-satellite weapons test by the Chinese at 10:30 p.M. Greenich Mean Time on January11. He was surprised by the news because until now, the last publicly known anti-satelliteweapons tests were carried out by the United States in 1986 during the \"Star Wars\" era.Further, he was stunned to learn that the debris field after the missile attack extended from100 miles to 2,000 miles above the Earth - essentially the entire satellite and InternationalSpace Station orbiting territory. The energy of the device that hit the Chinese weathersatellite had to be enormous and hit from the side. The accuracy of the guidance system tomake such an accurate hit at 530 miles above the Earth says the Chinese technology is atleast on par with the United States and Russia. So far, China authorities have neitherconfirmed nor denied their weather satellite's destruction by an anti-satellite weapon.Interview:Jonathan McDowell, Ph.D., Astrophysicist, Harvard Smithsonian Center forAstrophysics, Cambridge, Massachusetts: \"We've had twenty years of restraints, whichthis Chinese test has ended. My concern now is that this Chinese test will provide a triggerto move the United States and other countries to develop more anti-satellite weaponssystems.The event happened over South China. Their (weather) satellite happened to be over SouthChina at the time. U. S. administration officials off-the-record have stated that we detecteda medium range ballistic launched which could have caused this explosion on January 11,at about 10:30 p.m. Greenich Mean Time."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"WHY WOULDN’T CHINA JUST SIMPLY GO ON THE RECORD ABOUT WHAT’SHAPPENING BECAUSE THEY ARE BECOMING SUCH A MAJOR WORLDPLAYER?Well, that’s an interesting question and that I haven’t figured out. My best guess is that thecivilian authorities in charge of making statements are not necessarily cleared to knowwhat the Chinese military is doing. We found this in the old Soviet Union a number oftimes – the official spokesperson would make some confident statement that they trulybelieved and then a few months later, they would have to backtrack when they wereactually cleared to know what their military had actually done.So, I don’t put much weight on the fact that the Chinese have neither confirmed nordenied the satellite destruction.COULD YOU COMMENT IN THAT CONTEXT ABOUT THE ACCURACY THAT THISTEST INDICATES ABOUT CHINESE TECHNOLOGY?It’s impressive. We knew their rocket technology was good. We didn’t know theirguidance technology was this good. So, the trick in pulling this test off was not just to get arocket to the right height, but to know exactly where that satellite was going to be. To beable to guide the nose cone of their rocket to exactly the right place at the right time to hitthe satellite.It’s something that even our own American tests, if you have followed the sub-orbitalanti-missile tests that have happened in the Pacific over the past few years, we’ve hadsome embarrassing failures, as well as some successes. So, this is not a trivial thing to dothat guidance. It’s a lot easier, I might add, when your target satellite is your own satellite,so you can have it transmit a signal that says, ‘Here I am! Here I am!’It’s a lot harder to do this against an uncooperative satellite that belongs to someone else.That’s the one caveat I would say about the level of capability the Chinese have shown –you don’t know whether the Chinese made use of looking up the answer in the back oftheir own weather satellite to help them. Until you know if they did that, or made use ofany of that information, and just pretended it was someone else’s satellite – that makes thedifference in how convincing a capability it is. Weather Satellite Exploded In All DirectionsDID THE MISSILE HIT THE SATELLITE FROM BEHIND?It came from the side, but imparted a lot of energy that was somehow – and this is what Ipersonally don’t understand about the physics of this collision. It basically addedmomentum in all directions. So, the energy of the explosion in the disintegration of thesatellite was randomized in the collision. It put a lot of energy into this satellite and piecescame flying off in all directions, but with enough speed to change the orbit of those pieces.WHAT WOULD YOU SPECULATE COULD CAUSE THAT?You have a fairly large missile with a lot of kinetic energy hitting the satellite. Then theamount of energy needed to create what you see is certainly there. Then the details of howthat energy gets changed into the exact form of the disintegration of the satellite is notsomething I have thought through. \"Hitting Brick with A Brick At High Speed\"BUT THE STRONG DEBRIS FIELD IMMEDIATELY SAYS THAT THEY WERE SOACCURATE THAT THEY HIT THE WHOLE SATELLITE WITH A LOT OF ENERGY?Right. This new generation of anti-satellite weapons – the idea is that they don’t have abomb onboard. There is no explosive involved. It’s just that you are hitting the target at18,000 mph. A head on direct collision is not good!SO THIS MISSILE DID NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR OR EXPLOSIVE WARHEAD?That is correct. It certainly did not have a nuclear warhead and it probably did not have anexplosive warhead.WHY WOULD THAT BE?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The energy from an explosion – suppose you put a ton of high explosive in this warhead.The energy released by a ton of high explosive is much less than the energy of just hittingsomething at 18,000 mph, right? So, you add maybe 10% by putting a high explosiveonboard. Why bother?So if you have the clever guidance system that lets your non-explosive missile hit thetarget, then there is no advantage to adding high explosives. There is more energy in racingdown the freeway and smashing into something.Nuclear Anti-Satellite Warheads Would “Wipe Out Half the Satellites in Earth Orbit”YOU DON’T NEED TO ADD THAT WEIGHT TO YOUR MISSILE.Right. Now, a nuclear warhead is a different matter. But with a nuclear warhead, whathappens is you pretty much wipe out half the satellites in Earth orbit. The electromagneticpulse from a nuclear explosion will zap everything. You’ll create a new radiation beltaround the Earth. The U. S. did that in 1962. The U. S. exploded a nuke at 500 miles highand it created a new radiation belt that lasted for five years (until 1967), it took out all thelights in Hawaii for a day. It was a very major event. That’s not something you do to takeout one satellite. That’s something you do to really start a war. It’s not a good plan for ananti-satellite weapon.So, hitting a brick with a brick at very high speeds is still one better way to do it, but it’sstill very bad because it creates all this debris. Some of the military in the U. S. have beenthinking up more clever, but more benign ways to be space warriors like sidling slowly upto your target satellite and spraying its cameras with black paint. Stuff like that whichwould disable the satellite without creating hundreds of pieces of debris which is not onlybad for your enemy, it’s bad for you because you want to use your satellites in space.WHAT YOU HAVE JUST OUTLINED IS THAT IT WOULD BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLEFOR ANY RATIONAL COUNTRY TO DO ANYTHING THAT WOULD EXPLODE INSATELLITE ORBITING TERRITORY BECAUSE THEY WOULD END UPDAMAGING THEIR OWN SATELLITES?That’s right. The only thing that’s been suggested is a Third World player like Iraq beforethe invasion, which did not use space for its own purposes and would be happy to makespace inaccessible to everybody else. North Korea is another possibility. 300,000 Debris Pieces Now Orbitingwith World's Satellites and ISSTODAY THERE ARE REPORTS THAT COMPUTER MODELERS ESTIMATE 300,000PIECES OF DEBRIS RESULTED FROM THE WEATHER SATELLITE'SDESTRUCTION.Right. Obviously it’s a matter of choice how small a piece you count in your computermodels. I think recent computer model standards have improved and they probably justrun it and it goes down to a particular size and down to that size, the answer is 300,000.It’s kind of a wild guess.I would say, even down to that size, the real objects could be 100,000 or 500,000. It’s nota very accurate calculation (computer models). But certainly we will see many hundreds,perhaps even a couple thousand, pieces of debris that are an inch or so across that wouldbe very damaging to any satellite that they hit.DO YOU THINK CHINA MIGHT BE QUIET BECAUSE THEY ARE EMBARRASSEDTHAT THEY CREATED SO MUCH DAMAGE?That’s possible. I doubt it. But it may be that something happened they didn’t expect orthey created more damage than they expected and they are still assessing how to spin that.Destroyed Satellite Debris Now OrbitingBetween 100 to 2000 Miles Above EarthThe interesting thing that I haven’t seen discussed in the media yet is that the U. S. SpaceCommand has released data for the first 32 (debris objects). Of those 32, what is surprisingabout them is that they are at a very wide range of heights. So, the original weather"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"satellite was about 500 miles high (850 kilometers). The debris cloud we are seeing rangesall the way from 100 miles, just skimming the atmosphere, to 2,000 miles high. So, itcovers the entire range of what we call low Earth orbit – including the range where theastronauts on the International Space Station are orbiting, including the range in which theHubble Space Telescope is orbiting; and where a lot of the low orbit weather satellites are.Adding a significant amount of debris to that altitude range – and I haven’t done thedetailed calculations – but it corresponds to an increase in the amount of debris at thatheight of anything from 25% to a factor of 2. At the higher altitudes, the debris will stay upfor decades at least.There was an anti-satellite test the U. S. did in 1985 and the last piece of debris from thattest re-entered in 1999, almost fifteen years later.WHY WOULD THERE BE SUCH A WIDE DEGREE OF SPACE DEBRISDISTRIBUTION?It’s partly to do with the angle in which the satellite was hit and the energy of the collision.Depending upon the amount of kinetic energy and momentum that you add to the satelliteas it disintegrates, you can predict how high an orbit is going to end up.So, what happens if you have a satellite in an orbit that’s 500 kilometers circular, if youadd a couple hundred miles an hour to its speed by kicking it in the rear, that changes itsorbit to a low point of 500 kilometers and a high point of 2,000 kilometers.If you kick it in the face at a couple hundred miles per hour, that slows down the highpoint, so it ends up in an orbit where the high point is still 500, but the low point is only100.It all has to do with the orbital mechanics of how these things go. The low and high pointsof your orbit are determined by how high you start off and how fast you are going. So, ifyou change how fast you are going, you end up in a different orbit.WHAT ABOUT THOSE 32 PIECES THAT HAVE BEEN OFFICIALLYACKNOWLEDGED BY SPACE COMMAND? WHAT SIZES WERE THEY?We don’t know yet. They will be at least a few inches across. My guess is because the firstfew they catalogued are probably the bigger ones, so they might be even a foot across orso. But we don’t know that yet. Things are changing very quickly in this story. And whatwe’ll see over the next couple of weeks – what happens is that after this happened, theUSAF radars were littered with many, many little radar tracks of many pieces. It’s notinitially obvious that this track over here is the same or different track of that one overthere, or here or wherever.So, that’s why it takes several weeks to put together the jigsaw puzzle of how many piecesthey are actually tracking. You might think it’s a new one, but it’s the one you sawyesterday and you just didn’t calculate its orbit quite right. So, they had to put it alltogether. What you will typically see over the next few weeks is that maybe a week fromnow, they will catalogue another hundred and then two weeks after that, they willcatalogue another 100. Eventually, they’ll catalogue all the ones that are bigger than a fewinches across. Any Other Satellites Yet Threated by Satellite Debris?YOU AND I ARE SPEAKING ON JANUARY 19, 2007, WHICH IS EIGHT DAYSAFTER THE INITIAL EXPLOSION. HAS THERE BEEN ANY REPORT, OFFICIALLYOR UNOFFICIALLY, OF ANY KIND OF DAMAGE TO ANY SATELLITES SO FAR?Not as far as I’m aware. And I wouldn’t expect there to be. The risk is not immediate.Remember, that even though you’re talking about a lot of debris pieces, space is really big.If you imagine the volume of space that covers the surface of the Earth out to 1,000 milesout. That’s a huge volume in which you are putting many thousands of tiny pieces ofdebris and a few thousand satellites. So, the typical distance between them at any one timeis hundreds of miles. You have one piece of debris and satellite every hundred miles. Butthey are all traveling very fast.Eventually things are going to start hitting each other, but it’s on a time scale of months toyears. Things aren’t going to start being hit in the next day or so. That’s not how it works.HOW SERIOUS DO YOU THINK DAMAGE COULD BE A CONSEQUENCE FROMTHIS ONE EXPLOSION OF THE WEATHER SATELLITE EVENTUALLY?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"It would not surprise me if it caused the destruction of at least one working satellite andmaybe a couple. I would be surprised if it was bad enough to cause the destruction ofmany satellites. So, I’m more concerned – it could also cause some damage to theInternational Space Station. I’m more concerned about the implications when you starthaving multiple events of this kind.THERE IS A LOT OF COMPETITION THAT SEEMS TO BE EMERGING BETWEENCHINA AND INDIA AND JAPAN, SAY GOING TO THE MOON.Right. International Space CompetitionTHIS RIGHT NOW WOULD REPRESENT A PAWN MOVE BY CHINA THATAPPARENTLY HAS SURPRISED EVERYONE?I think that’s right. It’s clear that U. S. intelligence was aware of this (Chineseanti-satellite) program and was waiting for the test. There are indications we have of that.But in the rest of the world, I think it did come as a surprise. Certainly to those of us whoare not privy to U. S. secrets, we were all surprised by this. We had not realized that Chinawas going this route.It’s also surprising because it’s a strange route for them to be going. I suspect that it willnot in the end give them a lot of advantage. But clearly it’s part of the scenario that Chinais acting as a super power. I don’t think this is directed at India and Japan, even thoughsome of China’s other space activities are. India and Japan don’t really pose a surveillancethreat to China. There is no reason for China to go after those countries’ satellites. I thinkthis is very much a defensive, or a move, against the United States. I think it’s the concernthat the U. S. has said it might in some circumstances have to take out other countries’satellites. China wants to be able to respond in kind and take out our spy satellites.The fear on the U. S. side is that China wants this capability because it wants to make anaggressive move against Taiwan. The scenario is that the day before China invades Taiwan,it would take out all the American spy satellites so we could not see what was going on. Future Consequences - Worst Case?WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE WORST CASE CONSEQUENCE GOING FORWARD -REALIZING THAT RUSSIA, THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA ALL HAVE THEABILITY TO LAUNCH ANTI-SATELLITE MISSILES AND THAT POLITICS AREMOVING OUT INTO SPACE?Right. I think the worst case scenario is that the United States and Russia, which hadretired their anti-satellite programs and not deployed the new ones they have been workingon will change their agenda and move more aggressively to develop space weapons andreally start an arms race in outer space. I think that would be bad for the planet. It wouldcertainly be bad for the civilian use of space. It would be bad for the space environment ingeneral for the foreseeable future.”More Information:For further information about space weapon issues, please see the Earthfiles Archivesbelow:• 04/28/2006 -- Modern Warfare Applied to Extra-Terrestrial Invasion• 05/19/2005 --USAF Wants Space Weapons Program• 06/18/2004 -- German Scientist Werner von Braun Anticipated Terrorists, Asteroids andETs on American \"Enemy's List\"• 04/21/2004 -- At the X-Conference, Former Naval Intelligence Officer, C.
