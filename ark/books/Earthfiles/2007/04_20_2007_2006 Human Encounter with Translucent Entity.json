I could see it, but I could also see through it.\" - Male Florida Resident, August 2006\"What really intrigues me is the E.T.s can be 5% to 10% in this dimensionon this physical plane while the rest is in another dimension. There are dimensionsout there like layers of an onion... The E. T.s molecularly change the vibrationof something so they can be in another dimension and solid,but be projected here in only 5%. That's when you can see through them.\" - Jim Sparks, E. T. Experiencer and Author, The Keepers April 20, 2007 Southern Florida - In 1995, at a conference about the human abductionsyndrome, one of the participants was a man named Jim Sparks, born Jim Sparacino to hisItalian parents on November 15, 1954.Unlike many abductees who experience loss of consciousness and missing time, Jim’sinteractions with what he calls ‘aliens’ have been mostly conscious. Even back in 1995,Jim Sparks made a clear distinction between what he described as “small, grey, droneworker types” versus “taller, true aliens, or supervisors.”Jim explained that when he was thirty-four years old in 1988, he was happily married andhad thriving real-estate work in both Texas and North Carolina. Then suddenly, beingsfrom other worlds entered his life and he thought he was losing his mind. Jim Sparks hadinteractions with three different types: one category was the grey-skinned, large dark eyes,that apparently come in many varieties, including small androids that do work for taller,very intelligent controllers. Jim also had a conscious, face-to-face encounter with severaltall, reptilian-skinned humanoids. Jim says those reptilians warned that the Earth’senvironment is facing a crisis and that the planet must be saved, whether humans surviveor not.From 1988 into the 1990s, Jim was schooled by the Greys in front of computers and3-dimensional projections. Jim was forced to learn the alien symbols and numbers.Eventually, Jim says he was also contacted by alleged U. S. government intelligenceoperatives who wanted to know about the alien symbols and numbers.Jim has always stressed that when people see aerial craft jump from one side of the sky tothe other, or see entities that appear translucent and walk through solid walls, or feel aweight go down on their bed, but cannot see what’s making the weight – it’s all advanced,alien technologies.On April 13, 2007, I interviewed Jim Sparks during the Ozark UFO Conference at EurekaSprings, Arkansas, for Coast to Coast AM with George Noory. Jim talked about hispersonal experiences with the advanced technologies and said: \"What really intrigues me isthe E.T.s can be 5% to 10% in this dimension on this physical plane while the rest is inanother dimension. There are dimensions out there like layers of an onion... The E. T.smolecularly change the vibration of something so they can be in another dimension andsolid, but be projected here in only 5%. That's when you can see through them.\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"After I returned to my Albuquerque, New Mexico, office from the Ozark conference, Ifound an email from a radio listener about his own encounter with a scaly, translucententity in his southern Florida bedroom on August 27, 2006. The man has requestedanonymity, so in this report, I will call him \"John Smith.\" He is 30-years-old with a coupleof years in business courses at a college. He is currently self-employed in the cleaningindustry.He talked first about a sighting of an orange, glowing, oval-shaped aerial object he saw onThanksgiving night 2004 that left him thinking about extraterrestrials, but with noconscious knowledge of E. T. interactions in his life.Interview:John Smith, Self-Employed, Southern Florida: \" It was Thanksgiving night in 2004,about 10 PM. This was 100% real. What it was, I can’t say. I just know it was completelyabnormal. I was at my aunt and uncle’s house. I was getting ready to go outside. Theyhave a pool and hot tub and I just wanted to go out and relax. On my way out the door, Ipassed through the screened in patio area and suddenly got an intuitive hit or premonition– which is not new for me. I’m a normal guy, but I get these hits. And this was that I wasgoing to see something extraterrestrial or UFO-related, abnormal, out of this world.I got into the hot tub to relax, just leaning back and looking up at the sky. Then I hear aplane with a propeller. It was pretty loud actually, off to my left. It made me look up and Icould see the plane off some distance. As I was looking at the plane, at the corner of myeye I could also see a light. I turn my head and lock on to the light. It was about 100 to 150feet in the air.\"Oval, plasma disc\" the color of a ripe peach with pink and dark colors swirling inside it,about 100 to 150 feet in the air above hot tub on Thanksgiving night 2004,in southern Florida. Sketch © 2007 by John Smith.The light was orange, like a ripe peach with some pink – an oval, plasma disc, I guess youcould say. That’s what it looked like. I don’t know what it actually was. It also had someblack in there – not a lot – and it looked like the colors were swirling around inside. Thiswas directly over the house where I was when I was in the hot tub. I don’t know if it was acoincidence, or had something to do with me. I don’t really know.IF YOU EXTEND YOUR ARM AND COMPARE THE ENDS OF YOUR FINGERS ORFIST TO THE SIZE OF THE ORANGE OVAL, ABOUT HOW BIG WAS IT?I would say about an inch.THE PLANE WAS MUCH SMALLER THAN THE ORANGE OVAL?Ye s .DID YOU RECEIVE ANY INTUITIVE IMPRESSION THAT THE NOISY PLANE WASTHERE BECAUSE THE ORANGE OBJECT WAS THERE?No. I’m not certain the plane pilot was even aware of the orange oval.SO WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?The oval light is above the house at that moment, as I’m looking up and I focused clearlyon it. Then it shot all the way across over the horizon to the west very quickly. Obviouslythat is not normal, but what it was, I can’t tell you.THE INFERENCE IS THAT WHATEVER WAS IN THE ORANGE GLOWING OVALMIGHT HAVE BEEN FROM SOMEWHERE OFF PLANET?I would lean that way."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" August 27, 2006 - Translucent Scaly EntityWHEN IS THE NEXT EPISODE?It was two years later on August 27, 2006, which was the night of a Coast to Coast AMinterview with Whitley Strieber talking about his latest book entitled, The Greys. I wasrelaxed on my couch listening to the interview and imagining myself there with Whitley,feeling the feelings for about 2 ½ hours. I remember feeling really creeped out, butenjoying the entertainment. Then I felt really tired and wanted to go to bed. I lay down andtried to sleep, but I was still 'in the zone' of what Whitley had been talking about.Now, I’m lying down on my back in the center of my bed. The headboard is against thewall and the bed is in the center of the wall. The wall that’s across from my headboardbeyond my feet – if you take that wall and go left, it runs into the corner, which comesback toward the wall at the head of the bed. At that corner, I have two, very tallbookshelves packed with books. There is one shelf on each wall so they make a cornerthemselves. To the right of that, which is in the center of the wall is my armoire that sticksout from the wall about an inch or inch and a half. Behind the armoire is a night-light. So,the night-light is blocked by the armoire, deflecting the light so it gives indirect lighting offthe wall and off the ceiling.My room is fairly dark. I remember trying to fall asleep. I close my eyes. I might fall asleepfor a couple of minutes and then wake back up, still in the mental frame of listening to theradio. As I sleep, my eyes open up by themselves. Through that little crack, I could seestraight in front of me and right where the wall meets the ceiling. That is where thereflected light shines from the night-light. I’d had that night-light there for a while, at leastsix months. But I remember that night, the light made me feel very strange for somereason. I guess I wasn’t in a very deep sleep. I would shut my eyes, go back to sleep, wakeback up again with my eyes partly open. That probably happened four times. The lightbothered me for some reason, almost like it wasn’t supposed to be there, like I wasforgetting where I was.As I opened my eyes again, I thought, ‘What is that? What is going on? Where am I?’ I didnot seem to recognize my furniture, even though I also knew it was my furniture. Yet for amoment, I did not remember where I was, feeling really strange.Then I feel like there is a presence in the room. I pick my head up and start to pull up myshoulders. I begin to open my eyes and immediately I look to the corner of my room to theleft where the bookshelves are. I just felt a presence and right there, I saw a scaly beingthat was translucent. There, but not there. I could see it, but I could also see through it.Translucent entity with \"skin like an iguana\" standing near bookshelf beyond John Smith's bed,seeming to stare at the crystals in front of UFO books. Entity's heightwas about 4.5 to 5 feet. Sketch © 2007 by John Smith.COULD YOU DESCRIBE THE HEIGHT, THE COLOR, AND OTHER DETAILS?I just took out my tape measure today to go over that before we talked to make sure"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"because I thought you might want to know. It was somewhere between 4 ½ and 5 feet tall,to the top of the head. It was not a typical grey alien. That’s not what I saw. It had skinlike an iguana.Green Iguana (Iguana iguana), Jalapao Region, Brazilian Cerrado, Brazil.Photograph © by Laurie Vitt, Ph.D.Green iguana's long, clawed feet.Its right arm was down by its side. The left I could not see. Its fingers – definitely I couldsee those! The fingers really creeped me out. They were moving like snakes.CAN YOU ELABORATE?The fingers were real squirmy, like worms, from the hand.DID YOU PERCEIVE A COLOR ON THIS IGUANA SKIN?Yes, yes. It definitely was not like a wet suit or anything like that. I guess I would say theoverall color would be between a dark purple to a dark blue. But I also seem to remembera dark mustard around the hands and the arm area. The colors weren’t really bold orcomplete throughout the whole body. It was not like a solid color. It seemed to fade. Idon’t know if that was part of the translucent effect, but that’s how I seem to recall it.WHAT ABOUT THE FEATURES IN THE FACE?I can’t exactly describe the face because this is another weird part - he was not lookingdirectly at me. Or it. My impression was that it was really preoccupied and interested inmy collection of books. It was facing directly the section of books that deal with UFOs andaliens and that whole topic. I haven’t even read those books yet. I buy books and get tothem later. In front of the books were crystals, including one that had a serpent, or dragon,standing on a geode (natural crystals formed inside sphere that was once volcanic lava).Crystals on John Smith's bookshelf, including the metal dragon holding a crystaland standing on the geode. Image © 2007 by John Smith.WERE YOU ABLE TO SEE ITS EYES?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Yes, I could see the one eye. It was just dark, black, and not big. The translucent being didnot turn its head all the way around. It was not like interested in me. It was aware and, Iguess, acknowledged me by turning its head that it knew I was awake and staring at it. Butit was standing there, didn’t really move, stood still, and just slightly moved its head overto the side. I was probably realistically looking at it for about 30 seconds, but it felt like aminute or two! I was just totally locked on. I seem to remember thinking to myself, ‘It’stranslucent. I’m just dreaming! Go back to bed. So, lay down and go back to bed.’WHEN YOU LAY BACK DOWN ON THE PILLOW, WHAT HAPPENED?I just went back to bed. I looked at it, told myself I was dreaming because it wastranslucent. I’ve never even heard of that before.UNTIL YOU HEARD ABOUT JIM SPARKS?Yes. And that’s what made me think maybe there was something to it. I did feel a presenceand I remember staring at it dead on for at least 30 seconds. It seemed like I could seeenough detail that it was there, but also translucent.IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE ENTITY ITSELF TELEPATHICALLY CONVINCED YOUTO MAKE THAT ASSUMPTION AND GO BACK TO SLEEP BECAUSE IT WANTEDTO DO SOMETHING WITHOUT YOU OBSERVING?Sure, I’ve thought about that. I think so. That’s possible.WHAT IS YOUR NEXT WAKING MOMENT?I guess it would be the morning. The memory of the being hasn’t bothered me, but it reallyseems odd to me.ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN YOUR CHILDHOOD?Definitely when I was younger between ages 3 and 4, at night I was afraid of a presence inthe hallway. The door was open and I was always looking into the hallway. I could justfeel a presence.AS IF YOU WERE BEING WATCHED BY SOMETHING YOU COULD NOT SEE?Yes, and yelling to my mother, ‘I think I see something!’ Or, ‘I think something’s here!'\"More Information:The Keepers: An Alien Message for the Human Race© 2006 by Jim Sparks, published by Wild Flower Press.ISBN is: 1-930724-05-5.
