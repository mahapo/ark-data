We are seeing Sagittarius at the very endof its life as an intact system.” - Martin Weinberg, Ph.D., Univ. of MassachusettsRed denotes the stars of the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy being devoured by our much moremassive blue Milky Way galaxy, based on models that match the map of 2MASS M-giant stars.Yellow dot denotes the position of our sun and solar system. Sagittarius debris extends fromthe denser \"core\" in upper right, wrapping around the Milky Way and descends throughour sun's position. Illustration by David Law, Univ. of Virginia.August 3, 2007 Charlottesville, Virginia - More and more people are depending on theinternet for their daily news updates. But there is no overall Web Editor to do a realitycheck on content. So, finding out what is factual is an ever-increasing challenge.One headline that has been circulating on the web since June 2007 is false, according toastronomers. It states: “Scientists Prove We Are Not From Here!” The author is listed asDan Eden of Viewzone.com. Mr. Eden begins: “Imagine the shock of growing up in a loving family with people you call‘Mum’ and ‘Dad’ and then, suddenly, learning that you are actually adopted!“This same sense of shock came as scientists announced that the Sun, Moon,our planet and its siblings, were not born into the familiar band of stars knownas the Milky Way galaxy, but we actually belong to a strange formation withthe unfamiliar name of the Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy.”The article references astrophysicists at the University of Virginia who used theTwo-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) to survey the sky in infrared light."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2MASS view of the entire sky, dominated by our Milky Way.The faint extension below the Milky Way center is the core of the Sagittarius Dw arf galaxy.The objects in the lower right quadrant are the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, whichare more intact satellite galaxies of the Milky Way than the Sagittarius Dwarf that isbeing torn apart and absorbed by the Milky Way. Photo credit: John Carpenter and Robert Hurt, 2MASS.According to Dan Eden, the University of Virginia astrophysicists confirmed:“The fact that the Milky Way is seen in the sky at an angle has always puzzledastronomers. If we originated from the Milky Way, we ought to be oriented tothe galaxy’s ecliptic, with the planets aligned around our Sun in much thesame angle as our Sun aligns with the Milky Way. Instead, the angle suggeststhat our Sun is influenced by some other system. Now we know what it is. Weactually belong to the Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy.” University of Virginia AstrophysicistsNever Said Our Solar System from Sagittarius DwarfI called the University of Virginia Astronomy Department and talked with Prof. StevenMajewski, lead author of a paper published in the Astrophysical Journal entitled: “NewMap of the Milky Way Shows Our Galaxy to Be A Cannibal.” The date of that paper? December 20, 2003 – four years ago!The Astrophysical Journal article was about how the Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy is 10,000times smaller than the mass of our Milky Way and is being absorbed by the Milky Way – acommon process in this universe where larger galaxies “eat” smaller ones and grow bigger.Prof. Majewski and his colleague, Prof. Michael Skrutskie, explained that our solar systemand Milky Way only briefly and periodically pass through Sagittarius debris. And one ofthose times happens to be now. “Remarkably, stars from Sagittarius are now raining downonto our present position in the Milky Way. Stars from an alien galaxy are relatively nearus.”In the Astrophysical Journal article, the scientists do not say our solar system is from theSagittarius Dwarf galaxy. Further, astrophysicists know that our solar system and othershave evolved at many different angles to the Milky Way galactic plane.Bottom line: a 2003 science journal article gets resurrected four years later in 2007 withthe sensational claim that our solar system is not really from the Milky Way – while in fact,the original science was about how the Milky Way, that includes our solar system, is bigenough to eat other smaller galaxies.More Information:For further information about our solar system and the cosmos, please see reports belowin Earthfiles Archive:• 07/12/2007 — First Water Confirmed in Extrasolar Planet's Atmosphere• 06/20/2007 — Update: What Is the Moving Light in Saturn's Rings?
