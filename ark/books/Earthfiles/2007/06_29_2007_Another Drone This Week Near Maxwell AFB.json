The CARET Laboratory’sresearch goal is stated as, “achieving a greater understanding of extraterrestrial technologywithin the context of commercial applications and civilian use.\"The document states that the CARET Q4-86 research “focused on four key subjects, all ofwhich were based on artifacts of extraterrestrial origin obtained from crash site recoveryoperations conducted during the last two decades within the continental United States,”between 1966 and 1986.The four subjects are listed as:1. “Personal” antigravity generator (so-named for its small, portable size);2. Three-dimensional image recorder/projector3. A complex system of symbols and geometric constructs capable of bothdefining the functionality of certain artifacts as well as manipulating theirbehavior, crudely analogous to a computer programming language, butwithout the need for a compilation or interpretation phase.4. is BLACKED OUT entirely. In a separate follow-up email, the document'sleaker – who calls himself by the alias “Isaac” – explained that the blackedout sections had been done by CARET in Palo Alto, and not by him.Isaac organized his own website for the public to view his long letter of explanation andthe CARET document pages and photographs he has supplied, which he allegedly sneakedout of the CARET Laboratory in Palo Alto during his work time there between 1984 and1987. Isaac’s website URL is: http://isaaccaret.fortunecity.com/The photographs show what are described as extraterrestrial instruments used forantigravity and for 3-dimensional image recording and projecting. The sizes of thephotographed instruments are only inches long, according to Isaac and the document. Butthe instruments contain a symbol language that resembles what has been photographed in"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"May 2007 underneath the \"tails\" of the estimated 25-foot-long dragonfly drones by Chadin the Bakersfield, California, region and by Rajman in Capitola, California.[ See: Earthfiles05/15/07 http://www.earthfiles.com/news.php?ID=1247&category=Environmentand Earthfiles05/21/07.http://www.earthfiles.com/news.php?ID=1247&category=Environment ]Those symbols have been studied intensely and led to the discovery of possible linksbetween the “dragonfly drone” tail symbols and NASA’s Clementine I lunar photographyand mapping mission in 1994.[ http://www.earthfiles.com/news.php?ID=1271&category=Environment ]In addition to the symbol language, the CARET document on Page 56, has a photograph ofrings that closely match the structure of the rings in the larger scale dragonfly-drones,estimated to be about 25-feet-long.Isaac’s email and documents imply that this particular extraterrestrial technology was partof an American government effort to back-engineer, through civilian scientists, and applycommercially at the CARET Laboratory in Palo Alto. That E. T. technology allegedly cancontrol gravity and project 3-dimensional images that apparently would look real to ushumans, but are something akin to what we know as holographic images. The documentalso implies that the projected image technology can record. 5:45 AM, Montgomery, Alabama,near Maxwell AFBWith this concept of an extraterrestrial technology that can neutralize gravity and projectholographic-like 3-dimensional images that can record data for whatever unknown reason,here is what happened this week on Monday, June 25th, 2007, 6 miles from Maxwell AFBand its Gunter AFB Annex in Montgomery, Alabama. The eyewitness is a long-timetechnical specialist in security, educated about infrared frequency technologies and normalhuman aviation. Because his work is highly sensitive, he has asked that I not use his actualname. So, I will call him Ted Connors.Ted said that the local Montgomery news media announced last week there would be jointArmy/Air Force exercises at Maxwell AFB with lots of planes and helicopters, beginningon Sunday, June 24th, around 8 PM. Ted said the noise was terrible and unrelentingthrough Monday night, June 25, while he was on duty in his security work that involves 32infrared cameras.Interview: Ted Connors (alias), Technical Specialist in Security, Montgomery, Alabama: “During the night of Monday, June 25th, I patrolled a compound where I’m in charge ofsecurity. A lot of noise all night long. But early in the morning – it was probably about 5:45AM, because the sun had not come up yet and it was still dark and within 6 miles ofMaxwell AFB.YOU’RE AWARE OF ALL THE MIITARY ACTIVITY IN THE SKY. YOU AREWORKING IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGIES?Infrared cameras, high frequency infrared technology for a company.DO YOU HAVE A WHOLE BANK OF MONITORING SCREENS FOR THEINFRARED?Correct.IS THIS WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING AT ON OR ABOUT 6 AM ON MONDAY,JUNE 25TH?That would be correct.SO, WHAT HAPPENED?Well, at that particular time, I was outside. I just glanced up because I will normally do thatjust to check. This equipment I’m telling you about is mounted up high within 20 to 30 feet"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"(above ground). I was doing a normal check when I noticed beside a tree what looked likea ring. I thought somebody had thrown a hub cab up in the tree. And I moved to one sideto look at it – it was just before daylight, the sun was coming up. So you could see, but youcould not really make out a lot of detail.So, as I looked around, I could see this thing. It was not attached to the tree. It was not inthe tree. It was to the side of the tree! And it had these elongated wires that stuck out ofthe top and just sort of curved and went up and sort of disappeared. They looked like theyjust sort of faded out. They didn’t stop, they just faded out. Hieroglyphic \"Blotches\" On Drone TailAs I looked at an angle, I could see it looked like a tail rotor on a helicopter made up of (aconnected series of) shapes like fan blades, like a ceiling fan. I thought, ‘This is weird!’ Icould see because of the streetlights in the area and high mercury vapor lights, I could seepatterns on the bottom of it that looked like blotches. It looked like some type ofhieroglyphics.IT’S ON THOSE CONNECTED SEGMENTS THAT YOU SAW THE'HIEROGLYPHICS?'Right, correct.Chad's close-up of dragonfly \"drone\" lettering on long tail section.Chad wrote that his images were taken on May 6, 2007,in the general Bakersfield region.Rajman1977 Image 0016, taken with a Konica Minolta DiMAGE X onMay 16, 2007, in Capitola, California.

I could actually make out the symbols, especially on the paddle part thatstuck out.ON THE CHAD DRONE PHOTOGRAPHS AND ON THE CAPITOLA, CALIFORNIA,WHICH CURRENTLY ARE THE TWO BLOCKS OF PHOTOGRAPHS PRIOR TOJUNE 2007, WHICH SHOWED LETTERING ON WHAT EVERYBODY HAS BEENCALLING THE ‘LONG TAIL’ SECTION. IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY PADDLE?Right. Right. It appeared to me like a series of ceiling fan blades that were attached (toeach other). It had that same contour like they were sloped on one end and wider towardthe end. Then they were connected together. I couldn’t make out whether it was three orfour, but it looked like they were inner-connected by some type of a wire or some type ofbar that connected them together. What Do Dragonfly Drones Monitor?When I saw this thing, it was like, ‘Oh, my God!’ It was staring at me!! It just gave me theheebie jeebies.SO YOU HAD THE FEELING THAT THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE MONITORINGYOU SPECIFICALLY?Exactly.WHICH IS WHAT THE MAN IN ARIZONA THAT I CALL ‘NED WHITE’ IN 1995 –HE WAS NOT FAR FROM HEBER, ARIZONA. AND HE SEES ONE OF THESE(DRONES) AND HAD THE DISTINCT IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS MONITORINGOTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE ACROSS A MEADOW FROM WHERE HEWAS AND IT ACTUALLY SANK DOWN BEHIND TREES AS IF IT WERE ONSURREP TITIOUS SURVEILL ANCE .Yeah, that’s what I felt like. Doing that type of work myself, I know what it feels like to beunder surveillance. I have night vision equipment and all this other stuff. That’s what I do.And I felt like this thing was watching me. I had this gut feeling that this thing is eithertaking pictures of me or it’s looking at me, scanning, and that was the feeling that I had. Ijust had this feeling that this thing knew I was there and it was watching me.I sort of stood there and looked at it for a while. It did not move. It did not make any noiseat all.THE TAIL WAS CONNECTED TO A RING?Right, the ring appeared to be – from where I was standing, it’s hard to judge. To me it waslike a hubcap, but I know it was bigger than that. I would probably have been the size of a50-gallon drum in diameter.SO, THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THIS PARTICULAR “DRONE” WOULD BE HOWLONG?From what I call the wheel portion back to the tail, I would probably say no more than 15to 20 feet long (the tail length).YOU KNOW THAT BECAUSE YOU ARE CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE AERIALDRONE AND THE TREE THAT YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF WAY TO JUDGE THESIZE OF IT IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE TREE?Right, because it was a large oak tree directly in its path and it seemed to be hovering overthe oak tree. Now as far as the distance between the top of the oak tree and the device, Icould not tell. It was hard to tell because it was off at an angle. But it seemed like maybe20 or 30 feet at the maximum from the tree. \"Absolutely Stationary\" and Silent Dragonfly DroneUP IN THE AIR ABOVE IT?Right, correct."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"WAS THIS ABSOLUTELY STATIONARY? OR, WAS THERE ANY MOTION AT ALL?I saw no motion whatsoever. It was absolutely stationary. At that point, I had my cellphone, which has a camera and I grabbed the cell phone and tried to take a picture –actually tried to take three pictures. It was still dark enough that I couldn’t get a goodpicture. I even tried to increase the light sensitivity on my cell phone camera so maybe thatwould help. But they all came out just kind of blurry black looking. So, I gave up on thatidea and put the cell phone back in its case in a holder around my waist.And that’s when it started to move. Its movement was really, really slow. It moved to thewest at a very slow rate, maybe 2 mph or 1 mph, something like that.WAS THE RING AT THE FRONT OF THE FORWARD MOTION?Yes, it was. It actually moved like you move forward in an airplane in which as you moveforward, the tail follows the engine - or what I call the tail, which was those paddles thatfollowed it.It also looked like it had protruding antennae, but I couldn’t tell. They weren’t very large,not much larger than the wires sticking from he top. There were quite a few wires stickingout of this thing from the top.HOW HIGH DO YOU THINK THOSE WIRES ON TOP WENT UP INTO THE AIR?Probably 3 to 4 feet off the surface of that ring. (Combined with his 15 to 20 feet lengthestimate of the tale, pretty close to the 25-feet estimate by other eyewitnesses.) Closest Match in Photographs: Chad, Bakersfield, California, May 6, 2007OF ALL THE IMAGES THAT HAVE SURFACED PUBLICLY SO FAR, WHICH ONE ISCLOSEST TO WHAT YOU SAW THIS WEEK NEAR MAXWELL AFB?The one I’m looking at on your Earthfiles \"Part 1: Explanation of the Strange CraftSightings\" and you have a photograph by Chad. That one really – if I had to guess closestmatch to what I saw, it would be that Chad photograph (by the yellow flowers), that's theclosest one.Dragonfly-shaped \"drone\" photographed by Chad on May 6, 2007,in Bakersfield, California region.The one thing, Linda, this thing did that was sort of odd to me, when it moved – the firsttime it moved, and I watched it as it advanced – when it started to move, it was like adouble image. How can I explain this? When Drone Moved,Looked Like Double ExposureLIKE YOU WERE SEEING A DOUBLE EXPOSURE?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Yeah! Yeah! Exactly. It moved and you saw it one place, but you also saw it where it wasbefore. Like two places at once, almost. And that’s the only time it did that was when itinitially moved. Then after the movement started, I didn’t see that anymore.IN THE ISAAC INFORMATION THAT EMERGED ON TUESDAY, JUNE 26,DESCRIBED THIS AS EXTRATERRESTRIAL TECHNOLOGY ORIGINALLY THATHAS THE ABILITY TO CLOAK SO SUCCESSFULLY THAT IT CAN REMAININVISIBLE UNLESS THERE ARE JAMMING FREQUENCIES THAT INTERFEREAND ANOTHER HUGE PART OF THE COMPONENTS THAT RELATE TO THISDRAGONFLY “DRONE” IS THAT IT CAN PROJECT 3-DIMENSIONAL IMAGES.When I saw it, Linda, it blew my mind! I’m pretty grounded. I have to be for what I do fora living.THE QUESTION WE WOULD ALL LIKE ANSWERED: ARE THEYBACK-ENGINEERED BY AMERICAN ENGINEERING ABILITIES FROM THEEXTRATERRESTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES, AS ISAAC HAS SAID? OR ARE WE STILLSEEING LITERAL EXTRATERRESTRIAL TECHNOLOGY AT WORK?My question is: how can this thing move without making noise? There was absolutely nonoise at all. Something in the air that does not make noise and moves is not right.AND SO CLOSE TO YOU!Right.LET’S GO BACK TO THAT MICROSECOND IN YOUR MIND’S EYE RIGHT NOWWHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE ‘DRONE.’ IT IS 20 FEET OR SO ABOVE THEOAK TREE AND IT’S ABSOLUTELY STILL. IT’S NOT MAKING ANY SOUND.THEN DESCRIBE EXACTLY WHAT YOU SEE HAPPEN.It moved and that’s when it did the double take. And it shifted approximately maybe twoor three feet to the right.THEN DID YOU SEE LIKE TWO IMAGES OF THIS THING?Right, that’s when I saw the two images. The image that was there where it originally wasand then the image where it had moved to. I was seeing two things, and then the other onesort of blended into it. It was like it sort of sucked it (other image) towards it (front imagein new location).YOU’RE SEEING WHAT LOOKS LIKE SORT OF A MOTION GOING FORWARDTWO OR THREE FEET. AND THEN THERE ARE TWO IMAGES OF THIS RING.HOW DID IT MOVE FROM THAT POINT FORWARD AND WHAT HAPPENED?It moved at exactly the same altitude. It did not go up and it didn’t go down. But it slowly,at a couple mph, moved to the west. As it moved to the west, I followed it with my eyes,but there are so many trees where I’m at. It went over a tree line and just disappeared.Once it got past the trees, I could not see it anymore. As a matter of fact, I got in a vehicleto try to follow it, but the area where I’m at is so wooded you can’t really see anything. Iwent two or three blocks and came back and that was it.WHAT WAS IN THAT DIRECTION GOING WEST?Maxwell AFB. Can Drone Invisibility Be Jammed?Might Explain \"Flickering In and Out\" At Big Basin[ See: http://www.earthfiles.com/news.php?ID=1270&category=Environment ]ON TUESDAY, JUNE 26, WHEN ISAAC’S INFORMATION CAME OUT, AND YOUAND I TALKED ABOUT IT BRIEFLY, YOU MADE A CONNECTION BETWEENISAAC’S RELEASE OF INFORMATION AND ALL THE INFRARED. CAN YOUEXPLAIN THAT?What hit me the most was when I read the article, it said that this thing cloaks itself, but itcan be jammed. And when I saw that, I knew I had all this equipment and I’m thinking,‘Could this possibly be the reason I saw it (drone)? Maybe I wouldn’t have seen it if I didnot have the equipment around me that was active? Possibly had it been turned off, would"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"I have seen anything? Or maybe not. I thought maybe infrared will detect it.HOW MANY OF THESE DRAGONFLY-SHAPED DRONES ARE IN THE SKIES OFTHIS PLANET IN BOTH HEMISPHERES AND NOBODY KNOWS BECAUSE THEYARE INVISIBLE?Yeah, that’s the scary thing. I honestly have never seen anything like this before like thisthing. It’s so different, but it doesn’t appear to be like a UFO. It appears to be like it’sclean – it’s almost scary clean.If this thing shows up again, if I have to climb up on a stepladder with a flashlight and get apicture of this thing, I’m going to get a picture of this thing and prove once and for all thatthis blooming thing exists!This thing is real! I know what I saw and I know it’s real! I don’t think it’s extraterrestrialin usage. I think it’s our people that are using it, our government, or whoever. But I thinkthat the technology is definitely extraterrestrial. Nothing flies like this – nothing I’ve everseen moves and leaves a signature and then moves and the signature moves from where itwas over to where it is now and disappears. I mean, your mind won’t register that! (laughs)It just doesn’t add up.\"Could the silence so often reported by human eyewitnesses of high strangeness in theskies be because what’s seen is not always 3-dimensional matter as we know it, but asophisticated image projection that can record data from us and our planet? Symbol \"Language\" That Is LikeSelf-Activating Software Without HardwareIn a section of the alleged CARET secret document entitled “The ‘Language,’ it states:“Their hardware wasn’t operated in quite the same way as ours. In ourtechnology, even today, we have a combination of hardware and softwarerunning almost everything on the planet. Software is more abstract thanhardware, but ultimately it needs hardware to run it. In other words, there’s noway to write a computer program on a piece of paper, set that piece of paperon a table, and expect it to actually do something. The most powerful code inthe world still doesn’t actually do anything until a piece of hardware interpretsit and translates its commands into actions.\"But their (the E.T.) technology is different. It really did operate like themagical piece of paper sitting on a table, in a manner of speaking. They hadsomething akin to a language that could quite literally execute itself, at least inthe presence of a very specific type of field. The language, a term I am stillusing very loosely, is a system of symbols along with geometric forms andpatterns that fit together to form diagrams that are themselves functional.Once they are drawn, so to speak, on a suitable surface made of a suitablematerial and in the presence of a certain type of field, the diagramsimmediately begin performing the desired tasks.”After reading about the extraterrestrial symbol/diagram self-activating language, I emailedIsaac this question: “Could this perhaps explain the function of crop formations? If so,what have the geometries and non-geometries placed on the surface of this planet for atleast 25 years been doing? Or, what are the current ones doing now? One of the 9-foldgeometry patterns in Madisonville, Tennessee, this spring seems similar to one of themarkings on the Chad-photographed drone tail.’” Madisonville, Tennessee, wheat pattern about 170 feet in diameter with crop laid downin counterclockwise circles and a triangle in the center circle of standing wheat,discovered from airplane on May 15, 2007.
