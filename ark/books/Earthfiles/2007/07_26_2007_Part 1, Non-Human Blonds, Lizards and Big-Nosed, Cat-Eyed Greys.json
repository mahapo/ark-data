By age 8, the boy understood that his father worked on very importantmatters concerning astronauts and NASA's moon missions. His mother seemed to know alot, too, but the boy was never told exactly what his parents did. However, he vividlyremembers the night in 1968 when silver-suited, blond-haired \"astronauts\" woke him up inhis bedroom and he thought they had come home from work with his father.Interview:Blond \"Astronauts\" in KansasKansas Abductee, now 47-years-old and requesting anonymity: \"It was in my parents'house in Kansas, in my bedroom. I just remember seeing what I would say werenormal-sized people, except they were in spacesuits. That’s the best way I can describe itfrom back then, anyway – kind of a silver, metallic-looking suits. No helmets or anythinglike that.HAD YOU BEEN ASLEEP AND THEN WOKE UP?Yes, I had been asleep and I’m not exactly sure what woke me up, but I remember wakingup.WHAT WAS THE VERY FIRST THING YOU SAW?A person standing at kind of a 45-degree angle above my bed, just kind of looking at me.LEANING OVER YOU?Ye s .WHAT DID THAT PERSON LOOK LIKE?As best I can remember - because my Dad had told me that he was working on the Apollomission. At that time, he worked for the Boeing Co. All I remember thinking was, ‘Wow!He brought astronauts home.’ (laughs)So, I kind of sat up on one elbow and said, ‘Hi.’ They just kind of smiled and waved at me."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"That person (bending over me) looked just like you or me except he had blond hair.FEMALE OR MALE?I had the feeling that it was a male. As I remember, it was kind of what we call a platinumblond and about shoulder length. His physical stature would be that of a normal mid-20syoung man, not heavy, not skinny, just kind of normal appearance.IN A SILVER LEOTARD?I remember it as a spacesuit. Now that I’m older and think about it, it was more like atighter fitting garment.MORE LIKE A JUMP SUIT THAN LEOTARD?Ye s .WAS IT SILVER METALLIC?Right. Kind of a Millar color, except I don’t remember it being quite that bright, but it wasdark in the room.DID THIS MAN WITH THE BLOND, SHOULDER-LENGTH HAIR HAVE BANGS?OR ALL THE SAME LENGTH?Best I can remember, it was all the same length, just kind of parted in the middle andpulled back sort of behind the ears or flowing over the ears and down the sides of his faceto his shoulders.WHAT ABOUT THE EYES?They were blue, I remember that.WHICH COLOR BLUE?Real pretty sky blue, or robin egg blue. I don’t remember a pupil as such, as much as I dothat his eyes were sparkly.WHAT WAS THE SPARKL E?It was almost like looking at the sky when the stars first come out.AS IF THERE WERE GLINTS OF LIGHT IN HIS EYES?Ye s .THINK OF YOUR OWN EYES – WAS HIS IRIS THE SAME SIZE AS A HUMAN IRIS?OR BIGGER? OR SMALLER?You know how we have the white of our eye, then the color (iris) and then the pupil? I justremember the blue. There might have been a pupil, but at that age of 8, I was kind ofexcited (laughs). But I was not scared. It was not like a frightening experience. It was areal calming feeling."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Similar blue-eyed, blond, male humanoid about 6 feet tall, but not inmylar-silver suit. Encountered in March 1982, by M.

They were paler than me – not as pale as an albino, butlike someone who had not been out in the sun very much.SOME PEOPLE HAVE COMPARED THE COLOR OF THE NORDIC BLONDNON-HUMAN SKIN TO THE COLOR OF A WHITE COTTON SHEET.Yeah, probably.WERE THE LIPS ESPECIALLY THIN?They kind of looked like anyone else’s lips, but they were kind of a rosy color, kind of alight pinkish color.SO IN CONTRAST TO THE VERY WHITE SKIN, THE LIPS HAD COLOR?Yes, not super pink, but enough to make out the lips.WERE THE CHEEK BONES PROMINENT?About like a Native American’s cheekbones – kind of high. You could see the bones. Theyweren’t sticking way out, but they looked high like a Native American’s face.ANY ACTOR, ALIVE OR DEAD, WHO MIGHT RESEMBLE THE ‘ASTRONAUTS’ INYOUR BEDROOM WHEN YOU WERE 8?Probably Marilyn Monroe, but with a thinner face.DID ALL THREE OF THE BLOND BEINGS LOOK EXACTLY ALIKE?No, one appeared to be a female.BECAUSE?Best I can recall, the one standing there by my bed and walked over (toward the othertwo). Another one turned towards me and smiled. When she turned sideways, it lookedlike she had breasts. And she had longer hair than he did."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"BREASTS, LONGER HAIR, AND WHEN SHE SMILED, WERE YOU LOOKING ATTEETH?No, I don’t think I was. It was not a real big smile, but kind of a gentle, loving smile.WITH LIPS CLOSED?Just barely open.DID HER JUMPSUIT LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THE OTHER TWO WHO WERE MEN?Correct.WERE THEY DRESSED IDENTICALLY?Ye s .COULD YOU SEE ANY SYMBOL, PATCH, OR DESIGN?There was something on the guy leaning over me on his left chest.IN THE JUMPSUIT, DID IT COME UP LIKE A TURTLENECK, A V-NECK, WHAT?It covered the arms. I remember it had some kind of cuff on it. It looked different than therest of the sleeves. It went around the neck half-way up.SORT OF LIKE A NEHRU COLLAR HALF WAY UP THE NECK?Ye s .DID IT FIT THE NECK TIGHTLY?Ye s .WERE THE SLEEVES LOOSE AND LEGS LOOSE? OR TIGHT?Like the way Spandex material fits bodies.WERE ALL OF THE SUITS REFLECTIVE SILVER?Ye s .ANYTHING ON THEIR FEET?Darker grey, like a sole. I compared it to a spacesuit when I was a kid, but now as I thinkabout it, it looked like the suit blended into a darkish grey inch-thick sole, like a padding.ALL ONE PIECE AS IF THE FEET WERE APPENDED TO THE JUMP SUIT?Ye s .DID YOU SEE HANDS?Seemed to me like they had longer fingers, but other than that looked like normal humanhands.NAILS?I don’t remember looking that close.WHAT OTHER INTERACTION WAS THERE BETWEEN THE TWO MALES ANDTHE FEMALE?At that point, the guy who was bent over me walked around to the end of my bed wherethe other two were talking. I could hear, but I couldn’t understand what they were saying –kind of like they were talking real low.WERE THEIR LIPS MOVING AS THEY TALKED VERBALLY? OR DO YOU MEANTELEPATHIC?It seems like their lips were moving, but not a lot – like they were whispering. At thatpoint, the man (leaning over) walked away and his back was to me and I could see theother two were facing each other. That’s when the female turned around and smiled at me.And I remember thinking in my mind – and I don’t remember hearing sound – but she wassaying that everything was going to be fine."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"DID THE TWO MEN WAVE AT YOU?Just the one, the one that walked from my bed. The other one just kind of stood therelooking out my bedroom door, which was cracked.LIKE ONE WAS ON GUARD. SHE WAS THE MOST EMPATHIC. AND THE MALEBENDING OVER YOUR BED, HE WAVED AT YOU WHEN HE LEFT. SHE WAVEDAT YOU AND SMILED. THE OTHER SEEMED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT WHATWAS OUTSIDE YOUR BEDROOM DOOR?Right.DID YOU GET OUT OF BED?No, for some reason I did not and I don’t know why. I just remember laying there for asecond and then I remember her telling me that it’s all going to be all right, so lay backdown and go to sleep. Everything will be fine.So, I laid back down, drew the covers over me and lay there a couple of seconds. But Iwanted to know more and wanted to talk to them. So, I got up out of bed. I went out intothe living room and no one was there. That’s when I went and woke my dad up. I told himthere were three spacemen in my bedroom. He just smiled and said, ‘It will be OK. Youjust had a dream. Go back to sleep. Everything’s fine.’ So, I went back to my bedroom.I remember it took me a long time to go to sleep because I kept waiting for them to comeback. (laughs) Father Says Humans Could NotHandle the Truth About Non-HumansDID YOU HAVE A DEEPER CONVERSATION WITH YOUR FATHER ABOUT WHYTHE ASTRONAUTS WERE THERE AND WERE THEY CONNECTED TO YOURDAD’S WORK?In the morning, I asked Dad if he brought the astronauts home. My mom asked what I wastalking about. Dad said to Mom that I told him there were some astronauts in my bedroom.He said he told me everything was fine and I was just dreaming.I asked him again if he brought any astronauts home and he said, ‘No, I didn’t bring anyastronauts home. I don’t do that part of the work. I just work on parts for the rockets.’DID YOU HAVE A SENSE THAT YOUR FATHER KNEW MORE?I had a sense that he knew exactly what was going on.DID YOU EVER, BEFORE YOUR FATHER DIED IN SURGERY, TALK WITH HIMABOUT THAT EVENT?Yes and he said I was not to talk with anyone about it. He said he knew that everythingwas fine and if I knew the truth or if people in general knew the truth, it would – because Iasked him why he did not go to church. That’s how our conversation started. My Dadbasically told me that if humans knew the complete truth, it would change religion as weknow it today and would collapse religious beliefs. He told me, \"There is a higher beingand I believe in that. And I feel I’ll get to meet him. But other than that, I don’t feel I haveto go to church.\"Then I tried to question him about stuff he did for the military and he told me he could nottalk about it. Satellites and Non-SatellitesBUT DID YOU EVER KNOW IF YOUR FATHER HAD DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OFNON-HUMANS?I believe he did and I believe he tried to tell me that in so many words. We used to lay outon a hill and he would point objects out to me that were flying. On a couple of occasionshe said, ‘Those are satellites. You can tell because they are moving from east to west.Notice how they stay on a constant track?’"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"He said, ‘Now here in a few minutes, we’re going to see another light.’ He pointed one outand said, ‘That one is moving a little different.’I said, ‘Yeah, it’s going different directions pretty quick.’He said, ‘That’s right and that’s not a satellite.’I asked, ‘What is it?’He said, ‘I can’t discuss that with you. I just want you to know the difference and I wantyou to always remember this.’I said, ‘OK.’ I was probably 12-years-old at that point.DID HE SAY WHAT’S INSIDE THE ONES THAT DON’T MOVE IN A STRAIGHTLINE?No, he never did. My mother told me she would tell me everything before she died. I wassupposed to have a conversation with her on October 10, 1990. When I got to her house, Ifound her deceased on the floor.YOU HAD TALKED WITH HER BY PHONE ABOUT HER GIVING YOU ADOWNLOAD?Ye s .ANY OFFICIAL DETERMINATION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?They determined that it was a massive heart attack.DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?No, not really. She was trying to get to the phone. She was half way between her room andthe telephone. But that morning, I knew something was wrong. I woke up, sat straight up,tried calling her house and didn’t get an answer. Jumped in my car and went right over.DO YOU THINK YOUR FATHER TOLD HER EVERYTHING HE KNEW?I think they were both involved. Non-Human Implant?COULD YOU NOW UNFOLD THE POSSIBLE NON-HUMAN HYBRID LINK YOUSUSP E CT?When I was around 8 and we did a lot of traveling with Boeing to different countries, Dadwent on assignments – that’s what he called them. He would be gone for six months to ayear and come back. At one point, we were on Guam and Mom and Dad told me, ‘Wehave to go somewhere today. You’re not to talk about it.’So, we went on to the airbase and went to an office where armed military police escortedme, my Mom and Dad to another building. We went inside. I remember the sign on thedoor said something like ‘Armed Forces Intelligence Agency,’ or something like that.Dad went in and then they called Mom in and then they both came out and Mom told me Ihad a doctor’s appointment. We went to the doctor’s appointment, a Naval doctor, and heexamined me, ran some blood work and other tests. Then he said I had a tumor in my brainthat needed to be removed and they were going to do a new procedure where they wouldnot have to cut me from the outside. They would go in through my nasal cavity and as thedoctor explained it, ‘Cut the object into four pieces and bring it out through my nasalcavity.’I was pretty scared at that age of around 14 when I went into surgery. I remember brightlights. I have a really foggy memory, but it almost seemed like the same people were therethat were in my bedroom (when I was 8).THE BLONDS?Right.WERE YOUR PARENTS BLOND AND BLUE-EYED?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"No, my Dad had darker hair, kind of bald in the middle and a Caesar cut. He had hazeleyes. My Mom had dishwater blond hair and blue eyes.Anyway, I came out of surgery and everything was fine. They said they got what theywent after. I was in the Naval Hospital on Guam.WERE YOU IN A NAVAL HOSPITAL BECAUSE YOUR FATHER WAS WORKINGFOR THE NAVY?No, my Dad was supposedly a civilian contractor, so by all rights, I should have been inGuam Memorial Hospital.DID THAT PROVE THEN THAT YOUR FATHER ACTUALLY WORKED FOR THEMILITARY? OR MILITARY INTELLIGENCE?I later found out that even though he worked for Boeing, he also worked for the Army’sCounter Intelligence Corps (CIC) and apparently did some back-engineering of some type.ON NON-HUMAN TECHNOLOGY?Reverse engineering it, yes.IS IT ALSO POSSIBLE THAT HE WORKED FOR THE U. S. NAVY?Could have been, but the Navy doctor was flown in.JUST TO DO YOUR SURGERY?Yes, when I was 14.WHAT DID YOUR MOM AND DAD SAY TO YOU AFTER THE SURGERY?That it went really well and should never grow back and they got the object they weregoing for, the tumor. I had packing in my nose. When I looked in the mirror, I only hadtwo or three stitches. I was looking in the mirror trying to see where they did the cutting.There was a very clean cut.WHAT DID YOUR DAD SAY?He just kind of grinned and said, ‘Everything went fine.’A week later I had to go get the packing taken out at the Guam Memorial Hospital. Thesame doctor was there. He said there was about 25 yards of packing in there. He said itwas going to sound like a freight train when he took it out. There was a little piece hangingoutside my nose. He grabbed it and started pulling. It seemed like forever before the endcame out, but that was an experience!AT ANY POINT BEFORE YOUR MOM AND DAD DIED, DID YOU TALK WITHEITHER OF THEM FRANKLY ABOUT THEM REMOVING A NON-HUMANIMPLANT UP IN YOUR SINUS CAVITY?No, they always referred to it as a tumor. The paper work I have said I was operated on atGuam Memorial Hospital and they removed a tumor from the frontal lobe by goingthrough the sinus cavity using the Caldwell-Luc procedure.DO YOU THINK AN IMPLANT WAS REMOVED THAT THE BLOND BEINGS PUTIN WHEN YOU WERE 8?Yes, I do, because I do remember the doctor telling my Dad that they sent it off for tests toBethesda Naval Hospital. U. S. Military Collaboration with Non-Humans?WHEN DID IT DAWN ON YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT YOUR FATHER WASWORKING WITH THINGS NON-HUMAN AND YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKENFOR RESEARCH?I always felt different. One night I heard my Dad talking with some people he worked with– I wasn’t supposed to be up listening. But I heard someone ask Dad how I was comingalong and one of them asked, ‘Does he know anything about what’s going on?’Dad said, ‘No.’"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"When I asked him about hearing from a friend of one of Dad’s friends that I was adopted,he told me, ‘No, you’re not adopted. We’re your real Mom and Dad.’SO, HOW DO YOU PUT THAT ALL TOGETHER?My Mom had me when she was 43 when she got pregnant with me, which had the doctorsconcerned. But there were no problems with the pregnancy. So, I wonder if my Mom wasmy real birth mom? Or someone else was my father?OR YOU WERE AN IMPLANTED FOETUS?Yes, that’s what I was trying to say.DID YOUR FATHER EVER, BEFORE HE DIED, ACKNOWLEDGE THE TYPE OFNON-HUMANS THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN WORKING WITH? AND WHOWE'RE TRYING TO FIGHT IN AN EARTH'S SECRET WAR?No. He never would. I would bring up the subjects of UFOs when I got older and he justrefused to talk about it. Non-Humans Teaching Symbol LanguageSO, WHEN DID YOU COME INTO THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE SYMBOLS?That started after my Dad passed away.WHICH WAS?November 9, 1980. (27 years ago)SO, 27 YEARS AGO FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YOUR LIFE, WHAT HAPPENED?On several occasions I saw craft, like one that followed me for an hour.SHAPE AND COLOR?Two silver spheres. It was night time, so they were a blue-white glow with a cylindricalattachment between the two spheres. I was driving home from a date. We noticed them atthe light. We were out with a couple of other couples. One of the girls saw them. Theykept dipping down close to the lake. For some reason, all the kids were scared. We tookoff. The other two couples rode together and went down to one of their parents’ houses.My date wanted me to take her home to Andover, Kansas.Dumbbell-shaped aerial craftdrawn by Kansas abductee.On my way to Andover, I could see the lights. The spheres would separate. The cylindricalobject would pretty much stay in place, but the two balls would separate and dancearound. Then they would connect again. Dropped her off in Andover and then for the next45 minutes all the way to my house, it followed me. I got to the house and got out of mycar. It stopped over my house for a few seconds. Then in a matter of less than a second, itwas gone and out of sight – straight up!I told my Dad about it the next day and he said, ‘Oh, that’s nothing to worry about. Thosekinds of anomalies happen. You’re going to see them from time to time. But don’t worryabout them.’INTUITIVELY, WHAT DO YOU THINK? WAS IT TRACKING YOU TO YOURHOUSE?I think they always knew where I lived. I think they were checking in.BUT FOR WHAT REASON?I don’t know.T H AT WA S W H AT Y E A R ?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"That would have been around 1976.THIS IS BEFORE YOUR DAD PASSED?Ye s .WHAT IS THE NEXT EVENT THAT BEGINS TO FOCUS IN YOUR MIND THAT YOUARE DEALING WITH NON-HUMANS AND THEY ARE INTERESTED IN YOU?That happened around 1981. I was asleep and I woke up and there was this kind of mistaround.COLOR?White mist, just kind of hovering over the top of me. I got up.WHEN YOU GOT UP, DID THE MIST STAY AROUND YOU? OR DID THE MISTHANG OVER WHERE YOU HAD BEEN IN BED?When I woke up it was just over me and when I got up, it just kind of dissipated. And Iwas tired!

Drawing by Kansas abductee.Then a couple of nights later is when I was asleep and the next thing I remember is I wassitting in a concave chair. There’s an entity of some sort sitting to my left. Kind of adarkened room, but it’s lit – but not like with a light bulb. Then the next thing I know isthese panels start spinning – one to the right and one to the left. The panels would stopspinning and a symbol would light up. Then a hooded being would point at the lightedsymbol.YOU ARE SEATED IN FRONT OF THE TWO PANELS OF SYMBOLS.

THREE LONG FINGERS. WERE THEY EXTENDING OUT OFA BELL-SHAPED SLEEVE? OR WHAT?As I remember, it was sort of a bell-shaped sleeve, but not a dramatic bell.THE HOOD WAS COVERING WHAT KIND OF FACE?I never got a good look at the face. I got the feeling that he was moving the panels with hismind because he kept staring at the wall. I was in a completely round room and thesymbols were all the way around.DOUBLE ROWS OF SYMBOLS WENT AROUND THE ENTIRE CIRCULAR ROOM?Right. I could see them, but I could not make out definite shapes until they came aroundand it was almost like they were lit up from behind.DID YOU HAVE TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION WITH THE HOODED FIGUREABOUT EACH OF THE SYMBOLS THAT STOPPED AND IT POINTED AT?Ye s .WHAT WAS THAT TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION?‘You need to remember this.’WHAT COMES INTO YOUR MIND ABOUT WHAT YOU NEED TO REMEMBER?I don’t know, except it was important for me to remember, almost like I’m going to see itagain and when I do, it will all come together then. But right now, it’s just memories ofsymbols. Important symbols. But I don’t have any correlation of what they mean rightnow. Blonds, Greys, Lizards and Big-Nosed:What Is Their Relationship?DO YOU THINK THE BLONDS ARE DOING ONE THING WITH YOU AND GREYBEINGS ARE DOING ANOTHER?That I don’t know. I think I have been contacted by both.WHY WOULD THE BLONDS HAVE TO BE INSIDE A CLOAK?Right, the two times I’ve seen them, they’ve not been hooded.WHEN WAS THE NEXT DATE OF ENCOUNTER WITH THE BLUE-EYED BLONDS?That would have been not too long after – like in surgery, I could almost smell they werethere.THAT WAS AGE 14.Then we spent 4.5 years on Guam. Then I was on a camp out with the scouts. We were upon a mountain close to the WWII battleground, camping out. I had a little tent of my own.I woke up and a blond being was on each side of me. One female and one male again. Iremember that the male had some kind of device and the female – because that’s whatwoke me up – she had her hand on my forehead. Then again, she gave me that same smileand I got the feeling they were the same two in my room when I was 8. I was told againnot to worry, that I would be watched over. That’s the last time I saw them.WERE THEY DRESSED IN THE SAME METALLIC SILVER SUITS?"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"It was a metallic suit, but it looked different that time. The suit looked pretty much theway it fit, but it looked like there was a collar with an emblem on each side.WHAT DID IT LOOK LIKE?Shiny.SHAPE?Reminded me of like a triangle, with something real silver and bright in the center. Thesymbol itself was shiny, but the dot in the center was shinier.THERE WERE TWO METAL TRIANGLES, ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE COLLARON EACH ENTITY?Right.ANY SYMBOLS ON THE SUITS?It looked like there might have been something there, almost like a breast plate.HOW OLD WERE YOU THEN?I must have been 16.SINCE AGE 16 ON GUAM, YOU HAVE NEVER HAD ANOTHER MEMORABLEENCOUNTER WITH THE BLOND NON-HUMANS?Right.WHEN IS YOUR NEXT ENCOUNTER WITH ANYTHNG NON-HUMAN?That would be in the ship with the symbols.AND YOU DON’T KNOW IF THE BEING WAS BLOND OR GREY?Right.AND THAT WAS IN 1980 TO 1981?Yes, around then.
