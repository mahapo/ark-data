Photographed Again Over Capitola, California.Return to: Letters About Unidentified \"Drone\" Aerial Objects. May 25, 2007 Sequoia National Park, California, and Birmingham, Alabama - As theintensity has risen this week to explain away the Lake Tahoe, Capitola and CentralCalifornia Chad images as Photoshop and/or \"viral promotional films,\" I have intervieweda California resident who worked for the state government in the Department ofDevelopmental Services in mental health for twenty-five years before recently retiring in2006. Shirley was born in Ventura County, California, and earned her PsychiatricTechnician degree from Ventura Community College in 1978. I have her full address,contact information and academic background, but she has applied to work in another stateagency, so has asked to simply be identified as Shirley from the Central Valley ofCalifornia. She does not want the chaos surrounding the images to affect her newemployment. But she wanted the public to know that the Chad photos match adragonfly-like aerial object she saw two years ago.In May 2005, she went on a weekend trip with her father to visit Sequoia National Park.Shirley and her father were near the center of the large Sequoia park and monument wherethey had planned to camp. But Shirley began feeling nauseous with a bad headache anddecided she needed to go home and rest. It was late afternoon between 3 to 5 PM, whenshe realized she was lost and did not know what road to take out of the park. She hadstopped at a park ranger station to ask a uniformed ranger for directions when she was"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"shocked to see what looked like a big dragonfly moving in the sky. When Shirley sawChad’s photos at Earthfiles.com and the Coast to Coast AM website, she recognized theobject as what she had seen.Interview: May 2005, Sequoia National Park,Tulare County, CaliforniaRed dots mark on far right, the Sequoia National Park and and far left, Capitola, California,both locations of the aerial \"drone.\" Other reported locations are in Lake Tahoe andCentral California further south towards Bakersfield, and Birmingham, Alabama.See other maps in More Information below.Shirley, Retired California Department of Developmental Services Mental HealthTechnician, Central Valley, California: “It was around May of 2005. And we had gottenlost about what road to take out of the Sequoias to get back on the right road headinghome. I told my dad (now deceased), ‘Pull over. I’m going to talk with the Park Rangerand see if he can help us.’Came over talking to this ranger. And while talking, this weird thing flew overhead. Neverseen anything like it in my whole life!I asked the Park Ranger, ‘What is that?’ And he very casually just went, ‘Oh, yeah, I’mtold it’s some kind of communications device. It’s supposed to help the Park Service to"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"monitor any possible problems like fires and such.’ That was pretty much his totalexplanation of what it was.CAN YOU GIVE AS MANY DETAILS AS POSSIBLE?What I saw that struck me right off the bat was that it had a shape like nothing I’ve everseen. The body of the thing looked to be like a circle, like a metal circle, but the threethings body-shape wise that made it look so weird was the shape itself, for lack of a betterdescription, reminded me of a dragonfly. It had an extended – I’ll call it an ‘arm,’ a thinextension at the back. A circular body. It had three or four shorter extensions that lookedlike they were between the side of the thing and the front of the thing. And it had theseweird like wires that were coming out of the top of the thing, but you could tell that theywere bent. They weren’t straight. They were like curving. I had never seen anything shapedlike that before that was flying around.The second thing about it was just the way it moved. I mean, at first I thought it remindsme of a helicopter. But it had a much smoother, quicker movement to it that what I’ve seenin any helicopter.The third thing is when I spotted it again later – we stopped to get directions again becausewe were still lost even after talking to the park ranger – and we pulled over and talked withone of the road crews that were out there. They were doing a lot of road repair. That’swhen I saw the thing again and it was off further in the distance by that time. But it didgive me a better chance to look at the way the thing itself moved. That’s when I could seethat at one point the thing backed up. And that’s when I said, ‘Oh, look, it can gobackwards just like a dang helicopter!’ Then it just kind of reversed itself again and headedoff in another direction and I thought, ‘Well, that’s a nifty contraption.’Like a dragonfly, the way they are able to kind of hover and they’ve got real mobility, likewhatever direction they are going to point themselves at, they are going go with noproblem. The thing did not move anything like an airplane. It had mobility closer to whatI’ve seen in a helicopter. That’s the only other thing I can liken it to in that kind ofmobility. But it had a smoother move to it. It had a quicker, smoother move than what I’veseen with a helicopter. Sequoia Aerial \"Drone\" Most CloselyMatched Chad PhotosOF THE IMAGES THAT HAVE BEEN SHARED NOW ON EARTHFILES AND COASTTO COAST AM AND OTHER WEBSITES FROM LAKE TAHOE, FROM CHAD INCENTRAL CALIFORNIA AND FROM THE CAPITOLA, CALIFORNIA, IMAGES,WHICH IMAGE SEEMS THE VERY CLOSEST TO WHAT YOU SAW IN MAY OF2005?Oh, no doubt about that – the Chad photos. The Chad photos are just about exactly what Isaw that day in the (Sequoia) park.THE OTHERS ARE DIFFERENT IN WHAT WAY?The Capitola photos, which I hadn’t looked at until last night, right away I’m going: what isthat thing that is sticking out from the side of the circular main body? I don’t rememberapertures sticking out of the side of what I saw that day and frankly, I did not notice themin the pictures Chad took either.CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE MOTION. WHICH PART OF THIS SEEMED TO BEGOING FORWARD – THE RING? OR THE LONG TAIL?I recall the longest extension (tail) moving like it was the tail of this craft, again much likewhen you see a dragonfly move. I mean, a dragonfly does not move with its tail to the frontof it. No, its tail follows it. That’s how I recall.WHAT ABOUT THE COLORS IN CHAD’S PHOTOGRAPHS COMPARED TO WHATYOU REMEMBER?Yeah, the colors looked right on – just kind of a buff gray (not shiny).COULD YOU SEE ANY LETTERS, NUMBERS OR WHAT APPEARS TO BEDESIGNS?No, I didn’t.FROM WHERE YOU WERE, HOW HIGH WOULD YOU ESTIMATE THIS OBJECT"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"WAS ABOVE THE TREES AND HOW BIG WAS IT?If I just extend my arm straight out in front of me and used my fingers as an indication forhow large that thing appeared in the sky, I’d say it looked about as large as in between myfirst (index) finger and my thumb.I wish I could say that was 150 feet or 300 feet (altitude) or whatever, but I just don’tknow. I can tell you that where we were at, anyone knows the Sequoias are a very highelevation. So obviously it was flying a whole lot higher that day in the Sequoias than it wasin anything that has been photographed since.IN TERMS OF ANY ELECTROSTATIC HUMMING SOUND LIKE CHADDESCRIBED?Oh, I didn’t hear a thing.THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENT IF THE OBJECT WAS HIGHER ABOVE YOU THANIT WAS ABOVE CHAD.Oh, yeah. I’m positive it was higher than how it appears in Chad’s pictures. Could Sequoia Park RangerAlso Work for Black \"Drone\" Agency?WHEN YOU THINK BACK TO THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU STOPPED TO ASK THESEQUOIA PARK RANGER FOR DIRECTIONS AND THIS OBJECT MOVING IN THESKY SO ODDLY CATCHES YOUR ATTENTION, AND YOU ASK THE PARKRANGER, ‘WHAT IS THAT?’ DID HE LOOK UP?I don’t recall him looking up. I can recall him answering the question – he did not appear tobe trying to hide anything or did not seem to be the least bit surprised to be asked about it.No, I don’t remember him pausing and focusing on what I was asking about.AS IF HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT WAS THERE?Yeah.ISN’T THAT PECULIAR SINCE NOT ANY OF THE REST OF US IN THE WORLD SOFAR – NO ONE HAS COME FORWARD TO SAY, ‘I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THATIS’?Yeah, now it does seem strange. But back then at the time, I didn’t have anything to makeme think how strange it was that he didn’t even look at it. At the time, his reaction justdidn’t seem like – it didn’t set off any alarm bells.BUT WHEN YOU SAW THE CHAD PHOTOS AT COAST TO COAST ANDEARTHFILES. COM, WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND IMMEDIATELY?When I looked at them, I just went, ‘Wow, I remember that thing!’ I just thought, ‘Wow,isn’t that interesting! We just keep coming up with better and better technology.’ That’shonestly what I thought that day (laughs). I was impressed. I walked away thinking, ‘Hownifty. Isn’t our government amazing? We’re just coming up with bigger and better things allthe time.’ That’s honestly what I thought and all that I thought. I didn’t walk away thinking,‘Oh, what are they trying to hide?’AND THAT’S BECAUSE THE SEQUOIA PARK RANGER DISMISSED IT SOCASUALLY, RIGHT?Absolutely! If he had looked startled or had fumbled like people do some times when youcatch them off guard and they don’t expect to be questioned about something. But no, hisdemeanor was nothing like that. He didn’t act like it was anything to be concerned about.He didn’t act like he was trying to hide anything. He didn’t act like he was trying to comeup with a good story. Nothing like that. Sequoia Park Ranger Public Officials Deny Any Knowledgeof \"Drone\" Aerial ObjectBUT NOW I HAVE COMMUNICATIONS WITH PARK RANGERS SUCH AS THISEMAIL:"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"‘I have been a park ranger for 30 years and I have never seen or heard of sucha device. The park service can barely afford regular helicopters, much lesshighly secret craft like this.’Carol McElheney, Sacramento County Park Rangers[ Editor's Note: I also contacted Alexandra Picavet in Public Information inthe United States Department of Interior Sequoia National Park Rangersoffice. We discussed the images and Earthfiles reports and with her request, Isent her 05/15/07 Earthfiles for her official comment.Since two federal agencies manage the park, Alexandra Picavet also asked meto contact Denise Alonzo, Tule River District, U.

I did, had the same discussion and alsosent to her 05/15/07 Earthfiles for her official comment.Within a day by phone, Denise Alonzo told me neither she nor anyone in heroffice had any knowledge or information about the object in the photos. Todate, after repeated phone voice mail and email requests for comment byAlexandra Picavet, I have not received any further communication.] IF A PARK RANGER WOULD TALK TO YOU SO CASUALLY ABOUT AN OBJECTIN THE SKY THAT NONE OF US HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE, THEN DOESN’T ITMEAN THAT HE IS PRIVY TO INFORMATION THAT NO ONE ELSE IS PRIVY TO?THAT RAISES ANOTHER QUESTION IN MY MIND: WAS HE A SEQUOIA PARKRANGER ALSO DOING DOUBLE DUTY FOR ANOTHER AGENCY OR THEMILITARY?You know, Linda, yeah - all I had to go by was what I was told. You know what, anythingis possible, Linda.WHEN YOU SEE ALL OF THE CONTROVERSY ABOUT THE IMAGES, THAT THEYMUST BE PHOTOSHOPPED, WHAT IS YOUR COMMENT TO VIEWERS ANDLISTENERS?Well, I can tell you right now that what I saw that day – that was not a Photoshop! I mean,I saw that in the real world!”[ Updated Editor's Note: See More Information below about Beale AFB andChina Lake Naval Weapons Center.Short CGI creation animated Chad object in a military environment, anexample of what can be done with digital manipulation.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRv3WAEnHMcBut the brief CGI demonstration does not contradict in any way the two solideyewitness reports in this Earthfiles and the Chad photos.

Photo by Mr. Smith.\"I took this picture sometime in May of 2006 in a residential section ofBirmingham, Alabama, where I had some business. The camera was a CanonDigital Camera. I was looking at some new construction when I heard a lowbuzzing sound like a transformer. I looked around and finally up. I saw whatlooked like an electrical device sticking out of the electrical pole. When Imoved to get a better look, the thing seemed to be floating. I decided this wasan optical effect and thought that it was probably attached to the wires andwas some sort of device being used at the construction. I took a picture andthen walked away to get someone to tell me what it was. When I looked back,it was gone. The time was around 3:00 PM, I think. It was strange, but I didnot want to get involved in anything, so I let it go.\"I remembered the device when I saw the photo on Coast to Coast WebPage.That is all I know, except one other odd thing that same day. I saw twoidentical new pickup trucks with new box-like trailers behind them near theconstruction site. The trailers were like small mobile homes with thick wiresrunning from them. The trucks and trailers looked oddly new and clean withno markings on them at all. One truck was black with a white trailer and onewas white with a white trailer. They really looked odd. Dodge ram trucks, Ithink. They stood out at the dusty site. I don't know if they had any connectionwith the device, but it stuck in my head for some reason.\" On May 25, 2007, Mr. Smith wrote:\"Thanks for your interest.
