Two years laterin 1612, the great Italian physicist, astronomer and philosopher, Galileo Galilei (February15, 1564 – January 8, 1642) made sketches of mysterious dark spots on the sun andpublished them in a 1613 book entitled Istoria e Dimostrazioni Intorno Alle MacchieSolari e LoroAccidenti Rome (History and Demonstrations Concerning Sunspots and their Properties)."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"In 1612 during the summer months, Galileo made a series of sunspot observationswhich were published in Istoria e Dimostrazioni Intorno Alle Macchie Solari e LoroAccidenti Rome (History and Demonstrations Concerning Sunspots and their Properties)published in 1613.

At those \"spots,\" which can bemuch larger than Earth, those strong magnetic anomalies slow down the sun’s convectioncurrent, which normally stirs hot gas from deep inside the sun up to the surface.

Big flares propel a solar wind of ionized particles, or plasmas, into the solarsystem at speeds of 2 million miles an hour or more! (300 to 1200 kilometers per second).Strong magnetic storms can hurt astronauts in space and damage satellites. Solar stormscan overwhelm and damage our electric power grids and other electromagnetic equipmenton Earth and interfere with airplanes over the poles and transmissions in radio andtelevision. The ionized gases from strong storms on the sun also collide with ionospheregases in our polar atmospheres, which then glow in beautiful greens, reds, blues andviolets. That's the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights. The power of the solar wind can beso great that Northern Lights can equal one million megawatts of electricity.Arc of glowing plasma in Earth's ionosphere over Canadaand northern United States on December 14, 2006, after Sunspot 930unleashed a series of powerful X-Class flares between December 5 - 14, 2006.Image by U.

The Solar Minimum is when the sun should be most calmwithout sunspots. But in December between the 5th and 14th, a large sunspot called \"930\"unleashed a series of powerful X-Class flares - the strongest class of sun storms. X-Classflares are ten times more powerful than M-Class flares and the Ms are ten times morepowerful than the C-Class flares.[ Editor's Note: Solar flares are classified as A, B, C, M or X according to thepeak flux (in watts per square meter, W/m2) of 100 to 800 picometer X-raysnear Earth, as measured on the GOES spacecraft. Each class has a peak flux"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"ten times greater than the preceding one, with X class flares having a peakflux of order 10-4 W/m2. Within a class there is a linear scale from 1 to 9, soan X2 flare is twice as powerful as an X1 flare, and is four times morepowerful than an M5 flare. The more powerful M and X class flares are oftenassociated with a variety of effects on the near-Earth space environment.]Throughout this 23rd solar cycle, there have been surprisingly strong bursts of X-Flares.One was so strong in the last solar maximum that it went off the charts and scientistsdubbed it “the Biggest Solar X-Ray Flare on Record - X20.\" That historic X-20 flareerupted on April 2, 2001. That solar wind roared into space at nearly 5 million miles anhour. The Earth was lucky that day because that coronal mass ejection missed our planet.If it had hit us directly, power grids and satellites would probably have been damaged.Several thousand satellites now revolve around the world providing entertainment,communications, environmental data, military and intelligence monitoring and much more.All these satellites represent billions of dollars and invaluable data to Earth nations. If thiscoming Solar Maximum 24 - which should reach its peak between 2010 and 2012 - isreally strong, some of those satellites could be damaged. Satellite owners are impatientnow for a space weather forecast of what's coming - Intense? Or mild?Recently on December 21, 2006, NASA issued a news release entitled \"Scientists PredictBig Solar Cycle.\" The lead paragraph said, \"Solar Cycle 24 looks like it's going to be one ofthe most intense cycles since record-keeping began almost 400 years ago.\" So I called upDr. David Hathaway, Solar Physics Team Leader at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center inHuntsville, Alabama, and asked him if Solar Cycle 24 has started yet and why it's expectedto be so strong. I was surprised to learn that despite the NASA headline, the sun is givingoff mixed signals that are confounding astrophysicists in their predictions.Interview:David Hathaway, Ph. D., Solar Physics Team Leader, NASA Marshall Space FlightCenter, Huntsville, Alabama: “We haven’t seen the first spot of the new cycle, butwe’ve seen indications that new cycle spots are getting ready to form. One looked like itwas a spot, but it appeared while it was on the backside of the sun, the far side of the sun,and by the time it rotated around to our side, the spot had disappeared, but it’s magneticremains were still there. So, it does look like the new cycle is starting, but we’re stillwaiting to see the first spot that is unquestionably a spot for the new cycle. Geomagneticdisturbances in the last two or three years tell us that the next cycle ought to be a big cycle- one of the largest on record.HOW WILL YOU KNOW? WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR?Two things we look for:1) One is the magnetic polarity. The magnetic polarities flip from one cycle to the next.And from one hemisphere to the other. So, we should see that the magnetic polarities areflipped: north to south and south to north. But we’ve already seen some of those.2) The other key ingredient is that it needs to be a spot at a fairly high latitude, usuallyabove 25 degrees. Sometimes there are first spots of the new cycle that appear as low as20 degrees, but all the reverse polarity spots we’ve seen thus far have been low latitude. Infact there is one on the sun today that’s at about 3 degrees and that’s far too low for it tobe a spot related to the next cycle. Confusing Sun Signals WHAT DO YOU EXPECT, BASED ON HISTORIC DATA, FOR HOW THIS SOLARMAXIMUM WILL UNFOLD?It’s a little confusing this time around, actually. We haven’t had this problem before, butthere are a number of indicators we can look at related to sunspots and solar activity thatgive us an idea ahead of time about how big the cycle is going to be. Indicators (of bigsolar maximums) that have agreed and worked in the past don’t agree this time.One thing we look at is geomagnetic activity – this is shaking of the Earth’s magnetic field,which is caused by two different things on the sun. One, is flaring activity and what we callcoronal mass ejections (CMEs) – these huge clouds of material that are blasted off of thesun at more than a million miles an hour. If they travel through the solar system and hit theEarth, they are stopped by our magnetic field and the CMEs shakes our magnetic field andwe can see that on the ground. We have seen those variations in the Earth’s magnetic fieldfor more than 150 years now."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Another source is high-speed wind coming off of the sun. What we found in the past is thatthe level of that activity one or two years before the Solar Minimum is a good indicator ofhow big the next cycle is going to be. It’s as if the sun is already building up its magneticfields and starting to let loose with things early on. That activity says the next Solar MaxCycle 24 is going to be big.But another thing we look at is how strong the magnetic fields are at the poles of the sun.This time around – and we’ve only been able to do that for the last 30 years, so we onlyhave three cycles of that. But those fields have been very weak this time. The poles on thesun are very weak now. That suggests that the next Solar Max cycle is going to be small. Space Weather Models Predict Big Solar Cycle 24The one new tool we have this time around are models, much like meteorologists have forpredicting weather on the Earth. We now have models for how the sun makes magneticfields, makes sunspots in the sunspot cycle. Those models are telling us that this nextcoming cycle is going to be big.So, we’ve got a bit of a problem this time trying to sort out why in particular the sun’smagnetic fields are staying weak and say Solar Max Cycle 24 will be small and quiet, whileother data are indicating it’s going to be a big Cycle 24. We need to sort that out asscientists within the next few months, hopefully, before the cycle gets started. There arepeople who really need to know how big this next cycle is going to be.BECAUSE?Because of its influence on all of our stuff in space. So satellites in space are influenced bysolar activity. Their orbits, how long they stay up. For the ones in lower Earth orbit, thereis enough of the Earth’s atmosphere up there that they slowly spiral in. If we have a bigsolar cycle, it heats up the Earth’s outermost atmosphere and makes it puff up a bit. So,those satellites will de-orbit, or come down, quicker than normal. So, people who havespent millions and billions of dollars putting those satellites up there are very concernedabout how big the next cycle is going to be.The size of the next Solar Max also influences communications here on the ground – fromlong-range radio communications to telephones, particularly cell phone systems that usesatellites. GPS (global positioning) uses satellites. All of those are influenced by how bigthe next Solar Max cycle is. Could Solar Cycle 24 Be Strongest in 400 Years?IN YOUR DECEMBER 21ST NASA ARTICLE, IT SAYS THIS COULD BE THESTRONGEST SOLAR MAXIMUM IN 400 YEARS OF RECORD KEEPING. IF THATTURNS OUT TO BE THE CASE, WHAT ARE THE WORST THINGS THAT CANHAPPEN?Worst thing that can happen is that we would loose some satellites prematurely. There areproblems for astronauts in space. In fact, the flares that occurred a week or two or go wereenough to impact the outside activity by astronauts at the International Space Station(ISS). It can influence airline flights here on the Earth and in particular, polar flights thatgo over the Earth’s poles. They can be without communications during big events and bigcycles. So, those planes have to take longer routes at more expense to get from Europe tothe Americas, for instance.IN A STRONG SOLAR MAXIMUM, IF IT IS SO STRONG, WHAT WOULD YOUEXPECT TO BE HAPPENING?We’d see many more flares, more CMEs. Here on Earth, we would see more auroras,displays of the Northern Lights that are caused by solar eruptions messing around with theEarth’s magnetic fields. There could be communication outages. There could even beelectrical outages. CMEs shaking the Earth’s magnetic field can cause a surge ofelectricity through power lines. We had a big outage back in March of 1989, which tookout power to the Province of Quebec. Some people were without power for six days. Itliterally fried a transformer in New Jersey that cost $10 million. There are a number ofthings like that, which can happen during times of extreme solar activity."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"X-FlaresSunspot 798, the source of this looping X-17 flare,has an impressive magnetic field. Image © 2005 by Jack Newtonof Osoyoos, British Columbia, Canada.WHAT IS THE LARGEST X-FLARE REPORTED SO FAR?The largest was during this current solar minimum cycle. It went off our charts. We hadbeen measuring the x-rays from the sun in flares using NOAA’s weather satellites for about30 years now. There was one within the last three or four years that - our most energeticclass of solar flares are called ‘X-Class flares.’ They are usually X-1 through X-10. Wedidn’t have a class higher than that. But this one was pegged at an X-20 or something likethat. It basically went off the scale and we need a letter after X like a Y or something likethat to describe these! It was more than ten times bigger than most X-Class flares.Now that we’ve had a flare that was ten times bigger than the normal X-Class flare, thebest we could do was say it’s an X-15 or X-20 or something like that. That describes theenergy in the flare.DO YOU THINK THERE COULD POSSIBLY BE A LOT OF X-20S BETWEEN NOWAND 2012 IF YOUR PREDICTIONS ARE CORRECT?I wouldn’t say a lot of the X-20s, but certainly if it’s going to be a big cycle, we’ll see a lotof X-Class flares. That’s been our experience in the past. As the number of sunspotsincrease, the number of flares increase as well, along with the size of them. The size –because you get more of them, there are more X-Class flares in the mix. But as we’ve seenrecently, you can still get X-Class flares even when we’re down to one or two sunspots onthe sun.IF THERE WERE A LOT OF X-FLARES IN A REALLY INTENSE SOLARMAXIMUM, HOW OFTEN WOULD THEY OCCUR, DO YOU THINK?During an intense solar maximum, you have many X-Class flares per month. But near solarminimum, we can go many months or even years without an X-Class flare. So at solarmaximum, there are several per month we would see.IF THERE ARE SEVERAL PER MONTH AND WE HAVE ALL THE SATELLITES,THEN IT DOES BECOME A CRITICAL PROBLEM.Yes, because one big flare if the situation is right can destroy electronic elements onsatellites. Also, just the number of sunspots accumulated in the cycle is enough that theEarth’s upper atmosphere puffs out and causes some satellites to slowly spiral in. Therewill be more satellite outages and the services those satellites provide will be interruptedbecause of it.That’s why we need to get the prediction better. What can be done is when you launch asatellite, if you’re launching a satellite now, you would launch it into a higher altitude orbitso it can stay up longer and you would add more radiation hardening to its components toprotect it as well.On the other hand, if it’s not going to be a big cycle, then you don’t need to spend themillions of dollars involved in doing that. Again, as far as the satellite industry isconcerned, knowing how big the next solar max cycle is going to be is critical. It coststhem money either way if the predictions are wrong. Puzzle of Weak Magnetic Solar PolesHAS THERE EVER BEEN THIS CONFUSION BEFORE ABOUT THE WEAKMAGNETIC POLES VERSUS YOUR OTHER INDICATORS?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"No, and that’s why we’re in a bit of quandary now and why many scientists that areactively trying to get to the bottom of it. For the last two cycles, at least, where we’ve hadpanels come together to look at the different predictions and different techniques, thetechniques that we’ve found to be reliable – and two of these are the geomagneticprecursors, things that come before the cycle starts – and the polar magnetic fields. Thosehave agreed fairly well the last two times. But this time, they disagree. We need tounderstand why. The sun’s telling us something and we’ve got to figure it out. Four Biggest Solar Cycles Since 1950s -Any Connection to Global Warming?IT APPEARS THAT AT LEAST FOUR OF THE BIGGEST SOLAR CYCLES HAVE ALLCOME IN THE LAST 50 YEARS. WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT MEANS?It means the sun has been very active. There have been researchers that have suggestedthat the sun has been more active now than it’s been in thousands of years.IN THAT ACTIVITY, IS THERE AN INCREASE IN SOLAR ENERGY THAT COULDEXPLAIN GLOBAL WARMING AND EVEN HEATING ON MARS?Certainly, there is a correlation between solar activity and surface temperature on Earth.Most scientist agree there is a connection between the two, but it looks like the sun canonly be responsible for a fraction of the warming we’re seeing and cannot be – the recentrise in global average temperature cannot be attributed to solar activity.But as you said, the biggest solar cycles on record have been the last few. That hascontributed some to the global warming problem.IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT THE ENERGY FROM THE SUN HAS BEEN INCREASING?The energy output has. It seems a little contradictory, but when we have active cycles andlots of sunspots – although the sunspots are dark, all the other activity makes the sunbrighter. So, the sun is brighter during big solar cycles than it is during small cycles and it isbrighter at solar maximum than it is at solar minimum.IS THERE A DIRECT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BRIGHTNESS AND THE ENERGYTHAT REACHES THE EARTH AND HEATS IT?Yes, there is. But again, the direct heating from the brightness of the sun is only aboutone-tenth of one percent, so it’s a small change. The people who model the Earth’sclimate, when they add that in there – 1/10th% change in brightness over a ten year period– they have a hard time reproducing the temperature changes that are seen, other thannoting when the sun has been active in periods of activity like we are now, surfacetemperature (of the Earth) seems to be warmer.[ Editor's Note: A 2006 study and review of existing literature, published inNature, determined that there has been no net increase in brightness since themid- 1970s, and that changes in solar output within the past 400 years areunlikely to have played a major part in global warming.]HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT’S GOING TO BE BEFORE YOU REALLY KNOWHOW BIG THIS MAXIMUM MIGHT BE?I would say within the next two years we will know. Or sooner than that. The next cyclehas been slow in starting. We haven’t seen the official first spot of a new cycle, althoughwe’ve seen indicators that there might have been new cycle spots on the backside of thesun, but by the time the sun rotated around the spots, they disappeared and left behindtheir magnetic remains.But once a Solar Max cycle gets started, how fast it starts rising, how fast it starts makingmore and more sunspots, is a very good indicator of how big the cycle is going to be. Sowe should know within two or three years how big this next cycle is going to be. It oughtto reach a maximum in 2011.\"More Information:For further information about solar cycles, please see the Earthfiles Archives below:• 08/23/2006 -- Solar Cycle 24 - Headed for Intense X Flares by 2010-2012?• 11/18/2005 -- Is the Sun Heating Up?"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"• 09/29/2005 -- 2005 Arctic Summer Ice Melt - Largest On Record• 09/23/2005 -- 9 X-Class Solar Flares Between September 7 - 19, 2005.• 02/11/2005 -- Sunspot Region 720 Emitted Strongest Solar Radiation Since October 1989• 01/03/2005 -- Abrupt Climate Change 5,200 Years Ago; Mayan/Aztec Calendar Links• 10/29/2003 -- Fifth Intense Solar X-Flare - What's Happening On the Sun?• 07/16/2003 -- First 3-D Images of the Sun's Granular Surface• 02/01/2003 -- Brainerd, Minnesota's Mysterious Lake Water That Won't Freeze• 10/29/2003 -- Fifth Intense Solar X-Flare - What's Happening On the Sun?• 10/25/1999 -- A Blast of Solar Wind Provokes Aurora Over Northern U.
