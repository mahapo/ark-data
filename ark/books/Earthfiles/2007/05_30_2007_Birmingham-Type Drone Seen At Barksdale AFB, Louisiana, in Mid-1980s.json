May 30, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Today, I received the following email from aprofessional engineer who has requested anonymity. He is confident that the dragonfly-shaped aerial object photographed by \"Mr. Smith\" in Birmingham, Alabama, in May 2006,is nearly identical to an approximately 25-foot-long \"display model\" in a Barksdale AFB,Louisiana, air show he attended on or about 1987.May 30, 2007, E-mail from professional engineer who has requested anonymity:\"Dear Linda,I've been studying the various images of theseodd aerial drones, when the latest picture postedfrom Birmingham, Alabama, (below) caughtmy attention.Odd, aerial object above power poles near construction site in May 2006,in Birmingham, Alabama. Photo by Mr. Smith."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"\"I was immediately overcome with the damnedest feelingthat I had seen this EXACT drone before, but not inthe air---instead, ON THE GROUND and UP CLOSE. Andto top it off, this was around twenty or more yearsago. I had long since forgotten about it.I thought I had seen it in some sort of static displayor something, with people around it...then I remembered:I saw this thing in a hangar at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana,at one of the open house air shows around twenty or soyears ago (1987?). It was a static display (mounted on a dollyor cart), and there were people around it (that is, somevisitors to the air show).It was a display by some major aerospace contractor. Iforget who.A number of us had wandered into the open hangar and werejust standing there, looking at it, and at some of theother displays (some air-to-air missiles, I think). Therewere about three or four hangars with public displays, andthis one, or so we all thought, was one of them.I do have a vague recollection of somebody 'official'coming out there and telling a couple of the Air Forceguys that the unit wasn't supposed to be out on PUBLICdisplay (i.e., apparently it was meant for display toMILITARY PERSONNEL ONLY), and that they needed to getit put out of sight.The military guys then ran everybody (including me) outof the hangar, and closed the doors.There was even a brochure, but I recall only that I mayhave picked it up briefly and looked at it, then put itback down. It had an artist's rendering of the unit ondisplay. Unfortunately, I don't have the brochure.I don't remember what the thing was called, but it wassome kind of surveillance or intelligence gatheringdrone. I wasn't that interested in it at the time,just idly curious. (It might have been some sort of'concept development' at that time, and maybe didn'teven work yet. I don't recall.)I didn't see why they thought they had to run us outof the hangar, but, of course, I respected their notionof 'security.' (I didn't see what the big deal wasabout some funny-looking ring-gadget with a 'wing.'I suppose I must have thought it was supposed to besome kind of satellite for watching the Russians.)Apparently, these beasts DO exist, EVEN IF somebody didsome PhotoShop pictures of similar devices. Then again,maybe it's some Government or military whistleblower'sidea of a 'security leak' about something that they thinkhas (for some unknown reason?) become a threat of somesort?Now, let me recap some observations about these 'drones'from the 'Chad' and 'Lake Tahoe' series of pictures:(1) The writing on the 'wing' does NOT exactly matchany known fictional language, such as Star Wars 'aurek-besh'or Star Trek 'klingon.' (Only ONE character, 'resh,' was even close,either right side up OR upside down, and that's probablyjust an accident of design.)(2) The drone appears to come in at least three differentconfigurations (and now four, with the Birmingham photo,which moreover looks like possibly an 'older model').(3) These craft seem to operate exclusively in areas"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"surrounded by federally controlled national forests.(4) The drones in some of the 'Chad' photos appear tohave a high-flying unidentified aerial object above them.(5) The drones appear to be searching for something,or possibly monitoring something.(6) The drones appear to be utilizing Biefield-Browntype propulsion, although this may be only part ofthe propulsive capability.(7) There are sixteen 'electrodes' on the top of thecircular section, and sixteen smaller 'electrodes' onthe inner part of the circular section. Moreover,the smaller 'electrodes' appear to mount inlinedevices of some sort (diodes? capacitors?).(8) The shape of the top electrode array probablyprovides a field gradient that increases liftingefficiency.Anything else at this point is sheer speculation.The three different configurations (two of which areleft-right mirrored configurations with respect to theapparent 'cooling wing,' and the other of which uses asecond large 'wing' or sensor array, and is otherwisesymmetrical in arrangement), together with the diversepicture sources, would suggest that the craft photosprovided may well be genuine, other factors not with-standing (i.e., photo analysts have fooled themselvesbefore).I have personally examined the Birmingham photo inMS Paint (admittedly not the best way, but paste-insCAN be detected under magnification), and I found noobvious evidence of paste-in work or other PhotoShopfakery. The Birmingham photo appears to be REAL. Inaddition, it EXACTLY MATCHES the unit I saw on displayat the Barksdale Air Show as discussed above.\"Return to 05/15/07: Odd Aerial \"Drone?\" Over Lake Tahoe and Central CaliforniaReturn to 05/16/07: Engineer Comments About Odd Aerial \"Drone?\" Earthfiles.Return to 05/16/07: Odd Aerial \"Drone\"?
