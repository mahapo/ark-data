Ring boundary of ejectaaround hole measured between 13.3 to 13.8 meters in diameter. Crater depthfrom surface to groundwater estimated about 2 meters (7 feet).October 11, 2007 Tucson, Arizona - I had hoped by now to have the final lab analysis onthe water and soil at the Carancas, Peru, meteorite impact site. But Dr. Jose Machare, thegeologist at Peru’s Ingemmet geological institute in Lima, has been gone since September29th, won’t be back in his office until October 15th and no one at Ingemmet to date hasprovided a final lab report. When I last talked with Dr. Machare on September 28th, hewas still saying that the National Geographic, New York Times and NASA’sSpaceweather.com reports about a dense deposit of arsenic at the impact site were nottrue, or at least, not confirmed by Ingemmet analysis.After the meteorite slammed into the Carancas plateau and created a 26-foot-wide crateron the morning of September 15th, some local residents described seeing water in thecrater “boil” with a bad smell and complained afterward that they got sick. So, what is inthe crater water and soil?Since Ingemmet has not released analysis, I contacted meteorite-hunter Michael Farmer inTucson, Arizona. On September 29th, Michael arrived in Carancas, Peru, to see for himselfexactly what was there. Michael says he first went to the police station for directions tothe crater and that every policeman had pieces of the meteorite in their pockets and soldMichael some samples. Michael also purchased meteorite fragments from farmers in avillage near the crater."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Carancas, Peru, on September 29, 2007. Michael Farmer (green jacket) with his colleague,Moritz Karl (3rd from left) stand with local Carancas police at edge of meteorite crater.Image © 2007 by Michael Farmer.Then, he says, the Carancas police got upset because they decided they wanted more thanthe $100 per rock that Michael said he paid. So, Michael decided he better get out of Peruquickly to avoid being put in jail by greedy law enforcement. So he fled to Bolivia andback to Tucson. After that, the police denied they sold meteorite fragments to MichaelFarmer.Michael estimates the Carancas meteorite could be as much as 10 tons, “probably thelargest chondrite meteorite to have fallen” to Earth in modern times.[ Editor’s Note: There are two types of stony meteorites, Chondrites andAchondrites. Chondrite is a type of meteorite containing mineral spherescalled chondrules. Most chondrites are believed to originate in the asteroidsthat orbit the Sun between Jupiter and Mars. Chondrites contain between 2%and 21% iron-nickel metal. A chondrule is a millimeter-sized mineral spherefound in stony chondrite meteorites. Chondrules are formed by re-melting ofmineral grains in the solar nebula. Achondrite is a class of meteorites that donot have chondrules. Achondrites are formed by igneous processes on or nearthe surface of larger asteroids or planets.]Michael cannot believe that Peruvian scientists did not get equipment to dig down throughthe water and remove whatever is there. Meanwhile, all that water which has still not beenpumped out of the crater could be dissolving the stony meteorite’s fragile rock. Michaelconfirmed for me that all the fragments he brought out of Peru are breccia and he isdistributing on his own to meteorite scientists for analysis.[ Editor’s Note: Impact breccia (BRECH-ee-uh) are thought to be diagnosticof an impact event such as an asteroid or comet striking the earth, and areusually found at impact craters. Impact breccia, a type of impactite, formsduring the process of impact cratering when large meteorites or comets impactwith the Earth or other rocky planets and asteroids. Breccia of this type maybe present on or beneath the floor of the crater, in the rim, or in the ejectaexpelled beyond the crater. Impact breccia may be identified by itsoccurrence in or around a known impact crater, and/or an association withother products of impact cratering such as shatter cones, impact glass,shocked minerals, and chemical and isotopic evidence of contamination withextraterrestrial material such as iridium and osmium anomalies.]"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Michael Farmer: “This is every piece of the barely 300 grams of meteorite fragmentsI recovered, either via finding them myself, or purchasing from the locals.

At first, experts dismissed the connection; the crater didn’tlook like a meteorite impact. But since then minds have changed.‘Without reservation this is definitely a meteorite,” says astronomy professorPeter Brown of the University of Western Ontario, Canada. ‘We found someinfrasound data recorded by a station in LaPaz about 70 kilometers (43 miles)away. From the size of the airwave, we can work out the kinetic energy of theimpactor – about .03 kilotons of TNT.’ The infrasound impact was recorded at16:44 Universal Time. The residents said the impact was at 11:34 AM localtime.Courtesy of Peter Brown, Ph.D., Prof. of Astronomy,University of Western Ontario, Canada.Prof. Brown said, ‘Something like 20 to 30 kilograms of the meteorite havealready been recovered, but odds are good a multi-ton monster lurks at thebottom of the crater. The bad news: It is below the water table, the rainyseason is coming and unless some action is taken ASAP, the rock will quicklyoxidize and crumble. We are digging for seismic data of the actual impact –the first actual seismic recording of a terrestrial meteorite impact!’”More Information:For further reports about meteorites, impact craters, comets and planetary geology, please"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"see reports below in the Earthfiles Archive:• 12/15/2006 — Stardust Comet Mission Reports New Kind of Organics• 12/08/2006 — NASA Wants Permanent Moon Base by 2024• 12/01/2006 — Deep Impact and Stardust: Are Comets Made of the Same Stuff?• 08/19/2006 — Red Rain Cells of Kerala, India - Still No Definite DNA• 09/16/2005 — \"Planet X\" and the Kuiper Belt's Oddballs, \"Santa\" and \"Easterbunny\"• 08/12/2005 — Deep Impact Spectra: Carbonate, PAHs and Some Amino Precursors in Comet Tempel I• 07/10/2005 — First Data from Deep Impact Crash Into Comet Tempel I• 06/29/2005 — July 3-4, 2005: NASA \"Deep Impact\" Spacecraft to Blast Hole in Comet Temple I• 04/20/2005 — Outer Space Impact At Serpent Mound, Ohio, 256 Million Years Ago• 04/01/2005 — What's Killing Off Marine Life Every 62 Million Years?• 03/20/2005 — Astronaut John Young: \"The Moon Can Save Earth's Civilization.\"• 01/13/2005 — NASA \"Deep Space\" Craft Will Hit Comet On July 4, 2005• 12/17/2004 — Is Our Solar System's Red, Mysterious Sedna An Alien Planetoid?• 11/17/2004 — European Space Agency's SMART-1 Satellite Begins Moon Orbit• 09/20/2004 — Part 1: Martian Water Vapor and Methane Overlap in Equatorial Regions• 06/25/2004 — Wild 2, An Amazing Comet• 03/31/2004 — Methane on Mars - Biology?
