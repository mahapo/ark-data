Luke AFBnorthwest of Phoenix is marked with a red dot.March 16, 2007 Phoenix, Arizona - Ten years ago this month on March 13, 1997, aseries of unidentified aerial lights were reported by thousands of people from Paulden andPrescott to Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona, and further west over Nevada. The earliestreports began around 8 PM local time and continued into the evening. Then between 10and 10:30 PM, an arc of lights emerged over Phoenix that was videotaped by residents andmade the local television news and later all the network and cable news programs."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Video frame from footage by Mike Krysten from his Paradise Valley hilltop homeoverlooking Phoenix, Arizona, on March 13, 1997, between 10:00 PM and 10:30 PMlocal time and broadcast on KPNX-TV, Phoenix.Large arc of lights over Phoenix in video frame photographedby Chuck Rearden from Apache Junction, a suburb straight east of Phoenix,on March 13, 1997, between 10:00 and 10:30 PM.But it was the multiple eyewitness descriptions of a huge, silent, low-flying triangle twohours earlier between 8 and 8:30 p.m., which might have been the more significant event.Yet, that had the least public and media attention.It is also significant that the night of March 13, 1997, and the following day, Luke AFB inPhoenix denied any knowledge about, or connection to, the nearly three hours of statewideaerial light mysteries. Yet, several months later after Arizona residents demandedexplanations, Luke AFB said it was only U. S. Air Force “flares dropped by A-10 Warthogairplanes on training exercises.”“Flares? That’s rubbish!” said Shahla Saracen, who watched a triangular craft estimated tobe about 2 miles long flying very low and silently between 8 and 8:30 p.m.The Air Force’s long-delayed official explanation was at such odds with what the mediaand public described the night of March 13, 1997, it implies misinformation – a deliberatelie – to cover-up what exactly?One source, who asked not to be identified and might have had Air Force insiderinformation, called the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle. That call wassummarized in the March 14, 1997, edition of The Daily Courier:“...Luke Air Force Base apparently sent two jets last night to intercept theUFOs. The pilots recorded the objects on camera, and returned to base.Allegedly one pilot was shaken, and the base was locked down for the night.“Media liaison at Luke Air Force Base, Sgt. Rolla Sutmiller, said no aircraftwere sent out and there was no lockdown, adding that the cameras on theaircraft only take pictures of targets during practice. She said the base receivedno calls Thursday night regarding UFO sightings. ‘We do not respond tosomething like this,' she said. 'And we do not fly in the evening.'”"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Much later on, the U. S. Air Force’s flare explanation apparently emerged to appease thefuror created by frustrated Arizona citizens who wanted to know: What happened in thenight sky for nearly three hours over Paulden to Tucson on March 13, 1997? I interviewedsome of those eyewitnesses for my news reports back then on Dreamland radio with ArtBell. Recently, as the tenth anniversary of the “Phoenix Lights” came around, I searchedmy archived audiotapes and found two different interviews I did about the gigantic,low-flying triangle.I’ll begin with Stacey Roads from Tucson, Arizona. She was in a car at 8:30 PM travelingfrom Tucson towards Phoenix for her daughter’s state swimming championship the nextmorning. A family friend was driving and the other four passengers were Stacey, herdaughter, her mother, and Emily’s school friend. All five were astounded by the giganticaerial object that passed for at least two minutes over their car, heading toward Tucson asthey drove on I-10 toward Phoenix.Interview:2-Mile-Long Triangular AircraftStacey Roads, Aerobics Instructor and Swim Coach, Tucson, Arizona: “We wereapproaching the hills of Casa Grande just south of Phoenix by about 30 miles. We looked itup on the map today and those hills are about 2,000 feet high. Our friend (driving) lookedover towards the northwest part of the car and said, ‘What in the hell is that?!’ We alllooked out the window and at that point, we knew what we were seeing was not anairplane. This was from quite a distance away and we were traveling on I-10 about 80 mphheaded north when we saw this big object with 3 lights in a triangular shape – one light inthe front and one light on each wing, which was traveling south right over the top of I-10,as if it were following a line.We did see it in the distance for a good couple of minutes and as it approached it grewbigger and bigger and bigger. Finally, we did reach underneath this, which was going veryslowly but steadily southward. Once it got over the top of us, the two girls rolled down theirwindows and stuck their heads out. And I leaned my head back toward the backseatwindow. It proceeded to block out all the stars in the sky. If I would have held up an opennewspaper, I could not have blocked out this object. The wingspan on this thing was sohuge that it could not have landed in an emergency on I-10 on either side, or both sidestogether, without its wings reaching far into the fields on either side.From the moment we entered its shadow, we were underneath it for two minutes going 80mph in the opposite direction. If you have a stationary object and it takes two minutes totravel beneath it, then it’s about 3-miles-long. So, I would estimate this object to be at leasttwo miles from the very front of the triangle to the back of the straight edge of the craft.We were under it for two minutes looking up and it did blot out all the stars. There were nospaces in it. It was a solid, metal mass in the sky with one light on each corner.The kids rolled down the windows and both stuck their heads out. There was not a sound atall. There were no electrical malfunctions in the car. Our hair did not stand on end. Nothingstrange like that.WHEN YOU SAY METAL, WERE YOU SEEING SOME KIND OF REFLECTION?It was a dull metal, kind of like a gun barrel, the bluing of a gun barrel."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"HOW WERE YOU SEEING THAT METALLIC FINISH? WAS IT JUST FROM THETHREE LIGHTS IN THE TRIANGULAR CORNERS OF THE OBJECT? OR WERETHERE LIGHTS WHERE YOU WERE DRIVING?No, it was a very dark area, but looking up you could see a metal mass. You could see ametal shape going over you. We even saw like a pattern on the bottom of the huge triangle,like pieces of metal – like an airplane wing when they put pieces of metal wings together,you can see like lines in it. It was not a perfect grid, but we could see the metal mass.IF YOU COULD SEE LINES IN THIS, HOW HIGH ABOVE YOU DO YOU ESTIMATEIT WAS?I do not think it was very high. As I said, the hills of Casa Grande are around 2,000 feethigh. It appeared to be coming right off the top of those. It was so big and menacing anddwarfing to us, I felt it was low. Actually, the first feeling I got was scared. I thought,‘Independence Day!’ That was my first thought - that this big thing is coming at us and Ihad a feeling to turn around. My husband was back in Tucson and I thought, ‘Should weturn around?’I did begin focusing on the object, but it was so huge, I could not take a picture of it. Icould take a picture of one of the lights and everyone would have said, ‘Nice street light.Nice lamp light.’ Or I could have gotten a picture of the black metal, but black on anegative would not come out. There was nothing to highlight the object to where it wouldhave been anything but black.So, I put the camera down. We all got real excited. We turned the radio off, but we did notstop the car. We were still traveling 80 mph north.DID YOU PASS ANY OTHER CARS?Lots of other cars. Some people were looking up.WERE THERE ANY OTHER LIGHTS BESIDES THE THREE AT THE CORNERS OFTHE TRIANGLE?No.WHAT COLOR WERE THEY?White, creamy, they were weird-looking lights. They weren’t emitting a light like aflashlight, or a police helicopter. It was not sending beams of light down. It just seemed tobe glowing as if you looked at a spotlight when you get real close to them at a store for likepromotions. It almost looks like it’s moving and you can’t focus on the light? That’s what itappeared like.I did focus in on it with my camera’s zoom lens and it was very blurry in my zoom lens,almost like I could not get crisp lines from the light.WHEN YOU LOOKED AT THE METALLIC PART OF THE OBJECT THROUGHYOUR CAMERA LENS, WHAT DID YOU SEE?Blackness because I was looking through a small camera lens at a black object. It’s a 35mmPentax, but it just looked like black on black, even looking up in the black sky at night andtrying to focus on fireworks. It’s very difficult when it’s so dark out.YOU MENTIONED LINES YOU COULD SEE IN THE METALLIC SURFACE. COULDYOU SEE ANY OF THOSE LINES IN THE CAMERA?Unfortunately no, it was so black."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"BUT YOU COULD SEE LINES WITH YOUR EYES?Ye s . ” Paradise Valley Eyewitnessesof Huge Triangle CraftStacey Roads and her family and friends did not know that around the same 8:30 PM time,a husband and wife in the home building business were also astounded by the size, silenceand low altitude of an enormous aerial triangle that moved northwest to southeast overtheir Paradise Valley hilltop home about twenty miles north of downtown Phoenix.Paradise Valley (blue dot) northeast of Phoenix, home of Max and Shahla Saracen.Residents in both Paradise Valley and Apache Junction (yellow dot) videotaped the arcof lights over Phoenix between 10:00 PM and 10:30 PM on March 13, 1997.Below their home, a new subdivision was in the construction stage of laying out streets.The couple, Max and Shahla Saracen, knew that the distance from one end of the newsubdivision to the other was 1.8 miles. The extraordinary aerial triangle was at least thatlong as it slowly moved over the development. Max described how the couple first saw theaerial craft, followed by his wife who said she saw four humanoids standing at one of manysquare windows spaced evenly in a row on the triangle.Interview:Max and Shahla Saracen, Luxury Home Builder Consultants in 1997, Phoenix,Arizona: “As we were coming up through the desert heading north, driving home from theshop, it was around 8:30 PM or a bit before - maybe 8:15 PM (still twilight) - and in thenorthwestern sky was a huge V of lights, like a string of lights in the sky, flying lower thanthe airplanes flying above it.But this shape was so huge. It was so big it made us pull off the road and get out of the carto see it. We were standing directly in its flight path, as it was heading from the northwestvalley to the southeast valley, down toward Tempe. The most striking thing about theselights as it got closer over our head was that it began to block out the stars. What you couldmake out was this huge triangular structure, some kind of structure in a definite triangularshape. It had kind of running lights on the side of it and the light did not illuminate the restof the structure. The lights were very coherent. There was no flare or glow around thelights. But they weren’t that bright.WHAT COLOR?Kind of white-yellowish. It looked like this structure was very secretive. That was theimpression I had from it first of all because it was completely silent and from end-to-end, itwas easily over a mile long, if not two miles long. That was the most striking thing we saw.ABOUT HOW LOW?About a thousand feet above us. It wasn’t very high at all.WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU STOOD THERE LOOKING ATSOMETHING THAT SEEMED TO BE BETWEEN A MILE AND TWO MILES INLENGTH IN THE SKY AT ONLY 1,000 FEET AND COMPLETELY SILENT?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"It was very other-worldly, that was my first impression. Extremely other-worldly. And Ithought, ‘If this belongs to us and is a secret military triangular structure, it would not makesense coming from the military because why would they be flying over domestic air spacethat was heavily populated at that time?’ If you can do that, you would do it between 3 and4 in the morning when people were asleep.The first thing we did when we got home was to write down our sighting on a piece ofpaper. That’s how I left it until I saw in the newspaper that a retired Chief of Police was thefirst eyewitness to call it in. Because he called it in and I know on the police force, they aretrained in observation, that this was a genuine witness, so I didn’t feel like too much of afool to come forward either.But my wife has better eyesight than I do at long distance. Her eyesight is incredible andshe could see windows.IS SHE THERE THAT I COULD INTERVIEW HER?Would you like to speak to her now?YES, PLEASE.Hold the line, Linda.HELLO. WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE LARGE TRIANGULAR OBJECTTHAT YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND SAW ON MARCH 13, 1997. HE SAYS YOUREYESIGHT IS EXTREMELY GOOD AT THOSE DISTANCES.Shahla Saracen: “At long distances. And also, I was looking at the lights when the lightswent out – whatever this was must have been illuminated from inside because you couldsee windows.WHEN YOU SAY YOU COULD SEE WINDOWS, WHERE WERE THE WINDOWSON THE GIGANTIC TRIANGLE?It was hard to tell because when the lights went out by this time, it was dark. When we firstsaw the ship, it was about 8:15 PM and it was still light. By this time (when lights wentout), it was later, but I think the windows were in the same line as the lights. Here it wasever so slowly going over the top of us, ever so slowly! The reason I kind of know howwide it was is that we work for a custom builder and we lay out master plans. And therewas a new master plan being laid out there and I know how many blocks there were towhatever – it was 28 blocks wide because I went back and counted.28 BLOCKS IS HOW LONG?About a mile and 7/8ths.PEOPLE HAVE SAID ABOUT 2 MILES LONG, THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THISTRIANGLE.OK, that’s what it was because they had laid out this master plan – only the houses closestto the road had been built. The further houses to the west had not been built and that’swhere it (triangular UFO) originally came from the west.The shape from the front was like a V. When it was over us, it was so humongous, Icouldn’t tell in the back if it was boomerang or triangle. It just went so far back! As I said,it hovered over us for a few minutes, maybe five minutes – not hovering, but going at thisslow speed so it felt as if it were hovering. Then all of a sudden, it took off going southtoward Chandler, toward Tucson.WHEN IT TOOK OFF, DID IT INCREASE IN SPEED?Yes, it did, quite a bit.WAS THERE ANY SOUND AT ALL?No, no sound at all.NOT EVEN WHEN IT SPED OFF?No, we heard nothing. Line of Lights, Square Windows and Humanoid Shapes"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE RUNNING LIGHTS?I didn’t count to see how many there were because sometimes there were more on thanother times. Like for a few minutes more lights were lit up and then some went off. Then atone point, all went off for just a few seconds – maybe 5 to 10 seconds – and then they allcame back on.WHEN THE LIGHTS WERE ALL OFF, WHAT WAS IT YOU THOUGHT YOU COULDSEE ?I saw windows! And I saw shapes, humanoid shadows. I said it to Max at the time and said,‘Don’t put it in the report because I don’t want everyone bugging me!’ (laughs) That’s thehonest truth.COULD YOU SEE ANYTHING THAT LOOKED LIKE METALLIC OR ANY KIND OFFINISH ON THE OBJECT IN THE TWILIGHT?It seemed very dull and matte. It was a very dull matte finish.WHAT COLOR?Dark, like a dark grey or black.THEN IT HAD YELLOW-WHITE RUNNING LIGHTS EDGING WHAT? ONLY ONTWO SIDES MAKING THE V?Yes, on two sides because when it sped off, it didn’t have back lights. It only had frontlights.YOU’RE SEEING AN OBJECT THAT FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW SEEMS TO BEQUITE SOLID, HAS A MATTE FINISH, HAS YELLOW-WHITE LIGHTS GOINGALONG THE TWO SIDES LIKE RUNNING LIGHTS FORMING A ‘V,’ SOME ARE ONAND THEN SOME ARE OFF. THEN THEY ALL GO OFF. WHEN THEY ALL WENTOFF...That’s when I could see the illumination that illuminated the windows. When they went off,then you could see the illumination from within. That’s what looked like windows. It’s onlybecause I’m in the building trade that I would look and notice what kind of windows. I’mfunny like that. We deal with windows every day.WHAT SHAPE WERE THEY?Square. Square windows and that surprised me.WHAT WAS THE COLOR BEHIND THEM?It was lights like ours.LIKE A WHITE LIGHT?Yes, it didn’t seem like a strange light at all. I didn’t notice that. I would have noticed if ithad been strange.WHAT KIND OF SHADOWS WERE YOU SEEING IN THOSE SQUARE WINDOWS?Grey shadows. You could see – I told Max four. I counted four. The lights went on and thatblinded me again so I couldn’t see any more.BUT FOUR SHADOWS LIKE WHAT SHAPES?Like grey shapes, you know? Like what I’ve seen on TV and that shocked me.MEANING?I wasn’t really into this stuff. I’m a person who isn’t arrogant enough to think this could nothappen, but not necessarily that it did until I saw it. So, this was quite shocking for me. ButI just saw the windows like squares going across. It was not highly lit inside. It was like ifwe had lights on a dimmer. I saw these four shapes like grey shadows. That’s what theylooked like to me – like a ghost, only grey. That sort of thing – a soft shape, not angular. Icould not see faces or anything. It wasn’t that close.BUT THE SHAPE WAS HUMANOID?Ye s ."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"A HEAD, SHOULDERS?It looked like that. I couldn’t see it except ghost shapes, you know like Casper, the Ghost?I saw more of a shadow but in human shape.WAS THERE ONE PER WINDOW? OR WERE THEY MOVING?No, it looked like the four were together, standing together (in one window frame). That’swhat it looked like, like the four shapes were together. They weren’t spread across.AND LOOKING OUT THE WINDOWS?Yes, that’s what it felt like, too.ANY OBJECT THAT WOULD BE NEARLY 2 MILES IN DIAMETER IN THE SKYFROM MY UNDERSTANDING OF TERRESTRIAL SCIENCE, WE DO NOT HAVEANYTHING ANYWHERE ON THE PLANET THAT IS CONSTRUCTED2-MILES-LONG THAT CAN MOVE SLOWLY AT A THOUSAND FEET ALTITUDE INCOMPLETE SILIENCE.Oh, yes, that did occur to me. That we don’t have anything like that. We don’t haveanything that big. Was the Huge Triangle Craft Extraterrestrial?WHAT WAS YOUR RESPONSE ABOUT WHAT THIS COULD POSSIBLY BE?A UFO! An extraterrestrial ship. It’s a ship that does not come from our planet, let’s put itthat way. We have nothing here, as your statement just said. So, I knew that, and you lookwith even more curiosity.We came immediately home – we were only five minutes from home – and we wrote downeverything. Then we started to ask ourselves, ‘Why here?’ Then we went into the backyard and started looking west toward where the nuclear power facility is. We thoughtmaybe it was that. But west is also Luke AFB and southwest is where the Barry GoldwaterMissile Range does tests. So we thought we would look in that direction and see if wecould see any weird lights. Then around 10:30 PM, we saw lights again. Everyone did.WHAT DID YOU SEE AT 10:30 PM?It was like several lights and much bigger. They seemed much bigger from far away. Thathappened at 10:30 PM and it seems like a lot of activity was reported that night. It wasreally weird because we all wondered, ‘Why?’ If it had been military, why would they behere at night? The military has places in Nevada and Utah and in Arizona where they fly,but not over Phoenix – a metropolitan city of 2.5 million people. Official USAF Explanation: FlaresLuke Air Force Base (red dot), straight west of downtown Phoenix, first denied it hadreceived any UFO reports on March 13, 1997, and said its inquiries to otherbases confirmed there were no military air exercises.WHAT WAS YOUR AND MAX’S REACTION TO LUCAS AFB SAYING IT WASMILITARY FLARES?Well, Linda, this is the funny thing! That night, March 13, 1997, and the next morning –"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Lucas AFB said they had nothing up and that they had nothing from any other air base.They said they called Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, us in Arizona, and Californiato see if anyone had put anything up. And that night, March 13th to the next morning,March 14th, it was reported on the radio and on Channel 10 television that the military saidthey had absolutely nothing up.Then a few months later, they come up with this flare business.SO THERE WAS NO FLARE EXPLANATION GIVEN BACK THEN?No flare explanation that night or the next day or even the next weeks. This story aboutflares came out months later, this flare explanation. This is rubbish, you know?WHAT WAS THE RELATIONSHIP OF THAT STATE-WIDE SIGHTING VERSUS WHATAPPEARS TO BE A UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT POLICY OF SILENCE?Well, I think the government is paranoid. They think the public cannot handle the existenceof life from other planets. But they are here. And we saw them. I know now!THE UNANSWERED QUESTION IS: WHY DID THE UFO DEMONSTRATE INSOMETHING THAT WAS A VEHICLE SO HUGE AND TO SO MANY PEOPLE OVERAN ENTIRE STATE?Yes, it’s incredible, isn’t it? And parts of Nevada and California as well. In parts of easternCalifornia, there were sightings of it and in southern Nevada, just across the border. Butbasically Arizona. And why? They obviously wanted to be seen.” 10-10:30 PM: Max Saracen Watched Orange UFOs,Jets and Arc of LightsMax Saracen: “I saw more odd lights around 10-10:30 PM. My wife was on the telephoneand I had gone outside on to the patio because I could see these lights over centralPhoenix. We live about 20 miles north of central Phoenix, but we’re on elevated ground,well above sea level. So, we actually get a good perspective of the city from where we are.The first thing I noticed – it must have been around 10:00 PM, this strange light in the sky– a big orange light and two jets. I saw one jet go directly underneath the UFO heading forthe west and shoot away. And the other jet went straight up in the air in front of the orangelight and you could see the jet engines fire off behind the plane and it just shot away like itwanted to get out of there as quickly as possible.WHAT DID THE ORANGE GLOWING OBJECT DO?It didn’t do anything. It just stood there. I believe this orange object appeared around thesame time as the famous video footage of the big arc of lights that hovered over the city ofPhoenix. It was all around the same time because I got my wife off the phone and said,‘Let’s go down deeper into the desert where we can go where there are no streetlights,where the sky is really black and get a really good view of what is going on.’So, we went down there with the dogs. She stayed in the car and I got out of the car andwalked into the desert. It was at that point – I don’t know if you have seen the videofootage of the big lights coming on in formation one at a time and then they go off one at atime. Where we were, those lights were very high in the sky and the lights were huge!Bigger than a stadium’s lights. That’s when I got frightened, when they came on one at atime like that because I was standing right out there very exposed in the desert. And thesehuge lights over the city were coming on and then going off. When they had all gone off, itwas the end of the ship – it had vanished.But towards the east were these two bright, fiery orange orbs – maybe about a mile apart –and they were still in the sky. Slowly in a turn, they kind of flickered and just vanished. Thelight just went out. But they hung around for about five minutes after the big lights (in anarc over the city) had come on and off.YOU SAW JETS TAKE OFF AND TRY TO APPRAOCH WHERE THE ORANGELIGHTS WERE COMING ON AND OFF?Ye s , d e f in it e ly .WHAT EXACTLY DID THE JETS DO?One of the jets went underneath the craft and then shot off toward Luke AFB. The otherone shot straight up in the air in front of the craft and made a sudden right hand turn andshot away into the distance. It was that quick. But I could see that it was a jet because the"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"jet engines fired up and you could see the fire coming off the back of the aircraft.COULD YOU HEAR THE JETS?No, I could not hear them, but you could see how bright the fire was.THE TWO BIG OBJECTS THAT YOU SAW GLOWING ALSO, THAT SOUNDS LIKETHE TWO OBJECTS THAT (TRUCK DRIVER) BILL GRINER GOT CLOSE TO,CLOSE ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SAY THEY LOOKED LIKE A CHILD’S TOP, SORTOF DIAMOND SHAPED. BUT HE SAW JETS SCRAMBLING RIGHT OUT OF LUKEAFB AND HE SAID IT LOOKED LIKE THE JETS HEADED RIGHT FOR ONE OFTHOSE BIG ORANGE OBJECTS AND IT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE CHARGINGRIGHT INTO IT. GRINER SAID THE OBJECT ROSE VERTICALLY AT SUCH ARAPID SPEED THAT THE ONLY THING HE COULD THINK OF WAS LIKE STARTREK WHEN THE ENTERPRISE GOES INTO WARP DRIVE OFF INTO INFINITY.NOW, APPARENTLY WHILE YOU WERE WATCHING, YOU NEVER SAWANYTHING LIKE THAT HAPPEN?No, I didn’t see the light shoot off. It was stationary. But the planes – one went underneathit and one went in front of it and then both of the orange lights disappeared.DID THE ORANGE GLOWING UFOS SEEM TO HAVE ANY KIND OF RESPONSE TOTHE JETS?No, they didn’t do anything. No change. Nothing.THEN WHAT HAPPENED?A whole string of lights came on in formation, four or five of them, in a rhythmicformation. One by one, starting with the last one that came on at the end, they started to gooff again, but in reverse order. And that was frightening because these lights were hoveringover the city of Phoenix for like 30 minutes, as long as that.DID THOSE LIGHTS GO ON AND OFF METHODICALLY MORE THAN ONCE?No, just once.WHAT NEXT?That was the end of the big arc-shaped thing over Phoenix.WHILE AT 8:30 P M, WHAT YOU WERE SEEING WAS A DEFINITE V-SHAP E WITHRUNNING LIGHTS ON THE SIDE.That’s right, it was a definite triangular shape, very different than the arc. And after thoselights had gone off, that was the end of the big ship. It completely vanished. But in theeastern sky, there had also been two fiery, orangey-gold fireballs – perfect circles. I hadseen something like that before over the Portsmouth Naval Base in England in the late1970s. I saw orange, fiery balls come land at the naval base there. It reminded me verymuch of that.WERE THERE ANY EXPLANATIONS FOR THE ORANGE BALLS INPORTSMOUTH?No, that was another hush-hush, secretive affair. No one talked about that one.DO YOU THINK IT WAS EXTRATERRESTRIAL?Oh, yeah.”More Information:For further information about unidentified triangular aircraft, please see reports below inthe Earthfiles Archives:• 01/26/2007 -- Part 1: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans• 11/03/2006 -- Another UFO Retaliation to Radar Lock On - 2003• 09/05/2006 -- Part 2: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet?• 12/02/2005 -- Abduction by Grey ETs in Huge, Black Triangle• 09/21/2005 -- Silent, Unidentified Aerial Triangle Entered Thunderstorm Over Fairborn, Ohio• 11/12/2004 -- Strange Metal Pieces from Plains of San Agustin Alleged UFO Crash Site Analyzed.• 08/18/2004 -- New Mexico Gov.
