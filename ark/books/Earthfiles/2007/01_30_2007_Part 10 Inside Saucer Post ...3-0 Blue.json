Norwood is a suburb northeast of Cincinnati.Leonard H. Stringfield: \"Needless to say, I accepted Rev. Miller's offer with enthusiasmand with the least of persuasion, he got the studio's attendants to run the reel in theprojection room. While Rev. Miller commented freely, Dell and I watched the screen inamazement as the giant stationary disc appeared, glowing intensely in the sweeps ofsearchlight's beam.Above: Sgt. Donald Berger and the 8 million candlepower searchlight whichhe was operating when he discovered the \"space platform.\" Photographs courtesyCincinnati Post. Below: One of a series of photographs showing the searchlightbeam illuminating the object which was computed to be 10,000 feet in diameter."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Cameraman for the movie, on request of Rev. Miller, was Sgt. Leo Davidson of theNorwood Police Department. Filming most of it on October 23, 1949, he used three rolls,25-feet-each, and a Hugo-Meyer F-19-3\" camera with telephoto lens. Commenting on thesmaller objects, Davidson said, \"they were visibly the size of pinheads, but they did nothave the intensity to register clearly on the film.\" He pointed out, however, that to thenaked eye, he and all others present, saw two groups of five small objects leaving theparent object. Each had halos and were bright er than the searchlight beam. Said Davidson,\"we watched each group fade out of view.\"Davidson also took ten \"still\" photographs using a Speed-Graphic camera with a 14-inchWallensach telephoto lens. Two of these were exceptional shots, said Davidson, showingboth the parent object and its \"brood.\"But, the two prize shots had a mysterious fate. Last to see them was Harry Mayo, who as acorrespondent for Time-Lif e, had prepared a feature story for Time, which included thetwo photos. But Mayo's story and Miller's photos were not used in Time or Life. In spite ofrequests by Rev. Miller of Mayo and his publishers, the photos were never returned.In 1955, I received permission from Rev. Miller to try to reclaim this film. SuspectingTime-Lif e of consorting with the Air Force, as had been suggested in the case of theTremonton film, I wrote to Captain R. C. White of OPI, in Washington, D. C. His reply ofMay 20, 1955, denied that the U. S. Air Force had ever received the two photos. SaidWhite, in part, \"...we have made a thorough check of our files and they are not in ourpossession. Moreover, we have made a check of our correspondence as well as ourphotographic file (what other legitimate photos lie in that file?) and can find no referenceto such photographs, either by name or by location. As I pointed out in our telephoneconversation, the chances are that these photographs went no farther than to themagazine.\"Long before cameras entered the Norwood scene, lending substantiation to the big object,the press on the very first night of the series of events, found supporting evidence. Said theCincinnati Post, August 20, 1949, \"Balls of fire hung over Cincinnati during the night. ...AWeather Bureau official said, 'One of our men who was working last night saw them. Hesaid they looked like two weather ceiling balloons, but they weren't moving. There was awind of 25 to 32 miles an hour, so if they'd been balloons, they would have moved.'Another witness saw 'two balls of fire' about 4 a.m. 'They seemed to grow dim, and thenget bright again,' he said.\"The most eventful night, according to Berger's log and testimony of others, was October23, 1949. Again, the point of observation was the church grounds. This time about 50persons witnessed the phenomenon. Using a telescope, William Winkler, a businessman,said he observed one of the two groups of five smaller objects leave the parent object anddescribed them as \"triangular.\" Rev. Miller and his brother, Rev. Cletus Miller, agreed theywere shaped \"like the apex of Indian arrow heads.\"When I interviewed Robert Linn, Managing Editor of the Cincinnati Post, he admittedthat he saw the searchlight beam \"bounce off some definite object.\" But he said thesmaller objects were \"something like bits of paper.\" However, Linn was concerned enoughto join Rev. Miller in reporting the incident to Intelligence at Wright-Patterson AFB. From"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"another source, I learned that the Cincinnati Enquirer was called about the Norwoodobject. While they did not publish the story of the night's activities, the newspaper didadmit it received reports of unidentified lights in the sky - and beyond the vicinity ofNorwood!While no one among the thousands of Cincinnatians who saw the object could identify it,including experts, Harry Mayo of the Post wrote a feature article on April 6, 1950,headlined:\"'What Glows On Here? Norwood Muses.\" At the close of the article, Mayowrote: \"Dr. D. A. Wells, Professor of Physics at the University of Cincinnati, and PaulHerget, U.C. Professor of Astronomy, took a look. Said Dr. Wells: 'In my opinion, it's anoptical illusion.' Said Prof. Herget, 'It's not a fake. I believe it might be caused by theillumination of gas in the atmosphere. We need an explanation to squash people's fears.'\"But as I have since learned, Herget's words, \"We need an explanation to squash people'sfears\" were closer to the truth than his guess about the gas. While I cannot publish Herget'sexclamation while he viewed the object on December 20, 1949, because of a confidenceentrusted me, I can say that Herget's reactions and utterances indicated anything butindifference. Nor can I publish, for the same confidence, the actions and behind-the-scenes maneuvers of Dr. Wells, which are veritable guideposts pointing to, andconfirming some, of my conclusions toward saucer secrecy. I can say, however, that Dr.Wells was there with camera and protractors and was in frequent hush-hush huddles withtwo O.S.I. members also present. Computations of the object's size were made and thenconfirmed by Dr. Wells. Like something out of Gulliver's Travels, the size of the NorwoodUFO was approximated to be 10,000 feet in diameter (nearly two miles).The Mayor of Norwood, R. Ed Tepe, now deceased, told me during an interview in 1954that he also was present during the computing and heard Dr. Wells confirm the object'sapproximate size. Tepe, who gave me a clear-cut unbiased report of his observations,firmly believed that the object was a solid, round body. \"It had ridges or ribbing,\" he said,\"which were very discernible.\" Tepe also said that \"when the searchlight beam movedaway, the target was lost.\"And so concludes, in brief, the story of the Norwood searchlight incident and of Sgt.Berger's speculative \"space platform.\" Perhaps Berger's guess is right, which leaves onlyone remaining question: who put it there, we? Or they?On that question, opinion is divided, of course. If the computers were correct in theirestimating the size of the object at 10,000 feet in diameter, then I believe by sheer logic,that it was \"they.\" Certainly something of this tremendous size, harboring at least five orten smaller craft, would have to land somewhere. And another point: Air Forceinterceptors were secretly sent up to investigate. If then, the satellite-sized object were aUSA device, as suggested, why bother to investigate when Intelligence at Wright-PattersonAFB would have already known of its secret rendezvous in the restricted and vulnerableCincinnati-Dayton area?
