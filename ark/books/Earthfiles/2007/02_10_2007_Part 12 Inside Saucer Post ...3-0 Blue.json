Stringfield.SAUCER SANCTA - 801 AND 4E4Summarizing everything from angel hair to zodiacal lights, I have come to the conclusionthat flying saucers are interplanetary vehicles and that the world governments withtechnological know-how also believe this to be the answer. This answer, however, for oneor several reasons is being kept from the world public."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"In 1955, the London Sunday Dispatch reported: \"The Air Ministry stated that the resultsof their five year investigation of UFOs is not to be made public. It is to be locked awayand may not ever be released, for the Air Ministry is afraid it will encounter or promotemuch skepticism.\"During the same year, the Ministry of Defense (MOD) in South Africa announced that allinformation about UFOs seen in that country was labeled: \"TOP SECRET, not to bedivulged.\" Equally secret, but less blunt about it, was a letter received from Capt. White ofOPI, USAF, Defense Department, dated May 20, 1955: \"I know of no plans to releaseinformation on individual sightings and doubt that such will take place since we still havethe same shortage of investigative personnel.\"Also, in May 1955, INS reported Dorothy Kilgallen's famous dispatch from London whichquoted a British official of cabinet rank as saying: \"We believe, on the basis of our inquiriesthus far, that the saucers were staffed by small men, probably under four fee tall. It'sfrightening, but there is no denying the flying saucers come from another planet.\"[ Editor's Note: On May 22, 1955, Dorothy Kilgallen, reporting forInternational News Service (INS), wrote: \"British scientists and airmen, afterexamining the wreckage of one mysterious flying ship, are convinced thesestrange aerial objects are not optical illusions or Soviet inventions, but areflying saucers which originate on another planet.\"The source of my information is a British official of Cabinet rank who prefersto remain unidentified. 'We believe, on the basis of our inquiry thus far, thatthe saucers were staffed by small men - probably under four feet tall. It'sfrightening, but there is no denying the flying saucers come from anotherplanet.'\"The official quoted scientists as saying a flying ship of this type could notpossibly have been constructed on earth. The British Government, I learned, iswithholding an official report on the 'flying saucer' examination at this time,possibly because it does not wish to frighten the public.\"]After long silence, the British Air Ministry said in a June 15, 1957, statement that admitteda serious concern over UFO reports. According to London's Reynolds News, \"On the ninthfloor of what was formerly the Hotel Metropole, there is a TOP SECRET room - Number801 to be exact - where all reports of flying saucers are collected and studied by experts.\"Summarizing the Air Ministry's revelations, Reynolds News stated:\"(1) The Air Ministry - who have always supposed to have treated UFOs withskeptical derision - have in fact been investigating saucer reports since as farback as 1947.(2) In these ten years, the UFO files have grown immensely. 'We havesomething like 10,000 on our files,' the Ministry spokesman said.(3) Though many of these 10,000 sightings have been 'cleared up,' officialsources admit that there were some which could not be explained. 'Nobody inthe know,' the spokesman admitted, 'is prepared to say that all reports aboutthese mystery objects are nonsense.'(4) At airfields all over Britain, fighter planes are kept ready to intercept, andif necessary, to engage any UFO within the combat range.(5) The interior of Room 801 is never seen by unauthorized persons. A largemap of the British Isles hangs on one wall; and on it, dotted all over thecountry are literally thousands of coloured pins. These obviously representsightings reported to the Air Ministry.(6) The heaviest concentration of these coloured pins appears to be over theNorwich area.\"[ Editor's Note: The Romans had their regional capital at Venta Icenorum onthe river five miles south of Norwich in East Anglia, eastern England. VentaIcenorum, located at modern-day Caistor St Edmund in the English county ofNorfolk, East Anglia, was the capital of the powerful and independent Icenitribe, who inhabited the flatlands and marshes of that county and earnedimmortality for their revolt against Roman rule under their Queen Boudica (orBoadicea) in the winter of 61 CE.]Realizing that an iron door of security stood between me and the final answer, Inonetheless took advantage of an opportunity on August 13, 1957, to visit ATIC at Wright-"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Patterson AFB, hoping to ascertain as much about their 4E4 as Reynolds News told usabout the British Room 801.I asked to see Capt. Gregory, but he being off the base, I went through a series of phonecalls from the registration desk trying to locate someone else willing to talk sense aboutsaucers. I was first connected with a Dr. Miley, \"who was in charge of 4E4.\" But when herefused to be interviewed, for obvious reasons, I was directed to Mr. Spencer Whedon, thehead of the ATIC Information Services Office. My appointment was set for 3 o'clock.Arriving early, and while waiting for Whedon's arrival from the briefing room, his secretarywas also bound by security regulations to keep a watchful eye. That included to follow meto the drinking fountain. Thinking this amusing, but probably necessary where so manysecrets are kept, I was again followed as I returned to my chair. No sooner that I had seatedmyself, then Whedon - with an assistant - stormed into the office. Both looked as thoughthey were rushing to battle stations. Whedon, a robust man with a voice that boomed, wasquick to get the bull by the horns. While making introductions and asking what I wanted,his assistant, saying nothing, pulled a chair close to me and swung one leg over the other.Feeling almost beleaguered, I got directly to the point. I said, \"I understand from certainsources that the Air Force is coming out soon with a new and different statement on theUFO.\"\"Don't know of any,\" said Whedon, pressing tobacco into his pipe. \"Unless it's a slightmodification of its present text - but nothing big or different that I know of.\"This was the starter. Before many minutes had elapsed, in which we had covered severaldebatable subjects, I could feel that Whedon was getting the upper hand. His voice, wasforever commanding and his replies forever rambling into valuable time. In the middle ofone of his standard Air Force replies, I decided to cut in. I asked why the Air Forcepersisted in stating that saucers do not exist.Appearing nettled, Whedon relit his pipe, found a new balance in his chair and boomed,\"All but 3% can be explained - and we'd explain those if we had more data.\" Half-smiling,he then recalled some personal experiences in which he himself had been fooled by theoptic of light.\"Just recently,\" he said, \"while driving my car in Dayton, I came to a familiar intersectionand was surprised to see two red traffic lights.\" Pausing momentarily, drawing heavily onhis pipe, he went on: \"I thought this was odd, but as my car got nearer - GUESS WHAT?\"In the next instant, Whedon was laughing so gustily that he even failed to notice that hispipe had burned out. Knowing the answer was going to be funny, I edged closer. Even thewry face of his assistant creased into a traceable smile. Finally Whedon, reeling back intohis chair and still smiling, said, \"There was only one light.\" He then explained that anyonecan be fooled by lights and so can people who see saucers! He also cited an instance when\"practically everybody on the base here\" was alerted to take a look at a UFO. Carefullypointing out that each and every observer was \"trained\" to observe objects in the sky,Whedon said, \"Jets were sent up and ...\"But before he could finish, I had cut in with another question, figuring that I already knewhis answer. I had heard it at least twice before, once from Captain Gregory and once fromSgt. Hill. Each story had a slightly different version, but it had the same ending. In theearlier examples the UFOs were searchlight beams playing on some lofty cloud. Or, maybeWhedon's was, too, if I had let him finish his story.But Whedon was not pleased with my impertinence and galumphed back in his chair. Hereminded me that I had \"interrupted\" him six times. When I apologized, the subject onceagain was restored to the \"unexplained 3%.\" Whedon, looking victorious, went on to saythat these represented mostly untrained sighters like science-fiction addicts, children,publicity seekers and hoaxsters.I started to name several sightings by astronomers, pilots and others quite unlike hisreferences, but felt that it was hopeless. Continually pressing the tobacco in his pipe,Whedon then admitted that the Air Force has never ruled out the interplanetary theory. Buthe knew of no evidence which would support it - unless, he said, \"They aren't telling meeverything.\"Thinking this perhaps was the case, I next hit on the subject of secrecy. \"We're not hiding athing,\" he countered. Everybody seems to think we are, but there's nothing to hide.\" I thenasked if I could see the military reports, especially those by pilots.\"We can't show these,\" he said, \"because we don't have the personnel to handle all therequests to see the reports.\" He added, \"Besides, it is not our policy to supply material forcommercial purposes.\" Relighting his pipe, Whedon continued, \"Air Force pilots are free tosay whatever they please about UFOs. They are not muzzled and I can show you this in"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"black and white.\"Time having run out, I thanked Whedon and his assistant for the interview and departed.Walking to the gate, I smiled in Pyrrhic victory. When I got home that night, I thoughtabout Whedon's statement about the muzzling of pilots. Sitting down to my typewriter, Iwrote him the following letter from which I quote in part: \"...In one of our topical avenues,which concerned the 'muzzling of pilots,' you stated that such charges are not so and thatyou could prove this in writing. Although I did not request this proof at the time, I wouldnow like to see whatever reference or directive you had in mind.\"The terse and somewhat hazy reply to my letter was signed by Capt. Wallace Elwood andis quoted for your interpretation: \"In answer to your letter of 14 August 1957, Mr. Whedonbelieves that you may refer to his statement that the Air Force regulation which alonegoverns the actions of Air Force personnel with respect to UFOs clearly does not muzzlepilots.\" THE \"MONSTER\" UNDER THE LIDOn July 23, 1952, six Air Force jets pursued a \"flying saucer\" over southwestern Ohio.Hundreds of reports were received from Columbus, Springfield, Vandalia and Cedarville.According to a firsthand report from a Cincinnati attorney, W. D. Bollinger, jets \"zoomedaround the saucer which had the appearance of a big orange ball of fire with a tail.\"Another report told of sixteen Air Force officers in a plane returning to Wright-PattersonAFB from Washington, D. C., who also witnessed the UFO.One passenger, Col. E. J. Morrison, PIO of the Air Materiel Command, described theobject a a \"large bright nail.\" He added, \"The sky was cloudless and we had a perfect viewof it. The 'nail' to me looked as if it was suspended and was stationary.\" After theintercepting jets landed, a spokesman at Wright-Patterson AFB said, \"This is a good one.\"He added, \"We have plenty of information,\" but he declined to reveal details until reportswere cleared through intelligence channels.But this report, like thousands of others, has never been cleared. Five years has since past,but according to Whedon, \"the Air Force is not hiding a thing.\"\"Go tell it to the Marines\" would seem to be an apt rebuttal, but alas, the bromide won'twork. The hitch is that Marine pilots who intercept a UFO are treated no differently thanany other military pilot. Their lips sealed by JANAP 146, reminds them if they should talkout of turn about their incident, they might be sentenced to prison for one to ten years andfined up to 10,000 dollars.Air Force saucer files, therefore, in spite of the testimony of Whedon & Co., are under thelock and key of \"maximum security.\" Stories like Whedon's \"two red traffic lights\" suggestruses and are designed to degrade the subject, dissipate rational debate and hopefully dispelthe debater. All is fair in war and in saucers is apparently what the Air Force thinks. Theirattitude is that they know best why the lid of the Pandora's box must not open ... for to tella little will lead to telling all, so the safest policy is to tell nothing!Why? What great monster lies cramped and writhing under the lid of the Pandora's box? Isit a horrendous grand hoax - which is to say that every \"respectful\" saucer sighter since thefoo-fighter has invented his report just to smokescreen some super-secret military weapon?Or is the real story of the interplanetary saucer just too fantastic for the conventionalhuman mind to grasp - not to mention its impact on world economics and man'sphilosophies? In this category, would fit the Adamski revelations, for the spaceman in hiscreation is much like the human being, not at all frightful in appearance. But this spacemanis fantastic nonetheless, for he also is telepathic and knows all and sees all.Or is the monster under the lid truly a monster? Is the saucer a thing of violence orpotential violence? Is there a pattern to the thousands of hidden reports which might tie tosome fearful or inscrutable master plan? If this is the answer, then the policy of secrecy and\"maximum security\" is understandable.But leeching into the sinews of this theoretical monster are its theoretical inconsistencies.For instance, negating the supposition of violence from outer space is the bare truth thatsaucers have not destroyed the world or harmed its masses. And surely a space race withenough intelligence to build an interplanetary vehicle could also build a super weaponcapable of planeticide.On the other hand, to accept this negative evidence, purely on face value or because it fitsinto the human scheme of behavior might be as rash or as foolhardy as accepting tooquickly the positive evidence. Positive evidence is by far the more controversial. By simpledefinition, if it is a physical act of violence allegedly caused by a UFO, should the public"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"interpret this to mean that saucers are hostile, without taking time to weigh all the evidencebefore panic ensues? But whatever its interpretation, acts of UFO violence cannot beerased from the records any more than can the evidence which tells us that saucersthemselves exist. To this writer, however, they not only stand out \"like a sore thumb\" in thesaucer mystery, but also might provide the key to the official lock of secrecy. Whether ornot saucers are hostile is highly debatable and for this reason, I list examples of\"menace-like\" cases for review:(1) Crater in Logan, Utah, caused by fiery object, May 1, 1954. Investigatingscientists believed the crater was not caused by \"a conventional meteorite.\"(2) A barn in Sweden collapsed mysteriously during deluge of green fireballs,1946. Workshop destroyed by flaming object in Adelaide, Australia, June1955.(3) Maritime mysteries with a suspect UFO flavor - the Joyita incident, avessel left wallowing in a light sea, near Fiji, its crew and passengers missing, asection topside burned out in form of a semi-circle. And the puzzle of theArakarimoa, missing while strange sea objects were in vicinity, March 1956.(4) Severe burns on hand of William Cunningham of Darby Township,Pennsylvania, caused by flaming missile which entered his window on January23, 1955. Metal fragments analyzed, unexplained.(5) The blackbird panic caused by UFO, February 17, 1956.(6) UFO interference causing aircraft crash in Jacksonville, Florida, December21, 1955.(7) UFO causing damage to aircraft while in flight, Pixley, California, July 22,1956.(8) Near collision with UFO, Long Beach, California, April 15, 1954.Passengers injured.(9) Radar shows jet interceptor being \"swallowed\" by UFO, November 23,1953. Case known as the Kinross, Michigan, Affair - see Major Keyhoe's TheFlying Saucer Conspiracy © 1955 for details. Another report, which describesa bell-shaped UFO \"swallowing\" an Air Force bomber on March 9, 1955, wassent to me by Eugene Metcalfe of Paris, Illinois. I have been unable to obtainauthentic verification of a bomber missing on that date, however. Metcalfeswears he saw it happen. Also of interest, an Air Force official admitted to methat this case had been investigated by ATIC.Of greatest concern are the acts of UFO violence befalling both commercial and militaryaircraft. Unlike the ground incidents where a meteor falling from the sky might account forsome of the \"guided missiles\" from the \"menacing Martians,\" the chances of a meteorhitting or interfering with an aircraft in flight would be several million to one. To buttressthe pros and cons of this argument, there are no statistics, nor are there statistics releasedby the Air Force or the C.A.A. from which the public could determine to what extent theworld has been drawn into its silent \"conflict\" with the unknown.Robert C. Gardner, lecturer and private UFO investigator of the state of California, duringa visit to my home in 1955 gave me this statement for publication in Orbit:\"In the latter part of February 1953, I carried a letter of introduction andrecommendation from a New York official in charge of all our continental airdefenses at Ent Air Force Base in Colorado. The letter concerned a plan I hadwhich the Eastern Air Defense considered important to our national defense.Out of courtesy to General Chidlaw, who has since retired, I have withhelduntil now the vitally important information herewith revealed. In the course ofthe half hour private interview, the General mentioned - among many otherinteresting items - the following: 'We have stacks of reports about flyingsaucers. We take them seriously when you consider we have lost many menand planes trying to intercept them.'\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"December 30, 1954, Time Magazine, USAF GeneralBenjamin W. Chidlaw, ADC Commander, 1952.Later word supporting Gardner's statement came from a Cincinnatian who, with rank in theAir Force Reserve, had access to certain bits of off-the-record information. It was duringthe Cincinnati flap of 1955 that he related to a GOC supervisor, who in turn told me, thatthe Air Force was losing almost a plane a day.Still another Air Force officer in a better position to secure facts on-the-record told me in aprivate chat also during the 1955 UFO flap, \"What bothers me is what's happening to ouraircraft!\" Nothing more was said, nor did I ask for more.Major Keyhoe describes several mysterious UFO interferences with aircraft in his writings.While I have listed others in CRIFO publications, many of which admittedly wereborderline cases bearing only suspect evidence, I am more pointedly reminded of my ownexperience while flying to Iwo Jima in 1945. Had my plane plunged into the sea, no one -including the U. S. Air Force - would have been the wiser as to its cause. Such as it turnedout, the incident must remain among the speculative cases.As inconclusive as my case might be, I am in possession of other more positiveinformation, revealed to me from a reliable military source, which tells of a disasteroccurring in the air near a certain U. S. military installation outside the continental UnitedStates. According to my informant, a jet aircraft while on a routine mission, was vectoredin by base operations to intercept two UFOs. Approaching these interlopers, the planeappeared to suddenly develop trouble and was seen to plunge into the shallows of waterbelow. Both occupants of the jet aircraft met an unexplained death, not from drowning.Closing this case, the adjutant of the base notified the next of kin that each flyer had metdeath during a routine mission.Once again I am reminded of Ruppelt's statement of 1952, \"If they turn out to be hostilevehicles, we will keep after them.\" And as Whedon confirmed to me in August 1957, \"Yes,we send up our jets to intercept. We won't deny that.\" THE PROBLEM OF PANICIf the truth is bad, and there is a monster under the lid, then perhaps the decision by worldgovernments to keep the facts muzzled, at all costs, is the right course. But whateversurprise lies under the lid, the Air Force psycho-medicos might be live that any \"surprise\"might become a monster of panic and present a greater problem than the \"monster\" of realfacts. One historic precedent is the Orson Welles radio dramatization of H. G. Well's Wa r o fthe Worlds in 1938. Lending weight to this supposition is an off-the-cuff remark made byan Air Force official to me in 1956. Asking him point blank what would happen if all theofficial UFO reports were suddenly heaped onto the public, he replied, \"There would be apanic.\"According to one argument, the American frame of mind in 1938 was a lot softer than theAmerican mind today, who is toughened by two wars plus being alerted to the threat of theH-Bomb and the ICBM to deliver it.Gerald Heard, who wrote Is Another World Watching? commented on the theory of panic."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"He tells us that in 1932, when the asteroid Apollo was hurtling through space within 20minutes of ramming the EArth with inconceivable results, that his mentioning that fact onthe radio in London, \"showed nothing but the faintest curiosity\" on the part of his listeners.But the Apollo story did not make the headlines as did the \"blips\" that appeared on radarover Washington, D. C., in July of 1952 - and which brought General John Samford of AirForce Intelligence to the American radios to placate a rising hysteria. And Apollo was notas luridly visible as the saucer that coursed over Indianapolis in July of the same year thatbrought near panic to its people.[ Editor's Note: See 12/29/04 Earthfiles - Half a century ago in 1952, fifteenhundred and one UFO sightings were reported to the U. S. Air Force's ProjectBlue Book (Page 108 of Blue Book Report). The most well known eventswere \"flying discs\" over Washington, D. C., on July 19 and July 26, 1952, thatwere monitored on radar.July 19 and 26, 1952 - UFOs Over Washington, D. C.Monday, July 28, 1952, The Washington Post, Washington, D. C.Around midnight on July 19, 1952, radar operators at Washington NationalAirport noted several 'blips' on the radar over Washington D.C. Theunidentified blips traveled at 100 to 130 mph, but then would acceleratesuddenly to speeds in excess of 7,200 mph. Washington National Airport andother radar operators confirmed the radar activity with each other and withAndrews Air Force Base. A week later on Saturday, July 26, 1952, \"glowingaerial objects\" showed up again on radar over the Nation's capital and TheWa sh i n g t o n P o st even ran a story about one jet pilot's encounter with a\"saucer that outran\" him.]And despite all the Swords of Damocles in our present era, which should make Americanstough, there will continue to be incidents like that which befell Knoxville, Tennessee, onJanuary 25, 1957.It was a \"night like all nights\" when suddenly a \"ball of fire\" was seen over Sharp's Ridgeand the city's lights went out. A rising tide of alarm, according to the Knoxville Journal,brought a flood of calls to the switchboards at police headquarters and newspapers. \"I sawa ball of fire on Sharp's Ridge\" was the report most often heard. Among the rumorsreceived by the police was that there had been a nuclear explosion at Oak Ridge, that theUnited States was being bombed, and according to the Journal, a fear that the earth hadbeen invaded by Martians. What really happened, said the Journal, \"was that a largepower pole fell across high voltage lines, shorting out a transformer at the Arlingtonsubstation.\"As my book goes to press (October 1957), two timely news items lending credence to thepostulate of panic, appeared in the Cincinnati Enquirer. One was datelined AssociatedPress, Moscow, and the other United Press, Hartford, Connecticut, September 15, 1957.According to the AP item, the Black Sea city of Tuapse fled to the countryside in hysteriaover a science-fiction thriller appearing in their newspaper, which told of Sovietastronomers discovering a huge, fiery mass rushing towards earth to destroy it. The story,said the newspaper Soviet Russia, was so fantastically terrifying that many natives ofTuapse became convinced the earth would be destroyed in a few days. The story, writtenby an author named Kris, had Soviet scientists find that the heavenly mass was a sort of\"atomic reactor\" invented by capitalists to destroy Russia.According to the UP item, a National Civil Defense Week program on TV was so realisticthat thousands of people in Hartford feared war had started. To mark the kickoff of thenational observance, the Hartford Station, announced its special program, \"What could"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"happen in Connecticut in the event of enemy attack.\" Then after the show began, anannouncer read a \"bulletin\": \"We interrupt this program to bring you a bulletin fromColorado Springs. The Air Defense Command has announced that a large mass ofunidentified planes is approaching the North American continent over the North Pole.These planes are presumed hostile.\"What followed the reading of this bulletin, said UP, was a small-scale repetition of thescare stirred in 1938 by Orson Welles.On the subject of panic, I am unable to express an opinion. But as long as I am aware ofreports like the preceding and the following are happening, I am sure there is a place formany \"Saucer Posts\" like \"...3-0 Blue.\"March 1955, information received from radio operator in AF Tactical Air Command whoparticipated in the alert and later saw the written summary report:\"Every U. S. military base sweeping out from the Arctic from Korea to Thulein Greenland was alerted. Near Adak, Alaska, radar picked up a lone UFOtracking it as it shot south through Canada t the speed of 9,000 mph.Interceptors sent up from Japan lost the object, but thanks to our advancedwarning system, more interceptors were scrambled near Kelly AFB in SanAntonio, Texas. As the UFO continued South, where the jets were waiting, itsuddenly reversed its course and shot northward again leaving the jets inpursuit far behind. From Thule, and as far south as Langley AFB in Virginia,jets were also scrambled to intercept several UFOs heading south along theeastern coast of Canada. In this phase of the alert, F-94s equipped with radar\"locked on\" the objects. Again illusive, they disappeared straight up.\"End of book.More Information:For further information about Leonard Stringfield's UFO Status Reports, please see reprintsbelow from the Earthfiles Archives:Status Reports I• 10/25/2005 -- Final Part 6: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 10/13/2005 -- Part 5: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 10/05/2005 -- Part 4: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 09/30/2005 -- Part 3: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 09/26/2005 -- Part 2: Retrievals of the Third Kind - Kingman, Arizona Crash• 09/25/2005 -- Part 1: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary CustodyStatus Reports II• 09/19/2005 -- Final Part 9: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/17/2005 -- Part 8: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/14/2005 -- Part 7: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/06/2005 -- Part 6: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 08/22/2005 -- Part 5: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 08/17/2005 -- Part 4: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/20/2005 -- Part 3: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/14/2005 -- Part 2: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/12/2005 -- Part 1: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New DataStatus Reports III• 07/05/2005 -- Final Part 15: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 06/20/2005 -- Part 14: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 06/17/2005 -- Part 13: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 05/10/2005 -- Part 12: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 05/04/2005 -- Part 11: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 04/19/2005 -- Part 10: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence © June 1982 byLeonard H.
