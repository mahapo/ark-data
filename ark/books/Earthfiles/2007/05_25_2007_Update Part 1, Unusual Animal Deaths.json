The mutilation phenomenon continues, but its geographic focus changes.Beginning in 2002, there has been a wave of animal mutilations in Argentina. Authoritiesestimate that more than three thousand cases have been reported to SENASA (Argentina'sDept. of Agriculture), veterinarians, police and other authorities.West of Argentina, Chile began having a rash of bloodless puncture attacks on farmanimals in 2000, which were attributed to the notorious chupacabras, a word that means\"goat sucker\" in Spanish. Now again this April to May 2007, there have been both cattlemutilation and new chupacabras reports in Argentina and Chile. [ Please see newArgentina cattle mutilation and chupacabras attacks in Chile - 05/25/07Earthfiles.]All the cows, steers, bulls or heifers are usually missing an ear, eye, jaw flesh, tongue,genitals and rectal/vaginal area. Law enforcement are the ones who first started saying thecuts look like they were made with a \"cookie cutter,\" or are \"surgical,\" and called them\"mutilations.\"Another common characteristic is lack of blood and no signs of struggle or tracks aroundthe dead bodies - not even the animal's own tracks. That's what made so many sheriffs anddeputies look to the sky and wonder what was lifting the mutilated animals and somehowreturning them, or dropping them, back to their home pastures?Over the past half century now in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, similarbloodless, trackless mutilations have victimized cattle, horses, sheep, goats, pigs, rabbits,cats, dogs - and even wild animals such as deer, elk and marmots. Rabbit and Opossum Mutilations -Long Beach, CaliforniaRecently on May 14, 2007, Long Beach City College gardner, Jeff Kyle, in southernCalifornia, found eleven dead rabbits on the northern side of Carson Avenue near thecollege's English and Language Arts building. Kyle told the school's Viking Newspaper thatthe front half of one rabbit \"was cut off perfectly in half with precision.\" No blood wasdescribed. The week before, two opossums had been found at the El Dorado NatureCenter about 4.5 miles southwest of the Long Beach, California, college and one of theopossums was said to be mutilated like the rabbit.

Like so manyother previous incidents of this terrible ongoing phenomena in the United States, Canadaand England, the cats are found sliced bloodlessly in a variety of patterns and laid out intheir owner’s yard with no tracks or signs of struggle.Then first week of May 2007, the Sussex County, England, Royal Society for thePrevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), reported to police that a cat in Park Close,Portslade, was found with its head, tail and two legs removed without blood. A SussexPolice spokesperson says there have been several similar cat mutilations in the pastwithout any perpetrator being found and natural predators have been ruled out because ofthe precise tissue removal. Since May 2006, in West Sussex County, at least ten cats werefound mutilated in Chichester, Burgess Hill and Haywards Health. Cattle Mutilations: Montana,Colorado and ArgentinaSeven months ago, I reported on Coast to Coast AM about a 1300-pound, healthy blackAngus cow found dead on October 9, 2006, in Valier, Montana. The ranch owners hadseen the cow alive and well at 5:30 PM the night before. The animal's jaw was strippedclean, the udder was removed in a smooth, cut and the rectal and vaginal tissue had beencored out - all without blood. The only ground impression in the short barley stubble thecow lay on was a small crater. Pondera County Sheriff Tom Kuka came to the conclusionthe cow had been dropped a considerable distance from the air and the animal hadbounced on the ground leaving the crater. I worked with biophysicist W. C. Levengood tohave soil and barley stubble tested and biophysicist Levengood found evidence in the soilof compression from hard impact that was not in control soil taken far from the cow's bodyin the same barley field."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"1200-pound black Angus cow found dead and mutilated on morning of October 9, 2006,in Valier, Pondera County, Montana.

S. Army Lt. Col. Philip J. Corsodescribed in great detail the U. S. government cover-up of non-human craft and bodies andthe back-engineering of non-human technologies. He also was familiar with the worldwideanimal mutilation phenomenon and wrote:\"In the Pentagon from 1961 to 1963, I reviewed field reports from local andstate police agencies about the discoveries of dead cattle whose carcasseslooked as though they had been systematically mutilated ... Local policereported that when veterinarians were called to the scene to examine the deadcattle left in fields, they often found evidence not just that the animal's bloodhad been drained, but that entire organs were removed with such surgical skillthat it could not have been the work of predators or vandals removing theorgans for some depraved ritual.\" Lt. Col. Corso also described in his book that investigations of animal mutilations byveterinarians and other authorities confirmed \"entire organs were removed without anyvisible trauma to the surrounding cell tissue.\" Before Lt. Col. Corso died in 1998, he toldme he had seen highly classified government reports about global animal mutilations datedas early as 1951 - only four years after the alleged disc crashes near Roswell, NewMexico. The perpetrators of the bloodless animal deaths were named in the classifieddocuments as \"extraterrestrial biological entities.\" "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"October 1, 2006 - Canjilon, New MexicoAngus Bull MutilationRed dots mark Canjilon and Canjilon Mountain above Los Alamos; Dulce is upper center;and Chaco Canyon and Standing Rock are lower left, sites where RobertAllen has also seen unidentified aerial lights.The Pondera County, Montana investigators did not know that further south in northernNew Mexico, a red Angus bull was also found dead and mutilated on October 1, 2006 -only eight days before the mutilated cow was found in Valier.  The small ranching community of Canjilon (Cahn-HEE-lawn), New Mexico, is surroundedby high mountain peaks of 10,000 feet and more. Down in the valley, there are perhaps athousand head of cattle on various small properties. One rancher, Albert Martinez, hasraised cattle in Canjilon for fifty years. His children were born there. He had heard aboutanimal mutilations in Dulce, Chama, Mora and other Northern New Mexico regionsbefore, but he had never seen it with his own eyes until October 1st. He was so surprisedby the strange excisions on his red Angus bull that he talked with neighbors and localauthorities about it.The Rio Grande SUN, Thursday, October 12, 2006, Page A21."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Red Angus bull owner, Albert Martinez, on October 1, 2006.Some of the hide around the excised genitals and rectum appeared scorched.No veterinarian necropsy was done.

Robert Allenwas surprised by what he saw – both on the animal and in the night sky.Interview:Robert Allen, Animal Mutilation Investigator, Gallup, New Mexico: “We went to thesite – and this was approximately 50 hours after the bull was mutilated. I measured thedistance from the bull out to about an 80 yard perimeter there and could not find anyfootprints, tire tracks, not any sign of anything coming to the bull or leaving it.YOU WENT THERE WITHIN 50 HOURS AFTER THE BULL’S DEATH. CAN YOUNOW DESCRIBE IN DETAIL WHAT WAS TAKEN FROM THIS BULL AND WHATWERE YOU LOOKING AT FROM THE HEAD, CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND THEREAR?When I first came upon the animal, I was startled to find the precision with which the cutswere made on the genitalia, its anus was cored out, its testicles and penis were removed.And it looked like the hide was burned on the stomach where the genitals and rectum hadbeen taken out. The bull had one eye missing. It had strange marks all over its ribcage.

Owner Albert Martinezsaid there was no blood on October 1, 2006, when he discovered his bull.Photograph on October 4, 2006 © by Robert Allen.Yes. He said there had been no trickling blood on October 1, and you can see how cleanthe animal was in that photo taken that day with Mr. Martinez.COULD YOU DISCUSS WHAT MR. MARTINEZ TOLD YOU ABOUT THE STATE OFBLOOD ON THE ANIMAL WHEN HE FOUND IT?He was puzzled because there was no blood on the ground that he could see. There was noblood trail off into the brush there. No blood was coming out of the animal. There was nofluid leaking out anywhere. Also, he said there was an amazing smell to the animal. Hesaid it smelled like a dentist’s office or a doctor’s office.A MEDICINAL SMELL?A medicinal smell, yes. He said it was quite pungent, that you could smell it from a prettygood distance.Now, on the other side of the pasture there we went to and there were marks on theground on the other side of the pasture approximately 60 yards away from where the bullwas found mutilated. You could tell that an object had landed there. There wereindentations in the ground. It was quite puzzling because the terrain there – that was on aslope there, so this object came down on a slope and landed!WHAT WERE THE MARKS LIKE?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"They were round. They were approximately – this was October, so the ground was moresoft than after a hard freeze. So, the round marks were down a good 12 inches in theground.HOW BIG WERE THE CIRCULAR DEPRESSIONS?I’d say a foot across.DID THEY HAVE A PATTERN ON THE GROUND?They were a triangular pattern. There was one (circular depression) off to the distancethere to the north of the bull. Then the others went to the east and west making a triangularmarking, the pattern.SO, YOU HAD THE IMPRESSION OF THREE CIRCLES GOING DOWN 12 INCHESINTO THE SOIL ON A SLANTED HILL SIDE?Yes. And they (circular depressions in soil) were absolutely precise. There was no variancein them. So an object came down neatly, made that impression and it took off neatly. Icould not find any disturbance on the ground. I didn’t see any burn marks. There were notracks at all going from that hillside to the bull.HOW FAR IN TERMS OF FEET WOULD YOU ESTIMATE IT WAS FROM THE BODYOF THE MUTILATED BULL TO WHERE THOSE THREE TRIANGULARIMPRESSIONS WERE IN THE HILLSIDE?I would say approximately 80 yards (262 feet). There were no footprints of any kind, otherthan outside that perimeter there were other cattle there. But no cattle went near thatanimal. I went to the rancher and talked with him about the prior history there, what heknows about animal mutilations and what he has heard from other people over the years.He’s been there approximately 50 years himself. His family is from there. His childrenwere born and raised there and he’s been a rancher all his life. His father was, too. Thearea is predominantly U. S. Forest Service, the people who work there, and ranching.Several years earlier in 1999 in that area, there were several. Mysterious Aerial Lights OverCanjilon, New MexicoOver the years, they have seen bizarre light displays over that area. His (Albert Martinez)daughter and her husband were walking through there probably about a year earlier thanthat (1998) and saw these amazing lights in the sky at night.CAN YOU GIVE SOME DETAILS ABOUT COLOR, SIZE, MOTION AND SO FORTH?From what he (Albert Martinez) told me, the lights themselves were circular in a pattern (aring of lights), according to this testimony I have written down here. The lights wereyellow, blue and red. They came in at an amazing speed and they stopped on a dime. Thefamily viewed it for awhile. I’d guess 25 or 30 seconds. And the lights took off to the northat an incredible speed – just were gone in a matter of a second out of their view.DO I UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY WERE SEEING WHEN THE DIFFERENTCOLORED LIGHTS CAME TOGETHER THAT THE LIGHTS FORMED A RING INTHE SKY?A ring in the sky, yes. They specifically saw lights that were yellow, blue and red under thebelly of it, I assume.BUT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT ONE LARGE OBJECT? OR MULTIPLE SMALLEROBJECTS IN A RING?One object coming in. And they saw this several times over the years there in this area. Isaw these lights, an incredible light there right after the mutilation last year in October2006. I camped up in the mountains there for approximately two weeks.DESCRIBE WHAT YOU SAW WITH YOUR OWN EYES?It was approximately about 8:30 PM. The mutilation took place on October 1, 2006. I wasthere from the first of October to approximately the 12th or 13th.On October 4th, I’m sitting there (camped on mountain) hoping that another mutilation"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"was going to take place. I was up on top of a mountain that oversees the Canjilon valleythere. Approximately 8:30 PM that night, I viewed an object coming in at a speed I couldnot calculate, it came in so fast. It came in from the east over the mountains there anddown into the valley and over to a ridge that runs a spine there across Canjilon. The ridgeline is approximately 15 miles long. And the object was a bluish-white streak. It came inand it was accelerating at an amazing speed and was losing altitude at the same time, so itlooked like it was shot down into the mountainside. It went right into the mountain.I went over to the area and tried to find it. The terrain was too rugged. It was dark and Icould not pinpoint exactly where the object came in, but I just believe these objects arecoming in and out of the valley on a regular basis.THAT WAS THE NIGHT OF OCTOBER 4, 2006. THE BULL WAS FOUNDMUTILATED BY THE OWNER ON OCTOBER 1, 2006.Ye s .HAS ANYBODY IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THAT VALLEY JUST SAID TO YOUSTRAIGHTFORWARDLY, ‘WE’RE DEALING WITH CREATURES NOT FROM THISPLANET?’Well, I talked with a police officer up there who’s been there for 34 years. He investigatedseveral animal mutilations over the years. They’ve never been able to determine how theanimal has been killed, no one has been able to find any person involved in it, no one hasever been arrested, no one has ever been filmed. And the strangest part about it is that noone has ever seen or heard how these cows are being mutilated. If it's a craft, no one hasever seen it down in a pasture with an animal.Some of the mutilations were four hours apart from seeing the actual animal to when theanimal was found mutilated. It was just shocking to the ranchers that they would go outand see the animals (alive) and four hours later find one mutilated, not knowing how ithappened. No signs. No signs of struggle, no predator kills. None of these animals haveany kind of teeth marks on their bodies. No predator at all. Mutilated Bull Found Underneath TrailerI investigated one strange animal death in Rio Hondo, New Mexico, where they found amutilated bull underneath a trailer, which was amazing!AS IF IT WERE PUT THERE ALMOST LIKE ‘HOW WOULD YOU DO THIS? THIS ISWHAT WE CAN DO?’Exactly. It was just a blatant display of power and technology. The farmers, when theysaw it, were absolutely stunned.I talked to a gentleman there in Chama who said he saw – this is incredible! They weregoing up a pass from Chama there – that’s at 7,800 feet. So, you’re going up to 10,400 feetto climb up to the front pass there, Cumbres, and they saw an object come down from thesky. It was a solid object and he saw several other objects split from it and go in everydirection flying zigzag and circular patterns. Then later, come back and join altogetheragain.He came down to his car with a friend. They were sitting there and the aerial object cameover the hood of the car, shone an amazingly bright light into the car. I asked him if therewas any heat and he said no. The object stayed stationary there for a couple of minutes asif they were viewing the men in the car and then the object shot straight up, broke up intotwo spheres, and went in different directions zigzagging around. And then it returned itselfto its original triangle form and shot up into the sky at breakneck speed.\"Continued in Part 2 - New \"Chupacabras\" Attacks in Chile and Cattle Mutilations inArgentinaMore Information:For further information about unusual animal deaths, please see my books anddocumentaries in the Earthfiles Shop and the Earthfiles Archive such as the reportsbelow:• 04/09/2007 — More Cat Mutilations - This Time in Corpus Christi, Texas"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"• 11/24/2006 — Scientific Data Supports Theory Mutilated Montana Cow Dropped from Sky and Bounced• 10/19/2006 — Another Cattle Mutilation in Pondera County, Montana• 10/02/2006 — Unusual Deaths of Six Female Goats in White Salmon, Washington• 08/23/2006 — More Cat and Dog Mutilations• 06/28/2006 — Half Cats in Destin, Florida, and Beheaded Animals in Rochester, N.
