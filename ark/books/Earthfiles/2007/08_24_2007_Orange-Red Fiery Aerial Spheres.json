Brian Fields, USAF, Ret.August 24, 2007 Mount Morris, Michigan - A month ago on Saturday, July 14th, highstrangeness took place in the English county of Warwickshire at a pub in Shakespeare’shome town of Stratford-upon-Avon. The pub is called The Lone Elm on Birmingham Roadin the center of town. That night around 10:30 PM, at least eight employees and about onehundred people in the pub, all watched orange lights move into a formation in the sky. Thelights stopped still in a pattern that did not change for nearly a half hour. And there was nosound. See Earthfiles 072707.About 150 miles southeast in Farnsborough, Hampshire, other eyewitnesses the nextweekend on July 22, watched nine red-orange lights which suddenly appeared – “poppedin,” they said - a few at a time and moved into various formations before disappearingagain “as if you switched off a light.”I wondered if the 2007 orange-red lights in English skies might be the same aerial craft thathave showed up in the United States and Canada over the past 40 years? Red-orange, fieryspheres of light in the air and near the ground were seen by law enforcement and ranchersall over North America back in the late 1960s to early 1970s. Eyewitnesses linked theappearances of the red-orange balls of fire to animal mutilations and intrusions in nuclearmissile bases. Orange-Red Aerial Craft IntrudedOn SAC Bases in Fall 1975Over three weeks in October to November 1975, several Strategic Air Command (SAC)bases in the northern states were placed on a high priority alert because of unidentifiedaircraft flying at low altitude over atomic weapons storage areas.The head of NORAD, the North American Air Defense Command, sent a message toNORAD divisions that began:“Since October 28, 1975, numerous reports ofsuspicious aerial objects have been received at NORAD.Reliable military personnel at:1) Loring AFB, Limestone, Maine2) Wurtsmith AFB, Oscoda, Michigan, near Lake Huron,east of Michigan National Guard Military Reserve andArtillery Range.3) Malmstrom AFB, Great Falls, Montana4) Minot AFB, North Dakota, and the 5) Canadian Forces Station at Falconbridge, Ontario,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Canadahave visually sighted suspicious objects.”On October 30, 1975, at Wurtsmith AFB in Oscoda, Michigan (no longer active) -southeast of the Roll Away Campground near Mio on the Au Sable River – low-flyingorange lights hovered and moved up and down erratically near the air base perimeter. Someof the mysterious aircraft were boldly flying and hovering right over the totally restrictednuclear weapons storage area.Only four months before then in July 1975, Richard Johnson and his friend, John, in theirearly twenties, went camping at Roll Away Campground on the Au Sable River, betweenthe Michigan National Guard Military Reserve and Artillery Range and Wurtsmith AFB.The two young men arrived, set up their tents during daylight and went hiking. After theirreturn, the two were shocked by what turned up across the river.[ Editor’s Note: Michigan's Au Sable River runs approximately 140 miles(225 km) through the northern Lower Peninsula, through the towns ofGrayling and Mio and enters Lake Huron at Oscoda. Au sable in French means\"with sand.\"Most of the main branch of the Au Sable flows through or adjacent to theHuron-Manistee National Forest. Five percent of the land in the watershed isfederal National Forest and 29% is Michigan state forest. ]Mio (pink circle) on Au Sable River is between the Michigan National Guard MilitaryReservation and Artillery Range and retired Wurtsmith AFB to the east formerlyin Oscodo on Lake Huron (not shown on map).Interview:Richard L. Johnson, Technical Engineering Assistant, General Motors since 1978,Mount Morris, Michigan (outside of Flint): “As the evening rolled along, we weresitting on these high banks and the Au Sable River is quite wide there. We noticed acrossthe river that we thought someone was camping because it was a large fire. We hadn’tnoticed it before. It was like an orange glow.So, the next thing we know, this orange ball pops up and goes down above the treetops. Welook at each other like, ‘Did you see that?!’ And ‘Yeah!’This thing popped up and down and came out and came down the river and was in front ofus. It was probably about 20 feet in diameter. It was just an orange ball. I can tell you thatwe were pretty frightened. The hair on my neck was standing up and I said, ‘Whatever it is,it knows we’re here.’ I started talking to it, thinking, ‘What are you? What do you want?’It was an orange ball in the air and it looked like it was on fire. It moved up to about a 2o’clock position on us – like flames because that’s exactly what we thought we saw aroundit was flames. It kept coming in toward us and back and in toward us. Of course, we wereout in the middle of nowhere and had nowhere to go.IF YOU WERE GOING TO SELECT AN ORANGE COLOR WE WOULD ALL KNOW,W H AT W O U L D T H AT B E ?Kind of like when the sun sets. That kind of an orange with a little yellow mixed in. But, ofcourse, this was midnight.AND IT WAS CLOSE TO YOU?Pretty close – I’d say within 50 yards.WAS IT CASTING ANY LIGHT AND SHADOWS ON THE GROUND?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I don’t remember. We just didn’t know what to think. We were afraid.THIS IS SPHERICAL, AS FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED?Ye s .NOT A DISC SHAPE?No, it was spherical.AROUND THE SPHERE, WHAT EXACTLY LOOKED LIKE FLAMES?When it moved up to the 2 o’clock position, it just seemed like it had these little flamescoming off the edges of it. When I talked with my friend, John, about it, he remembersthat, too. (John now lives in California.)We thought someone had a big fire going over on the edge of the trees and maybe someonewas camping over there. But all of a sudden, we saw part of the edge of the ball pop up andthen it was bouncing up and down on the treetops, moving to our right. Then it came outdown the river to our right and then slowly made its way up toward us.SO IT WAS DOING THAT BOUNCING BALL MOTION ALONG THE TREES?Yes. We would say, ‘Which way is it moving now? Is it right?’He would answer, ‘Yes, to the right.’Then it would go down and come up. So, we wanted to verify that we were watching thesame thing.HOW CLOSE DID IT COME TO YOU?On the other side of the (Au Sable) river, which I guess would be 50 yards. No more than75 yards.IT NEVER CROSSED THE RIVER TO YOU?No, it just came down.DESCRIBE THE MOTION THAT YOU PERCEIVED AS COMING TOWARD YOUAND BACKING UP AND SO FORTH.It was bobbing up and down at the treetops and when it came out to the river where it wasin full view, it just slowly moved with no bobbing straight in front of us. There was nosound.WHEN YOU SAY IT MOVED TO STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU, DO YOU MEAN ITSTAYED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER? OR DID IT CROSS THE RIVER ANDCOME RIGHT UP TO YOU?No, it stayed over on the other side of the river.BUT YOU COULD SEE WHAT YOU THOUGHT WAS MOTION UP TO THE RIVERBANK, THEN BACK AND THEN FORWARD AND THEN BACK?Right. Telepathic EffortAT ANY POINT, DID EITHER OF YOU HAVE ANY TELEPATHIC IMPRESSIONS?I just knew that whatever it was, it realized we were there. Back then, I was 20-years-oldand I was just - we did try to communicate with it telepathically – you’re correct. We didtry to do that. But to no avail. We didn’t hear anything. No voices. Nothing. But we did tryto communicate with it telepathically – I can’t believe you said that because, yes, we didtry that. HOW LONG DID THIS CAT AND MOUSE FORWARD AND BACKWARD ACTIONGO ON?I want to say it went on for about 40 minutes.WHAT DID THE TWO OF YOU SAY ABOUT WHAT IS THIS?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I had told my buddy, John, ‘It has to be a UFO and it knows we’re here.’ But we didn’treally know what it was. We just knew it was something we had never seen. We said toeach other, ‘Nobody is going to believe us when we get back.’The strange thing about it is that we both don’t remember when it left. But we were layingon our backs and looked at each other and went, ‘Oh, my gosh!’THE LAST MEMORY YOU HAVE IS YOU ARE NOT STANDING UP ANYMORE, BUTYOU’RE LYING DOWN. THE ORANGE SPHERE IS GONE AND YOU’REWONDERING WHAT HAPPENED?Yeah. See, we were actually sitting on the edge of the river bank with our feet over becausethe banks were probably 20 feet high. So we were just sitting on the edge of the banklooking at the stars and listening to animals. Neither one of us could remember when it left.But I do remember when we were on our backs. We looked at each other like, ‘Oh, myGod.’ Then we went to our tents and went to sleep.SINCE THAT TIME WHICH WAS JULY 1975, HAVE YOU EVER HAD VERY VIVIDDREAMS THAT INCLUDED THE ORANGE SPHERE?No, I haven’t. I’ve heard of a lot of similar sightings. 1997 Dream of Skies Full of DiscsWHAT ABOUT OTHER VIVID DREAMS OF ANYTHING YOU WOULD PUT INTOTHE CATEGORY OF NON-HUMAN?Yes, I’ve had dreams of UFOs, yeah.WHAT HAPPENED?Oh, boy! I remember one dream about UFOs that wasn’t good. I was trying to hide fromthem and they were all over the place. Not really sure what was going on, but I knew I hadto hide.IN THE DREAM, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING IN THE SKY WHEN YOU SAY UFOSARE ALL OVER THE PLACE. WHAT SHAPES? AND HOW MANY?Disc-shaped. I’m trying to go back at least ten years.THAT’S WHEN YOU HAD THE VIVID DREAM?Yeah. What 1997 – what’s important about that date is – I used to watch that show,Sightings, all the time. I was watching and it said in the summer of 1975, three orange ballscame down into three U. S. Air Force bases – one, I believe, was in Maine. One was inNorth or South Dakota and one was in Wurtsmith AFB, which we were not too far from(on camping trip in Mio). And it said that three orange balls came into these air force basesone particular night and that they had disarmed their (base) nuclear weapons. They werespotted by several people on the bases. And I said, ‘Oh, my God! Maybe that’s what Isaw.’Because when we were camping out there during the day, we could see bombers goingover. They were doing their runs.SO, THAT NIGHT ON THE RIVER, HOW FAR WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN FROMTHAT AIR FORCE BASE?I’m sure I was within a 30 mile radius.SO, WHAT THAT ORANGE, FIERY SPHERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DOING THATJULY OF 1975 WHEN YOU AND JOHN WERE SITTING ON THE BANK OF THERIVER, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MONITORING THE MILITARY BASE?Correct.AND WHAT YOU DON’T KNOW IS WHETHER YOU TWO WERE ABDUCTED? ORONE OF YOU WAS ABDUCTED?Right, I don’t know that.IN 1997, WHAT VIVID DREAM DID YOU HAVE?I just remember that I was in a city. I was just there all of a sudden. Nothing built up to it."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"There were UFOs flying everywhere. They were saucer-shaped. The sky looked kind ofgrayish. All I knew was that I had to hide. I had to get behind these bushes. I did and fromwhat I can remember, there were things walking down the street, which I didn’t see, butjust had that feeling that I needed to get down and get out of the way. I remember lookingup in the sky and saying, ‘Oh, my God, there are UFOs everywhere!’WHAT WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET?I don’t know - a presence I had to hide from. I couldn’t tell. I don’t know if they wereGreys. I don’t know what they were. I just knew I had to hide.IF YOU COULD ESTIMATE HOW MANY YOU WERE SEEING IN ANY OF YOURMEMORY, COULD YO TALK ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF DOZENS OR HUNDREDSOR THOUSANDS OR WHATEVER?I would say dozens.THE SKY BEING GREY SOUNDS AS IF THIS WAS NOT NIGHT?No, it was like an overcast day. I hid in like this hedge.ONCE YOU’RE IN THE HEDGE, WHAT HAPPENS IN THE DREAM?I thought something is not right here. Where did all these UFOs come from? Are we beinginvaded? So, I got out of that dream pretty quick! “Hidden Truth”HAVE YOU BEEN WORRYING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE DREAMWILL COME TRUE? THE SKIES WILL BE FILLED WITH DISKS AND THAT YOUWILL HAVE TO HIDE?I believe there are probably several different people visiting our planet and some are goodand some are bad. I do believe that we’re going through some changes. I don’t know if thisis different than anybody else has felt through the years, but I just feel that something isgoing to happen and I don’t know - as far as maybe contact and everybody actuallyknowing what’s going on. But yeah, I have a little anxiety about it. But at the same time, Ihave a little excitement, too.IT WOULD BE NICE TO GET PAST ALL THE LIES AND GET TO THE FACTS OFWHATEVER IT IS THAT INTERACTS WITH OUR PLANET.Correct. Because it’s been going on for a long, long time! And I believe that the truth hasbeen hidden from us and we have a right to know.”More Information:If viewers have more information about aerial orange spheres in your region, please emailme at earthfiles@earthfiles.comNICAP Report about October 30, 1975, Wurtsmith AFB, Michigan, UFO Incidents:Oct. 30, 1975 - Wurtsmith AFB, Oscodo, Michigan10:30 - 11:00 p.m. A KC-135 tanker was returning from a refueling mission. Itentered Wurtsmith's traffic pattern and received permission to fly transitionapproaches. Col. Boardman ordered the KC-135 to attempt to identify theobject. Wurtsmith air traffic control vectored the tanker in the object'sdirection.Aboard the KC-135 was Major Frederick Pappas, the plane's commander;Captain K. E. May, co-pilot; Captain Rick Meier, the navigator; CaptainMyron Taylor, instructor navigator; Captain Randy Higginbotham, instructorpilot; and Sergeant Steve Smith.Captain Taylor: “We were returning from a refueling mission and during ourfirst approach into the traffic pattern, RAPCON vectored us to check out areported UFO in the area of the Wurtsmith Weapons Storage Area. As I recall,this activity occurred between 10:30 and 11:00 p.m. in the evening around the1st of November (later established as Oct. 30). I remember seeing lights similarto strobe lights which were flashing irregularly. We followed the lights northout over Lake Huron and then the UFO swung south still over the lake toward"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"the Saginaw Bay area of Michigan.“At first it was difficult to determine whether there were two different objectsbecause of the irregular flashing of the lights. But, after observing the lights wedetermined that there were in fact two objects and the irregular flashingappeared to be some sort of signal being passed from one to the other in aneffort to maintain the same position. We were able to maintain visual contactmost of the time and I was only able to paint an object on the radar scope forabout 10 seconds. I would estimate that our altitude was about 2,000 feet andour speed approximately 200 knots.“Shortly after turning south in pursuit of the UFO, we called Approach Controland received blanket clearance to follow the UFO at all altitudes and at allvectors. Occasionally, RAPCON would pick-up the UFO and help us by givingus vectors to the UFO's position. I would guess that we stayed close to theUFO most of the time, approximately one mile away, and each time weattempted to close on the object it would speed away from us. We followed theUFO down to Saginaw Bay and started across the Bay when we lost it becauseof all the fishing boat lights. At first we thought it had landed on one of thelarge oil tankers, but later decided that we had been wrong.“We continued to search the Bay area but didn't see it so we changed ourheading for Wurtsmith. On the way back, we picked the UFO up again at oureight o'clock position. We turned away, and it proceeded to follow us. Finally,we turned back in the direction of the UFO and it really took off back in thedirection of the Bay area. I know this might sound crazy, but I would estimatethat the UFO sped away from us doing approximately 1,000 knots.“We continued in the direction of the Bay until RAPCON called us again andsaid they were painting a UFO four to five miles over the coast traveling in awesterly direction. They vectored us to the position of the UFO and weproceeded, but at that point we were low on fuel and were forced to return toWurtsmith. I remember that while on final approach we saw the lights againnear the Weapons Storage Area. Following the mission we discussed theincident and about a week later, Captain Higginbotham was questioned by theOffice of Special Investigations (OSI) and cautioned not to discuss theincident.\"Please see other Earthfiles reports about government knowledge of unidentified aerial disksin the Earthfiles Archive:Strategic Air Command (SAC)• 11/28/2006 — Part 2: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 10/19/2006 — UFO Retaliation to U.
