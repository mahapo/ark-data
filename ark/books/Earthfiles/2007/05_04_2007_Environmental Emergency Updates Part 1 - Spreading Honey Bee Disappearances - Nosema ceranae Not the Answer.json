Right: Honey bees atop hive board.Another protozoan, Nosema ceranae, has recently been linked to honey bee die-offs in Spain,France, other European countries and the United States. But Colony Collapse Disorderscientists say it's not the final answer to CCD. Honey bee image © 2007 by Matt Cardy/Getty.May 4, 2007 Gainesville, Florida - In the last week of April 2007, media headlined thatUniversity of California-San Francisco biochemists had “tracked down suspect in honeybee disappearances.”The culprit? The news media called it a fungus. But it’s a one-celled protozoan calledNosema ceranae. The problem with that suspect? Nosema ceranae had been identifiedlong before in Spain, other European countries and the United States – in both healthy,normal honey bees, as well as bee bodies found around empty hives where ColonyCollapse Disorder (CCD) has been reported. In CCD, the bees have disappeared in thebillions in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres since the fall of 2006.Five months ago in December 2006, scientists in the CCD Working Group publiclyreported that whatever was causing the massive honey bee disappearances was alsoseverely suppressing honey bee immune systems – leaving the bees vulnerable to all sortsof pathogens, including the Nosema protozoan.The fragility of the honey bee immune system was confirmed by the genome project lastOctober, which for the first time mapped all the genes in honey bees. DNA researchersfound that there weren’t many genes to deal with poisons or to fight off disease. Theconclusion was that honey bees might be especially vulnerable to attacks by pathogens andpesticides and other toxins.The University of Montana’s Bee Alert group recently surveyed more than 500 American beekeepers to find out how many have had bees disappear. The statistic now is: 38% ofbeekeepers have reported hive disappearances, some losing 75% or more of all their bees.One bee colony in California went from thriving to disappearance in only two days. That’s why the late April 2007 UC-San Francisco announcement that Nosema ceranaewas most likely the cause of CCD was surprising and confusing. The protozoan wasalready on the growing list of hypotheses that more than a hundred American scientistshave been trying to study for half a year in an effort to solve the honey bee mystery. Thisweek I asked Jerry Hayes, Chief of the Apiary Section, at Florida’s Dept. of Agriculture inGainesville, Florida, about the Nosema news release and the spread of Colony CollapseDisorder into China, Taiwan, Guatemala and Brazil."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Click for Earthfiles Podcast Interview:Jerry Hayes, Chief, Apiary Section, Florida Department of Agriculture, Gainesville,Florida: “That was kind of an awkward situation because the CCD Working Group (ofscientists) had already identified Nosema ceranae, which is a one-celled protozoan thatcan live in the honey bee’s intestine. The lab in California (UC-San Francisco) did notcontact us. But it was good that they did the work because it confirmed what we hadalready known.But Nosema ceranae does not seem to be a major player at this time because all of thesamples we have taken from all bees seem to have Nosema ceranae in them. So it’s notsomething that appears to be a brand new pathogen.WELL, THEN WHY DID THIS HIT THE HEADLINES WITH THAT PROFESSORSEEMING TO SAY THIS IS THE ANSWER?You’ve got me, Linda.I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I HAD TALKED WITH YOU AND PROF.COX-FOSTER AND ALL OF THESE PEOPLE IN THE TWO WEEKS LEADING UPTO WHEN YOU AND I HAD TALKED.Right.AND NOBODY WAS FOCUSING ON NOSEMA, BUT I KNEW IT HAD COME UPBACK IN FEBRUARY BECAUSE THEY HAD FOUND IT IN SPAIN.Yes. And there was separate diagnosis of that at the USDA lab in Beltsville, Maryland,probably a month ago. So, this was not something new to us and then to have this kind ofblurted out we thought was kind of interesting.IS THERE ANY REASON WHY THE SAN FRANCISCO RESEARCHERS WHO PUTOUT THE INFORMATION ABOUT NOSEMA CERANAE POSSIBLY BEING THEEXPLANATION FOR THE COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER NOT HAVINGCHECKED WITH THE COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER SCIENTISTS BEFORERELEASING THE INFORMATION?It certainly seems to be a disconnect in the communication process and we hope in thefuture our other colleagues in other realms and expertise will be able to work more closelywith us. These guys (UC-San Francisco) kind of charged ahead and identified somethingwe already knew about. This Nosema has been widely identified in Europe, includingSpain and France, for several years. So there are treatments and controls for it and it’ssomething that beekeepers are addressing already.WHY DID THE COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER SCIENCE GROUP DISMISSNOSEMA CERANAE AS NOT BEING THE CAUSE FOR THE GENERALDISAPPEARANCE OF HONEY BEES?Because beekeepers were already in many cases treating with the antibiotic for Nosema inthe samples that we took. So, some of the samples the beekeepers had been treating anddid not have Nosema. Some of the samples, the beekeepers had not been treating. So, theredidn’t seem to be a connection. CCD appeared whether the beekeepers were treating forNosema or not.SO, THE IDEA THAT THE SAN FRANCISCO RESEARCHERS RELEASED IN THEIRANNOUNCEMENT THAT THIS NOSEMA UNICELLULAR PROTOZOAN WASFOUND IN ALL OF THE BODIES OF THE BEES THAT THEY STUDIED – THAT ISMISLEADING?I think they jumped the gun, yes.IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A FLUKE THAT THE BEES THEY SPECIFICALLYRECEIVED FOR STUDY HAD NOSEMA, BUT IT DID NOT REPRESENT THEUNIVERSAL COLLECTION THAT YOU ALL HAVE BEEN STUDYING SINCE THEFALL OF 2006?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"It’s kind of interesting that all of the samples we’ve taken and even all the samples of evenhealthy colonies all show Nosema ceranae. We can’t find another Nosema – Nosema apis.All honey bees we have examined have Nosema ceranae, but only some are from ColonyCollapse Disorder hives. And there is a treatment for Nosema ceranae that beekeepersuse. So, Nosema ceranae certainly is a stressor, but it doesn’t seem to be the smoking gunthat we were looking for.THE FACT THAT BOTH HEALTHY AND COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER BEESWOULD HAVE NOSEMA FITS AGAIN INTO PROF. COX-FOSTER’S HYPOTHESISTHAT THIS WAS A SYMPTOM OF IMMUNE COLLAPSE.Yes. It seems to be a stronger hypothesis as the days go by that something is affecting thebees’ immune system and many of these things we are finding, which are normalpathogens are proliferating because the bees’ immune system cannot handle them.IT SOUNDS AS IF THE CALIFORNIA RESEARCHERS HAD NOT STUDIED THECOLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER SCIENCE GROUP’S WORK FROM DECEMBER2006 ONWARD. THEY MADE A LEAP BASED ON A FINDING AS OPPOSED TOPLACING THE FINDING IN THE CONTEXT OF, LET’S SAY, THE IDEA OFSUPPRESSED IMMUNE SYSTEMS MAKING THE BEES GENERALLYVULNERABLE TO MORE PATHOGENS?Yes. They made a leap. We just need to collaborate more so we can move ahead and seewhat we can find.AS YOU AND I SPEAK ON MAY 2, 2007, IS IT CORRECT TO DATE THAT THERESTILL IS NOT AN ANSWER TO COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER?No, there is not. In fact, I’m going down (near Ft. Myers, Florida) and take a whole otherseries of bee samples from some commercial beekeepers. And we’re getting reports fromother parts of the country that they are just now finding it as spring comes and this isongoing.”The first week in May 2007, the National Program Leader for the U. S. Department ofAgriculture’s bee and pollination program told Associated Press that if the honey beecollapse continues to worsen, Americans could end up “stuck with grains and water. Thisis the biggest general threat to our food supply.” More Countries Reporting Massive Honey BeeDisappearances: China, Taiwan, Guatemala and BrazilBees outside hive at the Blackhorse Apiary Beekeeping Centre in Surrey, U.K.Colony Collapse Disorder has spread to the U.K., eight other European countries, China,Guatemala and Brazil. Image © 2007 by Matt Cardy, Getty Images.At the end of April 2007, there were two important meetings concerning the disappearinghoney bee phenomenon known as Colony Collapse Disorder. One was a meeting ofscientists and beekeepers at the USDA laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland. The other was aHouse Subcommittee Horticulture meeting organized by Florida Congressman AlceeHastings. His state’s beekeepers have been badly hurt by honey bee losses."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The Apiary Inspectors of America now estimate that at least a quarter of the 2.4 millionbee colonies in the United States have disappeared since the fall of 2006. Some honey beecolonies have entirely disappeared in only two days. Asia and Southern Hemisphere1) China2) Taiwan3) Guatemala4) BrazilScientists, beekeepers and government investigators learned that China is now reportingbee disappearances, along with Brazil and Guatemala. That means the Colony CollapseDisorder now extends into the Southern Hemisphere. And on April 26th, Taiwan wasadded to the list. Reuters reported that over the past two months, farmers in three Taiwanregions have notified authorities that bees are gone. Taiwan has been unusually warm andentomologists at National Taiwan University wonder if global warming, combined withnicotine-based pesticides that affect bee memories, could be the cause. North America1) Canada (Ontario and Saskatchewan provinces)2) 27 states Map-in-progress from: http://maarec.cas.psu.edu/February 2007 map of CCD-affected states in orange by Bee Alert and MAAREC.In North America, CCD has been reported by 27 American states now and two provincesin Canada – Saskatchewan and Ontario. EuropeIn Europe so far, nine nations are reporting deserted honey bee hives:1) Spain2) Poland3) Greece4) Croatia5) Switzerland6) Italy7) Portugal8) Germany9) EnglandResearchers have found multiple viruses, the Nosema ceranae protozoan and various fungiin the affected bees, suggesting that whatever is happening, the immune systems of thebees is severely weakened. Prof. Diana Cox-Foster, a Pennsylvania State Universityentomologist, told me she has never seen five viruses combined with several unidentifiedfungi all in a bee gut at the same time. “This is extremely unusual,” she said."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"A USDA laboratory in North Carolina is now studying bee bodies to test for 117 chemicals.The one pesticide that is at the top of most scientific lists of possible culprits in ColonyCollapse Disorder are the relatively new nicotine-based pesticides such as Imidacloprid.Ironically, when these Neonicitinoids came on the market, manufacturers thought thenicotine-based chemicals would be less toxic in the environment. But no one had donedetailed studies about the affects of nicotine-based pesticides on honey bees and otherpollinators until recently. It’s been confirmed that the nicotine-based toxins can impair beememories, which might explain why the bee hives are deserted. Perhaps the bees arebecoming disoriented and unable to fly back home.One of the contributors to the USDA meeting in Maryland on April 23 to 24, was JerryHayes, Chief of the Apiary Section in the Florida Dept. of Agriculture in Gainesville. Iasked him what was discussed at the USDA meeting about the fact that the ColonyCollapse Disorder is not going away this spring, but seems to be expanding into China,Taiwan and the Southern Hemisphere.Interview:Jerry Hayes, Chief, Apiary Section, Florida Department of Agriculture, Gainesville,Florida: “Well, at the meeting I was able to attend in Beltsville, Maryland, at USDA forthe Colony Collapse Disorder Working Group that was assembled, there was discussionabout how we can partner with Europeans and our colleagues in South America. And alsowe had word yesterday (April 24, 2007) that China is experiencing this thing. So, this is aglobal issue and global problem.So what does that mean from a global standpoint? Is this a new pathogen? Is this a newpest? Is it chemicals we use in developing countries and production agriculture? So, itopens up a whole new Pandora’s Box. Cell Phone Towers and Microwave Frequencies?WHAT ABOUT THE ISSUE OF CELL PHONE TOWERS AND THE SPREAD OFMICROWAVES? RECENTLY GERMAN RESEARCH MADE HEADLINES IN THELAST TWO WEEKS FROM EUROPE. COULD YOU COMMENT ON WHAT YOUKNOW ABOUT THAT SO FAR?This certainly was a topic on the periphery in the Colony Collapse Working Group meetingin Maryland, but none of it was taken too seriously because apparently if you read thewhole paper, there was no statistical evidence that cell phones or microwaves or magneticradiation was involved (with CCD). The way I understood it was that a group in Germanythat is anti-technology kind of released this microwave news with a spin to get the media’sattention since the media has already given so much attention to the Colony CollapseDisorder. So, the news release was not taken very seriously by any of my colleagues.COULD YOU COMMENT ON THE WORK OF BEE ALERT AND JERRYBROMENSHENK, PH.D., AND THEIR STUDY ON MICROWAVES AND BEES?Yes. Dr. Jerry Bromenshenk from the University of Montana was at the CCD WorkingGroup meeting earlier this week and he actually offered that they had looked at thatresearch several years ago by putting cell phones and big electromagnetic fields aroundcolonies just to see if this was going to be a problem and might be an issue that needed tobe looked at more closely. They were not able to find any causative problems from them(cell phones and electromagnetic fields).It seems that all bees at some level are being affected by whatever the causative organismor toxin is that causes CCD. Nicotine-Based Pesticides?WHEN WE TALKED IN EARLY MARCH, THERE WERE A LOT OF QUESTIONSABOUT THE NEONICITINOIDS, SPECIFICALLY IMIDACLOPRID AND OTHERNICOTINE-BASED PESTICIDES THAT CAME ON THE MARKET IN RECENTYEARS. HAS THERE BEEN ANY PROGRESS IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THEFACT THAT THE NEONICITINOIDS INTERFERE WITH THE BEES’ ABILITY TOREMEMBER?There certainly is existing data out there. There was a representative from Bayer, a"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"company that makes some of the Neonicitinoids. I believe Syngenta was also on theconference call line at our meeting and they were all very helpful. They would certainlylike to get to the bottom of this also. So, there is data out there and these Neonicitinoidsstay in the soil for a very long time. In fact, data shows that in temperate climates wherethey have winter, it’s not unusual for those chemicals to stay active in the soil for a year toeighteen months or longer.IF MORE KEEPS BEING ADDED, THEN IT WOULD BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLEFOR PEOPLE TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE EXPOSURE OF THEPOLLINATORS WOULD BE TO NICOTINE-BASED PESTICIDES THAT KEEPBEING BUILT UP.That’s exactly right and there is an interesting study of neonicicotinoids, and Imidaclopridin particular, on potatoes to control the Colorado potato beetle. So, the researchers appliedit and it was systemic and controlled the Colorado potato beetle.So, the next year they planted potatoes, the researchers did not treat the crop again (withImidacloprid) and they found that potatoes grown on that same soil still killed theColorado potato beetle.THAT MEANS IT WAS STRONG ENOUGH IN THE SOIL WITHOUT EVENANOTHER APPLICATION?Yes. Then what happens if you do follow directions and make the application every yearfor five years. How long does it stay in the soil? And what does it mean for crops that aredeep rooted? What does it mean for crops that are shallow rooted? We have a lot ofquestions here, Linda.I THINK IT WAS DR. COX-FOSTER WHO POINTED OUT TO ME THAT THEAMOUNT OF NICOTINE-BASED PESTICIDE THAT COULD IMPACT THE BEESMIGHT BE MUCH LOWER THAN ANYBODY HAS BEEN MEASURING. THEQUESTION OF ACCUMULATION OVER TIME IS NOT UNDERSTOOD AND ITMIGHT BE THAT IS THE BIG CULPRIT?Yes, it could be.IF IT IS, HOW DO WE PUT THE GENIE BACK IN THE BOTTLE? THENEONICITINOIDS ARE SO WIDESPREAD OUT IN THE WORLD.Yes, and that is the hard thing about it. The neonicitinoids replaced OPs, organicphosphates, which are very persistent in toxic chemicals. So, when they found this newchemistry (nicotine-based), it was thought to be good. Now, the neonicitinoids – or at leastImidacloprid – has come off patent. So, it will be used even more as the price goes down,but we certainly don’t want to pit one industry against another unless there is areplacement. We don’t want beekeepers pointing fingers at growers for using pesticides topreserve their industry, nor do we want the grower industry to point their fingers at thebeekeepers saying, ‘You made me lose my business because I can’t use these chemicalsanymore.’ So, it’s a tight rope, Linda.WHAT IF IT COMES DOWN TO SURVIVAL VERSUS MONEY?I vote for survival, but I’m only one voice in the wilderness here.YES. I’M ASSUMING THAT HUMANS AND ANIMALS WOULD WANT TOSURVIVE. IF IT BECOMES SCIENTIFICALLY PROVED THAT THENEONICITINOIDS AND PERHAPS OTHER PESTICIDES SUCH AS FUNGICIDESALL LAYERED TOGETHER ARE KILLING OUT THE POLLILNATORS OF THEWORLD, AREN’T WE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT A STOP TO THE USE OFPESTICIDES AT SOME LEVEL?Ye s .HOW WILL THAT HAPPEN? THAT’S WHAT I MEAN ABOUT PUTTING THE GENIEBACK IN THE BOTTLE.Coming from a government bureaucratic environment here, the proper course of actionwould be to get the scientific data that proves this, submit the scientific data to the EPAand then they would have no choice but to pull the product/s.IN TERMS OF SCIENCE, WHO IS NOW STUDYING THE NICOTINE-BASEDPESTICIDES THE MOST IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE POLLINATORS?At the Working Group meeting, pesticides are on the list of things we want to look at, butuntil the money is let out to USDA to in turn distribute, there have been no collaboratorsdesignated or identified that will look at that particular issue at this time."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"SO THERE IS NO SCIENCE BASED ON THE NICOTINE-BASED PESTICIDES INRELATIONSHIP TO POLLINATORS BECAUSE THERE IS NO ADDITIONALFUNDING SO FAR?Ye s , m’ a m.IS THIS WHAT THE HOUSE CONGRESSIONAL SUBCOMMITTEE IS ADDRESSINGIN TERMS OF HAVING PROPOSALS THAT THEY CAN FUND SPECIFICALLY TOTRY TO GET A HANDLE ON WHAT IS HAPPENING TO POLLINATORS IN NORTHAMERICA?Yes, exactly, because of the media attention and the reality of the loss of this key niche inagriculture, our legislators in Washington are keenly aware that help in resources needs tobe devoted to the honey bee industry. Electromagnetic Field Changes?SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED THAT MAYBE IT HAS SOMETHING TO DOWITH SOLAR RADIATION OR MAGNETIC FIELD CHANGES AROUND THEEARTH. IS THERE ANY SCIENTIST SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT MAGNETICFIELD CHANGES ON THE EARTH THAT MIGHT AFFECT THE BEES?No. The feeling about the magnetic fields was that it certainly should be looked at, but weall have a hard time thinking that on a U. S./North American/global basis that all the beeswould be affected in the same way at the same time. There are blanks and gaps in theelectromagnetic fields. So, it seems to us that it’s probably more likely to be some type oftoxin – whether it’s manmade or comes from a bacteria or fungus or what have you, ratherthan just one thing we can blame CCD on. Changes in electromagnetic fields could be apart of the problem, but we don’t think it is the primary part. \"Pesticide Cocktails\" Overwhelming Honey Bees?WHAT WOULD BE AT THE TOP OF YOUR PRIORITY LIST IN TERMS OFPOSSIBLE CAUSES?We certainly have to look at environmental toxins and agricultural toxins. Then we have toalso look at miticides that beekeepers have been using for some time to control parasiticmites (varroa) that were introduced several years ago from Asia that suck the blood ofhoney bees. Then we have to look at the carriers of these materials. Then we have to lookat nutrition issues and fungicides.Varroa mites are about 1 millimeter longand suck blood from both adult honey bees and theirdeveloping brood. Image courtesy Univ. of Kentucky.Honey bees can forage in about a two to two and a half mile radius of their colonyefficiently. So, they can bring back a lot of things from the environment, from industry,from waste products. The honey bees can also be exposed to many things in an agriculturalsetting. Bees wax is a chemical sponge. Everything the bee brings back in, many times it issucked up and stored in the bees wax. It’s almost like a hair sample from a human head.Scientists can tell pretty much what a person has been exposed to over several weeks ormonths. It’s the same thing with bees wax.So, what happens when bees wax absorbs many different things? What’s the synergismwith bees wax? What does that mean when honey bees are exposed to pesticides 24 hours"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"a day, 7 days a week, for 365 days a year? Data that was shared at the meeting indicatedthat there were a lot of things in there (sampled CCD bees wax), including metabolites. Aspesticide chemicals break down into metabolites, the metabolites can be more toxic thanthe actual toxin.One, you have to identify the (metabolites) and then you have to ask: What does this meanin the context of everything the honey bees are being exposed to? This takes analysis withurgency because we can’t have beekeepers losing 30% to 60% or more of their beecolonies next year as well. Then it’s just going to get worse. We need to come up withsome answers and recommendations pretty quickly. 2007 Shortage of Pollinators in U. S.IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT RIGHT NOW AS DR. COX-FOSTER TOLD ME IN LATEAPRIL, ‘THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH POLLINATORS NOW TO GO AROUND INTHE UNITED STATES?’It’s getting pretty slim. We’ve had some tight situations here in Florida where growers havenot been able to get pollinators. With the demands of the almond crop in Californiadominating the need for pollinators in the next few years, the question is: If every beehivein the U. S. goes to almonds, what does that mean for the states the bees traveled from?What does it mean for watermelons, blue berries, cranberries, cucumbers, and apples? Ican go on and on and on. The health and vitality of the honey beekeeping industry reallyneeds to be fostered.HOW CAN IT BE IF THE BEES KEEP DISAPPEARING?Yes, that’s an excellent question. Exactly! That’s why we have to work as hard as we canand as intelligently as we can and get as many resources as we can so we can answer thosequestions. We certainly don’t want a shortage of fruits and nuts and berries to be thedriving force behind this. \"It’s pretty spooky we still don't have answers.\"THIS IS THE SEVENTH MONTH SINCE OCTOBER 2006 WHEN DAVEHACKENBERG (HACKENBERG APIARY, PENNSYLVANIA) FIRST WENT TOPENN STATE AND THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA SAYING THAT HE HADLOST SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 40% TO 60% OF HIS HIVES. YET, THERE STILLARE NO ANSWERS. WITH MORE THAN 100 SCIENTISTS TRYING TO FIGUREOUT WHAT IS GOING ON, ISN’T IT REMARKABLE THERE ARE NO ANSWERS?Yes, and it’s pretty spooky we still don't have answers. We have a tendency in the researchcommunity to have healthy egos, meaning that if you give me a problem and I have theappropriate equipment and we can partner with other colleagues, that anything could besolved. After seven months and not being able to solve something that on the surfacewould seem to be pretty easy to solve, it’s confusing and frustrating and is bringing somelevel of anxiety to all of us to work even harder.THE FACT THAT CCD IS SPREADING IN BOTH THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERNHEMISPHERES, WHEN YOU WERE IN THE CCD MEETING, WHAT WERE THECOMMENTS?Concern. And if I could use the word fear because we in this CCD group know howimportant honey bees are to the production of the foods we eat. And we have not eventalked about the fruits, nuts and berries that honey bees pollinate that feed wildlife.With CCD spreading in both hemispheres and not having answers after seven months ofresearch, there are a lot of anxious feeling out there.WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THIS HUGE MYSTERY THAT THE HONEY BEES AREDISAPPEARING GLOBALLY, INTUITIVELY DO YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF GUTINSTINCT ABOUT WHAT COULD BE GOING ON?Yes. I think personally we have a new, or more robust, pathogen that combined withchemical toxins that are causing the honey bees’ fragile immune systems to be weakenedfurther. It has taken hold because all reports are from developed or developing nations thatuse chemicals quite widely. With global trade and movement of organisms throughout theworld very quickly, that makes sense to me.BUT DOESN’T IT SEEM STRANGE THAT SCIENTISTS IN EUROPE, CANADA, THE"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"UNITED STATES AND NOW THE ONES THAT WOULD BE LOOKING IN BRAZIL,CHINA AND GUATEMALA, THAT NO ONE HAS COME UP WITH A COMMONDENOMINATOR IN ALL OF THE REGIONS?Yes, and I think that’s because there is not a single common denominator. I think there areprobably three or four common denominators and they are all intersecting at one time. Thebees are holding up their little legs and saying, ‘I give up.’BUT WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED AT THE END OF 2006 GOING INTO THEFALL THAT CHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS YEARS?Yes. Excellent question. Those are all science-based questions. Neither I nor anyone elseknows what that could be that would be on a global basis.I GUESS IT’S PRAY THERE CAN BE AN ANSWER HERE SOON. IF NOT, WHAT DOYOU GUYS DO?It’s not ‘what do you guys do?’ It’s what do we do? We’re all on this spaceship Earthtogether. How, with all our other brothers and sisters in the world, how do we approachthis? Then, how do we fix or solve a problem? And also, how do we share resources andnot be quite so selfish in doing that? I’m not quite sure we humans have learned how to dothat well enough yet.” Part 2 - Environmental Emergency Updates: Ebola-like Virus in Great LakesMore Information:If viewers have more information about disappearing honey bees and other pollinators inyour area, please email me at earthfiles@earthfiles.comPlease see other Earthfiles reports about the disappearing honey bee phenomenon.
