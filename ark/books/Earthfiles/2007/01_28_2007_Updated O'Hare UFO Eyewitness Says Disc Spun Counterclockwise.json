January 27, 2007 Gary, Indiana - The Chicago O'Hare Airport disc sighting by a dozenUnited employees on November 7, 2006, was apparently seen and photographed by manyother people. Yesterday, an Indiana resident came forward to go on the record without herreal name to describe what she and a friend saw from O'Hare's international parking lotbefore 5 p.m. local time. She asked to be called \"Jane Doe.\" Her background includesthree years of college and her work has ranged from radio news reporting to culinarytraining and cooking in restaurants.Update: January 28, 2007 - Jane Doe submission of map after January 27th interview tohelp orient her driving and international parking lot locations, estimated aerial location ofthe pearl-surfaced UFO and estimated location of camera that took image of disk in upperright (above):"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Google map with graphic overlays by Jane Doe to help orient her driving and internationalparking lot locations (green dots); estimated aerial location of the pearl-surfaced UFO and estimated locationof camera that took image of disk in upper right frame (yellow punch pinson runway; and Manheim Road referenced in her interview.Interview:Jane Doe (requested anonymity), Gary, Indiana : “A friend and I had gone to O’Hareto the international terminal to pick up a friend of ours who we went to school with. He isa pilot on a run that brings him from France to the U. S. We had gone to pick him up as wehave done every few months. In fact, I’m at O’Hare at least two or three times a monthpicking up assorted friends and dropping them off.His plane was due in close to 5 p.m. We got there a bit early and were going to park ininternational. But I never take interstates when possible. I was born in the Washington, D.C. area and there is a beltway there that is an anathema to me. So, I try to take surfacestreets and I always cut through Chicago rather than take the interstate. So, I was takingIrving Park over to Manheim Road, which runs directly into O’Hare Airport. Where I turnonto Manheim, you only have a couple of blocks to go before the airport and airportproperty starts right around you then.From when I turned onto Manheim, there was road work so I was attendant to that. And assoon as I put my attention forward at the airport, I saw it (disk in sky). It was very low.The cloud cover that day was very low as well. It was a uniform cloud cover. It was notlike there was a cloud here and there. It was a uniform gray sky all day. I saw this object.The object was ahead of me and to the left, very north-northwest of where I was and alsovery close within several blocks of me. I wanted to keep watching the object, so when Ipulled off to go to the international terminal parking lot, I pulled into a part of the lotwhere I could keep watching this thing. Once we parked in the parking lot and got out andstarted looking at it, there were already some other people who were looking at it. Then forthose who weren’t, if they walked near anybody who was watching, those people pointedit out in the sky. There had to be at least two dozen people that I know were watching it atthat (international terminal parking lot) location. Description of Aerial Object\"There was a lustrous quality to it like a pearl that almost madethe metal seem like warm and soft and fuzzy instead of a hard, metallic object.\"Its appearance was unusual because it seemed very reflective of color, almost mirror-like.Yet, at the same time it did not impress me as being a highly polished thing. There aresome things about the surface of this thing that I can’t really express in words. It in no waygave the appearance of a highly mirrored object, yet I could tell when I saw it on ManheimRoad, for example, that the object looked more to me like the cell phone photograph (discin upper right of photo and O’Hare Airport in bottom left with angled horizon).When I was on Manheim Road at an angle that showed me more of the side of the craft,that’s really the closest thing to what I saw (first cell phone image). It had that same lighton top and darkening on the bottom, which when I got into a position in the parking lot andcould see the bottom of the thing more that was even more clear as a dark gray bottom"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"effect under it. But it had kind of a pearly quality from the side when the light was morefully on it.When I was at the international terminal, I could get more of an underneath angle andfrom there it looked like a darker gray and you could see it was a much lighter color uptowards the top. I got the feeling that the shadow on the bottom had something to do withreflectivity of the object.I got the sense the craft was rotating somewhat rapidly in a counterclockwise motion. I justcaught this motion that wasn’t just random distortion around it – there seemed to be acyclical pattern involved. It didn’t really seem to wobble, unless it was such a fast wobblethat accounts for the lack of sharpness of the object.COULD YOU ESTIMATE ITS DIAMETER?I thought at the time from the side was it was probably around 25 feet in diameter at most,just based on my proximity to the two angles I saw it (from Manheim Road and from theinternational parking lot). And I would guess it was about 6 to 8 feet in its height at thehighest point.SIX TO EIGHT FEET HIGH AND TWENTY-FIVE FEET IN DIAMETER. COULDYOU EXPLAIN MORE ABOUT THE USE OF PEARLY SURFACE?There was something about the surface – I don’t know if it was caused by the rotation –but on the one hand it seemed to mirror whatever sources of light and shadow were aroundit. Yet, at the same time, it didn’t strike me as a highly polished metallic surface.YET, IT APPEARED LIKE THE LUSTRE OF A PEARL?Exactly. There was a lustrous quality to it like a pearl that almost made the metal seem likewarm and soft and fuzzy instead of a hard, metallic object.AND IT WAS DEFINITELY SPINNING COUNTERCLOCKWISE?That is my impression. It seemed there was a rhythmic motion, very rapid, but consistentin a counterclockwise direction.WOULD YOU SAY IT WAS EGG-SHAPED OR ANOTHER SHAPE?I would not say egg-shaped because the elliptical part of it was really even, whereas an eggis kind of bigger on one side than the other. This was more an even shape, but a verycurved shape. I know some of the people who first described it said it looked like aFrisbee. But a Frisbee is a lot flatter than this was. It was not the stereotypical disc. Therewas a lot more structure to it than that.IF AN EGG WERE EVEN PROPORTIONED, WOULD THE DISK HAVE BEENEGG-SHAPED IN THAT DEFINITION?Yes, a bit more when seen from the side. When seen from underneath or at the angle I sawfrom the parking lot, you could kind of get a more disc-like look from it.SO IT WAS ROUND, BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PERHAPS LIKE AN EXPANDEDDISC, TALLER.Exactly. It would have to be taller in the middle with no serious sharp angles at the end –just rounded curve at the sides, rather than the usual saucer-on-saucer straight edge kind ofjoint. Round Craft Below Low Cloud CeilingHOW HIGH WAS IT ABOVE YOU AS YOU STOOD WATCHING IT IN THE PARKINGLOT?I wasn’t directly underneath it by a long shot. I was at an angle to it at that point. Where Istopped, I was looking close to due west, but that still put it over the main terminal airportarea. But I was well under a quarter mile from it. I estimated at the time that the cloudswere probably around 1800 feet high.I THINK OFFICIALLY IT WAS CLOSER TO 1500 FEET.It was a very low ceiling day and this thing was below the clouds. I wouldn’t say it wasmuch below the clouds."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"LET’S SAY THEN THAT IT WAS LESS THAN A QUARTER MILE FROM WHEREYOU ALL WERE IN THE INTERNATIONAL PARKING LOT AND MAYBE ATABOUT 1,000 FEET?Yes, I would say 1,000 to 1,200 feet. It was a little under the cloud level. It was a hazyday, as well, though. But it was not foggy. Visibility was not that great, but within thatquarter-mile distance, it was perfect. You couldn’t mistake what you were seeing. Many Watched for At Least10 Minutes and Took PhotographsWe watched it from the international parking lot for about ten minutes (and about 5 moreminutes before while driving). There were many people there taking photos – cell phonesand digital cameras. So, there ARE pictures out there.One gentleman was in a little group that had clustered around where I was standing, he hada digital camera and he was planning to pick up relatives “from the old country.” Hehadn’t seen them in years, so he had taken his camera to photograph them. He stood therejust shooting photo after photo after photo. There are many photographs out there. That ispart of my purpose in contacting AboveTopSecret.com about this because it had peopledoing research on the photos and a core group of them sounded serious enough that Idecided it can’t hurt to email and talk to you and say to other people: ‘This story is notgoing to die. And you’re not necessarily going to be considered a freak. And look, you cando this anonymously. Please get the photos out!’This was the most plainly visible event and for it to be coming down at an airport likeO’Hare in the daytime, very obviously not caring who is watching – and indeed might besoliciting observations! I really thought the thing was going to land. You realized when youwere watching it that if that happens, everything is going to be different from now on,every single thing in the world!’I really thought that whatever is in that thing – and believe me, there was no mistaking itfor a lenticular cloud or any weather phenomena (Federal Aviation Administration tried todismiss the multiple eyewitness sighting as a weather phenomenon). This was very clearlysomething solid, something metallic, and something under control. Atmosphere Disturbed Around Aerial Craft\"It was almost visually like if you were watching a distant cloud of gnats.You would not be able to see the gnats, but you would beable to see the impression of motion.\"YOU DESCRIBED THAT IT WAS SPINNING. COULD YOU SEE ANY KIND OFDISTORTION IN THE AIR AROUND IT?Yes, there was distortion very close to the craft. It did not at any point expand out from itthat I saw. It was very close to the craft. It was almost as if you could see constant motionin the air very close to it.It almost seemed like the air was excited around it – that there was motion in it. It wasalmost visually like if you were watching a distant cloud of gnats. You would not be able tosee the gnats, but you would be able to see the impression of motion. It was kind of likethat around the object. Disc Punched Hole Through Clouds\"The hole was there. Everybody was just open-mouthedthat the craft did go through the clouds. People gasped. Several peoplescreamed because nobody had anticipated motion.\"When it did take off, it went from basically zero to God only knows how fast. There wasno acceleration. It just went. It did punch a hole through the clouds. [ See 010207Earthfiles. ] I wasn’t directly underneath the hole. It kind of angled in our directionslightly to the east, I believe. It did leave a hole and it didn’t even seem that the cloudsmoved as it punched through. But then after it was gone, they began filling back in. Thatwas it. The hole was there. Everybody was just open-mouthed that the craft did go through"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the clouds. People gasped. Several people screamed because nobody had anticipatedmotion. At that point, most of us had been watching it for at least a few minutes at thatpoint.SEVERAL FOR TEN MINUTES.At least because there were several people who were watching it when I got into theparking lot.AND YOU WERE THERE FOR AT LEAST TEN MINUTES.I was there for about ten minutes and I had seen it on Manheim Road for about three orfour minutes earlier. So, overall from when I first saw it to when it punched a hole in theclouds, probably thirteen to fourteen minutes.YOU WERE SEEING IT STATIONARY WITH A SPINNING QUALITY AND THISGNAT-LIKE DISTURBANCE OF THE ATMOSPHERE AROUND IT, WHEN ITMOVED, WAS IT JUST A STRAIGHT SHOT UP? WHAT HAPPENED?From a dead stop, suddenly you saw the motion. You saw it go up those few hundred feet,but it was almost so fast that you couldn’t even process it until after it was gone. Therewas no acceleration. No noise that I could tell. But there were jet engines and there wasthe heavily trafficked road between us and the object. But there really seemed to be nonoise that I could perceive from it. Probably the United workers fairly well under it couldtell better on that.It just at a slight angle in our direction, which would have been slightly east, it just wasgone!THE HOLE WAS INSTANTANEOUS?Instantaneous.COULD YOU SEE BLUE SKY THROUGH IT?I wasn’t under the hole right under it to see that. I could not see blue sky, but I could seethe hole, the shadow. I could see there was a hole there. I do know that some people tookphotos of that. I can’t tell you how much I want to see the photos that I know are out therecoming out to the public. There were plenty of people with digital cameras. And therewere several cars that stopped on Manheim Road, which is a very busy road at that time ofday who had stopped who were taking photos of the object. There have to be at leastseveral dozen photographs of this thing out there.This was the most impactful sighting I can imagine, unless it had dropped down completelyto the ground and entities got out! I cannot imagine what it would take to be moreconvincing to anyone than seeing this object. There was no way it was anything other thana solid metallic object, (spinning counterclockwise).\"More Information:If viewers have more information about the November 7, 2007, Chicago O'Hare Airporthovering disc over concourse C-17, please email me: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.For further information about aerial discs and other intelligences, please see reports belowin the Earthfiles Archives and my books, An Alien Harvest and the 2-volume Glimpses ofOther Realities, in the Earthfiles Shop.• 01/02/2007 -- Grey Aerial Disk Reported by Chicago O'Hare United Airlines Pilots and Mechanics• 06/22/2006 -- Horse Suspended in Mid-Air Near Milan, Italy, Apartment• 11/24/2006 -- Scientific Data Supports Mutilated Montana Cow Dropped from Sky and Bounced• 10/19/2006 -- Another Cattle Mutilation in Pondera County, Montana• 10/02/2006 -- Unusual Deaths of Six Female Goats in White Salmon, Washington• 09/20/2006 -- Animal Mutilations Increase Again in Argentina• 09/20/2006 -- Updated: Three Sets of Concentric Rings in South Texas Field• 08/23/2006 -- More Cat and Dog Mutilations• 07/01/2006 -- Cattle Mutilation and Glowing Discs in Saskatchewan, Canada• 06/29/2006 -- Another Horse Suspended in the Air• 06/28/2006 -- Half Cats in Destin, Florida, and Beheaded Animals in Rochester, N.
