It was just winddamage at one end of the field because the night before it had been particularly windy.When I got there, I met up with some Dutch researchers from Holland that JanetOssebaard had brought over and also some American people that Denni Clark had as atour group. We were looking at the wheat and saying it was just wind damage. I decided tospend the night on top of Knap Hill, which is directly in front the East Field.The center yellow circle highlights the location of the huge East Fieldnear Alton Priors, Wiltshire, beneath Knap Hill, highlighted at upper right,not far from Woodborough Hill, highlighted at lower center.So, that evening I borrowed a sleeping bag off Charles Mallett at the Silent Circle Café togo up and do my vigil with Paula. When we got up there, we met up with a man calledWinston (‘Win’) Keech, who is a UFO investigator. He had three cameras set up on the hilland two cameras set up on his car (jeep), which was parked a little way down on the hill.So, he had five cameras in all.On top of the hill, he had three cameras set up on tripods. One was a Sony digital stillcamera. Another was a Sony VX2100, which he told me is much more sensitive to lightthan the human eye. He also had an image-enhancing camera, which was hooked up to aJVC D-700 recorder, so that every time he scanned the field with the image enhancer, itwould record what was scanned.Sony DCR-VX2100 light sensitive professional digital camera.THE TWO CAMERAS IN WIN'S JEEP WERE MOUNTED HOW?They were mounted on the roof. They were infrared and visible light capacity. One wasaimed at East Field and one was aimed at Milk Hill. And they were hooked up toVHS/VCR video recorders with 4-hour tapes in them.WHY WAS MR.

I put JanetOssebaard’s Contact video on the TV set and he saw somebody in the video give apersonal testimony about a ball of light they had seen forming a crop circle some years agoand Winston Keech got quite excited. So, I asked him what happened and he said, ‘Oh, Isaw that ball of light make that formation some years ago, but I didn’t know anyone elsehad seen it!’Winston Keech, UFO and Crop Circle Investigator, Yorkshire, England.Image © 2007 by Terje Toftenes.Win told me he was going back to Yorkshire on Monday (July 9) where he lived and hewas going to do one more night watch on Friday to Saturday night (July 6 to 7, 2007). Idon’t remember him telling me he was going to be Knap Hill – but he just said he wasgoing to do another night. And off he went.So, on my own when I ended up going to the top of Knap Hill with Paula, I immediatelyrecognized Win as he came over to us. We sat down where he had all his cameras set up.He picked up his image-enhancing camera and scanned around the East Field which wecould see very clearly through his equipment. We could see the tramlines. He scannedacross (the wheat) and we could see there was a field of rapeseed next to (the wheat) andwe could see the road and everything very clearly.

Then, just around 3 AM, (video analysis shows 3:08 AM - first reportwas 3:13 AM for flash and then refined in analysis to 3:08 AM), we saw a great big flashof light, which I can describe was almost like lightning, but covered the whole land andwas like a big camera flash going off everywhere.YOU DID SEE THAT FLASH WITH YOUR HUMAN EYES?With our eyes, we registered a great big flash, all three of us.SUCH A BRIGHT FLASH SHOULD HAVE BLASTED OUT THE INFRAREDCAMERA. WHAT DID THE INFRARED CAMERA SHOW?It was the infrared camera that just shows the EMP pulse.\" Norwegian Video Producer Joins Winston Keechto Analyze Infrared Camera VideoTerje Toftenes, Video Producer and Managing Director of Strat and Toftenes in Sandvika,Norway, got a call on Tuesday, July 10, from a colleague in Wiltshire telling Terje that notonly had one of the biggest crop formations in Wiltshire history appeared early in themorning on Saturday, July 7, 2007, in the East Field, but there had been cameras runningwhen a very bright flash of light was seen from Knap Hill by three eyewitnesses. Terjestudied electronic engineering in a Norwegian university and later worked as a TVproducer for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corp. until 1978, then managed an Audio-VisualDepartment for a Norwegian public relations company until 1986. That year, he foundedhis own video company to produce industrial films. Today, Strat and Toftenes produces formajor clients in the offshore oil, gas and shipping industries.But like Gary King, after Terje stepped into his first English crop formation in 2003, hewas haunted by their beauty and the mystery of what they could mean. He ended upproducing a documentary for Norwegian television that was translated into an Englishversion in 2006 as Crossovers From Another Dimension. (See More Information below.)He's now working on a follow up documentary."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"So when Terje received the phone call about a massive pattern of circles estimated tocover 96,600 square feet, or 2.25 acres, with more than 95 circles (final count was 150) ina very strange design spread across 1,033 feet and 490 feet wide - plus three eyewitnesseswho saw a bright flash of light while light-sensitive and infrared cameras were set up - hegot on the first plane out of Norway and headed for the East Field. Terje went over indetail with Winston Keech what the camera equipment had recorded. For everyone, it wasa sad irony that the exciting human conversation distracted attention from periodicallyvideotaping the East Field and changing tapes. Terje and Winston discovered only twoframes in the infrared camera had recorded an electromagnetic pulse of some kind that lefta 4 milliseconds trace of what Terje thinks are the trees atop Woodborough Hill in thedistance, but nothing else from the East Field itself.However, if you start with:- the 1:35 AM Sony light-sensitive videotape that Win Keech shot while panning the EastField that was so dark in the frames above;- add the three eyewitness naked eye sighting of the bright, flash of light that came at 3:08AM, according to the infrared camera;- view the infrared video frames leading up to the last two seconds before the videotaperan out of that camera right after the 3:08 AM electromagnetic disturbance (first reportwas 3:13 AM for flash and then refined in analysis to 3:08 AM);- consider that the trees atop Woodborough Hill are in 4 milliseconds of a flash in anotherwise dark frame;- include the approximate 3:20 AM viewing of all three eyewitnesses through the Sonylight-sensitive camera in which all three could see a shadow in the East Field they assumedmust be a new formation;- then look at the approximate 3:20 AM Sony still digital frame camera at the top of thisreport that clearly shows the astounding wheat formation. Analysis by Terje ToftenesTerje Toftenes, Video Producer and Managing Director, Strat and Toftenes,Sandvika, Norway: \"At 1:35 AM, (July 7, 2007) it was so dark, so totally black in thefield. The only thing you can see from the video recording was the horizon and some lightsfrom houses in the distance in the horizon. But in the field, it was totally black and I’vetried to enhance, or amplify, the video frames. But all I get is recording noise from therecording device.YOUR IMPLICATION IS THAT IF THERE HAD BEEN ANYBODY HIDING IN THEFIELD OR TRYING TO WALK THE TRAMLINES OR EVEN HAD A HIDDENFLASHLIGHT, THE INFRARED AND STARSCOPE CAMERAS WOULD HAVESHOWED THAT VERY CLEARLY?Oh, yes. Any lights would be visible on those recordings and we have examined them backand forth during the 1:35 AM time period and there is absolutely no sign of any lights orpeople or activity in the black parts of the East Field where the formation appeared later.TERJE, WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHY WINSTON KEECH HAD5 CAMERAS ON KNAP HILL IN THE COLD AND RAIN FROM LATE FRIDAY, JULY6, TO SATURDAY, JULY 7, 2007?Fifteen years ago in 1991, Win Keech had a close encounter with a ball of light thatcreated a crop circle right in front of his eyes. And it happened in just 3 seconds. Win wasstanding in one of the corners of the East Field. A ball of light the size of a human fistappeared right in front of him and suddenly expanded to be like a big, floating pancake.Then it was about 20 feet in diameter. Then the wheat beneath this kind of golden, floatingpancake, started to wave around and lay down in a perfect circle. Then this pancake goesback to the size of a fist and slowly drifts away into some bushes and disappears. It tookthree seconds. He had one single-reflex camera and a very old video camera. But he did"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"not have the time to push the recording button. [ See: 060999 Earthfiles for another\"floating pancake\" that produced crop circle in Hoeven, Holland.]Win Keech felt that this light ball, or whatever it was, was kind of teasing him and tellinghim, ‘I’ll show you what I can do. But you cannot catch me on film. But I’m here.’ That’sthe feeling Win had.And every single summer since then, he has been down here in Wiltshire for a couple ofweeks setting up his equipment focused on the fields at night, trying to catch thisphenomenon on video. And every year, he has gotten better and better equipment, andfinally after 16 years, he is able to have a new contact with it in the East Field.YET, FOR WHATEVER REASONS, HE WAS NOT OPERATING THE CAMERAEQUIPMENT WHEN THE FLASH OF LIGHT OCCURRED.Right. Well, he also explained he had a feeling that if he had been very actively filming thefield all the time, it probably would not have occurred. Again, he felt that the phenomenonwas kind of teasing with him because the minute that the big light flashed, the three people- including Win - were in the middle of a discussion and had their focus somewhere elseother than on what was happening in the field. He said, ‘If I had been there totally alonefocusing on the field the whole time as I have done for the last 16 summers since theincident in 1991, this time probably would not have happened. ‘I have a feeling,’ he says,‘that this phenomenon is dancing with me. It invites me to dance. It’s invisible and it showsup when I least expect it. It will not show itself when I ask for it. It just shows when I’mnot aware.So, again, he felt this was an answer to his questions and encouragement to continue on hispath, developing himself as a human being.DO YOU HAVE AN EXACT TIME FOR THE FLASH OF LIGHT?Yes, the exact time for the flash seems to be 8 minutes past 3 AM (3:08 AM Wiltshire,England local time).TO SUMMARIZE, AT 1:35 AM WAS THE LAST TIME THAT THE SONY LIGHT-SENSITIVE AND INFRARED CAMERAS SHOWED DEFINITIVELY THAT THEREWAS NOTHING IN THE EAST FIELD?1:35 AM it is – that’s the last pan over the East Field where you see nothing in the field.THEN, AT 3:08 AM IS WHAT THE INFRARED CAMERA SHOWS WAS THEMOMENT OF THE LIGHT PULSE?Yes. [Post-interview and post-press conference editorial note by Terje: \"There actuallyis an uncertainty whether the Light Flash happened at 3:08 or 3:13. This because of thefact that the VHS timecode was slightly unprecise. But this makes no practical difference,so no use to mention I believe. Only thing is that in my video-interview with Win, hementions 3:13, but later he corrected this to 3:08 when analyzing the tapes. The Englishpapers therefore refer to 3:13 as presented in the videotaped interview. But again,probably a minor difference irrelevant to the total picture.\" ]WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CAMERAS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT LIGHTPULSE?At that particular moment, only two cameras were running. And in one of those cameras,the tape had run out. On the other camera, the tape ran out only two seconds after the lightpulse.THAT WAS THE INFRARED CAMERA.Yes. The cameras ran out of tape because the three people were in the middle of such aninteresting discussion about metaphysics that Win Keech forgot to change the tapes. Sowhen the light struck, he said, ‘Oh, gosh, that reminds me. I have to change the tapes.’ So,he ran down to the jeep and changed the tapes and afterwards, we see that one of thoseremoved was recording the light pulse two seconds before that tape ran out. So, that wasreally lucky! Flash of Light: 4 Milliseconds Image On Infrared VideotapeI have analyzed all this frame-by-frame. On the first frame where the flash happens, thereis an electronic kind of shock. You have to remember that the camera was connected to avideo recorder by a cord because this particular camera was on the rooftop of the jeep."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The recorder was inside the jeep. So, the cord picked up the light pulse because the cordwas like an antenna to electrical impulses. So, I think what I can see is that the first kind ofshock on the first video frame is from the electromagnetic shock from the flash of light.3:08 AM - Infrared Camera Frame 1 After Light FlashInfrared camera Frame 1 after 3:08 AM light flash. Camera lost sync with recorder.All video frames ©2007 by Winston Keech.On the next second frame, you see the actual flash of light (4 milliseconds) on the tiny partof the frame. Then, for the next 6 or 7 frames, the camera obviously had sync troublebecause it’s trying to regain its synchronization. The EMP pulse from the light flash was sohard that it shocked the electronics. Infrared Camera Frame 2 After Light FlashUpper 4 Milliseconds of Frame Show Trees Atop Woodborough Hill.Infrared camera Frame 2 at 3:08 AM after light flash.Terje Toftenes concluded that the upper 4 milliseconds of frameshows trees atop Woodborough Hill in upper center.SO, WE HAVE FOR SURE AT 3:08 AM THE BIG FLASH OF LIGHT THAT EFFECTSTHE CAMERAS AND THEIR SYNC AND YOU HAVE 4 MILLISECONDS ON ONEFRAME OF WHAT YOU THINK ARE THE TREES ATOP WOODBOROUGH HILL?Yes. That’s correct.NOW, WE HAVE 1:35 AM AND NOTHING IN THE EAST FIELD. AT 3:08 AM"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"THERE IS THE BIG FLASH OF LIGHT AND THE ELECTROMAGNETICDISRUPTION. WHAT IS THE NEXT TIME YOU HAVE ON VIDEO THAT SHOWSSHADOWS THAT MIGHT RELATE TO THE FORMATION BEING IN THE EASTFIELD, EVEN IN THE DARK?OK, what happens after the flash is that Win runs down to the car and changes the tapes.That takes approximately five minutes. He gets back to the top of Knap Hill and GaryKing suggests that flash of light could have meant something. ‘Maybe that’s it!’ they kindof joked. So, why not try to pan the field again even though it was totally black?Win took the most light-sensitive camera he had (Sony VX2100) which was on a tripod atthe top of Knap Hill and this again was connected to a camcorder, so it was recorded onmini-DVD tape. He pans over the field and then they saw in the viewfinder a shadow inthe field which was in the place where the crop formation was later seen as a fullformation. But in that pan after the flash of light, there was only a shadow. 3:20 AM - First Shadow of Crop Formation Seen and PhotographedTerje Toftenes enhanced this digital image taken around 3:20 AM, twelve minutesafter the big flash of light. Shadow is near center of image. Image © 2007 by Winston Keech.\"And this was approximately 12 to 13 minutes after the light pulse. We are now talkingabout 3:20 AM. That’s when they saw the first shadow and then some light came as cloudsbegan to drift away from the moon.After that, they could also see with their naked eyes that there was a shadow there andtook a picture with the digital still camera. Then they could see that the formation wasthere. From that point, the (light-sensitive) Sony video camera was also able to pick it outas well. So, from 3:20 AM (July 7, 2007), you’ve got the crop formation there. And abouta half hour later (about 3:45 AM), they could see with their eyes."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Another non-enhanced frame taken around 3:45 AM, July 7, 2007, that clearly showsthe huge formation in the East Field, Alton Priors, Wiltshire, with the clumpof trees atop Woodborough Hill near center of horizon.

So, we have that on three different sources. Also from the Sony digital stillcamera. So, actually four of the cameras were working at that time.THE EYEWITNESSES ARE STILL ON TOP OF KNAP HILL. NOW THEY ARESEEING AND VIDEOTAPING AND RECORDING WITH VIDEO AND CAMERAEQUIPMENT IN INFRARED, STARSCOPE AND ON A STILL FRAME THAT THEREIS SOMETHING IN THE FIELD. WHAT DO THEY DO NEXT?First of all, if you listen to the audio from the recordings, you can hear they are cheeringand yelling because of their excitement, of course. They told me they thought it was sort ofan answer to the discussion they had been having about the existence of other realities andthe nature of consciousness. This intelligence, or whatever is making the crop formations,just wanted to show them, ‘Aha! You might be on the right track.’ That was their feeling.After they had done more recordings, then they were also able to see it with their owneyes. At that time – and now we have come to about 4 AM – then Gary and his girlfrienddecide to go down and have a look at the crop formation. So, they get in their car anddrive around the East Field to the small parking place (silage pit) and they walk into theformation as Win is still videotaping them from the top of Knap Hill. We have the video ofthem coming into the formation and dancing! They were extremely excited to get into thecrop formation when they knew they were the first people on this planet entering thatparticular formation. 4 AM - Gary King and Paula Presdee-JonesTake First Steps into East Field CirclesFirst 4 AM digital phone images inside East Field formation of 150 circlesranging from 160 feet to 2 feet in diameter.

We drovedown the road just after 4 AM and walked into it just as the light was coming up. Walkingthrough the formation, we could see some of the circles were very low to the ground. Thenthe next circle you would walk into, the lay would be like 6 inches above the ground andas you would try to walk on it, it would crunch, like breaking glass.Some of the centers were beautifully laid out in nests. Other centers were actually broken,so there were indications that some of them had very strong energy on them and otherswere put down with very great care and beautifully laid. It was a very contrastingformation in terms of differences in each individual circle.I HAVE BEEN IN FORMATIONS IN THE U. K.

And then the big one as you gotcloser to the center, I would say was about 150 feet across at least, I’m guessing. (Largestwas 160-foot-diameter).

It was the same sound.These stems were not broken. They were just gently bent and people who have been doingcrop circle research over the years, they have found this is how it usually is in genuineformations – that the stems are not broken. They are gently bent so the crop is not dying.It’s growing and if the crop is young, it will kind of straighten up again.I also felt there was a strong radiation from the formation. Gary told me the first morningthat he was in there that pretty soon he had a bad headache. I experienced the samemyself when I was in there four days later. Inside this crop formation, I had been there forhalf an hour when I had a terrible headache. It lasted until I left the formation. When I gotinto the car and drove away, the headache was gone. East Field Is Not FlatSomething Knew How to Make Ovals On the GroundThat Would Look Like Perfect Circles from the AirThe East Field is not a totally flat pancake field. It actually curves up and down. Whenyou look at the formation from up above from an aerial photo, you see that the circles areabsolutely 100% correct circles. To make circles look 100% from the air in a field that hasup and down hills, you cannot create 100% perfect circles on the ground. You have tocreate ovals. And that’s the case here. All the circles that are lying on a hilly surface morethan a flat surface, they are ovals.To construct 100% correct ovals in total darkness – everything you do is extremelydifficult because you can’t see anything. So, to construct not just one, but several ovalsand large ones – the largest one is like 50 meters, or 160 feet. Under those dark conditions,I would consider that impossible and everyone I have spoken to among the researchersdown here and also civil engineers who are used to land surveys – they say that to do thatunder those conditions and also within that limited time frame (90 minutes to 1 hour and45 minutes), they regard that as absolutely impossible for humans to do.”"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Extraordinary Non-Human IntelligenceBehind Crop FormationsWe are thrilled about what has happened and feel the public should know, the worldshould know, that something is going on in these fields that – well, I just can’t describe it. Iget goose bumps all over my body when I’m talking about it, you know?IN YOUR GUT INTUITION, WHAT DO YOU SENSE IS BEHIND THE CROPFORMATIONS?I’m absolutely convinced it is a very intelligent entity, or whatever it is. To me, I have afeeling that what we perceive with our five senses is just a part of the real reality. Our 5senses are constructed to perceive reality in the 3-dimensional reality. I have a strongfeeling that there is life going on within us and around us that we do not perceive.I think there are other intelligences in this universe visiting and monitoring us. And I havea very strong feeling that our governments know a lot more about this than they will tellus. So, I think it is either something projected on the ground from an alien source. Or it isprojected on the ground from an inter-dimensional source that we are not able to perceivewith our senses. But definitely, this source has decided to present itself in a way that is sobeautiful and that is not hostile that creates the most thrilling feelings within us and inviteus to explore the unknown and invite us to start discussions about realities, consciousness... and it is an invitation to start growing as people again because we have for so long beenstuck in our materialistic world view and it’s probably time to take the next step in theevolution of humankind. That’s my opinion.TERJE, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE IDEA THAT CROP FORMATIONSOVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY ARE A KIND OF 3-DIMENSIONALSYMBOL LANGUAGE BASED ON MATH THAT HAVE SOME KIND OF FUNCTIONIN RELATIONSHIP TO THE SURFACE OF THIS EARTH THAT WE DON’TUNDERSTAND?If the circle makers are trying to pass through messages to humankind, why do it in such adifficult way? Why not spell it out in letters in the fields? I think it’s like when you educatechildren. If you tell children to do this, not do that, that’s not real education. Realeducation is when you lead your children to explore things on their own. Then they reallylearn. That’s what I think these formations do. They invite us to start a learning processwhere we have to be the active one. They are helping us on the way, they are giving ussigns, they are giving us wonders to explore – but we have to do the work ourselves. That’show we are going to evolve and grow and learn. Why Are Governments Threatened by Crop Formations?SO, WHY WOULD CROP FORMATIONS AROUND THE WORLD THREATENGOVERNMENTS AND MILITARY?Because it threatens our world view. It threatens our belief systems. To feel secure insociety, you have to feel that you have control. These crop formations tell us that thegovernments do not have control. They are apparently appearing in our fields at night andI guess the military is pretty frustrated – well, I KNOW the military in England is veryfrustrated because their job is to control the airspace of England and something is invadingthis airspace almost every night! I’m not just talking of crop formations, but also of UFOsof which there are many reports here every summer and during the whole year actually.So, I guess the government is very concerned about letting the situation get out of control.You can just imagine what would happen if some government said, ‘OK, we just have toinform you that we are aware of Something fiddling around in our fields every summer.We don’t know what it is, but it is certainly there and much more intelligent than us. So,just watch out.’What kind of situation would that create? What would our churches say? How would theydefine God? It’s like opening an enormous box of possibilities that you can’t control andthat’s why the government does not want the people to be aware of this.WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE TO MAKE GOVERNMENTS AND LEADERS ON THISPLANET FINALLY TALK IN TRUE LANGUAGE AND FACTS WITH THE REST OFTHE CITIZENRY ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE’RE NOT ALONE AND THERE AREPHENOMENA RELATED TO ADVANCED INTELLIGENCES?That’s the major question, Linda. I don’t have a proper answer to that. I’m afraid what it’sgoing to take is a crisis, just like the environmental situation. We have to have a crisis"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"before we start reacting. We are very conservative in the way we conduct our lives. Wedon’t want change, even though we say we are open to change, deep down we don’t wantit. We want to live our safe, predictable lives as we always have done. And thesephenomena are kind of opening a door to Something we cannot control. We do not knowwhat it is. It’s risky. It might be dangerous. I don’t know what it takes, but I would say ittakes some kind of crisis before we really open our eyes and before the government iswilling to establish some type of organized investigation.But I think the destruction of Earth will also affect not only this planet, but will have aneffect outside our planet. That’s why I think the concern is rising and Some Other force, orIntelligence, is trying to give us some hints that we should start opening our eyes now andsee that we are not alone.DO YOU THINK THE CROP CIRCLE MYSTERY IS HEADED TOWARD SOME KINDOF RESOLUTION IN WHICH THE INTELLIGENCE BEHIND THE CROPFORMATIONS OVER ALL THESE YEARS WILL MAKE ITSELF PUBLIC TOHUMANS ON THIS PLANET?I have a feeling it is. I have a feeling you can see that very clearly from the way it isaccelerating. The phenomenon is growing. It’s definitely taking us somewhere. We areheaded toward crisis in the energy systems on this Earth. We are headed towardenvironmental crisis. I mean, for just talking about energy – in like 40 years, we will runout of gas. And we will run out of the energy that drives 80% of all our systems on theEarth. So, in 50 Earth years, we will have some pretty big troubles on our hands. If wedon’t wake up and do something about that pretty soon, then this planet is going down, thiscivilization is on its way down.I think this crop circle thing is a wake up call and the reason it’s accelerating is becausethis crisis we are onto is also accelerating pretty fast. So, it’s a wake up call and a sign thatwe are full speed towards a crisis.”To be continued in Part 2: Unmarked Black Helicopters Over East FieldBlack, unmarked Apache helicopter hovered above cameramanWinston Keech in the East Field formation on July 10, 2007.Dark object to right of helicopter is unidentified.Video image © 2007 by Winston Keech.More Information:Click here for order information"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"about Terje Toftenes's 3-set DVD, Crop Circles -Crossover From Another Dimension,English version © 2006. 240 minutes. $39.95.
