Sketch by eyewitness. Click for Earthfiles PodcastFebruary 15, 2007 New Orleans , Louisiana - In January, I put out an appeal at mynews website, Earthfiles.com, and in radio broadcasts for viewers and listeners who havehad firsthand interactions with non-human creatures to contact me at my email address: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.I have received hundreds of responses from people all over North America and other partsof the world, indicating yet again how widespread and numerous are the experiencesbetween humans and what appears to be non-human biological entities.One of the emails caught my attention because the date of the man’s most recentinteraction was the second week of January 2007. What he saw was a seemingly solid,biological, grey entity wearing a monk’s robe-type garment floating above ground abouttwenty feet away. Others in the human abduction syndrome over the years have alsodescribed seeing grey entities floating or moving in the air above ground. But this time, thelocation is a major defense contractor that builds armored vehicles for militaryapplications, and the eyewitness is a 27-year-old machinist who helps build those militaryvehicles.Further, the machinist had specifically asked to work on the all night shift in order to getaway from grey entities that have intruded into his Louisiana bedroom and have given himnight terrors. His wife has tried to cope with his frequent night traumas and was relievedwhen he decided to work evening shifts.That’s why the machinist is haunted by the January 2007 event. He thinks it is a clearmessage from the grey entities who have been in his life since he was three years old"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"growing up in New Orleans. That message is: the grey non-humans will be in his life aslong as the greys want to, whether the machinist is home in bed at night or working for adefense contractor who has strict post 9/11 security.Here now is the machinist’s description of one of his most memorable abductionexperiences and what happened in the second week of January 2007.Interview: “Charles Jones,” Machinist, Defense Contractor, New Orleans, Louisiana: “When Iwas young, 3 to 4-years-old, my mother remembers me talking about people coming tovisit me at night. She passed it off as a child who had issues or was seeing imaginarythings or whatever.It really started out a few years later, we were grocery shopping and we were at thecheckout lines and there was a book. The book was Whitley Strieber’s Communion. I gotreal frantic while we were in line. I literally caused a scene in the store and that’s why mymother knew what the problem was. My mother and my grandfather - he is deceased now- both experienced this from their early years. So she knew what I was going through andshe ended up purchasing the Communion book. It peaked my curiosity about what I wasgoing through, but I was still feeling a lot of fear after that.Most of the abduction cases that I can recall – I don’t know what their agenda is. I don’tknow what happens to me after a certain point. I usually get a buzzing in my left ear. Itsounds like a real faint forklift beeping. Usually when you put a forklift in reverse, you geta strange beep.COULD YOU TRY TO MIMIC THAT RIGHT NOW?Just a slight beep, beep, beep. And it’s in my left ear, I hear this. I’m a heavy sleeper. Mywife can tell you – I can sleep through a hurricane. So, if I wake up in the middle of thenight, usually something’s catching me or I’m seeing something. If I wake up, usually I seea being or silhouette and that’s all I’ll remember.This went on all through my teenage years. I had lived in St. Bernard’s Parish all my life.Then after my wife and I purchased our house after we got married, we moved to a littlesuburb called Marrero. I just had knee surgery. I wound up blowing my knee out, tore myACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament). So, I was not able to walk and had to sleep on the sofabecause I needed somewhere to stabilize my leg while I slept. This is an abduction casethat I do recall because it involved me and my mother.What happened was I woke up and I heard the beeping. And I had a being sort of leaningover the back of the sofa looking dead at me and then I passed out. The next thing I’mremembering was there was more than just me. There must have been eight or ten people.It was almost like walking in a desert – like endless sand. As crazy as it sounds, it wasendless sand and my mother was there.I look back at that now and find it odd because I could not walk. I just got out of surgery.And I remember seeing these beings there, about four beings. They were about 4-feet-tall,the typical greys you see on television. Large, black eyes, real pale skin. That was the onlything I remembered.But the reason I knew this happened was when I woke up, I had sand on my feet. And Ihad sand on the sofa. My mother did not recall what was happening, but she woke up withsand on her feet also and sand in her bed. She lived seven miles away from me. I called herup that morning panicked about it. I was like, ‘Mom, did you see that last night?’She said, ‘See what?’So I told her the story and she said, ‘That’s odd. I woke up with sand in my bed.’That’s my only abduction case that I actually somewhat remember anything. Everythingelse, even to this day, when I hear something in the middle of the night, I’ll wake up andsee something and then I pass out. I don’t know if it’s because of fear or something theydo, but I pass out.OK, LET’S GO TO THAT SOUND YOU ASSOCIATE SINCE BEING A CHILD WITHTHE GREY ENTITIES COMING AND TAKING YOU AND PLEASE DESCRIBE THESOUND?It’s just a real faint beep in the left ear. Beep, beep, beep, and it stays constant. That’susually the sound that I know, I hear before something happens. Usually panic sets in rightafter that and hair stands up on the back of my neck. I just freak out. I know something is"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"about to happen.YOU DON’T HEAR THAT BEEPING SOUND ANY OTHER TYPE EXCEPT INASSOCIATION WITH THE GREYS COMING AND TAKING YOU SOMEWHERE?That’s the only time I hear it. It’s weird because it’s not like it’s going directly into my ear,like somebody talking in your ear. It seems like it’s just in there.INSIDE OF YOUR HEAD?Right. January 2007 - Grey, Non-Human EntityFloats In Air At Defense Contractor SiteWITH THAT AS BACKGROUND, COULD YOU PLEASE COME UP TO THIS EVENTTHAT OCCURRED WHEN YOU WERE AT WORK THE SECOND WEEK OFJANUARY 2007, AND DESCRIBE IN AS MUCH DETAIL THAT YOU REMEMBER?At the place where I’m employed, we’re not allowed to smoke inside the buildings. So,you go outside to have a cigarette and usually come back inside and finish your work. Itwas about 9:30 p.m. at night. I said, ‘I’m going to step outside and have a cigarette.’ Acouple of minutes after I got out there, I started to get that beeping sensation in my earagain. The first thing I’m thinking is that we have forklifts around here and I’m probablyhearing a forklift and I pushed it off.Right after that, I had this overwhelming fear come over me and I’m looking around. Ilooked up and I saw a grey being hovering about 20 feet in the air.\"Charles Jones\" on cigarette break at defense contractor site in second weekof January 2007, when a blue-grey-skinned non-human entity appeared in the air abouttwenty feet above ground. Sketch for Earthfiles by eyewitness.And it’s a being. It’s a grey. It’s wearing this cloak. It’s almost like a long trench coat. Idon’t see its body, but I can see its head. The rest of it is just this cloak floating up in theair. I start to panic now because I don’t know what to do. I’m freaking out because I’venever seen – not in the facility like I work in. These people (defense contractor) areprepared for a terrorist attack. We have armed guards that patrol the facility. The onlyreason I work the night shift I work is because I’m scared to sleep at night because ofthese grey things.What happens is that I get this feeling like it’s not really talking to me, but I feel like Ican’t run away from these things. It’s the first thing that comes over me: I can’t run. Ican’t hide. Just as soon as that happened (communication), it floated up and disappeared.HOW HIGH IS THIS BEING ABOVE YOU?Roughly 20 to 25 feet.ABOUT HOW BIG?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"About 4 to 4.5 feet tall.THE GARMENT IT’S WEARING, YOU SAID A LONG TRENCH COAT, BUTEARLIER YOU SAID A HOODED CLOAK?Yes, it hung sort of like a trench coat. I have a trench coat, so that’s why I’m using it as anexample. But it seemed like a cloak, like a monk's robe.WHAT ABOUT THE ROBE COLOR?It looked black.THE BLACK COMPARED TO THIS GREY ENTITY’S SKIN – HOW WOULD YOUCOMPARE THE GREY ENTITY’S SKIN TO A COLOR I MIGHT KNOW?It would be like a bluish-grey, like a real pale - looks like something that just has nopigment at all.YET, HAS A BLUE CAST TO IT?Right.GO TO THE FACE YOU CAN SEE IN THE MONK’S ROBE CLOAK AND DESCRIBEAS MUCH AS YOU CAN REMEMBER OF THE FACE?Its head was clearly bigger than the rest of it. The head is just huge. It has large, black eyes– almond-shaped eyes, kind of slanted. I didn’t see a nose on it. It had a slit for a mouth;just typical of the things I’ve been seeing my whole life. Just a real large head with largeblack eyes, larger than a human’s eyes.IT’S ABOVE YOU FLOATING IN THE AIR. CAN YOU SEE THROUGH IT LIKE ITWAS A HOLOGRAM?No, it’s solid, very solid.SO, AS FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED, THIS WAS A SOLID, ORGANIC BEING?Ye s .BUT IT JUST HAPPENS TO BE ABLE TO FLOAT!(laughs) I can’t understand that, either, Linda. I really don’t. That’s what freaked me out. Grey Communication:\"We can find you whenever we want to.\"LET’S GO TO THE POSSIBLE TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION. YOU’D BEENSMOKING A CIGARETTE AND BECAME AWARE OF THE GREY BEING THATHAS HAUNTED YOU YOUR WHOLE LIFE TWENTY FEET ABOVE YOU,FLOATING IN THE AIR. AND THEN, WHAT HAPPENED INSIDE OF YOUR HEADTO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY TO DESCRIBE?The only thing I feel is that I just cannot run away. That seems to be put in me. Like Ican’t hide from it. It was not like a voice or anything like that. It’s just the one thing thatkeeps going on in my head: I can’t hide from these things.THIS IS PART OF THE ALMOST-LESSON. YOU HAVE BEEN GOING ON A NIGHTSHIFT IN ORDER TO ESCAPE ABDUCTIONS AT NIGHT. THEN YOU’RE AT WORKAT NIGHT HAVING A CIGARETTE BREAK AND ONE OF THE GREYS APPEARSABOVE YOU AS IF TO SAY: ‘IT DOESN’T MATTER WHEN YOU WORK. ITDOESN’T MATTER WHEN YOU SLEEP. WE CAN FIND YOU WHENEVER WEWANT TO.’Right. And I haven’t slept well since, to be honest with you.IN YOUR 27 YEARS WITH MEMORIES GOING BACK TO AGE 3 OR 4, IF YOUWERE GOING TO SUM UP ANY KIND OF RESIDUE FEELING ABOUT WHATTHEY WANT, WHY THEY ARE HERE, WHY THEY ARE IN YOUR LIFE, WHATWOULD THAT BE?To be honest with you, I really don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know what their agendais. I don’t know why they visit me or why they visited my mother or even my grandfather."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"I really don’t know. I don’t have an answer for that.WHAT IS YOUR BLOODLINE? WHERE WERE YOUR MOTHER AND FATHERBORN AND RAISED?The Canary Islands.THE CANARY ISLANDS OFF THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA.Correct.[ Editor’s Note: St. Bernard Parish comprises an area of 680 square miles, andembraces numerous small islands. The most populated portion of the parish, inthe areas near the Mississippi River, is part of the New Orleans metropolitanarea. It contains a small community of Spanish descent. Sometimes referredto, informally, as \"Spanish Cajuns\", the Islenos are descended from CanaryIslanders who arrived around 1780. This linguistically isolated groupeventually developed their own dialect.]YOUR GRANDFATHER, GRANDMOTHER, DID THEY HAVE STORIES?My grandfather was a man of few words. One of the stories I’ve always heard from thearea they lived in, in the eastern most parts of St. Bernard’s Parish (Louisiana). They usedto have stories of people talking about a red fireball, which would chase the fishermen.I’ve heard the stories since I was young, from my grandfather.The only thing I’ve ever heard from my mother was that my grandfather ran one night andsaid he was being chased by a fireball. He passed out. A few hours later, he made it home.That’s the only story I’ve heard about my grandfather. My mother had similar situationsdown in that area. Even in our house growing up, she’s pretty much seen the same thingsI’ve seen.WHAT IS YOUR MOTHER’S SORT OF SUMMARY REACTION ABOUT THE GREYBEINGS?She’s not scared of them at all. She has openly talked to me about it ever since the incidentwhen I was young in the store, when I saw the cover of the Communion book. She’sopenly talked to me about it. She hasn’t gone out of her way to investigate. But she hasopenly spoken to me about it, whereas my wife knows what goes on, but she’s veryuncomfortable speaking about it.My father, he really doesn’t say much about it. My sister neither. It’s always beencontained by my mother or me.IN YOUR WORK, IT INVOLVES DEFENSE CONTRACTS. HAVE YOU EVER BEENDEBRIEFED OR WARNED ABOUT ANYTHING OF A UFO NATURE?No, not at all.”More Information:For further information about the UFO phenomenon, please see reports below: inEarthfiles Archives and in my books and documentaries listed in the Earthfiles Shop:• 02/07/2007 -- Part 11: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 01/30/2007 -- Part 10: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 01/16/2007 -- Part 9: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 01/02/2007 -- Grey Aerial Disk Reported by Chicago O'Hare United Airlines Pilots and Mechanics• 12/27/2006 -- Part 7: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 12/18/2006 -- Part 6: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 12/14/2006 -- Abductee Jim Sparks's Encounter with Reptillian Beings, Their Warning and Possible Agenda• 12/11/2006 -- Part 5: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 12/06/2006 -- Part 4: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 11/28/2006 -- Part 2: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 11/27/2006 -- Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue © 1957 by Leonard H.
