The following are afew of those viewer and listener letters.1) Subject: May 28,1974 Disc ReportsDate: December 1, 2007 8:51:08 PM MSTTo: earthfiles@earthfiles.comHello Linda,I was the NICAP field investigator that filed the report on the May 28, 1974,sighting outside of Albuquerque, NM. There were a lot of other witnesses thatnight who saw the glowing object pass over the city and head towards theSandia Mountains. But only a few witnesses noticed that after the brilliantlight of the disc went out, (around 2 AM May 29, 1974) a bluish object of farless intensity left there and traveled to the Coyote Canyon test area, where itdisappeared below ground level. A friend of mine in the Air Force said thatthis was affectionately called 'Big Blue' by the people at the Coyote Canyontest facility. It was a ship prepared by reverse engineering alien technology.I studied the UFO-related events of New Mexico for over 20 years. I was botha NICAP and APRO investigator.

UFO?Date: November 30, 2007 10:32:22 PM MSTTo: earthfiles@earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Las Vegas Optic Las Vegas, New Mexico,Tuesday, May 28, 1974, Page 1, Column 6.Don't know if this article is related to theMay 28, 1974, UFO incident near Albuquerque,NM, but, there was a 150-acre fire in the Las Cruces, NMarea on May 27-28, 1974. The NM State Police said theyreceived reports of a ball of fire being sighted in thearea before the blaze began. Some reports said thatthe fire had been caused by a plane crash.These are common remarks that sometimes describe aUFO sighting. I thought it might be important so I am sending thisto you.I heard your report on the Coast to Coast radio program lastnight. Keep up the great work. 3) Subject: Silver DiscDate: November 30, 2007 9:02:31 AM MSTTo: earthfiles@earthfiles.comI was listening to Coast to Coast last night and when you started talking aboutsilver disc around Albuquerque, it got my attention. We lived there in theearly 1970s and one evening while Southeast of town, I saw a silver disc risefrom Sandia Laboratories, hover a few seconds and go out of sight. Imentioned it to the folks I was with and one said might as well blow it offbecause you will never get any knowledge of what it is. Just to let you knowthat others have seen the silver discs. 4) Subject: Unknown Object in 1974Date: November 30, 2007 12:30:31 AM MSTTo: earthfiles@earthfiles.comLinda, my name is ---- and in 1974 I was 10 yrs. old. I lived in Denver,Colorado. As a child, my friend and I would ride our bikes up Jewel Blvd.from near the corner of Federal Blvd. (we lived on Bails Ave) and I went toJohnson Elem. To try to give you an idea of my location then, during theevening my buddy and I would ride our bikes up Jewel to Green Mountain. Atthat time, Jewel Blvd. ended at Green Mountain and there was a metal \"rope\"strapped across the road. As we went around this \"road block,\" we would go"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"up a dirt path and climb a hill to our right. At the top of the hill was what I, atthat time, called a lake, but today I think it is a reservoir. It was here that wewould fish until dark and then ride our bikes back home.My birthday is on May 21st, so around this time we would \"celebrate\" andtake the ride every night to fish or just sit and look at the lights over Denver. Itwas during one of these nights that we observed \"lights\" in the sky that weremoving from our right that would be south to our left and then up to us, kindagoing in a triangle. There were more than one and the closer they got to us thedifferent they looked. As one approached it had colored lights going around itand did not look like an oval, but more like straight lines that were rotating.We sat and watched these objects zoom around the outside of the city forsome time until as one approached the area where we were, we heard a sirensort of like an air-raid go off down in the city, then we observed police lightscoming up Jewel in the direction where we were.As we watched the lights on the ground and in the sky, one object flewsilently right above us over the water. At this point there was no sound fromanything on the ground and my friend Mike and I looked at each other andfound it weird that all of the sounds had stopped. As we looked up at thisobject above us, a light came out of it into the water like a beam. The lightwas brighter than in the daytime. We froze. It just sat there for what seemedlike forever, but most likely was only seconds. Then as we heard noise frombehind us, the light went off and the object was gone. The noise from behindus was a police officer climbing up the small hill to where we were sitting.Surprised that we were there, he asked us what we had seen. So we told him.He held us by the shoulders and, after asking where we lived, told us sternlyto forget what we saw and go home.What we saw were objects that were moving from place to place at a veryhigh rate of speed. From a distance, some looked like bright lights. As they gotcloser to us and slowed and hovered, they looked like a giant merry-go-roundin the sky. At one point, the closer one changed shape as its colorful lightsrotated until it was right above us. I don't remember anything other than thelights flying around the city and then the bright light above us.As the officer approached, it kinda scared us like we were in a trance. Itconfused me for many years. Then in 1981, I had a similar experience. Thistime while driving home with a friend to his house to drop him off as he had tobe home at 9:30 PM, we left the pizza place to drive home and went throughtown at 9 PM. We stopped at a stop sign and then suddenly \"woke up.\" Thecar was stalled and we had fallen asleep while sitting at the stop sign.I looked at my friend and he was just waking up. We laughed it off as wethought we might have drank, or been given drugs. But we had not, so Idropped him off and I went home. I went inside and laid down to go asleep asI had to be at school in the A.M. It seemed like only minutes went by and mymom woke me and told me to head out to school. Then she said in a \"tone\"that we will talk later tonight. So I left. As I arrived at school, my friend Joewas eating breakfast and said he was grounded. I asked why? since I droppedhim off way before 9:30 PM and we were only 10 minutes from his house. Hesaid that his mom told him he got in at 4:30 AM!WHAT? 4:30 A.M.!! That was impossible. So I went through the day knowingthat MY mom wanted to speak with me about something, as I was using hercar. When we talked, she asked me why I had stayed out until near 5 A.M.and what was I doing? Knowing (the night before) I had to get up early to goto school, I was heavily confused. Joe and I decided that our mothers did notknow what they were talking about and we made the decision not to discuss itanymore because we could not explain it. That was until just recently when Isaw him on classmates.com and wrote him. That was the first and last time wespoke of the incident since high school. 5) Subject: Comment following your Thursday COAST re: family not speaking of eventDate: November 29, 2007 11:53:27 PM MSTTo: earthfiles@earthfiles.comThe comments of the people when you asked if they discussed their ordealwith anyone, they mentioned outside of family members, no they didn't andthey didn't know \"why\" they did not."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I have always been interested in UFOs and one summer night my kids, 10 &12, came in from playing in the park across the street and very matter offactly said, \"There's a flying saucer in the park.\" Then walked to the table fordinner and calmly just sat down. I said to them, \"Oh, is that right?\" and beganserving dinner.It has bothered me ever since, why I didn't run out and see, but thinking back,it seems our actions were almost as an automaton. It is not the reaction Ishould have had and I'm wondering if some kind of mind control on my kidsand me could have been the result of the UFO? We were acting like theStepford Wives or something. 6) Subject: CtoC broadcast 11/29 - UFO SightingsDate: November 29, 2007 11:53:16 PM MSTTo: earthfiles@earthfiles.comI am just catching the tail end of your segment with George Noory, andalthough the dates don't match, the UFO event that happened to me, my momand 7-year old was in November of 1972 - on national election night. Insteadof getting a motel and driving the next day, we had decided to drive to myparents' home in Escondido, CA (we'd been on a trip to Iowa to visit mymom's parents). Therefore, we stopped in Demming, NM, for coffee and alight meal to fortify us, as it was a trip that would take most of the night.In those days, the traffic at 10 - 3 a.m. was sparse. My mom was driving andmy son was lying down in the backseat. I noticed what looked like asmokestack out of the passenger window with a 'flame' on the top of it. Wespeculated as to what it was in the middle of the desert and couldn't imagine.As we drove (65-70MPH), we traveled for about 20 minutes and I keptwondering why we had never passed whatever it was. But it was actuallykeeping up with the pace of our car.About the time I mentioned this to my mom, the light swelled up into a hugefireball and then split into at least a dozen separate lights that hovered in thenight sky among the stars in front of our windshield. We were terrified as wehad no idea what was happening. The lights would form various shapes andchange color and maneuver effortlessly, disappear and reappear, almost as ifthey were playing. My mom was getting too upset to drive, so we stopped(which unnerved us both) and I started to drive. I said we should turn on theradio, but couldn't get any static or anything - just some local stations. Westarted to climb into the mountains and there was fog or clouds that obscuredthe sky. When we descended on the other side of the mountain out of the fog,the lights were still there, but there were fewer of them and they followed usinto El Centro - where they disappeared in one simultaneous event - just liketurning off a switch. When we got to Miramar AFB, there were a series of jetstaking off toward the East and when we got to my parents' home, wewondered whether we should call the police. But we decided against itbecause of my dad's job, etc. It was not an \"acceptable\" topic to drawattention to oneself in those days. 7) Subject: IT GLOWED LIKE A LIGHT BULBDate: November 30, 2007 3:23:07 AM MSTTo: earthfiles@earthfiles.comJust like ours that we seen. It was white and glowed from the inside like a 70watt bulb would glow. The surface of the craft glistened like it was wet, sortof just a glowing, glistening, white cube or box shape that very slowly spun. Itflew sort of like a piece of paper caught in the updraft, just kind of floatingand then suddenly would jerk around and around and then just float againaround the radio tower.After it left the radio tower, it flew straight and level as it crossed the field.When it hovered, it was very steady and doing a very slow spin. The cubespun into a ball and shot away. I think they come out of cylinder-shapedcraft?Also, we were questioned when we were little kids near our home in thewheat field about crop circles, not UFOs. But we made these crop circlesourselves and we had no idea even what a crop circle was. A couple of yearslater, I was asked about UFOs. And that was strange because ... I was then"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"sent for an IQ test and a doctor for tests. Those UFOs were interested backthen in the 1960s and 1970s in TV and radio towers. Their interests havechanged to things like power plants and power lines to modes oftransportation. They are studying us, no question about it. 8) Subject: COAST TO COAST STORY - UFO IN ABQDate: November 30, 2007 3:27:36 AM MSTTo: earthfiles@earthfiles.comDUDE!!! I am TOTALLY FREAKED by the story about the encounter inAlbuquerque!!I used to live in ABQ and saw a saucer over the Sandias near Central andTramway. I was at the store up there. My daughter was shopping inside and Iwas laying on the lawn with a rescue dog that I was fostering. OMG, I saw adisc just zig zagging across the sky. And THEN it stopped. ALL OF ASUDDEN, a WHOLE bunch of clouds started forming around the disc, as if toobscure it. A HORRIBLE rainstorm hit about an hour after these weird cloudsformed!! It was all around Kirtland AFB. I FIRMLY believe that it wasGOVERNMENT craft!! I saw the disc very very well before the clouds beganforming.I also witnessed a UFO for 3 hrs on the west side of ABQ in 1994!! Me andabout 6 other people sat and watched this UFO formation over the WESTMESA!!! I actually believe that it's GOVERNMENT!! WHY??? Because ofthe way the formation was acting - almost as if it was a drill - or that theywere testing a new craft. 9) Subject: Carbondale, PA 1973 UFO CrashDate: November 30, 2007 9:32:58 AM MSTTo: earthfiles@earthfiles.comI heard Linda on the Coast to Coast show talking about the 1974 crash inNew Mexico and it brought back memories of an experience I had back in1974. I heard a radio broadcast that a UFO had crashed in a body of water inCarbondale, Pennsylvania. At the time, I lived in South New Jersey. Afterhearing this report, I called a buddy of mine and asked him to go with me tocheck it out. We arrived in Carbondale about 2 1/2 hours later and by the timewe got there the Army had every road to the lake \"road blocked\" and guardedby soldiers with M-16 rifles. No one could get within 10 miles of that lake. Itwas very scary and the soldiers were on high alert and agitated and veryforceful in sending us on our way. One thing that was very strange is that wenever heard another word from the media about this after the one and onlyradio broadcast. There was a total information blackout on this event.[ Editor's Note: On November 9, 1974, in Carbondale,Pennsylvania, a glowing object fell into a small lake outside town.Three teenagers saw it fall at 7:30 p.m. on a Saturday. Theyobserved a yellow-white glow under the water that shifted to apoint 25 feet offshore. The boys were kept in a police car forthree hours while a number of vehicles with floodlights andcranes removed a disc-shaped object and put it into a van.The government cover-up of the event was created the nextMonday when a railroad lantern and battery were pulled from thelake and officials called the whole thing a hoax - allegedly doneunder some government authority's orders. In fact a 1974Pennsylvania resident wrote the following on August 17, 2003, toufologie.net:\"I was living in the Pocono Mountains in November of 1974. Iread the original story in the Pocono Record, published inStroudsburg, Pa. My parents saw the object that evening. Thatsighting was near the town of Hawley, Pa, on LakeWallenpaupack. I can assure you, that it was no hoax. There havebeen other sightings of U.F.O.s around that area over the years.While I was living there, I had several unusual things happen tome. I met two fellows from Carbondale, back then... that told methey were chased away from the crash site the evening of theevent.\"]"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 10) Subject: My Personal 1974 UFO AbductionDate: November 30, 2007 8:18:27 PM MSTTo: earthfiles@earthfiles.comI have been wanting to report this to you for years. In 1974, I was 18 years oldand had graduated from HS the prior June. I will get right to the incident itselfand then give some of my later thoughts of the people and things going onaround me at that time.In late October 1974, I was in deep sleep when I suddenly found myself to beapparently floating above my house. It took me some time to \"wake-up\" andrealize what was going on. Looking up, I saw a classic polished silver flyingsaucer (two plates together). I floated up to it and was taken inside this craftdragged/floated past a man in his early / late fifties in what looked like a U.S.Air Force uniform (I think I could identify his face if I ever saw him again) onboard.There were other apparent American soldiers and I noted that the USAFOfficer appeared to be very angry about something, as he was yelling, I don'tremember the words, but I do remember his emotion. (Later I thought thatpossibly he was mad because I was awake - I may have said something tohim). Well, this didn't stop the process that was intended to be done to me. Iwas again dragged/floated (I don’t know which, but I don’t rememberwalking) into the center of this ship into a large open space via a roundcorridor along the edges of the room. There was a tiny rail separating theoutside walking area from the center where I was taken. The middle had atable (I guess) because I was laid on something and was surrounded by agroup of doctors in surgical masks and an operation was immediately begun.Some kind of device or machine was engaged to my head and I began freakingout (quietly) upon realizing that the operation was to my head, and into mybrain! I remember that I had a very clear perception of my mind being openedup and laid out and some things were done. I do not know what - if somethingwas put in or taken out.Anyway, this surgery was terrifying to me and I seemed to go outside mybody and waited whimpering in the corner. I have no recollection of muchafter that, but I do know that this incident took some time, possibly a fewhours.The next thing I remember is waking up the next morning, knowing what hadhappened, but being unable to make any sense of it. The procedure scared andoverwhelmed me utterly. It did not feel anything like a dream. It had a certaincontinuity of time and event and deep sense of SOMEONE ELSE DOINGTHIS TO ME AND NOT BEING MY OWN THOUGHTS, as in the case ofdreaming. Needless to say I was freaked out.There were no alien creatures - just what I saw were apparently humanbeings! I didn't have any anticipation of anything. I just watched it happen. Noone spoke to me. It was as if I was a piece of meat and they simply had a jobto do and did it.After this happened, I knew I could not talk about it and I had no intention ofspeaking of this to anyone and for the next 25 years or so, I tried to put it offas just a dream. I searched for books on the subject and back then this subjectwas totally none existent.Then in about 1994 I read Whitley Strieber's Communion. There was one linein there that pushed me over the edge to believing that maybe it was real. Thatline was: \"...and they implanted something in my brain!\"Also, the popular culture began to speak openly of this idea of UFO abductionand I saw an episode of the Simpsons (TV animated program) )when they arebeamed up into a flying saucer. Seeing that made me feel better and graduallyI have become able to speak of what happened to me, to share with others andwill tell anyone who is interested.SOME LATER THOUGHTS OF NOTE:My older sister and brother both were enlisted in the U. S. Air Force and ourfamily car had a bumper sticker saying \"We are an Air Force Family\" Did this"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"make me fair game?My brother had been stationed at Wright Patterson AFB in Ohio and I hadspent the prior summer out there visiting with him. No clear connection of hisduties to secret stuff. He was appointed to the psych hospital as anaide/orderly and during our off hours, we played softball and smokedcigarettes.Starting that summer after my return, I took a job with an electronics firm nearmy home. That was where I was working when this incident happened to meand I began to immediately suspect that it and some of its personnel werestrangely linked to my abduction. This firm acted as middle man for electronicparts between manufacturers of all the big electronic firms such as Motorola,Fairchild, IBM, Hewlett Packard, and many many other buyers who orderedtiny electronic parts. (the parts were integrated circuits and diodes - small,black and have metal legs so that they look like bugs.) My job was to pack theorders and ship them to the buyer. Most of the companies were in California. Isuspected that there was some connection between some of the \"salesmen\"and women that worked there and my UFO abduction.I wanted you to know about this - the important thing is that these occupantswere American military, there was brain surgery performed. I was a wreak atthe time and it seemed that there was more then one abduction, but that one inparticular seemed to be the most intense and first memorable. 11) Subject: A 1974 Radio News Announcement!?Date: November 30, 2007 1:06:29 AM MSTTo: earthfiles@earthfiles.comOn a late afternoon, Saturday, October 26, 1974, while listening to a car radioin Buffalo, NY, I was startled to hear the hourly news announcer saysomething like this: \"The Ford Administration is expected to make anannouncement in the next few weeks acknowledging the existence of UFOs.\"It might have been then-powerhouse WKBW-AM.At that time I was a college student on the school's cross-country team. Wewere sitting in the team car after a meet, waiting for the coach to appear todrive us back to school. We were only half-paying attention to the car radio,but it seemed we ALL took instant notice of that news item. Startled, we alllooked at each other in disbelief - \"Did YOU hear THAT? Wow!\" They did. SoI knew I didn't imagine it. (A few of my old teammates still remember ittoday.)We speculated the government felt now (1974) would be a good time to do it,since Americans had by now become accustomed to movies, TV shows andother entertainment about UFOs, and that a government announcement wouldonly confirm what many of us have come to accept: UFOs. Aliens. No bigdeal. After all, it's been almost 30 years since H.G. Well's radio play The WarOf The Worlds shocked the public. Nobody would be shocked today in 1974.(One of us wondered, however, if the 'news' item was actually only a littlejoke - with Halloween being less than a week away?)We didn't hear that news item again on the next hourly news cycle, although itis likely we were back at school by the next cycle. That night, I watched thelocal Buffalo TV news stations and next morning looked at the major SundayBuffalo newspaper, looking for more on this story - but there was nothing. Notone hint.None of my teammates saw or heard anything else about it either, other thanwhat we heard over the car radio just that one time. Nevertheless, we allwaited for THE announcement - that never came...\" I am hoping that others will contact me who were also in Albuquerque, New Mexico, onMay 28, 1974, at the Sandia hills on the eastern edge of the city beyond Menaul andTramway Boulevards, watching the glowing disc surrounded by military - or were one ofthe military security police. If so, please email me: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.
