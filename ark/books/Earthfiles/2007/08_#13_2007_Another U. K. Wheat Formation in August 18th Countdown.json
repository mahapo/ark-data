Pattern is equivalent to the Mayan number \"6.\" Reportedsix days before August 18, 2007. Aerial image © 2007 by Philippe Ullens.Also see: Cropcircleconnector.com.August 13, 2007 Stanton St. Bernard, Wiltshire, England - In my July 23, 2007,Earthfiles report entitled, \"070707 East Field Wheat Formation: Viewer Comments,\" thereis a section written by an Australian scientist who requests anonymity. The Earthfilesreport shares his \"Lunar Cycle Count Down to August 18, 2007\" analysis of the 150 circlesin the East Field that were discovered shortly after a bright flash of light around 3 AM onJuly 7, 2007. See: 072307 Earthfiles.On August 6, he emailed about the 9-fold wheat geometry reported August 4, 2007, belowthe Pewsey White Horse, Pewsey, Wiltshire, England. See: 080707 Earthfiles. August 12, 2007 Mayan Symbol for Number 6Mayan symbols for numbers 1 through 20, beginning on top leftwith 1 to 5 (bar). The number 6 is the dot and bar at far left on second line.Today, the Australian scientist emailed:\"Stanton St. Bernard of August 12: six days left until a significant, if unknown,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"event on August 18, 2007.\"A new crop picture from Stanton St. Bernard shows the ancient Mayansymbol for number '6,' as a long bar drawn just below a filled circle (manythanks to Michelle Jennings and Heather Horning for their quick and astuteobservations).\"Furthermore, on close inspection, one can see that its 'filled circle' contains 12small and 1 central swirl for a total of 13 mini-swirls:\"Taken together, both observations lead one to believe that those crop artistsare trying to tell us about '6 days' from their ancient 13-month calendar (basedon motions of Venus and the Sun), where any month contained 20 days, andany year contained 13 x 20 = 260 days.\"The 'long bar' in that same crop picture is skewed with respect to a nearbytramline by approximately 10 degrees. Such a small, but precise angle might beintended to represent the small angular fraction of '6 days' within any complete260-day Mayan year as (6 / 260) x 360 = 8.3 degrees. But I cannot be surefrom current photographs: Would someone like to measure in the field?\"Why would they show us the ancient Mayan symbol for '6 days' right now, onthe particular date of August 12, 2007?\"In the context of other pictures from 2007, this new message seems torepresent the continuation of some countdown until a significant, if unknown,event on August 18. That same date was implied symbolically at East Field onJuly 7, in terms of 'lunar cycles;' at Sugar Hill on July 31 in terms of 'cubesundials;' and at Pewsey on August 4 in terms of a 'solar-lunar calendar.'\"The Sun and Venus are moving towards an inferior conjunction on August 18,thereby ending their current 260-day Sun-Venus calendar, and beginninganother. So they could be trying to tell us about that, or maybe something elseentirely?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"\"In the context of other pictures from 2004 or 2005, this new message seemsto represent the continuation of Mayan Sunstone messages from Silbury 2004and Wayland's Smithy 2005.
