Out of print.Return to Part 1November 21, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - * * * * *Chapter 3The Paranormal ApproachThe use of psychics to unlock some of the secrets was tried. The expectationwas that they would be less intimidated working in areas that are too strangefor other scientists to work in. From the start, some of the psychics could nothandle what they were shown and simply \"freaked out,\" as one scientist put it.There were a few who overcame their initial shock and actuallycommunicated with the Alien objects. But shortly after that, those fewdeveloped psychosis.There are many layers of technicians who work on this highly classifiedproject. Some know the truth and the origin of what they are working on."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Others are kept in the dark and believe that they are working on highlyadvanced scientific projects for the military. Of the thirty individual groupswho participate in this program, none communicate with each other. They arekept isolated for security reasons. All the groups report their findings andresults to a single committee.Each group consists of two or three specialists chosen from fields ofphysicists, medical doctors, metallurgists, psychiatrists, mathematicians,astronomers and parapsychologists. The committee to which these specialistsreport is comprised of seven individuals. Some are from the military. The restare civilians personally recruited by the President of the United States.After reviewing many of the first reports given to them by the scientists, thecommittee as a whole was certain only about one thing: that whoever theAliens are, they allowed the human race to keep the Alien craft. Committeemembers were well aware that the Aliens had the capacity to take their ship atany time. They knew the Aliens could do this after they learned howindependent all the items on the ship are. The ship itself was capable ofoperating independently without the assistance of the Alien crew.It was apparent to the committee that after the craft fixed itself that it couldhave left on its own. What puzzled them was why they were allowed to havethe Alien craft in the first place. The mission of the committee was to find aweakness in the Alien ship. But the more they probed, the more they realizedhow weak humans are in comparison to the Aliens. That is why everyPresident, starting with Harry Truman (and possibly even FDR), was unable toconfirm the existence of UFOs, but instead was forced to deny their existence.No President was going to come out and tell the world that there are Aliensout there who could \"squash\" the human race as if we were nothing more thana gnat!Two of the psychics who were brought into the program excelled at breakingthrough the complexities of how some objects worked. The devices they hadthe most success with were those that operate with thought waves. They madea kind of \"ESP\" connection with some specific gadgets. One of the deviceswas a huge breakthrough for the scientists. One Alien device literally madedoorways where none existed before. By using this device, the scientists wereable to walk through walls regardless of the composition or thickness of them.There are no manmade or natural materials that did not yield to this Aliendevice.The operation of it was effortless. The scientists simply willed themselvesthrough the barrier while possessing the Alien device. This device did notchange shape as did many of the other Alien items. It was about the size of apiece of chalk such as teachers use on chalk boards. However, the color of itwas black, but not just any black. This black was so dark it seemed to have anabsorption quality to it. When activated, lights in the area dimmed. It seemedto absorb energy from its surroundings. The person holding it has the sensationof suction similar to holding a vacuum cleaner nozzle to one's skin. It wasusually carried in one of the pockets of the flight jackets worn by thescientists. Many of the scientists wore flight jackets, especially if they didmost of their work out in the field. Also, many - if not all - of those whoworked on this project are accomplished pilots.Because this device had properties that seemed to draw things to it, it wastheorized that its composition was similar to a neutron star. A neutron star is adead star that no longer gives off light. Instead, it absorbs material like asponge. It does not get bigger as more debris is absorbed into it, but smaller. Itbecomes increasingly dense as it sucks up more and more material from space.If it absorbs enough stuff, it will collapse into itself and become a \"BlackHole.\" A teaspoon full of matter from a neutron star weighs thousands ofpounds. This was the only possible flaw with the theory about this device,since it was as light as a feather. Yet, it could have a minute amount ofneutron star material in it. If that were true, that fact in itself would be morefantastic than the Alien ship. Because there is no way to retrieve neutron starmaterial, anything that even came remotely close to that kind of star wouldinstantly vaporize before being sucked into it.Another device the psychics discovered immobilized a person by somehowparalyzing them. The device was similar to a laser pen, except that the beamwas visible and only extended three feet. The person who was paralyzedremained fully conscious, but was unable to move in any way except for hiseyes. People who are touched by this beam are literally frozen in their strides."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"They remained that way as long as the beam made contact with their head.Once the beam was lifted, the person under its power quickly regainednormality, although the subject became disoriented and did not rememberwhat, if anything, had happened to them. That feeling lasted less than aminute. One scientist who succumbed to it during an experiment equated it toa mild dizzy spell.Every new breakthrough whetted the appetite of the committee, so when thediscoveries waned, they became impatient. It was in one of those lulls that thecommittee again began discussing the use of humans as guinea pigs. Thecommittee had hoped that the psychics would have made better and fasterprogress in unlocking the secrets of the Alien cargo. That would havealleviated them from facing such a decision. It was an agonizing direction togo in for some of the committee members, but they were under pressure fromthe White House to come up with more results.The committee was in a dilemma. How would they carry out experimentationon human subjects and still be able to sleep at night? And that was just thecompassion component of the problem. The legal part of the problem becamemore of a concern as the decade of the 1940s - where human violations wereeasier to hide - progressed into the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. In that evolution,the mood of the nation changed swiftly and decidedly against governmentinstitutions. Even the most hard-boiled among the scientists knew that it wasonly a matter of time before their covert organization would be discoveredand exposed.\"When that day comes, heads would surely roll,\" proclaimed one of thescientists in the report. None believed it would be in their lifetime, but therewas always that possibility. There were no easy answers, especially since thecommittee itself was vehemently divided on that one issue. Because of thatdisagreement, it was feared that someone in the team might leak thatinformation to the press.After weeks of arguing back and forth about using humans in their labs, aconsensus was reached: \"The scientists would take the experiments into thebattlefield.\" The idea came from the two military attaches that were membersof the committee. They made the proposal to their colleagues on thecommittee after returning from a White House briefing with the President andhis Chiefs of Staff. At the briefing, they learned that the possibility of Americagoing to war in Korea was highly probable. That would solve their problem.They would set up a MASH unit that could take the worst casualties of thewar.The scientists could then use the soldiers and other victims of the war forexperiments. They would only experiment on those who had a low probabilityof survival.The war provided them with multiple opportunities. They had the use ofcaptured prisoners and enemy casualties to test the Alien devices forsuitability as weapons. The scientists had only one major problem: the Alieninstruments reverted back to the Alien craft every three days. They wouldhave to move the Alien craft closer to where they would be doing theexperiments. This move presented another problem. There were many peopleworking on various unrelated research programs that involved the Alien craft,but had nothing to do with the experiments they were going to do in the warzone. The experiments on humans were a fraction of the activity that tookplace during those years, but that area of research was the top priority of \"thepowers that be.\" So, the Alien ship went wherever that unit of scientists wassent.Japan was that place. It was just minutes away by air from Korea and therewas already a large American military presence there. At that time, Japan wasstill a post-World War II economy and was undergoing a massiveinfrastructure rebuilding with the help of the United States government. Theinstallation of a highly classified operation as this one was took place withoutanyone noticing.There were American scientists in Japan that were studying the effects ofradiation poisoning. Only five years earlier in 1945, the atom bombs had beendropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. The devastation of that war was stillapparent in 1950 when the committee set up its headquarters there.The location the committee chose was never disclosed and was only located in"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Japan for the duration of the Korean War. There were those in the committeewho had compassion for the Japanese people after witnessing the effects ofthe bombs. The scientists hoped to learn enough about the Alien instrumentsto undo some of the radiation damage that inflicted thousands of Japanesepeople. They did not perform experiments on the Japanese. They waited untilthere was conclusive evidence for what the instruments were capable of doingbefore any attempt was made to treat civilians.In a war situation where life and death, misery and brutality flashed at a rapidpace daily, few committee members felt that what they were about to do inKorea was wrong. They knew that humanity was given a gift (the Alien craft)full of untold possibilities. It was their job to put it to good use. Others in thecommittee felt that what they had in their possession could also be subvertedand made into a weapon that would unleash a nightmare onto the world - anightmare that would eclipse the horror of the atom bombs that were droppedon Japan.As the committee had expected from information given to them by sources intheir organization, the Soviet-trained forces of North Korea invaded SouthKorea in the summer of 1950. Within days of that invasion, United Nationstroops, led by General Douglas MacArthur, entered the fighting and beganpushing the North Korean troops back behind the 38th Parallel.It was two and a half years earlier that the committee had come intopossession of the Alien craft. Now, with the war started, they knew they wereon the verge of unlocking some of the secrets of the universe.It was not a smooth operation. Just as they set up camp, advancing NorthKorean troops overran them. More than once, the scientists ended up losingdoctors and technicians, as well as the Alien instruments. The difference wasthat the instruments always returned to the ship undamaged, where they wereretrieved again and again. But the missing scientists did not return.The experiments were haphazard. The stress of being minutes from the frontlines and always in fear of being overrun by enemy troops took its toll on thestaff. Of the three years that the war lasted, only a few months of it wereconsidered productive. The bulk of what had been studied was lost in transitfrom having to move so often. The rest was just lost when the camp wasdestroyed. What was salvaged was suspect because of the brutal conditionsunder which they had to perform.The team members chose to work close to the front lines so that they couldwork with injured bodies that were as fresh off the battlefield as possible. ThatMASH unit did serve in its true capacity and doctored wounded soldiers. Theyonly experimented with those who were found to be beyond hope.Still, progress was made during those years. The committee was able toforward a breakdown of some of the Alien items and what those items didduring the testing on mortally wounded soldiers from both sides.This committee was not privy to the nature or extent that the Alien items wereused as weapons, or even if they were, since that testing was carried out by aseparate government agency.The President of the United States was briefed daily on all findings regardingthis project, no matter how insignificant. But on occasion, he was given asummary which described with more detail some of the more prominentfindings and occurrences. The report was brief and gave a short description ofthe items and a sketch of what they looked like. In most cases, the sketch wasof little importance and only served to show what the item looked like when itwas sketched. The Alien objects had the tendency to change physicalappearance on a regular basis. All of the objects in the report were identifiedwith at least one function, although the report stated that each object couldpossibly perform dozens or even hundreds of other applications.One of the reports stressed that it would take years of study just to scratch thesurface of what these things are capable of doing. For that reason, some onthe committee made suggestions to the President that some items ought to bereleased on a limited basis to their civilian counterparts. They were certainthat it was a time to let the scientific community have access to a few of theAlien objects. Their thoughts were that something of this magnitude needed tobe studied by a broad range of institutions, in hope that the benefits could bediscovered and put to use in the near future as opposed to a very distantfuture if they had to continue to work in the current clandestine manner."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Others in the committee disagreed and felt that this could be a \"Trojan horse,\"rationalizing that the Aliens might be trying to \"lure\" the human race intothinking they are benevolent - or worse, to intimidate mankind by lettinghumans know what they are up against!The President was briefed on both views and decided that it was bad policy toacknowledge a power that was infinitely superior to anything on this planet.The reason, he told the committee members, \"was that the sense of balanceand security that Americans enjoyed could be disrupted by that kind ofrevelation, possibly damaging the American economy and throwing it and therest of the world into chaos.\"The President emphasized to the committee that he might have sounded alittle \"melodramatic,\" but nevertheless, those are his views. He then added,\"The committee will become more shrouded in its operations, not less.\"It was no coincidence that expenditures in military spending increased witheach succeeding President. The discovery of the Alien ship in 1947 hadeverything to do with it. The Cold War with the USSR was more of a \"RedHerring\" than a real fear of Communism. Not that Russia was not dangerousand unpredictable. The USSR was \"and did deserve keeping an eye on\" (aquote in the memo from the President). After the discovery of the Alien shipnear Roswell, New Mexico, many at the top echelon of government weremore fearful of things not of this world than anything from this world.Unfortunately, the Russians - who were already paranoid and looked upon theUnited States as the only country that stood in the way of them and Europeuniting under one flag - the Soviet Union mistook the American militarybuildup as a direct threat to them. Therefore, the Cold War escalated to apoint that the two superpowers became the real threat to this planet, morethan any threat from the Aliens.Continued in Part 4 - Alien Medical InstrumentsMore Information:For further reports about extraterrestrial biological entities and technologies, please seemy books, An Alien Harvest and the 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities in theEarthfiles Shop.
