It's just not feasible - not possible!” - Carl Higdon, his 1974 abduction while elk hunting Return to Part 1October 25, 2007 Laramie, Wyoming - On November 2, 1974, Leo Sprinkle, Ph.D., thenProf. of Psychology and Director of the Division of Counseling and Testing at theUniversity of Wyoming in Laramie, Wyoming, first conducted an interview with CarlHigdon in Carl's home, from approximately 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. In his original notes, Dr.Sprinkle wrote, “Those present included Carl and Margery Higdon, their children (RoseBryson, age 15; Lilly, age 14; Michael, age 12; Lyle, age 11, and several relatives.) Visitorswere: Mr. Rick Kenyon, Art Teacher, Rawlins Public Schools; Mr. Robert (Bob) Nantkes,Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor, Riverton.”The goal was to understand more about Carl's encounter with a non-human entity around 4p.m. after he shot at an elk and saw the 7 mm bullet drop to the ground only about 50 feetfrom his rifle on October 25, 1974, in the Medicine Bow National Forest.In the transcription of the interview, the code below indicates the names of persons duringthe November 2, 1974, interview:CH = Carl HigdonMH = Margery HigdonRK = Rick KenyonBN = Bob NantkesLS = Leo SprinkleSon = Son of Carl HigdonRel = Relative of Carl HigdonCarl Higdon was very puzzled about what happened to his pickup truck. It was found byCarbon County, Wyoming, Sheriff's deputies about three miles from where Carlremembered originally parking it. His wife, Margery, told Dr. Sprinkle that in the hospitalafter he was found in a confused state, not even knowing who he was, that he told his wifethe non-human entity \"pointed a gun at it (pickup) and it disappeared.\"Dr. Sprinkle sought clarification and said, \"So, it was not 'lifted.' It was 'dematerialized.'\"Rick Kenyon and Dr. Sprinkle asked Carl about his memory of seeing elk in the 'cubicle' ofthe space vehicle. Carl Higdon said the elk were in some kind of cage. Carl said he wassitting in a \"big, high-backed bucket seat, like on a sports car. But it was real plush. Theseelk were behind me. Now, whether they were transported there before I was, and I seen'em as I entered, or what? But I can't remember there bein' no doors or anything. It wouldbe just like you was dematerialized here, flyin' through there, and set down there. I can'tremember no doors bein' in this cubicle.\"\"RK: Did the elk appear to be normal size?CH: Yeah, they were just out in the field there. Then (snaps fingers) inside thiscubicle. I just can't recall how I seen them in there. But, I'd have to go alongwith that three people, six feet, and five elk can't fit into a five by sevencubicle and be the same (normal) size (we know). There's no way!LS: Did you have the impression that these were real live elk?CH: Yeah, they were alive, as far as I can tell.Carl talks about running into another man around 4 p.m., October 25, 1974, on top of a hill."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"CH: I told him I was goin' to walk down the hill. He said, 'You're not drivin'? Isaid, 'No, I'm goin' to leave my pickup up here 'cause I don't know how theroads are. I'm goin' to check 'em out first before I try to drive down in there.'And boy, I want to tell you, you go down and look at those roads and thereain't nobody would try to drive a two-wheel pickup down in there! There's justno way!The last I can remember of the day was talkin' to him (named Eaton) up on thetop of the hill and I told him I was goin' to hunt lower. I hadn't seen no elk onthe side of that hill and I figured maybe they were down lower, like they wereup in Lincoln Park.So, I walked down over the hill and, of course, the trees and stuff werebetween five and seven feet apart and down over the crest. There was aclearing down at the bottom and this is where I seen the elk. There was five of'em. One three-point bull. Naturally we have a license for those and I wantedto get me a bull!I just raised my gun and shot. I could see the bullet move through the air and itwent out about 50 to 60 feet and it just hit somethin' and it stopped. Now atthis point, I didn't realize anything was wrong. Then I get to thinkin' back on itnow (and realize) there was no sound or nothin', once I topped over the hill. Itwas just like you was in a void - no birds or nothin'. And I believe the guys(deputies) that come in down there that night said the same thing. They didn'thear no sound, didn't raise any kind of wild life when they went down throughthere.I seen this bullet hit and then I heard a branch snap. Naturally I am carefulwith a gun anyway, but my gun went down then. See, as I turned around, mygun was pointin' towards the ground, other than towards maybe somebody thatwas standing up there, you see? I've read a lot of articles in books about theseguys shootin', you know, and then lookin' later, and I just figured I didn't wantto do somethin' like that. So, my gun was down.When I looked up, here was this guy standin' there. He said, 'How you doin'?'And I said, 'Pretty good.' And then he said, 'Are you hungry?' And I told him,'Yeah, a little.' So, then he threw me this package of pills. There was four of'em in this package. He told me to take one of them and that it would last mefour days. So, I don't know why I did it, but I just tore it open. You know, it asthe kind of package you get the two-way cold tablets in? More like Contac(packages). Then I took one.He asked if I wanted to go with him. And I said, 'I guess.' The next thing thatformed in my mind was, 'Well, we're inside this cubicle!' And this is where I'mkind of fuzzy. I don't know whether the elk were already in there when weentered? Or whether ...? But whenever I got in there, I don't rememberstanding up. The only thing I remember was setting in that chair with my handslike this, in this seat, and then these deals come out from this side, from theright and from the left. They come across my arms and hooked in this side.The same way across my legs. So, my hands were pinned down.And I noticed the guy's (entity's) hands weren't pinned down. So evidentlywhen they sat down, they were like this until these deals come around thebody and then they had their arms free.Then the next thing I can remember is looking down and there's this big ball,like a basketball, you know? You could see right through the floor of whateverthis (aerial) vessel was. And then the lights were, when we landed. I presumewe landed. We got into this area where the lights was so bad that I just couldn'tstand it! How my hands got up around my face, I don't know, unless we hadlanded and these deals (arm locks) had released? I just told him (entity) thelights hurt me too bad. I just couldn't take it!They said, 'Your sun burns us.'They didn't say, 'Hurts your eyes.' He says, 'Burns us.'And I can't remember those guys gettin' in the sunlight, whatsoever, unless itwould have been on the takeoff, which I can't remember nothin' except lookin'down and seein' this big ball below me, you know? But the lights were alldifferent colors, like they was on a pendulum. Oh, what's that cafe in Seattle,at the World's Fair? It turned, rotated."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"LS: Space Needle?CH: Yeah, but these were about a foot strips of light goin' up this deal - alldifferent colors - and then rotatin', see? And I just couldn't stand the light, sothey said they'd take me back.LS: Not only was it bright, it seemed to actually hurt?CH: It was just like looking at an arc welder, you know, only the next - well,whenever they got me into town - the lights hurt my eyes. But I didn't have - itwasn't like sandpaper - (not) like your eyes get arc burn. I've had my eyes arcburned before and it wasn't exactly like that. It was more like - if you can callit a soothing burn.LS: Irritating?CH: Yeah, irritating burn.BN: Were you conscious? Or after you got back, were you burned around theeyes?CH: No, just my eyes. I think somebody, I believe it was Roy (Flemming,Carbon County Sheriff's Deputy), said, 'God, look how red his eyes are!' But itwas just the inside. I don't think the outside was so bad. It was just the whitepart of the eye was just all red.BN: I've seen it like when you braise something, if you don't have someprotection.CH: No, it wasn't on the outside. It was on the inside of my eye and theywatered all the time. I can remember laying there on the hospital emergencyroom and they had to put this washcloth over my eyes. Then they turned thelights off also. But my eyes - the water just poured out of 'em.LS: Then what's your next recollection after they said, 'Well, we'll take youback?' Did you have the feeling of going back?CH: No, I really didn't feel nothin'. When they said, 'Well, we'll take youback,' then the next thing I can remember is walking down this road, if youwant to call it that. I would have called it a cow trail! But I was walking downthis cow trail and then I seen the pickup settin' there. It didn't dawn on me thatit was mine. But I had my gun and this is another thing that was funny. I don'tremember takin' the gun with me, but I remember walking by the pickup andhavin' the gun in my hand. So, what happened to the gun? I don't know.Then I walked past the pickup and I looked at the road where just like I toldRoy Flemming (Carbon County Sheriff's Deputy) over the radio, 'Anybodythat drove a pickup down there had to be nuts!'LS: Especially at night, huh?CH: Well, this was in the daytime. Well, no, it was startin' to get dark aboutthat time. But the pickup was already there. So evidently somebody drove it inthere in the daytime, if it was drove in there! Just like I told them over theradio, they'd have to be crazy to drive a pickup down there 'cause the rutswere deeper than the wheels. You'd have to 'high-center' comin' down throughthere. And the trees were close enough to the road to where you almost had tostay in the ditch. And without a four-wheel drive, there's no way you couldkeep the front end up. You have to have somethin' pullin' in order to hold youup out of 'em. But the part - the gun - that kinda - well, ever once in a while,that kinda bothers me.LS: How'd that happen?CH: Yeah, where was the gun when we were in this cubicle? And how did Iget it back? And how did I get approximately four or five miles farther eastthan where I was to start with?LS: And the time - what time was it? Was it about 4:30 PM in the afternoonwhen you started hunting?CH: No. Whenever I started down over this hill, it was just shortly after 4 PM,I'd say, probably 4:15 PM. No later than that, according to this guy that theyfound out there that I talked to at 4 PM. It couldn't have been over a15-minute walk away from where I went over this hill."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"LS: Yeah, and then the place where the pickup was. Do you remember whattime that was? Was it just about dark?CH: Well, it was about 6:30 PM. It would have had to have been around 6 or6:15 PM because I'd walked about a mile past the pickup and it was startin' toget dark. I turned around and went back to the pickup, figuring that would be -if I had to stay out there all night, I'd be better off in the pickup than I wouldout in the cold. So then when I got back to the pickup, I heard this womantalkin' and so I started the pickup up.Well, I fiddled around there and found the key, which was in the ignition. Iwasn't sure where the key switch was in this particular pickup. Just as I toldRoy, after talkin' to him, that even if the pickup wasn't stuck, I couldn't drive itanyway 'cause it had this funny-looking stick shift down on the floor! And Ivery seldom drive an automatic, usually always a four-speed. But at this time,I couldn't remember. The fact is, when I learned how to drive, it was a '35 Fordwith a stick shift in the middle, you know? That's normal. But there...LS: Did you ever figure out what it was that you were hearing when you saidyou heard a woman talking? Not over the radio?CH: Yeah, it was over the radio. She was talkin' to, well, at that time, it was aguy by the name of John. And then I cut in on her and asked her if she couldhelp me. I was somewhere down in the woods and I didn't know where I wasand I didn't know who I was. I asked her two or three times. So, I figuredmaybe you can't 'send' (radio signal) in that area. Then pretty soon RoyFlemming (Carbon County Sheriff's Deputy) come on the radio. That womanwould not talk back to me, but Roy did. Then I rummaged around in the glovebox and found out what the pickup number was and told him so they'd knowwhat pickup they were lookin' for.RK: What time was it when you made radio contact? Do you have any idea?CH: Well, according to Roy and Margie, it was around 6:30 PM, you know,made radio contact with Riverton.RK: What time did they get to you?CH: Oh, somewhere around 11:30 PM to midnight - somewhere in there.RK: What did you think of in the process?CH: Well, I didn't have much time to think because they left this woman up inthe office there in Riverton and every five minutes or so, she'd call and makesure I was still there. 'Cause they didn't want me gettin' outa the pickup. Theythought I'd fell and hurt myself. It was their response when I told 'em, I says,'No, I ain't - I didn't feel like I fell and hurt myself. My back, my neck, myhead hurt me, (but) I still don't believe I fell. Course they ain't nobody elsesays so either. (laughter) Anyway, the doctor, they took X-rays from about myknees to the top of my head. They didn't find no bruises, no marks.LS: You said you had a tender spot on the head or back of the neck?CH: Yeah, right on the top of my head on Sunday night. Last Sunday nightthere in the hospital, they had to give me some tranquilizers or somethin' so Icould go to sleep. Then this guy there in the room said I had a heck of a timegoin' to sleep, even with both those pills in me. He said I was tossin' and turnin'most of the night. So, I don't know what I was dreamin'. I don't remember.LS: Now, as you think back on it now, do things come any different to you interms of sleeping and dreaming? Do you get any flashes about those things?CH: No. Just the only thing was the pickup. How did it get down in there?How the gun could shoot a bullet like that? Which I'm not goin' to say becauseI really don't know how a seven mag. could shoot 50 feet and come out lookin'like that! It's just not feasible - not possible! Unless you were shootin' into apretty thick steel wall. I'm not too sure that the mag. wouldn't go through just apiece of quarter-inch steel 'cause it'll go all the way through a telephone pole ata hundred yards with no problem.LS: And there was nothing in the way, no tree or anything like that?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Margery Higdon wrote on back of 1974 photograph she took: \"Meadow (where) elk werewhen Carl shot at (one). (Ink circle marks) where Carl was standing.\"Photograph in 1974 by Margery Higdon.CH: No trees or nothin'. Well, there's trees there, but you know, they werescattered out, five to seven feet apart. There was just no way that there was atree or nothin' like that in front of me when I shot.LS: Could you hear any sound when the bullet ...?CH: No, it stopped. Funny thing, when the bullet went out, I heard a splat. ButI really can't remember the gun goin' off, you know, like maybe...RK: Was there a spent shell in the chamber?CH: Yes.BN: This wasn't one of the rounds that you carried that came out of the gun atthat time?CH: Yeah.BN: This feels like it's got the ... this was the chamber and it feels like therings of the lands of the rifle barrel. Feel the rough edge around the top of thecase - a little under the chamber.MH: Is that all of 'em?BN: Well, it possibly could be just in the manufacturing.CH: No, these - all these up here's the ones I was carrying in my pocket.These are all out of the same box.BN: Yeah, that's in the manufacturing, where they crimped it.RK: Do you have the empty chamber, the empty cylinder that the bullet cameout of? Not the bullet itself, but casing. Is this the casing here?BN: Yeah, that's just the crimping of the bullet.CH: These all came out of the same box. I've been tempted to go out and firea couple of them and see if they'll move, you know? I'm kinda scared to do it,but all the rest of 'em did 'cause I sighted my gun with 'em.LS: When did you pick up the bullet?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"CH: Now, this I don't remember. I don't remember ever movin' from where Iturned around with the gun to talk to this fella (non-human). I don't rememberever movin' from there.

Photograph © 1974 by Carl Higdon.RK: Was there anything else in the canteen pouch?MH: I haven't looked. This (empty cartridge and impacted bullet) wasn't reallyin the pouch. It was just in the folds of the canteen belt.BN: 'Course on that gun, if you're thinkin' in term of an underload - if it was, itwouldn't have deformed the thing (bullet) to that extent.CH: I wouldn't think so, either, but traveling 50 or 60 feet, it don't look likeit'd be that much damage. I've tried to come up with somethin' that if youwalked down the street and told 'em your gun had done this - well, no way!Not in that area because there's no steel (plate) - there's nothin' out there thatwould cause that (discharged bullet to fall to the ground only 50 feet from rifleand be so bent up). If it (road ruts) wasn't real bad, I'd like to go out there andlook again. In my own mind, there's just nothin' there except spruce trees, orwhatever you call them white, spindly trees - aspen - and that's all there isthere. And that stuff isn't hard enough to do that to a 7 mag. shell that wascomin' outa there at 3600 feet per second. But normally, you don't see a bulletwhen it comes out the end of the barrel!LS: Yeah, right. You were able to see this (bullet traveling through air)though?CH: Yeah, well, you know, when you're lookin' down the scope and you pullthe trigger and you can see the bullet come outa the end. But I can't rememberno real loud bang. That thing sounds like a cannon when you shoot it right nextto you. And I can't remember the noise. But I do remember hearing a - well,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"you see the bullet go out and splat! Just like that. Then it fell.
