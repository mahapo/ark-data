July 12, 2007 Paris, France, and Pasadena, California - Scientists report the firstconclusive discovery of the presence of water vapor in the atmosphere of a planet beyondour Solar System. The discovery was made by analyzing the transit of the gas giant HD189733b across its star, in the Infrared. The findings appear in the July 12, 2007, issue of thescientific journal Nature. The original paper, titled ‘Water vapour in the atmosphere of atransiting extrasolar planet’, is by G.Tinetti, A.Vidal-Madjar, M-C. Liang, J-P. Beaulieu, Y.L. Yung, S. Carey, R. Barber, J. Tennyson, I. Ribas, N. Allard, G. Ballester, D.K. Sing, F.Selsis.The European Space Agency reports that:\"Giovanna Tinetti, ESA fellow at the Institute d’Astrophysique de Paris, andcolleagues from around the world, used data from NASA’s Spitzer SpaceTelescope. They targeted planet HD 189733b, 63 light-years away, in theconstellation Vulpecula, south of Cygnus.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - Vulpecula, Latin: \"little fox\") is a faintnorthern constellation located in the middle of the SummerTriangle, an asterism consisting of the bright stars Deneb, Vega andAltair.]"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The constellation Vulpecula, south of the constellation Cygnus.Within it 63 light-years from Earth is planet HD 189733b, confirmed to havewater vapor in its hot atmosphere. Map © 2003 by Torsten Bronger.The planet was discovered in 2005 as it dimmed the light of its parent star bysome three percent when transiting in front of it. Using Spitzer, Tinetti and theteam observed the star, which is slightly fainter than the Sun. They watched itsstarlight dim at two infrared bands (3.6 and 5.8 micrometres). The Spitzer SpaceTelescope is a NASA mission managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Thiswebsite is maintained by the Spitzer Science Center, located on the campus ofthe California Institute of Technology and part of NASA's Infrared Processingand Analysis Center.Had the planet been a rocky body devoid of atmosphere, both these bands and athird one (8 micrometres), recently measured by a team at Harvard, would haveshown the same behavior.Instead, as the planet’s tenuous outer atmosphere slipped across the face of thestar, the starlight absorbed showed a different, distinctive pattern. Theatmosphere absorbed less infrared radiation at 3.6 micrometres than at the othertwo wavelengths.“Water is the only molecule that can explain that behavior,” says Tinetti.The presence of water vapour does not necessarily make it a good candidate inthe search for planets that harbor life. “This is a far from habitable world,” sheadds.Instead of a rocky world like Earth, HD 189733b is large, about 1.15 times themass of Jupiter. Located just 4.5 million km from its star, it orbits it in 2.2 days.In comparison, Earth is 150 million km from the Sun; even Mercury, theinnermost planet, is 70 million km away.Transiting Exoplanet HD 189733b, in the InfraredAstronomers classify such worlds as ‘hot Jupiters’. These planets tend to haveextensive atmospheres because heat from the nearby star gives them energy toexpand. HD 189733b is no exception; its diameter is 1.25 times that of Jupiter.HD 189733b’s atmospheric temperature is about 1000 Kelvin (a little more than700°C) or higher, implying that the significant amounts of water vapour in theatmosphere cannot condense to fall as rain or form clouds. The temperaturewould have to be about five times lower to form clouds of water vapour or rain.That does not mean the atmosphere is sedate, however. The planet is gripped sotightly by the gravity of its star that one hemisphere constantly faces the star,heating the planet only on one side. This probably generates fierce windssweeping from the day-side to the night-side. “There are a thousand things tolearn about these planets,” says Tinetti.Although, being a gas giant, the planet is an unlikely candidate in the search forlife, these results increase hopes for the detection of water on other rockyplanets, which astronomers hope to discover in the near future."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"France‘s COROT mission, in which ESA participates, is expected to detectdozens of transiting gas giants, and has been working so well that it may alsodetect nearly Earth-sized worlds.Atmospheres of rocky planets should be much more tenuous, so they will haveto wait for future space telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope,before they can be investigated.Further into the future, the mission Darwin is expected to be proposed to ESAin the context of the Cosmic Vision Programme, its launch proposed sometimeafter 2018. A constellation of four spacecraft, Darwin’s goal would be to findand analyze atmospheres of Earth-sized planets, looking for telltale signs ofwater vapour and other gases that might betray life on those worlds.\"More Information:NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California, manages the Spitzer SpaceTelescope for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington.
