At least that’s the plan for what is being called a “frozen Noah’s Ark” to be builtinside a cold mountain on the archipelago of Svalbard, Norway, in the Arctic.Construction begins in March and is expected to be finished by October this year. ThisNoah’s Ark for Earth seeds is being paid for by the Norwegian government, in affiliationwith the U. N.’s Food and Agricultural Organization’s Global Crop Diversity Trust.The fear is that global warming will keep increasing over this century, turning some farmland into desert, flooding other low grounds and generally changing growing seasons,rainfall and insects. Many plants won’t be able to survive the rapid changes. Somescientists fear that even the Amazon rainforest might not survive into the next century. Ifwe lose the diversity of crops we have now, we could end up seriously depleting thisplanet’s future food and medical supplies.The Noah’s Ark seed vaults will hold samples of all the food crop varieties in case plantbreeders will have to design totally new varieties to survive on the changing planet. Thesteady cold temperature of the Svalbard, Norway, mountain - far enough above sea levelto remain dry in rising waters - could sustain frozen seeds for 200 or more years.The scientist in charge of creating and sustaining the Noah’s Ark seed vaults is CaryFowler, Ph.D., and Executive Director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust. Earlier thisweek, I talked with him about the latest U. N. report by the Inter-Governmental Panel OnClimate Change. It says in worst case, the average global temperature could increase 11 ½degrees over the next 90 years. I asked Dr. Fowler what he thinks the consequences wouldbe for the plant world if there is that much global warming.Interview:Cary Fowler, Ph.D., Executive Director, Global Crop Diversity Trust, U. N.’s Foodand Agricultural Organization (FAO), Rome, Italy: “The consequences are almostoverwhelming, particularly because the most severe impact of climate change is predicted"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"to occur in regions of the world that are least capable of adjusting, where the poorestpeople on Earth live.Many people might think that having agriculture adapt to global climate change is going tobe reasonably simple and straightforward. Many people think that climate change andglobal warming are synonymous and that’s pretty much the end of it. So they think that allyou’d have to do is move a particular variety of plants growing in one place up severalhundred miles north just because the temperatures will be about the same some years fromnow in that new location.That’s not going to work. We won’t simply take existing varieties of plants and move themto a place where the temperatures are the same as they are now.If we were to do that, we would expose the plants to different seasonality of light atdifferent latitudes, different day lengths, all kinds of things that would trigger biologicalresponses in that variety that really would not work in the new location. There would benew pests and diseases; new soil; new amounts of rainfall.So, all the characteristics that go into making up a modern wheat or corn variety are reallygoing to have to be juggled around a little bit to produce varieties that farmers can growunder new conditions. It’s going to be a major, major challenge.THIS NOAH’S ARK MIGHT ABSOLUTELY BE VITAL TO PERPETUATING FOODAND CROPS AND PLANTS ON THE EARTH NOW?We think it might well be. We will have to breed new varieties of agricultural crops if weexpect to even keep pace with current production levels, much less feed a growing worldpopulation.THAT IS FACED WITH SO MUCH CHANGE IN THE CLIMATE.That’s right. And I’ll mention one other thing because one of the ways that climate changewill manifest itself is through water. Agriculture today takes about 70% of fresh watersupplies. But agriculture competes – it competes with the cities and industry and there areover 200 major river systems in the world that provide water for agriculture that areflowing through multiple countries. The demand for water is going to increase, there willpossibly be increasing conflicts over water, and agriculture is going to be squeezed byurban users. So, we’re also going to have to produce agricultural crops that produce morecrops per drop.THE QUESTION IS: HOW MANY POPULATIONS OF HUMANS ARE NOW GOINGTO HAVE TO BE MOVED OVER THE NEXT NINE DECADES BECAUSE OF SEALEVEL RISE, WHILE YOU ARE TRYING ALSO TO PROVIDE BIODIVERSITY INPLANTS THAT COULD FEED THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOVING.It gives you a bit of a pause if you think erroneously, I believe, that crops can simply bemoved around the world. Noah's Ark Vaults in Svalbard,Norway's Arctic ArchipelagoSvalbard archipelago underlined in yellow north of Norway, not far from the North Pole.The Noah Ark seed vaults will be built inside a mountain outside Svalbard.CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW YOU ARE GOING TO BUILD THIS NOAH’S ARK AND"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WHERE EXACTLY?In Svalbard, which is reasonably near the North Pole. It’s part of Norway. It’s actuallyunder an international treaty, but Norway as sovereignty. This is north of mainlandNorway. If you fly as far north as you can fly in Norway, you need to get on another jetplane and fly about an hour and a half north of there. So, if you’re going to trek to theNorth Pole, this is where you’re going first.Once you get there, you’ll land in a small village where 1500 people live there year round.It’s very much a Norwegian research and government site and it’s a mountainous area.Very cold, as you can imagine.Svalbard, Norway, village where 1500 Norwegian researchand government workers live year round. Image courtesy Global Crop Diversity Trust.And this seed vault is going to be built inside the mountain. We’re going to tunnel about120 meters through solid stone to a place in the mountain, which at the moment is aboutminus-6 Celsius, very cold. There, we will have two rooms, two vaults about 20 by 15meters each. This is where we will store about – well, we’ll have the capacity to store 3million seed samples.Each sample would be about 500 seeds – of a particular variety. And those seeds would bestored in foil packages that are sealed inside boxes. We would have the capacity to storeabout 3 million samples, which would represent virtually all the diversity of agriculturalcrops that can be stored as seed.Seed of most agricultural crops can be safely stored alive, kept alive, for a long, long time,simply by having the moisture level reduced to a very low level to reduce biologicalactivity and then freezing them. If you do this properly – depending on the crop – you canstore seeds safely for decades, hundreds of years and even some projections are over athousand years.HOW HIGH ABOVE SEA LEVEL WOULD THIS NOAH’S ARK BE?It’s going to be quite high above sea level – I think something like 120 meters (395 feet).We’ve calculated worst case scenarios for climate change. And if both of the polar icecaps melt – if the ice in Greenland melts – this facility is still going to be many metersabove the worst case scenario of where the new sea level would be. Even if globalwarming takes hold in Svalbard, relatively speaking, this is still going to be a much colderplace than most of the rest of the world. We’ll still have frozen conditions in the seed vault200 years from now if our worst case climate change scenario is true."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Illustration of \"Noah's Ark\" seed vault entrance into mountain near Svalbard.Graphic courtesy Global Crop Diversity Trust.WHEN YOU TALK TO YOUR COLLEAGUES AND YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT:WHAT IF THE WORST CASE IS REALITY IN THE NEXT NINE DECADES ANDBEYOND, WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE WORST HAPPENING?The worst happening is the melting of the ice caps and significant changes that will causelarge social disruptions, particularly in developing countries. We really want to avoid that.One of the things that the seed vault will do is to provide human beings in the future withthe security of knowing that the agricultural options that they still need are intact. So,we’re not saving crops because it’s pretty. This is not a museum or stamp collection. It’sreally something that is quite critical.WITHOUT IT, WE MIGHT LOSE THE PREVIOUS BIODIVERSITY OF THEPREVIOUS CENTURIES UP TO THIS DATE IN THE FACE OF TOTALUNPREDICTABILITY OF WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN GLOBAL CLIMATECHANGE.That’s right. And of course, we are still subject to problems of natural disasters and warsand civil strife. We’ve lost several important and unique seed collections in the past fewyears. The seed collections in Iraq and Afghanistan were destroyed in the chaos around thewars there. We had a typhoon that struck the national seed bank in the Philippines this pastSeptember, destroying some of the collections there.When I say these events destroyed some of the seed collections, I’m really saying it drovethem into extinction. These are varieties of plants that will never exist again – just as goneas a dinosaur is. What we can expect is that these events destroyed biodiversity traits –perhaps disease resistance, perhaps a nutritional quality, perhaps a taste, perhaps a color ofa flower, which will never exist again. This is something that we simply cannot continue toallow to happen if we are serious about wanting to remain on Earth ourselves.Amazon rainforest destruction.
