(BBC) reported: \"A British man, Gary McKinnon, couldface a prison sentence of 45 years. He has lost his High Court fight against extradition tothe U.S. for allegedly carrying out the 'biggest military computer hack of all time.'Glasgow-born Gary McKinnon, of north London, is accused of gaining access to 97 U.S.military and NASA computers. Home Secretary John Reid granted the U.S. request toextradite him for trial.\"At the High Court in London, his lawyers argued the 41-year-old had been subjected to'improper threats' and the move would breach his human rights. His lawyers had arguedthat, if extradited, he would face an unknown length of time in pre-trial detention, with nolikelihood of bail. He would also face a long prison sentence - 'in the region of 45 years' -and may not be allowed to serve part of the sentence at home in the UK, his lawyers hadsaid.\"But, on Tuesday, Lord Justice Maurice Kay and Mr. Justice Goldring dismissed his legalchallenge, saying they could not find any grounds for appeal.\"BackgroundGary McKinnon was arrested in November 2002, and admitted at the time he accessedthe computer networks of a wide number of U.S. military institutions between February2001 and March 2002, when he was looking for UFO-related information and found somuch lax computer security in the American networks that he could access some websites.Gary McKinnon's lawyer, Ben Cooper, announced that Gary McKinnon will now seek tomake an appeal against his extradition at the House of Lords. Another attorney, JeffreyAnderson, told reporters that among the issues raised in McKinnon's appeal will be allegedthreats by U. S. authorities that Gary McKinnon \"would fry.\" The implication is capital"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"punishment by the electric chair under the charge of being a \"cyber-terrorist.\"Attorney Anderson said, \"This could lead to him spending the rest of his life in prison inthe U.S., with repatriation to serve his sentence in his home country denied as punishmentfor contesting his extradition.\" Press Release by Gary McKinnon Attorneys April 3, 2007\"McKinnon v USA and Secretary of State for Home Dpt. Gary McKinnon will apply for leave to appeal to the House of Lords within14 days.The High Court has expressed its disapproval of the deliberately coercive pleabargaining tactics deployed by the US in the strongest possible terms.\"See paragraph 54 of the judgement of the High Court:We make no secret of the fact that we view with a degree ofdistaste the way in which the American authorities are alleged tohave approached the plea bargain negotiations. Viewed from theperspective of an English court the notion that a prosecutor mayseek to induce a plea of guilty on the basis that substantialbenefits will be withdrawn if one is not forthcoming is anathema.We refer on particular to the providing and withdrawal ofsupport towards repatriation. [Paragraph 54 of the judgement]\"We regret that the Court has not expressed its clear disapproval of the U.S.Government's arbitrary interference with due process by halting GaryMcKinnon's extradition as an abuse of the process of the English courts.\"In order to coerce his voluntary surrender, Mr. McKinnon was subjected tothreats by the U.S. authorities during the course of plea bargain negotiations.The U.S. sought to coerce the appellant into consenting to his extraditionwithout a formal request being made to the UK authorities and thereafterpleading guilty in the U.S. The threats made included relaying to MrMcKinnon that New Jersey prosecutors expressed the intention to see Mr.McKinnon 'fry.'\"The evidence of Mr. Dratel is that this is a reference to capital punishment bythe electric chair. This was a chilling and intimidating threat. Further the USthreatened that Mr. McKinnon would receive a significantly anddisproportionately longer sentence if he refused to cooperate with the dealbeing tabled. Furthermore, it was made clear that the appellant would beforced to serve the entirety of that sentence in the U.S., with no prospect ofrepatriation. The U.S. authorities stated that the appellant's refusal tocooperate would result in his repatriation to the UK being blocked.\"In the course of these discussions the U.S. made it clear that it would belooking for an extremely lengthy sentence and that it would not allow Mr.McKinnon to be tried in England because the English courts' sentencingpowers was not of sufficient severity. It is submitted that this does notconstitute a valid reason for extraditing a British citizen from his homelandwhere he has never visited the US and the conduct alleged took place in theUK. It is submitted that a desire to make an example out of the appellant byensuring that he receives a much longer sentence than his own courts wouldconsider to be adequate punishment constitutes an improper and vexatiousmotive for making an extradition request.\"Mr. McKinnon complains that the conduct of the U.S., the threats it made tothe the appellant and its motive for requesting his extradition was eachoppressive and abusive, engaging the appellant's article 594) right. further, theappellant submits that the bid by the U.S. to ensure that their tacticaldeployment of coercive plea bargaining in this case would remain a secretfrom the court itself demonstrates that such an extra-judicial process shouldhave no part to play in the legal process. There is express statutory provisionfor a defendant to consent to extradition if he chooses to do so. No one shouldbe punished for exercising his statutory right to contest extradition. in USA vCobb."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"52. By placing undue pressure on Canadian citizens to foregodue legal process in Canada, the foreign State has disentitleditself from pursuing its recourse before the courts andattempting to show why extradition should legally proceed....53. [The judge] was also correct in concluding as he did thatthis was one of the clearest cases where to proceed further withthe extradition hearing would violate \"those fundamentalprinciples of justice which underlie the community's sense offair play and decency\" (Keyowski, supra, at pp.658 59)...\"It is submitted that the U.S. placed undue pressure on Mr. McKinnon andmade clear its intent to punish him for failing to succumb to that pressure. It isadmitted that the conduct of the U.S. in this case can be properlycharacterized as oppressive and vexatious such that the House of Lordsshould allow Mr. McKinnon's appeal.\"Furthermore the appellant contends that the US threat to impose anextremely lengthy sentence as punishment for not cooperating with aninherently coercive plea bargain amounts to a flagrant denial of justice suchthat his article 6 fair trial rights would be violated and that the severity of theconsequences in terms of sentence reach the high standard imposed in Soeringv. U.K. [1989] 11 EHRR 439. It should be noted that these threats wererelayed and terms of the \"bargain\" were offered by Ed Gibson, the assistantlegal attaché of the U.S. Embassy in London.\"Special Agent Ed Gibson has since retired from the FBI and is now the 'chiefsecurity adviser for Microsoft Ltd' in the United Kingdom. And therefore thethreats derived from the Requesting State itself as well as the prosecutionlawyers. The prosecution plays an enhanced role in the US sentencing processby recommending the length of sentence to the court. The role and influenceof the prosecution is therefore of great significance in respect of the sentenceultimately passed.\"The threat to refuse the the appellant repatriation clearly engages article 8ECHR. Article 8 cannot be lawfully interfered with in an arbitrary andpunitive fashion as promised by the U.S. Mr. McKinnon has a right under theConvention of the Transfer of Sentenced Persons not to have his eligibility forrepatriation determined unfairly or arbitrarily. He has a right to have hisapplication considered fairly. The U.S. has made plain its intention to preventhis repatriation on arbitrary grounds, namely to punish him for exercising hisstatutory rights to contest extradition. This constitutes an invalid and improperreason for preventing a fair determination of the merits of his application andwould therefore violate article 8.\"The U.S. originally attempted to coerce Mr. McKinnon into pleading Guiltyby offering him 6 months (12 months at worst) in a US prison and theremainder of a short sentence would be served in the UK, mostly on parole.The U.S. now intends to prosecute Mr. McKinnon as a cyber-terrorist, whichcould lead to him spending the rest of his life in prison in the U.S. withrepatriation to serve his sentence in his home country denied as punishmentfor contesting his extradition.\"Mr. McKinnon will now be punished for exercising his statutory rights tocontest extradition under the Extradition Act. His punishment could not bemore severe. It amounts to a life sentence in a foreign country.\"Website:Free Gary McKinnon: http://freegary.org.uk/ Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expressly"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"prohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
