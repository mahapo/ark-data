The hour and nineteen minute hypnosissession at the Briese home in Tappen with Evan (E) was conducted on September 16,2006, by Craig R. Lang, Certified Hypnotherapist from Brooklyn Center, Minnesota (H).In addition to the Briese family, others in attendance were Richard Moss and LornaHunter of Minnesota MUFON (Mutual UFO Network). After a long relaxation process,Mr. Lang took Evan back to the time after midnight on September 11, 2006, when hewoke up and the events unfolded.\"E: I’ve got to go to the bathroom and I have a dry throat.H: Let’s continue. What’s happening next?E: I’m getting out of bed. I’m grabbing onto the bars of the top bunk and pullmyself out. I’m getting up and walking downstairs to the sink and reach for aglass and grab one and look out the window. I see something, a couple ofthings run into the corral. They are moving fast.H: I want to pause for a moment here. When I touch you on the shoulder,that means like hitting a pause button on a video. You’re looking out the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"window. Please continue, what is happening next?E: I see a couple of things go into the corral. I’m wondering what they are? Maybe deer coming to feed again? I’m going to put on my shoes. I’ve gotboth of them on. I’m grabbing my jacket, throwing that on and walking to thedoor. I open up the door and go outside and walk into the shop door. I’mgrabbing my gun. I pick it up and open it up to see if there is anything (shots)in it.H: How do you feel grabbing your gun?E: It’s nothing.H: It’s just something you normally do?E: Yes. I open it up to see if there are any cartridges there. There’s none, so Igrab four or five and shove them into my pocket and I slide one in (the gun)and now I’m closing it. I’m walking up to the corral. Can hear a pig. I wonderwhat’s going on? H: OK, please continue.E: Leaning against the windbreak (metal sheeting walls) and I’m lookingaround the corner. There’s about four things standing in there. There’s two inthe back – no, there’s three in the back. And one’s dragging the pig. The otherone’s helping him. They are dragging it. The other two grab it.I’m jumping over the edge of the pen right now.H: How do you feel as you are jumping over?E: Mad.H: OK, please continue.E: I’m pulling out my gun and cocking back the hammer and shot one in theside. It hurt him. He’s limping around now. Something reaches up from behindme, grabs me, going down.H: You’re going down? OK, please continue. How do you feel?E: I’m getting back up and don’t feel anything. Getting back up and there’snothing there. There’s a hole in the windbreak (two panels knocked down).I’m opening up the gun right now to reload. Pull out the empty shell. I slideanother one in. Now I’m thinking I’m going to go to Trista’s and Billy’s housebecause they are closest. I’m going out of the pen and I’m running down tothe trees to see if I can see anything. There’s nothing. I’m going up Trista’ssteps and opening up the door. Billy’s on the couch. Trista’s sitting in a chairand (name) is sitting on the floor. They are all in shock. Trista is yelling at me,‘What’s going on?’H: Shock?E: Because I said, ‘They took her! They took her!’ She (Trista) asked whotook her and I said, ‘They took her!’ My shirt is all torn.(32:15) - Second return to beginning in bedH: I’m going to pause you here and let’s go back to the beginning again. Goback to the beginning when you are still asleep in your bed and add anyadditional detail that comes to mind. You can feel yourself going even deeperinto the daydream state. Let’s go back to the beginning of the event again andadd any additional detail that comes to mind. What’s happening now?E: I’m in bed, grabbing onto the bars to pull myself out. I’m going on thefloor and going down the stairs, opening up the door and go to the sink. I’mlooking around for a glass and I grab a glass on the front of the window and acouple of things are running into the corral. I’m wondering what they are?Probably deer stealing my feed. I’ve got to get my shoes. Got my shoes on. Igrab my jacket and am heading out the door and go out the door, go off thesteps and go out to the shop. Open the door, walk in, grab my gun, open herup to see if there is anything in it. I get four or five shells and slide one in andwalk out the door. I’m walking and I hear the pigs rustling. I’m running, I’mrunning."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"H: Please continue.E: I’m against the windbreak. I’m looking around the corner and there arefour, black, tall, skinny things standing in there. Two of them are dragging mypig to the other two. She is lifeless. They are working at it. I jump around theedge of the pen and I fire a shot at the one. It hurts and he’s limping around.Now something is reaching up from behind me and throws me down.H: Pause there for a moment. Something reaches up and throws you down?What’s happening when you’re thrown down?E: I can’t see it. They came up from behind me. I can feel its arm comearound me.H: Imagine you can just put that into slow motion and tell me what’shappening, frame-by-frame, as if you are watching a movie slowed down on aVCR or something like that. Imagine you can play it frame-by-frame andwhat’s the next thing that’s happening?E: Hitting the ground. I don’t remember after that.H: You can allow yourself if you want, just allow that daydream state toremember, as if it were a camera observing, just allowing that daydream stateas if it were a camera observing. Tell me what the very next thing is that’shappening on the ground.E: Getting back up. And I see my gun lying beside me, so I grab it and openit up and pull the shell out. I put a new one (shell) in.H: I’m going to pause you right here. You are holding the gun, or you see itbeside you and you grab it. I’m going to invite you to back up just a little bitand see what happened just before that, like you can go one frame in reversein the movie, just before that and tell me what’s happening.E: I’m lying down on the ground looking up around to see if there’s anythingelse out there. There’s nothing.H: How do you feel at this point?E: Fear.H: Fear? Can you tell me more about that fear?E: Fear that they brought more of them (non-human entities).H: OK, just allow yourself to relax there for a moment, allow yourself to belying there for a moment. Just imagine you can move the movie back onemore frame and tell me what’s happening.E: They are all staring at me in fear. They are scared of me.H: Where are you right now?E: Standing in front of them looking at them. They are kind of telling me thatthey don’t want anything to do with me. (long pause)H: Allow the movie to back up one more frame and tell me what’s happening.E: One’s limping around because I shot him. He’s holding its side.H: What else do you notice?E: The other ones are standing looking at me in fear, still. They are staringback because they don’t want to – they are not here to fight with me.H: What language are they speaking?E: They are not speaking – body language kind of. They are kind of bowing.H: What did their voices sound like?E: They don’t really have a voice. They don’t have a voice. They are justkind of bowing at me. Kind of kneeling.[ Editor's Note: About the above reference to \"bowing at me."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Kind of kneeling.\" In July 1984, I was investigating a humanabduction case that occurred the week before Thanksgiving 1980.A husband and wife had been driving north of Denver, Colorado,when suddenly a \"cerulean blue light\" surrounded them in theircar and they lost about an hour of time. In separate hypnosissessions with social scientist, hypnotherapist and UFO researcher,Richard Sigismund, each told what happened aboard anegg-shaped craft in which there was one very tall, \"handsome\"being in a sparkling blue garment. There was at least one othershorter grey entity that neither man nor woman liked. The wifealso saw many red-hooded, smaller figures. After a vaginal andbreast exam by \"metal-like tentacles,\" the woman was furiousand screaming obscenities at the non-humans.Later in a discussion after hypnosis, the wife said that the tallbeing \"perceived my anger and said, 'We didn't mean to hurt you... something like it was for a good purpose.' And I said, 'Nobodyasked me,' and something about 'means don't necessarily justifythe end.' And he said, 'Perhaps.'\" Then she thought the tall beingtook her into a room where \"these people all have their headsbowed at me. And I'm thinking, 'He's trying to make me feel goodand I'm not necessarily going to buy it.'\" For more about theColorado abduction story and several color drawings, see mybook, An Alien Harvest © 1989 in the Earthfiles Shop. ]H: Let’s back up just another frame. Allow the movie to play just one moreframe earlier and tell me what’s happening.E: Running to the spot where I’m going to fire from. One is holding my pig –the two are holding my pig. I can see them dragging her.H: What’s happening next?E: I’m running up and I pull up the gun with my hand and point it at the onethat’s closest to me that is dragging the pig with the other one. I fire a shot intoits side.H: Please continue. What’s happening next?E: The other three that aren’t hurt are kneeling to me.H: What happened next? Just allow it to go in slow motion.E: Something puts its arm around me. Coming around my right side. Now it’sgrabbing me by the shirt. And it’s pulling up and it’s tripping me. It’s holdingon to my shirt the whole way down. And at the end (of fingers), they are bigand sharp.H: Can you see the hand?E: Yeah.H: What do they look like?E: Long fingers.H: Are there five fingers?E: Yeah.

And they’vegot like spikes on them.H: I’m going to invite you to fix that image of the hand and fix that image ofthe being in your mind and later on you can sketch them. Just imagine likethere is a camera in your mind and it can snap a picture just now, click! And itsnaps a picture. Later on, I can ask – even when you come out of trance – canask that camera to draw the picture. Do you think you can do that?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"E: Yes.H: Great, snap a picture of the being and snap a picture of the hand and justClick! Click! You can re-draw them later.

I’m grabbing my gun.H: I’m going to pause you here again and imagine you can step back into thatspace between the time that you fall and the time you are getting up.

I’m putting a new onein. I’m closing it and pulling the hammer back. Now I’m thinking of going toTrista’s because it’s the closest house. So, I’m running over the pen, throughthe trees, and I don’t see anything. But I’m still looking. I’m going to Trista’shouse and I’m going up the steps. Open up the door.
