It was Lucy who emailed me onAugust 18, to say that some were dismissing the Woodborough pattern as manmade workfor an unspecified \"commercial purpose.\"Late last night on August 20, 2007, Lucy received an anonymous email which she copiedfor me to share with Earthfiles viewers, as shown below. According to this anonymousemailer, the Woodborough formation was discovered at 4 PM on Tuesday, August 14,2007, after hard rain and shocked musicians working on a music video in the nearbyCarson farm owner's barn. If this email is correct, it means the money paid to the farmerwas for the music video crew to work at Woodborough Hill and the musicians had nothingto do with the appearance of the wheat formation by 4 PM on August 14, 2007, afterheavy rain had stopped.From: LucyPringle, Hampshire, EnglandSubject: Fwd: Web site responseDate: August 21, 2007To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com\"message: I know about this - it's true this formation was used forcommercial purposes, but I don't think it was made for commercialpurposes.

Now, the plan was to make their owndesign on Monday 13th but the weather was too bad for their 'artdepartment' to work. They turned up on Tuesday 14th and filmed allday inside a nearby barn. The rain eventually stopped at 4 pm andthey went outside to film in the field, only to discover that theformation had appeared in the field sometime between then and thesite visit from their art department the previous day.It was only when they went up in a cherry picker to get some aerialviews of the band that they saw the crop design in all its glory for thefirst time. They genuinely had no idea how this had happened.I know this because I met them that night in a pub in Amesbury - theGeorge - and they all seemed pretty freaked out by it. Can'tremember the name of the band, but they're Australian and they havea concert in London sometime this week.name: Anonsubject: Woodborough Hill, August 17th\" Please also see: Earthfiles081707More Information:If viewers have more information about other crop formations in your area, please emailme at earthfiles@earthfiles.comFor further reports about crop formations, please see reports below in the EarthfilesArchive and my book Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles in the Earthfiles Shop:• 07/27/2007 — Part 1: 1,033-Foot-Long East Field Wheat Formation \"Happened Within 90 Minutes.\"• 07/27/2007 — Part 2: Military Helicopters Over East Field Wheat Formation• 07/23/2007 — 070707 East Field Wheat Formation: Viewer Comments• 07/07/2007 — Swiss Army Pilot Discovers \"Perfect Geometric Figure\" and U.K.'s East Field Gets Circles!• 06/29/2007 — Another \"Drone\" This Week Near Maxwell AFB• 06/18/2007 — Crop Circles On Rings and Three Mysterious Aerial Lights in Slovenia• 06/06/2007 — Part 2: Yatesbury, England and Madisonville, Tennessee - A Mayan Link?• 06/05/2007 -- Part 2: U.
