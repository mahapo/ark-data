Out of print.Return to Part 1November 25, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Alien Medical InstrumentsOne Alien object described on one of the reports discovered during theKorean War was a rectangular device with smooth, rounded edges.[ Editor's Note: Korean War hostilities occurred from June 27,1950, to July 27, 1953. However, the war period was extended toJanuary 31, 1955, by Congress to define a period of benefiteligibility in the wake of uneasy peace negotiations after July 27,1953.]It was 1 inch wide by 2 inches long and was 1/2 inch thick. The color wassapphire and so smooth it was slippery and extremely difficult to hold on to. Itwas also very beautiful. It looked like a large precious stone and definitelyrivaled anything that could be bought at the most prestigious jewelryboutiques on New York's Fifth Avenue."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"When this item was placed on a living body, it detected tumors, bothmalignant and benign. Once the tumor was detected, the Alien objectprojected an image of the tumor on its screen-like surface. The projectedimage was so clear that it was like looking at the tumor itself. The objectglided over the skin of the body without making contact. If tumors did notreside in the body, the object remained stationary and a cryptic messageappeared on its surface. The object did not need to scan over the entire bodyto locate a tumor. The Alien device knew instantly where the tumor or tumorswere as soon as the object touched the skin. If a tumor was detected, itlevitated and moved to the tumor. When more than one tumor was present inthe body, the alien device identified the one it was close to and then moved onto the next closest one and presumably catalogued it, too.Size of the tumor had no bearing on the order that it would be identified. Thescientists believed that the scanner was mapping the location of each tumorand all pertinent information about the tumor and storing that informationsomewhere. But they never discovered how or where the information wasstored, whether it was stored within the object itself or if it transmitted theinformation back to the Alien craft.Every tumor that was displayed on the surface of that object wasaccompanied by Alien symbols, presumably identifying what type of tumor itwas and where on the body it was located.Another object on the report was something that looked like a cheese cutter. Ithad a 4-inch long tubular handle and a flat area like that of a spatula with a slitin the middle of it. The object was molded from the same stuff as the otheritem, but its color was ruby red. The flat part of the item was less than1-inch-wide, the length was 1.5 inches and the thickness was less than that ofa double-edged razor blade. That Alien device effortlessly removed skin fromone part of the body and miraculously grafted it to another part of the body.No sutures are required to hold the skin in place. As soon as the skin isapplied, the wound completely healed itself in less than five minutes. Theinstrument accelerated the healing process at the injury site as it fused thegrafted skin to the wound. The condition of the person receiving the skin didnot affect the healing process of the grafted area, even if there were lesions orother wounds that did not heal due to some underlying illness such as canceror diabetes.The scientists were able to graft skin from one person on to another with thesame rate of success. Skin color likewise did not matter. Skin from Blacks,Caucasians and Asians were all intermingled with the same astonishing results.The receiving body never rejected the grafted skin. The skin from the donorassumes the color and matrix of that of the recipient at the same rate that ithealed.What is brilliant about all these medical devices was that any lay person coulduse them. The instruments are \"fail proof.\" Their respective functions neverwavered in performance, regardless of who wielded them. The devices did thejob to perfection every time. Yet, accidents did happen like the scientist wholost his eye. These were caused by not knowing the function of a device. Oncethe function was known, no other skill is required.Many of the mistakes and injuries that occurred early in the program wereactually due to the expertise of the doctors and scientists, not the lack of it.Many times, the doctors tried to assist or force the instruments to perform inways they thought they should perform. Often, there were fatal consequences.There are markings on some of the instruments, but probably the markingshad no more significance than the markings on our own earthly tools andutensils. We don't need written instructions on our knives and forks,screwdrivers and hammers. The culture we live in teaches us what we need toknow without having to be redundant.One of the most bizarre instruments discovered by the team was a triangular-shaped object about the size of a quarter (25-cent coin). When the item wasplaced on a person's head, it instantly embedded itself in the skull, renderedthe person unconscious, then lifted that person up head first and vanished withthe body.At first, those performing the experiment assumed that the body wastransported back to the ship. This was before the advent of \"Star Trek,\" sonone of them were familiar with the famous words, \"Beam me up, Scotty.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"This experiment was one that was done in Korea. The Alien craft was kept inJapan, so they flew back to Japan from Korea to see if the person was in theAlien ship. The scientists presumed that like all the other Alien objectsconnected with the ship that maybe the person (if he were still alive) and theobject that attached to him would be found back on board the ship. But thebody was not.However, three days later, the triangular device was back on the craft. Theperson or his body was never found. The prevailing theory of what might havehappened to him was that he was transported to some other Alien ship inEarth's orbit or possibly to the interior of our planet, where it was suspectedby one of the psychics that the Aliens had an outpost.A second psychic stated that the body or person was carried into the sun to bedestroyed, for reasons he could not understand or explain to the committeemembers. Like al the experiments that have been carried out using the Alienobjects, the triangular instrument only worked on live humans.One other theory that came from the research team who studied that lasttriangular medical device was that the soul of a human had something to dowith the activation of that Alien instrument. This theory was supported byanother team when they had discovered in the course of their experimentsthat all who lost brain activity during an experiment, also lost the function ofthe Alien instrument that was performing a procedure on a person. Even whenthe man was kept alive artificially or on his own, the lack of brain wavesrendered the devices useless. In every situation, the Alien devices stoppedworking the moment the brain waves stopped. It appeared that the Aliens hadjurisdiction over humans only when there was life involved.*****Chapter 4What are the Aliens up to?It was painfully obvious to the committee that the Aliens are capable of doingwhatever they desired to do. So, what are the Aliens up to?Some of the questions that were tossed around by committee members were:- \"How many Aliens are on Earth? Dozens? Hundreds?Thousands?\"- \"Did the Aliens want humans to participate by letting us haveone of their aerial vehicles full of supernatural instruments?\"- \"Why are the Aliens being so secretive and not making somekind of formal contact with Earthlings?\"- \"Did the Aliens stage the Alien shipwreck?\"- \"Was is a means of introducing their infinitely superior race toour own fragile one?\"- \"Is this a way for the Aliens to let us know that we humanscould not survive a full frontal encounter with them?\"- \"Or, are they sowing the seeds of our destruction?\"If the U. S. government is keeping the Alien project under tight raps, are thereother similar Alien projects going on simultaneously? If so, how many?As fragments of the puzzle came together, the committee inferred from theAlien gadgets that the Aliens had a definite interest in the human anatomy.Since many of the instruments had beneficial features to them, were theAliens a kind of behind-the-scenes paramedic unit? If so, why are theyselective? Thousands of people die every day of accidents and diseases thatcould easily be treated with the Alien gadgets that the scientists had.For a period of a few months, the committee switched gears and spent moretime brainstorming about what was the purpose of the intruders and focusedless on the instrument themselves. The scientists enlisted the air of moreclairvoyants and had them concentrate solely on making contact withextraterrestrials."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"This committee had lost touch with the captured Aliens six months after theoriginal discovery of them. At the time, the scientists did not care. They hadplenty on their hands with the Alien craft and all its cargo. But during the late1960s and early 1970s, the scientists needed to understand the connectionbetween the two: craft and Aliens.Sure, the Aliens had some fantastic stuff, but why did they have this stuff?The committee was denied access to the Aliens and was not allowed to knowtheir location or if the Aliens in the crash were still alive. So, the scientists hadto find their own Aliens. They tried using the clairvoyants in groups of three tosee if the psychics could concentrate and direct their power. That failed andthe clairvoyants were split up to let each work individually. Of the six, onewas predicting with a 64% accuracy on where an Alien sighting would occur.The rest of the psychics missed every time.Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, members of the committee crisscrossed theUnited States, part of Europe and areas in South America. The scientists nevermade contact, but they had many successful sightings. The committeephotographed the Alien ships and chased them with fighter jets and choppers.If the terrain allowed and there were no civilians in the vicinity, the committeetried to shoot the Alien craft down. But they never came close to hitting oneand none of the scientists thought they ever would. Their intentions werestrictly to see if the Aliens would respond, acknowledge the humans in someway by blinking their craft lights or zapping the human aircraft with aray-beam? Something! \"Humor us\" was the cry of one frustrated committeemember.After two disappointing decades of seeing UFOs without making any actualcontact, the committee decided to change their approach and focus on\"what?\" or \"who?\" the Aliens were visiting on Earth. The committee membersread the papers and the tabloids, so they were aware of all the stories of Alienabductions. The scientists even interviewed some of the more prominentabductees, but came away with no answers.Even though the committee was part of a secret government agency withvirtually unlimited resources, not to mention high level contacts, they had thesame difficulty as everyone else when they tried to get classified informationabout other projects or other committees who might have more knowledgeabout UFOs. The committee knew there had to be at least one other secretcommittee, but the consensus among them was that there were four: one foreach of the four departments of the military.This committee was financed through the department of the U. S. Air Force.Everyone who has worked in government knows there can be no favoritism ofone branch of government over another by the Congress of the United States.That's doubly true for the Pentagon. If one department of the military has asecret government committee, then all of them will have one or two or maybedozens. Are Aliens abducting humans?The committee did not want to get involved with those who claimed to havebeen abducted by Aliens. The scientists were hoping that if there were anotherdepartment involved that their information could be shared with theircommittee. Because the committee was not able to breach those hiddenbarriers, the scientists had to do their own investigations.They avoided anyone who claimed to have had a UFO encounter, eventhough the scientists knew that some were telling the truth. The committeeknew that the information they obtained from researching the Alien thingswas due more to the generosity of the Aliens themselves than it was fromanything that the committee scientists were doing. Still, there were nofreebies. The committee had to go the extra distance and then some for everymorsel of information they were allowed to acquire.Detecting UFOs was much easier than finding out what the Aliens were up to.Locating a UFO was just a matter of coordinating their best psychic with theirground and air teams. Once the psychic pinpointed an area where he felt aUFO might be, the ground team scoured that location. When the scientistsdetected the UFO, they sent a specially equipped airplane that carried amultitude of radar and other sophisticated tracking devices to that site. Afterthe Alien craft was located and locked onto, the scientists kept their distance"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"and observed the craft with their tracking devices.The U.S. Air Force surveillance plane kept an eye on the Alien craft from adistance of several miles and transmitted pertinent information to the groundvehicle. The USAF never used more than two ordinary cars, which remainedincognito throughout the surveillance.The USAF and committee knew they were not fooling the Aliens. Thegovernment entities were more concerned with tipping off ordinary citizens -and particularly UFO buffs who regularly showed up at many of the sameplaces that the committee did.
