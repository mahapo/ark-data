Yes.A former trainer of the U. S. Army’s remote viewing Psi Spies unitwas in New York on the morning of 9/11. Needless to say, he was quite upsetwith what had happened. He told me personally that he contacted people deepwithin the government and told them, ‘You give me the word and I will locateOsama bin Laden.’ And he was told, ‘No, no, no, don’t do that. We don’t want that.’” - Jim Marrs, Author, Psi Spies © 2007. Click for podcast.Psi Spies: The True Story of America's PsychicWarfare Program © 2007 by Jim Marrs.September 14, 2007 Wise County, Texas - Jim Marrs was born and raised in Fort Worth,Texas. Jim has been tracking down facts and trying to make sense of political stories inAmerica since his college days as a journalism major at the University of North Texas inDenton. He graduated in 1966 and began a newspaper reporting and editing career first atthe Denton Record Chronicle and then Lubbock Avalanche Journal. Later at theFortworth-Star Telegram, he was an investigative reporter and cartoonist, and earnedphotography awards.By 1988, he decided that he had to put his big file about President John F. Kennedy'sassassination into a book. The result was an instant classic called Crossfire. Two monthsafter its release in 1989, Jim received a call from Hollywood film director, Oliver Stone,who wanted to option Crossfire for the movie that became JFK.Jim Marrs began asking book editors and others what each thought was the next big, dark,secret government cover-up beyond the JFK assassination. Unanimously, he says, theanswer was UFOs. As Jim began to nose around for more UFO information, he stumbledonto the government's efforts to produce \"psychic spies\" who could remote view anywherein the world - in the skies, underwater and even on Mars and Jupiter - and return with factsbeyond the field intel of normal agents trudging through streets, alleys, fields, agencies andcorporations. I remember the depressed telephone call I received from Jim after he thoughthis \"psi spies\" manuscript had been accepted for publication and then was cancelled formysterious reasons. As a celebrated and successful author, Jim suspected a deliberategovernment block to keep his reporting about the remote viewing \"enigma files\" aboutUFOs away from the public and media.Frustrated by the block, but determined to keep going, Jim completed his second book,The Alien Agenda, which was successfully published in 1997. Alien Agenda raised thequestion: Who would speak for Earth if non-humans finally arrived in public?Trying to answer that question lead Jim to write Rule By Secrecy published in 2000. In thatimportant book, Jim Marrs made links between the money-power elite of America with the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"money-power elite of Europe, with all linked back to the money-power elite ofMesopotamia, which might have been under the control and manipulation of non-humanentities with their own agendas on this planet. By then, Jim realized he had produced hisown unplanned \"trilogy\" about government secrecy, cover-up, manipulation and control.The next year, the Trade Towers in New York City, and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., were attacked. After 9/11, the world has never been the same and the horror of it allprovoked Jim to ask questions about who exactly was behind the September 11, 2001,attacks and why the government prefers to keep remote viewing secret.Interview: Jim Marrs.Jim Marrs, Investigative Journalist and Author, Crossfire © 1989; The Alien Agenda© 1997; Rule By Secrecy © 2000; The War On Freedom © 2003, retitled 9/11 InsideJob © 2004 and re-published as The Terror Conspiracy © 2006; and Psi Spies: TheTrue Story of America's Psychic Warfare Program © 2007, Wise Town, Texas: \"And Ijumped on top of 9/11 and produced a book called, The War On Freedom © 2003 whichagain was mysteriously cancelled. And yet I was paid all of the advance. It’s like, ‘Takethe money and go away. We don’t want to hear about this.’That book was eventually published as Inside Job © 2004 and then that was picked up byanother publisher and published as the book that is currently available, The TerrorConspiracy © 2006.You can see how it all kind of flows together.AND COMES UP AND CULMINATES SO FAR WITH PSI SPIES © 2007.Right. Finally getting the word out about remote viewing. And I’ll give you a scoop. I havea book in now to Harper Collins and if it doesn’t go the way of suppression andcensorship, it will be out next year (2008) and we won’t go into this one, but my workingtitle is: The Rise of the Fourth Reich.IN THIS COUNTRY, I’M ASSUMING?Ye s .AND ITS ASSOCIATION WITH THE HISTORIC NAZI PAST.That’s right. I’ve heard all the way back to the 1960s and the hippies that were talkingabout the fascism and ‘Amerika’ with a ‘k.’ I used to think that was just radical rhetoric.But when I did the research, I find the very same people, companies, corporations thatwere behind Hitler are now running this country.JIM, I THINK IT’S FAIR TO SAY THAT HITLER HAD AN OBSESSION WITH ABLUE-EYED, BLOND-HAIRED SUPER RACE.Ye s .AND BRITISH INTELLIGENCE REPORTED SILVER DISCS RISING UP OUT OFPENEMUNDE, GERMANY, FROM THE 1920S ONWARD. THAT FUELS THEQUESTION: WAS HITLER IN ASSOCIATION WITH SOME NON-HUMAN GROUPTHAT HAD ADVANCED NON-HUMAN TECHNOLOGY?Well, I actually address that. And here’s some information you might not be aware of.Beginning in the 1920s, and we all know from books and movies the connection betweenthe Nazis and occult practices. They were heavily involved in the occult."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Nazi Germany Had \"MAJIK\" Advanced Technology GroupU. S. Has \"MAJIC\"Of course, we know any science that is not clearly understood can be assumed to be magicor occultism. But during the 1930s and through the wars, within the German military wasan umbrella organization simply known as ‘Dr. Greenbaum,’ or ‘Dr. Greentree.’ That wasapparently a reference to the Tree of Knowledge in the Garden of Eden. And within this‘Dr. Greenbaum’ was a group known as ‘MAJIK.’ Apparently MAJIK had to do withadvanced propulsion technology and I can’t help but wonder if that was brought over here(after WWII) and was the genesis for our Majestic 12, or MAJIC 12, as it was originallycalled. That’s the group in the United States that has been in charge of sequestering andkeeping control over UFO technology, but also under Dr. Greenbaum was psychic studies.In my new book, Psi Spies, I was trying to deal strictly with the U. S. Army’s functionaland operational group of military intelligence officers who were trained in themethodology of remote viewing. Remote viewing is not necessarily psychic ability. We allhave psychic ability. Remote viewing was an attempt to control and bring on the psychicability on demand through a structured series of protocols.Basically what it did, Linda, was to allow the very psychic right hemisphere of the brain tocommunicate with the not-at-all-psychic left hemisphere of the brain. CIA's SCANATE Remote Viewing ProgramCOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE TRANSITION FROM THE STANFORD RESEARCHINSTITUTE WITH HAL PUTHOFF, RUSSELL TARG AND INGO SWANN TO APROGRAM CALLED ‘SCANATE’ THAT WAS UNDER THE CIA?Let’s go back to about 1970, when a book was published called Psychic DiscoveriesBehind the Iron Curtain © 1970 by Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schroeder. It achievedsome level of popularity, but it particularly rang alarm bells in the halls of Langley,Virginia (CIA) and in the halls of the Pentagon. Now, the attitude there was, ‘We don’tbelieve in this stuff. But, if the Commies are doing it, by God, we’ve got to do it to!’So, they began to throw some money at psychic research simply as a reaction to studiesthat were being done behind the Iron Curtain.SCANATE was simply an acronym for Scanning By Coordinate. They still use the term,‘coordinates.’ But then it was actually latitude and longitude for coordinates and they(CIA) would pick a random set of coordinates, have a viewer say, ‘What is at thislocation?’ For example, if the coordinates were for the North Pole and the viewer says, ‘Isee all white and it’s cold and the wind is blowing and I see a bear and it’s white.’ Thenthey knew he was on target.But they moved away from that fairly rapidly. They still use coordinates. In fact, there is aprotocol called ‘Coordinate Remote Viewing.’ But the coordinate is not a true coordinate.It’s simply a set of numbers representing the target. The problem is that if I want you toremote view the Eiffel Tower – if I tell you to go remote view the Eiffel Tower, you’veautomatically got a picture in your head of the Eiffel Tower because you’ve seen pictures,films or you’ve been there. So, you can’t frontload the viewer. That’s why they are givensimply a set of numbers that represent the target. Then since at some point whoever wrotethose numbers down knows what the target is, then psychically they are able to pick upfrom those target numbers the target. And if they are good and practiced, they can actuallygo right to that target.So, from there, they did all the experimentation out at Stanford Research Institute and itwas repetitive, testing over and over again. Remote viewing has been termed the mostseverely scientifically studied experiment in history. I think that could be true becausethere are literally hundreds of people involved and for a period of years, it was justunremitting test, test, test. What they did was on statistics, if nothing else, prove that yes,something was going on and statistically it went way above the law of averages onguessing. CIA Handed Over Remote Viewing to U. S. Army"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"So, at this point, the CIA which was already beginning to get into trouble because ofassassination plots and drug running and a few other things, decided they better get rid ofanything that could cause them a public relations problem and the U. S. Army was standingthere ready to take over.So, the Army moved remote viewing into their Intelligence and Security Command out ofFort Meade, Maryland, and that is where the original unit, which went through a variety ofcode names: CENTER LANE, GRILL FLAME, STARGATE, SUN STREAK – and that’swhere the Army’s remote viewing unit started and this is where they were using remoteviewers operationally to go spy on potential enemies of the United States.THAT WAS IN THE 1980S?That would have moved up into the late 1970s and that persisted well up into the 1990s.By the early 1990s, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) had gotten involved and wasalso getting information. In fact, a lot of agencies and organizations came to getinformation from the Psi Spy unit, but according to them the big problem was that nobodywould ever take it seriously.When one of our CIA officers was kidnapped over in the Middle East, the remote viewerswere asked to find out where he was and they did find out where he was. But nothing wasdone about it because of the mindset of the people in control, which is you and I grew upin the 1950s to 1960s when there was space launches and the ‘woo woo’ of psychic stuffjust did not exist. It’s been a tough climb (for remote viewing) to get over that mindset.Although, recent advances in quantum mechanics and quantum physics tend to show usthat the entire universe is nothing but one big mass of energy of which we are all part.Obviously, if someone has a thought or if something exists in the universe, then it’s in thisuniversal energy grid. And if anyone is sensitive enough, psychic enough, intuitive, theycan access the universal grid. To me, that provides the framework for understanding howremote viewing works. Remote View Location of Osama Bin Laden?JIM, WE ARE NOW IN 2007 IN WHICH THE SUBJECT DRIVING THE ENTIREPLANET CRAZY IS TERRORISM. HAS IT BEEN APPLIED BY SOMEINTELLIGENCE GROUP TO FIND OSAMA BIN LADEN?Excellent question! First, let me preface my response, which I think is going to raise youreyebrows. Osama Bin Laden has been blamed by the U. S. government for being themastermind and instigator of the horrendous attacks on September 11, 2001, but Osamahas yet to be charged with anything! In fact, the FBI on his Wanted posters do not even list9/11 as one of the crimes they want him for.When I asked about that, an FBI spokesman said, ‘Well, frankly, we don’t have any hardevidence that he was behind 9/11.’ That is the absolute gospel truth! No charges have beenfiled against him. In fact, in mid-2002, not even a year before the first anniversary of 9/11at a press conference, President Bush was asked about Osama Bin Laden and he said, ‘Wehaven’t heard from him in awhile and frankly, I’m not that concerned about himanymore.’HAVE YOU TALKED WITH ANY PROFESSIONAL REMOTE VIEWERS WHO HAVETALKED WITH YOU OFF THE RECORD ABOUT LOOKING FOR OSAMA BINLADEN AND SAYING THIS IS WHERE HE IS?OK, can remote viewing locate Osama bin Laden? Yes. A former trainer of the U. S.Army’s remote viewing Psi Spies unit was in New York on the morning of 9/11. Needlessto say, he was quite upset with what had happened. He told me personally that hecontacted people deep within the government and told them, ‘You give me the word and Iwill locate Osama bin Laden.’ And he was told, ‘No, no, no, don’t do that. We don’t wantthat.’ THAT is what is going on.WHEN HE SAID, ‘WHY NOT?’ WHAT DID THE AUTHORITIES SAY?He didn’t ask them why not. He knew better. They don’t want bin Laden caught becausebin Laden is the boogey man they (government authorities) have to have to hold over ourheads to keep everybody fearful and divided and under tight control.I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT CONCLUSION, BUT I ASSUME THERE AREPROFESSIONAL REMOTE VIEWERS WHO HAVE TRIED TO REMOTE VIEWWHERE HE IS?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"You have to understand there is no cohesive remote viewing unit anymore. So there is notone group you can go to and say, ‘Go find him.’ It would be a variety of individuals. Now,whether they have individually gone out and tried to find Osama bin Laden, I’m not awareof that. Remote Viewing \"Enigma Files\"LET’S MOVE TO WHAT I THINK IS THE MOST FASCINATING PART OF YOURBOOK CALLED ‘THE ENIGMA FILES.’Right! I think the reason they had to suppress my book was because after laying a verycredible foundation for the science and history of remote viewing, I then went into theEnigma Files, which is that every single one of these military and government-trainedremote viewers, at one time or another, had direct, personal knowledge of UFOs. That’swhat the authorities could not allow to get out in a credible manner.Ingo Swann, Remote Viewer Ingo Swann.YES, INGO SWANN TOLD ME ABOUT HIS OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN THEPENTAGON OF DOING A REMOTE VIEWING TARGET THAT WAS ONLYLATITUDE AND LONGITUDE. WHEN HE BEGAN TO DRAW, IT WAS ASUBMARINE THAT HAD A DISC OVER OR TO THE SIDE OF THE SUBMARINE.Ye s .WHEN HE WAS ASKED BY THE MILITARY AUTHORITY SITTING ACROSS FROMHIM AT A DESK, ‘YOU CAN’T MEAN A UFO.’ AND INGO RESPONDED, ‘YES, IDO.’ AT THAT MOMENT, THE AUTHORITIES GATHERED UP THE PAPERS,PENCILS, EVERYBODY LEFT THE ROOM LEAVING INGO SITTING THERE BYHIMSELF.That’s right! And that was a good illustration of several things. Ingo was not tasked to gosee a UFO. He was tasked to go see a submarine. Yet, when he remote viewed thesubmarine, there was a UFO nearby, obviously his attention was drawn to the UFO. This iswhy each and every one of these Psi Spies had personal knowledge of the UFOs.I have been told, and I assume this is true, that they were never at any time tasked to golook at UFOs. Now, Linda, that only makes sense because how could the government,which for 60 years has tried to tell us that there is no such thing (as UFOs) and then ordertheir official remote viewers to go look at something that they (authorities) say does notexist?!But when they went out looking for other things – for example, if they were tasked to goand look in the upper atmosphere for high performance and high flying aircraft to see whatthe Russians or Chinese or somebody else might be testing, they would go up there (inatmosphere). They would see these things flitting through the atmosphere. The remoteviewers would take a mental look at them and this one remote viewer told me, ‘They werenot us and they were not the Russians. Those guys were not even from ourneighborhood.’”"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Click here for Amazon.com.Books are also available from your local bookstores.To be continued in Part 2: Alien underground bases and remote viewing Jupiter.More Information:For further reports about Jim Marrs, government cover-ups, non-human intelligence,technology and interactions with Earth life, please see reports below in the EarthfilesArchive and my four books: An Alien Harvest; the 2-volume Glimpses of OtherRealities; and Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles in the Earthfiles Shop:• 09/11/2007 — Part 4: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 09/07/2007 — Part 3: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 09/05/2007 — Part 2: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 08/31/2007 — Part 1: Betty and Barney Hill: Captured!• 08/31/2007 — Part 2: Betty and Barney Hill: Captured!• 08/30/2007 — Part 1: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 01/02/2007 — Grey Aerial Disk Reported by Chicago O'Hare United Airlines Pilots and Mechanics• 06/08/2006 — Part 2: Unexplained Phenomenon of Sudden Human-to-Reptile \"Replacement\"• 06/02/2006 — Part 1: Unexplained Phenomenon of Sudden Human-to-Reptile \"Replacement\"• 02/27/2006 — Part 4: Military Voices Reply About Government Interaction with UFOs• 04/14/2005 — \"Battle of Los Angeles\" On February 25, 1942: When America's 37th Coast Artillery BrigadeFired Off 1,430 Anti-Aircraft Shells At A UFO• 12/07/2004 — Part 2: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation?• 10/29/2004 — Part 1: Update On Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia, UFO Case.
