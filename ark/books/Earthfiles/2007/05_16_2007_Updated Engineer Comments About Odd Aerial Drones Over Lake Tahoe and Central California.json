I work on a MacG-5 and re-size images for Earthfiles formats. I downloaded the Chad imagesfrom the COAST website, which I understand were also re-sized there. So, theonly May 6, 2007, original images would be with Chad.

S. Navy and Honeywell Hardware Design Background\"I worked in communications for many years, and finished up a career atHoneywell in hardware design. I also worked with the Navy for a number ofyears (enlisted), and saw many things in the area of communications. Yourring-drone posted to the site was interesting on a few counts.Beyond aerodynamics (which I don't know much about other than to say this"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"is a strange design and appears that there is a front to this - the long probe thatis sectional, 3 pieces is my guess), I'll throw in my .02 as follows. Please notemy comments are limited to what I see primarily about the antenna and theelement array arrangement.The circular design of the body with the antenna bent in an almost'candle-like' fashion, combined with the 360 degree array, permit for apossible phased array with a directional sensing ability. This is due to thesignal being able to strike the antenna array from one direction and then backscattering across what would be the inside of the ring. From this, a differentialcan be made and direction calculated based in part on signal strength amongother things. It should be noted, too, that the angle of the bend on eachelement permits a nearly vertical aperture perspective, enabling higher flyingcraft (or lower flying, as the case may be) to be able to communicate with thisring-drone; a sort of look-down-look-up communicating ability with no loss ofsight. The bend also enables a variety of frequencies to be 'sniffed'; they arenot uniform in the sense of being a straight rod as we see commonly as in atelevision antenna. This is bent and bent for good reason. Without knowingthe diameter of the ring I can't guess accurately what the frequency rangewould be that this ring-drone would be designed to transceive. If I got it right,there are 14 elements, evenly spaced about the ring body, each beingapproximately 25.7 degrees apart. Length, spacing, forward element, rearelement, all come into play to figuring out the detail and without some senseof dimension I'd hesitate to offer anything. Once this is known, the operatingfrequency range can be more accurately known. No doubt it is millimeter.The body (ring-like) makes sense; lightweight, low drag, combined withenabling a circular, millimeter wave transceiver to be placed within the ring.The circle itself is the same principle applied to supercomputing as its half thedistance as compared to a buss type architecture.I'd also say that having worked on spacecraft for a number of years, the trickof keeping unintended interference down to an acceptable level is to place itfurther away from the noise source. So on our spacecraft - say Voyager, forexample, which is well known and has been seen many times, it has extendedarms for this function. One arm is for the nuclear power device; we don't wantthat next to the scientific instruments so they are kept at opposite ends orhidden behind the body or shielded as design permits. In this ring-drone, myguess would be the same thing is being applied; you see three sections of theextended 'front-arm,' as I called it, each with rod-like pins separating thesection. Each section appears to have one or more sensors, so the sameprinciple of Voyager may be being applied here. It would be quite easy to runfiber optic down the rods separating the sections. The long arm itself probablyhouses the navigational aid would also be my guess as it would be the'bow-wave' sensor for this ring-drone. So to be clear, the power source itself isprobably incorporated into the ring body itself, with the sensors out- board,the most sensitive being the furthest from the ring body.Does it rotate? How large is it (dimension)? It would be interesting to knowrotational rate, as that too, combined with the length of the arms (or blades asthey might be), would also be instrumental in determining speed.\"2) Nanotechnology Background\"The design strategy of charged ion / shaped plasma 'buoyancy' devices doesbear some relevancy here. For instance, the circular array of curved 'antennae'coming out of the center of the device is very similar to a form of wave guide/ shaping mechanism for a charged plasma / ion field.The very long extended arm could in fact be the power source - the othershort arms serve as counter-balance / stability mechanisms"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"With current nano-materials, for instance, the strength to weight ratio ofsuch a device would be vastly superior to earlier attempts at such designsThe circular / ring structure in the center would be the plasma accelerator/ focal containment apparatusAnd, also, with very much improved materials options currently available,such as super / ultra conductive materials, the size and efficiency of amodern design strategy for powering this sort of system would be verydifferentthan that of earlier attempts at suchThe implications for such advanced ionic / shaped plasma field buoyancyexperiments are many, and compellingAlso:2975332 ; starr w-l ; plasma propulsion device ; 14/03/1961 ...4457509 ;saint germain jean ; levitationarium for air flotation of humans ;03/07/1984www.dprix.com/biblio/uspatents3.html - 49kNote the above patent filing - this is only one of a variety of suchexamplesAs a reference point, I have a background in materials science, includingapplied nanotechnology (having worked at both Lawrence Berkeley and LosAlamos National Laboratories).It's my personal opinion that this is an advanced form of military remotelypiloted surveillance craft, having seen a number of examples of otherdevelopments in this general arena of interest, perhaps the most interestingbeing the 'robofly' project that was at UC Berkeley a couple of years ago.\" United Kingdom PoliceThe 'spy drone' was originally used for military reconnaissanceand will now be used by civilian police in Liverpool, England,this 2007 summer for the first time.
