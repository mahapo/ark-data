Iasked him, \"From your point of view, are Ebens the only non-humans that haveexperimented genetically on this planet?\"Sherman: \"All I know is that the Ebens started an experiment, but they could not keepout other space travelers. Word got out that this planet was a strange place to visit and thatdifferent experiments were not going the way the Ebens wanted. Part of the Eben problemmight be because there are 'bad guys' doing experiments, too, that might harms us. Thatreally confuses matters when it comes to understanding who wants to help humans andwho does not.\"\"Extraterrestrial Biological Entity (EBEN),\" sketched byColorado husband who was lifted along with his wife out of car on freewaynorth of Denver, Colorado, in November 1980.

From Huggins's point of view,the praying mantis entities were in charge of the small androids and were overseersof research projects involving human beings.

[ SeeGlimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness © 1998 in Earthfiles Shop.] Butthere is a lot of confusion. Before then (December 1980), I had connected prayingmantises with the Greys. It could be if was just a robotic type that the Ebens had made andwas different from the actual praying mantises. But I saw photographs and a video fromthe Bentwaters landing that showed a scary-looking creature that looked like an insectraised up on two legs with two more legs held up in front. It was with a report thatdescribed big insect-looking eyes and pincher hands.\"\"Was there any color?\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"\"It was dark (night), but there was a glowing aura around the creature. And in the aura,you could see protrusions in the jaw area that reminded me of tusks or something.\"\"If that was in the photographs, what was on the videotape?\"\"Two sequences that were shot on the second and third nights. The one on the secondnight showed the craft as clear as can be.\"\"What did you see?\"\"It was a typical saucer with four protrusion legs coming out the bottom to the ground.\"\"Did they look like erector set struts?\"\"Yeah, you could see holes in them. A ramp was down on the side facing the camera andthe cameraman walked right up to it. And he focused the camera on the ramp thingsticking out of the disc and it was like transparent! You could see the ground through theramp.\"\"Did anyone explain to you how the ramp could be transparent?\"\"No.\"\"And the surface of this disc in the video you saw - did it have any raised symbols on it?\"\"Yeah, one of the segments showed symbols. There's a whole fifteen minutes of thiscamera panning up and down the side of the symbols raised up on the surface of the flyingsaucer.\"\"Did you recognize anything like Greek?\"\"No, I know that alphabet. This was more like hieroglyphics on cave walls, more picturetypes of things, at least to me.\"\"And this was all associated with the praying mantis being?\"\"No, one of the video segments shows a normal-looking Eben at the base of the craftstanding next to the Base Commander.\"\"Col. Gordon Williams?\"[ Editor's Note: Col. Gordon E. Williams, was Commander of the 81stTraining Wing at Bentwaters AFB in England from August 7, 1979, to April23, 1981.]\"Right. It was like a portrait. This guy (Col. Gordon Williams) is standing next to an Ebenjust as clear as can be.\"\"And was the Eben dressed in a silver suit?\"\"Kind of a metallic, shiny suit, right.\"\"Did you read anything about what happened at Bentwaters?\"\"I had beer with a Major back in 1988 who told me Bentwaters was a helping hand-type ofthing on our part. The alien craft was getting ready to crash and needed some work and weactually had our Air Force mechanics try to figure out with the Ebens what to do. Andthey ended up manufacturing something.\" Eben Time Travel Technology\"Did you ever hear anything about time travelers at Bentwaters?\"\"You mean besides the Ebens?\"\"Maybe different, or are Ebens time travelers from the future?\"\"I think the Ebens can travel in and out of time any way they want to.

Females have longer hair. Very slender. Nose andeyes are similar to humans, but they have invisible, double lids, apparently for filteringlight or something.
