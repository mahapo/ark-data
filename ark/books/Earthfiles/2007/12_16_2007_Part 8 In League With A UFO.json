Out of print.Return to Part 1December 16, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - *****Chapter 6 Biodegradable Alien Objects“It was possible that nothing ever left the ship,” one person on the committeeoffered that hypothesis one day as committee members pondered how theAlien craft kept track of all its cargo. During testing, the scientists buriedAlien items hundreds of feet underground. The committee shot the Alienobjects into space on a one-way trajectory toward Jupiter. The objects wereencased in concrete, lead and steel. The scientists also sank the Alien objectsinto the deepest parts of the ocean. But still, each and every Alien itemreappeared back on board the craft three days later.The items that were encased vanished from their tomb without a trace or hintthat they were ever there. It was as if nothing had been encased at all. The"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Alien items did not displace the material covering them. No cavities werefound. How was that possible? And of what godly material were the Alienitems made from that they could not be scratched, dented or burned? Evenattempts to flatten the items under thousands of pounds of pressure failed. Thehydraulic presses were not damaged and the Alien material bounced back as ifit were a “cartoon character!”Ceramic figurines or models were made of some of the Alien items. For theones that continually changed shape and size, a history of the evolution wasattempted. The task of making a genealogy of the items that constantlychanged was very difficult, and in some cases, impossible. Apparently, someitems are not “allowed” to be photographed or their likeness preserved in anymanner. There was no way to infringe on their patent!Some Alien items never repeated the same shape twice. Others cycled throughdozens of different shapes and repeated the pattern.If the items never left the ship, where did they go? When an Alien item wascarried off the ship, it was a logical conclusion that it was no longer on theship. But the committee knew there was nothing about the ship or its contentsthat was logical. Therefore, applying logic to find a solution to all thequestions that any of them had was their biggest mistake. Alien Craft Control PanelOn one of the panels on the craft - located in the area believed to be thecontrol center - there are icons depicting everything that belongs to the Aliencraft. The size of each icon is 1/2-inch square. The area that encompassed allof the icons was approximately 3 feet by 3 feet. There are 5,184 icons. Whenan Alien item transformed, the icon for that Alien object transformed at theexact same time.When an Alien object was taken off the ship, the icon representing it gave offa soft, greenish glow. Although it was difficult to tell, some in the committeefelt that the icons were exact working replicas of each item depicted. Therewas no way to find out because the icons were inaccessible. Unlike our owncontrol panels - which have access panels to the instrumentation via anopening in the back, front or side - there is no means of entry to the Aliencontrol panel of instruments. Alien Spaceship Like “Living Metallic Animal”The whole spaceship resembles a kind of living metallic animal. It has novisible rivets or screws to hold things together, nor are there any seams. Theship and its contents seemed to be more organic than synthetic. There are nohinges, latches, knobs, rollers or wheels - only a smooth, even, one-piece skinthat encompassed the whole craft.The ship extracted infinitely more information about the researchers than theresearchers could ever hope to collect from the craft. That was a foregoneconclusion by the committee. There was no mechanism clicking away in thecraft to indicate the craft was gathering information. But the craft adapted tosome of the awkward ways the researchers went about culling material fromit. The craft gave clues to the scientist when items activated certain devicesand openings on the craft. The ship did this by making the Alien item thescientist was looking for give off a glow. In a few cases, there was a soundthat indicated the Alien object needed to proceed with whatever project thescientist was working on. The process was similar to the way humans solveproblems: if we study a problem long enough, many times a solution presentitself in a dream or inspiration.The theory is that the subconscious mind, like a computer, works better atnight while all other distractions are at a minimum. Possibly the craft pickedup on the frustration of the scientists in a similar manner and the providedsome of the solutions. Still, the road to understanding the Aliens and theircraft was long and full of potholes. The scientists hit every obstacle.Why did the Aliens dump so much difficult information on earthlings all atonce? Did the Aliens overestimate the ability of humans to comprehend anadvanced society as their own? Highly unlikely, given the Alien superiority,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"which suggests they are not capable of making such a mistake. Alien Technology - Where Does It Come From?How much new technology was gathered from that particular Alien craft andthen put into practical earthly use is not known. At what rate the Alientechnology was dispersed is also unknown.Like any product that is manufactured in factories, the finished object is theresult of many dissimilar processes. The raw materials come from one source,while the knowledge of how to process it comes from another source. It is notnecessary to know where one technology ends and another begins or fromwhere it came. All that matters is the end product. The technology or bits ofinformation coming from the committee are collected and mixed with otherbits of information from other sources and technologies. This committee is justone of many others that are secretly working on “who knows what?”Truthfully, who cares as long as new technology keeps coming.The knowledge derived from the Alien ship is combined with other sourcesthat are not so secret, like universities and private corporations that doresearch. All these bits of information flowing and combining until someoneyells, “Eureka!” that signals yet another step toward a more advanced world. The Magic of the IconsOne of the members felt that he cracked the puzzle about how the Alienobjects vanished and then returned to the ship. He felt that the icons were notonly symbols on a control panel, but were actual items. The items that arecarried out of the craft and studied by the scientists are simply disposablereplicas of the icons. The life span of the replicas is exactly 72 hours. Thescientist believed that the Alien objects dissolved into the atmosphere, leavingno evidence that they ever existed. This theory fit well with the reports madeby people who have claimed they were abducted. All of the abducteesreported that Aliens have inserted metal objects into various parts of theirbodies. But when skeptics have asked the human subjects to produce theAlien implanted objects, the abductees have been unable to do so.Up to that point, no one on the committee had proved that the Alien itemsvaporized, but it was one of their better hunches at the time. Vaporization alsoexplained why no one ever found an Alien artifact, or why there is noevidence that Aliens ever visited Earth. Vaporization answered the bigquestion that UFO skeptics always ask: “If Aliens are visiting Earth, where isthe Alien litter?” The answer to that question has always been clear to some -the Aliens are not the litterbugs that humans are.Those answers are too simplistic for the skeptics and the committee wants tokeep it that way. The committee has no intentions of supplying hard proof, orany proof, of Alien existence. On the contrary, the scientists would be the firstto deny the existence of Aliens.The possibility that the control panel icons are replicating endless copies ofthemselves with the same ease as cells do in a laboratory was astounding.What kind of world could be built if only a fraction of that magic were to besqueezed out of these objects? Once an Alien item was taken out of the craftand it expired, only then did another one reappear to take its place. There wasno method of knowing if the icons replicated new items every three daysautomatically? Or if only the ones that left the ship were renewed?The scientist were unable to test the theory by marking the Alien items as onewould mark a dollar bill. The Alien metallic material was impervious to allmanner of markings. That material would be a godsend for cities that areunder assault by the graffiti infantile. Paint simply blots up and rolls off theAlien material.The moment “Frankenstein” became part of the inventory of the Alien craft,an icon of that male body appeared on a separate panel. If the theory held thatthe icons were the prototypes of all the items on the ship, then perhaps thecommittee could subject the body to many kinds of experiments. That wouldlimit the committee's need to harvest damaged humans on which toexperiment."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"To test that theory, the scientists made a drastic decision: “Kill the body.” Thecommittee could not test that theory on any of the other Alien objects becausethey are indestructible. The body, on the other hand, was still flesh and blood.So, the scientists hoped the “Frankenstein” body could be damaged or killed.No one volunteered to kill the body. Even though the body was no more thana living plant, a “vegetable,” no one could bring themselves to kill it. Thecommittee decided to request from its superiors the assistance of a Mafia-typehit man. The request was approved and the committee was told to draft aprocedure about how the assignment would be carried out. The committeedecided to have this done on a remote island and to have the murder staged asa hit over a gambling debt. The body was dressed in casual clothingappropriate for lounging on a beach. The body was staged reclining under abeach umbrella wearing dark sunglasses and supposedly listening to musiccoming from a portable radio sitting on the sand next to the body.“Frankenstein” was flown to that destination on a military cargo plane.The orders to the hit man were, “Approach the man from behind, shoot himthrough the head three times and leave.” The hit man had no clue as to whomhe was killing and assumed it was a routine “hit” ordered by his employer.After the hit took place, the committee members in charge of that operationsealed off the area. The scientists made detailed observations about what tookplace in the body moments after it was shot. The body was monitored for 72hours to see if it would vanish like all the other Alien objects. When it did not,the committee returned the body to the base and did an autopsy on it. Thescientists discovered that the Alien contraption was no longer inside the body.The autopsy did not find anything mysterious or unusual about the dead body.It showed the same amount of decomposition that any normal cadaverundergoes in that time period under similar conditions.The study raised more questions and answered none. The death did not provethat the Alien objects decompose. The death only proved that the human bodywith the Alien contraption is mortal. The icon of the body was no longerdisplaying on the control panel. There was no eulogy given and no sorrowshown from anyone who worked with, or around, the body. Instead, mostwere relieved at not having it around anymore. Once the body was gone, therewas a noticeable jump in morale. But those happy days were short-lived.Orders from the top were to produce one more body as soon as possible, withmore bodies to follow sometime in the future. Aliens Take the InitiativeOne morning one of the committee members revealed to his colleagues that hehad been abducted the night before! That revelation brought a sense ofexcitement to the rest of the members. All of them believed that because ofthe special circumstances of their work, it was strange it had not happenedsooner. The scientist abductee told his colleagues that it had been going oneven before he came to the program. The scientist then told the committeethat they, too, are abductees and have been taken many times since theirchildhood. The Aliens allowed him to remember this abduction because, asthey put it, “It was time.”The scientist was abducted while he was at home sleeping. There were otherhumans on the Alien craft with him who had been abducted moments beforethe Aliens took him. The non-humans allowed the scientist to be an“observer” and for the first time in his life, he was not the subject of whateverprocedure the Aliens performed. The other humans there with him were not solucky. The scientist had to endure the torment he watched each put through.He did not have freedom of movement and was told telepathically where to goand he did, even before his conscious mind understood the request. TheAliens had direct access to his subconscious mind. Under the Alien control,his body moved as if he were on auto-pilot. All the scientist could do wasmentally sit back while his body instantly took psychic commands from theAliens.The Aliens were friendly, treated him kindly and constantly assured thescientist that he did not need to be afraid. When he had a question and theAliens were willing to answer, it was answered quicker than the questionformed in his mind. If it was a question the Aliens would not answer, thenon-humans told the scientist and then let him know that possibly he would be"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"given an answer to that question some time in the future. Even when theirintentions were to never reveal a certain secret, the Aliens avoided usingnegative responses.It was a good thing that the Aliens had the scientist on auto-pilot, he told hiscolleagues, because his knees were shaky. After working on this Alien projectfor more than twenty-five years, the scientist could not believe howunprepared he was to meet the Aliens face-to-face.The scientist knew that the abduction he experienced that night was only theinitiation and that he was not expected to understand any of the things thatwent on. He did remember that there were four other adult human men therewith him. Each was sitting naked on a bench. Each looked as if he were inboot camp, sitting up straight with a forlorn look. Each was not completelyparalyzed because the scientist watched two of the men turn their heads andlook straight at the scientist. He recognized the fear he saw in the men's eyes.“It was the same fear he had in his!”The scientist told his committee colleagues that the stars are much brighterwhen viewed from a vantage point above the earth's atmosphere. He rambledon about how giddy he felt despite his fear. While the Aliens did their work,the craft was parked somewhere in Earth's orbit. The scientist wanted to go toone of the portals for a better look at the stars and to see what Earth lookedlike from space. But the Aliens told him he could not during that visit.The Aliens were strictly business, not like a doctor's office on Earth where apatient has time to read magazines before the visit begins. There was littlewaiting for the anxious souls who were in the Alien ship. One at a time, eachhuman got up and walked into a room that seemed to be as bright as the sunitself. Then seemingly from nowhere, a frail-looking Alien appeared with arapid motion assisted the human subject onto the table. Everything in theroom was polished and orderly. Instruments seemed to appear out of thin airwhen they were needed.That room was similar to the one that was aboard the craft the committee hadin its possession, except that the scientists never witnessed instrumentspermeate from the walls as happened during the abduction. That Alien roomwas the only one that was similar to the committee's craft. The abduction craftwas much bigger - eight to ten times bigger. The scientist physically did notsee many Aliens, but somehow he knew there were dozens of them on boardthat ship.As the scientist watched the Aliens work (at speeds that made him dizzy), allhe could think of was getting out of that place. It was ironic. He waited forthat moment for many years and now he was not sure he ever wanted it again.Some on the committee wondered if they should go through regressiontherapy to find out what kind of experiences each had when each wasabducted. None of them knew for sure if they had been abducted. All but twowere not surprised when regression confirmed abductions had taken place.The committee member who was abducted and who revealed that fact to hiscolleagues advised them not to go through regression. He told the scientiststhat from what he had seen, he could attest that the procedures the Aliensused on abductees were extremely painful. So, the best thing for them was notto relive that experience. “Going back to revisit it is nothing short ofmasochistic,” he told the committee.Although the Aliens worked too rapidly for him to keep up with what theAliens were doing, the scientist was awed by how precisely the Aliens andtheir machines performed their duties. If the scientist had not been so scared,he would have laughed at what he saw, although what the abductees weregoing through was not laughable. The way the human abductees were tossedaround “like rag dolls” was somewhat amusing. It was as if he were in a denof mad magicians. There were objects that flew around the room, sometimesstopping over the table where the abductee was lying. That flying Alien objectwould perform a jig, then move about the room swaying and dancing in theair.Other Alien objects are robotic and walked or hovered. Some appeared out ofthin air, did their thing and then left. Some of the Aliens looked human, butperhaps they were like the scientist on some kind of internship. If the human-looking ones were like him, those humanoids were at a higher level than thescientist was because those humanoids walked around freely and did not seem"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"to be experiencing the fear that he and the other abducted humans were.Many of the instruments that were used by the Aliens seemed to come fromnowhere. Some appeared to be organic and moved and looked like worms.Those emerged from what looked like solid surfaces, yet left no hole afteremerging or when the Alien objects retreated back into the solid surfaces.Regardless of what was performed on the abducted humans, the outcome wasnever hit and miss. It was “known.” The Aliens literally split one of the mendown the middle, cutting him completely in half. Seconds later, the Aliens hadput the human man back together. All this was done with no blood loss orvisible scars.Everything was outpatient. There was no lying around convalescing for theabducted. Once each person emerged from the surgical table, each was readyto be returned to their respective bedrooms, or to wherever each hadoriginally been picked up from.Because of the pain that was endured by the abducted humans, it might haveseemed like the humans were there in the craft for hours. But from what thecommittee scientist could recall, none of the abducted were under the “knife”for more than two or three minutes. The actual time it took might have beenlonger, since the passage of time is difficult to judge while inside an Aliencraft.
