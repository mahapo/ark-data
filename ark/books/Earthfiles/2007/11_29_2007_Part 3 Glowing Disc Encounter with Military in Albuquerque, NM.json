McKeever served as an E-4 Army Reserve Specialist Corporal.Entered basic training on August 31, 1984, and remained in activeArmy reserves until August 31, 1992.After Army basic training, Paul returned to Albuquerque where he remained in activeArmy reserves until 1992. What Paul did not know was that only six years after he and hisMom and Aunt saw the disc at ground level on the Sandia hill, Kirtland security guardsalso saw lights, or discs, land three different times inside Coyote Canyon’s restricted testrange between August 8 and September 3, 1980.That highly secure test range is used by the U. S. Air Force Weapons Laboratory, SandiaLaboratories, the Defense Nuclear Agency, and the Department of Energy.September 1980 Complaint Form for evaluation by Major Ernest E. Edwards,Commander, 1608 SPS, Manzano, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico. “CR 44 applies.”The complaint title is: “KIRTLAND AFB, NM, 8 August to 3 September 1980, AllegedSightings of Unidentified Aerial Lights in Restricted Test Range.” And “CR 44 Applies.”The definition of CR 44 is Collections Requirement for nuclear weapons security,originally established in October 1974 and revised to CR 44A in November 1983. “Underthe guidance of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), theMilitary Services, and the Unified and Specified Commands shall provide commanders or"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"organizations responsible for safety and security of nuclear weapons with currentintelligence concerning threats to nuclear weapons.”Clearly unidentified flying discs were presenting threats to America’s nuclear weapons if athreat could be defined as landing right next to a restricted, classified nuclear weaponsstorage area, such as ERDA’s Coyote Canyon facility. The 1980 Complaint Form waswritten up because a CR 44 violation had been committed by unidentified aerial lights,which landed where nuclear weapons were stored.The complaint says that on August 8, 1980, three policemen from the Kirtland AFBSecurity Police Squadron “on duty inside the Manzano Weapons Storage Area, sighted anunidentified light in the air that traveled from North to South over the Coyote Canyon areaof the Department of Defense Restricted Test Range on KAFB, NM. The SecurityPolicemen identified as: SSGT STEPHEN FERENZ, Area Supervisor, AIC MARTIN W.RIST and ANN ANTHONY D. FRAZIER, were later interviewed separately by SOURCEand all three related the same statement:At approximately 2350 hours, while on duty in Charlie Sector, East Side ofManzano, the three observed a very bright light in the sky approximately 3miles North-North East of their position. The light traveled with great speedand stopped suddenly in the sky over Coyote Canyon. The three first thoughtthe object was a helicopter; however, after observing the strange aerialmaneuvers (stop and go), they felt a helicopter couldn’t have performed suchskills. The light landed in the Coyote Canyon area. Sometime later, threewitnessed the light take off and leave proceeding straight up at a high speedand disappear.In Paragraph 3, the Complaint states that three nights later on August 11, 1980, a SandiaSecurity Guard after midnight “was driving East on the Coyote Canyon access road on aroutine building check of an alarmed structure. As he approached the structure, heobserved a bright light near the ground behind the structure. As he approached thestructure, he observed a bright light near the ground behind the structure. He also observedan object he first thought was a helicopter. But after driving closer, he observed a rounddisk-shaped object. He attempted to radio for a back up patrol, but his radio would not"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"work. As he approached the object on foot armed with a shotgun, the object took off in avertical direction at a high rate of speed. The guard was a former helicopter mechanic inthe U. S. Army and stated the object he observed was not a helicopter.”In summary, in August 1980 on the 8th, 9th and 22nd, security officers patrolling theCoyote Canyon Manzano Weapons Storage Area saw unidentified disc-shaped glowinglights land inside the restricted nuclear weapons storage zone.And only six years before on May 28, 1974, several Albuquerque residents sawdisc-shaped aerial craft from morning to night – until finally military security surroundedone of those discs in the Sandia hills, while some civilians watched until they were orderedaway by an angry policeman. And someone managed to erase it all from the media.I am trying to find other eyewitnesses from that night, hoping by now – 33 years later –people will now be willing to join Paul McKeever, his mom and aunt in speaking truthabout yet another American government suppression of non-human intelligences andtechnologies interacting with this planet. I am hoping that others will contact me who were also in Albuquerque, New Mexico, onMay 28, 1974, at the Sandia hills on the eastern edge of the city beyond Menaul andTramway Boulevards, watching the glowing disc surrounded by military - or were one ofthe military security police.
