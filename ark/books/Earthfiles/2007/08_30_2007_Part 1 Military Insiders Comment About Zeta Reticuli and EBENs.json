August 30, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - According to the December 1974 issue ofAstronomy magazine, “The two stars that comprise the Zeta Reticuli system are almostidentical to the sun. Each is classified as a G2 star, the same as our sun. They are the onlyknown examples of two solar type stars apparently linked into a binary star system of wideseparation. Zeta 1 is separated from Zeta 2 by at least 350 billion miles - almost onehundred times the sun-Pluto distance. The two suns probably require at least 100,000years to orbit their common center of gravity. The binary stars are in the constellationReticulum (The Net), which is 37.5 light years from our solar system. Reticulum is visiblefrom Earth's Southern Hemisphere. Both Zeta 1 and Zeta 2 are prime candidates for thesearch for life beyond Earth. According to our current theories of planetary formation,they both have a retinue of planets something like our solar system.”In that December 1974 issue of Astronomy was a 15-page article entitled “The ZetaReticuli Incident” by astronomer and author, Terence Dickinson. His article began:“ A faint pair of stars, 220 trillion miles away, has been tentatively identifiedas the ‘home base’ of intelligent extraterrestrials who allegedly visited Earth in1961. This hypothesis is based on a strange, almost bizarre series of eventsmixing astronomical research with hypnosis, amnesia, and alien humanoidcreatures.“The two stars are known as Zeta 1 and Zeta 2 Reticuli, or together, as simplyZeta Reticuli. They are each fifth magnitude stars - barely visible to theunaided eye- located in the obscure southern constellation Reticulum. this"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"southerly sky location makes Zeta Reticuli invisible to observers north ofMexico City's latitude.”The hypnosis, amnesia and alien humanoid creatures that Mr. Dickinson referred to arefrom the Betty and Barney Hill abduction case in the White Mountains of New Hampshireon their way home to Portsmouth on September 19, 1961. The events and efforts to unlockmissing time with psychiatrist, Benjamin Simon, M. D., were detailed in the book, TheInterrupted Journey © 1966 by John G. Fuller. Betty and Barney Hill were apparentlyabducted from New Hampshire's White Mountains by bumpy, grey-skinned beings inshiny, all-black body suits. Betty drew a star map under hypnosis, which she said wasshown to her by “the leader” on the craft.Years later, when U. S. amateur astronomer Marjorie Fish began to compare Betty Hill'sdrawing to stars in the local neighborhood of the Earth, she discovered a match whichincluded Zeta Reticuli 1 and 2. Betty Hill said those two stars were the starting point oftrade routes shown with multiple lines in graphic below and that our sun (yellow arrow)was at the end of one supposedly regular trade route.Astronomy, December 1974: “Top diagram is a copy of the mapBetty Hill drew under hypnosis, allegedly a duplicate of one she saw insidean extraterrestrial vehicle. (Yellow arrow denotes our Sun.) Center map is derived from a modelof our stellar neighborhood by Marjorie Fish. It shows the stars that coincide with those onthe Hill map. The only area of significant incongruity is the wide separation of Zeta Reticuliin the Hill version (with multiple lines between binary stars). Lower computer-generatedmap shows a cathode ray tube computer readout that was run at Ohio State Universityas a check on the Fish model. Data used to derive the Fish model and the computerreadout were taken from the Gliese catalog.” Graphic © 1974 by Astronomy. Government Insiders - 1985I met two men in 1985, who claimed to have government insider knowledge about anextraterrestrial civilization in the binary star system, Zeta Reticuli, 37.5 light-years fromEarth. One man was retired in Washington, D. C., and the other continued governmentassignments in the southwest. Both said they had worked for a secret group, whichcontinued from the MJ-12 (Majestic Twelve) of the Truman Administration in the 1940s.The men also claimed some knowledge about other non-human types referred to simply as"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"\"Greys,\" or \"little guys,\" which they did not trust.Other categories of alien life forms that confused the situation even more, they said, werebiological androids that ranged widely in appearance from insects to humanoids designedby their makers for various planetary tasks. To protect their identity at their request, I havecombined their information in the single name, Sherman.I asked Sherman, \"Why would the Ebens have come here in the first place?\"\"I don't know the whole story, but I've been told the Ebens come from Zeta Reticuli 1 and2, a binary star system about 38 light-years from Earth.\"Sherman said it was true that MJ-12 was established by one of President Harry S. Truman'sExecutive Orders in 1947. MJ-12's charter, he said, was to study the UFO phenomenon, tooversee retrievals of crashed discs and alien bodies, to back-engineer extraterrestrialtechnology and to study captured beings referred to as \"extraterrestrial biological entities\"(EBENs). MJ-12, he said, was also directed to keep the public ignorant of theextraterrestrial presence \"at all costs\" to prevent public panic and to keep the aliens'advanced technology hidden from Cold War enemies in the interests of national security. DOD's Extraterrestrial Space CommandDirectorate, E2SCDIn the 1990s, Sherman said MJ-12 had evolved to a different letter number code thatbegan \"E2\" - perhaps related to an alleged black budget military organization with theDefense Department called E2SCD, the Extraterrestrial Space Command Directorate. Iasked Sherman if he had personally seen non-human technology.\"I've held an Eben communicator that's called the Yellow Book - I guess because theletters and words look like yellow light. The book doesn't have any pages. It's a rectangleabout fifteen inches by nineteen inches. If you saw it laying on a table, you would think itwas a flat piece of plastic with a light grey metallic sheen. But when you pick it up in yourhands, the words start appearing and they are a yellow color. You move your eyes along asthe words appear and they just keep coming as you read. Once you get to the bottom, thenext page starts, followed by the next page, and the next page over and over on the samesurface. I don't know how it works.\"When you turn it over, there are 3-D holographic photos or some kind of imagery thatseems to pop upward in the air. You're supposed to be able to control the sequence byknowing how to move the book at different angles. I was told the Ebens know how tocapture time and play it back in 3-dimensional images. There are actual manuals abouthow to hold it to read and see the images. But I didn't have any instruction, so in the hour Iheld it, I learned only a few things.\"The Yellow Book had Earth history.\"\"How do the Ebens communicate in English or any human language?\"\"I don't know. I don't know how the translation works. When I read the Yellow Book, itwas in English. Maybe it picks up brainwave patterns and can interact in the language ofany user.\"\"And it's in the act of picking the Yellow Book up that it's activated?\"\"Yes.\"\"When you turned it to the back, you could see holographic-like projections of imagescome out into the air that related to where you were reading on the front side?\"\"No, when you turned it over, you hold the square side of the book and hold it up atdifferent angles. As you slightly move it, different pictures project out.\"\"Were the pictures related to where you left off in the words?\"\"Not really. You have to have instructions. I didn't know at what angle to hold it. I justplayed with it and saw different pictures not necessarily related to what I had already read.Now if I had a chance to read it again, I understand there is a pattern you start with andkeep moving in different patterns to project images about what you are reading.\"\"Was sound associated with the images?\"\"No, no sound. Years later after I saw the Yellow Book, someone told me there are sounds"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"connected with the pictures. But I never hard any sounds. Maybe it was something I didwrong or I didn't move it right.\"\"How did the MJ-12 group get the Yellow Book?\"\"The Ebens gave it to us back on April 25, 1964, when they landed at White Sands for aprearranged meeting and stayed for awhile. The day before when police officer, LonnieZamora, saw a craft and beings near Socorro was a coordination mistake of some kind.The Ebens landed twelve hours too early and too far west. We got it corrected somehowand they returned around 6 AM the next morning to the right place (at Trinity Site innorthern end of White Sands). By the way, Zamora drew those Eben symbols perfectly.\"UFO researcher, Chris Lambright, says this oil painting is based on photographstaken at the landing site where police officer, Lonnie Zamora, saw the egg-shaped craft.\"The image portrays the object just as it began to lift off and from a viewpoint near whereMr. Zamora reportedly stood. Mr. Zamora has seen this illustration and stated that it is a good representationof what he observed, though he felt that the 'legs' might have been extendedslightly further than is portrayed. The dimensions presented however are taken from boththe witness description and the exact measurements provided by investigatorsof the impressions in the soil.\" Oil painting © by Patrick Richard.\"When you and your group have face-to-face communications with Ebens, how does itwork?\"\"The April 25, 1964, meeting with Ebens was in Red Canyon about eighteen miles east ofthe Trinity site (first atomic bomb test in July 1945) at the north end of White SandsProving Ground.[ Editor's Note: Trinity Site is where the first atomic bomb of 19 kilotons wasexploded at 5:29:45 a.m. Mountain War Time on July 16, 1945. Red CanyonRange Camp was in the northeast corner of White Sands Proving Ground(later named White Sands Missile Range) and was opened in October 1953 byFort Bliss as a place to conduct Nike Ajax training and annual service firings.At the time, Fort Bliss did not have the necessary area for such a mission.White Sands allowed the use of the northeast corner of the range as atemporary facility. Source: White Sands Missile Range history.]We also had a decoy hangar set up at Holloman AFB just in case there was a leak. Theyhad a disinformation program to draw people's attention to Holloman when in actuality,the landing was further north. After the Ebens landed in one of their egg-shaped ships,they had devices that looked like large wands. A wand was handed to our commander.When he spoke into the wand, the Eben language came out in another wand held by oneof the Ebens. When the Eben spoke into his wand, English words came out of the wandthe commander was holding, sort of like a loud speaker.\"\"Sherman, that sounds like the communicator rod depicted in the drawing that AllanSandler and Robert Emenegger published based on actual photographs and film of anextraterrestrial meeting near Holloman AFB. Do the Ebens have a large, beaked nose likethat drawing?\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Drawing of large-nosed non-human and disk-shaped craft in alleged landing at Holloman AFBfrom the Photo Section of UFOs: Past, Present and Future © 1974 by Robert Emeneggerand Allan Sandler Institutional Films, Inc.

The Ebens are one of the types that crashed in 1947. They're about fourand a half to five feet all, grey-skinned, four long, skinny fingers, flat face, very smallnose, small openings for ears, and a slit for a mouth. Their eyes are large with a black lid,which can cover 'cat eyes' underneath. Those eyes have a gold-colored iris around a dark,vertical slit pupil. And they wear a tight-fitting, greyish-white jump suit.\"[ Editor's Note: Betty Hill, after her September 1961 abduction from the NewHampshire White Mountains with her husband, Barney, had a vivid dream inwhich she described a non-human entity as having cat eyes and a large noseshe compared to the nose of Jimmy Durante, affectionately known as \"TheSchnoz\" during his music/acting career.]James Francis DuranteFebruary 10, 1893 - January 29, 1980\"Then is the big-nosed drawing made up?\"\"No, I've seen the film of that meeting at Red Canyon and there was a tall, almosthuman-like alien that stood behind the Ebens. And it appeared that he had a big nose. Hewas wearing some kind of strange looking armor that reminded me of Egyptian stuff andhe had on a helmet that went up high. He never talked. He was just there. That was theonly one like that in the whole encounter.\"\"So, what is the relationship between the Ebens and the big-nosed guy?\"\"I don't know. He reminded me of a soldier guarding.\"\"Is there any connection to Egypt and Sumeria?\"\"I think so. I know I read that the Ebens had also spent almost twenty years living amongthe Mayans who had stepped pyramids like the ziggurats of Sumeria. The report said the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Mayans worshipped the Ebens. I've often wondered if the rituals of human sacrifice byfemales and warriors were inspired by the Ebens.\"\"You mean, 'food for the gods?'\"\"Yeah. I don't know if the Ebens visited periodically over twenty years or actually lived inthe Yucatan and Guatemala area for twenty years. But there was some kind of Ebeninfluence on the Mayans at some point. In fact, it's interesting that Mayan and Mongolianbabies are sometimes born with odd blue marks on the lower spine. And what I've beentold is that the Ebens experimented genetically in Bhutan, Tibet and Nepal and thentransplanted some of those altered humans to what we call Central America.\"\"Then, Sherman, is it true that the Ebens and maybe other extraterrestrial groupsmanipulated DNA in already-evolving primates to create Homo sapiens sapiens as I wasshown in a briefing paper at Kirtland AFB in 1983?\"Yes, but it's a difficult subject. All I can tell you is something Ebe One said: 'We madeyou. We put you here. But you have to live it.' And they watch us grow. They've been heresince at least the time of the dinosaurs ( 250 million to 65 million years ago; hominidsbeginning with Homo erectus are only about 1 million-years-old; oldest archaic Homosapiens-like hominids are only about 200,000-years-old). And according to a report I read,the Ebens collected one of each species of dinosaur and placed them either in one bigplanetary zoo or on different planets. And that was at least 68 million or more years ago.\"\"Sherman, if the Ebens did collect all the dinosaur species and preserve them, do youknow what happened that caused almost total annihilation of Earth life during that periodin Earth's history?\"\"I read in the Yellow Book that the Ebens knew back then that a very large asteroid wasgoing to hit the Earth. The Ebens wrote that they were saving one of each species that wason this planet - not just the dinosaurs, but the ants and insects, flies, snakes, fish. TheEbens said they took one of everything to save all the species before the asteroid hit.\"\"Sort of a Noah's Ark rescue story?\"\"Right. And I guess they've experimented with life forms here ever since.\"To be continued in Part 2.More Information:If viewers have more information about non-human encounters, please email me atearthfiles@earthfiles.comFor further reports about non-human intelligence, technology and interactions with Earthlife, please see reports below in the Earthfiles Archive and my four books:An Alien Harvest; the 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities; and Mysterious Lights andCrop Circles in the Earthfiles Shop:EBENs (Extraterrestrial Biological Entities)• 08/30/2007 — Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 09/04/2006 — Part 1: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet?• 09/05/2006 — Part 2: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet?• 06/18/2006 — Viewer Letters About NASA Airbrushing Photos; EBENs and Reptilian Humanoids• 05/12/2006 — An Extraterrestrial School for Humans• 03/17/2006 — Part 1: U.S. Navy Chief Yeoman Describes \"Extraterrestrial Biological Entities\"in TOP SECRET/MAJIC Photographs.• 03/23/2006 — Part 2: U.S. Navy Chief Yeoman Describes \"Extraterrestrial Biological Entities\" in TOPSECRET/MAJIC Photographs• 02/10/2006 — Crashed Disc Photos, \"Ebens,\" and Area 51 \"Anti-Gravity\"• 10/05/2002 — Part 1 - Two Scientists Describe Extraterrestrial Biological Entity (EBEN) Called \"J-Rod\"• 06/22/1999 — The Strange Story of J-Rod, An EBENon-Humans and Aerial Craft• 08/24/2007 — Orange-Red \"Fiery\" Aerial Spheres• 08/01/2007 — Part 3, Non-Human Blonds, Greys and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Lizards• 07/31/2007 — Part 2, Non-Human Blonds, Greys and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Lizards• 07/26/2007 — Part 1, Non-Human Blonds, Lizards and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Greys• 07/28/2007 — Mysterious Aerial Lights Over Stratford-upon-Avon, July 14, and Farnborough, Hampshire,on July 22, 2007• 07/14/2007 — Schofield Barracks, Oahu, Hawaii - Huge, Lime Green Oval Craft Hovered Over BattalionHeadquarters• 03/14/2007 — Part 5: Mysterious Events At 2005 Tawsmead Copse \"Insectogram\" Crop Formation• 02/12/2007 — Part 2: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers andListeners"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"• 01/26/2007 — Part 1: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans• 01/26/2007 — Part 2: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans• 01/26/2007 — Part 3: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans• 01/08/2007 — Updated: Attorney Describes His Encounter with Non-Human Entities• 01/02/2007 — Grey Aerial Disk Reported by Chicago O'Hare United Airlines Pilots and Mechanics• 10/28/2006 — Close UFO Encounter by USAF Eyewitnesses• 12/31/2006 — Part 8: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 10/19/2006 — UFO Retaliation to U.
