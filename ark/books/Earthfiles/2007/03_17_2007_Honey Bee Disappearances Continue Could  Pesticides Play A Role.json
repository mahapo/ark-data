Map courtesy MAAREC. March 16, 2007 Washington, D. C. - In my previous February 23, 2007, Earthfiles andCoast to Coast AM news updates about the mysterious honey bee disappearances, Iinterviewed a Pennsylvania honey beekeeper who has had nearly 2,000 of his 2900 hivesdisappear – a 60% loss to date. That is David Hackenberg of Hackenberg Apiary inPennsylvania. He said he had never seen so many deserted hives that were also left aloneby predator moths and beetles. That’s why he suspects some kind of pesticide is gettinginto the flower pollen and nectar and poisoning the hives. He contacted Penn State’s beeexperts to investigate. But to date, there is no answer.And bees are still disappearing in massive numbers. One Midwestern beekeeper had13,000 healthy, full hives in mid-November 2006. Those bees began disappearing inmid-December and now he's lost 96% of them. He's facing bankruptcy. This week, oneOhio beekeeper opened up his hives after the winter to find 80% were empty. Over thepast six months, massive disappearances of honey bees have been reported in at least 24states; internationally in Poland and Spain; and it’s still unknown how many more honeybees will be gone as more northern hives are opened this spring in North America andEurope. Right now, dozens of scientists are trying to find out what is causing what theycall “colony collapse disorder,” or CCD."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I talked with Penn State entomologist Diana Cox-Foster, Ph.D., who has analyzed somebees found in deserted hives. Dr. Cox-Foster has seen as many as five different viruses andunidentified fungi in the bees. She says that is two times more pathogens than she’s everseen before in honey bees. The implication is that something has seriously damaged theirimmune systems, leaving the honey bees more vulnerable to disease than before. But whatcould that be?So far, there are still no answers, but there is a long list of possibilities, which includepesticides and genetically modified crops, also known as GMOs or GMs. Scientists saythere is no direct evidence that genetically modified crops are linked to honey bee die-offs.But I have been learning that not much is known about the accumulating impact ofpesticides on insects, animals and even people when you consider in this modern worldhow many combinations of pesticides are used. One pesticide by itself might not destroyhoney bees. But what happens when farmers spray herbicides, fungicides, insecticides androdenticides on land that also has genetically modified crops with pesticides built-in?The United States grows nearly two-thirds of all genetically engineered crops. Last yearabout 130 million acres were planted with GMs. Much of the soy, corn, cotton and canolahave had a gene inserted into their DNA to produce pesticides systemically throughout theplants created and patented by Monsanto. Monsanto also produces genetically modifiedcrops designed not to die when herbicides are sprayed on them. In a perfect biotech world,only the weeds would be killed. But Mother Nature has a way of outwitting humandesigns. So, now the weeds are becoming resistant to the herbicide sprays and frustratedfarmers are putting on more and more poisons.One American plant pathologist who is very concerned about the herbicide-resistant weedsis Doug Gurian-Sherman, Ph.D., now a senior scientist in the Food and EnvironmentProgram at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, D.C. Previously between1995 and 2000, Dr. Gurian-Sherman was a staff scientist at the Environmental ProtectionAgency where he evaluated risks and safety of pesticides and genetically modified crops. Iasked him what effect accumulating pesticides might have on honey bees.Interview: New Problem: Herbicide-Resistant Weeds inGenetically Engineered CropsDoug Gurian-Sherman, Ph.D., Plant Pathologist, Senior Scientist in the Food andEnvironment Program, Union of Concerned Scientists, and previous Staff Scientist,Environmental Protection Agency, evaluating risks and safety of pesticides andgenetically modified crops, Washington, D. C.: “It’s hard to know what the implicationsare for bees, but one of the two main genetically engineered crops and the one most widelyplanted in the U. S. and around the world are herbicide-tolerant crops – especiallyherbicide-tolerant soybeans. At least half of the soybeans in the U. S. are resistant to aparticular type of pesticide called glyphosate. The trade name of the most common type iscalled Roundup.[ Editor’s Note: Roundup C3H8NO5P is the brand name of a systemic,broad-spectrum herbicide produced by the biotech corporation, Monsanto. Itis the most used herbicide in the world, and the top-selling agrichemical of alltime. An herbicide is a pesticide used to kill unwanted plants. Selectiveherbicides kill specific targets while leaving the desired crop relativelyunharmed. Some of these act by interfering with the growth of the weed andare often based on plant hormones. Herbicides used to clear waste ground arenonselective and kill all plant material with which they come into contact. TheRoundup Herbicide has been linked to amphibian deaths in watercontaminated with Roundup runoff.Herbicides are widely used in agriculture and in landscape turf management.They are applied in total vegetation control (TVC) programs for maintenanceof highways and railroads. Smaller quantities are used in forestry, pasturesystems, and management of areas set aside as wildlife habitat.Monsanto developed and patented the glyphosatemolecule in the 1970s, andmarketed Roundup from 1973 onward. Monsanto retained exclusive rights inthe United States until its U.S. patent expired in September 2000. ThenMonsanto maintained a predominant marketshare in countries where thepatent expired earlier."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The active ingredient in Roundup is the isopropylamine salt of glyphosate.Glyphosate's mode of action is to inhibit an enzyme involved in the synthesisof the amino acids tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine. It is absorbedthrough foliage and translocated (moves through plant sap) to growing points.Weeds and grass will generally re-emerge within one to two months afterusage. Because of this mode of action, it is only effective on actively growingplants. Roundup is not effective as a \"pre-emergence herbicide.\" Monsantoalso produces seeds which grow into plants genetically engineered to betolerant to glyphosate which are known as Roundup Ready crops. The genescontained in these seeds are patented. Such crops allow farmers to useglyphosate as a post-emergence pesticide against both broadleaf and cerealweeds. Soy beans were the first Roundup Ready crop, which was produced atMonsanto's Agracetus Campus located in Middleton, Wisconsin. CurrentRoundup Ready crops include corn, sorghum, cotton, soy beans, canola andalfalfa. ]What this genetically engineered trait does is allow a farmer to spray the herbicide right onthe crop, which would have killed the crop, would kill the soybeans, prior to introductionof this gene. The gene comes from a type of bacteria that is found in the soil and it makesthe plant immune to the herbicide.The consequence of this is that glyphosate and Roundup, which is sold by Monsanto - thesame company that also sells the seed of the type of soybeans that are immune or resistantto the herbicide - that herbicide has become the most widely used herbicide in the world.The consequence of that is you have one particular herbicide used on a tremendousamount of acreage in the U. S. and elsewhere, especially Argentina and Brazil.As any biologist would expect, when you have such tremendous pressure on weeds to tryto survive this herbicide, some of the weeds that are resistant are selected for and all theircompetition is killed off. The resistant weeds then proliferate and can no longer becontrolled by glyphosate. So, now you have a situation where the use of this herbicide hasgone up and on probably millions of acres, other herbicides are having to be used as wellas glyphosate in order to control the resistant weeds.So, what we’ve been seeing in the past few years is the overall level of herbicide useincreasing and it will almost inevitably continue to increase. And in this case, it’s causingthe rise of these resistant weeds and the increased use of herbicides and potentially may beharming amphibians to boot.AND THE HONEY BEES. WITH THE CREATION OF THESE FRANKENSTEINCROPS AND FRANKENSTEIN WEEDS, ISN’T EMERGING A MAJOR QUESTIONABOUT ACCUMULATION? NO ONE REALLY KNOWS THE ANSWER TO HOWMUCH IS TOO MUCH FOR EARTH LIFE? AND THAT THE PILING ON OFHERBICIDES NOW AGAINST RESISTANT WEEDS, MADE RESISTANT THROUGHTHE APPLICATION OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED HERBICIDES, YOU AREINCREASING PESTICIDES OUT THERE IN THE WORLD WITH UNKNOWNCONSEQUENCES?Well, certainly. When the Environmental Protection Agency registers pesticides, it doesquite a bit of testing. But even if that testing does reveal potential risks and has a lot ofvalue, it certainly also has substantial limits. One of those limits is that we often don’t havea good handle on how the interaction between different pesticides can effect organisms.That is not really tested by EPA. EPA-Approved Fungicides Can KillBrood and Young BeesAnother bee expert at the University of California in Davis has discovered that someEPA-approved fungicides that don’t kill adult honey bees, do kill bee larvae and youngbees. Eric Mussen, Ph.D., is an entomologist and Extension Apiculturist at UC-Davis. Heis concerned that some EPA approval criteria only applies to adult honey bees and doesnot protect the larvae brood and young bees."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Recently hatched honey bee larvae are feeding on royal jelly for three days.Only larvae selected to become queens are fed the jelly longerthan three days. Image © by Youngblood.Interview:Eric Mussen, Ph.D., Entomologist and Extension Apiculturist, University ofCalifornia, Davis, California: “If you have something like a fungicide, which does nothurt an adult bee when it’s sprayed in the field, then they (EPA) think it’s just safe forhoney bees. And in some cases, that has not been the truth.Not too long ago, I ran some experiments in the (UC-Davis) lab and found that two of thefungicides that are commonly used out here for controlling diseases on the almond trees, ifyou get too much of it into the laval food of honey bees, it killed the larvae.THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT CURRENTLY THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONAGENCY HAS TESTING REGULATIONS THAT ARE APPLIED TO THE ADULTHONEY BEE, BUT YOU ARE FINDING THAT THOSE LEVELS (OF FUNGICIDE)THAT EPA ACCEPTS ARE KILLING THE BROOD AND THE YOUNG BEES.That’s only happened in a few chemicals, but I guess the answer to that is yes and whatwe were hoping would be that there would also have to be some kind of data generatedbefore a registration (of a pesticide) was processed that talked about what happens (if thepesticide) gets into the immatures.WHEN YOU EXPLAINED THE RESEARCH YOU DID AND WHAT YOU FOUND TOEPA, WHAT DID EPA SAY?Well, they said they wanted to see some evidence or some data. So, I sent them theevidence. And I cannot see that anything has changed since then and that was a couple ofyears ago.” Nicotine-Based Pesticides Interferewith Honey Bee MemoriesIn the past six years, a new group of nicotine-based pesticides have emerged calledneonicotinoids. The most common is imidachloprid. Ironically, these were originallymanufactured to be less lethal. But about four years ago, French and Italian beekeeperscomplained that imidachloprid crop spraying was killing their honey bees. So the Frenchand Italian governments banned the nicotine-based pesticides.American scientists now studying the Colony Collapse Disorder wrote in their firstpreliminary December 15, 2006, report that even though the neonicotinoids will not killadult bees directly on flowers and plants:\"Recent research tested crops where seed was treated with imidacloprid. Thechemical was present, by systemic uptake, in corn, sunflowers and rape pollenin levels high enough to pose a threat to honey bees. Additional research hasfound that imidacloprid impairs the memory and brain metabolism of bees,particularly the area of the brain that is used for making new memories.“Implication: If bees are eating fresh or stored pollen contaminated with these"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"chemicals at low levels, the pesticides might not cause mortality, but mightimpact the bees’ ability to learn or make memories. If this is the case, youngbees leaving the hives to make orientation flights might not be able to learnthe location of the hive and might not be returning, causing the colonies todwindle and eventually die. It is also possible that this is not the sole cause ofthe dwindling, but one of several contributing factors. ”I asked Jerry Hayes, Chief of the Apiary Section for Florida’s Department of Agriculturein Gainesville, about the nicotine-based pesticide’s ability to disable honey bee memory.Interview:Jerry Hayes, Chief, Apiary Section, Florida Dept. of Agriculture, Gainesville,Florida: “The interesting thing about the Colony Collapse Disorder is that bees areleaving the colony and not coming back, which is highly unusual for a social insect toleave a queen and its brood or young behind. They are seemingly going out and can’t findtheir way back home.Imidachloprid, when it is used to control termites, does exactly the same thing. One of themethods it uses to kill termites is that the termites feed on this material and then go out tofeed and can’t remember how to get home. And it also causes their immune systems tocollapse, causing what would be normal organisms to become pathogenic in them (bees).HAVE FARMERS BEEN USING IMIDACHLOPRID MORE THAN THEY HAVE INTHE PAST?I think a couple of things. First, its use has changed. At first it started out as a seedtreatment to protect the seed as it germinated and developed. Now it is being used as afoliage spray, it’s being used as a systemic, it’s being combined with fungicides, whichincreases its efficacy. So, it’s use has changed. Especially systemically, it does what it’ssupposed to do – it takes care of agricultural pests, which we want it to do. But thereseems to be a disconnect sometimes that researchers and horticulturists forget that a honeybee is an insect. And of course, there are other insects out there that are valuablepollinators as well.So, systemically this material (imidachloprid) is found in the nectar - in many cases in lowdoses – not something that would kill a honey bee. So the question is: What does chronicexposure to the honey bee, either as an adult, or as the bees bring the material back to thenest to store and feed to developing young bees over time – what does chronic exposure(to pesticides) do to the colony?” National Academy of Sciences ConcernedAbout General Decline of North American PollinatorsBeyond the honey bees, Something is killing all the pollinators. Pollinators include honeybees, bumble bees, hornets, wasps, butterflies, hummingbirds and even bats. Something ishappening in the environment that is causing all of those different species to decline – andcurrently the most dramatic event is the massive disappearance of honey bees.Jerry Hayes, Chief of the Apiary Section for Florida’s Department of Agriculture inGainesville, told me he was asked in 2006 to speak before the National Academy ofSciences about the serious decline of North American pollinators.Interview:Jerry Hayes, Chief, Apiary Section, Florida Dept. of Agriculture, Gainesville,Florida: “I was able to make a presentation to the National Academy of Sciences lastyear. They produced a report about the loss of pollinators in North America. The federalgovernment asked the National Academy of Sciences to look at this from a strategicstandpoint.[ Editor's Note: Status of Pollinators in North America (2006) by NationalAcademy of Sciences available from National Academies Press."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Bumblebees have been common pollinators like honey beesuntil recent disturbing declines in all North American pollinatorsfor reasons still unknown. Image source Wikipedia.Xerces Society: \"Six years ago, bee taxonomists started to notice a decline inthe abundance and distribution of several bumble bee species. Three of thesespecies (Bombus occidentalis, B. affinis, and B. terricola) were once verycommon and important crop pollinators over their ranges.\"Decline of these species is correlated with a crash in the laboratorypopulations of commercially raised bumble bees, which were distributed forgreenhouse pollination across North America.\"The timing of this suggests that an escaped exotic disease organism (possiblya microsporidian in the genus Nosema) is the cause for the widespread loss.However, this hypothesis is still in need of validation.\"Beyond the bumble bees, threatened North American pollinators now include115 species and subspecies of 57 butterflies, 2 moths, and 55 bees. ]How much of our food production do we want to turn over to other countries that might befriendly now and not friendly in the future? That’s similar to our energy productionproblems right now. So, the federal government is looking at this andmy question is: Are honey bees the canary in the coal mine? What are honey bees trying totell us that we humans should be paying more attention to?This is the most dramatic losses that I’ve seen in my career. I think I’ve heard 80% orhigher losses (of honey bees in at least 24 states). I think they lost 400,000 colonies inPoland and 600,000 in Spain. In Florida, we have some 280,000 registered colonies andwe’re expecting losses in the 35% to 45% range.What insects can you think of that man has a relationship with? There aren’t too manyand honey bees have had a relationship with man for thousands of years and it has beenbeneficial to both species. Now, that is highly in jeopardy.” Does Collapse of Honey BeesMean Future Food Shortages?COULD WE BE LOOKING AT FOOD SHORTAGES AT THE END OF 2007?I suppose if this continued. Then the question is: who fills in the gap? And do we becomereliant on them? I think I read a figure from the USDA that they project by 2015 that 40%of our vegetables would be coming from China. So, maybe the transition is already takingplace. What does this mean for consumers? If they can still get food in the grocery storeand the price is the same, who cares about the honey bees?BUT THAT COMES BACK TO YOUR PRESENTATION AT THE NATIONAL"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"ACADEMY OF SCIENCES AND THE INTEREST OF NATIONAL SECURITY, IF WEEND UP LOSING OUR POLLINATORS IN NORTH AMERICA AND WE AREDEPENDENT UPON CHINA, SOUTH AMERICA AND OTHER COUNTRIES THATMIGHT BECOME POLITICALLY DIFFICULT IN THE FUTURE, WHAT WOULDHAPPEN TO THE U.

But it certainly has gone through my mind.DOES IT SURPRISE YOU THAT SINCE OCTOBER 2006, THERE STILL IS NOT ANANSWER BY MARCH 2007?Yes. We have a lot of incredibly smart people who know honey bees, who knowtoxicology, who know funguses and yeasts, and what have you, working on this andanalyzing this. I would have thought we would have had one of those ‘Aha!’ moments of‘Here it is!’ So, when you don’t have an ‘Aha!’ moment, that tells me that it’s something sobrand new we can’t identify it; or there are multiple things intersecting causing theproblem.” Another important finding about the unpredictable impact that combinations of pesticidescan have was summarized in the Colony Collapse Disorder Working Group's firstpreliminary report of December 15, 2006. \"A study in North Carolina found that some ofthe widely used neonictinoids in combination with certain widely used fungicides(Terraguard and Procure), synergized to increase the toxicity of the neonicotinoid over1,000 times in lab studies.\"[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - Synergy or synergism (from the Greek synergos,meaning working together) refers to the phenomenon in which two or morediscrete influences or agents acting together create an effect greater than thatpredicted by knowing only the separate effects of the individual agents. ]More Information:National Bee Loss SurveyColony Collapse Disorder (CCD) is the latest problem facing bee keepers today.
