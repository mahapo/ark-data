Eyes Like \"Wall Geckos\"IN HER HYPNOSIS, DID BETTY AT ANY TIME DESCRIBE CAT EYES ORVERTICAL PUPILS?Yes, she did. Actually, it was eyes that reminded her of a wall gecko. Betty said their eyeshad a cat-like appearance, but she was talking about the vertical pupil and the positioningon the face.\"Hemitheconyx taylori wall gecko photograph by Jon Boone.Source: http://www.gekkota.com/html/h__taylori.html"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"[ Editor's Note: Geckos are small reptiles with stout bodies, fairly large heads,short legs and long tails. Most species are between 5-15cm from head to tail.There are over 800 species worldwide, living in a variety of habitats fromdeserts to swamps.The gecko is an excellent climber, and can even scamper across ceilings. Thesecret is in its toes. Most geckos have special pads on their feet to help themclimb. These pads have thousands of tiny forked hairs - a bit like velcro -which produce an electrical charge that helps them cling to vertical surfaces.A gecko walks by rolling these hairs onto the surface, then curling up its toesto peel them off again. Geckos are experts at traveling on walls, ceilings andeven the smooth surface of a window-pane.]Missing TimeKathleen Marden: \"Several miles down the road – probably 20 to 30 miles from the fieldwhere Barney observed the UFO – again they saw what appeared to be a flamingred-orange orb in the road, silhouetted against trees. Betty said to Barney, something tothe effect, ‘Do you believe in UFOs?’And he said, ‘Don’t be ridiculous! That was not a UFO.’They next heard another series of beeping or buzzing sounds and at that point, theyregained full consciousness and started to carry on a conversation.When they arrived home, they realized they had arrived later than they had anticipated,even allowing for the observational stops that they made and a period of slow driving. Andcertain things were not right when they arrived home. The tops of Barney’s shoes werescraped and he could not explain how that happened. Barney's binocular strap was brokenand Betty’s dress was torn. There was a 2-inch tear in the top right of her zipper and therewas a 1-inch tear in the top left side of her zipper fabric. Also, her hem was torn down andthe lining of her new dress was torn from hemline to waist. She could not explain that. Shefolded it, put it in her closet and did not remove it until probably some time in 1964 (3years later).The watches they were wearing that night had stopped working and were permanentlydestroyed. There were 12 to 18 circular spots on the trunk of their car the size of silverdollars. They were all exactly the same size and when Betty and Barney observed acompass placed above those spots, it would spin and spin, whereas anywhere else on thecar would drop down (no spinning). So there were these very perplexing pieces ofevidence they had when they arrived home that they could not explain. Shiny, Silver-Dollar-Sized Circles On Hills' CarWAS THERE ANY FORENSIC INVESTIGATION OF THOSE DOLLAR-SIZEDCIRCLES ON THEIR CAR TRUNK?No, there was not, unfortunately. At the time in 1961, Walter Webb visited them a littleover a month from the time they returned – I believe it was October 21. At that time,Webb interviewed them for 6 hours. He did not have a tape recorder. He vaguelyremembered glancing at the spots on the trunk of the car as he passed by, but he did notnotice there was anything that was particularly unusual. [ Editor's Note: No photographswere taken of the shiny circles either.]IT CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE BEEN A DRAMATIC DEMONSTRATION TO SHOWTHAT A COMPASS WOULD SPIN WHEN IT WAS PLACED ON THOSE CIRCLES.It would have been, it certainly would have been. I just wish some type of forensic analysishad been done of those so there would be some scientific evidence there and not justreports from Betty and Barney and other family members who observed this. However,that did not take place and the spots faded away by winter.(Abduction was Sept. 19-20, 1961) Betty and Barney arrived home around 5 AM on themorning of September 20, 1961. It was not until October 21, 1961, that Walter Webbremembered glancing at the spots on the trunk, but they were not in his original report.[ Editor's Note: Walter Webb, an astronomer at Charles Hayden Planetarium,Boston. Webb had worked for astronomer J. Allen Hynek beginning inFebruary 1957 when Dr. Hynek was setting up tracking stations for theSmithsonian Astronomical Observatory. Hynek had hired Webb as a kid out ofcollege sometime that February. Later, J. Allen Hynek would investigate UFO"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"phenomena for the U. S. Air Force and found the Center for UFO Studies(CUFOS).]Betty said she washed and simonized her car every fall and that although she hadsimonized it, the very shiny spots were brighter than the wax on her car. But the spotsgradually faded away and were gone by winter, which I would say was probablyDecember 1961 or January, 1962.DID YOU YOURSELF SEE THE COMPASS SPIN WHEN PLACED ON THOSECIRCLES?It’s difficult for me to remember. I know my mother was there and Betty wasdemonstrating this to my mother. I was standing there and I might have. I definitely did seethe spots. I remember looking at the spots and my two younger brothers were there withme and Betty had the compass in her hand and was showing this to my mother.BETTY TALKED TO YOUR MOTHER ABOUT THE COMPASS SPINNING WHEN ITWAS PLACED ON THOSE BRIGHT CIRCLES ABOUT THE SIZE OF DOLLARS ONTHE CAR?Yes, my mother and Betty talked about it. And Betty and Barney both testified underhypnosis about those spots, too.IT’S ODD THAT NO ONE SAID, ‘LET’S GET A SCIENTIST AND INVESTIGATETHOSE SPOTS.’The U.S. Air Force seemed to have little interest in the case after their initial report.Officially, there was a meeting at the home of Betty and Barney after – I believe it was1962 – where a friend of theirs, who was a USAF officer was reading some poetry. Theirpastor invited Betty and Barney to that meeting and everyone left who was interested inthe poetry. A conversation took place thereafter between the Air Force officers. I believethere was an engineer there and the Hills and the conversation was specifically about thespots on the trunk of the car. They thought it might have been some type of sonar device.BUT THE AIR FORCE NEVER ASKED TO INSPECT THEIR CAR?No, in fact, it seems to me that the U. S. Air Force had already launched a cover-upbecause Betty and Barney were readily available for further interviews, yet the officialUSAF report said they were not available for further interviews.NO INVESTIGATION OR QUESTIONS TO BETTY AND BARNEY HILL FROM THEGOVERNMENT, MILITARY OR ANYBODY ABOUT EXAMINING THE CIRCLESON THEIR CAR?Unfortunately, no, so it will always have to remain a mystery. Anomalous Physical Evidence1) Barney's shoes were scratched on top and under hypnosis he describedfeeling his feet bumping along the ground as he was supported by the beings.2) Barney's binocular strap was broken when they got back to theirPortsmouth home.3) Betty's dress zipper was torn in two places and there were pink stains on it.4) \"Shiny circles\" the size of silver dollars were on the trunk of their car whereeach had heard the electronic \"beeping\" or \"buzzing\" sounds.\"KATHLEEN, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE STRONGEST EVIDENCE THATBETTY AND BARNEY HILL WERE ABDUCTED BY NON-HUMANS FROM THENEW HAMPSHIRE MOUNTAINS BACK IN 1961?I think it was the hypnosis tapes themselves. I did a comparison analysis of Betty andBarney testimonies to Dr. Simon under hypnosis. They were hypnotized separately andgiven post-hypnotic suggestion for amnesia so they could not discuss information witheach other.I compared what each of them said to Betty’s dreams or recall, which was written inNovember 1961 by Betty about a series of dreams that she had 10 to 14 days after shearrived home after having a close encounter with a UFO. She had these dreams early in themorning just before she woke up. Barney was not in bed with her at the time because he"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"was working nights. The dreams were disturbing. She wrote, jotted them down onnotepaper. Then a couple of months later, Betty wrote them into a report of her dreams.What I found was that Betty and Barney were giving information regarding variousdescriptive details and also positional information: where each was at a particular time.When I compared the information to Betty’s dreams, it was entirely different frominformation in Betty’s dreams – yet, without being able to communicate that informationone to the other (post hypnotic amnesia), Betty and Barney were saying the same thing.So, I thought that was very important.Additionally, there was Betty’s dress. The forensic and chemical analysis that was done onBetty’s dress most recently by Phyllis Budinger, an analytical chemist from Ohio. Therewas a pink powdery substance that Betty found on her dress. Phyllis noticed that those arethe areas where the aliens would have grasped Betty and the areas where they would havetouched the fabric of the dress. There was a very high level of bacteria on the pinkpowdery substance areas, while the bacteria was low in other areas of the dress. It’s oddthat the bacteria would be only in the pink powder areas of the dress.\"Return to Part 1More Information:Autographed copies of Captured! can be ordered for $18.99, including shipping:- From Stanton Friedman's web site using PayPal.- From Kathleen Marden, P.
