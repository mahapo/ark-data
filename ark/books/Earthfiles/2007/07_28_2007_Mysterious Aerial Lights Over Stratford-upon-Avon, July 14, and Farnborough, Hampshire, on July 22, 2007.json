K. Eyewitness July 27, 2007 Stratford-upon-Avon, Warickshire, and Farnborough, Hampshire,England - In the Midlands of Great Britain in the county of Warwickshire isShakespeare’s home town called Stratford-upon-Avon, not to be confused with a suburb ofLondon called Stratford.Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, England, (upper left corner)is 102 miles northwest of London.A pub in Stratford-upon-Avon called The Lone Elm on Birmingham Road in the center oftown made headlines recently when at least eight of its employees and about one hundredpub visitors all watched orange lights move in formation in the sky. The lights stopped stillin a pattern that did not change for nearly a half hour. And no sound. One of the pubvisitors was Tom Hawkes, a local resident who works in Customer Care for the BritishLand Rover company. He had his Olympus digital camera that can take both still framesand up to 40 minutes of videotape with the click of a button. Tom taped at least fiveminutes of the lights. One of his video frames was used by the Stratford-Herald in the firstnews story about the event. I talked with him today about what happened. July 14, 2007, five unidentified aerial objects above the One Elm Pubin Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire, England. More than a hundred"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"people watched the silent lights for about thirty minutes untilthe lights \"switched off.\" Image © 2007 Tom Hawkes.See Tom Hawkes video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MJl-YTuYo8Tom Hawkes, Land Rover Customer Care, Wellesbourne, Warwickshire, U. K.: “On Saturday, July 14, 2007, we were out for my girlfriend’s birthday having drinks withsome friends. I had my Olympus still/video digital camera which has 40 minutes of videocapacity. We were sitting outside the pub, which is a favorite drinking hole of ours. It wasabout 10:30 PM and we noticed four lights appear in the sky, sort of coming from our righthand side, from the southeast. They were flying in formation, which immediately drew ourattention to them.HOW MANY OF YOU ARE LOOKING THAT MOMENT UP IN THE SKY?On the table, there were at least 15 of them that all worked up. There was also a chef whoworked on the restaurant side of the pub. (Kern Griffiths) I don’t know if you have everseen military aircraft flying in formation either in training. You’ve seen the film,Blackhawk Down, when they are all flying in a sort of straight line formation. And theimmediate thing was that there were four lights that came over the rooftops and becausethey were flying in a straight line formation, we thought it could be military, maybehelicopters going back to base. It was a steady motion and they were sort of orangishlights.Then a fifth orange light flew over the town a lot faster, slowed down maneuvering intoposition to sort of finish off the fifth position in the formation. It ended up looking like astar constellation. The five lights seemed to stay in that formation in the sky for quiteawhile. A lot of people were coming into the pub and leaving the pub and everybodyseemed to be looking up at that formation of lights. Eventually it was like somebodyturned out a light switch and the lights disappeared.Close-up unidentified lights after the fifth on far right came in rapidly from the southeast,slowed down and maneuvered into this position, forming a \"constellation\" pattern that remainedvisible to at least a hundred people at The One Elm pub in Stratford-upon-Avon for nearly a halfhour before all five lights disappeared \"like somebody turned out a light switch.\" Video frame © 2007 by Tom Hawkes.DID YOU HEAR ANY SOUND?No, that was the eerie thing about it. There was absolutely no noise whatsoever. We wereat a fairly busy pub in town, but if it had been military helicopters, you would have heardit. Even one helicopter, I think we would have heard, but with five, we certainly wouldhave heard some noise. There were no flashing lights whatsoever, just a plain light. Just sostrange. That’s why I contacted my local paper (Stratford-Herald).” Not J apanese Lanterns,Says Stratford-Herald ReporterI talked with the Stratford-Herald reporter who first interviewed Tom Hawkes. His nameis Duncan Smith and he is surprised that another news story has surfaced two weeks afterthe event, trying to explain the half-hour formation of orange lights over the pub asJapanese lanterns that drifted from a backyard party.But reporter, Duncan Smith, says here are the facts:- The half-hour light event over The One Elm pub in Stratford-upon-Avon wasseen by at least 100 people between 10:30 and 11 PM on Saturday, July 14,2007.- Now two weeks later on July 27th, and only in the last couple of days, didthe Stratford-Herald receive two phone calls from people who only left cellphone numbers and would not give any professional affiliation. The callerssaid the answer to the mysterious orange lights above the pub were Japaneselanterns that had drifted from a party.However, Duncan Smith told me today:"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"- On Saturday, July 14th, it was very windy.- The five unidentified orange lights came from the southeast. The partyaddress was four miles northwest of the pub – the complete opposite directionfrom which the five lights came.Duncan Smith and I discussed the possibility that yet again Someone In Authority with amisinformation agenda is floating a false story to muddy the waters about a genuinelymysterious aerial phenomenon. Farnborough, Hampshire , England -Sunday, July 22, 2007[ Editor's Note: Video of Farnborough lights was mailed by Kenneth Parsonsto Earthfiles three weeks ago, but video has still not arrived. Another is beingmailed and will be added to this report when available.]Farnborough, Hampshire, England, is 40 miles south of London.The mysterious lights don’t end over The One Elm Pub on July 14th. The next weekend,on Sunday, July 22, about 150 miles away in Farnborough, Hampshire, 61-year-old HilaryPorter was doing a night watch from her upstairs bedroom. Hilary’s home is at the highestpoint in Farnborough and she has clear views of the skies in all directions. Fifteen yearsago, Hilary and her partner, Kenneth Parsons, formed the British Earth and AerialMysteries Society (BEAMS) to keep track of unusual events in England. That’s why shedoes lots of skywatches.Hilary Porter, Founder and Vice Chairman, British Earth and Aerial MysteriesSociety (BEAMS), Farnborough, Hampshire, England: “It was Sunday night, July 22,2007. It was coming up to 10:50 PM. The weather has been bad and it was one of the fewclear nights for a sky watch. I had been watching for a quarter of an hour – and bear inmind that my house is the highest in Farnborough. And I can see at least twenty miles outto the south of the area and skies all the way around.Visibility was really clear, but nothing was happening. Just as I thought I would go ontobed, appearing out of nowhere was this beautiful red orb. It was absolutely fantastic! Ihave binoculars, 25 x 60, and got a check on it. Then I rushed down to Kenneth and said,‘Get up here quick! Bring your camera!’He came running upstairs to where we skywatch and got his camera ready to photograph.The red orb suddenly disappeared, popped out, no fading. But then another one appearedsuddenly. Through the binoculars, I could see that it was disc-shaped, slightly flatter thanspherical. It seemed to have little circles within the red orb form.In comparison to sizes around me on the ground that the red orb was no less than twentyfeet in diameter. Then another one appeared. Counting the one I saw before Kenny got upwith his camera, we saw nine red orbs in all that night and Ken has videotaped several ofthem, which we’re going to send to you for use at Earthfiles."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The most amazing was when it went into the triangle shape. There had been four lights andone moved slightly away leaving a perfect triangle of three orbs.”Above: Four of nine red, glowing spheres (red color washed out in wide video image)that appeared above the home of Hilary Porter in Farnborough, Hampshire, England, onSunday evening, July 22, 2007. The bottom two lights are street lights. Below: After firstfive lights had come and gone, \"popping on and off,\" four remained and eventuallyformed a triangle. All images © 2007 by Hilary Porter and Kenneth Parsons,British Earth and Aerial Mysteries Society. “The red orbs popped in individually until we saw five or six of them. Then four of themformed in the sky toward the end of the sighting, forming a triangle with a fourth orb off aways. That fourth one moved down slightly and then disappeared and left three, whichformed the triangle.DID YOU SEE ANY OF THE RED ORBS TRAVEL RAPIDLY FROM A DISTANCE UPTO THE ONES YOU WERE SEEING?Yes, one or two came up like they were in a pair, very close to each other. They thenwould just vanish.When the fifth orb came and lasted for about 20 seconds, then that suddenly went. Butwas followed by four more, all of a sudden: one, two, three, four. Three in the triangleformation. One at the base of the triangle off side. That stayed for quite awhile and Kenmanaged to get good footage of it. Then the fourth one to the side moved slightly and thenpopped out, or dematerialized. I don’t know what. The other three were there for a goodbit longer. Then we didn’t see anymore after that.DID ALL THREE IN THE TRIANGLE DISAPPEAR AT THE SAME TIME?They went out one, two, three, quickly.”"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Kenneth Parsons: “The lights appeared rather like turning on a light with a switch. Theyjust suddenly came on and they just switched off.WHAT DID YOU SEE WITH YOUR OWN EYES?First I saw one orb there in the sky when I got upstairs with the camera. Then that orbwent out. Then a few minutes later, they came on one after the other. The photo I sent youwith the three red lights - first the formation was like that with a line of three orbs. Then Ithink one of those went out. Then another appeared and moved into the triangle pattern.The fourth one off to the left blinked on and off a couple of times and then disappeared. Then there were three in the triangle. Then two. Then one. Then that last one went out.That first line in my photograph, I was zooming into it so you really get the red. That toplight went out, which left two. Then another light appeared to the left of the group andthen it formed a perfect triangle. That triangle stayed there for about a minute or so. I’mnot sure. Then one by one, they switched off, blink, blink, blink.WHAT COMMON RED WOULD WE ALL KNOW THAT WAS LIKE THE RED ORBS?The red of traffic lights – an illuminated electric red.COULD YOU HEAR ANY SOUND?No. We had the windows wide open for the videotaping. I was hanging out a window withthe camcorder and I couldn’t hear anything except the roar of the traffic on the road.KENNETH, WHEN YOU WERE LOOKING THROUGH YOUR CAMERA AND USINGYOUR LENS ON THE JULY 22ND RED ORBS, DID YOU SEE DETAIL IN ANY OFTHOSE ORBS?Yeah, I did actually. It was concentric rings filled with little dots and circles. Hilary sawthe same thing through her binoculars. It was like on an archery target, but within eachring there were lots of little dots or round things in the rings and they were all red.WITHIN EACH CONCENTRIC RING, YOU WERE SEEING MORE CIRCLES INSIDEOF THE CONCENTRIC RINGS?Ye s .WERE THOSE RINGS MOVING?I was so flabbergasted, I didn’t really notice if anything was moving inside those rings.There was structure inside those red lights, but something weird. Not like nuts and boltsand metal. Very strange to look at.IT WAS NOT AN ARTIFACT OF YOUR CAMERA LENS ZOOM?No, Hilary saw the same concentric rings through her binoculars. They are powerfulbinoculars what the sea captain use in England. So she got a real good look at these thingsand we don't know what they were. We had never seen them before on any aerial object.”More Information:If anyone has photographed and/or videotaped unusual aerial lights, please contact me onor off the record at earthfiles@earthfiles.com.And see NEW DVD RELEASE – Extraordinary Documentary!The VisitorPhenomenon: The Story of Jim Spark Click to Earthfiles Shop.For further information about aerial phenomena, please see reports below in EarthfilesArchive:• 07/13/2007 — Iowa Minister Reports Large \"Crab/Scorpion\" Creature Attacked Cow• 06/17/2007 — More Big Basin, California, Bizarre \"Drone\" Images• 06/15/2007 — Part 2 - Star Wars Physicist Edward Teller, Outer Space Menace And Remotely PilotedVe hi c l e s ( RPVs )• 06/08/2007 — More Drone Photos and Other Eyewitnesses• 05/30/2007 — Birmingham-Type \"Drone\" Seen At Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, in Mid-1980s• 05/29/2007 — Final Part 7: Eyewitness Links Animal Mutilations to Non-Humans• 05/28/2007 — Letters About Unidentified \"Drone\" Aerial Objects• 05/25/2007 — Two More Eyewitnesses of Aerial \"Drones\" in 2005 and 2006• 05/21/2007 — Updated: Odd Aerial \"Drone\"?
