Arndt says the 1945 Nazi Die Glocke , or Bell, “represented something at the very pinnacle of SS General Hans Kammler's occult and super-secret SS ‘wonder weapons’ empire.” In this Earthfiles report, the phrase Die Glocke is used as a general name for all the series of round, aerial machines associated with German SS research before and during World War II, including the Bell, Vril and Haunebu.

Arndt: “The following are the salient features of The Bell, according to information Cook received from both German and Czech sources. “(1) The Bell was reportedly a metallic object, approximately 9 feet in diameter and 12 - 15 feet tall. “(2) It looked like a bell; hence, its codename to the Germans, die Glocke. “(3) It was comprised of two counter-rotating cylinders, rotating a purplish, liquid-metallic-looking substance at high speeds that was code-named ‘Xerum 525’ by the Germans. “(4) Xerum 525 was apparently highly radioactive, purple in color, and was housed in cylinders with lead lining about 30 centimeters (12 inches) thick."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"“(5) The Bell apparently required high amounts of electrical power in its operation. “(6) During use, it could only be run for approximately one to two minutes, as it apparently gave off strong radiation and/or other electromagnetic or unknown field effects. (a) Several scientist died on its first operation. (b) Subsequent tests included various plants and animals, all of which decomposed into a blackish goo and without normal putrefaction, within a matter of a few minutes or hours after exposure to its field effects when in operation. (c) Technicians near the Bell during these experiments reported metallic tastes in their mouths after being exposed to it. (d) The chamber in which the Bell was tested was lined with ceramic bricks and rubber mats, and had to have its rubber matting removed and burned after each test. It was subsequently washed down with brine by inmates from nearby concentration camps. “(7) All the scientists and witnesses who saw or worked on the Bell were allegedly murdered by the SS as the war neared its end. “ (8) The Bell was transplanted out of Silesia to a destination that has never been discovered. [ Silesia is an historical region of Central Europe located in contemporary Poland, the Czech Republic and Germany.] The Bell, along with General Kammler himself, simply disappeared entirely from history, never to be seen again. It is believed, however, that both the Bell and General Kammler were transported by U-boat to a base outside of the Reich (Base 211 in Neu Schwabenland, Antarctica being the strongest candidate). Others suggest Norway where German troops still held that territory. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - General Dr. Hans Friedrich Karl Franz Kammler was an engineer and high-ranking officer of the German SS. He oversaw SS construction projects, and towards the end of World War II was put in charge of the V-2 missile program. Kammler was also charged with constructing facilities for various secret weapons projects, including manufacturing plants and test stands for the Messerschmitt Me 262 and V-2. Following the Allied bombing raids on Peenemünde in Operation Hydra in August 1943, Kammler was assigned to move those production facilities underground. [ Disc and bell shaped machines were described by eyewitnesses as rising silently from an underground installation at Peenemunde.) General Kammler constructed the Mittelwerk facility and its attendant concentration camp complex, Mittelbau-Dora, which housed slave labor for constructing the factory and working on the production lines. He was also assigned to the construction of facilities at Jonastal and Riesengebirge for nuclear weapons research and at Ebensee to develop an ICBM derived from a V-2. From January 1945, Kammler was placed as head of all missile projects and in February 1945 was given charge of all German aerospace programs under the SS authority as well. “(9) A strange Stonehenge-like structure was constructed by the Germans out of reinforced concrete near the facility where the Bell was located and tested. This structure might have been used to test extremely powerful propulsion devices.”"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"S trange Stonehenge-like structure discovered after WWII near the Ludwikowice Kodzkie (Ludwigsdorf) coal mine in the Selesia region of Germany.

Interview Continued: J im Marrs, Journalist and Author, The Rise of the Fourth Reich © 2008, Wade County, Texas. Jim Marrs, Journalist and Author, Wise County, Texas: “ONE OF THE MOST FASCINATING SECTIONS IN YOUR BOOK IS IN CHAPTER 3 ENTITLED ‘NAZI"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"WONDER WEAPONS.’ ON PAGE 87, YOU WRITE: ‘TIME TRAVELING NAZIS – THIS HORRENDOUS IDEA SOUNDS PREPOSTEROUS, BUT THE SCIENCE IS THERE AND THE BELL DID EXIST.’ EXPLAIN WHAT THE BELL WAS TO HITLER’S NAZIS AND WHY IT IS LINKED TO TIME TRAVEL. Well, the bell – and even today, there are attempts to duplicate the experiments they were conducting on the bell. It was simply called the bell because it was kind of a bell-shaped object. This object had an outer chamber and inner chamber and created electromagnetic energy fields that were set into rotation movement. Then one layer would rotate clockwise; the other layer would rotate counter-clockwise. In doing this, it increased the power and the efficiency of this energy field generator. In doing so, there were some very unusual properties. Around the bell, plants either blossomed and grew, or withered and died; people would die around this thing. This plays into some of the stories that we’ve heard from other sectors such as the infamous Philadelphia Experiment, experiments with energy and magnetic fields that apparently altered the whole composition of material objects, including people. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - Operation Ghost was an alleged naval military experiment at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on or about October 28, 1943. The U. S. destroyer escort, USS Eldridge, was to be rendered invisible to human observers for a brief period in what was called Project Rainbow. Allegedly conducting the experiment was Franklin Reno (or Rinehart), Ph.D., as a military application of the Unified Field Theory theorized by physicist Albert Einstein. The Unified Field Theory describes the interrelated nature of the weak and strong forces and electromagnetic and gravitational forces. To date, no single theory has emerged with a viable mathematical expression. It is said that Reno et al thought it might be possible to use some version of this theory to bend light around an object so that it became essentially invisible. This would have required specialized equipment and sufficient energy. The Navy saw the military value and sponsored the experiment. The USS Eldridge would have been fitted with the required equipment at the naval yards in Philadelphia. According to some accounts, one test on July 22, 1943, resulted in the Eldridge being rendered almost completely invisible, with some witnesses reporting a ‘greenish fog’ in its place. Crew members allegedly complained of severe nausea afterwards. By October 28, 1943, it is said in another test the Eldridge ‘teleported’ and appeared 215 miles south of Philadelphia offshore the Norfolk, Virginia, naval base, then disappeared before eyewitnesses in Norfolk and reappeared at the Philadelphia naval ship yards. It has been reported that one of the men on the ship was found embedded in a brick wall in Italy and some others in the crew went mad. No hard evidence in government records of such a ship teleportation have ever publicly surfaced.] Was Die Glocke Non-Human Technology? TODAY, IN 2008, GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOU AND I AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT LT. COL. PHILIP J. CORSO OF OUR OWN U. S. ARMY DESCRIBED AS EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES, DO YOU THINK THERE IS ANY HARD EVIDENCE THAT GERMANY HAD NON-HUMAN INTELLIGENCE HELP, EITHER BUILDING THESE BELL CRAFT? OR THAT THEY ARE LITERALLY NON-HUMAN CRAFT THAT WERE PLACED UNDERGROUND IN THE PEENEMUNDE REGION OF GERMANY AND LED TO THE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES OF THE HITLER REICH? That’s a really fascinating question, Linda, and I try to address that in my book , The Rise of the Fourth Reich . For years I had heard stories that the Nazis had captured a flying disc, or a flying saucer and had back-engineered it. [ Die Glocke, the Bell, is the name of a purported secret Nazi weapon that was made popular by Jane's aviation writer, Nick Cook, in his book Hunt for Zero Point. ] But every time you try to track those stories, they just seem to peter out. There’s no real hard evidence that anything like that ever happened. And now what I and several other researchers are coming to the conclusion is that beginning in the early 1920s, just like in America, in Germany there was a resurgence of interest in spiritualism and in the occult. And we can trace Hitler and some of his handlers directly into some of these occult societies, such as the Vril or Thule Society."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"What seems to have happened in an early day version of remote viewing, or perhaps what we would call channeling, they did come in contact with non-human intelligences, which this contact then provided them with clues – if not direct knowledge – of technology that was far beyond what the Allies were able to come up with. This is one of the key explanations for how the Nazis were able to continue on after WWII. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT SUPPORTS STRONGLY THAT THE BELL WAS TRULY EXTRATERRESTRIAL TECHNOLOGY MADE BY TALL, BLOND-HAIRED, BLUE-EYED HUMANOIDS AND THAT WAS WHY HITLER HAD AN OBSESSION ABOUT A SUPER RACE OF TALL, BLOND, BLUE-EYED PEOPLE? I think that falls under conjecture, but informed conjecture. There is no question that Hitler, who was kind of short and dark-haired – he certainly did not match the description of the Aryan Superman. Nevertheless, he and his SS were obviously just fixated on the idea of the tall, blond, blue-eyed Nordic German Aryan. Now, where did that come from? So, I think the assumption that it came from their channeling or remote viewing experiences with the Nordic E. T.s, as has been described by numerous experiencers, I think that might be valid. But, we really don’t have any hard proof of that. THE BELL THAT NAZI GERMANY APPARENTLY HAD AT PEENEMUNDE MIGHT BE TRULY AN EXAMPLE OF AN EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITY TECHNOLOGY? E. T. technology, that’s true. And the difference here is that in discussing the tall, Nordic blond E.T.s, all we have are narratives. There does not seem to be any hard evidence of their existence. And yet, when it comes to the Nazi bell, we have living witnesses who were involved in that project who have described it. We have the physical remains of some of the testing facilities. The ruins are still there (the Selesia region on the border of Germany and Poland.) They are very real. They do exist. So, there is more physical evidence support for the Nazi bell technology than there is for the tall, blond Aryan E.T.s. Die Glocke and Time Travel WHY WAS THE BELL LINKED TO TIME TRAVEL? Because when you get these counter-rotating vortices of energy fields, apparently it can negate gravity. Of course, anti-gravity is something that we’ve been searching for over a very long time. Apparently what happens is that if you negate gravity, you concurrently are negating time. This gets back into the missing time element within so many of the UFO sighting reports. People say, ‘Well, I saw this UFO at 6 PM and I didn’t get home until 7 PM, and yet it’s only a ten minute drive. What happened to the missing time?’ It’s well known in the literature that when the UFO comes over, the car stops, right? And yet, when the UFO moves away, the car starts again. But, no one ever talks about turning on the starter or turning the key. No, the car stops and then it starts. That’s because in the energy fields around the car, time stops as well as gravity is neutralized and that’s what holds the UFO up in the air. The pistons, which were pounding away in the car engine freeze – they just stop because time has stopped. Then when the energy field moves off, the pistons go back to banging again and the car motor is running again. So, this is the correlation between gravity and time. If you have this E. T. technology that can negate gravity, then you can also negate time, which indicates you might be able to move within time. And that raises the distinct possibility of time travel. We’re talking about the bell project, which definitely existed. And we’re talking about some of the theoretical effects of the bell, but the main problem is that not much is known about the bell. It’s all been kept top secret and I personally believe that the secrets of the bell are still in certain files a ccessible by certain globalist factions today. Notice, I did not say the U. S. government because the U. S. government implies your local IRS agent and your postmen and your local representatives and they don’t have a clue! No, this power of technology is being kept very close to the chest by the people who see it as a means to power and control. WHERE DID ALL THE ALLEGED BELL-SHAPED, OR DISC-SHAPED, CRAFT GO AFTER WORLD WAR II? Good question. I don't know anyone who knows."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Rise of Fourth Reich in America? WHAT IS YOUR GREATEST FEAR GOING FORWARD FROM JULY 2008? I don’t think there is any easy remedy for Washington, D.C. It’s so out of control, so over-bloated, so convoluted, so corrupt that there’s not going to be any way, short of just a massive march on Washington to tell everybody there to go and get a real job - and that ain’t going to happen. SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE FATE OF THE UNITED STATES? Well, I do think we’re kind of at a crossroads and I think it’s going to be a foot race to see whether enough people wake up and we begin to take charge of our own lives and our own communities and our own neighborhoods. Hermann Goering at Nuremberg said, ‘Getting the people to go along with the leaders is no big deal. It’s no secret. You just tell them they’ve been attacked and then you describe anyone who protests as unpatriotic.’ And we see that happening today in the United States!” More Information : T he Rise of the Fourth Reich © 2008 by Jim Marrs, published by William Morrow, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers.
