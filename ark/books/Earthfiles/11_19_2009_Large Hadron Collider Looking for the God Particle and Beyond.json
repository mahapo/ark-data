These microscopic-black-holes would decay into ordinary particles in a tiny fraction of a second and would be very difficult to observe in our atmosphere. The ATLAS Experiment offers the exciting possibility to study them in the lab (if they exist). The simulated collision event shown is viewed along the beampipe.

November 19, 2009 CERN Geneva, Switzerland - Beginning Friday night, November 20, 2009, on the border between Switzerland and France, not far from Geneva, and three hundred feet underground, humans will try again to start producing subatomic energies close to those in the Big Bang. By early Saturday morning, the first beam of particles should be circulating one way around the LHC’s 17-mile-long underground ring. Then a second beam traveling in the opposite direction should start soon after. But the first low-energy collisions won't happen until about a week later. The goal is to understand how the cosmos is put together at the subatomic level that creates our matter worlds along with mysterious dark matter, dark energy and the quantum theory of supersymmetry. The European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN, has built the world's largest particle physics laboratory called the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC. Hadrons are particles made of quarks held together by the strong force. Proton collisions in the collider near the speed of light might finally reveal other particles and extra dimensions theorized in modern physics. A year ago on September 10, 2008, as the LHC was being revved up for proton collision tests, faulty wiring and weak welds tore a hole in the accelerator's wall, melted down several large superconducting magnets and released liquid helium into the tunnel. See: September 2008 2-Part Earthfiles After a whole year of many repairs and improvements, CERN scientists and engineers are getting ready for actual proton collisions. What might come out of high-energy collisions could be the illusive Higgs boson that has never been detected, but which physicists think is responsible for the mass of every particle and is a key to cosmic construction. That's why it's affectionately called the “God particle.” Recently physicists at the Niels Bohr Institute hypothesized that Nature itself is interfering with discovery of the Higgs boson by using the future to sabotage the Large Hadron Collider. On top of that was last year's unfounded rumor that mini-black holes could be created by the LHC and destroy Earth. But CERN is made up of sixty European member states representing 500 universities. At least 10,000 physicists are eager for the LHC to work at high energy and none are worried about mini-black holes or interference from the future. If all goes well, by Christmas the LHC will be running in 2.2 trillion electronvolt tests. Then by February 2010, the plan is to rev up the LHC to at least three times the maximum energy of the Fermi Lab in Chicago, Illinois. Fermi is in friendly competition with LHC physicists to be the first to discover the Higgs boson. In fact University of Michigan research physicist and muon particle expert, Steven Goldfarb, Ph.D., has a bet with one of his CERN colleagues that his muon spectrometer in the ATLAS experiment, one of four that will be active in the LHC, will be the first to discover the Higgs boson. Recently I talked with him about the LHC getting back to work amid public and media"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"nervousness about mini-black holes and sabotage from the future.

Interview: S teven Goldfarb, Ph.D., Muon Spectrometer Investigator, ATLAS Experiment, CERN and Univ. of Michigan, Geneva, Switzerland: “When we get up to the first collisions, which will be at 1 TeV – that’s a thousand, billion electron volts (EVs) – when we get there and make collisions, the actual energy of those collisions is something similar to a fly flapping its wings. So in human terms, it is extremely low energy. In terms for us and our capability to create dense collisions of this sort, it’s higher energy than we’ve ever been before. SINCE THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST NERVOUSLY ANTICIPATED EXPERIMENTS OF ALL TIME GIVEN THE FACT THAT A YEAR AGO BEFORE THERE WAS THE MELT DOWN OF THE SEVERAL HUGE SUPER-CONDUCTING MAGNETS, THERE HAD BEEN AN EFFORT TO TRY TO STOP THE ENTIRE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER COMPLETELY BECAUSE OF THE FEAR THAT MINI-BLACK HOLES WOULD BE CREATED AND THAT THE EARTH COULD END UP BEING DESTROYED – THAT WAS ONE ISSUE. AND THE SECOND ISSUE NOW RAISED IN THE END OF 2009 HAS COME FROM THE THEORETICAL WORK OF HOLGER NIELSEN (NIELS BOHR INSTITUTE) IN WHICH HE IS SAYING THE VERY ACT OF TRYING TO FIND THE HIGGS BOSON COULD PROVOKE SOME HOW THE UNIVERSE FROM THE FUTURE TO STOP THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER. AS A PHYSICIST WORKING THERE RIGHT NOW WITH MUONS. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT BOTH OF THOSE ISSUES? I’d love to. It’s very fun when people have great imaginations and it has certainly brought us into the spotlight. But let me start by addressing the first issue, which was in fact raised years before we started (the LHC project) – the issue that we were going to create mini-black holes and destroy the Earth. Those (protesting) were not scientists! There were absolutely no scientists who would say there was any possibility whatsoever of causing"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"any damage. Let me explain why I’m so confident in the fact that this is a fallacy. This can’t happen (creation of black hole that would swallow Earth). Ask anyone in physics and they will tell you that. The reason is that at the LHC – even though we’re building the biggest collider ever built going to the highest energy, what we’re going to create when we have collisions in the center of the LHC has already been done by Mother Nature tens of thousands of times before and I’m just talking about in our own solar system, for example. There are cosmic rays out there in space of very high energy and there are plenty of them. During this conversation, anybody listening has had muons pass through them hundreds of times. So these things are going on already and all we’re doing in the LHC is bringing these particles together in one place under what I would call giant microscopes. Our detectors are essentially microscopes designed to look at the smallest bits of Nature. The LHC accelerator is just going to concentrate and bring all these guys together in a place where we can measure them. Now, since Mother Nature has been doing this tens of thousands of times over already and the world is still here – black holes have not been created here b ecause of these processes. So, you can say with pretty good confidence that we’re not going to be able to do that (make black holes). Now, the reason that the word ‘black hole’ came into play at all is because there was a very fascinating theory that was brought up by a theorist from Harvard University asked, ‘What if there are extra dimensions out there?’ We can’t perceive these other dimensions easily, and yet they are there. And it could be possible that when we go to the energy density of the collisions we have at the LHC, it could be possible we’ll get a little view of these. It could explain, for example, why gravity is so weak – that we’re only seeing a little part of gravity in our dimension. One of the views we have is that if we were able to measure this that we would see what are called ‘mini-black holes.’ These would be things that would just appear and disappear in an instance and the trace we would have of them would be a bunch of particles that all shot out. We would see a bunch of particles shooting out from it and that’s it! We won’t see the Earth disintegrating, but we’ll see something new. It’s a black hole in the technical sense. It’s not in the sense that we know black holes that everyone is familiar with and are created by enormous masses, by huge stars that have grown old and decayed and collapsed in on themselves and there is a tremendous amount of mass out there creating that. We (at LHC) are way on the other end of the scale! So anything we create will disappear instantly and give us some small tr aces. That would be exciting to see that. IT WOULD BE EXCITING IF YOU ACTUALLY DID CAPTURE EVIDENCE OF A MINI-BLACK HOLE BEING CREATED. Yes, we would be thrilled! It would give us a new picture of why there is such a wide range of forces out there and give us some idea where to look in the future for new physics. Higgs Boson Search Prov oking Cosmic Sabotage? WHAT ABOUT THE CURRENT HEADLINES FROM HOLGER NIELSEN’S HYPOTHESIS THAT THE SEARCH FOR A HIGGS BOSON PARTICLE ALONE MIGHT BE PROVOKING THE UNIVERSE IN THE FUTURE TO BE TRYING SOME HOW TO HALT THE DISCOVERY OF THIS HIGGS BOSON AT THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER? That’s amazing! It’s amazing science fiction stuff! I mean, someone should write a movie about this. (laughs) From our point of view, it was a bad welding job (melt down of magnets) and we can measure the mistakes that we made. These (wiring and welding mistakes) to me are pretty mundane things and to try to blame some particle from the future telling us, ‘No, we don’t want you to discover me!’ It takes an excellent imagination! Most of the theorists I have talked to who have read through it (Nielsen’s paper) came to the same conclusion, ‘This is garbage.’ Higgs Boson, the “God Particle”"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"A diagram in Standard Model particle physics of Higgs boson interaction with other subatomic particles. Black circles represent types of particles, and blue arcs connecting them represent interactions that can take place. The organization of the diagram is as follows: the top row of leptons and quarks are the matter particles; the second row of photons, W/Zs and gluons are the force mediating particles; and the bottom row is the Higgs boson. Illustration source Steven Goldfarb. DR. GOLDFARB, WHY IS THE HIGGS BOSON REFERRED TO AS A ‘GOD PARTICL E’? It plays a fundamental role in that all of the other particles interact with it. We assumed that the Higgs boson existed because if we don’t assume in our current particle theory that the Higgs exists, the whole theory falls apart! So this is one of the reasons we are really looking for it. We call it the particle that gives other particles mass, and it’s just fundamental in our theory. The photons that give us light interact with everything that is charged. The Higgs boson interacts with everything that has mass and that’s the vast majority of our particles. So, it plays an extremely important and fundamental role and we would have to find some other explanation if it didn’t exist. So our understanding relies on its existence and will change dramatically if it does not exist. Our theories have to hold up to lots of tests. If you want it to hold up, it had better have a very strong mortar holding those bricks together. And I think really that the Higgs boson is a mortar holding all of this theory together. You can maybe take out a brick, replace it, put in a window and it’s not going to change the theory dramatically. I think of the Higgs really as this mortar that is holding that building together. If we don’t find it, we’ve got to find something else to hold it together, or our whole theory will come tumbling down. IF THE HIGGS BOSON IS THE MORTAR AMONG PARTICLES, WHY IS IT SO ILLUSIVE? WHY HAS IT BEEN SO DIFFICULT TO FIND? Well, it manifests itself as a particle and that particle simply is more massive than other particles that we’ve had the ability to create. The Higgs is not necessarily so illusive. If the Higgs is there the way we predict it in the simplest of all models, it’s been there all the time. We just haven’t been able to see it because we haven’t had the tools to see it. There are galaxies out there in space that have been there for nearly the lifetime of the universe. They are not being illusive. They are just so far away that we couldn’t see them until we built the Hubble telescope. And the Higgs boson is just more massive than anything we’ve been able to look at up until now. Will LHC Beat Fermi Lab in Race to Find Higgs Boson? SO THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER WILL BE THE ONLY INSTRUMENT ON EARTH THAT COULD HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO FIND THE HIGGS BOSON PARTICL E? We think so. We have a lot of our colleagues are working at Fermi lab in two experiments. Those two experiments are colliding photons and antiprotons at 1 GeV a piece – something we hope to do with the LHC next month (December 2009). Fermi is looking as hard as they can to find the Higgs boson and why not find it before us? It’s a good, healthy"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"competition. They are working very hard to see if they can find it first. Depending upon the mass of the Higgs boson, it could be possible for Fermi to find it before we can get going with the LHC and understand our data enough to surpass them. If Fermi doesn’t find it in the next year or so, and the LHC works as smoothly as we expect it to work, within a year or so, it’s time to turn off Fermi lab because we will have passed them. Then we will be the only kid on the block with a big enough baseball bat to hit the home run. IF YOU DON’T FIND THE HIGGS BOSON PARTICLE THEN AT THE LHC, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT IN TERMS OF PARTICLE PHYSICS? If we don’t find the Higgs boson as we think of it as a simple particle, we will certainly find something else – something that will give us a clue and it will be at some certain mass that it will appear. [ Editor’s Note: Beyond LHC is International Linear Collider (ILC) to change from going around in a circle to a straight line for more power to measure the Higgs boson in as detailed a manner as possible.] We would not be stumped and say, ‘OK, we can’t find it. We would do everything we can to try to find what there is out there until we are satisfied with our understanding of Nature. Dark Energy, Dark Matter and Supersymmetry Age of Universe: 13.3+ billion years Composition: .4% glowing matter such as stars. 3.6% “normal” matter as we know it in planets and stars. 22.0% cold, invisible “ dark matter” detectable only by its gravitational influence on normal matter. 74.0% invisible “dark energy.” Size: At least 42 billion light-years and expanding. Shape: Debate whether curved, finite space versus flat, infinite space. Most recent data favors flat and infinite. WILL THE DISCOVERY OF THE HIGGS BOSON PARTICLE, IF THAT HAPPENS, HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT DARK ENERGY AND DARK MATTER ARE? We hope so. We’re not only looking for the Higgs boson particle. There is a wonderful theory proposed called ‘Supersymmetry.’ If there is anything we have learned in doing physics over the past 100 years or so is that Nature tends to create symmetries. By that I mean, we once found electricity that we thought was a separate thing from magnetism. But by doing the math properly and making a nice theory, we found that electricity and magnetism are the same things. This was a wonderful, new, symmetric theory made by Maxwell back at the end of the 19th Century. We keep finding that there are symmetries. [ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - “James Clerk Maxwell (13 June 1831 – 5 November 1879) was a Scottish theoretical physicist and mathematician. His most important achievement was classical electromagnetic theory, synthesizing all previous unrelated observations, experiments and equations of electricity, magnetism and even optics into a consistent theory. His set of equations - Maxwell's equations - demonstrated that electricity, magnetism and even light are all manifestations of the same phenomenon: the electromagnetic field. From that moment on, all other classic laws or equations of these disciplines became simplified cases of Maxwell's equations. Maxwell's work in electromagnetism has been called the ‘second great unification in physics,’ after the first one carried out by Isaac Newton.” ] Supersymmetry predicts a bunch of new particles. So we allow this theory because it gives us concrete predictions. It says Supersymmetry explains Nature and it tells us we’re going to find this, this and this. Some of those particles are actually particles that have mass, but which we would never have measured with any of the means that we have now. That could help to explain dark matter and dark energy."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Muons Critical in Search for Higgs Boson and Supersymmetry Particles Muons will be one of many different particles that will come out of the center of the collisions and are critical in our search for the Higgs boson and Supersymmetry because muons give a very clear signal. It’s hard to miss it. They hit you over the top of the head. You can see a particle that has gone straight through and is charged and makes it all the way through the detector with a nice isolated track – we know it’s a muon. And because of the precision of our detector, we can measure the momentum of that muon extremely well. When we take a couple of those muons and put them together, we can then suppose what the mass was of a particle that would have decayed to them. By statistically putting together all of the muons in all of the different (particle collision) events, we can see whether or not a particle is getting produced that has a specific mass. If we see that and we’re finding some particle that was created at the collision, which has a certain mass and we’ve never seen it before, that’s a discovery! THAT MIGHT BE THE WAY YOU WOULD FIND THE HIGGS BOSON? I think there is a very probability. In fact, I already put a bottle of wine on this. I have a colleague from the inner detector that measures not only the tracks of the muons, but electrons. And we have a bottle of good wine on this as to whether we’ll find the Higgs with muons or electrons. WELL, IF YOU ARE BETTING A GOOD BOTTLE OF WINE ON A DISCOVERY THROUGH YOUR MUON EXPERIMENT, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE FULLY EXPECTING THAT YOU WILL DISCOVER THE HIGGS BOSON WITH THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER? Absolutely! I’m positive of that. IF YOU DON’T FIND THE HIGGS BOSON IN THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER, WHAT HAPPENS? That would mean we had to go back to Square One and actually, I don’t mind going back to Square One. That would mean we would have to re-think things from scratch. Whatever we do, it’s science. Not finding something, in this case, is as important as finding something. Something is going to be out there. We’re going to find something! We just don’t know exactly what.” More Information: Four LHC Experiments: 1) ATLAS = A Toroidal LHC Apparatus: “ ATLAS is a particle physics experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, CERN. The ATLAS detector will search for new discoveries in the head-on collisions of protons of extraordinarily high energy close to light speed. ATLAS will learn about the basic forces that have shaped our universe since the beginning of time and that will determine its fate. Among the possible unknowns are the origin of mass, extra dimensions of space, unification of fundamental forces, and evidence for dark matter candidates in the Universe.” 2) CMS = Compact Muon Solenoid : “The CMS experiment uses a general- purpose detector to investigate a wide range of physics, including the search for the Higgs boson, extra dimensions, and particles that could make up dark matter. Although it has the same scientific goals as the ATLAS experiment, it uses different technical solutions and design of its detector magnet system to achieve these. The CMS detector is built around a huge solenoid magnet. This takes the form of a cylindrical coil of superconducting cable that generates a magnetic field of 4 teslas, about 100 000 times that of the Earth. The magnetic field is confined by a steel 'yoke' that forms the bulk of the detector's weight of 12 500 tonnes. An unusual feature of the CMS detector is that instead of being built in-situ underground, like the other giant detectors of the LHC experiments, it was constructed on the surface, before being lowered underground in 15 sections and reassembled. More than 2000 scientists"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"collaborate in CMS, coming from 155 institutes in 37 countries. 3) ALICE = A Large Ion Collider Experiment : One of the six detector experiments being constructed at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. It is optimized to study heavy ion collisions. Pb-Pb nuclei collisions will be studied at a center of mass energy of 2.76 TeV per nucleon. The resulting temperature and energy density are expected to be large enough to generate a quark-gluon plasma, a state of matter wherein quarks and gluons are deconfined. “ Our ALICE aim is to study the physics of strongly interacting matter at extreme energy densities, where the formation of a new phase of matter, the quark-gluon plasma, is expected. The existence of such a phase and its properties are key issues in QCD for the understanding of confinement and of chiral-symmetry restoration. For this purpose, we intend to carry out a comprehensive study of the hadrons, electrons, muons and photons produced in the collision of heavy nuclei. Alice will also study proton-proton collisions both as a comparison with lead-lead collisions and in physics areas where Alice is competitive with other LHC experiments.” 4) LHCb = Large Hadron Collider beauty : “Fourteen billion years ago, the universe began with a bang. Crammed within an infinitely small space, energy coalesced to form equal quantities of matter and antimatter. But as the universe cooled and expanded, its composition changed. Just one second after the Big Bang, antimatter had all but disappeared, leaving matter to form everything that we see around us – from the stars and galaxies, to the Earth and all life that it supports. LHCb is an experiment set up to explore what happened after the Big Bang that allowed matter to survive and build the universe we inhabit today.” F or further information about the LHC, our cosmos, dark matter and energy, please see Earthfiles Archive (partial list below): • 09/09/2008 — Part 1: Getting Close to the “Big Bang” Inside Large Hadron Collider? • 09/09/2008 — Part 2: Getting Close to the “Big Bang” Inside Large Hadron Collider? • 08/07/2008 — CERN Announces Start Date for Hadron Collider • 01/12/2008 — Our Milky Way Galaxy On Collision Course with Huge Gas Cloud - 40 Million Years from Now • 10/18/2007 — A Quantum Math Description of Parallel Universes • 08/10/2007 — Levitation Possible by Reversing Casimir Force • 08/03/2007 — The Milky Way Is Devouring the Alien Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy • 05/15/2007 — Hubble Finds Dark Matter Ring • 05/08/2007 — Exploded Star 5 Times Brighter Than Any Supernova Seen Before • 01/07/2007 — Universe's Mysterious Dark Matter - First 3-D Map • 01/07/2007 — Universe's Mysterious Dark Matter - First 3-D Map • 04/01/2005 — What's K illing Off Marine Life Every 62 Million Years? • 01/17/2004 — Part 2 - Is Dark Matter the \"Heavy Shadow\" of Light Matter? • 01/13/2004 — Part 1 - Is Dark Matter the \"Heavy Shadow\" of Visible Matter? • 10/25/2003 — Science Data Reinforces Invisible \"Dark\" Matter and Energy Make Up 96% of Our Universe • 05/14/2003 — Hubble Telescope Finds \"Ashes\" of First Stars in This Universe • 02/24/2002 — Mysterious Slowing of Pioneer Spacecraft 7 Billion Miles from Earth • 12/20/2001 — Will Our Universe End With Its Final Light Frozen in Time? • 12/14/2000 — A Pleiadian Star Tears Apart Black Interstellar Cloud Dark Matte r and Dark Ene rgy: • 08/27/2009 — Part 6: Is Time Travel Past and Future Possible? • 01/12/2008 — Our Milky Way Galaxy On Collision Course with Huge Gas Cloud - 40 Million Years from Now • 10/18/2007 — A Quantum Math Description of Parallel Universes • 08/10/2007 — Levitation Possible by Reversing Casimir Force • 08/03/2007 — The Milky Way Is Devouring the Alien Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy • 05/15/2007 — Hubble Finds Dark Matter Ring • 05/08/2007 — Exploded Star 5 Times Brighter Than Any Supernova Seen Before • 01/07/2007 — Universe's Mysterious Dark Matter - First 3-D Map • 06/25/2005 — \"Junk DNA\" That's Not Junk • 04/01/2005 — What's K illing Off Marine Life Every 62 Million Years? • 01/17/2004 — Part 2 - Is Dark Matter the \"Heavy Shadow\" of Light Matter? • 01/13/2004 — Part 1 - Is Dark Matter the \"Heavy Shadow\" of Visible Matter? • 10/25/2003 — Science Data Reinforces Invisible \"Dark\" Matter and Energy Make Up 96% of Our Universe • 02/24/2002 — Mysterious Slowing of Pioneer Spacecraft 7 Billion Miles from Earth • 12/20/2001 — Will Our Universe End With Its Final Light Frozen in Time? • 12/14/2000 — A Pleiadian Star Tears Apart Black Interstellar Cloud • 02/01/1999 — Astronomy Updates with Brian Marsden and John Huchra, Harvard • 01/10/1999 — Updates: Astronomy and Rufus Baughn, Nevada Test Site"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Websites: AT L A S : http://atlas.ch/ ATLAS Images: http://atlas.ch/photos/index.html CMS: http://cms.web.cern.ch/cms/ ALICE: http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Collaboration/index.html http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Large_Ion_Collider_Experiment LHCb: http://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/lhcb%2Dpublic/ Large Hadron Collider, CERN: http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/LHC/LHC-en.html CERN: http://lhc2008.web.cern.ch/LHC2008/index-E.html Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory: http://www.fnal.gov/ Black Holes: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole Higgs Bosons: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson Supersymmetry: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetry Dark Matter: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter Dark Energy: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2010 by Linda Moulton Howe.
