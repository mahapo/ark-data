Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Update - Unidentified \"Arrowhead\"-Shaped Object in California Sky © 1999 by Linda Moulton Howe December 28, 1999 Bermuda Dunes, California - On December 26, 1999, I reported that a peculiar aerial object shaped like an arrowhead with the rear curved inward was observed for nearly an hour on December 21st by Dominic Tavares, a water treatment technician, and his 11-year-old son. Five helicopters circled below the strange craft. Father and son were traveling on the I-10 freeway just outside of Indio, California headed west towards the San Jacinto Mountains which rise above Palm Springs. Mr. Tavares subsequently mailed to me color drawings that he and his son independently drew. These drawings are now in the updated interview below. Interview: Dominic Tavares, Water Treatment Technician, Bermuda Dunes, California: \"As I looked towards the mountains, I noticed a pulsating pale, light colored it was just a bright light. It struck me as unusual because I've never seen a plane pulse like that. It was a slow pulse. And my son said, 'Oh, Dad, it's probably just a star or something.' And I said, 'Well, it's too low in the sky to be a star because it's in front of the mountains.' Mount San Jacinto is a mile high. This was below the top of the mountain on the side towards you? Yes, on the west side of the mountain towards me. So, I drove forward and went ahead on I-10 and Indio from Palm Springs is approximately 25 miles east of Palm Springs. So, I caught up to this thing, whatever it was, some 25 minutes later down the freeway near Palm Springs, Calif. So, I pulled off the off ramp which would be Date Palm Drive and I got a look. We were right under it. I got a good look at it. It was shaped like a triangle. What I assumed to be the front of it was a green light. There were two more lights behind it which were a pale yellow. The middle was a pulsating yellowish light. And it had in each point of the craft, it had green it seemed to be fluorescent lights running to the middle of this pulsating light. The center of it.
