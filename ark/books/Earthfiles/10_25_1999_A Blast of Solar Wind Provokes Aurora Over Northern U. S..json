S. © 1999 by Linda Moulton Howe October 25, 1999 Suitland, Maryland The sun erupted with a massive solar flare on Sunday evening, October 18. Three days later on October 21st, the flare's shock front of charged particles had rippled through space for 93 million miles and struck earth's magnetosphere. The collision of electrons and protons with upper atmospheric molecules created a dramatic glow called aurora borealis or Northern Lights. The magnetic storm was strong over Hudson Bay, the Great Lakes and as far south as Ohio. By October 22, NASA's Ultraviolet Imager on a polar spacecraft captured dramatic images of the earth's magnetic field interacting with the solar wind. Frequently, when viewed from space, a complete aurora will appear as a circle around one of the earth's magnetic poles. This recent October display was more concentrated in a band along the northern United States.

As the sun becomes increasingly active and explosive in its eleven year cycle which is expected to reach maximum activity around June to July 2000, there will be more geomagnetic storms on earth and more aurora borealis, like the beautiful photograph taken by Dick Hutchinson in January 1998 above a frozen landscape of snow-covered spruce trees in Alaska.

NASA reports that \"in late September, a continuing series of minor to moderate geomagnetic storms have triggered aurorae along the northern tier of U.S states and may have affected some public power systems operating at high northern latitudes. These events were caused by high-speed material streaming out from areas on the sun known as coronal holes.\" Space weather forecasters expect moderate levels of aurorae, shortwave radio disruptions, and power grid fluctuations at high latitudes to become more common as the solar cycle reaches maximum.

S. Courtesy NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. On September. 14 1999, the space-based SOHO observatory photographed a huge eruptive prominence escaping the Sun, seen in the upper right corner of the image. Prominences are loops of magnetic fields with hot gas trapped inside. Sometimes, as the fields become unstable, the prominence will erupt as this one did and become part of a coronal mass ejection."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"September 14, 1999 SOHO Observatory photo courtesy of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. NASA says further, \"The recent increase in geomagnetic activity offers a taste of things to come as the sun approaches the maximum of its 11-year sunspot cycle. As sunspot numbers mount, coronal mass ejections and solar wind disturbances will trigger more and more geomagnetic storms. In extreme cases, these storms can induce electric currents in the earth and oceans that interfere with electric power transmission equipment.

This creates added drag in the area where low-earth orbit satellites and the Space Shuttle orbit. Solar flares and energetic particle events further complicate matters by interrupting satellite and shortwave radio communications. \"It's not all bad news, though. The increased levels of solar activity will likely trigger dazzling auroral displays at mid-latitudes. Sky watchers in the continental U. S. will be treated to sights normally reserved for residents of higher latitudes. Another piece of good news is that increased atmospheric drag at solar maximum acts as a scavenger and helps clean out space debris from low-earth orbit.\" We b s it e s : http://science.nasa.gov/ http://www.ptialaska.net/~hutch/aurora.html Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
