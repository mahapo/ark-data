My 15-yr-old cat, Legend, was found cut in half in Long Beach, California. I believe the date was May 13, 2004. Both halves of her body were in the yard. The rear area in one part, the middle and upper part in the other. The cut was extremely precision. There was no blood, no hair in the wound on either cat half, nothing to indicate something serrated had been used. I remember saying at the time that it looked like she'd been cut with a laser because the edges of the wounds were so smooth and clean. And I just couldn't understand the lack of blood. There were no other indications of trauma. Her mouth, head, eyes were all perfectly fine. She did not have a traumatized expression. There wasn't a scratch anywhere on her (except the obvious!). Sooooo strange! I knew I should have taken pictures at the time, but I was very upset and didn't feel up to borrowing anyone's camera.\" Thanks, MD\" 2) Subject: Back third of cats found in Thornton, Colorado Date: September 27, 2007 11:30:12 AM MDT To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com \"I was listening to Coast to Coast this morning, and heard you talking about mutilated cats being found in various places in the Northern Hemisphere. You asked any listeners who had seen this in their area to email you. I have seen two cats mutilated in the way you described in the last four months, so I am contacting you with that information. I live in Thornton, Colorado, a suburb about 15 minutes north of Denver. I deliver newspapers in that area, also, and it is on one of my routes that I have found both of the cats. The first one was back in late April or early May 2007. It was the back third of the cat, laying in the middle of the street in a residential area. I thought it was kind of weird when I saw it, but then concluded that maybe a fox or coyote killed it and dropped the remains in the street on it's way out of the neighborhood. I didn't think much else of it until I found the second one in mid-August. It was on the SAME street, about 2 blocks down. It was, again, the back third of the cat, laying in the middle of the street. I got out of the car and looked at it "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"this time, and it was like you were describing on the show this morning. The cut was extremely clean, there was no blood, no organs. I did notify the police and local animal control, but a few days had elapsed, so they weren't able to do much, as the carcass was gone the following morning. I will notify you should I find anymore cats. Hopefully, I won't!\" Sincerely, SW\" 3) Subject: Cats - Austin Texas Date: September 27, 2007 10:53:23 AM MDT To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com \"I heard you on Coast to Coast AM last night.

About 3 years ago, I was walking my dog near my townhouse and saw the back half of a cat that looked like it had been cleanly severed and placed in that position on the grass, just as you described last night. There was no blood or any other body parts near the cat's remains. I never saw anything like it again. Just for the record, it was on River Circle in Santa Clarita, California (35 miles north of L.A.). I heard you say they tend to happen around military bases. I live about 60 miles from Edwards AFB.

I live in Mesa, AZ and my home is located within the proximity of Williams Field, former Air Force Base. One morning about 6:00AM, while walking my son's dog in the little park drainage basin in our neighborhood, I came upon a cat that looked like it had been cut in half. I couldn't get closer to it as the dog was very nervous around it, but the rear quarter of the cat was missing and there was no evidence of any blood. When I returned home I called Mesa PD immediately and reported finding the cat and described the state it was in. The lady I spoke with at the PD told me it was probably a coyote. I told her that if a coyote had done this, it sure did a very clean job as it looked like the cat had been cut with a band saw. She said they would send someone out to pick up the cat. When I got home from work, I took the dog for another walk and the cat was gone. This is the first time that I have thought about the cat since that time, but it still strikes me as very odd how cleanly the cat was cut. By the way, the park abuts the US 60.

I am a security officer and listen to Coast to Coast quite often during my shifts and I happened to catch your appearance last night 9/26/07 and was enjoying the show quite a bit when you touched on something that has happened to me involving the mutilated cats. Back in 2005, my wife and I had received a boxer pup for Christmas from our two sons. We also have two cats. We had kept the pup in the house because of the colder weather and to also help house train her, as I have always worked the third or midnight shift. When I would come in, I would let the pup outside to use the bathroom. On a cool but not real cold morning in Feb. of 2006, the pup was digging at something by our front fence. When I went to check to see what she was digging at, I found the front half of a full size black cat. Only the front legs, neck and head were left. I found it odd since our yard is fully fenced from back to front. I told my wife and we thought maybe someone had just thrown it in the yard after dogs or something had killed it. But around three days later, I found a gray cat in the same condition in the ditch just a few yards up from our house. We became a little concerned and contacted the police and expressed our fear of someone or something killing cats around our area. About 5 days later when I let the pup out, she found another cat - this one being white in the same condition. Well, at the time it really scared me, because one of our cats is solid white. Thank goodness it wasn't her! But your radio show made me think. I buried those cats and remember no blood on the feet or heads or fur. I don't remember how clean the cut was because I tried not to look too close, as I am a cat lover and it was really bothering me. But what really caught my attention was when on the radio, you mentioned that almost always there was a military base close by. Well, believe it or not, about a mile and half from us is the Tinker Air Force Base. All together, my wife and I buried 7 cats in about a month's time. Thought I would let you know and to thank you for the work you do. And to keep up the good work.

But I have not heard anymore on the half cats since then. It might still be going on. They might have been just saying that they heard a wild animal cry just so to report it on the local news here in Memphis. The half cats might still be going on.

I am 21-years-old and have lived in the community of Winnemucca, NV for most of my life. I have been aware of the animal mutilation phenomenon for some time, although it has only been within the past year that I learned it extends to cats. I learned about it from your website, no less. Last night, when I heard your request on Coast to Coast AM for anyone to share information or experiences concerning cat mutilations, I was finally stirred to contact you. It was several months ago, after my mother read the book, Hunt for the Skinwalker, that she recalled a similar incident of animal mutilation on our own property a number of years ago. We believe this occurred in the months of either August or September, and in the year 2003 at the latest. As she recounts it, it was early in the morning, roughly 4:30 AM, when she let our cat, Ivory, outside. Typically this cat would return to be let inside around sunrise, but when three to three and a half hours had passed, my mother went looking for her. Despite us living on a 2.5 acre property, it was not long before my mother found this cat behind our barn, which is roughly 40 yards from our house. She described the cat as being neatly cut in half, with the back end missing, and no visible blood or sign of struggle. Her first inclination was to blame one of the two dogs we had at the time, but she said that it didn’t quite feel right to do so. The dogs hadn’t acted like they’d killed the cat. Strangely, they didn’t even bark or act out in any way during the stretch of time in which the mutilation occurred. Neither still, did our other cats, who lived both in the house and outside, give any indication of knowing what had happened. My mother said the mutilation was like an 'isolated event.' She had been awake and inside the house for the entire window of time, and does not recall seeing or hearing anything strange. I had been asleep and my father was at work. Last night on the radio, you mentioned that a large number of these mutilations occur within close proximity to military bases. I’m not sure how much relevance it has, but the closest military base of significance to where I live, at least that I am aware of, is the Naval Air Station in Fallon, Nevada. Fallon is roughly 129 miles from Winnemucca. Interestingly enough, my best friend who used to live in Fallon has said repeatedly that he, his mother and sister would see strange lights in the sky in that area quite often. He said these lights typically did not exhibit the configuration or flight pattern of conventional aircraft. What’s more, he worked as a pizza delivery driver for a time. He told me that one night he delivered a pizza to the air station, but had a difficult time completing this task because the base was on lockdown – apparently the base has been on lockdown for several months now. The only thing I know of to be special about NAS Fallon is that it is the home of the Top Gun flight school. Another thing my friend noted to be strange about the Fallon area is that where ever a person goes, they can hear an electrical humming sound coming from beneath the ground. I hope some of the information I provided will be of help in your ongoing investigations. Like you and many others, I am eager to discover who or what is responsible for these animal mutilations. As far as I’m concerned, an attack on a family’s pet is an attack on the family itself – there is a need for justice to be done. If anyone learns the identities of those responsible, I’m certain it will be you. Thank you for all the work you’ve done and continue to do. Take care.
