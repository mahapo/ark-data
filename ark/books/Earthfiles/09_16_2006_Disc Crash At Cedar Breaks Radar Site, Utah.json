Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Disc Crash At Cedar Breaks Radar Site, Utah © 2006 by Linda Moulton Howe A bout 250 miles as the crow flies between Area 51 at Nellis AFB northwest of Las Vegas and Cedar City, Utah, and the Cedar Breaks radar facility built and operated in 1966 under the direction of Area 51, Nevada. September 16, 2006 Albuquerque, New Mexico - The past few months, I have asked viewers and listeners at Earthfiles , Dreamland and Coast to Coast AM if anyone has firsthand military and intelligence knowledge about extraterrestrial biological entities, crashed discs and other related phenomena. I have received more than 200 emails. Some are very strong such as U. S. Navy Chief Yeoman, Thomas Coleman Sheppard, who described his own viewing of MJ-12 files and photographs of extraterrestrial biological entities, both dead and alive, retrieved from a crashed disc in the late 1940s. [ See 031706 Earthfiles .] A recent correspondence has been with a 47-year-old man whom I will call Paul. Currently, he is an independent truck owner/operator based in Michigan. He sent me an email that outlined information he knew about Area 51 because his father had worked there. I followed up with a phone call on August 20th and learned that Paul’s father had begun a radar engineering career at Hill AFB in Utah. After that, his father moved the family to Las Vegas while he studied more advanced radar technology in 1964 to 1965 at what he called “Jackass Flats,” or Area 51.

A rea 51's light colored Groom Lake and Papoose Range at Nellis AFB, Nevada, northwest of Las Vegas. In 1966, when Paul was seven-years-old, the family moved again to Cedar City, Utah, about 250 miles as the crow flies from Nellis AFB and Area 51. Paul’s father designed and built a new military radar facility in Utah affiliated with Area 51 and Paul got to join his father two or three times a month at work. Paul said he often saw with his own eyes two or more silver discs stacked up in the dead zone above the Cedar Branch radar facility in Utah – as if the discs played with, or taunted, the U. S. government. Then one day there was a terrible crash. Paul said he would make drawings of the discs in the air and what he saw after the crash and mail them to me for an Earthfiles and Dreamland report. After two weeks and no word from Paul, I began to phone him. On September 10th, I received this short email: “Dear Linda, Thank you for your interest in my story. However, I have been warned to not contact you again. Use my story, if you can. I dare not call you again. Are they watching my email, too? Thanks for all you do. Paul.” So, today, I am sharing what I was able to learn about Paul’s strange firsthand story on August 20th. I hope someone might have more information and will contact me by email at earthfiles@earthfiles.com Even on August 20th, Paul was at first afraid to talk. But his desire to finally tell what he saw and learned as a child in his father’s radar work was greater than his fear. Interview: Paul, Truck Owner/Operator, Michigan: “First of all, I want to say I am very nervous about this and I want to say I’m glad to be able to say something about this because I grew up with this as normal. As I got older, people told me it was abnormal and it was wrong and I was crazy. But I grew up seeing what I saw, hearing what I heard, by government officials that so-called E.T.s did not exist. I was told that all this did not exist because the public was not ready to hear or see it. I remember my very first encounter with this kind of thing at 5 years old because on my birthday at that time, we were living in Las Vegas, Nevada, because my dad worked at a place that radar techs called ‘Jackass Flats.’ Jackass Flats was Area 51. I grew up thinking I was at Jackass Flats. They called it Jackass Flats because only a jackass would believe what was going on out there. But that’s what all the radar technicians called Area 51. COULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT YOUR FATHER WAS DOING THERE? My father was in training as a government radar tech. He started out, as I remember when"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I was born, we lived in Sunset, Utah, and he started out as a radio tech at Hill AFB. As he progressed, he kept going to school and his final school was in Las Vegas, Nevada, which in turn took him out to Jackass Flats, where he finished his government schooling and crash investigator schooling. I got to go to the office where he was being taught, which was at Jackass Flats. Anyone who went out there was screened. As they were screened, there are people living on the base. I was able to go with my Dad every weekend to class. While we were out there, we were able to go through what they were experiencing. Being a small child, the families of people who went to school there were able to come on the weekends. That’s what I did. What I remember is after school, my Dad was transferred to Cedar City, Utah, where he was one of the radar techs at Cedar Breaks Radar, up on top of a tall mountain. I got the opportunity from 5 years old on to go to work with my Dad to just be with him. I was kind of a hands on kind of kid, unlike my brothers who didn’t really show an interest in what was going on. Being a child who liked to tear things apart, I went to work with my Dad on average twice a month for the 24 to 36 hour shift that he had to pull as a radar tech. DURING THAT TIME, PAUL, DID YOUR FATHER EVER SAY TO YOU AS A FIVE TO SEVEN-YEAR-OLD THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH ENTITIES FROM OUTER SPACE HERE? No, but what my father did tell me was that we were working with – he did not say ‘people,’ but he said we are working with intelligence that brings us the technical data that we have. One of the very first instances I can remember was the radar site at that time ran at an average of 3 megawatts, that’s 3 million watts. It was time for an upgrade. The upgrade was from tubes to transistors. During that upgrade, the radar site was shut down. I spent a full week with my Dad at the radar site while this upgrade was going on. It was upgraded from 3 megawatts to 10 megawatts, that’s 10 million watts. The radar site covered southern Utah and southern Nevada and just a huge area. During the process of the conversion from tubes to transistors, I was able to sit at the counters. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen the game, Centipede. It’s an old game that was popular in the late 1980s where you had a ball that was sticking half out of a console and with that ball you were able to roll around a little thing on the screen and you were able to shoot at aliens. In a radar site, there are three screens built similar to that, but the screens are round and show the sweep of the radar. As a kid, I used to play at those. Instead of there being some kind of gun on there, there would be a square. We could run the square around on the radar site and put it on any object or any X, Y, or O on the screen and we could put the square over the X, Y, or O and hit a button and the button would give us altitude, direction, projected flight path and the whole nine yards. YOU SAY ‘X, Y, O.’ MOST PEOPLE WOULD SAY, ‘X, Y, Z.’ No, it was X, Y, O. X was military aircraft. Y were commercial aircraft. And O would be private aircraft. When something would come over the screen that was unknown, it would flash X. WHEN IT WAS UNKNOWN, IT WOULD FLASH X? Yes. So, if the tech was to put the box over an X that was flashing and punch up the information for that particular aircraft, then it would print ‘Unknown.’ So, they would call it an Unknown. Discs Hovering in the Radar Dead Zone One thing I can really remember while playing with it and it was just shortly before I turned 6-years-old. I came to find out that these, well, E.T.s, if you will, used to play with us. They used to play with the information we had. You see, above a radar site, there is a dead zone. Directly above any radar site, there is an area above that big white dome where no information can come from. And the UFOs used to stack up on top of the radar site and just sit there. I used to walk out as a little kid and stare at them while they were sitting above the radar dome. The first time I saw them, that’s when my Dad’s supervisor literally threatened me with imprisonment with my Dad. My Dad I guess felt it was good (what the Supervisor did), so I would not say anything. But my Dad’s supervisor threatened me with prison and with all kinds of bad things that would happen to me if I was ever to say anything to anyone about what I was looking at. WHICH IS EXTRAORDINARY THAT ANYONE IN A MILITARY POSITION WOULD"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"BE THREATENING A 7-YEAR-OLD (1966), WITH THEIR FATHER PRESENT. COULD YOU PLEASE GIVE DETAIL IN TERMS OF COLOR, SIZE AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IN THAT DEAD ZONE ABOVE YOU? Absolutely. Everything I saw was changeable in shape. Everything had a very high chrome look to it. I would say size ranged anywhere from 15 feet across to 100 feet across. All of the vehicles that I stared at for years were – it looked like to me they could reflect or deflect any form of light, so that if they wanted to, they could actually bend the light that was around them so you could not see them. They looked like they could take the light that was coming down through the clouds and bend it and once it was bent, you would never see the craft. They were able to bend light and they could put on color, take off color, they could do anything they wanted to. And they moved at an incredible amount of speed. The most I ever saw stacked above the site at one time was five. WHEN YOU SAY STACKED, I HAVE IN MY MIND’S EYE THE IMAGE OF FIVE DISCS, ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER, BUT SPACED APART. Exactly. SO THAT IS WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING AT: FIVE DISCS, EACH IN A VERTICAL COLUMN? Yes. That is correct. I’m about to tell you something that happened in 1966 that I’ll never forget. The weekend I went up with my Dad on a Friday morning, we went up to spend a quiet winter’s day. It was fun for me and I always enjoyed going to the site during the wintertime because it required the use of big snowcats just to get to work. We got to ride in snowcats that had treads 4-feet wide on both sides and had a huge engine and made four huge tracks. We used those to get to work. There were more times than not that the radar site building itself would be covered with snow. We would have to dig down to the roof door to go to work. SO WE ARE IN 1966 AND YOU ARE NOW AGED 7 AND YOU ARE NOW BASED WITH YOUR FATHER WHO IS DOING ALL THE SOPHISTICATED RADAR WORK FOR AREA 51, BUT YOU ARE BASED OUT OF CEDAR CITY IN THE MOUNTAINS. Cedar City, Utah. WHEN YOU WERE 5-YEARS-OLD IN 1964, GOING EVERY OTHER WEEKEND WITH YOUR FATHER TO WORK, WAS HE THEN AT AREA 51? That is correct. SO HE WAS AT AREA 51 IN 1964. WAS HE THERE IN 1965? Ye s , h e w a s . THE MOVE TO CEDAR CITY, UTAH, WAS WHEN? That was the end of 1965 to early 1966. Disc Crash At Cedar Breaks Radar Site, Utah THE STORY YOU ARE GOING TO TELL IS TAKING PLACE IN CEDAR CITY, UTAH, IN THE CONTEXT OF YOUR FATHER’S RADAR WORK FOR AREA 51? Exactly. So, that weekend when we went up there, my Dad was installing all of the new equipment and I watched him and they fired it up. When they fired it up, a red telephone went off. It was a red phone, but they called it the ‘Black Line.’ The Black Line was a direct connect to Jackass Flats. This direct connect, when they called, my Dad would say, ‘This is D.’ He’d go, ‘Yes, sir, I apologize, sir.’ On the radar screens as I would play with them, I would always ask Dad why, when it swung around to that area, I would ask him why it was blacked out? He was resetting the computers and when it would swing around, it would make a pass over Area 51. In a matter of seconds, he got a phone call getting his rear end chewed out because he allowed that radar to sweep over Jackass Flats. Government radars – especially at that particular radar site (in Cedar City, Utah) was not allowed to sweep over the airspace over Area 51."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"WHY NOT? The reason I got was that my Dad told me that even though being a government entity, they did not want any information given out as to what was going on over that area. So, the less records that were kept the better. So, during that time – and I would imagine even today – there is a radar black out over Jackass Flats. You cannot run a radar sweep over that area without getting into some serious trouble. My Dad always told me it was a very, very serious thing to run sweeps over that area. Back to what happened one Saturday morning, as we dug down and got all of the – I watched the techs and my Dad. My Dad mainly designed and helped install, but he ran the portion where he had actually helped to design the circuits and he would take the drawings given him and he was the one who directed the work to have the new electronics installed. When they were finally switched on, he did not input the computer to block out those particular coordinates (of Area 51) and that’s when he got the call and he got his rear end chewed out big time! The next day on Sunday, they went on through the night tweaking the computers and radar and setting the new ranges because a 10 megawatt radar site is able to pick up much further than the old tube types were. So, as they were tweaking all of the computers and working on the equipment, I was able to sit at one of the three consoles that were set up for the radar site. The radar site has a main console, a back-up console and has an emergency console. So, there are two back-ups to the main console of the radar site. Sitting at the main console, I called my Dad and said, ‘Look at these guys.’ He goes, ‘Yeah, punch them up.’ So I punched them up and they were jet fighters, which would fly over. ‘OK, now watch.’ So we watched and these jets would fly overhead and they would disappear because they would enter the dead zone above and then they would reappear. They did that a couple of times. Then I asked, ‘Dad, what’s this?’ He goes, ‘I don’t know. They are flashing.’ So, I put the square on them. At that moment, we had a huge explosion go off on the south side of Cedar Breaks. All I can remember my Dad saying was, ‘Oh, my God!’ I looked at him and asked, ‘What?’ He said, ‘You stay put and don’t move.’ The techs all gathered together and ran outside toward the Breaks, the cliff of the Breaks. In this confusion, I could not figure out what was happening. I ran outside and as I ran outside, there were two (discs) sitting directly above the dead spot in the radar. WHEN YOU SAY TWO OF THEM, DESCRIBE WHAT YOU ARE SEEING. AND YOU MEAN ABOVE THE DEAD SPOT IN UTAH? OR AREA 51 IN NEVADA? In Utah, directly above the radar site that was just freshly rebuilt with new equipment. I ran outside, even though I was told to stay put. The radar techs ran through the trees over to the edge of the canyon wall. It looked like steam. It looked like smoke and steam mixed, no black smoke. Very little. Looking up there were two discs sitting directly above the dead zone of the radar site. I got really scared because they were flashing different colors, different. I ran back inside and sat down because there was an air of urgency. He said, ‘Son, we’re going to be here for awhile.’ I said, ‘Why, Dad? What has happened?’ He said, ‘Never mind.’ E. T. Body Crushed in Disc Console So, during that following day, there was a huge amount of government people showing up in vans and in trucks and in big trucks to the radar site. They went out and plowed the road (of snow) to get big trucks up to that radar site. My Dad, being how he was a lead investigator, they brought a lot of equipment that I did not recognize into the radar site building itself. Dad was sitting at a desk with all this mangled – I guess it was metal with markings on it and all kinds of stuff."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"I said, ‘Dad, what’s that?” He was sitting there at a console that had been just completely disintegrated. And he had a pick in his hand. He was picking out this hair-like stuff. I said, ‘Dad, what is this? What are you doing?’ He looked up at me straight and I guess he looked around to see that the boss was not around. He said, ‘Son, this is E. T.’s chest.’ I said, ‘You’ve got to be kidding me!’ He said, ‘Don’t tell anybody I told you.’ But from what I gathered from what he told me, he was picking the burned remains of an E. T. out of a console as he was tearing the console apart. LET ME MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND. YOU HAD BEEN IN THE NEWLY RECONSITUTED RADAR FACILITY THAT YOUR FATHER HAD PUT TOGETHER IN CEDAR CITY, UTAH. AND HE HAS TURNED IT ON TO TEST IT. AND HE HAD BEEN CHEWED OUT BECAUSE SOME OF THE RADAR HAD BEEN PICKED UP OVER AREA 51 IN NEVADA ABOUT 250 MILES AWAY. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A BLACKED OUT ZONE OVER AREA 51. HE PROCEEDED WITH THE COMPUTER AND WITH THE NEW RADAR FACILITY. THEN WHEN IT WAS TURNED ON, THE IDEA IS THAT THERE WERE TWO DISCS FROM SOME PLACE SITTING IN THE DEAD ZONE OVER THE UTAH FACILITY? Correct. BUT NOW YOU ARE SAYING THAT YOUR FATHER HAS A DESTROYED PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT HE IS PICKING ALLEGEDLY E. T. BODY TISSUE OUT OF. WHERE DID THIS DESTROYED CONSOLE COME FROM WITH THE PIECES OF E. T.? It came from the edge of the cliff because Dad told me, to the best of his knowledge, as these craft were flying overhead, one of them was doing Mach 3 or 4 straight into the side of the cliff. The trucks that came lowered men and equipment down and picked up the wreckage, as little as there was – very small pieces of wreckage – and put them in baskets and hauled them up into the radar site. My Dad, being that he did what he did which was as a crash investigator, he tore that equipment up to determine what possibly could have gone wrong. WHY WOULD SOMETHING ADVANCED, LET’S SAY IN TECHNOLOGY AND MIND, FLY OR MOVE A DISC AT SUCH SPEED RIGHT INTO A CLIFF? Exactly. That was the question as far as I know to this day that has never been answered. What Intelligence Was Inside the Discs? I used to listen to the techs sit there and talk about this. Before the stuff was all crated up and sent away, I used to listen to what they talked about and what they talked about was a little thing they called ‘the heart.’ They used to talk about the ‘heart’ of these craft, or ships. The heart of these craft was a small ball of spinning matter – what kind of matter, I have no clue. But they used to talk about it like they knew all about it. This small ball of matter is what created forward motion, up motion, back motion, was the instrument that gave them their power, which gave them the ability to do whatever they needed to do. What I heard was that the ‘heart’ had failed, or they had decided it had failed for some reason. That was their best speculation. U. S. Military Effort to Bring Down Discs IS IT POSSIBLE THAT OUR GOVERNMENT WAS IN A HOSTILE RELATIONSHIP TO THE DISC TECHNOLOGY AND WE ACTIVELY FROM THE LATE 1940S ONWARD TRIED TO BRING DOWN THE DISC TECHNOLOGY TO STUDY. That was the only reason, as I understood, that they used to shoot at them. They used to do all kinds of things to bring one down. I think that we were allowed to examine that because they had no way of retrieving it at the time."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Dad and the rest of the techs were on the scene. They had government aircraft flying all over the place. There were more jets and choppers that day than I had seen in my entire lifetime. And I used to sit there and play with the computer finding out who all of them were. I know that information was used and taken back to Jackass Flats. There’s no doubt in my mind about that, because all of the equipment that came was from Jackass Flats. It’s all marked as such. When they all came, every crane, every single truck, every single car came from Jackass Flats. So, anybody who would try to tell me differently would be wrong. I had no reason to wonder why anyone else would show up. YOU HAVE DESCRIBED WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN OUR GOVERNMENT AGGRESSION WITH RADAR AGAINST THE CRAFT IN THE DEAD ZONE ABOVE THE UTAH RADAR INSTALLATION. WHAT DID YOU UNDERSTAND FROM YOUR FATHER, OR ANYBODY YOU OVERHEARD, WAS THE PHYSICAL APPEARANCE OF WHATEVER THE INTELLIGENCE WAS INSIDE THE DISCS? They described two basic (type of) beings that were in this technology. Number one – the typical grey. Number two – the taller, more humanoid-looking creature. What I understand the greys to look like were oval, dark eyes; oversized heads; grey skin; small approximately 4 feet tall. The larger, more humanoid people are those that run the craft. They are in charge. They are blond-haired, blue-eyed and run anywhere from 6 to 7 feet tall. I believe the greys to be their workmen. That’s just my personal, from what I’ve seen and heard.

DID YOUR FATHER EVER HAVE A FACE-TO-FACE WITH THE TALL BLONDS IN CHARGE? He told me, and always told me, that when he went to ‘school’ that all of the information"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"came from these tall, blond-headed men. He said they all were very knowledgeable. They all had everything we needed to improve our technology. The information that he was given in redesigning the electronics for that (Utah) radar site was given to him by these taller people. WHERE DID THE TALL BLONDS SAY THEY WERE FROM? That I don’t know. There are a lot of things that I was not able to gather. I still have a lot of questions myself. My Dad and I still talk a lot, but getting him to talk is pretty hard. I’m the only one – and I know he shared a lot with my Mom of the things that happened to him and the influences that he was under to design the electronics. I know that he gained a lot of his knowledge from the taller people. We didn’t get into a lot about where they were from or stuff like that. We got into why they were there and it was just a fact that they were there. I don’t know any particulars because I’m not real knowledgeable about star places. BUT Y OU MUST SEE WHAT A CONTRADICTING PARADOX IS HERE IF YOUR FATHER WAS UNDER THE TRAINING OF BLOND HUMANOIDS THAT MIGHT BE FROM OFF PLANET SOMEWHERE ELSE BEYOND THE EARTH AND WORKING FOR THEM WERE THE GREYS. THAT THESE WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DISC TECHNOLOGY. AND YOU HAD JUST DESCRIBED THE VERY DRAMATIC SEQUENCE IN WHICH WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TRYING WITH THE RADAR EQUIPMENT THAT YOUR FATHER HAD PUT TOGETHER AT THE UTAH FACILITY TO BRING THE DISC TECHNOLOGY DOWN IN AN AGGRESSIVE MANNER. THEN THAT MEANS THAT HUMANS WERE PUTTING THEMSELVES IN A HOSTILE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BLONDS THAT WERE TEACHING YOUR FATH E R ? I believe that’s true. The technology – my Dad used to joke about it from time to time. He would say, ‘Man, we would never have thought of this for probably 50 more years.’ He would say things like that would make Dad laugh because he was a designer of electronics. That’s what he knows and what he did. My Dad is the designer of transistors. WERE THE TRANSISTORS YOUR DAD WAS DESIGNING BASED SPECIFICALLY ON THE TALL, BLOND TECHNOLOGY? Absolutely. Based all on crystal technology because a transistor is nothing more than humming crystal. WHY WOULD WE BE TRYING TO BE IN CONFLICT WITH THE BLONDS AND THEIR DISC TECHNOLOGY AND HAVE THEM TRAINING PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME? THAT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE? Of course, it does not make sense. But from what I understand, the government is in the stance that ‘These guys are going to take us down.’ That was their first stance, as far as I remember. They (our government) were actually afraid of what they (non-humans) were going to do to us. So as they were pretending to be just friendly and do all they could do to help us, the U. S. government – as far as I could tell – was taking all this information in and going to use it against them. All of his advisers were very frightened that these people were going to come in – I call them ‘people’ because I don’t know what else to call them – were going to come in and take over. So, they (government) were seeing what they could do to take them down. WHY WOULD THESE ADVANCED BLOND INTELLIGENCES BE HELPING HUMANS WITH RADAR AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES AND TRANSISTORS IN THE FIRST PLACE? It’s my understanding the reason they were bringing this about is that they wanted to have more of a dialogue with us than just ‘Hi, how are you?’ My understanding is that they were truly trying to be helpful and help us advance to keep us from destroying ourselves. So, they were trying to share with us the lowest of their technology with us. Their direct intentions, I have no clue. TODAY, IN THE DECADES SINCE 1964 WHEN YOU WERE WITH YOUR FATHER, FIRST AT AREA 51 AND THEN LATER AT CEDAR CITY, UTAH, DID YOUR FATHER TALK ABOUT HIS OWN PERSPECTIVE OF THE AGENDAS OF THE GREYS AND THE BLONDS? The only thing he talked about was that they were there to help. And they were here to give us a hand. Why have we advanced as much as we have the last 150 years? LT. COL. PHILIP J.
