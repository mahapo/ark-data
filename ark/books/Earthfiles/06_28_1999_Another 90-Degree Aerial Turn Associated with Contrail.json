Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Another 90-Degree Aerial Turn Associated with Contrail © 1999 by Linda Moulton Howe June 28, 1999 Sussex New Jersey Back on June 3, 1999, I interviewed Charles Warren of www.contrailconnection.com on Coast to Coast AM radio about unusual contrail patterns and some linked to unidentified aerial objects in or near the white trails. In my June 3, 1999 Earthfiles report associated with that radio broadcast, I posted two x-shaped contrail photos shown below dated May 14, 1999 taken at 3:30 p.m. EST by a New Jersey eyewitness, Ed Davieau, of Vernon in Sussex County near the New York State border. A bright, round object with a pale corona stands out in the sky near the X-shaped contrails. Glowing round object and x-shaped contrails in Vernon, New Jersey on May 14, 1999 at 3:30 p.m. EST. Photograph © 1999 by Ed davieau. After that broadcast and Earthfiles report, I received a photograph from a Three Rivers, Michigan resident named Alan Otterson of a contrail he said made a 90-degree angle turn while he and his wife were driving. They were so surprised that they pulled over into a parking lot to take the photograph shown here on April 24, 1999.

Now, Ed Davieau's roommate, Sandra Hanekamp, reports that on June 6, 1999, that she, too, was surprised to see a cigar-shaped, metallic silver aerial device make a 90-degree turn away from a white, thick contrail that kept moving forward. Interview: Sandra Hanekamp, Resident, Sussex, New Jersey Near New York State Line: \"And we had been watching the contrails because we had noticed that some of them, there were quite a few of them at one time. In fact, we had taken a photo of nine of them crossing (by Ed Davieau above). So, I was on the deck and watching a plane going overhead. It was going from north to south. ABOUT WHAT TIME? It was around 2:30 pm in the afternoon. I watched the plane and as it went over, all of a sudden from the left of this plane - like at a right angle - a very sharp angle, I thought the plane was turning. And it dawned on me that this plane couldn't turn in a 90-degree angle like that. So, the contrail kept on going, but the silver object went directly to the left heading east. It was just a silver object. There was nothing coming out of it, and then all of a sudden it just disappeared and the contrail kept on going straight. HOW FAR DID THE CONTRAIL ITSELF GO? Well, it went until it was out of sight as far as I could see. I mean, it kept moving. THE QUESTION IS: HOW DID THE CONTRAIL KEEP MOVING IF THE SILVER OBJECT WAS WHAT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR IT? That's what I couldn't figure out. And then on the other hand, I realized in about half a second that a plane couldn't turn that way. I mean, it just - suddenly there was this silver, and it was an oval, almost like a cigar-shape, with no wing, but the sun was hitting it real bright and it was just this big metal brightness and then it traveled, oh, I guess fifteen or twenty seconds and then it was gone out of sight. EVEN IF IT IS SOME KIND OF REMOTE-CONTROLLED MACHINE, HOW DID THE CONTRAIL KEEP GOING STRAIGHT IF THE MACHINE MAKING IT TURNED A 90-DEGREE ANGLE? I honestly don't know, because from that point on I could not see a plane in front of the contrail - I mean, the plane itself was gone, but the contrail continued. And this object ... and I knew it couldn't be another plane crossing because it came right off of the area where the contrail was. It wasn't above it or below it."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WAS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THE CONSISTENCY OF THIS CONTRAIL THAT SEEMED DIFFERENT FROM NORMAL AIRLINERS? It spread out. It didn't stay in a thin line. And it didn't evaporate. It just kind of spread out and was more like a cloud. It smoothed out after awhile, but it didn't disappear right away. DID YOU GET ANY PHOTOS? No, it happened so fast. And I was just sitting there watching it and all of a sudden, I see this object and then it was gone. I didn't have the camera outside.\" More Information: I welcome any information, on or off the record, from military, intelligence or civilians who might have first hand knowledge about United States research and development of remote-controlled aerial devices and what their varied applications might be.
