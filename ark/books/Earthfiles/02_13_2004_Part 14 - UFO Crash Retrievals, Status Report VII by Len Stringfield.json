Here begins Part 14 of Status Report VII, from February 1994. (Continued ) The Macabre Case of \"Agent\" Robert L. Malone Mrs. Robert Malone's Interview Comments Continue from Part 13: 1958: Bob was the 'consummate man' - all man. He was a hero. He was a he-man. He was tough and dedicated to the Corps and the right which, in his mind, was anything pro-America. But he was also very tender and nurturing. In uniform, he was tough, but never without a cause. He was an admirable man of many talents and deep convictions. I was proud of my husband. 1961: We had to go to the Presidio for an examination and it was here he reiterated not to let the Army do surgery on him and never let him out of my sight. He was very concerned that if he went in, he'd never come out and be able to leave. 'I know too much,' he said, 'and we're getting much too close.' It was a very hard life being under all these pressures. Three months later at Bridge Motel on Lombard Street, it was here that an enlisted man approached us and asked for Colonel Malone. I asked who wanted to know and he was evasive, officious and unpleasant. After that, we moved to El Cajon briefly and then to Ocean Beach, California. Once in San Diego, the calls became more frequent and Bob started to feel ill until one day in 1964, after several years of relative quiet, Bob hemorrhaged and had to go into the hospital. They decided at Balboa Naval Hospital to do surgery. After the surgery, Bob did well until orderlies dropped him in the bath and ripped open his stitches. During his stay, I had occasion to talk with the military wives of high ranking officers in the Naval Ward. The strange thing was that each one - one by one - and even though all were in the hospital for minor problems - all were dead or passed off as dead within a week. I ranted and raved to get adequate care for my husband while he was there. I spent every waking hour with bob and took Nancy out of school while Bob was hospitalized. After the fall, they said Bob developed pneumonia and needed a tracheotomy. Bob was very apprehensive and constantly worrying about us and what the outcome of this stay would be. I didn't understand any of it, but his desperate state of mind kept me fighting to protect him in every way I could, especially after watching the other wives lose their husbands for such trivial and routine procedures. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Then on July 26, 1961, we got to the hospital in the morning and spoke with Bob in the Critical Care Unit and he seemed different somehow, talking about seeing lights. I sent Nancy out to wait for me and I could see Bob needed his trachea tube cleaned, but the 'bird' wasn't there. So, I called the nurses to get one there and I called to the doctor to get one there. There was no hurry on the part of any of the responses to my husband's needs. It just blew my mind. There were few patients and no real care going on. Boy, did those guys hate me and my questions and complaining. they were all very negligent at that hospital. The next thing I knew, I was being told to wait in the waiting room and there was a flurry of activity - almost calculated. A short time later, a doctor came in and told Nancy and me that Bob had 'expired.' I told the doctor I wanted to see my husband and he refused. I never did get to see him to say good-bye and neither did Nancy. That's when I started wondering about what happened? You know when you later reflect over circumstances that don't seem quite right. Then I tried to see Bob at the morgue, but couldn't get in. Then, I tried to have an open casket ceremony for his burial - no deal. Nobody would let me see my husband's remains and that alone was clearly fishy, especially after all of his concerns and pleading with me to never allow him to be taken to the hospital or to be left alone. Afterwards, I was in shock and now for whatever reason, he was gone and I had to think of surviving with Nancy. I contacted Frank who knew Bob and his background. He said he'd keep his promise to Bob to help Nancy and me. One day when I went home to look for papers I needed to get Bob's pension from the Army, I couldn't find them. I had this suitcase full of Bob's papers and important documents and it was gone. I know it had been there before because I had seen it recently and now it was not here. I turned that apartment upside down looking for it. then, when I tried to get Bob's proper ranking after all his years in the military, they denied his rank and the pay I was entitled to. Then, when I complained about the treatment the hospital gave Bob, I was told 'You can't sue the military.' I was lost. I was 36-years-old and already out of the labor market back then and dependent on Bob's pension. The whole life we had looking back was so strange to begin with and then to have such a vague and nebulous ending was really bizarre and upsetting.\" Comments from interview with daughter, Nancy Malone, born December 26, 1949, at Camp Carson, Colorado Daughter, Nancy Malone: \"Previous to 1955, I have very mixed recollections of life with my mom and dad. I don't remember ever seeing my dad in uniform. He was around most of the time in comparison to most kids whose fathers were gone all day to work. But he got called way a lot - all hours of the day and night. We moved a lot before I started school and though not as much after, we still moved more than most people until I was 11 years old. I remember living mostly in the desert which I hated and in pretty isolated places. I had no friends to play with and spent a lot of time by myself. It was a very lonely time for a child growing up so rootless and transient. But I became very adaptable. My mom back then didn't seem to have much of a life or personality. I remember her talking endlessly to my dad when we'd drive to a new place - always at night when we lived in the desert - cooler, dad said. But we'd just leave everything behind and start all over some place new in Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada - that area. And always close to an Air Force base or proving grounds."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" My dad was the consummate military man - John Wayne - all the way. His life and first love and loyalty was the Army. He'd tell me stories of his horse, Mickey, in the Calvary and a little about his dad saying being an Indian and Irish was something he was very proud of, but it was hard straddling two worlds so he just went all Army. Then one day, when I was 5 or 6, dad came home late after one of his responses to a call. He told mom and me about the reality of 'other life than ours,' creatures with big heads, big eyes and frail bodies and long, thin fingers. He said he wanted us to know they existed, but we could not tell anyone. I keep thinking this is when my dad said he hit one and took it to the Army guys, but my mother says we were with him when he hit one and she saw it - and, yes, he took it to the authorities. We saw the lights in the sky frequently. I grew up knowing 'life not like ours existed' and it made me question religion all my life. It was hard keeping that secret when everywhere people said UFOs and creatures did not exist. I remember we were in South America for awhile and the same thing there - calls and off my dad would go. Then, back to the States. 1957: We were back in Nevada, this time in Las Vegas for 2 years. Until that time, we'd never stayed anywhere longer than a couple of months to a year. 1959: We were back in Vegas until 1960, then we went to the Presidio in San Francisco a year later. It is there that my father really started getting agitated about what would happen to him if he had to go into the hospital and warning my mom to not let them do surgery and to stay with him. 1960-1961: We lived in Gardena, California, for a year until I graduated. It is here that, I believe, a 'contact' was made because my experience here was like no other previously. My mom and dad left me alone for the first time in my whole life at home so they could go somewhere, at my insistence. As I sat in my room on my bed listening to Debussy's Lauter, I believe I became aware of a presence and sound in my closet. The room was dark. I was in the bed. The window was to my left and the door at the foot of the bed to the right and next to the closet. As I strained to see in the little light there was, a clicking noise got louder and then I noticed a shadowy form somewhat stooped in the closet. Scared the hell out of me! I pressed completely up against the wall and stopped the music with my left hand and drew covers up around me. I sat there a moment and thought I must be imagining this moment, but then whatever it was came out of the closet with its hands outstretched and advanced very slowly. The clicking continued and I thought maybe it was the nails on the hands. The eyes were big and stared incessantly. Scaly Reptilian Face With the dim light, I could not see features well, but now and again, I caught like a shadow - highlighted a bit. It was scaled and had a short reptilian muzzle and ridges on the mouth or it might have been teeth. It moved so slowly, I was almost hypnotized by the movement. Then, I snapped out of it and in one bound went for the door dragging bed clothes all over behind me. I turned into the bathroom right outside my door and locked the door. Then, squatted behind the commode - I was terrified. Then, the thing started scratching on the door - not"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"trying the handle or shaking anything - not even really like trying to get in - just scratching, long scratches down the door. A few minutes later, the scratching stopped as I heard my dad open the front door. When he came in with my mother, they gasped and yelled for me. I was scared to death. Although looking back, if whatever that was had wanted to 'get me,' it would have had no problem. 1962: We moved to a new apartment and moved again to a different apartment in the same complex that was nicer. My dad started easing off being away as much. But he got more worried as his health deteriorated a bit more - that the military would 'do something to him if he went into a hospital for any reason!' He warned mom about what to do if there were any problems and to stay with him, again just like he did at the Presidio. Well, his ulcer, I guess, started bleeding and he went and fell in the bathroom one day and had to go into the hospital for tests and surgery. Mom was frantic. She'd yell at orderlies and nurses to get him things he needed and asked questions endlessly. The people at the hospital hated my mother and her insistence on staying there at all hours. Me - they wouldn't allow much in the area. Dad went through the operation and was doing fine when one day we were told an orderly had dropped (dad Malone) in the bath and ripped open his stitches. This was about a week after his surgery. He was put in intensive care. But within a week, one day when my mom and I came to see dad in the morning, my dad told my mom that he had seen lights. She came in to me in the waiting room after trying to find a 'bird' to clean out his trachea. The nurses wouldn't let mom back into the unit and a few minutes later, a doctor came out and said my father had 'expired.' They wouldn't let my mom see his body. Now, my mom was already agitated from the fight she'd had the last two weeks with the personnel and the experiences she had with other officers wives in the same ward whose husbands came in for routine things and ended up supposedly 'dead' - all within days of one another. Ward 6D, I believe. That was too strange, even for a child of 14 like me to swallow. Especially a child of 14 with a mother as curious and aggressive about care as my mother was. She freaked out when they wouldn't let her 'say good-bye' or see him. That was the last time I saw my dad, that morning. I remember him saying how he'd seen 'lights' the few minutes I talked to him and he wanted to talk privately with my mom and it didn't seem to me he was having any problems. That's why I was so confused about it. Well, my mother never believed he was dead, but there was not much she could do. She tried to see him at the morgue - no way. She tried to have an open casket burial - no way. Everything my mom tried to get to see the body, the Army blocked. Or in this case, the Navy because he was at Balboa Naval Hospital in San Diego. We went home in stunned silence. She left me with friends and for two weeks, my mom disappeared. That was hard on me. My dad was my world. I played and went to the movies with my mom, but I didn't have the same connection to her as my father. I was devastated and her leaving for two weeks, not knowing what happened to her or where she was. I was abandoned n grief and totally desolate. I never believed he died. After all that happened and I went to the funeral which was before mom left and was so angry, I couldn't cry. When mom came back, she said she'd kind of had a 'lost weekend' trying to figure out what to do. She contacted my Uncle Frank like dad had told her to, but it was awhile before I actually saw him. Then, she tried to get her pension from the government for his military service and the government denied his rank and gave her way less than she was supposed to have. And she kept saying, 'You can't fight the government.'\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Stringfield: In the brief history recorded here of the Malone case, I never came to any conclusion as to the meaning of his 'double' life of chasing or being chased by UFOs. UFOs are redundant in the lives of the Malones as is the case among abductees, but at no time did any of the Malones claim they were abducted. To add to the mystery is a comment by Georgeanne that really makes the case macabre. She said, 'The cemetery man (caretaker) and the mother do not believe there is a body in the ground. He told her, \"There wasn't any casket buried there in 1964.\" Stringfield's Epilogue in Part 15 . Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
