Return to 05/28/07: Letters About Unidentified \"Drone\" Aerial Objects. May 30, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Today, I received the following email from a professional engineer who has requested anonymity. He is confident that the dragonfly- shaped aerial object photographed by \"Mr. Smith\" in Birmingham, Alabama, in May 2006, is nearly identical to an approximately 25-foot-long \"display model\" in a Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, air show he attended on or about 1987. May 30, 2007, E-mail from professional engineer who has requested anonymity: \"Dear Linda, I've been studying the various images of these odd aerial drones, when the latest picture posted from Birmingham, Alabama, (below) caught my attention. O dd, aerial object above power poles near construction site in May 2006, in Birmingham, Alabama. Photo by Mr. Smith. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"\"I was immediately overcome with the damnedest feeling that I had seen this EXACT drone before, but not in the air---instead, ON THE GROUND and UP CLOSE. And to top it off, this was around twenty or more years ago. I had long since forgotten about it. I thought I had seen it in some sort of static display or something, with people around it...then I remembered: I saw this thing in a hangar at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, at one of the open house air shows around twenty or so years ago (1987?). It was a static display (mounted on a dolly or cart), and there were people around it (that is, some visitors to the air show). It was a display by some major aerospace contractor. I forget who. A number of us had wandered into the open hangar and were just standing there, looking at it, and at some of the other displays (some air-to-air missiles, I think). There were about three or four hangars with public displays, and this one, or so we all thought, was one of them. I do have a vague recollection of somebody 'official' coming out there and telling a couple of the Air Force guys that the unit wasn't supposed to be out on PUBLIC display (i.e., apparently it was meant for display to MILITARY PERSONNEL ONLY), and that they needed to get it put out of sight. The military guys then ran everybody (including me) out of the hangar, and closed the doors. There was even a brochure, but I recall only that I may have picked it up briefly and looked at it, then put it back down. It had an artist's rendering of the unit on display. Unfortunately, I don't have the brochure. I don't remember what the thing was called, but it was some kind of surveillance or intelligence gathering drone. I wasn't that interested in it at the time, just idly curious. (It might have been some sort of 'concept development' at that time, and maybe didn't even work yet. I don't recall.) I didn't see why they thought they had to run us out of the hangar, but, of course, I respected their notion of 'security.' (I didn't see what the big deal was about some funny-looking ring-gadget with a 'wing.' I suppose I must have thought it was supposed to be some kind of satellite for watching the Russians.) Apparently, these beasts DO exist, EVEN IF somebody did some PhotoShop pictures of similar devices. Then again, maybe it's some Government or military whistleblower's idea of a 'security leak' about something that they think has (for some unknown reason?) become a threat of some sort? Now, let me recap some observations about these 'drones' from the 'Chad' and 'Lake Tahoe' series of pictures: (1) The writing on the 'wing' does NOT exactly match any known fictional language, such as Star Wars 'aurek-besh' or Star Trek 'klingon.' (Only ONE character, 'resh,' was even close, either right side up OR upside down, and that's probably just an accident of design.) (2) The drone appears to come in at least three different configurations (and now four, with the Birmingham photo, which moreover looks like possibly an 'older model'). (3) These craft seem to operate exclusively in areas"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"surrounded by federally controlled national forests. (4) The drones in some of the 'Chad' photos appear to have a high-flying unidentified aerial object above them. (5) The drones appear to be searching for something, or possibly monitoring something. (6) The drones appear to be utilizing Biefield-Brown type propulsion, although this may be only part of the propulsive capability. (7) There are sixteen 'electrodes' on the top of the circular section, and sixteen smaller 'electrodes' on the inner part of the circular section. Moreover, the smaller 'electrodes' appear to mount inline devices of some sort (diodes? capacitors?). (8) The shape of the top electrode array probably provides a field gradient that increases lifting efficiency. Anything else at this point is sheer speculation. The three different configurations (two of which are left-right mirrored configurations with respect to the apparent 'cooling wing,' and the other of which uses a second large 'wing' or sensor array, and is otherwise symmetrical in arrangement), together with the diverse picture sources, would suggest that the craft photos provided may well be genuine, other factors not with- standing (i.e., photo analysts have fooled themselves before). I have personally examined the Birmingham photo in MS Paint (admittedly not the best way, but paste-ins CAN be detected under magnification), and I found no obvious evidence of paste-in work or other PhotoShop fakery. The Birmingham photo appears to be REAL. In addition, it EXACTLY MATCHES the unit I saw on display at the Barksdale Air Show as discussed above.\" Return to 05/15/07: Odd Aerial \"Drone?\" Over Lake Tahoe and Central California Return to 05/16/07: Engineer Comments About Odd Aerial \"Drone?\" Earthfiles.
