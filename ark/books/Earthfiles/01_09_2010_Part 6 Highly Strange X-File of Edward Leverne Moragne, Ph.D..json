Moragne, Ph.D., Physicist R eturn to Part 1 January 9, 2010 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Continuation of Linda Moulton Howe's May 8, 1997, interview with Edward Leverne Moragne, Ph.D., at his Houston, Texas, home: Howe May 8, 1997, Interview with Edward Leverne Moragne, Ph.D.: “I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU THINK AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCE CROSSED YOUR PATH IN THE FORM OF A HUMAN-LOOKING MAN WHO SPENT SOME TIME TALKING TO YOU ABOUT ANOTHER WORLD IN WHICH THE CIVILIZATION LIVES INSIDE THE PLANET? Yes, he called himself Scotty Moore, looked sort of like a regular guy, but told me the human body was being used as camouflage. He talked to me about a lot of things. That E.T. told me we humans don't really understand death - that we (soul/spirit) keep going, going, going. CHANGING FORM AT THE MOMENT OF DEATH? That's right, into another energy form. DID HE SAY ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT DEATH HERE? He said you can't take matter stuff with you and when you get to where you're going next, you're not going to want Earth stuff anyway. DID YOU EVER WORK ON ANY SDI PROJECT UNDER PHYSICIST EDWARD TELLER? No, I worked on it on my own. DO YOU KNOW IF ANY U. S. ASTRONAUTS SAW DISCS OR UFO CRAFT ON THE MOON? I know astronauts have seen UFOs, but they don't want to talk about that because people will say they are kooks. WHAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED TO YOU? Huge circular craft, but they aren't going to talk about it. WHY IS THE UFO/E.T. TRUTH SO SUPPRESSED. WHY SHOULDN'T EVERYONE KNOW ABOUT IT? All you do is get up a hot steam in Washington when you try to discuss it. BUT WHY? I don't know, but it's been that way ever since I was first connected with it from that big craft and those bodies on the ground in Nevada. DOESN'T THE WHOLE HUMAN FAMILY DESERVE A PUBLIC PRESENTATION OF A BEING FROM ANOTHER PART OF THE UNIVERSE THAT HAD TECHNOLOGY TO REACH EARTH? "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Well, that's good, but at the same time, even if that being told you about everything his home planet, no one here would know more than when he started. BECAUSE? For instance, I can tell you things that you never dreamed of or heard of. For example, about two-thirds of the light scale is black. In that black area, you've got several million types of light. IN THAT BLACK REGION, WHAT RESEARCH DID YOU DO? We wanted to see what the energy of that light would be, but I can't talk about that research. YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE WORLD'S ASTROPHYSICISTS, BIOLOGISTS, MEDICAL DOCTORS AND OTHER PROFESSIONS WOULD BE SO CURIOUS ABOUT ALL THE UFO AND E.T. REPORTS OVER THE DECADES THAT THEY WOULD WANT TO ORGANIZE A CROSS-DISCIPLINE RESEARCH PROJECT NO MATTER IF THERE ARE GOVERNMENT POLICIES OF DENIAL. SCIENCE IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT FACTS AND TRUTH, NOT POLITICAL MISINFORMATION. Well, the authorities back on those humanoids that laid down - some people wanted to cut them open, even in suspended animation, and others didn't. WHO SAID NOT TO CUT THE HUMANOIDS OPEN? It was a Lt. General who said, ‘There won't be any cutting on these people at all!’The doctor had asked to make a very small cut to see what the humanoid blood looked like. The General said, ‘Make that cut damn small!’ And before the doctor had sewed his small cut up, it had already healed up. You couldn't even see a scar! WERE YOU THERE WHEN THE CUT WAS MADE? No. I heard about it later. HOW LONG WAS IT AFTER YOU VISITED THE NEVADA DESERT THAT YOU WENT TO SEE THE CRAFT AT AIR FORCE 5? Several weeks before authorities called me again and told me they had the big disc over there at the time, I think they had the humanoid bodies there, too, because I was told the bodies kept moving positions. When authorities had laid the humanoids out at the hospital station, each body was identified some way. Well, the bodies kept changing position. WERE THERE GUARDS WATCHING THE HUMANOIDS AROUND THE CLOCK? Yes, they had guards on duty all the time there. WHERE ARE THOSE HUMANOIDS TODAY AND WHAT CONDITION ARE THEY IN? What I've heard is they are in the same condition when I first saw them back in 1964 - no decay, no nothing. I guess the bodies are still laying there somewhere, maybe near the big craft, but I don't know. The assumption is that when their leader, whoever or whatever that is, decides to get them - well, who knows? Maybe their leader has decided they don't want those humanoids anymore. WERE GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES WORRIED ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF ANY DAMAGE OCCURRED TO THE HUMANOIDS? Our authorities did not want whoever made and owned the humanoids to come to Earth and find the bodies butchered or anything. We didn't want to offend space travelers! I think everyone thought back then that the leader of wherever the humanoids came from would come and take the bodies back. I don't know why that hasn't happened - at least not yet, as far as I know.” See: U. S. Patents, Electromagnetic Separator Click on partial Page 3 to see entire patent with illustrations.
