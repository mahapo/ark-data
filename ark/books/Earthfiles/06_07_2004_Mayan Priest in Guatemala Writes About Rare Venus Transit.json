Image courtesy Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). June 7, 2004 Antigua, Guatemala - About half the people on Earth might be able to see Venus move as a small black dot across the disc of the sun on June 8, 2004. It takes about six hours and you need a sun filter to protect your eyes. Astronomers have seen the rare event only five times before in the 18th and 19th centuries. For U.S. East Coast observers, the transit is underway at sunrise and ends around 7:25 a.m. EDT. The starting and ending times are listed for major cities at http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/Venus2004.pdf . \" We are now on the eve of the second (Venus) transit of a pair, after which there will be no other till the twenty-first century of our era has dawned upon the earth, and the June flowers are blooming in 2004... What will be the state of science when the next transit season arrives (June 8, 2004), God only knows.\" - William Harkness, U. S. Naval Observatory Astronomer, 1882 1882 photograph of Venus transit (black dot) across sun. Photograph from U. S. Naval Observatory. Technically, the transit begins on June 8, 2004, around 05:13 Universal Time (U.T.) and ends around 11:25 U.T. However, 5:13 a.m. on June 8 in Greenwich is actually late at night on June 7 for some North American time zones.

Two weeks ago, he wrote about the upcoming Venus transit for Saq' Be.' Saq' Be' in the Mayan language means \"White Road of the Sacred Path\" and also is the name of the dense center stars of our galaxy known as the \"Milky Way.\" Carlos has been given the mission by his elders to share Mayan prophecies and teachings with the world in order to generate awareness and support for the rescue and preservation of the ancient Mayan tradition in his homeland. Carlos is also the author of Kam Wuj: El Libro del Destino , an out of print book on the astrology and prophecies of the Mayans. Saq' Be' is a non-profit organization and website based in Santa Fe, New Mexico, dedicated to the study and communication of ancient Mayan knowledge and traditions. With the permission of Adam Rubel, Co-Director of Saq' Be,' here is a reprint of the English translation from the original May 24, 2004, Spanish text by Mayan priest, Carlos Barrios. \"THE PATH OF VENUS OVER THE FACE OF THE SUN © 2004 by Carlos Barrios, Mayan Ajq' ij For the Mayan world, the planet Venus has been one of the most predominant Celestial phenomena as well as one which entire centuries of observation have been dedicated to. It can almost be said that the ancestral Mayan Wise men had an obsession with Venus. The earliest written accounts on this subject are found in the first pages of the sacred book of the Maya-Quiche nation, the POPOL WUJ. It describes how Wukub Kaquix (one of the original names for Venus) tried to take over the place of the Father Sun. This happened in a previous humanity, and relates cataclysms and destruction caused by Wukub Kaquix and by his sons Cabracan and Zipacna. This destruction included the predominant incarnation of humanity of that time, the 'Men of Wood.' In the same way the oral tradition of the Elders describes to us: 'millions of years ago Venus suffered the crash of another celestial body that provoked the destruction of the latter (perhaps by an asteroid?), at the same time taking Venus out of its orbit. This provoked a series of cataclysms and readjustments in the planetary system, on the way to its current orbit and due to its proximity to the terrestrial orbit. It changed the rectitude of the Mother Earth (the terrestrial axis?). It also tried to take over the Sun's position, since it seemed bigger than any other celestial body in the skies and it outshone the Sun and the Moon. Furthermore, they where no longer visible, and its pride and vanity grew to a point that it demanded the humanity of that time to worship it and pay tribute to its children, who could raise the mountains in one night (Zipacna) and destroy them on the next day (Cabracan) . This is how this humanity, the Men of Wood, lived mistakenly in their end, until the Great HUN AB KU intervened and set it on its place. This way the Great Father Sun got its power back and the Moon appeared at night. Now when Venus is seen, it is only announcing that the Father Sun is coming and its (Venus's) power has been reduced to being the first star to be seen at night. In few words, this is the story of Venus told in the year 1987 by Don Pascual , who was one of the highest Wise men of the Eagle Clan of the MAM nation, the most ancient next to Qanjobal in the great Mayan civilization. Aside from predictions based on the Sacred calendar (TZOLKIN or CHOLKIJ), the MAYAN CODEX ,the KUMATZIN WUJ JUN (better known as the Dresden codex) contains descriptions of the rituals for some of the Mayan Deities, as well as calculations for a few thousand years for Solar and Lunar eclipses. The codex especially contains the charts for the calculations of the cycles of Venus, its transit over the face of the Father Sun. This codex is proof of the amazing astronomical knowledge and mathematics in Mayan writing. The fascination of scientists and mystics has been limited, because few of them know the real meaning of the context of this extraordinary document. Regarding the sinodic phases, cycles and transit of Venus, they only confirm the close attention (almost obsessive) that the Mayan world had about this planet. The apparent Path of Venus over the face of the Father Sun (an ecliptic transit in relation to the Sun) has announced drastic changes in the Earth, from cataclysms, wars, destruction (lack of food, plagues, etc.) to historical changes regarding the evolutionary development of both human beings and the Mother Earth (a destiny that is connected although not intertwined). Now that we are at the gates of a New Path of Venus over the Face of the Sun on June 7-8 2004, the least we can do is expect a new change in the outcome of humanity. Death is knocking at our doors. The drums of war can be heard."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Intransigence, the destruction of our Mother Earth, pollution, new diseases, the resurging of old plagues, global warming, the fear of world conflict, intolerance and fundamentalism in any of its manifestations, negligence, apathy, the confusion or worst still the extreme estrangement of drug abuse. All of this is a reaction to the fear caused by the thought that the world as we know it can be destroyed, and to the poor answers that materialism gives, having reached its limit and offering no other direction, because it is based in distractions, in momentary satisfactions. While reason and logic tell us that we have to stop all this madness, we are living in the age of prophecies, and the responsibility of balancing things is ours. There is no more time to play; it is know time to act. Venus is for the Mayan world the messenger; it brings its share of events that do not happen from one day to the other, those that are irreversible. It is the announcement of change. The movements that are being organized for this date (ceremonies, meditation, fasting, etc.) are important and are aimed towards a new path for as we know them. We can minimize Pluto's energy and especially Orion's energy, both of which provoke violence and destruction, because they move the rest of the planets towards chaos. The Mayan Cross for this day tells us that this day's energy is preceded by the hidden magic of the Aj Itz (Black Magicians) to create chaos. The heart manifests power over the mind, and a powerful and psychic energy which carries violence. Destiny shows that great authorities reveal themselves and uncover their sins, and a new authority will come that will change the path of things. However, this can be painful (unless we are prepared and willing). In the material hemisphere, forgiveness and sin surge in their highest expression. A balance in the spiritual hemisphere starts to surge from duality (this is if we are prepared and willing). Conditions to plant a new destiny are created. The Great Ajaw, the Father Sun, goes hunting. This means that in the hope of making a balance between the forces of the positive and the negative, we can count upon that magnificent assistance. There are payments, but the net is willing to contain the destruction of the manifestation of the material reality. The regent carrier is the one of wisdom. The other part carries an energy with a great deal of strength (violent). The pyramid of forgiveness and sin that rules the material world; that has ruled for all these years, has the law in its heart, authority of the beginning (hope), its crest (head) has the energy of the number seven (this number gives access the knowledge of magic within the material) and its bases give us the winal the twenty that is the number of purity and at the same time it manifests the human being. The great guardian brings the energy of a new beginning, the beginning of a new era (it will begin after the change of attitude and the action of the beings of light). Here we can make a relation with the beginning of FIVE AJAW, the FIFTH SUN. This is the cycle of a new humanity: of peace, harmony, balance, knowledge and the kingdom of wisdom, the return to the Original Law, to the basic, to the harmony with Mother Earth, the encounter with ourselves. This cycle begins on December 21 of 2012.\" The Maya kept time with a combination of several cycles that meshed together to mark the movement of the sun, moon and Venus. Their ritual calendar, known as the Tzolkin, was composed of 260 days and the \"grand count\" allegedly began on August 31, 3114 B.C. and ends on December 21, 2012.
