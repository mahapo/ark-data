Eisenhower, 34th President of the United States, January 20, 1953 to January 20, 1961 B urned memo, presumably written before assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, when either John A. McCone or Allen W. Dulles were Directors of the Central Intelligence Agency. In the TOP SECRET/MJ-12 red stamped 9-page document, the first page cropped above shows the document is “From: Director of Central Intelligence (MJ-1) to MJ-2 through MJ-7, with reference to: Project MAJESTIC and JEHOVAH (MJ); Project EVIRO; Project PARASITE; and Project PARHELION.” "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I n the burned first page above, under references to Project MAJESTIC and JEHOVAH (MJ), EVIRO, PARASITE AND PARHELION, the writer, who is Director of Central Intelligence (MJ-1), states: “As you must know LANCER has made some inquiries regarding our activities which we cannot allow.” LANCER was the Secret Service classified code name for President John F. Kennedy, as LYRIC was the classified code name for JFK's wife, Jacqueline Kennedy. R eturn to Part 1 August 6, 2008 Albuquerque, New Mexico - On April 20, 2002, I reported an Earthfiles.com entitled Canadian and American Officials in 1950s Collaborated on Study of Unidentified Aerial Disks. See 042008 Earthfiles in Real X-Files Archive. There were two subjects in that Earthfiles report: a Canadian government investigation of UFOs and an American government UFO-related Project JEHOVAH. First, was the official UFO phenomenon research by a Canadian engineer named Wilbert Brockhouse Smith, who in the early 1950s was Director of Project Magnet in Canada's Department of Transport. Canadian UFO historian and researcher Grant Cameron discovered a Department of Transport document originally classified TOP SECRET about the subject of “Geo-Magnetics.” Project Magnet was an official investigation of the “flying saucers” and the theory that their mode of propulsion utilized the magnetic fields of the earth and solar system."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"N ovember 21, 1950 Canadian Department of Transport 2-page Intra-Departmental Correspondence originally classified TOP SECRET about Geo-Magnetics. Document provided by Grant Cameron, PresidentialUFO.com. P aragraph excerpted from second page of DOT Memo about Geo-Magnetics. At the same time that Wilbert Smith was meeting with American and Canadian officials to study technology and the messages coming from the non-humans, Dwight D. Eisenhower was continuing Harry S. Truman's MJ-12 Special Studies Group on extraterrestrial vehicles and biological entities. Below is a November 4, 1953, SECRET memorandum from President Eisenhower to the Director of Central Intelligence, who in 1953 would have been Allen W. Dulles. Dwight David Eisenhower was the 34th President of the United States in office from January 20, 1953 to January 20, 1961.

Preferably, I would like to see this done in a closed meeting to be arranged through the Director of the National Security Agency, yourself (Allen W. Dulles), and representatives of the MJ-12/Special Studies Project. I specifically want Project JEHOVAH director Professor Albert Einstein and Doctor Robert Oppenheimer to inject any useful comments to the briefing as they are most informed on the physics related to the subject. Perhaps the annual Quantico conference could provide an opportunity to do this without the publicity which would call attention to a special meeting. Sincerely, Dwight D.

Forty-six years later in June 1999, the leaker of the burned memo - allegedly a close confidant of the CIA's Counter-intelligence Director, James Jesus Angleton - released the scorched 9-page original carbon document to Timothy Cooper, who in turn got it to Robert Wood, Ph.D., to study.
