Senator Barry Goldwater (R-Arizona) R eturn to previous Part 7 T o be more computer-friendly, the reprint has been divided into parts. Here begins Part 8 of Status Report II, written in January 1980. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report III begins at Earthfiles. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. For all the previous status reports, see Earthfiles Archives. Leonard H. Stringfield: \" ITEM B-8 \"The case of the mysterious flying object crashing into the mountains bordering Argentina and Bolivia, May 8, 1978, is well known by research. Was it a meteorite, part of a satellite or spacecraft? Rumors say nothing was ever found after extensive search on the precipitous slopes by Bolivian and Argentine military teams and by NASA. In June 1979, I received a stack of clippings from Argentine newspapers with stories that claim otherwise. The sender, Nicholas M. Ojeda of Rosario, Argentina, stated in his letter: '...As you know, our country is one of the most visited areas of the world by OVNIs as we call them in Latin America. Last year, May 8, we had a very significant case in the Salta Province in the north of the country. A long object crashed into the mountains. Although some people think it was a meteor or part of a satellite, the case is not closed yet. There is a report of a group of investigators who vanished mysteriously in the area. I really think something big happened in Salta. NASA investigated, but there was not news of it. I have to tell you that in LaPaz, Bolivia, a huge USAF Hercules C-130 carried 'something' from the area where the UFO crashed. What was it?' When this question and the news of the cargo plane being there was put to Bob Barry's former C.I.A. contact, he confirmed the flight and admitted, 'I was aboard that plane.' He offered no answer to, 'What was aboard?' ITEM B-9 Lee M. Graham, UFO researcher, whose occupation is as infrared research technician for Aerojet Electro Systems Co., in California. Lee made considerable effort in 1979 to reach a medical doctor (name withheld) through a friend, a school teacher, who had discussed with him privately some aspects of the research that had been conducted on a recovered live alien body some years before. The doctor, said Graham, knew a colleague who still had the records of his work. Graham and friend together finally reached the doctor for an interview, hoping to be given clearance to call the out-of-town colleague. The reply: The colleague had passed away - and so had his medical secretary who knew about the secret records. It was not all in vain. The doctor, who did talk briefly, recalled certain factors disclosed about the circulatory system. The skin was pliable, or stretchable, over "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"smooth muscles. There was no perspiration or loss of liquid through the skin and no body odor. This information tallied with characteristics made known by my other medical source in Case A-7. ITEM B-10 The Honorable Barry Goldwater, a long-time Arizona Senator and once Presidential candidate and a forthright spokesman on military and political affairs, is respected for his candor for speaking on the UFO subject. But, alas, what he relates is limited. Response to inquiries contain the same general information; however, couched in each there is a variation in the text which is perhaps significant. U. S. Senator Barry Goldwater (R-Arizona) January 1, 1909 to May 29, 1998. Goldwater's letter to me dated December 3, 1974, follows: December 3, 1974 U. S. Senator (R-Arizona) Barry Goldwater letter to Leonard Stringfield: '...Let's get this whole UFO thing straight as far as my relationship to it is concerned. Many years ago, more than I can remember, someone asked me if I believed in UFOs. I said that I neither believed in them nor disbelieved in them because I felt that with the billions of planets in our universe, there had to be at least another on which lived creatures that could accomplish things with their brains or whatever they used as brains. I have never seen a UFO, I've never had a personal friend that's seen them, although I've read accounts of reputable pilots who have seen what they described as UFOs. That was about the extent of my statement on UFOs, but since then - and that was a long time ago - I made an effort to get in the room at Wright-Patterson Field where the information was stored and I was denied this request, understandably. Frankly, I'm no expert on this subject. I've never made lengthy statements on it. What I've told you just about sums it up ...' In a letter received by a researcher (S.A.), dated March 28, 1975, Goldwater stated: March 28, 1975 U.S. Senator Goldwater letter to researcher S. A.: '...The subject of UFOs is one that has interested me for some long time. About ten or twelve years ago, I made an effort to find out what was in the building at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base where the information is stored that has been collected by the Air Force, and I was understandably denied this request. It is still classified above Top Secret. I have, however, heard that there is a plan underway to release some, if not all, of this material in the near future. I'm just as anxious to see this material as you are, and I hope we will not have to wait too much longer ...' Then, in a letter dated April 11, 1979, Lee Graham (referred to in Item B-9) who had questioned Senator Goldwater about my letter in (my book) Situation Red, received the following response: April 11, 1979 U.S. Senator Goldwater letter to Lee Graham: ' ...It is true that I was denied access to a facility at Wright-Patterson. Because I never got in, I can't tell you what was inside. We both know about the rumors. Apart from that, let me make my position clear. I do not believe that we are the only planet, and of some two billion that exist, that has life on it. I have never seen what I would call a UFO, but I have intelligent friends who have, so I can sort of argue either way. ...' The emphasis in each letter is mine. In essence, Goldwater is saying that he was denied access to the facility where Top Secret information was stored which he"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"believed concerned the alien craft and bodies. Recall in Case A-3 that my informant, who was stationed at Wright-Patterson during the Goldwater visit, states that the incident caused quite a fiasco among ranking personnel. ITEM B-11 The following excerpted letter, dated June 22, 1978, was received from a source in Florida, who prefers that his name and location be withheld: June 22, 1978 letter from Florida source to Stringfield: '...this letter is in reference to your book, Situation Red. ...To the point, what really grabbed me was the letter published on page 252, which was a reply from the Air Force to Senator Goldwater. ...It is an outright lie. In 1951, I became a very good friend with a Major in the Air Force, now deceased. I decline to mention his name on paper, but he was an influential person, known throughout the world. I worked for him part time, and while I was in his house one day, he casually tossed a book to me to read. Even though this was over 25 years ago, I still remember distinctly the words on the cover: 'Classified.' I read the book and thought that it was science fiction. ...I don't remember much of what I read, but one picture I'll never forget. The photo showed three or four Air Force personnel holding saucer objects by their rims. The objects were about 3 or 4 feet in diameter and were identified as UFOs. Printed on the bottom right hand corner was 'Official U.S. Air Force photo.' These were remote controlled UFOs that had been captured by the Air Force, that much of the book I do remember ... and, they do have humanoids and UFO craft in their possession.' COMMENT: I phoned the source and got identification of the Major who was a well known figure. I also got other details relative to the document he was privileged to have read. ITEM B-12 In the long history of the UFO, chroniclers and story tellers representing all levels and from all doubtful depths have surfaced to espouse a theory or an experience. They range from the professional and the authoritative, who have measurably contributed a lasting message, to the opportunist and the charlatan who have done everlasting harm. One, a professional writer, and one of the earliest to release a rhetorical bombshell, was Frank Scully. His only UFO book, Behind the Flying Saucers , (published in 1950) was the first to deal with the UFO crash/retrieval syndrome. Behind the Flying Saucers © 1950 by Frank Scully. But his glory as author was short-lived. His sensational expose became a sensational hoax. Indeed, the fate of Scully was to change the course of research for almost three decades. As a result of Scully's scandalous smear, which got maximum publicity when the saucer craze was peaking in the early 1950s, it became unfashionable for any respected researcher to write or talk about a crashed UFO or their 'little green men.' Contrary to today, as records will attest, even Encounters of the Third Kind were scantily reported in that early era. So completely was Scully's story put down that some researchers today wonder, in retrospect, if the book and/or its exposure was contrived. Little new information about Scully since his death surfaces for today's evaluation. Any item concerning his life may provide a clue. I have uncovered two letters written by Frank Scully in 1954 that deserve review. They came from a collection of saucer memorabilia bound in hard cover discovered"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"by an Australian while browsing in a bookstore in Florida. While writing my book, he obligingly sent me the material for my research. Scully's letter on masthead, Desert Springs Chamber of Commerce, dated April 12, 1954 follows: April 12, 1954 letter from writer Frank Scully to a Reverend: 'Dear Rev. ----- Thank you for your letter of April 4, which I had better answer immediately or it will never be answered, I'm so in arrears. I just returned from a convention held in Giant Rock where 5,000 persons held a Saucerian convention. It is 35 miles from anywhere in the Mojave Desert. All shades of opinion were represented. But to get to your letter. My chief witnesses as you describe them have not repudiated one sentence of Behind the Flying Saucers . Dr. Gee was a composite of 8 different scientists, whose stories were tape recorded and then synthesized by me where they were in substantial agreement. As for others who have similar stories, there are a whole slew of them. Mine dealt with three saucers and dead crews. George Van Tassel, a former Lockheed test pilot, has out a book, I Rode A Flying Saucer. George Adamski tells a personal experience in Flying Saucers Have Landed. Another man has one out called Aboard A Flying Saucer. He claims he was aboard 11 times. Another, Williamson, has one out, The Saucers Speak. There are altogether about 10 books. Many go beyond mine, but their authors are not writers as such. I am. That's my only profession. I claim to have seen nothing. I simply reported what others claimed they saw. Right now, I am gathering material for This Side of Saucers. It should prove more sensational than Behind The Flying Saucers. I do not know when I will get it finished. Next Spring, probably ... Faithfully (signed) Frank Scully.' Letter on VAR IE TY masthead, dated June 10, 1954 follows: June 10, 1954 letter from writer Frank Scully to a Reverend: 'Dear Rev. ---- Thank you for your letter of May 21. I've not seen any response to that resolution to turn the saucer inquiry over to civilians, have you? At the Giant Rock Convention, 5,000 people endorsed this view and you might try your Congressman, or your Senator, this being an election year, to try his hand at pushing it through. As to the Hunrath-Wilkinson disappearance, I'm afraid it was planned suicide on Hunrath's part. They had gas enough for only three hours and could hardly get over these high mountains with that. If they lost their bearings and got over the Pacific, they might easily be drowned without a trace. I'm in the position of a pathologist having reported on grounded saucers and dead crews, and listening now to personal histories of those who have talked with live crews and even flown in their saucers. My personal history continues to be much more prosaic. I've been very ill for several months and have been doing much research and little writing, but I hope to get on to the latter this summer in the desert. With renewed thanks for your interest, I remain ... Faithfully (signed) Frank Scully.' \" T o be continued in Part 9 - Shoot Out? Between U.
