Here begins Part 4 of Status Report VII, from February 1994. 1974, A Year of Strange Strategies: Emily's Morgue Test Emily's case is bizarre. In fact, it is unique in crash/retrieval research. She had witnessed, firsthand, a deceased alien in a morgue drawer at Wright- Patterson AFB. To her, it was like a bad dream, admitting that she has had a hard time believing her own experience - or, why it happened. Occurring in 1974, Emily's story could easily be brushed aside as fantasy. But, as certain details of her high-intrigue case gradually surfaced, she might have been an unwitting victim of a broader high level scheme. In this respect, I felt that her experience deserved a niche in this report. Despite the high strangeness of her case, is hers any less credible than others who relate mind-boggling experiences? My personal involvement in Emily's case began March 3, 1993, when she consented to join Pat Packard, a local researcher, (later to become MUFON's Section Director in Southwestern Ohio), and a friend to visit me in my home. She had been reluctant to see me, or anyone else, about her experience until April 1992 when Packard first learned of the case from her friend, a business acquaintance. But, after questioning her briefly at various times, he could not come to grips in accepting it as reality. On the other hand, he admitted that Emily could have experienced something extraordinary, stating: \"She cried, really cried, when trying to tell about her seeing the alien cadaver.\" Learning that we had a mutual interest in exotic plants, Emily brought me a tray of seedlings of a Kalanchoe species for my garden room collection of succulents and cacti and bromelieads, and some other hard-to-grow tropical plants. Having just sprinkled the tropicals, the smell of a jungle eased our way into the subject of cadavers. Emily being an experienced artist for a large department store in downtown Cincinnati, she was offered an art job with attractive pay by her Uncle John who was a top executive of a company, now defunct, named Hoelche Environmental Services, in western Cincinnati. An interview with her prospective boss, Mr. Kern, went smoothly, she said, discussing environmental issues and the nature of her artwork. Hired, she was allowed two weeks to give proper notice to her former employer and was to start "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"work on a given Monday. During this waiting period, Emily went out one evening for a dinner party. While toasting a drink, to her surprise, Mr. Kern just happened to show up and was quick to explain how he knew she would be at the restaurant, hoping to see her. Of course, she said, he was invited to join her table. Somehow, said Emily, the subject got onto UFOs, most of it critical. Again, surprise, Kern took issue with the critics, but she has forgotten the points of his argument. Later, privately, he asked her if she would like to see the proof - a real alien. Thinking he must be joking, she agreed to the challenge. According to Emily, he said, \"Tonight.\" I asked Emily if she felt safe with a stranger making such an unusual proposition. She said that she did because he was a friend of her Uncle John's, and too, she wondered if it might be just a test of her ability to perform on the job. They drove to Wright-Patterson AFB. \"He had the right kind of credentials to get past all the guarded gates,\" said Emily, adding, \"At one of the guard posts, I was given a clearance badge, but beyond that, he used a plastic key to open doors, one to an elevator. It all seemed too pat, just as though they were expecting both of us to be there.\" Again, using the magic plastic key, said Emily, showing some discomfort, they entered an underground room, well-lighted, in which there was a built-in section with several tiers of drawers. During one period of lull, with Kern seemingly preoccupied by staring at the drawers, a person in uniform, unarmed, entered the room. He smiled curtly, nodded to acknowledge her presence, said a few words inaudibly to Kern, then departed through a door on the opposite side of the room. Kern then walked up to one of the drawers, pulled it open and asked her to look inside. Emily was shocked: unable, she recalls to utter a sound. There before her, at face level, was a small, lifeless body in a zipper bag, opened to the waist. In disbelief, she said, \"The eyes got me. They were so big and powerful and live-looking that I felt like I was hypnotized. Kern said nothing, but I could sense that he was watching me, my every move.\" Non-Human Entity's Skin Like An Iguana's Photograph of iguana from http://iguanaden.fotopic.net . When I asked if she recognized any cameras mounted in the room, she said, \"I didn't think to look.\" I responded that more than one was probably rigged to record her behavior. At that point, Emily, sitting across from me,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"her eyes watering and hands clasping, said that she was so unnerved at that time, she could only vaguely recall other features of the half-exposed cadaver. \"It was grey,\" she said, \"about 4 feet tall with a slim torso with skin that looked like an iguana in texture.\" After a moment's pause, she continued: \"I should know, I have a large iguana as a pet.\" Of the face, she remembered a small slit of a mouth and no nose. Then, after a prolonged silence, she looked at me squarely and said, \"Mr. Kern invited me to touch it and I did. It was cold, but those eyes; they looked alive to me.\" Emily continued, \"On the return trip home, little was said. I remember trembling in the car and I guess I mumbled about the body, the morgue and secrecy, but Mr. Kern - except to remind me that I was not to tell anybody about the trip - was very quiet, not at all like he had been at the party and during the interview.\" Finally, her eyes showed her inner stress and she said, \"So, I have seen the proof, but who was the real Mr. Kern? Why me? I had hoped to find out when I reported to work Monday.\" Other shocks were in store for Emily. Reporting to work on Monday, she was informed by Kerns' secretary that he had died suddenly of a heart attack and that her job had been canceled. And, checking the newspapers for Kern's obituary, his demise was never listed. Emily was left adrift for years in her own surreal Hall of Mirrors, wondering who was who at Hoelche's. I had talked with Pat Packard before Emily's visit to relate that I might be able to explain the reason for her misadventure at the morgue and its connection with other high-level strategies. Based on the known data, I later told Emily that it was my belief that the Hoelche Company was a front for a special intelligence operation. Speculating further, I said, some - if not all - of its personnel were undercover agents with Mr. Kern. He was using a fake name and credentials and was the key player. But, I emphasized, I needed to know more about another player, her Uncle John. When Emily had finished her narrative, my first question to her concerned his past military duties, if any. Response: Yes, he held a high rank in the U. S. Army. Next question: What was his specialty or assigned duty? Response: Intelligence. She knew this by his own admission based on an incident that occurred when she was a teenager. \"Looking back,\" she said, \"I got into a petty family quarrel and ran away to stay with my girlfriend, hid in my car behind a dumpster in an out-of-the-way parking lot. But, Uncle John found the car and revealed that he had the ways and means to solve such problems. Boastingly, he said that was his job in army intelligence.\" With this fact in mind, his executive post at Hoelche's probably dealt with matters beyond environment. In Emily's case, and I'm guessing, he was responsible for offering his niece employment as an artist for Mr. Kern, knowing full well that she was to be used as a guinea pig in some kind of weird psychological reaction test. Appearing disturbed, Emily said she never thought of her Uncle John, who passed away shortly after the incident, would be involved in such a dirty trick. The rest of the story is obvious, I said, adding that Kern, according to plan, then disappeared without a trace, leaving his secretary to give out the false story of his death. Additional evidence of foul play, Emily recollects, involved a lady whose husband worked at the firm. During the same time-frame as Emily's, she suddenly became ill which led to a nervous breakdown. She declined to give a reason for her state of mind, but Emily wondered if Kern also used her, and others, in a similar experiment. In summary, the \"Hoelche\" game plan was to ascertain human behavioral reaction to the sudden exposure to an alien being. To that end, 1974 might"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"have marked the beginning of a new policy - a plan to tell the world the truth about the extraterrestrial UFO. According to leaks from insiders, there was an official concern in 1973, like in 1952, that the intensive low-level UFO activity would be a prelude to a larger scale tactical incursion. Also, there was a concern that the mass media, over-stimulated by the inundation of sightings, was playing it up daily on the local TV and radio news and on the front pages of newspapers. Even the popular John Chancellor anchor on NBC-TV news gave the UFO top billing at the peak period of the October flap. The slumbering, benighted public, was being aroused. Was President Gerald Ford Preparing to Tell World About ETs in 1974? 1974 was also a year with persistent leaks from reliable sources reaching top UFO researchers avowing that the government would soon formally announce that the UFO was real and of extraterrestrial origin. One example, to put it briefly, was reported in my Status Report III, UFO Crash/Retrievals: Amassing the Evidence , in which I cited a sergeant in the California Highway Patrol who was privy to hear a former high-ranking army officer address a survival course group and claimed he had firsthand information about a crashed saucer in New Mexico. He stated further that he had no problem in releasing sensitive details to the sergeant because the U. S. government would be going public soon. My comment to follow the sergeant's disclosure in Status Report III accents 1974's high strangeness of events contrived by phantom-like people in a Hall of Mirrors, follows in part: \"His (the sergeant's) reference to an imminent 1974 announcement declaring UFOs were of extraterrestrial origin, is extraordinary as I knew that a report was quietly circulating among responsible researchers anticipating such an announcement jointly by the United States and France. According to my notes, December 3, 1974, I was alerted by Walter Andrus, Director of MUFON, to be prepared as public relations director to rush to Chicago to join him and Dr. J. Allen Hynek of CUFOS in a press conference if official word was released. \"Straws in the wind,\" I noted in my log, were rife that the announcement would be made December 15 by President Gerald Ford.\" On the suggestion of Andrus, I prepared a tentative press release which got both his and Hynek's approval and we waited. In my log entry for December 16, I noted, \"Wonder what President Ford and Giscard de Estaing, President of France, are discussing in Martinique besides the oil problem?\" There was no UFO announcement. Adding to the intrigue is the well-timed news wire release in 1974 by UPI featuring Professor John Spencer Carr's story about a saucer crash and recovery of \"little men\" in New Mexico, in 1948. Never mind the details about the anatomy of the bodies. I find the manner in which the story was apparently controlled in the media to be more significant. As I recall, it got the usual funny treatment in Cincinnati and in Chicago. It caught the attention of Sherman Larsen, a no-nonsense researcher with CUFOS in Evanston, Illinois. He called me for comments, but oddly, I didn't hear about the Carr \"little men\" story from any other of my many contacts from coast to coast. Curious, I called the local UPI office about the coverage. Answer: It probably was a controlled release, limited to three states: Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. Trying to rationalize a reason for such control, I could only deduce that it would be easier for the eyes and ears of a Hoelche-like \"company\" to keep tabs on reaction. Certainly before any public announcement, the officials would like to know how people think and not depend wholly on the thinkers in \"Think Tanks.\" "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Allowing for misinformation or embellished rumors and contrived disinformation, I can only speculate about Emily's alleged experience and other coincidental happenings. Looking for a logical reason, the same supposition applies to my own case in 1978 when I was bestowed a cornucopia of anatomical information about the alien body from two unquestionably reliable doctors, one of whom had performed an autopsy. I, too, felt that I had been selected or used to receive bonafide information for release to the public as a test for reaction. Coincidentally, this was the same year that Major Jesse Marcel, intelligence officer for the 509th Bomb Group, made his famous disclosure about the Roswell incident. Albeit, the same \"testing\" theory can apply to any major UFO event or book or movie or whistle blower that will appear to some researchers to be \"loaded\" with ulterior purposes. Again, the Hall of Mirrors. Charles Dickens in his book, A Ta l e o f Two Ci t i e s , described the times in 1775 in France and England in part, \"...it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity ... it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair. ...\" In the decade of the 1970s, 200 years later, many UFO researchers found themselves in the same conflicting state of affairs thrust upon them by events and by people and cells of people who emerged presto! from the Hall of Mirrors. Emily's episode is just one of hundreds, affected by the \"epoch of incredulity\" in the 1970s. Looking back, the most sobering to change the status quo was the UFO wave of 1973, the biggest since 1952. But, among the \"hopes\" and the \"despairs\" was the rise of Dr. Hynek and CUFOS, the fall of NICAP, the advent of animal mutilations, the upsurge of abductions, the impact of Hollywood's highly touted Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind , the breakthrough of nut and bold crash/retrievals and Jesse Marcel's disclosures on Roswell, ad infinitum - all concurrent with persistent rumors of an imminent official announcement that UFOs were real. Before my formal disclosures on crash/retrievals at the MUFON Symposium in Dayton in 1978, I remember being impressed - and still am - by an item appearing in the prestigious magazine, U.S. News and World Report on April 18, 1977, which stated: \" (In 1977) before the year is out, the government - perhaps the President (Gerald Ford) - is expected to make what are described as \" unsettling disclosures\" about UFOs - unidentified flying objects. Such revelations, based on information from the CIA, would be a reversal of official policy that in the past has downgraded UFO incidents.\" U.S. News and World Report, April 18, 1977 To be continued in Part 5 .
