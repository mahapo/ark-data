S.: \"The second incident was about seven years ago (1992). I knew a woman in Atlanta, Texas, named Brenda. She was about two or three years older than me. She was a registered nurse (R. N.). I met her through a metaphysical class. She was very much into holistic healing. She was very much into UFOs. B talked about them quite freely. She said she could command them, as far as her choice of words she said she could communicate with them when she desired to. Usually it was between 3 and 4 a.m. She could go to one particular window of her house and they would communicate with her, she said. We talked about that quite a bit. But she was also an R. N., she was extremely articulate, well-educated woman. In fact, as I told Jim Marrs, if I could point out any thing bad about Brenda, I could not. She was in every way to my knowledge a person of truthfulness, of great compassion, and I found her to be a delightful companion in every way. We got very close. She was not married at the time, but I had married James. She was an R.N. for the older folks, for the home service people who go around and take care of the elderly. She was very well-liked. She was quite an attractive lady. Sometimes we would meet and have lunch. I was very curious about UFOs at this particular time in my life. She was very free and easy with her remarks. She did not apparently try to hide anything. She simply stated what she considered facts and if you believed it, fine. If you did not, it was still fine. She was a very soft-spoken woman, blond hair, about 5 ' 6\", a very attractive lady. Her husband had died about three to four years before I met her. He died of a heart attack - he was an older man. She had no children, ever. She was just a very fine lady. I respected and admired her in every way. One day I was working in the yard and she stopped by and said, 'R, I am so tired. Due to a couple of ladies being off, I've worked three weeks without a day off.' She said the next two days she was off and she said, 'I'm totally exhausted. It's even hard to go out to eat.' I said, 'Brenda, I've got to put supper on the table in about a half hour. Why don't you go take care of your client and come back here for supper? Then when you go home, you're free.' She said, 'Oh, that sounds wonderful! I would love it.' She came back. My husband was there. She was talking about how tired she was, that when she left the house she was going to go home and take a bath for at least a day and a half and for the rest of the time she was going to spend in bed. Change from Human to Reptile We were having Mexican food. We went to the den with our meals. Brenda and I both took a goblet of tea. James took coffee. We were sitting there. We were having just a good conversation about this particular elderly lady making a funny, cute remark. And all of a sudden, there sitting on my couch was this reptilian person. I was so shocked that I jumped, yelled, and spilled my plate of food and goblet of tea on the floor. My husband turned and said, 'What was that about?' I could not actually tell James at that time. It took me about three days to relate what I saw. GO BACK A SECOND, SO I'M VERY CLEAR. THE THREE OF YOU ARE SITTING "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"IN THE LIVING ROOM. In the den. YOU HAVE YOUR FOOD AND DRINK. TELL ME THE FIRST MICROSECOND OF THINGS NOT BEING NORMAL. WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED? Brenda made the statement, 'R, I am not just tired. I am absolutely gut-tired to the bone. I am so tired I've changed my mind about the bath. I think I'm going to go home and go to bed.' I looked up because it was kind of a cute remark the way she had said it and there she was. ARE YOU LOOKING AT BRENDA? Yes. She was on the couch. I was in one of the recliners. BUT ARE YOU SAYING THAT BRENDA IS NOT SITTING THERE, BUT A REPTILIAN IS IN HER PLACE? OR ARE YOU SAYING THAT A REPTILIAN IS SITTING NEXT TO BRENDA? No, Brenda turned into the reptilian. Absolutely, irrevocably, exactly what I'm telling you. DID IT RESEMBLE WHAT YOU SAW WITH THE STANDING UP ALLIGATOR WHEN YOU WERE IN THE PENTAGRAM? Description of Brenda As Reptile No, not exactly. Brenda's eyes were yellow, kind of a yellow-green with the pupil going up and down (vertical, not round). But they were not red at all. Her skin was a yellow-green, but her nose or snout was not long. It was rather short and triangular, not long at all like the alligator look that I first saw and told you about. SO, YOU WERE LOOKING AT YOUR FOOD WHEN YOU HEARD BRENDA SAY SHE WAS GOING TO GO HOME AND YOU LOOKED UP TO RESPOND TO HER. And that's when it occurred. BUT DID YOU SEE THE CHANGE OCCUR FROM HUMAN TO REPTILE? No, it was a done deal when I saw it. SO YOU LOOK UP AND WHAT EXACTLY IS OCCURRING BETWEEN YOUR EYES AND THE EYES OF BRENda AS THIS REPTILIAN? It was like somebody snatched Brenda away and the reptilian was in its place. And yet, I knew that what I was looking at was Brenda. In fact, we had talked about reptilians at one time. She had asked me if I thought reptilians were all bad. I told her I wouldn't assume that anything was all bad or all good. I assumed making remarks like, 'It's like people. Good people, bad people.' I would assume any race of alien would have the same choice or factions. DID BRENDA MAKE ANY REACTION TO YOU AS A HAND RAISE? OR WAS THERE ANY SURPRISE IN HER FACE? LIKE 'I NOW SEE THAT YOU KNOW I'M A REPTILIAN, BUT YOUR HUSBAND IS SITTING THERE.' WAS THERE ANY INDICATION FROM THE REPTILIAN THAT THE REPTILIAN KNEW THAT YOU WERE NOW SEEING A REPTILIAN BODY INSTEAD OF BRENDA'S HUMAN BODY? Only in her action of immediately running out of the house. WALK ME THROUGH THAT MICROSCOPICALLY. YOU'RE SAYING YOUR HUSBAND IS EATING AND IS NOT AWARE AT ALL. No, he was not. He never saw Brenda in her transformation at all. YOU ARE LOOKING AT HER. DO YOU REMEMBER IN THOSE MICROSECONDS IN LOOKING AT HER, DID YOU SAY ANYTHING? DID YOU SAY, 'BRENDA!' WHAT HAPPENED? YOU'RE LOOKING YOU MUST HAVE HAD SURPRISE. I certainly am sure I did, but the only thing I remember is dropping of the food. I dropped my plate and the goblet (of tea). The minute it dropped and hit the floor, I was still staring at her. Immediately she got up and run out of the house."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"DID SHE SAY ANYTHING? To my knowledge and I don't know if James said she did or if I remember it I honestly don't know that. She said something like, 'I've got to go.' AS YOU DROPPED THE FOOD, CAN YOU HEAR THE SOUND OF THE PLATE HITTING THE FLOOR? Oh, yes. DO YOU SEE ANY REACTION ON THE REPTILIAN AT THE SOUND OF THE GOBLET AND PLATE HITTING THE FLOOR? If I do, I don't remember. The only thing I remember thinking, 'This is connected somehow to the first incident (in the library and later the alligator and pentagram).' That hit my mind. If there was anything else, no ma'am, I don't remember it at this particular time, no. SO, THE REPTILIAN DID NOT FLINCH, MOVE, HEAD NOD, EYES BLINK, NOTHING? There was absolutely no blinking of the eyes. That I remember. It had the look. It was just there. IN THE NEXT MICROSECONDS, HOW DOES IT/SHE GET UP? How does she get up? Linda, if she got up any extraordinary way, I don't remember. It happened so quick it was simply when she moved to the door, she was Brenda again. No longer reptilian. WAS YOUR HUSBAND LOOKING THEN? Yes, ma'am. DID YOU SEE ANY TRANSFORMATION OR FLICKER OR ANYTHING BETWEEN THE REPTILIAN BACK TO BRENDA? (pause) You know, Linda, I want to say, yes. I noticed something about the head and the chest. But I honestly can't tell you. But there has been something eating at my mind for years, but I can't tell you honestly because I don't know. THINK ABOUT IT NOW IN YOUR MIND'S EYE. YOU KNOW WHAT HOLOGRAMS ARE? Ye s . COULD THERE BE ANYTHING LIKE HAVING SOMETHING LIKE A HOLOGRAM OF BRENDA SUDDENLY SUPERIMPOSED OVER THE REPTILIAN? (long pause) I don't know, Linda. I really don't. All I can tell you is that my emotions at the time were stunned. It was not fear so much in that particular incident as my mind linked the connection to the first incident (library and pentagram). WHAT IS YOUR HUSBAND SAYING TO YOU ABOUT YOUR DROPPING THE PLATE AND GOBLET? The minute that Brenda ran out, he made some kind of remark like, 'R, what happened? Did something happen I missed? What's going on?' It was like something happened and he could not conceive she would have just run out. He could not conceive why I would drop the food and the goblet of tea. It was just he was just stunned, 'What happened?' WHAT DID YOU SAY? I said something like, 'Did you see Brenda in any way different?' He said, 'She looked awful tired.' And I knew right then that he had not seen her as I had perceived her at all. DO YOU NOW HAVE AN IMPRESSION OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE RED-HAIRED REPTILIAN IN THE LIBRARY, BRENDA BEING A REPTILIAN AND YOUR SEEING IT BECAUSE SHE WAS EXHAUSTED AND WHAT THE CONNECTION IS? The best I can tell you is at the time I did not. But when the book, The Bringers of the Dawn came out, I read it. A lady had told me about it and she said, 'R, it's a far out book. You'll like it.' Because I did like what people call far-out books. I got the book and it made such an impression on me that you could verify this with my"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"husband quite easily: When I bought the book, I bought it on a Wednesday. We had company on Wednesday night. Thursday morning, I started reading the book. Thursday night when James come in for supper after work, I was still reading the book. I propped it up on the faucet when I did dishes. I could not get the book out of my mind. The minute I finished the book, I started back on Page 1. I read the book twenty-seven times. I could not stop reading the book. I took notebooks. I still have two or three notebooks here. I took each chapter. Then I took each page. Then I wrote how many words on each page was 'create.' I know how many 'create' or 'creating' on each page. I took each word and circled it in the book. WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF 'CREATE' OR 'CREATING?' I don't know. It was like I had to do it. I don't know. IS THERE IN THE BRINGERS OF THE DAWN ANY DESCRIPTIONS ABOUT REPTILIANS? No descriptions at all, other than she (author Barbara Marciniak) calls them 'dark t-shirts.' But there is no physical description at all that you are going to say, 'If you see one, they are going to look like this.' Absolutely not. DID YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE BOOK HAD ANY REFERENCE TO REPTILIANS IN IT? Not until I read the book. DID MARCINIAK USE THE TERM 'REPTILIAN' IN THE BOOK IN ANY WAY? Ye s . \"I know that you saw me as I really am.\" GOING BACK FOR A MOMENT TO BRENDA GOING OUT THE DOOR. YOU HAVE KNOWN HER WELL. DID YOU THEN TALK WITH HER THAT NIGHT OR THE NEXT MORNING? No, I did not talk to her that night not for a couple of days. Before then, we were talking two or three times a week. She had an answering machine. I would leave her a message and she would call me back, or vice versa. I did not know what to say, Linda. How do you tell a person that you saw them in this manner? Then, if you knew me better, you would understand that I don't like things that I can't explain. After a week or so, I left her two or three messages. She did not return my calls. I thought the only thing I could do is take the bull by the horns and go by her house. I knew she was there. I seen the car in the drive. I knocked on the door several times. Nobody come. I knew instinctively that Brenda was there and she just did not want to talk. So, I very calmly said, 'Brenda, you know who is here and I'm going to sit on the porch until you come out.' She immediately opened the door and said, 'Come on in.' She was nice and very cool, very distant. It was like a barrier was put up. She said, 'I know that you saw me as I really am.' That's an almost direct quote. And my first question was: 'How many more is there of you just like you?' She said, 'R, there are four or five all women.' I said, 'No men?' She said, 'None that I know of.' And she told me an incident. Here several months before this happened with me, she had gotten up around midnight to use the bathroom and she said, 'I heard a voice saying, 'Help. I have fallen. I need help.' She said, 'I went outside thinking it was my neighbor.' She said, 'Finally it dawned on me that it was not my neighbor. I got in the car and drove to a town about 40 miles away, following the voice. She said, 'I got there about 3 in the morning after just like playing the child's game about whether something is hot or cold. Follow your instinct and go to this town. She said, 'I drove into this little neighborhood and the voice was very strong at that point.' She said, 'I went around to the back.' She said, 'I was not scared. I knew that I was following something that was guiding me to this woman.' The woman told her through the bathroom window that was open a little bit that, 'I have fallen in the tub and I need help.' Brenda said, 'R, the woman was just like me.'"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"I never had nerve enough to tell Brenda that I saw her as a reptilian. She never mentioned the word reptilian. The only thing she ever said is, 'I know you saw me as I really am.' HOW WAS THE CAMOUFLAGE OR DUALITY PERPETUATED? What do you mean? WHAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN APPEARING IN A HUMAN FORM AND THE REAL REPTILIAN FORM? HOW WAS THE HUMAN FORM SUSTAINED IN PLACE OF THE REPTILIAN FORM? The only thing that I have ever come to terms with on that is that Brenda was totally exhausted from working. I think that allowed for whatever way that she maintained her human form, she was tired. SO YOU DIDN'T TALK WITH HER ABOUT IT? YOU DIDN'T SAY, 'HOW DO YOU DO THIS?' No, ma'am, I did not. I did not have nerve enough to mention the reptilian form. I did not know how to express it. She was very distant. She had put up a mental barrier and that was it. We never talked again to this day. TO THIS DAY, AND SHE STILL LIVES THERE WHERE YOU ARE? No, she lives about an hour from me now. AS FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED, SHE IS STILL ALIVE AND IS STILL THERE? Yes. I heard through the grapevine that she had married. Whether that's true or not, I am assuming it is. But I do not know it for a fact. HOW DID SHE EXPLAIN HER INTEREST IN UFOS? It seems to me that Brenda was the oldest child and she had a little brother I'm going to say a year or so younger than her. Then, her mother died in childbirth when Brenda was about four years old. She said, 'R, I knew my Daddy never touched me. I can remember that as a kid. But yet, he doted on my brother.' She said, 'When my mother died and they come and took away her body, she said she was standing in the doorway. My Daddy for the first time I could ever remember touching me, picked me up and set me on the edge of the dining table and told me: 'I don't know how to tell you this, but you are not mine. Your Daddy is from the heavens and I'm going to adopt you out.' And that afternoon, he took her to some children's home. And she was adopted. She never went to her mother's funeral. AND YOU'VE NEVER HAD A DISCUSSION WITH HER ABOUT HER PURPOSE, OR PURPOSE OF THESE OTHER WOMEN, AS REPTILIAN DISGUISED AS HUMAN? No. She would not call me again. The two or three times I tried to call her, she would never answer. DO YOU THINK OF YOURSELF AS REPTILIAN? I have often wondered that. I don't know. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN YOURSELF AS A REPTILIAN IN A MIRROR? No, ma'am. HAS ANYONE OUTSIDE OF THE WOMAN IN THE LIBRARY INDICATED TO YOU THAT YOU ARE REPTILIAN? Not really, but yes, vaguely. (R sought hypnosis in the 1980s and remembers the following.) 'During the regression, Linda, I can honestly tell you I don't know why it is so emotional, but it is I knew that I was the mother of seven children. I am the mother of only four children that I know of. I've never had a miscarriage. Never had a problem having a child. Never had a problem carrying a child. And yet, I knew that I had seven children and that I had a daughter that was dead. The hypnotist said, 'R, your children were used as seeding other civilizations because of your bloodline.' I said, 'What the heck does that mean? What bloodline?' She said, 'I don't want to get into it because I think it might scare you.' "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Bloodlines - Key to Human Abduction Syndrome? BLOODLINES MIGHT BE A KEY TO THE WHOLE ABDUCTION SYNDROME. JIM MARRS AND I ARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MESOPOTAMIAN BLOODLINE AND EXTRATERRESTRIAL PRESENCE. THAT RELATIONSHIP MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY THERE IS SUCH A STRONG DIVISION ON THIS PLANET BETWEEN MIDDLE EAST NATIONS AND OTHERS. BUT I'M ALSO CONFUSED ABOUT WHY IN BIBLICAL LITERATURE, THE REPTILIAN IS PAINTED AS THE BAD GUY IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN, WHEREAS YOU CAN ALSO LOOK AT IT THAT THE REPTILIAN IS THE ONE WHO WANTED TO WAKE UP ADAM AND EVE TO THE FACT THAT THE SO-CALLED 'GOD' WAS NOT A GOD, BUT WAS AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL THAT WAS MANIPULATING AND USING THEM. All I can tell you is that during my regression, I felt extraordinarily powerful. I felt I was an absolute authority. I felt bigger. I don't know how to explain it. I felt great power, that I had great power, great clout, great authority. I felt the word 'impervious.' It was like, Linda, almost a god. If I had said, 'Die,' people would die. If I said, 'Live,' that people lived. That my voice, my whole manner was one of total authority. I know that sounds odd, but it's the truth. That's all I can tell you about that. Also, too, do you remember the tales in Zecharia Sitchin where we were the experiments? You understand? OH, YES. I felt like that at some time or another, I had a great deal of genetic background, genetic information, and yet I know that in this lifetime, I've been very average as far as education goes. I know nothing about genetics except what I read. I certainly do not have those type skills. But in the regression, Linda, I know I did. WHAT DO YOU HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE SIX WOMEN ALL REPTILES ARE DOING? All I can tell you is from Brenda told me one other thing have you ever heard of the Church of Sparrow Hawk Village up in Oklahoma? NO. It's quite a well known metaphysical church up in Sparrow Hawk, Oklahoma. We went to a fire walking up there last year. Brenda told me that when she went there one time to hear a particular speaker from England about UFOs, that she seen another 'star cousin' were her words at the workshop there. When I asked her what the 'star cousin' was, she told me that you have to understand UFOs more. That was the only remark she made about a 'star cousin.' WHAT DO YOU NOW PSYCHICALLY THINK IS THE PURPOSE OF AUTHORITATIVE REPTILIANS MASQUERADING AS FEMALE HUMANS IN LIVES THAT DON'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY POWER? I think that Brenda did have power. I think I do have more power than I realize. I MEANT IN TERMS OF HUMAN POLITICS. That I don't know. Brenda did not have any power at all in that way. I don't know. Only that I have assumed that there is a pyramid effect. You have Illuminati, the ones that are behind the scenes. Then you have the ones that actually show to the public- like the President and then it comes down to the average working Joe. It's not a good answer. It's just is the most logical answer, but it answers nothing really. BUT DO YOU MEAN THAT IT WOULD BE LIKE THE SIX OF YOU HAVE SOME AUTHORITY AND POWER IN THE REPTILIAN WORLD AND YOU ARE DELIBERATELY MASQUERADED WITH AMNESIA IN NON-POLITICAL, NON-POWER HUMANS FOR ... WHAT? Linda, I don't know. All I can tell you is my feelings. I feel like I am being given keys to reptilian people. I've privately corresponded with some people who have seen reptilians. Sometimes they match what I saw. Sometimes they did not. Some of them have been very innocent-appearing people such as Brenda, possibly me, I don't know. All I know is that somewhere reptilians mean something to me in a way that I do not understand. WHAT WOULD BE THE REASON FOR HAVING TO MASQUERADE?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"I don't think the people are ready right now for such a thing. I think that only now are we coming into the consciousness of them and could tolerate it. I think 20 years ago you would have had panic in the streets. I think now through Zecharia Sitchin, Neil Freer, Barbara Marciniak, all these other people who are putting out this information it's coming forth for some reason at this particular time.\" If Earthfiles viewers have any information about the subject of this report, please e-mail: earthfiles@earthfiles.com Or mail to: P.
