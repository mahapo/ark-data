August 14, 2006 Kingston Lisle, Oxfordshire, England - A few days before I left for England, journalist Jaime Maussan in Mexico City called. Jaime is an TV and magazine investigative reporter for his own production company and last year went to the U. K. to fly over and videotape the 2005 Wayland's Smithy \"Mayan Calendar\" and Woolstone \"Mayan Clock.\" Jaime asked a Mexican archaeologist to study the 2005 wheat patterns and reported that the glyphs were counting down to 2012 and the end of the Grand Mayan Calendar. Another scientist in Australia studied the 2005 patterns at Wayland's Smithy and Woolstone and hypothesized that in addition to a countdown to 2012, there was another crucial date upcoming in mid-August 2007 - a time that might be linked to a catastrophic world event. That scientist and Jaime Maussan both expected that between August 8 and 15, 2006, in the same geographic region around the Uffington White Horse, that another major crop formation might occur which would reinforce the number counts in the 2005 \"Mayan Calendar\" and Mayan Clock.\" August 9, 2005, Wayland's Smithy \"Mayan Calendar\" W heat formation estimated to be 320 feet in diameter, reported August 9, 2005, near the ancient burial site of Wayland's Smithy, Oxfordshire, England.

A year later on the Saturday evening of August 5, 2006, Something did interact for the third time with the very dry wheat around the Uffington White Horse on Blowingstone Hill in Kingston Lisle, Oxfordshire, a little northeast of Wayland's Smithy and directly east of Woolstone. Sunday morning, August 6, the alert went out to crop investigators from Cropcircleconnector.com and The Silent Circle Cafe that the large, new pattern had been discovered. Ironically, that very morning I left Wiltshire and Oxfordshire to drive to Cardiff University in Cardiff, Wales, to visit the laboratory where the mysterious and replicating red cells from Kerala, India, rain water were being studied. Outer space life in test tubes, speculated Chandra Wickramasinghe, Ph.D., Astronomer and Director of the Cardiff Centre for Astrobiology at Cardiff University. On Tuesday afternoon, August 8, I learned about the Blowingstone Hill wheat pattern from good friends, Gill and Robert Nicholas in Wiltshire. So, I drove directly from Cardiff to Kingston Lisle. When I arrived, a researcher had a long tape measure and reported that from one side of the big ring around the 6-pointed star to the other side of the ring measured 330 feet.

Cropcircleconnector.com was calling it a \"merkabah.\" So, I began to study the history of the \"merkavah,\" or \"merkabah\" in Jew ish mysti ci sm goi ng back to the first century A. D. The Encyclopedia Britannica states that the \"Merkava, also spelled Merkabah, means 'Chariot' in Hebrew, or the throne chariot of God, as described by the prophet Ezekiel in Chapter 1 of the Bible.\" E zekiel envisioning the \"Chariot of the Lord\" as \"living creatures\" in a \"wheel within a wheel.\" Source: crystalinks.com/merkaba. Ezekiel 1: 1-28 (1909 authorized King James Version) 1 - \"Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar (near Babylon in modern Iraq), that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God. 2 - \"In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"3 - \"The word of the Lord came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the Lord was there upon him. 4 - \"And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire. 5 - \"Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man. 6 - \"And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings. 7 - \"And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass. 8 - \"And they had the hands of a man under thei r w i ngs on thei r four si des; and they four had their faces and their wings. 9 - \"Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward. 10 - \"As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle. 11 - Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies. 12 - And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went. 13 - As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire w ent forth lightning. 14 - And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning. 15 - Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces. 16 - \"The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl; and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel. 17 - \"When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not w hen they w ent. 18- \"As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four. 19 - And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. 20 - \"Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. 21 - \"When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. 22 - \"And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above. 23 - \"And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies. 24 - \"And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings. 25 - And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings. 26 - And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it. 27 - \"And I saw a the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire around about with it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness around about. 28 - \"As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.\" The Encyclopedia Britannica also says that the Ezekiel description \"became an object of visionary contemplation for early Jewish mystics. Merkava mysticism began to flourish in Palestine during the 1st"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Century A.D., but from the 7th to the 11th centuries, its center was in Babylonia (modern day Iraq). ...In Merkava mystical literature, the ascent of the visionary's soul is described a a perilous journey through seven spheres or 'heavenly dwellings,' manned by hostile angels. ... A successful visionary journey depended, in part, on the use of certain magical formulas (called seals) that were used to placate the angelic gatekeeper of each heavenly dwelling. The use of an incorrect seal could result in severe injury or a fiery death.\" Over time, the Merkabah \"chariot of God\" became associated with the overlapping triangles of the Seal of Soloman depicted as 3-dimensional. In the 1980s, researcher Drunvalo Melchizedek in Questa, New Mexico, began to teach a meditation of envisioning a 3-dimensional Seal of Soloman around the meditator to create a protective \"merkabah.\" Drunvalo writes that the Merkabah is a \"divine light vehicle allegedly used by ascended masters to connect with and reach those in tune with the higher realms.\" He explains that \"Mer\" means Light; \"Ka\" means Spirit; and \"Bah\" means Body. Further, he describes the Merkabah meditation as \"counter-rotating fields of light (wheels within wheels), spirals of energy as in DNA, which transport spirit/body from one dimension to another.\" D runvalo Melchizedek's illus tra tion of the Me r ka ba h me dita tion he t eaches, in which the meditator envisions a 3-dimensional Seal of Soloman around their body for protection and link to the highest spiritual source. Drawing © by Drunvalo Melchizedek, Crystalinks.com/merkaba. 6 - pointe d w he a t pa tte rn f ille d w ith ne a r ly a hundred diamond, or lozenge, shapes of standing crop was reported on Sunday morning, August 6, 2006; 330 feet in diameter. Aerial image © 2006 by Cropcircleconnector.com. The August 6, 2006, Blowingstone Hill, Oxfordshire County, wheat pattern does not resemble a classic 3-dimensional Seal of Soloman. But as a 6-pointed star within a ring, segmented with many \"realms,\" there is perhaps resonance with the original Ezekiel account of the \"chariot of the Lord,\" a Merkabah, traveling to the highest throne in the cosmos, which oversees \"many mansions\" and celestial realms. I ronic footnote from Jewish attorney after reading this Earthfiles report: \"One of the great tragedies of modern Israel is that today \"merkava\" also is the name of Israel's main battle tank, now in its fourth version (Merkava IV). What makes the merkava unique among the world's armies is that the central design feature is survival of the men who make up the tank crew. No other main battle tank is designed around that cardinal principle.\" F or further information about worldwide crop formations, please see reports below in the Earthfiles Archives and my book Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles in the Earthfiles Shop. • 08/13/2006 -- Part 1: Three Crop Formations Near Uffington White Horse • 08/12/2006 -- From Wiltshire to Red Alert At Heathrow Airport"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"• 07/21/2006 -- U.
