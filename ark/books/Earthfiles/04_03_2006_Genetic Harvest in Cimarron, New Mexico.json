Killing that cow! It's not even dead. It's alive! \" - UFO Abductee, Cimarron, NM C imarron, New Mexico, is east of Taos, and about 30 miles west of Clayton. April 3, 2006 Al buque rque , Ne w Me xico - Twenty-six years ago on May 5, 1980, a mother and her young son w ere drivi ng at ni ght on a road near Cimarron i n northeastern New Mexi co. Thei r home w as in Cl ayton about thirty miles further where their family expected them home around 9 p.m. But it was not until 1:15 a.m., four hours late. The mother was extremely upset and her son remembered seeing large, lighted objects in the air above a pasture where a cow was apparently being killed. The family called the Aerial Phenomenon Research Organization (APRO) which put the mother in touch with Albuquerque scientist and UFO investigator, Paul Bennewitz, then owner of Thunder Scientific Corporation and now deceased. Since the mother could not remember what happened in those four missing hours, Paul Bennewitz called human abduction investigator, Leo Sprinkle, Ph.D., who was Director of Counseling and Testing at the University of Wyoming in Laramie. At the time, I was three weeks from the first broadcast on May 28, 1980, of my television documentary about the worldwide animal mutilation mystery entitled A Strange Harvest for the CBS affi li ate i n Denver. I had i nterview ed Dr. Spri nkl e about human abduction cases l i nked to the unusual animal deaths. So, he shared with me the telephone notes he made during the phone call from Paul Bennewitz. \"Tues., 6 May 1980 Woman and 6-year-old boy; UFO came at her; UFOs in field, two front, two back and one on left. Big one was size of two Goodyear blimps. Two hundred feet over one to left came toward her; could see windows and amber light. She tried to move, could not. Confusion about boy (inside or out of car?). Got loose; got in car; finally started the car and drove on to Clayton, New Mexico, at 7:15 p.m. (Twenty-eight miles from UFO site to house.) Arrived 1:15 a.m. this morning. Four hour time loss? \"Paul Bennewitz asked feelings: She said that she felt she wasn't supposed to be there - always felt 'held.' Big one followed. \"She is twenty-eight years old. She has been upset. Son was awake several times last night. \"Paul has checked auto; finds N & S poles, magnetic, every foot or so from front to rear of car. She described 'wind in her face.' \"Cattle mutilations in the area? She said that there were many cows in the pasture.\" The following excerpts are from Leo Sprinkle's handwritten hypnosis transcripts w ritten in New Mexico a few days later on May 11, 1980.

Earthfiles Shop. ] Cimarron Case Hypnosis Excerpts The events began when the mother and son heard a cow bawling loudly, saw the animal down in a pasture and then their car became filled with a blinding white light. Mothe r: God! The brightest, whitest light I've ever seen. How can it fly like that? What is it? It's incredible. This is real. Oh, I'm scared! How can they be doing that? Killing that cow! It's not even dead. It's alive! "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Sprinkle: You see the cow? Mothe r: It's not even dead, but they're pulling it apart. Ugh! They're taking us with the cow. And my son. But I'm going in one ship and they're taking my son toward the other one. ... I don't know where they put the cow. Oh! (Anguish.) It was alive and they were doing it. I think it was knives. But it was still alive! (Shudders.) Later, after one of the hypnosis sessions, the woman described seeing a long (18\" by 1/2\" wide) silver, tapered knife. She said that the aliens plunged the instrument six inches into the chest of the cow. Then they worked on the sex organs while the cow was still alive and struggling. The woman said the aliens cut with a circular motion. Inside one of the craft, the mother fought unsuccessfully to keep her clothes on. She was put on a large table where a cold, metal object was inserted into her vagina. She screamed and swore angrily at the creatures about their violation of her body. She begged to have her son returned to her. Mothe r: ... I can see their faces - huge eyes, fill more than one-half the face. Like empty holes. There's something horrible, something I'm blocking out. ... They weren't all alike. Some were more repulsive. ...Some have evil eyes, no pupils, nothing in their eyes ... like black holes. ...Reddish eyes, like the Devil, a color I was freaked by. The one holding my arms doesn't seem to like the others. Long slanted eyes, I don't remember a nose. I'm screaming, 'I want my baby!' Oh, God, they just don't care. They put something up inside me. It's cold. It's metal. It's uncomfortable. ...Now they're poking me all over - sharp, but not so painful that I'm crying, just uncomfortable. 'Take that thing out of me!' ...Oh! Here's one dressed in white. Very brisk! Long fingers, real long fingers. By God! (This one is) kind of greenish, too. ...Not like grass, but light, almost jaundiced (yellowish). ...His head was round; he had no hair. ...Bony. Skinny. Almost skeletal. One in white, big eyes, cheekbone, chin. I don't remember a nose and mouth. ...Three men in white; they're strange looking. Thin, austere, dressed in white robes. They tell me they're sorry. They use that word, too. They apologize, 'Those things happen; it's unfortunate. The young one is all right.' Then they ask me to understand that it was necessary. They must continue. 'It's necessary what we do.' That's the last thing I remember them telling me. The w oman is then taken to w here she sees other non-human enti ti es. Mothe r: ...All kinds of sizes of people, different uniforms with patches on the left. A core of activity ... a couple of people pass us with ruffled collars. Long robes don't seem uti litarian or efficient. There was a Franciscan monk's collar. Belt, military type boots, patch on left chest - three lines and a line across the bottom. [ Editor's Note: For draw ings of non-human entities w earing ruffled collars and long robes, please see 102205 Earthfiles A Lifting Beam Tec hnology in Colorado Human Abduction. ] Some seemed to be \"mindless robots,\" some were \"pea green\" and some were the short, white-skinned and very large, black-eyed creatures which she did not like and called \"monstrous.\" Others were the tall (above six feet) type which appeared jaundiced. The mother perceived the tall ones to be more human-like and in control of the others. (Author's emphasi s.) The mother tried to run away and found herself cowering in a dimly lighted room that had a \"sickly sweet smell\" and a vat of liquid. Mothe r: Now I'm looking down at pools of water. Something is horrifying me. Sprinkle: Focus on the pools. Mothe r: I can't see what it is. Not sure. Seems to be body parts. (Breathes quickly.) Sprinkle: Body parts? Mothe r: Oh, yeah! Sprinkle: What do you see? Mothe r: Top of a bald head. Light is dim. I think I see an arm with the hand - human! Other ... (gasping) ... something red and bloody looking. Oh, God! I'm so scared at seeing this. Ah! Tongues, huge; they look real big. They're under liquid, real dark ... this is so weird. All kinds of things in that tank ... hearts, body parts, but not all cow. I look at the top of a bald head, maybe one of theirs. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Later, in conscious discussion with Leo, she said she had the impression that whatever she saw was some type of \"treatment,\" or experiment. She and her son both felt the creatures were trying to influence \"mind control\" over earth humans. They both referred to \"earth's plight\" without being able to articulate the nature of the plight. Mothe r: You know something? They don't like us. They are something monstrous to me now. I feel like I've been in Auschwitz. However, she did sense that some of the non-humans were kinder. There were differences between them, although she did not know why. After release from the craft, the mother became seriously ill with a vaginal infection. I interviewed the doctor who treated her and he told me he was never able to identify a specific bacteria or other source of infection. The doctor said he thought the mother survived because he gave her massive doses of gamma globulin to boost her immune system. This Cimarron human abduction case linked to a cattle death includes several different alien life forms working together toward some enigmatic common goal - or that one alien intelligence has several other biological entities, clones or species working for it. Huge aerial craft were involved and so was an underground base of operations where animal parts are processed, perhaps to produce humanoid-looking androids or clones? Or for food or \"treatments\"? Is this harvest of animal parts and abduction of humans a recent event? Or has the Earth been subjected to genetic harvests by other intelligences for eons?
