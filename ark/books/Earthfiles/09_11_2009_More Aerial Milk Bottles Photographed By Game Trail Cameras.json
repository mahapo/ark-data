This finally settles the reflection/real object controversy; whatever it is, this new data clearly confirms it is a real object.” - C hris Zietkiewicz, Ph.D., Senior Engineer “M ilk bottle” aerial object caught by game trail camera behind tree branch on December 1, 2008, between 11:05 PM and 11:29 PM Central in Edom, Texas. Image provided by camera owner. September 11, 2009 Edom, Texas - A year and a half ago on April 7, 2008, I interviewed Bob Coine, President and Owner of Heartland Studios, Inc., in Oregon, Illinois. His company is devoted to protecting, improving and managing wildlife, with an emphasis on white tail deer. See: 040708 Earthfiles. In order to keep track of how many white-tailed bucks and does use his farm and to estimate ages of the bucks, Bob explained that he uses a variety of game trail cameras. He has pure infrared cameras that do not flash and take images in non-visible infrared; standard 35mm cameras; and digital cameras that have an infrared beam to detect motion, which then triggers the camera to flash in the visible light spectrum. Six photographs taken in visible flash mode on November 16, 2007, beginning at 3:59 AM over a three minute time span, are still a mystery. The phenomenon continued with other “milk bottle” images near Ft. Hood, Texas, on July 21, 2008, and in Auburn, Alabama on January 22, 2009. 1) July 21, 2008, Game Trail Camera Time: 6:02 AM Central Near Ft. Hood, Texas Harold Sutton, near Ft. Hood, Texas: “I have three Moultrie 4.0 game cameras on our place here in Central Texas [ near Ft. Hood] that we have been monitoring since January 2008. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"We have had 3 distinctive types of unexpl ained li ghts. Fi rst w ere round lights show ing up in pictures where nothing should be. Next came beams of lights that were above the ground, but didn't touch the ground and on most occasions did not extend into the sky as high as the camera took the picture. This morning (July 21, 2008) at 6:02 am, with 2 bucks at the feeder, a small round light appeared under the feeder. The camera is set with an 8 second delay and 8 seconds later, 2 lights resembling milk bottles (like the ones in your November 2007 photos) appeared in my picture. They look to be about 4 to 5 foot off the ground and just to the left of the feeder. 2 bucks under the feeder did not seem to be aware they were there. I have made copies of many of the pictures of lights we have seen. Have you been able to find out any thi ng on the strange li ghts, yet?” 072108 at 6:02 AM Central image provided by Harold Sutton. 2) January 22, 2009, Game Trail Camera Time: 10:27 PM Central Auburn, Alabama A bove and below, two game trail images from Auburn, Alabama, dated January 22, 2009, at 10:27 PM Central.

After several nights I installed my wildlife camera below the driveway sensor and captured the attached images. The quality is not that great. I have no idea what could have made this light. The camera was facing north into the woods on a hill, no way it could have been a car or lights from afar. Any info on similar light formations would be appreciated. ” Now, two more extraordinary “milk bottle” images have surfaced from a December 1, 2 008, Case Number 19081 reported to MUFON and studied by Chris Zietkiewicz, Ph.D., Senior Engineer, Mountain Development and Design, Lyons, Colorado. In this Earthfiles report, I am beginning with email correspondence from Dr. Zietkiewicz and Bob Coine about the December 2008 event, followed for comparison by the original six digital images from Bob Coine taken on November 16, 2007. 3) December 1, 2008, Game Trail Camera Time: Between 11:05 PM and 11:29 PM Central Edom, Texas From: czietkiewicz@greenspeedisp.net Subject: Game Camera Phenomena Date: September 11, 2009 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com Bob Coine’s images [ of November 16, 2007] were the starting point for my investigation into game camera lights phenomena. Over the last few years I have collected dozens of strange game camera images. I obtain my images from MUFON, Jesses Hunting, occasionally individual parties, and other postings on the web. Many people only capture a single set of unexpected images and attribute them to equipment malfunctions or atmospheric phenomena. But as is the case with the milk bottles, I have the evidence demonstrating that the phenomena repeats across the Unites States. The most recent images were posted to MUFON as Case Number 19081, images attached below with EXIF data. From my experience, I judge these photographs to be genuine based on the EXIF data and features in the image. These are also the very first photographs showing the milk bottle behind a tree clearly indicating that this is a real object and not an internal camera reflection as I initially suspected. [ EXIF stands for “Exchangeable Image File Format” that defines the format for meta-data embedded into every digital photograph. This link contains more information: http://en.wikipedia.org /wiki/Exchangeable_image_file_format A read-out of the EXIF data for the “Milk bottle behind the tree” is shown below. Note that the date is confirmed and other technical data can be used to confirm the photograph was at the very least not faked by an amateur. In general, strange photo’s without EXIF data should be closely examined for evidence of manipulation tricks. Had this photo been modified by Photoshop, for example, a notation of this modification would be stored in the EXIF data; no such notation is evident. ]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"A spectroscopist in my formal training, my next step in this case and others is to determine how the different colors are formed. In the case of the milk bottle, a characteristic blue halo can be seen on only one side of the object. This is an active area of research and I am very interested in collecting other photographic evidence to help me chip away at the problem and ultimately to determine the underling physics of the object's motion. An important point to note is that the moon was below the horizon when Bob Coine captured the original November 16, 2007, “Milk Bottle” photographs and when the January 22, 2009, Alabama photos were captured. The light most definitely is NOT moon light refracting at a strange angle.

It is set to go off about every 12 minutes after 3 pictures have been taken. I have had this camera set up watching my feeder for about 3 months and the camera has taken over 1,000 pictures. When I checked out one set of pictures looking to see wild game, I came across 9 pictures that appeared to have some sort of light that was in the air and it was there while a wild boar was around the feeder (3rd photo below). The light never changed its plane and didn't seem to bother the boar. The light"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"started from right to left coming up an old path that comes from a creek. The first set of pictures shows the light coming from behind a branch, thus showing that it couldn't be on the front of the camera. Also there are times when it is close to the camera and you can see a definite size difference by measuring the size of the object. The location of the camera is such that a hill is behind the deer feeder, so that there is no way that a light source from a road or plane might be the cause. The first set of three pictures on December 1, 2008, starts at 11:05 PM and ends at 11:05 PM. The second set of three pictures starts at 11:17 PM and ends at 11:18 PM. The third set of three pictures starts at 11:28 PM and ends at 11:29 PM. When I first started to look at the pictures, I almost deleted the pictures, but then I noticed the light. I tried to figure out what the picture might be, but I just couldn't explain what the light could be. After showing the picture to several people, not one person could explain the lights. I have done a lot of research on the internet and have not been able to find anything that looks anything like this light. The fact that the boar is around the entire time really puzzles me because they s pook easily. The size of the light appears to be about the size of a bowling pin. Unfortunately, I personally never see the light so I can give no personal testimony. I am going to attach 2 pictures with the light and one picture in daylight without the light for review. ---------------------------- Original Message ---------------------------- Subject: More Milk Bottles From: Chris Zietkiewicz <czietkiewicz@greenspeedisp.net> Date: Sat, September 5, 2009 To: info@heartlandillinois.com -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hi Bob, How are you doing? I came across another wildlife photographer who recently captured milk bottle images very similar to your photographs [of November 16, 2007]. These [ December 1, 2008] “milk bottle” photographs are unique because they show the object behind a tree branch. This finally settles the reflection/real object controversy; whatever it is, this new data clearly confirms it is a real object. What are your thoughts after examining these photographs? I also hope they provide you with some comfort finally confirming that you captured a real object and not a mirage. Have you encountered any other strange phenomena with your camera's? I am still very actively research this matter and I am now convinced that something amazing is happening around us. Best regards, Chris Email from Bob Coine to Chris Zietkiewicz: Hi, Chris, Very interesting indeed as the photo IS real. Also interestingly, this is the 2nd time that I am aware of the image appearing in TX, with the first being the Harold Sutton pictures near Ft. Hood [ July 21, 2008]. I do move my cameras around intermittently, and do get orb-like objects regularly. I attribute the “orbs” to digital defects, but I have not had any further images of the milk bottle, which I believe to be a unique event. On the media side of things, I have not had any negative feedback at all, the experiences were very positive in fact. Again, it is very nice of you to share your information with me, and greatly appreciated!
