We never got up that high, as far as my memory goes, no. HOW FAR FROM THE RED SPHERE DO YOU THINK YOU WERE BEFORE YOU WENT UNCONSCIOUS? I would say my last memory before I went unconscious was about 4 feet off the ground, from my feet to the grass. VERY QUICKLY UPON RISING. WHAT IS THE VERY NEXT MICROSECOND MEMORY? Something very unpleasant. Seeing what was driving it, the UFO. WHAT DID YOU SEE? I would go so far as to say it was reptilian, of a reptile nature. Two Reptilian Beings and Wall Full of Rectangular-Shaped Drawers My first linear memory after the beam lifting us up and my blacking out was myself waking inside of this craft. I had opened both eyes slowly and I saw what was in front of me and I closed my eyes. I opened one eye again, but only a little bit just enough to see. I probably had a good 30 seconds to view my surroundings before I made any judgments on what to do next. The first thing I saw was the soldier because he was directly in front of me. Inside the craft, it looked like maybe a 12-foot wide circle, all white inside. There were many drawers all over the walls of this craft, from the floor to the ceiling. the drawers aren't there's no, it's all random pattern, these drawers. Some of the drawers are bigger, some smaller, they are all rectangular shaped with rounded edges. That was one uniform quality that all of the drawers had. DID THE DRAWERS HAVE HANDLES, BUTTONS OR WHAT? No, no handles. Just you could see the outline of the drawers, you could see the lines of separation from the walls and where the drawers began. It was at this point where I had looked straight ahead and had seen what I called the soldier, the darker brown, more muscular and shorter reptile being whatever you want to call them. \"T his image is an exact likeness of the soldier.\" Drawing © by \"Howard.\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"DID IT HAVE SCALES OR PEBBLY SKIN? There were two of them and they looked different from each other. One was rougher and more darker brown and rougher texture of skin. The other was a lighter green and a more smooth, less bumpy sky. SO, THE LIGHTER GREEN WAS A MORE REFINED AND THE BROWN WAS ROUGHER, BUT DID BOTH SHOW SCALES? I don't know how common these lizards are in other parts of the United States, but in Florida, if you go outside almost anywhere, you'll see a common lizard that runs around on the ground. F lorida Green Anole Lizards. P hotographs courtesy U. S.Wildlife Service. Of those common lizards, they change color from green to brown. I would say that the lighter green-colored one that was more smooth, looked very similar to these green lizards that are commonly found outside. You could see a diamond pattern in the skin, but it was not raised bumps like a crocodile's. However, the other brown one would have more of a crocodile's features.

Drawing © by \"Howard.\" I refer to them as 'the scientist' and 'the soldier.' The one on the right is the darker brown. The soldier is darker brown and the scientist is the lighter green. The smoother skin and color of the scientist even changed slightly from darker green areas to lighter green areas. But they looked more like a viper or a pretty green tree snake. G reen tree python © WhoZoo. DID THEY HAVE SNOUTS SOMEWHAT LIKE AN ALLIGATOR, BUT SHORT TO THE FACE? I wouldn't say short, more like the Florida lizards that are outside. They looked exactly like they did, exactly. They even had holes for ears. The snout would be like a lizard's snout. I'd say from the tip of the nose to the back of its head, it would be probably about 12 inches. WHERE THE EARS WOULD BE, THE HOLES, DID YOU SEE ANYTHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A CIRCULAR MEMBRANE AROUND THE HOLES?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"No. It was straight through. I could see its skull. There w as no membrane of it whatsoever. I could see a whitish bone underneath. Reptilians' Eyes Had Yellow, Star-Shaped Iris's Y ellow star-shaped iris surrounding a black, vertical pupil. Further color around the yellow iris was an orange color that became red that became brown from the center of the eye outward. Sketch © by \"Howard.\" Both of them had very interesting eyes. That's something I've been trying to research myself to try to find another animal like the eyes of what I saw. The eyes I saw were very bright yellow, but it's very hard to describe. If could take a star, it looked like a star like a tiger eye (gem) has a star pattern in it. WHEN YOU SAY THAT, YOU MEAN IT HAD A GLOW IN THE SHAPE OF A STAR LIKE A TIGER'S EYE? Right. And the insides of the star pattern was bright yellow, but on the outside of that pattern, it went from an orangish to a reddish to a brownish, in that order, from the center to the outside of the eye. So the very outer rim of the eye was brown and then faded into a red and then an orange and then a yellow in the very iris of the eye. And the iris was star-shaped, like a star fish is a good example, in a starfish pattern. SO YOU DID NOT HAVE THE IMAGE OF A CAT'S EYE? No. It did not look like a cat's eye, other than it DID have a vertical slit. But the vertical slit was not as pronounced as you might think. It was more rounded, more of a round slit, but it was definitely oblong. SO YOU'VE GOT AN OBLONG SLIT THAT IS BLACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STARFISH GLOW? Yes, the pupil was black. The yellow was so bright, it was almost a fluorescent yellow with a tint of green. It was so yellow, it was almost lime green. But it was very bright (reflective). DID BOTH OF THE REPTILIANS HAVE THE SAME EXACT EYES? No, the one I referred to as the scientist had more of a lime green eye, but yet it had the same star-shaped patterns and it did have the same orange-to-red-to-brown feature in the eyes. Shiny Silver Clothing DID THEY HAVE ANY KIND OF UNIFORM OR CLOTHING OVER THE LIZARD SKIN? Yes. Both of them had clothing on. the soldier had the clothing looks like a whitish-silverish garment, much like an emergency fire blanket. Even though it's silver, shimmering in the light just so, it reflects a lot of bright light and it would look white from a distance. WAS IT LIKE A JUMP SUIT OR A TUNIC? It was a one-piece suit, much like a Nike jump suit or something. It was short. It cut off half way above the knee on their legs and also cut off half way on the arm like our shirts and shorts do. There was cuffs, just like our shirts have around the arms and around the legs. The collar around the neck looked much like an older type of clothing worn in the late 1980s, where velcro was popular. They would have one-piece velcro belts. The collar also looked like a 1990s style where you had collarless shirts. There was no lapel on the collar, just the buttoning area. But there were no buttons. It looked like velcro and it just went around the neck. DID BOTH HAVE ON THE IDENTICAL TYPE OF JUMPSUIT? No. WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED WAS ON WHICH ONE? The one I referred to as the soldier had the uniform on that I just described. The clothing the soldier also had like a fire blanket, had a diamond-shaped criss-cross pattern of quilting in it. You could definitely see this diamond pattern in the material. There was also a logo on the right side of the soldier, an emblem. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Reptilian \"Soldier\" Had Flyi ng Serpent Logo On Clothing L ogo of flying serpent with tail wrapped around stars was on the right side of the soldier's clothing. Graphic depiction © by \"Howard.\" WHAT WAS IT? A flying serpent. The reptilian soldier had on the right side of his clothing a black triangle and a blue background and a circle that was blue. It contained this black triangle and on the black triangle was a serpent in the shape of an 'S,' a snake. And the snake had wings not like bat wings, but like feathered wings like a bird. The snake had its tail curled around and it had stars in the middle of the curl of the tail. WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THE SNAKE? The color of the snake was a reddish-orangish. HOW MANY STARS WERE IN THE CIRCLE OF THE TAIL? I couldn't tell you. I just know I saw stars. If I w ere to take just a guess, I would say there w ere six or seven. HOW TALL IS THE SOLDIER? It was shorter than the other one, below my height. I would say he was probably 5 feet or 5 feet 2 inches. WAS HE HOLDING ANY KIND OF INSTRUMENT IN HIS HANDS? No. The soldier did not have any instrumentation in his hands. He was at a keyboard of sorts looking into the screen. Soldier Reptilian Examining \"Fat\" Tissue On Computer Screen WHAT WAS ON THE SCREEN? It looked like body tissue, fat to be more specific, maybe at a magnification to just where you don't see the cells but just the tissue. WHY DID YOU THINK OF FAT? I did dissection in high school and it had the same color of fat. It was a yellowish-whitish color. And it had reddish-orange veins running through it. DID YOU ASSOCIATE THE SCREEN IMAGE THAT YOU THOUGHT WAS FAT WITH YOU, OR WITH THE COW YOU HAD JUST SEEN EXCISED? I thought it was me. That might not be correct, but that was just my assumption. Reptilian Beings Made Air Sounds With Mouths WAS THERE ANY MOVEMENT IN THE SNOUT IN RELATIONSHIP TO ANY SOUNDS THEY MADE OR WERE YOU ONLY RECEIVING TELEPATHIC THOUGHTS? No, I didn't receive any telepathic thoughts. They did make sounds. They did not speak. They did not try to c o mmuni c a te w i th me . WERE THEY CLICKING SOUNDS? No, i f you w ere to rush ai r out of your mouth - He makes a sound as if hi s mouth is very w i de open and exhaling air. NOT a hissing sound)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"WERE THEY BOTH MAKING THE SAME SOUNDS? Yes, but only in reaction. I'll tell you the rest of the story. Clawed, Four-Finger Hands HANDS, COULD YOU PLEASE THE NUMBER OF DIGITS, WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE, WHAT YOU WERE SEEING AT THE END OF THE DIGITS? Hands were very interesting. It had looked like there was a thumb and three fingers. FOUR IN TOTAL? Yes, four in total. HOW LONG IN COMPARISON SAY TO THE AVERAGE OF YOUR HAND? WHAT WAS THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IN TO YOUR HAND? The lengths of their two fingers on either side of their middle finger were probably an inch longer than mine. The middle finger was about 2 inches longer. So, the middle fingers of these things the middle finger is an inch longer than the fingers on either side of the middle fingers. The middle finger was thicker in width than the other two sides beside it, much thicker, like they looked more like if we had taken our two middle fingers and over evolutionary time they had fused together. But they were not two fingers wide, maybe a finger and a half had fused together. They were thick, a lot thicker than a man's fingers. Also, their thumb is pushed back, so their thumb is not in the same position as our thumb. It's moved back I'd say maybe a good inch and a half up toward the elbow. I'd say probably just above where our wrist bone attaches. From where you can see your thumb, the webbed part, probably an inch and a half higher up toward the elbow. COULD YOU SEE WEBBING BETWEEN THE FINGERS? No, not more than ours. WERE THEIR NAILS? Yeah, they had claws. They were probably about like a dog's claws, maybe a half inch or less in length. DARK? In color, like a dog's. A black to a light brown. They were worn on the ends, where it was lighter. Reptilian Beings Walked On Their Toes DID BOTH THE SOLDIER AND THE SCIENTIST HAVE THE IDENTICAL FINGERS AND FEET? Yes. DID THEY HAVE COVERINGS ON THEIR FEET? No, they had no shoes, and the feet were very interesting. The feet also had three digits, but the fourth digit was up above the ankle on the inside, much like a dog's. They walked on their toes. YOU DID SEE THEM MOVE AND YOU DID SEE THEM WALK ON THEIR TOES? Yes. And they didn't have shoes. AND WALKING ON THEIR TOES. Exactly like that. WITH THIS SILVER-WHITE SHINY SHORTS AND TOP? But it was all one piece. Bony Ridge Over Eyes and Around Heads THE TOPS OF THE HEADS, DID YOU SEE ANY BONY RIDGES? Well, their eyes their sockets and eyebrows they are not straight in front of the face like ours are. They are not on the side of the head, either. They are sort of in between. They are at a diagonal kind of on the side and kind of in the front. IF I UNDERSTAND, IT'S BECAUSE THEIR FACE IS MORE NARROW THAN OURS? Yes."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"JUST LIKE WE WOULD THINK OF A LIZARD? Right, and as I said, there is no better description other than to take a lizard outside and look at its face and make it 5-foot-tall and make it walking on two legs. They had a thick eyebrow region, but no hair on it - just a thick protuberance over the eyes. It was an eyebrow ridge which continued from the eyebrow around the top of their head to the back and met in the middle in the back of the neck. Reptilian Scientist Was Wearing White Lab Coat WHAT WAS THE SCIENTIST WEARING? The scientist, believe it or not, had a lab coat on. The lab coat had a tail, like a tuxedo would have a tail, a slit up the middle. They would taper off into a point on the end of the tails. These two material tails overlapped its real tail, physical tail. Each of these lizard creatures had a physical tail. HOW LONG? About 3 feet. The tail did not drag on the ground. It lifted upright. And it moved. THE TAIL MOVED? The tail moved. ONLY SIDEWAYS? OR SIDEWAYS AND VERTICAL? Mostly sideways, but the very last three inches of the tail could curl and it curled in all directions. THE LAB COAT. WAS IT SILVER-WHITE AS WELL? This was like a white cotton lab coat. There was nothing unusual about it at all. ANY SYMBOL OR LOGO ON IT? No, it did not. You asked me before if the soldier had any devices and he did not. But the scientist did have a device. The scientist had what I would call a clipboard. It was about a half-inch thick, made of a grey material that looked like plastic. It was holding that in its left hand. BUT NO WRITING IMPLEMENT? No. I did see the keyboards they were accessing. The keyboard had geometric shapes, but they were not in any kind of order. Reptilian Computer Keys Were Geometric Shapes DID YOU RECOGNIZE ALL THE GEOMETRIC SYMBOLS AS SOMETHING WE WOULD RECOGNIZE? A few of them. You know how we have adopted for play, fast forward, rewind and such for VCRs and tape things. We've kind of adopted those as symbols. WHICH ARE LARGELY TRIANGLES GOING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS? Right. There w ere a couple of triangles. But as w e would take triangles and put one up, like north, south, east, west. Theirs would be two triangles and they weren't even in that orientation. It was random, it looked like. Some of the symbols I did not recognize. They just looked like odd shapes. The symbols were black and the buttons were also black. DID YOU SAY THE KEYS ARE BLACK? Yes, and each key is probably 1.5 inches in size. WHAT IS THE COLOR OF THE SYMBOL ON THE BLACK? No, the whole symbol is the key. ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT MOLDED SYMBOLS? IN OTHER WORDS, HOW ARE YOU SEEING THE SYMBOLS ON THE BLACK BACKGROUND IF EVERYTHING IS BLACK? If you were to take a normal computer keyboard and you were to call each button a raised protuberance from that keyboard. These keys aren't like all of our keys are squares. All of their keys are different in shape. Each key is a geometric shape. Each key is not a half inch by half inch like ours. Each of their keys was an inch or inch and half. Very big keys. BIG FINGERS! And the keys are black. There weren't many buttons. There are more buttons on our keyboards than there is on what I saw. I think they had less than fifteen keys."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THE SCIENTIST HOLDING THE SILVER NOTEPAD, DID YOU GET TO SEE THE FRONT OF IT? No, I only saw it from the side. There was a glare on it, so it did have a shiny, light reflective top. Encounter With Reptilian Soldier GOING BACK TO THE FIRST MOMENT WITH THE SOLDIER, WHAT HAPPENED? I opened up my eyes and then closed them and opened up the one eye and I could see. I took a look around. That's how I'm able to give to you the descriptions I've given to you. I had about 30 to 35 seconds of a good, long hard look. It seemed like 5 minutes to me. I was able to look in great detail at these creatures and the ship and what my position was at that time. At first, I saw the soldier on the right. At first, I saw the keyboard he was controlling and I saw the image he had on the screen, which I thought was my fat. Then I looked over to my left and I saw the scientist one. He was also involved in a screen that was mounted inside the wall, like an inset. The screen was inset into the wall. The keyboard slightly comes out from the wall about waist high. The keyboard comes out of the wall maybe about 5 inches. Top the left I saw the scientist, but I could not see what was on his screen. But I did see him holding the clipboard. After I saw them and took a look at the drawers in between them, I looked around the craft and it was all white and I looked over to my left and that's when I noticed that my buddy was laying next to me. We were separated by about 5 foot of distance. We were sitting on beds. The beds were about 3 feet high off the floor and the actual material we were laying on top of was clear. It could have been a glass or plastic type material. There was a square holding it up, a square-shaped pedestal beneath the clear square. At the top near our heads, there were two cylinders. The cylinders were about an inch and a half in diameter, much like a PVC pipe, but clear like acyllic plastic pipe or glass, and the ringed insulators were opaqe, shiny me ta l . H oward said the ones he saw in the craft were clear like glass and the ringed insulators were \"opaque, shiny metal.\" There were three rings on the tops of each cylinder. The rings were much like electrical insulators that you would see on wires or telephone poles, where they were disc-shaped, three of them, one on top of each other separated by about a quarter-inch between each disc. There was also a curved arched band that appeared to connect one cylinder to the other cylinder, and it went over the forehead of my body. Mine was to the side. It was not over my forehead. My buddy was asleep. He was unconscious. It was at this point looking around that I decided to have a better look at what the soldier was looking at on the screen. I had leaned up my head a little bit to turn my had to the side to look, very slowly because I didn't want to alert the creature to my movement. I got a little more daring. I decided I would lift up a little more and I probably got half way up with my torso as I was looking. At this point, I would say I was moving around a little bit and if a human had been standing there, it would have seen the movement with its peripheral vision. A human would have seen the movement. But this being could not see. It was totally unaware. When I got with my torso almost completely sitting up, that's when the soldier decided to turn around to look at me. But it didn't look at me to know I was there. It sniffed me to know I was there. When I say that, it took a breath of air at the screen. It went (makes a breathing in sound through his nose.) Then it turned and looked at me, so I imagine it smelled me somehow. At this point, it turned and it stepped away from the keyboard and the scientist on the left also stopped what it was doing and looked at me. Now, when the soldier looked at me, its eyebrows it did not have hair but the eyebrow area lifted up a little like, 'Huh?' And the scientist on the left, when it saw me, I saw a clear emotional expression of fear. FROM THE SCIENTIST? Yes, from my being awake. When I was looking at it and they both turned to look at me, that is when I decided"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"to take my legs off the table. I proceeded to stand up on my two feet. At this point, the scientist saw me stand up and it got afraid. It immediately ran to get something to the left and was opening a door. At the same instance, the soldier on the right hand side began to approach me and walked toward me. The distance from the soldier on the right and me sitting on the bed was probably no more than 6 feet. When I had stood up and it started to approach me, I started to approach it. I took an offense position. My hands were up and I was ready to fight. It assumed also the same position. It put its hands up and even in a closed fist near its head. It got a squattier position with its legs. At this point, I could tell you w hat was running through my head at the time. What was running through my head was for some reason, I don't know why. I'm not a macho man. I don't weigh much. I'm not huge in build. But I did not fear these things. I did not have fear of them. More shock than anything. When I had decided to approach the soldier and we both had taken our positions, I was going to jump one of them. (laughs). Then when both were aware, I decided to look to the left and wake up my buddy because I needed help. I didn't feel like I could take two of these things on by myself. So, very quickly I turned my head and yelled for my friend's name. 'Hey, get up!' His eyes just started to open and he looked like he was just waking up. As soon as I yelled his name, I looked directly back. The whole thing took no more than a second, but that second cost me. It (soldier) decided to sucker punch me. But it didn't punch me. It hit me with its tail.\" C ontinued in Part 3 . Reptile, or Lizard, Sexual Aggression.
