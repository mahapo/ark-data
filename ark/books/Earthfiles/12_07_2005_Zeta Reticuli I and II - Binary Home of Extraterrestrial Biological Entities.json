Original magazine cover © 1974 Astronomy . December 7, 2005 Thirty-one years ago the December 1974 issue of Astronomy magazine featured a 15-page article entitled, \"The Zeta Reticuli Incident\" by astronomer and author, Terence Dickinson. His article began: \"A faint pair of stars, 220 trillion miles away, has been tentatively identified as the 'home base' of intelligent extraterrestrials who allegedly visited Earth in 1961. This hypothesis is based on a strange, almost bizarre series of events mixing astronomical research with hypnosis, amnesia, and alien humanoid creatures. \"The two stars are known as Zeta 1 and Zeta 2 Reticuli, or together, as simply Zeta Reticuli. They are each fifth magnitude stars - barely visible to the unaided eye- located in the obscure southern constellation Reticulum. this southerly sky location makes Zeta Reticuli invisible to observers north of Mexico City's latitude.\" The hypnosis, amnesia and alien humanoid creatures that Mr. Dickinson referred to are from the Betty and Barney Hill abduction case in the White Mountains of New Hampshire on their way home to Portsmouth on September 19, 1961. The events and effort to unlock missing time with psychiatrist, Benjamin Simon, M. D., were detailed in the book, The Interrupted Journey © 1966 by John G. Fuller.

Image from Betty Hill. Historically, Betty and Barney Hill were the first documented case in what has come to be known as the \"human abduction syndrome\" in which non-human entities take humans from bedrooms, cars, yards, parks and other human environments into round rooms aboard what the human abductees assume are craft from outer space controlled by the non-human entities. During these events, human subjects often describe medical examinations, extractions of sperm or ova, mind downloads to and from the aliens, and sometimes learning sessions in front of 3-dimensional screens, holographic spaces or wall maps. In the Betty and Barney Hill experience, Betty described the alien \"leader\" showing her a star map of his home solar system in the Zeta Reticuli I and II binary star system 37.5 light years from Earth. Our Sun was also shown on the aliens' star map and connected by lines to Zeta Reticuli I and II apparently to indicate a one-way trade route."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"A bove: Wide view of Zeta Reticuli I and II binary star system 39.41 light years from Earth.

Betty Hill Describes Zeta Reticulan Non-Humans and Their Star Map Betty Hill, The Interrupted Journey © 1966, from dream memory: \"...I would judge them to be 5' to 5'4\". Their chests are larger than ours; their noses were larger (longer) than the average size, although I have seen people with noses like theirs - like Jimmy Durante. Their complexions were of a gray tone; like a gray paint with a black base; their lips were of a bluish tint. Hair and eyes were very dark, possibly black. The men were all dressed alike, presumably in uniform, of a light navy blue color with a gray shade in it. They wore trousers and short jackets, that gave the appearance of zippered sports jackets, but I am not aware of zippers or buttons or closing. Shoes were a low, slip-on style, resembling a boot. I cannot remember any jewelry, or insignia. They were all wearing military caps, similar to Air Force, but not so broad on the top. Betty Hill's Star Map Description under hypnosis with Dr. Benjamin Simon:"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"\"...I asked him where he was from. Because I said that I knew he wasn't from the earth, and I wanted to know where he did come from. And he asked if I knew anything about the universe. And I told him no. I knew practically nothing. That when I was in graduate school, we were taught that the sun was the center of the solar system, and there were nine planets. And then later, of course, we did make advances. And I told him about seeing, I think I met him at one time. Harlow Shapley; he wrote a book, too.\" [ Editor's Note: Harlow Shapley, astronomer, November 2, 1885 - October 20, 1972. Shapley was offered directorship of the Harvard College Observatory which was to remain his academic home for the next 75 years. Perhaps the greatest - and certainly the most fruitful - of Shapley's innovations was the establishment of the graduate school of astronomy as a part of the educational structure of Harvard University. His telescopes at Harvard possessed smaller apertures, but wider angular fields than Mt. Wilson in California, in which he also worked. It was with these that Shapley and his collaborators continued to explore the Magellanic clouds, to probe the spatial distribution of external galaxies; and in 1938 discovered new dwarf galaxies in Sculptor and Fornax and the center of our galaxy. ] Betty Hill: \"And I had seen photographs that he had taken of millions and millions of stars in the universe. But that was about all I knew. So, he said that he wished I knew more about this, and I said I wish I did, too. And he went across the room to the head of the table and he did something, he opened up, it wasn't like a drawer, he sort of did something, and in the metal of the wall, there was an opening. And he pulled out a map, and he asked me had I ever seen a map like this before? And I walked across the room and I leaned against the table. And I looked at it. And it was a map - it was an oblong map. It wasn't square. It was a lot wider than it was long. And there were all these dots on it. And they were scattered all over it. Some were little, just pin points. And others were as big as a nickel. And there were lines. There were on some of the dots, there were curved lines going from one dot to another. And there was one big circle, and it had a lot of lines coming out from it. A lot of lines going to another circle quite close, but not as big. And these were heavy lines. And I asked him what they meant. And he said that the heavy lines were trade routes. And then the other lines, the solid lines were places they went occasionally. And he said the broken lines were expeditions ... \"So I asked him where was his home port? He said, 'Where are you on the map?' I looked and laughed and said, 'I don't know.' So he said, 'If you don't know where you are, then there isn't any point of my telling where I am from.'\" U nder hypnosis, Betty Hill described the star map she was shown \"by the leader aboard the ship.\" Later, she sketched it above. She said she was told that the heavy lines marked regular trade routes, and the broken lines recorded various space expeditions. Our own Sun was later identified by amateur astronomer, Marjorie Fish, to be the upper right dot connected by two lines to Zeta Reticuli I and II. Map from The interrupted Journey © 1966 by John G. Fuller. Marjorie Fish, Amateur Astronomer, Makes 3-D Star Map After John Fuller's book was published containing the star map drawing by Betty Hill,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Marjorie E. Fish (Ohio schoolteacher, amateur astronomer and Mensa member) wondered if the objects in Betty's star map might represent some actual pattern of galactic objects. Marjorie visited Betty Hill in the summer of 1969 after Barney Hill had died earlier that year. Terence Dickinson quoted Marjorie Fish's description of that meeting in his December 1974 Astronomy article \"On Aug. 4, 1969, Betty Hill discussed the star map with me. Betty explained that she drew the map in 1964 under posthypnotic suggestion. It was to be drawn only if she could remember it accurately, and she was not to pay attention to what she was drawing - which puts it in the realm of automatic drawing. This is a way of getting at repressed or forgotten material and can result in unusual accuracy. She made two erasures showing her conscious mind took control part of the time \"Betty described the (star) map as three-dimensional, like looking through a window. The stars were tinted and glowed. The map material was flat and thin (not a model), and there were no noticeable lenticular lines like one of our (human) three-dimensional processes. It sounds very much like a reflective hologram. Betty did not shift her position while viewing it, so we cannot tell if it would give the same three-dimensional view from all positions or if it would be completely three-dimensional. Betty estimated the map was approximately three feet wide and two feet high with the pattern covering most of the map. She was standing about three feet away from it. She said there were many other stars on the map, but she only (apparently) was able to specifically recall the prominent ones connected by lines and a small distinctive triangle off to the left. There was no concentration of stars to indicate the Milky Way (galactic plane) suggesting that if it represented reality, it probably only contained local stars. There were no grid lines.\" B eads on thin strings in model prepared by Marjorie Fish so that each star is suspended on a separate thread at its appropriate distance and position from our Sun. Colors denote spectral type. Our Sun, far right, is a yellow G2. Zeta Reticuli I and II, also G type stars, are bottom center. Marjorie Fish found 16 stars whose positions were close to those in Betty Hill's drawing. One of the discoveries provoked by Betty Hill's 1964 star map is that all the stars in Betty's map are G-type yellow suns similar to our own Sun.
