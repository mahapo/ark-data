April 28, 2005 Sonora, California - Two years ago in November 2003, two brothers moved together into an apartment on the outskirts of Sonora. One of the brothers is named Mark Olson, a high school graduate who is a certified interpreter for the deaf, computer business specialist and a graduate of the Universal Life Seminary with a doctoral degree in metaphysics. Mark had no specific interest in the UFO phenomenon when he and his brother decided to live in the rural community and split living costs. But only a few months after moving into their new place, Mark noticed a large bruise on the small of his brother's back.

Webcam images © 2004 by Mark Olson. Mark's brother was not aware of any trauma and did not even know he had a bruise. So, Mark got his webcam out and took an image that showed the bruise had circular \"bumps\" that formed the pattern of a diamond. Above the diamond was a fifth bump. A couple of days later, his brother became ill with a low temperature and then for three days woke up with a bloody right nostril. Mark Olson recently contacted me about the strange events he and his brother have witnessed and videotaped the past year at their Sonora, California, apartment. Here is Mark now picking up the story from March 2004 after his brother had the repeating bloody nostril. Interview: Mark Olson, D.M., Universal Life Seminary Doctor of Metaphysics; certified interpreter for the deaf and computer business specialist, Sonora, California: \"A couple of days after that, he came home and was scratching his ear and that gave me goose bumps and I told him to let me see his ear. He turned around and behind his ear was a long, red scar or mark or something. That's when I wondered what was going on because I have the exact same scar behind my ear.

I'm not positive, but there have been some very strange dream-like memories in my past as well as my mother and sister. All of us have the same mark on our legs a triangular mark kind of like a scoop out of the skin. Unexplained scar on the inside of Mark Olson's left thigh, similar to scars on his Mother's and sister's inner left thighs. Photograph © 2003 by Mark Olson. WHICH LEG? On the left inner thigh."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"THE TYPES OF BEINGS THAT YOU, YOUR MOM AND SISTER HAVE SEEN IN DREAMS, WHAT HAVE THEY BEEN LIKE? The only thing I can remember are beings slightly taller than me. I'm not very tall. I stand only 5 feet tall. This is when I was a child and these people were just slightly taller than me and there were lots of them moving around me very fast. They weren't talking. It was very scary. I must have cried out because all of a sudden at the same time they turned towards me and came at me. When I wanted to, I couldn't scream and I couldn't move. The next thing I remember after that was my mother shaking me in bed and telling me to wake up. She was shaking me! I was awake, but I couldn't move and I couldn't tell her I was awake. WHAT YEAR WAS THAT, MARK? 1971 or 1972. HOW OLD? 5 or 6 years old. YOU WERE BORN IN? May 1966. OVER THIS TIME PERIOD UP UNTIL YOU MOVED WITH YOUR BROTHER INTO THE APARTMENT IN SONORA, HAD YOU EVER HAD WHAT YOU CONSIDERED TO BE CONSCIOUS FACE-TO-FACE ENCOUNTERS WITH ENTITIES? No. Nothing conscious. That's why I'm not sure I could call it an abduction scenario. I have no idea what happened, except I ended up with a scar. I have scars all over my body and I can tell you exactly where, when and how they happened, except for this one scar. WHEN YOU'VE ASKED YOUR MOTHER AND SISTER ABOUT IT, WHAT DO THEY SAY? I remember asking my mom. I was wearing shorts and showed her the mark. The first thing out of her mouth was, 'Where did you get that?' It startled me because she sounded upset. I told her I was just going to ask her that. That's when she showed me her scar. She told me that when she was about 5 or 6 years old, she remembers being in what she described as a 'doctor's office' being held down on a table and being told she was going to get some kind of a shot or inoculation. She was screaming and trying to get up and they wouldn't let her up. The weird thing is that she said she saw my grandmother standing nearby staring at her, face impassive, not moving. This is unlike my grandmother who would get very upset if we even scratched ourselves. WHEN YOU ASK YOUR MOM SPECIFICALLY, 'WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS TRIANGULAR SCAR ON OUR LEGS MEAN?' WHAT DOES SHE SAY? She says that she truly believes in her heart that we have been experimented on. That just gives me the creeps. To hear my mother, she has always been a down-to-earth logical person and for her to make a statement like that just seems like unreal, surrealistic. It just doesn't make sense to me that she could say something like that. My mother needs proof for anything. High Strangeness in Sonora, California Skies, 2004 COULD YOU START NOW AND EXPLAIN WHAT YOU SAW FIRST THAT PUZZLED YOU AND THAT HAS MADE YOU FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS USE YOUR CAMERA SO MUCH? While I was seeing these incidents with my brother, I decided to borrow a digital camera from a neighbor so I could document what was happening. While I was learning to use it, I was taking pictures of things inside and outside the house flowers, sky, airplanes, trees, whatever I could. After I started taking pictures, I noticed a few days after I downloaded them to the computer from the digital camera, there were objects showing up in the pictures that I didn't see when I was taking the pictures. May 14, 2004"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"That was happening so much, I decided on May 13, 2004, to go out and buy a digital camcorder. I started practicing with that and the very next day on May 14, 2004, I was watching and videotaping an airplane and its contrail and this object just dropped down from the top of the screen above the plane and slightly behind it and went behind the contrail, did a crazy maneuver where it looked like it stopped on a dime a couple of times and then shot straight up again in front of the contrail. Two camcorder frames one second apart as white object circled the jet's contrail, May 14, 2004, over Sonora, California. Images © 2004 by Mark Olson. YOU AND I WERE LOOKING AT THAT TOGETHER ON OUR COMPUTERS TODAY AND I REMINDED YOU THAT IT LOOKS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE UNIDENTIFIED WHITE OBJECT THAT MADE A CIRCULAR PATTERN AROUND THE VERY FIRST VIRGIN FLIGHT OF THE CONCORDE BACK IN THE 1960S. Yes, and I haven't seen that video either. THE QUESTION REMAINS: IN OUR SKIES AND ATMOSPHERE, THERE ARE ROUND OBJECTS, CYLINDRICAL, TRIANGULAR AND THESE WHITE, ALMOST GLOWING, OBJECTS THAT SEEM TO MONITOR OR BE SOMEHOW INVOLVED WITH AIRCRAFT WE HAVE IN THE SKIES. Ye s . June 10, 2004 OUT OF EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE SEEN AND VIDEOTAPED OVER THE LAST YEAR OR SO, WHAT IS THE VERY STRANGEST? Camcorder frame of \"cylinder\" object in daylight, June 10, 2004, Sonora California. Image © 2004 by Mark Olson. There was the cylinder in bright daylight, which was back in June 2004. I looked up and thought I was watching an airplane except that it was not moving. When I grabbed my camcorder and looked through it, I could not see wings, tail fins, nothing. This was just a cylinder with squared off ends and a black line two thirds of the way down, so it kind of looked like an explanation point. DO YOU HAVE THAT POSTED AT YOUR WEBSITE UNDER A SPECIFIC DATE? Yes, that would be June 10, 2004, on the May-June Clips page. Triangle-Shaped Aerial Objects May 31, 2004 Triangular object with red and green lights was videotaped for about five minutes on May 31, 2004, as it slowly cruised to the south over Sonora, California, and passed very close to a helicopter. Image © 2004 by Mark Olson. COULD YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE TRIANGLES THAT YOU HAVE GOTTEN WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"SOURCE IS, BUT DESCRIBE SOME OF THE TRIANGULAR PATTERNS YOU'VE GOTTEN ON TAPE. Sure. One night back in May 2004, on May 31st, I was sitting outside with a friend of mine. The moon was almost full and behind us. This object appeared above Lyons Bald Mountain and when I looked at it through my camcorder, it had two lights. But as it came closer to us, we noticed there were three lights. As we were both watching it, my friend said, 'Do you see that airplane that's right next to it?' So I pulled out a little wider and you see this huge triangular object actually pass the helicopter. It looked like the helicopter had to get out of its way. That was amazing. AND HOW IS THAT IDENTIFIED AT YOUR WEBSITE, WHAT DATE? That would be under the May 31, 2004 \"More UAP clips\". This triangular object was moving so slowly that if it were a conventional aircraft, it would have fallen out of the sky. COULD YOU HEAR ANY SOUND? No, none whatsoever. We did hear the helicopter. BUT NO INTERACTION BETWEEN THE HELICOPTER AND THE OBJECT THAT HAD FIRST TWO LIGHTS AND THEN THREE IN A TRIANGULAR PATTERN? None, except that it passed right by the helicopter. We videotaped the thing moving across the sky for at least 5 minutes. SO IT WAS MOVING THAT SLOWLY. Yes, very slowly. HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU SEEN THE TRIANGULAR PATTERN OF LIGHTS THAT MAKES NO SOUND? Five times. And each time, these objects are moving very slowly and they have one red light and two green lights. They are huge compared to other aircraft we've been monitoring here! THAT COLOR CONFIGURATION, HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO NORMAL CIVILIAN OR MILITARY AIRPLANES? Usually a normal aircraft has one red light, one green light and one white light or any combination thereof. But most of the time, the white and the red lights blink as per the FAA signaling. THE UNUSUAL TRIANGULAR OBJECTS DO WHAT? They don't signal at all. They don't blink. The lights don't glow like the airplanes. They have some kind of diffuse look to them. They are pretty, very pretty lights. But these lights are huge! They are spaced so they are two or three times bigger than the airplanes. In the past year, I have seen more over Sonora than I have ever seen anywhere. I have never seen so many different triangular objects, different colors, cylinders, triangles, disk shapes, orbs, white ones and bright lights at night. These are just amazing to me. It's amazing that the government won't talk about them, but it seems clear to me that the government has encouraged the notion that people who see these things are eccentric. BECAUSE THEN IT TAKES THE HEAT OFF THEIR HAVING TO EXPLAIN WHAT THEY MIGHT BE OR THAT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE. One thing is for sure, I am not seeing marsh gas reflecting the light of Venus! (laugh) June 15, 2004 WHAT ELSE HAS HAUNTED YOU? Haunted me? That would be the day time triangle. Oh, man! Back on June 15, 2004, five days after the cylinder."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Camcorder image of triangular-shaped object in daylight, June 15, 2004, Sonora, California. Digital image © 2004 by Mark Olson. I went out on my back porch, sat down, looked up and saw a flash over the trees that are about 100 yards away from me. I thought it was an airplane reflecting the sunlight. But when I looked through my camcorder, I saw three lights in a triangular formation with a fourth light in the middle. But I could not see a craft where they were attached to. And they moved very slowly to my south, from the left to the right as I faced northeast. They were moving to the south. There is a tree about 20 feet from my back balcony, a small pine tree. This object went behind the branches as it flew and that's also included on my website. I BELIEVE THAT IS YOUR FEATURED PHOTOGRAPH ON MOST OF YOUR PAGES IN THE UPPER RIGHT HAND CORNER. Yes, that is one of the most amazing I've seen. THE PHOTOGRAPH ITSELF IS PUZZLING BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE ALMOST LIKE A PATTERN OF GLOWING THINGS, BUT NOT SO MUCH THE WAY WE THINK OF STRUCTURE AS AN AIRPLANE. Correct. When I looked at it, it looks like the three outer lights are in a triangular formation, but the fourth one seems to be a little farther away, almost like it was a flying pyramid. 2005 January 14, 2005 Shape Changer Mark and brother faced west as object appeared at 9:27 p.m. over Lyons Bald Mountain, changed shape and then disappeared. Video image © 2005 by Mark Olson. IN 2005 SINCE JANUARY JUST IN THE LAST FOUR MONTHS, WHAT HAS BEEN THE MOST SPECTACULAR EVENTS YOU HAVE SEEN WITH YOUR EYES AND HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DOCUMENT ON CAMERA? Back in January, I acquired a couple of other people who have been interested in these objects and have been willing to go out and videotape with me. On January 14, we went up to a place near a town called Twain Harte which overlooks the valley and looks over at Lyons Bald Mountain. While we were out there on January 14, several objects were videotaped by both cameramen. On January 14, one of the most spectacular there was an object that looked like it was changing shape as it was flying over Lyons Bald Mtn. That was about 9:27 p.m. Then shortly after that about 20 minutes later, a color-changing object showed up. COULD YOU START WITH THE SHAPE-CHANGER AND EXPLAIN WHAT YOU SAW FIRST AND WHAT KEPT CHANGING? I was facing west looking over the mountain and I saw this object just flying. I thought at first it was just an airplane, but I did not see any FAA lights. When I looked at it through my camcorder and started videotaping it, the object actually changed shape. It started out round, then kind of warped into this cylinder thing and it was changing shape. At one point, it looked like it had arms and legs as streamer stuff came out of it. And it just kept changing shape as it moved. I videotaped it for a few seconds before it disappeared. MARK, WHICH DATE ON YOUR WEBSITE IS THIS ONE? This one is under January 14, 2005, and it is one of several that were videotaped that night. PEOPLE CAN GO TO WWW.SONORASIGHTINGS.COM. THEY CAN FIND IN THE FAR LEFT THERE IS AN INDEX AND YOU CAN CLICK ON JANUARY 2005 AND FIND THIS VIDEO CLIP. Correct."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Color Changer Mark and brother faced west as object appeared at 11:02 p.m. over Lyons Bald Mountain, changed brightness and colors. Video image © 2005 by Mark Olson. AFTER THIS VIDEO, YOU SAID ABOUT 20 MINUTES LATER, AN OBJECT SHOWED UP CHANGING COLOR. CAN YOU DESCRIBE THAT IN MORE DETAIL? Yes, that object was seen over Lyon's Ball Mountain again. It was changing colors. It was huge ball of light that went from white to red, orange, yellow, green, blue it was just changing colors. As we watched this one we videotaped for quite awhile, for a few minutes at least and as we watched, I decided to find out what would happen if I flashed the flashlight at it. I picked up the flashlight and signaled it. The object then stopped, changed direction and took off really fast, in the opposite direction it was coming from. This was captured on two cameras. NO SIGNALING TO YOU, BUT IT DISAPPEARED BY FLYING AWAY? Right. It was more like it said, 'Oops, we've been seen. Let's get out of here!' It's the strangest thing I've ever seen. THERE WERE TWO OF YOU WHO WERE SEEING BOTH THE SHAPE CHANGER AND THE COLOR CHANGER OBJECTS? Correct. BOTH OF THOSE VIDEOS ARE REPRESENTED AT YOUR WEBSITE? Yes, there is a video clip of both of those objects. On the color-changing object, we videotaped it. We have four separate clips, two from one camera and two from the other showing first the color changing as it was changing colors flying over the mountain. Then the second two clips are when I signaled with the flashlight and the object's reaction to that. Reported Sightings to Authorities DID YOU TRY TO CONTACT ANY AIRPORT PEOPLE, MILITARY PEOPLE, POLICE, ANYBODY, AND SAY THIS IS WHAT IS HAPPENING ABOVE SONORA? DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT COULD BE? I have tried contacting our local media and the sheriff's department. I've contacted everybody I could think of, even our small aircraft airport which is in another town outside of Sonora in Columbia. I've not received any replies to my inquiries. YOU JUST DON'T GET A REPLY AT ALL? No reply whatsoever. One time when I called the airport, they said, 'Hold on,' and put me on hold and never came back (on the line.) AND YOUR WEBSITE HAS KEPT ACCUMULATING WITH WHAT SEEMS TO ME QUITE AN ASSORTMENT OF AT LEAST UNEXPLAINED VIDEOS. Yes, I call them 'unidentified aerial phenomena' because I have no idea what they are. I don't want to call them UFOs because that has a negative connotation of being spaceships and I don't know if they are terrestrial or extraterrestrial. Aerial Sightings Linked to Upcoming Global Event? WHEN YOU AND YOUR BROTHER TALK ABOUT ALL OF THIS ACCUMULATION OF ALL OF THESE UNEXPLAINED SIGHTINGS THAT HAVE SO MANY PATTERNS AND HAVE BEEN COMING PRETTY CONSISTENTLY SINCE YOU MOVED UP THERE, DO EITHER OF YOU EVER THINK: IS THIS RELATED IN ANY WAY TO"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"YOUR CHILDHOOD MEMORIES, THE TRIANGULAR SCARS AND THE STRANGE BRUISE ON HIS BACK? Yes, I'm constantly thinking about it and trying to remember if there is anything in my past that could connect these things. I can't think of anything. When I ask my brother about it, he says, 'I don't know.' But he has a tendency he does NOT want to know. He just knows something happened to him, but he told me one day, 'I'm glad I don't remember what happened. I don't think I could handle it.' WHEN YOU SEE THINGS YOU ARE VIDEOTAPING, DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU EXPECT ALL OF THIS TO LEAD UP TO SOMETHING? Yes, I do. I feel like something is going to happen. Something is on the edge of happening. That's what it feels like. It's felt like that for a year now. There is a really strange part of this. When these objects appeared at first, I would be sitting on my back porch reading, which I do a lot. One day I was sitting out there reading and enjoying a really good part of a really good book and I felt like somebody was trying to get my attention, like when someone is looking at you, that feeling in the back of your head. I put the book down and looked straight up. I didn't look around me. I didn't look over to the mountain. I just looked straight up and there were two silver discs hovering above my head. Every time we have a sighting, or most of the time, we get this feeling that something is going to happen. I've asked my brother about it and he gets the same feeling. We'll get really strange tingles feeling like something is going to happen, we better go outside. So we'll go outside and watch and sure enough, something will happen. IT'S ALMOST AS IF SOMETHING IS TEACHING YOU AND OTHERS IN THE ABDUCTION SYNDROME ABOUT PAYING ATTENTION TO CERTAIN FEELINGS THAT ARE LINKED IN SOME WAY TO VISIBLE SIGHTINGS OR PERHAPS EVEN TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION. THAT GOES TO THE NEXT QUESTION: WHAT COULD THAT BE LEADING UP TO THAT YOU FEEL WE'RE ON THE EDGE OF SOMETHING BIG HAPPENING? I've been feeling that something is going to happen and I also have a feeling it has to do with our planet, not just with our people.\" More Information: Mark Olson has learned that east of his apartment about 20 to 25 miles is a \"Marine Corps Training Camp\" marked by a simple sign. The camp's operation is supposed to only be in the winter when the area is completely blocked off. Website: http://www.sonorasightings.com Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
