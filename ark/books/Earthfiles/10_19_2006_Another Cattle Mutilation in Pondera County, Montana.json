Conrad is the county seat of Pondera. The most recent cow mutilation occurred in Valier, 25 miles northwest of Conrad. From the early 1970s to 2006, rashes of mutilations have repeated every few years. In 2001, the Pondera County Sheriff's Office investigated fourteen cases officially reported and knew about another half dozen cases not reported. October 17, 2006 Valier, Montana - Thirty years ago in 1975-1976, there were so many cattle mutilations in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico and other parts of the United States that sheriffs reported some mutilated carcasses were still warm to touch. All the cows, steers, bulls or heifers were usually missing an ear, eye, jaw flesh, tongue, genitals and rectal/vaginal area. Law enforcement often described the cuts as looking like they had been done with a \"cookie cutter,\" or \"surgical.\" Another common characteristic was lack of blood and no signs of struggle or tracks around the dead bodies - not even the animal's own tracks. That's what made so many sheriffs and deputies look to the sky and wonder what was lifting the mutilated animals and somehow returning them, or dropping them, back to their home pastures? One of the hot spots over the decades has been Great Falls, Montana, and surrounding counties such as Pondera Back in 2001 between June and December, the Pondera Sheriff's office investigated fourteen cattle mutilations. On top of those, there were possibly another half dozen talked about by a rancher west of Conrad who never officially reported them. Recently, on the morning of October 9, 2006, another classically mutilated cow was found on a ranch in Valier, about twenty-five miles northwest of Conrad. This 1300-pound healthy cow had been in a herd of approximately two hundred. On October 8, the cattle had been moved into the stubble field after barley was harvested. The owners saw that everything was OK at 5 p.m. that day before they locked the gate and went home. But the next morning, a neighbor first saw the cow dead about fifty feet off the county road. Eventually word reached the owners and the Pondera County Sheriff, Tom Kuka. He has worked in the Conrad Sheriff's Office for twenty-three years and is frustrated by all "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the unsolved animal mutilation cases. He and a deputy went to see the dead cow on the night of October 11. Sheriff Kuka has seen a lot of the stripped jaws, surgically stripped udders and cored out rectums. And that's what he was looking at on the cow. He decided to return the morning of October 12 with a Geiger counter and cameras. He talked to me this week about what they found in the daylight. 1200-pound black Angus cow found dead and mutilated on morning of October 9, 2006, in Valier, Pondera County, Montana. Alive and well with herd of 200 other cows in barley stubble field the night before as late at 5 p.m. Photograph © 2006 by Pondera County Sheriff's Office. Interviews: Tom Kuka, Sheriff, Pondera County, Conrad, Montana: “We started about a quarter mile away north of the animal and started photographing and using a Geiger counter. At that time, we would get readings anywhere from 8 to 12 at a quarter mile away. As we got closer, it bounced all the way up to 16 right directly east of the dead animal and then back down to 8. We never got any higher readings than that. It was like there was no radiation, or very little to speak of. We continued to move up on the animal, photographing it as we came all the way around. It was very typical to all the other mutilations we’ve had in this area. There was no sign of any struggle. There were no signs of any blood. L eft jaw bloodlessly stripped of flesh, as in the majority of animal mutilation cases since at least the 1960s. Image © 2006 by Pondera County Sheriff's Office."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Mystery of Bounce Mark and Barley Stubble Approximately four to five feet southeast of where this animal came to rest was a mark in the ground, which would appear that it hit and bounced and came to rest where it was at. This was opposite of what the stubble looked like underneath the cow. [ Editor's Note: Sheriff Kuka is waiting for his own 35mm prints to return from lab and I will update my Earthfiles report with photographs he thinks show the bounce.] This mutilated cow was lying in a harvested barley field. The stubble was approximately 3 to 4 inches tall. The animal looked like it hit and bounced to the north, but the stubble underneath it was bent south. And I still don’t know how – I tried to figure out how it could have been bent that way. I really haven’t got that through my mind yet how that happened. B ar ley stubbl e underneath black Angus cow is l ai d dow n goi ng south, while the bounce mark the Sheriff investigated four to five feet southeast of the cow's body indicated the animal was first moving in a northerly direction. IF IN FACT, THERE IS SOME KIND OF ENERGY INVOLVED WITH TRANSPORTING THESE ANIMALS, THE ENERGY ITSELF MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO THE STUBBLE BEFORE THE ANIMAL WAS LAID DOWN? Could have, but only where the animal was actually laying. You could also see where it was laying with its right side down on the ground. The left side was up and that was the side where the skin was removed on the face clear to the jawbone. The tongue was still intact. EARS AND EYES? The ears and eyes were still intact, yes. SO WHAT EL SE WAS TAKE N? The whole udder was gone. The hide had been removed cleanly in a size about like a"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"basketball. C ow's udder removed in smooth, clean cut. Sheriff Kuka said there was no blood on any of the excisions, but inside the abdomen, some blood had pooled (red above). WHAT ABOUT THE RECTAL AND VAGINAL AREA? Yes, that was done like it was all cored out at one time. But because of the time that had elapsed since the morning of Oct. 9 (when the neighbor first saw the dead animal and did not report it), the intestines were starting to come out. O n the morning of October 12, 2006, three days after the neighbor first saw the cow dead, intestines were sliding out large rectal and vaginal hole that probably looked like image below of a typical animal mutilation. C ow found Fourth of July week, 2002, by BLM workers under fence wire on ranch in Christmas Valley, Oregon. Rectal and vaginal area bloodlessly cored out and left front leg broken and shoved into the cow's body as if dropped straight down on the leg from the sky.

THERE WAS NO BLOOD ON ANY OF THE EXCISIONS?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"In the bag area – there was not blood on the excision, but inside we could see where blood had settled. WHAT WAS THE AGE OF THIS COW? This animal was 7-years-old. WAS SHE PREGNANT? She should have been, yes. WAS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT A FETAL CALF WAS INSIDE OF HER? No, we didn’t get in there to look. I would have had a vet here to do that. If she would have been bred, it would have been this last spring and it would have taken a vet to determine if she was. But she actually should have been and she looked like a good, well-nourished animal, so I’m sure she was most likely bred. WHEN YOU DO AN INVESTIGATION LIKE THIS, IS THERE ANY REASON WHY YOU DON’T GET A VETERINARIAN IN ALL THESE CASES TO DO A NECROPSY? Yes, the cost. We simply don’t have the money to do it. And most of the vets in this area would not want to do it anyway. They don’t seem to have time for such things (as animal mutilation investigations). BUT YOU AS SHERIFF IN CONRAD, HAVING DEALT WITH ANIMAL MUTILATIONS OVER THE YEARS, FEEL IT IS IMPORTANT TO INVESTIGATE, RIGHT? Ye s . CAN YOU TALK IN SOME DETAIL ABOUT WHAT THE MARK LOOKS LIKE IN THE STUBBLE GROUND? It’s like a piece of angle iron had set down there. It was very symmetrical, like something made from a right angle, or 90-degree angle. Y ellow graphic indicates straight depression in soil \"as if by a 90-degree angle\" approximately three feet long found about five feet from cow's dead body. It was like if you took an angle iron at a 90-degree angle, turned it, so the edge was down and you pushed that into the dirt – the mark it would leave. And the mark was approximately 36 inches, about 3 feet, long. MEANING, THE ANGLE ITSELF WAS MADE BY SOMETHING THAT WAS THREE FEET LONG? Correct. THAT’S BIG! It is. And it was pushed into the ground. That’s something else, too. Where this animal was laying, we rolled it over so we could see what was on the underside, plus we wanted to"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"draw fluid from the bottom eye because there was no fluid in the top eye. The ground – I don’t know if you have been on farm ground (growing) small grains – it leaves a furrow. That was all pushed down flat, but there wasn’t a big crater like where the animal would have fallen from a long distance. BUT YOU HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT SOMEHOW, HOWEVER THE ANIMAL WAS PUT DOWN ON THAT STUBBLE, THAT THE WEIGHT OF THE ANIMAL ITSELF HAD CAUSED BOTH A DEPRESSION OF THE STUBBLE AND FURROW AND THE STRANGENESS OF THE STUBBLE GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE ANIMAL’S BODY? Ye s . HOW FAR WAS THE 90-DEGREE ANGLE FROM THE DEAD AND MUTILATED COW’S BODY? Four to five feet. IN WHICH DIRECTION? South to southeast. And the stubble was bent to the south. It appeared to us that right on the other side of this angle iron depression that there was a spot where something hit the ground. The mutilated cow looked like she fell from the sky, hit the ground and bounced to the north, but the stubble underneath her body was bent south. She was headed north, which means her body should have pushed the stubble to the north. The dirt was piled up against her stomach, which was facing north. That means the cow would have slid to the north. However, when we rolled it up and over, the stubble was pointing south . The dirt, the way it was piled up against the right rear foot was three-quarters covered with dirt when it came to rest there. WHICH AGAIN UNDERSCORES THAT THIS ANIMAL WAS DROPPED FROM ABOVE. Yes, but strangely the dirt was pushed to the south and the stubble was bent south, even though it looked like the cow was dropped going north. The stubble was pointing south just the opposite of what it should have been. REALLY PUZZLING. Yes, I know. There are so many things about this stuff that I can’t rationalize in my head. I guess that’s what is so frustrating to me. U. S. Army Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso Worldwide Animal Mutilations Perpetrated by Extraterrestrials \". ..At the White House we were reading about the mutilation stories that had been kept out of press as far back as the middle 1950s... Our intelligence organizations believed that the cattle mutilations - that could not be obviously explained away as pranks, predators, or ritual slaughter - were the results of interventions by extraterrestrials who were harvesting specific organs, or for experimentation.\" - P age 182, The Day After Roswell © 1997 by Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso (deceased) RIGHT, AND NOBODY HAS COME UP WITH ANSWERS BEYOND LT. COL. PHILIP J. CORSO SAYING THAT OUR GOVERNMENT KNEW FROM THE EARLY 1950S THAT DOCUMENTS HE READ SAID EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES WERE KILLING AND MUTILATING ANIMALS AROUND THE WORLD. AND HE WENT ON THE RECORD IN A BOOK AND ON TELEVISION. THAT IS THE STRONGEST INSIDER STATEMENT ABOUT THIS PHENOMENON THAT HAS BEEN ON THE RECORD. Well, it’s got to be something like that. I can’t – there isn’t anything else out here. This stubble I’m talking about – it’s very brittle. If there was a truck big enough to haul this animal around, or a pickup, it’s going to leave tracks. It’s going to sink into the ground and leave tracks. There is nothing out there. THIS IS VERY INTERESTING. ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, WHAT YOU ARE"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"DESCRIBING IS WHAT OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS DESCRIBED FOR THE PAST 50 TO 60 YEARS. THAT IS THAT THE IMPLICATION OF THIS EVIDENCE WAS THAT THIS ANIMAL WAS DROPPED FROM ABOVE ONTO THE GROUND. Yes. There are no other marks out here. This field – nobody has been out in this field. The farmer/rancher family came out there in late August to early September and harvested the barley. They left and had not been back in there. Nobody else would have been back in there. Then, they brought those cattle in and the very next morning, this cow is dead and mutilated. At that time (morning of Oct. 9), nobody could tell it was mutilated. Otherwise, those neighbors would have called. When we get there, it’s still - we’ve had cool enough temperatures here that it’s not bloated as bad as it would have been early in the summer. As far as flies or anything else, there was hardly anything there. IN MANY CASES, THE ABSENCE OF FLIES HAS BEEN ONE OF THE STRANGE ANOMALIES. Five years ago, there was another mutilation within two miles of this one. At that time, these people reported that their dogs went over to look at that (mutilation) and then ran back to the pickup and jumped in (as if afraid) and didn’t want to have anything to do with it. Today, this same dog came to this one (mutilated cow) and it came up there and sniffed around and was willing to stay with this animal. Several Neighbors, But No One Saw Or Heard Anything THOSE KINDS OF WHAT SEEM TO BE DIFFERENCES AND CONTRADICTIONS ARE THROUGHOUT THE ANIMAL MUTILATION REPORTS. IT’S HARD TO KNOW WHY, BUT IT RAISES THE QUESTION: HOW MANY NEIGHBORS LIVE AROUND THAT PARTICULAR STUBBLE FIELD AND HOW CLOSE? Just directly half a mile north of this location of the dead animal is an occupied residence. A half a mile east is another occupied residence. As the crow flies about three-quarters of a mile is another occupied residence that is kind of northwest of the dead cow. And almost straight west, a little bit northwest, is part of the family members that owns the cows. They are all less than a mile away. SO THOSE ARE AT LEAST FOUR RESIDENCES WITHIN A MILE. DID ANYONE SEE OR HEAR ANYTHING UNUSUAL? Nope, not a thing. THAT IN ITSELF IS BIZARRE IF THIS ANIMAL WAS DROPPED FROM THE SKY. I would say with that Air Force base, T. O., there are a lot of helicopters around there. So, it would not have been out of the ordinary, but not a lot of them fly around at night. Coyotes Stayed Away from Mutilated Cow Another thing, coyotes. There are an awful lot of coyotes in that area and dogs bark at night a lot and bark while the coyotes are howling. That’s not uncommon for dogs to bark. So, unless they saw lights or saw someone driving by or someone came to the door, they probably would not think much of sounds like helicopters or dogs barking. IN SPEAKING OF THE PREDATORS, THE NATURAL PREDATORS LIKE COYOTES AND WOLVES, DOES IT STRIKE YOU STRANGE THAT ON OCTOBER 12, AS SPEAK, WHEN THIS ANIMAL WAS FOUND ON OCTOBER 9, THAT IT IS STILL THERE COMPLETELY INTACT AND APPARENTLY HAS NOT BEEN TORN APART BY PREDATORS? It does. And the fact that also last night when the first responding deputy arrived at the scene, there was a coyote within 50 yards of this animal and the coyote still did not go after the dead cow this morning. The coyote was a quarter mile from it this morning. SO, THE COYOTE WAS BASICALLY STAYING AWAY FROM THIS DEAD MUTILATED COW’S BODY? Ye s ."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"WELL, I’VE SURE SEEN THAT BEFORE. I’VE SEEN IT WITH MY OWN EYES OVER IN THE MORA AND LAS VEGAS, NEW MEXICO AREA, WHERE I WALKED WITH A RANCHER RIGHT UP TO A MUTILATED ANIMAL AND WE COULD SEE THE COYOTE PACING AS IF THERE WAS AN INVISIBLE WALL ABOUT 12 TO 15 FEET FROM THE BODY OF THAT MUTILATED COW. THE ENTIRE TIME WE WALKED, THAT COYOTE WAS PACING AND NEVER APPROACHED THAT BODY. This cow did have some bird droppings on her, but very few. We never saw any birds. There were none there on Oct. 12, that morning when we arrived. WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE BODY OF THE COW? We turned it back over to the rancher, John Peterson, and he wants to leave it there for a while because he's curious to find out if any predators come around it.\" R anch owner, John Peterson, examining his dead and mutilated black Angus cow. As of October 19, 2006, ten days after animal first found, the cow had not been touched by coyotes or other natural predators. Ranch Owner Puzzled by Coyotes J ohn Peterson and three other generations of his family have ranched the Valier, Montana, property over the past one hundred years. John was born and raised there 47 years ago. Even though some of his neighbors have had cattle mutilations in the past, he’s never had one before. The bloodless preciseness of the cuts shocked him. He was also curious to see coyotes in the field that wouldn’t go near the dead cow. So, he decided to leave her where she was found. Ten days later when I talked to him on October 19th, no predator had yet taken a bite. John Peterson, Family Ranch Owner, Valier, Pondera County, Montana: \"This is the first mutilation that has ever occurred on this place. My brother and nephew and niece and I run the cows here. They are my brother’s kids. This is the first one any of us Petersons have ever lost to a mutilation. SHERIFF KUKA SAID YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE THE ANIMAL TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. COULD YOU GIVE ME AN UPDATE AS TO WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH PREDATORS THERE SINCE YOU FIRST SAW IT ON OCTOBER 11? I just drove by there this morning out of curiosity and nothing has eaten on it yet (Oct. 9 to Oct. 19, ten days). But there was a raven sitting on the cow. But I don’t believe she was eating nothing there. The other cows have finally moved in. It took them quite awhile. I’m not sure if you are familiar with how other cows are around dead cows – how they just kind of go nuts and tear the ground up. These cows have finally started doing that with this dead one. IN OTHER WORDS, THE HERD WAS SO SPOOKED FROM SOMEWHERE AROUND OCT. 9 OR 10 ON THAT THEY WOULD NOT EVEN APPROACH THAT MUTILATED COW? No. I’d be watching from a distance, and the other cows would just graze around her. Then"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"I’d say around Sunday or Monday (Oct. 15 to 16), the cows finally started going around her and bawling. And now they are really getting the ground tore up fighting around her now. BUT SO FAR IN WHAT IS NOW TEN DAYS SINCE YOUR NEIGHBOR SAW THE COW LAYING DEAD FOR THE FIRST TIME ON OCTOBER 9, THERE HAVE BEEN NO COYOTES, WOLVES OR ANYTHING? No. My nephew even seen a coyote out there one night. The coyote did not disturb her. I also had a coyote come up to my place. I didn’t disturb the coyote because I was curious. It was headed in the general direction (of the mutilated cow), but nothing has stopped to eat on her. HOW UNUSUAL IS THAT IN YOUR AREA FOR A COYOTE OR WOLF NOT TO HAVE PHYSICALLY DECIMATED A DEAD COW BY NOW? Well, we hauled in a load of cows to this one neighbor, and he lost one right away to bloat. It died. My nephew – I have another nephew who lives right beside that place – he said in about a week’s time, that cow was picked pretty much down to the bones. THIS ANIMAL OF YOURS HAS BEEN THERE FOR A FULL TEN DAYS UNTOUCHE D. Yes. And the coyotes are very thick around here. It’s nothing to hear fifteen or twenty coyotes yipping and howling around the house at night. WHICH MEANS THAT SOMETHING HAS CONTAMINATED, OR IS STILL AROUND THE BODY, OF THE MUTILATED COW THAT MAKES THE COYOTES AND OTHER PREDATORS NERVOUS? Yeah. There’s something there that they just don’t like. I don’t know why the birds are landing there. Maybe they can’t smell like the coyotes and foxes can. But those coyotes sure don’t bother that dead cow - and that's weird.\" Nearby \"T. O.\" Missile Site The black Angus cow still lays in the barley stubble field dead and mutilated with marks around her that suggest she was dropped from the sky and bounced. What aerial object carried that cow and dropped her? Only one mile from the dead cow is the \"T. O.\" missile site, one of many underground missile bunkers that have been, or still are, in Pondera and Great Falls Counties in Montana. \"T. O.\" stands for Tango-Zero Launch Control Facility. Tango was the Squadron Command Post (SCP) in the 564th SMS south of Valier, Montana, about 100 miles north of Malmstrom AFB at Great Falls, Montana. [For more information about animal mutilations around Montana Minuteman missile silos, please see my book, An Alien Harvest, in the Earthfiles Shop and the reprinted Mystery Stalks the Prairie in the Earthfiles Archives .] I asked John Peterson what he feels now about the whole animal mutilation mystery? John Peterson: \"Boy, it's mixed emotions between government and aliens! I hate to be the guy who says there are Martians out there, but also I look at the government's T. O. missile base right there and they say nothing . Well, they've got to be involved, even if it is aliens. The government has to be involved somehow to not say something - even if they can't detect it. They've still got to have some kind of interest in it. IF THE GOVERNMENT IS COVERING MUTILATIONS UP, THEY WON'T SAY ANYTHING. Yeah, and if they are covering it up, then they are involved. IN THE COVER-UP, THAT'S RIGHT, BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT'S HAPPENING AND THEY HAVE A POLICY OF DENIAL. Yeah, any time you deny something, that makes you involved, in my opinion.\" I f that cow had been dropped from a UFO beam technology to the ground, did that \"T. O.\" missile crew see anything on radar? If not, what is the nature of the E. T. cloaking device? Either way, perhaps the raising up and lowering down of animal life all over this planet by extraterrestrial biological entities is such old knowledge to our government – a national"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"security concern the United States can’t control or stop.
