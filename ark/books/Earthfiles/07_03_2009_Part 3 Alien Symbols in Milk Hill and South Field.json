R eturn to Part 1 July 3, 2009 Wiltshire County, England - The following PDF was emailed to me on July 1, from a man named Mark in Colorado, who worked in computer signal processing for thirteen years. Mark has studied crop formation patterns with curiosity since 1993. About the 2009 patterns, he says, “I'm starting to see how they fit together over time and space in the past and present. So, in the future I think we'll all see more and more links between the patterns and maybe we'll begin to have more understanding about what is being communicated. And I think the crop circle intelligence will be r eacting to our own human consciousnesses as we try to see past and present links in the crop formations.” "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" R eturn to Part 1 F or further information about worldwide crop formations, please see Earthfiles Archived reports (partial list below) and my book, Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles, in the Earthfiles Shop. • 04/30/2009 — Part 1: First 2009 U.
