February 26, 2003 Corguinho, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil - The transport process was reversed, according to Urandir Oliveira, when the tall, blond beings "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"decided to return him on the evening of September 18, 2002, after three days on a second floor room where a large wall screen showed Urandir and many other non-human beings images of Earth's alleged future. During our February 10, 2003, interview about the experience, I asked Urandir if he and the others were in the same room all three days. He an swered, \"Yes, it's like the walls were endless. I walked, but never reached the walls, so it gave the impression that the room was really big. I explained to him that other people have described \"infinite\" interiors in non-human craft and have been given information that time and space are some how distorted within the craft. But Urandir did not have such knowledge. What he says he did understand was that the meeting in the \"endless\" room with many other non-human beings was supposed to have lasted for fifteen Earth days, not only three. But many of th e people who had been at the Corghinho farm on the night of September 15 2002, when the scorched body prints were found on Urandir's bed and the bedroom ceiling told friends, relatives and the Brazilian media about what had happened. By September 16, 2002, Brazilian television reporters had traveled to Urandir's farm house to wait for a craft to return him. Felipe Branco and others who had been shocked the previous night by the bedroom scene had already locked the bedroom and shuttered the windows so no one could enter, including the curious media. When no dramatic aerial or beam activity was seen on September 16 or 17, the media left the farm. Urandir said, \"In the end, the blond being told me that the trip was going to be interrupted, cut short, because of all the movement down there with the media which was not in accordance with what had been committed to me\" by the beings. He understood that the non-humans did not want sensation, but left the physical evidence in the bedroom that unusual energy had interacted there for researchers to analyze. On the evening of September 18, 2002, when the farm was relatively quiet, the tall blond being walked Urandir down the stairs in the craft to the pl ace he had entered in the violet light. There he we nt back into the bubble where the silver, glowing, leotard-like suit dematerialized from his body and his own underpants materialized on him again. Urandir Oliveira, Farmer, Ecovila Fezenda, Corguinho, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Portuguese translation by Luciano Didier, Brazilian Fiesta Tours, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and Felipe Branco, Fazenda Castelo, Campo Grande, MS: \"The violet light was already there and a lot denser. DENSER THAN HE REMEMBERED COMING UP (ON SEPTEMBER 15)? When the violet transforms into a tube that comes down, the light becomes more subtle. DOES URANDIR WALK INTO THE BEAM OR DOES IT COME DOWN AROUND HIM? At this point, he walks into the light. As he is going back down in the beam,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"about half way down, this light changes him from a standing position and puts him in the previous exact position when he was on the bed before (on September 15, 2002). The very same position and he is paralyzed again to go all the way through the roof and ceiling of his house and back to where he was.\" I later asked Urandir to check the roof and see if the same body print was on the tiles. He could not find any evidence there, but a more thorough examination is going to be made beneath the roof tiles and the upper side of the wood beneath the tiles by a scientist in March who is also investigating the Corghinho phenomena. ANY DIFFERENT FEELING THEN? Like as if his bones are stretching. FELIPE: Like cracking joints. AS IF THE BONE JOINTS SEEM TO SNAP IN SOME WAY? The whole skeleton of all his bones go snap, snap. I WONDER IF IT HAS TO DO WITH MOLECULAR EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION OF PASSING HIS MATTER BODY THROUGH THE ROOF AND ONTO THE BED? Yes, it does have something to do with expanded molecular structure so he can interact with matter again. It's as if they are re-tuning the body. AT THIS POINT, IS HE LOOKING THROUGH THE COLORED LIGHT AND CAN HE SEE THE ROOM LIKE HE DID BEFORE? Yes, exactly. He can see through the same light to the room. WHEN DOES HE KNOW HE IS BACK ON THE BED? He saw himself going through the ceiling and then he feels his body touch the bed. But before he actually approached the bed, he could not see that the bed was burned because the way in which he was paralyzed would not allow him to. So the (violet) light goes off and everything comes back to normal and he stands up, switched on the room light, and then he is surprised with his bed because it is so burnt. He thought he had been melted there! WHAT ABOUT THE CEILING? There was some sort of smoke in the ceiling still coming out."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Photos above and below taken on February 9, 2003: Urandir Oliveira's body imprint on the blue and white cotton sheet, pillow and w ood ce iling. Photographs © 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe. White arrow points at the impression of an aura surrounding Urandir's head scorch in the wood ce iling. I was puzzled when I realized three fact s as I photographed and gathered cloth and wood samples from the sheet and the ceiling. First, if a body leaves the bed on September 15, 2002 and goes through the ceiling, that would seem to me to be the body exit marks. So, where were the body return marks on September 18? Urandir said he understood that the paralysis of his body in the laying down position both leaving the bed and returning were calculated precisely by the non-human blonds to be the same. Thus, no second set of marks. The molecular precision he says is related to the passage of his body matter through other matter such as the wood ceiling. Are the beings capturing time and playing it back, so to speak, to return him so precisely? Urandir says he knows the beings do use and manipulate timelines,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"but he is uncertain if such use of time was involved in his particular September 15, 2002, transport in and out of his bedroom. Second, I asked Urandir to lay down along the right edge of the bed so I could compare his body length and proportion to the body print on the sheet. As he laid down, I videotaped the comparison. I then realized that the scorch marks on the pillow and the heavy scorch mark surrounded by the aura of his head in the wood ceiling were in different pl aces. The head mark in the ceiling and the rest of the torso and legs are further forward and more to the right of the pillow mark. A logical speculation about this difference is that Urandir's body was moving forward toward the head of the be d as it was lifted upward by the violet beam technology. Third, neither the right hand nor the feet made any imprints on the sheet or in the ceiling. The right hand was holding a book off the edge of the bed and both Urandir's feet hung out over the end of the bed, he told me. I asked him why he thought there were no scorch marks of hi s hand or feet in the ceiling. He was uncertain, but said he understood from the non-humans that the energy beam that lifted his body was precisely tuned to the molecules of his body against the bed in order to separate them from the bed. Scorch marks where head was on pillow, right arm was extended, and torso laid on bed."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Torso, testicles and lower legs down to ankles. Feet were off the bed. Close-up of scorch marks where Urandir's head was on pillow. Close-up of scorched waist, lower back and testicles. The close-up above shows the subtle range of the energy that interacted"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"with the cotton fibers, scorching through sections down into the mattress, while leaving fibers in between partially intact. The close-up below shows the variations in the affected cotton sheet where Urandir Oliveira's right leg experienced more scorching than the left leg,, as did the right side of the body in general. SO MUCH SCORCHING AND YET HI S SKIN NOT BEING BURNED, THAT IS AMAZING. 'Extraordinary technology,' he says. WHAT WENT THROUGH HI S MIND AS HE LOOKED AT THE SHEET AND THE CEILING? At the time, he started touching himself thinking, 'Have I melted?' And he wanted to know his weight, so he clim bed on a scale and he lost 4 kilos (8.8 pounds) in those three days. DID THE BEINGS FEED HIM ANYTHING? Some tablets with different flavors. DID THEY TASTE GOOD TO HIM? If he wanted a meat flavor, they would give a meat flavor. If he wanted a sweet or apple flavor, he would have an apple flavor. DID THEY GIVE HIM LIQUID? Water that was much lighter than our own water. HE FELT PERFECTLY FINE? Relaxed, peaceful, joyful. SO HE IS NOW STANDING IN THE BEDROOM. THE CEILING IS SMOKING. HE IS LOOKING AT HI S OWN BODY TO SEE IF HE IS BURNED. Then he tries to open the door of the room and it's locked. He opened the window and it is blocked from the outside. It is blocked with bars. Everyone locked the room after he was gone (on September 15) after the abduction to make sure no one would walk into the room."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"THE BODY PRINTS HAD BEEN THERE FOR THREE DAYS. Yes, and he did not know. AND NO ONE KNEW WHEN HE WAS COMING BACK? Exactly. HE IS LOCKED IN HIS OWN BEDROOM. Ye s . HOW DID HE GET OUT? He has an intercom phone, so he called his parents who live on the farm and they rushed to the room to open it. HE WAS GONE FOR AT LEAST THRE E DAYS AND HUMANS GO TO THE BATHROOM ON A DAILY BASIS. WH AT DID THEY PROVIDE IN THAT CRAFT? There was some sort of a cabin, almost transparent, a plasma material. And the only need or urge he had was to urinat e. He did not feel any other urge. When he arrived at the plasma material, there was no hole, no basin, nothing. So, he thought, 'Well, I will just urinate here.' WHAT HAPPENED? So he starts urinating and when it is about 10 centimeters for the urine to touch the ground, it would disappear. HE SAID HE IS STANDING BEFORE A PLASMA. IS IT LIKE FOG? Same material as the bubble. SO HE WOULD STEP INTO IT, BEGIN URINATING AND IT JUST DISAPPEARS? Before it touches the floor. DO THE BLOND BEINGS URINATE? Yes, not as much as we do, but they do. AND EAT? The same tablets that they provided him.\""},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Sampling process on February 9, 2003, where I measured and removed sections from the body print along with normal controls from the sheet, pillow and ceiling.
