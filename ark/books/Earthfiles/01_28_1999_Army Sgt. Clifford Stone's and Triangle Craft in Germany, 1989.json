Clifford Stone an d Triangle Craft in Germany, 1989 Â© 1999 by Linda Moulton Howe January 28, 1999 - Marine Deaths 1) Mysterious marine deaths are in the news again. On Wednesday, January 27th, eleven bottle-nosed dolphins were found dead off southern Thailand and no one knows why. The dolphins were all young males about 5 1/2 feet long. A spokesman at the Phuket Marine Biotech Center said: \"It is rare and strange to find dolphins this young and strong dying in such large numbers.\" The Center has received six of the dead dolphins to determine the cause of death. The Thai Gulf is home to several hundred bottle-nosed dolphins, so it's important to find out what's killing them. Antarctic Bedrock Reached 2) Also making headlines this week were scientists who finally hit bedrock about two-thirds of a mile beneath the Antarctic in what's known as Siple Dome, an immense bulge of ice 500 miles north of the South Pole. It took three years of drilling. The project is sponsored by the National Science Foundation in Washington, D. C. The goal is to find out if there was any time in earth's past when the Antarctic ice cap was completely gone. Next year, the research team hopes to dig up several feet of underlying bedrock to see if it was ever exposed to sunlight or cosmic rays. So far, other evidence suggests much of the Antarctic ice cap did vanish about 125,000 years ago. If that's true, what happened back then? With global warming upon us and sea levels rising, could it happen again in our future? Triangular Craft Over Germany, 1989 3) Each month I receive several reports from people in the U. S. and other countries who describe seeing unusual objects in the sky they can't identify. For those close enough to see a shape, the description is usually round, oval or cylindrical -- or sometimes diamond, ice-cream cone or boomerang. Then there is another class of aerial vehicles that are very large and silent. Those are the triangles. For example, between November 1989 and March 1990, civilian and military officials in Belgium received over 2500 reports of large, silent triangles. And we're all familiar with the March 13, 1997 appearance of an unidentified, large, silent triangle over Phoenix, estimated by some witnesses to be nearly a mile or two long. Even further back in time, there is the April 1954 U. S. War Department's Majestic-12 SOM 1-01 Training Manual that is reprinted in my book \"Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness.\" In it, there is a section labeled \"Extraterrestrial Technology, Description of Craft.\" It states: \"Airfoil or triangular shape. This craft is believed to be new technology due to the rarity and (sic) recency of the observations. Radar indicates an isoceles "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"triangle profile, the longest side being nearly 300 feet in length. Little is known about the performance of these craft due to the rarity of good sightings, but they are believed capable of high speeds and abrupt maneuvers similar to, or exceeding, the performance attributed to disc and ovoid shapes.\" That was a 1954 description by our own government. Tonight, I want to report an extraordinary triangle craft encounter that took place on the Cold War border of East and West Germany near Fulda in the summer of 1989. Fulda is northeast of Frankfurt. The eyewitness is retired Army Sgt. Clifford E. Stone, author of UFOS ARE REAL. Sgt. Stone served for more than 20 years as an Army nuclear/biological and chemical retrieval specialist. He feels strongly that the U. S. government should go on the record publicly about its knowledge of extraterrestrial craft and entities. That is why he is writing and speaking out. This story begins on a late summer afternoon in 1989 about four months AFTER the Belgian flyovers of triangle-shaped craft had made international news. Sgt. Stone is standing in a check point tower with other security people and can clearly see guards in the East German tower across the border. An alert comes in that a new Soviet aircraft is coming toward them, low to the ground. Sgt. Stone told me what happened during a recent visit to his Roswell, New Mexico home. Here, with his permission, is an excerpt from that interview. Interview: Clifford Stone, U. S. Army Sergeant, Retired, Roswell, New Mexico: \"This is what the person reporting -- he has no knowledge -- he is making an assumption here. He's assuming it's Soviet because it's coming in from the Soviet side. And it actually comes over and very carefully glides this way. Well, since we were already involved and could see it was somewhat triangular shaped from a distance and it came in very slowly and turned ?you have a vehicle that is triangular in shape that is probably 4 or 5 stories high, three windows of what appears to be lighted windows or ports or something. Three football fields across on either side. This is no craft that was developed on this earth. SO IT'S A THOUSAND FEET EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE? Equilateral. This is huge. YOU ARE IN THE TOWER OUTSIDE? Outside. I still have the field glasses I looked at it through. BUT ARE YOU BEHIND WINDOWS? No, the tower we're in is open. It took on definite, definite dimension to where you could tell this wasn't any type of conventional airframe of the Soviets or any other country on the face of this earth. When you saw how huge it was, you're immediate impact was a fleeting moment of fear. But then your fear turns to awe because you are seeing something that defies the imagination. You are seeing something that you want the grand tour, you want to go inside and see what this is all about. WHAT COLOR ARE YOU SEEING? We are seeing underneath one big, massive light right at the center, circular. And it's red. Then along slightly inside underneath the craft, you have several rows -- I didn't count them, I can't recollect exactly how many -- but you have several rows of flashing lights, multi-colored lights. Every color of the rainbow. ARE THEY GOING LIKE THIS? Around like that -- then all of a sudden -- and they go at faster speeds. SO THE TRIANGLE ITSELF IS BORDERED OR EDGED IN THESE FLASHING DIFFERENT COLORED LIGHTS. With these flashing different colored lights."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"AND THERE IS A GREAT BIG RED LIGHT IN THE MIDDLE? Right in the middle. At the corner of the triangles inside where the colored lights are, you have like a orange or amber light at each end. And sometimes they would flash white. There was a high background radiation strong enough to kill the people who were within -- half the people involved should have been dead in 24 hours because of the background radiation. Yet, there were no ill effects. There were some people who got sick, but that was more along the lines of fear causing these people to get sick. AND WERE THESE ALL MILITARY WHO GOT SICK? Oh, yes! As far as the civilians go the location where we were at -- if any civilians saw it none came out to report it. On the Soviet side, I have no knowledge. Or rather I should say, on the German side, I have no knowledge what happened there. BUT YOU HAD MILITARY PEOPLE GOING TO A HOSPITAL SICK? We had military people who came down nauseous. The Aide Personnel took care of them right out there. STARTED VOMITING? They got sick and they vomited. RIGHT THERE? Right there. WAS THE CRAFT IN THE SKY ABOVE THEM WHEN THEY STARTED VOMITING? Not directly over us because you have an area that is a Soviet territory that's between us and them if no one is there. It was a No Man's Zone. SO THE TRIANGLE IS OVER THE NO MAN'S ZONE? Well, it was over the Soviet territory. It didn't come into our territory. We scrambled -- we had fighter aircraft scrambled from Ramstein AFB to do an Intercept Identify Friend or Foe (IIFF). And they were doing this, but we could not go into Soviet territory. Now, I wasn't involved with this, but we were monitoring radio traffic from the Soviet side and I know they were very alarmed at what they were seeing. They also scrambled some Foxbats to do an intercept and those Foxbats were in fact armed. And there was discussion as to them engaging this craft. DID THEY HAVE PEOPLE VOMITING ON THE RUSSIAN SIDE, TOO? I don't know. ONLY OUR SIDE? On our side, I was there. On the Soviet side, we could tell that they were panicking just like us. WERE THE MEN WHO WERE VOMITING -- WITHIN WHAT DISTANCE OF THIS? I would say the closest approach was maybe 200 meters. IS THAT VERTICAL 600 F EET IN THE AIR OR? It's at an angle. AND HOW HIGH DO YOU THINK IT WAS? Oh, I would say it was probably 400 or 500 feet high. It was low. If it had been higher, it would have been awesome but you wouldn't have a feeling that it was going to land. YOU HAD THE FEELING IT WAS GOING TO LAND. We had the feeling that we were about to be confronted. And your hair was standing up on its end. ELECTROSTATIC?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Yeah. We felt like -- we felt there was something more to this than just being our fears. And anyone who said they weren't afraid isn't telling the truth. I can understand a person trying to deny being there and seeing anything more than I could understand a person saying he saw it and wasn't afraid. SO THIS IS ABOUT 400 OR 500 F EET UP AND ABOUT AN ANGLE OF 600 F EET AND MEN, YOU YOURSELF INCLUDED IN THE TOWER, ARE ABOUT 600 FEET AWAY FROM IT? I would say that we were roughly 600 feet from it. DID YOU FEEL NAUSEOUS? I didn't get sick. I didn't feel nauseous. I took an Alka Seltzer after that, but I always had problems and the Alka Seltzer made me feel better. TEMPERATURE. WARM? COLD? You felt cold. But here again, I think it was more a psychological effect than physical. COULD YOU FEEL ANY VIBRATIONS OF ANYTHING? Actually, no. Actually, it was very quiet. And I looked at the guys on my right and the guys on my left and one guy went ahead and on the back of the APCs, the M113s, we had anti-tank missiles and one guy was getting ready to fire one of these at the object. And I went ahead and told him, 'Hold on, son. Don't do anything. Don't fire anything. You're not in any danger here. If you do something like that, we may be.' WHAT HAPPENED -- DID HE BACK OFF? Yeah, he went ahead and regained his composure. But all of us were scared. No one ran. We didn't. The Soviets didn't. We held our ground. But we were afraid. You really had this fear. And YOU HAD YOUR WEAPONS DRAWN? Oh, we had our weapons. You could even hear them changing rounds. The Lt. Col. There went ahead and told everyone to check there fire. 'Nobody fire!' AND NOW IT'S UP THERE. EVERYTHING IS SILENT. YOU'RE IN THE TOWER. THEY'RE IN THE TOWER. MEN ARE GETTING SICK. WHAT HAPPENS? It hangs over there. And this is a unique thing. Our radios didn't go dead. There was a lot of static, but they did not go dead. We could alternate channels on our radios. And we had I think we had 4 or 5 different ones we were using. As long as we alternated between those 4 or 5, we could go ahead and communicate. We went ahead and requested air support from Ramstein AFB and they scrambled some fighters to be on the ready to intercept if it crosses over into our territory. Because at this stage of the game, it could go any place. And they were going to try to make an identification. And I personally thought there wasn't going to be any identification made. But they went to try to do -- they scrambled the fighters to get them on station where if it crossed over, we could immediately lock on them and make a determination as to whether their intentions were friendly or hostile, but we could also get some gun camera footage. Some of the aircraft came very close to the Fulda Gap -- and sometimes crossing over into it taking some film footage of the craft. AND IT STAYED STOCK STILL WHILE THE AIRPLANES DID THAT? It stayed stock still. But after that happened, it started to move. It dipped like this -- this is the front. Here we are -- the triangle is pointing this way and when it got over, it turned very slowly and stopped. Then when the fighters got on station they took photos. Then it turned this way and went off like this. At which time, the Soviet Foxbats hit up on it and gave pursuit and that was the end of the situation. Everyone was debriefed about what they saw. They had to do drawings. Everyone was told that there is a new Soviet Fighter. That the Soviets were testing a -- MIG 37 -- and it was their answer -- I take that back -- it was a"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"version of a MIG 37 that was a Soviet fighter that they converted into a Soviet bomber and actually it wasn't as big as we were seeing it.\" More Information: Telling Sgt. Stone and his Army colleagues that the triangle was a Russian Mig and not as big as they saw it with their own eyes is consistent with the official policy of denial outlined in the 1954 SOM1-01 Training Manual. It says in Section I. Security, Paragraph 12. Press Blackout: \"Discredit Witnesses. If at all possible, witnesses will be held incommunicado until the extent of their knowledge and involvement can be determined. Witnesses will be discouraged from talking about what they have seen, and intimidation may be necessary to ensure their cooperation. If witnesses have already contacted the press, it will be necessary to discredit their stories. This can best be done by the assertion that they have either misinterpreted natural events, are the victims of hysteria or hallucinations, or are the perpetrators of hoaxes. \"Deceptive Statements. It may be come necessary to issue false statements to preserve the security of the site. Meteors, downed satellites, weather balloons and military aircraft are all acceptable alternatives.\" Sgt. Stone's experience raises several questions: What was the strong radiation detected by the Geiger counter that should have been lethal, but wasn't? Which U. S. government agency has the gun camera film of the enormous triangle- shaped craft while it hovered over the U. S. and East German guard towers that summer of 1989? Was this the same type of craft that flew over Phoenix, Arizona on March 13, 1997? Who is in these triangles? And why are they flying in earth's skies? Sgt. Stone remembers at least three destinations for highly classified reports about the triangle craft: Bolling AFB near Washington, D. C.; Ft. Belvoir, Virginia; and the National Security Agency.
