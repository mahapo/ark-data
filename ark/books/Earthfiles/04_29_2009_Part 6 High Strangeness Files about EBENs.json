B. Darrach, Jr., and Robert Ginna, LIFE Magazine, April 7, 1952 R eturn to Part 1 April 29, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Continuing in Part 6 with Linda Moulton Howe's 1983 to 1987 High Strangeness file notes about EBENs and other non-human entities. More miscellaneous notes about the Cimarron, New Mexico, abduction case of the mother and son who stopped car near pasture where two humanoids had a cow down in a pasture. [ See 040809 Earthfiles and An Alien Harvest in Earthfiles Shop has full Cimarron case hypnosis transcript. ] An Albuquerque man (medical doctor?) named Fitzpatrick did the first hypnosis session with the Cimarron, New Mexico, mother and her 6-year-old son because she had a vaginal infection that was overwhelming any treatment he gave her. The mother named Myrna told the doctor about the Cimarron encounter and her conviction that she was contaminated by the non-humans who had invaded her body with some kind of instruments that had really hurt her. She told the doctor that she and her young son were driving in pastureland outside Cimarron in the first week of May 1980, when she heard a cow “scream” loudly. She stopped the car and got out. Then she and her son could see “strange humanoid creatures” around the cow in the pasture that sounded scared and in pain. Next thing Myrna and her son knew, they were in some kind of shaft going underground into a base where she saw cow parts in tubes of liquid and tall and small non-humans working together - among our military? People dressed in military uniforms? Fitzpatrick said that Myrna had multiple implants in her from the non-humans. Fitzpatrick told Howard Burgess (engineer at Sandia Laboratories in Albuquerque who has researched animal mutilations) that he took needles out of Cimarron woman and “metal stuff” was found in her vaginal area. Paul Bennewitz decided to help Myrna move away from New Mexico to California to help protect her and her son from further alien abductions. Paul Bennewitz says the non-humans use blood to feed genetically created humanoids - controlled androids for pl acement among Earth humans? Have had a discussion with a source about whether the non-humans can literally “see through human eyes and minds”? It was suggested that the non-humans have the ability to project themselves into humans to see what it looks like to drive a car, fly a plane or other Earth human activities. But how does the projection work? And what is the connection to genetic manipulation to create human-looking androids to do work for non-humans on this planet? What does American military and government know about human androids and possible link to genetic harvest in global animal mutilations? One rancher east of Colorado Springs in early 1983 reported that where he had a mutilation of one of his cattle, he saw two men approaching the dead animal and reportedly learned the two were from NORAD inside Cheyenne Mountain! Howard Burgess said a man named Richard Caudell told him that two USAF pilots were exchanged with non-humans and on the non-human planet, one pilot got very sick and one died. Also, a Midwestern investigator of the human abduction syndrome claims she was told there was an exchange of American military and one or more EBENs - like the end of Steven Spielberg's 1977 movie, Close Encounters of the Third Kind. An abductee told the investigator that a few Americans (from USAF?) were taken to a planet called “Estus 3”where non-humans and Earth humans now work together. Is that the EBEN planet orbiting Zeta Reticuli 1 or Zeta Reticuli 2? "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Citizens Against UFO Secrecy (CAUS) investigator and Connecticut policeman, Larry Fawcett, said a man who worked for the National Security Agency (NSA) at Fort Meade, Maryland, told attorney Peter Gersten that during Apollo 14 (third NASA moon landing) that astronauts took pictures of discs on the mon. NSA guy also sounds frightened and said he would be literally killed, murdered, terminated, if he was caught talking. So why is he talking to an attorney with a high public profile? [ Editor's Note: By the mid-1970s, American citizens were f iling requests for information through the recent Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). By 1978, CAUS attorney, Peter Gersten, filed FOIA requests for UFO documents in the CIA and National Security Agency (NSA) and received confirmations from both agencies that there were UFO files. After a U. S. District Court in Houston ruled that 135 UFO documents held by the CIA and NSA should not be released under FOIA on national security grounds, in 1980, Gersten appealed to the U. S. Supreme Court. From a confidential in camera session, mostly blacked out pages were finally released to Gersten and CAUS. ] Kelley Green Fireballs - Released from UFOs? I was told in 1983 that UFOs were the sources of kelley green fireballs that Lincoln LaPaz, Ph.D., University of New Mexico astronomer, studied in New Mexico for the U. S. Air Force from 1948 through the 1950s. If so, what do the kelley green fireballs do? Alien waste disposal in Earth's atmosphere? “Meteorite” cover for surface landing of androids and/or technologies? Other? Wikipedia reports that Dr. LaPaz had a green fireball sighting himself on December 12, 1948, that was simultaneous with another eyewitness sighting of a green fireball over Los Alamos. That enabled Dr. LaPaz “to perform a triangulation. This showed the object's path was directly over the very sensitive Los Alamos Laboratory. “In a classified letter to the Air Force on December 20, 1948, Dr. LaPaz wrote that the object moved far too slowly to have been a meteor and left no ‘trail of sparks or dust cloud’ as would be typical of meteors flying at low altitudes. Other anomalous characteristics were the intense lime-green color, low altitude of only 8–10 miles and yet exhibiting no sou nd, flat rather than arced trajectory, and turning on and off like a light switch. “Investigating many other green fireball sightings, LaPaz reached s imilar conclusions and decided they were probably artificial in origin, perhaps Russian spy devices. LaPaz's green fireball investigations were also mentioned in a 1952 LIFE magazine article, and his wife also made a painting of a green fireball.” P ainting by Mrs. Lincoln LaPaz, who along with her family on July 10, 1947, had their own UFO sighting. Painting published in LIFE Magazine, April 7, 1952."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"U pper right headline: “There Is A Case for Interplanetary Saucers,” includes information about Lincoln LaPaz's study of green fireballs thought to be intelligently designed, Life magazine, April 7, 1952. Howard Burgess said that the kelley green fireballs were also involved in January 1983 events surrounding the alleged crash of an aerial disc in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, that had bodies in it. A big helicopter was allegedly seen lifting wreckage out of Chaco Canyon. The local sheriff's first phone call was supposed to have been to the FBI. And supposedly the FBI also gave a toll free phone number to Lou Girodo in 1975 when Lou was Chief Investigator for the District Attorney's Office in Trinidad, Colorado. Walt Harriman, a park superintendent at the time in Chaco Canyon, told one investigator that whatever it was that came down out of the sky “shook the hell out of them with a big percussion.” Residents in the area said some houses were knocked off their cinder block foundations and windows were shattered. [ Editor's Note: Chaco Canyon and Gallup history on pages 239-240, Secrets of the Mysterious Valley © 2007 by Christopher O'Brien, quotes a January 13, 1983, newspaper article in the Farmington, New Mexico Daily Times that was headlined, “Good Gracious - Great Ball of Fire” by reporter, Rex Graham. L oud sonic booms that shook houses were reported from Gallup, New Mexico (lower left yellow circle) to Chaco Canyon, Farmington, Bloomfield, Aztec, Dulce, and Chama on Wednesday about 5:50 p.m., January 12, 1983. The larger cities of Los Alamos and Santa Fe are in map's lower right. What investigators believe was a meteor smashed into the side of a mountain about fifteen miles east of Gallup on Wednesday night a bout 5:50 p.m., starting a fire and causing a deluge of calls to the McKinley County Sheriff's Office. The incident is believed to be part of a broad"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"“meteor shower” that caused sonic booms in Gallup, Farmington, Aztec, Bloomfield and north to at least Durango, Colorado. McKinley County Sheriff Benny Pad illa said today that his office had r eceived one hundred and twenty-six calls after as many as seven “booms” were heard by area residents beginning at 5:50 p.m. and continuing until about 8:00 p.m. Undersheriff Jack Graham quickly drove east of Gallup to investigate a fire burning on a hillside in the Springstead area, thought to be connected with the “ explosion-like noises.” Padilla and Graham walked through an empty crater about five feet across and six inches deep. There was no sign of plane wreckage. Then, about 10:00 p.m., Padilla and Gallup Police Chief Frank Gonzales were driving in the area when they saw a “green-object” traveling toward the ground. “It looked like a fireball,” Pad illa said today, “and it disintegrated before it hit the ground; it was kinda scary.” ... McKinley County Sheriff Benny Pad illa said the noises around Gallup ceased a bout 8:00 p.m. At about 10:00 p.m., Graham, Pad illa and other law enforcement officials saw a “green fireball” swing across the sky for about fifteen seconds, then disappear. This time, there was no sound as the meteor vanished. Residents in the Farmington area reported seeing a similar glowing object in the s ky. To many, the booms, meteor sighting and explosion and fire seemed part of the same phenomenon. Not far from Chama and Chaco Canyon is Dulce, New Mexico, notorious for rumors about underground levels occupied by non-humans in which biological experiments with Earth life are carried out for unknown purposes. Back in the mid-1970s, the owner of the Chama Land and Cattle Co. allegedly told a Dulce State Patrol officer, “The lights people are seeing around here are coming from that hill up there (on Jicarilla Apache reservation).” The hill he pointed to was northwest of Dulce about fives miles from the Manuel Gomez ranch where a dozen cattle mutilations occurred over a year's time around 1978. The hill is referred to variously as Archuleta Mesa, Archuleta Mountain or Mt. Archuleta. Is there a Defense Special Missile and Aeronautics Center (DSMAC) in the region? Allegedly there is such an agency that might be allied with NSA and EBENs? Bl onds? Reptiles? Other? T he Day After Roswell © 1997 by U. S. Army Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso, now deceased.
