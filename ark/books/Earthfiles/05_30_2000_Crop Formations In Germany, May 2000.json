It comes from above.\" -Frank Laumen, Crop Circle Researcher, Germany May 17, 2000 this formation was discovered in a field of barley at Doernberg close to Zierenberg and Kassel, Germany. This was the third of nine formations in May. Photograph © 2000 by Frank Laumen. May 30, 2000 Kassel, Germany - Since May 1, 2000, nine mysterious crop formations have been discovered in Germany, the greatest number in one month since the phenomenon began to seriously show up in the world in 1990. The first formation found on May 1 by Frank Laumen was in Burghasungen near Kassel after a nightwatch by about twenty people, all looking in the opposite direction. SEE Earthfiles.com Report on May 21, 2000 about mysterious blackness. Behind them across a freeway in a field of yellow flowering oilseed rape appeared two circles connected by a curving pathway and surrounded by four small grapeshot circles. All were neatly formed in the thick crop and in a phone interview recently, Frank Laumen told me there was no sign of any pathway through the crop. Blooming oilseed rape is particularly difficult to move through and people will always leave green paths behind them amid the yellow flowers. Here is a sequence of photographs that Frank Laumen took the first of May in Burghasungen.

There s a famous building that stands on the top of a hill in Kassel built about three hundred years ago. The building looks a little bit like a pyramid and on top of the building is a big statue of Hercules, the son of Zeus in Greek mythology. If you look on a map and start in the middle of Kassel and follow the hills, it will be a line that crosses Bunghasengen and further south to other areas that have had crop formations.\" Researchers are beginning to wonder if Kassel has a leyline relationship in the Germany geography that is not general public knowledge. In England where the crop formation mystery has persisted over more than a decade with more than a thousand formations, there are hundreds of stone circles, dolmens and megaliths which do seem to be along magnetic leylines.

Interview: Frank Laumen, Crop Circle Researcher and Photographer, Leverkusen, Germany: \"We have formations in the north, in east Germany on the East Sea we have two circles and north of Kasssel a bout 50 or 70 kilometers away. Yesterday, (May 27) we entered the field with the flower of life. But in this moment, there came the farmer. He was so angry, it was not possible to talk with him. He told everybody who entered the field, \"I will call the police and go away.\" I think for two hours, he drove around the field and looked and came back to the other car and made a picture of us. He drove away. It was impossible to enter the field. It is so sad.\" HAVE THERE BEEN ANY AERIAL PHOTOS SO FAR? No, I hope I can fly next weekend because at the moment we have problems with the weather. This formation we could not enter the field because this is the field of the angry farmer. This is the problem. This is the same field we had last"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"year this beautiful spiral. SAME FIELD? Same field, every year in this same field, it's one field we have a crop circle in this field every year. IS THIS WHY THE FARMER IS ANGRY? THAT THE FORMATIONS HAVE COME EVERY YEAR FOR THE PAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS? I think he is angry because it's on his land. I think he is not angry if another field. It's his land and this makes problems for him. HAS HE CUT THIS FLOWER OF LIFE DOWN YET? OR IS IT STILL THERE? The flower of life is still there and I hope he will not cut it because next week I will try to fly and make aerials. HAS HE CUT THIS FLOWER OF LIFE DOWN YET? OR IS IT STILL THERE? The flower of life is still there and I hope he will not cut it because next week I will try to fly and make aerials. Also, that 5th formation south of Kassel 20 kilometers near Doernberg (photographs above)- every year we have one or two crop circles there and this crop circle is absolutely so close to the highway, it's impossible that no one could miss seeing this crop circle. And at Burghasungen, it's very interesting. It's a very tiny place. But every year since 1996, we have a crop circle there. IT'S IN THAT AREA BETWEEN KASSEL AND THE ONE THAT HAD THE TWO CIRCLES AND CURVED PATH, YOU FOUND THAT AFTER THE NIGHT THAT ALL OF YOU WERE ON A NIGHTWATCH AND SAW THAT PECULIAR BLACKNESS SETTLE OVER THE AREA. Yes, it was after this night that two circles were discovered and the whole night was very strange. Because two times, we saw this blackness comes from above the sky in the middle of the night after midnight. It was not a fog. It was strange because you could see a car. It comes along the street. But it was not fog. It was dark. I cannot explain what it was. It was very strange. YOU HAD NEVER SEEN ANY BLACKNESS LIKE THAT BEFORE? I think it was two years ago in West Stowell. It was absolute black and absolute quiet. There was no noise of any birds. There was nothing. But it was not so black as this night. It was very special here in Germany. JANET SAID YOU WENT OUT TRYING TO FIND THE FORMATION IN THE DIRECTION OF THE VILLAGE DOWN BELOW, BUT YOU COULDN'T AND YOU FOUND THE TWO CIRCLES WITH THE CURVING PATH BEHIND WHERE YOU WERE ALL PARKED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FREEWAY. That's right. The formation was behind the highway and I think it was 500 meters. It was the first time we had a crop circle in this field because the last years we've only had crop formations on the other side of the highway. This first time we had crop circle on this side of the highway and nobody watched this field. I think it's some type of joke. Everybody watched the fields and behind us appeared this crop circle! I think it's a little funny. (laughs)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"THERE WERE AT LEAST 20 OF YOU WATCHING DOWN IN THE VALLEY ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF WHERE THE FORMATION CAME? That's right. YOU WENT INTO THIS RAPE SEED FORMATION AND YOU GOT THERE ON THAT DAY. CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR A NORTH AMERICAN AUDIENCE THAT IS NOT FAMILIAR WITH OILSEED RAPE, WHAT IT IS LIKE TO GO IN A FIELD? It's not so easy to - when you walk in a field with wheat, it's very easy to put down the crop. But in oilseed rape, it's very difficult. It's like a spider web. It's like a web. ALL OF THE TANGLED BRANCHES. Yeah, that's right. Very difficult to put down the plants. Very difficult. When you watch the areas of the formation that are exactly circles, there is no mistake. That's absolutely difficult for a human. MEANING THAT TO MAKE PERFECT CIRCLES IN OILSEED RAPE IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR HUMANS TO DO? I don't know if it's impossible, but it's absolutely difficult to make it. I'm not sure it's impossible, but the chance for me in my opinion it's impossible to make a perfect circle. WHEN YOU GOT THERE TO THAT FIELD AND FOUND THAT FORMATION, DID YOU FIND ANY EVIDENCE THAT ANYBODY HAD BEEN THERE BEFORE YOU? No, we didn't find any footsteps or anything else. BROKEN PLANTS? No, not the first day. It was absolutely perfect. DIDN'T THAT SEEM TO YOU TO INDICATE THAT HOWEVER THAT FORMATION WAS MADE, IT HAD TO HAVE BEEN FROM SOMETHING COMING FROM ABOVE DOWN INTO THE OILSEED RAPE? For me, it's no question, because I think this energy comes from above. Not from the ground. It comes from above. After the formation in Burghasungen, I was also in the second formation. It was very close to Zierenberg. It was a single circle and we all thought this circle appeared on the same night because the oilseed rape looked old. I think both formations appeared in the same night. THAT YOU GUYS SAW THE BLACKNESS IN THE SKY. Yes, that's right. WHAT WOULD BE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO FORMATIONS? I think 2 kilometers. (About a mile) WERE BOTH OF THESE FORMATIONS THEN BEHIND WHERE YOU WERE PARKED THAT NIGHT?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"\\No, the single circle was on the opposite side of the formation behind us. WAS THE CIRCLE DOWN IN THE VALLEY? The circle - it was possible to see it from the place where we were parked. SOMETHING MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED IN THE BLACKNESS IN FRONT OF YOU THAT PRODUCED THE CIRCLE AND YOU STILL DID NOT SEE ANYTHING BUT BLACKNESS. All that we saw was blackness. A CIRCLE DID APPEAR THAT NIGHT APPARENTLY IN FRONT OF YOU AS WELL AS THE FORMATION IN BACK OF YOU? I think so. I think they were formed in the same night. THAT MEANS THAT EVEN IF PEOPLE WANT TO SEE THEM FORMED, AT LEAST THAT NIGHT WHATEVER HAPPENED THE ENERGIES DID NOT ALLOW ITSELF TO BE SEEN. That's right. I think there - I think every crop formation that appears, it's a secret. (laughs) The energy is very deceptive. WHAT ARE THE REASONS YOU THINK THE ENERGIES COME DOWN FROM ABOVE INTO THE FIELDS? Because there are so many sightings about lights and wind, strange winds, and I think it's coming from above. For me, there is no other explanation. When you look at a crop circle and when you enter a crop circle you see the flattened crop with a beautiful lay sometimes. There is no other explanation. You enter this crop formation. You think, 'No, there is no other explanation. It must be coming from above.' RIGHT. ESPECIALLY IN FORMATIONS AS YOU HAVE HAD IN GERMANY THIS SPRING, THOSE FIRST TWO IN OILSEED RAPE IN WHICH YOU WERE THERE YOURSELF AND YOU COULDN'T FIND ANY PATH WAY OR EVIDENCE THAT ANYONE HAD BEEN THERE BEFORE YOU. We didn't find any footprints. We didn't find anything. THIS YEAR IS THE MOST FORMATIONS YOU'VE HAD IN THE KASSEL AREA SINCE IT BEGAN IN 1996? Yes. And I think the reason is that the first three weeks in May we had only sun and warm weather. I think the crop grows very fast when you compare it to the last years. We had a very warm spring. BEAUTIFUL FIELDS? Yes, no wind damages. This is the first time we have no wind damages. FRANK, YOU HAVE BEEN STUDYING THESE FOR A LONG TIME. WHAT IS YOUR OWN PERSONAL OPINION NOW ABOUT WHAT IS BEHIND THE CREATION OF THE FORMATIONS? It's very difficult to explain. I think that crop circles show us there is more than what we are thinking. We think this material world is all, but I think there is more. When you are in a crop circle, you think, 'Wow!' It's very difficult to explain. You have to enter a crop circle to see what I mean. It's very difficult to explain. Because I saw my first crop formation in 1997 and it was the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Woodborough Rings, the Torus. And I thought, 'Wow, it's absolute brilliant to see a crop circle!' And when you enter this crop circle, you think, 'No, it's not from humans. No human can make this crop circle. Absolute brilliant.' RIGHT, AND THAT TORUS REALLY WAS SOMETHING, ALL THOSE DOZEN THIN RINGS ALL BEAUTIFULLY CROSSING EACH OTHER. AND IF HUMANS AREN'T DOING THE TRULY MYSTERIOUS FORMATIONS, FRANK, WHAT, OR WHO, DO YOU THINK IS? That's a good question. The most people are making are aliens, but I'm not sure. I think there is more. It's some kind of intelligence, but I'm not sure what kind of intelligence. It's very difficult. I'm not sure it's aliens. I think there is more. It could be the earth, the energy of the earth. Or you have so many times the relationships to the old kinds of ancient monuments and crop circle. There's a relationship between ancient monuments and crop circles.\" We b s it e s : http://www.franklaumen.de/Anfang.htm http://cropcircleconnector.com/Sorensen/PeterSorensen99.html http://194.200.2.248/~paul/search.cgi?d=uk00an Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
