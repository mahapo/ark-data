When she is impressed by crop patterns while photographing from an airplane, Lucy tries to get into the formations on the ground. That's what she did after photographing the 300-foot-diameter Barbury Castle. Lucy and a friend did not get into the formation until June 7, one week after it was first reported on June 1, 2008. She and I talked about the condition of the crop on Sunday, June 8. She said the interior showed no damage from mechanical devices or trampling, but she was puzzled by broken stalks at the edge of the outer perimeter. After this June 8 Earthfiles interview, I received an email the next day from Lucy: “I spoke to Charles Mallett (owner Silent Circle Crop Circle Research Center). He confirms that the very obvious damage that we saw in the Barbury Castle formation at both the inner and outer edges of the large exterior ring were NOT there when he visited it (on June 1). Clearly someone was out to muddy the water, it seems?” Further, I interviewed Charles Mallett, who entered the Barbury Castle field around 10:30 AM on June 1, the morning it was first reported. There had been rain the day before and the ground was muddy. Charles said he had to walk about 200 meters to reach the pattern and had mud all over his boots. But when he reached the young barley formation, it was “perfectly clean - no one had been tromping on that fragile, young barley.” B arbury Castle barley crop formation near Wroughton, Wiltshire, U.

The implication is that people, possibly working for government agencies, don’t want the public and media to take the global crop formation phenomenon seriously for unexplained national security reasons. This has been discussed among crop formation investigators since the notorious Doug and Dave showed up in September 1991. Those two elderly men claimed they were responsible for the crop pattern mystery. To my and other investigators’ astonishment, even The New York Times ran with a headline and story in September 1991, that two retired men, Doug Bower and Dave Chorley from southern England, were the explanation to the global crop circle mystery. That summer of 1991, crop formations had been reported and photographed in about 23 countries, including wet rice paddies in Japan. So, it was a phony and impossible explanation that Doug and Dave were traveling the world every day making all the crop formations in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Yet, today in 2008, most media and many in the public think the preposterous Doug and Dave announcement from September 1991 explained away the crop phenomenon, leaving “manmade hoaxes” as the politically acceptable perspective the media should take. To me, it was a manipulative and predictable routine by government operatives to muddy the crop circle waters, as Lucy said. I had also run into preposterous predator, disease and satanic cult explanations for the worldwide, bloodless animal mutilation mystery where physical and forensic evidence add up to very high strangeness. Further, law enforcement and military sources for"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"decades have stated categorically that “creatures from outer space” are the perpetrators of the global animal mutilations. But no government source to date has leaked exactly who, or what, is responsible for the global crop formations with their embedded mathematical language. But authorities keep pushing Doug and Dave and manmade hoaxers as responsible, while those same agencies secretly study crop fields with infrared cameras and equipment searching for the mysterious balls of light that have long been linked to the creation of crop circle patterns. Regardless of government policies of denial to divert public and media attention, the 2008 Barbury Castle barley pattern and its ratcheted spiral can be described as a “Rosetta Stone” for placing precise numbers in even the most fragile barley field. Interviews: L ucy Pringle in Wiltshire, England, crop formation. Lucy Pringle, Crop Formation Aerial Photographer, Researcher and Author, Hampshire, England: “What we are dealing with is barley at the moment and I have to say in the 2008 Barbury Castle formation, I’ve never seen such a fragile crop before. Just walking on the plants and going back where I had walked, the stems were crushed. And I’m not a very heavy person. I was wearing very light canvas shoes and I remarked to my colleague in the Barbury formation with me how extraordinarily fragile that crop was. It was most unusually fragile barley. Barley is also a crop in which you don’t ordinarily get a heavy pattern imprint in the formations to begin with. This 2008 Barbury Castle is springing back up very noticeably. THE FACT THAT YOU DID NOT FIND DAMAGE INSIDE OF BARBURY CASTLE, GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOUR OWN LIGHT CANVAS SHOES CRUSHED THE PLANTS, WOULD SUGGEST THERE HAD NOT BEEN ANYTHING MECHANICAL ON THE INSIDE OF THE BARBURY PATTERN. YOU WERE THERE A WEEK AFTER IT WAS FIRST REPORTED ON JUNE 1. Well, yes, but this is the extraordinary thing - there was damage on the perimeter of it. [ Charles Mallett, long-time crop circle investigator and owner, Silent Circle Crop Circle Research Center, said he visited the 2008 Barbury Castle formation not long after it was first reported on June 1, and did not find any damage on the perimeter or inside the 300-foot-diameter pattern.] Who Manipulates the Phony “Manmade” Explanation? ADDING TO THAT COMPLEXITY IS WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE GOVERNMENT FORCES OR AGENCIES THAT WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DAMAGE THE MYSTERIOUS PATTERNS TO KEEP THE PUBLIC AND MEDIA FROM TAKING THE CROP FORMATIONS SERIOUSLY? Indeed! In fact, I had quite an issue with the BBC's (British Broadcasting Corporation) Newsnight. Now, BBC Newsnight is supposed to be a program of integrity. It comes on about 10:30 PM in the evening in the U. K. and is hosted by a man named Jeremy Paxman. He is a very astute, well thought of man who is very good at asking questions. He is a very bright man. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"J eremy Paxman, Host, BBC2 Newsnight , England. This particular program was on May 13, 2008, and they were discussing the recent mid-May release of UFO files (by U. K. Ministry of Defence) after 30 years. Then to my and others horror, the program played footage of Doug Bower with Dave Chorley (‘Doug and Dave,’ September 1991 video demonstration) making crop circles. So, I took this up with the BBC saying since this was supposed to be a news program with integrity, they were showing completely flawed footage and they should have shown both sides of the crop phenomenon – the scientific side as well as the manmade. I said quite forcefully I wanted someone to actually ring me back in order to discuss this. The BBC office took three weeks. They rang me back this week and said, ‘It was only a jokey program.’ I said, ‘There’s nothing that says ‘jokey program.’ What you portrayed was presented as fact on a program that is known to be credible and with known integrity and you have portrayed this as fact (manmade hoaxing explains crop formations). The reply was, ‘Oh, we’re sorry you think like that. We’re not planning to do any in-depth programs on crop circles.’ THE BBC MADE ITS POLITICAL STATEMENT BY RUNNING THE VIDEO OF DOUG AND DAVE MAKING FORMATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE U.K. UFO FILES RELEASE. Ye s , y e s , b u t w h e n Newsnight said to me the BBC had no intention of doing any in-depth study or program on crop circles, I thought that really says it all. They are not prepared to look at the crop phenomenon seriously. IT'S A COMMENT ABOUT MEDIA AROUND THIS PLANET, EXCEPT FOR A FEW OF US WHO KEEP TRYING TO REPORT IT FACTUALLY. You do it in a critical way and we have to be critical in our research because that’s the only way the research can be credible. BUT WHY AREN’T MORE SCIENTISTS AND ENVIRONMENT REPORTERS IN ALL OF THE COUNTRIES LOOKING AT CROP FORMATIONS AND THE REAL PHYSICAL EVIDENCE? Well, I think that they are scared, Linda. I think they have their reputations to think of. WELL, I FRANKLY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN GUIDED BY WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING – AND NOT BY WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK! I know! I know, Linda, but they (scientists) with all their degrees and so on, they feel they cannot jeopardize that.” Charles Mallett Has Seen Planted “Hoaxer Evidence” in Originally Pristine Crop Formations Charles Mallett agrees. He has been investigating crop formations in southern England for ten years and now runs the Silent Circle Crop Circle Research Center located at the White Horse Inn bed and breakfast complex in Compton Bassett, Wiltshire. Not only is he frustrated by the U. K. media’s dismissal of crop formations as not a serious phenomenon to investigate and report about, Charles is convinced, as I am, that government agencies have been deliberately contaminating truly mysterious crop formations, such as the June 1, 2008, Barbury Castle, to make the public and media think humans were involved. Interview:"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"C harles Mallett, Wiltshire, U. K. Charles Mallett, Owner, Silent Circle Crop Circle Research Center, based within the White Horse Inn bed and breakfast complex in Compton Bassett, Wiltshire, England: “For example, Lucy was concerned about the serious damage to the perimeter when she was there on June 7. That damage was NOT there in any physical evidence on June 1, when I was there at 10:30 AM, right after it was reported to Mark Fussell at Cropcircleconnector.com, who called me. Therefore, I would suggest that the perimeter damage was inserted some time afterward, entirely in keeping with nefarious things that go on in southern English crop circles. I have been to crop circles in the past that have been perfect at 8 AM, and when I visited back in the afternoon, it looked like a bad hoax because it had been trashed. Generally, over my ten years of experience investigating crop formations, I’ve been in at least a dozen crop formations that I know for a fact were tampered with – even to the point where I found perfectly placed pen torches (flashlights) at the center of circles. I’ve also found string and pieces of wood strategically placed to be found, things placed exactly in the center of formations as if left there specifically to create the impression of a manmade hoax. There was one amazing formation I visited at 7 AM with some researcher friends from Norway. We looked over that pristine formation for at least an hour. Then a stranger turned up, spent three minutes in the crop pattern, and then walked away. Five or ten minutes later, one of our group found a pen torch placed right in the center of the circle and we realized the stranger must have put it there because it was not there when we first entered. Why would anyone walk out into a nowhere field and put a pen torch in the middle of a crop circle?! I’ve been to formations that I know were in fine condition and later on that day, they have been subjected to some kind of major physical assault. So, I believe quite firmly, there is some attempt to discredit some circles or groups of circles or the phenomenon in general. There is some agency involved in trashing the subject, whether the media is used, or on the ground, or wherever. THOSE AGENCIES ARE FOCUSED ON MISINFORMATION AND AS LUCY SAID, ‘MUDDYING THE WATERS’ ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE TRULY IS A MYSTERIOUS PHENOMENON RELATED TO SOME SORT OF PHYSICAL ENERGY THAT IS NOT MANMADE. Yes, and generally the methods of researchers are fairly well known. It would be fairly obvious that one would go to particular places to look for damage. I could go into a brand new crop circle and create enough damage in ten minutes. I could have done this at Barbury Castle, spending ten minutes on my own creating enough damage to make it look like an obvious hoax. Then every level-headed researcher who went in subsequent to me would say, ‘Oh, God, look at this damage and look at those pole holes there and there. This is obviously a hoax.’ Then they would have walked away and not realized they had something really, really amazing! – which is the 2008 Barbury Castle crop circle as it stands right now out in that field.”"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"O ne of three circles inside the Barbury Castle young barley formation photographed around 10:30 AM, on June 1, 2008, 90 minutes after first 9 AM report to Mark Fussell, Cropcircleconnector.com.
