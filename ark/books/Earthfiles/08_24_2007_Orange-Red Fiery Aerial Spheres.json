Brian Fields, USAF, Ret. August 24, 2007 Mount Morris, Michigan - A month ago on Saturday, July 14th, high strangeness took place in the English county of Warwickshire at a pub in Shakespeare’s home town of Stratford-upon-Avon. The pub is called The Lone Elm on Birmingham Road in the center of town. That night around 10:30 PM, at least eight employees and about one hundred people in the pub, all watched orange lights move into a formation in the sky. The lights stopped still in a pattern that did not change for nearly a half hour. And there was no sound. See Earthfiles 072707. About 150 miles southeast in Farnsborough, Hampshire, other eyewitnesses the next weekend on July 22, watched nine red-orange lights which suddenly appeared – “popped in,” they said - a few at a time and moved into various formations before disappearing again “as if you switched off a light.” I wondered if the 2007 orange-red lights in English skies might be the same aerial craft that have showed up in the United States and Canada over the past 40 years? Red-orange, fiery spheres of light in the air and near the ground were seen by law enforcement and ranchers all over North America back in the late 1960s to early 1970s. Eyewitnesses linked the appearances of the red-orange balls of fire to animal mutilations and intrusions in nuclear missile bases. Orange-Red Aerial Craft Intruded On SAC Bases in Fall 1975 Over three weeks in October to November 1975, several Strategic Air Command (SAC) bases in the northern states were placed on a high priority alert because of unidentified aircraft flying at low altitude over atomic weapons storage areas. The head of NORAD, the North American Air Defense Command, sent a message to NORAD divisions that began: “Since October 28, 1975, numerous reports of suspicious aerial objects have been received at NORAD. Reliable military personnel at: 1) Loring AFB, Limestone, Maine 2) Wurtsmith AFB, Oscoda, Michigan, near Lake Huron, east of Michigan National Guard Military Reserve and Artillery Range. 3) Malmstrom AFB, Great Falls, Montana 4) Minot AFB, North Dakota, and the 5) Canadian Forces Station at Falconbridge, Ontario, "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Canada have visually sighted suspicious objects.” On October 30, 1975, at Wurtsmith AFB in Oscoda, Michigan (no longer active) - southeast of the Roll Away Campground near Mio on the Au Sable River – low-flying orange lights hovered and moved up and down erratically near the air base perimeter. Some of the mysterious aircraft were boldly flying and hovering right over the totally restricted nuclear weapons storage area. Only four months before then in July 1975, Richard Johnson and his friend, John, in their early twenties, went camping at Roll Away Campground on the Au Sable River, between the Michigan National Guard Military Reserve and Artillery Range and Wurtsmith AFB. The two young men arrived, set up their tents during daylight and went hiking. After their return, the two were shocked by what turned up across the river. [ Editor’s Note: Michigan's Au Sable River runs approximately 140 miles (225 km) through the northern Lower Peninsula, through the towns of Grayling and Mio and enters Lake Huron at Oscoda. Au sable in French means \"with sand.\" Most of the main branch of the Au Sable flows through or adjacent to the Huron-Manistee National Forest. Five percent of the land in the watershed is federal National Forest and 29% is Michigan state forest. ] M io (pink circle) on Au Sable River is between the Michigan National Guard Military Reservation and Artillery Range and retired Wurtsmith AFB to the east formerly in Oscodo on Lake Huron (not shown on map). Interview: Richard L. Johnson, Technical Engineering Assistant, General Motors since 1978, Mount Morris, Michigan (outside of Flint): “As the evening rolled along, we were sitting on these high banks and the Au Sable River is quite wide there. We noticed across the river that we thought someone was camping because it was a large fire. We hadn’t noticed it before. It was like an orange glow. So, the next thing we know, this orange ball pops up and goes down above the treetops. We look at each other like, ‘Did you see that?!’ And ‘Yeah!’ This thing popped up and down and came out and came down the river and was in front of us. It was probably about 20 feet in diameter. It was just an orange ball. I can tell you that we were pretty frightened. The hair on my neck was standing up and I said, ‘Whatever it is, it knows we’re here.’ I started talking to it, thinking, ‘What are you? What do you want?’ It was an orange ball in the air and it looked like it was on fire. It moved up to about a 2 o’clock position on us – like flames because that’s exactly what we thought we saw around it was flames. It kept coming in toward us and back and in toward us. Of course, we were out in the middle of nowhere and had nowhere to go. IF YOU WERE GOING TO SELECT AN ORANGE COLOR WE WOULD ALL KNOW, W H AT W O U L D T H AT B E ? Kind of like when the sun sets. That kind of an orange with a little yellow mixed in. But, of course, this was midnight. AND IT WAS CLOSE TO YOU? Pretty close – I’d say within 50 yards. WAS IT CASTING ANY LIGHT AND SHADOWS ON THE GROUND?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I don’t remember. We just didn’t know what to think. We were afraid. THIS IS SPHERICAL, AS FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED? Ye s . NOT A DISC SHAPE? No, it was spherical. AROUND THE SPHERE, WHAT EXACTLY LOOKED LIKE FLAMES? When it moved up to the 2 o’clock position, it just seemed like it had these little flames coming off the edges of it. When I talked with my friend, John, about it, he remembers that, too. (John now lives in California.) We thought someone had a big fire going over on the edge of the trees and maybe someone was camping over there. But all of a sudden, we saw part of the edge of the ball pop up and then it was bouncing up and down on the treetops, moving to our right. Then it came out down the river to our right and then slowly made its way up toward us. SO IT WAS DOING THAT BOUNCING BALL MOTION ALONG THE TREES? Yes. We would say, ‘Which way is it moving now? Is it right?’ He would answer, ‘Yes, to the right.’ Then it would go down and come up. So, we wanted to verify that we were watching the same thing. HOW CLOSE DID IT COME TO YOU? On the other side of the (Au Sable) river, which I guess would be 50 yards. No more than 75 yards. IT NEVER CROSSED THE RIVER TO YOU? No, it just came down. DESCRIBE THE MOTION THAT YOU PERCEIVED AS COMING TOWARD YOU AND BACKING UP AND SO FORTH. It was bobbing up and down at the treetops and when it came out to the river where it was in full view, it just slowly moved with no bobbing straight in front of us. There was no sound. WHEN YOU SAY IT MOVED TO STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU, DO YOU MEAN IT STAYED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER? OR DID IT CROSS THE RIVER AND COME RIGHT UP TO YOU? No, it stayed over on the other side of the river. BUT YOU COULD SEE WHAT YOU THOUGHT WAS MOTION UP TO THE RIVER BANK, THEN BACK AND THEN FORWARD AND THEN BACK? Right. Telepathic Effort AT ANY POINT, DID EITHER OF YOU HAVE ANY TELEPATHIC IMPRESSIONS? I just knew that whatever it was, it realized we were there. Back then, I was 20-years-old and I was just - we did try to communicate with it telepathically – you’re correct. We did try to do that. But to no avail. We didn’t hear anything. No voices. Nothing. But we did try to communicate with it telepathically – I can’t believe you said that because, yes, we did try that. HOW LONG DID THIS CAT AND MOUSE FORWARD AND BACKWARD ACTION GO ON? I want to say it went on for about 40 minutes. WHAT DID THE TWO OF YOU SAY ABOUT WHAT IS THIS?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I had told my buddy, John, ‘It has to be a UFO and it knows we’re here.’ But we didn’t really know what it was. We just knew it was something we had never seen. We said to each other, ‘Nobody is going to believe us when we get back.’ The strange thing about it is that we both don’t remember when it left. But we were laying on our backs and looked at each other and went, ‘Oh, my gosh!’ THE LAST MEMORY YOU HAVE IS YOU ARE NOT STANDING UP ANYMORE, BUT YOU’RE LYING DOWN. THE ORANGE SPHERE IS GONE AND YOU’RE WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED? Yeah. See, we were actually sitting on the edge of the river bank with our feet over because the banks were probably 20 feet high. So we were just sitting on the edge of the bank looking at the stars and listening to animals. Neither one of us could remember when it left. But I do remember when we were on our backs. We looked at each other like, ‘Oh, my God.’ Then we went to our tents and went to sleep. SINCE THAT TIME WHICH WAS JULY 1975, HAVE YOU EVER HAD VERY VIVID DREAMS THAT INCLUDED THE ORANGE SPHERE? No, I haven’t. I’ve heard of a lot of similar sightings. 1997 Dream of Skies Full of Discs WHAT ABOUT OTHER VIVID DREAMS OF ANYTHING YOU WOULD PUT INTO THE CATEGORY OF NON-HUMAN? Yes, I’ve had dreams of UFOs, yeah. WHAT HAPPENED? Oh, boy! I remember one dream about UFOs that wasn’t good. I was trying to hide from them and they were all over the place. Not really sure what was going on, but I knew I had to hide. IN THE DREAM, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING IN THE SKY WHEN YOU SAY UFOS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE. WHAT SHAPES? AND HOW MANY? Disc-shaped. I’m trying to go back at least ten years. THAT’S WHEN YOU HAD THE VIVID DREAM? Yeah. What 1997 – what’s important about that date is – I used to watch that show, Sightings, all the time. I was watching and it said in the summer of 1975, three orange balls came down into three U. S. Air Force bases – one, I believe, was in Maine. One was in North or South Dakota and one was in Wurtsmith AFB, which we were not too far from (on camping trip in Mio). And it said that three orange balls came into these air force bases one particular night and that they had disarmed their (base) nuclear weapons. They were spotted by several people on the bases. And I said, ‘Oh, my God! Maybe that’s what I saw.’ Because when we were camping out there during the day, we could see bombers going over. They were doing their runs. SO, THAT NIGHT ON THE RIVER, HOW FAR WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN FROM THAT AIR FORCE BASE? I’m sure I was within a 30 mile radius. SO, WHAT THAT ORANGE, FIERY SPHERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DOING THAT JULY OF 1975 WHEN YOU AND JOHN WERE SITTING ON THE BANK OF THE RIVER, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MONITORING THE MILITARY BASE? Correct. AND WHAT YOU DON’T KNOW IS WHETHER YOU TWO WERE ABDUCTED? OR ONE OF YOU WAS ABDUCTED? Right, I don’t know that. IN 1997, WHAT VIVID DREAM DID YOU HAVE? I just remember that I was in a city. I was just there all of a sudden. Nothing built up to it."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"There were UFOs flying everywhere. They were saucer-shaped. The sky looked kind of grayish. All I knew was that I had to hide. I had to get behind these bushes. I did and from what I can remember, there were things walking down the street, which I didn’t see, but just had that feeling that I needed to get down and get out of the way. I remember looking up in the sky and saying, ‘Oh, my God, there are UFOs everywhere!’ WHAT WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET? I don’t know - a presence I had to hide from. I couldn’t tell. I don’t know if they were Greys. I don’t know what they were. I just knew I had to hide. IF YOU COULD ESTIMATE HOW MANY YOU WERE SEEING IN ANY OF YOUR MEMORY, COULD YO TALK ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF DOZENS OR HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OR WHATEVER? I would say dozens. THE SKY BEING GREY SOUNDS AS IF THIS WAS NOT NIGHT? No, it was like an overcast day. I hid in like this hedge. ONCE YOU’RE IN THE HEDGE, WHAT HAPPENS IN THE DREAM? I thought something is not right here. Where did all these UFOs come from? Are we being invaded? So, I got out of that dream pretty quick! “Hidden Truth” HAVE YOU BEEN WORRYING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE DREAM WILL COME TRUE? THE SKIES WILL BE FILLED WITH DISKS AND THAT YOU WILL HAVE TO HIDE? I believe there are probably several different people visiting our planet and some are good and some are bad. I do believe that we’re going through some changes. I don’t know if this is different than anybody else has felt through the years, but I just feel that something is going to happen and I don’t know - as far as maybe contact and everybody actually knowing what’s going on. But yeah, I have a little anxiety about it. But at the same time, I have a little excitement, too. IT WOULD BE NICE TO GET PAST ALL THE LIES AND GET TO THE FACTS OF WHATEVER IT IS THAT INTERACTS WITH OUR PLANET. Correct. Because it’s been going on for a long, long time! And I believe that the truth has been hidden from us and we have a right to know.” More Information: If viewers have more information about aerial orange spheres in your region, please email me at earthfiles@earthfiles.com NICAP Report about October 30, 1975, Wurtsmith AFB, Michigan, UFO Incidents: Oct. 30, 1975 - Wurtsmith AFB, Oscodo, Michigan 10:30 - 11:00 p.m. A KC-135 tanker was returning from a refueling mission. It entered Wurtsmith's traffic pattern and received permission to fly transition approaches. Col. Boardman ordered the KC-135 to attempt to identify the object. Wurtsmith air traffic control vectored the tanker in the object's direction. Aboard the KC-135 was Major Frederick Pappas, the plane's commander; Captain K. E. May, co-pilot; Captain Rick Meier, the navigator; Captain Myron Taylor, instructor navigator; Captain Randy Higginbotham, instructor pilot; and Sergeant Steve Smith. Captain Taylor: “We were returning from a refueling mission and during our first approach into the traffic pattern, RAPCON vectored us to check out a reported UFO in the area of the Wurtsmith Weapons Storage Area. As I recall, this activity occurred between 10:30 and 11:00 p.m. in the evening around the 1st of November (later established as Oct. 30). I remember seeing lights similar to strobe lights which were flashing irregularly. We followed the lights north out over Lake Huron and then the UFO swung south still over the lake toward"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"the Saginaw Bay area of Michigan. “At first it was difficult to determine whether there were two different objects because of the irregular flashing of the lights. But, after observing the lights we determined that there were in fact two objects and the irregular flashing appeared to be some sort of signal being passed from one to the other in an effort to maintain the same position. We were able to maintain visual contact most of the time and I was only able to paint an object on the radar scope for about 10 seconds. I would estimate that our altitude was about 2,000 feet and our speed approximately 200 knots. “Shortly after turning south in pursuit of the UFO, we called Approach Control and received blanket clearance to follow the UFO at all altitudes and at all vectors. Occasionally, RAPCON would pick-up the UFO and help us by giving us vectors to the UFO's position. I would guess that we stayed close to the UFO most of the time, approximately one mile away, and each time we attempted to close on the object it would speed away from us. We followed the UFO down to Saginaw Bay and started across the Bay when we lost it because of all the fishing boat lights. At first we thought it had landed on one of the large oil tankers, but later decided that we had been wrong. “We continued to search the Bay area but didn't see it so we changed our heading for Wurtsmith. On the way back, we picked the UFO up again at our eight o'clock position. We turned away, and it proceeded to follow us. Finally, we turned back in the direction of the UFO and it really took off back in the direction of the Bay area. I know this might sound crazy, but I would estimate that the UFO sped away from us doing approximately 1,000 knots. “We continued in the direction of the Bay until RAPCON called us again and said they were painting a UFO four to five miles over the coast traveling in a westerly direction. They vectored us to the position of the UFO and we proceeded, but at that point we were low on fuel and were forced to return to Wurtsmith. I remember that while on final approach we saw the lights again near the Weapons Storage Area. Following the mission we discussed the incident and about a week later, Captain Higginbotham was questioned by the Office of Special Investigations (OSI) and cautioned not to discuss the incident.\" Please see other Earthfiles reports about government knowledge of unidentified aerial disks in the Earthfiles Archive: Strategic Air Command (SAC) • 11/28/2006 — Part 2: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue • 10/19/2006 — UFO Retaliation to U.
