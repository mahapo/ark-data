S. Army knew that it had succeeded in bringing down two examples of the foreign (disc) technology. \" - J. Andrew Kissner R eturn to Part 1 (cont.) Military Intelligence, Flying Discs and Plane Crashes O n June 27, 1947, it was announced that \"two top generals\" from U. S. Army Ordnance would visit WSPG the week of June 30. Major General Everett S. Hughes, the commanding general in charge of U. S. Army Ordnance and Brig. General Henry Saylor, Chief, Research and Development Group and a member of JRDB's Upper Atmosphere Rocket Research Panel. The two Generals were visiting WSPG to \"inspect the new safety devices installed on V-2s\" and to witness the next launch on July 3. But there really were no new safety devices on V-2s to inspect and there would not be a V-2 launch on July 3. [ Source: El Paso Times , June 27, 1947.] On June 28, two people were killed when their \"low flying\" rented plane struck an electric pole, sliced off a wing and crashed into Lake Ontario. The plane had been flying lower than the treetops. [ Source: The New York Ti mes , June 29, 1947, p. 25.] T he New York Times , June 29, 1947, p. 25. Also, two men died in \"a blazing plane after it had smashed into the roof of a one-story bungalow\" in Canaan, Connecticut. It took hours to remove the bodies that had been \"embedded\" into the roof of the house. The plane could not gain altitude after take off and flew directly into the roof setting it on fire. The plane, based in Brooklyn, was on its return trip when the accident occurred. [ Ibid.] "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"T he New York Times , June 29, 1947, p. 41. About three weeks later on July 18, 1947, Corporal Harvey S. Whitacre was reported to have gone missing on June 30. His \"blood stained shirt and cap\" were reportedly found in an alley in Albuquerque on July 3. Whitacre was assigned to the AFSWP at Sandia Base. There might have been $500 in cash on him when he disappeared. So, robbery was was suspected motive. But the Army was concerned about his disappearance because he possibly \"had sensitive information about atomic bombs.\" What happened to Corporal Harvey S. Whitacre of the AFSWP? [ Source: Las Cruces Sun-News , July 18, 1947.] Also reported to be on June 30, but might have happened earlier, was 18-year-old \"discharged soldier,\" Jose G. Serna of Mountainair, was fatally burned when the car he was driving ignited in flames about 45 miles from where Mac Brazel would find the flying disc debris. Serna lost control and his car rolled down a 300 foot embankment. With his clothes on fire, Serna crawled out of the crashed car and rolled in the grass to smother the flames. He died in Albuquerque. [ Source: Las Cruces Sun-News , July 2, 1947.] At Tinker Army Air Field, the first of many standard military replies were voiced about the flying disc sightings. \"Oh, applesaucers,\" said Col. Frederick Bell. He said he would like to meet the man who flew the discs. Another cynical jet pilot added that possibly those people making the reports \"were seeing headlines instead.\" On July 2, 1947, the Army released a statement that said that although the Army believed that most people were sincere, there was a form of mild hysteria circulating and that the flying disc phenomenon is more \"like a study in human psychology\" than a study of aerial phenomenon. This military propaganda came only five days after Army antiaircraft artillery in a modified Wasserfall surface-to-air missile - or perhaps an Army air Forces fighter piloted by Capt. Dyvad - had just shot down two flying discs over WSPG. An Army General called a press conference and assured the American people that \"we weren't being invaded by men from Mars.\" By July 5, 1947, flying discs had been reported in at least thirty-one states. Many of those reports were from El Paso, Las Cruces and Carrizozo in southern New Mexico and West Texas. [ Source: Las Cruces Sun-News , July 6, 1945.] On July 2, 1947, the high energy physicists involved in the development of America's first atomic bombs were recalled to Los Alamos Laboratory for \"summer research\" by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). The AEC's request came five days after the U. S. Army knew that it had succeeded in bringing down two examples of the foreign (disc) technology. Aviation experts believed they might be nuclear powered. [ Source: Las Cruces Sun-News , July 2, 1947.] The physicists asked to join the \"summer research\" at Los Alamos included Enrico Fermi, who had left Los Alamos only two years before and was brought back from the University of Chicago. Another physicist was Edward Teller, who would go on to develop the hydrogen bomb and establish Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Others were Frank Hoyt, also from the University of Chicago; Frederic J. de Hoffman from Harvard; John Calkin from Rice Institute; Robert Bacher from Cornell; G. K. Rollefson from the University of California; Charles Critchfield from the University of Minnesota; and Joseph Keller from Iowa State University. All came together in July 1947 at Los Alamos \"to work together on the hill.\" Then on July 4, 1947, Corona rancher W. W. (Mac) Brazel reported to the Roswell Sheriff that he found remains of a crashed flying disc in one of his pastures 40 miles north of White Sands Proving Ground.
