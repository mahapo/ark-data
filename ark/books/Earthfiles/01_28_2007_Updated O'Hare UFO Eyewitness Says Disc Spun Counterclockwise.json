January 27, 2007 Gary, Indiana - The Chicago O'Hare Airport disc sighting by a dozen United employees on November 7, 2006, was apparently seen and photographed by many other people. Yesterday, an Indiana resident came forward to go on the record without her real name to describe what she and a friend saw from O'Hare's international parking lot before 5 p.m. local time. She asked to be called \"Jane Doe.\" Her background includes three years of college and her work has ranged from radio news reporting to culinary training and cooking in restaurants.

Interview: Jane Doe (requested anonymity), Gary, Indiana : “A friend and I had gone to O’Hare to the international terminal to pick up a friend of ours who we went to school with. He is a pilot on a run that brings him from France to the U. S. We had gone to pick him up as we have done every few months. In fact, I’m at O’Hare at least two or three times a month picking up assorted friends and dropping them off. His plane was due in close to 5 p.m. We got there a bit early and were going to park in international. But I never take interstates when possible. I was born in the Washington, D. C. area and there is a beltway there that is an anathema to me. So, I try to take surface streets and I always cut through Chicago rather than take the interstate. So, I was taking Irving Park over to Manheim Road, which runs directly into O’Hare Airport. Where I turn onto Manheim, you only have a couple of blocks to go before the airport and airport property starts right around you then. From when I turned onto Manheim, there was road work so I was attendant to that. And as soon as I put my attention forward at the airport, I saw it (disk in sky). It was very low. The cloud cover that day was very low as well. It was a uniform cloud cover. It was not like there was a cloud here and there. It was a uniform gray sky all day. I saw this object. The object was ahead of me and to the left, very north-northwest of where I was and also very close within several blocks of me. I wanted to keep watching the object, so when I pulled off to go to the international terminal parking lot, I pulled into a part of the lot where I could keep watching this thing. Once we parked in the parking lot and got out and started looking at it, there were already some other people who were looking at it. Then for those who weren’t, if they walked near anybody who was watching, those people pointed it out in the sky. There had to be at least two dozen people that I know were watching it at that (international terminal parking lot) location. Description of Aerial Object \" There was a lustrous quality to it like a pearl that almost made the metal seem like warm and soft and fuzzy instead of a hard, metallic object.\" Its appearance was unusual because it seemed very reflective of color, almost mirror-like. Yet, at the same time it did not impress me as being a highly polished thing. There are some things about the surface of this thing that I can’t really express in words. It in no way gave the appearance of a highly mirrored object, yet I could tell when I saw it on Manheim Road, for example, that the object looked more to me like the cell phone photograph (disc in upper right of photo and O’Hare Airport in bottom left with angled horizon). When I was on Manheim Road at an angle that showed me more of the side of the craft, that’s really the closest thing to what I saw (first cell phone image). It had that same light on top and darkening on the bottom, which when I got into a position in the parking lot and could see the bottom of the thing more that was even more clear as a dark gray bottom"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"effect under it. But it had kind of a pearly quality from the side when the light was more fully on it. When I was at the international terminal, I could get more of an underneath angle and from there it looked like a darker gray and you could see it was a much lighter color up towards the top. I got the feeling that the shadow on the bottom had something to do with reflectivity of the object. I got the sense the craft was rotating somewhat rapidly in a counterclockwise motion. I just caught this motion that wasn’t just random distortion around it – there seemed to be a cyclical pattern involved. It didn’t really seem to wobble, unless it was such a fast wobble that accounts for the lack of sharpness of the object. COULD YOU ESTIMATE ITS DIAMETER? I thought at the time from the side was it was probably around 25 feet in diameter at most, just based on my proximity to the two angles I saw it (from Manheim Road and from the international parking lot). And I would guess it was about 6 to 8 feet in its height at the highest point. SIX TO EIGHT FEET HIGH AND TWENTY-FIVE FEET IN DIAMETER. COULD YOU EXPLAIN MORE ABOUT THE USE OF PEARLY SURFACE? There was something about the surface – I don’t know if it was caused by the rotation – but on the one hand it seemed to mirror whatever sources of light and shadow were around it. Yet, at the same time, it didn’t strike me as a highly polished metallic surface. YET, IT APPEARED LIKE THE LUSTRE OF A PEARL? Exactly. There was a lustrous quality to it like a pearl that almost made the metal seem like warm and soft and fuzzy instead of a hard, metallic object. AND IT WAS DEFINITELY SPINNING COUNTERCLOCKWISE? That is my impression. It seemed there was a rhythmic motion, very rapid, but consistent in a counterclockwise direction. WOULD YOU SAY IT WAS EGG-SHAPED OR ANOTHER SHAPE? I would not say egg-shaped because the elliptical part of it was really even, whereas an egg is kind of bigger on one side than the other. This was more an even shape, but a very curved shape. I know some of the people who first described it said it looked like a Frisbee. But a Frisbee is a lot flatter than this was. It was not the stereotypical disc. There was a lot more structure to it than that. IF AN EGG WERE EVEN PROPORTIONED, WOULD THE DISK HAVE BEEN EGG-SHAPED IN THAT DEFINITION? Yes, a bit more when seen from the side. When seen from underneath or at the angle I saw from the parking lot, you could kind of get a more disc-like look from it. SO IT WAS ROUND, BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PERHAPS LIKE AN EXPANDED DISC, TALLER. Exactly. It would have to be taller in the middle with no serious sharp angles at the end – just rounded curve at the sides, rather than the usual saucer-on-saucer straight edge kind of joint. Round Craft Below Low Cloud Ceiling HOW HIGH WAS IT ABOVE YOU AS YOU STOOD WATCHING IT IN THE PARKING LOT? I wasn’t directly underneath it by a long shot. I was at an angle to it at that point. Where I stopped, I was looking close to due west, but that still put it over the main terminal airport area. But I was well under a quarter mile from it. I estimated at the time that the clouds were probably around 1800 feet high. I THINK OFFICIALLY IT WAS CLOSER TO 1500 FEET. It was a very low ceiling day and this thing was below the clouds. I wouldn’t say it was much below the clouds."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"LET’S SAY THEN THAT IT WAS LESS THAN A QUARTER MILE FROM WHERE YOU ALL WERE IN THE INTERNATIONAL PARKING LOT AND MAYBE AT ABOUT 1,000 FEET? Yes, I would say 1,000 to 1,200 feet. It was a little under the cloud level. It was a hazy day, as well, though. But it was not foggy. Visibility was not that great, but within that quarter-mile distance, it was perfect. You couldn’t mistake what you were seeing. Many Watched for At Least 10 Minutes and Took Photographs We watched it from the international parking lot for about ten minutes (and about 5 more minutes before while driving). There were many people there taking photos – cell phones and digital cameras. So, there ARE pictures out there. One gentleman was in a little group that had clustered around where I was standing, he had a digital camera and he was planning to pick up relatives “from the old country.” He hadn’t seen them in years, so he had taken his camera to photograph them. He stood there just shooting photo after photo after photo. There are many photographs out there. That is part of my purpose in contacting AboveTopSecret.com about this because it had people doing research on the photos and a core group of them sounded serious enough that I decided it can’t hurt to email and talk to you and say to other people: ‘This story is not going to die. And you’re not necessarily going to be considered a freak. And look, you can do this anonymously. Please get the photos out!’ This was the most plainly visible event and for it to be coming down at an airport like O’Hare in the daytime, very obviously not caring who is watching – and indeed might be soliciting observations! I really thought the thing was going to land. You realized when you were watching it that if that happens, everything is going to be different from now on, every single thing in the world!’ I really thought that whatever is in that thing – and believe me, there was no mistaking it for a lenticular cloud or any weather phenomena (Federal Aviation Administration tried to dismiss the multiple eyewitness sighting as a weather phenomenon). This was very clearly something solid, something metallic, and something under control. Atmosphere Disturbed Around Aerial Craft \" It was almost visually like if you were watching a distant cloud of gnats. You would not be able to see the gnats, but you would be able to see the impression of motion.\" YOU DESCRIBED THAT IT WAS SPINNING. COULD YOU SEE ANY KIND OF DISTORTION IN THE AIR AROUND IT? Yes, there was distortion very close to the craft. It did not at any point expand out from it that I saw. It was very close to the craft. It was almost as if you could see constant motion in the air very close to it. It almost seemed like the air was excited around it – that there was motion in it. It was almost visually like if you were watching a distant cloud of gnats. You would not be able to see the gnats, but you would be able to see the impression of motion. It was kind of like that around the object. Disc Punched Hole Through Clouds \" The hole was there. Everybody was just open-mouthed that the craft did go through the clouds. People gasped. Several people screamed because nobody had anticipated motion.\" When it did take off, it went from basically zero to God only knows how fast. There was no acceleration. It just went. It did punch a hole through the clouds. [ See 010207 Earthfiles. ] I wasn’t directly underneath the hole. It kind of angled in our direction slightly to the east, I believe. It did leave a hole and it didn’t even seem that the clouds moved as it punched through. But then after it was gone, they began filling back in. That was it. The hole was there. Everybody was just open-mouthed that the craft did go through"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the clouds. People gasped. Several people screamed because nobody had anticipated motion. At that point, most of us had been watching it for at least a few minutes at that point. SEVERAL FOR TEN MINUTES. At least because there were several people who were watching it when I got into the parking lot. AND YOU WERE THERE FOR AT LEAST TEN MINUTES. I was there for about ten minutes and I had seen it on Manheim Road for about three or four minutes earlier. So, overall from when I first saw it to when it punched a hole in the clouds, probably thirteen to fourteen minutes. YOU WERE SEEING IT STATIONARY WITH A SPINNING QUALITY AND THIS GNAT-LIKE DISTURBANCE OF THE ATMOSPHERE AROUND IT, WHEN IT MOVED, WAS IT JUST A STRAIGHT SHOT UP? WHAT HAPPENED? From a dead stop, suddenly you saw the motion. You saw it go up those few hundred feet, but it was almost so fast that you couldn’t even process it until after it was gone. There was no acceleration. No noise that I could tell. But there were jet engines and there was the heavily trafficked road between us and the object. But there really seemed to be no noise that I could perceive from it. Probably the United workers fairly well under it could tell better on that. It just at a slight angle in our direction, which would have been slightly east, it just was gone! THE HOLE WAS INSTANTANEOUS? Instantaneous. COULD YOU SEE BLUE SKY THROUGH IT? I wasn’t under the hole right under it to see that. I could not see blue sky, but I could see the hole, the shadow. I could see there was a hole there. I do know that some people took photos of that. I can’t tell you how much I want to see the photos that I know are out there coming out to the public. There were plenty of people with digital cameras. And there were several cars that stopped on Manheim Road, which is a very busy road at that time of day who had stopped who were taking photos of the object. There have to be at least several dozen photographs of this thing out there. This was the most impactful sighting I can imagine, unless it had dropped down completely to the ground and entities got out! I cannot imagine what it would take to be more convincing to anyone than seeing this object. There was no way it was anything other than a solid metallic object, (spinning counterclockwise).\" More Information: If viewers have more information about the November 7, 2007, Chicago O'Hare Airport hovering disc over concourse C-17, please email me: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.
