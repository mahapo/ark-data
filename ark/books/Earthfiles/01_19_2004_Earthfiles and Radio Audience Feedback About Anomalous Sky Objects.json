Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Earthfiles and Radio Audience Feedback About Anomalous Sky Objects © 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe January 19, 2004 Jamison, Pennsylvania - The following are a selection of many e-mails that have come from radio listeners and Earthfiles.com readers since I reported about highly strange aerial objects in Napoleon, fifteen miles east of Horton, on Coast to Coast AM with George Noory and at Earthfiles.com on the night of January 16-17, 2004. See: January 16, 2004 - Earthfiles about Strange Aerial Objects Over Napoleon, Michigan. 1) E-mail from Bob Wood on January 17, 2004, California: \"Hi, Linda. I get to listen to Coast to Coast maybe two or three times a month. And this morning, you had a couple of gentlemen describing 'craft' they'd seen near this (Horton's Mud Lake) Michigan ice circle. I have nothing to offer about the circle, but as they described the craft they have observed (in Napoleon, 15 miles east of Horton), I could feel the chills and the goosebumps. I've not thought about it for years, but I remember being at my grandmother's house on a mill village (Hatch Street) in Greenville, South Carolina when I was a boy. Early 1970's - I was under 10, so my memories may be a little cloudy, but I remember the jaw-dropping awe of watching it float over us and across the sky out of sight. I remember thinking of Christmas lights. The spinning and flickering and the ... undulating almost, as the lights seemed to expand, or move outward and upward in arcs on both sides before dipping more sharply at the tips - like wings. I remember thinking it looked kind of like a butterfly. This is the description that connected for me when I was listening to the show. I remember specifically red and white (there may have green, but I'm not sure anymore - Christmasy though) pinpoints of lights, bright but not so bright you couldn't look directly at them. And I remember thinking it must be a blimp or hot air balloon since it made no sound as it drifted across the street my grandmother lived on and passed over a couple of houses down. I remember it floating in the sky for a long time - probably no more than five or ten minutes, but to me at the time it seemed to last forever. In order of events: My mom had been out on the porch and came in. She was scared but laughing. She asked my grandmother to come outside and look the lights in the sky. We both went out and I was enthralled. I immediately ran out into the yard. My mother retrieved me and kept trying to contain me, but I just kept "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"running out there and watching it. After a few times, she just let me stand in the yard and watch it. After that long ten minutes or so, she made me come inside, but even then I watched it out the kitchen window on the opposite side of the house for a few minutes. I remember those few minutes very well, but not the answers to any of my questions about it the next day.,Today, Mom is 74 and in pretty poor health.,I'm going to see her tomorrow afternoon and I think I'll be asking what she remembers of the night. I know this doesn't apply so much to your circle, but the similarity of experience (about the unusual sky objects), the coincidence ... I just couldn't pass up the opportunity to tell you about it. Ta k e c a r e , Bob Wood\" 2) E-mail from Terry on January 17, 2004, California: \" Linda Your show is great. I don't know if I am blessed or cursed, because I have seen just about every type of UFO in the last 25 years. You were talking about three lights in the shape of a triangle. In Nov 1999, I was walking my dog at the Newport Dunes about 8 pm. I noticed three bright, what looked like three stars shaped like a triangle. I watched them because they seemed odd. They where south of Saddleback mountain over the area where TRW is. I kept watching and when the stars got brighter, I became a little more interested. Then the two bottom stars combined became brighter and then a beam of light came from the top object which became dimmer. The bottom object became real bright and then just vanished in the blink of an eye. I have seen many things over the years. I believe whatever they are, they are allowing me to see them for whatever reason. Two years before in July of 1997 in the exact same area, a friend and I saw a diamond shaped object about 2.30 in the afternoon. We watched it for about 45 minutes, as it appeared to be spinning. It was sending and retrieving particles. My friend does not believe in UFO's but could not explain it. We watched it kind of float away towards Catalina Island where it finally vanished. I am very rational as a person and am a little baffled. Thanks, Terry \" 3) E-mail from KHJ on January 17, 2004, Michigan: \"Hi Linda, This is just a curious co-incidence, but the day before you filed your report about the aerial objects in Michigan, my husband and myself were visiting an Indian mound in Epps, Louisiana called Poverty Point which has a very large bird shaped mound. I was very surprised to see the drawing of the bell-shaped object with wings because it looked very much like the shape of the mound we had just visited. (Drawing by eyewitness in Napoleon, Michigan on January 16, 2004). Perhaps people thousands of years ago"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"experienced seeing something unusual in the sky and made an effigy of it. Unfortunately there is no site on the web that accurately depicts the shape of the mound, however there was a drawing on a movie we saw at the archeological center that more accurately portrays what it looks like. Some web sites show it looking like an eagle but that is not correct, in fact it looked just like a bell shaped object with wings, and of course it would have looked green in the past before trees grew on it. My husband is on a sabbatical and we are touring the south and specifically looking at ancient sites. Then in February we will be traveling to southern Spain and France and doing the same thing. We live in Lansing, Michigan, so I was interested that objects were seen close to home.\" 4) E-mail from DP and CP on January 17, 2004, Idaho: \"Ms. Howe, I and my high school teacher, wife Cynthia enjoy your contributions to CC. Last night's show convinced me to tell you of our experience. I will try to be concise, but that is so difficult when explaining such an event as we experienced. Here goes. Aug. 6, 1992, We were returning from a trip to Utah and driving on Hwy 12 in Idaho (coming from Montana into Idaho) approximately 60 miles from our home in Lewiston, Idaho. It was 1:00 a.m. on a dark, clear night (no moon but very starlit). The hwy is very winding, following the Clearwater River East to West. I thought I was seeing a home window that was high on the hill side on the opposite side of the river. Then I realized the light was right over the river only yards from the highway and our slow moving auto. It appeared to be one square shaped light until we seemed to come to another side of the object and then we could see three square-ish lights and one round light (in the formation of an exclamation mark laying on it's side.) We came to a complete stop, oddly we had not seen any other traffic during this whole time. We rolled down windows and NO SOUND. It seems to float over us and ahead of our position (over the highway) and on over the low horizon to our south. (On a map we would be West of Kamiah, Idaho and North of Nezperce, Idaho (both small village size communities.) When it cleared the horizon there was a glow as if a large fire existed on the other side of the horizon. After some time (we are confused whether moments or minutes...we became rather euphoric feeling), a round light (only) seemed to just \"pop\" over the horizon (about three hundred yards from our position) and stay in one spot. Then, in literally seconds, it 'shot' to the heavens. We watched that object (light?) for several minutes (it seemed) as it appeared to travel 'in the stars.' Then we lost sight as it went further and further. We spent so much time trying to question each other as to what we had seen, what we should do, what we should have done. Then all of a sudden, we were (in our car) physically 50 miles down the road and at the approach to our home town. We spent several days asking each other all those same questions. We did not want to tell anyone we knew about this for our concern of no one understanding. Finally, one week later I researched the UFO reporting agency in Seattle and called them and made a report and sent drawings. We never heard back from them which seemed odd to us as this was an incredible event and we are such credible people. I called him back and he said 'Oh, we usually don't call back; we believe what you saw'... and he recommended that we call MUFON. I called MUFON and they had a field person in a town 40 miles a way and geographically near where this object traveled towards from our first sighting. Her name was Li and she came to visit and told us she was being"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"'trailed by people that wanted to harm her and she was worried for her own safety.' This all seemed to odd to us. So after giving her our details we chose to let things be. We have only shared this with our closest friends and family. I have never heard a description like what we saw. Our region has a history of UFO declared sightings. DP and CP\" 5) E-mail from NH on January 17, 2004, Florida: \"Hi Linda, I called Coast to Coast, but somehow got cut off so I'll relate my experience in this email. I have no problem with the social stigma connected to a sighting, but seldom mention it because, like a great axiom, to truly appreciate it you need to have the experience. In 1993, around 9:00 pm, a friend and I stepped into a dark parking lot on the way to a show. I looked up at the sky as I always do and seen what I thought at first was a shooting star. Then I realized it was way too slow moving for such and I also seen another running parallel some distance away. My curiosity made me look in the direction they were going and I seen a third 'light'. This 'triangle' was enormous, and made absolutely no sound. I could not actually make out the craft - only as a blacked out portion of the night sky that blended nicely except for the lights or friction burns or...? I know this is just one more story. I no longer have a doubt they exist. The question most in my mind over the years has been, 'Could our government, our technology, be that advanced?' Anyway, I believe the universe is teeming with life and have often thought that our solar system may really look more like a parking lot at WalMart with all the extraterrestrials... :o) Sincerely, N. H., Florida\" 6) E-mail from DP on January 17, 2004, Napoleon, Michigan: \"We've had reports of UFO's near the Napoleon area for years. I live 7 miles from there. Back when I was 13 years old back in the summer of 1986, I had a missing time experience on my grandfather's farm which is about 7 miles northwest from Napoleon. I went to feed our dogs and was walking down a flight of cement steps near the milk house and the next moment I remember is walking back up the steps and looking back over my shoulder. Up in the sky, I saw three bright lights side-by-side that faded out of the visible spectrum into infrared (?). About an hour of time had passed because the Sun was high up in the Western sky. I think it was about 7 PM. When I looked back at the sun after my missing time experience, the sun was down near the horizon and it appeared to be about 8 PM. I ran up into the yard where my parents were sitting at the picnic table drinking some beer and they asked me why I was gone so long. I told them I saw a UFO and naturally they laughed, probably thinking I was just a kid making up a story. But I still remember that missing time event like it was yesterday. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"So I've never told anybody this story for the last 18 years probably due to embarrassment and ridicule. But with all of these other stories coming out, I might as well add my own story to the record. And I'm not the only one who's had unusual experiences. A co-worker at a fast food restaurant I used to work at saw UFO's near Wolf Lake, about 3 miles north of Napoleon a few years ago. The co-worker is reluctant and embarrassed to to talk about it. A few years ago there was a story in the local newspaper, the Jackson Citizen Patriot , of a family near Wolf Lake seeing a group of UFO's. Naturally, everybody laughed at them, but they stuck to their story. Last August, my brother and myself were outside and we heard a loud reverberating explosion, kind of like the sound of a small asteroid or bolide entering the atmosphere and exploding. My brother's police scanner was buzzing with calls of people in the area reporting a loud explosion, but the source was apparently never determined. So UFO's are not unusual around here if you pay attention to their presence. DP\" 7) E-mail from MM on January 20, 2004, Oregon: \"Hi Linda, I heard part of the show you did with George Noory the other night, and it made me think of a sighting that a friend of mine had back in the late 70's or early 80's. My friend has passed away, but we had been best friends for probably 30 years or more. This happened in about April or May of whatever year it was. I remember about how tall the green grass was out in the fields at that time. Sphere Cloaking Device My friend Jack was driving home from work one afternoon and was about a mile North of Brownsville, Oregon, on what the locals call Seven Mile Lane. He was passing by a farm that is owned by the Spurlin family. Just North of the farm house, and about 200 yards from the road Jack saw a silver sphere on legs in the tall grass. He said he looked away, shook his head and looked back, and as he was looking the second time the sphere just disappeared. He said, \"At first I thought I was going nuts! I thought about it for a few seconds and I knew I had actually seen it. The craft had a cloaking device, and I figured out basically how they did it.\" I had him explain it to me. He said, \"Think about this; if you could photograph everything in 360 degrees, but in a sphere, then project it in every direction on the skin of the craft you would be invisible from every angle.\" I thought about it and it made perfect sense. It would be like looking at the screen on the back of a digital camera, only perfect visually. The other night you mentioned people who had seen constellations and parts of the night sky move en masse. I am convinced that is how the extraterresterials are doing this with their craft. Think of one of the black triangles or other huge craft. I think they are somehow taking a picture of the sky above and projecting it to the bottom of the craft, and what is seen from below is an exact copy/reflection from above it. As it moves it would appear, from the ground, that the stars are moving. It would be like some kind of techno-magic to us, because we"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"don't have the technology to do it. I don't think that any of the black projects have the technology either. Triangle of \"Moving Stars\" in Summer of 1979 I think this happened in the summer of 1979. My girlfriend an myself were both on summer vacation from college. We went catfishing one night. We were setting on the bank and there was a Coleman lantern next to my fishing pole. About midnight my girlfriend started hollering and screeching. 'Look at that! What are they? What are they?' I had nearly total night blindness from staring at my fishing pole next to the lantern. I ask her what it was and where it was. She said, 'Straight up.' I said, 'All I can see is stars. What do they look like?' I blocked the light from the lantern with my hand and my night vision started coming back. She said, 'They look like stars, there are three of them. They were flying in a triangular formation and stopped straight above us. Keep watching.' I did and they moved apart into a larger triangle, and stopped again. Then after, I'd say, a minute or so they moved back into their original positions then flew off, and upwards, away from the planet, in a sweeping curve, in perfect formation simultaneously. It was as if they were unified by a single computer, or possibly 3 computers, which I believe is very possible. They moved away to the Northeast. They appeared to be outside the earth's atmosphere. Miles high, and were out of sight in about 4 to 5 seconds. It still boggles my mind to think about how fast these things moved in space. They were certainly under intelligent control. They were blue-white and about the intensity of the brightest stars in the sky, and about the same size as the largest stars in relationship to their position. I've thought about this sighting many times, and wonder what they were doing? The only conclusion I can come to is that they were taking a triangulation of something, maybe a snap shot. Almost every time I've seen an ET craft I have gotten the feeling they are gathering data. I can't imagine what would possibly interest these visitors in Western Oregon. Then again, there have been many UFO sightings in the Western part of the state, besides mine. Most do not get reported. I was thinking about the sightings I have had, and I've had probably close to 30 that I know were not craft from \"our neighborhood\". What really is strange to me is that every one was different, except multiple like objects within a particular sighting. The variation alone is mind blowing. I go into the NUFORC site and read about the different sightings and there is so much variation the descriptions of craft, and different odd behaviors, that it is just astounding. Wobbling Aerial Disk in Daylight, November 2003 I had a sighting in mid-November 2003. It was my first daylight sighting. I was out in the backyard. It was about 4:10 p.m., if I recall correctly. It was overcast, a typical November day in Oregon. Something caught my attention, as it crossed the roofline above the neighbor's house. There was a little sunlight peeking through the clouds in the West. I didn't think too much about it at first, because I thought it was a mylar balloon that had escaped from someone. As I kept watching I noticed that it wasn't moving like one of those flat balloons. It was wobbling steadily and regularly on an even axis, like a toy top. Not only that, it was moving against the wind at about a 70 degree angle. Also it had a brown or dark copper colored dome"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"underneath that was about 1/3 the diameter. I couldn't see if it had anything attached on top. Slowly, after I had watched for a minute or two, it started dawning on me that this was no balloon. I thought about film and video I have seen of UFO's that made the same wobbling motion. Everything was wrong about its movements. I ran in the house and grabbed my binoculars, which I regret doing now, and it was gone. That astonished me even more. I could not have been away for more than 15 seconds, and if it had been a balloon it would have been impossible for it to have completely moved out of my view. The very next thing I saw was a small single engine private airplane moving into the vicinity from the West at low altitude. I'd say the plane was flying at about 600 feet maximum. That gave me a whole other perspective, literally. The object that I had been watching earlier had been at least a couple of thousand feet away from my direct line of sight, and much larger than I thought. It had to have been about 30 to 40 feet in diameter, maybe a bit larger, judging by the wingspan of the plane. This is total conjecture, but what I think happened is this; whoever was controlling that craft saw the airplane approaching and zipped off, or up into the clouds, just after I ran in the house. That's why I regret going to get the binocs. I have no idea if the pilot saw the thing or not. I am pretty sure he could have, he was moving towards the area in a general direction, but lower in altitude and much closer to me from where the object was when I saw it last.\" Sincerely, M.M.\" 8) E-mail from R.J. on January 20, 2004, Colorado: \"Dear Ms. Howe: I was listening to you on Coast to Coast a.m. and boy was I glad to catch that show! You described people witnessing what appeared to be a big piece of the sky moving and that for many people this experience is life changing. I am one of those people. My experience happened when I was about 6 or 7 years old...1979. I grew up in a very rural part of South East Colorado. The houses were far apart and we generally knew all of our neighbors. I was allowed to walk quite a distance to the neighbor boy's house for a birthday party and was told not to walk home if the party went on until after dark. I was to call for a ride. Well as a child I really didn't have much sense of time (It's still not much better!) and began to walk home as the sun went down thinking I had plenty of time before dark. Of course I was wrong and as darkness fell I began to worry about how much trouble I was going to be in. I knew my mother would take my new comic book away as punishment. So I ran against the night and tried to take a short cut. I told myself if you couldn't see any stars yet then it wasn't really night. As I approached my home I really began to feel fearful, not because of how much trouble I could be in but because I couldn't see any stars. I stared and stared and finally saw what I thought at first was a moving light...maybe a small plane. Then another light popped and another and it was as if the stars were turning on in the distance. I was terrified when I realized something very very large and dark and silent was above me and seemed to be blocking out the stars. It did seem like a chunk of the sky was moving. It was the most disturbing thing I'd ever seen. I have no idea how long I stood. I have a very good idea of the term 'frozen in fear.' All was frozen but my bladder. I do remember trying the doors to my house once I could see all of the stars and my mother was not there. She was out looking for me. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"I hid among sunflowers and cornstalks until she got home. I had a terrible need to feel protected and covered. To this day that feeling has not gone away. I love to look at the full moon from my window but to go out at night and gaze upwards is still very hard for me. My mother did not punish me by the way and could tell something had really frightened me. My father who was in the Air force tried to convince me that it was probably a large plane and \"everything looks bigger to kids.\" Nice try dad. One other thing that may or may not be related--- I have not been able to wear a watch since. The batteries die within a week or so. Thanks for allowing me to share this experience. I have shared it with very few people as they always treat me as if I was just an \"imaginative child\". I have no idea how something that large could be out there and not be noticed by others.
