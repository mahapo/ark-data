Here begins Part 2 of Status Report I, written July 29, 1978. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report II begins at Earthfiles. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. For all the previous status reports, see Earthfiles Archives. Leonard H. Stringfield: \"ABSTRACT 5 - Kingman, Arizona Crash Research Director for MUFON, Raymond E. Fowler of Wenham, Massachusetts, watched incredulously as Fritz Werner signed the following affidavit, dated June 7, 1973: June 7, 1973, Signed Affidavit by Fritz Werner: 'I, Fritz Werner, do solemnly swear that during a special assignment with the U. S. Air Force on May 21, 1953, I assisted in the investigation of a crashed unknown object in the vicinity of Kingman, Arizona. The object was constructed of an unfamiliar metal which resembled aluminum. It had impacted 20 inches into the sand without any sign of structural damage. It was oval and about 30 feet in diameter. An entrance way hatch had been vertically lowered and opened. It was about 3.5 feet high and 1.5 feet wide. I was able to talk briefly with someone on the team who did look inside, only briefly. He saw two swivel seats, an oval cabin, and a lot of instruments and displays. A tent pitched near the object sheltered the dead remains of the only occupant of the craft. It was about 4 feet tall, dark brown complexion, and had two eyes, two nostrils, two ears and a small, round mouth. It was clothed in silvery, metallic suit and wore a skull cap of the same type of material. It wore no face covering or helmet. I certify that the above statement is true by affixing my signature to this document this 7th day of June, 1973.' According to Ray Fowler, a researcher of highest credentials, here is Werner's story: 'I was project engineer on a U. S. Air Force contract with the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) for 'Operation Upshot-Knothole' at the Atomic Proving "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Ground, Nevada. My job involved the measuring of blast effects on various types of buildings, especially erected for the tests. On May 20, 1953, I worked most of the day at Frenchman Flat. In the evening, I received a phone call from the test director, Dr. Ed Doll, informing me that I was to go on a special job the next day. On the following day, I reported for special duty and was driven to Indian Springs Air Force Base, near the Proving Ground, where I joined about fifteen other specialists. We were told to leave all valuables in the custody of the military police. We were then put on a military plane and flown to Phoenix, Arizona. We were not allowed to fraternize. There, we were put on a bus with other personnel who were already there. The bus windows were blacked out so that we could not see where we were going. We rode for an estimated four hours. I think we were in the area of Kingman, Arizona, which is northwest of Phoenix and not too far from the Atomic Proving Ground in Nevada. During the bus trip, we were told by an Air Force Full Colonel that a super secret Air Force vehicle had crashed and that since we were all specialists in certain fields, we were to investigate the crash in terms of our own specialty and nothing more. Finally, the bus stopped and we disembarked one at a time as our names were called and were escorted by military police to the area that we were to inspect. Two spotlights were centered on the crashed object, which was ringed with guards. The lights were so bright that it was impossible to see the surrounding area. The object was oval and looked like two deep saucers, one inverted upon the other. It was about 30 feet in diameter, with convex surfaces, top and bottom. These surfaces were about twenty feet in diameter. It was constructed of a dull silver metal, like brushed aluminum. The metal was darker where the saucer 'lips' formed a rim, around which were what looked like 'slots.' A curved open hatch door was located on the leading end and was vertically lowered. There was a light coming from the inside, but it could have been installed by the Air Force. My particular job was to determine, from the angle and depth of impact into the sand, how fast the vehicle's forward and vertical velocities were at the time of impact. The impact had forced the vehicle approximately twenty inches into the sand. There were no landing gear. There were also no marks or dents, that I can remember, on the surface - not even scratches. Questions having nothing to do with our own special areas were not answered. An armed military policeman guarded a tent pitched nearby. I managed to glance inside at one point and saw the dead body of a four-foot, human-like creature in a silver metallic-looking suit. The skin on its face was dark brown. This might have been caused by exposure to our atmosphere. The face was not covered, but it had a metallic skullcap device on its head. As soon as each person finished his task, he was interviewed over a tape recorder and escorted back to the bus. On the way back to the bus, I managed to talk briefly with someone else going back to it at the same time. He told me that he had glanced inside the object and saw two swivel-like seats, as well as instruments and displays. An airman, who noticed we were talking, separated us and warned us not to talk with each other. After we all returned to the bus, the Air Force Colonel who was in charge had us raise our right hands and take an oath not to reveal what we had experienced. I was instructed to write my report in longhand and not to type or reproduce it. A telephone number was given me to call when the report was complete. I called the number and an airman picked up the report.' Ray Fowler states that Werner held several engineering and management positions at Wright-Patterson AFB between June 1949, and January 1960. During that period, he worked in the Office of Special Studies of what was then the Air Materiel Command Installations Division. Later, he designed aircraft landing gear and became Chief of Alighting Devices within the Aircraft Laboratory at Wright Air Development Center. At the time of the alleged incident, he was on assignment to the Atomic Energy Commission at the Atomic Proving Ground in Nevada. Fowler also states that Werner told him that he sympathized with the Air Force's secret handling of the UFO problem and added that the Air Force did not know where UFOs originated. Werner also said that the Air Force believed that the UFOs"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"were interplanetary vehicles, but that they did not know how to handle the situation. They did not want to create panic. Comments Fowler: 'There were inconsistencies in Werner's story, but most appeared to be in the realm of memory lapses and exaggerations by the witness. Former employers that were checked held him in high esteem and all described him as a highly competent and moral individual. Having published a number of technical papers, Werner also holds membership in the American Association for the Advancement of Science.' In Fowler's continuing evaluation, he cites one piece of evidence which seems to give a strong element of truth to Werner's account. In an attempt to pin down the exact date of the alleged incident, Werner agreed to show his diary he kept in those days. On its aging papers on May 20, 1953, it read in part: 'Well, pen's out of ink. Spent most of day on Frenchman's Flat surveying cubicles and supervising welding of a plate girder bridge sensor which cracked after last shot. ...Got funny call from Dr. Doll at 10:00. I am going on a special job tomorrow.' On May 21, 1953, the diary read: 'Up at 7:00. Worked most of the day on Frenchman with cubicles. Letter from Bet. She's feeling better now - thank goodness. Got picked up at Indian Springs AFB at 4:30 p.m. for a job I can't write or talk about.' COMMENT: In my book, Situation Red, I cover the Werner story in full based on my conversations with Ray Fowler. Said Fowler, 'With more substantiation, it could blow the lid off secrecy.' I agree. One final note: the name Fritz Werner is fictitious, but I feel that his story - although embellished - is basically true. One Intelligence source commented, 'A lot of it is just story.' ABSTRACT 6 Finally a name of a witness surfaces - an Air Force Major named Daly - who was a metallurgist stationed at Wright-Patterson AFB in 1953. He relates his adventures with a crashed UFO. The source for this information comes from fellow Cincinnati-based researcher, Charles Wilhelm. A friend of Charles' father, he related in 1968, that in April 1953 he was flown to a destination unknown, where it was hot and sandy, to examine the crashed UFO. He was blindfolded and driven to a point about 30 minutes away from the base of operations. There, inside a tent, standing in soft sand, his blindfold was removed. From there he was taken to a location where he saw a silvery metallic craft about 25 to 30 feet in diameter. The exterior of the craft, he said, was not damaged. However, his on-the-spot two day analysis of the ship's metal, using the equipment he carried with him, showed that it was not native to Earth. Major Daly, although he was not permitted to enter the craft, observed that the craft's entrance measured four to five feet high and two to three feet wide. COMMENT: Major Daly's blindfolded trip to the crash site, similar to that of Fritz Werner's, indicates that it was common procedure for the military to use extreme security measures relative to UFO retrievals. It is to be noted that Major Daly's experience takes place in April 1953, a month shy of Fritz Werner's which was in May 1953. Also, to be noted is that Daly did not see any dead alien bodies. Maybe they had already been removed? Or, if the craft was found undamaged, as he attested, it is possible the occupants managed to evade capture? Or, perhaps, there were two crashes in a desert area in the Spring of 1953. If, however, both the reports of Werner and Daly are describing the same crashed UFO event, it is possible that Daly used the wrong month. ABSTRACT 7 'I'm almost positive it happened in 1953,' said my informant, a man with a long career as a pilot in the military who held the rank of Warrant Officer in the Army during the early 1950s. Now serving in the Air National Guard, he stood by me, facing a large wall map of the U. S. in a backroom of the Administration Building at Lunken Airport in Cincinnati. Earlier, in a large front room before about 25 pilots, I had just spoken on the subject of UFOs. It was now the late Summer of 1977 as he"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"tried to recall the exact time when he stood as a witness, at a distance of about 12 feet, peering at five crates on a forklift inside a hangar at Wright-Patterson AFB. In each of three crates, he said, were the recovered dead bodies of small humanoids; the contents of the other two crates were not discernible. As he related this astonishing information in a matter-of-fact manner, he pointed vaguely to an area in Arizona on the map. 'Here's where it approximately happened,' he said. 'It was a desert area, but I don't have the name of the location.' There was no one else in the map room when he told me about the incident. He made certain of that. 'It's still a secret and at the time I had to swear to it,' he said. 'I was in the right place at the right time when the crates arrived at night by DC-7.' As we stood at the map, my informant described what appeared to be hastily prepared wooden crates. In these, little humanoids, appearing to be four feet tall were lying unshrouded on a fabric, which he explained prevented freeze burn from the dry ice packed beneath. As a number of Air Police stood silent guard nearby the crates, he managed to get a reasonably good but brief glimpse of the humanoid features. He recalls that their heads were disproportionately larger than the bodies, with skin that looked brown under the hangar light above. The head appeared to be hairless and narrow. The eyes seemed to be open, the mouth small, and nose, if any, was indistinct. When asked about their attire, he said they appeared to be wearing tight- fitting dark suits. Because of the tight-fitting suit, there was one revealing feature - a surprising feature. One of the humanoids appeared to him to be female. He said, 'Either one of the aliens had an exceedingly muscular chest, or the bumps were a female's breasts.' Later, he learned from one of the crew members, with whom he bunked at the barracks, that the body of one of the aliens was, indeed, that of a female. My informant also heard from the crew member that one of the little humanoids was still alive aboard the craft when the U. S. military team arrived. Attempts were made to save its life with oxygen, but were unsuccessful. Another question, an important one, was promptly answered by my informant. How did the military know about the crash and where to go? He said he heard from a crew member that the UFO was picked up by special tracking equipment at Mt. Palomar in California. They provided the coordinates to the military to determine the crash area. The retrieved craft found intact, he later heard, was sent to Wright- Patterson. He had no more details when or by what means. COMMENT: There were other details furnished by my informant concerning his encounter at Wright-Patterson and on other sensitive UFO issues, that might be identifiable or traceable to him. On his request, I have avoided using these data. For certain, there are a lot of things connected with the UFO that the public does not know about.\" C ontinued in Part 3 - Alien bodies in Dutton, Montana, and Wright-Patterson AFB Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
