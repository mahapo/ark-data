Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Mystery Stalks The Prairie © 1976 by Roberta Donovan and Keith Wolverton Chapter 5 The Montana Site deas are sometimes rejected by human beings simply because those ideas lay beyond the realm of their acceptance. Ideas that seem too far out are discounted as fantasy, labeled impossible or simply ignored. The Cascade County deputies, working to solve the rash of cattle mutilations, felt no idea was too weird to merit careful consideration. For this reason, they have considered the theory that the mutilations were the result of some cult and they expended considerable time investigating reports that might indicate positive confirmation of this theory. \"Some people believe the theory that mutilation is done by devil worshipers,\" Captain Wolverton said, \"and we don't discount it. It could be true.\" There has certainly been evidence that could indicate this is the answer. And if a cult is responsible for the mutilations, it would explain in part why the blood is often drained from the animal and certain parts of the animal removed. About two months after Captain Wolverton started investigating the mutilations, he discussed them with a law officer in another part of the state who had moved to Montana about two years earlier. The officer said he believed the mutilations involved a cult of witches. He told Captain Wolverton that he had information, but was reluctant to talk about it. The officer's theory was that the cattle were being tranquilized with PCP, a hallucinogenic drug. The blood was then removed from the animal and given to the witches of the cult to drink, which caused them to trip out. The time sequence when the mutilations take place has a significance, according to the theory advanced by the officer. He said he believed the cattle were killed when the sun and moon were in a certain phase which could explain why so many are during a full moon, or that mutilations occur on a cult member's birthday or on certain days such as the spring equinox. The officer's theory is shared by a police officer in another Montana city. However, at the time of this writing, it is not more than theory. The cult theory was also advanced in a report the Cascade County officers received from a sheriff's office in California. The officer there reported that there had been mutilations in his area, but he did not know of any in which the blood was removed. However, he reported that a group of backpackers saw members of a cult sacrifice an animal. He said the cultists were wearing hoods and robes and were chanting. When law officers arrived later at the scene, all that they found was the remains of an animal which had been buried. There is a site in Montana, near Butte, which appears to be a location for ritualistic ceremonies. Law officers have learned that the place is referred to as "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the Montana site. Some authorities believe a cult occasionally holds ceremonies there during the full moon and the members of the cult are dressed in long robes. This is believed to be some kind of ceremonial site used by a cult or cults. It is located just south of Butte in the mountains. The area around the apparently natural pit is outlined with rocks of various sizes. Some of them have inscriptions on them which could be interpreted different ways. Photograph © 1976 by Cascade County Sheriff's Office. Several law officers have visited the site, which is a short distance south of Butte on U. S. Forrest Service land. The turnoff from the mountain road to the site is marked with a large stone with Nelo 5-15-29 painted on it in black. The site is about 75 yards up the mountain from the rock. A report by Captain Wolverton and Deputy Ken Anderson, who visited the site April 14, 1976, states: \"Approximately 75 yards up the mountain from the rock is a complete circle of rocks 61 feet in circumference (this is west of the Nelo rock). The rocks encircle what looks like a natural pit; it did not appear to have been dug out. The pit is 4 1/2 feet deep with a fire pit at the center. The fire pit was encircled with small rocks about 18 inches in diameter. There was no indication of a recent fire and when it was used, the fire was very small. Inside the encircled area are two Lodgepole pine trees, one on the right and one on the left. Each tree had a nail in it. If something was stretched between the two trees, it would be off center and be over the stone with ISIS printed on it. The stone with the inscription of ISIS favor us! Mother of moon lover of goodness , is resting on the roots of one of the trees. If one were standing in the center of the pit looking at the ISIS stone, one would be looking southeast and the stone faces northwest. By drawing a straight line from the ISIS stone to the northwest, the line would be in the center of the rock that is inscribed with YHWH . There does not appear to be any relationship between the stones that have writing on them and various rocks, selected at random, which have the painting on them. None of the rocks that made up the circle were very large, the biggest being roughly 10 inches across; the smallest being a handful of rocks to fill up any gaps.\" "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"This is the \"altar\" in the place near Butte commonly known as the Montana site. The stone, resting on the roots of the tree, is inscribed, \"ISIS favor us! Mother of moon lover of goodness.\" ISIS is Egyptian for mother of goodness , but it also stands for an ancient cult in Rome believed to have been involved in cattle mutilations. Photograph © 1976 by Cascade County Sheriff's Office. Reports by officers who had visited the site earlier indicated there was a coyote trap near the stone labeled ISIS, but it was not there when Captain Wolverton and Deputy Anderson visited the site. ISIS is believed to be the name of an ancient cult of Egypt, later worshiped in Greek and Roman empires, which had as its symbol a cow. The cult was said to have utilized mutilations in ancient times. ISIS was an Egyptian goddess of fertility. The word YHWH on the rock opposite the one labeled ISIS is believed to be a forbidden pronunciation of the word God. The numbers 5-15-29 is numerology standing for evil and Satan. A five-pointed star and a symbol similar to the Nazi swastika were found on some of the stones in a circle. The star, called a pentagram, is a symbol of the Devil, and the swastika is a symbol of a cult. Two stones bore the name Jesus. Another was labeled Ariel, which is one of the five satellites of the planet Uranus, which some believe has an evil influence. Another stone bore the inscription Jehova, which means female demon , but could also possibly be an abbreviation of the word Jehovah, meaning God. Several of the words had more than one translation and there are other interpretations that could be made of the site. One tube of black paint and a paint brush were found by one of the trees, but time and weather had eliminated any chance of getting fingerprints from them. While captain Wolverton and Deputy Anderson were there, a deputy from Butte and his trained dog searched the site and the immediate area around it, but found nothing. an interesting incident took place on Forest Service land in Blain County, Idaho, and may or may not have a connection with cattle mutilations. Two Forest Service men were placed on guard in a remote area to keep cattle from being illegally grazed on Forest Service land. Apparently one of the two men left to go into town and the other was standing guard from a secluded area where he could not be seen. As he was watching about about 5:45 p.m., he noticed two men dressed in body length black, hooded robes, walking about 50 yards from him. the taller of the two men was carrying a bag, but the guard could not determine if there was anything in it. Although there was a jeep trail about five yards from where the men were walking, they apparently preferred to stay among some willows as though to avoid detection. Their pointed hoods apparently had a partial opening, but they"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"did not turn their heads so that the guard could see their faces. When they reached a clearing, they hurried and gave the impression they did not want to be seen. They looked straight ahead and never turned their heads. One of the most unusual aspects of the incident was that cattle in the area became very quiet just before the strangely-garbed men appeared. The guard said he was expecting an elk to appear, but instead the two men appeared. He told authorities that he observed the men for approximately three minutes. Officers said no mutilated cattle were found at the time the two hooded men were seen, but they added that there had been numerous cattle mutilations reported in that county. An interesting theory was advanced by a young woman who was interviewed by authorities in Montana. She claims to know that some very rich people are behind the mutilations and that they pay less wealthy persons to do the mutilation for them. She said they often pay from $500 to $1,000 for the parts taken from the animals. Authorities have not proven or disproven her theory. At one time during the investigation, Captain Wolverton corresponded with a man in Arkansas who has done extensive research in the field of ESP (extra- sensory perception). He had earlier helped the Cascade County Sheriff's Department in connection with a homicide case, but at this particular time was writing to Captain Wolverton concerning any possible connection between cattle mutilations, UFOs and the occult. The man wrote that he had attended a conference on UFOs at which an investigator who was also a helicopter pilot stated that he believed the mutilations were the work of a fanatical religious cult equipped with helicopters and using special shoes which left no tracks. Commenting on this theory, the ESP expert wrote: \"While I have not put my mind on this mystery, I cannot conceive of anything one could put on the feet which would not show tracks of some kind. Without trying to be psychic for the moment, the fact that this mutilation of cattle has occurred in a number of other states suggests quite a well-organized group for cultists, if they are the cause. This (has) happened enough times to give farmers a chance to have caught them at it or to have sighted them.\" He asked the question that if helicopters are being used, how are they able to get in and out without being observed? Montana law officers have received numerous reports of unidentified helicopters in the area, including some that are all black with no markings. There have also been reports of people hearing helicopters fly over their homes at low altitude during the night, but these people were unable to see them. \"It would be some operation,\" the ESP man wrote, \"for a helicopter to hover a few feet above ground while some of the crew jumped out, did their mutilation of the cattle and then were hoisted aboard. That still does not explain no footprints or tire tracks being left behind. And what about dogs who may have been watching the cattle? What would they have been doing meanwhile? \"Indulging in fantastic speculation,\" he continued, \"space ships with their power to remain stationary in the air and occupants to float to earth, as has been reported, leaving no imprints, taking specimens of animal parts and blood for examination and so on could come closer at explanation. It would seem it would take unusual instrumentation and devices for instantly making the cattle immobile, to do such a job and get away with it, in an incredibly short length of time. But who can accept such a speculation?\" The man asked if the farm area was being policed at night and if the farmers themselves were concerned enough to set up watches. Captain Wolverton told him in his letter of reply that some ranchers had set up patrols, but nothing had"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"come of it. Law officers also patrol the rural areas, but so far they have not been able to catch the mutilators. The ESP researcher, who is himself a sensitive, described the ESP impressions he had received on the mutilations with these words: \"I feel that however it is being done there are bands of five - women as well as men - involved. I see them masked, wearing black or dark jumper-like, tight- fitting clothing. Sinister appearing, highly trained in their operations, each assigned certain duties ... armed with guns and instruments ... equipped with black cases or specially prepared bags for carrying the animal parts ... containers for blood ... they move in quickly, efficien tly and are away just as quickly. I get the feeling of air action ... what kind, I cannot 'see' ... but it seems silent ... they have somehow 'cased' the area and select time and place when they are almost certain of no detection.\" The man admitted that the things he had heard or read about cattle mutilations could have colored the impressions he received. But law officers wondered at the strange coincidence of the black outfits with the black-robed men in Idaho and the black helicopters seen over Montana. Yellow indicates the towns, counties and areas affected by animal mutilations, unidentified helicopters and mysterious aerial craft during 1974 to 1976. Twenty-seven years later, in 2001 to 2002, Pondera County and surrounding region experienced more than a dozen animal mutilations associated with unidentified lights and other high strangeness.
