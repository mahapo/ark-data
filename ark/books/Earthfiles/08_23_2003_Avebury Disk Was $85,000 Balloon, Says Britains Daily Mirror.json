Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Avebury Disk Was $85,000 \"Balloon,\" Says Britain's Daily Mirror © 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe In the August 23, 2003 edition of Britain's The Daily Mirror , reporter Nick Webster says the aerial disk that rotated and wobbled over Avebury on Saturday evening, August 16, 2003, was a 25-foot-diameter \"space craft\" that cost $85,000 (50,000 pounds) and was built by a TV firm called Chrysalis for a Channel 4 documentary entitled, \"How To Build A Spaceship.\" The Daily Mirror, August 23, 2003: \"Danny Cohen, of Channel 4, said: 'We were trying to see whether we could build a convincing looking spaceship and in that regard undoubtedly we succeeded. Dozens of people saw it and couldn't quite understand what they had seen. So I think it did work. It stayed quite high in the sky and looked harmless, so it frightened nobody. I think people were more bewildered by what they were seeing. People were left rubbing their heads, wondering what was going on.\" It took eight months to research, design and build the £50,000 aircraft. (Approximately $85,000.) Model flight specialists Cutting Edge Effects - veterans of four Bond films - built it using a carbon fibre hoop as the skeleton. This was set in a reflective-plastic balloon filled with helium. After a US military engine was ditched as too heavy, electric fan engines from Germany proved the key to making the 'saucer' fly at just the right speed - 20mph. It was tested in the aircraft hangar shown above at a secret location. The out-of-this-world con included using seven pilots to fly the aircraft by remote control for three miles.\" The Difficulties In Producing A Large, Round Dirigible That Can Rotate and Wobble In a telephone interview yesterday, I discussed the Avebury object with Richard Papa, designer and owner of Papa Pro, Ltd., in London. Mr. Papa has owned Papa Pro for three years and works with Canadian and other companies in the world to produce dirigible toys that can float in the air. One of the products he sells is an 8-foot-diameter disk, which is the largest model manufactured so far. He looked at the video frames of the aerial disk at Earthfiles.com and made these comments. Mr. Papa said, \"There is a product design team that I use to design our blimps. It's one of five product design companies in the U. K. that are quite big. We couldn't replicate that blimp in that photograph of that size. (Instead of eyewitness estimates of 40 feet, The Daily Mirror reports 25 feet.) The light system on that, anyone could copy. There is nothing special about "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"that. The idea that it was rotating while it was flying across the sky - remember it's helium based. It's an airship, which means the entire airship is lighter than air, OK? So, to fly something that is lighter than air around, it's very difficult, especially to make it rotate and wobble simultaneously as it flew. If there is any wind above 17 mph, it's even more difficult.\" Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
