Jim Penniston is not the only UFO experiencer who has linked UFOs to time travelers. That idea has also come from people in the human abduction syndrome who report missing time and encounters with non-humans. Is time travel past and future really possible? Fifteen years ago in 1994, a book called Hyperspace was released and quickly climbed The New York Times best seller list. The author was Michio Kaku, Ph.D., a City University of New York theoretical physicist who is one of the leading pioneers in quantum superstring theory. Prof. Kaku's subtitle explains the book's content: A Scientific Odyssey Through Parallel Universes, Time Warps and the Tenth Dimension. Michio Kaku was born sixty-two years ago in San Jose, California, and grew up in Palo Alto. His academic degrees include a Bachelors of Science degree from Harvard University in 1968, followed by a 1972 Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University of California-Berkeley, and post-doctoral work at Princeton University. Dr. Kaku is also a visiting professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where the genius Albert Einstein spent the last years of his life trying to develop a unified field theory for gravity, electromagnetic fields and strong and weak nuclear forces. But Einstein couldn't make all the pieces fit before he died in 1955. Then in 1970 to 1971, quantum string and superstring theories were born that "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"mathematically describe those cosmic forces as vibrations in a higher dimensional space of at least ten or eleven dimensions. Suddenly physicists such as Michio Kaku had field equations that fit together like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. In string theory, the Earth and matter universe are the lowest string vibration. Beyond are many other vibrations that could include the mysterious dark energy and dark matter that make up 95% of our universe. In fact, if the Large Hadron Collider at CERN near Geneva, Switzerla nd, ever starts spinning and colliding protons, dark matter might be created for cosmologists to study. Superstring theory also describes small black holes, or “transversible worm holes,” that could be used to travel backwards or forwards in time through hyperspace. The theory is that our universe is connected to other universes through wormholes, and all of the universes are found within hyperspace. E arth to the star system Sirius is 54 trillion miles, or 8.6 years traveling at the speed of light (8.6 light-years). But a wormhole through hyperspace between Earth and Sirius would dramatically shorten travel forwards or backwards in time. Source: HowStuffWorks.com. Time travel also came up as the source of global crop formations back in 1993. I was in Wiltshire County, England, to explore the crop circle mystery at a time when the strange patterns in cereal crops had been reported in some 23 countries in both hemispheres of the world. There were even TV news reports about the crop patterns on ABC network’s 20/20, CBS’s 60 Minutes and headlines in newspapers and magazines. I met a man who told me he had firsthand information that the CIA was trying to photograph from sate llites every crop formation in chr onological sequence so computers could look for mathematical patterns that might be decoded. Then he startled me by explaining that the agency’s current theory is that we are dealing with time travelers and the crop formations have something to do with gauging the effectiveness of their efforts to manipulate Earth’s timeline. But exactly why time travelers would be doing this, no one understood. Recently I asked Prof. Kaku if he thought it possible that some UFOs and worldwide crop formations could be time travelers interacting with Earth for reasons unknown?

Michio Kaku, Ph.D., Prof. of Theoretical Physics, City University of New York, New York City, New York and author of Hyperspace © 1994, Physics of the Impossible © 2008 and several other books and text books: “In the last several years, there has been a sea change in the world of physics concerning time travel. Stephen Hawking, my colleague, used to publicly say that time travel was impossible because where are the tourists from the future? Since there were no tourists taking pictures of him from the future, he said that time travel was impossible. Well, he changed his mind. He now says that time travel is possible. In theory, it might in fact be possible and consistent with the laws of physics. Einstein himself had reservations about time travel. His office mate at Princeton, Kurt Goedel, one of the greatest mathematicians of the last thousand years, in fact, found solutions of Einstein’s equations, which do allow for time travel. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PATTERNS THAT HAVE BEEN IN HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF CROP FORMATIONS OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IN THE MODERN ERA OF CROP FORMATIONS, I’M SURE YOU’VE STUDIED SOME, LOOKED AT SOME OF THE PHOTOS? “J ulia Set” discovered in a wheat field across the road from Stonehenge in England on July 8, 1996. The spiral measured 915 feet on its longest axis, covered a square acre and consisted of 149 circles. The center of each circle was twisted differently. Aerial photograph © 1996 by Lucy Pringle. Yes, but it’s hard to make a definitive statement one way or the other about time travelers"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"making crop formations because it all depends on how an advanced civilization would harness this time travel technology, if it’s possible at all, and what the time travel machine would look like. In my book, Parallel Worlds, I even give you a rough sketch as to what such a time travel machine would look like. However, other proposals have been made and all of them seem to be consistent with Einstein’s equations and quantum theory. IF AN ADVANCED INTELLIGENCE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT’S BEHIND THE CROP FORMATION PHENOMENON, WHAT MIGHT IT BE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IN THE CEREAL CROPS AND GRASSES IN THESE LARGE – LET’S CALL THEM ORGANIC SKINS OF THE EARTH - IN RELATIONSHIP TO TIME TRAVEL? Well, look at it from their point of view, rather than our point of view. From their point of view, they would be centuries – or more likely millennia – ahead of us in energy. They would be able to manipulate, for example, stars and manipulate even the fabric of space and time. And then, they they would have a choice. There are actually several solutions of Einstein’s equations that allow for travel to the past and future through time and travel through space. One of them is the worm hole. It is the looking glass of Alice In Wonderland . It would even look like a looking glass. It would be basically a spinning ring – a ring of neutrons spinning very rapidly, such that if you put your hand through the ring, you are not destroyed by infinite gravity, which is what we used to think. If the ring spins rapidly enough, a gate way opens and like a star gate, you can go actually back and forth between two separate universes. IF THERE IS A VERY ADVANCED CIVILIZATION THAT MIGHT BE DOING TIME TRAVEL BACK INTO OUR MODERN TIME AND THE CROP FORMATIONS MIGHT BE RELATED TO SOME EXPERIMENTATION OR TEST THEY ARE DOING, IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ALL OR MOST OF THE TRULY MYSTERIOUS UFO PHENOMENA COULD BE VERY INTELLIGENT MACHINES DESIGNED TO GO THROUGH, LET’S SAY A TRANSVERSIBLE WORM HOLE, AND TO DO MONITORING AND TO COLLECT INFORMATIOIN FROM HERE FOR SOME POINT IN TIME OR A PARALLEL UNIVERSE? The most efficient way for a very advanced civilization to colonize the galaxy is NOT to send Captain Kirk on the Starship Enterprise. In fact, that’s perhaps the stupidest way to explore the universe because there are simply too many stars and there are too many planets in the galaxy. There are about 200 b illion stars in the Milky Way Gala xy. Perhaps half of them have planets and so you begin to realize that the most mathematically efficient way is to send out what are called von Neumann self-replicating probes. [ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “A von Neumann probe is a self-replicating spacecraft designed to investigate its target system and transmit information about it back to its system of origin. The concept is named after Hungarian- American mathematician and physicist John von Neumann, who rigorously studied the concept of self-replicating machines that he called ‘Universal Assemblers’ and which are often referred to as ‘von Neumann machines.’ While von Neumann never applied his work to the idea of spacecraft, theoreticians since then have. If a self-replicating probe finds evidence of pr imitive life (or a primitive, low level culture) it might be programmed to lie dormant, silently observe, attempt to make contact (known as a Bracewell probe), or even interfere with or guide the evolution of life in some way. Physicist Paul Davies of the University of Adelaide has even raised the possibility of a probe resting on our own m oon, having arrived at some point in Earth's ancient prehistory and remained to monitor Earth. ] The most efficient way to look at the colonization of a galaxy is to send a robotic probe to"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the moon. The moon is quite stable. It has plenty of soil. No erosion or rust to worry about. And the probe makes copies of itself – millions of copies of itself. That’s what it does. It lands on the moon and makes copies of itself, which then fly out to other distant star systems, land on their moon and make copies. So, starting with one probe, you get a million. Now, what will they do once they land on the m oon? They would basically put an alarm clock there and wait – wait for civilizations to develop. So, if you think of the movie 2001 (Stanley Kubrick), that’s the outline of that movie. On the moon perhaps there is the greatest likelihood of a base of some sort – a self-replicating probe that has landed on the moon, made copies of itself, which then fly out to visit other moons. If you saw the movie carefully, there is even a scene where you see thousands, millions of these things ar ound Jupiter. So, they would basically be a watch station looking for evidence of inte lligent life. WHY WOULDN’T SELF-REPLICATING MACHINES GO TO THE PLANETS THEMSELVES? WHY WOULD THEY STOP AT THE MOONS? They wouldn’t. They could periodically send probes on to the distant planets, which have inhabitants on them. This way, they wouldn’t have to have large quantities of fuel. They could simply go back to their base on the moon. Realize that the movie 2001 was supposed to take place in 2001. (laughs) But it w ill take us about a hundred years to 2100 until we even have a functional moon base like they have in the movie capable of detecting such a thing. So, the irony is that we could be being observed every second of the day and yet we’re too pr imitive to know it. YOU BROUGHT UP A VERY IMP ORTANT P OINT IN PHYSICS OF THE IMPOSSIBLE (© 2008) ABOUT THE OBSERVATIONS OF SO MANY EYEWITNESSES IN THE SO-CALLED UFO PHENOMENON THAT ARE SILENT AND THAT THEY MIGHT BE OPERATING ON A MAGNETIC PROPULSION SYSTEM, WHICH IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH EYEWITNESS OBSERVATIONS THAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT SOMETHING THAT IS SPINNING VERY RAPIDLY. WHAT HAS BEEN OBSERVED FOR CENTURIES – RINGS, AS EZEKIEL DESCRIBED RINGS WITHIN RINGS – RELATES TO USING MAGNETIC FIELDS IN A WAY WE DON’T UNDERSTAND, BUT COULD BE USED AS CRAFT IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF PLANETS AND MOONS. The criticism that physicists usually have of flying saucers is first of all, they zigzag. They have no exhaust and so forth and that they are simply too small. How can you contain all that rocket fuel to go across the galaxy? My point of view about UFOs is that if they have a robotic base on the moon, which is the most mathematically logical way to explore the galaxy, and probes are sent from the moon periodically to explore other star systems even beyond our own, then it’s natural for them to want to explore us. In fact, that’s the whole point. The whole point of self-replicating von Neumann probes is to see what kinds of life forms are out there. If you take a look at energy consumption, when we’ve scanned the heavens for inte lligent life, we don’t look for little green men. We look for Type I, Type II and Type III civilizations. A Type I civilization a bout a hundred years more advanced than us has harnessed planetary power. They can control the weather. They have cities on the ocean. Anything planetary like volcanoes and earthquakes, they can influence because they harness the entire energy of a planet. Then we have Type II, the world of Star Trek. The federation of planets can barely ignite stars. They’ve only colonized a tiny fraction of the Milky Way Galaxy. That would be a Type II civilizati on, a civilization that harnesses stellar power. They can control stars. They can play with stars, move them around, ignite them, just like in the TV series. Then we have Type III. A Type III civ ilization is galactic. They span not just a few star systems. They span the entire galaxy itself and they use black holes as their energy supply. Type III would have 10 bi llion times the power of a Type II civilization, which in turn"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"would have about 10 b illion times the energy of a Type I civilization. Then there is the possibility of Type IV that would be extra-galactic. They would be able to go between galaxies. Actually on Star Trek, there is a candidate for a Type IV civilization and this is the Q, the Q Continuum. [ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “In the fictional TV Star Trek universe, the Q Continuum is an extradimensional plane of existence inhabited by a race of extremely powerful, hyper-inte lligent beings known as the Q. They claim to be largely indifferent to the affairs of the non-Q beings living in normal space, or in the many dimensions parallel to their own, considering them to be insignificant and childlike, though sometimes amusing as only children can be. However, they are clearly very interested in human beings in particular, subjecting the human race to various tests. These tests often imply that they feel somewhat threatened by humanity's potential, but are intrigued by it as well. The Q have the ability to warp reality at a whim, ranging from appearing in any place they choose to rearranging the cosmos themselves. ] Now, what are we on this scale? We are Type 0. We don’t even rate on this scale. We get our energy not from stars, not from galaxies, not from volcanoes. We get our energy from dead plants – oil and coal – and we’re running out of those! But we are about a hundred years away from becoming Type I. For example, the internet is the beginning of a Type I telephone system. So, we see evidence of the origins of a Type I civ ilization on Earth. Now for these civilizations that can roam the galactic space lanes – basically star faring civilizations – they would probably be Type III, which would put them about 50 to 100 thousand years more advanced than us It seems to me that if you used nanotechnology – that is, the technology of individual atoms – these spaceships don’t have to be that big. Most physicists have several criticisms of UFOs. One is that they are too small. How can you pack enough energy to go across stars? Stars are so distant, it would take millennia to go between different star systems. So, that’s why some physicists dismiss the phenomenon. However, once you’re talking about a civilization a few t housand years more advanced than us, then new energies, new physics, new technologies come into play. We’re Type 0, but we’re very close to becoming Type I. And if I were an alien putting such a device on the moon, I would want to have an alarm clock that signals the transition from Type 0 to Type I. A Type 0 civilization is probably very ordinary. There are probably a lot of Type 0 civilizations – they are probably a dime a dozen in the galaxy and most of them self-destruct. Most of them blow themselves apart with the savagery of their ancient past. Type I, however, is much more interesting – peaceful, planetary science and culture. Therefore, if you watch the movie 2001 very carefully, there’s a scene where they touch the probe, the probe then sends a signal back to the home relay station on Jupiter signaling that they have attained Type I status. Now, why wasn’t this explained to you when you saw the movie? Well, Kubrick actually interviewed quite a few astrophysicists at the beginning of the movie who laid out this entire scenario that the moon is the most logical place for a visitation, they would send out self-replicating von Neumann probes and they would wait until we became a planetary civilizati on. However, Kubrick at the last minute cut the first ten minutes of his own film so the film became super mystical. But actually, if you watch it again, it’s perhaps the most logical, mathematically consistent way to explore the galaxy and to encounter inte lligent life in outer space. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THE HADRON COLLIDER NEAR GENEVA IS HAVING SO MANY ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS AND MAGNET PROBLEMS? I think they rushed it. Last year when they were about to turn on the Large Hadron Collider, they don’t like to admit it, but it was obviously human error. I’ve talked with several of the people there and they privately say that it was because they were rushing it. And that’s why there was a break that led to the spilling of many tons of liquid helium, I think it was, on to the floor and it was so cold down there that workers would freeze to death. So they had to wait many weeks for the temperature to rise. Then they hit Christmas. At Christmas time, they had to shut down the machine because the machine uses so much electricity that the people of Geneva would not have a Christmas! So, for all these reasons – it’s a very complicated machine and I think they rushed it. MOST RECENTLY, I RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM THE HADRON PRESS OFFICE THAT RIGHT NOW, IT IS AN INDETERMINATE TIME INTO THE FUTURE BEFORE THEY EVEN KNOW WHEN THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO TEST IT AGAIN. Yeah, it’s kind of unfortunate. First, they said June, then fall in September. Then for a long time, they were saying October. Then the last I heard was November. RIGHT. WHAT DO YOU THINK AS A PHYSICIST ABOUT ALL OF THE WARNINGS THAT TURNING ON HADRON MIGHT CREATE MINI-BLACK HOLES THAT"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"COULD DESTROY PARTS, OR ALL, OF THE EARTH? First of all, they weren’t physicists – they were lay people who launched a lawsuit and they filed it in Hawaii in the Federal District Court there. The court there, however, ruled that this was out of their province because we’re talking about a European machine and not an American machine. So, that’s why the lawsuit was thrown out. WHY COULDN’T PROTONS ACCELERATED TO NEAR THE SPEED OF LIGHT, GOING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS AND COLLIDING, CREATE MINI-BLACK HOLES? First of all, the theory says that no black holes will be created at all. Zero! However, there is a rather, I think, odd ball offshoot of string theory. String theory is what I do for a living. We think string theory is the theory of everything. There is an offshoot of string theory that says maybe we can create a black hole. We physicists, first of all, think that offshoot of string theory is probably wrong, but if it’s right and mini-black holes are created, they disappear. Second of all, the Earth is bathed in cosmic rays – much more energetic than anything that can be created by the large collider. The Large Hadron Collider is colossal in human terms, but Mother Nature thinks it’s puny. It’s a pea shooter compared to what Mother Nature does. Mother Nature slams black holes together! And these black holes create huge cosmic explosions seen across the universe. THE GAMMA BURSTS? The gamma ray bursts, right. And they hit the Earth with energy much greater than anything we get from slamming puny protons together. On a human scale, if you visit the machine, it looks really big. So that’s why humans get afraid of it. But if you take a look at what Mother Nature does – you know, forget protons! – Mother Nature slams black holes together.

Da rk ma t t e r c o mpris e s 23% of the universe. This matter, different from atoms, does not emit or absorb light. It has only been detected indirectly by its gravity. 72% of the universe, is composed of “dark energy,” that acts as a sort of an anti-gravity. This dark energy, distinct from dark matter, is responsible for the present-day acceleration of the universal expansion. WMAP data is accurate to two digits, so the total of these numbers is not 100%. This reflects the current limits of WMAP's ability to define Dark Matter and Dark Energy. Credit: NASA / WMAP Science Team. DO YOU THINK WE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET THE HADRON COLLIDER GOING? AND ULTIMATELY, DO YOU THINK IT COULD GET US TO UNDERSTANDING WHAT DARK MATTTER AND DARK ENERGY ARE? That’s the hope. The hope is that we’ll create something called ‘sparticles.’ [ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “In particle physics, a superpartner (also sparticle) is a hypothetical elementary particle. The word superpartner is a combination of the words supersymmetry and partner, while sparticle is a combination of supersymmetry and particle . Supersymmetry is one of the cutting-edge theories in current high-energy physics, which predicts the existence of these ‘shadow’ particles. However, if this theory is correct, it should be possible to recreate these particles in high-energy particle accelerators. Doing so will not be an easy task; these particles may have masses up to a thousand times greater than their corresponding \"real\" particles. Until recently, colliders did not have the power to create these supermassive particles, but the newly built Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"CERN near Geneva, Switzerland, w ill be able to achieve collisions in the 14 TeV (tera-electron-volt) range, which is more than adequate to determine if these superpartner particles exist. ] Sparticles are super particles. They represent the next vibration of the string. If we find sparticles, that will go a long way toward verifying that this is in act the Theory of Everything, the theory that alluded Einstein. WHAT DO YOU THINK DARK ENERGY AND DARK MATTER ARE? We think dark matter is a sparticle and we hope to create it with the Large Hadron Collider. And that is the next musical note. Everything you see around you – the protons, neutrons, electrons, neutrinos – everything you see around you is nothing but the lowest note on a vibrating string. So, if Einstein had never been born and we never had all these atom smashers, we would have discovered it anyway because all of this is nothing but the lowest note of a vibrating string. But there is the higher note – in fact, an infinite number of notes. The next higher note is consistent with dark matter. It’s invisible and it has gravity. That’s exactly what dark matter is. So, we think the Large Hadron Collider will create dark matter, which we think is the sparticle, which is another missing piece of the string. WHAT ABOUT DARK ENERGY? Dark energy is a little bit harder to get. Dark energy is the energy of nothing. String theory is a quantum theory. Therefore, it has dark energy in it. But we have to be able to calculate exactly how much dark energy there is and that requires assumptions. That’s why we get a little bit hesitant to say that string theory can definitively say what dark energy is. IF THIS MATTER WORLD THAT WE’RE IN IS THE LOWEST VIBRATING STRING, AND THE NEXT ONE UP IS DARK MATTER, WOULD DARK ENERGY BE A VIBRATING STRING OF A NOTE OR NOT? It would be quantum fluctuations to the string. The string is made out of matter, but it moves in space. And it makes space curl up exactly as Einstein predicted. So, if Einstein had never been born, we would have gotten the entire theory from these tiny, vibrating strings in hyperspace. So, dark energy automatically comes out of the theory because it is a quantum theory and dark energy is a quantum effect. The problem is that we can’t calculate it. My personal attitude is that we physicists on the Earth are not smart enough to solve the theory.” eturn to Part 1 ontinued in Part 7 - Implications from UFO Historian Richard Dolan More Information: M ichio Kaku Books: Beyond Einstein © 1987; Hyperspace © 1994; Visions © 1999; Einstein's Cosmos © 2004; Parallel Worlds © 2004; Physics of the Impossible © 2008. or further information about the worldwide crop formations and UFO phenomena, please see Earthfiles Archive (partial list below) and my books, An Alien Harvest, the 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities, and Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles in the Earthfiles Shop.
