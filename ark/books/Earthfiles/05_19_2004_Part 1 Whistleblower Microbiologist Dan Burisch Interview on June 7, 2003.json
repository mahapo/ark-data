May 19, 2004 Las Vegas, Nevada - Since September 2002, computer analyst and UFO phenomenon investigator, B ill Hamilt on, has talked to me about the frustrations of microbiologist Dan Burisch, Ph.D. Dr. Burisch has been working in a U. S. government \"black project\" for several years, has wanted out and has finally negotiated an agreement to officially retire on June 8, 2004. As a whistleblower, he first approached B ill in 2002 after Dan Burisch learned about the work Bill Hamilton had done with another whistleblower, Bill Uhouse. Both Dr. Burisch and Mr. Uhouse describe working with an entity known as "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"\"J-Rod\" at Area 51, Ne llis AFB, Nevada, and reporting to a select insider gr oup called \"Majestic-12.\" (Top Secret MAJIC) \"J-Rod\" in human shirt, drawn by Bill Uhouse, Engineer, based on his firsthand experience at Area 51, Nellis AFB. Dan Burisch was told there was a serious medical problem with the J-Rod and MJ-12 wanted Dr. Burisch to extract tissue from the being's arm for microscopic study. Dr. Burisch learned that J-Rod had a nerve degeneration disease that caused skeletal and muscle weakness and loss of body heat. \"J-Rod\" agitated during extraction of tissue from its arm at beginning of medical research in 1986 by microbiologist Dan Burisch under orders from Majestic-12 superiors. Drawing © 2003 by Dan Burisch, Ph.D. Bill was given permission by Dr. Burisch to interview him on-the-record in two videotape recordings about Burisch's work with the J-Rod entity and Dan's concern about the future of this planet. The first videotape transcript of September 15, 2002, was released at Earthfiles.com in a 3-part report. Now here is a second interview with Dan Burisch videotaped on June 7, 2003, in Las Vegas, Nevada. There were five others present with cameras who first submitted questions through Bill Hamilton. Interview: June 7, 2003 Transcript of Dan Burisch, Ph.D., Interview Videotaped in Las Vegas, Nevada Preliminary comment before formal interview began. Dan Burisch: \"As I was saying to Bill (Hamilton) on the way over here, I was ordered to present a copy of my order to meet him at St. Marks Square. That order contains an initial of a Committee member. From what I understand, there is currently a 17/16 split (about whether to disclose the truth about other intelligences interacting with Earth). This is mostly rumor ar ound the (inte lligence) community for a public acclimation program having to do with Majestic 12 and the overseeing committee, the old 54/12, which is now called the Committee of the Majority, as far as I'm told. \"The lights are cumbersome. My eyes are nice and red looking through the (micro) scope"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"from last night, so they can't get much worse.\" Dan B. Burisch, Ph.D., Microbiologist IV, formerly Nevada Test Site/Area 50 Sector 2/ Area 51 Sectors 3 and 4, Las Vegas, Nevada: BILL HAMILTON: \"The first question, Dan, they want to know is where did you work in the mid 1990s and how did you come to be employed there? Dan Burisch: Well, several locations in the mid-1990s. I had some cover positions here in Las Vegas, which made me look like a good old-fashioned Joe. In fact, I have had some police experience in the late 1980s. You are probably centering your question around my work for the (U. S.) government. In 1986, I was approached while working as an undergraduate student in a parasitology laboratory, to be exact. I was looking through a microscope at the time. Three gentlemen walked into the laboratory, closed the door behind them. There were two uniforms and a suit that were present. Both of the uniforms I would make as both probably being United States Navy. My memory of that one event is sort of hazy after seeing all those suits and uniforms and what not. We spoke for awhile. They asked if I were interested in seeing the world and the like. I told them that I in fact was. We went through several interview processes, not unlike this (interview where Dan sits in front of people asking questions) and reviewed my background. I went through several background investigations. Finally, starting in the 1990 to 1991 time frame, I was cleared for working Groom well, past Groom to the Papoose Mountain facility - a place that 'doesn't exist' about 90 miles north of here, the 'nowhere' place. That's how I came to work there. My original assignment was at the Groom Lake facility to review histopathology slides and I went through nearly a year's testing and then was basically let loose for a year and I heard no contact from them. After that, I was brought back in and shown some higher grade slides of unknown origin. Following that, I was introduced into a Working Group and subsequently brought into the Papoose Mountain facility, the Site-4 facility. We worked for well over a year on slides of unknown origin. After I took a minimum leadership position under several of the other biologists who were already present, most of which are now deceased you know the names of those individuals I was then introduced into the Level 4/5 fac ility and the 4/5 coded for 9, you are aware. (The number 9 is allegedly highly significant to the J-Rod entities.) So, what we did was introduce the new members, myself among them, into the Clean Sphere area and we were eventually shown the subject from which we were examining the slides. The slides were unusual in that they were of pressurized cells and they were reviewed by us on a conveyor (belt) with a completely automatic microscope. We were not touching anything. We gave verbal commands. At the second instance, we were finally allowed to have a proscan-like touchscreen keyboard that had a separate ergonomic joystick to examine the slides and then to working with the J-Rod itself in the 'Ambassadorial Suite' of the 'Clean Sphere Suite.' NOW WAS THIS UNDER THE PROJECT AQUARIUS? Yes. Initially I was assigned as a working member of Project Aquarius. Then finally, I was made an Assistant Working Group Leader. And then mysteriously, after one meeting with the J-Rod, I was asked to take the Working Group Leader position. I didn't find out why I was picked to be the Working Group Leader position until well, within this last year (2003). I never understood it because Steven (senior) was older than I and senior not only in ability, but in age. I never figured I would be advanced above an individual like that in a ranking with the Working Group. In fact, I never considered myself above him. We worked together. The Q-94 document that you have in your possession was co-authored. My name went on there as the primary"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"investigator because I was the Working Group Leader. But in fact, he and I were both involved in the authoring of that document. Solar System Bases for J-Rods COULD YOU EXPLAIN BRIEFLY WHAT YOU WERE BRIEFED ON ABOUT WHO AND/OR WHAT J-ROD WAS? Initially, I was briefed that J-Rod was an alien, specifically from the (Zeta) Reticuli 1 and 2 (binary) system, specifically from Reticulum 4 (fourth planet from one of the suns). I had no idea of the truth. But it was said from Reticulum 4 now (current time). But I had no idea of the truth about how this came to be.\" Sixteen stars, including our Sun, are all similar class G which could support life. Our sun is at the edge of the group with 82 Eridani, Gliese 86 and Zeta Reticuli (binary) near the central region. The arrows indicate the distance in light years between suns. The numbers in parentheses indicate distance from our sun. Map from Astronomy, December 1974. Binary star system 39.41 light years from Earth: Zeta Reticuli 1 (G 3/5 V Spectral Type) and Zeta Reticuli 2 (G2 V Spectral Type). Photograph courtesy NASA. \"As I said to you before, I had never met an 'alien,' but I have met an extraterrestrial. I found out subsequent to interactions with the J-Rod. They had personal names. J-Rod simply means '15.' That is a 'basing name' of where they are located, the number of light years from our location (on Earth). So, they took those names and they are identified through the (Project) Sigma protocols, the linguistic protocols, with a rod symbol which was an inertia symbol and the letter 'J.' In fact, that was a combination of Mayan and Egyptian numerology having to do with a rod and a J meaning 5 + 10 = 15."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" FIFTEEN LIGHT YEARS AWAY YOU SAID THAT IS THE PLANET, GLEISE 876 c? Yes, Gleise 876-c is what I've been told. Now he (J-Rod) did not specifically tell me the location, but the number 15 was mentioned (distance to sun, Gleise 876). Gliese 876 is the bright star at the center of the Digitized Sky Survey photograph. Gliese 876 is a dim red dwarf not visible to the human eye with two planets known so far: Gliese 876 b and Gliese 876 c, a gas giant about half the size of Jupiter. Gliese 876 is 15.2 light years from our sun and located in the southeastern part of the Constellation Aquarius. Editor's Note: Fifteen light years from Earth, the star Gliese 876 is smaller than our Sun, only about 1/3 as massive, and too faint to be seen without a telescope. Astronomers have discovered two planets there, Gliese 876 b and Gliese 876 c. Like many recent discoveries, this planets' detections are not based on direct imaging, but on spectroscopic measurements of the periodic change in motion - or \"Doppler wobble\" - produced in the parent star as the planets orbit. Gliese 876 c is a gas giant planet with a mass about half that of Jupiter. It is not understood how a gaseous planet could be a base for J-Rods. 1963 Kingman, Arizona UFO Crash - J-Rod? HOW DID J-ROD GET HERE? FROM FIFTEEN LIGHT YEARS AWAY? He crashed in (date remembered as either 1953 or 1963), from what I understand outside of Kingman, Arizona. There was a problem involving his physiology and his biophysiological communication. Something in the craft went wrong and, of course, he (J-Rod) is ill, as we know. The (neuropathy) problems and he crashed. HOW WAS HE WAS HE TRANSPORTED IMMEDIATELY FROM THAT CRASH SITE TO THE S-4 FACILITY? That I don't know. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW HE CAME TO BE AT THE FACILITY? I believe he and associates were transferred separately, he originally to the Groom Lake facility and an associate to, I believe, Los Alamos. I have no independent verification of where the associate went, though. Medical Procedures with J-Rod at S-4 Lab, Area 51, Nellis AFB, Nevada YOU INTERACTED WITH J-ROD. WAS THERE A GENERAL PROCEDURE FOR THIS INTERACTION?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Yes, there was a very specific procedure. After we would be brought in with our helper biologists there were control and helper biologists in the gallery and the introduction specialists which was myself on a number of occasions. We entered the Clean Sphere through a large series of protocols involving pressurization and compartmentalization until finally we were pressurized and fully encapsulated in a TES (totally encapsulated suit) to enter the Clean Sphere. Once we were pressurized and entered into the Clean Sphere I should digress. We had medical evaluation and all of that first. But they ceased doing that after a couple of medical evaluations and were more interested in 'Let's just get you in and get the work done.' I would enter into the Clean Sphere and I was not supposed to communicate with the J-Rod at all. I was not supposed to know his name. The reality is that we were communicating from the time that I entered into the 'Ambassadorial Suite' external to the Clean Sphere, talking back and forth freely. I could hear whatever he was projecting at me from thought (telepathy) and he could clearly hear what I was thinking. I say, 'hear' and I mean perceive (telepathically). I was supposed to stand over by a holographic projection system which was run like a teleprompter system over to my right that would be run inside of the Clean Sphere glass, hold my hand up and make certain signs. It became a joke. It really did become a joke. Those folks who were watching from the gallery and running the show thought that I was standing there and mimicking the signs and this was the only communication underway. They perceived on the day of the close approach that J-Rod made to me the grabbing incident they perceived there was communication that occurred. So, I began getting questions quite extensively about whether or not he was in fact communicating with me because he had promised not to and apparently (to stick to the) signaling unit. Doctrine for Convergent Time Line Paradox (DCTP) I alluded to the fact that there were conversations underway. But I didn't talk about what it was until, of course, I was caught in my research protocol forwarding ideas that were somewhat different than what they expected, where they expected my private research was going to go. And this was much later. This is much later and at the time, the deal was brokered to find out about the Doctrine for Convergent Time Line Paradox (DCTP). I told them a little bit about what he showed me (telepathically) and they told me a little bit about the DCIP. NOW THAT YOU'VE BROUGHT THAT UP WHICH IMPLIES TRAVEL THROUGH TIME AS WELL AS SPACE AND YOU SAID THAT J-ROD WAS RETRIEVED FROM A CRASH NEAR KINGMAN, ARIZONA WAS HE AT THAT TIME (IN 1963) TRAVELING THROUGH SPACE FROM A STAGING AREA OR? Ye s . HE WASN'T DOING ANY TIME TRAVELING AT THAT POINT? No, not as far as I'm aware, or as far as he told me. Physical Features of J-Rod COULD YOU DESCRIBE J-ROD TO US WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE AND HOW HE BEHAVED? Yes, the 'gentleman' with which I was associated was approximately 3.5 feet tall. He had a dark brown appearance to his skin. He was in a highly pressurized Clean"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Sphere. He exuded glycoprotein-like material from the pores on his skin, which was associated with the neuropathy that we were studying. DID THIS HAVE AN ODOR TO IT? I don't know. I couldn't perceive any odors whatsoever. I was inside my (space) suit. I would imagine there would be, but there was nothing that I read that indicated there was an odor. Why? You've asked that before. That's why I'm wondering. I HEARD ABOUT THIS SECRETION COMING THROUGH THE PORES OF THE SKIN BEFORE AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO HAVE HAD ENCOUNTERS WHO SAY THEY CAN SMELL AN ODOR FROM THE SKIN. All right. Where were we? YOU WERE DESCRIBING J-ROD. OK, 3.5 feet. Large head in comparison to its torso, so the ratio of the cranium to the torso area would be larger than what we would call a modern human being. Large bulbous black eyes the whites of the eyes had been selected out, so it looked like one large pupil, basically. When you look into his eyes, you feel like you are going to fall into his eyes forever. I think that had something to do with the telepathic nature of his mental structure. Large arms in length. Four, very sinuous fingers. Nails, not as long as presented in some of the images you showed me in the past, the ones done by Tom Mack, was it? BILL U-HOUSE. That's right, the 'puppet master' photos. I'm s miling because ' puppet master' leads me to something else. But he (J-Rod) was hunched over most of the time and could not support himself fully, given the muscular atrophy. It had to do with the peripheral neuropathy he was suffering. So, he would grunt and move toward me almost in a flopping fashion. Feet were large in comparison to what our feet would be. HOW MANY TOES? Four. He was unclothed, which bothered him. He wanted to wear clothing and was refused at every turn. He called himself 'captive,' and justifiably so. His feet were unusual in that he had a very large knob underneath what we would call a heel. His facial features were grotesque in comparison to what he showed me (telepathically) what normal would be. He was... NORMAL OF HIS TYPE? Yes. He was bilaterally symmetrical to the extent that the disease process was not changing his facial features. The nose was recessed not a nose like we have, but basically two orifices. An extremely small mouth. A hard palate, no teeth. His musculature was suffering from the problem with the neuropathy. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT HIS CHRONOLOGICAL AGE WAS? Between 240 and 260 years old. DO THE J-RODS EXCRETE WASTE FROM FOOD? They (J-Rods) excrete in the manner that we would excrete. Their external genitalia are different than ours. The females have something like a vulva, but they have a clasper situation. The male has a male clasper. The females have female claspers."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The end looks like a disk with rectangular solids that are rotated into position for clasping at the anal (?) region. They do have internal fertilization. Telepathic Holographic Communication THIS WAS SOMETHING YOU READ? YOU DIDN'T SEE THIS PROCESS DID YOU? No, this was something he showed me (telepathically) of his wife. HOW WAS THAT IMAGE PRESENTED TO YOU? DID IT APPEAR...? I was inside the image. That's what it felt like. VIRTUAL REALITY? Yes. Everything that he showed me this was the incident (when J-Rod grabbed Dan). What he projected into me, it felt like I was there, like sensations were heightened. Quite extraordinary. WAS A BACKGROUND PERCEIVED? WAS SHE IN A DOMICILE OF SOME SORT? A grey surrounding very dull, drab surrounding almost like a concrete evacuation center. You know evacuation zones beneath hotels in case of mass casualties or mass disaster where it's a very clinical environment. WERE YOU IMPRESSED THAT HE WAS KIND OF DEPRESSED BY HIS SITUATION? Certainly depressed. If we were to term him (J-Rod) human, I would I'm not a psychologist but I think he would be termed clinically depressed. He wept, but he did not weep on the outside. He wept on the inside when he was with me. COULD YOU ESTIMATE WHAT HIS LEVEL OF INTELLECT WAS? Smarter than me. Smarter than me by a long range. The Rule of Nines DID HE HAVE A WIDE RANGE OF KNOWLEDGE? The mathematics that he showed me blew my mind! He showed me concurrently not only the equations for the Rule of Nines, but he also did so diagrammatically and he did so with 3-dimensional where I was watching cubes come together. So if I were not understanding, apparently not understanding the script, I would understand it as a child learns Group Theory in mathematics. A highly evolved, highly intellectual, highly repressed emotionally. When I was with him. I felt great happiness to be with him, but I could feel his great sadness not only because of what he wanted to become (which was) what he knew he was by being present with us. But, what WHERE he was and how he was being treated. (captive) He is not part of the group that has to be catered to involving the T-9 Treaty that was just signed. He wanted to help. He was willing. But I went in for God's sake! I took well over well, nearly 300 individualized aspiration samples from his neurological system. He would hold his arm out for me. There was no pain medication. And whenever I would fire the introduction system (into his arm) to remove the sample technically it was an aspirative avulsion system he would cry and then he would just stand there and look at me."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" THERE WAS A SUCTION? Yes, in fact, I would bring the sample after the initial removal from his tissues into the induction system and then approve it and move it from there to one of the helper biologists. Usually it was Robert, outside of the Clean Sphere. Robert would move it from there to be handled by other normal protocols. He (J-Rod) would just stand there and take it. DO YOU FEEL THE COMMUNICATION THAT HE ESTABLISHED WITH YOU WHEN YOU WERE IN CONTACT WITH HIM, COULD HE EXTEND THAT (TELEPATHIC AND HOLOGRAPHIC) COMMUNICATION OVER ANY DISTANCE? Sixty feet. Definitely sixty feet from the center of the Clean Sphere to the introduction ramp that goes down into the Ambassadorial Suite. So, at least sixty feet. YOU DON'T FEEL HE'S HAD ANY COMMUNICATION WITH YOU SINCE THAT TIME? No. WAS J-ROD'S TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION SELECTIVE TO YOU? The folks who wanted to find out what he was saying to me, they found out after awhile that he was communicating with me because I was smiling. I couldn't help it. We were actually joking back and forth. But they didn't have any clue what he was saying, so (the telepathic communication) had to be selective. They certainly would not have pressed me like they did after I woke up from the \"big attention\" scenario (when J-Rod grabbed Dan). I woke up outside the Clean Sphere and was dragged out of there by Steven. He finally got a secondary suit on and dragged me out of the Clean Sphere. But they had no clue what he (J-Rod) was saying. I'm sure of it. They were extra rough in removing my catheter and all that business after I got out. As A Whistleblower, What Are You Trying To Accomplish? EVERYONE IS ASKING WHY ARE YOU TALKING TO US NOW? WHAT IS YOUR INTENTION IN TELLING US ABOUT THIS, YOUR INVOLVEMENT? It's multi-focal. There are several reasons. The largest reason is not the most important reason. The largest reason from a personal perspective is to step out from under the Black Ops community and retire. I'm ready. I told you before, I see myself walking along a pond and not being bothered by anybody, except for a bird here or there and taking a sample and taking my time looking at it for fun. For enjoyment. AND YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR HEALTH, RIGHT? My health is degrading, there's no doubt about that. The heart disease I have is in fact degrading my health. Time is coming. I don't know how long that is and that, of course, is within God's provenance. SO, YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME FREEDOM, TO HAVE SOME TIME OF YOUR OWN TO GO TO WALDEN'S POND, RIGHT? Yes, and there are other reasons. Without yelling the ' poor me' scenario Yes, people have a right to know! Other folks have screamed that some of them real, some of them phony as a $3 b ill. Yes, the public has a right to know what is going on. They have a right to know because this is their future. Or maybe not. It depends upon our"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"wisdom, or lack thereof. This gets me thinking. The one thing that we've heard from the Brookings Institution famous study was (revealing extraterrestrials) would cause a great social upheaval. It would destroy our social bonds, our religious bonds. Every time an individual is approached with the issue of would this destroy your faith? I have heard, 'No, it would strengthen it.' From a certain perspective, yes. From another perspective, no. The Brookings Institution was correct on a certain level. Suspend disbelief for a moment and walk with the idea that this is real, that the ruins that are present on the moon and Mars, the ancient temples, were in fact, and are in fact, are the gifts of our own progeny (children). Can you imagine what is going to happen when those temples which were used to pray to the Gods are found out to be nothing more than the creations of mankind. That the men themselves are the ones who were being worshiped?! Mankind will fall headlong into the pool of Narcissus. Maybe that's a good thing. Maybe that's a good thing. Maybe we'll find truth, or of God something other than buildings and stones. Maybe that's a good thing. Maybe that's a good thing. Maybe we'll find truth, love of God, something other than buildings and stones and marble. Maybe we'll find out who He really is, or She, or It, or just us.\" Continued in Part 2.

He is 40 years old now, born on February 2, 1964. His birth certificate name was Danny B (no period) Crain. I have met and talked with his mother, Dodie Crain, and with Dan Burisch, Ph.D., who confirm the name change after his marriage."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Copy of Danny B Crain (aka Dan Burisch) \"Certificate of Live Birth\" at 4:28 a.m. on February 2, 1964, in St. Francis Hospital in Lynwood, California - a suburb of Los Angeles. Birth certificate provided by \"Dodie\" Crain. In 1990, he married Deborah Kay Burisch who had a child from a previous marriage. Five years later in 1995, Dan legally changed his last name from Crain to Burisch to match the child's legal last name. In 1989, as Dan Crain graduated from SUNY Stonybrook with a Ph.D. in Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Dan was at the same time employed by the U. S. Navy's DOD Naval Research Laboratory. His rank was Captain and his title Microbiologist IV. In 1994, he was assigned to work in an underground laboratory at S-4/5 at Area 51, five floors under the Papoose Mountain installation at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The fifth floor is accessible only by one secure elevator. Dr. Burisch said in the years 1991 to 1994, he suited up in the fifth floor underground laboratory in an astronaut-type suit with breathing and urination hoses. His assignment was to enter a round, \"clean sphere\" f illed with a cold atmosphere of 4% by volume hydrogen and other gases including argon. Inside the clean sphere was an entity originally called \"extraterrestrial\" by Dr. Burisch's government superiors and later described as a \"time traveler\" from 50,000 years in the future. According to Dr. Burisch, his boss reported to a MAJI committee, an extension of the Majestic-12 Special Studies Group organized by President Harry S. Truman in 1947. Majestic 12 included top scientific, military and business leaders asked to st udy the extraterrestrial phenomenon.
