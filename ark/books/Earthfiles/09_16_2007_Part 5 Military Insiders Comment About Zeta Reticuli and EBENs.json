One of the Ebens said, ‘We made you. We put you here. But you have to live it.’” - Military Insider Return to Part 1 September 16, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - The government insiders I am calling \"Sherman\" also described seeing 3-dimensional, moving images of Jesus Christ in the Yellow Book. Further, the Ebens allegedly communicated \"there really is a devil.\" I asked Sherman, \"What role do you think Christ has played in all of this if it's true that the Ebens had a connection to His birth on this planet and are somehow involved with the recycling of souls?\" Christ in the Yellow Book \"The Yellow Book had Earth history, including the time of Christ, who the Yellow Book said was put here by the Ebens to teach humans about love and non-violence, but humans killed him anyway.\" \"Did you see Christ in the Yellow Book?\" \"Yes.\" \"Did you see Christ speaking at the Mount of Olives? Or was he being crucified? Or what?\" \"The picture that I saw was after Christ was crucified and died and was ascending into heaven. It was beautiful, kind of an aurora ring over his head. These pictures moved. They were moving pictures.\" \"So you saw Christ moving up in the aurora light?\" \"Right. And then there were people on the ground and the people were moving. It's kind of like when you were a kid and got the things that you put the round circles of pictures into and clicked it to see different images. But this had 3 dimensions and moved. The pictures only moved within the photo you were looking at. It's hard to explain. But I saw Christ and then I moved it and lost it to other pictures. There were big, huge pillars coming out of the ground like an earthquake. Then it showed the Earth and it showed a space vehicle.\" \"Was it a silver disc?\" \"Yes, typical, every day flying saucer. It also showed a cigar shape, which is a mother ship farther out in space. You turn the Yellow Book again and you see like a big greenhouse in an indoor stadium and fields of wheat or plants.\" \"What role do you think Christ has played in all of this if it's true that the Ebens had a connection to his birth on this planet and are somehow involved with the recycling of souls?\" \"I think there is a lot that is beyond human comprehension. Maybe we could not understand it - or handle it - if the Ebens told us straight out.\" Is There A Devil? "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I asked Sherman, \"Is there a devil out there somewhere?\" \"There is an evil force. Even the Ebens talk about it. There is a Supreme Being and then there is what the Ebens refer to as an evil entity. The Ebens are as scared of that evil entity as we are of the devil, or Satan. I think it's the same.\" \"Where is the devil?\" \"I don't know. But what worries me is that if the Ebens are scared of the evil entity, I'm damned scared of it because the Ebens can control everything! They have been around this universe and done everything. And if they believe in the same Supreme Being that we call God, and they say there is an Evil One - then there really is a Devil.\" \"Would the devil be equal to and opposite of the positive God force? Could there be two opposing Gods?\" \"I don't know. You can think about that forever. There's another thing that puzzles me. The Ebens say that everything that occurs in our time span has occurred before. I guess that means we're just right in the middle of a huge, big circle and it just goes around and around over and over. And the way I see this is that Earth was created and one day five billion years from now, the Sun is going to expand and Earth will be engulfed and destroyed and everything goes back into a big bang and everything starts over again.\" \"When the Yellow Book talked about the Supreme Being that created the universe, did it say anything about parallel dimensions, parallel time lines, or anything else like that?\" \"No, nothing. The aliens talked about the vastness of the universe, that there are life forms all over. It talks about a Supreme Being creating the souls and creating the containers and distributing the souls to the containers. To the Ebens, it's just basic facts.\" \"Sherman, if you know all this, does the President, too?\" \"No. Vital information about the core questions can be hidden from even the President. He is treated on a need-to-know basis. And real answers are often hidden between the lines.\" \"Any information about Earth catastrophes happening by 2000 - 2012?\" \"No, we have no knowledge regarding any catastrophes occurring on Earth within the next few years. But we are preparing for our Eben friends to return to Earth soon.\" \"Do you have any specific dates?\" \"They were supposed to be back in 1997 for a meeting with MJ-12. I don't know if anything will be made public.\" (Huge triangle fly-over Arizona was March 13, 1997.) Humans Were Created and Are Monitored by the Ebens \"Do you have any understanding about what the Ebens want after all the millions of years of interactions with our planet?\" \"No, except the Ebens set us in motion genetically and are watching us grow, like 'watching children grow' is the way it's been described to me. One of the Ebens said, 'We made you. We put you here. But you have to live it.'\" \"Well, Sherman, the Ebens must have their hands full if this warring humanity is what they created.\" \"I don't know. There's so much out there that we just don't understand.\" \"If there is a finite number of souls and the Ebens are concerned about humans damaging souls by damaging our body containers with violence, why do you think the Vatican says there should be no birth control or abortion? It's almost as if it's promoting the creation of containers. In a finite-soul universe, that's a difficult position to take, isn't it?\" \"That's a good question. I don't know.\" \"Has anybody discussed whether the Ebens check out souls the way we check out books for information?\" \"Nope, I never heard that.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"\"Well, some abductees think our bodies and souls are checked out like CD-ROMs so that all experiences and knowledge can be 'played back.' That way, the non-humans don't have to literally live here to experience and know everything that has happened here over eons.\" \"Interesting possibility, but I don't know.\" \"If the Ebens made us and put us here, there has to be a reason. Are we a garden growing containers for souls to be harvested for some reason?\" \"That's another good question. All I can tell you is that one elderly man with MJ-12 told me, 'You don't want to know that,' when I asked him about souls and why the Ebens made us.\" \"Sherman, some abductees also say that the main reason for the animal mutilations and human abductions has to do with the creation of a hybrid species. But no one knows whether the hybrids are supposed to replace the current Homo sapiens sapiens container model. There is a sense that whatever the non-humans are up to, it has something to do with survival - theirs and ours.\" \"Maybe. All I know is that the Ebens are supposed to have manipulated DNA in already- evolving primates long before humans were created. So, there must have been a series of experiments like Neanderthal before Cro-Magnon. And Neanderthal's gone. So who knows what's on the agenda for humans?\" A landmark study in the July 1997 scientific journal, Cell , reported that Neanderthal DNA is not linked to human DNA. Researchers from Germany and the U. S. extracted less than 1/100th of an ounce from the upper arm bone of the first fossilized Neanderthal skeleton ever found in the Neander valley of Germany. Maternal DNA from a pulverized piece of the bone estimated to be 100,000 years old was compared with genetic material from hundreds of people around the modern world. [ Editor's Note: Source: \"Neanderthal DNA Sequences and the Origin of Modern Humans\" by M. Krings, A. Stone, R. W. Schmitz, H. Krainitzki, M. Stoneking and S. Paabo, Cell, Issue 14, Volume 90, No. 1 © 1997 Cell Press, Cambridge, Mass.] Svante Paabo, the University of Munich genetics expert who led the six-year effort, said: \"This is the first genetic information we have from Neanderthals and it gives no indication that any mixing between the two groups (Cro-Magnon and Neanderthals) would have taken place.\" The results indicated that the last ancestor common to both species was most likely Homo erectus about 600,000 years ago. It is assumed that the precursor to modern humanity emerged from Africa about 100,000 years ago. If Sherman is correct about the Ebens performing a series of genetic experiments with primates on this planet, it might explain why Neanderthal was allowed to die out while the most recent Cro-Magnon Homo sapiens sapiens model that overlapped Neanderthal is a robust survivor. But which primate about forty thousand years ago did the Ebens use to create Cro-Magnon? And why? To the Ebens, we could be a newer model android designed to do work for them on this planet without our being conscious of the services and products we provide. Humans might also be an experiment of biology and soul. Survival could be directly linked to spiritual growth and keener perceptions of the unseen, not material acquisitions and technologies. Survival is a reoccurring theme in the non-human phenomena - ours and the Others, whether extraterrestrial biological entities, time travelers, interdimensionals, angels, or a mixture of them all. Many in the abduction syndrome have said that whatever the aliens are and want, we humans affect them, too. Perhaps one truth was described by USAF Staff Sergeant James Penniston from his December 1980 RAF Bentwaters experience in England when he said the entities were time travelers on a grand mission to avoid extinction in a distant human future. Sgt. Penniston said the entities that landed in the Rendlesham Forest near Bentwaters \"... are us (from far in the future.) ... They need chromosomes. ... (They are using us) Like Band-Aids.\" If that is one of the hidden facts, all of us could understand and have sympathy for the men and women in government who have had to ride out such difficult and confusing discoveries. But how long can government knowledge and cover-up go on without destroying its own relationship with the citizens it is supposed to govern and protect? On August 16, 1958, Major Donald Keyhoe received a letter postmarked Zurich, Switzerland from Carl Gustav"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Jung, M. D. The renowned psychiatrist had written a book that year entitled Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Sky. Dr. Jung speculated that the phenomenon might be psychic projections related to mankind's anxieties about the threat of nuclear annihilation, but changed his mind before his death in 1961 and came down on the side of real physical craft. He wrote Keyhoe: \"If it is true that the A. A. F. (American Air Force) or the government withholds telling facts, then one can only say that this is the most unpsychological and stupid policy one could invent. Nothing helps rumors and panics more than ignorance. It is self-evident that the public ought to be told the truth, because ultimately it will nevertheless come to the daylight. There can hardly be any greater shock than the H-bomb and yet anybody knows of it without fainting.\" [ Source: Flying Saucers: TOP SECRET © 1960 by Major Donald E. Keyhoe, U. S. Marine Corps, Ret.] Some of the facts the U. S. government has withheld about the non-human presence are the very advanced technologies. There are glowing beams which can lift humans and animals from bedrooms, backyards and pastures. The mysterious beams look like solid tubes of dust or fog. Several ranchers have described seeing how those beams pick up animals or drop them back to the ground, dead and mutilated. But beyond the repulsive and confusing animal deaths, disturbing human abduction syndrome and the U. S. government's long-standing policy of denial in the interest of national security, I concluded my third book, Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness with these thoughts: \"Perhaps the unique isolation each human feels and the peculiar melancholy a dark sky filled with stars can evoke have something to do with knowledge buried in our genes and souls, a sensing of ancient intimacies with other beings and other worlds. Now in this time of revolution when the whole world will know we are not alone in this universe, our greatest challenge as a species will be to stand up unafraid before the old lords and watchers. Ultimately, there is a common bond among all life forms ebbing and flowing on spirals of different frequencies supported by a singular force, an invisible matrix of energy from which everything emerges and to which everything returns.\" More Information: If viewers have more information about non-human encounters, please email me at earthfiles@earthfiles.com For further reports about non-human intelligence, technology and interactions with Earth life, please see reports below in the Earthfiles Archive and my four books: An Alien Harvest; the 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities; and Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles in the Earthfiles Shop: EBENs (Extraterrestrial Biological Entities) • 08/30/2007 — Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 09/04/2006 — Part 1: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - M ilitary Visitor to Another Planet? • 09/05/2006 — Part 2: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - M ilitary Visitor to Another Planet? • 06/18/2006 — Viewer Letters About NASA Airbrushing Photos; EBENs and Rept ilian Humanoids • 05/12/2006 — An Extraterrestrial School for Humans • 03/17/2006 — Part 1: U.S. Navy Chief Yeoman Describes \"Extraterrestrial Biological Entities\" in TOP SECRET/MAJIC Photographs. • 03/23/2006 — Part 2: U.S. Navy Chief Yeoman Describes \"Extraterrestrial Biological Entities\" in TOP SECRET/MAJIC Photographs • 02/10/2006 — Crashed Disc Photos, \"Ebens,\" and Area 51 \"Anti-Gravity\" • 10/05/2002 — Part 1 - Two Scientists Describe Extraterrestrial Biological Entity (EBEN) Called \"J-Rod\" • 06/22/1999 — The Strange Story of J-Rod, An EBE Non-Humans and Aerial Craft • 08/24/2007 — Orange-Red \"Fiery\" Aerial Spheres • 08/01/2007 — Part 3, Non-Human Blonds, Greys and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Lizards • 07/31/2007 — Part 2, Non-Human Blonds, Greys and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Lizards • 07/26/2007 — Part 1, Non-Human Blonds, Lizards and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Greys • 07/28/2007 — Mysterious Aerial Lights Over Stratford-upon-Avon, July 14, and Farnborough, Hampshire, on July 22, 2007 • 07/14/2007 — Schofield Barracks, Oahu, Hawaii - Huge, Lime Green Oval Craft Hovered Over Battalion Headquarters • 03/14/2007 — Part 5: Mysterious Events At 2005 Tawsmead Copse \"Insectogram\" Crop Formation • 02/12/2007 — Part 2: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers and Listeners • 01/26/2007 — Part 1: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans • 01/26/2007 — Part 2: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans • 01/26/2007 — Part 3: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans • 01/08/2007 — Updated: Attorney Describes His Encounter with Non-Human Entities • 01/02/2007 — Grey Aerial Disk Reported by Chicago O'Hare United Airlines Pilots and Mechanics"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"• 10/28/2006 — Close UFO Encounter by USAF Eyewitnesses • 12/31/2006 — Part 8: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue • 10/19/2006 — UFO Retaliation to U.
