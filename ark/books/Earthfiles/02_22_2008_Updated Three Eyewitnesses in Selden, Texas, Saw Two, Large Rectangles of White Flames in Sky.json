It looked like the flames were contained inside two rectangular shaped 3-dimensional frames about 50 yards wide and about 150 yards tall.” - S teve Allen, Glen Rose, Texas A triangle of three small towns (green circles) southwest of Fort Worth begins with Stephenville, the county seat of Erath County, Texas, population about 15,000. Dublin is about eight miles southwest and has a population of 3,754. Straight east of Dublin about ten miles is Selden with a full time population of about seven. Further east (red circles) are Glen Rose and Meridian. Updated February 22, 2008 with images and text. February 5, 2008 Glen Rose, Texas - On the night of January 8, 2008, dozens of eyewitnesses in the region of Texas southwest of Dallas/Fort Worth reported seeing strange combinations of flashing lights in the sky. Everyone said the lights were either on a single huge craft or were in rigid formation. All agreed that the lights pulsed on and off, but not together. One light would come on and go off while one or more at random distances would flash on and off. The earliest high strangeness that night began around 6:12 PM in Selden, Texas. Fifty- year-old Steve Allen is Owner, President and CEO of L & S Enterprises and Texas Freight, a trucking and transportation brokerage company in Glen Rose, Texas, which he founded with his wife, Laquita, in 1994. Steve has also been a civilian pilot since the late 1970s when he learned to fly. As the sun was near setting, Steve traveled from his Glen Rose office to a hill in nearby Selden to sit by a campfire and relax before dark with his long-time friend, Mike Odam, and a local postal worker, Lance Jones. Steve said the sun was still about half way above the horizon when astonishing aerial events occurred in the clear, cloudless sky.

Interview: Steve Allen, Owner, President and CEO, L & S Enterprises and Texas Freight, Glen Rose, Texas: “I looked toward the east (my right) and saw four lights coming towards us at a high rate of speed - and flashing. That’s when I asked Mike Odam and Lance Jones if they were seeing what I was seeing. They said yes. WHAT COLORS WERE YOU SEEING? Bright, white lights. Very bright and intense. They were large. S elden, Texas, hillside and campfire at 6:12 PM on January 8, 2008. Eyewitnesses of four bright lights in mile-long by 1/2-mile wide rectangle pattern were Steve Allen, Mike Odam and Lance Jones. All sketches © 2008 for Earthfiles by Steve Allen. A FULL MOON AT ARM’S LENGTH CAN BE COVERED BY THE TIP OF A LITTLE FINGERNAIL. I estimate that each of those four lights were about the size of a quarter at arm’s length. WHAT WE DON’T KNOW PRECISELY IS THE DISTANCE FROM YOU TO THAT QUARTER-SIZE LIGHT AT ARM’S LENGTH DISTANCE? Correct. I could see where the craft was flying over. That’s my regular area of flight when I fly my airplane. So, I’m pretty familiar with the area and approximate altitude. WHEN THE FOUR LIGHTS FIRST APPEARED, WERE THEY IN A STRAIGHT LINE"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"OR PATTERN? It appeared to be a rectangular pattern and they were all level and traveling at the same rate of speed and same distance apart. IS THIS THEN THE FIRST RECTANGLE WITH A LIGHT AT EACH CORNER THAT YOU DESCRIBED AS A MILE LONG AND A HALF MILE WIDE? Correct. That was a conservative estimate, but that was about as close as I could get. The way I got my distances was by the land that has grid sections. I waited until the craft got even with us and then did a visual from the ground to the sky and could tell what a mile was due to the section rows out there and came to my mile long conclusion. And it appeared to be half as wide as it was long. WAS IT ONE LARGE OBJECT THAT HAD FOUR LIGHTS IN A RECTANGULAR PATTERN? OR FOUR COMPLETELY SEPARATE OBJECTS THAT WERE IN FORMATION? We couldn’t confirm for sure what it was, but just the way the lights traveled, we felt like it was one big thing. We talked about the flying-in-formation scenario, but the three of us thought it was more likely to be one, huge, single craft. Mile-Long Rectangle of Four Lights Traveled “Between 2,000 and 3,000 mph” It seemed like the rectangle of lights was traveling at a very high rate of speed. My original estimate was between 2,000 and 3,000 mph. It was gradually slowing down as we watched and came into range 15 to 20 miles away. By the time it got even with us, it was traveling like a normal aircraft speed, probably anywhere around the 200 to 300 mph range. By then, the lights were traveling about 2,500 to 3,000 feet above ground level and approximately one-half mile north of our Selden hilltop location. As the rectangle of lights went past us, that’s when the ‘show’ started. As the lights in the rear – or two corner lights – came past us, more lights appeared in the rear. I think there was seven. It went on into Stephenville, which was seven or eight more miles into town as a bird flies. YOU HAD FOUR LIGHTS IN FOUR CORNERS MAKING A RECTANGLE PERHAPS A MILE LONG AND A HALF MILE WIDE. Right, and the lights were flashing (randomly). Four Lights Became Nine Lights WHERE DID THE OTHER FIVE LIGHTS APPEAR IN THE REAR? That happened after it went past us. That’s when we could see the rear of whatever it was - or at least we think that was the rear of it. After it came to dead even with us, it went past us and we noticed the rest of the lights come on. A t 6:13 PM on January 8, 2008, the rear two large, white lights of rectangle pattern change into seven equally spaced large, white lights. Front two lights remain in original position. They were equally spaced apart in this half-mile distance across the rear. They were exactly level with each other, exactly horizontal. They also were very bright. They appeared as the same intensity as the four corner lights. They were flashing in no particular pattern. One would flash and then another. There was no rhythm or pattern to it whatsoever, the flashes. SO, FIVE MORE LIGHTS WERE ADDED TO THE REAR ON THAT RECTANGLE IN A STRAIGHT LINE AND THEY SEEM TO BE EQUALLY SEPARATED – THE SAME SIZE, THE SAME WHITE LIGHT INTENSITY."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Correct. And each light in a random scenario would go all the way out. It wasn’t like they would go to a dim glow or pulsing. It was like a turn indicator off and on. There was no rhyme or reason which one would go on or off. There was no rhythm to them. As the rectangle of lights passed by us, it was gradually slowing down. It got to the edge of Stephenville and came to a complete stop. It had not changed altitude any. It was still at the 2,500 to 3,000 foot altitude. Then very suddenly, the lights in the rear reconfigured into an arch going upward like a bow in a bow and arrow. S even horizontal rear lights suddenly change to an arch pattern of equally spaced, bright, white lights. THE LIGHTS WERE A HORIZONTAL LINE AND THEN FORMED A HALF CIRCLE? That’s a good scenario – more like a football turned sideways arch. That lasted for three or four seconds and then the lights suddenly appeared into a vertical line. The lights were still flashing with no rhythm or course of action. They were just intermittently flashing. DO YOU MEAN THAT ALL NINE LIGHTS SUDDENLY FORMED A STRAIGHT, VERTICAL LINE? I believe it was just the seven in the rear all formed a vertical line. DID THE LIGHTS CHANGE FORMATION LIKE ICE SKATERS? No, they just instantly reconfigured. YOU SAW THE HORIZONTAL LINE OF THE SEVEN LIGHTS. THEN THE NEXT MICROSECOND, THEY WERE IN A VERTICAL LINE? Ye s . THEY WERE ALL WHITE? Yes, actually the vertical line came from the arched bow. The lights were horizontal and then went to a bow and then went to a vertical line. Then about two or three seconds later, it became two sets of the vertical lights. They appeared to be about quarter to a half mile apart. And they were all flashing like they had been before. A rch of white lights changed suddenly to one vertical line of seven lights, followed in a couple of seconds by the appearance of a second vertical line of seven lights."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Two Vertical Lines of Lights Transformed into Rectangles of White Fire T he two vertical lines of seven, bright, white lights suddenly transform into two large rectangles of white flames moving inside the rectangular frames. Steve Allen estimated the heights of the rectangular frames to be 150 yards; the width of the rectangles to be 50 yards; and a distance of 1/4 of a mile between the two rectangles of white fire. Then in two or three more seconds, the two vertical lines of flashing lights turned into white flames. It looked like the flames were contained inside two rectangular shaped 3-dimensional frames about 50 yards wide and about 150 yards tall. WHEN YOU SAY FLAME, I’M THINKING OF FIRE. Exactly. It was a real light-colored fire. It looked like it was contained in a rectangular box because of its outline of the fire. But there were two rectangular boxes of white fire. Each one of the vertical sets of lights turned into a flame job. Then two seconds later, it disappeared totally. Everything had like a two to three second delay to it – like it had the arch of pulsing lights that went to the vertical scenario that was flashing. Then about three seconds later, it had two sets of vertical lights and then two or three seconds later it went to the white fire. Then two to three seconds later, it was gone completely. BOTH OF THEM? EVERYTHING? Yes, everything. It was two rectangular boxes containing flames and it was like something Biblical. It was right there, not far out in space. This was very up close and personal. That's what the three of us said to each other: ‘It's like something out of the Bible.’ And one of the guys asked, ‘Could this be the end of the world?’ HOW DID YOU DISTINGUISH FLAMES IN ALL WHITE? It just had the moving flame look to it. More Lights and F-16 Jets After this happened, we stood there for about ten minutes discussing, ‘What the hell could this have been?’ Lance immediately gets in his car and leaves. It kind of scared him, I guess, or freaked him out. He leaves and we go inside Mike Odam’s house and tell his wife what we had just seen. Then she calls Lance to see if he's OK and he says, ‘You all better get back out there because it’s back coming from the west this time.’ So, we go outside and here it comes from the west and to the south of us this time. It looked to be a little bit lower than it was the first time. It had the two lights in the front as it came past and you could see the other two lights in the rear. Each white light in the rear was surrounded by a vivid red glow - a color I've never seen before (back two white lights"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"were embedded in unusual red glows). A round 6:25 PM, the four bright, white lights of the original mile-long by one-half-mile wide rectangle pattern return with two of the lights surrounded by an unusual red glow. Coming from the west at high speed with afterburners glowing w ere two F-16 jets that took off after the rectangle of lights. SIZE OF THE RED LIGHTS? Close to a large silver dollar, but only around the rear white lights. DISTINCTLY LARGER THAN THE WHITE LIGHTS? Correct. SOME PEOPLE I’VE HEARD COMPARE SOME OF THE MYSTERIOUS AERIAL LIGHTS TO A WELDER'S MAGNESIUM TORCH. That’s a good scenario – like a welder’s torch. WHAT RED MIGHT I KNOW THAT WOULD BE CLOSE TO WHAT YOU SAW? The red lights had a glow to them. It appeared to have an outward protrusion from them like a globe scenario if you took a sphere and cut it in half – that’s how they appeared. The red was not as bright as a magnesium torch, but it was pretty bright and a really unusual color. It was dark by then, so it was very easy to track as it went off to the east. WHAT’S THE CLOSEST COMPARISON TO THE RED? I would call it a fire engine red, but with a different twist. BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT WAS GLOWING? The way it was glowing and if you added a smidge of orange in there. It’s just no color I’ve ever seen before. It’s very unusual. Then in about three or four seconds, here comes two F-16s in pursuit chasing them at the same altitude, but the jets were not doing a very good job of catching. We watched the lights until they went out of sight about 25 miles away going east. WERE THE JETS STILL IN PURSUIT? Yes. They did have their afterburners on. Two pilot buddies of mine who live further to the east heard a double sound barrier break. That means that someone had to authorize excessive speed because breaking the sound barrier is illegal. But this was at 2,000 to 2,500 feet altitude. It’s very unusual to have military jets in our area flying that fast. AS A LONG TIME PILOT OF 30 YEARS, YOU WOULD BE VERY FAMILIAR WITH CIVILIAN AND MILITARY ACTIVITY IN THE GLEN ROSE AND STEPHENVILLE AREA, CORRECT? My dad started taking me to air shows when I was 2 and 3 years old. He’s an old military man who was a plane technician."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"UNTIL JANUARY 8, 2008, HAD YOU EVER SEEN F-16S TAKE OFF AFTER ANYTHING IN THE GLEN ROSE AREA LIKE YOU DID THAT NIGHT? No. Absolutely not. We are not in a military training area and it’s very seldom that you ever see one. HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT ALL LASTED FROM THE TIME YOU SAW THE FOUR BRIGHT LIGHTS WITH THE TWO HALF MOON OF RED GLOWS AND THE FINAL LAST SIGHT AS THE JETS CHASED AFTER? Probably 90 seconds. Intimidating Phone Calls Afterward I’ve had several different strange phone calls from different people. They did not identify themselves. They just said to be careful, that I was being watched, that what I do will be carefully scrutinized and I could be in danger. DID ANYONE STATE WHAT THE DANGER WOULD BE? No, they never did. They can threaten me all they want. What are they going to do? Shoot me? I saw what I saw and I’m going forward with what I saw, come hell or high water.” Other Infrared High Strangeness P alo Pinto, Texas, (top center) is north of Stephenville near Mineral Wells.

Near the beam is a block of deer food on the upper ground. The beam intensifies, becoming brighter and brighter, and lasts for five minutes."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"2) December 7, 2007 at 5:05 PM: Three deer are eating from the upper ground deer food and the lower ground deer food. For several minutes, the deer move around eating while their eyes glow brightly white in the greys and black infrared video. At one point, the three animals appear to be spooked by something unseen and run off. Then the deer return to the feeders. One is grazing at the upper ground deer food. Its right leg moves forward into a spot that would have been where the beam was two and a half weeks earlier. Instantly, the deer disappears. I played the infrared tape back and forth at normal speed and frame-by-frame many times looking for a brief flash of light or any anomaly at the moment the deer disappears. But the infrared tape and its time code move forward normally. 3) January 4, 2008 at 6:28 PM: What appears to be a very bright, white plasma orb appears at the camera lenses. The orb seems to be “examining” the cameras in its pulsing movement around the lenses, disappearing out of frame downward, which is where the wooden stands hold each camera up about 5 feet 2 inches and 28 inches apart. The orb is present throughout nearly six hours of infrared videotape. About mid-way through the tape, the orb seems to “enter” one of the camera lenses. White, translucent particles flow like water droplets toward the center of the frame, which then goes nearly pure white for an extended period of time. In that whiteness, more translucent particles are flowing like water. Eventually, the process reverses itself. The whiteness begins to thin out to translucent particles flowing like water droplets back out of the camera until the deer feeder scene clears again to the normal grey and black shades of infrared videotape. 4) January 31, 2008 at 12:30 AM until sunrise: An egg-shaped white plasma appears before the cameras rapidly and briefly three times by sunrise. Around the egg-shaped white glow is a “collar” around the egg's middle. In one sequence, the plasma egg enters and leaves one camera frame and enters and leaves the second camera frame.
