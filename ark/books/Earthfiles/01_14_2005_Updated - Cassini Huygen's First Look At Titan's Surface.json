ESOC's Main Control Room (MCR) at 14:12 CET, 14 January 2005, as flight control staff wait for first data from Huygens probe as it descended to Titan's surface.

Raw image returned at 16.2 kilometers from Titan's surface, with a resolution of approximately 40 meters per pixel. ESA said, \"It apparently shows short, stubby drainage channels leading to a shoreline.\" It was taken with the Descent Imager/Spectral Radiometer, one of two NASA instruments on the probe. The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The Descent Imager/Spectral team is based at the University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona.

ESA reports: \"This raw image was returned by the Descent Imager/Spectral Radiometer camera onboard the European Space Agency's Huygens probe after the probe descended through the atmosphere of Titan. It shows the surface of Titan with ice blocks strewn around. The size and distance of the blocks will be determined when the image is properly processed.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Raw surface of Titan with scale captions added by European Space Agency.
