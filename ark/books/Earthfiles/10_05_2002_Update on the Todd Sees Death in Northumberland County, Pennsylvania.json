Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Update on the Todd Sees Death in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania © 2002 by Linda Moulton Howe M ontour Ridge in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, near Northumberland was the scene of Todd Sees's disappearance on August 4, 2002, and discovery of his dead body on August 6, 2002, near his home after a two-day manhunt. October 4, 2002 Point Township, Northumberland County, Pennsylvania - Point Township Police Chief Gary Steffen announced today that 39-year-old Todd Sees, who was found dead August 6 near his Montour Ridge home after a two-day manhunt, died from a cocaine overdose. “The immediate cause of death has been determined to be cocaine toxicity. The manner of death is listed as accidental.” Toxicology analysis was done by Northumberland County Coroner James Kelley. These tests were requested after the autopsy back in August failed to determine Todd See's cause of death. Unanswered questions remain: why would a healthy outdoorsman, married to Sue Sees, and father of their two sons, Nick, 18, and Adam, 11, go on a Sunday morning hunting trip on August 4 and ingest enough cocaine to kill himself? Further, what is behind the “eyewitness reports” distributed on the internet about farmers allegedly seeing a silver disk appear over Montour Ridge and \"draw up a man into it?\" Those reports provoked so many calls to Point Township and Northumberland County people named in the internet releases that angry Point Township Police Chief Steffen threatened arrests for harassment. Another initial report was that the FBI entered the investigation and took Todd Sees's body for analysis. But reporter Marcia Moore at The Daily Item in Northumberland County who was at the scene during the first days of search said as far as she knew, the FBI never arrived or took the body for examination. Adding the coroner's cocaine overdose cause of death to his case file, Point Township Police Chief Gary Steffen says he will continue his investigation into the unexpected demise of Todd Sees.
