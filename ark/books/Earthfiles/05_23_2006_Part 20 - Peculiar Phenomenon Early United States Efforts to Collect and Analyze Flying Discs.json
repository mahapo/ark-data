That's all I was photographing, bodies.\" - U . S. Army/Air Force Photographer R eturn to Part 1 T he U. S. Army 509th Bomb Group, Z-Division at Sandia Base, New Mexico; the antiaircraft artillery school at Ft. Bliss, Texas; and U. S. Army Ordnance, Enemy Equipment Intelligence Section, attempted to pick up debris of a crashed aerial vehicle in a pasture between Corona and Roswell. At the same time, other crashes were reported, including on the Plains of San Agustin. In the San Agustin crash, there reportedly were two dead entities, one severely injured and one live extraterrestrial biological entity which attempted to give comfort to his fallen comrades at the crash site. I have no details about yet another possible crash east of the Rio Grande River near San Antonio, New Mexico. Please note that the Corona and San Agustin Plains events are discussed and documented by Stanton Friedman and Don Berliner in Crash At Corona © 1992. Briefly, this is what happened. W. W. \"Mack\" Brazel found silver debris in one of his ranch pastures on the morning of July 3. Some witnesses say it was the next day on the Fourth of July that Mack went to see the Chavez County Sheriff in Roswell; others say it was July 5. The Sheriff, George Wilcox, called Walker Field and was given Major Jesse Marcel, Intelligence Officer of the 509th Bomb Group. Major Marcel and others went to the Corona crash site. After returning to Walker Field, the men presumably reported to the Commandi ng General of the Ei ghth Air Force i n Ft. Worth, Texas, that they had found a crashed UFO. Mack Brazel reported his discovery to a local radio station. As the report was being transmitted over Associated Press teletype between Roswell and Albuquerque, the message traffic was interrupted. The telephone rang and a man identified himself as an officer at the Pentagon. The man threatened the teletype operator by saying \"bad things\" would happen if she did not immediately stop the transmission. On July 7, another radio station in Roswell transmitting a story for ABC and the Mutual Broadcasting Network, was interrupted. A simple statement came over the teletype: \"THIS IS THE FBI, YOU WILL CEASE TRANSMITTING...\" [ Crash At Corona © 1992 by Friedman and Berliner.] The story being transmitted included the information that the crash debris was reportedly going to be taken to Texas. But the pilots were from Wright (Patterson) Field, Ohio. The plane was under orders of General Nathan Twining's AMC. General Twining (MJ-4), however, was not in Ohio. He was in New Mexico - first at the AFSWP at Sandia Base in Albuquerque. Later he went to Alamogordo Army Air Field and, it is believed, went from there to Carrizozo and Corona. In 1947, neither the U. S. nor any other military or security group of any other country could instantaneously descend upon a small community and tie up their communication systems without considerable prior planning. A wire dispatch between Roswell and Albuquerque could not have been interrupted in the middle of a transmission without prior knowledge that the security group needed to monitor communication lines in a specific geographic area. Anti-aircraft Artillery, the Army Air Forces at Alamogordo Army Air Field and Army Ordnance at WSPG knew that they had \"splashed\" possibly three flying discs: one northwest of WSPG; one near San Antonio and the other northeast of WSPG - due to their own covert action. The U. S. Army knew to monitor communications in these areas because the flying discs were headed in those directions when the flying discs went off range radar behind the crests of the San Andres Mountains on the north and west, and Oscura Peak to the north. None of these military groups, however, had the expertise to monitor communications. That fell under the purview of the FBI and military intelligence. Over the next two weeks, military and civilians \"flashing curious identification cards when challenged by guards\" said they were with project so and so.\" The Armed Forces Special Weapons Project at Sandia Base descended on Roswell from \"all over the country.\" [ Stanton Friedman and Don Berliner in Crash At Corona © 1992.] An Army Air Force photographer then based at Anacosta Naval Air Station in Washington, D. C., was interviewed by Stanton Friedman for the book Crash At Corona. The photographer said that he was told to pack his bags and board a B-25 that took another photographer and himself to Roswell. \"We got out there to one of the three crash sites near Corona, and there were a helluva lot of people out there in a closed tent. ...There were four (non-human) bodies I could see when the flash went off. That's all I was photographing, bodies. They were under a canvas and military people would open it up and you'd take a picture, flip out your flashbulb, put another one in, take another picture and give them the film holder and then you went to the next spot. I guess there were ten or twelve officers. The bodies looked like they were laying on a tarp.\" [Ibid.] The U. S. Army first reported the crash to be a flying disc. But within a few hours, a counter-story emerged "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"that the crash was nothing more than a weather balloon. On July 8, 1947, General Ramey, Commander of the 8th Air Force, said that there had been a big misunderstanding and that the balloon and its radar target were part of an upper atmosphere research program. There was no mystery because what rancher Mack Brazel had found was only the balloon and its reflector. [ Front Page, The New York Times , July 9, 1947.] By September 1994, while Peculiar Phenomenon was being researched and interviews were conducted in the field, the official story had changed again after nearly half a century. The Air Force explained that it was not a weather balloon. It was a \"secret balloon\" related to Project Mogul, an early attempt to develop technology to spy on Russian nuclear testing activity. After forty-seven years, the U.S. Air Force officially admitted that the \"weather balloon story\" was actually a cover story for a TOP SECRET Atomic Energy Commission project. I believe that the Air Force changed its official line, motivated by what one former President termed \"the limited hang out approach.\" It was in a curious statement made on July 10, 1947, three days after recovery operations began at Corona. An Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) spokesman in Washington, D. C., was quoted in a Las Cruces Sun-News article headlined: \"Don't Make Early Plans to Visit the A-bomb Test Site.\" The AEC spokesman said: \"It certainly will be months, and it might be years, before visitors are allowed at the spot where the first atom bomb was exploded. The blast, which depressed a crater in the earth and liquefied the top sands, took place two years ago. But it is still a forbidden zone to the public. 'People are not allowed there (an AEC official said). We are making continuous studies at the crater of the cumulative effects of radiation.' ...A careful watch is kept on the health of the men who work there to safeguard them from over-exposure.\" F ront P age, Las Cruces Sun-News , July 10, 1947. The announcement was evidently directed at residents of southern New Mexico and cautioned them not to go to the Trinity Site. The statement appears to explain why AEC personnel in radiation suits and military convoys with Army and Navy personnel might be seen on Highway 380, which is the primary east-west access to both the San Antonio and Corona flying disc crash sites. Five days after that announcement, a P-80 landed on the same highway forty-five miles east of the Trinity site turn off. Three days later, the P-80 crashed as it attempted to take off from the highway. On July 11, four days after recovery operations began at Corona, the FBI announced that it would hold a special conference for all police and sheriff's officers in Lincoln, Chavez, Otero and a portion of Guadalupe County of south-central New Mexico. Is it surprising that this geographic area is the same area where military recovery operations were underway related to several flying discs? The meeting was scheduled for 7 p.m. on the evening of July 21, 1947, in the District Court Room of the Lincoln County Courthouse in Carrizozo. The conference addressed the topic of \"coordination in law enforcement\" by Mr. R. C. Suran, Special Agent in charge, El Paso region, Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mr Suran was quoted as saying: \"These conferences have become increasingly important due to their value in enabling law enforcement officers to become better acquainted with each other, thereby increasing mutual cooperation.\" [ Front Page, Lincoln County News, July 11, 1947.]"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" F ront Page, Lincoln County News/Carrizozo Outlook , Friday, July 11, 1947. Brig. General Montague (MJ-11) was assigned to command the AFSWP at Sandia Base on July 12. His primary responsibility to guard and protect U. S. nuclear weapons, probably using German Wasserfall surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft artillery. He was given three days to report for duty. It remains unclear what relationship General Montague had w ith General Leslie Groves, who had been the Commanding General throughout the entire history of the Manhattan Project and also carried the title of Commander of Sandia Base. [ Front Page, El Paso Times , July 12, 1947.] General Groves wasn't replaced until February 1948. When General Groves was replace Major General Kenneth Nichols is reported to replace him. Yet at the same time, Gen. Montague is also reported to be Commander of Sandia Base. It should be mentioned that a one star general's staff car was reported at both the Corona and San Agustin Plains disc crash sites. [ Sandia National Laboratories © Furman.] Col. Harold Turner was replaced by the U. S. Army as Commander of WSPG on July 15, 1947. Brig. General Blackmore, a general staff officer of U. S. Army Ordnance, assumed command. Col. Turner was relieved of command responsibilities at the Proving Ground a week and a day after his troops began picking up flying disc debris at Corona. The reader by now knows the \"official\" 1994 version of the U. S. Air Force position on the Roswell Incident was that it was a \"secret nuclear detection balloon.\" "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"F ront P age, Las Cruces Citizen , July 17, 1947. Carrizozo, NM: Disc Retaliation? C arrizozo, New Mexico, was between the disc crash site near Corona (Landing Zone 1, or LZ 1) and the disc crash near the Trinity Test Site west of Oscura P eak (LZ 2). The third crash site was east of Alamogordo. The three crash sites, or \"Landing Zones,\" were dated July 4-6, 1947, and described in the 1952 \"Majestic-12 1st Annual Report\" at www.majesticdocuments.com . Graphic © 1994 by Andrew Kissner. On Tuesday, July 15, 1947, a P-80 Shooting Star jet fighter landed on a remote, straight stretch of Highway 380, twenty-five miles south of the Corona flying disc crash site at the small community of Carrizozo just north of the northeastern corner of WSPG. This P-80 was similar to other aircraft that had standing orders at Muroc Field, California, to intercept any flying disc that might be sighted there, This Shooting Star landed near Carrizozo the same time as the U. S. Army and Navy were packing up debris from the Corona and White Sands"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"disc crashes and loaded four alien bodies onto Army B-29s and C-54 transports. [ Las Cruces Sun-News, July 20, 1947; Crash At Corona © Berliner and Friedman.] The P-80 waited at Carrizozo. Its mission, although secret to this day, was to provide air cover for the recovery operation. This was necessary in the event that another flying disc appeared and attempted to impede elements of the recovery T-Force. Perhaps a disc would attempt to retrieve the bodies of the crashed disc's dead crew members. The fighter was not based at Alamogordo Air Field. Rather, it was based at March Field, California. Using aircraft based at a distance from the site of a possible engagement is a further security precaution. This prevents discussion between pilots once back at base who can compare notes and experiences with local news stories and subsequent gossip. The T-Force's air security assignment was itself compartmentalized. The P-80 waited for two and a half days in Carrizozo. It sat next to Highway 380, was refueled by a U. S. Army tank truck driven to Carrizozo from Ft. Bliss, not Alamogordo Army Air Field which was closer by 65 mi l e s . The El Paso Times quoted U. S. Army sources that the plane had refueled at the Carrizozo airport. And yet, in 1995, that small airport still does not offer jet fuel. The cover story was that the fighter \"ran low on fuel\" in a rain storm. On Thursday night, military mechanics called for a battery charger that was airlifted to the site by a U. S. Army air transport - again not from Alamogordo Army Air Field, but from Ft. Bliss, home of the anti-aircraft artillery school. [ Las Cruces Sun-News, July 20, 1947.] It should be understood by the reader that Carrizozo airport in 1947 was an unimproved dirt strip. Over four days at least two C-47 transports, another \"Army transport\" and a P-80 all used either the airport runway or Highway 380 as a makeshift landing strip. All of this activity was less than 25 miles from the \"Roswell\" flying disc crash site southeast of Corona. Reporters quoted U. S. Army sources for the Las Cruces Sun-News and the El Paso Times in which they were told that the P-80 had made a forced landing at Carrizozo on a cross country flight between March Field, California, and Ft. Worth, Texas. The local Lincoln County News, however, based on interviews with Army personnel on the scene, reported that the plane had been on a flight between March Field and Biggs Army Air Field in El Paso. No explanation was given about why the P-80 was 120 miles north and further east than its intended destination. Why the official deception? On the afternoon of July 18, 1947, the waiting was over. As Capt. Floyd G. Soule of Riverside, California, brought his fighter back onto the center of the road and evenly applied power to his General Electric J-33 engine to develop maximum thrust engineered to drive his plane to 620 mph and released his parking brake, everything was fine. As he past stall speed and accelerated to 120 mph and pulled back on the stick, the plane lifted off the roadway to an altitude of 100 feet. But it would gain no more altitude. Conditions radically changed and it was too late. The fighter veered violently to the right, nose down. An eyewitness reported that the airplane was flying very fast and without any observable or explainable cause, simply rolled over and crashed. [ Author interview, September 6, 1994.] That eyewitness description is at odds with all published reports that indicated that either the plane did not get off the ground, or if it did, perhaps rose only several feet. The official cause of the crash was listed as \"bumps or pot holes in the roadway\" that precluded the plane from lifting off the ground. In reality, it was flying very fast at 100 or more feet when it rolled over. The P-80 was out of control and flew directly into the Monte Vista gas station on the southwest corner of State Route 54 and Highway 380. The airplane and the gas station exploded in a fireball simultaneously. Capt. Soule was killed instantly. It also killed Joe Hunter Drake, 25, of Carrizozo, and critically injured Glenn Davis, his six-year-old nephew from Ancho, New Mexico. Also injured were Mrs. Pick Warden of Capitan, New Mexico, and Mr. Joe Phillips, 28, of Carrizozo. Besides the P-80 and the gas station, the resulting explosions and fire destroyed three trucks and a car. Mrs. Warden's injuries were caused when a panicked truck driver ran over her. At 5:30 p.m. on July 18, 1947, more than one U. S. Army C-47 transport with medical personnel from Alamogordo left Carrizozo. The injured were transported to William Beaumont Army Hospital in El Paso. [ Las Cruces Sun News , July 20 and 24, 1947; El Paso Times, July 19 and 21, 1947.] The Lincoln County News said the C-47s had been called in to \"the declared emergency\" and that \"when they (C-47s) became available, they transported the dead and injured to Ft. Bliss.\" No one to this day has associated this tragedy with the recovery operation of a flying disc 25 miles north of Carrizozo at the same time. For a P-80 jet, that distance could be covered in 30 seconds. It's not surprising that an association was not made because oddly, only three newspapers reported about the fiery explosion. The USAF never acknowledged any airplane accidents near the disc crash sites around the time of the Roswell incidents. The USAF did report loosing five aircraft in New Mexico during July 1947. The P-80 explosion in Carrizozo is mentioned by the Air Force as only having occurred somewhere in New Mexico. The Air Force reported four other aircraft losses during July, which this author was not able to find in any published news source from 1947.
