S. Army's Camp Attebury to the northeast. January 24, 2004 Bloomington, Indiana - John Tosti is 34-years-old, has lived in Bloomington, Indiana for the past twenty-seven years and at his current Bloomington address for the past decade. Over the years, he has seen several strange objects in the sky, but nothing as \"weird\" as what he and his family saw around 8 p.m. on January 23, 2004, right from their backyard. Interview: John Tosti, Heating and Air Conditioning Contractor, Bloomington, Indiana: \"Around dinner time, t here were a lot of lights in the sky that I noticed out the back door, looking east over the back yard, low in the sky. And around 7:30 p.m., a couple of lights, really bright lights, appeared just over the tops of the trees in the backyard to the west. They were really bright. I thought they were stars at first, but I seen one move just a little bit. I thought actually at first it was the wind from the trees making it look like it moved. But as I noticed it, the light gently moved slowly to the south. So, I grabbed my flashlight, went back outside and started to flash it. I got a response. The object I was shining my flashlight at blinked out. It just totally disappeared, so I knew it was not a star. Then I noticed the other bright light started to move. It was in the west side of the sky and it started to move in a northeasterly fashion. And a long shaft of light, or tube it almost looked like a tube it was multi-colored. It was green, red and white. The colors of the light moved back and forth. I don't know how to explain it better than that. It didn't look right. I've seen plenty of aircraft at night and I know what airplanes look like, I know what helicopters are, what their light configurations are. This thing was just like a long shaft of light, like a tube, and it started to move in the sky. It was really cold and I walked back inside the house. My friend, Mark, called me and said he was seeing jet activity in my direction. While I talked to him, I noticed there were more funny lights over the backyard. Didn't know what they were, but they didn't look like any conventional aircraft that we have. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Aerial Object with Red and Yellow \"Tubes\" I went back outside and noticed this very strange object, very, very low, right behind the trees and it had three long tubes of yellow light with a really long tube of red light that was on top and made no noise. And I have never seen anything like it. I don't know what it was or what it was doing, but it was low, really close. I would say probably less than 1/8th of a mile away and really, really big. Really bright. My daughter noticed it. My wife noticed it after I had hollered to them inside the house. Drawing by John Tosti right after he and his family watched this strange aerial object around 8 p.m. in Bloomington, Indiana, on January 23, 2004. The strange object was going south and then it made a turn west and as it turned to the west, it kind of went behind the trees and disappeared. We couldn't see it because of the trees. Anyway, as it disappeared behind the tree, we noticed all these jets just appeared. It was as if they just came to a certain spot right over the top of our house. My daughter counted, I think it was actually fourteen jets altogether over the top of our house. WERE THESE JETS CIRCLING ONE AFTER THE OTHER? WHAT WAS THE TRAFFIC LIKE? It was almost as if they came from all directions, just like to the center of our house. Some crossed each other and some were following like in formation. It was almost like they came from the east, the south, the north and the west, just in all directions, and they all intersected over the top of our house. AT THAT POINT, DID YOU TRY TO CALL AN AIRPORT OR POLICE OR SOMEONE TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING? No, I didn't. I elected not to call the police because we've done that before and they've just called us 'freaks,' actually. We sat at the back window and we watched some of the lights in the backyard in the west side of the sky and it seemed like it got really intense with aircraft. Then within five to fifteen minutes, it got really quiet. Nothing. And we didn't notice anything more after that and it was probably around 8:15 p.m. by then that everything cleared out. 8:15 to 8:30 p.m., it was just quiet. I don't know if they were military or who they were, but they were jets and a lot of them! WHAT IS THE NEAREST MILITARY AIRPORT TO BLOOMINGTON? That would be Attebury and Crane Naval Base. They both have airports. Crane says they have an airport that's only large enough to accommodate things like Cessnas and things like that. But we've noticed a lot of military aircraft like F-16s and Black Hawk helicopters lifting off from Crane Naval Base.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Request: If any Earthfiles.com viewer has any information about the source or identification of the strange object over Bloomington, Indiana, on January 23, 2004, please e-mail me: earthfiles@earthfiles.com Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
