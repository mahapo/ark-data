Air Force pilots at McClelland AFB in 1973 were shown a black-and-white movie film featuring 'alien bodies on a slab.'\" - UFO Researcher, Chris Coffey To be more computer-friendly, the reprint has been divided into parts. Here begins Part 1 of Status Report V. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Status Report VI begins at Earthfiles 022404 . Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. PROLOGUE \"At this writing, many issues of controversy hang over UFO research. Some have caused bitter differences between team members; some can backfire and smear the image of objective research itself. In the middle zone, trying to avoid the 'people' problems, I feel the urgent need to continue my probes into one basic issue - UFO crash/retrievals. In this endeavor, once we can see through the specter of disinformation and find convincing evidence - or proof - that UFOs are not-and-bolt vehicles with an alien crew aboard, I believe that serious researchers can then go forward to disregard all the other wispy issues and maybe even put a stop to the disruptive noises coming out of the woodwork from the far-out fringe. Ideally, with the media supporting the demands for 'bottom line' facts from a strong phalanx of the scientific community, and perhaps some politicians, the UFO cover-up lid might melt or at least change allowing for some admissions and disclosures. By confirming any one case of an alleged UFO crash and recovery such as Roswell, Aztec, Kingman, El Yunque or even Brown County, Ohio, might alarm the world public, or even demolish some of its cherished traditions and philosophies. It could also lead to an eventual sharing of alien technologies such as a new propulsion system for inner and outer space travel or new 'metals' and many other marvels. Certainly it would bring public support for NASA and a bigger budget for vital space probes. More importantly, we might learn about the alien entities themselves, their intent for being here and an explanation for some of their incursive actions - such as abductions! Even at this short-of-proof stage, the UFO crash/retrieval story still unfolding, I believe, should be public information - unless the full UFO story is too exotically grim to tell. In that case, I reserve judgment. Feeling confident, I submit new data, based on my research and the cooperative work of others, for open review. VE RITAS VINCIT Leonard H. Stringfield December 7, 1988 PART I: THE QUIET OF DUSK ... As we close out the decade of the 1980s, new public interest in UFOs, it seems, is surging. Some of it probably is the trickle-down from new books on the market, but for the most "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"part, new and old researchers alike are being spurred by recent revelations of official cover-up amid some sobering reports of human encounters of the first, second, and third kind. Perhaps already an established fact is the climactic close encounter of the fourth kind: contact with an alien race. Based on rumors, contending that a covert human-alien relationship has been in effect, and of late, more rumors that tell of a ruptured 'alliance,' we must not only pause and wonder about the magnitude of a colossal cover-up, but the implications of an eventual open contact - even if it were on terms of peaceful co-existence. Any other alternative staggers the imagination! But, getting down to Earth, as we once knew it, we must also pause and ask in all seriousness: Where's the proof that a spacecraft exists? Or, for that matter, that a cover-up exists? A seemingly stupid question when we hear so many lurid tales about abductions, alien underground installations, genetic manipulation, animal and human mutilations, of American and Russian satellites exploding in space, of alien artifacts on the Moon and Mars, of dire predictions of the world's end. And yes, even to a lesser degree, we hear about UFO crash/retrievals. Once a blockbuster to research in the late 1970s and early 1980s, a crash story in 1988 was no longer big ufological news. As I weigh all the reports, or rumors - mindful of misinformation - I still maintain that it is in C/R research that we might find our elusive proof. Once the hardware and the crews, cadaverous or alive, are forced into public view, then we might find credibility for some of the other postulates and be in a better position to espouse endless hypotheses. Since presenting my paper, The Fatal Encounter at Ft. Dix-McGuire: A Case Study at the Mutual UFO Network Symposium in St. Louis, MO in 1985, and pursuing some leads in that case to little consequence, I have remained relatively quiet on the literary front. New C/R reports from time to time have surfaced since 1985, but most were secondhand or of the 'Cheshire Cat' variety, providing scant information. What I had, with a few exceptions, were not up to Roswell caliber and these cold wait until ... August and September of 1988. Then in the quiet of dusk, the valley of my research suddenly hit a peak. As Dick Hall, the author of Uninvited Guests , Aurora Press, 1988, commented: the 'thermostat' (by official orchestraters) seems to be turned up. During this time, ten new sources emerged - each promising that useful information about UFO crash/retrievals would soon follow. By the end of November, most promises were filled - some were firsthand reports and some second. But more importantly, some provided new backup information for cases cited in my previously published stats reports. Most rewarding was the timely emergence of persons serving in covert positions with substantive information in key areas of my work. Reflecting back, I see in them parallels to the medical sources in 1978 who surfaced and shared graphic descriptive anatomical details of the alien body for release in Status Report II, The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome. [To be reprinted in future Earthfiles.] As a matter of record, this prototype information remains to this day analogous to most reports of alien encounters and is much like the computerized rendition shown in October 1988 on the TV documentary, The UFO Cover-up. Proof? Of course not. Getting close to it? Perhaps. And yes, I'm aware of the adroit arts of misinformation. While I see no evidence of devious game-playing in my current input, nor in some of the material received in the later 1970s and early 1980s, I am aware of another recent suspect annoyance where my name was in blatant public view by a tabloid, the Weekly World News. In its September 20, 1988, issue, I was headlined as an 'expert' having the inside scoop on an alleged alien underground facility in Dulce, New Mexico. Bunkum! Fact is, I have no such scoopy news, but I have heard the rumors about Dulce and the one in Nevada and others. Triggering the tabloid article was a story published in a county weekly newspaper who had covered my talk on UFO crashes at the Milford Public Library near Cincinnati in April 1988. The Weekly World News , however, in picking up the story and my brief reference to Dulce, ignored my statement that such reports could be misinformation. Was I being set up, as some researchers wondered, as a target for ridicule? In this case, for the record, I doubt it, knowing the unscrupulous behavior of the tabloids. Alert to the risk of tabloid exploitation and official machinations that try to maintain secrecy, one treating a sensitive subject like C/R must also expect the unexpected from even 'friendly' quarters. And most often, unexpectedly, from out of the rank-and-file of research comes the sudden strike of a cobra or a 'loop' of such snakes-in-the-grass who try to take one's work and credibility to task and make a big stinking mess of it. Reasons might be many. Is it simply arrogance and a thirst for fame or power? Or is it the work of the orchestraters who pick and choose their lackeys? Whatever the reasons, I have felt their sting since I presented my first paper, Retrievals of the Third Kind at the MUFON Symposium in Dayton, Ohio in 1978. while most of these early adversaries have faded"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"away, little loops persist who employ subtler ways to undermine my work. Haunting me still is a remark by a loop kingpin averring that all my case histories published in my series of Status Reports were 'fairy tales,' thus of no substance. Drawn into his loop is a pundit, a prominent writer in UFO media, who having belittled my work since 1978, has worked well into the scheme. In later years, through his editorial controls, whenever C/R was an issue, my work was simply snubbed. More recently, still another in the loop told a mutual correspondent that my investigations have no depth and that I'm a good subject for misinformation. Obviously, sad to say, these loopers have not done much 'investigation in depth' about my modus operandi or have taken into consideration the lack of funds at my disposal to follow up hundreds of leads coast-to-coast. Also, it is beyond my comprehension how some of my contemporaries can entertain the notion that I have gullibly accepted as valid, or bona fide , every item of C/R material published in my papers. Once again, for the record, the purpose of my Status Reports is to draw in new sources with new information that could either strengthen a case or give reason to drop it in the circular file. It's true that some of the best made plans go awry and it's true that some entries in my monographs have obvious weaknesses. Some, based on new information, have become questionable. Example is Case A-2, Status Report III ([o be reprinted in future Earthfiles]. However, the mainstream material from early sources remains solid and one, I thought, that deserved a full investigation was the Ft. Dix-McGuire case which has become stronger from new information and new sources. Someday, perhaps for the record, I might write a special paper updating the status quo of my published case histories. While the mid to late 1980s did not produce any substantial Crash/Retrieval case histories worthy of a monograph, except the Ft. Dix-McGuire affair, it was not devoid of high points. CASE 1) Pickled Alien Body in Pentagon Glass Tank, 1952 While attending the MUFON Symposium in St. Louis in 1985, Raymond Jordan, a MUFON investigator gave me a confidential lead to follow up involving a lady who had worked at the Pentagon in 1952. He said she had seen an alien body 'pickled' in a glass tank in an 'Off Limits' room. By mistake, she had entered the room, was promptly nabbed and forced to sign papers swearing her to secrecy. When I reached the lady, who was still employed by a government office, she said: 'I know what you're talking about.' Then she added, 'But, I can't talk.' I suggested she communicate by other means to which she replied, 'No. I don't want to talk about it at all.' CASE 2) Marine Guard At \"Disc-Shaped Vehicle,\" 1963 Thanks to Michael Johnstone, a California researcher, who did some good research spade work, it was arranged for me to talk with a former marine who claimed in 1963 that he stood guard at an undisclosed military base which housed a 'disc-shaped vehicle with ovoid cross section, 40 feet across and 13 feet thick at the center.' A more detailed description of the craft appeared in my article, 'The Chase for Proof in a Squirrel's Cage,' published in the British book, UFO's 1947-1987. The marine, who signed a security oath, said that he guarded the secret premises for two weeks while a technical crew, speaking in code, tried every known means to gain entry into the craft, including a laser device. Once he said he observed that it deflected off the curved side of the craft into the rafters causing some damage. 'The public should know the truth about UFOs,' the ex-marine told me. But I felt he knew more than he had cautiously related and would not budge in disclosing the name of the base. CASE 3) Astronaut Says He Saw B&W Film of Alien Bodies On A Slab, 1973 Former military sources with information about witnessing a special movie showing deceased alien bodies surfaced in the late 1970s. These were published in my Status Report II (See Cases A-4 and A-9). [To be reprinted in future Earthfiles.] The viewing of the film was always behind doors and the viewers were few. Then in 1985, Chris Coffey of Cincinnati, Ohio - a close friend of astronaut Ellison Onizuka - revealed to me that she had asked him when they met after one of the astronaut's visits to Wright-Patterson AFB, about his interest in UFOs. Onizuka admitted he kept an open mind on the subject and added that his curiosity was aroused when he and a select group of Air Force pilots at McClelland AFB in 1973 were shown a black-and-white movie film featuring 'alien bodies on a slab.' In his state of shock, he said he remembered saying aloud, 'Oh, my God!' Chris knew of my work in C/R and had arranged for me to meet Onizuka to discuss UFOs after"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"his scheduled flight on the space shuttle, Challenger . As it turned out, fate intervened when the shuttle exploded. CASE 4) Retrieval of Crashed Disk in Mexican Desert, 1948 or 1949? With the confusion among researchers over the number, dates and locations for several alleged UFO crashes on the Texas border with Mexico, and in Mexico, Tom Deuley - who heads the MUFON team in Texas - wrote to me in February 1988 the following excerpts: To m D e u l e y , Te x a s M U F O N : 'Shortly after returning from Washington (MUFON Symposium), my group was challenged to look into the El Indio-Guerrero case that is briefly mentioned in the MJ-12 document. ...I'm writing to ask if you can give us any details or rumors beyond what is printed in your papers. ...I have gone through your works and made copies of everything that might be related to the El Indio case.' My response by letter on February 12, 1988 was: Len Stringfield's reply: '...A few weeks ago, I was sorting out some old correspondence and found a letter dated March 1985, on which I had noted, 'Follow up.' I noted also that I had tried to reach the sender, seeking more information. But I received no reply. So, I tried again in January of this year. Fortunately, this time I was able to reach the son-in-law of the source. Cooperatively, he gave me his phone number. Mr. JA in California. Having a friendly chat with JA, I find no reason to question his sincerity. He was no UFO buff, having no knowledge of current affairs. ...According to JA, he was aboard the USS McKinley, cargo class, the command ship for amphibious operations, docked at San Diego. Many admirals aboard. His job: messenger. The time, he said, was late 1948 or early 1949. It was winter and he remembers a quick cruise to Alaska in between those years. JA was on deck when he learned from the top brass that a small task force was assembled and ordered to go to a certain location (unknown to him) into Mexico to retrieve a crashed 'flying saucer.' They departed by vehicle, but he was not certain if they drove to the site or used other means to reach what was described as a 'remote region of Mexican desert.' The task force was gone for several days and when they returned, he said everything was hushed up. He did, however, hear one of the officers on the mission say that they got some dead bodies and some managed to get away. 'They were able to move at great speed,' he recalls the officer saying. JA never heard more about the saucer or the bodies, but he did remember reading a brief item in a San Diego newspaper about the crash in Mexico.' CASE 5) UFO Crash in St. Geniez, France, 1972? Something unidentified crashed into the rocky slopes of a mountain in the township of St. Geniez, France, March 18, 1972. According to witnesses, it caused brush fires over a forty acre area. Significant was that the incident occurred during a flap of UFO reports in that southeastern part of France. The story was originally obtained by researcher Olivier Rieffel in 1986, during a meeting with Leon Visse, the person identified in Dr. Jean Gille's papers published in Status Report III (See Case B-8). With Visse's disclosure that the crash occurred near the Durance River, Rieffel informed his colleague, Jean Sider, who found in his records that the time and place coincided with a reported crash of a 'space object' into a mountain near the town of Sisteron. According to most witnesses, the UFO was described as a 'red ball' of fire and one informed source who prefers anonymity stated it was 'red-orange, shaped like a disc.' While the investigations continue through the well-coordinated teamwork of Sider and Rieffel, extensive records of their findings were sent to me for appraisal in April 1988. Included was a fragment from the site of a ceramic-like substance appearing that it had been baked by intense heat; three pages of firsthand reports from witnesses who saw the descending red object - among them farmers in the region, including the son of a mayor, a newspaper reporter on the scene and members of the police and fire departments. Of note was an astronomer whose investigations ruled out a meteorite and other meteorological and atmospheric phenomena. Said Sider, 'The facts of the case remain classified in the files of the military and the Nationale Gendarmerie Archives,' adding, 'Confirming all the main details was a member of an intelligence agency who stated that 'something' was received by the Gendarmerie and shipped in a truck to a location near Paris.' Sider emphasized that his report was not conclusive and investigations were still in"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"progress. Listed were many more names of people directly involved that he hoped to trace and interview. CASE 6) Two Alien Humanoid Skeletons in Kentucky, 1987? Far more spectacular, but affording far less supportive evidence than the St. Geniez incident, is the firsthand report from a retired medical doctor who alleges he accidentally found the skeletal remains of two humanoids, possibly of alien origin, on his farm in western Kentucky in March 1987. When informed of the story, I was eventually able to reach the doctor through his friend, Bill Boshears, who first aired it on his radio talk show in Cincinnati. Since the show, he was warned to 'shut up' in no uncertain terms. The doctor, nonetheless, entrusted me with his name, but would not reveal the location of his farm nor give me or anyone else his unlisted phone number. He also advised that some of the details he shared with me about the investigation by the Air Force should be kept confidential. The doctor was cordial when he talked with me on his friend's phone, but brief. He said that it was during a routine evening stroll on his farm property of 400 acres that he discovered the extraordinary evidence. Next to a burned-out circle about 4 feet in diameter in an open grassy field, he found the skeletons of two humanoid entities about 4 feet apart. Without a trace of clothing, some of the bones showed residual ligament with evidence that predators had been at work, he said. As a doctor, he was certain that the bones were not of animal origin and on closer examination, he was shocked to find that the structure was bipedal, about 4 feet tall, with a large skull and cat-like jaw, a barrel-like rib cage with long arms and three fingers. For sure, they were not human. The doctor's next move was to call the sheriff who, without hesitation, called the Air Force. The next morning at sunrise, the doctor said he was surprised to see three helicopters land in a clearing and many people, some in uniform, some not, being deployed over a wide area. Greeting him was a Colonel (name known to me) who cordially introduced himself and stated his mission: remove the bones and undersoil, test and remove the burned circular soil and comb the area for any other evidence. Later in the day, fresh soil was filled in the excavated areas and the doctor was told that the soil in the circle had been baked at 3,000 degrees. When asked about the time factor of body decomposition (allowing for predators), he estimated that the aliens had been exposed for less than a hundred days, based on cursory examination. Reminding me that 'they put the fear of God in me' after his trip to a military base for further interrogation and where he was shown photos of other alien corpses, he expressed interest in my research. I suggested that we lunch together soon. He agreed, but never called. CASE 7) UFO Crash Brown County, Ohio, 1987? News of a UFO crash on a farm in Brown County (Southwestern Ohio) in the Spring of 1987, looked promising at the outset. As I tried to put the pieces of raw information into some order to make the next move, mainly to reach the principle source, I ran into every conceivable roadblock. A year later after 'giving up,' information surfaced from a new source to give credence that something did crash at the farm site. Whatever happened, I could now see through some of the screwiest diversions that blocked me from contacting the farmer who claimed he saw the crashed disc, three small female non-human bodies strewn in the field, and above all else, had some unusual metallic fragments from the debris to prove it. My initial informant was JD, a gemologist and a persevering UFO buff. She got many packages by United Parcel Service on her rural route and learned from the driver that the farmer 'down the road' had pieces of metal from a UFO that crashed on his property. When JD tried to learn the farmer's name and location, the driver got scared. I was later told to avoid the issue, and the UPS driver even changed his route. Undaunted, JD then opted to go to the local police office near the site, hoping to locate the farmer. There, she got the runaround and was advised by one officer to forget the matter. But, according to JD, the officer with the friendly advice later visited her home. For some unexplained reason, he gave her a photo of the farm property. At this point, JD suddenly showed signs of confusion and fear, claiming that her house had been entered, that the photograph of the property had been taken which she had used as a bookmark in a library book (by Major Keyhoe) and that the book was found on the hood"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"of her car in the garage. Next came word that she had been injured in a fall into a sewer hole between her house and garage. The lid had been loosened, she said. Investigating, my son-in-law and I could find nothing else abnormal in her manner of keeping hose. But we began to wonder about her going off the deep-end and if she had become obsessed to a degree of fantasy? Or, was it all a hoax? Or a ploy of disinformation? Time went by without further contact. But I felt that something was strange, something amiss about the case. Concerned, I got in touch with a former Air Force intelligence officer who had the 'right' connections. I asked if he could help throw light on the affair. Two days later, he called back to relate that he had been in touch with the 'right' person and was told that there had been 'no significant UFO sightings in that area for the past year.' He added that my informant would soon be visited by two investigators in an official capacity. Several weeks later, I got a surprise call from JD who said simply, 'I'm not supposed to talk with you, but here I am.' She went on to explain that she had two visitors. In learning she had no hidden metal artifacts, they debunked the crash and also my work in crash/retrieval research and advised in so many words that she should not contact me in the future. Not long after that, JD called me again, admitting that she had met the farmer, had visited the farm, saw the newly added soil over the crash site, and moreover, gave me the farmer's name. She had made plans for him to visit me the following week. He never came, as expected, and a few days later when she called, she regretted to tell me that he had been moved, expenses paid, to Virginia. This, if true, was supposedly his reward for being a good citizen, a real patriot. In April of 1988, a researcher joined by a person knowledgeable in military intelligence operations, visited my home to discuss an abduction case. Inevitably the conversation drifted to crash/retrievals and I mentioned the alleged crash in Brown County. 'Oh, yes,' said my knowledgeable guest, 'I heard that a jet crashed on a farmer's property.' He added, 'It was in an inaccessible area and they had a hard time getting the wreckage out.' A jet? Certainly there had been nothing in the news about a jet crashing the previous spring in that locality. As we all know, airplane crashes of any kind always make news. Of significance, my guest also stated, 'I heard from a good source that the government came in and bought the farm and moved the owner out of town.' Much can be said about this case, pro and con. And I'm also omitting some details that might compromise the positions and activities of certain people involved.\" Continued in Part 2 - UFO Material in Wright-Patterson AFB Building?
