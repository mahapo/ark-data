Air Force Colonel R eturn to previous Part 5 T o be more computer-friendly, the reprint has been divided into parts. Here begins Part 6 of Status Report II, written in January 1980. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report III begins at Earthfiles. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. For all the previous status reports, see Earthfiles Archives. Leonard H. Stringfield: \"CASE A-9: This case, with new supporting information, refers to independent sources who have witnessed the same secret movie at different bases, showing an alleged crashed disc in a desert region and their deceased alien bodies lying on tables, probably in a makeshift state at the same crash site. First, for the record, is edited copy from Abstract # 5 which appeared in my previous paper. Excerpt from Abstract # 5, Status Report I (to be reprinted in upcoming Earthfiles): U. S. Air Force Radar Specialist, Spring 1953: 'Mr. TE, who holds a technical position in today's civilian life, at age twenty was a U. S. Air Force radar specialist with Secret security clearance stationed in Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey. In the spring of 1953, he and a small, select number of radar specialists were summoned to view a film at the base theater. Without any briefing, the 16mm movie projector was flicked on and the film began to roll on the screen. Without any titles or credits that he could recall, the film showed a desert scene dominated by a silver disc-shaped object embedded in the sand with a domed section at the top. At the bottom was a hatch or door that was open. In the next scene, TE recalls seeing 10 to 15 military personnel dressed in fatigues and without identification patches, standing around what appeared to be a disabled craft. By judging their height against the UFO, TE determined that the disc's width was approximately 15 to 20 feet in diameter and that an open hatch or door at the bottom was about 2.5 feet wide and perhaps 3 feet high. At this point, TE had no idea of the movie's purpose. I asked about the activity of the personnel. 'They were just looking at the object,' he said. Then the movie switched to what appeared to be the interior of the craft. A panel with a few simple levers was shown. He remembers being impressed by the muted pastel colors and sudden glares of white - the sign of poor photography. Again there was a change of scenes. Now in view were two tables, probably taken inside a tent on which to his surprise were dead bodies. Two were on one table; one on the other. TE said the bodies appeared little by human standards and most notable were the heads. All heads looked alike and all were large compared to their body sizes. They looked Mongoloid, he thought, with small noses, mouths and eyes that were shut. He did not recall seeing ears or hair. The skin, he said, was ashen in color. Each wore a tight- "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"fitting suit in a pastel color ... yellow was mentioned. The scene of the dead bodies was the end of the movie. When the lights came on in the theater, the officer in charge stood up and instructed the viewers to 'think about the movie,' and added firmly, 'don't relate its contents to anyone.' TE said, in good faith, he did not even tell his wife. To TE's surprise, two weeks later he was approached by an Intelligence Officer on the base and was told, 'Forget the movie you saw. It was a hoax.' Shortly after seeing the movie, he heard from a couple of top security officers on the base that a UFO had crashed in New Mexico and had been recovered with its occupants. The data of the crash was 1952. Commented my informant, 'The 5-minute-long movie certainly was not a Walt Disney production. It was probably shot by an inexperienced cameraman because it was full of scratches and had poor coloring and texture.' TE, when asked about his interest in UFOs, claimed that he was not interested then or now. But he has always been curious about the purpose of the film in relation to his work in radar. Years later, he met an old army acquaintance who was also a radar specialist. To TE's surprise, he learned from this man that he, too, had seen the same film at another base under similar hush-hush conditions. My informant believes that the corpses and crashed craft shown in the movie film were bona fide. We agreed that it would have been ridiculous for a professional studio to have made dummy bodies to look so real in an otherwise ill-prepared and shoddy film.' Following my talk in Dayton, copies of my paper were xeroxed and distributed to key researchers and, in turn, were again amply reproduced for an endless chain of people. As a result, word has come from far afield of others having knowledge of the secret movie film, but one of the more cooperative and well-informed researchers - Mrs. Joan Jeffers of Bradford, Pennsylvania (former RN with degrees in social sciences) - was quick to come to the challenge for help. When she read the TE report, she discussed it with a former high ranking military officer who was a friend of hers. He acknowledged that he, too, had seen the same film. Furthermore, she obliged by getting testimony from the officer for use in this Status Report II . That testimony was dated February 6, 1979, and is reprinted below: February 6, 1979, Retired U. S. Air Force Colonel: ' Dear Len ... At last I am able to put this information in a letter to you. You have my permission to use it in publication of your work. Last summer while I was relating some of the reported highlights of the MUFON symposium, I mentioned the movie of the crashed disc and alien beings. An acquaintance of mine offered a few additional details, but it took several more weeks to get more information from him. This man is a retired Air Force Colonel, who enlisted in the early 1940s and retired about 1970. He entered the cadet program and the major portion of his military career was as a pilot, though he held several other jobs during the many years. He does not want his name released. Therefore, I must leave out some identifying details, but they are in my files. When stationed at a Maine AF radar facility (which is now strictly a Navy Air Station), this man was required to attend weekly 'Commander's Call.' One week (probably) in 1956, the men were shown a movie 'filmed by the USAF' - no further credits. The movie showed a circular, metal silvery disc on the ground. The inside was well lighted, of a light color and with smooth walls. The scene shifted to show at least three bodies lying on tables. The beings were short, all looked alike and did not have any ears (external) or hair. All appeared to be dead. When I asked the color of their skin, the reply was 'ashen or gray.' I asked the number of digits on their hands and he held up four fingers with his thumb tucked out of sight. I asked if they did not have a thumb and his reply was affirmative. Next, I questioned him about the clothing and he said it was 'pale green and yellow.' I asked several other general questions, but he refused to answer, or said he did not recall. I asked if the men were told anything about the movie before, during or after the showing. He said they were not. I asked the reaction of the men who had viewed the movie with him. He said, 'We probably laughed about it and left.' He does not recall ever discussing it with"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"any of the others. All material presented at these meetings was considered military business and not to be discussed. Some weeks later, I again asked him why they had shown that particular group the movie and his response was that a UFO we were tracking had crashed. That was all I could get out of him. This event was 23 or more years ago, but this man has good recall of other events and incidents from that time. He has held responsible positions in local business and is generally of good character. He is retired as disabled. Though he does not believe the government would arrest or fine him, he will not reveal anything more, although I do know from past conversations that he has a great deal of information about AF investigations of UFOs. I have supplied you with the name and possible present location of the man who was commander of this base ... Joan Jeffers (signed) ' STRINGFIELD COMMENT: With only the slightest variances, both the Colonel's and TE's reports described the same film. Showing of the film might have been to limited personnel on a 'need to know' basis, but it seems that it appeared at a number of military bases. Not, too, that the Air Force Major (Case A-4) recalls having witnessed part of the film at an undisclosed base. Other former military personnel who might have seen the film have been named by Mrs. Jeffers from her source for follow-up. One, a Lt. Colonel, was reached by researcher Stan Friedman. But he did not recall having seen the movie. However, he said, 'If your source would get in touch with me he might refresh my memory.' I called the other officer in May of 1979, who still works at Wright-Patterson AFB following his military career. Evasively he responded, 'If I saw it, I can't remember it.' I cannot believe that the movie used make-believe cadavers and was a trick on a select group of personnel holding the highest degree of security clearance. Once again, the faces of the three humanoids in the movie were described as identical, a characteristic noted by the Air Police Sergeant in Case A-2 and the former C.I.A. official in Case A-6. Of note, the C.I.A.-sponsored Robertson Panel met in January 1953, dictating that all military UFO reports be suppressed. UFO retrieval operations and movies got rigorous treatment which presumably still seal the lips of informants to this day. CASE A-10: In light of new information surfacing about an alleged crash and retrieval of an alien craft near Roswell, New Mexico in 1947, the following case was published in Abstract # 18 of my previous Status Report I and is certainly not in itself unusual. But it merits review as it might provide useful testimony for researchers. On April 7, 1978, Steve Tom - an NBC radio newsman in Chicago - and I were linked up by phone for an interview with a former Air Force Intelligence Officer, Major Jesse Marcel, who lived in Houma, Louisiana. Major Marcel, I learned, shared some common ground with me. He had also served in the 5th Air Force in the Pacific Theater during World War II and had been in several combat areas such as Leyte, Philippine Islands, where I had been assigned. The purpose of our call was to obtain firsthand the Major's confirmation of his role in the retrieval of an alleged crashed UFO northwest of Roswell, New Mexico, in the summer of 1947. The debris of an apparent metallic aerial device or craft that had exploded in the air, or crashed, was first made known by a sheep rancher (Mac Brazel) who found fragments of metal and other material on his 8,000 acre property. When he informed the Air Force base in Roswell of his discovery, Major Marcel and aides were dispatched to the area for investigation. There, he found many metal fragments and what appeared to be 'parchment' strewn in a 1-mile-square area. 'The metal fragments,' said the Major, 'varied in size up to 6 inches in length, but were of the thickness of tinfoil. the fragments were unusual,' he continued, 'because they were of great strength. They could not be bent or broken, no matter what pressure we applied by hand.' The area was thoroughly checked, he said, but no fresh impact depressions were found in the sand. The area was not radioactive. The fragments, he added were transported by a military carry-all to the Air Base in Roswell and from that point he was instructed by General Roger A. Ramey, Chief of the Air Defense Command, to deliver the 'hardware' to Ft. Worth, Texas, to be forwarded to Wright-Patterson"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Field, Ohio, for analysis. When the press learned of this retrieval operation and wanted a story, Major Marcel stated, 'To get them off my back, I told them we were recovering a downed weather balloon.' Since the Major's story got publicity, it has been said by some researchers that the retrieved fragments were possibly a part of the Skyhook balloon. At that time, it was classified as Secret. On October 5, 1979, I called Jesse Marcel and got this comment: Major Jesse Marcel, U. S. Air Force Intelligence Officer in 1947: 'The material I gathered did not resemble anything off a balloon. A balloon of any kind could not have exploded and spread its debris over such a broad area. ...I was told later that a military team from my base was sent to rake the entire area.' STRINGFIELD COMMENT: If there were entities aboard, they could have been destroyed in what appeared to be a violent aerial explosion. In 1979, the book The Philadelphia Experiment uncovered new data about another legendary mystery concerning a warship being invisibly teleported during a Navy experiment in 1943. The authors were Charles Berlitz and William Moore, who are ready for another expose far removed from sea lore. The theme concerns an alleged crash of a UFO in 1947 near Roswell, New Mexico. Thus, there might be a tie-in with the account offered by Major Jesse Marcel. Bill Moore told me during a private meeting in Cincinnati in July 1979, that he had uncovered some good firsthand data about the 1947 crash. In trust, he related some of his material and if his informants are as reliable as he alleges, then the Air Force long ago had evidence to back up and make policy about the incursive UFO.\" To be continued in Part 7 - An update about the Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, UFO crash/retrieval Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
