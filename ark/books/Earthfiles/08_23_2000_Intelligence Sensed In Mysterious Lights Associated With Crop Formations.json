People in formation did not seem aware of the mysterious light seen and videotaped © 1999 by Donald Fletcher of London. August 23, 2000 Wilcot, Wiltshire, England - On August 12, 2000 before we climbed Woodborough Hill to watch for mysterious lights, graphic artist, Andy Buckley, and his partner, Hazel, and I met at The Golden Swan pub in Wilcot, Wiltshire to talk about the intelligence in the mysterious lights each has sensed the past few years. Andy has a dozen videotapes of light phenomena associated with the crop formations, both day and night. His most dramatic July 18, 2000 videotape from Pickled Hill down into the wheat field below Woodborough Hill shows at least six small, white objects that closely resemble the white object in the photograph above by Donald Fletcher of London. On August 7, 1999, Donald was videotaping with his camcorder in the Barbury Castle triple crescents formation when his eyes caught a glimpse of two white objects, one moving especially fast. He focused his camera on that fast object and got about thirty seconds on tape of it traveling over the formation. As the object passed low over the tramlines, it appeared to be about the size of a football - a size in the 12 to 15 inch range with which Andy Buckley would agree. Interview: \"My belief is that the mysterious lights could be there all the time in greater numbers and in some kind of invisible "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"state in another frequency...\" - Andy Buckley, Graphics Artist Wilcot, England, August 12, 2000 Andy Buckley, Graphics Artist, and his partner, Hazel, Wilcot, England: \"I think the lights that appear are actually quite common if you know where to look for them and when to go out. They can be seen quite frequently. IS THERE A TIME PERIOD FOR NIGHT WATCHING YOU FAVOR? Most of the objects that I have videotaped probably happened between 9 and 11 PM in the evening. But I wouldn't say there is any specific time period when they appear. That's usually the time I like to go out, but I do know lights have been seen during the day and later at night and throughout the year. Some have been seen in the winter. OF YOUR DOZEN VIDEOTAPED SEQUENCES OF MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS, HOW MANY ARE IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC AREA? Most of the lights have been seen in the Vale of Pewsey which stretches roughly from Devizes through to Pewsey and beyond on both sides of the valley. WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU VIDEOTAPED? Several places: Knap Hill, Woodborough Hill, Martinsell Hill and sometimes in the Everleigh direction. But Knap Hill and Woodborough Hill, in that general area, seem to be active spots to see lights. IN ADDITION TO THE DRAMATIC JULY 18, 2000 VIDEOTAPE YOU GOT OF THE SIX LIGHTS AND HELICOPTER AT WOODBOROUGH HILL, IS THERE ANOTHER INCIDENT THAT STANDS OUT IN YOUR MIND? Possibly one incident occurred in 1993 which I think was the first time I witnessed an unusual light down here, so I have fond memories of it and did manage to videotape it which was July 31, 1993 at about half past 9 PM from Knap Hill. I had gone for a sky watch and saw this light that appeared still in daylight. It was a bright orange-white light that was oval shaped and it was moving across from west to east. It was a case I investigated quite intensely. I had the videotape analyzed and it was pretty good footage. There were reference points in the field of view and it was not a satellite nor meteor nor anything like that. It was certainly an unidentified flying object. SOME PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE SENSE OF SOMETHING STARING BACK AT THEM WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE INTELLIGENCE. HAVE YOU HAD ANY OF THAT SENSE WHEN YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING OR VIDEOTAPING MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS? Yes, my view is that I have an interaction with the lights, although it's quite difficult to explain because it's a very personal experience that I have. But I've found that most objects have appeared when there's a certain state of mind. It's quite difficult to explain, but I've always felt the lights seem to respond to a sort of positive state of mind. I have gone out not feeling particularly positive about seeing anything and nothing happens. When I've been in a fairly optimistic frame of mind, the lights seem to appear. There also seems to be an interaction between the lights. I've noticed that in quite a few cases, the lights seem to resist"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"being filmed. When video equipment is packed away, they seem to appear. When video cameras are pointing at them, they seem to shy away and not appear very frequently. Although that tends to contradict the other incident that I described (July 18, 2000). The interactive aspect is quite interesting, but also quite disturbing because it seems that the objects do respond to certain thought patterns or states of mind. Quite which way this works, I don't know. There's also a condition called the 'Oz Factor.' I think it's from the Wizard of Oz. I think it has something to do with the fact that shortly before a sighting occurs, there's a certain atmosphere that occurs where everything goes completely quiet and silent. You seem to be highly aware of your surroundings and it's almost as if you're in a kind of dream state. And certainly, I've had this experience not only with the lights, but with the appearance of crop formations. So, there may be a connection there. Certainly, this atmosphere has appeared. But also the lights do seem to cause certain mental or physical conditions as well. There are times when lights have appeared and maybe you can sense them in a kind of almost physical way. The atmosphere changes. The temperature maybe changes. Air pressure changes. That kind of thing. That might be coincidence or it may be the result of the lights themselves, particularly if they are plasma-based. They could cause some kind of ionization effect on the air around them. But I have the impression that the lights are intelligently controlled in the sense that they do seem to respond to thought patterns and thoughts put out towards them. IF YOU WERE SPECULATING BASED ON WHAT YOU HAVE FELT, WHAT DO YOU THINK THEIR PURPOSE IS? WHAT ARE THE LIGHTS? THEIR SOURCE? That's something I have been researching for many years now. I don't have any specific view or theory as to the origin of these lights. There are obviously various theories around, everything from natural phenomenon such as earth lights to craft that are extraterrestrial or other dimensional. I think on the basis of my own research, I would say there is definitely something more to the lights that would take them beyond just a natural or earth light phenomenon. Although, it could be that how the lights operate depends on certain atmospheric or geological conditions in the area. It may be that there are certain magnetic states that exist which may influence the appearance of these lights and how they operate. But, from my own observation, it does appear that there is some kind of purpose or intelligence. HAVE YOU EVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING THAT WOULD FALL INTO THE CATEGORY OF TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION WITH THESE LIGHTS? Yes, in the sense that I seem to have a kind of extra-sensory awareness of them about when and where they are likely to appear. It's difficult to quantify. I would love have really good equipment, technology, to try to measure some of these responses. Some researchers have used technology and come up with some interesting results relating to the use of meditation, or the use of certain thought images in relationship to these lights. And also, they have been captured on infrared and other kinds of film other than normal film that tends to suggest they can exist in the invisible state. I'm not talking only about lights that I have actually seen, but my belief is that these objects could be there all the time in greater numbers and in some kind of invisible state in another frequency or whatever. So, that's something that's quite interesting. WHEN YOU HAVE THE SENSE THAT THEY MIGHT BE THERE OR ABOUT TO BECOME VISIBLE, DO YOU CONCENTRATE ON ANY"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"KIND OF SPECIFIC MENTAL IMAGE YOURSELF IN ORDER TO ILLICIT THE INTERACTION? Yeah, I drew up a kind of list of conditions that I thought were conducive to lights appearing. I've also found that it's not just an intellectual response, but also certain emotional states seem to work. Certainly conditions are that a high degree of concentration is required. WHAT WOULD BE AN EMOTIONAL STATE THAT HAS WORKED FOR YOU? Possibly a need for, or desire for, something to happen, whether it's a light or other happening. I don't know how it relates to the appearance of these things because it's very difficult to quantify. Obviously, you can be in a positive state of mind and nothing happens. And you can be in a really bad mood or low state of mind and something happens. But I think in all this, it's a certain focusing of concentration or a certain awareness of one's own state and the kind of shutting off of outside distractions which I find is quite important. I've had more success in seeing the lights when I've been able to focus and concentrate without a lot of distractions. ROBBERT IN HOEVEN, HOLLAND, HE HAS DESCRIBED A SENSE THAT THE LIGHTS ARE ANGELIC AND THAT THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS. HE SAYS THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH 'DECEIT' AND THAT THE CROP FORMATIONS ARE AN 'ANTIDOTE' TO THE DECEIT. DOES ANY OF THAT MAKE ANY SENSE TO YOU BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCES WITH THE LIGHTS? Yes, in the sense that I feel that my own belief is that the intelligence in the light consciousness, or whatever you want to call it, can read our thoughts. I think it's aware of how we are with regard to the idea that the lights may be related to angels or devic beings or nature spirits. I find that quite interesting and not something I originally entertained. I was very dubious about those kinds of ideas. I was very much into the idea that it was rather nuts and bolts phenomena or it was natural phenomena. But having experienced these objects and researched these other theories, I find there could be a lot of interesting correlation between these ideas and the lights. I feel the lights are related to the environment, to the landscape - not just in this area, but in other parts of the country and other countries across the globe where these lights have been seen. HAVE YOU EVER HAD A SIGHTING OF SOMETHING THAT FELL INTO THE CRAFT CATEGORY OR AN EXPERIENCE WITH AN ENTITY IN A FIELD, HOME OR ANY OTHER CONTACT? Not personally. I originally started researching the whole subject in 1972. I was an amateur astronomer at the time. A lot of objects I witnessed occurred in the 1970s. A lot of lights I witnessed were lights in the sky or luminosities. However, in the late 1970s, I did witness possibly two or three objects that were more in the category of structured craft. They were obviously quite large in shape carrying lights and were not clearly aircraft. What they were, is another matter. I GET THE SENSE THAT MAYBE YOU HAVE HAD EXPERIENCES, HAZEL? Hazel and I were doing a sky watch at the foot of Knap Hill and while this was going on, a larger sky watch was taking place just across the field on Woodborough Hill. They were seeing quite a few orange lights maneuvering at"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the end of the valley. We did see some lights in that area. But from about 9:30 PM onwards, we saw in the Everleigh direction on the other side of the valley, very orange lights that kept appearing and disappearing. They only stayed in view for a few seconds. I had a video camera on a tripod and every time I tried to film the objects, they just disappeared. So, after a period of maybe an hour, Hazel made a comment to me ... Hazel: 'If the camera was in the bag, maybe the lights would actually appear.' I said something like that. We waited a little longer and decided maybe nothing was going to happen. So, Andy packed up the camera. Then I said, 'It's all right, now. You can come. He's just put the camera away.' And a few seconds later, a very large ball of orange light appeared over the hill where the other lights had been appearing. It gradually moved along to the right and as I was looking at it, I felt it was homing in on me and communicating with my brain or trying to take something out of my brain. It was quite alarming at the time. It rather spooked me for a while after that. I felt there was definitely some kind of interaction going on and I wasn't sure I liked what was happening. CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT YOU WERE FEELING WHEN IT WAS AS IF SOMETHING WERE GOING OUT OF YOUR MIND? Yes, it was definitely like a probe. Something was present in my head and was trying to take something out of me. That's the thing that spooked me because I wasn't quite sure what it was doing and I didn't like the feeling at all. I got this feeling in the center of my forehead. There wasn't any pain, but just a strange feeling as I was looking at the lights. I was rather transfixed by the lights, so maybe there was some connection between me actually looking at it and its communicating that way. DID YOU FEEL LIKE SOMETHING WAS BUZZING OR VIBRATING IN YOUR MIND WHEN YOU HAD THE IMPRESSION OF SOMETHING GOING OUT? No, I wouldn't say that anything was actually buzzing. It just felt as if it were draining from me. It was a very strange feeling. DID YOU HAVE ANY VISUAL IMPRESSIONS ALONG WITH THE FEELING? No, I don't recall having any visual impressions. WHAT HAPPENED? Possibly because I started to feel fear, the lights did go out and it stopped. It just blinked out like the lights do tend to do. And as it blinked out, the feeling stopped. HOW BIG DO YOU THINK THE ORANGE LIGHT WAS? It's very difficult to say what size it was because it was quite a distance away from us. On a scale of these normal orange luminosities, this was a fairly large one. WAS IT THE GLOWING ORANGE SPHERE AS OPPOSED TO TRANSLUCENT? Yes. It was not the translucent variety. It was the orange ball of light."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"ANDY, DO YOU HAVE ANY HARD EVIDENCE OR KNOW ANYONE WHO HAS HARD EVIDENCE THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AND AMERICAN GOVERNMENT ARE WORKING TOGETHER FROM SATELLITES IN TERMS OF MONITORING CERTAIN HERTZ FREQUENCIES THAT MIGHT BE RELATED TO THESE LIGHTS AND THEN SCRAMBLING HELICOPTERS OR JETS TO WHERE THE LIGHTS APPEAR? I'm not particularly knowledgeable about the satellite monitoring of a crop formation or lights, but my own observations in this area make me absolutely convinced that the military are aware of the objects and obviously the crop formations. They fly over the crop formations every day. The response to the appearance of these light objects is extremely rapid, within minutes. I've experienced interceptions between helicopters and lights. This has also been captured on film. Other people have witnessed this apart from myself. There is a lot of military activity in the area which is very close to the Salisbury Plain. There is a certain degree of military maneuvers and training that goes on involving helicopters, but of course, it's also a convenient cover for them to observe these objects and not draw attention to themselves. Certainly, there have been incidents where the helicopters and lights have been caught together on film. I've investigated this. I've written to the Ministry of Defence and the Army. Of course, they are going to deny it on the record. Off the record is a different story, however. I think they are quite prepared to admit that something is happening. Whether the objects are - how they are related to the military is another matter. I wouldn't know about that. But certainly the military are aware the objects exist and monitor their activity. WHAT HAVE PEOPLE TOLD YOU OFF THE RECORD? I've spoken to one pilot who was a helicopter pilot and he made a comment that they were aware that these objects existed. He didn't go into great detail. And obviously, the crop formations. The helicopters have quite sophisticated equipment to detect the objects of these objects on radar and they presumably can intercept them quite quickly. WHY WOULD THE MILITARY BE THREATENED BY WHITE OR ORANGE BALLS OF LIGHT THAT MAKE CROP FORMATIONS? I wouldn't think they were threatened by them. I think the lights could possibly have defense implications in that they are violating air space quite close to a sensitive military area in the Salisbury Plain. Any unidentified objects that appear in this area are going to be very closely monitored. Some would say the objects are military in origin. Of course, that's another issue. I don't feel they are, but the military are definitely aware of the objects. Perhaps the lights create certain magnetic anomalies in the area. It's very close to air corridors that are used by military aircraft. Perhaps if the military suffers instrument failure, maybe they need to know what and where these objects are for their own protection. HAS ANYBODY IN THE MILITARY OR GOVERNMENT TALKED TO YOU OFF THE RECORD ABOUT ANY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE PURPOSE OF THE CROP FORMATIONS IF DONE BY ANOTHER INTELLIGENCE? Not to me personally. I don't know about other people. But, I investigated my own sightings and have written to the MOD and military bases in the area. They've shown interest in the existence of the objects. They wanted to view video footage that I have taken."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"HAVE YOU SHOWN IT TO THEM? No. (laughs) I just feel they already have enough footage of their own. They don't need my footage. WOULD YOUR CONCERN BE THAT THEY MIGHT END UP CONFISCATING YOUR TAPE? No, I think they have enough footage of their own. I think some are interested in keeping a watch on researchers in this area. Of that, I'm absolutely convinced. I would say they are probably not keen on researchers and people who interact with this phenomenon. The authorities have their own agenda and I think maybe they resent independent researchers in this area and the fact that we can step on their feet. I don't know. WHAT IF THERE IS SOME KIND OF ENCODED MATHEMATICAL LANGUAGE IN THE CROP FORMATIONS AND ALREADY HAVE SOME GLIMMER OF WHAT IS BEHIND THE FORMATIONS? They may have the information. It's interesting that this kind of phenomenon appears almost on the doorstep of one of the largest military ranges in England. I don't see how the military could fail to be aware of the crop circle phenomenon. I would say that they have probably been researching, certainly the mysterious lights phenomenon, probably thirty years in Wiltshire. DO YOU HAVE HARD KNOWLEDGE ABOUT RESEARCH GOING BACK THAT FAR? Yes, because the objects that are appearing currently in the Vale of Pewsey I'm sure are the same kind of objects appearing in the Warminster area in the 1960s. I do feel there is a real connection between the Warminster phenomenon and the phenomenon that is now appearing here in the sense that the objects seen are very similar in description. In Warminster, the military did research the phenomenon there. Of course, Warminster has a large military presence there as well. THE 1960S EVENTS IN WARMINSTER WERE PUT IN THE CATEGORY OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTERFACE WITH EARTH. DO YOU THINK THERE IS A SHIFT IN YOUR MIND OR GOVERNMENT THINKING THAT PERHAPS THE LIGHTS MIGHT BE IN ANOTHER CATEGORY? I think the jury is still out on that as far as the origins of the crop circles and the lights. I remain agnostic. There are so many theories ranging from extraterrestrial to inter-dimensional to earth light natural phenomena. But in the Warminster area, it is interesting that the crop circles had their origin or genesis in the Warminster area. That is not something that is widely published, but certainly in the late 1960s in association with the appearance of unidentified objects in the Warminster area. There were ground markings, fairly simple, but they were there. It could be that some kind of migration occurred with the phenomenon for some reason to this area (of Wiltshire). Although crop formations do still appear near Warminster, but to a lesser extent. The UFO phenomenon is still appearing in that area. I'm sure the military is aware of that fact. Then there are the writings of Arthur Shuttlewood. He was the prime author and journalist in the area at the time. Although a lot of people find his books very controversial and some have written him off as a crank, I think reading between"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"the lines, he was very prophetic in what he wrote in his books. Certainly, in regard to the phenomenon not being necessarily of extraterrestrial origin. Arthur Shuttlewood did mention in some of his books that there could be a stranger origin for these lights, perhaps. LIKE OTHER DIMENSIONAL OR ANGELIC? Possibly, yes. And also he related the appearance of the lights to possible ground markings and crop formations which were innovative at the time before crop circle researchers appeared on the scene.\" We b s it e : http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/ Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
