Book Excerpt: On May 2, 1999 a delicate \"machine\" appeared outlined in the dense, yellow oilseed rape flowers in a field at Milk Hill near Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, England. According to one eyewitness, it was not there on the morning of May 2. Helen Robinson, a member of the Wiltshire Crop Circle Research Group, had visited the beautiful, yellow field that morning. Helen left for lunch and returned in the afternoon. She climbed to the White Horse overlooking the field. To her \"utter amazement\" there was the brand new formation next to older circles from April 4th. Charles Mallett, a crop formation researcher from Horton, said, \"I planned to sleep in the end ring which had a large standing tuft in the center. Nothing in particular happened. It gets dark around half past ten. It's clear, nice night, dark. And then suddenly, it felt quite surreal. I don't know why.\" \"What do you mean, 'surreal?'\" \"It's kind of like being detached. It's hard to explain. It's so internal. Just slightly out of sync. I could hear the roads about a quarter of a mile out in front of me. I can hear the cars and animals all around, but it all feels slightly away, slightly detached in some way. \"I sit there for a couple of hours, up until around midnight or 12:30 AM. I take a look up to Sirius, the brightest star in the sky. I look down and all of a sudden there's a bright, diffused luminosity. It's a sphere about ten to fifteen meters in front of me. It's just above ground level behind the standing center which is about two feet across with thick stalks and I can see between them. The stalks are in "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"silhouette. This light is behind them and next to the back wall of the circle. I sat and watched this fully up to a minute and a half. I had my camera next to me and it didn't even occur to me to pick it up. I should have.\" Yellowish-white glowing sphere Charles Mallett saw suddenly appear behind oilseed rape in Milk Hill formation, May 1999. The light stayed for more than a minute. Drawing © 1999 by Charles Mallett. \"Did the light move at all?\" \"There was hardly any motion. Very, very slight, but really no motion. And it was yellowish-white, diffused with a hint of orange and appeared to be self-luminous. But it wasn't casting a bright light at all. It was glowing, but very localized. I had enough time to shift my position, move away from the standing center so I could look around and it was definitely there. I'm actually sleeping in these crop circles, hoping for some kind of direct interaction with whatever is doing this stuff and my mind goes blank. All I seemed able to do was watch and observe what was going on right in front of me. After a minute and half or whatever - long enough to be absolutely sure that this object is there - it just faded out over about two seconds to nothing.\" \"Did you ever feel like the light tried to communicate to your mind?\" \"No, no, I'm pretty sure I was in control of my mind. But I had rather strange, almost spooky sensations for about fifteen or twenty minutes before I saw anything. That was quite weird, a heady, slightly phased out of reality feeling even before I saw the light. I considered leaving the crop circle because it was so strange. Yet, I'm used to sleeping in crop circles and on the hills in this area. Even though sometimes it gets a little strange, I have never had any feelings of negativity from whatever is responsible for the formations. Quite the opposite, in fact. The crop circles seem to have a hugely positive affect on most people that come in contact with them. \"I didn't feel I was threatened when this light was there. As soon as the light showed up, I was transfixed and quite excited. It's right in front of me, what I've been looking for. I think it was like if you were in an enclosed space and you can hear things going on around you outside, it's slightly worrying. But, it's not nearly as worrying when you can actually see what's going on. The feeling of a presence is quite strange. But if you can see, it's not nearly as strange.\" Frances added, \"The same night in May (1999) that Charlie saw his sphere, I was at the belly of the White Horse at Alton Barnes with a friend of mine and we were staying the night overlooking the field that Charlie was in. About 10:30 PM or maybe a bit later, two lights appear very bright in the field where Charlie was in the rape seed formation. And if you've ever been into rape, it is so difficult. You make so much noise. You can crunch the stems so easily. But that"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"night right above the rape, these two or three lights flashed on, went off, flashed on, went off. And that was it. Until about a half hour later, I saw these streaks of light - a bit like smoke. They didn't have a source. They were just streaking down about the same place as the formation. The streaks were almost working their way down from the top of the formation to the bottom. Three mysterious lights Frances Mallett and her friend saw to the left of the Milk Hill, Wiltshire, oilseed rape formation the same night in May 1999 that Charles Mallett encountered a sphere of light inside this formation.

He said, 'You will not believe what I saw in here last night!' We said, 'We saw some lights in this field, too!'\" More Information: Charles and Frances Mallett in the garden at the Barge Inn, Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, England, August 1, 1999.

Charles Mallett told me he works as a Care Officer in the region of Horton, Wiltshire where he lives with Frances and her two children from a previous relationship. Charles goes to the homes of elderly and disabled people to help with shopping and housekeeping. He was born in the 1970s in Devon where he dropped out of school at sixteen. He said, \"I have been on a very interesting and sometimes very deep search in the last few years for some truth about many aspects of life and reality. Crop circles seemed to act as a catalyst for my search.\" Frances was born in Lockeridge not far from Alton Barnes in the heart of Wiltshire crop circle country. She studied interior design in college and likes to watercolor the formations and their geometries. She also works for a non-profit"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"charity trying to help alleviate the poverty in northern Albania and Kosovo. They married in 1998 and have lived in Horton between Roundway and Alton Barnes where they are close to the crop circles each summer. Excerpt and images from: Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles .
