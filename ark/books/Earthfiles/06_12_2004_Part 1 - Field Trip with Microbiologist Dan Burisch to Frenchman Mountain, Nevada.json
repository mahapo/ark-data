June 11, 2004 Las Vegas, Nevada - In 1989, 25-year-old Danny B Crain graduated from the State University of New York, Stonybrook with a Ph.D. in Microbiology and Molecular Genetics. Dr. Crain was at the same time employed by the U. S. Navy's DOD Naval Research Laboratory. His rank was Captain and his title Microbiologist IV. A year later in 1990, he married Deborah Kay Burisch who had a child from a previous marriage. Five years later in 1995, Danny B Crain legally changed his last name to Burisch to match the child's legal last name. Between 1991 and 1994, Dr. Burisch began an extraordinary assignment five floors underground the Papoose Mountain range at S-4/5, Area 51, Nellis AFB in Nevada. Dr. Burisch says he was suited up in astronaut-type gear to enter a highly classified and secure clean sphere filled with an atmosphere of cold hydrogen, argon and other gases. That atmosphere was allegedly created to house what his superiors said was a time traveling extraterrestrial biological entity. According to Dr. Burisch, his microbiology research with the being was reported to his Majestic 12 and MAJI Committee government employers, an extension of the Majestic-12 Special Studies Group organized by President Harry S. Truman in 1947. Majestic 12 included top scientific, military and business leaders asked by President Truman to study the extraterrestrial phenomenon. In those years, Dr. Burisch says he extracted more than 300 tissue samples from the arm of the extraterrestrial called \"J-Rod.\" The name derived from the creature pointing at "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"computer keyboard symbols for the letter \"J\" and for the rod-like inertia symbol. According to the entity's telepathic communication, the combined hieroglyphic symbols mean the number fifteen in his civilization which relates to the 15.2 light year distance from Earth to the star in our Milky Way Galaxy known as Gleise 876. Around that star, according to J-Rod, orbits a planet on which some of his species have based themselves. Our own Earth astronomers have discovered at least two planets orbiting Gleise 876. According to Dr. Burisch, he received telepathic communication from the J-Rod about serious medical problems that were forcing his species to extinction and which brought them back to Earth - their original home - in a mind-boggling effort to change a time line problem in our human present - and the J-Rods' ancient past. Dr. Burisch describes the J-Rod's medical problem as a \"peripheral neuropathy,\" which causes serious nerve damage. From all the tissue extractions, Dr. Burisch and his other microbiology colleagues were trying to develop a treatment that might help the time travelers and change a potentially dangerous Earth future. Interview: Danny B Burisch, Ph.D., Microbiologist, during 1991-1994 at S-4/5, Area 51, Groom Lake, Nellis AFB, Nevada: \"We would undergo a medical examination, at least during the early time frame of the introductions of the 1991 to 1992 time frame when we were doing introductions. We had regular systematic medicals by physicians. Following that, we would be suited first, catheterized, plugged and suited. A communication apparatus was placed on our heads. There was a cooling system set up. For all intents and purposes, it was a space suit, a total encapsulated suit something like what you would find in a NASA facility. Not so much something you would see, for instance, at CDC (Centers for Disease Control)- not that type of Level 4 suit. It was more a regular space-type suit with joints. We were suited up, we were pressurized and then walked with our cooling system and our hosing down a ramp into the Ambassadorial Suite (where J-Rod kept). Following that, we were lead up a gantry way which had been moved into position by the Clean Sphere, which had been previously rotated up through an iris through the floor. He (J-Rod) was held actually below the Ambassadorial Suite level and that was raised up as needed. What they did with him down there, he did not say. And they (bosses) did not tell me. It was not a need-to-know issue. Apparently that's where they dealt with the cleaning of the Sphere and all that down there. It was regular housed-animal maintenance, as they treated him. We would be lead up the gantry way. The hoses would be hooked into an interior system inside the doorway that was exterior to the Clean Sphere. And it was called 'Six Degree System.' We would be lead in. The door would be closed and we would be pressurized inside of the gantry way. Following that, there was a drug system that was set up. Once there was an equal pressurization between the gantry way and the Clean Sphere, we would then be told to proceed forward. I would raise a hand in acknowledgment. We were not supposed to talk at the time at all because nothing verbal around the specimen, around the J-Rod. Why (no verbal)? I was never told, but we were not supposed to talk around the J-Rod. I moved the drug system and re-hooked a secondary set of hosing inside the Clean Sphere, checked the pressurization and once that was done, the door to the Clean Sphere would be closed behind me and I would presume that the pressurization remained the same in the gantry way. Following that I would do my business inside the Clean Sphere involving contact with the J-Rod and removing the samples (from the J-Rod.)\" Convergent Timelines Paradox But Dr. Burisch became upset when he was asked to apply what he was learning to biological weapons research. In a whistle-blowing effort in the summer and fall of 2002, he began to leak information to Bill Hamilton, long time UFO investigator and former Executive Director of Skywatch International. That year, Bill confidentially played for me audiotaped and videotaped interviews of Dr. Burisch talking about his J-Rod research and the complicated threat that has come to be known as the Doctrine of Convergent Timelines Paradox. Dr. Burisch said he thought the public deserved to know that by December 2012, the uncorrected J-Rod problem could mean a disaster for Earth and humanity. Dr. Burisch said there was a problem in Time itself that the J-Rods were trying to repair in order to prevent"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"a global catastrophe. Dr. Burisch said he understood that the J-Rods' deteriorating physical condition was the result of a disaster that had already occurred on Earth that the J-Rods preceded Homo sapiens sapiens. The catastrophe - past and future - came from one, two or three events - or all three together. Those included a very large energy flare from the sun at the same time our solar system encountered a swarm of naturally occurring mini-black holes, also called worm holes. A third event at the same time might have been a nuclear war on Earth. The destructive energy of all that happening split the Earth's time line into two branches that allegedly still loop and circle each other to this day. According to Dr. Burisch's understanding of the time paradox, the DNA-damaged J-Rods evolved down one of the split time lines and deteriorated into small, grey and brown skinned humanoids with four fingers and large black eyes that faced eventual extinction. On the other time line, another group of original humans evolved physically and spiritually stronger as a blond Nordic-looking race based in the stars of the Orion constellation belt. According to Dr. Burisch, if not repaired, the looping time line problem means that the Earth would keep experiencing cyclic destructions unless the loop is straightened out. Allegedly, our American government has been communicating with the J-Rods through a series of treaties every nine years since 1958. Everyone has allegedly been trying to figure out how to prevent a current 2012 Earth catastrophe that would doom most humans and time travelers. On June 7, 2003, Bill Hamilton was given permission by Dr. Burisch to videotape him talking again about the J-Rod, clean sphere, and time paradox. The full transcript is published as a 3-part Earthfiles report with illustrations. Today, Dr. Burisch has been diagnosed with a heart condition and negotiated a deal with his government handlers to retire on June 1, 2004, from official government service to MJ-12 and the MAJI Committee. With that recent retirement, he allowed me and half a dozen others to go on a field trip with him in Las Vegas on May 30th to the site of his most recent research that was provoked by telepathic communication from the J-Rod about its original life on Earth. One of those communications guided Dr. Burisch to look for evidence of panspermia, the seeding of life, at the Vishnu Schist Great Unconformity on the eastern edge of Las Vegas in Frenchman Mountain. Rock layers there range from half a billion to 2.7 billion years old. Two years ago, Dan Burisch was at Frenchman Mountain when he was astonished to see a flash of light from a rock he was videotaping. That discovery lead to what he calls the LOTUS MODEL and STAAR FLOWER Projects. On our field trip, Dr. Burisch explained what happened as we walked from the freeway up to the same rock layer where the energy burst occurred from rocks containing silicon dioxide quartz crystals.

In the rocky hill beyond, we walked the path to the rocks where microbiologist Dan Burisch discovered a biophotonic burst of energy on May 31, 2001, while researching panspermia evidence.

Dan Burisch, Ph.D., Microbiologist, at Vishnu Schist Great Unconformity, Las Vegas, Nevada: \"If you activate the silicon dioxide in the proper way, there is an emission of the particles. EVEN FROM RIGHT HERE? Sure. If my theory is correct, it's from all silicon dioxide. It literally accesses through the ether, through the implicate structure of the universe into our material structure of the universe."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"BUT THAT SPECIFIC CRYSTAL (SILICON DIOXIDE)? The quartz crystals that we were working with here are alpha quartz after beta quartz. We were dealing specifically with octahedral crystals. YOU THINK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PART OF A LARGE INTELLIGENCE PLAN? I believe the octahedral structure acts as an antenna, if you will, yes. And given the fact that the octahedral structure is one of the five Platonic solids, as well as the base structure for what you see huge groupings on a celestial scale of star clusters and galaxies through the universe. I believe it is an important structure. I'm not new in believing that. Octahedron (8 sides), one of the five Platonic solids and the shape of the silicon dioxide quartz crystals that microbiologist Dan Burisch experimented with in his LOTUS MODEL research of life seeding by \"ganesh particles\" interacting with the quartz at French Mountain, Las Vegas, Nevada. Large silicon dioxide quartz crystals. \"Ganesh\" Particles But the particles that we found are basically a combination current theories having to do with \"inphotons\" biophotonic material that contains information. It happened right up here. It was being filmed with a standard video camera. What I was doing was I was playing with the conductivity of the rock here. I was looking for something totally different from what we found. I was looking for a change in conductivity and associated particles trapped careful trapped in the rock. Specifically I was looking for biomarkers, DNA biomarkers. And we've got that huge biophotonic burst. The May 31st image where it looks like it is green you see this light burst (of rock) right there. WAS IT PURE LUCK? I added too much energy and the right amount of light, too much directed energy and the right amount of light and it was pure luck. I found the biophotonic burst and said, 'My God, we've got something different here than what I thought originally.' So, I suspended operations looking for the biomarker and started looking for a reason why I would have the biophotonic burst. At the time, I didn't call it a biophotonic burst. I just called it a burst of energy. We find when the right amount of energy is added together with the right wattage per square area, we just get pure particle emission. And it's an extremely small millivoltage, right around 16.5 millivolts.\" "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Panspermia and Ganesh Particles The burst of light energy at the Vishnu Schist rock in Las Vegas - which surprised Dr. Dan Burisch - also gave him an insight about panspermia the seeding of life force on Earth and throughout the universe. Dr. Burisch hypothesizes in his LOTUS MODEL that programmed energy he calls \"ganesh particles\" travel in light and can interact with common silicon dioxide quartz crystals the way radio signals interact with antennas. Dr. Burisch: \"It relates as a communication carrier from the other side, the void if you will, to present day living organisms. Originally, I had thought we would be dealing with something left as a biomarker in the rock and I was going to look for differences, depending upon the age. Hence, we had to make up our mind about where we were going to start. This is the oldest section (of the rock here) and it goes down to some 20 million years before present down by Lava Butte. Everything from here on, we're up above a 550 million year old area. What we did is originally, we thought it was going to be a biomarker and we would find a separate biomarker in present day cells and attempt to match those biomarkers to what could have been a theoretical panspermia virus. What we found is an actual emission of particles from a Somewhere. When we found the emission of particles from a Somewhere, I said, 'OK, let's hold my mundane theory here for a second. We're going to start looking at this super jazzed up data that we're getting. And that's where we've been working ever since. The Ganesh particle basically acts as a communication from Somewhere meaning the void that gets accessed under the right energy concentration, or the right light. We named it the 'shiva.' It's just an operating name, the 'ganesh particle,' meaning 'mover of obstacles.' Then finally, we began to look at what the ganesh particles did to living cells and they in fact imparted certain substances to the living cells. We named those substances which were imparted and retained by the living cells as the 'vishnu' component. So, we had our triumvirate model, if you will, but I think you can tell by what I just said that it is totally different than what we first imagined. IF I UNDERSTAND AT ALL, YOU ARE SAYING THAT IT IS THE FORCE BEHIND EVERYTHING HAS THE ABILITY TO SEND OUT SOMETHING LIKE A RADIO OR TELEVISION SIGNAL THAT IS PROGRAMMED WITH INFORMATION. WHEN IT INTERACTS WITH ANY SILICON DIOXIDE, IT'S GOING TO FILL THE SILICON DIOXIDE WITH A PROGRAM THAT CAN PRODUCE LIFE? Pretty accurate. Pretty accurate. Basically the silicon dioxide acts as an antenna which, when enough particles are oriented in the correct fashion hence, the right shaped crystal it acts as an antenna and opens a void, the particles are emitted, and yes, in fact they can motivate the production of life from pre-existing proteins. Now, I do not know whether or not they can motivate the production of life on their own. So, we do not have first life here. At least, we do not have data to support first life. But we have data to support production of life from proteinaceous material. THE IMPLICATION IS THAT YOU HAVE FOUND MAYBE THE PROGRAMMING MECHANISM FOR LIFE IN THIS UNIVERSE. BUT IT HAS TO BE ABLE TO BUILD WITH PROTEINS. WHAT WOULD MAKE THE PROTEINS? Well, originally these protein components could have been assembled in theory by the ganesh particles, or by actions from the ganesh particles, from amino acids that could have rained here as part of a celestial rain. So, in other words, delivered by comets. So, in fact, the portion of the panspermia theory regarding the production of life on Earth from deposition of amino acids could in fact have played in with this model (of ganesh particles). ISN'T THE BIGGER IMPLICATION THAT IF THERE IS A FREQUENCY CARRIER OF LIFE PROGRAMMING THAT CAN GO INTO ALL SILICA DIOXIDES, THAN IT SHOULD BE ANYWHERE THERE ARE SILICA DIOXIDES IN THE UNIVERSE? Yes, m'am.\" Convergent Timeline Paradox Dr. Burisch said his discovery of the \"ganesh particles\" programmed with the Great Force of Life could not directly help solve the J-Rod medical problems. If the J-Rods are facing extinction without a timeline change, I asked Dr. Burisch how the alleged different time lines of the J-Rods, the Blonds and humans ( Homo sapiens sapiens ) could be converged into one time line - without eliminating some of them?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"J-Rod drawn by Dan Burisch, Ph.D., Microbiologist, based on face-to-face encounter in 1994 inside clean sphere at S-4/5, Area 51, Nellis AFB, Nevada. Dan Burisch: \"Presently, they (J-Rods and Blonds) are simply traveling in time to come back to this present time. So, we're not exactly existing in the same time line with them. It's the actions of time travel which cause the temporal paradoxes. Further than that, talk to Bill Hamilton because he is the physics guy. BUT YOUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IF THINGS WORK, THREE OF THESE TIME LINES, SO TO SPEAK OURS, THE J-RODS AND THE BLONDS COULD COEXIST IN A SINGULAR TIME LINE WITHOUT A CATASTROPHE IN 2012? Two time lines would co-exist. Our present time line and those from Orion and the J-Rods. They are concurrent in a time line because they were concurrent at the point of catastrophe. SO, THEY ARE CONCURRENT NOW AND THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO CONVERGE IT INTO ONE IN WHICH THEY WILL REMAIN, FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW, EXTRATERRESTRIALS? Ye s , m' a m. AND WHAT WILL THAT ACCOMPLISH FOR THEM IF THEY ARE STILL VERY SICK? It won't. But it will accomplish for us in our reality of not having a catastrophe that ultimately splits our human species. IT WOULD END THE CYCLE? Yes, m'am. When it comes to the prevalence of the poly neuropathy and associated conditions with the J-Rods, that's a totally separate issue and it's one that is still being worked upon. It's one of the team that I was lucky enough to head I actually failed to find an answer to. However, there have been some significant inroads of late concerning their biology and so hopefully, we will have at least some treatment to alleviate their problems.\" Continued in Part 2 - ERB \"star gate\" on Frenchman Mountain, Nevada.

He is 40 years old now, born on February 2, 1964. His birth certificate name was Danny B (no period) Crain. I have met and talked with his mother, Dodie Crain, and with Dan who confirm the name change and reason for it. Copy of Danny B Crain (aka Dan Burisch) \"Certificate of Live Birth\" at 4:28 a.m. on February 2, 1964, in St. Francis Hospital in Lynwood, California - a suburb of Los Angeles. Birth certificate provided by \"Dodie\" Crain. In 1990, Dan married Deborah Kay Burisch who had a child from a previous marriage. Five years later in 1995, Dan legally changed his last name from Crain to Burisch to match the child's legal last name. In 1989, as Dan Crain graduated from SUNY Stonybrook with a Ph.D. in Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Dan was at the same time employed by the U. S. Navy's DOD Naval Research Laboratory. His rank was Captain and his title Microbiologist IV. In 1994, he was assigned to work in an underground laboratory at S-4/5 at Area 51, five floors under the Papoose Mountain installation at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The fifth floor is accessible only by one secure elevator. Dr. Burisch told me that in the year 1994, he suited up in the fifth floor underground laboratory like an astronaut with breathing and urination hoses. His assignment was to enter a round \"clean sphere\" filled with a cold atmosphere of 4% by volume hydrogen, argon and other gases. Inside the clean sphere was an entity originally called \"extraterrestrial\" by his government superiors and later described as a \"time traveler\" from 50,000 years in the future. According to Dr. Burisch, his boss reported to a MAJI committee, an extension of the Majestic-12 Special Studies Group organized by President Harry S. Truman in 1947. Majestic 12 included top scientific, military and business leaders asked to study the extraterrestrial phenomenon.
