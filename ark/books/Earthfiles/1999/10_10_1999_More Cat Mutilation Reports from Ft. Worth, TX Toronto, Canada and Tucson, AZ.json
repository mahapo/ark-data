What we're seeing now is a new type of mutilation in which cats arecut down the center from the throat to the pubic area. The rib cage is spread andthen the organs are either removed or tied around the animal.\"One cat owner, Dennis Tulino, lost one of his eight cats and found anotherinjured. Elvis was found across the street from Tulino's home. His throat wasslit, the rib cage opened, but there was no blood.
