Back on August 8, 1996,the media was full of headlines about signs of life on Mars in a chunk ofmeteorite discovered in Antarctica. When the meteorite was examinedmicroscopically, scientists found rice-shaped \"globules\" in tiny cracks on therock which resembled bacteria. The carbon in those fossilized globules datedback to about three and a half billion years ago when Mars probably had wateron its surface and was warmer.Now there are scientists going two miles down in our own earth and so far havefound more than 11,000 new strains of subterranean bacteria which have neverbeen seen or studied before. The way they get down two miles into the earth isin South Africa's East Driefontein gold mine. It's one of the deepest excavationsin the world. At the bottom of the mine, radioactivity and heat from earth's coreraise the temperature to 120 Degrees Fahrenheit or more - and the atmosphericpressure is double that on the surface. Princeton University geologist Tullis C.Onstott has been down twice to bring back rocks to study the microbes in aresearch project linked directly to NASA and the search for other life in thesolar system and beyond.The conditions two miles beneath earth seem intolerable for any life form and Iasked him what he experienced on his first trip down.Interview:Tullis C. Onstott, Ph.D., Professor of Geology, Princeton University,Princeton, New Jersey:\"The feeling you get in terms of pressure is not that great, but the temperature isprofound. Your skin prickles immediately as sweat begins to pour. And for me,for some reason or other, I seem to sweat profusely! So, quite quickly yourclothes become totally saturated and stick to your skin and your gloves andboots which are all mandatory mining gear begin to fill with water.Then if you aren't acclimatized - and on my first trip down I wasn't acclimatizedat all - you can march along fairly well, but you are constantly under theoppression of heat and by the end of 45 minutes of marching and crawlingeventually and then toting maybe several tens of pounds of rocks with you onthe way back - it becomes pretty exhausting. You're completely wiped out. Youcan barely think. On the trip back my first time down, we stopped to collectwater from a bore hole where the water was coming out at 55 DegreesCentigrade which is quite hot.It was in a very closed environment, a room, a chamber which reeked ofammonia which was residue from drilling explosives and if it hadn't been for thehelpers they supplied me I literally wouldn't have been able to carry out thewater analyses that we did do. Fortunately we did, because that water containeda most interesting organism. Microbiologists working with me - Jim Fredericksonand Tom Keith - were able to extract a remarkably thermal-tolerant radiation-"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"tolerant bacterium that could live on a variety of inorganic substrates.Photo Credit © 1999 by Duane Moser, Princeton University.Coring 3.2 kilometers below South Africa surface horizontally into EastDriefontein Gold Mine to study microbiology of carbon leader.Photo Credit © 1999 by Duane Moser, Princeton University.2000x of organism that was cultured from hot fissure water(60 Deg. C.) at 3.2 kilometers depth in Kloof Mine.MEANING THAT IT COULD BE IN TEMPERATURES UP TO 200DEGREES F. AND BE HANDLING RADIOACTIVITY AND METALLICTOXINS?That's exactly right. It was really optimally growing at about 70 Deg. Cent. - thisparticular micro-organism which was a thermos organism and is normallyassociated with oxygenated environments. But this one was found in anenvironment in which it could live off of iron metal, sulfate and nitrogencompound and even cobalt and uranium. It could utilize as sources of energy.IF IT'S THERE TWO MILES UNDER THE SURFACE OF THE EARTHIN ALL OF WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER TO BE INTOLERABLECONDITIONS, THERE IS A POSSIBILITY - MAYBE EVEN ALIKELIHOOD - THAT THE SAME KINDS OF ORGANISMS COULDBE IN OLYMPUS MONS UNDERGROUND ON MARS?This is probably one of the most intriguing analogies that can be drawn with thework that has been done by many microbiologists at the Dept. of Energylaboratories and other places for the last almost ten years now. It is certainly astrong motivator. It keeps us focused on trying to understand how theseorganisms can survive in this energy-poor environment. There's not a lot ofenergy available down there and how they can survive and for how long? How"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"long can they sustain their existence down there? We don't fully understand allthe factors that enter the equation that allows them to be so resilient in theseenvironments?HOW DO SUCH BACTERIA END UP TWO MILES DOWN TO BEGINWITH?(Laughs) Well, that is probably - that was the focus of our second expeditiondown to South Africa. It has also been the focus of the work of what used to beknown as the Sub Surface Science Program at the Dept. of Energy run by FrankLauber. They developed a series of geological tests designed to understandwhether or not these organisms were injected into these environments because ofman's activities - drilling, sampling for oil, water, those kinds of things - orwhether in fact, they were there as a result of geological processes - groundwater flow, flow through fracture zones - or entrapment when those sedimentsfirst formed hundreds of millions of years ago. And Tommy Phelps at Oak RidgeNational Lab; D. C. White at the Univ. of Tennessee, and others, developedtechniques which allowed us to determine whether in fact the bacteria were theresult of mining contamination, or drilling contamination, or were in factindigenous to the rocks themselves.WHAT'S THE CONCLUSION SO FAR?In many of the cases where we have been working, you can look at differentrock samples - you can ascertain what part of the rock represents potentiallycontaminated from surface micro-organisms, potentially contaminated material -and those which the overwhelming majority of the evidence is not contaminated.And in those uncontaminated rock samples, you do find a variety of micro-organisms. And in many cases, those micro-organisms are previouslyunidentified species of bacteria. They exhibit metabolic properties which arecompatible with the sub surface environment in which they are found.THE DISCOVERY ARTICLE SAYS, \"MORE THAN 11,000 NEWSTRAINS OF THESE SUBTERRANEAN BACTERIA HAVE BEENCULTURED, BUT ONLY A FEW HAVE BEEN STUDIED ANDNAMED.\" THAT'S AN EXTRAORDINARILY LARGE NUMBER THATSUGGESTS THAT SOME HOW BACTERIA GO HAND AND HANDWITH ROCK ALMOST?That's absolutely right, down to a certain depth. So, those 11,000 strains, as yousay, many of them have not been studied in detail. They are archived. Weactually have culture collections - one at Florida State run by David Bockwelland another at Portland run by David Boone - and they literally have thesethings stored away on liquid nitrogen. They have students working away tryingto understand all the things these organisms can do and how they are geneticallyrelated to the more common surface organisms that we find around us where welive.WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY THAT THE DISCOVERY OF THESEDEEP MICROBES HAS MADE SCIENTISTS IN GENERAL LESSSKEPTICAL OF FINDING WHAT WE'LL CALLEXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE OR ORGANISMS ON OTHER PLANETSIN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM?Major paradigm shift there - major, major paradigm shift. And I shouldemphasize at this point that Tommy Gold has probably been the biggestproponent of this very early on. It's clear that to all of us that once you becomeconvinced - or once you begin to realize just how tenacious bacteria can be - infact, they don't have necessarily a finite life span to them like you and I - theycan live for eons essentially - as long as they have enough energy. Then yourealize that in a planet like Mars where all the evidence points to anenvironment very similar to earth's 4 billion years ago - that life near or on thesurface of Mars implicitly means that life existed beneath the surface of Mars.And even though Mars has chilled down and lost a large proportion of itsatmosphere and developed a kilometer big zone of ice beneath its surface -there's almost the probability that life exists beneath the surface of Mars isextremely high. Once we recognize that life exists beneath the surface - milesbeneath the surface at our planet today - it's almost unquestionable that it must"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"exist beneath the surface of Mars - now.AND COULD ANY OF THEM END UP BEING AN X-FILESORGANISM THAT COULD SUDDENLY UNLEASH SOMETHINGTERRIBLE ON THE EARTH?Absolutely not. Absolutely not! In fact, these rocks - these bacteria are used toliving in rocks! Gaining their energy from minerals and inorganic nutrients andthings. They are not used to competing with all the viruses and bacteria thatexist in ourselves.AND THE INFORMATION FROM YOUR RESEARCH WILL GO TONASA AND PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY INVOLVED WITH SPACEEXPLORATION?We are collaborating with scientists at JPL and at Johnson Space Center and atAmes. We literally want these scientists who are trying to search for life inmeteorites and at Mars to come down to South Africa - to develop the tools thatthey want in the lab for searching for life on Mars - take them to out site in So.Africa and try them out. At South Africa deep underground, chances are thatenvironment is the closest analogy to the conditions that we'll find in thesub-surface of Mars. The tools that you need to get 3 kilometers down in Marsshould be tested out in the environment of So. Africa. There are actually activeprograms of research right now both at NASA and at Los Alamos National Labs- trying to develop robotic tools that can drill down 3 kilometers down on Mars,collect samples, ascertain whether those samples contain some componentswhich indicate living processes are ongoing on Mars.OR FINDING ORGANISMS EXACTLY LIKE YOU'RE FINDING INSOUTH AFRICA.That's exactly right. To find whether or not and whether or not a bacteriumexists in the deep sub-surface of Mars - and that bacteria is very similar to Earthorganisms - and is not a contaminant carried to there by our spacecraft - wouldmean literally that the finger of God has touched two planets instead of just one.And it has incredible implications for the very origin of life - whether or not lifeoriginated on the surface and whether or not life originated on Mars first andwas transported to earth later on via meteorites. Just to find some sort of life thatis similar to earth organisms has remarkable implications, not only for theoriginal life, but the spread of life out through the solar system.More Information:One of the strangest organisms Professor Onstott and his colleagues have foundso far is a bacteria that secretes large quantities of magnetite. The strangebacteria take iron from the water in the deep rock and combine it with anelectron acceptor that produces large quantities of fine grain magnetite which isa highly magnetic by-product. And the microbes do this at extremely hightemperatures. So far, no one understands exactly how this bacteria precipitatesthe magnetite, but the organism is being studied at Oak Ridge National Lab inTennessee.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
