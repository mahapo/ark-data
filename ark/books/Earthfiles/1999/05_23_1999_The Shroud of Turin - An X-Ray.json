(© 1982 Giles F. Carter, Ph.D.,Eastern Michigan University Chemistry Department, Ypsilanti, Michiganreceived for review Oct. 6, 1982 and accepted for publication April 18, 1983,American Chemical Society Volume on Archaeological Chemistry.)I was so provoked by this news that I called Dr. Carter up to talk about thelaboratory work that had helped him come to this startling idea. Dr. Carterreceived his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley where hespecialized in x-ray diffraction to determine crystal structures. He went on to bea Professor of Chemistry at Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, and is nowProfessor Emeritus. Dr. Carter began studying Roman coins with x-rayfluorescence in 1963. Over the next 32 years until he retired in 1995, Dr. Carterused x-ray fluorescence continually in his university work analyzing hundreds ofcoins, elements and metals. In 1981, he attended a Shroud of Turin ResearchProject in New London, Connecticut and saw slides of the image on the Shroudfor the first time.Interview:Giles Carter, Ph.D., retired Professor of Chemistry and X-RayFluorescence Expert from Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti,Michigan: \"It was at that time, I noticed from the slides what appeared to bepossibly x-ray images of fingers and also of teeth. And that began, or gave methe idea that perhaps low energy x-rays were involved in the formation of theseimages on the Shroud. Then, when I went home to East Michigan University inYpsilanti, Michigan, I carried out some experiments similar to what I had donewith the analysis of Roman coins -- namely I placed samples of cloth in thex-ray beam and exposed that to the x-rays for different periods of time. Andnoticed that I did indeed get images formed on the cloth. And these images didappear certainly in color similar to what I had seen in the slides, because I hadnot seen the Shroud of Turin directly myself. Never have.So, I carried out quite a few experiments exposing cloth to various exposures,putting aluminum foil in the path of the x-rays which absorbed the low energyx-rays and when I did that I didn't get much of an image at all. And that provedthat most of the image I was getting was from low energy x-rays which was myhypothesis in the first place.After producing a number of these, I took a trip out to Calif. For to see familyand at that time I arranged to see Vernon Miller who was the officialphotographer in the 1978 testing that the STURP scientists did.At that time, Vernon Miller said, \"Oh, this coloration is just like the colorationon the Shroud.\" And at that point, he gave me a nice enlargement of the hand of"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the Shroud. And this helped to convince me even more that what a lot of peoplecalled the \"too long fingers\" and the shortened wrist actually was both an imagefrom the surface and an x-ray image all at the same time. And that would be inagreement with my hypothesis that a lot of the Shroud image was actuallyformed from low energy x-rays.THEN THE QUESTION WOULD BE: WHAT WOULD PROVOKE THELOW-ENERGY X-RAYS TO EMANATE FROM THE BONE OUTWARDTHROUGH THE SKIN TO THE LINEN SHROUD THAT WOULD BEENFOLDING THE BODY OF CHRIST?My hypothesis for that is that higher energy x-rays which are more penetratingemanated from the bones of this individual and passed through the skin and atthe surface of the skin interacted with elements such as sodium and chlorinefrom salts and chloride on the surface or from sulfur or phosphorous in the skin.And these elements then, like sodium and chlorine, gave off secondary x-rayswhich are very low in energy and not penetrating at all. And it's these x-rays thatactually caused most of the image, or all of the image, of the Shroud.Now, people have asked me: Where did the x-rays from the bones come from?And I cannot answer that question. If one believes that the Shroud of Turinactually covered the body of Christ, then one would say, \"Well, from theResurrection Process.\" But no scientist can say anything about a resurrectionprocess because there is no direct experience with that other than perhaps theShroud, but we don't know about that at all. So, in other words, scientificallyyou can say nothing about the Resurrection Process.On the other hand, artistically it's rather interesting -- for instance, in the filmET, the extraterrestrial or alien was resurrected by a strong beam of light. Ialways thought that was rather curious that they would choose that sort of thing.And who knows, what the Resurrection Process was for Christ according toChristian belief. No one knows about that. No scientists can really do anythingother than speculate.So again, I had offered one explanation that perhaps there was radiation in therocks around where the body was laid. But one of my friends said, \"That reallyis not a very good explanation.\" And I agree. That's very, very weak and I doubtthat happened. Basically, I have no explanation.WHAT KIND OF FORCE FROM THE OUTSIDE WOULD YOUHYPOTHESIZE COULD CAUSE STRONG X-RAYS TO EMANATEFROM THE BONE AND THEN PRODUCE THE WEAKER X-RAYS ATTHE SURFACE OF THE SKIN?The only thing that I would say is that some form of energy would have beennecessary to enter the bones to cause x-rays to emanate from the bones. Andthat would cause the secondary, or even tertiary at this point, x-rays from theskin to come out. So, what that energy source was -- the external energy sourceentering the bones -- I really don't know about that. It's just beyond us , beyondme to speculate on that. I really can't say.ISN'T IT TRUE THAT NEW INFORMATION THAT HAS BEENPRESENTED SINCE THE FIRST CARBON DATING IS THAT THERECOULD BE A BIOLOGICAL COATING ON THE LINEN ITSELFWHERE THE CARBON DATING WAS MEASURING AS OPPOSED TOTHE ACTUAL DATE OF THE LINEN?Well, there have been several hypotheses put forward to explain in certainpeoples minds why the Carbon 14 dating was wrong. My own feeling on that isthat linen fibrils are hollow and the sample taken from the Shroud for theCarbon 14 dating was taken from absolutely the worst possible place -- namely,one lower corner which was right next to the edge of the Shroud and it was alsothe corner, or one of the corners, where people handled it the most. Now if"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"people handled that or if materials were put on the Shroud in an attempt topreserve it hundreds of years ago, it's possible that over along period of time thatsome of these organic materials could have diffused or moved through the linenfibrils and into the interior. Now, if this is the case, it would have beenimpossible through just a short cleaning, using just solvents which the scientistsused before the Carbon-14 testing -- it would have been impossible to removethat interior carbon-containing material.THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN MEASURING AN ARTIFACT OF ALLTHAT HANDLING?Right, they would be measuring more recent carbon-containing material, maybefrom 100 or 200 years ago, or something like that. So they would just be gettingthe average age coming out around 1300 A.D.WHEREAS THE TRUTH MIGHT BE THAT IF THEY HAD CARBONDATED LINEN WHERE THE ACTUAL IMAGE IS, IT MIGHT HAVEGONE BACK TO 32 A.D.?That's possible. And that's why I think the Carbon-14 dating should be repeatedand done very carefully according to the procedure that the Shroud of TurinResearch Project outlined in the first place. Their procedure was NOT followedat all in the Carbon-14 testing. So, the whole testing process was -- in theopinion of many scientists, not done very well. It's not that the carbon-14 testitself was poor. I think most everyone says that the laboratories are capable ofgetting good results from the sample they have. But it's namely, a samplingproblem. So always in an analysis, you have both a problem of sampling. Is thesample what you want it to be? Is it representative of the material that you wantanalyzed? And then is the analysis itself correct? There are two differentproblems. The analysis itself could be correct, but if the sampling is not donecorrectly, then the end result is going to be wrong.THE SAMPLING IN THIS CASE WOULD BE WHICH PARTICULARLINEN FIBER AFFECTED A THOUSAND HANDLINGS OVER ALONG PERIOD OF TIME AT THE CORNER VERSUS A PIECEWHERE THE IMAGE IS THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN TOUCHEDMUCH AT ALL?That's correct. There's one other factor there and that is that the sample that wastaken for the Carbon-14 analysis was removed from a position adjacent to a sidepanel which had been sewn onto the Shroud. It wasn't sewn on using thread oranything like that. It was actually WOVEN on to the material, so some of theweaving from that side panel was actually in some of those fibers in the samplethat was removed for the Carbon-14 date. No one knows when that side panel of6-inches or so was applied to the Shroud. No one knows that! And here again,those more possibly recent fibrils could have affected the Carbon-14 dates.WHY WOULD THE CARBON-14 BE DONE ON A THREAD TAKENFROM A PANEL THAT EVERYONE KNEW HAD BEEN WOVEN IN ATSOME UNKNOWN POINT IN THE PAST?That's a good question! It remains unanswered. The Italian authorities decided tochange where the sample was removed and perhaps they did that because therewas political pressure applied over there. Many years ago I attended a meeting inNaples with the scientist who was in charge of advising the Roman CatholicChurch about the Shroud and he told me enormous political pressures had beenapplied on him in the past about the Shroud. There were many people in Italyand Europe who first of all were opposed to scientists examining the Shroud atall.Secondly, they were opposed to scientists from the United States being soheavily involved. They wanted more Italians and more Europeans represented.So, here again, it's difficult to know what happened there. No one really knowsoutside the people who were really there at the time. And I think we can onlyspeculate that maybe pressure had been brought to bear -- no, we will not"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"follow the STURP, which was American-proposed procedure for doing theCarbon-14. We will do it according -- we will take a sample from a place thatwon't be noticed in the future from the Shroud -- take it from that lower corner.And only have 3 labs run the carbon-14, instead of 7 labs. And have it done byonly one method instead of two methods which the STURP had proposed.\"We b s it e s :http://www.shroud.comCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
