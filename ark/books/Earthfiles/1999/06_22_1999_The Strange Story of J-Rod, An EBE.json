I was amused because he indicated that the big boss of theproject was an extraterrestrial biological entity (EBE) that he knew as J-Rodwho was supposed to have arrived on earth in 1953. According to anothersource called BJ discussed further in this article, the \"J\" and \"Rod\" were derivedfrom early attempts to establish communication between the extraterrestrialbiological entity, EBE, and U. S. scientists privy to EBE contact.Since the release of the MJ-12 Eisenhower Briefing Document in the early1980s, the term EBE has come into popular use to designate diminutive,grey-colored humanoids associated with crashed saucers. Another variantspelling is Eben used by physicist Paul Bennewitz and others. Some implied thatEbens also were a class of EBEs with certain distinct physical characteristicsand were said to be working with our military scientists and engineers on variousprojects. According to BJ, no language interface with the EBE existed in 1953,so a series of symbols were shown to test his reactions. Some symbols lookedlike letters and others were geometric shapes. The first symbol the EBENpointed to looked like a \"J.\" The other was an \"inertial-bar\" that looked like arod. So, humans called the Eben \"J-Rod.\"I was bemused because I wondered why Bill Uhouse was disclosing informationconcerning a highly classified operation. I was also skeptical that here might beanother \"insider\" with tales about Area 51 and S-4. Kingman, Arizona 1953Engineer Bill Uhouse claims there was a crash of an Eben aerial craft nearKingman, Arizona in 1953 and that four entities survived. That would have beensix years after the more famous Roswell crashes and retrievals of \"interplanetarycraft of unknown origin.\" In Kingman, according to Uhouse, two disabled Ebensand two more that were in good condition were retrieved by U. S.governmentunits specially trained for retrieval missions. The two non-humans in goodcondition were allowed to re-enter the craft and the disabled entities were takento an unspecified medical facility.Uhouse also states that a recovery crew that entered the craft to inspect it camedown with a mysterious sickness. The craft was then loaded aboard a trailer andhauled off to the Nevada Test Site north of Las Vegas. Bill Uhouse claims thatthe events at Kingman eventually resulted in the project which employed him todesign and construct a flight simulator that our airmen could use to learn how tofly a saucer.Bill claims that he met one of the aliens who apparently supervised this projectand was known as J-Rod. Bill says he worked both at Los Alamos and Area 51.Bill tells a fascinating story and it would have remained just a story until I readabout a document that purported to be a technical paper on tissue samples takenfrom an EBE known as AQ-J-ROD. BJ says the \"AQ\" signifies Project Aquarius"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"under the Majestic-12 group created by U. S. President Harry S. Truman in1947 and assigned to research the crashed disc and non-human bodies that haddescended upon the United States in the 1940s.J-Rod, Technical Adviser, Nevada Test SiteOn visits to the flight simulator, Bill Uhouse would occasionally see who actedas a technical adviser to the ultra-secret program that Bill worked on. It wasJ-Rod, a typical gray-colored EBE, hairless and without facial expressions. Hehad large, black wrap-around eyes or eye-lenses that are typical of thesecreatures. He is reported to be 200 years old, suffering from cell deteriorationand still located at Papoose S-4, Area 51 in Nevada. But I can't confirm that.According to Bill Uhouse, the funny thing was how he dressed in humantrousers and a loose shirt. His shoes were different, but I don't know in whatway. His four-finger hands were long. See drawing below by Bill Uhouse.Drawing of J-Rod © by Bill Uhouse.When a retired U. S. Air Force Major saw Uhouse's drawing of J-Rod, he said,\"With the exception of the long fingernails and the bulkiness, this looks just likeJ-Rod. He was thin, but did not have long fingernails.\"(Editorial Note by Earthfiles Reporter and Editor Linda Moulton Howe: InSeptember 1998, a source I interviewed at length who wishes to simply becalled \"Kewper\" told me that he worked for both the CIA and the Army SignalCorps between 1956 and 1960. He was stationed at an Army school that taughtencryption in the southeastern United States. His supervisor asked Kewper tojoin a highly classified CIA group to analyze photographs, drawings, documentsand other evidence from around the world related to the presence of anon-human intelligence. Kewper said in August 1958, he, his boss and five otherCIA colleagues flew to Nellis AFB, Nevada for a meeting with a USAF Colonelin an area built into the Papoose Mountains near Groom Lake called S-4. There,the group not only saw seven round craft inside a hollowed out area of thePapoose Mountains, but were taken to an office to communicate telepathicallywith a grey non-human being working in some capacity with the U. S.government. The drawing below is by Kewper of the being he saw in that August1958 meeting.

Army cryptographer who saw thisextraterrestrial biological entity in August 1958 dressed in a human T-shirt at anundergroundinstallation inside the Papoose Mountains near Groom Lake called S-4, Area 51, NellisAFB, Nevada. BJ, Dr. Dan Burisch and J-Rod Tissue AnalysesI sent a copy of the document I received referencing J-Rod to a contact of minein Las Vegas known as BJ. She had been working with her friend, Dr. DanBurisch, on anomalous objects appearing in images of Mars, especially in anarea known as the \"Inca City.\" It seems that Dan had previously worked at thesuper secret S-4 facility as Dr. Danny Benjamin Crain, a microbiologist who hadtaken tissue samples from an EBE. He was listed in the document I received asDanny Benjamin Crain, Ph.D. (Captain, United States Navy, N.R.L.) WorkingGroup Leader, Project Aquarius, R-4800, Papoose Site 4.In BJ's words, \"When confronted with the evidence, Dr. Burisch became highlydefensive, but later admitted that he had indeed been involved with tissueexperiments of an 'unknown nature' which ultimately proved to be samples froman 'alien' source. It was also confirmed that the alien source material wasobtained from an extraterrestrial biological entity housed deep underneath thatbase,\" in a secure facility that resembled a clean, perfectly round sphere orchamber shaped like a ball. Why? I don't know.This revelation triggered a series of problems: our internet and telephonecommunications were suddenly monitored and suffered interference. The sourceof this interference was ultimately determined to be Dr. Burisch's formeremployers from \"up there\" who were monitoring everything that Dan said forfear that he would divulge sensitive information. He received threatening andintimidating visits from representatives of his former employers at his home andplace of business as a warning to say nothing more on the subject. According toBJ, Dr. Burisch even had his hand broken and eventually his memories alteredso he would not remember anything about S-4 and J-Rod.But a document was leaked from Area-51 bearing a Dr. Dan Crain's signatureand describing in great detail the nature of the experiments that were takingplace in the lab facility underneath Area-51 - experiments that Dan would not"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"talk about. This document indicates that Dr. Dan Burisch (who had his namelegally changed to Burisch from Crain in the mid 1990s) was the scientistresponsible for entering the \"clean sphere\" and taking over 200 tissue samplesfrom the alien being housed there and for helping to coordinate the scientificresearch into alien DNA. The contents of this document are chilling. It describesin great detail the types of tissue preparations necessary for the alien tissuepropagation and the use of human DNA taken from a cadaver to try to repair aneural failure among the 'aliens' which was thought to be genetic. It alsodiscusses the team's unanimous disapproval of the genetic back-engineeringefforts underway (by whose authority?) which could have a 'cross-breedingintent' of human and alien to apparently revitalize the alien species.

Classify such reasons, functionally, toascertain the mechanisms of such failure, then isolate the mostprobable pre-existing cellular conditions giving allowance to properregeneration.\" (This seems to indicate that the study was undertakento try to figure out why the non-human physiology was not repairingitself - at least in the neural tissue - the way it should.)The report continues..... [The tissue samples which were taken fromthe EBE was grown in an agar medium made of] \"Equalcombinations of pressurized dictostelium-desoxycholate racemic to10.000/100.000 (%) and glucose-acetate.\" This medium producedthe highest cellular, fibrilar growth rates. The report went on to saythat \"Nominal contamination-restriction protocols were followed\"and then cited \"Cross contamination protocol 6, N.R.L., DocumentNumber Q-93-016B for procedural guidelines.\" Brief History of Alleged Eben VisitorsEBE-1 was supposedly taken alive from one of the saucer crashes of 1947 andwas housed in captivity in an underground area at Los Alamos Laboratory, NewMexico. EBE-1 died of unknown causes on June 18, 1952.J-ROD was allegedly retrieved from a crashed disc near Kingman, Arizona andtaken to the Nevada Test Site and Area 51, S-4, Groom Lake and the PapooseMountain engineering bay research and development complex. Some insiders"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"have implied that J-Rod might have been part of EBE-3's team, but I think hearrived separately after the Kingman, Arizona crash in 1953.EBE-2 arrived in April 1964 for the first \"official\" landing and contact. Locationwas a highly secured Area 17 at White Sands (not Holloman AFB) located justsouth of the present Shuttle landing site. EBE-2 was described during aninterview on March 5th, 1983 with former AFOSI agent at Los Alamos as being4' 9\" tall and having a very thin body: He was dressed in a tight fitting jump suitand having only four fingers and no thumb. Interview reportedly took place atLos Alamos National Labs at a Site 30 inside TA49. EBE-2 departed in 1984,according to two alleged CIA memos shown to me by a former Wright-Pattersonand Sandia Labs employee. EBE-3 came as an exchange scientist in 1978 alongwith two aids. One aid was assigned to Groom Lake and the other assigned toLos Alamos Laboratory. EBE-3 was male and the aid at LANL was female.EBE-3 and his aids left in November 1994.There you have it - a wonderful story, and a provocative document to be addedto all the other leaked MJ-12 and Project Aquarius documents. You may allegethat this is just a fantastic tale or CIA misinformation (for what purpose?), butthe truth is that we don't know. The separate testimonies and documents needfurther research and analysis. We also need more individuals who are willing tocome forth and give their testimony and have their background authenticated byresearchers if we are to expend additional effort pursuing the truth about theextraterrestrial presence If you have any more information about J-Rod andEbens, please contact Bill Hamilton at: skywatcher22@hotmail.com.More Information:Acknowledgements: My thanks to Bill Uhouse, Robert Collins, B.J., and Robertfor sharing information about J-Rod and the Ebens.
