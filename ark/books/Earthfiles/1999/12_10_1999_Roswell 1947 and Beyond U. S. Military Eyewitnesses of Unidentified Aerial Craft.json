Military Eyewitnesses of Unidentified Aerial Craft© 1999 by Linda Moulton Howe Artist composite rendering of three eyewitness drawings of “craft ofunknown origin” associated with Roswell, New Mexico © 1999 by Tim Bauer.December 8, 1999 Phoenix, Arizona - Three retired U. S. military men contributed theirfirsthand eyewitness drawings and experiences to produce for me this composite of at leastone aerial vehicle classified as a craft of unknown origin by the U. S. government. Two ofthe eyewitnesses associate this horseshoe or wedge design with a crash and retrieval in theRoswell, New Mexico area the first week of July 1947. The third eyewitness saw a nearlyidentical craft while assigned to a U. S. Army unit that retrieved a similarly shaped vehiclefrom a field near Indian Town Gap, Pennsylvania in 1969. The major ambiguity was theexact shape of the curved rear. But what stands out is the general similarity - not to a rounddisc - but to a photograph taken by pilot William A. Rhodes of a horseshoe-shaped objectin the sky about a thousand feet above Phoenix, Arizona at dusk on July 7, 1947.Newspaper photograph of William A. Rhodesin The Arizona Republic on Wednesday, July 9, 1947,Phoenix, Arizona. He is holding the box camera he usedto photograph the unusual horseshoe-shaped aerial object.I talked with Mr. Rhodes in September 1999 at his Phoenix home about how he came totake these rare photographs. He told me, \"During World War II, I was a flight instructor outat Falcon's Field here in Phoenix. I taught flying as well as aircraft identification. That givesme a leg up when I see something flying, by looking at its shape and watching it maneuverand fly, I can tell approximately how far it is away and how big it is."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"\"When this thing appeared over Phoenix, I had nothing but a little box camera of mymother's. It was where I could grab it from a few feet away and I snapped pictures of thisthing as it came down out of the clouds and made turns and climbed back up. We had asolid overcast on that day and I snapped a picture just as it flipped quite rapidly. The boxcamera had a very slow shutter, about 1/50th of a second or 1/100th or something like thatand it caused one of the photographs to blur on the image.But The Arizona Republic - I had a friend down there at that time who was head of thephotography department. I called him up and he said, 'Bring it down here right now. We'lldevelop it and run it in the newspaper.' That was the main paper for the state and still is. So,I ran down there and they published it the (sic) next day.\" (His photographs were taken latein the afternoon of Monday, July 7, 1947 and published in The Arizona Republic onWednesday, July 9, 1947 upside down.)Monday, July 7, 1947, the crescent-shaped aerial craft photographedby William Rhodes is published upside down in.Two different frames of box camera photographs taken by William Rhodesof unidentified aerial object seen at dusk on Monday, July 7, 1947 over his Phoenix,Arizona home and printed upside down on front page of the July 9, 1947 edition ofThe Arizona Republic © 1947 by William A.

William A. Rhode first shotthe picture as the slow-flying object was approaching him. As it banked to make a tightturn, he obtained the picture above showing clearly the shape of the object. In seconds,Rhodes said, the 'disc' shot away to the west at high speed. It had made three whirling turnsnorth of the city, after approaching from the west. Aircraft identification experts yesterdaywould not hazard opinions on the object's nature.”The newspaper article by Robert C. Hanika stated in The Arizona Republic, onWednesday, July 9, 1947: “The first clearly recorded photographs of what is believed to bea mysterious ‘flying disc’ which has 33 states in America and even a few foreign countrieson edge with its peculiar activities, was taken by an amateur Phoenix photographer.Rhodes snatched a camera from his workshop bench and by the time he reached a smallmound at the rear of his home, the object had circled once and was banking in tight circlesto the south at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet, he said. In the overcast sky, theobject continued its speedy flight from north to south and directly east of his position.Rhodes snapped the hurtling missile by sighting alongside his box camera.“Quickly rolling up his last piece of film, Rhodes awaited the return of the craft whichcontinued in a clockwise movement over his home and as it disappeared into the west, thesecond shot was taken. (Shown blurred on left in newspaper above.) Rhodes described theobject's disappearance as phenomenal since it apparently winged over and shot up into theether. ‘I don't think it was a P-80 since I have observed many of them over here. Also, thefact it made no other sound after the first pass over the house,’ Rhodes said, ‘makes mebelieve it was some other type of aircraft. In its three flights over the house, there was not asound, even when it zoomed into the southwest,’ he said. Men long experienced in aircraftrecognition studied both the prints and the negatives from which they were made anddeclined to make guesses on what the flying object might be.”U. S. Military Eyewitnesses1) July 1947, Frank J. Kaufmann, U. S. Air Force Intelligence Unit:Frank J. Kaufmann worked inside an intelligence unit assigned to Roswell Army Air Fieldin July 1947. Kaufmann says that on July 4th he and his unit were ordered to travel aboutforty miles north of Roswell to investigate a crashed vehicle. In the frail, yellowed notesthat Kaufmann kept from that day, he wrote: “When we got to the site, we were told it wasa ‘craft of unknown origin.’” Kaufmann says he was within five feet of the vehicle and sawthe five small, human-like bodies found with the craft.Kaufmann's notes estimate the length of the triangular or wedge-shaped craft to be about26 to 28 feet, the width about 15 to 18 feet and 6 feet from bottom to top. A dark, opaque“canopy” tapered into a “sting ray” body the color of pewter. The bottom was coveredwith light beige hexagonal “cells.” Kaufmann wrote, “There was an orange glow aroundthe craft and the area surrounding.”Notes and sketches by Frank J. Kaufmann in July 1947 at the site of a downed craft“of unknown origin” some 40 miles north of Roswell. Submitted to Roswell Army Air Fieldheadquarters in a July 26, 1947 report. Shown with Mr. Kaufmann's permission."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"According to Frank Kaufmann, the bodies were dressed in tight-fitting jump suits the colorof cement that looked a bit metallic like the back side of tin foil. The exposed hands andface were a pale grey-beige. A chemical unit arrived wearing protective suits to collect thehumanoids into body bags. Kaufmann told me, “One body was half in and half out of thecraft. A second had been thrown into an arroyo. Altogether there were five beings, threeinside the craft and two outside. The idea was to get everything out before sunrise. Laterwe faked more damn documents than you can shake a stick at to divert the media's andpublic's attention. We had orders to lie. ”Kaufmann's notes say that the craft was “hauled up by a hoist and chain on to the back of aflat-bed truck, covered with a tarpaulin and driven through Roswell before sun up and putin Hangar 84.” There it was referred to as “Flying Disc E-723.”2) August 1958, “Stein,” U. S. Army Signal Corps:Eleven years later in August 1958, an Army Signal Corps encryption instructor, \"Stetin,\"also saw a horseshoe or wedge-shaped vehicle described by a U. S. Air Force Colonel as\"extraterrestrial in origin.\" Part of Stein's work was for a Central Intelligence Agencyproject that analyzed international films, photographs and drawings of unidentified aerialcraft. His CIA boss asked Stein to join him and three other CIA colleagues for a meeting atNellis AFB north of Las Vegas, Nevada.The five men, lead by an Air Force Colonel identified only as “Jim,” were taken to GroomLake's Area 51. Inside engineering bays built inside the Papoose Mountains were varioustypes of exotic craft. The Air Force Colonel pointed to three and said they were“extraterrestrial.” Stein also learned from CIA documents that alien craft retrieved nearRoswell in 1947 were crescent-shaped, not disc-shaped.Drawing by “Stein,” based on his August 1958 trip with CIA colleaguesto Area 51, Groom Lake engineering bays to see exotic craft, including this wedgeshape that a USAF Colonel said was “alien” and retrieved near Roswell in July 1947.“Stein” also read CIA documents filed in a basement at Langley, Virginia,headquarters that said the Roswell craft were crescent-shaped.Stein's sketch drawn for Howe © September 1998.3) 1969, Clifford E. Stone, U. S. Army Sergeant (Ret.)A decade after that in 1969, U.S. Army Sgt. Clifford E. Stone was on a field trainingexercise between Fort Lee in Richmond, Virginia and Indian Town Gap, Pennsylvania. Hisunit received an emergency communique to retrieve a downed craft near Indian Town Gap.As he approached, Sgt. Stone said:\"The first thing that we saw is what I took to be a missile of some sort at an angle with itsnose in the ground. It looked like it skipped and blew a hole in the ground. It was like ahorseshoe with a canopy, fins and a tail. I'd say the craft was about 25 to 30 feet in lengthand maybe 15 feet wide. On the bottom there were tiles or something sort of geometricshaped that flashed red, blue - sort of changing all over the bottom."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Drawing of “craft of unknown origin” retrieved during U. S. Army operation near IndianTown Gap, Pennsylvania, in 1969. Sketched by retired U. S. Army Sgt. Clifford Stone athis home in Roswell, New Mexico for Howe © September 1998.Stone: “A tank retriever pulled it out and a big hoist crane raised it up. The canopy lookeddark black, even after the sun came up. I understood later talking to a Lieutenant that whenyou were on the inside, you could see out bright as day - even at night, like night vision.The craft was a dull grey metal at night. But with the sun up, it was like shiny aluminumfoil.“On one side of the craft near the canopy, a hatch was slid down and one of the entitieswas hung out about up to the chest. It had a pear-shaped head. I can't tell you too muchabout the eyes because I was so taken aback. The skin was like a chalky, greyish-white.And there were a couple of areas right along where the temples should be that - you knowwhat varicose veins are? It looked like that. They were raised up about the size of a pencil.That's why I could see them, they were so big.“The clothes was mostly silver with a dark trim. I didn't see any insignia. It had hands, anda thumb out to the side, but I couldn't tell you if it had three fingers, six fingers, or ten oneach hand. I was in shock.” Composite Model Based On William Rhodes' Photosand Military Sketches of Roswell Crescent-Shaped CraftComposite model of crescent-shaped aerial craft that allegedly crashedin Roswell region in 1947, produced by Tim Bauer, Senior Design Director,© 1999 The Franklin Mint, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
