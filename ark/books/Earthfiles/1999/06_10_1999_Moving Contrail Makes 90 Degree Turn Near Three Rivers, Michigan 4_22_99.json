Early in the morning ofApril 24, 1999 while he and his wife were driving toward Battle Creek, theywere so surprised that a moving contrail suddenly made a right angle turn thatthey pulled over into a parking lot to take the photograph shown here.April 24, 1999, Three Rivers, Michigan, 90-degree angled contrail.Photograph © 1999 by Alan Otterson.Later, after the Ottersons got back on the road, they stopped again to take aphotograph of an S-shaped contrail shown below.April 24, 1999, Three Rivers, Michigan, S-shaped contrail.Photograph © 1999 by Alan Otterson."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Interview:Alan Otterson, supermarket employee, Three Rivers, Michigan: \"I've alwaysbeen interested in the sky. I'm an amateur astronomer. Cloud formations andthings like that have always interested me. And we've lived in the flight path ofO'Hare to Detroit, Michigan. We see regular contrails every day. But these wereextremely different.We (with wife) were on our way to Battle Creek, Michigan that Saturday. Anddriving towards, we had to go through Three Rivers and just before ThreeRivers, I noticed this right angle contrail. We were driving along and I noticedthe contrail being formed and I thought, 'Boy, that's pretty weird!' So, we pulledover into this parking lot and just by habit I had my camera with me all the timenow.IT JUST HAPPENED TO BE FROM YOUR LETTER, THAT WHATYOU ARE SEEING AT THIS POINT IS A CONTRAIL THAT ISCOMING FROM THE ZENITH DIRECTION COMING STRAIGHTSORT OF DOWN.Right. Right. And then it abruptly made that turn. And I thought, 'Wow!' and wepulled over and I got out. I grabbed my camera and took a couple of pictures ofit.IT''S ALMOST AS RIGHT AN ANGLE AS ONE COULD DRAW ON APIECE OF PAPER. COULD YOU SEE ANY KIND OF A VEHICLETHAT WAS MAKING THIS RIGHT ANGLE CONTRAIL?No, I could just see the tip of the contrail, but I could not see any shining lightor like from wings or anything like that.DID YOUR WIFE? COULD SHE SEE ANYTHING?Yes, she could.COULD SHE SEE ANY VEHICLE MAKING THIS?No, she didn't see any vehicle. She just saw the contrail itself.DO YOU THINK IT'S UNUSUAL THAT YOU COULD NOT SEE SOMEKIND OF AERIAL VEHICLE MAKING THIS CONTRAIL?Yes, because usually you can see either the shining sunlight hitting off thevehicle, whatever it is - in this case we didn't. I don't know if it was because itwas in the eastern part of the sky as the sun was coming up. But we didn't seeany shape of object or anything like that.DID YOU TRY TO CALL ANY AIRPORT OR AUTHORITIES TO ASKTHEM WHAT COULD BE MAKING A RIGHT ANGLE CONTRAILTHAT YOU COULD STILL SEE IN THE PHOTOGRAPH?Well, I know that near that area is the Battle Creek International Airport andthey have a national guard based there. But as far as I know, all they have isA-10s and helicopters.YOU SAW THE CONTRAIL MOVING DOWN AND YOU AND YOURWIFE WATCHING, BOTH OF YOUR PAIRS OF EYES AREWATCHING, AND YOU SAW WITH YOUR OWN EYES THEMOMENT AT WHICH WHATEVER IS MAKING THE CONTRAIL DIDTHE SHARP 90-DEGREE TURN?Ye s ."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND WHEN THAT OCCURRED?I said to myself, 'Wow, this is really amazing!' I'm fairly familiar with differenttypes of aircraft and what they can do and can't do. And this just jumped rightout at you.WELL, WHAT DO WE HAVE THAT COULD MAKE A 90-DEGREECONTRAIL LIKE THIS?The only thing I can think of is some type of remote-controlled vehicles that weare experimenting with.THAT'S A GOOD IDEA, A REMOTE-CONTROLLED VEHICLE.You know, the unmanned.YES. AND IF WE ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH REMOTE-CONTROLLED VEHICLES, WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE THATWHOEVER IS EXPERIMENTING WITH THEM WOULD MAKE IT SOOBVIOUS THAT IT WOULD EMIT CONTRAILS?I'm not sure on that. I don't know whether it was intended for someone to see, orit was just by accident.SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED THAT SOME OF THESECONTRAILS MAY NOT BE MADE BY HUMANS AT ALL.That's another possibility. And I firmly believe there are other forms of life andthings like that - you know, some other odd things happen. I'm sure they are notall, shall I say, human engineered by themselves.LET'S MOVE TO THE OTHER PHOTOGRAPH THAT YOU SENTWITH THE RIGHT ANGLE AND IT IS THE SAME DAY. COULD YOUPLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND WHEN YOU TOOKTHIS ONE IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE RIGHT ANGLE THAT SHOWSTHIS VERY CLEAR S-SHAPED CONTRAIL.OK, we were moving further on down the road and we were a few miles fromBattle Creek. My wife happened to notice this S-shaped contrail. And she calledme and I looked at it and said, 'Wow, that's really neat.' So we stopped andhanded her the camera as we were driving the vehicle. I pulled over and she tookthe picture.THIS IS AFTER THE RIGHT ANGLE.Right. And I'm wondering if it could be the same vehicle doing them both. Ithought something really strange is going on and it's not anything normal oranything that was intended to really be seen. I think it was just by chance thatwe saw it.\"More Information:For more photographs and information about unusual contrail formations inNorth America since March 17, 1999, please see The Contrail Connection.We b s it e s :http://www.contrailconnection.com"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
