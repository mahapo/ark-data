Ash Fork is afarm community about a mile above sea level west of Flagstaff in the PrescottNational Forest region.On August first, a gelding on the Susan and Harley Cox ranch became weak.Other symptoms included: tongue hanging out, sweating, having a hard timemoving or standing up, eventually he went into seizures. So the Coxes had himput to sleep. Then in November, three more horses weakened, heads drooping,tongues hanging out, sweating, unable to get up and also had to be put to sleep.Their remaining four horses seemed OK. Susan told me, \"We thought we werefinally out of the hell hole in November.\"Interviews:1) Susan Cox, Horse Rancher, Ash Fork, Arizona: \"Their symptoms were allsimilar, but different. Because Muffy walked around with leg tremors for liketwo weeks. They kept telling me she is sloughing off the toxin. So, thenDecember comes around and it's the Tuesday before Christmas and the filly - themare that went down that was pregnant with the leg tremors, Muffy - this washer 18-month-old foal - started trembling in the front end. And she was in thepen with a 3-year-old mare. So, we watched her and she went down, wasparalyzed, couldn't move and she stayed like that that whole week untilSaturday morning when my husband and his friends could get her loaded intothe trailer and take her down to the Vet Diagnostics Lab down in Tucson at theuniversity there where they of course were going to put her to sleep.\"I've lost between $25,000 to $40,000 worth of animals. I owe $2,000 inveterinary bills, diagnostic lab results and also I owe $350 to the Gilbert EquineAnimal Surgical Unit there. Not only do I owe $2,000 in veterinary bills or labtests or whatever you may call it, my loss financially. Plus I had to turn awayeight breedings to my stallion which is 19 years old. He is foundation bloodquarter horse. He is like a fantastic animal and to turn away eight breedings at$450 a month plus $5/day mare care, you're looking in the thousands again thatI'm losing. Not only the emotional attachment. And my daughter's horse that webroke and trained and she was roping on it and everything else. I mean, thehorse was only five years old.\"Lab AnalysisThe lab could not determine a diagnosis and tests on the hay feed and water fortoxins were also negative. Five horses gone in six months. No insurance. Andnothing certain about what was wrong.Then on Christmas morning, neighboring ranchers Heidi and Larkie Baker's17-year-old mare could not stand up or eat her food. Two days later onDecember 27th, their 3-year-old stud colt had the same symptoms - tight jawmuscles, couldn't chew and went to the ground unable to get up. The Bakers"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"knew that Sue and Harley Cox had paid for veterinarian and lab analyses ontheir five dead horses without a clear diagnosis of what was wrong. The Bakersalso knew that at least four other horses and a mule had suffered paralysis anddied.So, they decided not to waste money and shot the mare and colt to put them outof their misery. The Bakers prayed their last surviving horse - a 4-year-oldmustang mare - would stay well. But after their stud colt died December 27th,Heidi Baker knew her mare was sick, too.2) Heidi Baker, Horse Owner, Ash Fork, Arizona: \"On the 27th, I noticedthat my mare named Geodi - I noticed that Geodi had a sore throat because shewas not drinking. She was not eating. And when she did try to drink, she couldnot swallow. So I gave her a whole bunch of throat lozenges, you know,because they like candy. And she was happy. That whole day she was verylethargic, just licking at food.Has anybody in the veterinarian community said to you, 'This is what wethink has killed the horses'?The State Vet told me straight out - he said, 'We cannot.' He looked me straightin the face and said, 'We are not able to rule out botulism, but we really do notbelieve it to be botulism. We believe it to be a toxin.' Those were his words tome.\"Botulism CLarkie Baker estimated that the region where the horses have been in ill in AshFork is only about 2 1/2 miles long and a half mile wide. A commondenominator are hundreds of crows everywhere and ranchers haul water intrucks to open cisterns where chlorine tablets are added. Humans and horsesand crows drink the same water. So far, water analyses have not turned up anysuspicious pathogen or poison, but the U. S. Dept. Of agriculture did findsomething that could be the source of Botulism C. I talked to Lloyd Brown,Public Information Officer for Arizona's Dept. of Agriculture in Phoenix.3) Lloyd Brown, Public Information Officer for Arizona's Dept. ofAgriculture in Phoenix: \"We were investigating the dumping of some animalsnearby there.Dead animals?It's related to dead animals. There was an animal dumped and left in an opengrave in June 1998. After that, other animals that died in that area were dumpedin the same location. That area was covered the week of January 25th. So all ofthose - I think the final count was five for sure and maybe sixth animal, andcertainly the birds and some of the local coyotes or local wildlife had beenfeeding on those remains.Wouldn't they have died as well?Birds are known to be carriers of botulism toxins and spores. So if you havebirds feeding on a rotting carcass and it's a dry year and those birds are flyingover the water buckets and getting a drink - so there is a little more to thisinvestigation that also is being considered.\"Arizona Dept. of Agriculture News Release About Horse DeathsAll the crows in Ash Fork could be eating exposed dead animals and theirdroppings ending up in the horses' water and food. On February 3 and 4, a teamof USDA veterinarians and pathologists joined Arizona State veterinarians tocollect bird droppings, soil, plants, and water at the Cox and Baker farms. Theteam also collected blood from the three remaining Cox horses to study."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Then on Friday, February 5, the Arizona Dept. of Agriculture released a newsupdate to the media that in part stated:\"Laboratory analysis found botulism type C spores in gut samplescollected from a horse that died in November 1998. Combined withthe clinical symptoms exhibited by the sick animals, the finding ofspores seems to support earlier assumptions that the cause of thedeaths probably is isolated to the Ash Fork area and probably is notspread by horse-to-horse contact.\"Meanwhile, the joint diagnostic team comprised of experts from theArizona Department of Agriculture, the Arizona VeterinaryDiagnostic Laboratory at the University of Arizona in Tucson and theU. S. Department of Agriculture, Animal Plant Health InspectionService, Veterinary Services, concluded its initial on-site investigationThursday, February 4.\"Livestock owners should contact the Arizona Dept. of AgricultureOffice of the State Veterinarian at 602-542-4293 for assistancegathering samples if they believe their animal is displayingbotulism-type symptoms. Botulism symptoms include muscle tremorsand weakness; difficulty swallowing, the tongue may hang out; andeventual paralysis of respiratory muscles causing death within 24 to72 hours.\"Steps to reduce exposure to botulism include making sure all deadanimals are buried or disposed of properly since decomposing flesh isknown to contribute to the formation of botulism type C toxin. Also,since birds may be involved in the dissemination of the botulismtoxin, horse owners should minimize the attraction of birds to animalareas - thus, cover hay piles and grain and regularly change water andclean water containers.\"The press release also pointed out there is no botulism Type C vaccine approvedfor horses.The lab where the botulism C spores were identified in the gut tissue of SueCox's horse was the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine.There, Dr. Robert Whitlock, Assoc. Prof. of Veterinary Medicine, is consideredone of the country's leading experts on botulism, especially botulism C. I askedDr. Whitlock to describe typical symptoms:4) Dr. Robert Whitlock, Assoc. Prof. of Veterinary Medicine, University ofPennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine: \"Typical clinical signs ofbotulism in adult horses are a bit variable, but are characterized essentially bymuscle weakness. This can be manifested in a variety of ways.Foals, for example, have a decreased responsiveness to nurse the mare. And orwhen they try to nurse the mare, the milk may fall out of the side of the lips.Because they are not able to control the muscles in their mouth well?Correct. And then they show evidence of laying down more than normal, butotherwise appear OK for the first few hours. They look normal, bright, alert andactive and then this progressively they become progressively more tired until thepoint where they cannot get up or unable to nurse. And then eventually theybecome recumbent. Some foals, as well as adult horses, may present with initialclinical signs of abdominal pain, although this is not common but does occur.And occasionally the abdominal pain may be so severe to mimic surgical colicand require surgical intervention, but again this is fairly rare. Mostly occurs in"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"adult horses.From the onset of botulism taking over a horse, what is the typical lengthof time they are sick before they die?The onset of the progression of the clinical signs of botulism in horses rangesenormously, from as short as a few hours to over several days to two or threeweeks and some horses may actually recover from botulism without treatment.In the Arizona case, I think part of the confusion among the ranchers Iinterviewed and why they are rejecting botulism as an explanation isbecause in a few of the cases, the horses had been alive for some period,even for weeks with symptoms of weakness and muscle trembling, but notdying in three or four days.Botulism as a disease is toxin-dose dependent. So it only makes sense that themore toxin the horse or any animal ingests and the more they absorb from the GItract, the more rapid the progression of clinical signs. If it's a massive dose oftoxin, horses can ingest it and be dead within 12 hours and never be seen to beabnormal by the owner. But that's extremely unusual.Most horses do progress over periods of 3 to 5 days, gradually becoming moreweak and recumbent. Most horses show some inability to eat normally orswallow normally. Then once they get down, on occasion will get up and downfor a few days and it depends upon continued absorption of toxins in the gut orhow much they absorbed to begin with as to whether or not they will recover orgo ahead and die.Is it true that birds can pick away at dead carcasses and take in thebotulism spores to the birds and then transfer it around the countryside intheir droppings if infecting horses without the birds themselves dying?That is suspected to occur and not been proven to occur. But that is a plausibleexplanation. Because in this outbreak - there are different types of botulism strains, if you will, of A, B. C. D. E. F. and G and this is type C. Type C is mostoften associated with carrion or dead animals. And then the toxins are producedin the dead animals. The horse has access to that animal or person or whatever -but usually the dead animal. Whereas Type A or B botulism are considered to besoil contaminants - they get into the forage and the forage is not preservedcorrectly and the botulism spores form toxins in the forage. And Type C isprobably from carrion.This botulism Type C they found spores in the gut of one horse.Two samples from one horse - there was pretty strong concentration, that iscorrect.Did the Dept. of Agriculture in Arizona and the state veterinarian inArizona go over each of these thirteen cases with you?No. I have a very sketchy history by talking to other veterinarians, primarily thatin the last month out there.So you have talked with some Arizona vets?Ye s .In terms of the description of symptoms as described to you, what has beenyour overall impression?Overall impression some of them seem compatible with botulism, but some ofthe signs were not. And I guess what I'm wondering is it possible that all these13 horses might not have the same problem. Some could have botulism andsome not. I think it needs - each horse needs to be evaluated by itself and lookat the progression of events. For example, in one or two cases that other"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"veterinarians talked about were dog setting and getting up and down repeatedly.Well, dog sitting position is not typical of botulism. That doesn't mean that itdoesn't occur, but it's very uncommon. And if there were repeated dog sittingand repeated getting up and down over a period of 5 to 7 days, I would thinkthat was highly unlikely to be botulism.Does it remind you of any syndrome you are aware of?Yes, herpes myelitis.Herpes myelitis. How would the horses get that?It's a virus infection among the horse population. A lot of people get herpes theyget exposed to other horses that have it and other people.Have they tested for this?I don't know.Is it typical of herpes myelitis or botulism C to have clusters of deaths?Yes, very much so.\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
