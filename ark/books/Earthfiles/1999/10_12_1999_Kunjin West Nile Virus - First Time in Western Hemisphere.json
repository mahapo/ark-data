Y. Starting back around July 1999,residents in Queens, New York began calling their city's wildlife office to reportvarious types of birds on the ground shaking, wobbling and disoriented. Thencrows at the Bronx Zoo and surrounding areas kept dying. Dozens of them.Pathology tests showed mysterious lesions in the brains and hearts.By August, doctors in New York's Flushing Hospital were seeing an increasingnumber of people with fever, mental confusion and severe weakness. Thecombination of symptoms was confusing because usually in cases ofencephalitis, which is an inflammation of brain tissue, patients hallucinate, areout of control and sometimes have seizures. These new patients weredisoriented, but were so weak they could not move.By Labor Day, three Bronx Zoo flamingos, an Asian pheasant and a cormorantall died. Pathology tests showed the same heart and brain lesions found in thedead crows. Dr. Tracey McNamara at the Wildlife Conservation Societycontacted the USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa.There, researchers found virus particles that resembled a Flavivirus known in theUnited States as St. Louis Encephalitis. The St. Louis Flavivirus can only betransmitted by ticks and mosquitoes known as \"vectors\" in the medicalcommunity. For example, let's say a virus-carrying female mosquito bites a bird.Only female mosquitoes feed on blood. When birds are infected, their bloodrapidly fills up with the virus for a week or so. If another mosquito comes along,bites the infected bird and then a human, the virus can get into the humansystem.Photograph of Culex pipiens female mosquito,courtesy Entomology Image Gallery.By the end of September, human encephalitis cases were piling up inManhattan, Queens, Long Island and Connecticut. And more dead crows werefound in northern New Jersey. The New York Department of Public Health sentbrain tissue from two of six fatalities to Dr. Ian Lipkin, Director of the Emerging"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Diseases Laboratory and Professor of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics,Anatomy and Neural Biology and Neurology at the University of California-Irvine. By September 23rd, he and his California team announced the culpritwas not St. Louis Encephalitis. It was a virus never before seen in the WesternHemisphere called Kunjin/West Nile Fever.Interviews:W. Ian Lipkin, M.D., Director of the Emerging Diseases Laboratory andProfessor of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Anatomy and NeuralBiology and Neurology, University of California-Irvine: \"We have said it is aKunjin/West Nile-like virus. (But so far) we only have a small percentage of thegenome cloned.FROM TWO OF THE BODIES FROM NEW YORK, OR THE BRAINS?We've actually got sequence now from two brains, that's correct. But thesequences are virtually identical to the bird because we have compared them tosequences that have been obtained from the New York State Health Departmentand at least the regions that we've compared to date, there really doesn't appearto be any difference.BETWEEN WHAT'S IN THE CROW AND THE PEOPLE?That's correct. I would assume that we're talking about the same agent. Thequestion is: where did it originate?\" What Is Behind Virus's Sudden Appearance in the United States?BEFORE NOW, KUNJIN/WEST NILE VIRUS HAD ONLY BEENIDENTIFIED IN AUSTRALIA, AFRICA, ASIA AND EUROPE. I TALKEDABOUT THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE IN THE UNITED STATES WITH DR.THOMAS MONATH, A HARVARD TRAINED VIROLOGIST AND ONE OFTHE LEADING AMERICAN EXPERTS ON ARBOVIRUSES THAT SPREADTHROUGH TICKS AND MOSQUITOES.Thomas Monath, M. D., Virologist and Arbovirus Specialist, OraVax,Cambridge, Massachusetts: \"My first impression was, 'This is an incredibleevent!' In my career, there have been very few instances of such a dramaticemerging infection story. I've lived through a number of new viruses that haveappeared, but to have an Old World virus like West Nile appear in NorthAmerica is something we said could happen for many years, but sort ofdismissed it as a low probability. So, I find it quite extraordinary. It's one of thebiggest stories in virology of this century, certainly. And hopefully, it was a flashin the pan and we're not going to have to now suffer repeatedly from outbreaksof West Nile. But certainly, I am extremely interested and very shocked that thishappened.COULD THIS CURRENT ROUND THAT IS INVOLVING SO MANYDEATHS IN THE CROWS AND HALF A DOZEN DEATHS IN HUMANS WOULD THAT RESPONSE BE BECAUSE THE VIRUS HASMUTATED? OR BECAUSE THIS WESTERN POPULATION OF BOTHBIRDS AND HUMANS HAS NO NATURAL IMMUNITY BECAUSE THEVIRUS HAS NOT SHOWN UP HERE BEFORE?\"I think we're clearly dealing with a strain of virus that has certain let's not callthem mutations, but has a genetic sequence that directs the virus to be virulentfor crows and to cause human illness. In some outbreaks of West Nile, therehave been no illness in crows or other birds and illness in humans has beenexceptionally mild, with no encephalitis cases or deaths. So, this is a variant ofWest Nile virus that is similar to others that have been described before, but hasthis capability of causing central nervous system infection.SO IT IS MORE VIRULENT?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Looking at what's known today, I would conclude yes, this is a strain of WestNile on the more virulent end of the spectrum of virulence. But is probably notvery different from other strains that have caused other outbreaks in the past.The case fatality rates in humans is a good measure here. In other words, of thepeople who got encephalitis, what proportion died? That would be an accurateway of looking, from a medical perspective, looking at the virulence of the virus.So, that lethality or case fatality rate, we call it, in this outbreak which is aboutfifteen percent or so is not different from the case fatality rate in the 1996outbreak in Rumania. It seems to be similar to the outbreak coming out in Russianow from all reports. So, I think we are dealing with a virus of similarvirulence.\" West Nile Fever in Russia and New York At Same Time:IN 1996 TO 1997, THERE WERE MORE THAN 500 CLINICAL CASES OFWEST NILE FEVER IN BUCHAREST, ROMANIA. AND THIS SEPTEMBERWHILE ALL THE CROWS WERE DYING AND DOZENS OF PEOPLEBECAME ILL IN NEW YORK, 559 CASES AND 33 DEATHS INVOLGOGRAD, RUSSIA THE OLD STALINGRAD WERE ATTRIBUTED TOAN OUTBREAK OF WEST NILE FEVER AS WELL.W. Ian Lipkin, M. D. and Microbiologist: \"Now, if we can get access to theRussian isolates, that might give us a lot of information. So, we'll have to see ifwe can do that.THE QUESTION THAT WAS RAISED SUNDAY AND MONDAY IN THENEW YORK MEDIA AND REUTERS ABOUT THE FBI AND CIALOOKING INTO THIS AS POSSIBLY CONNECTED TO A SADAMHUSSEIN EFFORT TO ENGINEER WEST NILE FEVER - IF THEREWAS AN ENGINEERED MUTATION IN A VIRUS, IS THERE ANY WAYTHAT WE COULD TELL A DIFFERENCE FROM A NATURALMUTATION?That's an excellent question. If there is a sequence that is clearly present fromanother virus which looks like it was spliced in, yes, you could tell that. I haveno idea if we'll find anything like that because we haven't yet sequenced to thatextent. But, that would be evidence.IS KUNJIN ITSELF A MORE VIRULENT, SLIGHTLY MOREVIRULENT, STRAIN?No, it isn't. In fact, it's less virulent. But that doesn't really matter. When youwork in viral pathogenesis which is the study of how viruses cause disease, youlearn that very small changes in the sequence of a virus can result in markedchanges of its ability to cause disease. This has been shown over and over again.So, the key is that we will need to analyze how this virus replicates, how itresults in disease and so on.THE CROWS SEEM TO BE LIKE THE CANARY IN THE CAGE FORTHE MINERS. I would agree that's an excellent analogy that's more or less theway we view it.WE HAVE TO KEEP WATCHING THE BIRDS UP AND DOWN THEEAST COAST. WHAT WOULD BE YOUR GUESS, BASED ON YOURMEDICAL EXPERIENCE, FOR WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN NEXTSPRING, SUMMER AND FALL? IS IT LIKELY THAT THIS KIND OFVIRUS COULD PERPETUATE ITSELF THROUGH THE WINTERAND RE-OCCUR IN THE SPRING?It's something that concerns all of us. It's obviously something that worries us.But as to what the probability is, I don't know.\"Will West Nile Fever Virus Spread in Spring 2000?Thomas Monath, M. D., Virologist: \"This is the $64,000 question. The"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"possibilities are that the virus is able to over-winter or survive in the area ofepidemic. So, the greater New York area, Connecticut, Long Island, New Jerseyand so on. And then could re-appear next spring from a local reservoir. That'sone possibility.The other is that it's re-introduced by migratory birds coming from SouthAmerica. In other words, the virus was here in North America this year,migratory birds got infected and took it south. Now, it gets re-introduced nextyear.MOSQUITOES ACTUALLY SURVIVE THE WINTER?Ye s , Culex pipiens hibernate. (Species of mosquito associated with West NileFever). So, the mosquitoes go into protected, warm dark areas, cellars, tunnelswhere they can hibernate. They are inactive. They don't blood-feed. But theysurvive in the adult stage over the winter.ANY POSSIBILITY THAT IF IT RE-EMERGES NEXT SPRING BASEDON THE HISTORY OF STUDYING THESE VIRUSES IN AFRICA ANDEURASIA, THAT SINCE THEY DO MUTATE AND IT ALREADY HASCAUSED SO MANY DEATHS IN CROWS AND HALF A DOZEN INPEOPLE THAT IT COULD ACTUALLY BE WORSE NEXT SPRING?It could go the other way, too. These viruses are very their genetic material isvery plastic. Very high rate of mutation. I don't know. Theoretically you couldpropose that because new mosquitoes and new bird species were involved thatthat might put pressure on the virus to change quicker than in Africa and the OldWorld where it's become fixed in its host vector association. I think it's possiblethat involvement of new vectors and hosts could put pressure towards virulence,increased virulence in the virus. This is highly speculative.\" Origins of the West Nile Fever Virus:WHERE DID THE NEWLY EMERGING VIRUS IN NORTH AMERICACOME FROM IN THE FIRST PLACE? THE PROFESSIONAL CONSENSUSIS PROBABLY BY AN AIRPLANE TRAVELER FROM EURASIA, AFRICAOR AUSTRALIA. OR LESS LIKELY, AN ILLEGALLY IMPORTED BIRD ORA MIGRATING BIRD THAT GOT BLOWN OFF COURSE BY THEWEATHER.BUT SINCE THE POSSIBILITY OF A BIOTERRORIST MANIPULATION OFTHE VIRUS HAS BEEN RAISED, I TALKED WITH DR. ALAN ZELICOFF,SENIOR SCIENTIST IN THE CENTER FOR NATIONAL SECURITY ANDARMS CONTROL AT SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORIES INALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO. DR. ZELICOFF ALSO SERVES ON AGOVERNMENT PANEL OF EXPERTS WHO ARE TRYING TOCOORDINATE WITH THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL TODISTRIBUTE MORE INFORMATION TO ALL GOVERNMENT AGENCIESABOUT DISEASE OUTBREAKS AMONG HUMANS, ANIMALS ANDPLANTS. I ASKED HIM IF THERE WAS ANY REASON WHY WEST NILEFEVER MIGHT BE UNDER ANY CONSIDERATION BY SOMEBODY LIKESADDAM HUSSEIN AS A VIRUS FOR ATTACK ON THE UNITED STATES?Alan Zelicoff, M. D., Internal Medicine with a fellowship in Immunologyand Rheumatology, Sandia National Laboratory, Albuquerque, NewMexico: \"I think it is highly unlikely and the reason I think it is highly unlikelyis that the efficiency of transmission, if one were to introduce this virus bymosquito or by bird the efficiency of the transmission into humans is stillextraordinarily low. And it would strike me as far from optimal for a biologicalweapon used in a terrorist mode.When we look at the Iraqi biological and chemical weapons program, theinformation that was gathered by UNSCOM brings up a number of peculiarsurprises. We know that they had requested and received some small amount of"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"West Nile Fever virus, but we have no evidence that they produced it in largeamounts, nor do we even find the capability that they were able to produce WestNile Fever in large amounts.COULD YOU EXPLAIN HOW YOU KNOW THAT SADDAM HUSSEINREQUESTED WEST NILE FEVER VIRUS AND WHERE WOULD HEGET IT?I read that in the newspaper and I believe he got it by request from some supplyhouse in the mid-1980s. I think it was perfectly easy to do that back then. It'snow much more difficult to do so.SO HE ACTUALLY GOT WEST NILE FEVER VIRUS FROM A LAB INTHE UNITED STATES BY PURCHASING IT IN THE 1980S?That's my understanding, yes.THAT RAISES THE QUESTION AGAIN, WHAT WOULD HE OR HISMEDICAL COMMUNITY HAVE ON THEIR MINDS ABOUT WHYTHEY WOULD PICK THAT PARTICULAR VIRUS?That's a good question. There is a very thin line between working withdangerous pathogens for legitimate purposes, such as development of vaccine orunderstanding the fundamental physiology of the virus, and doing the same kindof research for purposes of developing a weapon. Unfortunately, it comes downto an issue of intent. There is no difference between the research that is done inthe earliest stages between developing a biological weapon and doing legitimatemedical research.WHAT DO YOU THINK IN THE UNITED STATES WE CAN DO INTERMS OF ANTICIPATING AND DEFENDING OURSELVESAGAINST BIOTERRORIST ATTACK WITH ANTHRAX OR SMALLPOX?Well, we have a multi-pronged approach and it is a combination of sensors thatdo continual monitoring of the air, an increasing reporting network specificallydesigned to make it easy for physicians and veterinarians to enter in data into acentralized data base over the internet. And then there is a healthy dose ofintelligence that finds its way into the mix as well.HOW DO WE MONITOR THE ATMOSPHERE?One has to do it with more or less continuous sampling and in a way that doesnot result in a lot of false alarms. So, at the Department of Energy NationalLaboratories, there is a very robust program in developing small, inexpensive,automated sensors specifically designed to pick up the physical as well aschemical characteristics of the coatings on anthrax spores, many different virustypes and also virtually all chemical weapons and materials. And that programwhich has been in existence now for about three years has made enormous gainsand the first prototypes will probably actually be installed in certain high risksettings over the next year or so.DO THESE DEVICES GO UP INTO THE AIR?They literally just sample the air. So, they don't necessarily fly around, althoughthey can. They are generally meant to be placed in single spots. They are called\"point sensors.\" And they continuously monitor the air and feed that dataautomatically into an automated data base. And the nice thing about them isthey have a low false alarm rate, much less than the smoke detector in yourhouse. They require very little power and they can operate autonomously formonths at a time.THOSE ARE GROUND BASED SENSORS?Ground, but they may be high up off the ground like in a building, for example.Our surveillance for infectious disease as well as infectious disease that iscommunicable from person to person needs to be beefed up substantially. TheCDC has been arguing that point for many years, I think, quite correctly. And Ibelieve that this is a wake up call that should enlighten all of us, includingpolicy and decision makers that more effort needs to be put into diseasesurveillance as well as making it easy for health care practitioners, includingveterinary health care practitioners, to report to a centralized data base that will"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"enable very rapid distribution of the information.\"More Information:The discovery of the Kunjin/West Nile virus in New York and surroundingcommunities underscores an issue of growing concern among public healthexperts the speed and frequency with which foreign microbes are entering the U.S. They are coming in through air travel, global tourism and international trade.For example, the number of malaria cases in New York has been going up adirect result of people bringing the disease back from the tropics. Humans makethe problem worse by cutting down forests that force birds into moreconcentrated areas where disease can spread more easily.This encephalitis outbreak and the associated human deaths show that whenmicrobes are released into an environment where they have not been before, themicrobes can be especially dangerous because what they infect has no immunityagainst them. According to the New York City Department of Health, 39patients have been classified as laboratory positive cases of West Nile virus inNew York City with six deaths and 168 cases under investigation.Swine Flu Pandemic of 1918Back in 1918, there was a world pandemic called \"the swine flu\" which killedan estimated twenty million people worldwide and more than half a millionpeople in the United States. The reason was that a virus crossed over into pigsand then transferred into people who had no immunity. Could anotherpandemic occur?Communication without delay has been stressed and hospitals have been askedto contact their particular State's Department of Health immediately if there areany suspected or confirmed cases of St. Louis Encephalitis or West Nile Fevervirus. Individuals who find one or more dead birds should report the location totheir local health department.We b s it e s :http://www.cdc.gov/http://www.who.org/http://www.health.state.ny.us/http://www.state.nj.us/healthhttp://www.reutershealth.com/eline/open/1999101108.htmlhttp://www.ent.iastate.edu/imagegal/diptera/culicidae/cxpipf.htmlhttp://www.cdc.govhttp://www.who.orghttp://www.health.state.ny.us/http://www.state.nj.us/healthhttp://www.reutershealth.com/eline/open/1999101108.htmlhttp://www.ent.iastate.edu/imagegal/diptera/culicidae/cxpipf.htmlCredits"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
