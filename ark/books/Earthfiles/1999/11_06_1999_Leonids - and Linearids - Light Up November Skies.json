This is not for thefamous Leonids. A newly discovered comet this year called Comet LINEARmade its closest approach to the Sun in September. Earth will be passingthrough whatever dusty debris the comet left in our planet's orbital path onNovember 11th. This new meteor shower will be called Linearids, not to beconfused with Leonids that will arrive a week later on November 18th. Thosedates are around New Moon, so dark skies beyond city lights will help meteorwatches. But since no one has seen this comet before, scientists don't knowwhether it will leave a strong meteor wake or not.After astronomers studied the orbital elements of Comet LINEAR, it's estimatedthat this comet cycles through the inner solar system only once every 63,000years. If it left enough debris to produce a good meteor shower, the Linearidswill appear to come from the bowl of the Big Dipper constellation. Earth'sclosest approach to Comet LINEAR's orbital wake will be at 2:41 PM EST soAsia might have the best chance to see.In contrast, Comet Tempel-Tuttle that produces the annual November 17-18Leonid meteor shower cycles through every thirty-three years. Since it passedclosest to the sun in February 1998, the November showers in 1998 and 1999were expected to produce dramatic displays. Last year, the Leonids peaked overEurope with about 300 meteors flashing through the sky each hour. Someastronomers are predicting even more this year over western Europe and theAtlantic."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"An exploding Leonid meteor over Hong Kong on November 17, 1998.A second smaller meteor is visible above the fireball.Photograph © 1998 by Ben Wong, Hong Kong.The best time to start watching in the United States will be from midnight todawn on both November 17 and 18. Most will appear to come from theconstellation Leo traveling at more than 158,000 miles per hour. When thecomet's dust and rocky debris hit the earth's atmosphere, they can appear red topink in color or white and blue-white to pale green.More Information:For Linearid Watching November 10, 11 and 12: Experts aren't sure whattime is best to try observing because so little is known about the distribution ofdust around this new comet that has not been through the inner solar system for63,000 years. But the place to watch is the Big Dipper from midnight on.For Leonid Watching November 17-18: The Leonids might be morespectacular this year than 1998. Most comfortable way to watch will be to laydown in a lawn chair with your feet pointing towards the east and theconstellation Leo. Most of the meteors will appear to come from there andmight exceed the 300 flashes per hour in 1998.We b s it e s :http://science.nasa.gov/http://www.imo.net/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
