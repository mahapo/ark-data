The first die offwas 200,000 menhaden and other freshwater fish. Then this past week, anotherhalf million were found floating belly up and piled along the creek banks. Thisbrings the total for July in just those two tributaries to over 700,000 dead fish the Chesapeake's worst fish kill in a decade.Maryland Governor Parris Glendening and other officials are trying to sort outthe cause. So far, tests indicate that the part animal/part plant dinoflagellatecalled Pfiesteria is NOT involved. Pfiesteria eats the flesh of fish producinglarge, round sores and affects the nervous system so that the fish swim in circlesand upside down. No fish found this past week had such lesions.The culprit this time seems to be lack of dissolved oxygen caused by severedrought along the Eastern seaboard. Phosphorous and nitrogen from fertilizerand pesticide runoffs have built up in shallow estuaries, causing algae bloomsthat take oxygen from the water and leave fish gasping for air.Global WarmingIn other environmental news, computer projections of earth's climate keepshowing the same trend: the next ten years could warm up as much as the worldhas warmed in the last 100 years. Such an increase in the rapidity of globalwarming has a variety of consequences both predictable and unpredictable.For example, there are few if any icebergs in the Grand Banks shippinglanes off Newfoundland.The Monterey California Bay Institute reports that since 1992, there hasbeen a huge decline in salmon on the Pacific Coast. Plus, they're smallerand have less fat.California will have more rain and more coast flooding as computersproject that sea levels will rise by one to three feet around North Americain the next 100 years.New York City could also suffer repeated flooding, soaking subways andturning parts of Brooklyn into wetlands, according to a recentEnvironmental Defense Fund and Columbia University study.New projections of global warming indicate it might be even slightly worsethan originally forecast. Instead of one to six degrees Fahrenheit increasein average global temperature, new computer projections show a two toseven degree increase, according to the National Center for AtmosphericResearch in Boulder, Colorado. To put that one more degree increase intoperspective that one degree equals the entire amount of rise in average"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"global temperature over the last century. Scientists are more and moreconvinced that all this is happening because 20th Century industries haveput greenhouse gasses into the earth's atmosphere, creating a kind ofblanket around the world which holds in heat. Link Between Epidemics and Warm Ocean Surface TemperaturesIn last week's journal Science, researchers at NASA's Goddard Space FlightCenter in Greenbelt, Maryland reported the first confirmed link between warmocean surface temperatures in the Pacific and Indian oceans with epidemics ofRift Valley Fever in Africa. That disease is hemorrhagic meaning that affectedanimals and people vomit blood and bleed from body orifices. Goddard seniorearth scientist, Dr. Compton Tucker, says: \"We feel the links between oceanwarming and Rift Valley Fever are solid and the associations are clear.\"The warming of ocean waters begins with El Nino in the Pacific which producesmore rain in parts of Africa. More rain means more mosquitoes such as theAedes macintoshi and others which can carry the Rift Valley Fever virus.Photo Credit: Aedes mosquito, a species that carries different viruses,including the virus responsible for Rift Valley Fever which causes hemorrhaging and can befatal.Some of those insect eggs already have the viral disease in them when the rainscome. After hatching, the infected mosquitoes bite goats, cattle and otheranimals to drink blood and spread the Rift Valley Fever hemorrhagic virus toanimals and people. There were serious epidemics of the virus in the mid-1970sand again twenty years later in the mid-1990s. Dr. Tucker says the epidemics aredirectly linked to periods of abnormally high rainfall.Interview:Compton Tucker, Ph.D., Senior Earth Scientist (Satellite Studies ofEcology and Biology), NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt,Maryland 20771: \"It is the rainfall which triggers the hatching of themosquitoes and we simply use satellite data to study large areas in Africa toidentify when those periods of abnormally high rainfall occur.In the course of that study, we determined that this was actually driven for largescale events by a concurrent or simultaneous sea surface temperature warming inthe Indian Ocean and in the Tropical Pacific. The Tropical Pacific situation weknow as El Nino. When that is coupled with a very high sea surface temperaturesituation in the Indian Ocean when both of these areas are dancing to the sametune we have periods of very high rainfall and we have outbreaks of Rift ValleyFever in Africa."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"NOW HOW DOES THE RIFT VALLEY FEVER DIFFER FROMEBOLA?Well, in the case of Ebola, if you've read The Hot Zone or have seen that moviewith Dustin Hoffman that dealt with something like Ebola or the Marburg virus.Those are very virulent and nasty hemorrhagic fevers with a high degree ofmortality in people who are infected. In the case of Rift Valley Fever that is alsoa hemorrhagic fever - it is much less dangerous than Ebola or Marburg. Itsprimary effect is on the animal population sheep, goats, cattle, camels, animalslike that. But during virulent periods in east and southern Africa, it can jumpfrom the animal population into people and cause a fairly high degree ofmortality as well.HAVE THERE BEEN ANY CASES IN WHICH PEOPLE TRAVELINGFROM THEU. S. OR EUROPE TO AFRICA HAVE CONTRACTED RIFT VALLEYFEVER AND BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE U. S., FOR EXAMPLE?During serious outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever, which on average occur every 8 to10 years, and as we report in our paper this occurs when you have these veryunusual periods of rainfall which we're able to predict with satellite data of seasurface temperatures. And we then confirm that with satellite data which wecollect every day over Africa to double check on our predictions. To myknowledge, no one has returned to the U. S. with Rift Valley Fever, but I'm sureit's probably happened. During some of the serious Rift Valley outbreaks,thousands of people have perished, unfortunately.WHAT RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF GLOBAL OCEAN SURFACETEMPERATURES IS SHOWING UP IN SATELLITE DATA IN TERMSOF ANY WARMING?At the moment we are in what is called a La Nina which is the opposite of ElNino which means you have COOLER than normal sea surface temperatures inthe tropical Pacific. This tends to cause dry periods in southern and easternSouth America as well as other areas. At the moment, this is not toopronounced, although everyone is watching with great curiosity and interest incase it might develop into something more serious.THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS TIE BETWEEN WARMING OCEANSAND HEALTH SEEMS TO IMPLY THAT IT MIGHT EXTEND TODISEASES BEYOND THE RIFT VALLEY FEVER. IS THATCORRECT?Ebola: Yes, that's correct. I'm working with a graduate student on a new paperand we're looking at the cluster of Ebola outbreaks in Equatorial Africa in themid-1970s. Things were then very quiet for 20 years until the mid-1990s,1994-95, when you had a series of Ebola outbreaks again. These are verycurious events. By using satellite data, we are able to get an idea and to studythese widely different areas objectively. If we didn't have satellite data, thesestudies would be very difficult to do.Hanta Virus: We're also looking at some other ecologically or climaticallyconnected diseases such as the Hanta virus which occurs in the southwestern U.S. This is also hemorrhagic fever, it's linked to very wet periods following dryperiods when you have an outbreak of the rodents apparently which are thehosts, or are implicated in the spread of the disease. That is one disease whichdoes effect the U. S. and which I think satellite data should be very useful toidentify when these outbreaks will occur and then to identify more specificallythe actual areas which will be affected.IT WOULD SEEM THAT WHAT'S EMERGING FROM YOUR WORKIS SOMETHING LIKE LONG TERM HEALTH FORECASTS, SIMILARTO WEATHER FORECASTS.Malaria, Dengue and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis: Well, you canprobably think of it as a subset of the weather forecast. There are several"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"diseases such as the Hanta virus, Ebola, Rift Valley Fever, perhaps malaria,dengue and other diseases which we don't have in the U. S. fortunately such asVenezuelan Equine Encephalitis. These diseases appear to be directly andunequivocally coupled with climate and with weather abnormalities. And so byhaving more accurate weather forecasts and also having a time history ofinformation back over the past 20 or 30 years, you are then able to identify whatthe circumstances were that were associated with the outbreaks of these diseasesfrom their respective outbreak locations. And then apply that in the future.THE CONDITIONS COULD VARY FROM EITHER NEEDING A LOTOF MOISTURE OR DRYNESS?They could. For example, in the case of Ebola it looks like it may be triggeredby a period of very wet conditions followed by a period over several years ofvery dry conditions. It could easily be one way or the other. It just depends onwhat the vectors or hosts are (mosquitoes are one type of host in which theviruses spread) and what triggers their jump from their host into the vector(infected animals) and then into the human population.ARE THERE EXAMPLES IN THE 1990S WHERE YOUR WORK ANDSATELLITE DATA HAVE ACTUALLY AFFECTED PUBLIC HEALTHANTICIPATING THE BREAK OUT OF DISEASE AND GETTINGMORE MEDICINES IN STOCK?In an indirect way. For example, a month or two ago, there was a reported Ebolaoutbreak in Zaire, or the Congo. And at this time, the World HealthOrganization contacted Mr. Jim Wilson, who is a 4th year medical student whohas been working with me the past several months studying Ebola. Mr. Wilsonand I then compared our satellite data history of the cluster of Ebola outbreaksin the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s to the particular circumstances for thisspecific location in equatorial Africa. We concluded very quickly in just a matterof a few minutes that this did not match the profile.We then informed WHO that in our opinion this was not an outbreak of Ebola.It turned out one or two weeks later when the detailed lab work was done onsome of the people who perished from this disease that it had been an outbreakof the Marburg virus instead. So, we were able to alert people even though theyhad no confidence in our findings at the time that this was not Ebola. Bit it justdidn't match the profile and we were right based on the profile of past historicsatellite data.We hope in the future to be able to turn this around and actually have advancewarning of the outbreak of diseases based upon climatic and satellite data andactually predict, as you said, when these will occur and where.\"More Information:Global Travel and Virus Spread: How fast could a virus spread from one part ofthe world to another? Nearly all of the world's major cities are less than 24hours apart by air. For example, from Nairobi, Kenya in Africa, it is possiblethat a virus could be spread by infected passengers to any cities listed belowwithin a day.This information was prepared by COTF, Classroom of the Future Â© 1997,1998 by Wheeling Jesuit University/NASAClassroom of the Future. www.cotf.edu/ete/modules/rift/rvspreadingviruses.htmlFrom Nairobi, Kenya, Africa to:Bombay 5 hr 55 minSidney 16 h 55 min"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Hong Kong 14 h 30 minRome 19 h 15 minLondon 8 h 50 minToronto 16 h 30 minNew York City 16 h 30 minLos Angeles 19 h 40 minMiami 18 h 10 minMexico City 10 h 20Rio de Janeiro 20 h 50 minBoston 15 hChicago 16 h 30 minTucson 19 hSan Francisco 18 h 45 minWe b s it e s :www.cotf.edu/ete/modules/rift/rvspreadingviruses.htmlCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
