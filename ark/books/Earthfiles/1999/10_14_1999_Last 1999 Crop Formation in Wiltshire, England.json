Pi is also used in mathematics torepresent that ratio of the circumference of a circle to the diameter which is3.14159 to many more decimal places.Peter's e-mail continued: \"And, to my knowledge, it is the last one in Englandfor the Millennium! Several of its nine major circles (center and eightsurrounding ones) also had very peculiar lays, including raised, snake-like coilsthat could be clearly seen from the air.A center coil created by stems laid over several inches above the groundaround a \"fountain\" of standing wheat discovered September 1, 1999 in Avebury,Wiltshire, England.

The formation had occurred in one of the very last fields still standing.The wheat, past due for harvesting, was shabby, with its ears bent down andreadily released seeds if rubbed gently between the fingers. There were alsosome small bald patches which added to its disheveled appearance. Yet the laywas every bit as amazing as we expected!The unique 'snakes' were formed by narrow arcs of crop which was bent(crimped) over as high as a foot above the ground, and therefore a good eightinches above the more normally flattened crop that surrounded them. The term,'snake,' was coined because one of them suggested a loosely coiled serpent, buton the ground the arcs defied comparison to anything. They were curved, puffybands which was bent over much higher than the surrounding lay. Virtuallyevery large circle in the formation had them, but only a few were dramatic.Coil created by stems laid over several inches above the groundaround a swirl of wheat.

The very center was a small, ordinary clockwiseswirl with a 'bird's nest' in the middle. There had been a clump of standing stalksinside the nest, but these had been cleanly cut off a few inches from the ground probably taken by someone sampling the crop. This central swirl overlapped aradial lay that went out about ten feet before it which in turn overlapped aclockwise, concentric lay. (The radial and concentric flows are distinct in theaerial shot, but the little central swirl is barely recognizable.) I have never heardof combined radial and concentric flattening. Radial is rare enough!"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Large central circle with man standing on radial lay splayed out in 360 degreessurrounded by concentric flattened wheat flowing in clockwise direction.Photograph © 1999 by Peter Sorensen, Avebury, Wiltshire, England September 2, 1999.The Greek Pi symbol was a controversial feature. Suggestive of a signature, somecroppies have rejected the entire formation because of it, while others believe itwas merely added by an early visitor. Still others are adamant that it was/is veryimportant to the original formation. At least two dowsers found positive results.Mathematical symbol Pi next to eight-armed formationlike a \"signature.\" Photograph © 1999 by Peter Sorensen,Avebury, Wiltshire, England, September 2, 1999.Charles and Frances Mallet reported that the tapering point at the right end ofthe Pi's curvy, horizontal stroke, had a very thin (2 or 3 inch-wide) linemeandering off and out into the standing crop for well over a hundred feet.Amazingly, it was crimped down just a few inches below the ears of wheat - notat the bottom of the stalks! Unfortunately, no one took an aerial close-up of thePi, although one of my pole shots shows the horizontal stroke tapering to finepoint, and there appears to be a line going straight off from it a ways.When Charley tried to photograph it, his camera failed. He was surprised, notonly because his camera had never had a problem before, but because it was avery old, mechanical camera with no electronics in it. Assuming it had simplydecided to break down after all these years, he was taken aback when hethought to test it with a shot of the formation from the roadside and his camerathen worked perfectly. His curiosity peaked, he went back into the circle and thecamera again failed - only to behave when he returned to the road. [If anyonehas a photo of the mysterious line or an aerial close-up of the Pi, please contactme croppie2@yahoo.com, or cropcircleconnector.com, orearthfiles@earthfiles.com! I would also like to hear reports of other unusualfeatures or experiences.]The formation may not quite qualify as a Grand Finale, but it is a fascinatingfinale - for the year, AND the Millennium.\" End of e-mail."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"One of the eight circles surrounding large central circle with wheatlaid down in clockwise concentric pattern around tuft of standing crop.Photograph © 1999 by Peter Sorensen, Avebury, Wiltshire, England, September 2, 1999.We b s it e s :http://cropcircleconnector.com/Sorensen/PeterSorensen99.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
