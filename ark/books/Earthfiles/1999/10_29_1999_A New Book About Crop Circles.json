She is alsocurrently coordinating research into effects of electromagnetic fields on livingmatter.In her new book, Crop Circles, The Greatest Mystery of Modern Times © LucyPringle 1999, she gives an historic context for crop circles in England that longprecede the 1990s. Like other authors over the years, she includes an illustrationof a 1687 woodcut which depicts the now-famous \"Mowing Devil\" making aflattened circle in a field of oats.Mrs. Pringle also quotes from several British eyewitnesses who rememberplaying in circles in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s:\"One Sussex woman remembers playing in corn (cereal crop)formations during the war and told Mrs. Pringle, \"I can rememberthem with absolute clarity 50 years ago when I was a small child andmy friends and I spent hours playing in them. There were two fieldsin particular where they occurred regularly over three or four years.There were two or three circles in the fields and they were all swirledround flat and had well-defined edges. There was an interconnectingpathway between the circles which was not straight but curved. Itwas only one or two inches wide with the stems splayed sideways.\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Lucy Pringle writes about the physical and emotional effects of crop circles onhumans and animals. Those effects include a pressure or tingling on neck,shoulders and head that many people have reported over the years. Some peoplehave reported healings of arthritis and other health problems while otherscomplain about headaches, nausea, dizziness and emotional reactions of fearand/or anger. Many feel uplifted and joyous.Occasionally dogs have refused to go in some formations, porcupines have beenfound dead in the centers of some in Canada, and Mrs. Pringle reports that inthe summer of 1993, the remains of feathers and bird tissue were found\"exploded\" in a crop formation near Wanborough.\"We entered the ringed formation and there were the remains...numerous small feathers strewn over a radius of 13 to 14 feet fromthe centre of the circle. From the way the blood and feathers werepresent in every layer of the crop, right down to the ground, it wasapparent hat the birds had been caught up in the actual creation ofthe formation, blown apart and disintegrated by the force.\"What sort of force can explode a bird? Some form of microwaveactivity must be present and this could be responsible, and indeed thecharring effect evidenced by the porcupine in (one) report would gosome way to confirming this.\"This idea of electromagnetic/microwave energy can also help explainthe strange effects crop circles have on mechanical equipment.\"Lucy Pringle asks, \"How long will the shapes continue to adorn our fields? Havethey got a message for us, or is it romantic, fanciful thinking? ...For the fullanswer, I believe we may have to look to areas of wider consciousness that canbypass normal thought. Einstein tells us, 'There comes a time when the mindreaches a higher plane of knowledge, but can never prove how it got there.' Ibelieve we cannot dismiss the possibility of some external intelligence beinginvolved in this phenomenon.\"More Information:Lucy Pringle's new book has 135 pages plus Bibliography and Index with blackand white and color photographs throughout.
