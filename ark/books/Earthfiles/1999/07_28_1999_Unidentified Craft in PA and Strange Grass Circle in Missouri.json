Penny is a 47-year-oldregistered nurse who has lived in the region for several years. Outside thewindow, she suddenly saw an \"illuminated derby-shaped object that glowed thecolor of silver metal.\" She thought it was as big as half her fist at an arm's lengthdistance as it moved above the trees west to east slowly and steadily.Penny opened the window, but could not hear sound. As the object moved overher house, she could see what looked like \"a crystal chandelier or giantdiamond\" giving off a sparkling light from the center of the craft's underside. Sheestimated the diamond was about one-third the size of the entire vehicle. Therewere no other lights, but she could see a thin, white line extending from theback of the object that reminded her of a laser beam. She watched for over aminute until it went out of sight.If anyone else in the Huntingdon Valley area saw this unusual craft, too, I wouldappreciate an e-mail to earthfiles@earthfiles.com. Or FAX me at215-491-9842.July 20, 1999 Missouri More lights have been videotaped in Missouri where physical traceinvestigator, Ted Phillips, has been monitoring a rural farm area. SinceDecember 1998, white globes of light and gold ovals that expand and contractlike a camera lens have been reported by more than thirty residents.Last week on July 20, 1999, a bright light showed up around 11:30 PM andhovered over an old barn about 150 feet from the farm house. That caused allthe farm dogs to bark frantically. The farmer said it was much larger than the fullmoon. He watched it for several minutes as it moved upward, stopped, movedback down to its original position and remained stationary.The next day, a cow gave birth to a dead and grossly deformed calf not far fromthe barn. The farmer wanted to move the cow from where she gave birth througha narrow fenced corridor filled with 40-inch high fescue pasture grass. There, hefound a 9-foot diameter circle pressed down in the deep grass shown in thephotograph below. This is the first circle in the Missouri pasture since the lightsbegan appearing eight months ago."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Photograph: Circle in fescue grass after July 20th appearance of large,white light over farmer's nearby barn in Missouri.

It's quite a striking thing with that fescuearound it. Immediately I thought of a case in Langenburg, Saskatchewan, 1974,where five objects were seen and leaving five rings almost identical to thisthing.\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
