That poison is PCBs, poly chlorinated biphenyls, onceused everywhere for cooling and insulating electrical transformers and coloringnewspaper comics. PCBs were even sprayed on country roads to keep dustdown. Dr. Rob Macdonald, an oceanographer for the Canadian Institute ofOcean Sciences in Sidney, British Columbia, says \"the PCB paintbrush hascovered the globe.\" Marine scientists are concerned that the oceans are sopolluted with the dangerous chemicals.In an up-coming Marine Pollution Bulletin, Canadian scientists describe howorcas now rank as the most contaminated cetacean in the world, partly becausethey eat other marine life whose fatty tissues are filled with PCBs. High PCBconcentrations damage immune systems. The Committee on the Status ofEndangered Wildlife in Canada this April listed the northern Pacific Ocean'sresident orcas as threatened. The population has dropped more than ten percentin the past three years.PCBs are among sixteen organic pollutants that European countries in theUnited Nations Economic Commission for Europe have finally agreed to ban.Further, the United Nation's Environment Program is working on a proposal fora worldwide ban of several organic pollutants, including PCBs."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Gray Whales ThreatenedGray Whales are also threatened by a proposal of the Mitsubishi Corporation ofJapan and the Mexican government to transform 116 square miles of Baja,California's San Ignacio's shoreline into a massive salt factory. San Ignacio is thelast lagoon on earth where the Gray Whales can breed and give birth in peace.The industrial goal is to build large evaporation ponds to produce salt thatwould be delivered to ocean tankers docked along a mile-long pier constructeddirectly across the path of the Gray Whales. The Natural Resources DefenseCouncil and other environmental groups are trying to focus worldwide attentionon this new threat to Gray Whales.Nuclear Plant Safety in the Face of Y2K On Friday, the Senate Special Committee on the Y2K Technology Problemsreleased a letter sent to the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commissionwhich in part states: \"With only seven weeks until the Y2K rollover, the nuclearindustry has yet to satisfy the Senate's, the GAO's and the public's fundamentalconcerns regarding potential devastating mishaps which could even lead tomultiple meltdowns after New Year's.\"The letter asked for a description of the process by which NRC will make a finaldetermination as to which nuclear plants, if any, will be shut down over safetyconcerns during the year 2000 rollover. The deadline for response was Monday,November 15th and nuclear industry watchdogs report the NRC response isinadequate.Crop Formation \"Humming\" SoundThere is news from Canada about crop formations and more unusual cat killings.Paul Anderson, Director of Circle Phenomena in Canada, Investigator PatrickCross reports that in this new formation, he and others could hear an unusual\"humming\" sound. They tried three compasses and an electromagnetic frequencymonitor. All the instruments responded oddly at the same time and their variouscameras failed to operate inside the formation. And a white substance likecobwebs was found beneath some of the corn stalks. Local Royal CanadianMounted Police gathered samples for lab analyses.More Cat Mutilations In CanadaAlso in Canada, two more Humane Societies are trying to cope with unusual catmutilations beyond Toronto. The Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario Animal Shelter hasreceived half a dozen reports in the past few weeks and so has the SaskatoonSPCA in Saskatchewan. It's more half cats and mutilated cats similar to what'sbeen happening in Toronto; San Jose, California; Ft. Worth, Texas; and London,England.The first report in Sault St. Marie was a cat found \"cut in half,\" said Cindy Ross,Manager of the Humane Society's Animal Shelter, (705) 949-3573. \"There wasno blood, no fur, nothing around it. It looked very deliberately placed. It lookedlike a very sharp knife was used. I am just baffled. This is the first in myexperience. You get calls all the time of cats hit by a car. But this is somethingelse.\" The city police have been notified and a $500 reward offered forinformation. A $60,000 reward has also been offered by the Ontario Society forthe Prevention of Cruelty to Animals for information about ten mutilated cats inthe Toronto area. Anyone with information is asked to call Inspector DebbieHunt at the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) at(416) 410-4836."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"In the larger environment of the cosmos, at the beginning of November 1999 atthe University of California in Santa Cruz, astronomers detected a wobble in astar about 153 light years from earth in the constellation Pegasus. The scientistspredicted the wobble was caused by a large planet that would cross between thestar and earth on November 7th. As predicted, the star's brightness droppednearly two percent for a period of time. The conclusion is that this was the firstdirect evidence of a planet outside our solar system. Based on the dimming, theastronomers calculate that the orbiting planet is gaseous and larger than Jupiterand is so close to the star that its surface is too hot for life.We b s it e s :http://www.nrdc.org/http://y2k.senate.gov/news/pr991116.htmhttp://schwab.tsuniv.edu/t8/hd209458/transit.htmlhttp://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/cbat.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
