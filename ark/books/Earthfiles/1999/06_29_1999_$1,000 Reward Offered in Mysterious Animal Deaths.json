The five animals all had holes puncturedin their uterus. The goat also had both eyes removed. Owner Tom Issler says itstarted back in October 1997 and the most recent attack was Saturday, June12th. He asked veterinarian Louis Levan, D.V.M., to examine the first cow.Interview:Tom Issler, Farmer, Richwood, Ohio: \"Then he came up and he palpated herand that's when he could feel the tears inside of her when he had his arm in her.And then at that time, he told me that he didn't really understand how thatcould happen, but he said there are a couple of different possibilities. One, shecould have backed into something, but that's pretty remote because - I mean, toback into something and ram it clear down inside of her that far was not reallypossible. And he said, the other really remote possibility might be that she had avery strong, active calf with hooves that might not be as soft as normal and it'spossible the calf could punch, push a hoof through the uterus - although it'snever happened in my life time. But he said, it was a remote possibility.Then he said the other possibility is somebody is doing this. But at that time, inOctober of 1997, we just didn't think there was any much possibility of that.HOW WOULD YOU GET THREE PUNCTURES IN A UTERUS TOBEGIN WITH FROM THE OUTSIDE?Yeah, well, what he meant was that somebody was putting something downinside of her some object and punching a hole in her. But we couldn'tunderstand why someone would want to do that.And then of course, the next instance happened with a bred heifer. That heiferdied within two days. So, then he came up and did a necropsy on her - heopened her up after she died. And then he could see exactly what it was andthere were holes punched in her uterus. And the uterine fluid was draining intothe body cavity and the animal was going into peritonitis because she was beingpoisoned from the uterine fluid.COULD HE DETERMINE ANYTHING ABOUT THE PUNCTURES INTHE UTERUS, ABOUT HOW THEY HAD BEEN MADE?Well, the only thing he could really tell was that it was some object sharpenough to jam through there. So, we kind of assumed it was something metal,something sharp enough that they could put it down - well, at her vulva and runit down her uterine track into her uterus and sharp enough to shove it throughthe uterine wall.THEN FOUR MONTHS LATER IN APRIL 1998 WAS THE THIRDCOW?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Yes, that was also a bred heifer. My daughter and I were showing cattle down atColumbus at the Spring Dairy Expo and I had another fella' taking care of theoperation here. And when he went up to that barn to feed and take care of theanimals that were in this barn in question, he found a bred heifer down andenormous amount of blood coming out of here vulva in the rear. And so, hecalled the veterinarian and Dr. Levan said, \"It's the same thing.\"And then Dr. Levan and I talked and he said he thought it was imperative that Imove all the animals out of the barn right away. And so, I did. I came home fromthe show, in other words, and moved all the animals out of the barn over to themain farm, except this old pet goat of my daughter's that I couldn't catch. Shehad a dog collar on, but I couldn't catch her. And I didn't really have anyone tohelp me, so I left her up there.Then whoever the individuals are apparently returned in about two days andwhen I was driving past the barn, I looked and the goat was lying out in thedriveway. And the same thing had been done to the goat. In addition, they tookher eyes out.PUNCTURES IN THE UTERUS AGAIN AND EYES OUT?Ye a h .THAT WAS IN APRIL OF 1998. AND NOW WE ARE AT JUNE (1999) ...14 months later. I had ten bred heifers up there, all together with a bull and oneof them was down. And when I looked in there, I guess the first thing I thoughtwas that she had aborted her calf because there was part of the placentalmaterial was laying on the floor in there. So, that's the first thing I thought, butwhen I crawled in there and the way she looked, then it kind of hit me thatthey're back!HOW IN THE WORLD IS ANYBODY DOING THIS, MAKINGPUNCTURE MARKS IN THE UTERUS OF AN ANIMAL?Well, as you can well imagine, the animal is not going to stand still for anythinglike this. So, my neighbor may have hit it the other day. He said, \"Well, maybethey are tranquilizing them.\" And that may be. If we had thought of this earlier, Iguess we could have run a blood test on one of the animals to determine if infact they had been tranquilized.WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT TO PUNCTURE THE UTERUS ANDTAKE OUT HOLES OF TISSUE IN THE FIRST PLACE?We have no idea. That's what's so puzzling. Normally, if someone would be justmad at you for some reason and they want to do you in or do you some harm,this isn't the kind of thing they usually do. They might shoot them. They mightpoison them. They might do something like that. But they're not going to gothrough a whole involved thing like this just to get at you or make you mad. It'stoo involved!\"More Information:Tom Issler has offered a $1,000 reward for information that can lead to aconviction ofthese crimes against his animals and would like people who know anything tocall him at(740) 494-2790 in Richwood, Ohio.See list in Earthfiles Shop of my books and documentaries about the globalanimal mutilation phenomenon that has been ongoing since at least the 1950s.Credits"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
