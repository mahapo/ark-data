The wheat field is atthe ancient sacred site of Avebury and the formation is more than 300 feet indiameter, as big as a football field. I walked all though it. The wheat was laiddown in extremely complicated interior lays. On the ground, it is nearlyimpossible to know what the whole pattern is. But from the air, it is a largetriangle of thirty-three standing circles bi-sected and tri-sected by lines thatmany people see projecting outward into six 3-dimensional cubes. That is one ofthe themes this summer of 1999 patterns in crops that are forcing 3-dimensionalperspectives.Aerial Photograph © 1999 by Peter Sorensen.The July 29th evening that the huge formation appeared at Avebury, an Englishcouple was sitting in a formation across the road from Silbury Hill, the biggestmanmade mound in Europe. Charles and Frances Mallett of Horton, Wiltshirenear Devizes were on a night watch inside another extraordinary formation thatwas discovered July 24th. That one was shaped like a diamond or steppedpyramid surrounded by 112 circles arranged in sixteen groups of seven.As Frances and Charles watched the sky near Silbury on Thursday night, theywere surprised to see orange moving lights suddenly appear and move in arcingmotions over the fields in front of them throughout the next three hours. Thecouple assumed that the orange lights were producing a large crop formation.When the sun came up, Charles and Frances searched but could not see a newformation. Disappointed, they left their all night watch site only to learn laterthat day that not more than a quarter mile behind them, the huge andcomplicated triangle/cube formation had been discovered in the Avebury field.The next morning on Saturday, July 31st, two new formations appeared. Onewas a 6-petal flower, also near Silbury Hill."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Aerial Photograph © 1999 by Colin Andrews.The second was at Roundway, about 250 feet wide consisting of seven \"petalsseparated by seven circles. The wheat looked as if water had rushed through thepattern laying the plants down in fluid s-shaped and circular flows thatculminated at the center in a 3-dimensional ring about six feet in diameter and atleast eight inches in height.Aerial Photograph © 1999 by Peter Sorensen.Alan March of Harlow, Essex, U. K., discovered it at 6 AM. He told me that theday before he kept saying to his friend, Jonathan Williams, that he 'felt like aformation would come down at Roundway.' But, Jonathan wanted to watch atAve b u r y .In fact, both men had been in Avebury together until Alan felt overcome with adesire to go on alone to Roundway. When he got there, a thin mist was risingfrom the huge, new pattern. Alan was so excited that he started running downthe tram line to get into the formation. But when he reached the outsideboundary of one of its large circles, he heard a loud crackling noise like staticelectricity. It seemed to be coming from the wheat itself, even though at the farback edge of the formation there were power lines strung on transmissiontowers. The crackling sound unnerved Alan and he decided to go back to his carand drive to Avebury to get John.The two returned and hurried down the tram line to the edge of the Roundwayformation. Again, the crackling electrostatic sound stopped both men. Theywaited another half-hour for the sound to die down before they stepped onto thewheat. During their wait, a deer ran into the formation and back out again. Asthey finally stepped into the crop pattern, both continued to hear theelectrostatic noise 'like Rice Krispies snapping and popping all around us. In thedampness of the early morning, neither could find any signs of footprints ortracks.' The wheat seemed to be alive with that popping energy, John said, 'andwe figured it must have been made just before Alan got there at 6 AM.'Similarly in the United States at Brentwood, Tennessee in May and Hoeven,Holland in |June, other eyewitnesses described loud electrostatic crackling andpopping sounds inside geometric and circular formations. In the Hollandexperiences, a 19-year-old teenager watched a strange pink-purple light appearover a field near his house around midnight, transform into a 30-foot-diameterglowing disc, disappear and leave behind 30-foot and 2-foot diameter circles.What are the mysterious lights and their connection to crop formations? Charles"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Mallett recently on May 10th had his own close-up encounter with one of thelight spheres. He was alone on a night watch inside a complicated flowering rapeseed formation at Milk Hill near Alton Barnes.'Rape seed grows thick like a jungle. You can,t move through it without breakingthe celery-crisp stalks that leak water all over you. And it grows tall, as tall asme. So, the only thing you can see is the sky when you, are in it. I was sitting inone of the circles when suddenly right in front of me behind rape stalks was aglowing, orange-white sphere of light about ten inches in diameter. I could notbelieve it! The rape plants were actually silhouetted by the light behind them. Ileaned over in different directions, but the light did not move. It was real andhovering there. Then after about a minute, it slowly faded out.'Above him at the belly of the White Horse in Milk Hill, Frances was alsowatching the field. She did not know that a sphere was in front of her husband.But later they compared notes and realized that at the same time, Frances sawtwo glowing spheres above the field turn off and on twice.In 1998, Charles was camped out at Adams Grave, the highest point in the area.He heard a sound above him in the sky like thunder. It repeated several times.Then, the sound began moving down toward him. As it descended, the 'thunderchanged to a rhythmic heartbeat' that surrounded Charles.'It was like some weird stereo. The beat would be on my right and move aroundto my left and back again, over and over. That beating went on for at least tenminutes making me feel like something was right there watching me react to thenoise, but I couldn't see a thing!'\"We b s it e s :http://cropcircleconnector.com/Sorensen/PeterSorensen99.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
