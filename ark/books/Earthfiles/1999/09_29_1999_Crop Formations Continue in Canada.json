She says, \"All plants were laid close to the ground. Weedstems are still horizontal at the base, but the branches are growing upwards tothe light. (But) the wheat remains horizontal.\"Looking east inside Acadia Valley, Alberta, Canada durum wheat formation discoveredSeptember 21st © 1999 by Judy Arndt.Judy also took a photograph standing at the center inside the central 30-foot-diameter circle in which all the plants were laid closely to the ground andswirled clockwise around a patch of bare ground. In contrast, the large 60-footdiameter circle has hundreds of small standing plants \"distributed evenly all overthe circle.\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Close-up at center of 30-foot-diameter central circle © 1999 by Judy Arndt. Judy reported that she found many deformed growth nodes and expulsioncavities in the flattened crop inside the Acadia Valley formation. She said,\"While we were examining nodes, we noticed that the grain in the east circle, inan area from the center towards magnetic north, had the highest number ofnodes that were severely distorted.\" Diagram: Survey highlighting in red dots where growth nodes in durum wheat plants werere-orientedand exploded outward inside the Acadia Valley, Alberta, Canada formation © 1999 by JudyArndt. In Judy's photograph below, six re-oriented growth nodes clearly show holeswhere cell water exploded outward. Biophysicist W. C. Levengood hypothesizesthat the formations are created by a spinning plasma vortex that containsmicrowave and electronic frequencies. The microwaves, he postulates, heat upthe cell water in the growth nodes enough to burst outward creating the holes,but the energy is not sustained long enough to cook the plants.

More Information:Judy and her husband, Mike Arndt, collected soil and grain samples from theAcadia Valley circles and corridors to send to the BLT Research Team foranalyses by biophysicist, W. C. Levengood. To date, he has discovered a patternof similar metabolic changes in the mitochondria of affected plant cells fromformation to formation and country to country that are not found in normalcontrol plants or plants sampled in known hoaxes.We b s it e s :1) Judy Arndt's Web Site:http://www.treasurehouseimports.com/cropcircles/acadiavalley99/acadia.html2) Paul Anderson, Director, Canadian Crop Circle Research Network (CCCRN)http://www.geocities.com/cropcirclecanada3) Largest Crop Circle Archive: http://www.cropcircleconnector.comCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
