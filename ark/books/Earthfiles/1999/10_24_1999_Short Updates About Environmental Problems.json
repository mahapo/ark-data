Powderedmilk received at their school was prepared in a pot used earlier to mixinsecticide. In Apopka, Florida near Orlando, hordes of mice turned up for reasonsunknown and residents laid out poisons and traps. Now eagles and hawks andother birds of prey are turning up sick from eating the mice.After 27,000 birds mostly male red-winged blackbirds were deliberatelypoisoned on the Harvey and Marilyn Culli farm in Mascoutah, Illinois theweekend of October 16th, some residents have reported seeing other sickanimals since. And people want to know when there will be an arrest for thefederal crime of using poisoned grain to bait and kill the birds? Gulls continue to die with internal hemorrhaging at the Presque Isle State Parkin Erie, Pennsylvania. West Nile Fever Virus and Avian Botulism results shouldbe known by the end of October. Poisonous rodenticides used to kill rats aremore likely, according to biologist Dr. Kathryn Converse, but so far investigatorshave not found the source of the suspected poison. We s t Ni l e F e ve r Vi r u s More about West Nile Fever. Recently a crow and cuckoo bird found deadnorth of Albany, New York tested positive for the virus, according to a NewYork State Health Department press release on October 15th. And so did a deadcrow found recently in Moorestown, New Jersey, the furthest point south thatthe new virus has spread so far. Across the Delaware River in Pennsylvania,more dead crows were found last week in Chester and Montgomery Countiesaround Philadelphia and have been sent for West Nile Virus testing. Results willtake three weeks. One-Eighth World's Bird Species Face ExtinctionThis week at a meeting in Malaysia, BirdLife International reported that one ineight of the world's bird species faces extinction in the coming decades becauseof human assault on the global environment. Countries with the most birds atrisk are Brazil, Indonesia, China, Colombia, Peru, India and the Philippines.BirdLife said most birds are threatened by deforestation, burning of vegetation,commercial logging, subsistence farming, plantations, arable farming and mining.Most threatened species live in forests. But populations of country birds such asswallows and skylarks in Europe have declined by 50% in the last thirty years. Unexplained Marine Animal Deaths "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"In the oceans, marine life are having a bad time, too. In the past year alone fromthe seas around New Zealand, twenty-three giant squid have been trawled updead and no one knows why. All twenty-three were caught in commercialfishing nets at about 1200 feet depths. To put those 23 deaths into perspective,the National Institute of Water and Atmosphere says only fifty giant squid werefound dead in the previous twenty years! Giant squid grow up to nearly fifty feetlong, have a beak like a parrot and can have huge, 12-inch diameter eyes.Scientists think they live about a mile below the surface of oceans, but no onehas ever studied a living giant squid - making them one of the most illusivecreatures on earth. In the Long Island Sound waters off Connecticut and New York, at least amillion lobsters in recent weeks have died. The die-off is too widespread to beexplained by lack of oxygen in late summer polluted waters. Bodies are nowbeing studied for disease and cause of death. One lobsterman, Jay Palmer,pulled up the several hundred traps he had in the western Sound and is nowworking in construction. He told reporters at the Connecticut Post, \"I'm not ascientist, I'm a fisherman, (but) my gut feeling is that it's a chemical problem. Iknow people who've been fishing out here for fifty years and this has neverhappened before.\" Palmer also said the eggs on female lobsters are gray insteadof green and that blue crabs and spider crabs also are coming up either dead orsick. Until this mysterious tragedy, East Coast lobsters were already in trouble fromsevere overfishing. In fact, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission isexpected to impose the first coast wide limits on the number of traps lobstermencan drop in an effort to protect the rapidly diminishing population of marineanimals. There is a dead zone down in the Gulf of Mexico, an area as big as New Jerseyis dead. And it's causing a war between Midwestern farmers and fishermen in theGulf. A study released by the Clinton administration says the chief source of thedead zone is upriver on the Mississippi at the hog farms in Iowa and fields inIllinois saturated with fertilizers and pesticides. The government has proposed a20% cutback in the use of nitrogen fertilizers that end up in the Gulf from theMississippi River. Farmers want to be paid for any land they take out ofproduction. Nitrogen fertilizers make plants grow, including huge algae blooms. As algaethrives, spreads, dies and sinks to the bottom, it removes oxygen from water.Some marine animals that are agile such as shrimp and fish can get out ofoxygen-deprived water quickly. But slower animals such as snails and crabs die.This year the dead zone covered 7,728 square miles and is expected to be largernext year. Even the Gulf fishermen are asking the government to help. \"The keyis to not wait until this takes over the whole Gulf!\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
