The Shroud is a piece of linen cloth about 14 feet long that has thefront and back images of a crucified man thought by many of the medical andscientific people at the Richmond Conference to be extraordinary photographicimages of the crucified Jesus Christ.Along with the Shroud of Turin, there is another part of the Christ crucifixionhistory that has rarely been presented to western audiences. It is called the Clothof Oviedo. In Jewish tradition, at the moment of death a cloth is placed over thedeceased's face and head. It is called a sudarium, a Latin word for face cloth.One of the presenters at the Richmond Shroud conference has traced the Clothof Oviedo from John in the New Testament on to Alexandria, Egypt and severalcities in Spain: Seville, Toledo and finally by the 7th Century A. D. to Oviedo innorthern Spain. There it has long been revered as the cloth that wrapped thehead of the crucified Christ to blot up the blood and serum running from hisnose and mouth and wounds in the back of his head. In John, Chapter 20,Verses 3 through 7, it states:The Bible, John, Chapter 20, Verses 3-7: \"We ran to the tomb to see.I (John) outran Peter and got there first, and stooped and looked inand saw the linen cloth lying there, but I didn't go in. Then SimonPeter arrived and went on inside. He also noticed the cloth lyingthere, while the swath that had covered Jesus's head was rolled up ina bundle and was lying at the side.\"English scholar Mark Guscin now lives in Spain where he has studied ancienttexts about the Cloth of Oviedo in association with the Centro Espagnol deSindonologia. Mr. Guscin is convinced that the head cloth mentioned in by Johnin the New Testament is the same as the Cloth of Oviedo now kept at theCamara Santa 9th Century church in Oviedo.The blood type on the Shroud of Turin and the Cloth of Oviedo are both ABnegative. Further, when photographs of the blood on the back of the head in theShroud of Turin are overlaid with the blood on the back of the head in the Clothof Oviedo, there are identical matches of the blood clot shapes. You can see thatcomparison in the photos below:Left, blood stain pattern on the linen Shroud of Turin where the back of the head"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"would have been. Right, blood stain pattern on the Cloth of Oviedo, allegedly the smallclothplaced over Jesus Christ's face after death. The Cloth of Oviedo has been kept in achurch drawer in Oviedo, Spain for centuries.I asked Mark Guscin why a cloth that may have wrapped the head of thecrucified Jesus Christ and has a traceable history back to at least the 7th CenturyA. D. in Jerusalem has not been more acclaimed by both the Catholics and theChristians?Interview:Mark Guscin, Oviedo Shroud Researcher, Centro Espagnol deSindonologia, La Coruna, Spain: \"No one has really publicized it until wewent in there. The Cathedral authorities even today - they don't realize the fullextent of what they have. They find it strange that some people want to go inand look at this old blood stained cloth. But they aren't aware of all the resultsof our studies, not because we don't make them available, but because they don'tread it. They aren't aware in themselves of the great treasure they have in there.BUT DON'T THEY ASSOCIATE IT AS BEING THE VERY BLOOD OFJESUS CHRIST ON THIS CLOTH?It's a question I often ask myself because if they did, their attitude would surelybe different. But they don't seem to. They know it's something special. Theyknow it's awakening an interest in the world over now. And they find it strangewhen people have been over from the States to go and visit the cloth and theyhave actually asked me then without these people listening, 'Have they reallycome from the United States just to see this?'WHY WOULD ANYONE INSIDE OF THE CHURCH ANYWHERENOT BE COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY PASSIONATELY OBSESSEDWITH THESE CLOTHS?I really wish I knew, but it always seems to be the question that it's people whoare not 100% involved with the church who get passionately involved andrealize what we have. I mean, we're talking about something that was in contact,physical contact, with Jesus Christ. It is incredible! Now, why they don't realizethat and stand back and think, 'Wow, we've got this here!' is absolutely beyondme.COULD YOU PLEASE DESCRIBE THE VERY FIRST MOMENT THATYOU WENT INTO THE CHURCH AND THE CLOTH OF OVIEDOWAS HANDED TO YOU TO HANDLE AND TO EXAMINE.It was a very moving and emotional moment. I had driven over from where I livein the morning about four hours drive away. I was nervous is the word really. Iwas very much looking forward to the moment. I went into the cathedral. Therewere a lot of other people who were there that I needed to meet, but I ignoredthem and sent to Jorge - one of the other members of the team - 'Take me to it.Let me see it.' And I just stood there for ten or fifteen minutes in front of it justtrying to realize - I knew it was there, I knew what it was - but just trying torealize in myself and in my heart exactly what this is. You know, if this is sixinches away from my face - I've got the actual blood of Christ! It was anincredible moment. Something I'll never forget.DID YOU PICK THE CLOTH UP?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"No. We try to do that as little as possible. And when we do touch it, it's alwayswith rubber gloves to avoid more contamination. Although, having said that,nobody can resist the temptation - at least the first time - of either touching itwith fingers without gloves on to just get that historical contact. And I did do itas well.WHEN YOU DID, DID YOU HAVE A SENSE OF SOMETHING EVENMORE DIFFERENT BEYOND LOOKING AT IT?Not really, no. I thought I would, but I didn't. I touched it. I still knew what itwas, but it didn't make too much difference touching it physically because it wasjust a literal touching it with the tip of a finger. That's all. Nothing more.IF JESUS CHRIST WERE A REAL HUMAN BEING WHO HAS HADTHE KIND OF IMPACT ON THIS PLANET THAT HE APPEARS TOHAVE HAD FOR 2000 YEARS AND EVERYTHING SURROUNDINGTHE HISTORIES THAT ARE WRITTEN IN THE GOSPELS IS A MANWHO DIED IN A HORRIBLE, PHYSICAL PAINFUL WAY. BUT THENSEEMED TO DISAPPEAR AS HE SAID THAT HE WOULD IN AMIRACULOUS WAY CONSISTENT WITH CALLING HIMSELF THESON OF GOD. IN YOUR WORK, FROM A STRICT FORENSIC POINTOF VIEW, IS THERE ANYTHING THAT HAS AFFECTED YOU ASBEING MIRACULOUS?I always say that you can get to a certain point with forensic studies, chemicalstudies, physical studies, study of manuscripts and history - you can get to apoint where you say, 'Up to here it's fact and you can't deny this.' Some peopletry to, but they can't. But you do reach a point - I mean, I don't think the Shroudor the Oviedo Cloth prove the Resurrection. I don't think they can ever do that.Some people say they can. I really don't think they can. You reach that pointwhere from there on, it depends on your own personal faith.Some people who are convinced that the Shroud is genuine - you heard them inthe Conference - they are not professing Christians and may not even believe inthe Resurrection. But you can reach a point with the Shroud where you say,'This is science and you can't deny that.' Then there is a point where it comes todeeper spiritual things.CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO A RADIO AUDIENCE WHO HAS NEVERHEARD THIS BEFORE ABOUT THE EXPERIMENTATION THAT YOUDID CONCERNING THE VARIOUS ANGLES THAT THE BODY MUSTHAVE BEEN IN TWO DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS TO CREATE THEBLOOD, THE SCAB WOUND, AND THE FLUID SERUM THAT ISTHERE ON THE CLOTH OF OVIEDO?These studies were forensic studies done by a professional forensic doctor. Whathe did was make a model head with all the tubes to pass the liquid through themso that it would come out through the nose of the head. In other words, all thestains were reproduced in the laboratory and can be reproduced again. It's ascientific experiment that can be repeated any time, as many times as anybodycould wish.The first group of stains - in order to reproduce those, the head and body wouldhave to be in a vertical position with the head tilted 70 degrees forward and 20degrees to the right. And it would have been in that position for between 45minutes to one hour.THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE BODY WAS HANGING ON THECROSS FOR THAT PERIOD OF TIME TO HAVE PRODUCED THATANGLE THAT THE HEAD WAS FORWARD AND SLIGHTLY TO THERIGHT?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"After death. We're talking about that time after death. The body would havebeen hanging on the cross for that time once Jesus - that's who we're talkingabout really - had expired.WHAT HAPPENS IN TERMS OF THIS WRAPPING OF THE CLOTHOF OVIEDO AT THAT POINT?Well, we suppose that the original idea was to wrap it all the way around thehead. But with the head being tilted to the right, that would bring the cheek incontact with the right shoulder on top of the arm which would have impeded thecloth going all the way around. So what actually happened was when whoeverwas wrapping reached that point, they just folded the cloth back over on itselfover the face which is why on the cloth you have these symmetrical stains thatwhen you open it out again, you've got stains on each side - they are the samestains, basically.BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T GET THE CLOTH AROUND HIS ARMTHAT WAS STILL HANGING ON THE CROSS?That's exactly right, yes.SO HE'S HANGING THERE FOR MAYBE 45 MINUTES TO AN HOURWITH A CLOTH PARTIALLY WRAPPED AROUND HIS FACEABSORBING CLOTTED BLOOD FROM HIS NOSE AND MOUTH ANDBACK OF HIS HEAD?Yes, but not only clotted blood. This is a liquid that was coming out veryslowly, while the body was still hanging, through the nose and mouth which isone part blood and six parts serum or the liquid that collects in the lungs whenyou die from asphyxiation.IS THAT, IN TERMS OF FORENSIC MEDICINE, CLEARLY THEREON THE CLOTH OF OVIEDO?Yes, that is very, very clear. In itself, you can't link that 100% and say, 'Oh,yeah, you've got this liquid crucifixion.' What it does imply is that the persondied in a vertical position asphyxiated. Now, that same torture, for example, wasused by the Nazis in the Second World War, but they would just hang people bythe wrists and the person in a few minutes would be dead because you canbreathe in, but with that kind of pressure when you've got your whole bodyweight hanging, you can't breathe out again. Which is also why that the chest onthe Shroud of Turin this time - you can see it's a bit swollen. The muscles swell,the lungs swell, because you can't breathe in that position.THAT IS THE ASPHYXIATION DEATH?That's right.SOMEBODY COMES AND TAKES HIM DOWN WITH THE CLOTHSTILL PARTIALLY AROUND THE HEAD. FROM YOUREXAMINATION, WHAT APPEARS TO HAVE HAPPENED NEXT?The next thing that would have happened - and this is from the stains that wouldbe in the area that corresponds to the forehead - the body was then laid on theground with the arms in the same position. Now whether that means they werestill nailed to the horizontal bar of the cross or not, we don't know. But the armwas still in that position. And then the liquid was flowing out through the noseand down the nose up to the forehead collecting in the eyebrows which is wherethe forehead stains were - again, for about the same period of time: 45 minutesto one hour.AS IF THE BODY WERE LYING ON THE GROUND AND SO THECLOTH WOULD BE ABSORBING MORE FLUID COMING FROM"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"THE MOUTH AND NOSE AND SEEPING UP ONTO THE FOREHEAD.WHAT APPEARS TO HAVE HAPPENED NEXT?Next, the arm must have been moved down into a different position. What wasimpeding the cloth going all the way around the head, this impediment wasremoved somehow. If that was the arm, all that was involved was just turning thearm away. The cloth was then wrapped all the way around the head and tied ina knot at the top. Now, in releasing the arm from that position, what you areactually doing is releasing all the pressure on the lungs and chest muscles. So,that's when the liquid really started to spurt out through the nose, not justdribble, but it was really spurting out. That was also helped by the bodymovement. And at that moment, the body was being moved for between five toten minutes when we can presume that the body was picked up and taken fromthere to the tomb. You can actually see on the cloth, stains in the shape offingers. In other words, somebody was holding the cloth to the nose andactually pressing it to try to stop the liquid coming out and to try to absorb whatdid come out.Now, we know that it can't have been left on the head and then the Shroud putover the top of it. Why? Because there is no image on the Oviedo cloth andthere is on the Shroud. Now, whatever caused the image - whatever the imageformation was - it didn't leave anything on the Oviedo cloth and it did on theShroud. So, that means that the Oviedo cloth was not involved, was not incontact with the body when the image was formed on the Shroud of Turin. Itmust have been taken off before that and just left to one side.THE BLOOD IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD ON THE SHROUD OFTURIN AND WHAT APPEARS TO BE DORSAL BLOOD ON THECLOTH OF OVIEDO SEEM TO MATCH QUITE CLOSELY.They do. Again, this is much better described in a visual aspect, but what we cansay is that all the blood on the front stains - the ones I've just described (are) thepost mortem blood on the Oviedo cloth - but on the area that corresponds to theback of the head (it) has blood that was shed in life. And you can actuallycalculate that it was shed, it was still bleeding about an hour before death. Nowthese stains - they are exactly the same stains in the same area on the Shroud ofTurin. And when you do an overlay, then the stains just fit in perfectly. And it'sthe same blood group as well: AB.IF YOU WERE TRYING TO TRACK THE CLOTH OF OVIEDO FROMTHE CAVE UP TO 1999, WHAT IS THE KNOWN HISTORY OF THECLOTH OF OVIEDO AFTER THE TOMB?OK, according to all the documents that talk about the history, it was inJerusalem up to the year 614 A. D. which was when the Persians invadedJerusalem. Lots of Christians fled the city and they took books, manuscripts,relics, personal possessions with them. There is a document written in the year570 A. D. by some Italian pilgrims who did actually go to the cave where thesudarium was kept in Jerusalem. OK, so from there, it goes across the north ofAfrica and into Spain which was a great cultural center in the 7th Century. Itenters Spain through the port of Cartagena. It would go from there to Sevilleand from there to Toledo which was the capitol of the kingdom and then whenthe Arabs invaded Spain in the year 711 A.D. - again we have this mass exodusof Christians and all their possessions right up to the north of the peninsula.According to all these documents as well, the sudarium and the other things(relics) it was with were in the mountains around Oviedo - well, Oviedo did notactually exist as a city then - it was in the mountains between 45 to 50 years.Once the city of Oviedo was built by King Alfonso II, he built a church, SanSalvadore, especially for the sudarium and the other relics that were with it.THE ONE DOCUMENT YOU SAID WAS THE OLDEST AND THAT ITWENT BACK TO PERHAPS THE 9TH CENTURY OR 10TH CENTURYA.D. COULD YOU DESCRIBE A LITTLE MORE ABOUT HOW THAT"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"DOCUMENT WAS FOUND AND WHAT EXACTLY IT IS AND WHATIT SAYS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE SUDARIUM?It's a manuscript in northeast France. That brings us on to another relationship.For some reason, there are four manuscripts in northeast France and Belgiumwhich is all the same area which are interested in this story of the sudarium.Now, the link - there are various theories - it's all on the pilgrims road toSantiago. That's something that needs more investigation. This manuscript is theoldest one. What it does is give a list that the sudarium passed through. It's not adetailed history. And they've got those cities on it. They've got Jerusalem andfrom there to what they call Africa and what we suppose they mean by that isAlexandria in Egypt. And then into Spain and through those cities we havementioned.WHO SUPPOSEDLY WROTE THIS PARTICULAR DOCUMENT?All of these documents are anonymous. Obviously, it was somebody with a greatdeal of interest in Oviedo and its history and the relics contained, but none ofthem are autographed, none of them are signed and we have no idea who wroteany of them.HOW MANY DOCUMENTS HAVE YOU STUDIED THAT DESCRIBETHE SUDARIUM AND DESCRIBE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME ROUTEFROM JERUSALEM TO OVIEDO?There are about ten or eleven documents ranging from the 10th to the 12th and13th Centuries. I've seen all of them personally and studied them. I've hadphotographs and slides taken of all of them so they can say, 'OK, it's here. I'mnot inventing this.'BUT IF IT HAD BEEN PROTECTED SO CAREFULLY ALL OF THOSECENTURIES, THERE WERE PEOPLE AFFILIATED WITH THOSEVARIOUS CHURCHES AND ROUTES THAT ALSO SEEMED TOUNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS CONNECTED TO CHRIST. WHYWOULDN'T KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE CLOTH OF OVIEDO,ESPECIALLY IF IT TRULY WERE CHRIST'S SUDARIUM, REACHTHE WORLD PUBLIC MORE?That's a good question because people did see it. It's always been known as thesudarium of the Lord. It's never had any other name. People went to Oviedowhen they were on the Pilgrim's road to Santiago. They saw it and wrote aboutit. But it's never really caught on. I really don't know why it hasn't become betterknown because it's a very important part of the history of the church.A LOT OF PEOPLE TODAY AT THE END OF THE 20TH CENTURYWHEN THEY THINK OF BLOOD, THEY THINK OF DNA. ANDTHERE IS THIS QUESTION ABOUT BEING ABLE TO CONFIRMWHAT THE DNA OF JESUS CHRIST WAS. IS ANYBODY DOING DNATESTS ON THE BLOOD THAT'S FRAGMENTED ON THE CLOTH OFOVIEDO?It has been tried, but it is very, very difficult. It's difficult, first of all, with oldblood. Second, according to some people, you can actually leave DNA throughsweat, through saliva, so even if you did extract - on the Oviedo cloth there arehundreds of DNA chains. That's a fact. Why? Because it's been kissed, it's beentouched, it's been handled - all over the centuries. There are female DNAs inthere - it's been in the hands of nuns, they've all kissed it and left saliva on it.Your hands might be sweaty when you touch it. There are so many DNAs onthere. You would actually have to get something out of the actual blood and ifyou could get one that coincided with the Shroud, well that would be fairlydefinitive proof. But it's very, very complicated to do that.SO THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPARISON POINT IS THE FACT"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THAT THE BACK OF THE HEAD BLOOD MARKS THAT APPEAR TOHAVE BEEN FRESHLY BLEEDING FOR A PERIOD OF TIMECLOSELY MATCH THE BACK OF THE HEAD ON THE SHROUD OFTURIN?That's the most obvious visual point that's easy to show and easy to appreciate.But there's the other things like the blood group, the blood type. When I'mtalking here about postmortem blood and blood shed in life they coincidebetween the two cloths. The type of death. Everything coincides. Everythingthat we have discovered on this cloth matches with the Shroud of Turin. Andwith what we know of Christian history.\"Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
