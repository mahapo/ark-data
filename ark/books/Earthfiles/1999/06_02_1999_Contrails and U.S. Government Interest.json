In the spring of 1999, they heardnews reports about mysterious contrail throughout the United States andCanada and started paying more attention to the skies above their New Jerseyhome south of Philadelphia. Two incidents shocked Charles so much on March17th and May 23rd, that he put together a web site to share his photographs andinformation with the public. The result has been hundreds of similar contrailphotographs submitted by people from all over the country - and regular visits tohis web site by dozens of U. S. government agencies.Interview:Charles Warren, www.contrailconnection.com: \"I live very cl ose to t heairport and I see contrails and air traffic activity all the time, especially for thepast ten years. I'm an amateur astronomer. I love looking up at the sky. But I'venever seen contrails like this before. And I've never seen planes that caninstantly stop contrails from being formed and turn around and repeat the sameline in the sky. It just does not make sense.On May 23rd, approximately between 10 and 11 AM, I noticed a contrail eventover Gloucester County, New Jersey. It was a saturation of contrails beingformed from the south to the north and during the course of the event, I noticedone airplane very high in the sky had formed - I watched him form a completecircle. It looked like it appeared right above the City of Philadelphia and I keptwatching. This took place all day approximately to 5 PM and after I reviewedthe tape I noticed that there was some strange object, particularly a diamond-shaped object that appeared in two of the frames and then it was instantly goneafter the next frame.THE LENGTH OF TIMES BETWEEN THE FRAMES WOULD BEWHAT?What I do is hold the shot in the area of the sky I am videoing for approximately10 seconds. This way the video capture device I use is able to get a good snapoff it. And the diamond shape appeared on seconds two and three of a tensecond sequence I was doing.ONE SECOND APART.Exactly.WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT IN SECOND TWO AND SECONDTHREE, THE VERY BRIGHT INTENSE DIAMOND IS IN SECONDTWO AND A LITTLE DIMMER IN SECOND THREE AND THEN BYTHE NEXT FRAME YOU'VE GOT THERE, IT APPEARS TO BEGONE.Exactly. Yeah, disappeared."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"THE FRAME BEFORE FRAME 2, THERE WAS NOTHING THERE?Right.THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT JUST SUDDENLY APPEARED ANDTHEN SEEMED TO EITHER FADE OUT OR DISAPPEAR ORSOMETHING.It instantly just vanished from the frame.THIS WAS IN THE CONTEXT OF YOUR TRYING TO VIDEOTAPEWHAT APPEARED TO BE A PLANE THAT WAS DOING A CIRCULARCONTRAIL OVER PHILADELPHIA?Exactly. He was coming from the south at a high altitude and I noticed the planejust instantly turned to the right. Now, this would be right over Philadelphiacenter city. I ran back in and grabbed my video camera and when I came out, hehad about a quarter of a circle done. And I sat there and watched as the entireperfect circle was formed right over the City of Philadelphia. And it also hadthree other contrail lines running directly through the center of it.IT HAD THREE GOING THROUGH IT AND YOU CAN SEE THAT ONYOUR WEB SITE?Yes, you can clearly see that.MAY 23RD WAS THE DIAMOND-SHAPED OBJECT IN ASSOCIATIONWITH A CIRCULAR CONTRAIL. WHAT HAPPENED ON MARCH17TH?Well, March 17 was pretty unique. I had gone outside and was on my way backin and when I looked up in the sky, there was a checkerboard pattern. And thefirst thing that came to mind was William Thomas and Art Bell. I had justlistened to an archive on the web site. And I ran back in hysterically yelling formy wife. She came outside and you just can't believe what you are seeing - theseenormous patterns in the sky! And we watched these planes, three and four ingroups, come down from the south heading north. They would start the contrailsat a cloud bank, they would fly over and come to an abrupt stop. Then theplanes would turn around, go back into this cloud bank and do the same thingover again. And this went on all day long and the final result was a completecloud cover over the entire area.WHAT YOU WERE WATCHING WHEN IT BEGAN APPEARED TOLOOK LIKE A CHECKERBOARD?There is a clear picture of a checkerboard posted on my web site.THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH MARCH 17TH 1999.That's correct.IF I'VE GOT A PICTURE OF THIS CORRECTLY, THERE WERESEVERAL PLANES MAKING FIRST HORIZONTAL LINES AND THENCOMING BACK AROUND AND DOING VERTICAL LINES THROUGHTHE HORIZONTAL TO MAKE THE CHECKERBOARD?Well, the checkerboard had already been formed. There were three lines runningeast to west and three lines running north to south. And that was already formedand done with when I had gone outside. What my wife and I witnessed wasactually planes doing the north to south lines. What would happen is that thecloud - the contrail would form into a real big puffy cloud. And then the secondcontrail next to that would kind of join it to make an even bigger cloud. And as"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"this went on, there would be gaps - like if you looked at the sky you could lookthrough and see the clear blue sky through the contrail cloud. Well, you wouldalso witness another contrail airplane come through and fill the area in wherethey had missed. And that was the only part you could see them. Andeventually, it just formed an entire cloud.DID YOU THINK ABOUT CALLING AN AIRPORT TO SAY, 'WHYWOULD THESE PLANES BE MAKING THIS CHECKERBOARD OFCONTRAILS?\"A lot of things have gone through my mind at that time. I had sent severale-mails to people, to news agencies, to the FAA, to the PhiladelphiaInternational Airport tower. I never received any response back.NEVER RECEIVED ANY?Never. So, what I decided to do was to put this up on a web page and see if I getany response to it and mailed the address to William Thomas and to a few otherpeople. The word started getting out and I was just amazed at how many otherpeople were having the same experience as I was.One thing that I find funny on my web site is that I have a tracking device on myweb site. It collects all the data from visitors that come. And I have so manymilitary hits and government hits and official hits that leave me to believe thatthey are checking to see what evidence I do post.GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF SOME OF THE AGENCIES THAT HAVECHECKED IN.I've had the United States Senate, I've had NASA, Yucca Mountain, I've had theArmy, Navy, Air Force, Air Force Strategic Command Center, I've had NellisAFB, just to name a few. Everyone I'm able to catch, I post on my web site.WHAT ABOUT THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, THENATIONAL RECONNAISSANCE OFFICE, THE CENTRALINTELLIGENCE AGENCY, ANY OF THOSE?I've had the CIA, the National Security Agency I believe has been there, the FBI.I've had different research organizations (such as) Langley AFB, contractors forthe government that are involved with either airplanes or some type of strategicarms, Boeing has been on my site several times. An enormous amount of reallystrange hits on my website.THAT GRID PATTERN YOU HAVE DESCRIBED SOUNDS TO MELIKE SOMEBODY TRYING TO MEASURE KNOWN QUANTITIES ATKNOWN DISTANCES AND KNOWN LENGTHS.It does. I'll tell you another interesting thing. Every time a contrail is reported tome that is going on live, I instantly go onto the internet and try to track it downthrough a public satellite service. Every time - 100% of the time, Linda, that Ihave tried to track an event going on now - that particular time is blacked out.Every time. I've been through hundreds of them. And I've only been able to findtwo photographs that show actual contrail events. All the rest are blocked out.They list satellite times in the archives every 15 minutes. If I go into check, forexample, May 1st, 9 AM to 3 PM, 9 AM to 3 PM will be completely blackedout and not accessible. Every date I've checked, and I've checked hundreds ofthem.ALMOST AS IF SOMEONE IS ANTICIPATING THAT PEOPLEFOLLOWING THE CONTRAIL MYSTERY WOULD BE TRYING TOGET SATELLITE PHOTOGRAPHS AS WELL."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Well, they know they are because I post them on my web site, the two I've beenable to catch. And it's just - I find it very fascinating that they are able to go inthere and black out the exact dates for exact contrail events over the entireUnited States. And I have people all over the country who try to help me trackthese and none of them have been able to produce a picture. They show up onsatellites. That's what I believe the X's are for. I believe they are spraying an Xacross a large population in the air and they are able to pinpoint the exactlocation by using satellites and mark it. Seeing it for myself, really opened myeyes.\"More Information:On May 30, 1999, I reported an interview on Earthfiles and Dreamland radiowith Dr. James Baker at the University of Michigan about his discovery that anoily water substance can penetrate bacteria and viruses such as anthrax andsmall pox and destroy them. Dr. Baker plans to work with the U. S. Army inSeptember 1999 to try different dispersal methods, including dropping the oilysubstance from the air.Eyewitnesses have wondered if the oily rainbow spectra seen in contrails sinceat least February might be related to Dr. Baker's discovery and subsequent secretgovernment releases of the harmless material to see how much can reach theground if sprayed from the air? So far, I have no definite answer, but willcontinue to research and welcome information on or off the record fromEarthfiles and radio listeners. Two more x-shaped contrail photos dated May 14,1999 at 3:30 PM EST arrived recently from another New Jersey eyewitness, EdDavieau of Vernon in Sussex County near the New York State border. A bright,round object with a pale corona around it stands out in the sky near theX-shaped contrails."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Mr. Davieau, who took the photographs, wrote: \"There were six large jet aircraftin formation, one behind the other, but offset from one another and quite high. Icould see the white 'whatever' coming from the fuselage near where the wingsconnect. As they passed overhead, three more planes cris-crossed the whitetrails. Then they all made an abrupt turn and headed west toward Pennsylvania.At the time I took the pictures, I did not see the bright circular objects, nor did Isee them while watching the jets continue on.\" We b s it e s :www.contrailconnection.comCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
