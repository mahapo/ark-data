He first posted his owncontrail photographs on March 17th. Within a short time, he realized thatseveral government agencies and members of congress were visiting his contrailweb site. Viewers included the CIA, Wright-Patterson AFB, National SecurityAgency , NASA Langley Research Center and many others.After the radio program, I received the following e-mail from cable TVadvertising executive, Rick Coimbra in Medford, Oregon. He is also a member ofthe U. S. Navy League and researches unusual phenomena on his own time. Thise-mail exchange is reported here with both Rick's and the NASA scientist,Patrick Minnis's permission: Contrail Update by Rick Coimbra in E-Mail ExchangeSubject: Re: chemtrails?Date: Sat, 12 Jun 1999 10:13:57 -0400From: Patrick MinnisTo : R ic kDear Rick:I am a researcher involved with the NASA Subsonic Assessment (SASS) Projectthat is part of the NASA Atmospheric Effects of Aircraft Program (AEAP). Oneof the goals of the SASS research is to determine if the formation of contrailshas affected climate or will affect climate in the future through increased cirruscloudiness or other impacts on the hydrological cycle. Air traffic is expected toincrease by a factor of 3 to 5 times over the next 50 years. My group has beenexamining this climate question using satellite, aircraft, and surface observations.We flew an aircraft experiment during 1996 called the Subsonic Contrails andCloud effects Special Study, or SUCCESS. We produced contrails, flew behindaircraft, and analyzed contrails and exhaust to determine what is in them andhow they affect clouds. The SUCCESS experiment is one focus of the\"chemtrail\" suspicions.I was recently made aware of the \"chemtrail\" controversy by a reporter who wasconcerned about this \"chemtrail movement\" on the internet and wanted to knowif there is anything to it. I am certainly not aware of any effort of thegovernment, through any agency, to \"spray\" chemicals on the public. I find thenotion ludicrous given the fact that spraying any chemical with intent to poisonrequires an extremely low-level flight with relatively undisturbed conditions inthe air layer directly above the surface. Any attempt to distribute a chemical--unless it is in a bomb that explodes at the surface or at very low altitude--athigher levels will result in rapid dispersal, dilution, and advection downwind.The result, perhaps, would be the death of a few nearby high-flying birds. Thisfact was brought home to me recently as I watched a plane from our local Air"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Force Base spraying pesticide over one of our local swampy communities nearsunset. The plane had to fly at treetop level to even have a chance of affectingthe mosquito population. Think about how fast tear gas disperses even when it isreleased at the surface. Even chemicals released at 5,000 ft would have verylittle chance of affecting their targets at the surface.Do skywriters' smoke plumes drift onto their viewers? Dispersal of chemicalsfrom aircraft at low levels would indiscriminately affect everyone who breathesthe air containing the chamicals. Thus, very few people would escape theeffects, including any conspirators. If only very low concentrations are neededto effect the poisonoing then we should all be poisoned because the air is verygood dispersal medium. Consider the smokestack from your local factory orpower plant. They produce lots of toxic chemicals at heights of several hundredfeet. But you don't have to be very far from them to escape the effects of thechemical. The air dilutes the chemicals very rapidly in most conditions.Knowing the altitude of a plane is also a very difficult task. Even trainedobservers have difficulty determining how high a plane flies unless it actuallyflies at treetop level. Given these tidbits of physics and the vagaries of viewingperspective, it is quite unlikely that such a thing as \"chemtrails\" exists.Contrails are quite prevalent and some of the chemtrail websites have producedsome fantastic photographs that we hope to use as ground truth for some of oursatellite studies for contrail identification. What these people are reporting,except for the \"sickness and poisoning,\" are all phenomena associated with theinteraction of the atmosphere and aircraft exhaust and airframe. Contrails lookdifferent from one plane to another because of the engine and airframedifferences. Contrails will look different from different angles and may even takeon the appearance of color near the aircraft, where they are thin and the particlesizes are extremely small causing preferential scattering of particularwavelengths.Contrails will differ even for a given plane depending on the environmentalconditions (temperature, humidity, wind, wind shear, etc.), aircraft enginecondition (well tuned, old, dirty, etc.) and the aircraft mode (climbing, cruising,descending, etc.) and direction of travel. These factors also affect how far fromthe plane the contrail begins to form. Sometimes it will form near the engineoutlet, other times further back near the tail or even slightly behind the airplane.In such instances, it is possible that the contrail will appear to emanate from thetail. If the air is very dry or warm ( -35C), the contrail will not form. If it issomewhat moist, a short-lived contrail may form.If it is very mosit, you will get a persistent contrail, and if extremely moist, aspreading contrail (wind shear helps the spreading process). The water vaporconcentrations in the upper atmosphere are often very patchy both vertically andhorizontally. High concentrations required for persistent contrails often occur inrelatively thin layers so that a plane flying at an altitude slightly above or belowanother may form a contrail while the other does not. Commerical planesnormally fly at various altitudes above 25,000 ft, so they are frequently in aircold enough to form contrails, but the moisture is required. As they fly indifferent directions to various destinations, they may leave contrails that willappear to form an X or Y or H, etc. Anyway, all of the reports, unless theyconcern planes at or near treetop level, are consistent with the contrails formedby commercial or military aircraft going about their usual duties. I do not believeanything sinister is occurring.Why are people suddenly concerned about contrails? I don't know. We hadsome press on our research in 1997 and that may have been misconstrued bysome people, causing the development of a new conspiracy theory. Who knowswhat sort of misinterpretation occurs when a story is reported to a somewhatskeptical public? I do know that I never really appreciated how often contrailsoccur or how much sky they consume until I started researching them. However,if they have any effect on our population, it is through the climate or thereduction in the amount of cheery blue sky that we have available to us on agiven day."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I will gladly provide you with copies of any of our research papers on thesubject.Sincerely, Patrick Minnis>Mr. Minnis, I understand you have had interest in the>Chemtrails or contrails story.
