Even if only one out of a trillion ofthose galaxies had life, you'd still be talkingabout 10 billion places where life exists.\"- Steve Vogt, Ph.D., Astronomer,Univ. of California at Santa Cruz - Star HD195019 is located in the constellation Delphinus. The large gaseous planetthat orbits the star once every 18.3 days is estimated to have a mass equal to 3.5 Jupitersand is referred to as HD195019b. The planet is about .14 Astronomical Units from the star.One A. U. equals the mean distance from the Earth to the Sun, 93 million miles.Artwork © 1999 by Lynette Cook, used with artist's permission.http://www.spaceart.org/lcook/extraso2.htmlDecember 1, 1999 Santa Cruz, California Since 1995, astronomers have hadinstrumentation and calculations precise enough to measure wobbles in distantstars that might indicate the presence of orbiting planets. Several astronomersnow call themselves \"planet hunters.\" In the past five years, twenty-nine planetsbeyond our solar system have been discovered. Six of those were announced onMonday, November 29th by a team that will have their research published in theAstrophysical Journal. The planet hunters include Geoffrey Marcy of theUniversity of California, Berkeley; Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution inWashigton, D. C.; Kevin Apps of the University of Sussex in England; andSteven Vogt of the University of California at Santa Cruz. This week I talkedwith Dr. Vogt about the new planets and why more and more are beingdiscovered now.Interview:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Steve Vogt, Ph.D., Astronomer and Planet Hunter, University of Californiaat Santa Cruz: \"We've been involved using the Keck Telescope out in Hawaii -the world's largest telescope - for the last three years in a very dedicated andfocused search for planets around all of the brighter nearby stars. And we'vebeen monitoring a group of some 530 stars looking for planets and have nowgotten to the point where six of them show obvious orbits and we've justreleased these to the public.THE SIX ARE STARS THAT WE MIGHT KNOW BY NAME?No, none of these stars are known by name. These are stars that are fainter thanyou can see with your naked eye in general. In fact, most of the stars that wefind planets around are not visible to the naked eye. A few of them are, but mostof them are not.WHY IS THAT?Basically it's because most of the brightest stars we see in the sky are much toohot to be amenable to showing planetary signatures. They are very bright, hotstars. We are mostly interested in stars that are like our sun, or cooler. And thosekinds of stars at the average distance of nearby stars are just too faint to be seenwith the naked eye.I UNDERSTAND THAT EPSILON ERIDANI AND TAU CETI AND ZETARETICULI 1 AND 2 AND OTHERS IN OUR ARM OF THE GALAXYARE IN THE SAME SEQUENCE AS OUR YELLOW SUN ANDRANGING OUT TO MAYBE 50 LIGHT YEARS FROM HERE. HAVEYOU BEEN STUDYING ANY OF THOSE SUNS?We certainly have stars like that on the list. And we are monitoring many ofthose. And we are also monitoring stars that are closer than that. Some of thestars you mentioned are very active. They are young and have activephotospheres, so they are very difficult to see planets around because they havenoisy surfaces basically. We avoid those young stars and try to concentrate onold, slowly rotating stars.WHAT WOULD BE THE DISTANCES FROM THE EARTH?Well, this particular crop of planets varies from - the closest is about 60 lightyears from earth and the farthest away is about 190 light years. And we havedetected planets around even closer stars. The record actually is a star calledGleise 873 that is at fifteen light years - that's the nearest planet we've found.But these (new) guys are a little bit further out.Planet HD187123b is one of the \"hot Jupiters,\" described as extrasolar planetswhich orbit very close to their suns. It is believed that such planets are blue in color.With an orbit of only 3.097 days, this large gaseous planet has half of a Jupiter mass.Artwork © 1999 by Lynette Cook, used with artist's permission.YOU HAVE DETECTED THESE VISUALLY OR ONLY BY THE TUGSAND PULLS AROUND THE STAR?In general, when we detect planets we detect them simply by the tugs and pullsthey make on their parent star. But there is one case two weeks ago when wemade an announcement that one of these planets we had detected by the tugging"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"and pulling indirect method actually transited the disc of the star and eclipsed it.And when that happened, the planet sent a shadow across the earth. It tookabout two hours to transit the disk of the star and that was kind of a directconfirmation of that particular planet and allowed us to measure its diameterand density directly.YOU SAID IT SENT A SHADOW ACROSS THE EARTH?Ye s .OUR EARTH?Absolutely. Most planets are in orbits that are inclined randomly with respect toour line of sight. It could be tipped at any angle. And in a very few number ofcases, the orbit is exactly edge on. And when the orbit is exactly edge on, we arein the plane of the orbit. Then as the planet comes around in front of the star,between the star and us, it crosses right across the disc of the star. When thathappens, it actually throws a shadow out through space - an infinitely longshadow that sweeps across the earth. And that shadow is actually a dimming ofthe light of the star because there is this dark planet that has crossed in front ofthe star and blocked out part of the disc of the star. And we can measure thatshadow as it comes by - how long it takes to go by - and the depth of thatshadow tells us the diameter of the planet.These shadows have moved over the earth all the time for countless millennia.But until this point, we've never been able to detect one of those shadowsbecause we have to know exactly where to look. We have to be looking atexactly the right star at exactly the right time. And it's a very small effect. It'sonly about a percent of dimming of the light of the star. So, this was the firstshadow we caught.WHAT WAS THE FIRST YEAR THAT ASTRONOMERS WERE ABLETO HAVE PRECISE ENOUGH MEASUREMENTS TO CALCULATETHE TUGS AND PULLS THAT INDICATED PLANETS GOINGAROUND DISTANT STARS?I think planets around stars like we know, the sun - that all happened in 1995.And that was the culmination of about eight years worth of dedicated researchby a team of people. And up to that point, they had found nothing. Finally, theygot to the point where the precision was high enough so they could begin to seethese tugs and pulls. And that was the beginning of the era of extra-solar planetdiscoveries.BUT WE REALLY WEREN'T THERE BEFORE 1995?No. It's been a long, hard road to develop the necessary instrumentation andprecision of analysis to be able to see these effects. They are very subtle effects.THIS SHADOW CAST THAT WE WERE ABLE TO DETECT JUST INTHE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS THIS BEING THE VERY FIRSTSHADOW THAT TRANSLATES AS BEING THE VERY FIRSTPHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF ANOTHER PLANET THAT GOESBEYOND MEASURING TUGS AND PULLS?Absolutely. Not that we ever had any doubt that tugs and pulls were planets. Imean, those of us who do this kind of work know there really is no other way toget what we call a \"Keplerian Doppler signature\" out of the star other than tohave a body orbiting it. So, the physics describes it absolutely perfectly and wewere, of course, certain enough that these planets existed. But, there are alwaysnaysayers in the community who say, 'Well, this is only indirect. You really haveno proof that it isn't something else.' And so now, the shadow pretty muchremoves any doubt from any naysayer.WILL YOU NOW BE CALCULATING ORBITS IN ORDER TO PLACEINSTRUMENT OBSERVATION AT MORE PLACES, MORE SUNS TOGET MORE HARD EVIDENCE OF THESE SHADOWS CAST?Yeah. Unfortunately, the shadow thing is a fairly rare thing. We've been in thisbusiness now for quite a number of years and there are only certain types ofplanets that are likely to throw shadows and those are the ones that are very"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"close into their star. Because if a planet gets out very far away from its star, thelikelihood that it would cross the disc of a star becomes very small. So, for all ofthose planets we've found there are about five of them now out of the 30 or sothat we know of that are real close in to their star say that have orbital periods ofthree to five days. In each of those cases, there's about a 10% chance that eachone of those might cross the disc of its star. And we have looked in each case forsuch transit and we've never found them before because their orbits weren'texactly edge on. This was the first case in which Nature was kind and threw us abone the orbit was edge on and we got a transit. But in general, only one out ofevery 1000 stars that you could survey for planets will show this kind of transitthing. So it's pretty rare.THE HEADLINES SAY, 'SIX BIG NEW PLANETS FOUND; FIVECOULD HAVE LIQUID WATER.' IF YOU ARE FINDING THEPLANETS BY SIMPLE TUGS AND PULLS, HOW DO YOU INFERTHAT THEY HAVE LIQUID WATER?That's a very good question. One of the first things we always do when we detecta planet is we work out the size of its orbit. That tells us how far away it is fromits star. And then from some very simple principles, knowing the temperature ofthe star which we can measure and knowing the radius of the star which we canmeasure and knowing the brightness of the star which we can measure puttingthat together with the size of the orbit, we can determine how much heat thatplanet is receiving from its star. And from that, we can derive the temperaturethat that planet has to be at from its heat source, the star it's going around. Andusually when we do that, we find that planets are very hot, maybe thousands ofdegrees. Or they are very cold - maybe hundreds of degrees below zero. Andusually there is not much in between because the universe is a place of extremes things are usually really hot or really cold.But if you get the planet at just the right distance from its star not too close, nottoo far away it will have a temperature that's in what is called the \"liquid waterregion\" - between zero and 100 degrees Centigrade, or if you like the Fahrenheitscale, between 32 degrees F. the freezing point of water and 212 degrees F., theboiling point of water. That's a very narrow temperature range. But it turned outthat five out of the six of these planets were in that temperature range. Now, I'mnot saying they have liquid water in their atmospheres or on their surfacesbecause they are in that temperature range. In fact, these newly discoveredplanets are like big gas balls similar to Jupiter, so they really don't have surfaces.And it's probably unlikely there is liquid water in their atmospheres. You have tohave the right combination of temperatures and densities and pressures.But it is quite likely that if they are accompanied by moons that the moonscould well have liquid water on their surfaces. If you look at our own solarsystem and you look at all the gas giant planets in our own solar system and thatincludes Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune each of these four giant gaseousplanets has dozens of moons. So, it's quite likely that these kinds of planets weare finding are also like Jupiter or Saturn and also have lots of moons. And then,if they have moons and are in a habitable zone, it's quite likely to imagine thattheir moons do have liquid water.WHY IS IT THAT THESE PLANETS DON'T HAVE SOME SOLIDITY?WHY DO YOU SAY THEY ARE ALL GASEOUS?Well, we know their masses that we can measure from our orbits. And themasses turn out to be large. They end up to be like Jupiter 300 times the mass ofthe earth. So, these are BIG planets. These are not small planets like earth andMars and Venus.COULD THEY BE AS LARGE AS JUPITER AND BE A SOLIDEARTH-LIKE PLANET?I suppose they could. I don't see any reason why a planet couldn't have an earthsize terrestrial structure and be as big as a Jupiter. I don't know of any physicsthat would stop that. I think our theories of planetary evolution do not predictthat, but it's possible that Nature has figured out a way to do that. On the other"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"hand, the one case we know of now where we got the transiting planet's shadow,we were able to work out the density of that planet and it turned out to be verysimilar to Saturn's - a little less than water. So that planet would actually float ifyou could put it in a big enough ocean. And that tells us that it's basically apuffed up gas ball and not a giant rock.SO FAR, HAS THERE BEEN ANY INDICATION IN ANY OF THEWOBBLY TUG AND PULL DATA TO SUGGEST THAT WE HAVEDISCOVERED ANY SOLID, HARD PLANETS YET?No. There is no information about that at all. Our best ideas are that each ofthese gas giants that we detect do have rocky solid cores that are a few timesbigger than the earth. But the planet itself is mostly just a big gas ball.WHY AREN'T YOU FINDING SOLID ROCKY PLANETS LIKEEARTH?The thing you have to keep in mind is that there is a bit of a selection effectgoing on here. If we were looking back at our own Solar System from 50 or 100light years using our technique, we wouldn't see Earth, we wouldn't see Venus,we wouldn't see Mercury, we wouldn't see Mars. But we would see Jupiter, wewould see Saturn, we would see Uranus and probably even Neptune. But wewouldn't see the small rocky planets. And that's because of the technique. It hassome limitations. So when we go out surveying for planets, we really are blindto all but these big gas giant planets.Artist rendering of huge gaseous planet with a mass of about four Jupiterswhich orbits the 4.5 magnitude yellow star Tau Bootes every 3.3 days.Artwork © 1999 by Lynette Cook, used with artist's permission.\"Killer\" JupitersBasically 5% of all the target stars we look at show these giant planets. Now, it'salso true that these systems that have these gas giants in them, most of these gasgiants are in very oval orbits, very elliptical orbits and they are not the kind ofsystems you would expect to find earths in. In fact, you can play the numericalgames. You can put an earth in one of these systems and see what happens to itand very quickly it gets thrown out of the system. It basically just gets tossed outby the elliptical orbit of the big Jupiter. So, they are not the kind of systems weexpect to find earths in. And that's kind of a sad thing. These are kind of like\"killer\" Jupiters in a way.More Than 10 Billion Planets in Milky Way GalaxyOn the other hand, you have to keep in mind that's only 5% of all the targetstars. That means that 95% of the target stars don't have these killer Jupiters inthem. Now whether they have earths or whether they have Jupiters like our ownwhich is in a nice, big circular orbit safely parked far away from the earth wedon't know. We don't really have any information about that part of the storyyet. It's kind of like the blind man feeling the elephant. You can feel the end ofone tusk and you're trying to figure out what the rest of the elephant looks like.We're sampling just one end of one tusk right now. And it tells us, Number One"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"there are a lot of planets out there. In fact, of the few hundred billion stars inour galaxy, it tells us that there are at least 10 billion planets in our own galaxy.Now, many of these will be killer Jupiters like the kind I've described. But thereare probably an equal number or more of systems that don't have these killerJupiters in them and so it makes me think in all this planetary work that thereare, first of all a LOT of planets out there. And secondly, there are probably alot of places where water can exist in liquid form and where life will eventuallyemerge.Solar Systems Like Ours?DO YOU THINK THAT INNER PLANETS LIKE THIS SOLAR SYSTEMOF EARTH AND MARS, VENUS AND MERCURY ARE MORE RARETHAN GASEOUS PLANETS?We don't know. We have no information about that whatsoever. We are reallyblind to seeing anything except the Jupiters. I think that one of the interestingthings is that our own solar system has four Jupiter-sized planets in pretty largeorbits out beyond five astronomical units - or five times the size of the earth'sorbit. These big gaseous planets are nested in nice co-planar circular orbits,whereas the stars we're finding planets around have Jupiters in very ellipticalorbits. So, they are different in that respect. They are not like our own solarsystem.What we would like to find are solar systems like ours that have a Jupiter likeours in a big circular orbit. That allows you to have terrestrial-like planets likethe earth down in the habitable zone where big gas planets wouldn't disturb it.And those are the real signposts I think of the kind of solar system that we'remost interested in finding earths in. And so, we're looking very hard for thosekind of solar systems.The problem is that in order to find a solar system that has a Jupiter like oursand is in a 5 Astronomical Unit orbit with a period of about 12 years, you needto look for twelve years. You can't find it any earlier than twelve years becauseyou have to see a whole orbital cycle. So, we have to be patient. We have tolook for another ten to fifteen years before we can begin to see those systemsthat have real Jupiters like ours. And when we find those systems, those willprobably be systems likely to have earths in them.WHAT REFINEMENTS WILL HELP YOU LOOK FOR SMALLER,ROCKY PLANETS?Well, there are really only two ways on the drawing board right now that couldfind earth-sized planets with any sort of meaningful data. One would be to putup a satellite in orbit that could look for this transit, or dimming, effect. It wouldbe a very small effect if an earth-sized planet crossed across the disc of its star,but you could measure it if you had accurate enough instrumentation above theearth's atmosphere. To get a reasonable probability to find such a transit, youwould have to look at an area of space that had tens of thousands of stars in it.And you'd need to look at all the stars all at once all the time, 24 hours a day,for probably three or four years. And there are missions that are designed to dothat which may be funded and may fly and they will show evidence occasionallyout of the handful of those tens of thousands of stars of places where earth-sizedplanets are transiting the discs of their stars.Terrestrial Planet Finder, TPFThe second method which is even more ambitious is something that's on thedrawing boards at NASA and is a thing called Terrestrial Planet Finder, or TPF.And this is something that will probably go up in the next 15 to 20 years a very,very ambitious mission that will fly a fleet of telescopes out in space that will bea free flying array maybe four or five individual telescopes that will all worktogether as a single unit and they will be spaced maybe a kilometer or so apart"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"and they will hold their distances in free flight formation to an accuracy lessthan the width of an atomic nucleus of an atom. These are incredible precisiondemands on such a thing. But, NASA is figuring out ways to do this. And if theycan do this, these free flying telescopes will be able to combine their light tosuch exquisite accuracy that they will be able to block out, or null out, the lightfrom the star and be able to peer in very close to the star and see the littleindividual planets directly and then analyze the light from those planets, takespectra from them and look for presence of things like water and oxygen in theirspectra that would tell us if there were life processes going on there.IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY, AN ANALOGY TODAY ON THEEARTH MIGHT BE THE VERY LARGE ARRAY OUT IN DATIL, NEWMEXICO WHERE BIG DISHES LISTEN TO SPACE?Exactly. It would be using optical light rather than radio waves, but would be asimilar array of telescopes basically that would be in free flying formation -probably in orbit about the sun, trailing the earth at one of the Lagrangianpoints, not actually orbiting the earth. And it would be combining light as aninterferometer in exactly the same way that the array of radio telescopes down inNew Mexico does it, but with much higher precision. The tolerancerequirements are picometers, which is the fraction of the size of an atomicnucleus.Space Interferometer Mission SIMThere's another mission that's going to go ahead of that which is kind of astepping stone along the way that will fly about the year 2003 called SIM, orSpace Interferometer Mission. And that's a mission whereby they will learn a lotof the technology they will need in order to carry out this much more difficultmission.YOU WERE QUOTED IN A NEWS ARTICLE AS SAYING, 'PLANETHUNTING IS A LOT LIKE MAKING WINE.' COULD YOUELABORATE ON THAT?Yeah, that was in response to a question that I've been frequently asked about 'How come we're seeing so many planets all of a sudden coming out? It lookslike the pace of planet finding has suddenly accelerated.' And my answer to thatwas that like in making wine, at first you get nothing. For the first few years, asyou plant your grapevines and you watch them mature, you really don't get anyharvest at all. And eventually when they become able to bare fruit after a fewseasons, then you have to wait until the fruit has ripened sufficiently on the vine.And once it's ripened, then you can harvest it in and make your wine. So, youdon't get any wine initially until that happens.Same with planets. We need to observe a large number of stars, hundreds ofstars for several years before we can gather enough data on many individual starsto sense the presence of these periodic wobbles which then gives us the orbit.So, we're now at that point after three years in our planet search where it'sharvest time. The grapes have matured on the vine, the data is ready, and it'stime to make the wine.HOW MANY PLANETS IN TOTAL HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED INTHIS PROCESS SO FAR?There's been a total I think of 29 extra-solar planetary discoveries now. We'vemade about 22 of them, our particular group. There are a number of othergroups also working on this. So, this latest batch of six increased the knownnumber about 25%.Other Intelligence Out There?THERE IS A FORMULA FOR CALCULATING HOW MANYINTELLIGENT CIVILIZATIONS THERE ARE IN OUR GALAXY"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"CALLED THE DRAKE EQUATION AFTER CARL SAGAN'SCOLLEAGUE AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY, FRANK DRAKE. DO YOUTHINK THE ODDS ARE IN FAVOR OF FINDING OTHERINTELLIGENCES OUTSIDE THE EARTH?I have no doubt in my mind that there is intelligent life out there. The questionof how likely it is that we will ever be able to discover such intelligent life is areally tough question to answer. The problem with the Drake equation is thereare a lot of great unknowns in many of the terms. And when you start tomultiply a bunch of unknowns together, you end up with a very uncertainanswer. And you can take two different approaches to the Drake Equation. Youcan be optimistic and see what kind of numbers you get and you get bignumbers. You get thousands or millions of systems out there. Or you can be apessimist and choose smaller numbers and you end up with none. And so, thatequation, even though it helps organize your thoughts, doesn't really lead you toa number that you can depend upon, unfortunately. One of the interesting thingsabout the Drake Equation is that it does tell you that I think the number ofintelligent civilizations that are capable of developing radio communication inour galaxy is about equal to the average lifetime of the civilization.How Many Planets?5% of the stars we look at in our galaxy do show gas giant planets. So thatmeans there are at least 10 billion planets of that kind in our galaxy... whichmeans the universe makes lots of planets.IN THIS GALAXY ALONE, THERE ARE TEN BILLION GASEOUSPLANETS?That's right. In our own galaxy, there are at least ten billion planets and that'sonly the 5% that show planets. So, that means that there are a LOT of planetsout there, many like these gaseous giants we are finding, and probably lots ofother ones that are much smaller that we can't detect. And probably lots ofearths, too. So, planetary formation is a very common thing. And that baresdirectly on things like the Drake Equation. Planets, I think, are easily made andthere's a lot of them out there.HOW MANY GALAXIES ARE THERE ESTIMATED IN THISUNIVERSE?Well, our best count used the Hubble Deep Field, which is the deepest imagewe've ever taken of the universe. It surveyed an area of the universe that is aboutthe size of a grain of sand when held at arm's length. That's the size of the areaon the sky that it's looking at. If you count how many galaxies there are in thatfield and then assume that's typical of the entire sky and multiply by the area ofthe sky, it tells you there are about a thousand billion galaxies in the universe atrillion universes. So, you can take that number of ten billion and multiply it bya trillion, if you want.THE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL PLANETS IN THIS UNIVERSE?In the universe, yes.IF ONE PERCENT OF THOSE HAD LIFE, IT WOULD STILL BE AVERY LARGE NUMBER OF PLANETS.It would be an incredibly large number of places that life could exist. If thereare an estimated 10 billion large gaseous planets in our Milky Way galaxy aloneand at least one trillion galaxies in this universe. Even if only one out of atrillion of those galaxies had life, you'd still be talking about10 billion placeswhere life exists. Whether or not we will ever be able to find it andcommunicate with it to know that it's there, that's a whole other problem. Ifthere is a civilization in a galaxy that's 10 billion light years away, it's probablygoing to be very hard to ever know that civilization exists because it would take10 billion years to send a message to it and another 10 billion to get an answer.So, we're really isolated across those kinds of distances, incredibly, so it's hardto know if such civilizations existed.UNLESS THERE ARE ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS YET TO"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"BE DISCOVERED IN WHICH PERHAPS ANOTHER INTELLIGENCEHAS ALREADY LEARNED HOW TO BEND SPACE AND TIME ANDMOVE IN SOME KIND OF POINT TO POINT SYSTEM THAT WOULDMAKE THE DISTANCES NO LONGER SO IMPORTANT.Yes. None of our present day physics allows us to do that sort of thing, but we'restill fairly young in our understanding of the universe and it may be that there isa whole new set of physics out there that would allow us to do things like travelacross infinite distances in almost no time and maybe other beings have figuredout how to do that. One can only hope that will be the case, because if we don'tfind other physics that allows us to do that sort of thing, we're going to be prettyisolated on the earth. And even if the universe is teeming with life, it would behard for us to ever contact it and to communicate with it without some kind ofnew physics.OR ANOTHER INTELLIGENCE'S DECISION TO COME HERE ANDLET US KNOW IT'S THERE.Exactly. And it may be that they are already doing that. Who knows? We thinkin terms of our known laws of physics and think they might use radio telescopesto send information across space. But maybe they have other methods. Maybethey use dreams to communicate or something like that and we don't understandhow to do that yet.\"More Information:Dr. Vogt is now working with other colleagues on a proposal for a 30 metertelescope that would have ten times the reach of the Keck telescope in Hawaii. Itwould greatly increase the ability to study the origins and evolution of theuniverse. If funding is approved - a billion dolars is needed - construction couldbegin in another year or two and be completed around 2010.Dr. Vogt said, \"We're going to try to find enough planets so we can begin tounderstand the statistical correlation between the shapes of their orbits and theirmasses and what kind of stars they form around to allow us to answer questionslike: How typical is our own solar system? Are there other solar systems like it?Is it unusual? Is it rare? Does Nature make solar systems like ours very often? Ordoes it not? Because that will bare most closely on our understanding ofwhether life as we know it might form in other places. So, that will be the goalas far as the planetary systems are concerned.\"We b s it e s :http://www.spaceart.org/lcook/extraso2.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
