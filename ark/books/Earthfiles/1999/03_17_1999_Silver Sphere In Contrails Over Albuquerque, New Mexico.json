But we werestopped cold by what was in the sky -- a large silver airplane at high altitude wasmaking a perfect and very large white X in a very blue sky. The X stretched fromthe western horizon up to and past the zenith. A huge X. Then we realized therewere other large Xs in the sky. And within a couple of hours, the sky was totallyovercast. A couple of days later in Phoenix, I saw similar Xs in a blue sky thatlater became overcast.I got home the first week of March and was interviewed by KCMO radio inKansas City, Missouri where I learned the Mike Murphy show had devoted itsentire program on March 4th to callers describing odd contrail patterns they hadseen in Kansas, Missouri and surrounding regions.After my interview, I received several dozen FAXes and phone calls fromKCMO listeners, including this one from a Kansas City, Missouri resident (cabdriver) who watched seven contrails forming at 8 a.m. CST on March 4th.Interviews:Kansas City, Missouri Cab Driver (preferred anonymity): \"In fact, I evencalled Murphy's producer to tell him. I said, \"Hey, man, look outside! Look atthis!\" And I'm not no nut or nothin', but this is too weird. There was one goingfrom north to the south and it was very large. It took almost the entire radius ofthe sky. I mean, it went almost as far as the eye could see to the north and wasgoing south. And it looked like it had just been laid or happened. And then itstarted to dispense a little from the inside going out. In other words, it wasgetting wider from east to west. And it started getting wider and wider. And thenthe next two or three minutes later, it may not have been that long, I saw one inthe north sky, probably up -- on a clock -- say, up to 3 o'clock. And it was goingfrom west to east.AND HOW MANY PLANES DID YOU SEE MAKING THIS?I didn't see -- a total of these lines -- I was driving and just kind of watching -- itlooked like there were about 7 lines happening at once, to me. We'll just talkabout yesterday (March 4) -- and again they did that. And then another onewent in a more, from westerly direction going southeast, almost at an angle. Itwasn't a direct cross and it wasn't like an X. It didn't seem like it was a realpattern except the lines always ended up crossing one another. And there wereabout 7 of them.LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THE SEVEN LINES. COULD YOUACTUALLY SEE AERIAL CRAFT MAKING THESE SEVEN LINES?On one. I could see it. It looked like it was pretty high up and something big. It'squite a way aways, so I don't think without binoculars or a telescope or"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"something you could really get a clear picture of it. I couldn't tell color oranything like that. I never pulled off the road as I was driving. I don't get intothis stuff too much. I'm kind of a family guy, just do my thing. But this hasblown my mind.SOMETHING IS HAPPENING.Something weird and I don't know what it is, but something's going on.\"Silver Sphere Over Albuquerque, New Mexico on March 16, 1999I have talked with a couple of pilots who said some of the Xs might result fromthe normal crossing corridors of military and civilian air traffic. But thatwouldn't explain the seemingly deliberate creation of the big X in Sedona byone plane.Then yesterday, March 16th, Matthew Duran who has lived in Albuquerque,New Mexico for 19 years, saw a silver ball move in a contrail and stop. I talkedto Mr. Duran a few hours ago about his remarkable sighting at 11:40 AM onMarch 16th in Albuquerque, New Mexico.Matthew Duran, Resident, Albuquerque, New Mexico: \"And I just got awayfrom my computer to get coffee when I happened to look out my east facingwindow. Actually, they are quite aways up, they're about 20 feet up from thefloor of the living room. And I noticed there was a set of contrails and anairplane leaving a new set parallel and not very far from the other. So, I grabbedmy binoculars which were handy and looked up at the plane and watched itfinish making the contrails as far as the view of my window was concerned. Andthen I noticed a small silver ball, or sphere, moving around in the contrails. Iwatched it for appx. Six to seven seconds moving in the contrails. And then itturned out of the contrail, went between the two sets of contrails so it's just likea small space of blue sky between the two sets of contrails. And it just stayedstationary for appx. Anywhere four to six or seven minutes.NOW, COULD YOU SEE IT MORE CLEARLY THROUGH THEBINOCULARS?Yeah, that's the funny part. It wasn't visible at all without the binoculars. Youcould not see it. I looked away for just a moment in that general direction and Icould not see it with the naked eye.AND WHEN YOU LOOKED THROUGH THE BINOCULARS, WHATEXACTLY WERE YOU SEEING?A fairly small silver sphere in relation to the size of the airplane that I watchedmaking the contrail. It was significantly smaller.AND WHEN YOU SAY SPHERE, DO YOU MEAN ROUND, OR DISCSHAPED?It was perfectly round.AND IT WAS UNMOVING?Like I said, it was moving in the contrail and then it moved out between the twosets of contrails and stayed stationary for the remainder of the time I saw it. Andthen anywhere between four or six or seven minutes, whatever it was, it shotstraight up and it was gone. In just an instant, it accelerated unbelievably.DID THE PLANE ITSELF SEEM TO HAVE ANY MOTION AS IF ITWERE AWARE OF THE PRESENCE OF THIS OBJECT?Oh, not at all. It was well out of my view when I noticed the sphere.SO, WOULD YOUR GENERAL IMPRESSION BE WHAT -- OF THISSPHERE BEING THERE?Well, I've never seen anything like it. I don't think we have any aircraft that looklike that, so I'd have to classify it as unidentified.AND THEN THE QUESTION IS: ARE THESE SPHERES IN THE"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"PROCESS OF MONITORING OR ARE THEY SOMEHOW INVOLVED?I was wondering that and mentioned it in my e-mail to Art -- that perhaps they,whoever controls these spheres, is perhaps taking an interest in what thesecontrails are for.CAN YOU DESCRIBE FURTHER WHY THE CONTRAILSTHEMSELVES GRABBED YOUR ATTENTION?Well, I have lived here in New Mexico my whole life. You get used to this big,blue sky. These contrails are not normal. They linger far too long and spread outand they tend to cloud over the entire sky eventually. Usually in the last threemonths, I've noticed it more, seems more prevalent. I've actually watched themstart at 8 in the morning and they continue all day and by the time they aredone, the sky is usually pretty clouded over.And they don't look right either. Like I said, they linger far too long. And in oneparticular instance -- I was at a soccer tournament with one of my boys -- and Ilooked up at the sun and through the contrails that were spreading out, youcould see like an oily -- it looked like an oily ring -- it just didn't look right. Ipointed it out to my wife and she said basically the same thing. \"That doesn'tlook right.\" You know how oil looks when it's on water? Kind of an iridescentquality to it. That looked very similar.NOW, DID YOU MEAN THAT YOU HAVE WATCHED THE SAMEPLANE MAKE CONTRAILS FROM 8 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNINGTHROUGHOUT THE DAY?Oh, several planes -- more than one.BUT IT WASN'T LIKE NORMAL MILITARY OR CIVILIAN TRAFFICTHAT WOULD BE CROSSING IN THE SKY?I wouldn't consider it, no. One of the reasons for it is you see the contrails starton the west end of Albuquerque and they end right over the mountain range onthe east. They always cut it off right there. They don't continue past themountains.AND SO WHAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING ARE CONTRAILSEXTENDING FROM ONE HORIZON NEARLY TO THE OTHERHORIZON?Yes, precisely.AND HAVE YOU SEEN THE LARGE X PATTERNS THAT HAVE BEENREPORTED IN SO MANY STATES?As a matter of fact, yesterday. There were several of them.SO SOME OF THE CONTRAILS YOU SAW ASSOCIATED WITH THATSILVER DISC WERE THE X SHAPED PATTERNS?Yes. The two that I saw while looking at the sphere were parallel to one another.They weren't X-shaped. I saw the X-shaped one later in the afternoon. Afterseeing that (sphere), I was pretty much watching the skies for the remainder ofthe afternoon.HAVE YOU CALLED ANYONE IN THE MILITARY OR AT AIRPORTSTO ASK ABOUT THE CONTRAIL FORMATIONS?No, I haven't. And that's something that -- having Kirtland AFB and SandiaLaboratories right here in the city -- I'm not so sure I'd get an answer anyway.I THINK IT WOULD BE WORTH TRYING. IT'S ONE OF THE THINGSI'M GOING TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE IN THE RADIOAUDIENCE TO CALL AIRPORTS, CALL VARIOUS MILITARYINSTALLATIONS AND ASK IF THEY HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUTWHO OR WHAT ARE MAKING ALL OF THESE CONTRAILS?I'd be willing to try that, I suppose. Now, I've seen contrails before, but thesejust don't look right. There is just an odd quality about them. The fact they don'tdissipate. Being as arid as this place is, usually they dissipate very quickly.\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund PolicyCopyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
