The number of deaths tripled over 1998. Marine scientists arebaffled about why the porpoises are dying in such numbers and plan to have ameeting in early June 1999 to compare research findings. I talked with Dr.Stephen J. Jordan, Director of the Sarbanes Cooperative Oxford ResearchLaboratory in Solomons Island, Maryland. His lab cooperates with the federalNational Ocean Service and Dr. Jordan summarized what researchers know sofar about the porpoise deaths.Interview:Stephen J. Jordan, Director, Sarbanes Cooperative Oxford ResearchLaboratory, Solomons Island, Maryland: \"Between the 7th of March and the20th of April, we had 19 harbor porpoises that stranded dead on Marylandbeaches, mostly on Asseteague or Ocean City, MD area. This is very unusual inthat we normally wouldn't see more than 20 or so marine animal strandings ofall species in a year. And here we had 19 harbor porpoises in a little over amonth.What about other states up and down the East Coast?My understanding is that this has been a problem throughout the mid-Atlanticand into New England from North Carolina on up into Massachusetts that therewere high numbers of harbor porpoise strandings.I have a number of approximately 162...Yeah, that sounds familiar.Dead porpoises.I believe in 11 of them we saw some evidence of net entanglement or what wecall fishery interaction in jargon. The rest of them either couldn't be determinedor there was no evidence of fishery problems. Now coast wide, it's my"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"understanding, that's not the case everywhere. There are some suspicions thatthere may be some disease problems.In interviews I do with other scientists, the same theme comes up - thatthere are so many pesticides and chemical toxins in waters now that couldbe deteriorating the immune systems of animals, including marine life.Right.If there is an increase in disease, it could be related to the fact that theirimmune systems are so overwhelmed by toxins in the water that cycles ofdisease and death in marine life keep repeating.That certainly is an emerging issue and it's not something that I'm an expert in.But it is conceivable that low levels of some of these compounds could becontaminating coastal waters and causing immune system problems. With marinemammals in particular, that's going to be a difficult issue to resolve becausewe're not permitted to just collect these animals and study them. Our onlyopportunities for research come in strandings. So, we're sort of handicapped inthat respect.Porpoises are far-ranging in the oceans. If toxins are increasing, the entireplanet is faced with the clean up problem, right?Well, certainly. And it's not just toxicity. It's not just chemical problems. But theproblems of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous loads to the coastalocean are very much an increasing concern and something that is an emergingissue we really have to keep our eye on. The fix for that is to figure out how toimprove what we do on the land.To reduce pesticide and fertilizer run off.Exactly.We are now at the beginning of May. This has been a series of unusualdeaths among porpoises in the spring. What is the outlook for the summerand fall based on seasonal increases in ebbs and flows of marine lifedeaths?That's an excellent question. The harbor porpoises have been migrating northand they are mostly out of our area now -- they've gone on up to New England,Maine and Nova Scotia area. Pretty soon we expect the bottle nosed dolphins tobe coming along the coast. Those are larger animals. We don't know whether toexpect a problem with dolphins or not. We're certainly keeping our eye on them.Normally, we have a few dolphin stranded each year, but certainly not highnumbers. And we'll be watching that very closely.If somebody is at a beach area and sees a porpoise or porpoises washing upon a beach or any other kind of marine animal, what is the correct actionpeople should take?First of all, people should not touch or approach these animals. If they are alive,they can certainly be dangerous and cause injuries. Whether they are alive ordead, they can occasionally transmit some diseases to humans, so Hands Off! isthe first thing.Secondly, call your local police department and dispatch should know whatanimal control office to contact for help.\"We b s it e s :http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/prot_res/prot_res.html (National MarineFisheries Service)Credits"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
