All eight ofthe dead dogs had quarter-inch wide puncture wounds in their neck, back andchest. The Rowan County Animal Control Center did not call for a necropsy bya veterinarian until the eighth dog was found dead early on the morning of May24th. I talked to the owner who wishes to remain anonymous about the momentshe found the oldest of her two dogs dead near the house.Interview:Eighth Dog Owner: \"When I got up at seven to go out and water my littleplants, he was closer to the steps. He was right close to the steps. And he waslaying stretched out. He was kind of an older dog. And when I went out, I said,\"All right, you better move,\" as I stepped over it. I looked and he looked so stiff,I said, \"He's dead!\" I got down real close and looked around his head. In the topof his head looked like it was scratched, scratch marks, and it was real wet. Itlooked like saliva.SALIVA.Yeah, it looked like - where something had had his head in its mouth orsomething.SO IT WAS NOT BLOOD.No, it was not blood. It was wet, clear. I call that saliva, or slobber. Anyway, thewhole top of his head was wet. And his ear was kind of clawed or chewed, therewere cut places on his ear. So, that's what made me know, \"Oh, my goodness,the thing had my dog.\"So, anyway, after we called the people and they came out...WAS THAT ANIMAL CONTROL?Animal Control came out and they turned him over. And then that's when wesaw the puncture marks on his throat and around his chest and his stomach part.They were just deep puncture marks - just like it may have been a big mouth justwent in and come back out. They weren't tear places. They were just puncturemarks.SO, LIKE HOLES GOING RIGHT INTO THE BODY.Right, like a hole went right into the skin. There wasn't a whole lot of tear.Animal Control said what killed it - one of them cut his trachea and onepunctured his heart, it went in that deep."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"RIGHT, AND I THINK THAT ONE WAS ABOUT FOUR INCHESLONG.Right.AND IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY FROM HAVING TALKEDWITH CLARENCE FOX AT ANIMAL CONTROL ANDENVIRONMENTAL SUPERVISION, HE SAID THERE REALLYWASN'T MUCH BLOOD AT THESE HOLES. IS THAT TRUE?Right, there wasn't no blood hardly anywhere. There was just a little bit ofblood where the dog was lying. So we were trying to figure out, \"Whathappened to the blood?\" You know, something that cut that deep in thatpuncture - \"Well, where's the blood?!\" Because we didn't see anything until theycame and turned him over - even the scrape mark on his head looked like wherethe blood - like you would probably get scraped on the cement, like you mayfall and a little scraping and blood might come up there and stop. That's whatlooked like in his head.SO NO BLOOD WAS OOZING FROM THESE HOLES?No. When they turned him over, no. We were trying to figure, \"Is somethingsucking blood?\" Because where was the blood?! You know, because with thatmany holes, the blood should have been running out. You know, by the time hewas killed and before he died, the blood should have been running out of thoseholes.CLARENCE FOX, ENVIRONMENTAL SUPERVISOR FOR ROWANCOUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA, IS CURRENTLY IN CHARGE OFINVESTIGATING THE BIZARRE PUNCTURE ATTACKS.IN TERMS OF ONGOING INVESTIGATION IN A SITUATION LIKE THISWHERE YOU HAVE UNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHS WITH PUNCTUREMARKS AND LITTLE BLOOD HAPPENING IN A RASH OF TWO ORTHREE WEEKS RESULTING IN EIGHT DOG DEATHS, HOW DO YOU GOABOUT TRYING TO INVESTIGATE AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO SEEIF YOU CAN FIND WHAT THIS IS?Clarence Fox, Environmental Supervisor, Rowan County, North Carolina:\"Well, we're going up there and going through the properties looking for tracks,for any kind of droppings. When the time we get another report of anotherfatality or injury or something like that, we'll go up there and investigate it.We've got traps set trying to catch the animal.HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN THE ENVIRONMENTALSUPERVISOR?Five years.AND IN THE FIVE YEARS, HAVE YOU HAD REPORTS OFPUNCTURE MARKS IN ANIMAL DEATHS LIKE THIS BEFORE?Haven't had anything like this before.AND THE LACK OF BLOOD IS PUZZLING?That hasn't bothered me as much as just the fact that there hasn't been a lot ofsounds or struggle or anything. People are not woken up by all this activity.Seems to go on close to their homes, but they just don't hear anything.AND IT'S DEFINITELY LATE AT NIGHT?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Late at night or early in the morning. You know, before the sun comes up.BECAUSE PEOPLE KNEW THE ANIMAL WAS ALIVE WHEN THEYWENT TO BED AND THEY FIND THEM IN THE MORNING?On occasion, people have gotten up and heard their dogs bark and looked outand seen what's going on and not seen anything and gone back to bed. And thengotten up and the dog's been dead. That happened in two cases.AND THAT WAS RELATIVELY CLOSE TO THE HOUSE.Yeah. I know definitely one of them was because I was out there. And the otherone, I understand it was.AND THE PUNCTURE MARKS THAT YOU HAVE SEEN WITH YOUROWN EYES, FROM ANIMAL TO ANIMAL, THEY ARE ALL ABOUT AQUARTER INCH IN DIAMETER?I've only seen the one animal that was autopsied. Animal Control staff saw theother one.AND IN THE ELEVEN PUNCTURES IN THE MAY 23RD KILL, WERETHEY ALL THE SAME SIZE, ABOUT A QUARTER-INCH DIAMETER?The ones I saw were. None of them were any real jagged tears or any large holesor anything like that.THEY JUST LOOKED LIKE REALLY CLEAN HOLES PENETRATINGINTO THE DOG?Ye a h .AND WERE THE HOLES CONCENTRATED AROUND THE NECK?On the side of the neck, the back of the neck and the chest, in front of the frontleg.AND HOW MANY WERE IN THE HEART AREA?There were a number there. I can't tell you the exact count, but the one that theveterinarian indicated to me punctured the heart. But there were a number ofthem around in that area.AND DID SHE SAY IF ANY HEART TISSUE HAD BEEN ACTUALLYREMOVED?She didn't indicate to me anything. She said there was a puncture in it.THERE WAS A PUNCTURE IN THE HEART?Ye s .AND DID THE VETERINARIAN HAVE ANY SUGGESTION?I think she thought it might be a large mammal.A LARGE MAMMAL. BUT WHAT LARGE MAMMAL WOULD HAVEFOUR INCH LONG STRAIGHT TEETH?The closest thing we would have in this area would be a cougar, but I think theirteeth are bigger diameter than that."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"HAVE YOU TALKED WITH ANY INVESTIGATORS ABOUT THATSEQUENCE OF CHUPACABRAS EVENTS BETWEEN 1995 AND 1996?I read some of it off the internet, but I haven't talked to anybody about it. I stillhave an open mind about what it could be and I haven't ruled anything out. ButI don't have any conclusive evidence.THE OWNER OF THE MAY 24TH AUTOPSIED DOG DID FINDSTRANGE THREE-TOED TRACKS. THAT REMINDED ME OF THETHREE TOES AND FINGERS DESCRIBED BY EYEWITNESSES INPUERTO RICO WHO CLAIMED ENCOUNTERS WITH THECHUPACABRAS 'GOAT SUCKER.\"Eighth dog owner: \"The night he jumped our dog - the one that we brought in -we went out and it had three scratch things, like three claws, like an animalmakes a print in the dirt. It was three scratch marks like it had three claws on hisfeet or hands or what not.CLAW MARKS.Claw marks, like six or seven sets were over there. There were three together.There were three because I counted them and they looked like they might havebeen two or three inches long and maybe about an inch wide, maybe not quitethat wide. We did see those. It's been really spooky back here.Since then, three days after - OK, that happened and then they came back andattacked our other dog. But we were watching, we were listening and watching,and the dog was on the dark side of the house. And we heard (sounds) and wehollered and it ran away. Then we went out and the dog did have a little tearplace on his ear.SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT AFTER YOU FOUND THE ONE DOG ONMAY 24TH, THAT THREE NIGHTS LATER THERE WAS ANOTHERATTACK ON YOUR OTHER YOUNGER DOG?Yeah, but now we keeps him on our deck and we keeps him up close - we puthim on the deck at night and shut him up. We put him on the car porch in theday. But, yes, he came back.WELL, WHEN YOU GOT UP TO LOOK AT ALL THE COMMOTION,COULD YOU SEE ANYTHING?The only thing about it is if we had to do it over again, we would have done itdifferent. My dog (whimper sounds) like whimpering. Then all of a sudden, weheard this (growl sound) like a real deep growl... then we heard like they weretussling... and I hollered at them and by the time we got out and put the lightson, the dog had hushed.WHO DO YOU THINK WAS MAKING THE DEEP GROWL?I think the growl was coming from something else because this dog I don't thinkcould have a growl that deep. Now, he might have, but it was too deep for him.And then I think the whimper - he had been scared since the other dog had beenkilled. He wouldn't even bark. He wouldn't bark, and he'd been a barking dog.And from that night - when our other dog got killed to this night, we hadn'theard a whimper out of him. He wouldn't bark. And then we hear that little crylike (whimper) like he was just afraid something was there (whimper). We neverheard a (deep growl) out of him. It could have been him doing it, but if it was - itwas awful deep. And then we heard a tussle like and more growl and somethinghitting against the house. And I hollered, \"Get away from him! Get away fromhim!\" And it didn't turn loose right then. It continued for maybe another 30 or40 seconds more. And then it hushed and thought the dog was dead. So, we gotflashlights and went out to the dog and found our other dog and brought him in."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"We could have gotten killed out there, but we took a chance on going around tothe dark side of the house and finding the dog. And he was tucked into thehouse scared to death.But he was wet - he was wet around that place where the nick were. That's whyI knew whatever the night before (with the other dog) was this here, it was thesame. But we haven't heard a thing since.\"More Information:I investigated chupacabras attacks in Puerto Rico, Mexico and southern U. S.states between 1995 to June 1996. After that, those first chupacabras reportsseemed to end. But now, these incidents in Woodleaf, North Carolina remindme of what I've heard before: the clear, thick saliva-like liquid, bloodlesspuncture wounds a quarter-inch diameter, the three-toed claw marks.If anyone has heard of any other reports recently, please email me atEarthfiles.com or FAX me at 215-491-9842, or write to me at P.
