Or a slurry ofcomputers painted on your wall.\"Phil Kueckes, Computer Architect,Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, Palo Alto,California, July 1999August 18, 1999 Palo Alto, California In mid-July 1999, Hewlett-PackardLabs and the University of California at Los Angeles made headlines with abreakthrough that seems like science fiction making integrated circuits forcomputers no bigger than molecules. Currently, the on-off switches forcomputing are made by etching pathways with beams of light on silicon waferchips. But light has a wavelength and cannot make anything smaller than thatwavelength.The researchers say they have now figured out how to use chemistry, not light,to make wires and switches as small as molecules. \"This is about as small aswe're going to get things,\" said Phil Kuekes, a computer architect at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories in Palo Alto, California who also earned a physics degreefrom Yale University in 1969.Recently I talked with Mr. Kuekes by telephone at his office in Palo Alto andasked him to explain how chemistry can be used to make molecule-size wiresand switches.Interview:Phil Kuekes, Computer Architect, Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, PaloAlto, California: \"The first thing is that the entire chip won't be a molecule.But the switches, the gates, the parts of the chip will be molecules. And we'llput a large number of those together to make the chip.BUT HOW DO YOU GET DOWN TO MOLECULES?Molecules are made of atoms. They are a collection of atoms that are stable, youcan build and they'll hold together. So, if I were a computer scientist and Iwanted to build a really small computer, I would realize that fundamentally Icouldn't get any smaller than atoms. So, suppose I were looking around forsomebody to work with me in the 21st Century to build things out of atoms toorder?Well, it turns out there's a perfectly good and honorable name for such peoplefor about the past 150 years. We call them chemists. So, chemists are peoplewho really do know how to build something to order on an atomic scale. Theproblem is that what chemists can build are relatively simple molecules, whilebiology can create extremely complex things. And we need a designer of a"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"computer to be able to say: 'This is what I want. Create it, no matter howcomplex.'So, what our work has done is to produce things much smaller than thewavelength of light or even x-rays which would be required for the lithographicprocess. We have found a way to use relatively simple molecules and then lateron have a computer program add the complexity. So, the manufacturing happensin two steps. You create a simple chemical structure - almost crystalline - andthen all the complexity of a modern computer chip gets downloaded in a secondstep.What we're doing is using chemically synthesized wires that can be made muchsmaller than lithographic wires. Long term, these will become the carbonnanotubes we have written about about which are in fact only a few atomsacross.IT ISN'T REALLY WIRE?Oh, it's wire and it's long and they conduct. They are metallic. The carbonnanotubes are in fact the most conductive substance known on earth. But theyare chemically synthesized. So to some extent, what we're talking about are longcrystals of metals which are wires. That's what we mean by wires - it's long andnarrow and it conducts electricity.BUT IF WE COULD SEE IT, WOULD THE MOLECULE SIZE WIRESRESEMBLE VERY THIN CRYSTALS?It's hard to tell the difference. It's relatively stiff, an incredibly stiff thing. Itwould be more like a bar of metal. It's long and straight and stiff and that's theway that all the wires that are printed on an integrated circuit are. They don'tflop around. The silicon is very rigid because it's all bonded to a perfect crystalwhich is silicon.But you need switches, and the work we reported in Science(www.sciencemag.org/ Pages 391-394, July 16, 1999) allows us to use inprincipal a single molecule as a switch that can be set open or shut. When it'sshut, it conducts electricity. When it's open, it doesn't.I AM HAVING DIFFICULTY IMAGINING AN OPEN OR SHUTMOLECULE. WHAT IS OPENING OR SHUTTING ON THEMOLECULE FOR A SWITCH?OK, there are many molecules which have more than one state. The moleculeswe use actually do change shapes slightly. And so they have two possible states,two different shapes it can be in. And in one of those shapes, it conductselectricity very well through a process which is technically called quantummechanical tunneling. And in another shape, it doesn't conduct at all. And thereis a huge difference in conductivity - potentially as much as 100:1 between thetwo shapes.WHAT CHANGES THE SHAPE?The wonderful thing - and this is what we reported in our paper in Science - ifwe send pulses down the wires that have a big enough voltage, I can change theshape of the molecule and make it conduct or not conduct. If I use a smallervoltage, then I can actually run it as a computer based on what has beenconnected or not connected.MEANING ZERO OR ONE.Meaning zero or one, exactly. And that's what we use to build up thecomplexity of the computer.IN TERMS OF THE PARTICULAR SUBSTANCE THAT YOU AREUSING, THAT CHANGES SHAPE THAT ALLOWS ELECTRIC FLOWOR NO ELECTRIC FLOW, WHAT ELEMENT IS IT?It is not a single element. It is a molecule. It's an organic molecule calledRotoxane. It's synthetic, but it's made of carbon and oxygen and hydrogen and"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"nitrogen. Rotoxane is organic in the sense that sugar and alcohol or one of thoseare and it's plastic. So, it's made of the same type of molecules - the same kind ofelements - that people mix together when they are making plastics, for example.Rotoxane molecule, energy and switch mode diagrams © 1999 by Phil Kuekes.IS PART OF THE BREAKTHROUGH THAT YOU'VE HAD TO COMEUP WITH A PARTICULAR ALLOY THAT WOULD HAVE THESECHARACTERISTICS OF A SHAPE-SHIFTING MOLECULE?There are several parts to it. So, the first part - I got together with Stan Williamsat H. P. Labs, a chemist, and Prof. James Heath at UCLA who is also a chemist.And the first step was to work out a method where chemistry could work withcomputer architecture. And then given this basic idea that we were going to havechemically constructed wires which were metallic and molecular switches, we"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"started looking around for the wires and switches. We knew that things like thecarbon nanotubes would be wires. So, we had to look for a switch. And we gotin touch with Prof. Frasier Stoddard now at UCLA who had- for completelyother purposes - designed these molecules which changed their shape.The chemists in the group suspected very strongly - I'm the computer guy - theysuspected it would have exactly the electrical properties that we needed to builda computer.SOMETHING THAT COULD GO ZERO OR ONE, BE TURNED ON BYELECTRICITY OR BE TURNED OFF BY ELECTRICITY.That's exactly right. So, the important breakthrough was that we found that wehad all the properties we needed in a single molecule. That's important.BUT DID YOU CONSTRUCT OR DID THE OTHER SCIENTISTSCONSTRUCT THIS MOLECULE SPECIFICALLY FROM SCRATCHTO TRY TO ACCOMPLISH THIS ON/OFF TRANSFORMATION?No, it was constructed from scratch. It was a synthetic molecule. It wasconstructed in a test tube. However, it was done just because it was aninteresting molecule to construct - essentially as basic research. It is a veryinteresting molecule.IT IS IN THE PLASTIC CATEGORY?Ye s .ANYTHING THAT HAS A STRONG CARBON BASE.Yes, fundamentally anything that has a lot of carbon in it. The carbon is whatmakes this stuff work.WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS BREAKTHROUGH FORCOMPUTERS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS?Well, let me first talk about two years and what we think we're going to do. Injust two years, we are going to take in an area that is as small as where two ofthe smallest wires anybody can make for an integrated circuit in the lab - andwhere two of those wires cross, they form a little tiny square. Inside of thatsquare, we are going to build an integrated circuit that is as complicated as onethat I actually used in 1970 to build computers out of. This one two years fromnow won't be a full computer chip, but it will be able to add one and one andget two, or store 16 bits, not 16 megabits. So, we believe we will have a realbuilding block that is an actual integrated circuit far smaller than any transistoranybody else can build today.So, what does that mean in ten years? Well, in ten years that means potentiallythat we will have entire computers - not just in your wrist watch, but woven intoyour clothing. Or a slurry of computers painted on your wall.WHAT DO YOU ENVISION RIGHT NOW THAT THESE VERY TINYCOMPUTERS COULD BE DOING IN TEN YEARS ON CLOTHES ANDWAL LS?It will make it possible to have computing power with you, right? Clearly, smartand creative people will create fashion statements - your clothes will be able tochange colors and patterns. So, this is a medium that a lot of creative people aregoing to be able to step up and start using. Your wall maybe becomes yourtelevision screen, or your computer screen.THE ENTIRE WALL RATHER THAN A MACHINE?Yeah, an entire wall. Because the machines themselves start to disappear.BECAUSE YOU CAN ACTUALLY 'PAINT' ON WALLS WITH THEMOLECULE SIZE INTEGRATED CIRCUITS?That's right, and with a huge number of I-Cs that will be able to talk to eachother. It's going to make a huge change when they shrink in size and in price."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Once you start using chemistry to assemble a computer, the price is going todrop dramatically.WHY IS IT THAT CHEMISTRY HAS THE ABILITY TO GO DOWNEASIER TO THE MOLECULAR LEVEL THAN PHOTON ETCHING?The fundamental reason is that the wavelength of ordinary light like you and Isee is absolutely gigantic compared to an atom. It's tens of thousands of timesbigger. So, in fact in an attempt to make smaller and smaller things, currentintegrated circuits are no longer made with ordinary light. They are made withultraviolet light. And people are talking about x-rays to make them - incrediblypowerful x-ray machines.THE REASON IS TO GET THAT WAVELENGTH SHORTER ANDSHORTER?Yes, you have to get the wavelengths shorter and shorter and that causes a lot ofproblems. The present technology fundamentally for making integrated circuitsis like taking a stencil and spraying paint through it. The light is used to cutthrough the stencil. An integrated circuit is very complex. There are many levelsof stencil that you have to very precisely and mechanically line up. That's whyexisting integrated circuit factories, the new ones today, are costing a few billiondollars. This very precise mechanical equipment is very, very expensive.What chemists know how to do is by getting the temperature and pressure in themixture of chemicals right, they are able to have the molecules come together ina very precise way and essentially only in that way. There will be some that arewrong. But when they are wrong, you can separate them out.There's no such thing as a sugar molecule or water molecule or plastic moleculewith a scratch or bump or smudge on it. Once you make them, they are allabsolutely identical. That's not true of lithographic processes.WHEN YOU HAVE IDENTICAL MOLECULES SUCH AS THISSYNTHETIC MOLECULE YOU HAVE MADE OUT OF ORGANICCARBON WITH SOME OTHER ELEMENTS, IT IS THE SAME FROMMOLECULE TO MOLECULE THAT MAKES THE NANOTUBEWIRES.Connects the nanotube wires. The molecules connect the wires. So, we maketwo things in the chemistry lab: we're going to make wires and we're going tomake the molecule switches. And then we put them together. Chemically.CAN YOU GIVE A WORD PICTURE OF EXACTLY WHAT YOU AREWORKING WITH WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO THE MOLECULARLEVEL OF THE NANOTUBE WIRES AND THOSE MOLECULESWITCHES.Basically what we have is one wire and two other wires cross that wire and inbetween at the cross points, wherever they cross, there are a bunch ofmolecules. Maybe not one, maybe two, or three or four - but there will be asmall number.THE PART WHERE THE MOLECULES ARE IS THE SWITCH TOTHOSE WIRES?The switch, and I can connect them or not connect them.BUT EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE WIRES AND THE SWITCHES ARE ONLY MOLECULES IN DIAMETER?A molecule or a few atoms in diameter, right. Everything will be. Now, what webuilt today that's in the news and we've actually got working is - we have twovery big wires that are tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of atomsacross. But in between those wires, there is a layer of molecules that is exactlyone molecule wide. The distance between those two wires in the experiment wehave recently done down at UCLA is exactly one molecule. It's only about 20atoms long. And it works!IN TWO YEARS, LET'S SAY, WHEN YOU ARE ACTUALLY IN THE"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"PROCESS OF CREATING THESE FIRST MOLECULE SIZEINTEGRATED CIRCUITS, WHAT PHYSICALLY WILL IT LOOKLIKE?It's too small to see, that's the first thing. So to some extent, you can never lookat it, except with a very special microscope like a scanning tunneling microscopethat can see individual atoms.HOW DOES THIS GET MANUFACTURED?Right! So, what we're going to do is again what chemists do: fundamentallyshake and bake. They arrange things so they get the temperature right and theymix things together which naturally crystallize. So, we're going to use chemicalforces to align all the wires properly and get the molecules in the right place.But then the problem is: how do we connect wires to it? So, we're working withProf. Paul McKuen at the Univ. of California, Berkeley, who is one of the worldexperts at attaching probes to individual carbon nanowires and measuring theirconductivity. And he's going to use some of his techniques to actually use anextraordinary high powered microscope and connect to our little chip which isimpossible to see with ordinary light.WHEN YOU START MANUFACTURING THESE NEW MOLECULARINTEGRATED CIRCUITS, WILL IT ACTUALLY BE A CRYSTALINSIDE THE COMPUTER?It's crystal-like. I don't want to push the analogy. Certain parts like the wires areactually somewhat crystalline. It's crystal-like in that it's a very regular structure.PHYSICALLY TO THE EYE I'M ASSUMING THAT ALL THESEMOLECULES IN WIRES AND SWITCHES HOOKED TOGETHERAND CREATING VERY POWERFUL AND SMALL COMPUTERS THEY HAVE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF PHYSICAL SUBSTANCE.It's going to look something like a film of plastic. The manufacturing process ofthis may very well be like making something like photographic film. It's verycomplex, but essentially it's all chemistry. It's very different chemicals allsandwiched together.THIS IS WHERE IT COULD BECOME ALMOST LIKE FABRIC THATCOULD BE LAYERED ON WALLS, OR SEWN INTO CLOTHES?Sewn into clothes or maybe it becomes the thread itself. This is so small that thethreads may be computationally capable. What we're really talking about hereare smart materials. Right now, we manufacture plastic or metal or steel oraluminum or glass or whatever. But those materials are kind of dumb. What ifwe could combine manufacturing the substance with our molecular integratedcircuits so the materials themselves would get smart?THE MATERIALS WOULD BE SMART HAVING THE ABILITY TOREACT TO LIGHT, TO HEAT, TO TEMPERATURE, TO TOUCH?Right, exactly. We are going to be able to program them the people whounderstand computer programs will be able to program these materials to reactappropriately.DO YOU HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE GOTON YOUR DRAWING BOARDS THAT COULD BE REACTIVE IN TENYEARS?Not really. What we're really starting to do is build 'he building blocks. So, we'recreating the Lego bricks. It's up to somebody else who understands, \"Hey, theseare Lego bricks. I can build really interesting stuff with them.' But we're going tohave something that interlocks, that are all going to work together. That's animportant first step.THE RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES IS EVERYTHING FROM BEINGABLE TO COAT AN ENTIRE WALL TO BECOME A DIGITALSCREEN OR CREATE A DRESS THAT HAD SMART THREADSWHICH COULD ACTUALLY CHANGE THE COLORS?Or create a new pattern, even. Exactly."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"WHAT ABOUT MEDICAL APPLICATIONS OF MOLECULE SIZEINTEGRATED CIRCUITS?They could be diagnostics because these machines are smaller than a bacteria.So, you can imagine one of these up against a bacteria saying, 'Hey, this is aparticularly bad strain.' And identifying it so the doctor knows how to treat it.ANY POSSIBILITY THAT THESE KINDS OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITSCOULD BE INSERTED INTO CANCER CELLS TO DEFEAT THEM?It's a possibility. There's a huge number of other technical challenges, but if youcould tell the cancerous cell from the non-cancerous cell that's clearly a toolyou would like to have around.THE PROGRAMMED INTEGRATED CIRCUIT ITSELF COULDEXPLORE THE BODY LOOKING FOR THE CANCEROUS CELLS.Potentially. There's a lot of technical difficulties. For example, if you putanything in the body, the body quickly attacks it and eats it and destroys it.BUT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS MADE OUT OF CARBON.The body attacks things made out of carbon. Our bodies are pretty smart. Butnonetheless, in spite of the challenges, this is clearly going to be a tool of greatinterest to biomedical scientists.WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO BE THE FIRST FUNCTIONINGPRODUCT?In two years, we'll have something in the lab with very painstakingly difficultwires attached to it to prove that it's working. Only in the lab. Then, the babywill grow up. And in 10 years, I think there is a good chance that it could startcompeting head to head with existing integrated circuits in a lot of stuff.That's around the time in 2010 when light or x-ray produced integrated circuitsare going to find it pretty hard going because they won't be able to be made anysmaller. But my guess is that we will see things before that. We are literally ableto store information in a way that it won't erase when you take the power off. It'snon-volatile on a scale of molecules. So, you might imagine very interesting CDROMS with tremendous capability before 2010. That's clearly one of the earlythings you start thinking about.SO THIS PLASTIC MATERIAL THAT COULD FUNCTION AT THEMOLECULAR LEVEL WITH THE WIRES AND THE SWITCHESWOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS ONTO ACD?Might very well be able to. I haven't done that calculation, but we will be ableto have immense storage capability from this.HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN TALKING TO INTEL? I'M THINKING THATINTEL PENTIUM CHIPS WOULD EITHER BE RUNNING SCAREDOR THEY WOULD BE TRYING TO BUY UP YOUR IDEAS.Well, HP works with a lot of companies. Everyone in the industry is going tofollow this kind of idea. We've worked successfully with Intel in the past. So Iexpect if our horse does well in the horse race, and this is very early technology,there are going to be a lot of opportunities to take advantage of it.AT THIS POINT HEWLETT-PACKARD WOULD BE WANTING TOPUT ITSELF IN THE FOREFRONT OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS ANDALL THE TRADITIONAL WORK IT HAS DONE?We have a very basic technology. And it's going to take a lot of work anddifferent people in a lot of companies to understand the full businessapplications of this. We just want to be in a position to be one of the leaders.IT' IS AS IF YOU ARE DESCRIBING A WORLD SO STRANGE THATIT'S ALMOST BEYOND SCIENCE FICTION AS STRANGE IN 1999 ASTHIS YEAR WOULD BE TO PEOPLE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO IN"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"THE YEAR 1899. COLLAPSING IN TEN YEARS WHAT TOOK AHUNDRED BEFORE.I'm not sure it's 100 years to ten, but things are collapsing faster now. That isdefinitely true. And so, it's really important for the general public to hear aboutthese things. To understand what potentially is coming.Who would have guessed if you had been looking in the 1960s and 1950s and40s and 70s even at movies that the invention of videotape would go to theMTV style of a video with its rapid jumping around. A very different style frommovie making. And indeed, fashion might dramatically change to a very differentstyle that anyone walking around today would ever expect. Stranger things havehappened.IT' IS SOMETHING TO REALIZE THAT WHAT WE'RE MOVINGINTO IS A NEW REVOLUTION IN WHICH THE COATINGS ONEVERYTHING COULD BE THE POWER, THE I-C, THE COLOR,LIGHTS THE VERY COATINGS THEMSELVES.Yes, it could be the coatings and the material it's made of, yes. One way ofthinking about this - and I think potentially it is a new Industrial Revolution - isthat we build these things very simply using chemistry. But then in affect, even ifthey have defects, we train them around the defects and produce very complexand very interesting things.Right now, the I-C factories are so very expensive because they require a fortunein capital equipment to make very precise parts that fit together to make an I-C.We're saying, if you can build sloppy chemical parts, do it cheaply in a test tube.Even if they have defects, we're going to train around those defects usingessentially smart labor of powerful supercomputers. So, computers are going totrain this material to become smart.
