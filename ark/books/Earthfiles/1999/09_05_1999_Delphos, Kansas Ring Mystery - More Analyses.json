It's the 24th lab report for Ted over thepast three decades in a strange case known as the Delphos, Kansas ring mystery.Twenty-eight years ago on the night of November 2, 1971, teenager RonaldJohnson went outdoors to check his sheep penned up about 250 feet northeastof his family's farmhouse. He heard a rumbling noise and watched a verypeculiar, round aerial craft descend toward the ground. Later, astronomer J.Allen Hynek who consulted with the U. S. Air Force on Project Blue Book andcreated the Center for UFO Studies, investigated a ring that remained in soil onthe farm. Hynek asked Ted Phillips to gather soil samples and Ted traveled tothe Delphos farm in 1975, three and a half years after Ron Johnson's encounter.Ron is now in his mid-40's, does not want any publicity, but has described ingreat detail for Ted Phillips the round craft that hovered only 40 feet from wherehe was standing.Interview:Ted Phillips, Physical Trace Investigator, Center for UFO Studies, ReedsSpring, Missouri: \"The thing was about 5 feet thick, the body of the object. Itwas about 8 to 10 feet in diameter. The surface was brilliantly glowing withmulti-colored light. Not individual lights. Not changing colors, but just amixture of all colors of lights. It was very bright. It hurt his eyes. His dog,Snowball, was with him and he stood there very quietly which is very unlike adog. No barking, no reaction, other than he was standing very quiet. The sheepwere not moving around. Ron could not move. He wanted to run, but couldn'tmove. Beneath the object was what he called a \"stem.\" He described it as like amushroom - the body of the mushroom being the object, the stem being adifferent textured display which looked like a fluid or shimmering materialdropping to the ground from the base of the object about 6 feet wide and itended about a foot above the ground. On the ground he could see what lookedlike steam or a haze rising in a circular pattern.He had a very clear view of the object from 40 feet and he stood there for whathe thought was about five or six minutes. And suddenly, the bright stem of thisthing brightened, expanded somewhat, the object tilted slightly to the west andmoved away silently through the trees, made a turn to the right, gained inaltitude and passed over a 5-foot high hog shed. As it did so, the sound changedfrom a rumbling like an old washing machine out of balance to a high-pitchedwhistling sound. At that point he lost his vision. And I asked him if it was totalblack or if he could see spots like from a photo flash. And he said, 'Totallyblack. No spots. No light of any kind.' He could hear the sound of the objectreceding slowly to the south. After an undetermined period of time, he began toregain his vision. Saw the object still in the southern sky beyond the house.So, he hurriedly told his parents what had happened. They ran around behindthe hog shed and there in the total darkness where the object had been"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"stationary was an 8 foot ring of glowing dirt. And this material was not glowingat the center. It was sort of a big doughnut and lower portions of the trees withintwo or three feet above the ring were also glowing. And the area was lit up. Hismother told me it was bright enough that you could have read a newspaper.Ron asked his mother, 'Do you have any film in the camera?' So she goes to thecloset and gets out an old Polaroid 104 and there was one image left. The flashunit was separately contained in the box. She didn't take the flash unit. It has tobe attached to the camera which is kind of a chore and they went out and shephotographed the ring. So, we have there an image which clearly shows theglowing ring taken within minutes of the ascent of the object. This is the onlycase like this that I'm aware of.Photograph © 1971 by Ron Johnson, Delphos, Kansas;provided with permission by Ted Phillips, Former Investigator, Center forUFO Studies (CUFOS). Photograph taken immediately after Johnson's encounter withan unidentified aerial craft that emitted a liquid-looking substance onto the ground.After she had taken the picture, Mr. And Mrs. Johnson leaned down and Mrs.Johnson laid her hand flat on the ring surface and rubbed it. There was nowarmth. It actually felt cool and glassy. Mr. Johnson later confirmed this. Thesoil surface felt as though it was a slick crust pitted with tiny craters. Andinstantly, they both noticed their hands going numb. And Mrs. Johnson rubbedher hand on her slacks on her upper right leg to try to get the soil off. Thatportion of her leg became numb. The numbing effect in her hands lasted aboutthree weeks. She was a nurse. She couldn't take pulses. Mr. Johnson being arough-handed old farmer - the effect lasted 2 or 3 days with him. The boysuffered severe headaches. His eyes watered. He had nightmares.The sheriff photographed the ring the next day. Beautiful photos showing thatthe surface of this ring was very highly reflective white material. And the soil inthe center and around it muddy and dark as you would expect.Photograph © 1971 by Sheriff Harlan Enlow, Ottawa County,Kansas Sheriff's Office.

Because there it is, there is a nice growth of weeds in thisunaffected central area and all around the ring and in the ring looks like desertsoil. There isn't a grain of anything growing in there.Photograph © 1975 by Ted Phillips taken of Delphos, Kansas ring three and a half yearsafterRon Johnson's encounter with an unidentified aerial object on November 2, 1971.After I reached the place after we heard about the case, there had been a lightsnow. I went to the ring. The snow had melted all over the farm lot and therewas standing water and a mud bog everywhere except the ring which was stilloutlined by snow. I took my hand and removed the snow from the ring and thesoil was light brown and as dry as a freshly waxed automobile surface. Youcould pour water onto the ring surface, even months later, and it would simplybead up in tiny spheres rather than be absorbed. The soil is totally hydrophobic.The samples I had up until the last lab test was still hydrophobic. It would notabsorb water. It was totally sapped of all moisture.WELL, IT'S 28 YEARS LATER, TED, AND YOU'VE HAD A LOT OFTESTING DONE. WHAT IS THE SUMMARY OF THIS MOST RECENTSERIES OF TESTS?There is no composition whereby any of the laboratories could say this isextraterrestrial. But Erol Faruk who was at Nottingham University in England -now working for another lab - in a 2-page summary of all his work - and heworked on this stuff for a very long time. For brevity, I'll just quote a part of this.'With regard to a summary on what I believe the Delphos analysis tells us.Everything points in my mind to a genuine case and a model, in fact, can beproposed based on the analysis data that fit surprisingly well with Ronald'ssighting.'That goes on and down here he says, 'My strong belief is that the soil compoundwas responsible for the surface light emission of the object and was depositedinto the ground as an aqueous solution for an unknown reason.' And then hesays (it might be) 'a reduction in weight on the part of the object.'And then the latest analysis which began in a major laboratory in the UnitedStates in Dec. of 1998 with the last of the samples and was completed in Aprilof this year. And very briefly, the conclusion - and this report was drawn up byan analytical chemist who has 35 years of experience with one of the major labsin the country and is ranked as one of the top ten analytical chemists in the U. S.- and she says, quote: 'There has been a definite release of material. This analystconcurs with Erol Faruk in that it was most probably deposited as an aqueoussolution. The material coats the soil's surface still imparting the hydrophobiceffect noted 27 years ago.'"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"MEANING THAT SOME KIND OF LIQUID CAME DOWN OUT OFTHIS OBJECT?That's what Ron Johnson was seeing and describing as the 'stem.'IT SOAKED INTO THE GROUND AND IT IS STILL MEASURABLETODAY AND WATER CANNOT PENETRATE THE SOIL?The last time I saw it that was absolutely true. I would point out that this effectin only the ring soil went 14 inches below the surface.14 INCHES!14 inches. This was not found - if you would go - what I did was run coresamples down taking half of the core on the one edge of the ring - the other halfin the central unaffected portion. The central unaffected portion was simplynormal black soil all the way down to that depth and it ended abruptly at theedge of the ring where you then had the hydrophobic material.At any rate, this analytical chemist goes on, 'Based on the presence of the highconcentration of oxcylic acid (oxcylic acid is a natural product in the soil).However, such a high concentration would not be expected from the usual plantsource. One of my colleagues suggested an exhaust from a low-temperatureoxidization or combustion engine whose fuel source was elemental carbon couldleave a high concentration of the acid along with the other lower molecularweight acids.'BUT NONE OF THESE LABS TO DATE - 24 DIFFERENT ANALYSESOVER 28 YEARS - NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO ISOLATE, ANALYZEAND SAY WHAT THIS AQUEOUS COMPOUND IS?Well, the problem is it's - as I understand it from Faruk - it is highly unstable andhe just reached the point where he did not have the equipment to continueanalysis of this compound. Oak Ridge had started that because they weresending us high quality electron microscope images showing some of thestructures in this coating material. And they were sending us images of verysmall particles of soil on which you can actually see the compound. (UntilHynek and Phillips were notified that due to 'changes in management,' nomorematerials analyses could be done at Oak Ridge.)So, Hynek followed up Faruk's plea to try to get NASA - having the availabilityof any lab in the country - to pursue getting the composition of this coatingmaterial. But it was a brick wall. As it always was. Maybe they already knowwhat it is. I don't know.\"More Information:Ted is very frustrated that after all these years and tests, he still doesn't have aprecise answer about exactly what the white glowing compound is. But he willbe sending the latest analyses to the Center for UFO Studies for distribution tothe public in the near future. This is the only case on record that Ted Phillipsand I know about where a soil ring glowed brightly over four days before fading.It's also important to point out that the Johnson family never did want anypublicity. In fact, the extraordinary story might never have surfaced if Ron hadn'ttried to find someone else to photograph the glowing ring after his mother'scamera ran out of film. Ron went to the small, local newspaper office to find aphotographer. The editor said it wasn't important enough to send a reporter outuntil the next day. The girl who was assigned, Thaddea Smith, interviewed allthe Johnsons and then contacted a Salina, Kansas radio station and the sheriff. ,Ron Johnson and his parents began to be ridiculed unfairly and without anyreason except human denial and fear of the unknown. Eventually, the Delphos,Kansas ring made national news and was promptly attacked by professionaldebunkers such as Philip Klass."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Two years ago in 1997, the strange ring was still there on the farm and stillwould not absorb water. Ron Johnson - now in his mid-forties and tired of beingdefensive about what he had watched with his own eyes as a teenager - decidedhe didn't want to see the ring anymore and covered it up with a ton of soil. So,these analyses briefly summarized by Ted Phillips might be the last ones on themysterious ring that never went away.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
