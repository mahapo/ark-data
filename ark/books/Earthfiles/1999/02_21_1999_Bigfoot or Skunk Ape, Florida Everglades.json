With thisvote, the commission has a temporary restraining order against the apartmentcontractor who wanted to dig up the holes so he could finish his buildingproject. With the commission's actions, a jury will now have to decide howmuch money will be paid the contractor to buy the site for Dade Countypreservation.I also learned that scientists studying the site have discovered hundreds ofsmaller holes inside the one big circle of larger holes. No one has ever seenanything quite like it before. The Miami-Dade Commission issued a press releasethat says:\"Miami-Dade County archaeologists have determined that prehistoric SouthFlorida Native American inhabitants known as Tequesta Indians constructed thecircle. Pottery fragments found at the site indicate that the prehistoric circle cutinto the limestone bedrock may be 2000 years old. The 38 feet in diameter circlehas numerous postholes and a carving resembling an eye on an east-westequinox alignment. Scientists speculate that it may have been a Tequesta templeor council house. Scholars who have visited the site have indicated that thearchaeological finding is unique in Florida, and possibly North America.\"Florida Everglades \"Skunk Ape\" SightingThere has been another Bigfoot sighting in the Florida Everglades this month.Down there, it's called a \"skunk ape.\" Even the Seminole Indians in the pastcentury had a phrase: eh-stee jap-jack-ee, which translates roughly as \"tall hairyman.\"This new February eyewitness doesn't want his name or voice on the record forfear of ridicule. But he called James McMullen -- a nature photographer, trackerand author -- who has researched the Florida panther for the past twenty-twoyears. His book Cry of the Panther, first published in 1984, was a New YorkTimes best seller.Mr. McMullen learned tracking skills as a U. S. Marine who fought in Vietnam.During the August 1997 Bigfoot flap in the Everglades, he tried to find physicalevidence that might prove whether the \"skunk ape\" was truly unusual or simplya mis-identification of brown bears. He was exploring north of the Big CypressPreserve when he finally had his own encounter.McMullen also talked to a farmer who had been riding his horse through aremote area called the Devil's Garden and saw a Bigfoot-type creature."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Interview:James McMullen, Nature Photographer, Author and Tracker, Big CypressPreserve, Florida: \"The farmer said, 'I saw a skunk ape, man. That's why I'mcalling you -- I saw me a skunk ape!'I said, \"Well, what did you see?\"And then he went into the dark brown coloring. He said that when it saw him, itturned toward the tree line and rapidly walked along a trail where the cowscome down to the fence line and just disappeared. And I asked, \"How long didyou see him?\"He said, \"Somewhere in the neighborhood of five to maybe seven seconds. But Isaw him! And he was big!\"He said it was seven feet tall, maybe weighed about 350 pounds.\"But it was the way he looked. He was erect, but leaning forward a little bit.\"Another thing he said was that when it turned, it saw him and he saw the side ofit and when it turned, he saw the back side of it. And he said, \"I saw thatsucker's butt.\" (laughed)I asked, \"What do you mean?\"He said, \"I saw his butt.\"And I said, \"What do you mean?\"And he said, \"There weren't no hair on it.\"That's what he saw. I asked him if he could remember anything else peculiarabout it and he said probably the way it swung its arms. And the other thing washow fast it moved when he saw the guy sitting on his horse.I said, \"How far were you from it?\"He said, \"I was pretty far away -- maybe about 75 or 80 yards. I had aninclination to chase him on the horse, but the horse wouldn't move towardshim.\"I thought that was really neat -- the horse saw it, too, and wouldn't go towardsit. I asked when he turned his back towards him, did he run?He said, \"No, but he walked so fast.\"He couldn't believe how fast he was walking. He rides over there after theBigfoot is gone and there wasn't a track in sight. He was up on that high ground,a kind of gravel trail where the cows come down. We've gotten a little rain downhere during the winter months, but not that much to where there is a mud lineout there in the pine forests.WOULDN'T YOU THINK THAT ANYTHING THAT IS AS HEAVY ASYOU HAVE ESTIMATED AND HE'S ESTIMATED WOULD LEAVESOME KIND OF TRACKS?Yeah, but he said there was nothing there that he could see. I asked him if hecould write all this down for me, but he didn't want to do that. So, I asked him ifwe could back all this up. I told him I would write all this up and give him a calland he could come over and sign it. And he didn't want to do that. He said, \"Iknow who you are. I know what you've been doing with the panther researchand I really admire you for your work. But I'm not going to get involved. I couldlose my job.\" Click.WHAT SHIFTED YOUR ATTENTION FROM THE PANTHER TOTHESE ANOMALOUS SIGHTINGS BY SEVERAL EYEWITNESSES OFTHIS PRIMATE CREATURE?On August 23rd, (1997) at 2:30 in the afternoon, daylight hours -- and over onthe right, I glanced over to the right hand side 35 feet away -- next to treesunderneath a sable palm frond was this gorilla standing there. That was the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"absolute first impression I got. Yeah, I was out looking for, tracking thephenomenon of Bigfoot. But I did not have it in my head that I would ever seeone. I saw a gorilla!LET ALONE 35 FEET AWAY.35 feet away.WHAT EXACTLY WERE YOU SEEING IN DETAIL IN THAT FACE?Well, that's the interesting part. Even though I'm a researcher and have been foralmost 23 years -- it was a very shocking event that was taking place and it wasseconds. I would say from beginning to end, it was 35 seconds. But the actualsighting of actually seeing him was 8 to 9 seconds (meaning the Bigfoot's face).But I saw him underneath the sable palm tree. I saw what I thought was a gorillastanding up right. The thing that threw me was that it was a gorilla all the waydown to the waist and then it had two long, oak tree type legs. And he wasstanding there with his arms hanging down along side him and could see hischest moving up and down, breathing very hard.WHEN YOU SAY TWO LONG OAK TREE TYPE LEGS, WHAT DOYOU MEAN?Well, backtracking a little bit. Knowing gorillas, seeing pictures of them andseeing them on the Discovery Channel -- they are huge down to the waist andsuddenly they have these little skinny bowed legs -- there is not much to theirlegs at all. Well, this particular species did not have the small bowed legs. It hadlong human like legs and both of the legs were covered with a deep, darkchocolate fur or hair on them. But they were long. They weren't short or bowed.They were long which made this species exceptionally tall.LIKE ABOUT?Well, I measured it. After the incident, I went back the next day and went towhere he was standing and measured up under the sable palm where the top ofhis head was and that went 6 feet 8 inches, conservatively. His face was back upin the shadow, but the sun was shining on the top rear of his head. It had asloped back, sort of cone-shaped head, it sloped back and you could see shortfur -- with the sun shining on it, it was lighter brown than what was on the restof the body. So, I didn't really see his face. It was all shadowed in there. I couldsee the outline, but I couldn't see his eyes and nose. I couldn't see his face.WHAT ABOUT HANDS?Well, his arms were hanging down along the side of his body, extremely longarms and hands. The fur was longer on the arms. It was a male and I say itbecause you could see his chest and there were no breasts on the chest and nohair up on his pectorals or down on his stomach. But I have to tell you that theskin was colored with kind of caramel color. It wasn't black or white. It was likecaramel. I could definitely see that.IT WAS SKIN NOT COVERED WITH HAIR?From the angle I was looking at 35 feet, him standing in shadow with a little bitof sunlight there, I could not see any hair on his pectorals or stomach, but thehair picked up at his hips and legs. Longer hair on the arms and on the body, itseemed.YOU COULD SEE THAT HAIRLESS CHEST MOVING AS IF...He was breathing hard. I could see his chest heaving. I was both fascinated atwhat I was looking at, but also frightened. I was glad I was inside the van. If Ihad been walking up through there 35 feet away, I wonder what he would havedone? And wondering after all this when I calmed down a little bit, what was hedoing there standing there to begin with? He wasn't there when I went downthere to begin with -- or at least I didn't see him standing there before. But whenI came back up, there he was standing there. He could have been back further inthe trees.MAYBE HE WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THE NOISE OF YOUR TRUCK?I'll bet you money that's right. Some people said the van would scare him off,but it didn't. It was like I was hit with an electric wire -- my whole body was in"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"super stun from it. And I panicked -- I didn't know I did it unconsciously -- myfoot hit the gas and I surged ahead and then slammed on the brake and put it inreverse and went back to where he was and he was gone.BUT DID YOU FIND ANY TRACKS?Even when I went back the next day, there were no tracks underneath the sablepalm. Where he was standing, there was high level grass -- even the next day itwas all pushed down. But there were no tracks there. So, what I did was superback track him from there. I spent the whole day out there. I didn't get one track.Not until 13 months later did I finally get a track and I can't really tell you thatthose tracks were of my sighting in the tree line.13 MONTHS LATER IS WHEN?It took me 13 months later October 18, 1998 -- I came on seven tracks near awater line -- big guys. But the problem was they were full of water and heavilydeteriorated, but you could clearly see that something had walked along thewater's edge.WAS THERE THREE TOES?I got five toes. Five toes. So, what I did was take the best of the seven prints andgot as much water out of it as I could and took a plaster caste of that one. Youcan see the 5 toes and I got the length and width. The length is roughly over 14inches and the width -- I think because it's so deteriorated and spread out -- I got8 inches across. So, it makes for a big foot.HAVE YOU, OR HAS ANYONE YOU KNOW, RECORDED ANYSOUNDS OF WHAT THEY SAY ARE THESE CREATURES?I had my brother with me one night and we got sounds. But when I say we gotsounds -- we didn't have tape recorders. We went into this area and all of asudden to the right hand side, we heard this very high pitched screech. And itwas the longest screech I have ever heard. I've never heard that sound in theEverglades -- mainly because of how long it was. I know basically all the soundsof the panther in the Everglades. And this was not a panther. And it was maybelike 75 yards away and in the tree line.My brother heard it and jumped in the van and shut the door. And as I wasopening the door to get into the van, to the left hand side over a water line --and another 80 yards away -- there was another screech, almost identical to thescreech we heard in the tree line to the right. And I got in the van and shut thedoor and we both looked at each other and said it at the same time, \"Bigfoot!\"Wait a minute -- two of them. Because one of them answered the other.\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
