Babbitt said the entire Cabinet is concerned about \"an increasingenvironmental threat showing up in unexplained declines, deformities and evendisappearances of frogs, toads and salamanders -- species that have been onEarth for 350 million years.\"Scientists are puzzled and at odds with each other about what is causing theworldwide decline in amphibians. On February 25th, a federal program waslaunched called \"Frog Force.\" The goal is to get kids everywhere to search fordeformed frogs, toads and salamanders and report them. The Frog Force WebSite is www.frogweb.gov. The best time to look for frogs is in the spring matingseason which starts after temperatures stay in the 40s at night and continues forabout two to three months after temperatures are warmer.Biologists at the U. S. Geological Survey say they want to involve young people,and all the public because the work of monitoring what's happening toamphibians is too big for that agency to do by itself.The Clinton administration wants to spend about $9 million next year to findmore answers to the mystery of disappearing and deformed amphibians. Currenttheories range from disease and parasites, to pesticides and other toxiccontaminants as well as increased UV radiation that results from the thinningozone layer. Increased UV radiation can cause genetic damage and weakenimmune systems which make the amphibians more vulnerable to disease andcontaminants.Like the multi-legged frogs, another mysterious deformity among wildlife isoccurring in Anchorage, Alaska. For the past two years, there has been adramatic increase in the number of black-capped chickadees suffering grosslydeformed beaks. And the problem is spreading to other bird species. While mostAlaska songbirds head south for the winter, chickadees survive the cold byeating a lot in the day and storing a thick fatty layer that helps keep them warmat night. Their average life span is about two years so whatever happened toproduce the grossly deformed beaks in adult chickadees might have showed upin the environment two years ago.The scientist in charge of researching this bird mystery is Colleen Handel,Research Wildlife Biologist at the U. S. Geological Survey's Alaska BiologicalScience Center in Anchorage. She talked to me this week about how she firstlearned of the chickadee abnormalities.Interview:Colleen Handel, Research Wildlife Biologist, U.S. Geological Survey'sAlaska Biological Science Center, Anchorage, Alaska: \"Approximately oneyear ago in January 1998, I had a report from a colleague of mine of a chickadee"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"with a deformed bill. In fact, she had had three birds with various types ofdeformities at her feeder here in Anchorage and was kind of puzzled by this. Iwent out and looked at the birds and they were indeed kind of strange and did alittle research.CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OFTHE ANOMALIES?Yes. Since then, the anomalies can be quite varied, after looking at severaldifferent birds and getting reports from a number of different people. But theoriginal birds I looked at all had the upper mandible -- the upper portion of thebill -- was greatly elongated. The longest was about 2.5 inches long and sharplycurved. And the lower mandible was also elongated and not curved and the billswere crossed.A QUESTION ABOUT THESE CROSSED BEAKS. CAN THE BIRDSCONTINUE TO SURVIVE AND EAT WITH THESE HUGE CROSSEDBEAKS?Well, the birds do have difficulty feeding. I think many of them are alive mainlybecause people have bird feeders.HOW MANY BIRDS IN 1999, INCLUDING THE CHICKADEES ANDEXTENDING OUT TO THESE OTHER BIRDS, WOULD YOU SAYHAVE BEEN INVOLVED SO FAR?Well, the ones that have been reported to me -- before last weekend, I had 45black capped chickadees and one downy woodpecker. And since this weekend, Ihaven't been able to call everyone back. I have been inundated with phonemessages and e-mail messages in response to the article in The Daily News. AndI estimate I've received an additional 30 reports -- maybe more -- of blackcapped chickadees mostly from this winter.GETTING UP TO 100 BIRDS RIGHT NOW.That's correct, right. That to me is an alarmingly high number. It's what onewould consider an epidemiological cluster of concern, for sure.HOW WIDE SPREAD IS THIS IN FEBRUARY OF 1999? IS IT BEYONDANCHORAGE ANYWHERE?Well, again the reports that I have received so far have been as far north as 85miles north of Anchorage and to the northeast to Sutton which is appx. 60 milesaway from Anchorage and down to the Peninsula south of Anchorage which isappx. 85 miles south of Anchorage -- I've had two reports from there.And then there is the interesting out lying cluster in King's Salmon which is acouple of hundred miles away from Anchorage. That was our earliest reportwhich was in 1991. And then again we had reports from there in 1996, 1997and 1998. So, again, there's always a possibility that there could be multiplecauses behind what we're seeing. They may or may not be related in terms of allthe sightings, but I'm at least looking for one common explanation for themajority of the sightings. It could be dietary deficiencies, disease, parasites,contaminants or least likely some genetic inherited abnormality.WHAT ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT INCREASED UVRADIATION FROM THE THINNING OZONE COULD HAVE ANEFFECT ON BIRDS JUST AS IT APPEARS THERE MAY BE ACONNECTION TO DISAPPEARING AND DEFORMINGAMPHIBIANS?That is another possibility. When you start looking at broader areas, we startlooking for broader explanations. And I start to think about airbornecontamination or UV radiation. A question that immediately springs to mind iswhy black capped chickadees and no other species. In the last few days I havereceived a few reports of other species with deformed bills in the area -- redbreasted nut hatches, black billed magpies and stellar jays and I had one reportof a downy woodpecker.IS THERE ANYTHING IN TERMS OF THE ENVIRONMENT INALASKA IN THE PAST TWO YEARS THAT MIGHT BE ATTRIBUTED"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"TO THE BIRDS FEEDING AREAS AND WHAT THEY AREINGESTING?It's a little puzzling. A lot of the sightings have been congregated in the southportion of Anchorage where there has been a heavy infestation of Sprucebeetles. Now Spruce beetle is a small insect that attacks large, mature WhiteSpruce predominantly and there's been an epidemic in this entire south centralregion of Alaska.HAS THAT BEEN RELATED TO GLOBAL WARMING?There is a hypothesis that that is true because the insects -- their life cycle isshortened during hot drier summers which we have had lately and whether ornot the weather patterns we have been seeing are related to global warming is ofcourse debated hotly, but there is definitely some tree core evidence that therehas been a global warming trend in the Arctic and that this (beetle infestation)could definitely be related.THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF OTHER THINGS -- PERMA FROSTMELTING AND THE BEETLE INFESTATION. AND HOW MIGHT ABEETLE CAUSE THESE LONGER CROSSED BEAKS IN ACHICKADEE?Well, I'm not saying there is a direct connection. There is a possible connectionfor spraying to control the insects. Some chemicals that can be used includesome organic chlorines such as Windane, and there is a possibility that suchorganic chlorines could cause this deformity. However, deformities are alsooccurring in birds 85 miles away from Anchorage where, to my knowledge, noreal concentration of spraying for this insect. So, again, it might fit for theAnchorage area as a likely or possible explanation, but does not explain verywell what's occurring in outlying areas.In conjunction with the tissue analyses we are doing, we are also looking at --there are maps of, for example, military sites or other sites known to becontaminated by various chemicals. And so we will be looking at overlaying thatmap with the map I am constructing right now of all the birds.HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE BEFORE YOU CAN STARTELIMINATING SOME POSSIBILITIES AND NARROWING DOWN TOWHAT MIGHT BE THE PROBLEM?Wel l , t h e first t h in g we are screen in g fo r is d isease. I've go t t en so me resu l t s b ackfor the first series of birds I sent in and have found no significant results in bloodchemistry which is an indicator of fighting an infectious disease.THAT SORT OF ELIMINATES DISEASE IN THOSE BIRDS.Right. And I hope our tests will show us that we have some inkling as to what isgoing on.BUT RIGHT NOW, IT''S A COMPLETE MYSTERY?Right now, it's a complete mystery. All of these hypotheses are being consideredwith equal weight. We will not rule out anything until we have evidence to doso.\"More Information:Cornell University's Laboratory of Ornithology has put the word out throughNorth America to birdwatchers to stay on the alert for beak abnormalities. Andto all our radio listeners, you can help in this bird watch, too. If you seeanything unusual you think should be reported, call Colleen Handel at herUSGS office in Anchorage.
