He wrote: \"We have been having cowmutilations here for at least the past ten or so years.\"I also received photographs of one of those mutilations that occurred on January12, 1995 from Battle Mountain rancher, Eddyann Filippini. With the photos,she wrote: \"It was very wet that day, so it looks like there is blood on theground. It was the snow and rain on the fresh cuts that pooled where she waslaying.\"Mutilated cow discovered January 12, 1995in Battle Mountain, Nevada.

The several excisions included a neat 18-inchhide-deep circle of flesh removed \"with a very sharp instrument\" where theudder had been. Rectal and vaginal tissue had also been neatly excised. The leftside of the jaw had been stripped of flesh and the tongue had been removeddeep within the throat. No tracks or signs of struggle.I called and talked with Sergeant Investigator Altemueller about the most recentheifer calf found at the Filippini's Badger Ranch on June 14, 1999. The calf waslast seen alive around 6:30 PM the evening before by the owners whose familyhave ranched in Battle Mountain since the 1940s. Sgt. Altemueller investigatedand described what he found.Interviews:1) Klaus Altemueller, Sergeant Investigator, Lander County Sheriff'sOffice, Battle Mountain, Nevada:\"This was a red heifer - just a calf not very old. When I arrived at the ranch, Ihad to go with the rancher and we went way out into the area. The injuries onthis (calf) were: the tongue had been cut out, the anus was removed and thenaval area was cut out. The naval area was cut in a perfect circle and as well theanus. There was a portion of the face removed of what was up.THE HEAD WAS LAYING UP AND THAT HALF OF THE HEAD, THESKIN OR HIDE, WAS REMOVED?Actually it was just the lower portion of the jaw. And the tongue was removed. Icouldn't tell how far back. We didn't do any further investigation on that.IN TERMS OF TRACHEA OF LARYNX?Yeah, I would have no idea. We don't have the abilities to conduct those type ofexaminations on animals.BUT THE TONGUE WAS DEFINITELY REMOVED DEEP WITHINTHE THROAT?I couldn't see any part of it. There were no tire tracks. There was no blood.There was no evidence of any type indicating any foot traffic or vehicular traffic.We have a type of soil around here. It's called the 'bug dust.' And what it is - it'sreal fine and powdery, really fine powdery dust. And when you drive over it, itleaves pretty distinct tracks. And there was nothing of that nature anywhere nearthis cow.COULD YOU FIND ANY TRACKS OF THE CALF ITSELF WHERE ITWAS LAYING?I didn't notice any. The wind had blown earlier in the morning, so it might have"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"obscured any possible tracks or anything like that. But the unusual thing wasthat this was a 2-month-old calf, so it still would have been suckling and themother cow as nowhere to be found.DID YOUR SHERIFF OFFICE ASK TO HAVE ANY KIND OFNECROPSY OR ANALYSES DONE?No, we don't even have anyone in the area that can do that. Because of theremoteness of the location and probably the state of decomposition would be sohigh, particularly in this time of the year - by the time we were even able to getsomeone out there - just the simple logistics of it. The rancher calls us. He'sseventeen miles to his ranch and another five miles out into the pasture areas.That's probably close to a 45-minute to hour project and I have to locate theanimal, come back to town. As far as I know, the nearest person who can do that(necropsy) is in Salt Lake City or Reno which is 300 miles in one direction and220 miles in the other direction.THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A FOCUS ON THESE RANCHPROPERTIES OF THE FILIPPINIS.There the only ones in the entire county and we have 5700 square miles. Andthose are the only ones that have been reported to us that I'm aware of.WHEN YOU TALK WITH OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENTINVESTIGATORS, WHAT IS THEIR COMMENT ABOUT THESEUNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHS?They say things like, 'Strange. Weird. Odd. Wonder what that is? I've heardabout those elsewhere.' But no one that I've talked to in the area as far asadjoining counties has experienced those, that I know of.AND IN YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH FELLOW LAWENFORCEMENT PEOPLE AND YOUR SHERIFF, WHEN YOU TALKABOUT WHAT THE SOURCE OF THIS COULD BE RANGING FROMGOVERNMENT POSSIBLY TO A NON-HUMAN INTELLIGENCE,WHAT IS THE DISCUSSION LIKE?Well, basically, the main gist is that we're not willing to rule anything out at thispoint because we don't have any answers. So, I don't have any personal theories.It's just really strange. And I don't have any clues. And I know it's been going onfor awhile.\"SGT. ALTEMUELLER FOUND SEVEN ANIMAL MUTILATION OFFENSEREPORTS IN THE LANDER COUNTY SHERIFF'S FILES SINCEDECEMBER 28, 1994 - ALL ON THE SAME RANCHES EIGHTEEN MILESSOUTH OF BATTLE MOUNTAIN.

SGT.ALTEMUELLER ALSO KNOWS THE FORMER SHERIFF INVESTIGATEDANIMAL MUTILATIONS ON THE FILIPPINI RANCHES IN THE 1980S.DAN'S WIFE, EDDYANN FILIPPINI, TOLD ME THERE HAVE BEENHORSE AND CATTLE MUTILATIONS THEY HAVE NOT EVENBOTHERED TO REPORT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. SHE FIGURES THECOUNT NOW IS NEARLY A DOZEN AND SHE IS PARTICULARLYPUZZLED BY THE LACK OF BLOOD AND ODD REACTIONS OFNATURAL PREDATORS TO THE MUTILATED ANIMALS ON THEIRRANCHES.2) Eddyann Filippini, wife of Dan Filippini, Owners of Badger and ChiariRanches, Battle Mountain, Nevada: \"There's no blood and no signs ofstruggle. No tracks. The predators, coyotes or birds, won't even eat them. Thebirds will land on them and poop on them, but they won't eat them. And it willtake probably months before - say, like the crows. The coyotes never do. Theywon't touch them.IN TERMS OF A NECROPSY, DID YOU CALL ANY VETERINARIANTO COME OUT ON THAT ONE?No, we haven't called any vets. We just called the sheriff so it's documented. Butno veterinarians."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"IS IT THE ISSUE OF MONEY?No, not really. We don't live in a place - where like a veterinarian, the closestone is seventy miles. So, for them to come and do it, wouldn't be - well, we justnever thought about it. But, no it's not a question of money. It's just somethingwe never thought about.BUT IT'S A BIG DEAL TO GET A VET OUT THERE IN THE FIRSTPLACE?Sure, it is. It's a big deal for an emergency to get a vet out here.DO YOU HAVE PHOTOGRAPHS ON ALL THE MUTILATIONS ONYOUR RANCH?No. I have photographs of one of the first one that we had.WHICH IS WHAT YEAR?Oh, man, it's been probably four years ago. And she - it happened in the winter,too - I remember that very distinctly because it was so muddy that you couldhardly, you couldn't get off the road. Even the gravel road. If you stepped on tothe shoulder of the road, you would get stuck or sink clear to your knees. Andwe went to feed there and there was, she was laying right under a power line.And it's right next to the feed grounds. She was mutilated. But there was notracks and it was so muddy, we just thought, 'Whoooah, this is weird!'THERE WERE NO TRACKS, EVEN IN THE MUD?There was no tracks in the mud. And my father-in-law had a bull a few yearsago. And it was so dusty, you could sink clear to your ankles in the dust andthere was no tracks.MEANING THAT YOUR, MR. HANK FILIPPINI, HAD A MUTILATIONOF A BULL AND THE BULL WAS FOUND IN DUST AND THEREWERE NO TRACKS.No tracks, no tracks.WHEN YOU SEE GROUND LIKE THAT WITH NO TRACKS WITH AMUTILATED ANIMAL LAYING IN THE MIDDLE, WHAT GOESTHROUGH YOUR MIND?The thing that really bothers me. I say this is open space. We run miles and milesof range, twenty or thirty miles. And there are cows all over it. Why would youpick a cow out of a pasture and then put it back? And who knows - we knowour cow because it's identified with brands and marks. But that cow could havebeen taken from somewhere else and put there.THE VERY FACT THAT RANCHERS HAVE SAID THIS EXACTTHING OVER FORTY YEARS - WHY IS THE ANIMAL PUT BACK TOBE FOUND? - HAS BEEN PART OF THE HIGH STRANGENESSASSOCIATED WITH THESE UNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHS THATWHEN COMBINED WITH SOME OF THE EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTSHAS CIRCUMSTANTIALLY LINKED ANIMAL MUTILATIONS TOTHE PRESENCE OF AN ALIEN LIFE FORM.Well, there's no blood. And there's no body fluid draining out. There's not likemost animals die, they urinate or they poop. And there's not that. There's noblood. There's no blood around the incisions. All of the cuts are perfect.Nobody could do that on a loose skinned animal and make a perfectly roundcircle. It has to be done with a laser, but you don't see burns. You don't see likesomething that had been seared. That's not visible on a fresh mutilation. And thefact that predators won't go around them is odd. They sense something andwon't eat it. Like a crow will eat anything! Heck, if I laid down in the road, he'deat me in a minute! But they won't even touch those (mutilations). They willland on them, but they won't eat them. They won't even peck their eyes out.That's strange. That sounds gory, but predators will eat whatever.YOU ARE USED TO RANCHING AND SEEING THE NORMAL KINDSOF DEATHS ON A RANCH AND WHAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING ISTHAT THESE UNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHS REALLY STAND OUT AS"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"BEING STRANGE.Yeah, sure. You might not find them for a day or so and they are still there andthey're not eaten. The cuts are still real visible and real round and perfect. Andthe things that are missing like the udder, they take the skin off their jaw, theytake the sexual organs. Like with the bull, they'll take the whole strip, the wholecord to the penis and the testicles and it's all round. And in the cow they takethe vagina and rectum. That's what I found is odd. Why would they take? Butwe never had an autopsy to see if any internal organs are gone.THERE HAVE BEEN MISSING ORGANS WHEN NECROPSIES HAVEBEEN DONE.Really?YES.Like what?HEARTS HAVE BEEN REMOVED INSIDE OF PERICARDIUM WITHTHE PERICARDIUM AROUND THE HEART STILL INTACT. EIGHTINCHES OF TRACHEA AND ESOPHAGUS HAVE BEEN REMOVED INSEVERAL ANIMALS. THE BLADDER HAS BEEN COMPLETELYREMOVED FROM SOME ANIMALS.With no external incisions.NO EXTERNAL EXCISIONS IN TERMS OF THE BLADDER OR THEHEART.Yeah, pretty odd. But I just say, 'It's our government out to get us. They'repracticing on us.' The only people I know who would be that low would be theU. S. government to do something that humiliating and awful to an animal.BUT THEY MAY BE TRYING TO COPE WITH THIS AS WELL ANDNOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO IF IT IS IN FACT AN ALIEN LIFEFORM, WHAT CAN THEY DO TO STOP IT? CLEARLYMUTILATIONS HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR OVER 40 YEARSWITHOUT ANYONE BEING ABLE TO STOP IT.Oh, no. I don't know. The one police officer who came here - he was prettygreen, greener than grass. And he was saying something about a satanic cult wasdoing this. And like we're going, 'There are no tracks.' If there was a bunch ofstupid kids, there would be blood and guts and just chewed up like you can'tbelieve. This was a little too professional for a bunch of cult things.\" More Information:Then last month in South Dakota on August 5th, an 1,800 pound bull wasfound laying on a barbwire fence dead and mutilated as if lowered chest firststraight down onto the sharp wire that penetrated into the hide without cuts ortears . The bull belonged to Milo and Marilee Hauck in Menno, a ranchingcommunity in Hutchinson County. The testicles and scrotum were removed in aneat, oval cut, but the penile tissue was laying along one leg, pulled through thesheath while still connected to tissue inside the abdomen.A week later, on Tuesday, August 10th, a cow was found dead and mutilated onthe Mark and Cindy Ulmer ranch next door. The cow's vagina and rectal tissuewere removed in a U-shaped cut. The lips and tongue were also gone. Again, noblood, no tracks. Several days later, four different Menno residents reportedlarge, white lights hovering or moving silently.
