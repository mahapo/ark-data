The impact of Hurricane Floyddominated the discussion. Dr. Hans Paerl, a marine scientist at the University ofNorth Carolina said, \"What we're seeing is an ecological event on thecatastrophic scale.\"Hurricane Floyd dumped twenty inches of rain on eastern North Carolina onSeptember 16th. The water killed about fifty people as it filled the river basinsto overflowing. The flood waters tore through houses, hog lagoons and sewerplants that had been constructed along the Neuse and Tar Rivers. Everythingwas dumped into Albemarle-Pamlico Sounds, the second largest estuary in theUnited States.Dr. Paerl said the human and animal waste flowing into Albemarle-PamlicoSounds is now laying on top of the salt water like a blanket, suffocating marinelife as it robs the water of oxygen and salt.These are the same estuary waters that the fish-eating dinoflagellate, Pfiesteria,has infested and scientists are now worried that this flood of human and animalwaste along with pesticides and fertilizers will set up the perfect conditions forthe plant/animal algae to thrive next year and beyond.This weekend I talked to the Neuse River Keeper, Rick Dove. He has beenworking with the Neuse River Foundation trying to sustain the estuary andfishing industries against the onslaught of uncontrolled industrial and residentialdevelopment in flood plains where no farms and houses should ever have beenallowed in the first place.Interview:Rick Dove, Neuse River Keeper, New Bern, North Carolina: \"The first timewe flew was right after the rains had stopped. It was the 17th of September. Andwhen I got up in the air, I expected to find what we had seen on two otheroccasions when the Neuse had flooded her banks back after Hurricane Franback in 1996 and again in the winter rains of 1998. But I never, ever expected tosee what was out there! The first feelings I had when I began to look at it werejust feelings of absolute anger. And then frustration and then finally I just turnedto shooting pictures and videos because there was just nothing else to do. But itwas terrible!Everywhere we flew, the flood waters had washed over these huge hog lagoonsand chicken houses, turkey houses. These lagoons they are open cesspools.They call them \"lagoons,\" but they are open cesspools. They store months andmonths worth of raw animal waste. I mean millions and millions and millions ofgallons. They had all gotten washed out and the flood waters had inundated the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"cesspools and the barns. Some of the waters were up to the roof tops of thebarns. The animals were still inside.Photograph © 1999 by Rick Dove of Hurricane Floyd floodwaters lapping at hog barn roof tops, Neuse River flood plain.WITH ALL OF THIS ANIMAL FECES FLOATING IN THE WATER?Oh, you can see it. If you take a look at our web site,http://www.neuseriver.com, you'll actually see pictures of exactly what I'vedescribed, and the audience is welcome to take a look at those pictures. Andthere were sewage treatment plants that were under water. You could see theraw sewage being discharged. Junk yards that were under water with gas and oiland antifreeze and what have you just washing down the river. It was a terrible,terrible sight.And you know, our governor said, \"Gee whiz, this is a one in five hundred yearflood. There is nothing we could have done.\" That's not correct. You know, wehad located all of these hazardous materials in the flood plain. I mean, ourforefathers called it a flood plain for a reason because that's where Nature voidsthe water when it comes in with these storms.YET THE STATE HAD ALLOWED THE SWINE FARMS AND ALL OFTHIS TO GROW RIGHT ALONG INSIDE THE FLOOD PLAIN.They did. And they can't say we didn't tell them that this was coming. We hadseen, as I said earlier, on two other occasions in the recent past. And each time,we sent them video and complained that while this wasn't a major floodingevent, that one would surely come and it would be much worse. So, they wereon notice that this was going to happen!SO WE GET HURRICANE FLOYD AND WHAT EXACTLY IS THESTATUS NOW OF THE ESTUARIES AND WHAT THEY'RE SAYINGARE DEAD ZONES IN THE OCEAN OFF THE COAST OF NORTHCAROLINA?Well, I don't know that the dead zones are in the ocean yet, but the Neuse Riverand the Tar-Pamlico River and the Chowan, Roanoke and Alligator they alldrain into the Albemarle-Pamlico Sound. The Albemarle-Pamlico Sound is thesecond largest estuary in the country and the number one fish nursery in thecountry. Very, very valuable resource for fish nurseries for fish that go up anddown the coast. That Albemarle-Pamlico Sound is dammed in by the OuterBanks, so when these flood waters came over these lagoons and sprayed fieldsand barns and waste water treatment plants and junk yards, it didn't flush to theocean. It went down to the Albemarle-Pamlico Sound and it got trapped there.And this very, very important resource is now very seriously threatened with allof this we call it \"muck\" it's a witch's brew of all this terrible stuff!PESTICIDES AND FERTILIZERS, ANIMAL AND HUMAN FECES.All of that is in there. And you can see it. When we watched it come"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"downstream, it came down as a pinkish-brown color. And we could actuallywatch it moving downstream and then when it got to New Bern and went underthe new Neuse River Bridge, you could see the normal color of the river on eachof the sides of the river and this muck was coming down the center of the riverand you could watch it. And it went all the way out to the Albemarle-PamlicoSound. And you can actually see it even today while boats operate on the water,you can see them churning through this brown muck.Photograph © 1999 by Rick Dove taken October 3, 1999 as floodwaters loadedwith pollution make their way past Johnson Point on the south shore of the Neuse Riverbelow New Bern. The normally clear water is blue along the shore in contrast to thepolluted thick, brown muck in the middle.THE DEAD ZONE THEN IS STILL INSIDE THE ESTUARYBOUNDARY?Yeah, and it's not a complete dead zone. What the scientists are saying Dr. Paerland scientists from Duke University. Dr. Joanne Burkholder has been down withher crew and what they are all saying is that it's in the process of happening thatthe oxygen levels are dropping and the very same thing that they saw cominginto the Gulf from the flooding of the Mississippi is starting to happen out there.The fish are starting to be effected. The oxygen levels are dropping. In fairness,we don't really know how bad it will be because the river can only answer thatquestion. And the Sounds can only answer that question. There is nothing wecan do now except just get out there and look at it and document what's aboutto happen.YOU HOPE THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE INTHE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA WILL TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.You know, Linda, that is the only good thing that can come out of this. There'sbeen terrible suffering here in North Carolina. People have died, lost theirhouses not just their houses and money and things but they have lost theirfamily photo albums. They have lost everything! And the only good thing thatcan come out of this is if we learn from this to never let this happen again. Weknow the flood waters are coming again because we get hurricanes. We knowthat. But to get all of these bad things out of the flood plain and we can DOthat. And if we don't, then shame on us.HOW DO YOU THINK ALL OF THIS WILL RELATE TO WHATHAPPENS WITH PFIESTERIA WHICH, I GUESS, THE WHOLECYCLE WAS INTERRUPTED ACTUALLY BY THE HURRICANE.HOW DO YOU PROJECT INTO THE NEXT YEAR INTO 2000? WHATDO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN WITH PFIESTERIA?Well, we've got so many nutrients washed down here that the short term effectsof this will be measured from one to five years. Long term effects will probablybe measured over the next century. But for Pfiesteria, when we get all this freshwater, it typically pushes Pfiesteria out towards the Sounds and then it takesPfiesteria awhile to react to the nutrients and then to bloom back up into theparts of the estuary. So, probably over the next one to three years all thesenutrients are going to promote the growth of the Pfiesteria. And we'll just haveto wait to see what the river says about all that. I'm not optimistic.SO, IT'S A KIND OF CONFUSING SITUATION WITH ALL OF THERAIN AND THE HURRICANE STIRRING THINGS UP, EVEN"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THOUGH THERE IS THIS MASSIVE DISCHARGE OF ANIMAL,FERTILIZER, HUMAN WASTE AND PESTICIDES INTO THE RIVERSAND ESTUARIES, IT IS SO MUCH IN TURMOIL THAT IT ISDIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHAT WILL HAPPEN?That's exactly right. And I think anybody who does predict is making a badmistake. We just simply need to wait to see what the river has to say about allthis and what the Sounds have to say. We know it's catastrophic! I mean, there'sno way we're going to come away from this without serious problems for theestuary. But what are they? When will they appear? And how long will it takeNature to react to this event? That's what we don't know, Linda.The Governor and others have called this a one in five hundred year event, likewe're not going to see it for another five hundred years. That's nonsense. Wehave changed the landscape in North Carolina, especially in the flood plain. Wehave cut down the forests, we've cut down the buffers, we've filled about 50% ofthe wetlands which act as sponges, these forests and wetlands are sponges. Andin their place, we have built shopping centers and houses and parking lots androads and all these impervious surfaces. So, when Mother Nature rolled in herethis time with this storm and dropped this rain, she didn't recognize thelandscape anymore. And all this water rushed to the river and the river is evenmore shallow than it used to be for all the mud we've put into it throughdevelopment, the sediments, so when this water had nowhere to go but the river,the river became flatter and wider and it flooded a much larger area.So, it's a mistake to think it's going to be another five hundred years before wesee this again. Whenever we get this rain event again which typically wouldcome in with hurricanes, we're likely to see the very same thing. So, it'simportant for us to learn from this lesson and to not fill anymore wetlands or cutdown any more forests and put in all these impervious surfaces. And especiallynot to put all these bad, harmful things like these cesspools and things in theflood plain.AND SWINE FARMS.Yes, absolutely. They've got to come out. These intensive livestock operations they've got to come out of the flood plain along with these waste watertreatment plants, these junk yards and these chemical factories, and all the rest.Photograph © 1999 by Rick Dove, drowned swine along Neuse River.IF THEY DID, IT MIGHT ACTUALLY BEGIN TO SOLVE THEPFIESTERIA PROBLEM.Absolutely. It would help a lot. We need to restore the wetlands, not justprotect what we've got. We've got to restore the wetlands that used to be there.And in the place of those wetlands (right now) there are a lot of these activities Ijust named.RIGHT. AND SO FAR, HAS THE GOVERNOR MADE ANY COMMENTABOUT GETTING BEHIND AN ACTUAL HUGE CHANGE ONRESTRICTING THE WETLANDS FROM HUMAN AND ANIMALHABITATION?Yes, we're very encouraged with some of the statements that Governor Hunt hasmade. His proposal to Congress for federal aid right now is based on getting alot of these activities out of the flood plain. But the talk is cheap, the action isexpensive. We need to make sure that we follow through on this. Everybody in"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"North Carolina is in favor of the aid to help the farmers and the livestockproducers and even the people who own the junkyards and everything else, andthe people who lost their houses. We want as much help as we can get for ourcitizens. But that help has to come in the right way so we don't repeat thesemistakes. We've got to get these polluting activities out of the flood plain.FOR NORTH CAROLINA RESIDENTS WHO ARE LISTENING TOTHIS PROGRAM AND THEY WANT TO MAKE THEIR VOICESKNOWN TO THE GOVERNMENT IN NORTH CAROLINA, WHAT ISTHE BEST THING FOR THEM TO DO?To contact their representatives, the state representatives and their federalrepresentatives and the governor and let them know their feelings what theythink is important and what they want.\"More Information:The Neuse River Foundation phone number is: 252-637-7972.
