That's a small farmcommunity about 30 miles southeast of St. Louis, Missouri. Residents noticedthe birds were not moving and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources wasnotified. Their agents got into the fields to collect birds for analyses. Agentsreported that all the birds - mostly male red-winged blackbirds, some gracklesand other blackbirds - had their wings outstretched, laying tilted to one sidewith their beaks sticking straight down into the soil.Male Red-winged Blackbird Agelaius phoenicus© 1993 Kirtley Perkins.As of October 21, 1999 the official count was 27,000 birds dead over twentyacres and the cause was declared deliberate poisoning of seed grain with theinsecticide, Furadan. A reporter and photographer from the Belleville IllinoisNews Democrat got to the fields before all the birds had been picked up. I talkedwith Tim Vizer who is the newspaper's Chief Photographer about his assignmentto Mascoutah.Interview:Tim Vizer, Chief Photographer, Belleville Illinois News Democrat,Belleville, Illinois: \"There were birds scattered, primarily red-wingedblackbirds, scattered all over the ground, this wheat field, as far as the eye couldsee. Now they weren't piled up, but you couldn't walk through the field withouthaving to really watch where you were. In fact, we weren't allowed to walkthrough the field. There were two Conservation officers there, one under cover.And they discouraged us from walking through the field just in case there wassomething toxic out there. They didn't want us tracking on our shoes. But if aperson were to walk through the field, you would have to watch your step, that'show thick the birds were.YOU WERE LOOKING AT RED-WINGED BLACKBIRDS THIS BEAUTIFUL"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"BIRD THAT'S ON THE FEDERAL REGISTRY OF PROTECTED SPECIES WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND?I like all animals and I like to photograph animals. It bothered me to see thismany dead birds. I had photographed red-winged blackbirds before. I have donephoto stories of animals and nature scenes in the area. And it really just wasshocking to see this many birds at one time all dead.\" Deliberate Use of Insecticide to Kill Birds?YESTERDAY, OCTOBER 20TH, THE ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OFNATURAL RESOURCES RECEIVED THE LAB ANALYSES FROM THEBIRD NECROPSIES THAT CONFIRMED CAUSE OF DEATH WASINGESTION OF A DANGEROUS INSECTICIDE USED TO CONTROLALFALFA WEEVIL, SO DANGEROUS THAT USERS ARE REQUIRED TOGET A LICENSE FROM THE DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE BEFORE USINGTHE STRICTLY CONTROLLED POISON. THE FARMLAND IS OWNED BYHARVEY AND MARILYN CULLI WHO HAVE REFUSED SO FAR TO TALKTO THE MEDIA.JOE KAYOTT IN THE PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICE AT THE ILLINOISNATURAL RESOURCES DEPARTMENT IN SPRINGFIELD TALKED WITHME ABOUT THEIR CONCLUSION THAT THE INSECTICIDE WASDELIBERATELY USED TO KILL BIRDS.Joe Kayott, Public Information Officer, Illinois Natural ResourcesDepartment, Springfield, Illinois: \"It appears now that it was a commonlyused agriculture insecticide called Furadan that was purposely applied to somegrain that was then spread in the field apparently for the sole purpose ofeliminating a population of black birds that were perceived by at least some oneto be a nuisance. The Animal Disease Laboratory in Centralia, Illinois where thedead birds have been taken for tests has confirmed the use of the insecticide, orat least that the birds had in fact ingested grain that had been treated with thatinsecticide. We're continuing the investigation working jointly with the U. S.Fish and Wildlife Service and the Attorney General's Office here in Illinois. Andthe land owner is cooperating in the investigation.IS THE LAND OWNER THE ONE RESPONSIBLE?The investigation continues. But again this was not simply something that wasapplied as a standard operating procedure or used as properly labeled. This wasdone specifically. The grain was specifically and purposely contaminated for thesole purpose of killing the birds.WHAT IS THE PENALTY FOR POISONING WILDLIFE IN SUCH AHUGE NUMBER?You know what, until they complete the investigation and we know exactly whatthe charges are, we can't speculate on penalties. However, I can tell you of the25,000 birds that have been killed 80% of them have been red-wingedblackbirds which is a migratory species that are federally protected. So the Fishand Wildlife Service has intense interest in this. It's truly a terrible situation.Boggles the mind!IF YOU WERE GOING TO ESTIMATE HOW LONG IT'S GOING TOBE BEFORE THEY DO SOMETHING HERE IN FILING CHARGES?I asked that very question this morning and they wanted to assure me that nowthey know the cause, they want to take their time and do a very thoroughinvestigation and make sure they don't leave any stones unturned and make surethey have all the evidence they need to pursue whatever is necessary. They aregoing to be very patient and make sure they do it right.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"THE INSECTICIDE FURADAN COMES WITH PAGES OF WARNINGS ANDINSTRUCTIONS THAT CAUTION HOW TO COVER UP SKIN AND USE ADUST/MIST FILTERING RESPIRATOR.

Some eyewitnesses reported seeing gullsliterally fall out of the sky while flying and land dead in the water. Othersdescribed birds that weren't able to walk or fly and were just sitting on theground as if in a stupor. I asked Harry Leslie, Park Operations Manager forPresque Isle State Park, how many dead gulls they have been finding on aweekly basis?Great Black-backed Gull Larus Marinus © 1999 by Martin Reid.Ring-billed Gulls Larus delawarensis © 1998 by Marin Reid.Harry Leslie, Park Operations Manager, Presque Isle State Park, Erie,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Pennsylvania: \"Last Saturday, October 9th, we collected 27 birds. And thenlast Friday, October 15th, we collected 24 on the same shoreline that wecollected just the week prior to that. So, it doesn't appear that the numbers aregetting greater or less. It seems to be fairly consistent. Again, to reiterate, allthese birds we're collecting are along the surf zone of the shoreline of thepeninsula which are indicating that they are either coming down and dying rightin that area, or washing ashore along in that area as we stick out into Lake Erieby seven miles.SINCE THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE JULY, IT SOUNDS AS IFTHE NUMBERS INCREASED AND HAVE BEEN REMAININGSTEADY ON A WEEKLY BASIS, SUGGESTING THAT WHATEVER ITIS, IS STILL PRESENT AND AFFECTING BIRDS ON A FRESH BASIS?Yeah, that information is being relayed not only to the Wildlife Center, but alsoto the investigating agencies that are looking into this. In Pennsylvania, it's thePennsylvania Game Commission. You're exactly right - those numbers - there aresome collection differences between how we did it initially and how we're doingit now. But at least over the recent haul the last three weeks, the numbers seemto be fairly consistent.AMONG YOUR PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE IN THEVARIOUS AGENCIES, WHAT HAS BEEN THE SPECULATION ANDCONCERN ABOUT WHAT COULD BE HAPPENING?Obviously, the first thing we're looking at, especially with this report that's beenwritten to us, is there any source of contamination that can be identifiedanywhere? Investigations are going on within the immediate vicinity of thosetype of things as well as continuing to send in specimens as requested by theWildlife Center and to see if there is any more information that can be identifiedthrough their testing.IS IT TRUE ALSO THAT BLOOD HAS BEEN COMING FROM THEIRMOUTHS?That's one of the signs we've had that they were bleeding internally and that wasrelayed to the lab.\" Lab Analysis of Dead GullsI DID TALK WITH A BIOLOGIST AND WILDLIFE DISEASE SPECIALISTAT THE NATIONAL WILDLIFE HEALTH CENTER IN MADISON,WISCONSIN. KATHRYN CONVERSE HAS WORKED AT THE HIGHLYRESPECTED LAB SINCE RECEIVING HER PH.D. IN FISHERIES ANDWILDLIFE BIOLOGY IN 1985 FROM THE UNIVERSITY OFMASSACHUSETTS. DR. CONVERSE EXPLAINED THAT SINCE THE SEAGULL DEATHS STARTED AT THE END OF JULY LIKE THE DOZENS OFCROWS THAT DIED FROM WEST NILE FEVER VIRUS INCONNECTICUT, NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY HER LAB IS ALSOCOORDINATING WITH THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL TO TESTTHE GULLS FOR ANY EVIDENCE OF WEST NILE VIRUS. DR.CONVERSE WAS INVOLVED IN NEW YORK DOING BLOOD WORK ONWEST NILE AFFECTED CROWS.THE NEW YORK STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT SAID ON OCTOBER15TH THAT TWO MORE CASES OF WEST NILE FEVER VIRUS HADBEEN CONFIRMED IN A CUCKOO BIRD AND A CROW FOUND DEADNORTH OF ALBANY, NEW YORK. DR. CONVERSE DOUBTS THAT THEGULLS ARE INFECTED WITH THE VIRUS, BUT EXPLAINED THE NEEDTO TEST FOR IT ANYWAY."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Kathryn Converse, Ph.D., Wildlife Disease Specialist, National WildlifeHealth Center, U. S. Geological Survey, Madison, Wisconsin: \"From theones we have in, we have some tests pending, but what we're doing first on thembecause they're from Pennsylvania and because of the work that's been going onwith the West Nile Virus.THAT WAS ONE OF MY QUESTIONS.We're running virus isolation on them so at this point the other types of labanalyses are somewhat on hold until we finish and get the results of that. And assoon as we get a positive or a negative on the West Nile Virus we're expecting toget a negative but we want to clear that first. And once we've gotten a negativeon West Nile, we'll continue with other tests just because we don't want to besending West Nile Virus tissues all over the place.IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THESE SYMPTOMS OF THEHEMORRHAGING THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH ANYKNOWLEDGE KNOWN ABOUT BIRDS CONTRACTINGSOMETHING LIKE WEST NILE FEVER VIRUS?No, at this point we haven't seen any changes in the birds that would indicatethat it is West Nile Virus. This is more of a rule out that just because mortality isgoing on and it is in Pennsylvania which is certainly near enough to the NewYork area. At this point we don't have confirmation of West Nile Virus in anygu l l s.I TALKED YESTERDAY WITH THE PARK SUPERINTENDENT ATPRESQUE ISLE STATE PARK, HARRY LESLIE. HE SAID THAT AS OFYESTERDAY THE COUNT ON THE GULLS THEY HAD BROUGHT INFROM THEIR SURF ZONE WAS OVER 207. THEY ARE NOW GOING OUTAND COLLECTING EVERY FEW DAYS. THE COUNT HASN'T GONEDOWN AND IT HASN'T GONE UP, BUT IT'S REMAINING ON A STEADYDEATHDOES THAT SUGGEST THAT WHATEVER IS THERE, IS STILLPRESENT?There is some concern which has been expressed to us from within the field andone of the things that we will be ruling out on the birds is the possibility of thembeing exposed to a rodenticide. And this is because we have been seeing anunusual amount of hemorrhaging in the birds that does not seem to beassociated with any type of injury or trauma.RODENTICIDE WOULD BE WHAT?Rodenticides are compounds that are primarily used to remove rodents whenthere is a problem with rodents. And usually it's a compound and one of the sideeffects of the compounds used for rodenticide is hemorrhage. There is bloodthinning.THIS WOULD SUGGEST THAT THIS POISON MIGHT BE ACTUALLYIN THE WATER IN LAKE ERIE IN A QUANTITY HIGH ENOUGH TOKILL THESE GULLS?No, it wouldn't be in the water. The thought would be if in fact that's what'soccurring, it would be a non-target species. It would be more a type of poisoningwhere the gulls would not be the intended target, but because gulls have atendency to feed in land filled areas and other types of places that might have arodent control problem, the gulls could have possibly been either catching oreating rodents that have ingested the rodenticide, so it would be a secondarypoisoning. Or they may be attracted to whatever the bait is used to make therodenticide available to the rodents.COULD YOU COMMENT ON WHAT I UNDERSTAND WERE SOMETURQUOISE-COLORED SPECKS FOUND IN THE STOMACHS OF"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"SOME OF THE GULLS THAT WERE ANALYZED AT YOUR LAB?There are several different pesticides and there is apparently at least onerodenticide that does have that color. The coloring is used primarily to identifyif you have seeds that have been treated. The color is present and indicates thatthe treatment is there. It's not part of the specific chemical compound actually.It's color that's been added, so it's not a very definite way of defining what thecompound would have been.BUT IT SORT OF GIVES YOU A QUICK HEADS UP WHEN YOU GOINTO STOMACH OR INTESTINAL CONTENT AND FIND THIS KINDOF SPECK?Sure. In the past in other cases, we've often found purple specks or blue specksor gold specks - colors that are not naturally occurring foods or naturallyoccurring within any animal, it is of course recorded as one of the things that wewould flag for further investigation.IN YOUR YEARS OF WORKING AT THE NATIONAL WILDLIFECENTER, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE THIS INTHE GULL POPULATION OR OTHER BIRD POPULATION THEHEMORRHAGING AND THIS SORT OF STEADY SUSTAINEDDEATHS LIKE THIS?I haven't particularly seen a situation with rodenticide in gulls with this highnumber of birds affected. I have seen rodenticide in Canada geese.DO THEY HEMORRHAGE AND BLEED OUT OF THEIR MOUTHS ASWELL?That's one of the indications - hemorrhage that's present with no indication as towhy it's occurring. In other words, there are no cuts or bruises or trauma, buthemorrhage is present. That is an indication that in that animal for some reasonits blood was not clotting properly, either because of some underlying conditionor because it had ingested a medication that caused that.IS THAT A COMMON SIDE AFFECT OF POISONING BYPESTICIDES, BLEEDING FROM THE MOUTH?No, it is more commonly seen with rodenticides.HAS THERE BEEN ANY SIMILARITY IN NECROPSY FINDINGSBETWEEN THE CROWS AFFECTED BY WEST NILE FEVER VIRUSAND THE LAKE ERIE GULLS?The main finding in the birds that we received that appear to be positive for WestNile Virus is that they have enlarged, very large spleens. Other than that, therereally haven't been any characteristic findings that we see when we examine thebirds internally. Most of the changes that confirm that it appears to be a virusare changes that we see microscopically in the tissues - brain, liver, spleen. Thefindings for West Nile Virus are more microscopic, rather than what you can seegrossly with the naked eye.COULD YOU SEE ANY ENLARGEMENTS IN THE SPLEENS OF THEGULLS FROM ERIE?I looked quickly through the three cases we have on-going at this point and Ihaven't seen - the statements are that the spleens are within normal limits for sizeand shape. So basically, the reason for testing the gulls has been based on theproximity of the area in which the mortality is occurring to New York and NewJersey.THE FACT THAT THE CROW AND CUCKOO WERE FOUND ANDREPORTED OCTOBER 15TH NORTH OF ALBANY?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The fact that there have been some observations by people that the gulls wereshowing some clinical signs of neurological changes. Many times if you have abird that is very ill, especially if you have a bird that's near death, you'll oftensee what appears to be neurological changes and they are more associated withthe fact that the animal is dying.\"More Information:By the end of October, Dr. Converse hopes to have the results of both the WestNile Fever Virus and avian botulism tests. She expects to confirm a rodenticideas cause of death, or another toxin. But where IS the source of the toxin? That'swhat the Pennsylvania Game Commission and other authorities are trying to findout.In Mascoutah, Illinois, the poisonous contamination of the fields might be soextensive that other migrating birds such as Canadian Geese could be affected aswell. Already there are reports that red-tail hawks, owls, coyotes, possum andraccoon have been found sick in the area. The next step is expected to be federallegal action against the people responsible for the illegally baited killing fields.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
