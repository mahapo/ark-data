It wasearly Monday morning, June 7th at about 12:15 AM. This is the first formationin Holland this year. A 19-year-old named Robert woke up and felt compelledto look out his bedroom window. What happened next was phoned to me byNancy Talbott, Director of the BLT Crop Circle Research Team in Cambridge,Massachusetts. Nancy has worked with biophysicist W. C. Levengood inMichigan for the past several years to analyze plants from formations in Europe,Israel, Australia, Canada and the United States.Levengood hypothesizes that plants in some sampled formations were affectedby a spinning plasma vortex that contains microwave energies. The microwavesheat plant cells, softening and collapsing the stems into the fluid patterns wehave come to associate with genuinely mysterious formations. But Levengooddoes not know the source of the spinning plasma vortex. This eyewitness inHolland has now seen two different phenomena associated with the creation offresh formations which suggests there might be different mechanisms fordifferent patterns.Interview:Nancy Talbott, Director, BLT Crop Circle Research, Cambridge,Massachusetts: \"This is in southern Holland - and it's concerning again thisboy, Robert, who has the ability somehow to know when these things are gettingready to happen and who has been in the middle of a formation when itoccurred - this was a couple of years ago. And subsequently, there has been alot of crop circle activity around where he lives. And Sunday night - actually forseveral days - the entire weekend, he was having these anxiety feelings that hegets, pacing back and forth, feeling unwell physically which is a phenomenonthat occurs prior to one of these situations. And his parents insisted that he go tobed finally Sunday evening, which he did. They in fact checked on him beforethey went to bed and he was sound asleepBut what happened is that at 12:15, he woke up and knew to go to the window.He opened the curtains and looked out. His window overlooks this little gardenout back and this huge farm field which is directly behind their garden. Andwhat he saw is just incredible! He describes a small, misty, pinkish-purple light -not a sphere, more football shaped - and a little bit smaller than a football,which was coming in over the field at a height of about 10 feet, maybe 12 feetover the field from quite a distance away. It's quite an enormous field. Hewatched it as it came closer and closer and closer to this spot that is about 50meters behind his house. And this is where one of the snow circles occurred acouple of years ago. There was a circle in mustard seed there last spring. He'shad a couple of circles in other crops in that general area. Came right back tothis area and stopped - the word he used was \"hanging\" - just stopped in the air"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"and hung over this spot. Then, it started to elongate, spread out is the easiestway to describe it - and it apparently spread out and spread out becomingthinner and thinner looking like a disc, was then how he described it.When it was about 30 feet in diameter, again, still hanging there - not moving atall except for this expanding motion - then he observed what he calls (Nancymakes sh, sh, sh sound) in Dutch for electrical discharge. He and I have thesesignals we give back and forth because he doesn't speak English too well and Idon't speak Dutch at all. And what he means is that he watched electricaldischarges coming from the underside of this disc-shaped, misty, pinkish-purplecloud or ball of light for - I would gather - it sounded like six or seven, eight,maybe ten seconds immediately over the field.Then the light phenomenon simply dissipated, was gone. He was very excited,threw on some clothes and went running out the back and squeaked through thehedge and into the field and lo' and behold, right smack where that thing hadbeen was a 30 foot diameter circle - I think it's wheat. They say grain and I'm notsure which kind of grain they mean. And a 10 foot circle very near by, both ofwhich had not been there at 10 o'clock PM when he went to bed. It's still lightin Holland at 10 and you can see out whether it was there and it wasn't. Andhere they were.DID IT DISAPPEAR, FADE OUT OR WHAT?As best as I could get it, the electrical activity stopped and then it just likePOOF!WHAT''S THE TIME LAPSE BETWEEN THAT POOFING OUT ANDTHEIR DISCOVERING THE CIRCLES?Well, he went immediately - he literally took about five minutes to throw onsome clothes. He was in the field within 10 minutes, I would say, and there itwas. He said he could see it from his window after this light had gone. He couldsee there was at least one circle, and he thought there were two - and they werein fact there. And it looks like the whole situation - as it was coming in fromway in the distance - that might have taken a minute or so to get up near hiswindows. But once it was there, everything that happened subsequently didn'ttake longer than another minute - the spreading out and then the discharge ofwhatever this was, and the whole thing happening.DID HE HEAR ANY SOUND WHATSOEVER AS THISTRANSFORMING TOOK PLACE?He didn't comment on sound. I think he would have commented if he heardanything, but he didn't mention. What he did say was that when he got in it, hefelt this very strong energy and it was very positive, he said. \"Love, love, love!\"IN THE CIRCLES.In the circles. This wonderful surge of energy and his parents told me that hecame to wake them up after he had been in the circles - he just sort of sat in thisbig one, I think, for awhile and then he went to tell his parents because he wasso excited. They went and looked at it and they said it was remarkable becauseevery time it happens with this kid, he feels very ill. He is not a happy camper atall several days prior to the event. And it was a transformation - he was full ofbeans and feeling great and energized and all the illness forgotten completely -which they've seen happen before.WHEN HE WAS WATCHING THIS TRANSFORMATION WHICHFASCINATES ME BECAUSE IT'S RARE - IT'S VERY RARE IN THELAST 40 YEARS OR SO THAT ANYBODY HAS EVER SEEN THISKIND OF TRANSFORMATION FROM SOMETHING SMALL TOSOMETHING LARGE, BUT IT HAS OCCURRED. AND I HAVE"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"INTERVIEWED PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN MULTIPLEMILITARY EYEWITNESSES TO WATCHING SOMETHING THATTHEY SAID REMINDED THEM OF APPROXIMATELY 10 - 20 FOOTWIDE ASPIRIN SITTING ON THE GROUND THAT SUDDENLYTURNED INTO A LARGE CRAFT.This is very interesting. He was very clear that it was not a UFO. It was a light, amisty, foggy light, and it apparently retained that character, even when it becamedisc-like looking. In his opinion, it did not look metallic or solid the way I knowmany of these reports are. In his mind, or to his eyes, it retained this sort ofmisty character, even when it became disc-shaped rather than football-shaped.SO IT REMAINED THE PINK, GLOWING.Yeah, and he said he had never seen a color quite like that - it was amazing tohim. Pinkish-purple.DID HE EVER FEEL AT THAT POINT THAT HE GOT ANY IMAGESIN HIS MIND AS IF THERE WAS ANY KIND OF TELEPATHICCOMMUNICATION?He didn't say anything about that either, although he has had encounters in thepast - this time when he was in the field and these small, sort of grapefruit-sizedwhitish balls were in the field - that was a daytime encounter, two years agonow, and he was simply riding in the field on his bike and had stopped off inthis one field that he particularly likes. And observed HUNDREDS of thesegrapefruit and tennis ball-sized white - milky white sort of opaquish balls, someof which approached him and began circling around him. At which point, hebecame unconscious and when he woke up he was in the middle of this cropcircle - a brand new one.At that time, he also saw an entity - a form - that he perceived as female and itdid transmit information to him, or he had the impression of that. And thatfigure has returned at least one more time - I think two more times - once to thegarden out back of his house and once in his bedroom actually. He has a namefor it. He thinks he knows its name which I believe he prefers to keep private. Hehas a name for it he prefers to keep quiet. And it does transmit some sort oftelepathic communication about the crop circles being very important formankind to be paying attention to and he thinks that it has something to do withthe environment and deceit - that the crop circles are somehow or other anantidote or there is something about the crop circles that is to fight deceit.TO FIGHT DECEIT AS LYING AND HIDING?Yes, in humankind generally. That something like that - he doesn't understand itall. It's not clear. And he has no idea why he himself is involved, but as aparallel to all this - what has happened with him is that he has developed thisincredible apparent healing abilities and he has people coming - he makesappointments all day long - now they've limited it to, I think, three days a week -where people come with all sorts of physical and mental problems and he hassome ability that he doesn't understand at all to identify what their trouble isand often to heal them. In fact, apparently in the majority of cases, they becomewell after a session with Robert. And that happened - all this came about afterhe started getting involved with the crop circles.IT''S INTERESTING THAT HE WOULD SAY THAT THEY MIGHTHAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH FIGHTING DECEIT BECAUSETHE THING THAT HAS STRUCK ALL OF US OVER THE PASTDECADE IS THEY ARE WORLDWIDE, THEY ARE RIGHT THERE INFRONT OF YOU, AND IT IS AS IF SOMETHING HAS BEEN TRYINGTO DO SIGNALING OR COMMUNICATION OUTSIDE OF THERESTRICTED PARADIGMS OF POLITICAL SYSTEMS."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Yeah. I have to say, I know this boy pretty well. I know his family pretty well.These are very straight, middleclass Dutch hard-working people. There isnothing flamboyant, there is nothing foolish about these people at all. And theyhave questioned and questioned all this up until fairly recently. And now theyhave just accepted that it's happening and are doing their best to cope withwhatever it means. But I am about as sure as I can be that Robert is simplytelling exactly what he saw to the best of his ability. And he himself is tryinglike crazy to understand why it happens where he is, what he's supposed to doabout all of this, and then just proceed.This is apparently the first real crop formation in Holland of this season. Therewas another flattened area in a potato field about the same time, but the plantsin that case were not swirled, were not layered - they were simply dehydratedremarkably, visibly, and flattened very which way. It's not a typical crop circle,the potatoes.But he tends to get trains of thought when this all starts to happen, so I wouldn'tbe surprised if he's got more to say than what we were able to get on the phone.WERE THERE ANY CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE CIRCLES ANDCORRIDORS?Apparently not, and I'm not sure how far apart the 10 foot one was from the 30foot one, but I gather it's pretty much in the same area. And the area is almostexactly where the snow circle was and this flax seed circle that happened lastspring.Here we have two very clear descriptions of crop circles occurring and indifferent ways. The daylight one were the spheres and you see them all overEngland and we have photographs from all over. They were clearly involved inthat first one that he was in. And now we have this other thing - I've never hearda description quite like this.In Sussex - I remember telling you about the Sussex one a couple of years agowhere an elderly man had gotten up in the middle of the night and looked outhis window and he also saw balls of lights - what he described - close to theground, several of them, multiple balls and then lights shooting from the ballsdown to the ground and back up to the balls. And in the morning, they found afairly complex formation in that location. So, it seems like the formation processmay not be one thing. It may be several.If your listeners are interested in this crop circle phenomenon, and particularly ifthey are willing to help the BLT Team - what they can do is notify us if they findsuch an event. And the way to do that is to call the office at (617) 492-0415. Orthey can FAX the office at (617) 492-0414. Once they call, I'll call them back soit won't cost them much. And we can then discuss the event itself and figure outwhether or not it's one we ought to sample and anybody out there interested inhelping the sampling, I'll love you for life! It's a lot of work, but it's veryrewarding. It's well worth it.\"More Information:The first unusual patterns in United States crops were recently reported south ofAnnapolis, Maryland. Several fields had randomly downed cereal crops thathave a fluidity in the way they are laid down with multiple layers that cross atninety degree angles. Over the past several years in the U. S., Levengood hasfound some of the greatest biochemical and biophysical changes in plantssampled from these odd, randomly downed crops. A similar phenomenon wasreported today by an investigator in Illinois near St. Louis where fifteen fieldshave randomly downed winter wheat that has peculiar scalloped edges and"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"flowing lays \"as if water had swept through the plants.\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
