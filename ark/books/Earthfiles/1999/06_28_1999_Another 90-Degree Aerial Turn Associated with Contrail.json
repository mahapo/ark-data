In my June 3, 1999 Earthfiles report associated with thatradio broadcast, I posted two x-shaped contrail photos shown below dated May14, 1999 taken at 3:30 p.m. EST by a New Jersey eyewitness, Ed Davieau, ofVernon in Sussex County near the New York State border. A bright, roundobject with a pale corona stands out in the sky near the X-shaped contrails.Glowing round object and x-shaped contrails in Vernon,New Jersey on May 14, 1999 at 3:30 p.m. EST. Photograph © 1999 by Ed davieau.After that broadcast and Earthfiles report, I received a photograph from a ThreeRivers, Michigan resident named Alan Otterson of a contrail he said made a90-degree angle turn while he and his wife were driving. They were so surprisedthat they pulled over into a parking lot to take the photograph shown here onApril 24, 1999."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"90-angle contrail in Three Rivers, Michigan on April 24, 1999,early morning. Photograph © 1999 by Alan Otterson.Now, Ed Davieau's roommate, Sandra Hanekamp, reports that on June 6, 1999,that she, too, was surprised to see a cigar-shaped, metallic silver aerial devicemake a 90-degree turn away from a white, thick contrail that kept movingforward.Interview:Sandra Hanekamp, Resident, Sussex, New Jersey Near New York StateLine: \"And we had been watching the contrails because we had noticed thatsome of them, there were quite a few of them at one time. In fact, we had taken aphoto of nine of them crossing (by Ed Davieau above). So, I was on the deckand watching a plane going overhead. It was going from north to south.ABOUT WHAT TIME?It was around 2:30 pm in the afternoon. I watched the plane and as it went over,all of a sudden from the left of this plane - like at a right angle - a very sharpangle, I thought the plane was turning. And it dawned on me that this planecouldn't turn in a 90-degree angle like that. So, the contrail kept on going, butthe silver object went directly to the left heading east. It was just a silver object.There was nothing coming out of it, and then all of a sudden it just disappearedand the contrail kept on going straight.HOW FAR DID THE CONTRAIL ITSELF GO?Well, it went until it was out of sight as far as I could see. I mean, it keptmoving.THE QUESTION IS: HOW DID THE CONTRAIL KEEP MOVING IFTHE SILVER OBJECT WAS WHAT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR IT?That's what I couldn't figure out. And then on the other hand, I realized in abouthalf a second that a plane couldn't turn that way. I mean, it just - suddenly therewas this silver, and it was an oval, almost like a cigar-shape, with no wing, butthe sun was hitting it real bright and it was just this big metal brightness andthen it traveled, oh, I guess fifteen or twenty seconds and then it was gone out ofsight.EVEN IF IT IS SOME KIND OF REMOTE-CONTROLLED MACHINE,HOW DID THE CONTRAIL KEEP GOING STRAIGHT IF THEMACHINE MAKING IT TURNED A 90-DEGREE ANGLE?I honestly don't know, because from that point on I could not see a plane infront of the contrail - I mean, the plane itself was gone, but the contrailcontinued. And this object ... and I knew it couldn't be another plane crossingbecause it came right off of the area where the contrail was. It wasn't above it orbelow it."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WAS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THE CONSISTENCY OF THISCONTRAIL THAT SEEMED DIFFERENT FROM NORMALAIRLINERS?It spread out. It didn't stay in a thin line. And it didn't evaporate. It just kind ofspread out and was more like a cloud. It smoothed out after awhile, but it didn'tdisappear right away.DID YOU GET ANY PHOTOS?No, it happened so fast. And I was just sitting there watching it and all of asudden, I see this object and then it was gone. I didn't have the camera outside.\"More Information:I welcome any information, on or off the record, from military, intelligence orcivilians who might have first hand knowledge about United States research anddevelopment of remote-controlled aerial devices and what their variedapplications might be.
