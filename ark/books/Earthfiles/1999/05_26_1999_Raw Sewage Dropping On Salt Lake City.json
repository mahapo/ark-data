At first,investigators looked to airplanes in the sky. The FAA investigated but could notmatch the splattered neighborhoods with specific plane traffic. As the incidentshave repeated, law enforcement is now looking for vandals on the ground.Jennifer Dobner is a crime reporter at The Deseret News. I talked with her andlater Captain Lee Smith of the Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office. First, I quotedan Associated Press report for Jennifer Dobner's comment.Interviews:Jennifer Dobner, Crime Reporter, The Deseret News, Salt Lake City,Utah:\"JENNIFER, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS HAS REPORTED THAT,'GOBS OF THICK, RAW SEWAGE HAS FALLEN FROM THE SKYMORE THAN A DOZEN TIMES SINCE APRIL 9, SOILING AS MANYAS SEVEN HOUSES AT ONCE.'That's true. They don't seem to know what it is. Initially, they thought -- theyknow this, they tested it and it contains e-coli bacteria. Which means it's fecalmaterial. But they don't know if it's of human origin or if it's from an animal. Allthey know about the first cases they have seen is that it looks to have beendropped, the splatter and everything would come from the top and move downtowards the ground.THIS WOULD MEAN SOMETHING PERHAPS COMING FROMAIRCRAFT OVERHEAD?Well, that theory has been discussed, but they have not been able to link it toany aircraft. And at first they said if it was airline sewage, it would be treatedwith like a blue material and so there would be blue liquid mixed in with thematter and that hasn't proven true. No one's caught anybody. Nobody's seenanything. At this point, there is no evidence linking it to any particular source.It's quite puzzling.\"Capt. Lee Smith, West Patrol, Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office: \"Thevictims of this simple act of vandalism -- that's what it is -- are coming out anddiscovering this stuff on their cars and in their yards and they are reporting it.THERE WAS A REPORT IN ASSOCIATED PRESS THAT SAID A MANNAMED TOM PERKINS HAD DROPPINGS IN HIS HOUSE OR YARDAND WAS QUOTED AS SAYING IT WOULD TAKE A 600 POUNDPIGEON WITH DIARRHEA TO PRODUCE THE COVERAGE THATPROMPTED HIS SON TO ASK, 'DAD, WHAT'S ALL THE MUD DOINGON THE HOUSE?'If it was one of those first incidents, that would be a good description. There was"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"a lot of material spread out and it was spread out over several houses. I thinkthat's why the HAZMAT (Hazardous Materials) people were convinced that itwas an accidental discharge from an airliner because of the volume that theywere dealing with and the pattern would suggest it did come from the sky andbeing spread out over four or five (actually seven at one time) different houses --that would suggest that the height and the speed were consistent with an aircraft.That's why I say law enforcement wasn't even involved in the first couple ofweeks of this because we weren't suspicious that it was pranksters at work. Whatwe were seeing in the news reports was it very possibly could be an accidentaldischarge from an airliner.HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT TRYING TO TRACK DOWNPERPETRATORS LIKE THIS?Tracking them down is not how we are going to solve this. It's educating thepublic to stop looking up, stop looking for the answers in the sky, and startwatching specific activity on the ground, especially at night, and when -- and ifit continues with this activity, pretty soon somebody is going to see somethingthat's going to shed some light on who's doing what. And the investigation leadus to the culprits.\"More Information:The Taylorsville City Council has offered a $2500 reward for information thatmight lead to the arrest of whoever is behind these raw sewage drops on thesuburbs south of Salt Lake City. The contact number is 801-535-5291 and askfor Detective Mallas.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
