In 1997, several eyewitnesses in Arizona estimated that oneunidentified aerial triangle was almost two miles long. (See 03/13/97 Earthfiles,Large Triangle Over Phoenix, Azizona.)Now, on April 22, 1999 just before midnight, Tony Chapparo of Albuquerque,New Mexico walked to the second story balcony of his house. He was facingeast toward the Sandia Mountains when he looked up toward the zenith.Interview:Tony Chapparo, Albuquerque, New Mexico: As I was looking up toward thestars, I noticed three amber-colored lights that formed a perfect triangle. Andthey weren't there at first. As far as I could tell, they just appeared there. Theydidn't come from across the sky.DID THEY SEEM TO POP IN OR FADE IN?They seemed to fade in more than pop in.AND THE COLOR WOULD BE LIKE CANTALOUPE, OR WHAT?Yeah, that would be a good description.SO CANTALOUPE, THE FLESH OF A CANTALOUPE ORANGE.Right.AND AS YOU'RE STANDING THERE NOW TALKING TO ME ONTHE PHONE, IF YOU EXTENDED YOUR HAND AWAY FROM YOU,WOULD THE LIGHT BE AS BIG AS THE END OF YOUR LITTLEFINGER OR SMALLER OR LARGER?I would say a little larger than my little finger.AND ABOUT HOW HIGH IN THE NIGHT SKY DO YOU THINKTHESE LIGHTS WERE?That would be a hard thing to tell. That's not something I'd ever seen before. Justa rough guess, maybe 10,000 feet. Almost straight up, not quite straight up and Ijust saw these lights fade in, these amber colored lights fade in. I'd say the objectstayed motionless for one or two seconds. And then, it took off in a northerlydirection and I'd estimate the speed would be 4 or 5 times the rate of acommercial airliner. So, it took off pretty fast.NOW, IN BETWEEN THE THREE AMBER LIGHTS SORT OF THECOLOR OF THE INSIDE OF A CANTALOUPE, WERE YOU SEEINGDARKNESS OR WHAT?Yes. It was completely dark.SO YOU WERE SEEING A DARK TRIANGLE THAT HAD THESEAMBER LIGHTS AT THE THREE CORNERS?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Right. And I also wanted to add that this triangle had absolutely no soundwhatsoever. It was completely silent which surprised me. I didn't really knowwhat I was looking at at the time. I was just amazed at what I was looking at. Itwas nothing I had ever seen before.AND HOW BIG WOULD YOU SAY THIS TRIANGLE WAS UP ABOUT10,000 FEET?The best way I could describe that would be if I were to stretch my hand out inthe sky. It would reach from my index finger to my palm would be its length.And the width would be roughly from my little finger to my thumb. It was fairlylarge.THAT IS PRETTY BIG.That's the best I could describe the size. I really don't know what I was lookingat at the time.AND WHEN IT MOVED OFF, DID ANYTHING CHANGE IN THOSEORANGE LIGHTS?No, the color didn't change. They didn't flash. They stayed steady. The positionof the lights didn't change at all.AND THE BLACKNESS -- YOU COULDN'T SEE STARS THROUGH ITIN ANY WAY?No, not that I could tell.IT WAS JUST A SOLID OPAQUE BLACK TRIANGLE, ALMOST NEARZE N IT H ?That's correct.IN YOUR GUT, DO YOU THINK YOU WERE LOOKING ATSOMETHING TERRESTRIAL OR NOT?I would say not terrestrial. And my gut feeling would be I don't think we haveany technology that could duplicate what I saw.\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
