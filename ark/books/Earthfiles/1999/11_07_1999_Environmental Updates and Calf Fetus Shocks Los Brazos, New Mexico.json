Also, please see web site listingbelow.November 7, 1999 Environmental Updates -Primitive Fish A Half A Billion Years AgoOne of the challenges of science is to figure out the beginning of things, from thedawn of the cosmos to how long ago vertebrate animals with bones firstappeared on earth. In this past week's journal Nature, two Chinese teamsreported the discovery of fish-like fossils with primitive backbones that are about530 million years old. That puts them in the middle of the Cambrian epochwhen all kinds of animal life proliferated on this planet. For Cambridge,England scientist, Simon Morris, the fact there were primitive fish nearly half abillion years ago means that \"the so-called Cambrian explosion was more abruptand dramatic than we thought.\"Radio Telescope Might See The Beginning of Galaxy Creation?The Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-Ray Observatory have been\"seeing\" into the universe more clearly than any manmade device before. Buteven they can't see back to the first creations of galaxies and planets. Now,astronomers from around the world are designing a giant array of radiotelescopes that might be able to. A big advantage of radio telescopes that captureshort wavelength radio emissions is their ability to see through dust and gassesthat block optical images. Astronomers met at the Carnegie Institution ofWashington in October to discuss the project they are calling the AltacamaLarge Millimeter Array, or ALMA. It would consist of 64 receiving dishes orantennas spread over 6.2 miles. That is too large for a mountain top, so scientistshave picked out one of the driest and most remote spots on the earth to buildALMA - the Altacama desert on a 16,500 foot plateau in the Andes mountainsof Chile. If all goes well, construction will begin in 2001 and perhaps becomplete around 2007.Mutilated Half Cats in Toronto, Ontario, CanadaA $60,000 reward has been offered by the Ontario Society for the Prevention ofCruelty to Animals for any information about the current cycle of mutilated andhalf cats that began in August 1999. The reward offer has generated phone calls,but no suspects. The SPCA's lead investigator, Debbie Hunt, is now seeking helpfrom the Toronto Police whose focus will be serial killers, and presumably aninternational ring of them. Similar cat mutilations have been occurring inLondon, England, San Jose, California, Ft. Worth, Texas, and Ontario, Canadaall at the same time. In the past two weeks, the case number in the Ontarioprovince climbed from seven to ten as three more mutilated cats were foundbeyond North York, a Toronto suburb where the first dead cat was discoveredon August 12th. The most recent mutilated bodies were found in Mississauga, a"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"community west of Toronto, Parry Sound approximately 100 miles north ofToronto, and in Sault Ste. Marie at the western edge of the Ontario province.27,000 Migrating Black Birds Dead in Mascoutah, IllinoisStill no arrests have been made in the Mascoutah, Illinois deliberate poisoningof 27,000 migrating black birds with the insecticide Furadan. I talked with anIllinois investigator Friday who said his state is waiting for the U. S. Fish andWildlife Service to press charges.250 Gulls Dead In Erie, PennsylvaniaThe count of dead Ring Necked and Black Backed Gulls at Presque Isle StatePark in Erie, Pennsylvania is now about 250. The Madison, Wisconsinlaboratory doing necropsies and microbe analyses have so far ruled out KunjinWest Nile Fever. This past week, there was confirmation of Type E AvianBotulism in some of the birds and in several hundred ducks on Lake Huron nearChattem, Ontario. But there are still unanswered questions about the extensivehemorrhaging in most of the gulls and whether that could be connected to ablood thinning poison used to kill rats.Bizarre Calf Fetus in Los Brazos, New MexicoAnother unusual animal death occurred Friday, October 22nd about 10 p.m.MST on the Canones Ranch in Los Brazos, New Mexico about 25 milessoutheast of Dulce and about 11 miles south of Chama.Rancher Joe Martinez and his grandson tried to help a pregnant heifer who wentinto premature labor, but the fetus was in a breech position and Mr. Martinezhad to use chains to pull the fetus out. It was grossly deformed. Mrs. CordyMartinez told me, \"The calf was coming tail end first. They really had to work topull it out because it had a big, big head. There was no resemblance to a calf. Itwas just a big, round head, round and sunken. And when they opened themouth, they found that the eyeballs were under the cheeks.\"White tissue was growing out of the back of the head, ears protruded from theneck, intestines were growing outside the abdomen, all four legs were stuntedand misshapen and so was the tail.Grossly deformed fetus transported by rancher Joe Martinez on Saturday, October 23, 1999toveterinarian Leroy Martinez, D. V. M., Cebolla, New Mexico.Photograph © 1999 by Adam Vance.Joe Martinez told me that the mother of this fetus was a young heifer in 1997 inthe same pasture that another of Joe's cows was found dead and mutilated. Butthe mother belongs to a friend in Chamayo who pastures his animals at theMartinez's Los Brazos ranch.KOAT-TV (ABC) Reporter Marisa Maes from Albuquerque talked to me aboutwhat happened and what she saw Saturday morning, October 23rd, when"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"everyone converged at veterinarian Leroy Martinez's office in Cibolla. GabeValdez, a field researcher for the National Institute of Discovery Sciences(NIDS) headquartered in Las Vegas, was there to authorize a necropsy on thefetus.Interviews:Marisa Maes, Reporter, KOAT-TV, Albuquerque, New Mexico: \"When itwas born, it was so grotesquely deformed that they (Martinez family) just kindof freaked out. And what they did was throw it into the back of Joe's truck anddrove it, he and his grandson, to Chama and went to the local cafe where a lotof the police hang out. And he called everybody out and said, 'Hey, look at thisthing!' They all said, 'Wow, we've never seen anything like that before.' And thatwas about it. The police then notified the Discovery Science...THE INSTITUTE FOR DISCOVERY SCIENCE (NIDS).... and Joe took it home to his shed. After it had been in his shed for over 24hours and the whole community came to his house to see it - so it became like alittle local attraction - he then took it to a veterinarian in Cebolla. We spokewith the (NIDS) representative (Gabe Valdez) and two of the officers from theRio Riba Sheriff's Department who saw it and they all declined to say what itwas. All the said was, 'We've never seen anything like it before and we don'tknow what it is and we're not going to go on camera.' That's what they told me.I was saying to them that it looks to me like it's a genetic mutation and obviouslythis cow aborted it. They said, 'Well, we don't know what it is and we've neverseen anything like it and we have to do tests first.'WAS THERE ANY EYES OR NOSE?I did not see any eyes and there was a nose. I was trying to give a scientificanswer because I didn't want to make a bigger deal than it should be, withpeople going, 'Oh, my God, we have an alien cow!'Close-up of deformed fetus's upper torso.

Photograph © 1999 by Adam Vance.Another Eyewitness:Many photographs and some videotapes by various people were taken of thedeformed fetus. I talked with one New Mexico resident who says she did see twoeyes. Rebecca Minshall is a licensed certified neuro-muscular therapist inAlbuquerque.Rebecca Minshall, Licensed Certified Neuro-Muscular Therapist,Albuquerque, New Mexico: \"For awhile they thought there were no eyes. Thegentleman lifted up a fold of skin in the front of this round-shaped head and"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"underneath this fold of skin were eyes. They were white with a vertical pupilthat looked very reptilian.YOU COULD SEE THIS CLEARLY?Absolutely see this very clearly. Very white, as white as a human's eyes and avery small, very narrow slit of a pupil that looked reptilian. I have no other wayto describe it.WERE YOU LOOKING AT THIS VERTICAL SLIT IN BOTHEYEBALLS?Yes. He lifted up the flap over both eyes.THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN IF THE CALF WERE STANDING ONFOUR LEGS WITH THIS BASKETBALL HEAD - WHERE WOULDTHESE EYES HAVE BEEN IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE BODY?Fairly low on the head. And there was a mouth, but it looked like a gash in thefront of this basketball-shaped head. And it was kind of bloody. It was red. Andthe gentleman in the videotape opened that jaw, brought the jaw down slightlyand I heard him say on the tape, \"Yes, there is a tongue in there. That jaw wasbasically the only feature on the head. Now, coming out the back of the head - ifthis were a human being lying on its back where your head touches the bed orpillow - was a protrusion that was white and membranous and when we lookedat it we thought perhaps it was part of the brain that developed outside of thehead. It was right in the back of the head and white. It didn't have as many ridgesas cauliflower, but it kind of reminded you a little bit of a bunch of cauliflowerstems together.There appeared to be no cranium whatsoever. There appeared to be no bone inthe top half of this head. It was just skin on the top of the head, so as he movedthe head from one side to the other, you could literally see the fluid sloshingback and forth. This gentleman said that when they withdrew some of this fluid,it was blood.JUST BLOOD.Yes. I believe he said it looked to be 95% blood. There were four legs that werequite deformed. It appeared that if the creature had lived there was no way thelegs would ever have held up this body. The back legs were short and bent andI'm not even sure there was any kind of a joint in the leg at all.Close-up stunted hind legs and feet of deformed fetus.Photograph © 1999 by Adam Vance.The front legs also appeared to have some hoof material on them, but it seemedto me I recollect that it was splayed in some way so that it almost appeared likeclaws - very unusual, very abnormal.CAN YOU TRY TO GIVE A LITTLE MORE WORD PICTURE ONWHAT YOU MEAN, THEY ALMOST LOOKED LIKE CLAWS?The hooves appeared to be - whatever was at the end of these front legs had"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"something on the very end of them that reminded you some how of claws.\"More Information:Rancher Joe Martinez confirmed that the unformed front hooves had little fingerbones that normally develop inside hooves. I asked him,\"And the eyes were down below that red gash of a mouth?\"He answered, \"Right. They were a little below the mouth.\"\"An eye with a vertical pupil?\"\"Right.\"\"That's true?\"\"Right.\"\"And what color were the eyes?\"\"They were kind of like blue eyes. And they pulled one eye out and took it tothe lab.\" \"NIDS took one eye to analyze?\"\"Yes, one eye.\"\"And where is the carcass of this fetus now?\"\"It's on my ranch.\"\"How are you preserving it?\"\"It's just hanging from a tree drying out.\"\"Did Dr. Martinez say he found anything unusual?\"\"No. He just said it was a deformed cow. But to me, it didn't look like adeformed cow. It looked like something I've seen a lot of deformed calves, butthis one was way, way off! Really strange.\"In the necropsy performed by Dr. Leroy Martinez, the heart and liver wereenlarged, but the rest of the organs were normal for a bovine fetus. As ofMonday, November 1st, the Rio Riba County Sheriff's Department signed offfrom any further investigation. To date, NIDS has not scheduled DNA testing,but I will have further information about the fetus's eye from NIDS on or aboutNov. 14, 1999.
