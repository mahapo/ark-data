And if it does exist, it would be belowthe surface. \"- Bruce Jakowsky, Ph.D., Geologist andPlanetary Scientist,University of Colorado, BoulderDecember 2, 1999 Houston, Texas - On Friday, December 3rd, NASA's PolarLander will set down on the South Polar Cap of Mars. Two probes designed topunch into the soil will be released. If all goes well, soil samples will be warmedup and analyzed for water. If there's ice, there might be liquid waterunderground. And if there's water, then life could still possibly exist on Mars -even if only bacteria and other microbes below the surface.The Allan Hills, Antarctica ALH84001 meteorite discovered in 1984 that made worldwideheadlines because scientists found rice-shaped carbon globules in tiny cracks on the rockwhichresembled earth bacteria. The carbon in this meteorite dates back about three billion yearswhenMars probably had water on its surface, was warmer and had a global magnetic field.Photograph provided by the NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas.Scientists still argue about the meteorite found at Allan Hills, Antarctica inwhich fossilized bacteria was reported on August 8, 1996. One of the scientistswho has studied the Allan Hills meteorite is biochemist and Senior ResearcherKathie Thomas-Keprta at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Her workbegan there fifteen years ago analyzing microscopic carbon particles inmeteorites. Then she switched her attention to the unusual globules on theAllan Hills meteorite and was co-author on the first paper published in Sciencethat set off the media firestorm of headlines about fossilized bacteria from Mars.Now she has stronger evidence that links the Martian meteorite to livingmicrobes: tiny strings of hexagonal-shaped crystals of magnetite found inside the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"fossilized globules in the Martian rock.These three dark carbon globules might be fossilized Martian bacteria photographed in theAllan Hills, Antarctica meteorite by Kathie Thomas-Keprta at the NASA Johnson SpaceCenter,Houston, Texas. Small magnetite crystals were discovered inside the globules.Interview:Kathie Thomas-Keprta, M. S., Biochemistry, Senior Scientist, NASAJohnson Space Center, Houston, Texas: \"Really the simplest thing about themagnetite is that we know that there is no question that these magnetite grainswe find in the carbonates in Allan Hills formed on Mars. There is no question ofthat.WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE?We know that because the carbonates formed on Mars based on their oxygenand their carbon isotopic analyses. These magnetites are sitting in carbonate.And if you can envision a pancake and these magnetites are sitting on the topsurface of the carbonate and they are distributed all the way through thecarbonate. So, we know that if the carbonate formed on Mars, then themagnetite formed on Mars. And we're definitely able to say the carbonateformed on Mars. So, now we know that the magnetite formed on Mars.CAN YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN FOR A GENERAL RADIO AUDIENCEWHY THE MAGNETITE ITSELF MIGHT BE AN EVIDENTIARY LINKTO THE MATERIAL IN THIS METEORITE ACTUALLY RELATED TOBACTERIA?All right. We see three general types of magnetite associated with the carbonatesin the Allen Hills meteorite. And the third type makes up about 25% of all ofthe magnetite in Allen Hills in the carbonate globules. And these types of, theseforms, these shapes of these magnetites have a very distinctive shape. They looklike if you can envision little hexagonal columns. We've scoured the literature.We've looked at a lot of magnetite ourselves. And what we've found is that theonly way we know how to produce magnetites with this type of shape and in avery tiny size range that we call a 'single domain size range,' is by bacteria hereon earth. We don't know any other way to produce those types of magnetites.And we're seeing exactly the same types of magnetites in the Allen Hillsmeteorite."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Transmission electron microscopy of hexagonal-shaped magnetite crystals foundinside the carbon globules on the Allan Hills, Antarctica meteorite from Mars that might befossilized bacteria. Image photographed by Kathie Thomas-Keprta at theNASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas.WHAT PRODUCES THE HEXAGONAL STRUCTURE IN EARTH'SBACTERIA?Well, there are certain types of bacteria on earth that are called magnetotacticbacteria. And initially, they weren't discovered until 1975. So, they've only beenaround, we've only known about them for about 25 or 30 years now. And theseorganisms if you can envision them as long rod-shaped organisms and inside theorganisms they produce almost what you would call a chain of pearls and theylook, they are actually a chain of magnetite.WHY WOULD BACTERIA HAVE PEARL-LIKE CHAINS OFMAGNETITE THAT HAS THIS ODD HEXAGONAL SHAPE?Well, it's interesting because these organisms use these magnetites and what theydo is use these magnetic chains to orient themselves in the earth's magnetic field.And it was determined by Mars Global Surveyor and work that was done byAkuna and published in Science I think it was in 1998 that indeed it looks likeat one time Mars had a very strong global magnetic field.DO THEY KNOW HOW FAR BACK YOU HAVE TO GO TO THATPOINT?The age of these carbonates, in recent work that has been done by Nyquist andBorg and recently published in Science here just maybe a month or two monthsago, they found that the age of the carbonates runs around 3.92 billion years ofage. So, that would mean that indeed as these magnetites became incorporatedinto the carbonate and these organisms died that at that time Mars would havehad a strong magnetic field.WHY WOULD MARS HAVE HAD A STRONG MAGNETIC FIELD ANDTHEN LOSE IT?We don't understand that. Why would Mars have had water on the surface of theplanet at one time and have lost that as well? We believe that Mars and Earthformed under very similar circumstances that the planets in the early evolution,both planets followed a very similar pathway. But we're not sure what happenedto Mars.\" Why Did Mars Lose Both Its Surface Water and Magnetic Field?ANOTHER SCIENTIST WHO WOULD ALSO LIKE TO UNDERSTAND"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"MARS' CLIMATE AND WATER HISTORY AND POTENTIAL FOR LIFE ISDR. BRUCE JAKOSKY, PROFESSOR OF GEOLOGIC AND PLANETARYSCIENCES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO IN BOULDER. HEWORKS IN THE LABORATORY FOR ATMOSPHERIC AND SPACEPHYSICS. I ASKED DR. JAKOSKY WHAT MIGHT HAVE CAUSED MARSTO LOSE BOTH ITS SURFACE WATER AND MAGNETIC FIELD?Bruce Jakosky, Ph.D., Professor of Geologic and Planetary Sciences at theUniversity of Colorado in the Laboratory for Atmospheric and SpacePhysics (LASP), Boulder, Colorado:\"That's the $64,000 question. The CO2 that would have produced a greenhouseatmosphere could have been lost to space. It could have been incorporated intothe ground as carbonate minerals, and once that happens, the water could havefrozen out in the ground. It might have been lost to space as well. I think that'sone of the goals of this next decade aside from the life question to try tounderstand happened to the climate? What happened to the geology? What hasthe history of Mars been?COULD IT HAVE BEEN FROM AN IMPACT BY A COMET OR ALARGE METEORITE?No, not alone.WHAT WOULD HAVE PRECIPITATED THE LOSS OF ATMOSPHEREAND WATER?One possibility is that the turn off of the magnetic field 3.5 billion years agoallowed a mechanism of solar wind stripping of the atmosphere to turn on andthat could have been the precipitating mechanism.BUT WHAT WOULD HAVE LOST THE MAGNETIC FIELD ONMARS?The planet cooling down. It's a small planet. It's getting colder losing its heatthrough time.BECAUSE THE MOLTEN CORE WOULD HAVE GONE INTO AFROZEN STATE?Yes. Exactly. Based on our current understanding of what it takes to supportlife, there's no reason to think that life on Mars if it ever existed ceased when thesurface became cold and dry. On earth we see examples of micro-organisms thatcan live beneath the surface of the earth. For example, getting their energy fromchemical reactions between water and rock miles below the surface. There isevery reason to think those same times of environments would be present onMars - that liquid water is present beneath the surface and that there areenvironments on Mars that could easily support these types of organisms. So,although life at the Martian surface would have been possible only 3.5 or 4billion years ago, life could have existed on Mars any time from 4 billion yearsago all the way up to the present. If it does exist, it would be below the surface.The Mars Polar Lander does not have any life detection experiments on it. It's aclimate space craft. The goal of the mission is to try to understand the behaviorof water. Water, of course, is a key ingredient in understanding the conditions asto whether life could exist or not. But by looking at the water, measuring watervapor in the atmosphere, the properties of the atmosphere, digging down andlooking for ice in the ground. What we're really doing is trying to understandhow the seasonal cycles work and what the integrated effect is over timescalesup to a million or ten million years. If we can understand that, we can begin toaddress questions like how much water is there on Mars today? Where is thewater? How does it move around? Does it cycle between the polar caps, theatmosphere and the ground? And how much moves around?THERE STILL MIGHT BE MAGNETITE-BEARING BACTERIA INMARTIAN SOILS?That's right. We don't know, based on our current knowledge, whether we havefound fossil evidence of Martian life. I think the one thing that people are"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"becoming convinced of is we're not going to get the answer from the rocks wehave today. The meteorites that have come from Mars are just too complicatedand we don't know where on Mars they came from. If we're going to answer thequestion about life, most people are recognizing that we need to go back toMars, go to places where liquid water has existed where life had the bestopportunity to exist, land on the surface, collect rocks that have had the bestopportunity to retain some memory of that life from a long time ago, bring thoserocks back to earth and study them in detail here.THAT'S SUPPOSED TO START OCCURING IF ALL GOES WELL INTHE 2003 AND 2005 MISSIONS TO ACTUALLY BRING SAMPLESBACK TO THE EARTH BY 2008?That's right.DO YOU KNOW HOW THEY PLAN TO GET THE LANDERS BACKUP INTO ORBIT AROUND MARS AND BACK TO EARTH?They are not going to bring the entire lander back. What they are going to do iscollect the samples and put them in a small sample container about the size of asmall volley ball and launch that into orbit on a tiny rocket. Once it's in orbit, aseparate spacecraft will collect the sample containers and bring them back to theearth.DOING ALL OF THIS UNMANNED?Ye s .IT'S QUITE A FEAT.It's not a trivial task. It challenges us in the same way that the Apollo programputting humans on the moon challenged us 30 years ago. Meaning it's notobvious we're going to succeed.
