One subject many of uswill be talking about is global environmental deterioration. And the March 15th,1999 Geophysical Research Letters, has published the first study to confirm thatthe air people are breathing in Washington State probably contains chemicalpollution from Chinese factories. Professor Dan Jaffe at the University ofWashington and his colleagues concluded that 22% of the carbon monoxidearriving at Cheeka Peak in Washington had originated in East Asia. The pollutedair took about six days to travel from Asia to North America. Professor Jaffe wasphilosophical about the fact that our planet seems to get smaller as problemsspill from country to country: \"We make pollution, too. Everybody's pollutiongoes somewhere else.\"2) Rings in Canada:This past week, the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada listenedto geochemist Stewart Hamilton from the Ontario, Canada Geological Surveyexplain his theory about why there are thousands of gigantic, perfectly circularrings in the forests of northern Ontario and Quebec. The diameters range from900 feet to over a mile. The width of the bands are about six feet wide wherenothing grows and are depressed as much as six feet down into the soil. No oneunderstood how extensive the rings are until an aerial survey in 1998 countedtwo thousand in two months. Anticosti Island in the Gulf of the St. LawrenceRiver alone has 200 rings. If all northern Canadian forests were surveyed, someestimates project there could be as many as six thousand rings.After Spreading Fungi was ruled out, prospectors want to know if there issomething under all these rings like a diamond-bearing kimberlite pipe that'sworth drilling for.But so far, drilling cores have come up with nothing more than a lot oflimestone in the soil and underneath the rings. Stewart Hamilton told theprospectors that he thinks the rings are \"earth, or geo, batteries.\" It's only atheory and as yet unproven, but this is how it would work.If you have a mineral deposit deep underground that is a strong source ofnegative electrical charge and up above there is oxygen in ground water thatproduces a positive electric charge, you've got a natural battery that is slowlyand continually discharging. And if the soils are filled with limestone carbonate,acidic conditions eat it away forming the depressed rings. Mr. Hamiltoncompared the process to adding vinegar to baking soda. Acid is produced at theedges and dissolves away soil and the ground surface drops.\"However, Dr. Jean Veillette, a research scientist who specializes in glacial"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"geology and geomorphology for the Geologic Survey of Canada points out thatin the winter of 1998 three deep holes were drilled through ring soil in northernOntario without finding any source that could provide a negative charge.Furthermore, New Foundland also has limestone rich soil and no rings havebeen found in those forests. Dr. Veillette says the giant rings are a \"truemystery.\"3) Sphere In Contrail:In Thursday morning, March 18th, 1999, COAST TO COAST AM, Iinterviewed Matthew Garner of Albuquerque, New Mexico about his sighting ofa silver sphere-shaped object moving amid several contrails and stopping. Thatoccurred two days before on March 16th around 11:30 AM.Afterward, I received a FAX from an Albuquerque resident who said she, too,was outside at the same time taking photographs of \"a large X in the sky andmany contrails\" which struck her as extremely odd, just as Matthew Garner haddescribed. But she did not see the silver sphere.After that COAST broadcast, within a few hours I received nearly 100 FAXesfrom 15 different states about large X contrails, or skies completely covered withcontrails seen this past week -- or as far back as December 1998.As I said on COAST, I watched with my own eyes as huge Xs were made in ablue sky over Sedona, Arizona on February 27th -- and two days later on March1 in Phoenix. The Sedona Xs were freshly made and I and others could see onelarge silver plane at a high altitude making the newest X.What I would like to share on DREAMLAND tonight are some of theeyewitness reports about more silver spheres in contrails and strangely circled orscribbled symbols that are not logical to airplane flight. One caller suggestedthat military rocket tests and explosions can produce scribble-looking contrails,but that would not explain such patterns over densely populated areas.Letter from Peterson AFB Employee Who Prefers Anonymity, ColoradoSprings, Colorado\"I had a similar experience as the gentleman from New Mexico concerningcontrails and the silvery sphere. My sighting occurred on March 16, 1999 at11:45 AM through 3 PM approximately. The sphere appeared in the haze thatwas left behind by one of the craft (plane). I have video of craft and contrails(also patterns), but not the sphere (unusual).\"March 16th at 11:45 AM in Colorado Springs is the same date and time thatMatthew Garner watched the silver sphere through binoculars overAlbuquerque. The next day, March 17th at 1:40 PM, a resident of Mansfield, PAsaid she \"saw the exact same X contrails and silver disc\" over a rural area wherethere is usually no air traffic at all.Also, on March 16th in the morning, Cave Junction, Oregon residents FAXedthat they heard jets go over their house. Later, outside, they saw a hugecloverleaf-shaped contrail that covered the entire sky.Many listeners FAXed about strange contrail patterns, but two stuck outbecause they are from two different states, and yet the drawings are identical.One was over Waco, Texas in March.The other goes back to December 1998 near Mesquite, Nevada from aneyewitness who served in the U. S. Army:"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Fax from eyewitness in U. S. Army, Mesquite, Nevada\"In early December 1998, I was traveling north from Las Vegas along InterstateI-15 towards Mesquite. It was a Saturday evening (the same as the night itsnowed 2 inches in Las Vegas) around sunset when I pulled into the MoapaIndian Reservation store and casino to purchase a cold drink. When weapproached the store, we saw several people staring into the sky to thesouthwest back along the highway towards Las Vegas. We then observed astrange contrail' in the sky slightly to the right of the lights of Las Vegas whichplaces it somewhere over the Pahrump area, or even possibly further to thesouthwest over Death Valley, California.\"The contrail was shaped like three concentric circles one above the other,rather like a flattened spring, with a long contrail extending off the bottom circlepointing towards the southeast. It was getting dark, but the contrail remainedilluminated for at least an hour until it was completely dark and the trail thenslowly dispersed and vanished into the night. The strange thing about thisphenomenon was that in the center of the circles was a diffused light, rather likethe colors of a prism with red, green and yellow predominating. Rather like lightreflected through a mist of oil. I live right under the air traffic corridor leadinginto Las Vegas so I am quite familiar with the patterns and behavior of regularcontrails. But this contrail was unlike anything I have ever seen before.\"It was midday when I again observed a similar contrail to the west, but this timethere was only one circle as if a high flying jet aircraft had turned around in acomplete circle until he resumed its original course.\"Letter from resident, Denver Colorado:\"Contrails have been increasing with regularity and concentration as far asnumbers of trails and frequency all around the Denver, Colorado area. Example:a friend was in Elizabeth, Colorado (south of Denver 30 miles). He was tellinghis family about this as there were some trails overhead on Sunday, March 15,1999. At that moment, a white glob fell out of the sky and \"goop\" stuck to thescreen door. He showed his family and (the goop) disappeared.\"I also have other references for other substances that have fallen to the groundand hope some can be analyzed to contribute more data to this baffling andongoing story of mysterious contrails.I welcome more information on these environmental problems, rings in forestsand unusual phenomena.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
