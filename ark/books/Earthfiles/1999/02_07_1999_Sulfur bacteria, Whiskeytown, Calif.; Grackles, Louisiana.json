But first, there is unsettling news this week from New England about a rare virusattacking salmon there. When the first boats from Europe arrived at Americanshores, there were millions of wild salmon in rivers from Maine to Connecticut.But now there are only a couple of thousand left. That is why this recentoutbreak of \"swim bladder sarcoma virus\" - seen only twice before in salmon - isespecially tragic. All the virus-infected fish came from Maine's Pleasant River.Biologists have quarantined hatcheries there and have had to kill hundreds ofdiseased salmon. Some scientists speculate that the virus has spread fromcommercial salmon farms along Maine's coast where every year thousands offish escape from their crowded holding pens. Just as humans crowded togethercan spread disease more easily, those commercial fish carry diseases to wildsalmon that have no immunity. Another disease has been destroying birds on the West Coast. One of the worstoutbreaks of Avian cholera in memory has killed more than 50,000 water birdsin Northern and Central California -- including the rare and beautiful AleutianCanada Geese that are already on the federal threatened species list.Fortunately, bird cholera is not typically transmitted to humans or othermammals. Scientists speculate that last month's cold weather caused birds toflock together in tight spaces of open water which may have spread the disease -just like the salmon crowded in those Maine commercial fisheries. The American Association for the Advancement of Science met the end ofJanuary in Anaheim, California. Biologist James Porter, professor of Ecologyand Marine Sciences at the University of Georgia, presented the latest findingsabout coral disease and death in the Florida Keys. Between 1996 and 1998,there was a 446 percent increase in disease at 160 coral sites along the Floridacoast. One reef experienced a death rate of 62%! Dr. Porter said that: \"nearly allof the killing pathogens are new to science. Corals are like the canary in themine. They are telling us that the water where they live is becoming sub optimalfor their existence. We don't know if what we are seeing is a natural cycle or if itis being caused by what human beings are doing to the planet.\"Dr. Porter also said that about 10% of the coral worldwide has died and ifpresent trends and conditions continue, an additional 20 to 30 percent of theworld's coral could be lost. New studies show that human viruses migrate intoFlorida coastal waters from the 1.6 million septic tanks in the state. Researchconfirms that within 24 hours of toilets being flushed, viruses and pathogensfrom those toilets are in the coastal waters. Many people are becoming infectedwith viruses and bacteria while playing in the ocean. And this septic tankpollution might also be related to the increase in the killing pathogens that havenot been seen ravaging coral before.Louisiana newspaper headlines this week were about, \"Dying blackbirds rain"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"down on north Louisiana town\" in the thousands. The facts are: the birds weregrackles, not red-winged blackbirds. Thousands of grackles were on their normalmigration south, but the official Louisiana Dept. of Wildlife and Fisheries andDept. of Agriculture counted the dead birds at only about 500, not thousands.What caused the grackles to drop into yards unable to walk, stretching andtwisting their heads back before dying, as residents in Morehouse Parishreported? See interview with Veterinarian Epidemiologist Simon Shane below.In California, Associated Press reported recently that a mysterious substancewas discovered in two natural springs in the Whiskeytown National Recreationarea about six miles west of Redding. One of the men who discovered thestrange stuff is Bud Ivey, Chief of Natural Resource Management at theWhiskeytown National Recreation Area. I asked him to describe it. Interviews:1) Whiskeytown Mystery SubstanceBud Ivey, Chief of Natural Resource Management, Whiskeytown NationalRecreation Area: \"OK, you're looking at a mass of stuff and if you think of hairon a dog's back and expand the size of hair to like 1/16th of an inch and 1 1/2inches long, whitish, eggshell color - these are attached into the bottom of thissoil and they're filamentous and in the stream of flowing water.When you put your hand in the water and touched it, what did it feel like?Like a little slime or barely perceptible to touch - very fragile.Did it disappear where you tried to touch it?You could actually lift it out, pick it out with your fingers, but then it lookedkind of like cotton, real fine.In the waater, did it make the stream look pure white for five or six feet?For a few feet. In other areas, it didn't attach and you could see the soil beneathit.Have you ever seen anything like this before?No.What is the weird stuff?Three different labs determined it's a bacterium that gets its energy by takingelectrons from hydrogen sulfide. It can only grow in water that has no oxygen.The Whiskeytown Springs have so much hydrogen sulfide you can smell itwhere the springs come out of the ground. And the water is so ancient, it's called\"fossil water,\" dating back to the last ice age.But why did the bacteria show up now?We had a fair sized earthquake on Thanksgiving day. Is this organism the resultof earthquake activity? Could it be related to volcanic activity? There's a lot oftalk in our regional area. So they thought there might be a link there.Do you mean the hydrogen sulfide could be related to some kind ofvolcanic activity set off by the earthquake?That's possible. Or it could have been there all the time. I think the site wherewe found this stuff occurs on a naturally occurring and known site called theHoagley Fault. We have other areas where we smell that hydrogen sulfide alongthe fault. And we have some other spring flows."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"So this could be related to the fact that the earthquake might have jostledsomething that released more hydrogen sulfide into this spring than hadbeen released before and that's why you found it?Could be. Could be. Or it's been there for a long time and we didn't see it. Ireally don't know.\"2) Grackel Deaths in LouisianaOne possible answer came this week from Dr. Simon Shane, Professor inthe Dept. of Epidemiology and Community Health at the School ofVeterinary Medicine, Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. Dr.Shane has been on a team that has examined several of the dead grackles.Simon Shane, D.V.M., Professor in the Dept. of Epidemiology andCommunity Health at the School of Veterinary Medicine, Louisiana StateUniversity, Baton Rouge, Louisiana: \"There was no consistent bacterialinfection. The microscopic examinations failed to show any signs which couldbe consistent with a bacterial or viral disease and again, subsequent toxicscreens and examination of liver, kidney, muscle tissue, failed to reveal thepresence of any toxin.So, I came to the conclusion that what we were looking at here and in view ofthe fact that only a small percentage of the flock was involved, we were actuallylooking at birds that were dying of hypoglycemia, low blood sugar, and thesequence would be that these were immature birds making their first migration.If you remember that about 10 to 12 days ago, there was a very serious weatherdisturbance involving the southeast and extending northeastwards with very highwind and rain in fact, I think the storm spawned some tornadoes that causedsome serious damage. I believe that the birds that were affected are the out flyersin the migration, the later birds, they were very severely buffeted and strained bythe weather. And when they came in, they were devoid of any fat or energyreserves, went down on the ground, did not eat and they died.In any migration there will be a % of birds that will die and in view of the factthat this is only appx. 400 to 500 out of twenty to thirty thousand birds that'snot an excessive amount. What I think might have happened is that we may havehad a clustering affect of these birds and instead of these 400 or 500 that diedbeing spread out over a large area of uninhabited land, we may have had a fewcoming down or clustering in areas where people would see them and pick themup. But I personally do not regard this as a disease problem or a toxicity, basedon the small number of birds involved, based on the complete absence of anylesions, the absence of any infected organism and the absence of any toxin thatwe could find in them.How often have you in your work in veterinarian medicine heard of caseswhere birds suffered these kinds of deaths from low blood sugar?There are parallels in poultry where chickens with low blood sugar will showpretty much the same nervous clinical changes.Were you able to make any analysis of the blood in these birds todetermine if in fact they were hypoglycemic?No, unfortunately, all the birds I had looked at that have come in have beendead birds.In your practice, have you ever seen grackles suffer this kind of die offbefore from a low blood sugar?No, this particular connection has never been made. But I do know that gracklesdie off as well as many other birds die off during migration. It's the weak onesthat die."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Right now it is a hypothesis of low blood sugar causing the bird deathsduring migration, but you are not absolutely certain?Yes, but I do know that when birds suffer low blood sugar, they will showclinical signs consistent with the descriptions that have been provided.
