There wasalso a ringed circle 82 feet in diameter. The formation was cut straight across atthe edge of the field as shown in the diagram.Fourteen days later on September 20, the two smaller circle shown in the blackand white diagram below were added. Their diameters were six feet and ninefeet. All of the patterns that appeared September 6 and 20 were swirledcounterclockwise.

Three circles in straight line with diameters of 18 feet, 18feet and 14 feet.12) September 14 One Mile East of Midale, Saskatchewan, Canada.Wheat. Ring 125 feet in diameter in same field with 50 foot diameter circlesurrounded by two rings.13) September 20 South of Midale, Saskatchewan, Canada.Wheat.

Flattened circle irregularly shaped 63 feet in diameter one way and 59feet diameter another. Inside was a circle of standing crop, 6 feet in diameter andtwenty feet from the flattened perimeter.Interview:Researcher and surveyor Judy Arndt talked with me the day after she and herhusband traveled to the formation of seven circles discovered within theEdmonton, Alberta city limits on September 21st. The farmer did not want thespecific location made public. The crop is barley heavily infested with thistleswhich Judy said were quite painful to walk through and made the survey verydifficult.Formation in thistle-infested barley discovered September 21, 1999 nearEdmonton, Alberta, Canada.

There is a 36-foot diameter circle. And attached to that a 19-footdiameter circle.Now on the south end is almost the mirror image of that sort of slightly south,southeast a 33 foot diameter circle and another 19 foot diameter circle attachedto that. So the whole thing looks like an S-curve through the (large circle).There are two satellite circles on either side on the other axis and they are each33 feet in diameter. There is only about 2 feet of standing crop between thesatellite circles and the big circle.HOW WOULD YOU COMPARE THIS CROP LAY TO EARLIERFORMATIONS?The lay in every one of these circles is radial that is, it's splayed out from thecenter to the perimeter.THERE IS NOT A TWIST TO IT? IT' IS STRAIGHT?That's right. This is barley and very strange it looks like there has been a hugeamount of energy to lay this down this way. And the thistle is tough and it's laidright down, too, although there are some standing tufts there. It looks so messy.But when you get down and look at what's under the thistle and under theheads, there is all this crop laying right close to the ground.YOU SAID THE ACADIA CIRCLE HAD A FLAT LAY, BUT WITH ALLTHOSE SINGLE STANDING STEMS?Ye s .WOULD THIS ONE NOW (EDMONTON) BE SLOPPIER LOOKINGTHAN THE LARGE ACADIA ONE?In Acadia Valley the standing stems were completely upright as though theyweren't leaning over. A lot of the standing crop in this one (Edmonton) is notstanding way up. It's leaning slightly. I would say it's not as good condition, notstanding as tall as the stuff in Acadia Valley.SINCE IT LOOKS SO SLOPPY, IS THE QUICK JUDGMENT TODISMISS IT AS SOME KIND OF HOAX?I think a lot of people have dismissed it as a hoax. But, I should also mentionthat there is an extremely high percentage of very elongated nodes in the barley.There's some wild oats in there and a lot of expulsion cavities in the nodes of thewild oats.Photograph © 1999 by Judy Arndt, Edmonton, Alberta."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"BUT YOU DIDN'T FIND ANY EXPULSION EFFECTS ON THEBARLEY?We haven't done that thorough a search of all the nodes yet, but generally theyare just elongated. They are kind of thinned and darkened and elongated.HOW WOULD YOU COMPARE THE NODES BETWEEN ACADIAVALLEY AND EDMONTON?The Acadia ones were quite blown out laterally. This (Edmonton) was more juststretched and often thinned out, too. They appear like a rubber band when it'sstretched and gets thinner.And in terms of difficulty, the thistles were thick and I would say it would bevery difficult to do this formation because it was all laid out radially. And howdo you leave all these little tufts even if you were trying to do it by hand? Andanybody would have seen something happening, some vandalism in the field, Iwould think.BECAUSE IT'S SO CLOSE TO AN URBAN CENTER?Ye a h .IT' IS SURROUNDED BY HOUSES?There are major roads on two sides of that quarter and there are acreages alongone side of it and some woods on the other side. There is constant traffic on twosides of it.SO THE MOST OUTSTANDING ANOMALIES ARE THE RADIAL LAYIN EACH OF THE CIRCLES AND THE FACT THAT IT''S IN THISTLEAND THAT UNDERNEATH THE THISTLE AND SOME OF THEPLANTS STANDING LOOSELY, THE REST OF IT WAS LAYINGVERY FLAT TO THE GROUND?That's right. It wasn't all perfectly radial. Once in awhile we found a strip of cropcoming back the other direction, the opposite direction. And then sometimesthere would be a piece that almost looked like a straight part in hair with plantsgoing 180 degrees away from each other. When you look at the center of one ofthese circles, it's like if you put a blow dryer on your hair when you're dryingyour hair and it all splays out in all directions - it just seems like something hasenergy that came from the center and blew everything out to the sides.One more thing I need to tell you about the Edmonton formation. In the centerof the northern most circle - that's one of the small ones - there was a hole. Ifyou imagine a tetrahedron upside down - that is four triangles making a 3-sidedpyramid. This one is about six by five inches on each side. And we had a smallstick there and I stuck a stick down the hole and there is loose soil down thecenter for eighteen inches, as though there was a pole or lightning or somethinghas gone down. Three sort of splits in the soil in three directions from this.There was a head of barley, beards down in the loose soil in the center of thisthing. So, it looked to us like the plant had fallen in there and some soil hadfallen in on top of it. It would be interesting to dig down there and see ifsomething iron is there or inserted there. I'll try to get soil samples for the BLTResearch Team.HAD ANYONE SEEN ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN THE SKY?No, but around the time the formation appeared, the woman herself sawsomething unusual about 6 miles north. She said one night, she and her husbandwere driving and there was this brilliant white light in front of them. It just filledtheir whole field of vision and then was gone.\"We b s it e s :1) Judy Arndt's Web Site: http://www.CropCircleQuest.com/2) Paul Anderson, Director, Canadian Crop Circle Research Network (CCCRN)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"http://www.geocities.com/cropcirclecanada3) Largest Crop Circle Archive: http://www.cropcircleconnector.comCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
