And the puzzlesoutweigh the answers.1) First, University of Maine astronomer David Batuski described the largeststructures ever seen in the universe. To help understand what the structure lookslike, imagine a string of 14 pearls. But each pearl is flattened more like apancake. Each flattened pearl is actually a cluster of hundreds, perhapsthousands, of galaxies. And within each galaxy are millions of suns.The length of this string of clustered galaxies is somewhere between half abillion to a billion light years. And this pearl strand might be connected toanother equally as long. If so, it means those two strings of galaxies couldstretch for nearly 2 billion light years. If our universe is 16 billion light years indiameter -- these enormous structures of connected galaxies stretch through atleast one-eighth of the entire universe. And there might be even more of them.In fact, some astronomers are referring to it as the \"skeleton of the universe.\"Astronomer Batuski called the structures \"imprints of the Big Bang\" andexplained they grew from lumps in the primordial soup of matter and energy thatmade up the universe soon after creation.If stars formed first out of the primordial soup, followed by galaxies, thenclusters and finally these super strings of clustered galaxies -- a question thatpuzzles scientists is: How could all this have happened in only 16 billion yearsafter the Big Bang?2) Compounding the puzzle of galaxy formations are \"ghost galaxies\" -- largeglobes of gasses with very few visible stars. Astronomer John Kormendy at theUniversity of Hawaii says he has seen a number of the nearly invisible galaxiesand has noticed a pattern: the dim galaxies are more abundant than bright ones,and the darkest are the most abundant. If Dr. Kormendy's observations areaccurate, then the majority of galaxies in the universe would be invisible andcould help explain one of the most enduring mysteries in astronomy: darkmatter. No one knows exactly what dark matter is, but over the last 30 yearsscientists have determined that the dim stuff makes up about half of the totalmass of our own Milky Way Galaxy. And at least 90% of the entire universe.But what is it and why is it there?The astronomer who first proposed dark matter based on her own observationsmore than 25 years ago is Dr. Vera Rubin at the Carnegie Institution inWashington, D. C. She told the Astronomical Society, \"We're in a black roomdoing an all-black puzzle. And we don't even know where all the pieces are.\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Rufus Baughn and Nevada Test SiteNow, an update on one of my reports in December 1998. I interviewed a mannamed Glen Pace who worked in the Diagnostic Photographic Department basedat Camp Mercury on the Nevada Atomic Test Site about 65 miles north of LasVegas between the years 1961 and 1963. His colleague was an aerialphotographer named Rufus Baughn. Glen Pace had played cards with Krauseand a man identified as working for MJ-12 on extraterrestrial-related projects.The MJ-12 man told Krause and Pace that \"Truman had set MJ-12 up when hewas President because of the UFOs and all the stuff in the 1940s and early1950s -- and in that situation, some group of people had to have control of themilitary and the United States that would not have to get Congressionalapproval.\"When Glen Pace told Otto Krause about dozens of silver discs he and his fatherand others had seen fly over Farmington, New Mexico in 1948 and a localnewspaper story about a crashed disc in a canyon near Aztec in 1952, theGerman scientist acknowledged there were extraterrestrial craft and that the firstretrieval of a disc was BEFORE Roswell back in the early 1940s from theOzarks.In the recent release of new MJ-12 documents by Bob and Ryan Wood there isinformation about a 1941 disc retrieval in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. Accordingto one document, a nuclear propulsion device was discovered and applied to theManhattan Project's atomic bomb development. Glen Pace said Rufus Baughncould corroborate their employment at the Test Site as diagnostic photographersand their trips to Area 12 overlooking the highly classified Area 51 near GroomLake. This week I talked with Rufus Baughn: Interview:WHAT YEARS WERE YOU AT THE CAMP MERCURY LOCATION?I was there from 1962-1967.AND IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME, DID YOU WORK WITH GLENPACE ALL OF THOSE YEARS?Glen Pace and I had worked together in Albuquerque. I had been doing aerialmapping in Albuquerque for a private engineering and aerial consulting firmafter I got out of the service. And that's where I met Glen. He came to work thereas a photo lab person and we got to be friends. And another person who workedwith us went out and interviewed for a job at the test site as a photographer andcame back and said they were looking for another photographer. So Glen and Iboth went out there and interviewed with Lawrence Radiation Laboratory (LRL)that was at the test site from Livermore, California. I was lucky enough to get thefirst job. I think it was because I had a background in aerial photography fromthe service. And then shortly thereafter, Glen was hired by LRL and he and hisfamily moved out to Las Vegas.There were times when we had binoculars in the top of Area 12 or the highestpoints in Area 12 we could see portions of Area 51 in the distance. And I knowat night there were a lot of lights and activity and movements there, but to behonest with you, I didn't -- I wouldn't know an alien craft if I saw one.I know the name Otto Krause came up. Glen and I had worked with him orphotography and documentation for him and other physicists.DO YOU REMEMBER IF THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH OTTOKRAUSE WERE ABOUT EXTRATERRESTRIALS?Some of that stuff bounced around. I don't know whether it was with Otto. But Iknow that extraterrestrials and aliens and spaceships and things like that fromtime to time did come up, but whether it was specifically with Otto, I don't"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"know. It's been, God, decades, so I don't know.Like I said, Area 51 was probably the most secretive or Top Secret area that Iknew of at the Test Site and I knew there weren't a lot of people who were privyto information about that area. There were only certain people who did go outthere. Just because you had a security clearance and were on the test site didn'tmean that you had access to Area 51. As I said, when I was out at the test site,everything was classified. Whatever went on as far as the test site, when youwere at work, it was classified. I knew people who -- we'd go into Las Vegas andparty. I knew people who would go into Las Vegas and sit down at a bar in oneof the hotels or in a restaurant and someone would come up and sit down andchit chat with them, and if they said something that was classified, the person --there were several occasions that people had pulled out security badges -- I don'tknow if they were FBI or what they were -- and said that these people hadbreached security. So, I think most of the people out at the test site when I wasout there were pretty closed mouths.WHEN YOU AND GLEN PACE WERE WORKING AT THE NEVADATEST SITE AND AREA 12 AND 51 AND SO FORTH, WHAT KIND OFCARS WERE PROVIDED TO YOU FOR TRANSPORTATION?You mean the make?YEAH. DO YOU REMEMBER?We had Ford Falcons at that time was the car type -- we also had Ford trucksand Dodge pickup trucks.NOW IN -- YOU WERE THERE FROM 1962-1967. THAT OVERLAPSTHE PERIOD OF THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION BEFORE HEWAS ASSASSINATED. GLEN PACE SAID THAT IN THAT CARDGAME WITH OTTO KRAUSE AND THE MAN IDENTIFIED AS FROMMJ-12, THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FACT THATPRESIDENT KENNEDY WAS GOING TO VISIT THE TEST SITE ANDTHAT THE MJ-12 REPRESENTATIVE SAID THEY WERE NOTGOING TO ALLOW HIM TO SEE AREA 51. DO YOU REMEMBERTHAT DISCUSSION?No, maam, I do not. I remember that Pres. Kennedy did come out and visited thetest site. I also remember that while we were out on station for an \"event\" asthey called them -- waiting for an event to happen -- we got the notice pluggedin all over the test site and we were waiting on station that Kennedy had beenassassinated. More Information:I asked Rufus Baughn about the cars at the Test Site because Glen Paceincorrectly said \"Pintos\" in the first interview, but then called me back right afterthe broadcast to say he realized he should have said Ford Falcons. I have alsofound more information about the Cape Girardeau, Missouri incident in a lettersent to investigator Raymond Fowler and re-printed in a \"UFO Crash Retrieval\"report by Len Stringfield in July 1991.The letter was from a woman named Charlette Mann about her grandfather,Reverent William Huffman. In the spring of 1941, the Cape Girardeau PoliceDepartment asked him to go to a plane crash outside town. The letter goes on:\"He said they drove out of town 13-15 miles or so, then parked the cars on theside of the road and had to walk 1/4 of a mile or so into a field where he couldsee fire burning.\"Grandfather said it wasn't an airplane or like any craft he'd ever seen. It wasbroken and scattered all around, but one large piece was still together and itappeared to have a rounded shape with no edges or seams. It had a very shinymetallic finish. You could see inside one section and see what looked like ametal chair with a panel with many dials and gauges -- none familiar looking to"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"him. He said that when he got there, men were already sifting through things.There were some police officers, plain clothes people and military men.\"There were three bodies no human that had been taken from the wreckage andlaid on the ground. Grandfather said prayers over them so he got a close look,but didn't touch them. He didn't know what had killed them because they didn'tappear to have any injuries and they weren't burnt. It was hard for him to tell ifthey had on suits or if it was their skin, but they were covered head to foot inwhat looked like wrinkled aluminum foil. He could see no hair on the bodiesand they had no ears. They were small framed like a child about 4 feet tall, buthad larger heads and longer arms. They had very large oval shaped eyes, nonoses just holes and no lips, just small slits for mouths.\"Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
