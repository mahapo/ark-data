S. government is very concerned about biologicalwarfare and bioterrorists. What would happen if anthrax spores, small pox orother dangerous infectious diseases were sprayed into the air above one or moreAmerican cities?One new possible answer seems surprisingly simple and miraculously effective:drops of oil droplets so small they can adhere to the surface of deadly anthraxand small pox pathogens and literally explode the germs. That's why these oildrops are called \"nano bombs.\" Nano means \"one billionth.\" Smaller thanviruses and bacteria.This medical discovery is the work of Dr. James Baker, Professor of Medicine,Chief of the Division of Allergy and Immunology, and Director of the Center forBiologic Nanotechnology at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Hedevelops extremely small lipids and polymers that can be engineered at theprotein and amino acid level.The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as DARPA, startedtrying five years ago to find new ways to deal with bioterrorism. And for the lasttwo years, DARPA has funded Dr. Baker's research into blowing up germs with awater and oil mixture in which the oil droplets are 1/100th the size of a humanblood cell.Interview:James Baker, M. D., Director of the Center for Biologic Nanotechnology,University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan: \"Essentially we've taken anold time observation that you could basically use detergent to disrupt bacteriaand viruses and put a new spin on it. What we've done is actually encapsulatethe detergent as a layer on the outside of oil droplets suspended in water. Andbecause of the exact nature of this material, it very readily fuses with bacteriaand viruses and delivers the detergent and the solvent on its surface to thebacteria and virus. This then causes a disruption of the membrane surroundingthe bacteria and virus so it becomes unstable and literally explodes.WHY IS IT THAT THE DROPLETS THAT BIND TO THE MEMBRANECOATING ON THE GERMS OR VIRUSES - WHY IS IT THAT ITDISRUPTS THE COATING SO MUCH THAT THESE ORGANISMSLITERALLY EXPLODE?Well, there are two reasons for that. The first, and probably the most importantis that the droplets are very small. They are actually on the same scale or smallerthan the bacteria and virus.COULD YOU PLEASE GIVE A WORD PICTURE FOR A RADIOAUDIENCE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS OILY WATERSUBSTANCE COULD BE USED IF THERE WAS AN ANTHRAX DROPOR DISPERSION IN THE AIR, LET'S SAY, OVER A CITY."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"All right, let me give you a specific scenario that's been actually in the news.They held a mock attack in one of the subway stations in New York City. Theproblem was that both materials such as the train, the station and individualswere exposed. Currently, the only way to decontaminate is to use very highconcentrations of formaldehyde and bleach - which number one, are verydestructive to material, will probably ruin any type of paint or fabric orelectrical type device in the area. And obviously are very toxic to human beings.So, there is no real way to decontaminate the area safely and to decontaminatethe people safely.This material can be used in a number of ways. It kills up to a dilution of 1:100.And at 1:100, it literally looks like skim milk and has about the sameconsistency and you could put it in a sprayer type device and literally spraydown the whole station, the whole car, and within an hour or two, you couldeven spray it again. But within an hour or two about 99.9% of the spores havebeen killed.ALL OF THE ANTHRAX SPORES WILL HAVE EXPLODED FROMTHIS OILY WATER.Right. In addition, you can take the people who have been exposed and alsotreat them topically to decontaminate them. If there are wounds that arecontaminated, you can take this material and irrigate in the wounds. So, in fact,you can go in and decontaminate people as well as the environment. And infact, by reducing the number of spores that are on people or are inhaled bypeople, you can go a long way in preventing the toxicity and the deathassociated with anthrax.DOES THIS ALSO WORK ON THINGS LIKE CHOLERA AND LET'SSAY SOME OF THE BLOOD HEMORRHAGING EBOLA TYPE OFTHING?Yes, it does. So in fact, you could use it in a situation where you don't evenknow what's been released. And have the expectation that 99% of the potentialorganisms that might be used as a weapon would be inactivated.HOW ARE YOU GOING TO INTERFACE NOW WITH MILITARYAND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES?We are progressing through the Military Development Command, the MaterielCommand, to perform field trials for the military this fall to evaluate thismaterial as a decontamination agent.AND THIS WOULD BE UNDER DARPA'S SUPERVISION?No, this will be under the supervision of the U. S. Army Research andDevelopment Command. I think we have very good data in small scaledecontamination studies in our own laboratory that this material will beaffective. The real issue now is how to translate it into some type of workablesolution. I'm embarrassed to admit this, but we use garden sprayers and powerpainters to apply it. It's actually a very simplistic approach, but very effective.The military may want to use larger scale decontamination application situationsfor things like airplanes and other potential equipment that would be involved.THAT WOULD SPEED UP THE PROCESS OF SPRAYING THE OILYWATER.Exactly.ASSUME THAT YOUR TRIALS WITH THE ARMY IN THE FALL OF1999 GO WELL AND THE OILY WATER IS EFFECTIVE IN THEFIELD OPERATION. WOULD YOU IMAGINE THAT IF THERE WAS ATERRORIST AEROSOL DISPERSION LET'S SAY OVER NEW YORKCITY THAT THE ARMY OR DARPA OR SOMEBODY COULD COMEIN WITH AIRPLANES TO DROP THE OILY WATER ALL OVER THECITY FROM THE AIR?That is one potential scenario, yes. I mean, you need to get good coverage. Youneed to make sure you get an appropriate layer of this material to interact with"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"the organisms. But certainly, the most remarkable thing is that this doesn't hurtthe environment, doesn't hurt people and gives kill rates that are equivalent tobleach or formaldehyde. So, where you couldn't do that with any of the otheragents available to treat this type of infection, anthrax, you could potentially doit with this material. You can go into a school and wash down children safely orgo into an office and wash down wherever the letter was dropped or whateverand effectively take care of it and put people's minds at ease without having toput them in danger just from trying to clean up the place.HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE BEFORE THIS IS BEINGPRODUCED ON A LARGE SCALE FOR ANTICIPATION OF ANYTYPE OF A BIOTERRORISM ATTACK?We have the capability to produce approximately 1600 liters/minute.THERE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN?With one of our commercial associates. So we are already up to industrial sizedproduction. The real limitation will be developing the lines of command andmaterial transfer so that in that type of scenario, we can rapidly deploy thematerial. But it's very stable. We could storehouse it even in the concentratewhich would reduce the volume needed and have it ready to go if something likethat were to happen.IT WOULD BE AFFECTIVE AGAINST ANTHRAX, CHOLERA, SMALLPOX - IS THERE ANY BACTERIA OR VIRUS YOU'VE TRIED IT ONTHAT IT DOESN'T WORK?Yes. Non-envelope viruses. Things like adenovirus.WHICH WOULD BE WHAT IN THE COMMON LANGUAGE?Cold.IT WILL NOT WORK AGAINST THE COLD VIRUS?Well, adenovirus is one form of cold virus, yes. But most of the agents that causesevere diseases and are used as weaponized agents are envelope viruses orbacteria.MEANING THE ENVELOPE IS WHAT CAN MERGE WITH THISSOAPY OR OILY WATER?Right.WHY COULDN'T THIS SAME NANO APPROACH BE APPLIED TOINTERNAL MEDICINE THAT COULD KILL VIRUSES ANDBACTERIA INSIDE PEOPLE?Well, it can be used on mucosal surfaces. And in fact, one of the applications weare looking at is using it as a nasal spray where you would put it in your noseduring flu season and if you inhaled flu virus, it would destroy it before it couldinfect you. The one problem with the material - there are a couple of problemsand let me make those very specific for you. The first is that under certainconditions, it is unstable. You can't freeze it because that causes the separationof the oil and water phases. So, for some applications that require coldtemperatures, it's unsuitable.In addition, you can't give it intravenously because it turns out the only cell thatis susceptible to this material is the red blood cell. Every other cell is resistant.So, you can't give it intravenously.BECAUSE THEN ALL THE BLOOD CELLS WOULD EXPLODE.Right. You could take plasma or infected wounds and whatever and irrigate it.And we have very nice animal studies that suggest with anthrax or with gasgangrene or the flesh-eating bacteria, we can actually have an effect inpreventing wound infections by irrigating the wound with this material. So, thereare internal applications where it can be used. It just can't be used systemicallybecause of the problem with red blood cells.\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund PolicyCopyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
