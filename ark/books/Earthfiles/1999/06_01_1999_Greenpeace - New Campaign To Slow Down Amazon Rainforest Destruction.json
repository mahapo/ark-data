C. This week, Greenpeace has launched aworldwide campaign against loggers who are cutting down ancient forestsillegally, especially Brazil's Amazon rainforest. Greenpeace Executive Director,Thilo Bode, announced in Rio de Janeiro on May 31st that \"this is the mostimportant campaign and also the largest. If we are successful, we can dosomething very important for the planet. It is certainly the most difficultcampaign we have ever had.\" Bode pointed out that 70% of the Amazon'sdeforestation is caused by loggers - and most of them have no legal right to cutthe trees down. Another fact is that half a dozen large corporations in Europe,Asia and the United States control more than 12% of the Amazon's timber-processing capacity and about half of the export value.Once upon a time in the 1960's, the Amazon rainforest covered about 4 millionsquare kilometers and represented one-third of the world's remaining tropicalforests still intact. But since 1970, 15% of that rainforest has been cut down.And in the last decade, the destruction rate has been 1% each year as farmersslash and burn and loggers cut for profit and ignore recent Brazilian governmentrestrictions. Since 1995 alone, an area the size of the Netherlands, Belgium andLuxembourg combined has been deforested.Today, I talked with Scott Paul, Forest Policy Specialist, and Head of the ForestCampaign for Greenpeace USA. I also interviewed Christoph Thies,International Coordinator for the Greenpeace Forest Campaign. The main focusof our discussion was what new campaign strategy Greenpeace now has to slowdown destruction of the Amazon rainforest.Interview:Scott Paul, Forest Policy Specialist, Greenpeace USA, Washington, D. C.:\"We want to develop a world where the forest products that are harvested withappropriate environmental and social standards are rewarded in the marketplace. And that forest products that have resulted in the utter destruction of aforest that's 10,000 (years old) in some situations - and if they are turning thoseforest products into literally - I'm not joking - toilet paper, phone books, toothpaste and shampoos in the forms of cellulose ethers that give toothpaste andshampoos their kind of, holds them together, gives them their quality. It goesinto cake mix, in some situations we have found forest products that go intoammunition filling. I don't think you should cut down an old tree to use for aproduct that will be used once and then disposed of.I THINK THERE ALSO IS A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION: DO WEWANT TO BE CUTTING DOWN ANY OF THESE ANCIENT FORESTSAT AL L ?Our position - the World Resources Institute has estimated that approximately20% of the earth's original ancient forests remain in large enough chunks that"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"they can support their normal range of animals and species that live there.ONLY 20%.Only 20% of the earth's original forests remain in chunks large enough tosupport these populations. There are forests all over the place, but largely, theyare secondary forests and secondary forests cannot be home to the large, vastmajority of biodiversity. Sure, deer, rabbits and squirrels can live in them. Butwhen you are talking about wolves and bears and moose and different fungus,the whole, insects - you need a mature forest to house all that. So, we're tryingsome how to separate out the last remaining what we call ancient forests and oldgrowth forests - essentially the same thing, although ancient is a more accurateterm. We're trying to get people to distinguish between the ancient forest and allthe secondary forests - they are not the same thing and cannot be treated thesame. And if you want to go hammer a secondary forest to make toilet paper orphone books, I still have a problem with that, but I have a much greater problemif you're going to hammer one of the last pristine temperate rainforests on earthin order to make a phone book.The philosophy behind the market's campaign is that Greenpeace believesconsumers have the right to know whether the products they buy have comefrom a well-managed forest that's still there or from a devastated Brazilianrainforest. So, the right to know is the fundamental concept behind what we callthe markets campaign. Instead of going to the company that is logging, we go tothe company that's buying. Typically they have a household name and they aremore willing to listen to us and say, \"I can buy from Person A instead of PersonB, easy. And if you're telling me that Person B is destroying the last Brazilianrainforest on earth, then I don't want that either.\" International GreenpeaceChristoph Thies, International Coordinator, Greenpeace ForestCampaign, Amsterdam, Netherlands: \"The key question I think is to findalternatives for the Amazon people, for the people who live in the Amazon tomake a living with activities which do not destroy the forest and that could beall, the whole sector of non-wood extraction like nuts and fruits or ecologicalfishing - there are a lot of waterways - and also the careful development ofecological tourism and possibly also some small scale activities and ecologicallogging will be part of the package. So, there is not one solution - the answer isthere must be a diversity of solutions.HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY CHANGE THE THINKING OFFARMERS IN THE AMAZONIAN REGION TO VALUING THE RAINFOREST FOR THE NUTS AND THE FRUITS AND THE MEDICINESTHAT THEY CAN PROVIDE INSTEAD OF BURNING THEM DOWN?One issue is to show them there is a chance they can also make an income, makea living without either being involved in destructive logging or converting theforest into farm land.BUT HOW DO YOU DO THAT? THAT'S MY QUESTION.A key part is to influence the market demand. There will be an increaseddemand for products from the Amazon which do not lead to its destruction, andpeople around the world increasingly refusing products which come from thedestruction of the forest.SO HOW WILL GREENPEACE ACTUALLY EXECUTE WHAT SEEMSLIKE A GOOD IDEA? THERE'S A LONG GAP BETWEEN WORDSAND ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY GETTING SOMETHING DONE.Well, I can't explain you in every detail now, but we will definitely use our year"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"long experience with the market place with the big consumers of products fromthe forest. And use that market force to get people to favor products which areAmazon-friendly and which do not lead to the destruction. We have a lot ofcontacts in Europe, the U. S. and increasingly in Japan and East Asia and a lotdepends on changed market demand.WHAT IS IT THAT THILO BODE, THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OFGREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL, IS TRYING TO DO RIGHT NOWIN RIO DE JANEIRO?Well, this week we have announced our project and it will be lead by RobertoKishinami, the Executive Director of Greenpeace Brazil because this project isvery much Brazil-driven and has a lot of international support. That's why ThiloBode is there. And we have been releasing there yesterday a report on theactivities of the logging industry in Brazilian Amazon selective companies. Also,we released a critique of the pilot program of the G-7 countries to help theAmazon. We still want the continuation of this program, but it has to be mademore meaningful on the ground to stop deforestation and forest destruction. Andlast but not least, we are releasing a project which involves a new technology ofrubber processing that has a chance to increase the income of rubber tappers asone example of non-wood use of the forest.A NON-WOOD USE. AND IS THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENTACTUALLY ALLIED NOW WITH GREENPEACE ON THIS EFFORTOR NOT?Well, we have seen quite a change in the attitude of the Brazilian government.We have been welcomed and had arranged a meeting with the President ofBrazil and also the Environment Minister and at least in part of the governmentwe can see a change of attitude. Of course, we remain cautious and we don'tbelieve everything that is written on paper or what people are telling us. Wewant to see the changes on the ground. But the assessment is that we see somepotential for more cooperation and stronger political will also on the side of thefederal government in Brazil. What remains a big problem is the government ofthe different Amazonian states.THAT ARE BASICALLY ACTING COMPLETELY INDEPENDENTAND ON THEIR OWN AND ALLOWING PEOPLE TO SLASH ANDBURN.Exactly. They have still a lot of local control and they still play very much inthe favor of those who are currently destroying the Amazon - namely, thelogging industry, but also the mining industry and the expansion of theagriculture industry into soy bean plantations and cattle ranching.WELL, IS THE GOVERNMENT OF BRAZIL PREPARED TO TAKEFEDERAL TROOPS NOW INTO THE RAINFOREST TO STOP THEILLEGAL BURNING?We haven't been told any concrete steps by the federal government, but what weat least heard is that they support the ideas on a very general level and what theconcrete steps will be, remains to be seen. Another important role will be withthe G-7 countries. The G-7 last year in Birmingham decided to tackle illegallogging on a global scale as one of their global priorities in the field ofenvironment and we still want to see more action from the G-7 countries.SO IF WE COULD GET, BESIDES THE UNITED STATES ANDCANADA, IF WE COULD GET OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TOBASICALLY START REDUCING ANY TRADE WITH BRAZIL ONPRODUCTS THAT WERE AFFECTING THE RAINFORESTS, ITCOULD MAKE A BIG DENT IN THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENTREALIZING THAT THEY CAN'T ALLOW THIS ANYMORE."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"That's true. We think it needs, of course, international action. We still see as amatter of fact a very big part of all the logs - and that includes the illegal logging- ends up in G-7 countries. And if they really want to take that seriously, theyhave to stop importing them as a first step.\"More Information:If you want to help Greenpeace in their new campaign to slow down Amazonrainforest destruction, go to their Take Action section on their website.
