Thefarmer was havesting at night with spotlights and was shocked to discover thecurves, circles and corridors of this new pictogram in exactly the same place hefound another formation in mid-August 1997. This new one was lined up northto south with a 24-foot-diameter ring at the top connected by a long corridor toa large comma-shape. Fifty feet straight east of the comma was a small 6 footcircle, known as a \"grape shot.\" The entire formation was apparently crowned bya thin arc which the farmer had nearly obliterated in his night time harvestingbefore he realized the pictogram was there. All the circle, ring and arc plantswere laid down counter-clockwise, except for one small circle at the end of thecomma which was clockwise.Survey © 1999 by investigator Larry Thomas of Marion, New Yorksoybean formation discovered October 21, 1999.The investigator who has studied and sampled soil and grass from both the 1997and 1999 Marion pictograms is researcher and dowser, Larry Thomas ofNewark, New York. I asked Mr. Thomas how closely the 1999 and 1997formations lined up.Larry Thomas, Crop Circle Investigator, Newark, New York: \"I would haveto say this particular formation is virtually on top of the previous one. Thefarmer told me that he had a power failure occur somewhere around the timethat the latest circle here appeared."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"THAT'S BEEN REPORTED IN ENGLAND AS WELL. POWER FAILURESTHE NIGHT BEFORE A FORMATION HAS OCCURRED.I understand that. As a matter of fact, our video cameras both died on us whenwe were at the recent circle.YOUR VIDEO CAMERAS DIED? WERE 35MM CAMERAS ABLE TOOPERATE?Yes, they seemed to do OK. But for some reason both fully charged videocameras died. One died actually as we entered the circle. The other one whichwas mine gave us maybe five minutes or so of videotape.DID NEARBY RESIDENTS NOTICE ANY UNUSUAL LIGHTS OR AERIALOBJECTS?Well, Linda, not in the current 1999 formation, but they did see some things inthe 1997 formation.WHICH WAS IN OATS?Which was in oats.SAME FARM, SAME FIELD.Exact location, yes.Aerial photograph of August 1997 formation in Marion, New York oat field© 1997 by Larry Thomas, Newark, New York.

And she was walking her dog and she noticed a slighthumming noise and a bright light. She looked up and saw an object hoveringdirectly over the field where the crop circle was formed later. The object wasabout three cars wide and had a distinct overall appearance of an acorn in shape.It had a domed roof with a distinct ridge or band running around the center. Andit was about 500 yards from her when she witnessed it.THIS WAS SUSPENDED IN THE AIR NOT MOVING?That's correct. And I'd say the entire viewing probably took about twentyseconds before it shot off rapidly to the northeast.A lot of researchers can potentially find light ball activities around these kindsof formations, especially at night. It's not in the daytime. I know there have beena few sightings and videotapes taken over in England of balls of light floating orhovering around the crops. But what can be done is what I've done for sometime now which is to take photographs at night time over the crop circleformations. And when we take photos at night time, we almost invariably showspheres, some even geometric shapes, hovering or streaking across the formation.Larry Thomas used the flash on his 35mm camera to take photographsin the dark at the Marion, New York crop formation in oats, August 1997.In several images on different nights, white spheres that appear slightly translucentappeared.

LEVENGOOD AND TALKEDTO ME THIS WEEK ABOUT THE 1997 MARION FORMATION ANALYSESAND OTHER DISCOVERIES IN CROP FORMATION RESEARCH.Nancy Talbott, Coordinator, BLT Research Team, Cambridge,Massachusetts: \"That particular one revealed some very interesting findings.The disposition of the magnetic materials in the soils following this precisedistribution relative to distance. So, if you were sampling let's say the edge ofthe circle out into the standing crop, you got a drop in the amount of magneticmaterial in the soil that followed a nice curve as you moved farther and fartheraway from the formation itself.Red arrows indicate examples of the magnetic particles found in the soil of theAugust 1997 Marion, New York oats formation. Microscope photograph © 1997by W. C. Levengood, Ph.D., Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory, Grass Lake, Michigan.MEANING GETTING LESS AND LESS AS YOU GOT TO THEPERIMETER?Getting less and less as you got farther out into the standing crop. Furthermore,we also found in that particular event, there were three circles laid in a spiral lay- that means starting at the center and then spiraling outward to the edges ofthose circles. Two of the circles, however, were radically laid - that meansstarting at the center and flowing directly out to the perimeter, not spiraling, justgoing straight out to the edges. What we found was that - we sampled three ofthose circles, two spirals and one radial lay. And of those three, the two spiralcircles revealed a disposition of this magnetic material that fits the centrifugal,mathematical predictions of amounts that would be deposited according to thelaws of centrifugal force.MEANING THERE WOULD BE MORE GOING TO THE PERIMETER OFTHE CIRCLE?Correct. And that's exactly what was obtained there.BUT IN THE RADIAL LAY, IT WOULD BE WHERE THE ENERGY CAMEDOWN IN THE CENTER AND SPLAYED OUT, IT BECAME LESS."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Precisely.THE OPPOSITE.Precisely.ARE YOU SEEING ANYTHING IN THE YEAR 1999 YET FROM THEVARIOUS SAMPLES YOU HAVE DONE FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRYTHAT IS REINFORCING THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SOME KIND OFSPINNING PLASMA VORTEX WITH MICROWAVE AND ELECTRONICENERGY IS INTERACTING WITH THE PLANTS?I think the most stunning observation I have so far from this summer's work isthat plant samples which are arriving at the laboratory now - from the work thissummer - are by and large showing an energy signature, if you will - meaning theabnormal plant findings - the signature is much greater - it is more intense. Thenode lengths are visibly - you don't need a microscope to do the measurements.It is very clear. The number of expulsion cavities, the holes blown out at thenodes, absolutely massive. I saw them personally in four countries this summer.WHICH COUNTRIES?The Netherlands, England, the U. S. and Canada. I'm sure they are in othercountries. Those are the four I happened to be in and so I saw them. Thenumbers of these expulsion cavities and the degree- not just in the second node,but down in the third and fourth nodes - and whole areas just blown, the plantsalmost blown apart.In one of the cases we're working on in Montana, we have ...WHICH IS WHITEFISH.That's the Whitefish case.WHICH SORT OF LOOKS LIKE THE AMERICAN INDIAN SYMBOL FORTHE SUN.Yes. And looks very much like a formation that occurred there last summer butwhich was not sampled.AT MY WEB SITE I SHOW THE CONTRAST OF THE PHOTOS. THEY AREALMOST IDENTICAL AND THOSE FORMATIONS ARE LESS THAN FIVEMILES APART.(Sept. 9, 1999 earthfiles.com)Really. Well, the one this year was sampled and in that case what we're seeing isa number of very interesting things. The crimped at the base of the seed head,the petiole, which you observed in Avebury.IT HAD THAT TWISTED LOOK.Yep, in the so-called manmade one at Avebury. That same effect was found allover the place in this Montana case. In addition to a crimping or spiraling effectat the base of the seed head in the stem itself. In addition, we have seed headsthat appear to have been blown off, not cut, not effected by crows or animals,but blown off with the leaves twisted around in a tight spiral around where theseed head would have been.OF THE ENTIRE 1999 YEAR IN THE FOUR COUNTRIES ANDEVERYTHING YOU HAVE PERSONALLY HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT,WHAT DO YOU THINK HAS FALLEN INTO THE HIGHESTSTRANGENESS CATEGORY.The Edmonton, Alberta case is going to be phenomenal. (October 2 , 1999earthfiles.com) And the Whitefish, Montana case is equally amazing."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Edmonton, Alberta, Canada FormationCAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE HIGH STRANGENESS INEDMONTON?First of all, you have seven circles in a basic quincunx - a center circle with fouroutlayers, you know? In the north and south outlayers, instead of having them asmall distance away, connect them to the formation, so they are touching, andthen connected to both of those circles are two smaller. So it's a total of 7circles in this basic design. The design is not that unusual now. We see this fairlyregularly. The fact of the matter is there is a radial lay in all 7. I've never seen aformation with 7 circles - I've never seen a radial lay throughout a formation,first of all.THAT'S AS IF ENERGY COMES STRAIGHT DOWN TO THE CENTER OFTHE CIRCLE AND SPLAYS OUT...Shoots directly out.EVERYTHING IS GOING STRAIGHT OUT AND NO CURVESANYWHERE?No. Straight out. Furthermore, in those circles, there is about a 6-inch widepathway of laid crop around the perimeters of each circle where this 6-inch widearea is laid counter-clockwise underneath the radial lay. So, it obviously had togo down first.TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LAYERS.Completely different doing completely different things.We have these several witnesses, one of whom is being developed as we speak -we are trying to get all the details so we have it absolutely correct - but it lookslike someone on the road only about 100 feet or so from this field - actuallyobserved a light over the field while this formation was occurring. There are anumber of other witnesses who observed lights in the general area at the generaltime. Furthermore, the entire family has had a number of encounters with lights.One of which occured within two days either prior or immediately after the cropcircle occurred where the light chased the car in which the family was driving.The parents were.In this Edmonton formation, not only do we have this radial lay and theunderlying permiter lay that is counter-clockwise and all the light phenomenaand all this other stuff, the plants themselves in this particular case - the firstnodes underneath the seed head, which is called the apical node, is so enlargedin all of the downed crop that my guess is that when the work is done in thelaboratory we're going to get a 250% to 300% node length increase. That isphenomenal! The greatest amount of node length increase that we had prior tothat in the ten years of this work we've been doing is about a 217% at Blue Ball,Maryland, one of those cases that you were involved in many years ago. Thatwas a randomly downed formation, not a geometric.This one is a geometric. In addition to this massive node length increase, thereare expulsion cavities everywhere in second, third and fourth nodes.Everywhere! You would literally have to be blind not to see these changes in theplants.THERE IS DEFINITELY A LINK BETWEEN LIGHTS AND A LOT OFFORMATION ACTIVITY - WHATEVER THEY ARE.Yeah, and this summer, I'd say it was 90 to 95% of the people start to offer thissort of information without me mentioning it - I never mention anything like this.It's usually in the part of the interview when I ask them if they have noticedtelevision interference, smoke alarms in their house going off, car alarms, batteryfailure, unusual behavior of the animals on their property, either domesticanimals, cattle or horses - and it's in that part of the questionnaire that they start"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"to spontaneously tell me these stories of light phenomena and sometimes craft,either immediately around the time that their crop formation occurred or at sometime historically over the last five years or ten years or whatever. In other words,they apparently are making the connection themselves.IN ENGLAND I THINK THEY HAD, ONE COUNT WAS ABOUT 160FORMATIONS IN 1999?Right.IN THE NETHERLANDS AND GERMANY, WHAT WAS THE BREAKDOWN THERE?I think that Germany may have reported 15 to 20 of them. The Netherlands -they actually aren't getting full counts because a huge number of these events arenow occurring in close proximity to this boy Robert (in Hoeven) - and thefamily is not reporting them for a number of reasons, primarily the farmerinvolved has been extremely intolerant and they don't want many people goinginto the property because this man has so many he would lose his entire crop ifevery one of them was reported.CAN YOU GIVE US AN UPDATE SINCE WE DID THE INTERVIEWS BACKIN JUNE, I BELIEVE, ABOUT ROBERT? CAN YOU GIVE SOMEHIGHLIGHTS OF WHAT OTHER EXPERIENCES HE HAS HAD AND WHATHAS OCCURRED?He has now seen so many of these formed, starting the last two or three yearsago when he happened to be in a field in daytime, saw these balls of light. Someof them detached themselves, approached him. He passed out. When he cameto, he was lying in the middle of a brand new crop circle. Then, many things -balls of light, balls approaching the house, burn marks on the house, whitepowders being left which we analyzed and found out were magnesium oxide, anumber of other peculiar events there.And then this summer, he saw these three different formations occur early on inthe summer - two in the middle of the night and one at 3 o'clock in theafternoon. All three with a different visual stimuli. This pinkish purple light wasthe first one. The second one was a flash of light. The third one was a ball, abrilliant white-yellow ball of light that he observed in the middle of theafternoon. Since then, there have been numerous other formations in that fieldand he has in every case witnessed what went down as it occurred. Primarilylights of one sort or another.THE FORMATIONS THAT HE IS SEEING, ARE THEY LARGELY SIMPLECIRCLES?They are - yes, largely. The third one, the one created by the so-called ball oflight at 3 o'clock in the afternoon - was not a simple circle. It was a circle withspokes going off rather the way a child would draw a picture of the sun. Therewere 6 or 8 spokes on this particular formation. And in some cases, they are tinyadn sometimes they are very large, several hundred meters across, there was one.HE HAS ACTUALLY SEEN THE CROP GO DOWN IN RELATIONSHIP TO ALIGHT OVER THAT MUCH AREA?Ye s .HOW FAST DOES IT OCCUR FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW/Usually the descriptions are that the light phenomena is observed first for severalseconds, 10, 15, 20 seconds - sometimes even 30 seconds. Then, just before itdissipates or goes out, the crop goes down. The crop goes down instantly whenit goes. There is an energy discharge observed in some of the cases. Somethingthat appears to come from underneath the light or the form down to the cropsurface. These lights, the balls, the flashes, all of them are generally seen atabout 10 to 12 feet over the crop surface. They are watched in place for ten or"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"fifteen seconds and then, BOOM!, the crop goes down and the light object - itusually doesn't go away. It simply goes out. It disappears as if you turned a lightbulb off.DID HE TALK WITH YOU AT ALL ABOUT WHAT HE'S ACTUALLYSEEING IN TERMS OF THE STEMS OF THE PLANTS OR THE HEADSBENDING OVER FIRST? IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THE WAY THECROP IS GOING DOWN?His house is about 30 or 40 meters away from this field. The field is large. Theformations occur anywhere from 50 to 100 meters behind his house. Robert isnot particularly interested in the science. He is not partic. interested in thosekinds of details. The way he describes it is that the entire plant goes down. Thewhole area goes down underneath whatever he's seeing. Now, it depends on howclose it is to these windows that happen to be off his bedroom as to how muchof it he can see. In some cases, he can't see the thing go down.Depends on how close it is. If the area is close, you can stand on his balconyand this summer I could clearly see two of the three formations just by lookingout his windows. The third one was far enough away, you just couldn't see it. Itwas great. It was terrifically interesting to me that because he goes out to thefields immediately as soon as this happens and gets there within 2 to 5 minutesafter the event has occurred - he reported this crackling noise in every case thissummer. That the ground was hot to the touch. He feels the energy in thesethings and having been with him on many occasions and feeling some of thisenergy myself, my description of it would be it feels very electrostaticky,electrical. It feels a bit like you're very close to an electrical outlet of some sort.\" A Biophysicist's Perspective on Crop FormationsBIOPHYSICIST W. C. LEVENGOOD DID HIS ACADEMIC WORK AT THEUNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, HOLDS MANY PATENTS INCLUDING ONEFOR A SEED ANALYZER AND HAS BEEN STUDYING PLANTS INSIDEAND OUTSIDE CROP FORMATIONS FOR THE PAST DECADE. I ASKEDHIM WHAT HE THINKS IS THE STRONGEST PHYSICAL EVIDENCETHAT SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY IS OCCURRING IN CROPFORMATIONS?W. C. Levengood, Ph.D., Biophysicist, Grass Lake, Michigan: \"I suppose it'sthe tremendous expansion of these plant nodes that extend over a huge area. Imean, we have crop formations that are several hundred feet in diameter. Andthey follow this fundamental principle of physics that describes the absorptionof the energies. There is no way that anyone could take any device out in thefield and produce through any means that I know of at the present time.WHICH THEN REINFORCES THE FACT THAT YOU CAN DISCRIMINATEBETWEEN UNAFFECTED (HOAXED) FORMATIONS AND THE TRULYMYSTERIOUS ONES?Oh, without question. I've looked at over probably 250 crop formations indetail.OF ALL THE FORMATION WORK YOU HAVE DONE, WHAT HASSURPRISED OR SHOCKED YOU THE MOST?My discovery that out of the crop formations you can get seeds that look sickly.A seedsman or a farmer would take one look at them and say, 'I'm not going toplant those seeds. They're dead!' And then when you plant them, you find theyway outstrip the normal plant seeds.WHICH IS WHAT INSPIRED YOUR PATENT?That's right. I think that's been what of the biggest things. And one of the biggestsatisfactions is the discovery that the node expansions follow the Biere-Lambert"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"principle of the absorption of electromagnetic radiation.CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT FOR A RADIO AUDIENCE ABOUT THEPATENT YOU HAVE DEVELOPED CONCERNING APPLICATIONS OFENERGIES TO ACCELERATE GROWTH?Yeah, this patent came out of some work I was doing, some fundamental work.My main interest in the biophysical area is dealing with the transport of ions inplants. These are charged particles that all living things have in them. And oneof the aspects of this was to determine how they could be guidedelectrofluoretically. Now, electrofluoresis is the guidance of charged moleculesby electric fields. I won't bother getting into details of that, but it occursnaturally inside plants if there is an electric field present. I was applying electricfields to see how I could guide these ions through the plant. And I had beenstudying this for several years before I even got involved in the crop formations.Then after this very startling discovery came along that sometimes the seedswere enhanced inside of crop formations - in spite of the fact that their seedweights were maybe 30 or 40% less than the controls, or normal plants, Idecided, 'What's going on here?'We have found that if you apply an electric field that's been stimulated by theright kind of over-riding oscillating field, that you induce in the air what arecalled ion electron avalanches. And these impinge on the plant and producewhat I call a molecular impulse response effect. And this can stimulate the dryseeds to grow more and produce higher yields and to grow more uniformly afterthey have been exposed. And it doesn't apply any dangerous chemical orchanging the genes or anything else.RIGHT, BECAUSE IN THIS WORLD WHERE WE ARE WORRYINGABOUT FOOD PRODUCTION TO AN EXPANDING POPULATION, ITWOULD SEEM THAT WOULD BE A WONDERFUL CONTRIBUTIONBECAUSE IT WOULD NOT INVOLVE ARTIFICIAL CHEMISTRY.Oh, yeah. And it's repeatable. The interesting thing is that the correlation withwhat's going on in the crop formations is that the crop formations also producethis very unusual ion electron avalanche that impinges on the plants and eventhese seeds are retarded in growth, they still receive what I call this MIR energy,or molecular impulse response, and they end up growing at a fantastic rate andproducing higher yields.HOW WOULD YOU APPLY THIS ON LARGE FARMS?We apply it to the seeds before they are put in the ground.\"More Information:To report crop formations, please call:Nancy Talbott, BLT Research, Cambridge, Mass617-492-0415 or FAX 617-492-0414Also, please: FAX Linda Moulton Howe at: 215-491-9842 or e-mailearthfiles@earthfiles.comFor more information about the scientific and mathematical analyses of cropformations which include many color photographs and illustrations, please seeGlimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I: Facts & Eyewitnesses and other crop circlebooks and calendar listed in the Earthfiles Shop.We b s it e s :1) Judy Arndt's Web Site:http://www.CropCircleQuest.com/2) Paul Anderson, Director, Canadian Crop Circle Research Network (CCCRN)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"http://www.geocities.com/cropcirclecanada3) Largest Crop Circle Archive:http://www.cropcircleconnector.comCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
