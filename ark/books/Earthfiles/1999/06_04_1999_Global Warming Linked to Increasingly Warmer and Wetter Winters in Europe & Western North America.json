Thatmeans that the west coast of the U. S., Canada and Europe now have winters afull ten degrees Fahrenheit warmer than they were in the 1960's. For the firsttime, Dr. Shindell has been able to show with confidence that this chronicwarming is a result of greenhouse gas emissions.Drew Shindell, Ph.D., Atmospheric Physicist, NASA's Goddard Institutefor Space Studies, Columbia University, New York City: \"Now, we find thatthose (warmer winters) also seem to be a result of greenhouse gasses and thereason that we have some confidence in the result is that we have a physicalreason why this should take place in the atmosphere. And what we find is thatthe greenhouse gasses as they float up into the atmosphere and collect there,they cause different areas to heat at different rates, to heat or cool. And at highlatitudes and high altitudes as well, they cause the atmosphere to cool. And atlower latitudes, the atmosphere warms where the atmosphere is denser at lowerlatitudes. And both of these things have been observed.AND HOW DOES THAT APPLY TO THE STATEMENT THATWARMER AND WETTER WINTERS IN EUROPE AND WESTERNNORTH AMERICA SPECIFICALLY ARE LINKED TO INCREASINGGREENHOUSE GASSES?The reason that our weather in the Northern Hemisphere comes from the west -if you ever look at a weather map, you see storm systems moving from west toeast is because on the spinning earth we have colder temp. in the north polarregions and warmer temps in the south and this causes the air to flow north andto the west. So these predominant westerly winds that carry our weather systemsaround - if the temperature difference between the high and low latitudes"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"increases, those wind speeds also increase. And that's what we have been seeingover the past few decades and those winds carry warm, wet air from over theoceans onto the western part of continents.SO, NOW WHAT IS HAPPENING IS BECAUSE THE WIND SYSTEMSTHEMSELVES ARE BEING AFFECTED, THEY ARE CARRYINGMORE WARM AIR ESSENTIALLY INTO EUROPE AND WESTERNNORTH AMERICA.That's exactly right. So, this is somewhat different than the greenhouse effectthat we have been talking about for years now whereby greenhouse gasses causemore energy to be trapped down near the surface of the earth. This is not sayingthere is more energy. It's saying that the greenhouse gasses by affecting thewindspeeds affect where the energy goes. So that the oceans which are warmduring the winter because they are able to retain the warm summer temperatureswith their greater mass and heat capacity than the land, their warm air getsbrought on to the continents.WHAT KIND OF COMPUTER MODEL PROJECTIONS INTO THEFUTURE HAVE YOU DONE TAKING THIS NEW DATA ANDLOOKING AT WHERE THE WEATHER SYSTEMS AND CLIMATEWILL CONTINUE TO CHANGE - LET'S SAY OVER THE NEXT FIFTYTO A HUNDRED YEARS?Well, we first ran our computer simulation to see if we could reproduce the pastfew decades and we did find they matched the observed trend toward increasingwinds and warmer continental temperatures. So, we let them continue and thosetrends continue as well for about another three or four decades - we see thewesterly winds in the Northern Hemisphere during winter time continue toincrease, continue to bring warm, wet air over western No. America and Europeand Asia. And after about 30 or 40 years, the affect kind of levels off. So, weexpect that we are roughly half way through and that the storm systems thatmove off the Atlantic tend to move up to northern Europe and become more andmore intense. The affect is especially strong over Europe and Asia where aircoming off the ocean flows quite easily across the continents. Over No. America,the Rocky Mtns. Deflect the air quite a bit. So there is a lot warmer and wettertemperatures in the Pacific Northwest and Western Canada and as they hit themtns and flows down and is mitigated somewhat.WELL, IF YOU HAVE HAD A TEN DEGREE FAHRENHEITINCREASE IN TEMPERATURE IN THESE AREAS OF EUROPE ANDWESTERN NORTH AMERICA OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS AND WEHAVE ANOTHER 30 YEARS TO GO, DOES THAT MEAN WE AREGOING TO SEE YET ANOTHER 10 DEG. F. OR 20 DEG. F WARMINGOVER 60 YEARS?That's really about the maximum level. The temp. changes over large areas havebeen roughly 6 to 10 degrees, so up to 10 degrees over the past 30 years. As youpoint out, if the trend continues for another 30 to 40 years, we should seeroughly a doubling of that.AND IF SO, WHAT DO YOU FORESEE FOR WEATHER IN EUROPEAND WESTERN COAST OF CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Well, if you live kind of lower down in altitude or somewhere where it hasn'thistorically been incredibly cold, we would expect a lot more rain and generallyfairly mild winters. If you live up in the mtns., with the warmer temps you mightsee more often rain and sleet and less snow as the temps rise by something prettydramatically 10 to 20 degrees. Not good news for ski resort operators.MEANING LESS SNOW?If the temp. gets very warm, the snow would fall as rain instead. That's all Imean. There would be more precipitation in general. But whether it will comedown as rain or snow - if it gets warm past the freezing point, it will fall as raininstead of snow.AND I HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT IN EUROPE OVER THEDECADE OF THE NINETIES, THERE HAS BEEN A LARGE NUMBEROF FLOODS AND HEAVY RAINS, HEAVIER THAN IN THE PAST. ISTHAT TRUE? AND WILL THAT CONTINUE?It does seem that both over Europe and the U. S., there has been a lot ofextreme weather recently. What we expect is - especially over Europe - thestorms that hit Europe form in the western Atlantic and come across the oceanpicking up moisture and intensity and those we would expect to become moreintense and especially we would notice that effect in Europe more even than inNorth America, and as the winds pick up, those storms will intensify.AND WOULD THIS INCREASE THE VIOLENCE OF TORNADOES INTHE MIDWESTERN PART OF THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OFCOLLIDING WARM AIR AND COLD AIR?That's certainly a possibility. That's something that's very difficult to pick out ina computer model because these are very small scale phenomenon in the realatmosphere. And where it's very difficult for us to resolve anything that is reallythat small. But in general, the atmosphere will be picking up more and moreenergy, both from the greenhouse effect leading to global warming and from theincrease in wind speeds. And the more energy that's there, the more is possibleand the more that's been available to creating severe weather and storms.SO THE LIKELIHOOD IS THAT THE VIOLENCE OF TORNADOESCOULD INCREASE OVER THESE NEXT TWO OR THREEDECADES?That's certainly a possibility, yes.HAS ANY BODY IN FEMA OR THE GOVERNMENT TALKED TO YOUIN A CONSULTING BASIS ABOUT WHAT YOUR PROJECTIONS AREFOR INCREASED WEATHER VIOLENCE THAT WILL AFFECTEMERGENCY MANAGEMENT?Nobody has talked to me directly about this, but it's something that the(atmospheric physics) community and the government have been both interestedin quite a lot. But as I said, it's one of the most difficult aspects of climatemodeling is really getting these small scale very unusual extreme events - each"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"one is different from the others. It's much easier for us to predict broad scalecontinental wide features than a very small storm system.BUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION AT SOME LEVEL HAS METWITH ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICISTS OUT OF THEIR CONCERN FORWHAT THE FUTURE IS GOING TO BRING?Yes, and the government has certainly been funding quite a lot of research in thisarea. People would like very much to understand what will happen to severestorms. There have been suggestions from numerous groups that severe weatherwill become worse - more frequent and more severe storms. But that's stillsomething that we don't have as much confidence in those predictions as we doin something like global warming.AND THAT WOULD AFFECT EVERYTHING INCLUDING BUILDINGCODES.That's true. Yes, it would have enormous repercussions. And of course, theinsurance industry as well as the govt would be quite interested in somethinglike this.FROM YOUR COMPUTER MODELS, HAVE YOU SEEN THAT WINDSPEEDS THEMSELVES WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE AND THATWE MIGHT SEE MORE ABOVE 300 MPH WINDS AS GUSTED INONE OF THE TORNADOES THIS YEAR?Well, we see an overall increase in the dominant wind patterns, the westerliesthat bring all of our weather around the Northern Hemisphere. But theseextreme excursions will in all likelihood there will be some increase, but that'ssomething that's very tricky for us to pull out of the model and we see smallsignals, but against such a large variability of winds going up to 300 mph it'svery hard to see any real substantial difference.BUT IF WE DID START HAVING MORE 300 MPH WINDS, VERYLITTLE IS BUILT ON THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET TO SUSTAIN300 MPH GUSTS.That's certainly true. Any real change in the weather patterns is going to bedifficult to adapt to and that's one of the main motivations for understandingthese sort of affects. The increase in greenhouse gasses has been going on fordecades and the earth climate system takes decades to respond. So, even if westopped immediately, the earth's climate in the atmosphere and the oceanswould continue to respond for decades. And we can't shut this off. But if we canunderstand it better, we can try to mitigate some of the negative impacts and ifwe find there will be more severe storms, that rains will fall in different areas,and some areas that were formerly lush crop land will become moredrought-prone and vice versa, we can try to mitigate the affects. But anythingwill be difficult because the current economic system and distribution of foodand building codes, as you mentioned, - all of these things are set with theCURRENT climate system in mind."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Dr. Shindell's current computer model projections show that the greatest climatechanges over the next thirty years in the United States and Canada will continueto be west of the Rocky Mountains. Increasing warmer temperatures and rainfallduring the winters are expected. The southern United States will also havesignificantly warmer winters, but in the northeast U. S. and eastern Canada,winter temperature changes will be fairly small in comparison.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
