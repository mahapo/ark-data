Army Infantryman's Abduction© 1999 by Linda Moulton Howe October 24, 1999 Findlay, Ohio This week, I interviewed a man who fought inVietnam from 1966 to 1967 and then came back to California to finish hisservice, as he said, \"in the Combat Developments Experimental Command atHunter Liggett Military Reservation eighty miles from Fort Ord in the middle ofthe Mojave Desert.\"Editor's Clarification since radio broadcast and posting of this report:Hunter Liggett Military Reservation is located between Monterey and PasoRobles, California, not in or near the Mojave Desert. This fact was brought tomy attention by several earthfiles.com visitors. I confirmed the location nowcalled Fort Hunter Liggett on a map and called George Ritter.He said, \"I came out of Viet Nam and went straight to Fort Ord on the ocean.But for the assignment with that Experimental Command, we were bussed fortwo hours into a desert that I was told was the Mohave Desert. Coming fromFindlay, Ohio, I didn't know anything about California and have always assumedthat was the desert we were in. I know we passed Soledad prison and Lockwoodon our way to where we had guard duty.\"Looking on a map, Soledad is on Route 101 and Lockwood is at the edge ofHunter Liggett Military Reservation which was first built in 1940 after the U. S.Army purchased the land from William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper tycoon.Straight east of Lockwood is the Salinas Valley, the Cholame Hills, the DiabloRange hill country and San Joaquin Valley north of Bakersfield. The MohaveDesert is much further south. Mr. Ritter says to the best of his memory hisExperimental Command's location was described as in the Mojave Desert, butnow does not know why if it was two hours by bus from Ft. Ord. If anyone elsehas information about the fall 1967 time period in relationship to Hunter LiggettMilitary operations, please contact me.On the night of October 24th, 1967, he and three of his Army colleagues wereon guard duty at the Experimental Command site. Something happened thatconvinced him the U. S. government is hiding knowledge about non-humansinteracting with earth, but he thinks everyone should know. His name is GeorgeW. Ritter now retired in Findlay, Ohio.Interview:George W. Ritter, Specialist Four Infantry, U. S. Army, honorablydischarged from the Armed Forces on September 25, 1968, speaking aboutan encounter on October 24, 1967: \"I was on guard duty one night with threeother guys. And we were standing there talking and I said, 'Look at that, youguys! What the hell is that?' We watched it and it was about the color of acigarette ember at night. And it was moving from left to right.HOW BIG?It was way far away and small. Kind of looked like the size of a star, only a"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"different color, like an orange, reddish-orange. And it got bigger and brighterand started giving off this like orange fluorescent tail. While it was moving andleaving the tail behind, five little ones dropped out of the bottom of it. And theygot in a V formation. And we're standing there and wondering what in the heckwe're looking at?So, the five little ones get in a V formation and head straight for us and the otherone just keeps on going. So in no time at all, they are right on top of us. Theywere right over our heads and we're standing there and I'm looking up. Theylook like they are red hot. But I couldn't feel any heat.Drawing of five smaller reddish-orange discs that were dropped out of a larger aerial craftwhere George Ritter and three other U. S. Army Infantrymen were on guard duty for aCombat Developments Experimental Command in association with Hunter Liggett MilitaryReservation approximately eighty miles from Fort Ord, California, October 24, 1967.Artwork by John Spears for George Ritter © 1996 by George W. Ritter, Findlay, Ohio.HOW MANY WERE YOU LOOKING AT?Five in a V-formation. And the other one had passed off from left to right - itlooked like it got bigger and brighter leaving a trail. It was like it had to dosomething in order to get bigger and brighter when it dropped these little discsoff and that's when it opened up a hatch or something that let out the lights.They're (five discs) right on top of us and I could hear just before they got rightto us, I could hear an echoing blip. It was like an electronic beep, echoing.LIKE A SONAR?Yeah, kind of like water dripping into a large pool of water with an echo sound.That's exactly what it sounded like. I think that was the beginning of theabduction as far as I'm concerned. Because it froze us in place. We couldn'tmove.The next thing I know, I'm lifted up into one of these things, but I don't see myfriends anywhere. They are not around. Then I seen this, it was a grey, I guess.WHAT DID IT LOOK LIKE?A typical looking grey, big black eyes, paralyzing eyes, those all-knowing eyes!The first one I saw, I thought to myself, 'Oh, my God, I'm going to die.' Andinstantly, this voice comes into my head and says, 'You're not going to die.You're going to be all right. We're not going to hurt you. We're going to do somethings and then we're going to let you go.'"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Drawing of grey \"boss's head\" that seemed to absorb George Ritter's memoryand all lifetime experiences © October 20, 1999 by George W. Ritter, Findlay, Ohio.AND AT THIS POINT, YOU'RE A PART OF THIS COMBATDEVELOPMENT EXPERIMENTAL COMMAND AT FT. ORDCALIFORNIA. YOU HAD BEEN THERE WATCHING WITH THREEOTHER MEN THESE APPEARANCES OF THE HALF A DOZENRED-ORANGE GLOWING OBJECTS THAT CAME OVER YOU. DOYOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE BEEN PHYSICALLYMOVED SOME WAY? OR YOUR OTHER MILITARY COMRADESHAVE BEEN MOVED AWAY? WHAT HAS HAPPENED THAT YOUARE ALONE?I am on the ship. I realized that, but I don't remember how I got on there. And Idon't know where the other guys are.YOU'RE IN THE SHIP AND THE MEN AREN'T AROUND YOU ANDYOU HAVE BEEN SCARED BY THIS GREY ENTITY WHO IS NOWSAYING THEY ARE NOT GOING TO HARM YOU. WHAT HAPPENSNEXT?The first time I really got a good look at this thing, I realized I was laying flat onmy back and I was naked. And this grey thing bent over the table and put hishead right up to mine and I'm telling you what - everything I'd ever known orexperienced or every lesson I had ever learned - all of a sudden, he knew exactlywhat I knew.TAKING YOUR MIND OUT...Borrowing my tapes or something, you know? It was a strange feeling.DID THIS ENTITY PUT BACK IN YOUR HEAD ANY INFORMATION?I'm not exactly sure if that entity did. But I was constantly being reassured that Iwasn't going to die and I was all right. Nothing was going to happen me. I wasgoing to be returned. I wouldn't remember any of that.BUT YOU HAVE REMEMBERED.Yes, I have remembered. And I found out through some hypnosis with BuddHopkins that they spent some time looking at my feet, maybe because my feetwere callused. But they seemed to be interested in my feet. And they moved upto my right thigh. And I got an injection from the right side in my thigh. I knowit was an injection because I knew what an injection felt like and that's what itwas. I'm sure of it. I couldn't really look right down and see what they weredoing because I couldn't move my head. All I could move was my eyes. But Iknew I was flat on my back and I knew I was naked because I was cold. And atone time I saw the tips of my toes.DID YOU EVER GET ANY TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION ABOUTWHY THEY WERE GIVING YOU A SHOT?No. But all the communication was telepathic. All of it. I never opened mymouth and neither did they."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"DID ALL THE ENTITIES AROUND YOU LOOK IDENTICAL? ORWERE SOME DIFFERENT AND COULD YOU DESCRIBE THEDIFFERENCES?There were three other smaller ones, but the one that bent over me wasdefinitely a little bit different. Maybe a little taller. But he seemed like he wasthe boss. He was running the show or whatever was going on. And there was aweird misty light in there, sort of the orchid color of black light like it wasshining through a fog or something.Drawing of George Ritter laying naked on table during examination by grey-skinnedentities,three smaller than the taller \"boss,\" © 1999 by George W. Ritter, Findlay, Ohio.DID THE TALLER GREY BEING ALSO HAVE THE LARGE BLACKEYES?Ye s .DID THEY ALL HAVE THE LARGE BLACK EYES?Ye s .DID YOU EVER HAVE AN IMPRESSION THAT THOSE BLACK EYESMIGHT BE SHIELDS OVER YET A DIFFERENT EYE UNDERNEATHTHE SHIELDS?I couldn't see through it, but I thought about it and sometimes I thought theywere almost like sunglasses that weren't connected and didn't have any ear rodpieces on them.COULD YOU ALSO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY RIDGES ORWRINKLES ON THE GREY ENTITY YOU THOUGHT WAS INCHARGE? OR WAS THE SKIN ENTIRELY SMOOTH?It seemed like it was smooth, but it was cold in there, colder than heck.DID THEY HAVE ANY CLOTHING ON?No. When Budd showed me a picture of an entity that had on a black turtleneck sweater - that's the guy. That one looks more like the ones I was with thanany other pictures I've ever seen. Whitley Strieber's Communion book - that faceis too symmetrical - it's not round enough. Their faces are egg shaped orsomething.So, anyway they gave me a shot in the thigh near my groin area. I didn't likethem messing around like that, but there was nothing I could do about it. Andthen one of them came up to my left side and put his whole hand, it felt like,inside the upper left side of my chest.LITERALLY PUT IT INSIDE YOUR CHEST SOME HOW?Inside my chest cavity, yes.BUT WITHOUT DOING SURGERY ON YOU?Yes. It was just like he reached in there and did something and withdrew. Iwasn't freaking out, but I was trying to figure out what the hell they were doing."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Anyway, after they messed around with my feet, gave me a shot and didsomething in my groin area, they got me dressed. The reason I knew I was naked,I saw my toes and I couldn't figure out how they got my boots off so fast becausethey were laced up and tied tight. But then, the more I realized that I figuredthere must have been some sort of time dilation involved here.Otherwise, I couldn't have lost three hours in what seemed like three minutes.When they were all done, they took me to another room and there was - I'mgoing to say it was an angel. That's the only thing I know how to say it wasbecause I've never seen an angel before. Always been told that angels wouldcome as a light source or as a light being. That's exactly what this thing was. Itwas the source of its own energy.Drawing of ball of light that emanated energy and love to George Ritter andcommunicated telepathically © 1999 by George W. Ritter, Findlay, Ohio.CAN YOU DESCRIBE IT IN MORE DETAIL FROM HEAD TO TOE?It didn't have a form. It was just a ball of light energy that was so bright and soloving and caring, I just knew it was an angel. Unless I was completely fooled.But it told me some things. It told me that in the near future - God only knowswhat that is to them - that something wonderful was going to happen. This lightbeing told me that I had had syphilis, that I was cured now, and I argued with itand I said, 'No, that's impossible because I got checked before I left Vietnam.And I didn't have it or I would never have left the country.' And the thingseemed to think my arguing with it was amusing.IT WAS COMMUNICATING WITH YOU IN YOUR MIND?That's the way they all do. They all did it.WHEN IT WAS COMMUNICATING WITH YOU IN YOUR MIND, DIDYOU ALSO HAVE IMAGES GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND AT THESAME TIME?Not that I can remember. But I'm sure there could have been screen memoriesput in there. They thought they could do just about anything they wanted to.WHEN THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING WONDERFULWOULD HAPPEN, DO YOU HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THATRELATED TO THE ENTIRE WORLD OR TO YOU ONLY?To the entire world. But they wouldn't tell me what it was. And they told methat this was a reminder that I had to keep my end of our arrangement that wasmade long ago.YOU UNDERSTAND THAT TO BE WHAT?That some time, somewhere, I cut some kind of deal with them or made tobelieve that. And they were just checking on me and reminding me that I wouldkeep my end of the arrangement and that was that. The next thing I know, I'mstanding on the ground again right where I was before right next to my friendsand they are not there. I am still looking up. The objects are gone. And we'rejust standing there bewildered."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"YOUR MILITARY COLLEAGUES ARE THERE?Yeah. They had to have seen all of this because when I told them, 'Hey, we're onguard duty and under our general orders and the oath we took, we have to turnthis into the Sergeant of the Guard. Our general orders say we have to reporteverything strange and unusual. And this is strange and unusual.'So, we went to my Sergeant, Sergeant Palmer, who was at the time a PlatoonSergeant and I told him exactly what happened. And he looked me straight inthe eye and he said, 'Ritter, keep your mouth shut about this. Do not tell anyoneanything about it. Everything will be just fine.' And I said, 'No, Sergeant Palmer,I can't keep my mouth shut.' I reminded him of my oath, my general orders. Hesaid, 'Look, I see these things out here and other people have seen them out hereand if you don't keep your mouth shut, you're going to the psycho ward.' So Isaid, 'Fine, so be it. Send me to the psycho ward.' And they did!THEY PUT YOU IN THE PSYCHO WARD?Yes. I was in the psycho ward for two months.ON WHAT GROUNDS?That I had reported a UFO I guess. It's OK to see them, but not to report them.At least in the military.THAT WAS IN OCTOBER OF 1967.Ye s , m a a m .YOU WERE IN FOR TWO MONTHS.And basically, in order to get out of there I had to convince them that I sawsomething but didn't know what I saw. And Jesus, I didn't tell them I was on thething!YOU NEVER TOLD ANYONE ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE WITH THEGREY ENTITIES ON SOME SORT OF CRAFT?Oh, yeah, I told my Sergeant, but I didn't tell them in the psycho ward because Ididn't want to be in there forever.THEY WERE KEEPING YOU IN THE PSYCHO WARD ONLY ON THEGROUNDS OF HAVING REPORTED THE RED-ORANGE LIGHTS?UFOs and the abduction because they wanted to find out what I knew orremembered, if anything.YOU DECIDED NOT TO TELL THEM?I decided to clam up. I figured if I could convince them I didn't know what I sawor what happened, I could get out of here. Well, I did. But I didn't drop the ball.As soon as they got me back to the desert again, I'm out there and I'minvestigating some things, turning over every rock I can, and they warned meagain and I told them to go to hell. I said, 'This is not right. You guys arecovering something up.' And bang! I'm right back in the psycho ward. They keptme there from January 1968 until my April 1968 ETF.BUT THAT HAD CONVINCED YOU THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLYUSING PSYCHO WARDS AS PUNISHMENT FOR ANYONEREPORTING A UFO ENCOUNTER?Not only that, but when people in there found out what I was in there for, I gotreports from other people!YOU GOT REPORTS FROM OTHER PEOPLE IN THERE THAT THEYHAD SEEN THINGS AND THEY WERE ALSO IN THERE BECAUSETHEY HAD REPORTED THEM?Yes, and their family members. This one kid told me that his mother out inCalifornia had seen a UFO come up out of the reservoir and take off. After whatI'd been through, I didn't doubt the kid.WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR THREE MILITARY COLLEAGUESWHEN THE RED-ORANGE THINGS CAME OVER YOU AND YOUWERE ABDUCTED?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Absolutely nothing. They kept their mouths shut.DID YOU TALK WITH THEM PRIVATELY OFF THE RECORD ANDASK WHAT THEY HAD SEEN HAPPEN TO YOU?I told them, 'What the hell is wrong with you people? Don't you realize whathappened out there? And what's going on here? That we're dealing withsomething that's not even from this planet, probably. And they would start toremember different things about seeing it and as soon as I would wait for ananswer, they totally forgot about it again. And I wondered, 'What the hell isgoing on?!' They went to sleep that night and I couldn't sleep for a week. I brokeout with a rash in my groin area.When they let me out after the first two months was up, I went back to thedesert and I kept digging, nosing around. And they sent the CID out there, theCriminal Investigation Division.FOR THE ARMY?Like I was some kind of criminal. I saw him talking to my Sergeant and theywere pointing at me and this guy was writing stuff on a clipboard.DID YOU GET AN HONORABLE DISCHARGE?Yes, I got an Honorable Discharge like everything was normal.Close up George Walter Ritter's name and date of Honorable Discharge.WHEN DID THAT OCCUR?September 25, 1968. I went back to Findlay, Ohio to work in the factory where Ihad worked before the Army, but the Army wouldn't allow me to get back towork and held up my formal discharge for six months.WHAT WAS THE ARMY'S REASON FOR HOLDING IT UP?'For the convenience of the government,' I was told.WHEN YOU ASKED SUPERIORS WHY, WHAT ANSWERS DID THEY"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"GIVE?They don't answer and you don't ask questions.TODAY, YOU'RE SPEAKING OUT BECAUSE...I've been speaking out for a long time. I've been telling this truth to anybodywho will listen to it. I was raised always to tell the truth. I took my militarytraining seriously and my orders seriously. And that was all I was doing,following orders. And I was in fact told by my superior officer to forget aboutthe orders and to keep my mouth shut.BECAUSE?I just couldn't believe it. Why didn't they want anybody to know what is goingon? Or that we were actually being visited by somebody from somewhere elsethat had craft like I'd never seen before that defied all laws that I ever knew.How did they get me from the ground up there without landing?YOU ARE UPSET BY GOVERNMENT KNOWLEDGE ANDCOVER-UP?Yes, absolutely.\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
