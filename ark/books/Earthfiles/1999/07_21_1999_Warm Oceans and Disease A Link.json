Goddard seniorearth scientist, Compton Tucker, Ph.D., said, \"We feel that the links are solidand the associations are clear.\"The warming ocean waters begins with El Nino in the Pacific which producesmore rain in parts of Africa. More rain means more mosquitoes, specifically theAedes mosquito.Photo Credit: Aedes mosquito, a species that carries different viruses,including the virus responsible for Rift Valley Fever which causes hemorrhaging and can befatal.The insect's eggs already have the viral disease in them when the rains come.After hatching, the infected mosquitoes bite goats, cattle and other animals todrink blood and spread the nasty Rift Valley Fever hemorrhagic virus to animals.There were serious epidemics of the virus in the mid-1970s and again twentyyears later in the mid-1990s. Dr. Tucker says the epidemics are directly relatedto the El Nino cycles of warmer ocean waters.Interview:Compton Tucker, Ph.D., Senior Earth Scientist (Satellite Studies ofEcology and Biology), NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt,Maryland 20771:\"The study which was reported in last week's issue of Science is the first ofseveral studies that my co-workers and I are working on. Some in NorthAmerica, some in Africa, some in South America, some elsewhere where we areusing satellite data to look at indicators or vectors of various diseases. This is aninteresting marriage of satellite data which come to us from NASA, the spaceagency, and we couple these data with information that medical workers havegained as to the timing and location of various disease outbreaks.For example, Rift Valley Fever. This is a hemorrhagic fever disease which occurs"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"in eastern and southern Africa and is directly linked to periods of abnormallyhigh rainfall during which you have the sudden emergence of large numbers ofmosquitoes which are already infected with the hemorrhagic fever virus. It is therainfall which triggers the hatching of the mosquitoes and we simply use satellitedata to study large areas in Africa to identify when those periods of abnormallyhigh rainfall occur.In the course of that study, we determined that this is actually driven for largescale events by a concurrent or simultaneous sea surface warming in the IndianOcean and in the Tropical Pacific. The Tropical Pacific situation we know as ElNino. When that is coupled with a very high sea surface temperature situation inthe Indian Ocean ? when both of these areas are dancing to the same tune ? wehave periods of very high rainfall and we have outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever inAfrica.HOW DOES THE RIFT VALLEY FEVER DIFFER FROM EBOLA?Well, Ebola is also a hemorrhagic fever.BOTH INVOLVE COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF VOMITING BLOOD ANDBLEEDING FROM PORES.In the case of Ebola, you've probably read The Hot Zone or have seen thatmovie with Dustin Hoffman that dealt with something like Ebola or the Marburgvirus. Those are very virulent and nasty hemorrhagic fevers with a high degree ofmortality in people who are infected. In the case of Rift Valley Fever, that is alsoa hemorrhagic fever. But, it is much less dangerous than Ebola or Marburg. Itsprimary effect is on the animal population such as sheep, goats, cattle, camels,animals like that. But during virulent periods in east and southern Africa, it canjump from the animal population into people and cause a fairly high degree ofmortality as well.HAVE THERE BEEN ANY CASES IN WHICH PEOPLE TRAVELINGFROM THEU. S. OR EUROPE TO AFRICA HAVE CONTRACTED RIFT VALLEYFEVER AND BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE U. S., FOR EXAMPLE?To my knowledge, no one has returned to the U. S. with Rift Valley Fever. Butit's probably happened. During serious outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever, which onaverage occur every 8 to 10 years, and as we report in our paper ? this occurswhen you have these very unusual periods of rainfall which we're able to predictwith satellite data of sea surface temperatures. And we then confirm that withsatellite data which we collect every day over Africa to double check on ourpredictions. During some of the serious Rift Valley outbreaks, thousands ofpeople have perished, unfortunately.IN TERMS OF CURRENT SATELLITE DATA, WHAT WOULD YOUPREDICT WOULD BE THE NEXT OUTBREAK, IF YOU HAVE THATKIND OF INFORMATION?Well, at the moment fortunately, things look very quiet in Africa for Rift ValleyFever now. This is work that our State Department supports through its Agencyfor International Development (AID). We provide information to AID whichthey distribute to all of the U. S. embassies and missions in Africa. They thenuse this data to alert local people and the local authorities if something like thisis coming along and whether residents should be more concerned or not. At themoment fortunately, things are very quiet in Africa in respect to Rift ValleyFever.WHAT RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF GLOBAL OCEAN SURFACETEMPERATURES IS SHOWING UP IN SATELLITE DATA?At the moment we are in what is called a La Nina which is the opposite of ElNino. That means you have cooler than normal sea surface temperatures in thetropical Pacific, not warmer. This tends to cause dry periods in southern andeastern South America as well as other areas. At the moment, this is not toopronounced, although everyone is watching with great curiosity and interest incase it might develop into something more serious."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WOULD THE LA NINA EFFECT, WHICH COOLS WATERTEMPERATURES, EXPLAIN WHY THE NORTHEASTERN PART OFTHE U. S. IS EXPERIENCING SUCH A SEVERE DROUGHT? THEGOVERNOR OF PENNSYLVANIA HAS PUT NEARLY THE ENTIRESTATE ON WATER RESTRICTIONS.If the same conditions in Pennsylvania are what we are experiencing inMaryland where our center is, then it emphasizes how important it is to realizethat in a global climate system, when some places are perturbed or are warmeror cooler than normal in terms of sea surface temperatures, you do have moreextreme weather elsewhere.THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS TIE BETWEEN WARMING OCEANSAND HEALTH SEEMS TO IMPLY THAT IT MIGHT EXTEND TODISEASES BEYOND THE RIFT VALLEY FEVER. IS THATCORRECT?Ebola:Yes, that is correct. We're looking at the cluster of Ebola outbreaks in EquatorialAfrica in the mid-1970s. Things were then very quiet for 20 years until themid-1990s, 1994-95, when you had a series of Ebola outbreaks again. These arevery curious events. By using satellite data, we are able to get an idea and tostudy these widely different areas objectively. If we didn't have satellite data,these studies would be very difficult to do.Hanta Virus:We're also looking at some other ecologically or climatically connected diseasessuch as the Hanta virus which occurs in the southwestern U. S. This is alsohemorrhagic fever, it's linked to very wet periods following dry periods whenyou have an outbreak of the rodents apparently which are the hosts, or areimplicated in the spread of the disease. That is one disease which does effect theU. S. and which I think satellite data should be very useful to identify whenthese outbreaks will occur and then to identify more specifically the actual areaswhich will be affected.IT WOULD SEEM THAT WHAT IS EMERGING FROM YOUR WORKIS SOMETHING LIKE LONG TERM HEALTH FORECASTS, SIMILARTO WEATHER FORECASTS.Malaria, Dengue and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis:You can probably think of it as a subset of the weather forecast. There areseveral diseases such as the Hanta virus, Ebola, Rift Valley Fever, VenezuelanEquine Encephalitis, perhaps malaria, dengue and other diseases which we don'thave in the U. S. fortunately. These diseases appear to be directly andunequivocally coupled with climate and with weather abnormalities. And so byhaving more accurate weather forecasts and also having a time history ofinformation back over the past 20 or 30 years, you are then able to identify whatthe circumstances were that were associated with the outbreaks of these diseasesfrom their respective outbreak locations. And then apply that in the future.THE CONDITIONS COULD VARY FROM EITHER NEEDING A LOTOF MOISTURE OR DRYNESS?They could. For example, in the case of Ebola it looks like it may be triggeredby a period of very wet conditions followed by a period over several years ofvery dry conditions. It could easily be one way or the other. It just depends onwhat the vectors or hosts are (mosquitoes are one type of host in which theviruses spread) and what triggers their jump from their host into the vector(infected animals) and then into the human population.ARE THERE EXAMPLES IN THE 1990S WHERE YOUR WORK ANDSATELLITE DATA HAVE ACTUALLY AFFECTED PUBLIC HEALTHANTICIPATING THE BREAK OUT OF DISEASE AND GETTING"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"MORE MEDICINES IN STOCK?In an indirect way. For example, a month or two ago, there was a reported Ebolaoutbreak in Zaire, or the Congo. And at this time, the World HealthOrganization contacted Mr. Jim Wilson, who is a 4th year medical student whohas been working with me the past several months studying Ebola. Mr. Wilsonand I then compared our satellite data history of the cluster of Ebola outbreaksin the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s to the particular circumstances for thisspecific location in equatorial Africa. We concluded very quickly in just a matterof a few minutes that this did not match the profile.We then informed WHO that in our opinion this was not an outbreak of Ebola.It turned out one or two weeks later when the detailed lab work was done onsome of the people who perished from this disease that it had been an outbreakof the Marburg virus instead. So, we were able to alert people even though theyhad no confidence in our findings at the time that this was not Ebola. Bit it justdidn't match the profile and we were right based on the profile of past historicsatellite data.We hope in the future to be able to turn this around and actually have advancewarning of the outbreak of diseases based upon climatic and satellite data andactually predict, as you said, when these will occur and where.\"More Information:Global Travel and Virus Spread:How fast could a virus spread from one part of the world to another? Nearly allof the world's major cities are less than 24 hours apart by air. Thus, it is possiblethat an outbreak in any of the cities below could be spread within a day byinfected passengers.
