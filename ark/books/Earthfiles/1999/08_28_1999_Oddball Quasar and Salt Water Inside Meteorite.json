The astronomers noticed anoddly colored star in the constellation Serpens, the Snake.Photograph by Astronomer S. George Djorgovski © 1999,California Institute of Technology, Carina Software and Large Digital Sky Survey.When the unusual star's spectrum was profiled on a graph, it did not match anyknown astronomical body. Last week, the mystery was solved at the KeckObservatory in Hawaii. Their new infrared spectroscope equipment confirmedthe object is definitely an oddball quasar about 8 billion years old.. A quasar isthe most luminous object we know in the universe. A single quasar can shine athousand times brighter than our entire galaxy. Scientists aren't sure, but thinkthe enormous luminosity is produced when matter is dragged into black holes atthe centers of quasars. Salt Water Inside Meteorite"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Houston, Texas As of current data, the universe is estimated to be between 12and 14 billion years old. We're living on a watery planet that's about 4 1/2billion years old. - A geologist from the Univ. of California-Berkeley has spentyears looking for evidence of water in meteorites. Last week, Dr. MichaelZolensky at NASA's Johnson Space Center near Houston, Texas, announced thediscovery of salt water inside a small meteorite that landed in west Texas a yearago on March 22, 1998. Several boys were playing basketball when themeteorite landed on their court. The boys reported it to the police who calledNASA and the next day the space rock was delivered to a \"clean room\" at theJohnson Space Center near Houston.Photograph of actual meteorite at NASAJohnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, 1998.The significance of salt water inside the meteorite excites Dr. Zolensky becauseit implies a lot of water was present at the beginning of our solar system'screation and might be in other solar systems as well.Interview:Michael Zolensky, Ph.D., Geologist, NASA Johnson Space Center,Houston, Texas: \"This is the first time we've had liquid water samples from offthe earth to study in the lab. And they're sitting inside these little bubbles ofwater are sitting inside of halite crystals that's table salt or sodium chloride -which as far as we know, is also the first example of that. Although there havebeen reports of sodium chloride microscopic grains in some previous meteoritesthat no one believed in the past because it seemed so incredible. But if we goback now and look, maybe they were true.YOU'VE GOT A METEORITE THAT HAS BOTH TABLE SALT IN ITAND WATER BUBBLES.Yeah. All we need now is pepper and we're all set to go!THE WATER HOW IS IT THAT THE WATER ITSELF IS CAPTUREDIN BUBBLES INSIDE THE SALT?If you have salty water evaporating and it leaves behind salt crystals that's justwhat happens. Salt crystals, or any other kind of crystal grown from a fluid ifthey grow fast enough will actually kind of overrun and trap samples of thesolutions from which they are forming. And those are left behind in the crystalas it grows. And those are called fluid inclusions."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Microscopic close-up of a 15 micron diameter inclusion in meteoritethat contains water (L) and a vapor bubble (V) shown with arrows.NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, 1999.Microscopic low magnification view of halite (sodium chloride salt crystal)with one small 15 micron diameter inclusion in the center of photograph, in focus.NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, 1999.In addition, the halite sodium chloride's mineral name is halite was this beautifulpurple-blue color which only happens if halite has seen a lot of radiation. Andthis has happened to this halite because there is some radioactive potassiuminside the halite a very tiny amount that over the billions of years since itformed, has given it this beautiful color. And so, if in fact the halite had comefrom the earth or had somehow been contaminated, it wouldn't be purple likethat. It would be transparent and colorless just like table salt is. So, the fact it'spurple proves it's not from the earth.THAT IT IS EXTRATERRESTRIAL.Oh, yeah. Although we've seen evidence of water in other meteorites in the past,we never actually found any samples of the water itself to study. And that'scritical because we want to learn where water came from in the early solarsystem whether it was born in the solar system itself or created in interstellarspace or from some other solar system and how it got into the solar system andhow it got moved around from place to place? How it got to the earth, in fact,and made the oceans how did that happen?THIS IS LITERALLY EXTRATERRESTRIAL WATER INSIDE OF AMETEORITE?That's right. And what we're doing now is opening these little bubbles one at atime and analyzing the droplets of water to determine what their composition isand try to figure out where it came from.IN THE NEWSPAPER HERE IN PHILADELPHIA, IT REFERRED TOIT AS BRINE BEING A SALTY WATER - AND IT IMMEDIATELYBROUGHT TO MY MIND AN OCEAN.Yeah, that's the thing. On the earth, you see sodium chloride usually formingwhen you have seas that evaporate - salty seas. And unless there is some otherorigin that we don't know about yet that is more likely, what this implies is thatthere was a lot of water present on some of these early solar system bodies. Andthese are early because we are able to date the mineral, the halite, and JohnBogard and others at the NASA Johnson Space Center are doing that. And thedates they are getting for the meteorite and the sodium chloride which contains"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"the water are about 4.5 to 4.6 billion years ago. And that's right at the very dawnof the solar system. So, this is very, very ancient water.FROM YOUR SPECULATION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THISWOULD BE ORIGINATING FROM SOMETHING LIKE A COMET ORFROM, LET'S SAY, ONE OF THE LUNAR BODIES SURROUNDING APLANET LIKE JUPITER OR SATURN - COULD THIS BE FROM ONEOF THOSE MOON BODIES?Probably not from one of those bodies themselves. But possibly from anidentical type body which might still be out as a comet or asteroid today. Manyof those bodies in the outer solar system there is a lot of ice around today. Butearly in our solar system's history, this ice would have been melted if theseasteroids out there had heated up some how. And there is plenty of evidencefrom meteorites that this indeed happened. There was some internal heat sourcethat caused a lot of these asteroids to kind of heat up briefly and cook for awhile stew, so to speak. The rocks sometimes got very, very hot indeed.WHAT WOULD DO THAT IN AN ASTEROID?We think it was from an element that was very radioactive. It would have beencreated and then been so radioactive that it decayed entirely away. And whenyou look for evidence of elements like that, there are actually a couple ofpossibilities: one is Aluminum 26 which decays to Magnesium 26. And there isevidence in meteorites that this happened that early in the history of the solarsystem, there was this very hot element, Aluminum 26, which was incorporatedinto small objects and building up toward the progenitors of planets anddecayed so rapidly that it heated the rock up all around them. And that wouldhave been enough to melt some ice that was there and promote water to bepresent and to move around and to react to the rocks.BUT WHY WOULD IT BE SALTY?Well, that's the big problem. See, to be salty, the water has to react to a wholelot of rock in order to remove enough chlorine and sodium to be salty. Whatthat means to have brine seems to imply that there was a lot of water aroundreacting with a lot of rock for a fair amount of time. It wouldn't have been just abrief instance of some water created and drying out immediately. It would haveto have been water around for awhile, kind of stewing for awhile to dissolve theconstituents of brine out of the rocks. And that could have happened.COULD THIS HAVE HAPPENED ON MARS AND COULD THIS BE AMETEORITE FROM MARS?No, it's not from Mars because rocks from Mars are totally different in terms ofmineralogy and the rock. So, this is definitely rock, not from a planet, but fromsome little planet-want-to-be, a little object that never quite got into a planetand never evolved beyond just heating up a little bit.WOULD EUROPA BE A LIKELY CANDIDATE SINCE IT'S SUPPOSEDTO HAVE A LOT OF WATER?It might be an analog a place where this same thing could have happened andbeen preserved until the present. In fact, there is some data from radar sensingEuropa that the sub-surface ocean is a brine also. And so it can be totallyanalogous to the situation with the meteorite.COULD THIS ACTUALLY BE A METEORITE FROM EUROPA?Uh, I don't know. It could be from anywhere in the outer solar system. I think it'sunlikely, but I can't say that it isn't. We just don't know. There are millions ofasteroids and there are many moons and we have only a few thousandmeteorites. And we don't know where almost any of them are from.WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP IN THIS STUDY OF THIS BRINE ANDTHESE BUBBLES? YOU'VE OPENED UP SOME. HAVE YOU FOUNDOUT ANYTHING MORE THAN WHAT HAS BEEN REPORTED SOFAR ?The next step is basically to begin to open up these little bubbles one at a timeand look at the composition of the water. And to also look at the isotopiccomposition of the water. And that data will basically tell us where the water"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"came from. That's the next step. It's very hard to do because the biggest of thesebubbles is only about 15 micrometers across. That's much smaller than a humanhair in diameter. So, it's very hard to do that work. But we're doing that nowalong with our collaborators.Also in the meantime, we've also found this in a second meteorite which fell lastyear in Morocco. Very similar circumstance. Fell in a very dry country and veryquickly got shipped back to the lab and there was the same thing inside: haliteswith water inside.WAS IT THAT SAME PURPLE-BLUE?It was more a midnight blue color, a very lovely blue color. Not quite as purpleas the first one.SUGGESTING IT HAD BEEN EXPOSED TO RADIATION?Oh, yeah, again. We haven't proceeded very far with analysis, but it looks likethe same thing. So, my guess is that this is going to turn out to be fairly common.It's just that if you don't get to the meteorite quickly or if you mistreat it bycutting it with water or washing it off, you're going to destroy all the evidenceinside.HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE ANY ISOTOPES FROMOPENING UP THESE BUBBLES SO FAR TO EVEN GIVE ASPECULATIVE GUESS ON THE ORIGIN?No, because the technique for doing that probably doesn't exist yet. There's onelab in Cambridge in England where they are working on a new instrument thatcan probably do this and they will probably be on line and ready to gosometime in this year. So, at that time, we'll give them a sample and they'll havea look at it.ANY POSSIBILITY THAT THERE'S ANY KIND OF A MICROBE INTHESE WATER BUBBLES?I hope not.MEANING?I don't think so.WHAT DO YOU MEAN, 'I HOPE NOT?'That would mean these are dangerous rocks. But we've had them around longenough and no one has gotten sick or anything. But also, you can look rightthrough the inclusions in the microscope and you can see if there were thingsswimming in there, you'd see them. And we don't see those. Also, the analysistechniques we use to look to verify there is water in the inclusions involvesshining a laser light through the inclusions and looking at the light coming outthe other side looking at the spectra. And that spectra would also tell us if therewere organics in the water. And there really isn't as far as we can determine. So,there is really no evidence for much organics in the water at all, much less anykind of microbe or anything.But you know, these meteorites I think have been falling on the earth for theentire history of the earth. If there were microbes in these meteorites, thenthey've been here longer than we've been here. So, they aren't anything reallynew.THIS COMBINATION OF SALT AND WATER BUBBLES INSIDE AMETEORITE THIS IS TRULY A FIRST IN ASTRONOMY SO FAR INTHIS CIVILIZATION?That's right.IF THIS HAPPENED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS SOLAR SYSTEM,THEN THE LIKELIHOOD WOULD BE THAT A WATERY SITUATIONWAS IN OTHER SOLAR SYSTEMS.That's right."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"THAT MEANS POSSIBLY MORE CHANCES FOR LIFE OUT THERE.That's right.
