It has the front and back images of a crucifiedman as if the linen had been wrapped around the body from the feet up over thehead and back down to the feet, leaving complete front and back images --including what appear to be bloodstains. The sharp detail of the bloodcombined with what appear to be teeth and bones on the cloth have provokedseveral scientists to hypothesize that intense radiation involving light and x-rayfrequencies produced the images on the linen. The Shroud was photographed in1931 and 1978 and you can visit www.shroud.com for more information aboutinternational Shroud research.One researcher is Thaddeus Trenn, Ph.D., Director of the Science and ReligionCourse Program at the University of Toronto, Canada. Prof. Trenn has an M. A.in Physics and a Ph.D. in the History of Science. He hypothesizes that the bodyinside the Shroud experienced a dematerialization due to the influx of intenseenergy that overcame the strong forces that bind the protons and neutrons, andreleased the matter into energy -- instantly. He was provoked into formulatinghis hypothesis by the work of other scientists who have shown evidence that theShroud images are x-rays. No one knows what excited x-rays in the bones andteeth to move outward through the skin into the linen, but Dr. Trenn thinks thatx-ray energy might be the by-product of the primary dematerialization event.Interview:Thaddeus Trenn, Ph.D., Director, Science and Religioin Course Program,University of Toronto, Canada: \"This is terribly hypothetical. I'm just simplysaying I see the x-ray phenomenon as a secondary event taking place after theprimary event that I'm talking about. That's where I come in with Carter and theothers. I'm starting with there was a triggering event that will release at thesecondary follow on event such things as the x-rays Giles Carter has noted.RIGHT. AND THE PRIMARY EVENT WHICH, AS DR. CARTER SAYS,COULD BE THE PROCESS OF RESURRECTION WHICH SCIENCEHAS NO KNOWLEDGE ABOUT, BUT IS AT LEAST A HANDLE TOPLACE ON IT. AND WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THISPROCESS OF RESURRECTION MIGHT HAVE BEEN THAT LEFTTHIS IMAGE ON THIS LINEN.Right. And my suggestion is that if you were to allow for the possibility that thestrong force could be overcome -- in other words, an influx of energy in theamount we already know what it has to be (1% of the mass), if that couldsomehow happen, then certain things would follow: And one of them is that thebinding of the protons and neutrons would no longer hold. You would have aseparation of the basic nucleons of matter. All your nuclei would come unstuck.And therefore, all these secondary phenomenon such as the release of x-rayswould take place. That's how it is. He called it he Resurrection Event. I'm simplysaying, all right, you can call it that. But there is a physical process here that ifwe could control in some way -- we can't, but if it could be somehowcontrolled, that would happen."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"AND THAT'S WHY THE DEMATERIALIZATION?And that's why the dematerialization.AND IF YOU WERE GOING FURTHER WITH THE HYPOTHESIS TOGIVE A WORD PICTURE OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO A BODYTHAT WOULD BE DEMATERIALIZING THIS WAY -- WHAT DO YOUTHINK WE MIGHT SEE?Well, you'd see the following -- first of all, you would see no more body. Itwould instantly be gone. All you would have is protons and neutrons in variousstates of energy and other particles that would come such as pions- they wouldbe about ten to the minus twenty-second seconds -- you would have the releaseof pions and muons, heavy electrons. These could in short range bombard thecloth and produce the effect you do see on the image.WOULD YOU AGREE THAT IT APPEARS TO BE AS MUCH ANX-RAY AS A PHOTOGRAPH?I know it's very controversial, but x-rays can make an image.AND THEN THE ISSUE WOULD BE: WHAT FORCE IN THEUNIVERSE COULD CONTAIN THAT AMOUNT OF ENERGY INFLUXTO CAUSE A DEMATERIALIZATION?Yes. And I don't think there is any in Nature. I don't think it's going to berepeated. I doubt very much if you are going to see us being able to control thissort of thing. It's a problem, it really is! And I'm not saying I have the answerhere by any means. I'm just saying that if you do allow for various things,including the x-rays that very likely are coming out. How could they possiblycome out unless there was a prior event of that sort.THAT EXCITED THE X-RAYS...Right.WITHIN THE BONES AND TEETH...Right, exactly. Where are these x-rays going to come from? And they wouldnaturally come as a spin-off from this kind of primary event.AND THEN IT IS THE QUESTION JUST LIKE TALKING ABOUTWHITE AND BLACK HOLES -- IS THIS A SINGULARITY? A UNIQUEEVENT?Right. And I have to say I think it is, but again, how can I prove it? You can'treally prove it. Such things, if they only happen once, obviously you can't proveit. But I'm looking for a physical trigger that could allow for -- if there arex-rays, these are physical things. Then why couldn't there be a physical priorevent? And what would that look like? And that's why I've come up with thisidea.But there's another reason -- and that's John Jackson's idea - I don't know if youhave read about this, but he sees distortions in the Shroud that indicate what hecalls the collapsing of the Shroud on the body itself. And it would have tohappen almost instantaneously for these kinds of distortions to happen. Andthen, one of the other gentlemen -- Goldstein, or Goldberg -- came up with theblood hypothesis -- that the blood on the Shroud was in fact de-coupled fromthe body itself in such a way there is no pulling away of the fibrils. And howcould this happen unless the body sort of disappeared instantly? In other words,it wasn't pulled out of there. Nobody taking the body out.RIGHT, AND THAT THE BLOOD HAS THIS REMARKABLESHARPNESS TO IT.Exactly. And you put those three things together and you come to theconclusion, I think, that something happened instantaneously that made itdisappear! Not that it was taken out, but it disappeared.THAT THE BODY LITERALLY DISAPPEARED LEAVING THEBLOOD INTACT WITH THE SHROUD."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Correct. And the x-rays would be a natural spin-off of such a disappearing.Well, what would that disappearing look like in terms of physics. And then youdo the calculation back and you find there is only one way -- and that is for theunits of matter that we ordinarily call nucleons of matter -- decouple. And theonly way to get that is to overcome the strong force. Incredible, as it seems, wecan back out into this Nowheresville -- it's an impossible situation. But, that'swhat you're left with.I SEE. AND THEN YOU GET TO, AS DR. CARTER SAID, WHAT ISTHE PROCESS OF RESURRECTION? -- WHICH WE HAVE AS AHUGE MYSTERY. AND THAT IN THAT PROCESS OFRESURRECTION THAT COULD BE A SINGULARITY, YOU ARESAYING THERE COULD HAVE BEEN AN INFLUX OF ENERGYEQUAL TO THAT IN, SAY THE FISSION OF AN ATOMIC BOMB, BUTAN INFLUX INTO THE BODY FROM A SOURCE UNKNOWN THATWOULD HAVE DECOUPLED THE NEUTRON, PROTON LEVEL ANDTHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INSTANT DEMATERIALIZATION...Weak dematerialization, as opposed to, for example, that any particular nucleonlike hydrogen would be evaporated.BUT THIS WOULD HAVE AFFECTED THE BODY LITERALLYDISAPPEARING MOLECULARLY FROM INSIDE THE SHROUDWHICH WOULD HAVE COLLAPSED ON THE STONE WITH THEBLOOD STILL INTACT ON THE SHROUD, BUT THE WHOLE BODYWOULD BE GONE.Yes, instantaneously. Like really instantaneously. So that when the collapsingtakes place in John Jackson's idea, that it would in fact be measuring -- thedistortion that he measured -- is actually an indication of the speed with whichthe body by gravity would be collapsing on top of the (cloth), and the bodywould be disappearing -- in other words, gravity is still pulling on the cloth. Andthe image of those x-rays and what I'm going to suggest, a special electron, aheavy electron -- I call them muons -- would be a byproduct also of thisDEMATERIALIZATION.Dematerialization that would impinge on a cloth that is moving, moving down.HAS ANYBODY EVER EXAMINED THE CAVE THAT IS STILL...?Good question. This is something that several people have suggested. Shouldn'tyou then in the Sepulchre, shouldn't you find some sort of distortion? This is awonderful idea, and you could have changes in the isotopic distribution on thesurface of the walls. You could imagine unusual isotopic conformities there.IN THE STONE.In the stone. Yes.WOULD THERE BE AN INCREASE IN NEUTRONS PRESENT?I would have thought so. It would be captured, these neutrons, would becaptured by other elements. But again, that's a question for geologists and otherswho are more competent in that sort of thing than I. But I think there could beeffects that you should explore.AND SO, A HYPOTHESIS COULD BE MADE THAT IF THERE WAS ADEMATERIALIZATION EVENT WHERE THE SHROUD WAS INSIDETHE CAVE THAT TODAY WE WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO FIND ANELEVATED NUMBER OF NEUTRONS IN THAT CAVE WALL?Not necessarily the neutrons, but in elements that were able to capture theseneutrons, you may see a ratio of the isotope of that particular element skewedslightly from the normal. Some of them would be heavier. You wouldn'tnecessarily find neutrons. You would find neutrons captured by some othernucleus. So you would find some heavy nuclei of a particular element, likesilicon for example, then you would find heavy silicon. It would be neutronscaptured some how by elements in the cave, in the rock.SO IF YOU COULD GET THE ROCK OR PIECE OF THE WALL INTHE CAVE AND ANALYZE IT FOR ISOTOPIC RATIO ANOMALIES..."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"There you go, that's exactly it. You've got it.WELL, THE CHURCH IS SUPPOSED TO ALLOW THE SHROUD TOBE SHOWN AGAIN IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. IS THERE ANYPOSSIBILITY THAT YOU AND OTHERS COULD TRY TO DO SOMEMORE TESTING DURING THAT TIME?I can't do any testing. I've talked this point up for the last 5 years to varioussources and maybe someone is going to take it in. But there is a way to test, avery simple way, without damaging cloth -- to check the uniformity orhomogeneity of carbon-14 throughout the cloth, say in the width. Is there aprofile? Is there some kind of differentiation that is non-uniform? If it'snon-uniform, then by definition, the assumption that was made in the 1988dating is flawed. The labs weren't to blame. It's just that they assumed whatevery normal scientist will assume -- that the sample they had is representativeof the whole.\" We b s it e s :www.shroud.comCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
