These can be seen clearly only from the air. On theground or from the car on the road, the large spiral and Celtic knot with side\"signature\" are barely visible.Spiral discovered in Stanton St. Bernard, Wiltshire, wheat nearCeltic Knot on August 14, 1999, in same field as the earlier June 23 pictogram.Aerial Photograph © 1999 by Peter Sorensen.Celtic Knot aerial videograph retouched by photographer Peter Sorensenon computer to remove tramlines so pattern can be seen moreeasily. Aerial videograph © 1999 by Peter Sorensen.As we approached the spiral first, the downed wheat formed a narrow corridornot more than four feet wide that wound several hundred feet into a beautifulcoiled center from which other wheat plants stood upright, almost like a crownat the end of the flattened corridor. In downed wheat along the edges, we foundsoftened and stretched growth nodes - one of the biophysical changes that havebeen noticed in unusual formations since the early 1990's.Then we moved into the tramline to walk several more yards to an amazing"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"\"Celtic knot\" made of wheat stems laid down in many layers, some crossing atninety degree angles, others laying 180 degrees from each other like hair parteddown the middle. The complex pattern also contained softened and stretchedgrowth nodes. Peter Sorensen used his computer graphic tools to remove thetramlines in the Celtic Knot so that its pattern could be seen more easily.A few yards away was a large, flat circle with a curled tail and a small \"grapeshot\" outside. That circle and curled tail \"signature,\" as researchers call it, isvery similar to a signature that emerged in 1992. This year of 1999, othersignatures have been found outside formations, including nearly identical smalland delicate patterns at Cherhill and Liddington Castle.On August 12th, the day after the total solar eclipse, four large rings were founddirectly west of Liddington Castle near Swindon. The two central rings overlap,forming a vesica pisces symbol.The most astonishing formation in August so far is known as the \"Basket\"because of its intricate weaving. Discovered on August 4th after several of ussaw mysterious blue lights from Woodborough Hill and Alton Barnes, thebasket's inner circles form seven arms that are reminiscent of the very largeformation discovered the morning of July 31st at Roundway Hill. Roundway isimmediately on the other side of the hill from the new basket pattern and thetwo locations are in a straight line with Silbury Hill and Avebury. RoundwayHill had seven \"petals\" alternately separated by seven circles. John Williams andAlan March of Harlow, Essex who found Roundway were first afraid to enterbecause there was so much loud, snapping electrostatic energy coming from thewheat plants.

Ulrich was running Peter's videocamera at the time as a favor while Ulrich photographed with his 35mm camera.Since returning to Philadelphia on the evening of August 16th, I have learnedthat another simple circle was found that morning in the wheat field directlyacross the road from Silbury Hill where at least half a dozen formations focusedthis year. Since the first of August in Wiltshire, there has been so much rain thatsome harvesting has been delayed and we all wonder if the circlemakers will yettry to remake their intricate basket this year or next year?We b s it e s :http://cropcircleconnector.com/Sorensen/PeterSorensen99.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
