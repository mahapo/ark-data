S. Storm PredictionCenter, says many lives were probably saved by the biggest one becauseeveryone in the weather service could see it coming. That was the F5 vortex thatlevelled whole subdivisions in Okahoma City. F5s are considered to be one ofthe most powerful storms on earth and this one was a mile wide and ten mileshigh so huge that storm trackers could give warnings for more than two hours.Unlike typical tornadoes that break up after moving only a few miles, this F5traveled 55 miles in a steady path at about 25 miles an hour before breaking up.At one point, police stopped traffic along Route 44 to allow the tornado to passas it headed toward Oklahoma City. And storm shelters were filling up beforethe monstrous tornado struck.Another kind of catastrophe could come without any warning and the ClintonAdministration is trying to anticipate and upgrade American preparedness. Thethreat is bioterrorism the release of dangerous bacteria or viruses in aerosols.Two of the most feared are anthrax and small pox. Anthrax exposure can comethrough breathing in the spores, or the spores can be absorbed through sores andcuts. Anthrax does not spread person to person. But small pox does spreadperson to person very rapidly. Both anthrax and small pox have high mortalityrates.The man charged with trying to increase awareness of bioterrorism and what todo about it is Dr. Donald Henderson, Professor of Medicine and Public Healthat Johns Hopkins University. Recently he was appointed Director of a newCenter for Civilian Biodefense Studies in Baltimore. He told me that bioterroristattacks are now considered a much greater risk because of at least three events inIraq, Japan and Russia.Interview:Donald Henderson, M. D., Professor of Medicine and Public Health, JohnsHopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland: \"One is the 1995 defection ofSaddam Hussein's son-in-law and with him a great many papers detailing theextent and sophistication of the Iraqi bioweapons program which is far greaterthan anybody had imagined it to be.WHAT ARE THE GREATEST DANGERS IN IT?They are primarily working with we know they are working with anthrax. Thatthis is an organism that is very hardy when it's produced in dried form, it can beput up in an aerosol. By an aerosol, I mean very fine particles that can bebreathed in and taken into the lung and it's a very fatal disease.WHAT ARE THE FIRST SYMPTOMS OF ANTHRAX?Well, the person just feels sort of ill, generally ill. And has a sort of heaviness inthe chest. Headache maybe. Maybe some fever. And then very often, it's a fairlyrapid course and resulting in death often in one to three days."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"IN ONE TO THREE DAYS. AND DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME,HOW DO THE SYMPTOMS CHANGE?Well, the individual will have increasingly high fever, will look increasingly sick,may have all sorts of pains and a number of things from convulsions to goodnessknows what it depends upon what the organism attacks. Now, we know that ifwe give monkeys one or even two doses of anthrax vaccine, that by the end of30 days, the individual will have protection. And anthrax behaves peculiarly inthat the first cases after an attack would come down probably within two tothree days. But cases could continue to occur as a result of that exposure up totwo months afterwards.YOU MEAN THERE COULD BE A DELAYED ONSET OFSYMPTOMS?Yes. So you've got a lot of cases that can occur early on and some will occur aslate as two months after the exposure. So what you want to do is try to figureout how to protect people who have been exposed and who might get thedisease later on. There, if you use antibiotics, it is clear that you can prevent thedisease from developing.RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF STRATEGIZING, WHAT IS YOURPERCEPTION ON HOW YOU WOULD HANDLE AN ANTHRAXEXPOSURE FROM YOUR CENTER'S POINT OF VIEW?Basically what you would want to do is begin with antibiotics immediately forall individuals who are thought to have been exposed. As soon as you possiblycould.IF IT''S AN AEROSOL EXPOSURE OVER A LARGE CITY ANDYOU'RE NOT SURE WHETHER IT'S IN THE HUNDREDS ORTHOUSANDS, WOULD WE HAVE ENOUGH ANTIBIOTICS TO COPEWITH SUCH A SITUATION?Not at the moment. And this is the reason for developing a stockpile andprovision for creation of a stockpile is in the President's budget was for this year this is partly funded out of monies made available this year. There is a requestfor additional monies next year.ARE THOSE ANTIBIOTICS IN VOLUME AVAILABLE YET, OR WILLIT BE ANOTHER YEAR?I don't know when they will be available. I can't answer that. The thought is notto try to put them all in a warehouse and stash them away, but to try to workwith the manufacturers so that the antibiotics that are called for are antibiotics inregular use for other diseases. And so the idea would be to work with them todevelop some sort of a reserve stock of vaccine which would be a bubble in apipeline of supply, so that a lot of it could be satisfied in that manner.IF SOMEONE SAID TO YOU 'DR. HENDERSON, I DON'T WANT ANANTHRAX VACCINE BECAUSE I'M AFRAID OF IT.' WHAT WOULDYOU SAY TO THEM?All I could say is that we've been through the evidence and the reactions arevery low in number. They are safer than many of the vaccines that are out thereon the market right now. It is highly protective and the result of inhaling anthraxspores out there is a pretty fatal business. I think it's crazy to be gambling not totake the vaccine.I THINK THE ARMY HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT SOME SORT OFMILITARY PUNISHMENT BECAUSE THEY HAVE HAD RESISTANCEAMONG THEIR TROOPS.That's right. I think we have people who resist, do not want to be vaccinated forwhatever reason and they are not subject to reason on this at all.IF THE PERSON HAS THE ANTHRAX VACCINE, WHAT WOULD BETHE TYPICAL 24 OR 36 HOUR EFFECT AFTER?I suppose less than 1% would have a little fever and sore arm.THAT''S IT?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"That's it!HOW LIKELY DO YOU AND THE INTELLIGENCE PEOPLE WHOARE WORKING ON THIS BIOTERRORISM THREAT THINKSOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD HAPPEN AS A RESULT OF PEOPLEEITHER FROM THE MIDDLE EAST OR SOMEPLACE ELSE?The general consensus is that it's very unlikely to occur, but the fact is that if itDID occur, it would be ultimate catastrophe. And whereas, we thought at one itwas so improbable that it did not warrant taking special measures, at this pointin time, I think we feel very differently about it. I talked with you about the Iraqsituation that's only one part of the equation which has alerted us that we've gota bigger problem than we thought.The second issue was the Japanese cult that released sarin gas in the subways ofTokyo in 1995. Then we discovered they had been working with anthrax andbotulinim, a toxin they had tried on eight different occasions to aerosolize thisthroughout central Tokyo with hopes of killing literally hundreds of thousandsof people. Now, they failed. But it was a technical failure. They were reallyintent on doing this. That group is still intact still running a series of commercialenterprises and still taking in money.And the third thing, is the Russians themselves who through the word ofdefectors, we have been informed that Russia mounted a very major bioweapons program beginning somewhere way back intensified in the 1970s andagain in the 1980s and it produced huge quantities of organisms.IN THE 1990S, WHAT IS THE STATUS IN RUSSIA?I think we have only a partial reading on what they have and a lot of it isunknown as to how much capacity and stockpiling they now have.IF THERE WAS NO MAINTENANCE IN RUSSIA, THERE COULD BELEAKAGE?I think that's probably less likely than the problem that the scientists are notbeing regularly paid. Guards at these facilities are not regularly being paid. Andwe know that many have left those facilities for other countries.WHAT IS THE FBI AND CIA PERSPECTIVE ON ANY KIND OFRELEASE OF BIOLOGICAL PATHOGENS FROM RUSSIA BECAUSEOF THIS INABILITY TO KEEP THINGS MONITORED AND SECURE?There are a lot of things you just don't know. And you can't estimate thelikelihood of something going on. I think it's much more difficult to know what'shappening with biological weapons than either nuclear or chemical weapons.Because the work can all be done in a very small area, very inexpensively,involving comparatively few people. The product is very small and hard todetect. You really have difficulty getting information on this.COMPARED TO BOMBS, WE'RE DEALING WITH SOMETHINGTHAT IS SO MUCH MORE COMPLEX AND HAS SO MANY MOREUNKNOWNS THAT IN MANY WAYS IT''S MUCH MOREDANGEROUS?This is what Colin Powell said in fact. His statement was that he is more afraidof the biologic weapons than either chemical or nuclear.WHAT IS YOUR OWN PERSPECTIVE AS A PROFESSIONALDOCTOR WHO IS NOW HEADING THIS CENTER ONBIOTERRORISM AS WE MOVE NOW INTO 2000?I think it's a real worry.WHAT IS THE WORST CASE SCENARIO THAT YOU WOULDANTICIPATE?Well, I think a small pox epidemic would be the worst thing we could think of.MORE SO THAN ANTHRAX?Yes, because it keeps spreading and at this point in time, we don't have verymuch vaccine."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THE SYMPTOMS OF SMALL POX WOULD BE WHAT?A person about 12 to 14 days after exposure develops very high fever and achingpains. And then begins to develop a rash which are like little vesicles that formpimples and pustules fill up with puss and extends over the body with heavieston the face and arms. It is a very severe disease -- probably the most feareddisease of all the infectious diseases and about 30% of the people die.IT IS FEARED BECAUSE IT DOES DAMAGE TO INTERNALORGANS?Because it spreads from person to person. And 30% of the people die of thedisease. And there is no treatment.NO TREATMENT FOR SMALL POX AT ALL?None at all.IT COULD BE EASILY SPREAD IN AN AEROSOL BECAUSE IT'S SOCONTAGIOUS PERSON TO PERSON?It could spread and keep spreading.IT''S AIRBORNE?Yes. Whereas anthrax is not spread person to person. Smallpox does.HOW DOES ANTHRAX SPREAD? DO YOU HAVE TO BREATH IT IN?Yeah, but it does not spread from person to person.\"IS THE PRODUCTION OF MORE SMALL POX VACCINE PART OFTHE PRESIDENT'S NEW PROGRAM?It is.WHEN DO YOU THINK THAT WILL BE IN PLACE?At least three years.OVER THESE NEXT THREE YEARS, THE VIGILANCE WILL BE ONTHE BACK OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY?Well, there is vaccine. But it's not in large supply. So anything you use, youwould have to use very prudently.More Information:I learned from Dr. Henderson that the U. S. Army Medical Research Institutestudied the release of anthrax by aerosols in the 1960s during tests in the SouthPacific. The Army wanted to learn how far anthax spores would travel in the airand cause disease. Their test subjects were monkeys. The answer was at leastfifty miles. If the spores aren't breathed in by animals or humans, those thatsettle onto soil can still cause disease if kicked up into the air or get into soresand cuts.I welcome comments and questions from listeners and current news about theenvironment, science, medicine and unusual phenomena. The crop circle seasonis underway in England, a cattle mutilation was reported in Colorado a few daysago, and I'll have updates on those and other anomalies in the weeks ahead.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expressly"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"prohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
