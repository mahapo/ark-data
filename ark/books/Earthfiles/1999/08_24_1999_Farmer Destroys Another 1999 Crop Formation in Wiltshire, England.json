First, another formation has been destroyed by an angry farmer.Peter Sorensen, Videographer:E-mail: \"On Monday morning (August 23, 1999), I heard that there was a big,new formation at Allington and immediately arranged to fly. Agonizingly, whenI reached it at 11:30 AM, the farmer had already cut it out just like the Basket(August 4, 1999). The design is not discernible in the stubble. It was nearly fivetramlines across - bigger than the Cherhill star by more than a tramline. It waslarge enough to be our Grand Finale (for 1999), but we will never know(because) I don't think enough of the design remains to show what it looked like.In my sadness and anger, I could hardly hold my camera steady!Allington formation of rings cut down on August 23, 1999 beforean aerial photograph of the design could be taken.

But there are many thousands of us who are grateful for all thewonderful gifts and thank (the circlemakers) beyond measure for a mostspectacular season!\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Interior of beautiful \"Basket\" formation discovered August 6, 1999at Bishops Cannings before the farmer erased it entirely with his tractor againstall please to temporarily save it.
