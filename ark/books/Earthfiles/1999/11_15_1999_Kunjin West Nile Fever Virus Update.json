It looks much more like thereare sequences very similar in another part ofthe world, but that doesn't tell us anythingabout how it might have been introduced. Andthat is obviously cause for some concern.\"- W. Ian Lipkin, M.D., Univ. of California atIrvine -November 15, 1999 University of California-Irvine By the time the firstfrost touched Philadelphia this fall, dead crows and other birds in a couple ofsuburbs had been sent to laboratories to see if the Kunjin West Nile Fever Virushad spread from New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. The Pennsylvania testresults are due soon and public health officials are concerned about theimplications for next spring and summer. For the first time in history, this virusstrain normally found only in Africa, Australia, the Middle East and Eurasiashowed up in the United States. Fifty-six people in New York City were infectedwith the foreign virus and seven died, along with dozens of crows that areespecially sensitive to the West Nile Virus. Transmission of the disease isthrough ticks, mites or mosquitoes that bite birds. Bird blood fills up with thevirus rapidly over several days. During that time, insects can bite infected birdsand then bite a human who can also become ill.Photograph of Culex pipiens female mosquito,courtesy Entomology Image Gallery.\"The normal cycle for West Nile involves mosquito to bird to mosquito - justround and around and around,\" said James Meegan, an expert in the West Nilevirus at the National Institutes of Health. \"These mosquitoes aren't interested inbiting humans. When the mosquito starts biting humans, the virus spills out ofits natural cycle.\"Birds bitten by infected mosquitoes are infectious from four to eight days. Thevirus incubation period in humans is five to fifteen days. Most people fight off"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the West Nile Fever Virus without getting sick. For those who do get sick, thefatality rate is not very high, about ten to fifteen percent. But despite the lowfatality rate and cumbersome transmission cycle, speculation emerged that theWest Nile Fever virus might have been artificially engineered as a bioterrorismweapon by scientists working for Saddam Hussein or other U. S. enemies todeliberately hurt Americans.That question and others were the subject of a meeting last week in Ft. Collins,Colorado. Attendees included the U. S. Army, the World Health Organization(WHO), the Center for Disease Control; and Ian Lipkin, M. D., themicrobiologist who first sequenced enough of the virus from New York Cityfatalities to be confident in reporting the surprising news that it was Kunjin WestNile Fever.Interview:W. Ian Lipkin, M.D., Director of the Emerging Diseases Laboratory andProfessor of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Anatomy and NeuralBiology and Neurology, University of California-Irvine: \"The data that iscoming out of our lab and the CDC lab is fairly similar and suggests that thevirus is indeed a West Nile Virus as reported. The actual analyses of sequences isvery interesting, but unfortunately my understanding is that there is an embargoon that because there is an article the CDC has submitted to a major journal ashave we, so nobody wants to say anything about it because that wouldjeopardize publication.IS THIS AROUND THE IDEA AS TO WHETHER THE VIRUS WASARTIFICALLY SEQUENCED?No, it's not, actually. I don't think there is any data for that now. I think whathas happened is that some sequences have been found that suggests its origins.At this point, I think it's very unlikely that it was an engineered virus. It looksmuch more like there are sequences very similar in another part of the world,but that doesn't tell us anything about how it might have been introduced. Andthat is obviously cause for some concern.IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH BIOTERRORISMAND GENETIC MANIPULATION, WHY WOULD THERE BE ANEMBARGO ON ANY OTHER INFORMATION?Because if something is released to the press before publication, most of themajor journals won't accept the publication. That's just the way these journalsare.FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW, THE DIRECTION YOU WOULDLIKE TO PUBLISH WOULD HAVE TO DO WITH THE SOURCE OFTHIS VIRUS ORIGINALLY?Right. That's correct.AND THAT'S WHERE BOTH PARTIES ARE TRYING TO PUBLISH?I would presume that. I couldn't speak for them (CDC). But just having comingback from this meeting where there were a number of press representatives, theywere told they could not publish anything on the data presented. That wasstated publicly.AND THE SOURCE OF THE VIRUS WILL HAVE RELEVANCE INTERMS OF TRYING TO DETERMINE HOW IT GOT INTO THISCOUNTRY?Yes, it has relevance for that. But the other issue is that these things areinstructive as we begin to think about the importance of global surveillance andunderstanding what needs to be done to protect the public.ARE YOU SAYING IT MAY HAVE BEEN A VIRUS THAT WASDELIBERATELY PLANTED?I'm not saying that. We don't know how the virus got here. All we're saying is"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"that as a result of genetic analyses of sequences that are present here andelsewhere in the world, we may have some ideas as to where it originated. Butthese viruses can be spread by migrating birds, it can be spread by people, theycan be spread by humans infected with the virus, or by a whole host of differentmechanisms. So, it's going to be very difficult to figure out how this wasintroduced, deliberate or not (to the Northern Hemisphere).WHEN MIGHT YOU BE PUBLISHED?We have no idea. CDC and I are in competition. But what was clear is that whenthese data were presented that we have reached the same conclusion.WOULD IT BE FAIR FOR ME TO REPORT THAT BASED ON ACONVERSATION WITH YOU THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OFARTIFICIAL GENOME SEQUENCING?It's very reasonable for you to say that there is in fact no evidence that there'sbeen an engineered virus. This West Nile Fever virus has now been sequencedindependently by the CDC and the Univ. of Calif.-Irvine. CDC worked from atissue culture isolate and ours was directly from the brain of infected humans.Now that we have the full sequence available, we have learned that there is noevidence for bio-engineering here and that we have other insights into thegeographic origins of the virus.\"More Information:The Kujin West Nile Fever Virus has been confirmed in eighteen species ofbirds, includin robins, blue jays, bald eagles and crows in New York, NewJersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Maryland. So many more infected speciesmeans the virus could spread as the birds migrate south.The discovery of the Kunjin/West Nile virus in New York and surroundingcommunities underscores an issue of growing concern among public healthexperts the speed and frequency with which foreign microbes are entering the U.S. They are coming in through air travel, global tourism and international trade.For example, the number of malaria cases in New York has been going up adirect result of people bringing the disease back from the tropics. Humans makethe problem worse by cutting down forests that force birds into moreconcentrated areas where disease can spread more easily.This encephalitis outbreak and the associated human deaths show that whenmicrobes are released into an environment where they have not been before, themicrobes can be especially dangerous because what they infect has no immunityagainst them. Back in 1918, there was a world pandemic called \"the swine flu\"which killed an estimated twenty million people worldwide and more than halfa million people in the United States. The reason was that a virus crossed overinto pigs and then transferred into people who had no immunity. Could anotherpandemic occur?Communication without delay has been stressed and hospitals have been askedto contact their particular State's Department of Health immediately if there areany suspected or confirmed cases of St. Louis Encephalitis or West Nile Fevervirus. Individuals who find one or more dead birds should report the location totheir local health department.We b s it e s :http://www.cdc.gov/http://www.who.org/http://www.health.state.ny.us/"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"http://www.state.nj.us/healthhttp://www.reutershealth.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
