Now researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee areusing microscopic spinach proteins for electronic devices. Spinach leaves are putin a blender and processed down to microscopic proteins called chloroplaststhat convert light into chemical energy. The next step is a scientific breakthroughfirst done by physicist Dr. Elias Greenbaum at the Oak Ridge National Lab. Heputs the spinach proteins into a platinum solution to get a metal coating. Thismarriage between the plant and mineral world could make silicon chips obsoletein another ten years. I asked Dr. Greenbaum why spinach?Interview:Elias Greenbaum, Ph.D., Physicist, Oak Ridge National Lab, Oak Ridge,Tennessee: \"Spinach is an easy plant to work with. All plants essentiallyconvert light energy to chemical energy by about the same mechanism. There are2 photosynthesis reaction centers -- 2 parts of the plant that capture lightenergy. And the energy contained in the light gets converted into electricalenergy before the plants finally transform it to chemical energy. So, the valuableproduct of plants can be thought of in two ways:First, there are stable chemical molecules such as starch which is the food stuffthat we eat.Second, the other is the electrical energy which appears before the chemicalenergy is produced. We're interested in working on both of those aspects howplants convert light into electrical energy and into chemical energy.For example, in the case of chemical energy, we would like to use green plantsto split water to molecular hydrogen and oxygen there the energy-rich product ishydrogen and that could be used in a fuel cell to make electricity.Or we can tap in earlier in the chemical and physical processes before thechemical energy is made earlier step of the creation of electrical energy. Andthat could be used to make molecular electronic devices.WHEN I THINK OF A SPINACH LEAF, I CAN SEE THAT DEEPGREEN WITH PURPLE VEINS. WHAT IS IT THAT YOU AREACTUALLY GETTING FROM THE LEAVES TO USE IN THISELECTRONIC RESEARCH?OK, suppose we do a fantastic voyage type experiment where we go into the leafand magnify the surroundings. The size of the leaf, say on a bush or tree,typically might be a tenth of a meter. Imagine magnifying the leaf one billiontimes 1,000,000,000. That will bring you down to the molecular scale. If youcould walk around the leaf at that molecular scale and look at the membranenow on a nanometer scale ó nano means 1/1 billionth of a meter ó that typicallyis the size of molecules in membranes where all of the useful work ofphotosynthesis is being done for the conversion of light energy into chemicalenergy."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"If you could look at the membranes ó which is what electron microscopes doand that's how I'm able to tell you what the description is ó you would seemolecular structures. These are small structures made up of proteins that capturelight energy and do the first step in converting light energy into chemical energy.That first step is the ejection of an electron -- the electron is one of the parts ofthe molecule ó the ejection of the electron from one side of the membrane to theother. That ejection of the electron is the separation of electrostatic charges. So,the electron that has a negative charge moves to the far side of the membraneleaving behind a positive charge. That plus/minus charge operation is a creationof electrostatic potential energy. And that's the first step in the creation ofchemical energy from light energy.So, what we do is we have methods for extracting the molecular componentsfrom that membrane and then purifying them using standard biochemicaltechniques. So you have purified amounts of these key photosynthetic reactioncenters that are essentially little molecular photovoltaic devices -- they are likelittle silicon cells. When a photon is absorbed in the reaction center, it triggersthis charge separation and it creates an electrical potential or a voltage. Thatsource of energy is what drives the energy rich products of photosynthesis.WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS ESSENTIALLY GOING DOWN TO THEMOLECULAR LEVEL IN THE SPINACH LEAF LOOKING FORTHESE PROTEIN CENTERS THAT ARE INVOLVED WITH TAKINGIN PHOTON ENERGY AND RELEASING ELECTRONS?Right. Now, the recent discovery that we've made curiously this one discovery ofthe molecular electronic properties actually does not relate directly to the lightabsorbing properties. We've shown that these there are two discoveries thatwe've made: one is after we've extracted and purified these photo system reactioncenters the one we work with is called Photo System One. It's one of the tworeaction centers in photosynthetic tissue.THESE ARE PROTEINS?They are pigment protein complexes. It's protein into which a chlorophyll isembedded. So the green color that you see in plants is largely the chlorophyllpigments. That chlorophyll pigment is embedded into a protein scaffold so thatthe chlorophyll molecules are held in precise positions, locations andorientations in the membrane. That's why the work of photosynthesis can bedone.IS IT THE CHLOROPHYLL MOLECULE ITSELF THAT IS UNIQUE INTAKING IN PHOTON ENERGY AND RELEASING ELECTRONS?Only one out of every 300 chlorophyll molecules has that unique property. Ifyou look at a plant ó and spinach is no exception ó most of that chlorophyll isnot doing the electron transfer reaction that I mentioned earlier. For every onethat actually does that special ejection of an electron across the membrane, thereare 200 to 300 chlorophyll molecules whose only purpose is to act like anantennae to capture light from the sun. It's like holding an umbrella upside downin the rain where if the umbrella is opened up, the bigger the umbrella, the morerain drops you'll capture. But all of those raindrops get funneled to the bottomof the umbrella. And the bigger the umbrella, the more drops it can capture in agiven amount of time. That's how the chlorophyll molecules work in the plant.There are about 200 to 300 of those chlorophyll molecules that catch thephoton. And then they sort of do a relay race, tag team match, where the photongets handed from chlorophyll molecule to chlorophyll molecule to where finallyit hits the magic chlorophyll ó the reaction center chlorophyll ó and KABOOM!-- the charge transfer takes place.That's where we come in. We try to capture that. But what we've shown in thatreaction center (and the discovery we reported at the Centennial Meeting of theAmerican Physical Society) is that the reaction centers can be oriented on a"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"2-dimensional surface. Now, remember they have been removed from thespinach leaf. There is no more spinach now when we're working with it. It's justreaction centers and pigment protein complexes.THAT WILL RELEASE ELECTRONS.That's right. If you look at them in solution, you can see the green color. But ofcourse, they are much too small to see the individual ones because they are only5 nanometers ó or 5 billionths of a meter. But we have studied these with atechnique called scanning tunneling spectroscopy where we can measure theproperties of single photosynthetic reaction centers. And we've discovered thatthey can be oriented on a 2-dimensional surface if that surface is chemicallyprepared in a correct way. And also that they behave like little diodes --rectification junctions. In other words, a diode is an electronic component. Andwhat it does is to conduct electricity easily in one direction, but with difficultyin the opposite direction. So, it's a rectifier. And we have shown that thephotosynthetic reaction center behaves like a molecular rectifier or a moleculardiode. So that is a genuine molecular component that could be used in theconstruction of other molecular components.SENDING ELECTRONS ONE WAY?Right. That is a standard component that you find in molecular circuits. Now, ifyou take that molecular diode and put it in conjunction with small scalemolecular resistors, you begin to have the first steps of constructing molecularlogic devices which are the elementary building blocks of computers. So, that'ssort of where we're going, but we're no where near there. That's sort of the logicand rationale of where our work is pointing. We would like to be able toconstruct logic devices from these molecular structures.HOW MUCH SMALLER WOULD THE SPINACH PROTEIN ENERGYFACTORIES, WE'LL CALL THEM, BE COMPARED TO WHAT ANINTEL PENTIUM CHIP RIGHT NOW IS WORKING ON?If you give me the advantage of a wish list and say we can do the best thattheoretically we could do -- then we'd be talking about a factor of 100 to a1000.YOU MEAN YOU COULD MAKE THINGS THAT MUCH SMALLER?Yeah, that much smaller because of the structures. But that's only the idealizedsituation. It's sort of a wish list situation. It's sort of the rationale for moving inthat direction.There is another factor we should keep in mind also... that conventional siliconlithography -- those guys can do great things. Don't get me wrong. It's reallywonderful what can be done with conventional silicon lithography.WHICH IS HOW THEY MAKE THESE INTEL CHIPS?Oh, yeah. But the cost of getting smaller and smaller keeps increasing. Thesmaller you want to go, the greater is the capital investment in the facility that isneeded to make them. So, what we're hoping is that a fundamentally differentphilosophy in the approach we are taking that is, we would like to use thetechnique of directed self-assembly, directed molecular self-assembly such thatthese microscopic structures essentially assemble themselves in very much thesame way that biological systems assemble themselves. The fact that livingsystems exist is the best proof that bio-technology on the nanometer scaleactually works because those reaction centers that I mentioned earlier in thephotosynthetic membranes are very much identical to the way molecularstructures are embedded in all biological membranes. They self-assemble andthey orient and they do their job in a spontaneous way. So that's the approachthat is fundamentally different philosophically we would like to use thistechnique for directed self-assembly and avoid this high energy, high intensive,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"high capital intensive process for constructing devices.IT SOUNDS AS IF YOU ARE DESCRIBING A TECHNOLOGY IN THENEAR FUTURE IN WHICH THERE WILL BE INCREASINGCOMBINATIONS OF WHAT WE MIGHT CALL THE MINERAL-MATTER WORLD AND THE BIOLOGICAL WORLD.Yes. In fact, one of the aspects of our work we were the first to show that wecould make direct electrical contact with the electron I referred to earlier thatgets ejected from the Photo System One Reaction Center. We've actuallydiscovered methods to precipitate metallic platinum right onto the surface of thephotosynthetic membrane where the electrons emerge. And we've madeelectrical contact with those electrons and we can catalytically evolve molecularhydrogen because the platinum metal cluster is a good catalyst for hydrogenevolution. So, that discovery is an example of what you are talking about. It'ssort of this composite new properties that are endowed to material that isderived from biological material. In this case, it is spinach membranes and thenew property is useful and one which did not exist before namely, thepossibility of splitting water to molecular hydrogen and oxygen under theinfluence of light.IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY, YOU WOULD HAVE THESPINACH PROTEIN ENERGY FACTORIES COATED WITH A THINLAYER OF PLATINUM THAT THEN HAS A CATALYTIC FUNCTIONOF PRODUCING HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN.From water.YOU COULD THEN TAKE THE PLANTS COMBINED WITH THEPLATINUM AND CREATE FUEL CELLS TO PROVIDE ENERGY?We would produce hydrogen which in turn could be used in fuel cells to makeelectricity. And that's a carbon-neutral process for energy production.THERE WOULD BE NO CARBON POLLUTION.No net production of carbon dioxide.HOW FAR INTO THE FUTURE REALISTICALLY DO YOU THINKYOUR CURRENT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT HAS TO GOBEFORE WHAT WE'VE JUST DISCUSSED WOULD BE WORKING INTHE WORLD AROUND US?Right, I think it's important to understand that this is all fundamental sciencethat we're studying right now. But it is fundamental science with a missiontowards solving a practical problem. So, I think we are at least five or ten yearsin the fundamental science stage of developing the limiting aspects of hydrogenproduction, of understanding the molecular structures of the photosyntheticmembranes for constructive molecular electronic devices. I think we are lookingat 5 to 10 years of largely laboratory based fundamental research before we'llhave enough information to understand what the next step is in practicaldevelopment.HAVE YOU DISCOVERED ANY KIND OF PROBLEMS WITHINTERFACING THESE BIOLOGICAL PROTEINS WITH METALLICMOLECULES?Oh, sure. That is one of the focus areas of our research. Essentially wiring thesemolecules together. There is no easy way to do that now. The ability to wiremolecules on a wide scale basis and to get them to function in a reliable way.IS THERE SOME NATURAL RESISTANCE BETWEEN THE ORGANICMOLECULES IN THE SPINACH PLANT AND THE METALLICMOLECULES OF THE PLATINUM?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"No, they need not be. It depends upon the chemistry of interaction between thepigment protein complexes of the photosynthetic reaction centers and thechemical species that is used to convert or produce the precipitation of metal. Soby understanding these surface chemistries between the bio world and theinorganic bio world, compatibility can be achieved between them.IS YOURS THEN THE VERY FIRST DISCOVERY RELATED TOBEING ABLE TO PUT THE PLATINUM COATING ON THEPROTEINS?Yes, it is.\"More Information:Dr. Rosenbaum's spinach/platinum work is funded by the Office of Basic EnergySciences and Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy in the U. S.Department of Energy.
