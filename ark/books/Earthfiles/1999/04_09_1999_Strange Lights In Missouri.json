In this beautiful Victorian resort town of artists and writers, thedogwood and redbud trees are flowering everywhere as if all were right in theworld.Amazon Rain Forest Destruction AcceleratingBut trees in another part of the planet are not so lucky. This week, the respectedscience journal Nature published results of an aerial survey of Brazil's Amazonrain forest. Aerial photographs show the rain forest is being destroyed, or badlydamaged, more than TWICE as fast as believed. Ecologist Daniel Nepstad of theWoods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts said 17,000 square miles ofAmazon rain forest was destroyed in 1998 alone.The official Brazilian government estimate in 1998 was only 5700 square miles,a much lower false number to be more politically acceptable. Dr. Nepstad saysthat conservatively at least 16% of the original Amazon rain forest has beendestroyed and continues to be at an accelerating rate.Scientists have long warned that the rain forests must be preserved because theyare home to one-third of the world's plant and animal species. Dr. RobertSanford, a University of Denver ecologist said:\"As we lose species, we don't know which one is the critical one, the keystonespecies that results in the whole system falling apart.\"The researchers also worry about huge quantities of carbon dioxide entering theatmosphere from all the files and rotting wood left by the loggers whichcontributes to another big planetary problem: global warming. Organizationssuch as The Nature Conservancy are trying to buy rain forest land to protect it,and I urge radio listeners to contact The National Conservancy to find out howyou can help. Their web site is: www.tnc.org. Toxic Rain Water in EuropeIn other disturbing environmental news, researchers at the Swiss FederalInstitute for Environment Science and Technology report that rain falling inEurope is so full of toxic pesticides that much of it is too dangerous to drink. Dr.Stephen Muller said European rain water samples contained so much pesticide2-4-dinitrophenol that the amounts were four times limits set by the EuropeanUnion for safe drinking water. Strange Lights in MissouriIn other news, two hundred miles north of where we are now in Arkansas, 40residents of a farm community in Missouri have been seeing brilliant, glowing"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"spheres forming various patterns since December 15th, 1989 to this first week ofApril 1999. Four of the eyewitnesses have managed to capture some of themysterious glowing spheres on videotape. The investigator who is studying thesituation is Ted Phillips. Mr. Phillips is a civil engineer well known fordocumenting physical traces associated with unidentified aerial objects. Back in1968, when Ted Phillips worked for the Missouri Department of Transportation,he became involved in an investigation in which daylight photographs taken by ahunter showed a silver disc moving away from a burning pine tree and a tent fullof melted aluminum pots, radios, cameras and other camping equipment. Theimplication was that the disc had somehow caused the destructive heat.Ted called Northwestern University's Astronomy Department for help and theman who answered the phone was Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Director of theAstronomy Department at the time. Dr. Hynek was also a consultant to the U. S.Air Force Project Blue Book which investigated UFO reports. Dr. Hynek urgedTed Phillips to keep researching and since 1968, Ted has compiled a data baseof some 4,000 physical trace cases associated with unidentified aerial objectsand personally has investigated about 600 cases, including this recent series ofclose encounters with glowing spheres in Missouri.Photographs and video frames taken at various times and by different people areon his web site at: Center for Physical Trace Research. On March 3rd, 1999, Tedsaw the spheres with his own eyes and was stunned.We b s it e s :Center for Physical Trace ResearchThe National ConservancyCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
