Seventeen gray whales diedin the past five weeks in Puget Sound, Washington. Nearly all the dead whaleshave been adult females who look like they have starved to death.At first, all the west coast newspaper stories about this unusually high numberof deaths seemed to signal that something was wrong with the ocean waters. ButDr. Bruce Mate, Professor of Wildlife at Oregon State University's HatfieldMarine Science Center in Newport, Oregon, says the current count of graywhales is back up to 26,600 - the largest number since the days of unrestrictedwhaling nearly wiped them all out. Until five years ago, gray whales were on theendangered species list. Then in 1994, the huge creatures were removed fromthe endangered category because their population had grown so much.But why would all these adult females die in the 1999 spring? More thanpollution problems in the Pacific, Dr. Mate speculates that warming watertemperatures in the Bering Sea might be the problem.Interview:Bruce Mate, Ph.D., Professor of Wildlife, Oregon State University'sHatfield Marine Science Center, Newport, Oregon: \"I'm aware of some of thepress releases that have speculated about contaminants from the present saltevaporation facility at G. Negro (whale birthing lagoons) and also the possibilitythat dye markers used by drug traffickers were responsible for these deaths. Idon't think there is any merit to those arguments at all. And the reason is that ifit were a point source, you would expect a large number of mortalities in a shortperiod of time around that point source. And these mortalities are spread outover a four month period and over a wide geographic area.IN THE NECROPSIES IN THIS CURRENT RASH OF DEAD WHALESHAVE YOU FOUND ANYTHING AT ALL THAT WAS UNUSUAL?I guess the most striking thing is that quite a number of the animals areemaciated. So that's another thing that argues that they didn't, for instance, comein contact with a marker dye that has cyanide because they would die instantlyand that would include fat and happy animals. A lot of these animals are quitewasted. They are emaciated.WAS THERE ANY SIGN OF PARASITE DISEASE OR OTHER?Well, frequently when you get malnourished, you're more vulnerable to all kindsof things - including diseases. I mean you don't die typically of malnourishment.You die of things that happen as a result of being malnourished. And I have tosay that most of the animals - way more than most - are in such bad shape by the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"time somebody gets to look at them, they aren't diagnosable. The animal mightdie at sea a week before it comes to shore. So, all the secondary things thathappen, it's pretty hard to tell if there was a bacteria, for instance, or somethinglike that.AND YOU ARE SPECULATING THAT THEY WOULD BE IN A LOWNUTRITION BECAUSE THE POPULATION OF THE GRAY WHALESIS NOW OUT-STRIPPING THE CRUSTACEANS THEY LIVE OFF?I would say yes, but for two reasons. One, the population of gray whales hasgrown up to a number that is so large. And the second is that we have evidenceof decline in productivity in the Bering Sea, which is the principal place wherethey eat.MEANING THE CRUSTACEANS THEMSELVES ARE NOT AS MANYOF THOSE AS THERE USED TO BE?Either the numbers are low or the quality of them is low. You can appreciatethat you can have - you can eat something when it's lean or when it's fat and it'sgoing to be quite a difference in its value to you.THIS LEADS TO THE QUESTION: WHAT COULD BE HAPPENINGTO THE CRUSTACEAN FOOD SUPPLY OF THE GRAY WHALES?Well, the crustaceans have not been measured in the Bering Sea, but otheranimals have been measured for decline and productivity, it's been easier tomeasure and there has been reason to look at other levels - like salmon. Evenother mammals have declined up there - the Stellar sea lion, harbor seals, seaotters. But about 40% of the U. S. fisheries come out of the Bering Sea andthere have been dramatic declines in most of those fisheries.THE WHALES AND THE OTHER MARINE LIFE IN THE BERINGSEA ARE JUST NOT DOING AS WELL AS THEY DID BEFORE?We're still groping with that problem. And you're wanting to know what theanswer is. Why? And we want to know the same thing and we're not there yet.I'm trying to describe to you speculation, things that people are thinking aboutas explanations. I don't have a satisfactory crisp explanation for you.BUT THE TEMPERATURE IN THE WATER OF THE BERING SEAHAS BEEN GETTING INCREASINGLY INCREMENTALLY WARMER?There has been that trend, yes. Recently. Not over a long, long period of time,not a fifty year trend or anything like that. But over a decade.THAT WARMER WATER IS HAVING AN IMPACT ON THECREATURES THAT CAN NOW THRIVE IN THAT WATER?That's correct.IT'S AFFECTING THE CRUSTACEANS THAT THE WHALES HAVEFED UPON.We presume it has. The levels we've measured of other animals have gone downand because these animals eat the detritus, the things that go to the bottom, theyshould be affected. But we don't have any direct measure of that at the presenttime. Cycles like this occur. El Nino is such a cycle where we know that hasoccurred for thousands of years and periodically the system gets punched hardbecause of warm water intrusions and cold water doesn't bring nutrients to thesurface and the whole system crashes. And there you get a decline of 80 or 90percent sometimes and productivity. And it lasts for a year or two. And then itcomes back. And what I'm saying to you is that scientists believe there are othercycles besides El Nino that cause dramatic changes in productivity that havelonger cycle periods - might be on the order of a decade of going down and a"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"decade coming back up. And because they are longer cycles, people are juststarting to become aware of them and study them as a phenomenon because theyhaven't looked at them long enough to have understood that that's what wasgoing on.AND MAY NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THOSE ANIMALS AREGOING TO A FUTURE OF EXTINCTION.Absolutely not. Definitely. You are correct. It may not mean that at all. In fact,as a natural cycle, it's probably - if these are natural cycles, they have probablygone on for millions of years and there have been times when populations havedropped precipitately and then come back and then dropped down again and ispart of the natural order of things.YOU WOULD NOT SAY THAT WE NEED TO GIVE UP OURCONCERN ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE GRAY WHALESOR OTHERS?No. I'm very glad that people are concerned about them. I'm glad they are doingwell right now. My personal research focuses on the endangered species ofwhales that aren't doing that well. I would love to think that every whale speciesin the world would do half as well as gray whales. I study species where we'relooking at one to three percent of the original stock is all that's left! And wedon't even know where they go to feed and calve. Part of my work will be in theNational Geographic in the July issue on humpbacks. Humpbacks are doingreasonably well. I've worked on blue whales where we are down to threepercent of what they used to be. Ninety-seven percent of those whales are gone!And we don't even know where they go to reproduce, so we can't protect thoseareas. And we can't count them well because we don't know where they arethrough most of the year.BUT JUST THE FACT THAT YOU CAN'T FIND THEM VERY EASILYANYMORE WOULD SEEM THAT THEIR NUMBERS HAVEDECLINED, RIGHT?We know their numbers are dramatically depressed from whaling. But the trendssince whaling quit are undefined.\"More Information:Dr. Mate suggests that if anyone finds a sick or dying marine animal on a beachto call the State Police wherever you are. The police will know the marineanimal experts to contact for any given geographic area.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
