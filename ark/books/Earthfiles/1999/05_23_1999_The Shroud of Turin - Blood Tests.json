It has straw-colored front and backimages of a crucified man with blood colored wounds and dozens of scourgemarks similar to whips used two thousand years ago. It's as if the linen shroudhad been wrapped around the man's body from the feet up over the head andback down to the feet after the blood had clotted. The body images are alsobracketed the entire length of the cloth by parallel burn and scorch marks fromfire damage suffered in 1532.The Shroud images were photographed in 1931 and 1978. In the authoritativeand well-illustrated book, The Blood and The Shroud by Ian Wilson, positiveand negative photographs of the head and body clearly show rivulets of bloodon the head and lash marks and larger blood stains on the body.Close-Up of the Head Image on Shroud of TurinLeft, positive photograph of original linen shroud; right, negative photograph of same.Close-Up of the Blood Stains At the Back of the Head on the Shroud and Clothof Ovieda"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Left, blood stain pattern on the linen Shroud of Turin where the back of the headwould have been. Right, blood stain pattern on the Cloth of Oviedo, allegedly the smallclothplaced over Jesus Christ's face after death. The Cloth of Oviedo has been kept in achurch drawer in Oviedo, Spain for centuries.In 1978, a team of thirty U. S. scientists, many from the Jet Propulsion Lab inCalifornia, came together for the Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP).The Archbishop at the Cathedral of Turin in Torino, Italy where the Shroud washoused from 1694 to 1993 gave permission for STURP to study the Shroud.Photographic and spectroscopic examinations were made and over thirtysticky-tape samples representative of the body images, blood stains andnon-image areas were taken. The STURP team concluded that the Shroud is nota painting.Later in 1980, STURP asked Alan D. Adler, Professor Emeritus of Chemistry atWestern Connecticut State University in Danbury, Connecticut to do analyseson a small fragment from the sticky-tape samples lifted from the Shroud bloodstains. Between 1980 and 1999, Dr. Adler has tested for porphyrin fluorescence,done a series of wet chemistry tests, immunological tests and two different kindsof spectroscopy. He concludes that what he has studied is \"primate blood, andthat's being very cautious. Anybody, if it were for any other than the Shroud ofTurin, would simply say you tested for human and you found it. But I can'tprove - no scientists can - that it's the blood of Jesus Christ crucified inJerusalem two thousand years ago.\"On May 23, 1999, Dr. Adler was one of the guests on a special three hourDreamland program I hosted about analyses of the Shroud of Turin, includingblood stain fragments and comments about the Cloth of Oviedo pictured in thisreport and the positive and negative images of the head on the Shroud of Turin.The following are excerpts from an interview with Dr. Adler:Interview:Shroud Blood Tests\"What do you mean when you say you did an immunological test?It means that you take something that is antigenic and you put it into an animalthat is not human -- a rabbit, an egg, something - and you make an antibody toit. You then take the protein or the mixture that you want to test and see if youget what is called an antibody antigen reaction. There's all sorts of ways to findout if this is positive. Sometimes it's tagged with material. Sometimes you lookfor a precipitate. Sometimes you look for what is called an agglutination test. Iwon't go into all those kinds of details, but what you are looking for is you'vegot some kind of material and you want to see if you can get a reaction to theso-called antibody which has been developed in another system.All right, now you have two kinds of problems here. One, there are kinds ofthings because they're genetically similar will also give a response. So, if I say Ihave a positive test for human antibody, you get the same thing from chimp,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"from gorilla, from orangutan. And unless you run a very specific test, you haveno way to tell the difference. You certainly don't in the kinds of materials we aretesting on the Shroud. The other kind of thing you have is -- what are the kindsof things that serve as antigens? There are two types of material that serve asantigens: one are proteins. These are what we call polypeptides.The other thing is that there are a lot of proteins that we call glycol proteins.These are proteins that at one end of the protein have a long stretch of what wethink of as poly sugar, saccharide The most common test we think of to testsomebody's blood type are for proteins where what's being identified is not anyof the protein structure, but the sugar structure. The problem is those kinds ofpolysaccharides are frequently found as contaminants in bacterial cell walls.And so, if you have a material that you're not sure is free of bacterialcontaminants, you may get a positive test that has nothing to do with thepresence of the protein you're looking for. Unfortunately the blood typeproteins, the common ones, and the globin that Dr. Baima Bollone tested fall inthat class. So, a lot of people said he was looking at bacterial cell wall debris.This was for the AB Negative blood test?This was for the AB Negative test. (Torino, Italy in 1981, reported AB Negativeblood type on Shroud blood stain.) And that's when I decided if I was going torepeat an immunological test, I would test for one that did NOT have a glycogroup attached. That's serum albumin, that's very specific. And I would test forwhole blood. This is everything that's in there, in the serum. This is hemoglobin,albumin, everything. And that would sort of confirm that my albumin test, thecontrol on it. So, I ran those two tests and both of those were positive.Well, those two tests coupled with his (Dr. Bollone's) two tests make it veryclear we have a right to say that we have taken blood samples from the Shroudof Turin, two different investigators, and shown clear cut evidence that there iscertainly some type of primate blood in those samples. And that's being verycautious. Anybody who did work on anything other than the Shroud of Turinwould simply say that you tested for human and you found it. I also ran chimpcontrols. And in fact, the chimp control was just a little bit weaker in thissurface precipitant fluorescence test I ran than the human sample. And so, I'mnot in a rush to say -- it was human. But if you press me, I tell people, \"Well,look at the image it was taken from. If you think this is a shaved orangutan, goahead!\" Most people would not hesitate to say what we got is positive humantest.Cloth of Oviedo:We have another relic that is claimed to be associated with Christ's crucifixioncalled the Cloth of Oviedo which is kept in northern Spain.THAT IS ALSO REFERRED TO AS THE SUDARIUM.As the sudarium, right. And it supposedly was put over Christ's face when hewas taken down from the cross like a modesty cloth.WHEN HE WAS TAKEN FROM THE CROSS, SOMEONE PUT ACLOTH ON HIS FACE?Yes, we have no idea how far back this custom goes, when it originated withwho. But lots of cultures have practiced this. We do. When somebodypronounces somebody dead, what do the attendants do? They pull the blanketover the guy's head. When someone sees there is a death, someone putssomething over his face. It's known this kind of thing goes back through all kindsof cultures through all kinds of times. So, it's not surprising that it might havebeen something practiced at the time of the crucifixion. All right, so this wasalleged to have done that and we have to surmise this was taken off before he(crucified man) was put in the Shroud because there is no image on this cloth.It's just blood marks."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Now, it turns out that the Spaniards who have done a lot of work on this clothand have shown the marks on that cloth (Oviedo) are real blood-derivedmaterial, just like I've shown and Bollone and some other people have shownthe blood marks on the Shroud are blood-derived material. And in fact, theseare not cloths on free-flowing wounds. What they are are impressions of clottedblood. This was very unusual. Artists don't usually show painted images ofclotted blood. And forensically and chemically and all sorts of ways we candemonstrate this in fact is exudate from a blood clot. The Spaniards have donethe same thing on the Cloth of Oviedo.The problem is the Cloth of Oviedo can be viewed as divided into three panels.They put the middle panel over the face. They folded the other third over it, soyou have sort of mirrored image set of blots. You've got blood through themiddle panel and into the other side panel. And then the other panel was putbehind the back of the head. Now, there are wounds on the back of the head invery complex patterns. Not just spots. There are W's, L's and Y's. Thephotographs show that in my article. (\"Updating Recent Studies on the Shroudof Turin\" © 1996 by Alan D. Adler, Ph.D., American Chemical Society.)Dr. Al Wanger (M.D., Psychiatry, Duke University) showed that those twopatterns in the polarizing overlay technique of his are identical on the Shroudand on the Cloth of Oviedo. And if you look carefully, you can see that theOviedo Cloth is less dark on the edges. That's just what you would expectbecause if the Oviedo Cloth is the one that went on the wounds first, it wouldhave blotted up some of the blood on the edges. So, in fact we cannot onlyshow these two patterns are congruent, but we can show which one went onwhich piece of cloth first.On top of that because they are clot wounds, they show what are known asserum contraction effects. When a wound clots, the fibrin pulls throughmaterials in the blood, the solid materials, into the wound to make the scab.And it leaves a rim of serum around the wounds. And those serum rings show upvery easily in ultraviolet emission. And in the ultraviolet photography that wasdone on the Shroud, we can see these serum contraction rings around everysingle blood wound on the Shroud of Turin. So, this also tells you someone didnot paint it.\"More Information:Scientists and doctors from around the world will gather in Richmond, Virginiaon June 18th, 1999 for a Shroud of Turin International Research Conference.The press release states: \"The cause of the Shroud's image is still unknown. It'smost definitely not a painting. It's an enigma, a very important one, since if theimage on it is really the likeness of Jesus of Nazareth, then the Shroud of Turincontains the only authentic description of him that exists.\"Conference topics will range from chemistry and blood analyses to thehypothesis that the Shroud images were created by radiation such as x-rayfrequencies emanating from wi thi n the bones and teeth outward through the skininto the linen cloth.We b s it e s :http://www.shroud.comCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
