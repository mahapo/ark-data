Instead of the year 2000, the number 1900 hasbeen showing up on various documents around the country. And on December15th in Vancouver, British Columbia, a new computerized smoke alarm installedin the city's SkyTrain went off and stopped the whole system. Thousands ofcommuters and holiday shoppers were stranded. Ironically, the newcomputerized alarm was supposed to prevent Y2K shutdown problems.Photograph of Three Mile Island nuclear power plant located in Middletown,Pennsylvania, a few miles south of Harrisburg, the state capital. On March 28, 1979,the worst commercial nuclear disaster in U. S. history occurred when a pump failed in thereactor cooling system. Nearly a million gallons of radioactive water escaped through anopenvalve onto the reactor building basement floor. Radioactivity was also released into the air.Photograph courtesy U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.Another Y2K glitch that concerns many citizen \"watchdogs\" who live nearnuclear power reactors is electrical failure. There are 103 nuclear power plantsin the United States. If power grids go down, even temporarily, will emergencydiesel generators keep nuclear power plants operating safely?At the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, aman who was born and raised there named Scott Portzline has been workingwith other residents to monitor the plant's operations.Scott Portzline, Former Security Chairman,Three Mile Island Alert, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Sportzline@home.comFor eight years, Scott helped the volunteer civilian Three Mile Island Alertgroup monitor radiation and security. He has testified before the U. S. Senate,the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Advisory Committee on ReactorSafeguards and before other governmental bodies in an effort to close securitygaps that he has found. His research has been cited by the U. S. Department ofEnergy and various military branches. Portzline also maintains a data base oflost and stolen radioactive materials in the United States. I asked Scott what theconsequences might be if a large aircraft or a suicide truck bomber slammed intoThree Mile Island.Interview:Scott Portzline, Former Security Chairman, Three Mile Island Alert,Harrisburg, Pa: \"At the beginning of the year I realized that one of the biggestproblems that could happen during Y2K rollover was the loss of the grid andthe dependence upon emergency diesel generators. So, I decided to do someresearch and put together a data base from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission'sown documents. And I expected to find a problem with the emergency dieselgenerators system once per month. Instead, I found four times that amount and itsurprised me. And so far, just this year more than half of the plants in the U. S.have experienced a problem with a diesel generator. 53% have had a defect orsuspected defect.Let's clarify that the diesel generator is the back up to provide electricity ifthe main electrical power fails.That's right. Now they do have some batteries at the plants that can operatesome of the systems in the control room, but it can't do the pumping of thereactor coolant. There are some back up systems that are steam driven, but youdefinitely want to have electricity at your plant so you can evaluate and analyzeall the data that is coming in. Confusion played a major role in the Three MileIsland event.\"Mr. Portzline suggests that people living near nuclear power plants in theUnited States at least put valuable keepsakes in a box that can be easilymoved if there is a serious problem and evacuation is necessary, as it wasin Three Mile Island. He also suggests that residents have their own Geigercounter with training about how to use it in order to keep an independentcheck on radioactive levels around nuclear power plants. Nearby residentsshould also keep a supply of potassium iodide or potassium iodate to ingestduring a nuclear emergency in order to protect the thyroid gland. 2) Global Warming UpdateNASA launched a new satellite Saturday, December 18th called Terra. The goalis to better observe interactions between earth's land masses, oceans andatmosphere. One of the challenges is to get the latest data into advancedcomputer models that are trying to project global warming trends over the nextcentury. Last month, The New York Times headlined, \"Thinning Sea Ice StokesDebate on Climate.\" Scientists at the University of Washington in Seattlereported in the journal Geophysical Research Letters that ice at the North Poleis about 40% thinner now than it was twenty years ago. Is such rapid melting anatural phenomenon? Or the result of manmade greenhouse gasses that havewarmed up the lower atmosphere? Or both?Dr. Drew Shindell, an atmospheric physicist at the NASA Goddard's Institute forSpace Studies in New York City, has computer modeling studies that indicatethe present situation is \"not a natural thing.\" His models show that temperature"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"contrasts between the tropics and polar regions are greater, strengtheningwesterly winds which bring warmer air to the Arctic and melts the ice. Dr.Shindell and his colleagues are also concerned about changes in the NorthAtlantic Drift that keeps Europe warmer than Canada and Siberia. Britishscientists say the current is changing and are worried that Europe could face amuch colder future. I recently asked Dr. Shindell about the new data and theearly December \"storm of the century\" that blew from the British Isles intoEastern Europe.Drew Shindell, Ph.D., Atmospheric Physicist, NASA's Goddard Institutefor Space Studies, New York City: \"Global warming in general has thepotential although it's still another uncertainty, but it has the potential to createstronger storms. There kind of more energy in general in the lower atmosphere,so that can easily go into storms and theoretically it makes perfect sense that youcould get stronger storms in the greenhouse world. And you also see this trendtoward changing atmospheric circulation which is related to what you were justmentioning the stratosphere cooling and the lower atmosphere warming whichyou would expect to change the westerly flow in the Northern Hemisphere andincrease that which will affect storm tracks.Storms generally move across the Atlantic and into Europe and you expectthose to shift a little bit over time. So, you do expect all these kinds of changes.But something really drastic like the shut off of the North Atlantic deep waterthat would really plunge Europe into a much colder climate it's such anon-linear process that it's really hard to tell if we are approaching that. I mean,it will be impossible to tell pretty much until it happens.Even if we were creeping up to that, it's something that is going to happenin days? A month? When would we know?Well, I'm not sure anybody really knows the answer to that either. I would thinkit would be a matter of years it could happen, as opposed to decades orcenturies. In climate scales, that's very fast.If this winter in Europe, it was especially cold and the spring did not comeuntil very late, then the winter came early again and such extremesoccurred every year afterward, that might indicate the beginning of acolder age taking hold?Yes. If it happened several years in a row, I think people would begin to wonder.But we do have ways to measure the deep water formation and what is going onat present has actually been a little bit confusing because there are two mainregions of deep water formation in the North Atlantic. One is over in to the eastof Greenland and one is in the Labrador Sea to the west. And we've seen adecrease in deep water formation which is kind of the north end of the conveyorbelt, bringing heat up and then going down and coming back at low levels in theocean. We've seen a decrease of that going on in the Greenland Sea, but anincrease in the Labrador Sea. So, it's not that clear that there's been any netchange overall and so far it looks like more of a shift. If you just look in a regionlike Scotland or something or closer to the Greenland Sea, then you might notbe getting the whole picture of what's going on with the whole system. But moreof a regional aspect.If it is only a regional shift in Europe, is that something you've seen beforein data and that's why you and other scientists are not very concerned?No, we are still quite concerned. We haven't seen a shift like this before. Wedon't have very long records of either of these regions. We just don't have verylong records of deep water formation in general. But there is no way to tell ifthis shift is just kind of a prelude first that decreases in the Greenland Sea andmoves over to the Labrador Sea and then moves out of the Atlantic completelyand is gone. Or, this could lead to something terrible. But thus far, it's a shiftthat we really don't understand that well."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Does it suggest to you as a scientist who has had great concerns about theimpact of global warming on climate patterns that we might be seeing animportant change in the North Atlantic Drift if these measurementscontinue to hold up?Oh, yes. I think that's certainly true. Given it's qualified by saying we MIGHT beseeing an important shift. There is no guarantee. But these are pretty majorshifts. And the same thing with the Arctic Sea ice. And the new measurementshave shown the depth, the thickness of the sea ice layer has decreased by about40% since the 1960's. That's huge in another 30 or 40 years, it will just be gone.There will be no ice whatsoever.No North Pole.Yeah, the North Pole would just be an ocean. Instead of how it's always been abig ice pack. And now it would just be gone. So, these are really enormouschanges. It's not like a 2% change and maybe in another several decades it willbe up to 4% and we should worry. This is huge!If this does persist and the melting continues, would all that ice meltneutralize the salinity in the ocean water? Do computer models projectwhat impact so much ice melt in the oceans and seas will have on climate inanother 30 or 40 years?The computer models are starting to do that. And this is really kind of somethingnobody was doing at all even just a few years ago. So, there is a recent modelthat was able to simulate, to reproduce the observations over the past fewdecades of this big decrease of ice in the Arctic, in both the extent and thicknessof the sea ice. And our model was able to reproduce the change in theatmospheric circulation pattern. But in general climate models don't include anyof these things.What do the current computer models project?The current models are just really beginning to work on individual pieces of this.Our model has said we can reproduce the atmospheric circulation patterns andwe project those will continue. But it was only working on a piece of the wholeproblem and didn't include say the changes in the ice and ocean circulation.And other people have worked individually on the ice and the ocean, butnobody has really put it all together yet. So, I don't think there really is anycomputer model simulation that predicts, that has simulated what is likely tooccur over the next few decades that really includes all these processes. ... Andas we push the system farther and farther, if there really is this non-linearity likethis on-off switch in the Atlantic current built in, and we keep pushing fartherand farther, if it's there, eventually we're going to hit it. Then, we could get oneof these really drastic changes we're talking about where Europe suddenlyplunges into a Siberia or Canada temperature.Could large global superstorms erupt in a short period of time out of sucha climate shift?I don't know if large \"super storms\" are feasible. We would get stronger storms,but I don't know if we would get any global type storms. We've never seenanything like that as long as we've been around looking at the planet. And like Iwas mentioning, there have been some studies that say in the last glacialmaximum, the North Atlantic Drift current was really much reduced. So, there isevidence that this has happened in the earth's history, but it hasn't reallyhappened in human history. So we really don't know what it would be like.\"We b s it e :http://www.giss.nasa.gov/"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
