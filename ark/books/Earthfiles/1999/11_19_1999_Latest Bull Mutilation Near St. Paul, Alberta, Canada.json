The most recent was a 1700 pound herd bull found in Spedden, afew miles west of St. Paul, on October 29th.Interview:Fern Belzil, Cattle Rancher and Mutilation Investigator, St. Paul, Alberta,Canada: \"I went out there the next morning. I was there by 8 AM and tooksome soil tests. Didn't take any grass tests because there was no grass around.YOU ARE A PERSON WHO HAS SEEN SEVERAL MUTILATIONS,FERN. CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT WAS THE FIRST THING THATIMPRESSED YOU?The first thing that impressed me was the nice cut on the belly area.Plate 1 - Precise oval cut on left side of belly extending down over genital area where penisandtesticles were removed and on to excision of rectal tissue seen in second photo below. Thejagged sectionin this photograph and in the rectal tissue was attributed to coyotes that attacked the deadanimal. But the farmowner said all the excisions were originally precise and bloodless when he found his bull onOctober 29, 1999.Photograph taken October 30th © 1999 by Fern Belzil, St. Paul, Alberta, Canada.WHICH HAD REMOVED THE GENITALS OF THE BULL?Right. The coyotes had already been on it which was sort of unusual andchewed on the back end of the animal. Some had been torn by a predator."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Plate 2 - Herd bull found by ranch owner dead and mutilated on October 29, 1999. Coyoteshad chewedon parts of neat, bloodless excisions by the time investigator Fern Belzil reached the sitethe nextday on October 30th. Photograph © 1999 by Fern Belzil, St. Paul, Alberta, Canada.WHEN THE FARMER HAD FOUND THE ANIMAL ON THE 29TH,HOW DID HE DESCRIBE WHAT HE WAS LOOKING AT?The precise cuts and no blood around. He had never seen anything like thisbefore.IN ADDITION TO THE GENITALS REMOVED IN A SMOOTH,BLOODLESS CUT, WERE THERE ANY OTHER EXCISIONS ON THEBULL?No, there wasn't. It kind of surprised me. The tongue was intact, and so were theeyes and ears which is rather unusual. For some reason, the mutilators usuallygo at the head and do something there.HAD THIS BULL'S OWNER HAD ANY OTHER MUTILATIONS?No, this was the first time.IS THIS THE MOST RECENT CASE IN CANADA?Well, for me, for sure. The other two were on July 6th and June 6th.AND THEY WERE IN WHAT AREA?One on June 6, 1999 was in Speers, Saskatchewan east of North Battleford onthe Wendy and Trent Foster ranch. They phoned me and I went out there rightaway the next day. I'm about 225 miles from there. This was a 6 year old cow.She had died close to three days before I got there, so again, I couldn't do thenecropsy. But I made a lot of soil and grass samplings for Dr. W. C. Levengood,the biophysicist in Michigan.Plate 3 - The udder was removed from this six year old cow found by farmer Trent Fosterat his Speers,Saskatchewan farm on June 6, 1999 east of North Battleford. \"The excisions were veryneatlydone and looked very professional. The tendons from the back legs were taken out. Noblood.\"Photograph © 1999 by Fern Belzil, St. Paul, Alberta, Canada.The rectum was cut out. The udder was cut out, again with precision excisions,really nice. They had also removed the tendons from the hind legs which was Ihad never seen before. Also, the left front shoulder was cut out, or the hide was"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"gone so one of the shoulder blades was exposed.Plate 4 - Front left shoulder with the same type of excision used in removal of sexualorgans shown in Plate 3. \"Very neat. No blood. Flesh removed from the shoulder blade.No sign of predator teeth marks.\" Photograph © 1999 by Fern Belzil, St. Paul, Alberta,Canada.One eye was cut. The eye was gone, but 1/2 inch of the skin around the eye wasgone and the eyelid was cut out as well. The tongue was gone and one ear wasgone. Trent told me there were a lot of coyotes around, but no coyotes hadtouched it. So, finally they buried the animal. Him and his wife were very upsetand scared.Plate 5 - \"Tongue removed. Left eye and eye lid carved out, as well as left ear. No blood.\"Photograph © 1999 by Fern Belzil, St. Paul, Alberta, Canada.Another one a month later on July 6th happened only a few miles east of St.Paul and about ten miles from me on the Ken Cooknel farm. This was aHereford Simmental cross herd bull. When the farmer got into the field to checkthe cattle that morning, the cattle were very excited. And this was a very quietherd, very docile. And that morning, they were very frustrated. He thought itwas unusual, so they figured something was going on. They finally found thebull in the bush among willows and poplar trees. The rancher and his sonestimated that the bull had died about 24 hours before they found him. Andthen they called me and I went over the same afternoon and took some soil andgrass samples.As you will see by the photograph below (head slightly out of focus), half of thenose (front portion) was cut out, one eyelid was removed, another 1-inch deepcut was made about an inch long just below the left eye."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Plate 6 - Hereford Simmental cross herd bull found dead and mutilated by owner KenCooknel on July 6, 1999.\"Half of the nose (front portion) was cut out, one eyelid was removed, another 1-inch deepcut was made aboutan inch long just below the left eye.\" Photograph © 1999 by Fern Belzil, St. Paul, Alberta,Canada.The penis and scrotum were removed. The oval cut on the stomach was 16 x 12inches and it looked like a surgical cut. The flesh where it had been skinnedshowed no signs of teeth marks or any other abnormality. Looking very closelyat the excisions, some of the hair was cut. At the scrotum area, the excision wasabout the same size as the one on the belly area that also exhibited neatexcisions. Furthermore, adjacent to the belly excision, I also noticed a hairlessspot approximately two inches in diameter. I have found these hairless spots onabout a dozen mutilations so far.\"Plate 7 - The penis and scrotum were removed. The oval cut on the stomach was 16 x 12inches and itlooked like a surgical cut. Scrotum excision was about same size as belly cut. Photograph ©1999by Fern Belzil, St. Paul, Alberta Canada.When I was doing my tests, the cattle all came around again. And there wasanother herd bull in this herd. He was very excited. He was butting away at thedead bull's front legs. And some of the cattle were bawling. And finally wescared them away and I continued my tests.The farmer told me that every couple of days he went back to check the cattleand whenever they went out there, that other bull that was still very agitated.The bull would chase their truck when they came into the field.The penis and scrotum were removed in beautiful excisions. The rectum was cutout. On the excisions of the penis area, we could also see where the hair hadbeen cut.AS IF IT WERE REALLY UPSET AND ANGRY ABOUT SOMETHINGTHAT HAD HAPPENED.Just as if he was holding a grudge or something. You wonder my theory is thatmaybe they tried to mutilate him and hurt him and he got away. Just a theory,but why would a bull be so upset?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"WELL, ONE OF HIS COMPATRIOTS SORT OF SPEAK, THE OTHERBULL, DIED.Yeah, well they finally took the bull home here about three weeks ago and theboy was telling me that he was in the corral and he got into the corral to feedthe bull and this bull chased him and he had to jump in the manger. And hesaid, \"Thank god, it wasn't my Dad because he said he would have crippledhim.\" So, anyway to make a long story short, they decided to sell the bull.AND IT ALL STARTED WITH A MUTILATION IN JULY OF THISYEAR?Right.WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE OTHER BULL SO TRAUMATIZEDTHIS BULL THAT HE'S BEEN AFFECTED PSYCHOLOGICALLY TOTHIS DAY.Yeah. And the mother was telling me that when they first found the bull, her sonwalked around and felt very, very queer for some reason. He was very disturbedabout it. The whole family is very disturbed. They said it took the fun out ofraising cattle. And that's not the first time I find that people get scared.WELL, IT'S A PHENOMENON THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOROVER 40 YEARS, NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN ARRESTED ORARRAIGNED ON AN ANIMAL MUTILATION CHARGE, AND YETTHESE UNUSUAL DEATHS CONTINUE AND RANCHERS AND LAWENFORCEMENT WHO ARE WILLING TO SPEAK HONESTLYKNOW THAT THEY ARE DEALING IN THESE HIGH STRANGENESSCASES WITH EXCISIONS AND BLOODLESSNESS AND NO TRACKSTHAT ARE NOT FOUND IN NORMAL PREDATOR KILLS. AND IFYOU CAN'T EXPLAIN SOMETHING, AND YOU CAN'T GET ITSTOPPED, THAT'S REASON TO UPSET PEOPLE.That's right. \"More Information:If mutilations are reported within 24 hours, necropsies and pathology analysescan be done as well as soil and plant analyses.
