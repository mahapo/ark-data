In fact, of all the stars that can be seen withthe naked eye from earth - none are as mysterious and confusing as Eta Carinae.If you live in southern Texas, southern Florida or Hawaii, you can barely see thestar peeking up a little above the horizon straight south in June. It has a reddish-orange color and was completely invisible to the naked eye only a few yearsago.Photo Credit: Jon Morse, Ph.D., Center for Astrophysics and SpaceAstronomy and NASA, University of Colorado, Boulder.How much more Eta Carainae will brighten - and will it actually explode into ahypernova - are unknowns. But one astronomer who devotes his research tomassive stars like the unpredictable Eta Carainae is Dr. Kris Davidson, Professorof Astronomy at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.I talked to him today about his interest in studying Eta Carainae even before therecent and sudden brightening. Interview:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Kris Davidson, Ph.D., Professor of Astronomy, Univ of Minnesota,Minneapolis, Minnesota:\"Eta Carainae is a very strange and extreme object. We can see about 6,000 starswith the naked eye, more or less. And generally speaking, we understand all ofthem. We understand enough about how stars work that any astronomers talkingabout any mysteries of naked eye stars are talking about specialist details. EtaCarainae is the exception. It's the naked eye star that we just don't understand.First, it's extremely bright. To see it from a distance of 7500 light years - that'squite a thing right there. Most of the stars we see are much closer. But 150 yearsago, it blew up. It became one of the brightest stars in the sky for about 20 years.It looked almost like a supernova explosion, but the star survived. It seems toinvolve some type of instability we just haven't figured out yet in an extremelymassive star.Second, in addition to being unstable, Eta Carainae from its brightness and itspower appears to be the most powerful - and therefore, the most massive star -in our neck of the woods, in our part of the galaxy. It radiates something like 4million times as much light as the sun. And that's extreme. There just aren't anyother stars that definitely do more than that. And it weighs about 100 times asmuch as the sun does. And that also is extreme. There are no other stars that weare certain are more massive than that.So, it's a combination of instability, extreme amount of power, extremely highmass - it puts it on the very limit of everything we know about stars.WHAT HAPPENED MOST RECENTLY THAT SHOCKED YOU ANDOTHER ASTRONOMERS?Recently, it seems to be brightening. Now, the problem with that is not just thatwe didn't expect it to brighten. It's that we thought we had good reasons why itwouldn't. The story is really that it was unstable - it was flickering a lot beforethat terrific explosion 150 years ago. It's a lot like a geyser. When you see ageyser beginning to go off, or a volcano. You can see hints that it's going tohappen - burbling, you know. Puffing away. It looks unstable.Well, then it blew up 150 years ago. It did a few other things before 1900. Andsince that time it's been relatively quiet. And on the geyser and volcano analogy,that's just to be expected. When a thing blows up, it gets steady for awhile afterthat when it stabilizes.We thought Eta Carainae had stabilized. It's becoming slowly brighter over manydecades, many years, but that's only because the dust is clearing away from itsprevious explosion. However, in the past two years - space telescope data thatwe've obtained has shown that at some wavelengths, the central star in it hasdoubled in brightness within about a year. This is just completely unprecedentedand shocks us for a couple of reasons. One, it was unexpected, as I just said, andtwo, the way it's brightening doesn't make sense. It's brightening at allwavelengths and a non-technical interpretation of that is that it seems to beactually increasing the amount of power it's producing. Usually when one ofthese stars gets brighter, it's just because it's gotten to a different temperaturewhere we can see it better without changing the actual amount of power comingout. And Eta seems to be actually increasing the amount of power it'' radiating.Well, that just doesn't make sense with any theories we have. We didn't expectthis to happen. The other stars that are vaguely like Eta Carainae, but not asextreme never do this. And yet it does seem to be doing this. We are justcompletely puzzled by it.DO YOU HAVE ANY HYPOTHESIS ABOUT WHAT COULD BEGENERATING SUCH AN INTENSE INCREASE IN POWER?I have sort of a technical hypothesis, and that is - after the big explosion 150years ago, it left the star in a state where the energy trapped inside it wasdistributed all wrong, in a funny way. There were bubbles of extreme amountsof energy trapped inside this star. Stars are so big that it takes hundreds or even"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"thousands or even millions of years for the energy to leak out. And my suspicion- and it's just a quarter baked idea - is that maybe a sort of bubble, a region ofextra energy that got trapped after the big explosion - has now reached thesurface and it's just puffing out.BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A BIG STAR.That's right. There is an alternative idea and that is the dust around it is clearingvery rapidly so we can see it better suddenly. But that's not an easy idea,because the dust doesn't just clear by itself that fast. Something would have todestroy the dust and if something destroys it - well, the only thing we know thatcould do that is the star and we're right back to the idea that the star hasincreased in power so it can destroy the dust.SO, IN A WAY IT IS AS IF ETA CARAINAE HAS SINCE 150 YEARSAGO APPEARED TO NOVA, IN A WAY, AND THEN WE'RE IN 1999 -AND IT APPEARS TO BE IN A SLOW NOVA BURST OF LIGHTAGAIN.Could be. That's one of the interpretations. We'll know in a few months. But inthe meantime, it's behaving sort of like that's what's happening. I don't think thismeans it's going to become a supernova. In fact, there are some theories aboutvery massive stars like Eta Carainae in which they don't even become supernova- they become something much more dangerous called a hypernova. But hoseare largely speculations. A hypernova releases a tremendous blast of gamma raysthat can be seen clear across the universe by modern equipment.WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF THAT, I THINK, IN JUSTTHE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS.That's right. There have been some famous gamma ray bursters, they are called,that happened far, far away - not just in another galaxy far away as the phraseputs it, but really far away - a large fraction of the distance across the visibleuniverse.AND STILL BEING ABLE TO AFFECT OUR SATELLITES.That's right. There was another one that did happen in our galaxy. It was just alittle thing. It's called a magnetar. It was just a little burst of gamma rays and thatwas enough to temporarily disable the electronics aboard several spacecraft.If Eta Carainae, for example, ever became a hypernova - and some peopleimagine it might some time in the next 30,000 years - we don't have to worryabout next week - if it ever did that, it is conceivable according to some theoriesthat the burst of gamma rays would be sufficient to disable actually mostspacecraft now in use that happen to be on that side of the earth when ithappened.HOW SAFE ARE WE SITTING ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTHROTATING AROUND THIS PARTICULAR SUN IN THISPARTICULAR ARM OF THE GALAXY IN RELATIONSHIP TO STARSOUT THERE THAT POTENTIALLY COULD BURST MORE?That's another fascinating question. I've never looked into it in detail myself, butI've talked with other people who've looked at the question a little bit. It looksas if we're pretty safe because of the earth's atmosphere. The earth's atmosphereprotects us very well against gamma rays and x-rays. It's kind of like being under30 feet of water - that's good shielding. And we can judge from the geologicalrecord, the biological record, that life has been on earth for a long time withoutbeing seriously disturbed. So, a very colorful and rather amusing way to put itwas given by one expert about a year ago when I was talking about Eta Carainaeand he was saying, \"Eta Carainae - the star we were talking about earlier - mightbecome a hypernova. That's just somebody's idea. And he said he was going togive some public talks about whether it was going to be dangerous for us if EtaCarainae 7,500 light years away from us were to become a hypernova andbombard us with gamma rays. And his amusing way of putting it was, \"We'reprobably safe.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Anyway, I wouldn't lose any sleep over it. I am far more worried about being hitby a passing asteroid than having a gamma ray burst that can penetrate earth'satmosphere. But the idea of knocking out satellites is a completely different one- they are not shielded the way we are.THAT COULD BE A MAJOR PROBLEM?Yeah, believe it or not, the earth's atmosphere is much much thicker for gammarays than the metal that is on any spacecraft.THIS PARTICULAR STAR HAS SURPRISED YOU ALREADY IN 150YEARS. SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHAT YOU HAVE DESCRIBEDIS THAT IT'S THE MOST UNPREDICTABLE STAR THAT WE AREWATC H IN G .That's right. There are other stars that are just as mysterious, but almost all ofthem are mysterious because they are very faint and very far away or hiddenbehind thick clouds of dust in the galaxy, so we can't study them very well. EtaCarainae is bright. We can study it easily. And yet, its behavior just nevermatches what we predict for it. It just never behaves itself. It's very extreme.CAN PEOPLE IN AUSTRALIA AND THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERENOW CLEARLY SEE THIS STAR AS IT BRIGHTENS BEINGDIFFERENT IN THE NIGHT SKY?That's right. It's not a bright star yet. The story is basically this: about 30 yearsago you couldn't see Eta Carainae at all with the naked eye. It was just too faint.The dust around it from the explosion has cleared and two years ago someonewith good eyes out on the desert in Australia on a really dark sky could just seeEta Carainae barely. Now, as far as I can tell, the recent brightening has made itappreciably easier to see. And so I'd say now, you still have to go out to a darksky. But now a person with ordinary eyes could see it.If it continues to brighten, it will become relatively easy to see. We're notpredicting it will become one of the brightest stars in the sky again, but thatcould happen. If what's been happening lately continues, it will become a fairlyeasy thing to see. That's an amazing statement for an object that far away.More Information:For more information about the mysterious Eta Carainae and more photographs,visit the Hubble Space Science Telescope web site at http://www.stsci.edu andthe Home Page of astronomer Jon Morse at the Center for Astrophysics andSpace Astronomy, University of Colorado.
