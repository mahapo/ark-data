It struck me as unusual because I've never seena plane pulse like that. It was a slow pulse. And my son said, 'Oh, Dad, it'sprobably just a star or something.' And I said, 'Well, it's too low in the sky to bea star because it's in front of the mountains.' Mount San Jacinto is a mile high.This was below the top of the mountain on the side towards you?Yes, on the west side of the mountain towards me. So, I drove forward and wentahead on I-10 and Indio from Palm Springs is approximately 25 miles east ofPalm Springs. So, I caught up to this thing, whatever it was, some 25 minuteslater down the freeway near Palm Springs, Calif. So, I pulled off the off rampwhich would be Date Palm Drive and I got a look. We were right under it. I got agood look at it. It was shaped like a triangle. What I assumed to be the front of itwas a green light. There were two more lights behind it which were a paleyellow. The middle was a pulsating yellowish light. And it had in each point ofthe craft, it had green it seemed to be fluorescent lights running to the middle ofthis pulsating light.
