CliffordStone in Roswell, New Mexico about his experience on the Cold War border ofEast and West Germany near Fulda in the summer of 1989. He and other bordersecurity were stunned and frightened by the low-flying approach of a huge,silent triangular craft that Sgt. Stone estimated to be about a thousand feet longand as thick as a five story building. There were lights at each corner of thetriangle and a red one in the middle with multi-colored flashing lights outliningthe triangle shape. The huge, silent craft remained stationery for several minutesat about five hundred feet above the German border checkpoint.Since that report, I have received many more eyewitness sightings of aerialtriangles, including one from a Professor of French and Italian at the Universityof Massachusetts, Amherst. In November 1987 two years before Sgt. Stone'sencounter Professor Donald Maddox was at his vacation home in France about180 miles south of Paris. Around midnight, he was walking by an upstairswindow and stopped in amazement at what he saw in the sky. Interviews:Donald Maddox, Ph.D., Professor of French and Italian, University ofMassachusetts, Amherst, Massachusetts: \"Out of the blackness of this nightwas looming perhaps a few miles south of town a huge structure several hundredfeet high which I would say was roughly triangular in shape. And it washovering there at an incline, just a very slight incline. It wasn't directly upright,but perhaps an incline somewhat to the east. And it was a black object exceptthat around it there were all sorts of flashing colored lights of various hues. Inthe black background against the black sky there were red and blue blinkinglights and some were white and so on. And in the center was one moreprominent than the others -- I would say perhaps a shade of red.Like a central light?Ye s .Were the smaller, multi-colored lights outlining the form of the triangle?They were outlining the form of a triangle. But it seemed to me that the objectwas inclined so that the top was angled to the east and the bottom was angled tothe west. I had the sense that I was looking at it from the side at some distance.How many stories high do you thing it was?The first thing I thought of was an enormous radio tower west of Hartford whichwhen you drive by at night is very imposing and must be 500 to 600 feet high. Itappeared to be many, many stories high.Did you hear any sound?No sound. That's the other thing that was extremely eerie. I listened. I openedthe skylight and listened. At that time of night, there is no sound in that part of"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the country, and it was silent.Another Triangular Craft SightingAnother listener had a sighting last month on January 13th (1999). MichaelShinabery has been in radio for 28 years and is now News Director ofKINN-AM and KZZX-FM in Alamogordo, New Mexico. Around 7:30 PM inthe evening on January 13th, he arrived at his rural home about 40 miles east ofAlamogordo.Michael Shinabery, News Director, KINN-AM and KZZX-FM,Alamogordo, New Mexico: \"I had just pulled up to the garage. And I got outand I heard this low, rumbling noise. And I looked up. And right over the houseis a triangular craft. And you really couldn't tell the craft itself because it was sodark. There was no full moon out. We were in a new moon phase. There wasn'ta cloud in the sky. But the way you could tell it was that on each of the cornerswas a glowing light. And I'm somewhat color blind, so it could have beensomewhat green or goldish color. It could have even been a reddish colorbecause I mix my green and red sometimes. But nevertheless, there was a lightthere. They weren't blinking. They were slowly fading out and slowly fading in.One would do that and then another would do that and then the third would dothat. And as I said, there was a low rumbling noise and it was moving in asoutherly to northerly direction. Now, interestingly enough, we have theGerman Luftwaffa scheduled here and they do a lot of night flying, but theyalways fly from west to east.So, I get out of the car and hear this low rumbling noise and look up and there itis right over the house. And it's moving not real fast and not real slow but it ismoving in a northerly direction. And I probably watched it for about 30 secondsbefore it went over the mountain range in the northerly direction out toward U.S. Highway 82 and disappeared over that range.When you were seeing it right above you over the house, if you extend yourhand and compare the end of your finger or span of your hand, how bigwas the object in comparison?It was probably three times the size of the house so you're looking at about 4500square feet.So, judging from that, about how long and wide do you think the trianglewas?About 150 feet long and probably 75 to 100 feet wide.The lights in the corners did they look like a headline or a tensor light? Isthere any other kind of light we might know you can compare them to?They were a very soft glow. We had Christmas lights on the tree and theChristmas lights have this color over them and that gives them a very soft glowand it was probably about that same quality.What was the size of the lights in comparison to the size of the craft?If I put my hand up there and looked at them as it was going over the house, myhand would just have about covered them. And I estimate that was about 1500feet to 2,000 feet above the house. So, my hand would just about covered them.The lights were pretty big, then.Yeah! I mean, I just stood there and looked at it and thought, 'I've heard aboutthese, but this is the first time I've seen one.'In the middle between the three lights forming a triangle, was thereanything in the center?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Nope. Just the three corner lights. And they were sort of a squarish light.Oh, they weren't round?No, they were sort of squarish.Squarish, and definitely not white?Ye s .But because you are color blind, you're not certain of the color?That's right.The square lights were so big that it would take the span of your hand atarm's length to cover one?Correct.The rumble sound, is there anything else on earth similar?It wasn't like any jet sound because a jet sound will start soft and reach acrescendo and if it's traveling at Mach 1 or the speed of sound, it will cause asonic boom. If I were standing outside of an electrical generating plant andheard the rumble of the plant and I have been inside an electrical generatingplant and you feel them as you are standing on the ground whether you'restanding outside the plant or on the concrete inside the plant that was probablywhat I would most compare it to.Were you also feeling frequency vibration along with the rumbling sound?No, I didn't feel anything from my view point, but I definitely heard it. And as itwent away, it did not increase or decrease as you might expect a Doppler Effector a sonic boom. It just stayed steady and as it went over the mountain range, itjust slowly faded away.You said it came south going north from the Alamogordo area near theWhite Sands Missile Range, a center for a lot of military and classifiedproject in the United States. Is there anything there to the south that youassociated with advanced technology development?If I went back down to Alamogordo and went off in a southerly direction, Iwould get out to Ft. Bliss which is managed out of El Paso, Texas which isabout 90 minutes away. And I would probably cover some parts of White SandsMissile Range, so it would be either the Missile Range or Ft./ Bliss. As you getdown towards Orogrande, there's an entrance to the missile range and the Ft.Bliss property and the WSMR sort of parallel each other there. So, that is majorfederal military property in that whole area. In fact, when you go to El Paso,there is only one road there and it goes through the missile range as well as Ft.Bliss. When you go to Las Cruces, there's only one road and it goes throughHolloman AFB as well as WSMR.Did you try to contact anyone down at Ft. Bliss or Holloman AFB or otherareas and say: 'This is what I saw, a triangle with square lights at thecorners. Is this your technology?'No, I didn't, and I'll tell you why. Over the years I have lived up here sinceDecember of 1993. And over the years when I have seen something unusual andhave called them, the basic response is: It's not ours. We don't have any idea.'As a media person, have you ever tried an off the record backgroundconversation about what the triangle might be with any insiders from Ft.Bliss, Holloman AFB or other installations down there in southern NewMexico?Off the record, I have talked to military members who just basically smile andsay 'Oh, yeah.' Now, when I did see this main craft that we're talking about, I did"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"talk with some military experts off the record and they were of the feeling andI've heard the name before but it might be what they call the Manta.The Manta.Yeah, which is supposed to be the next level in stealth technology.Beyond Aurora?Ye s .But when it comes to the question: were you looking at something that isterrestrial or non-terrestrial, what was your gut reaction to what you wereseeing?My gut reaction is that if that is terrestrial, we are, as I believe there was amention made in your book that whoever is producing that if it is terrestrial, it'stechnology that has to be hundreds of years ahead of what we are seeing. If it'snot terrestrial, then are we, as you have discussed, back engineering (ETtechnology)? Nothing that I have seen before when I looked at it my firstreaction was that it wasn't anything we have.What do you know about the Manta?I have tried to find out since I was told information about it and I can findabsolutely nothing except that people have heard the name. And that it is -- atleast the next, or several steps up, in what they call stealth technology. Now,those people who told me have not seen one, I don't believe, and they are onlypassing on information they have been told. They didn't see what I saw, and so Ithink it's hard to make a fair and honest assessment between what they saw and Isaw without actually having witnessed it.\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
