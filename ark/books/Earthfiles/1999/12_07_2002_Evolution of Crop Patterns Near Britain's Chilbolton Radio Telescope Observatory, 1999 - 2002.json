One example ofwhat seems to be patterns related to each other year after year occurred near theChilbolton Radio Telescope Observatory between June 1999 and August 2002.June 16, 1999, Chilbolton ObservatoryOn June 16, 1999, the strange pattern in the foreground marked by a yellowarrow appeared near the observatory.The yellow arrow points at a 230-foot-wide crop formation that appeared on June 16, 1999in a crop field near Chilbolton Observatory in Hampshire, England.Photograph © 1999 by Steve Alexander.There were 138 circles, each 10 feet in diameter, placed inside triangularsections that made up a diamond shape. Look at the branching pattern of circlesflaring out in opposite directions from the center line.One hundred thirty-eight circles, each 10 feet in diameter, defined the triangleand diamond patterns. The flaring middle horizontal axis might be a forerunner to the largerpattern that appeared in front of Chilbolton Observatory the next year in 2000.Aerial photograph © 1999 by Steve Alexander. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"August 2000Now look at what came a year later in August 2000 in the same Chilboltonfield, in almost the same place. This pattern was huge, demanding attention, andclearly anticipated the 2001 formation that would come in the same field andshock the world for awhile.August 2000, this enormous pattern emerged in front of the Chilbolton Observatory,closer to the observatory than the 1999 pattern. This formation also flares outward on twosidesfrom the center, but with much more detail. Aerial photograph © 2001 by Ulrich Kox.This odd pattern would appear yet again in August 2001, but on a much smallerscale as part of another large, complex pattern that would also come down rightin front of the Chilbolton Observatory windows. But in 2001, the flaring glyphwould be embedded in a rectangle of binary code. August 14 - 20, 2001First, on August 14, 2001, the Director of the Chilbolton Observatory, DarcyLadd, said he and other employees noticed a \"shadow\" out in the wheat field.But no one went to investigate and no pilots reported seeing anything in thefield.But on August 20, 2001, Darcy Ladd and all the employees at the observatorywere stunned to look out their front windows at a large rectangle filled with\"bundles\" of standing wheat plants arranged in what looked like binary code.The rectangle of code was right where the large flaring formation had emerged inAugust 2000. Crop formation investigator, Lucy Pringle, received a call from aChilbolton employee about the wheat pattern and Lucy quickly hired a plane tofly her over the wheat. In addition to the large rectangle, she was surprised toalso find a humanoid face staring up at her from the place in the field that DarcyLadd had called a \"shadow.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Aerial of humanoid face and binary code, both discovered in the wheat fieldnear the British Chilbolton Observatory in Hampshire on August 20, 2001.Aerial photograph © 2001 by Lucy Pringle.When Paul Vigay, Director of the Independent Research Center for UnexplainedPhenomena in Southsea, Hampshire, England, first saw the aerial photograph ofthe \"code\" formation he immediately recognized it as extremely similar to thetransmission encoded with digital binary information that was sent on November16, 1974, from the Arecibo, Puerto Rico radio telescope out into space towardthe star cluster, Messier 13, about 23,000 light years from Earth in the MilkyWay galaxy. The Arecibo transmission was planned by astronomers at CornellUniversity, including the late Carl Sagan. Cornell University operates the300-meter-diameter radio telescope built into a mountain under a cooperativeagreement with the National Science Foundation.

Above are nine variously sized circles that depict our solar system,beginning with the sun on the far right. The third planet from the sun (earth) israised above the other planets indicating our planet, Earth, is the source of theradio transmission. Further, Earth is at the feet of a humanoid figure whose sixfoot height was indicated to the right in units of the Arecibo wavelengthtransmission, 12.6 centimeters. To the left of the humanoid figure is the binarycode for the earth's 1974 human population.So, a logical speculation is that the strange pattern of 2000 and in the 2001 coderepresents some kind of transmitter. Arecibo sent out in radio waves; what kindof transmitter puts wheat down in binary code?If you look at the center of the Chilbolton \"transmitter,\" you find four little dotsarranged exactly as the 5th planet from the sun is depicted in the Chilboltonwheat code solar system. I asked a Cornell University astronomer if he knewwhat a planet divided into four dots might mean? He said he had not seen thatbefore, but speculated it might indicate four moons, or a planet divided into fourterritories. Again, it is logical to speculate that the four dots at the center of thebottom \"transmitter\" indicate the transmission source is from the planet depictedas four dots. August 15, 2002Another year later, nearly to the day on August 15, 2002, a formation in wheatis reported 8.5 miles from the Chilbolton Observatory on a hill top farm nearWinchester, Hampshire. A small woods that runs along the field is calledCrabwood, so some people have called it the Crabwood formation."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The first photographs of this Winchester/Crabwood formationwere taken on August 16, 2002, the day after an e-mail announcement froman unknown source on August 15, 2002, gave survey coordinates for the new crop pattern.Aerial photograph © 2002 by Steve Alexander.This time, there is another face and code, but the face is not humanoid like theChilbolton one. The face is a characterization of all the \"grey alien\" faces thathave been drawn over the past thirty years by people in the so-called \"humanabduction syndrome.\" Allegedly, people are taken physically, mentally, or both,from their cars, bedrooms, or yards, into an extraterrestrial craft whereextraterrestrial biological entities perform examinations and often extract spermor ova. The creatures are generally described as grey-colored with faces verysimilar to the one patterned in the Winchester wheat field.Pattern in wheat of \"grey alien\" face and round discof 8 bit binary encoding in hexadecimal form.Aerial photograph © 2002 by Lucy Pringle.While the 2001 Chilbolton code was a large rectangle of binary code similar tothe 1974 Arecibo radio telescope transmission, the 2002 code was produced ina spiral of 8 bit binary encoding in hexadecimal form with English alphabetletters represented by ASCII character sets used by computer programmers sincethe 1960s.
