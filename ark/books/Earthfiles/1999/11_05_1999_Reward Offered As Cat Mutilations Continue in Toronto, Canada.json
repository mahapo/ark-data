Thereward offer has generated phone calls, but no suspects. The SPCA's leadinspector, Debbie Hunt, is now seeking help from the Toronto Police: \"We don'thave the resources or enough experience in profiling criminals.\" Inspector TonyWarr, recent chief investigator in a Toronto bedroom rapist case, will head a newbehavioral assessment unit. Their focus will be serial killers, and presumably aninternational ring of them since similar cat mutilations have been occurring inLondon, England, San Jose, California, Ft. Worth, Texas and Ontario, Canada atthe same time in 1999. Over the past couple of decades, odd cat mutilationshave also been investigated repeatedly in Plano, Texas; Tustin, California; FallsChurch, Virginia and other U. S. and Canada regions.Half-cat photographed by Plano, Texas Police Officerfor Incident Report # 91-44994, August 31, 1991.Hunt has photographs of the current Ontario mutilated cats, many of themprecisely and bloodlessly cut in half. One is an orange and white cat, collar stillattached. There is a wound above the cat's eye and some bruising around theneck where odd punctures in the throat have been found in some of themutilated animals. The abdomen was severed in half with a \"razor-straight cut.\"Only the front half remained with all its organs intact. Debbie Hunt toldreporters, \"It's like a bandsaw or a very sharp knife is doing this. Wild animalsaren't. (Otherwise) the liver, the lungs and the organs would be strewn about.\"Further, the half cats are left near schoolyards or on well-lit street corners as ifpurposely laid out to be found. Ms. Hunt told me, \"We're talking to somepathologists about the nature of the cuts and have been sworn to secrecy onsome things.\"In the past two weeks, the case number climbed from seven to ten as three moremutilated cats were found beyond North York, a Toronto suburb where the firstanimal was discovered on August 12th. Those three new cases included a catbody found in Mississauga, a community west of Toronto. Another was locatedin Parry Sound approximately 100 miles directly north of Toronto. Anotherrecent mutilation was in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario at the western edge of the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Ontario province.Four years ago almost to the day - August 15, 1995 - an earlier cycle of catmutilations occurred in Toronto. There were no arrests. Across the continent inVancouver, B. C. in May to June, 1992, several half cats were found withoutfinding the culprit or culprits. Further back in 1978, authorities in St. Catharinesnear Toronto were also frustrated by more than one hundred missing cats anddogs and others found skinned and badly mutilated. In each of these mutilationcycles, many of the animals have been found cut in half bloodlessly, usuallywith the front half of the cat placed to be found. These facts have convincedmany investigators that the animals are taken some place, killed and cut, andthen returned to yards and sidewalks near their owner's homes.Nick Thomas, Director of Communications for the Ontario SPCA, talked to meabout the current status of their investigation.Interview:Nick Thomas, Director of Communications, Ontario Society for thePrevention of Cruelty to Animals, New Market, Ontario, Canada: \"So far,autopsies have only been carried out on four of the cats that have beenmutilated.WERE THEY ALL IN THE NORTH YORK AREA OF TORONTO?That is correct.WHAT WERE THE GENERAL FINDINGS?The general findings were that human intervention played a part in themutilation of the cats.DID THEY EXAMINE THE EXCISION ITSELF FOR ANY SIGNS OFHIGH HEAT FROM SOME SORT OF CAUTERY-CUTTING DEVICE?It is my understanding that some type of a cutting device has been used, but Idon't know if heat evidence has been confirmed. The police have developed aprofile of what these individual or individuals may be like and that profile leadsthem to believe that some of these mutilations have been carried out with aspecial instrument, a special type of scalpel, which they believe could lead themto the individuals carrying out these cat mutilations.SO IT SUGGESTS THERE MAY BE SOME SORT OFEXTRAORDINARY SHAPE POSSIBLY ABOUT THE INSTRUMENTTHAT HAS MADE THE CUTS, WORKING BACKWARDS FROM THEEXCISIONS?Right, that would be appropriate speculation. But I don't know.WERE ALL OF THESE FOUR CATS EXAMINED BY AVETERINARIAN AND DID YOU HAVE ONLY THE FRONT HALF OFTHE CATS?In some instances, it was the head that was found and the autopsies performedon that portion of the body.SO HAVE THERE BEEN DECAPITATIONS AS OPPOSED TO CUT INHALF?In the first instances in North York, two cats were decapitated.I'M QUOTING HERE FROM THE TORONTO SUN, OCTOBER 21ST,AND THE QUOTE IS FROM (the SPCA's) DEBBIE HUNT: \"The cats arebeing cut in half and placed where people will find them.\"That is correct. And as Debby points out, it would appear that the cats weredeliberately placed in the locations so that they would be found.DID THE VETERINARIAN REPORT ANYTHING ABOUT WHETHERALL THE ORGANS IN THE UPPER PART OF THE CATS HAD BEENREMOVED AS WELL?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I cannot comment on that. I don't know that.HAVE YOU ALL BEEN AWARE OF THE CAT MUTILATIONS GOINGON DURING THIS SAME PERIOD OF TIME IN SAN JOSE,CALIFORNIA AND IN LONDON, ENGLAND? (See: Earthfiles.comOctober 3, 1999)Yes, we are.AND IN TALKING WITH INVESTIGATORS IN THOSE CITIES ANDCOMPARING, ARE YOU ESSENTIALLY DEALING WITH THE SAMEPATTERN?We're being made aware of these things and we've tried to get some informationon them, but we haven't been very successful in learning the details of it. Andthat's why we ourselves have been trying to put as much details as we can outabout the instances in Toronto.YOU MEAN SPCAS IN OTHER AREAS WOULDN'T BE OPEN WITHYOU?Well, I think they encounter some of the same problems that we wouldencounter in terms of the amount of information that we can make available inthe public domain in terms of how it might impact a subsequent investigationand any court case. The laws here in Canada are much more restrictive in thisarea. But at the same time, we have been made aware of the situations inLondon, particularly, and we have contacted the Royal SPCA to get anyinformation they can make available to us.IN TERMS OF INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN COMPAREDBETWEEN ENGLAND AND CALIFORNIA AND TORONTO, WOULDIT BE FAIR TO SAY IT IS THE SAME TYPE OF HALF CATS ANDDECAPITATED CATS ALL DONE IN THE SAME BLOODLESSFASHION ?I would say absolutely yes. Everything indicates there is a great similarity in allthree instances here, which is covering a lot of geography at the same time.\"More Information:Anyone with information is asked to call Inspector Debbie Hunt at the OntarioSociety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) at (416) 410-4836.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
