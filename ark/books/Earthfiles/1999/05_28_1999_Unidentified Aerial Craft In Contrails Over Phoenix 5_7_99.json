He was puzzled by thenumber of contrails, some in X-shapes, and aimed the camera sequentiallymoving around the sky. He did not realize until he went to his computer todownload the digital images that he had captured unidentified aerial craft.Interview:Gary Graham, Salesman, Phoenix, Arizona: \"I've been kind of interested inthe contrails and been taking pictures of them for the last several months. Andso, I looked up into the sky and the sky was just full of contrails that morning,including an X which - I've seen a lot of contrails up there, but not an X everysingle time. So, I was taking pictures starting from the north and then turningclockwise and I probably took about six to eight pictures and wound up kind offacing to the south, southwest, with my last picture.And about an hour later, I went to the computer and downloaded them into thecomputer and I was looking at them to see if there was anything I would like toput on my web page. members.home.net/garyariz/index.htm I've put most ofthe of the contrails I've taken on my web page. As I went through them startingwith the first picture heading towards the last picture, they were pretty muchtypical with the contrail in there and what I had expected to be seeing. And thenI got to the last picture, or next to last (turns out it was last), and I sawsomething in that picture and it was definitely unexpected.WHAT DID YOU SEE?When I first looked at this, it looked almost like a round, metallic ball in thesky. I kind of focused in over the roof of my next door neighbor's house and justoutside one of the clouds up there and fairly close to one of the contrails, therewas this round, metallic, ball-looking thing. And then right next to that, fairlyclose to it, there was a dark spot on the film. And as I zoomed in on it, I couldstill see what appeared to be kind of a round metallic object up there, but thenthe two dark spots - or actually, the dark spot - looked like TWO dark spots. Itlooked to me as if it could be a couple of military jets. They were dark in colorwhatever they were. They were kind of in the shape of an aircraft.YOU WERE TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS WITH THIS NEW CAMERA,SO YOU WERE CONCENTRATING ON THE NEW CAMERA. BUTDID YOU NOT HEAR THE SOUND OF JETS?No. no. One other thing I was going to mention - there was another photo I took,I think it was the one just before this that has that same cloud in it. It's justslightly moved from that location. But, in that picture there was nothing otherthan that same cloud. You could see the form of it. You can tell it's the samecloud."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"WHAT TIME PERIOD DO YOU THINK IS BETWEEN THE TWOPHOTOS?Oh, it was just a couple of seconds. About the time it takes for the camera toregenerate to the next shot.I THINK THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO SHOW THATWHATEVER HAPPENED IN THE SECOND PHOTOGRAPH DID NOTSEEM TO BE IN THE FIRST PHOTOGRAPH TWO SECONDSBEFORE.Right.THAT WOULD MAKE BOTH OBJECTS, THE BLACK AND THEROUND OBJECT, ANOMALOUS.Ye s .HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING ANOMALOUS IN THE SKIESBEFORE THIS PHOTOGRAPH ON MAY 7TH OF THESE UNUSUALOBJECTS IN THE CONTRAILS? Phoenix Lights on March 13, 1997:As a matter of fact on March 13, 1997, when what came through here they arenow calling the 'Phoenix Lights.' I was a witness to that also.WHAT HAPPENED.I was going to a friend's house. It was just a little after dark, probably somewherebetween 8 and 8:30 in the evening. So, it was fairly dark out at that time of year.And I pulled up in front of his house and was just turning the car off, just aboutto get out and I looked out my driver's side window and I saw four lights in thesky. Maybe about 3,000 to 4,000 feet up in the air. And they were just huge,bright lights. They appeared to be maybe a couple of miles from where I was.But what was unusual about it was that they were in the shape of a diamond -like with one light at the top and one at each side and one at the bottom.So, I kept looking trying to figure out, 'What is this?' Because I had never seenanything like this before. And I noticed they were coming straight down out ofthe sky. They were all coming down at the same time, so it wasn't like they wereindividual objects. They appeared to be all moving at the same rate of speedwhich was actually fairly slow.LIKE FOUR LIGHTS ON SOME SORT OF A LARGE OBJECT THATWAS THE SHAPE OF A DIAMOND?Right.OR AT LEAST THE LIGHTS WERE IN THE CONFIGURATION OF ADIAMOND ON A LARGE OBJECT?Right. More like that actually. And so I was trying to figure out in my mind,'What is this?' and what came to mind was that it might be a commercial jetlinerin a nose dive headed toward the ground. But then I thought that can't bebecause it was moving too slow. And I just didn't know what it was. And as itcontinued down, I kept thinking I was going to see this gigantic ball of flamesburst up when it hits the ground. Then it just kind of disappeared behind thehouse across the street from where I was. Then I couldn't see it any longer.Then this turned out to be the Phoenix Lights. As the story goes, they came fromoutside of Phoenix from the north headed down through Phoenix and kind ofturned and headed out towards the Tucson area. And there's just been people allover the city and state who have seen these. And evidently, that's what I saw.\"We b s it e s :"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"members.home.net/garyariz/index.htmwww.contrailconnection.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
