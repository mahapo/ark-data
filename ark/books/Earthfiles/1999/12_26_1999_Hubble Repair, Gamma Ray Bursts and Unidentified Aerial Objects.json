This Christmas week,astronauts were able to repair the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope with six newgyroscopes, a new computer, a new radio transmitter and more batteries. Hubblehasn't been able to work since November 13th. But now, the nine-year-oldobservatory should be back in service around the middle of January. NASA cutthe repair trip short so the Discovery space shuttle and crew could landtomorrow, back in plenty of time before New Year's Eve and any possible Y2Kcomputer problems.Gamma Ray BurstsNASA also had good luck this month with its gamma ray burst research. One ofthe most violent and mysterious events in the universe are sudden bursts ofgamma radiation in the cosmos. For the first time on December 16th,instruments aboard the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory were able to lockonto a gamma ray burst only four hours after a powerful flash of radiation waspicked up. Even the Chandra X-Ray Observatory was able to photograph thefading explosion four days after the gamma burst from an object identified asGRB 991216.Graphic by BATSE Team, NASA/MarshallSpace Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama.The BATSE team (Burst and Transient Source Experiment) at NASA/MarshallSpace Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama said, \"The hunt for the December16, 1999 gamma ray burst started with a low-intensity trigger, followed 20seconds later by an intense blast of gamma radiation. The trigger eventwas a flash of radiation just powerful enough to switch on the BATSE alertingsystem. In about 20% of gamma bursts, a small precursor burst comes before themain event. No one yet knows why.\"Earlier this year, another huge gamma ray burst many light years away affectedsome of our earth-orbiting satellites. NASA says that \"one of the leading theoriesfor the cause of gamma ray bursts is the collapse of a super-massive star\" inwhich jets of matter burrow out through the poles and then rip the star apart."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Image Credit: A super-massive star, after burning all of its nuclear fuel,starts to explode as a supernova, but the overlying atmosphere is too massiveto blow off and the explosion collapses, forming jets of matter that burrow outthrough the poles and then rip the star apart. Graphic and information by Stan Woosley,University of California, Santa Cruz, CA., from the 5th Huntsville Gamma Ray BurstSymposium.Exploded stars, or supernovae, are also helping scientists to understand thatnearly ALL of the elements we know about - other than hydrogen and helium -were created in the interiors of stars.Image: An X-ray image of Cassiopeia A, the remnant of an exploded star reveals gaseousclumpsof silicon, sulfur and iron expelled from deep in the interior of the star. The red, green andblue regionsin this Chandra X-ray image of the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A show where theintensity of low,medium and high energy X-rays, respectively, is greatest. The red material on the left outeredge is enrichedin iron, whereas the bright greenish white region on the lower left is enriched in silicon andsulfur.In the blue region on the right edge, low and medium energy x-rays have been filtered outby a cloud of dustand gas in the remnant.

This iswhy the study of supernovae and supernova remnants is so important. Oncereleased from stars, newly-created elements can then participate in the formationof new stars and planets in a great cycle that has gone on numerous timesalready. It is remarkable to realize that our planet Earth and indeed evenhumanity itself is part of this vast cosmic recycling.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Image: Cassiopeia A as seen by the Chandra Observatory's Advanced CCDImaging Spectrometer (ACIS), 1999.

A peculiar aerial object shaped likean arrowhead with the rear curved inward was observed for nearly an hour onDecember 21st by Dominic Tavares, a water treatment technician, and his11-year-old son. Below the \"arrowhead\" craft, five helicopters circled. Theywere traveling on the I-10 freeway just outside of Indio, California headed westtowards the San Jacinto Mountains which rise above Palm Springs.Dominic Tavares, Water Treatment Technician, Bermuda Dunes,California: \"As I looked towards the mountains, I noticed a pulsating pale, lightcolored it was just a bright light. It struck me as unusual because I've never seena plane pulse like that. It was a slow pulse. And my son said, 'Oh, Dad, it'sprobably just a star or something.' And I said, 'Well, it's too low in the sky to bea star because it's in front of the mountains.' Mount San Jacinto is a mile high.This was below the top of the mountain on the side towards you?Yes, on the west side of the mountain towards me. So, I drove forward and wentahead on I-10 and Indio from Palm Springs is approximately 25 miles east ofPalm Springs. So, I caught up to this thing, whatever it was, some 25 minuteslater down the freeway near Palm Springs, Calif. So, I pulled off the off rampwhich would be Date Palm Drive and I got a look. We were right under it. I got agood look at it. It was shaped like a triangle. What I assumed to be the front of itwas a green light. There were two more lights behind it which were a paleyellow. The middle was a pulsating yellowish light. And it had in each point ofthe craft, it had green it seemed to be fluorescent lights running to the middle ofthis pulsating light. The center of it.You mean like bands or rods of light coming from the corners to thecenter?Correct. My son, he was a little frightened. He said, 'Dad, I'm getting scared. Idon't know what that is.'And it was there for just a few seconds, just floating and it moved to the northjust a little and then you could see it in the northwest at the next city out ofPalm Springs would be Cabazon and then there's Banning and Beaumont. So, Ipulled over to get some gas and got back on the freeway and it was visible to mefor another maybe 30 minutes until I hit Banning. And I lost it over the SanBernardino Mountains. We saw it for 45 minutes. We got a good look at it formaybe 2 or 3 minutes when we got right underneath it. And I followed it as faras I could until it was out of sight and I haven't heard anything from the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"newspaper or the news. I really don't know what it was. But I know it wasn't thestealth aircraft that we have because it was just floating there.When you were right under it, about how big was it?Oh, God. I would say it had to be a football field or two long. It was big! It wasat least 3/4's of a mile up. The helicopters were well below it and this thing wasquite a ways above the helicopters, but it had to be at least a football or twofootball fields big.The helicopters just circled below it?They were keeping their distance. There were five of them. They kept theirdistance. Didn't really approach it, didn't get too close to it.What did the light seem to do in relationship to the approach of thehelicopters?I didn't see any change in the craft at all, in any of its lights or movement at all.How long were the helicopters circling below?Oh, gosh, it had to be for the whole duration, from the time I saw it, the pointwhen I was in Indio until Banning and Beaumont. Other aircraft fly out of thatarea going to Ontario Airport.What you mean is that the helicopters were below this pulsing object for atleast 45 minutes?Yes, but they were keeping their distance, though.Could you see detail on the bottom clearly?Yes. As I said before, it had a green light that appeared to be in front of it andtwo small tail lights at the rear of it. And these three green, I guess lines orsomething running to the middle of this pulsing light. And it was a triangle, butit was wedge shaped. It seemed to have concave at the rear of it. It was shapedlike an arrowhead.If you were going to compare the color of the green at the front leadingedge to something that we might all know, what green would you compareit to?I would say the closest thing that everybody would know is a green traffic light.But not exactly like it. A different illumination something about it wasdifferent.\"Round Silver Ball Craft and Bigfoot, December 6, 1999Unusual objects that people see in the skies are still coming down towards theground - like the large silver ball that Rosie Baney and her daughter saw neartheir North Baltimore home in northwestern Ohio at the end of September. Thesilver ball descended slowly between trees growing around a bean field aboutthree-quarters of a mile from their house.Rosie Baney, North Baltimore, Ohio: \"It looked like it was real close to thetop of the trees and it went down into the field. It didn't land, but it just stayedin one spot. And then it come up. And then all at once it disappeared. I don'tknow.How long did you and your daughter watch it?Probably about five minutes."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Was it like silver metal?Yes, it was silver. From where we saw it, it was silver.And it wasn't no airplane,no way! I mean it was round shaped, what I saw of it in the front part. I don'tknow what it looked like in the back part of it.It was huge what I saw and my daughter saw it, too. And this sounds reallyweird, too. But my husband and I was jogging one day and down that side whereI saw whatever it was, across the road you're not going to believe this some greatbig, tall it looked like a big tall man that had hair he was taller than a man andhe was walking across the road, come from the field across the road to thewoods.Would he have looked like a Bigfoot with a lot of hair from head to feet?Yes, he was not white. What I saw was black. Or dark, the hair was dark. It comefrom the out of the field into the woods, that's all I can tell you. But it was not aperson.\"In my book Glimpses of Other Realities, Volume II: High Strangeness, there isa report with drawings from a man named Steve Bismarck who lives inSnohomish, Washington. Back in the Easter weekend of 1977, Mr. Bismarckwatched a dark-haired Bigfoot lowered down from a large silver disc hoveringover woods near his rural home. He sketched the tall humanoid creature andwrote, \"This ape-like animal walked upright. It had extremely black hair aboutthree inches long, or more. It had a big, cone-shaped head that extended downto a big hump on its back. Its legs were much longer than an ape's. I didn't drawthem long enough. And the arms were shorter than an ape's. They seemed toswing to the extreme as it walked by.\"Drawing by Steve Bismarck for Glimpses of Other Realities,Vol. II: High Strangeness Â© 1998 by Linda Moulton Howe.Another family in Elizabeth, Colorado back in the mid-1970s also associatedthe presence of Bigfoot in their yard with silver discs and animal mutilations ontheir ranch. See An Alien Harvest in the Earthfiles Shop. Many othereyewitness accounts from South Dakota, Montana, Pennsylvania, Oregon,Washington and other regions of the country have described similar hairyhumanoids associated with sightings of unidentified aerial objects in the sky."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"More Information:I would appreciate information from anyone else who might have been on theI-10 freeway between 5 and 6 PM on Tuesday, December 21st and also saw thearrowhead-shaped object in the sky with the five helicopters below.
