Mr.Cayce lived in the first half of the 20th Century and is famous for his ability toremote view sick people, find out what was wrong and suggest a treatment thatoften worked. Over nearly five decades, as Cayce tapped into illnesses of thebody, he could also see other lives of the patient's soul -- including incarnationsin Atlantis between 12,000 and 50,000 years ago. And he said he could see alikelihood of earth changes at the end of the 20th Century.Recently I talked with his son, Edgar Evans Cayce, now a retired electricalengineer in Virginia Beach, Virginia where his father died in 1945. The son hasstudied his father's several thousand readings and compiled information aboutAtlantis in a book entitled Mysteries of Atlantis Revisited now out inpaperback in most bookstores.I asked Edgar Evans Cayce about Atlantis, earth changes and how accurate hisfather's readings to diagnose illnesses have turned out to be in the evolution oftime. Throughout the interview, he generally refers to his father as \"Cayce.\"Interview:Edgar Evans Cayce, Retired Electrical Engineer and Author, VirginiaBeach, Virgina: \"Of the 14,000 readings, we found maybe a couple of hundredthat seemed to be inaccurate. That still gives him a batting average of about98-99% which is about as good as most doctors these days.DID HE CHARACTERIZE ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD WHENTHERE MIGHT MORE LIKELY BE EARTH CHANGES THANANOTHER?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I think it was beginning in 1998 on into the next few years.WE'RE IN THAT PERIOD NOW?We're in that period now or getting close to it. And I guess that's whyeverybody's excited about it as the Millennium comes up. But in the back of ourbook we show the earthquake zones. A group of scientists, the AmericanAssociation of Engineering Society made a study of the fault zones in theeastern United States. We've got the maps of them in the back of the book. Andthey published this pamphlet in 1987. I think it was about 60 years before thatpamphlet was written that Cayce named those same areas as possibleearthquakes. Now the scientists in this pamphlet say the likelihood of a majorquake in the eastern United States in the next 25 years -- and that was 25 yearsfrom 1987 -- was 100%. And that's just about a certainty. They don't knowwhich areas will be hit, but they are pretty sure they are very likely to get amajor quake in one of those areas.WHAT DID YOUR FATHER SEE AS THE MOST LIKELY EARTHCHANGES IN THE UNITED STATES?I think it was in the Eastern seaboard and in the Charleston area and eventuallyin the New York area. And he talked about the same one around the middle ofthe country, around Missouri and Arkansas where they had the largest quake inthe United States (Madrid Fault) in the past. And he talked about those threeareas were probably the most likely. But here again, I hope he's wrong. I hopethe scientists are wrong. I hope we don't have a major quakeWHAT DID YOUR FATHER SEE FOR NEW YORK, FOR EXAMPLE?He said it would be destroyed. He talked about it being re-built. That it wouldbe re-built. That was the only thing he said about it. I don't think the whole stateis going under water. But it sounded like it was going to be destroyed, orpossibly destroyed. But the future is not fixed. And I hope he's wrong.HOW DID HE SEE NEW YORK BEING DESTROYED?He didn't say. It sounded like an earthquake. I don't think it was military or war.WHAT ABOUT OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD?He talked about parts of Japan going into the sea. He said it was very likely thata large part of Japan would go into the sea. The western part of the UnitedStates would have some earthquakes. And parts of Europe would be changed.And that land would be coming up in the Atlantic. Now, I don't know if he wastalking about Atlantis coming up again, or just some land mass coming up again.GOING BACK TO THE BOOK MYSTERIES OF ATLANTIS REVISITED,I WONDER IF YOU COULD FOR A RADIO AUDIENCE HIGHLIGHTSOME OF THIS INFORMATION THAT YOUR FATHERTHROUGHOUT MANY DIFFERENT READINGS YOU HAVECONSOLIDATED INTO A VERY INTERESTING BOOK ABOUTATLANTIS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF EDGAR CAYCE?The way the book was written was that most of the information about Atlantisdid not come from one or two readings, but from just pieces here and there ofindividual life readings. A life reading was a type of reading in which he gave asort of vocational guidance reading that described a person's past life and whateffect it had on the present. And there were about 2500 of these so-called lifereadings. And of those 2500 life readings, about 700 of them mentionedincarnations in Atlantis.Most of the time, Cayce was describing the person's life there and what effectthat particular incarnation might have on the present. So, there wasn't a lot ofdetail in any one reading of what Atlantis was like. But if you put all those 700readings together and try to get them in some kind of chronological order, youcan get a sort of picture of what was happening there. He claimed that Atlantishad been there a long time, as long as maybe 200,000 years ago. He talkedabout three destructions of Atlantis rather than just one. He talked about one inabout 50,000 B. C. when a part of the continent was destroyed. And he talkedabout one in about 28,000 B. C. when it was broken up into a few remaining"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"islands. And the last one about 10,000 B. C. was when the last island wentdown. And I think that was the description of a time that Plato was talkingabout, about 9600-10,000 B.C.WHERE DID YOUR FATHER PLACE ATLANTISGEOGRAPHICALLY?He said it was in the south Atlantic. He said the western edge of it was in theBimini/Bermuda area off the coast of Florida, or almost to the coast of Florida.Actually, if you look at a map or a geologic map that the Coast and Geodeticpeople have, a lot of that area in hundreds or thousands of square miles is veryshallow in that area. And the sea level 10,000 years ago was probably 100 feetor more higher or lower than it is now. So, a lot of that land would have beenabove water, been exposed.IN THE LAST DECADE, HAS THERE BEEN ANYTHING OF ANYSUBSTANCE DISCOVERED THAT MIGHT BE UNDERWATERARCHAEOLOGY?Well, there's been some interesting discoveries. There hasn't been any evidencefor Atlantis. But they found this so-called Bimini Road which is a lot of peculiarformation of stone blocks. Geologists claim that it's beach rock because there areformations like that in other parts of the world. The only difference in this one isthat normally beach rock will fracture parallel to the shore. And this is veryshallow, about 10 to 20 feet of water just off the coast of Bimini. It looks likepieces of block, like a wall or road. But the only problem is that it curves at theend in a kind of reverse J. It's unusual for beach rock to do that, to fracture likethat. Now, there have been some other discoveries there. Doug Richards, who isone of the co-authors of the book, has done some scuba diving and he ran asonic survey in the Gulf Stream right off the western edge of Bimini where thewater drops off from very shallow to about 125 to 150 feet deep.They found some caves -- it looked like caves or holes in the side of that cliff orwall under the water. And they found some, it looked like on the sonic survey asstraight lines. Now, it's unusual for rocks to be in that straight a line. Of course,it might be something off of a shipwreck or part of a structure of some kind. Youneed to go back in a submarine or with some deep diving equipment andinvestigate that with a camera rather than just depending on the sonic surveybecause you can't tell what it is from that.Also there are some peculiar formations off Bimini in a mangrove swamp there.There's a thing -- I guess you would call it a sand dune -- it looks like a shark.You can see it from the air very clearly. And it may be a natural formation, but itcertainly is an unusual one because it looks exactly like a shark. And there aresome other formations there. One looks like a cat and another looks like sort ofa rectangle, or a cross between a triangle and a rectangle.This May 1996 aerial photograph of the Shark Mound in Bimini is courtesy of Joan Hanley.This unusual formation is 530 feet long and resembles Lemon Sharks which are common totheBimini waters.

Above the whale is the shark mound."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Shark Mound in Bimini. Infrared aerial image © 1989 by Raymond Leigh. ANY WAY TO DATE ANYTHING ABOUT THE SHARK?They haven't found anything yet. They haven't found any artifacts, or anythingalong that mound. It's pretty hard from looking at it to tell from the air or evenbeing on it. There are trees and vegetation growing over it. And it's pretty hard toget anything to date. They haven't found artifacts of any kind.LET'S GO DEEPER INTO SOME OF THE MORE OUTSTANDINGINSIGHTS THAT YOUR FATHER LEFT IN THE READINGS ABOUTATLANTIS.He talked about things that sound like atomic power or sound like lasers andmasers. He talks about some sort of a crystal that is a power source. A laser is agreat power source and it could be used for removing cataracts or it could beused by the military for a death ray to destroy in-coming missiles.He talks about transportation, he talks about aircraft in the past. Now, there justisn't any evidence, nobody has ever found an airplane and nobody has everfound any record of a technical civilization, except for those Piri Ris maps.You've heard of those, I'm sure.YES, AND THEY EVEN SHOW ANTARCTICA WITHOUT ANY ICE.Without any ice. And that was a long time ago. And they say they show it soaccurately that the people who have examined them don't see how they couldhave been made without aerial photos. So, that's a hint of a technicalcivilization. And nobody knows how they built the Great Pyramid yet. I mean,there are 2 million blocks to that thing!ISN'T IT POSSIBLE THERE COULD HAVE BEEN ANEXTRATERRESTRIAL CIVILIZATION THAT WAS BASED ON OURPLANET FOR VARIOUS CYCLES OF TIME AND THAT THEY MAYHAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS FAMOUS ATLANTIS?That's a theory I've heard advanced by a number of people. But it's nevermentioned in the readings. He didn't mention anything like that. He did say therewas other life in the universe, I mean, in many forms and all over. He said therewasn't anything like this man-like in this solar system, but he said there was a lot(of life) in the universe. He talks about two different groups in Atlantis kind ofwarring with each other. The ones that believed that man had a spiritual natureand the ones that believed the physical was all there was. And these two groupscontinually fought each other and it was war between these two groups thatstarted or triggered some of these volcanic eruptions that destroyed Atlantis.More Information:All of Edgar Cayce's readings -- more than 14,000 -- are now on CD-ROMwhich is available from the Association for Research and Enlilghtenment inVirginia Beach, Va.
