In fact, comets are not uniformlydistributed.\"- Daniel Whitmire, Ph.D., Professor of Physics,University of Louisiana, Lafayette -October 25, 1999 Lafayette, Louisiana Physicists in the United States andEngland have been studying the orbits of comets and are theorizing thatsomething is pulling on the icy clumps that revolve at the dark and outermostedges of our solar system. The \"perturber\" might be a brown dwarf three timesmore massive than the sun and orbiting about three trillion miles from earth inthe primeval Oort Cloud of ice, rocks and dust that literally surrounds the familyof sun, planets, moons, asteroids and comets in our solar system.Inset depicts nine planets of our known solar system embedded inside the large cloud ofdebris left over from theformation of our system known as the Oort Cloud.

Normal stars shine like the sun and do so because"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"of thermonuclear reactions in the center of the star. But in order for thethermonuclear reactions to take place, a star's central temperature has to bemillions of degrees. That will occur if the mass of the star is above 8% the massof our sun. If less than that, the almost-sun never ignites and becomes a browndwarf.Observational data to support the theory of a brown dwarf far beyond Pluto willbe laid out in a paper to be published in the prestigious astrophysics journalIcarus in November. One of the authors is Daniel Whitmire, Ph.D., Professor ofPhysics at the University of Louisiana, Lafayette, where he has taught fortwenty-five years. He and another physics colleague, John Matese, havecollaborated on celestial mechanics and dynamics problems, including themystery of uneven distribution of comets in our solar system. Recently I talkedwith Dr. Whitmire and asked him what provoked his interest in the orbitalanomalies of comets in the first place?Interview:Daniel Whitmire, Ph.D., Prof. of Physics, University of Louisiana,Lafayette, Louisiana: \"What provoked me was the discovery by twopaleontologists at the University of Chicago that the fossil record showed massextinctions on earth were not at random, but had a regular pattern to them thatoccurred every 26 to 30 million years. And so if that's the case, then you need amodel to explain that. And prior to that, it was discovered that the impact of alarge comet or asteroid was responsible for the mass extinctions of the dinosaursand two-thirds of life on earth 65 million years ago. So, it was sort of natural toconsider a model in which all the mass extinctions were due to impacts ofcomets or asteroids.But it's not that easy to come up with a model in which the earth gets struck by acomet every 26 to 30 million years. There were two or three models proposed atthe time. The Nemesis Model was one that I proposed and published in 1984, amodel in which a small companion star to the sun perturbed the comets in theOort Cloud. So I got interested in the dynamics of a possible solar companionstar, a small star, in 1984.The Nemesis theory involves a brown dwarf out in the Oort Cloud. But theobjective of the Nemesis Theory was to give the brown dwarf a proposed orbitsuch that it came into the inner part of the Oort Cloud where it perturbed theorbits of comets there causing a fraction of them to be shot into the inner solarsystem where they would collide with the earth. So, again this was motivated byan attempt to explain why mass extinctions as well as crater periods on the earthseem to follow a pattern. But the required orbit for Nemesis had to have a lot ofeccentricity, a lot of elongation, for that model to work.This brown dwarf we're now proposing doesn't really fit my original Nemesisidea at all, but we're just driven to this new theory by the data as we see it. Thedata tells us what the orbit of the comet orbit perturber ought to be and it's notlike the orbit of Nemesis. But it would be out in the Oort Cloud, too, withoutthe terribly elongated orbit that a Nemesis would have to have.YOU DON'T THINK THIS PROPOSED BROWN DWARF NOW THATYOU'RE GOING TO BE DESCRIBING IN ICARUS COULD BERESPONSIBLE FOR THE CYCLIC 26 MILLION YEAR EXTINCTIONCYCLES ON THE EARTH?No, not on the basis of what we understand at the moment. I don't think so. AndNemesis and this brown dwarf are not mutually exclusive. You could still have aNemesis out there far out at aphelion and not be affecting the comets today andthen at some future date 13 million years from now, it could plow into the innerOort Cloud and do its thing. So, the two things are not exclusive. Just because Idon't think this Brown Dwarf is not Nemesis doesn't mean that there can't alsobe a Nemesis out there."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"BETWEEN 1984 AND 1999, WHAT HAS BEEN THE OUTLINE OFYOUR WORK TO DATE AND ARE YOU AT A POINT WHERE IT'SONLY A THEORETICAL MODEL? OR DO YOU HAVE ANY KIND OFHARD EVIDENCE NOW THAT WOULD SUGGEST THERE IS SOMEKIND OF ANOMALOUS PULL GRAVITATIONALLY IN THE OORTCLOUD?We do indeed have evidence which is the purpose of the paper we arepublishing. The nature of the evidence is the comets that we see coming into theinner solar system. We only see them when they come close to the sun and beginto evaporate. These comets come from far outside the planetary region of theSolar System. They come from a region called the Oort Cloud which is tens ofthousands times further from the sun than the earth and Pluto are. These cometscome in on very elongated orbits.Taking into account observational biases, one would expect comets when theycome in around the sun to be roughly uniform in their positions in space. So, ifyou plotted the closest point of the comet to the sun on a globe or sphere, thecomets should be uniformly distributed. In fact, comets are not uniformlydistributed.COULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW THE DISTRIBUTION OF THECOMETS IS UNUSUAL ENOUGH TO HAVE PROVOKED YOU ANDYOUR COLLEAGUES TO HAVE LABORED OVER THE ISSUE THEPAST TWENTY YEARS?It's best to visualize it by talking in terms of the comet aphelia - the furthestpoint from the sun. If their orbit goes around the sun, they have very elongatedorbits, not like the planets at all. So the ones that come into the solar systemcome from far out in the Oort Cloud, come in and go around the sun and goback again. If you put little points on a globe corresponding to the points in thesky of the comets aphelia, the furthest points from the sun, and you distributethem on a globe, you would expect them to be roughly uniform.Since we only have a finite number of comets, you don't expect it to be exactlyperfect and uniform. But you expect it to be statistically consistent withuniformity. There is a slight qualification there because the effect of the galaxycalled the \"galactic tide\" tends to have some effects on the distribution. But wetook that into account. In fact, that's one thing we did that our colleague inEngland, Dr. Murray, did not do. We took into account the galaxy's effect.Drawing depicting our solar system and Oort Cloudsurrounded by forces of galactic tide, courtesy NASA, 1999.When I say uniform in the sky, that's roughly true. The galaxy produces somenon-uniform distribution which we take into account. But after having taken thatinto account, the distribution in the sky is still anomalous. It's not what'spredicted. It's not what's expected. And so, what's different is that there is a bandin the sky that has more comets than you would expect. There is this great circleacross the globe, it's the band, and there are more comets in that band than you"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"would expect to occur on the basis of statistics. A lot more. In other words, ifyou threw darts at a globe and asked the question: How often would you havethat many comets lying in a band of 1/10th of the sky? And the answer issomething like one time in a hundred to one time in a thousand. Somewhere inthat range.In summary, there are 23 excess comets in this band, over and above what youwould expect. We're only analyzing 82 comets. So, out of 82 comets, about 23of them there are 23 more than you would have expected to lie in this band.THIS IS WHAT CAUGHT YOUR ATTENTION AND BROUGHT THISWORK TO THIS POINT?Exactly. And it caught my attention because of my previous history withNemesis. John Matese is the expert on the galactic tide. So, he was trying toexplain this in terms of the galactic tidal force - that's the effect of the rest of thegalaxy on comets. He was trying to explain this in terms of the galactic tidalforce and tried to do that. And I worked with him on it also. And it didn't work.Ultimately, we couldn't explain this band in the sky as being due to distantmatter in the galaxy. So, we were sort of driven to this new theory of a perturberat the edge of the solar system.You want to try all the conventional, known explanations first before you go tosomething that postulates something that's unknown. So, we did. We publishedseveral papers with other explanations that ultimately failed and we were sort ofdriven to this model that it could be explained by a brown dwarf in the outerOort Cloud, a massive object about three times the mass of Jupiter out in theOort Cloud at about 30,000 times further from the sun than earth is.IF THERE TRULY WERE A BODY THREE TIMES THE SIZE OFJUPITER OUT BEYOND PLUTO, WOULDN'T WE HAVE BEEN ABLETO DETECT THAT BY NOW WITH HUBBLE OR WITH SOMEOTHER TYPE OF INSTRUMENTATION?No, Hubble primarily observes in the visible part of the spectrum and nearinfrared. This object would only shine in infrared wavelengths longer thanHubble could see. In infrared, this object could probably be observed now.There are millions of sources out there in the infrared and you'd have to be ableto discriminate this particular object from millions of others out there. That canbe done, but it's not easy. It's brightness is not large. It's still extremely dim, evenin the infrared. That's the only hope of observing it, in the infrared and possiblyin the radio part of the spectrum.IT WOULD BE DIM BECAUSE WHY?Because it's so far away and because it doesn't shine. See, the planets in oursolar system shine because of reflected light from the sun. Jupiter, for example,is five astronomical units (A. U.) from the sun. An A. U. is the earth-sundistance (93 million miles). Jupiter is just five times further away from the sun.It's close enough that there's a lot of reflected light from Jupiter.The object we think is a brown dwarf would be 30,000 A.U. from the sun. So,even though it's somewhat larger than Jupiter - actually it's not larger thanJupiter. It's more massive than Jupiter, but for technical reasons, it's actuallysmaller in size. It doesn't emit light and reflects only an infinitesimal amount oflight back towards the earth. So, there is no hope of seeing it on the basis of itsreflected light from the sun like the other planets. A brown dwarf would besomething that's between Jupiter and a star in mass. It radiates heat, but is nothot enough to be in the visible light spectrum. It can only be detected on thebasis of infrared emission.WHEN YOU SAY THE MASS IS THREE TIMES THE MASS OFJUPITER, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MOLECULAR MATTERITSELF. BUT IF IT IS A BROWN DWARF, IT HAS COLLAPSED ONITSELF AND IS CONDENSED AND THEREFORE, THAT IS WHY IT ISSMALLER THAN JUPITER?That's true. It's technically it is said to be more 'degenerate' than Jupiter which"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"translates to it's more dense. If you added mass to Jupiter, for example, Jupiterwould get smaller in size.A BROWN DWARF, I UNDERSTAND. BUT IN TERMS OF THE PAPERYOU'RE GOING TO HAVE IN ICARUS, IT SEEMS LIKE WHATYOU'RE DESCRIBING IS INTERPRETATION OF SOME ANOMALIESNOTICED IN COMETS, BUT NO OBSERVATIONAL DATA ANDEVERYTHING IS STILL IN THE THEORETICAL REALM?That's exactly right. The evidence we have is the effect that the proposed browndwarf has on comets. This is the only explanation that we can think of toexplain these anomalous distributions of comets in the sky. It's always possiblethere could be some explanation that we haven't thought of, but we have spentseveral years working on it and have published several papers trying to explainthis, and ultimately they failed. The theories failed.So, it is something we're driven to. But it's indirect, you're correct. It's an indirectprediction or evidence for the existence of this theorized brown dwarf. It's verymuch analogous to the discovery of Neptune. Neptune was discovered in 1846by two independent mathematicians and astronomers on the basis of itsinfluence on the planet Uranus. So because Uranus wasn't acting according toNewton's Laws and wasn't quite where it should be when it should be, thescientists proposed that there was another planet out there that wasn't beingtaken into account and it explained the discrepancies in the motion of the planetUranus.So, what we're doing is analogous to that. We're seeing discrepancies not inanother planet, but in comets coming into the solar system discrepancies in thatthey are not uniform in the sky.YOUR HYPOTHESIS WOULD BE IF THIS BROWN DWARF IS AREALITY OUT THERE THAT IT WAS CONCEIVED AT THEBEGINNING OF THIS SOLAR SYSTEM ALONG WITH OUR SUN?That's what I think is the more likely scenario. It formed as a fragment of a cloudthat formed the solar system. In other words, it didn't form along with the otherplanets. It formed separately like a star. However, Dr. Murray in Englandbelieves that it formed in a different solar system and was ejected. That's knownto occur, that massive planets can be ejected from other solar systems. We seeother indications of that from the extra-solar planets that have been discoveredrecently.YOU MEAN THAT THERE WOULD BE PLANETS JUST WANDERINGAROUND IN DEEP SPACE?Oh, there are probably lots of massive planets wandering around in space, yeah.But the problem is capturing them. It's very difficult for the sun or any star tocapture an interstellar planet because dynamically the physics is such that it'svery improbable. It can happen, but it's very improbable. So, we prefer tobelieve that it formed with the sun and formed like a star and was just a failedstar companion. And we base this on the analogy with binary star systems. Thereare lots of wide binary star systems in which you have two stars and the secondstar is a less massive star and it is in some cases ten thousand or more A. U.separated from its other star. So we do have examples of this sort of thingoccurring with other star systems - wide binary star systems.IF IT WERE A WIDE BINARY STAR SYSTEM, ONE STAR SURVIVESWHICH IS OUR SUN. THE OTHER DIED AND WOULD BE THEBROWN DWARF?Right, the sun became a normal star and the other one fizzled because its massnever was great enough.FOR ALL OF THE 4 1/2 BILLION OR 5 BILLION YEAR AGE OF THESOLAR SYSTEM, THIS BROWN DWARF WOULD HAVE BEEN INTHIS ORBIT?No, it wouldn't have been in this same orbit the whole time. As a matter of fact,if it started in this orbit it probably would not have survived 4.5 billion years."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"So, it's more plausible that it started in an orbit that is closer in because the orbitover 4.5 billion years would be affected by other stars passing by and so itpresumably would have started in an orbit at one to ten thousand A. U.,initially, and it's been pumped up to its current orbit at 30,000 A. U. over 4.5billion years.That's the same way comets are. Comets started out closer into the solar systemin the planetary region and their orbits eventually got pumped out and detachedby stars and so on passing by. That's how they ended up in the Oort Cloud, Ithink.THE OORT CLOUD WOULD EXTEND OUT HOW FAR?Further than 30,000 A. U. The Oort Cloud extends out at least twice thatdistance.THE OORT CLOUD IS 60,000 A.U.?There is no well defined ending or border to it. It gradually disappears. Thereare comets out twice as far as our proposed brown dwarf, out to 60,000 A. U.Most of the comets we see come from the Oort Cloud.BRIAN MARSDEN AT THE HARVARD SMITHSONIAN CENTER FORASTROPHYSICS WAS ASKED TO COMMENT ON YOUR PAPER'SPROPOSED THEORY AND HE SAID, 'I AM QUITE A BITSKEPTICAL, BUT THERE MAY BE SOMETHING TO IT.' (ANOTHERSCIENTIST) SPECIALIZING IN PLANETARY DYNAMICS AT THELUNAR AND PLANETARY INSTITUTE IN HOUSTON, SAID: 'YOUDON'T HAVE ENOUGH NUMBERS OF COMETS TO FEELCOMFORTABLE THAT THIS IS REALLY CONVINCING EVIDENCE.'Well, that's a common observation. Everybody wants more data, including us.And if you're looking at something like this that is unknown, that's new, or youare proposing something that is new, almost by definition it's got to be marginal.Otherwise, it would already have been discovered. So, if the data were so goodlike he wants and like we want - if it was that good, this would have beendiscovered fifty years ago.So, you have to work with what you have. And I completely agree. They areskeptical as they should be. But it can always be a statistical fluke. Everythingwe see or try to explain could conceivably be just a freaky statistical accident.There might not be any physics behind it at all. That's always possible. But, wequote statistics that say the odds of that being true are something like 1:100 to1:1000.We presented what we think is a strong statistical case in our paper that will bepublished in Icarus. And we're not going to have people like Brian Marsden atHarvard 100% convinced by our argument. What we hope is that we make agood enough case that the infrared observers will go and look for this object.That's our objective. So if we make a strong enough case then people will go andlook for this brown dwarf. If it's there, we'll hopefully find it.IS AN INFRARED SEARCH GOING TO HAPPEN ANY TIME SOON?Yeah, I think the next generation of infrared telescopes in space will have thecapability of seeing it. There's an infrared telescope called SIRTF that is going tobe launched, I think, in two years that would easily be able to see this object.HAVE THEY AGREED WITH YOU OR TALKED WITH YOU ABOUTMAKING THIS ONE OF THEIR MISSIONS TO LOOK FOR THISBROWN DWARF?We haven't talked with anyone on the mission yet, no. But that's the purpose ofpublishing the paper. If they'll read the paper, they can decide for themselves asto whether it's worth their time to go look for this object. So, that's our goal tomake a good enough case that people will look.WHO AT NASA MAKES THOSE KIND OF DECISIONS?Well, the way it works there's a NASA science team which runs the experiments,is in charge of the satellites. They have certain priorities on their experiments."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"It's a competitive thing. NASA alone doesn't make the decision. It's scientists,universities. There are probably more scientists in universities that observe onthese telescopes than scientists at NASA.YOU'VE BEEN LIVING WITH THIS ISSUE FOR ABOUT 16 YEARS. IFYOU WERE A BETTING MAN, DO YOU THINK THE INFRAREDEXPLORATION OUT IN THE OORT CLOUD IS GOING TO TURNTHIS BROWN DWARF UP?Eventually if it's there, it will be discovered.WHAT DOES YOUR GUT TELL YOU?My gut tells me there's a better than 50/50 chance that it's there. I can't putbetter odds than that on it. All I can say is that we can't think of any otherexplanation of what we've observed in the comets.IF THE BROWN DWARF ISN'T THE NEMESIS OBJECT, WHAT ISCAUSING THE 26 MILLION CYCLIC EXTINCTIONS?That's a good question. That's an unanswered question. A lot of scientists, sincethere is not an answer, not an obvious mechanism, a lot of scientists have chosento believe that's a statistical fluke - that there really is no 26 million cycle andonly a coincidence. But there is no accepted theory now.I think John Matese has the best theory going now to explain that cycle ofextinction. It is a whole separate theory having to do with oscillation of the solarsystem through the galaxy. John published a seminal paper on that in Icarus ayear or two ago.THE OSCILLATION MEANS WHAT? AND WHAT DO WE GOTHROUGH THAT CAUSES THE DESTRUCTIVE PERIODS?The sun and the solar system as they go around the galaxy, the orbit is such thatall of it bobs up and down like a merry-go-round. And the bobbing period issomewhere around 60 million years. So every 30 million years, the sun passesthrough the plane of the galaxy. And when it does that, there is an effect of thegalactic tide - a tidal force that turns out to be important. The tidal force affectsthe comets in the Oort Cloud. It's like they get an impulse, they get a kick, everytime they go through the galactic plane. So that kick causes some of them tocome into the inner solar system that wouldn't come in otherwise. And so thenet result is that you get an increase of at least four times as many cometscoming into the inner solar system every 30 million years.THAT MEANS THERE ARE GREATER ODDS FOR ONE TO HIT THEEARTH?Exactly. There are greater odds for one to hit the earth.WHERE ARE WE IN THIS CYCLE RIGHT NOW?That's model dependent. In John's model, the sun is a few million years going upthrough the plane of the galaxy. So, in that model, the comets are alreadyheading inward. They haven't gotten here yet because it takes millions of yearsfor them to fall inward from the outer Oort Cloud. In other words, once they areperturbed in their orbits by the galactic tide, then it takes several millions ofyears to fall into the solar system. This would be in the future a couple millionyears, the best I understand it. And if there is an impact, the impact of a largecomet it would probably be from the comets in the outer Oort Cloud whichseem to be faster and have more energy than the local comets. And a largecomet impact would have a huge effect on earth. The best documented one, ofcourse, is the Cretaceous/Tertiary impact that occurred 65 million years ago thatlead to the end of the Cretaceous geological period and the beginning of theTertiary period. The impact wiped out dinosaurs and two-thirds of all species onthe earth. It's known as the 6th mass extinction event.IF THAT HAPPENED 65 MILLION YEARS AGO AND WE'RE INSOME 60 MILLION YEAR CYCLE, ARE WE FIVE MILLION YEARSPAST ANOTHER COSMIC CATASTROPHE?Even though there is a period there, it's not a precise period. This is all statistics.You're more likely to be hit by a big comet if there are more big ones coming"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"into the solar system. If coming in at increased rates for periods of millions ofyears, that just means you're probability is up over those several million previousyears. You can't narrow it down to the level that the earth is likely to be struckat a specific million year period.BUT WE WOULD BE AT THE END OF THE 60 MILLION YEARCYCLE NOW IN WHICH THE LIKELIHOOD WOULD BE THATWE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE COMETS?Yeah, the likelihood would be that there are going to be more comets coming.\"Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
