Until now, it's a virus that was only known ineastern and northern Africa and western Asia. Now CDC officials fear thedangerous virus could spread to Central and South America as birds migrate forthe winter season and fly south.How exactly this African and Asian bird virus got to the United States is notknown. It might have come in an illegal import of a bird from the other side ofthe world. But this encephalitis outbreak and the associated human deaths showthat when microbes are released into an environment where they have not beenbefore, the microbes can be especially dangerous because what they infect hasno immunity against them.Back in 1918, there was a world pandemic called \"the swine flu\" which killedan estimated twenty million people worldwide and more than half a millionpeople in the United States. The reason was that a virus crossed over into pigsand then transferred into people who had no immunity. Could anotherpandemic occur? Some scientists worry that melting ice at the poles and glacierscould unleash microbes trapped for years, centuries even, that are stillinfectious.That question is especially relevant since researchers at the State University ofNew York in Syracuse have already discovered for the first time an ancient virus,bacteria and fungi frozen in Arctic ice. Reporting in a recent volume of PolarBiology (Vol. 22, Page 207) plant pathologists Scott Rogers and John Castellodescribed their examination of four ice cores ranging in age from 500 to 140,000years old at three sites in Greenland. They found 15 strains of a common plantpathogen, tomato mosaic tobamovirus (ToMV) and the frozen viruses areprobably still infectious. The scientists have also been able to grow bacteria andfungi from frozen ice specimens shown below."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Culture of an unidentified bacterium from Greenland ice core at a depth of 134 meters.That depth of the ice core corresponds to an age of approximately 500 years old, or about1500 A.D.

Since the fungi and bacteria have been able to come back from theice, I asked him about the viability of the tomato mosaic virus.Interviews:1) John Castello, Ph.D., Prof. of Plant Virology, College of EnvironmentalScience and Forestry, State University of New York, Syracuse, New York:\"This is the first time to my knowledge that anybody has detected a viral nucleicacid in anything, any sample, this old. So, it raises the possibilities that there areliving viruses there, infectious viruses, and that's what we're trying to test.COULD THE ICE MELTING CYCLE INTO THE OCEANS AND ON TOLAND EXPLAIN POSSIBLY SOME OF THE EPIDEMICS THAT HAVEBEEN CYCLIC?Exactly. That's what we're looking at in the long range. That's exactly right. So,what we need to do - and we now have a National Science Foundation grant toexpand our work is to look for viruses that could infect humans or animals thatmight be trapped in ice. So, that work now is beginning and we've got additionalice not only from Greenland but from Antarctica as well. And we will besearching it for some likely candidate human viruses that would be present inthis ice. And some of them that are likely candidates for preservation in icewould include some of the human pathogens that are water borne and are verystable. And some of these would include influenza virus, polio virus, some ofthe human enteroviruses like Echovirus (enteric cytopathic orphan) andCoxsackie viruses which cause gastroenteritis in people and in animals. So, theseare some of the things we're going to be looking for.HAS ANYONE RAISED THE PROJECTION THAT IF WE AREMOVING INTO A TIME OF INCREASING GLOBAL TEMPERATURESWITH ACCELERATED RATES OF MELTING - BOTH IN THE NORTHAND SOUTH POLES AND GLACIERS - THAT WE COULD END UPWITH AN INCREASED AMOUNT OF PATHOGENS IN THE OCEANWATERS WHICH COULD POSSIBLY CAUSE MORE EPIDEMICS INTHE FUTURE?Yeah, every reporter has been wanting me to say that. But to be honest with you,I think you've got to recognize that glaciers have been melting and calving andablating in other words, wearing down for millennia. This isn't something new.This global warming is not going to create a catastrophic melt of glaciers at least,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I don't think so. Because these glaciers have been they build up and they melt,and they build up and they melt every year. So, whatever microorganisms areentrapped in this ice are probably continually being recycled into the modernenvironment and I don't think the process that I've just described is new to the20th Century. So, whatever is in there is already being re-circulated.So, maybe again, I'm speculating maybe when we have these outbreaks ofplagues like the influenza outbreak of 1918-1919.THE SWINE FLU.Right. Maybe that was caused by some ancient flu virus that was trapped in iceand released by some melting event at that point in time. Who knows? We don'tknow that kind of event hasn't already occurred. You see what I mean?IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEENCURRENT HUMANS WHICH HOMO SAPIENS SAPIENSCRO-MAGNON HAS ONLY BEEN IN THIS CURRENT FORM FORABOUT 35,000 YEARS. AND VIRUSES, BACTERIA AND MICROBESTHAT MIGHT BE 100,000 YEARS OLD - IF THEY WERE RELEASEDINTO THE OCEANS AND MADE IT TO LAND - COULD DECIMATETHE HUMAN POPULATION?Well, if some organism like a flu virus that co-evolved with man thousands ofyears ago has since become frozen in ice and been entombed there in a kindstate of suspended animation if that virus were to be released, say 100,000 yearslater, when presumably there wouldn't be any immunity to that particular strainof the virus any longer in the human population I supposed it's conceivable thatif that virus were to infect a human, it could spread and could cause a disease.But I hate like hell to go out on a limb like that and say that this is going tohappen. I just don't know. I really don't know.BUT IT MIGHT BE THE EXPLANATION FOR WHY THERE HASBEEN SOME OF THESE CYCLIC EPIDEMICS LIKE THE SWINE FLUTHAT HAVE TRULY GONE THROUGH POPULATIONS...And then disappeared. Yeah, well, the influenza virus is one of those viruses thatwe don't know precisely where it goes when it's not epidemic. When the virus isnot causing an epidemic, where does it go? For example, the outbreak of flu in1957 caused a pandemic and then the damn thing disappeared for almost twentyyears and reappeared in 1977 twenty years later!THAT WAS THAT HONG KONG FLU VIRUS?Yeah. So, where was it for twenty years? Where was it hiding? Was it in ducks?Was it in lake sediments? Could it have been in ice? There are some questionslike that which perhaps could be explained by some of our findings if indeedthere are other viruses trapped in ice. That's why we're looking.IF ALL THE ILLNESS IS ON LAND HOW DO THE VIRUSES GETFROM DEAD HOSTS BACK INTO THE OCEAN SYSTEM?Through sewage. You can pass these things out, OK? They can be passed andtravel through a sewage treatment system into the soil into the water into thestreams into the oceans.Calicivirus Transfers from Oceans Into Land AnimalsANOTHER MYSTERY THAT DR. CASTELLO'S AND HIS COLLEAGUES'RESEARCH MIGHT SOLVE IS THE TWENTY YEAR CYCLE OFCALICIVIRUSES THAT ORIGINATE IN THE OCEANS, CAN MAKEMARINE ANIMALS SICK AND HAVE TRANSFERRED ON TO LAND INTOPIGS, AND POSSIBLY INTO HUMANS. ONE OF THE WORLD'S EXPERTON CALICIVIRUSES IS DOCTOR OF VETERINARY MEDICINE, ALVINSMITH. HE IS HEAD OF THE LABORATORY FOR CALICIVIRUS STUDIESIN THE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE AT OREGON STATEUNIVERSITY INCORVALLIS. DR. SMITH THINKS THIS NEW RESEARCH INTO"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"MICROBES LOCKED UP IN POLAR AND GLACIAL ICE COULD EXPLAINSOME SUDDEN EPIDEMICS.2) Alvin W. Smith, D.V.M., Head Of The Laboratory for CalicivirusStudies, College Of Veterinary Medicine, Oregon State University,Corvallis, Oregon:\"The very first viruses ever isolated out of any seal species turned out to becaliciviruses. And this was in 1972. And it turned out that these were veryimportant viruses because they were the ones that had caused outbreaks of avery serious disease in pigs in 1932. And the origins of that outbreak were neverknown. Well, people were feeding fish scraps and stuff to swine before 1932,but this thing hit with a vengeance in pigs. Where did it come from? Somethingwas very different.Now, I'm here to tell you that the avenues are still open from these viruses in theocean to land animals and there is some transmission going on, but you're notseeing the same vesicular disease that was seen way back then. So, some of thatcan be attributable to mutation, but when you seem to get repeatedintroductions and it's quite different I've wondered about it a lot. What's goingon here?Some of the work we have done, we saw evidence of viruses that had beenisolated on the Atlantic coast in 1956 and only there once. We saw evidence ofthose viruses some 20 years later among California sea lions on the Pacific Coastand then had opportunity to look at some Bullhead Whale materials fromAlaska about ten years later than that in the mid-1980s and lo and behold, herewas type specific antibody again for this virus.So, my thoughts are that this thing really moves around. But how does it movearound? And the idea that these might be locked in ice and the ice melts andthen begins moving through the ocean reservoirs becomes very attractive. And inthat way, you could get a sero type that had been sequestered away or hidingout for very, very long periods of time and re-emerging. We preserve viruses byfreezing them. That's how it's done. (Viruses are easily killed by heat andexposure to UV light).This ice research pumps new life into the idea of the oceans as reservoirs foragents that we have to pay some attention to. And that of course hits very closeto my work because I have been isolating these things from ocean communitiesnow for 25 years or so, these caliciviruses. And tracking them and seeing who isinfected and who isn't and sticking them into various species and see what theydo. How do you get this stuff out of the ocean to somewhere else?Some known ways are if you have a bubble rising through the water say amillimeter in diameter - it will scour the particulates out of a column of waterthat's a millimeter in diameter for however deep that column is. When it hits thesurface, this will project a droplet 15 centimeters into the air. Suddenly youhave an airborne particulate that can go with prevailing winds and go wherever itwants to. That's one mechanism. That makes real sense if you hold your handover a glass that's got an Alka-Seltzer in it. All of a sudden you have a wet handjust from the droplets projected by these bubbles rising to the surface and thebubble pops and projects a droplet.Then you've got things like marine mammals that breed on land but live in thewater. So, you have the land and sea interface broken by those critters all thetime. Then you've got fish that go to sea and spend several years there and thenrun up the streams for a hundred or thousand miles, sometimes from way out inthe Pacific clear on up into the Rocky Mountain headwaters in Idaho like forsome of the steelhead and salmon. Carrying with them whatever microbes werethere.Then the bears and everything else eat those after they die from spawning andwhat have you. So, there's lots of mechanisms, plus the fact that we eat fish andthrow the brains and viscera into the garbage or feed it to the dogs or hogs or"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"whatever people do with it so there are ways of moving this stuff (viruses)inland. And once a new species becomes exposed, then the virus they shed is alittle more adapted to that particular species. The virus that secondarily-exposedpeople shed is even more adaptive and all of sudden, you've got an epidemic.\"More Information:The panel of the National Science Foundation that funded the Syracuse ice coreinvestigation is called LEXEN. LEXEN is an acronym that stands for Life InExtreme ENvironments. The long-range objective of LEXEN is to try to developprotocols to search for simple life forms in very harsh environments here on theearth. And ice is only one of those environments. Other harsh environmentswould include deserts and hot springs and salt marshes. Couldn't the sameprotocols be used to search for life on other planets? Castello thinks so. Hepoints out that ice has been discovered on the moon and on Mars and now iceon the Jovian moon, Europa. So ice might be where we first find other life formsoutside the earth. So far, NASA has not contacted the Syracuse researchers, butCastello hopes they will in the future.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
