So, like acanary in a miner's cage that will die before the miner does if the air is bad,frogs, toads and salamanders are signaling that something is wrong in our world.The problem was first noticed in 1995 when school children in Minnesota founddeformed frogs. Some were missing a leg, some had withered arms, others hadshrunken eyes or none at all. One had nine legs and another had three eyes, onein the back of its throat.By the fall of 1996, the problem had spread to Wisconsin, South Dakota,Vermont, Missouri, Colorado, California, Oregon, Canada and Japan and by1997, deformed amphibians found all over the United States were reported innational newscasts.Theories about what might be happening included chemical pollutants - whichno one had found - and trematode parasites which might be taking advantage ofweakened immune systems among amphibians, perhaps related to the stress ofincreased UV light due to the thinning ozone layer.Finally, hard data did link increased UV exposure to amphibian deformities. Dr.Andrew Blaustein, Professor of Zoology at Oregon State University in Corvallishad his ultraviolet research published in the Proceedings of the NationalAcademy of Sciences on December 9, 1997. (Proceedings of the NationalAcademy of Sciences, Vol. 94, Pages 13735-13737, December 1997, \"AmbientUV-B Radiation Causes Deformities In Amphibian Embryos,\" by Andrew R.Blaustein, Ph.D. (c) 1997 National Academy of Sciences.)In a radio interview, Dr. Blaustein explained to me that he placed long-toedsalamander eggs in test and control enclosures on lakes and ponds in the OregonCascade Mountain Range, which is their natural habitat. He told me: \"Bothenclosures are exactly the same. They both have shields and they both are"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"subjected to the same temperatures, same water, same everything, except one ofthe shields lets UV in and one does not.\"What happened stunned Dr. Blaustein. 85% of the embryos in the eggs exposedto the sun's UV rays died. In the remaining fifteen percent that hatched, all butfour had skeletal deformities and eye problems. In the eggs shielded fromultraviolet sun rays, 98% hatched and all were normal.Dr. Blaustein said: \"We haven't seen mortality like we're seeing now and we havedata that goes back to the 1950's. So, what I'm led to believe is that anenvironmental change has occurred and is probably ozone depletion. Some ofour best data already show that UV is killing plankton under the ozone holes.And there is even a study that shows fish are impacted at certain stages byultraviolet rays in the Antarctic. I think we have a significant problem here!\"Then in the April 30, 1999 journal Science, two studies were publishedconcluding that defects found in frogs throughout the Western United Statesmight be caused by a trematode - a simple parasitic flatworm. The flatworm hasa complex life cycle that includes infecting developing legs of tadpoles.Stanley K. Sessions of Hartwick College in New York, who co-authored one ofthe Science studies said, \"Every single frog I have looked at with extra legs - andI have looked at hundreds - all have these cysts around the deformity.\"Media, including the Wall Street Journal, reported that parasites were theanswer to the amphibian deformity and decline problems, but the issue is farmore complex. The following are excerpts from an interview on May 26, 1999with Prof. Andrew Blaustein, Dept. of Zoology, Oregon State University,Corvallis, Oregon. He was a scientific reviewer of both papers in Science inwhich his research perspectives were also quoted.Interview:Andrew Blaustein, Ph.D., Professor of Zoology, Oregon State University,Corvallis, Oregon: \"There's confusion now about two totally differentphenomena which may or may not be related. The one phenomenon is thewhole amphibian decline situation where amphibians around the world aredisappearing at rates that are very alarming to many scientists. The otherphenomenon which is probably NOT closely related is the amphibian deformityissue where animals are being seen with multiple legs, multiple eyes, deformedbodies, things like that. Those are probably not closely related to one anotherand the press and part of the media and even some of the scientists have putthese two phenomena together erroneously.So, the amphibian decline problem. As many of you know out there, amphibiansare declining around the world at increasing rates. It's part of an overall problemin biodiversity. We're losing our biodiversity such as many of the living speciesof microorganisms, plants and animals. And amphibians are part of thisbiodiversity crisis. And the fact is that there are many things that are causingamphibian population decline. There are many agents out there. Amphibians arebeing insulted by a number of things.One is ultraviolet radiation. One is pollution. One is introduced exotic species.And there are pathogens involved also. It's obviously clear that there are someglobal climate changes and associated atmospheric changes that are contributingto some of the mortality we are seeing in amphibians in the field. Some of theseglobal climate changes and some of the atmospheric changes actually cause theimmune systems of amphibians to diminish and allows them to get diseases moreeasily."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WHICH COULD EVEN INCLUDE THE ASSAULT OF PARASITES?Well, that's a question that everyone is looking at, including myself. And it'spossible that these global climate changes are causing immune systems to allowparasites and other pathogenic entities to enter their bodies.Now, let's talk about the amphibian deformity issue. In my opinion, some of thebest work on what is causing amphibian deformity has to do with two studiesthat came out in the April 30th issue of Science which is the most prestigiousscientific journal in the world. And it had to do with parasites as a cause forcausing multiple legged frogs. We found them even where I live in Oregon allover the place. And it looks like these parasites CAN cause these multiplelegged frogs. But it's not the only cause and it certainly has no bearing on what'smaking the parasites more prevalent. The parasites have been here at least aslong as amphibians, yet all of a sudden, they are getting into the amphibiansmore easily? Well, we have to figure out why. We think there are someenvironmental changes that are occurred that are allowing these parasites toenter the amphibians more easily.As a matter of fact, I reviewed both those papers for Science as a reviewer and Ithought they were good papers. But it was just one part of the story and it's beendistorted. (The media's) thrust is, 'OK, we found a natural cause of parasites thatcauses these multiple legged frogs. Let's stop worrying about chemicals andultraviolet rays and ozone depletion.' If we stop worrying about that, we're introuble!BECAUSE FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW, THEY ARE AT THE ROOTOF WHAT WOULD BE MAKING THE AMPHIBIANS SUSCEPTIBLETO THE PARASITES IN THE FIRST PLACE.I think the potential is there that there is some environmental damage orenvironmental change that occurred and it's possibly fertilizer runoff which isnot natural. It's possibly a pollutant from another source. Or, UV radiation. AndI think that is probably making these animals more susceptible to parasites atthis point. They are not going to explain some other incredibly damaging thingsthat have occurred and I didn't talk to you about this, I don't think. But in theCascade Mountains in Oregon, we published a paper in late 1998, December,showing that frogs that are basking in the sunlight have retinas that are totallydestroyed by ultraviolet rays. They are just sitting out there. The UV rays hittheir eyes and it destroys their retinas. Now, the implications to humans thereare great. If the frogs that are basking out there are having their eyes damaged,humans that sun bathe and don't use sunglasses and are out there all the timecan have the same damage.IS OREGON THE FIRST PLACE IN THE UNITED STATES WHEREYOU'VE CONFIRMED RETINAL DAMAGE FROM UV RADIATION?At this point, it's the only place I know of. The only paper that's published thatshows there is retinal damage in the frog or maybe even in any vertebrate - Ithink we are the only ones who have shown it right now. It's pretty confirmed.I think it is one of the most alarming things that can be totally related to whatcan happen in humans. We know that UV rays can cause immune systemdysfunction and causes cataracts in humans. And obviously, if you have retinaldamage in a frog, the implication is there for many other vertebrates, includinghumans.\"More Information:Below are three photographs of retinal damage in frogs labeled A, B and C.A = is a transverse section from the retina of a spotted frog that was notsubjected to UV radiation."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"B = Retinal section of a spotted frog that has light damage.
