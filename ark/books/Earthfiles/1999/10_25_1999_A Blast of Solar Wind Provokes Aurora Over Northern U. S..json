Three days later on October 21st, theflare's shock front of charged particles had rippled through space for 93 millionmiles and struck earth's magnetosphere. The collision of electrons and protonswith upper atmospheric molecules created a dramatic glow called auroraborealis or Northern Lights. The magnetic storm was strong over Hudson Bay,the Great Lakes and as far south as Ohio.By October 22, NASA's Ultraviolet Imager on a polar spacecraft captureddramatic images of the earth's magnetic field interacting with the solar wind.Frequently, when viewed from space, a complete aurora will appear as a circlearound one of the earth's magnetic poles. This recent October display was moreconcentrated in a band along the northern United States.Image by the Ultraviolet Imager on NASA's Polar spacecraft showing UVemissions from aurora borealis during a strong geomagnetic storm, October 22, 1999.Courtesy NOAA Space Environment Center, Suitland, Maryland.As the sun becomes increasingly active and explosive in its eleven year cyclewhich is expected to reach maximum activity around June to July 2000, therewill be more geomagnetic storms on earth and more aurora borealis, like thebeautiful photograph taken by Dick Hutchinson in January 1998 above a frozenlandscape of snow-covered spruce trees in Alaska."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Photograph of aurora borealis above a frozen landscape of snow-covered spruce trees inAlaska© January 1998 by Dick Hutchinson.NASA reports that \"in late September, a continuing series of minor to moderategeomagnetic storms have triggered aurorae along the northern tier of U.S statesand may have affected some public power systems operating at high northernlatitudes. These events were caused by high-speed material streaming out fromareas on the sun known as coronal holes.\" Space weather forecasters expectmoderate levels of aurorae, shortwave radio disruptions, and power gridfluctuations at high latitudes to become more common as the solar cycle reachesmaximum.X-ray image of the sun by Japanese Yohkoh X-ray Observatory,October 12, 1999 shows coronal hole that rotated to send high-speed solar wind particlestoward Earth and created the October 22 aurorae over northern U. S.Courtesy NASA Marshall Space Flight Center.On September. 14 1999, the space-based SOHO observatory photographed ahuge eruptive prominence escaping the Sun, seen in the upper right corner of theimage. Prominences are loops of magnetic fields with hot gas trapped inside.Sometimes, as the fields become unstable, the prominence will erupt as this onedid and become part of a coronal mass ejection."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"September 14, 1999 SOHO Observatory photocourtesy of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center.NASA says further, \"The recent increase in geomagnetic activity offers a taste ofthings to come as the sun approaches the maximum of its 11-year sunspot cycle.As sunspot numbers mount, coronal mass ejections and solar wind disturbanceswill trigger more and more geomagnetic storms. In extreme cases, these stormscan induce electric currents in the earth and oceans that interfere with electricpower transmission equipment.Graph courtesy of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, October 1999.\"The extra ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray radiation created by magnetic fieldsaround sunspots also cause the earth's atmosphere to heat up and expand. Thiscreates added drag in the area where low-earth orbit satellites and the SpaceShuttle orbit. Solar flares and energetic particle events further complicatematters by interrupting satellite and shortwave radio communications.\"It's not all bad news, though. The increased levels of solar activity will likelytrigger dazzling auroral displays at mid-latitudes. Sky watchers in thecontinental U. S. will be treated to sights normally reserved for residents ofhigher latitudes. Another piece of good news is that increased atmospheric dragat solar maximum acts as a scavenger and helps clean out space debris fromlow-earth orbit.\" We b s it e s :http://science.nasa.gov/http://www.ptialaska.net/~hutch/aurora.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
