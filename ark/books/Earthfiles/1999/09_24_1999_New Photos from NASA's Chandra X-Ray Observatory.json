One surprising image is in the SmallMagellanic Cloud, a galaxy 190,000 light years from earth. It's the aftermath of asupernova, a sun that blew itself apart, which looks like a wheel with spokes.The \"wheel\" is forty light years in diameter.Chandra X-Ray Observatory photograph of supernova remnant in the Small MagellanicCloud galaxy 190,000 light years from earth, released by NASA on September 20, 1999.Chandra is photographing in x-ray frequencies that are showing details neverobserved before. For example, the photograph below clearly shows a neutronstar known as a pulsar at the center of an ancient supernova explosion. Thispulsar rotates very rapidly, making a complete rotation every one-twentieth of asecond and is surrounded by an enormous shell of debris from the star's originalexplosion."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Chandra X-Ray Observatory photograph of neutron star, or pulsar, which rotatesevery one-twentieth of a second, released by NASA on September 20, 1999.Another supernova remnant is seen through a large, round patch of debris.NASA says that \"detailed observations with radio telescopes confirm that inthese supernova remnants the radio waves are produced by high energy electronsspiraling around magnetic field lines. The x-rays are probably produced by thesame process, but the electrons involved have energies many thousands timeshigher than those that produce the radio waves.\"Chandra X-Ray Observatory photograph of supernova explosionreleased by NASA on September 20, 1999.One of the most intensely studied objects beyond our solar system is theremnant of a star that humans on earth actually saw explode in 1054 A. D.Chinese astronomers that year reported a \"guest star\" that appeared suddenlyand remained visible for weeks, even during daytime. The nebula is located6,000 light years from Earth in the constellation Taurus. The Crab pulsar at itscenter is a rapidly spinning neutron star left behind after the supernova. WhenNASA's Chandra X-Ray Observatory was aimed at the Crab Nebula, itphotographed something never seen before: a clearly defined ring around thecentral neutron pulsar star that blew up almost a thousand years ago."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory reveals a ring around the rapidly spinningneutron star at the center, the remnant of a supernova explosion in 1054 A. D.Image by NASA/CXC/SAO, released September 28, 1999.It is theorized that neutron stars are formed in a few seconds before a supernovaexplosion when gravity crushes the central core of the star to densities 50trillion times that of lead and to a sudden small diameter of only about twelvemiles. The consequence of the dramatic collapse is that neutron stars spinrapidly and are highly magnetized. The Crab Nebula pulsar rotates thirty timesper second, a huge \"generator\" with a rotating magnet that generates tenquadrillion volts of electricity. That's thirty million times more than a typicall igh t n in g b o l t .The tilted rings are waves of high-energy particles that appear to have been flungoutward over the distance of a light year from the central pulsar. Further, thereare jets of high energy particles sweeping above and below the pulsarperpendicular to the ring. Astronomers are applauding these extraordinarydetails Chandra is providing.Professor Jeff Hester at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona said, \"(Thering) should tell us a lot about how the energy from the pulsar gets into thenebula. It's like finding the transmission lines between the power plant and thelight bulb.\"What is happening between the ring and pulsar? Dr. Martin Weisskopf, ChandraProject Scientist from NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville,Alabama, says \"The Crab pulsar is accelerating particles up to the speed of lightand flinging them out into interstellar space at an incredible rate.\"We b s it e s :http://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/ast21sep99_2.htmCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
