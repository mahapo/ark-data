Similar to formations back in 1990 to1991, there were rune-like glyphs attached to circles and rings connected bycorridors. You can see these early April photographs at pilot Busty Taylor's website listed here: www.aviation-uk.com/cropper/99apr2.htmThen on May 2, 1999, at Middle Wallop in Central Hampshire, a new glyphappeared in the yellow-flowered, crisp-stemmed canola which everyoneinterpreted to be an astronomical eclipse sequence. And by late May, a dramaticHebrew Menorah was discovered with a nearby smaller formation in wheatfields near Barbury Castle north of Avebury. Another formation-- the first inbarley-- resembled an egg and sperm, but with a peculiar variation.Today I talked by phone with cameraman Peter Sorensen now based near AltonBarnes, Wiltshire. Peter has been photographing crop formations in England formost of the 1990's. He and others are frustrated by a U.K. governmentcrackdown on commercial versus individual pilot photo shoots which is makingdocumentation of the crop circles more difficult this year. First I asked him whathe considers to be the top three formations so far in 1999.Interview:Peter Sorensen, Crop Formation Photographer, Alton Barnes, Wiltshire,England: \"There's no question at this point that, in my opinion, the best onesare the Menorah-- and I've seen it from the air and from the ground. Gorgeousflow-- like a water flow on the ground in the Menorah. And the little beetle thatis near to it is also a fabulous little formation. And the crescents down atPenton.THE CRESCENTS ARE THE NESTED CRESCENTS LIKE PREVIOUSYEARS?Right. Gorgeous from the ground and from the air! I've seen it both ways. And Iwould like to add to that as my favorite for this summer the eclipse sequence atMiddle Wallop. Although I haven't seen it from the ground, I've seen it from theair-- it's 800 bloody feet long! It's just about as long as any formation we've everhad. And it's perfect. And I want to point out to those of your friends who canlook at the internet and see the pictures-- that the centers of the standing crop,the circles that are (made) in standing crop are away from the tramline. If you'regoing to fake a crop circle, you have to stand in the middle of a circle and thenthrow a circle around while a guy runs around with a piece of string, right?These centers are in standing crop. Nobody was standing there!I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. CENTERS OF STANDING CROP."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Right. You would have to stand in the middle of the crop in order to make thatcircle for each one that goes through the sequence (of the eclipse). Andobviously nobody ever stood there (in each of those circle centers where thecrop is standing not down).YEAH, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER OF ANY DOWNEDCROP AT THE MIDDLE OF ANY OF THOSE SEQUENCES IN THEECLIPSE.That's right. Exactly.WHAT ABOUT IN WILTSHIRE-- IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE AREPRESENTATION OF AN EGG SURROUNDED BY SPERMSURROUNDED BY A CIRCLE SURROUNDED BY A SERIES OFCIRCLES.If those are egg and sperm-- the sperm are fleeing from the egg, pointing in thewrong direction! Having said that, it's the first formation in barley and the flowon the ground was absolutely gorgeous. It was just as beautiful as you couldpossibly imagine. It was just like the water effect. It looks like water had beenflowing through a stream.RIGHT. WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE MENORAH?The Menorah is without question a Menorah, the candlesticks the Hebrews useduring their spiritual celebrations and by God, the spiritual aspects of thisphenomenon of all these years has touched on many different religions. This isnot the first time that Judaism has been saluted by the phenomenon. And herewe have an absolutely spectacular, magnificent and huge formation in the samefield, by the way-- my dear Linda, this is the same field where the Tree of Life,exactly the same.THE KABALA FROM TWO YEARS AGO (1997).The Kabala, yes-- that formation was one of the most important ones that we'vehad, certainly in that year. And here we have a follow up - very interestingindeed.HOW FAR IS THIS FIELD FROM DOWNTOWN ALTON BARNES?Well a good fifteen or twenty miles away.FIFTEEN TO TWENTY. BUT THIS IS IN THE SAME FIELD AS THEFAMOUS BARBURY CASTLE FORMATION?This Menorah formation is in the same field as the Tree of Life formation-- theother Judaic Kabala formation we had two years ago. But it is about one-halfmile or one-quarter mile from the field where the original Barbury Castletriangle was in.IT''S IN THE GENERAL AREA, BUT NOT SPECIFICALLY THE SAMEFIELD AS THE VERY CLASSIC 1991 TRIANGLE WITH THECIRCULAR PATTERNS AT THOSE THREE CORNERS.Yeah. That magnificent-- perhaps the greatest of all formations in my opinion--that was about three-quarters of a mile to the west of where this one is right now(Menorah).And then not far away is somehow positioned in the same field something thatlooks like a beetle or a bug with pinchers in the front which reminds us of the1994 formations that showed the spider and the other bugs we had that year, thescorpions and such. Very similar in flavor to that. Almost as if two entities hadworked in the field simultaneously because they both appeared on the same"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"morning. And yet, their flavor is so different, their feeling is so different, butthey were in the same field.WERE THEY BOTH DISCOVERED AT THE SAME TIME? OR WASONE THERE AND THEN THE OTHER DISCOVERED?I think they were both discovered at the same time. There was no report theprevious day and then the next morning, they were both there.THIS FORMATION THAT IS IN THE SAME FIELD AND NOT FARFROM THE MENORAH, IT DOES HAVE THAT BEETLEPINCER-LIKE LOOK. BUT IT COULD ALSO BE ARGUED THAT ITHAS ALMOST AN ECLIPSE ASTRONOMY NATURE TO IT. HASANYONE DISCUSSED THAT?Well, you're right. No, I haven't heard anybody else say that, but it's true thatthese jaws, these pincers, form a complete circle unlike the spider and thescorpions of 1994 where the jaws were obviously open. In this case, there is acomplete circle closing - the tips of the jaws are touching-- and you also have acircle inside of a larger circle which does suggest the eclipse and we've had othereclipse formations already this year.IN THIS YEAR WHERE ON AUGUST 11TH, 1999 WILL BE THE LASTTOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE FOR ANOTHER 79 YEARS IN EUROPE-- ITIS INTRIGUING THAT THERE HAVE BEEN THESE SERIES OFWHAT APPEAR TO BE ECLIPSE-LIKE FORMATIONS. HAVEPEOPLE ARGUED THAT IT MUST BE HUMAN BECAUSE THEECLIPSE IS COMING IN AUGUST?Oh, God, the idiots argue both sides of this situation! Of course, it could behuman. But then exactly for the same reasons, beings from who knows where?!--would use the same symbols. It's to wake us up.DOESN'T IT WONDER WHAT WILL BE SIGNIFICANT AROUNDTHIS AUGUST 11TH, 1999 SOLAR ECLIPSE IN EUROPE?Oh, boy, I can't wait. It's going to be wonderful here. Absolutely-- it's going tobe the enlightenment-- perhaps some of the key information coming through tohumanity will be arriving in these fields just at that same time.I AM LOOKING AT A PHOTOGRAPH OF WHAT APPEARS TO BE ASYMBOLIC REPRESENTATION THAN NONE OTHER THAN THEPROGRESSION OF AN ECLIPSE. HAVE YOU BEEN IN THAT ONE?I've flown over that one-- yeah. That formation is down near Middle Wallopclose to Andover. It's a funny story. Busty (Taylor, pilot and photographer) wasvery reluctant to go into this area because right now the pressure is so powerfulfrom the government to keep people from flying over the crop circles. It's a longstory. But we flew over this formation and Busty would not even stop. Hewould not do the usual circles like we do orbits around the formations. We flewby as if we were not interested in it at all and I just had to keep my camera goingthe whole time and get a picture of that formation. Yes, this one is certainlyrepresenting the progression of an eclipse from the first touch of the moon overthe sun until it is completely covered and then you have a corona at the lastshot.HAS ANYBODY IN ENGLAND CLAIMED TO HAVE MADE THIS?No.WHAT IS THE STORY BEHIND THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENTPRESSURE ABOUT NOT FLYING OVER CROP FORMATIONS?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The English government-- actually their Federal Aviation Administration--whatever they call that-- has a very strict rule about differences between acommercial pilot and a private pilot. Now, all my life over here-- all these yearsI've been here-- I've been flying with private pilots. However, technicallyspeaking, if you take a photograph and sell it, it becomes a commercialenterprise. So, suddenly-- or at least last summer-- the government decided tocrack down on these private pilots who have been flying us because we sellsome pictures. It has thrown a tremendous big bucket of cold water on thewhole situation and now it's extremely difficult for us to fly. The commercialpilots will charge five times as much money to go up in the plane and basicallythat is forbidding. I'm stretching my budget to the last penny, especially thissummer to try to get out here and get these pictures. And suddenly, I'm forced tofly basically by helicopters-- 500 pounds-- that's almost $1,000 an hour-- on acommercial helicopter. I've done that already this summer. I tell you, you getbeautiful results with a helicopter, but ...TO COVER A WHOLE SUMMER DOING THAT AT A $1,000 A SHOT ..It's impossible. No, it can't be done.IT ALMOST MAKES ME WONDER IF IT IS CALCULATED BECAUSEPOLITICAL PRESSURES WOULD KNOW THAT PEOPLE TAKINGTHE CROP FORMATIONS SERIOUSLY AND TRYING TODOCUMENT THEM ALL CANNOT AFFORD THESE KINDS OFAERIAL FLIGHT PRICES. SO, DOESN'T THAT MEAN THAT THEEND RESULT IS THAT FEWER AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS WOULD BETAK E N ?No question at all. Several other photographers that I know-- people who livehere in England and who have been doing it-- are cutting back drastically.Drastically. Steve Alexander, Lucy Pringle-- these photographers who do a greatjob are now doing at least less than one-third what they would have done lastyear at this time because of this government crack down.WHAT HAS HAPPENED THIS LAST WEEK THESE FIRST SEVENDAYS OF JUNE?Virtually nothing. It's been a big hush-- after the Menorah and nested crescentsformation-- nothing! We're all sitting here on pins and needles saying, 'Come on,now!' What's going to happen next? The weather has been, to be honest, prettylousy. Very few moments of bright sunshine. Only one or two days where therehas been no rain. So, there has not been a lot of opportunity for whateverentities want to get out there and do their work. So, after the Menorah and thenested crescents-- that's been about it. Nothing new.SO WE'RE IN A LULL AND SOME OF US HAVE SAID IN THE PASTSOMETIMES THESE LULLS SEEM TO COME LIKE THE HUSH ATTHE EYE OF A STORM BEFORE THE RUSH OF NEW FORMATIONS.That's right. At a moment, we're in a gap. And we're all looking around to seewhat happens next.\"More Information:Peter Sorensen continues to find what he calls \"magically bent stalks\" in theformations that flow like water, bending flat to the ground with no cracks orcreases. Biophysicist W. C. Levengood is convinced from his research withplants gathered from formations over the past several years that a spinningplasma vortex containing microwave frequencies are interacting with the plantsin some of the formations. The source of the spinning plasma vortex is not"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"known. But Mr. Levengood hypothesizes that the microwave frequencies areheating the plant cells, producing fundamental biophysical and biochemicalchanges which allow the stems to go flat to the ground in a softened state beforecooling flat on the soil. Mr. Levengood says that such cell changes in cerealcrops cannot be produced by hoaxers with boards and string, leaving the stillunanswered questions after ten years of designs worldwide: Who-- or what-- isproducing these enigmatic formations year after year-- and why?Linda Moulton Howe investigating a formation in wheatat Cherhill, Wiltshire, England on August 8,1993.We b s it e s :http://www.aviation-uk.com/cropper/99apr2.htmhttp://cropcircleconnector.com/Sorensen/PeterSorensen99.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
