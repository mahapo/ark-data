There wasa full moon on New Year's Day and another last night on January 31st. It'sunusual to have two full moons occur in the same month. And it will happenagain in March. That's even more unusual. In fact, double \"blue moons\" won'thappen again until 2018.Why blue? you might ask. Well, editors at Sky & Telescope magazine checkedtheir archives and found \"blue moon\" mentioned in a 1937 farmers' almanac.But the story had nothing to do with two full moons in the same month. So, it'sstill a mystery why the color blue ever got attached to a second full moon.Another unusual astronomical event happened in January on Saturday, the 23rd.John Horack, a NASA spokesman, said U. S. and European scientists caughttheir first ever \"live\" picture of a gamma-ray burst from space. Horack toldreporters, \"It was huge. This is one of the brightest bursts we have ever seen.\"That's saying something since back on August 27th, 1998, several satellitesdetected a gamma and x-ray burst so powerful that it temporarily ionized theupper atmosphere and caused at least two satellites to automatically shut downin order to prevent electronic damage. Gamma-ray bursts were first noticedthirty years ago. No one knows what causes them. While scientists are nowanalyzing the January 23rd gamma burst, I talked with Dr. John Huchra,Professor of Astronomy at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Hewas one of the co-discoverers of what is called the Great Wall of Galaxies backin 1989 and he continues to puzzle over many current cosmic mysteries,including the huge gamma ray bursts.Astrophysicists have confirmed the existence of black holes that pull ineverything around them, including light. Where does all the matter and energygo? Some scientists theorize there are white holes that spew back out what goesinto black holes. So I asked Dr. John Huchra if white holes had ever beendocumented and might they have something to do with the extraordinary andmysterious gamma ray bursts."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"John Huchra, Ph.D., Professor of Astronomy, Harvard SmithsonianCenter for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Massachusetts: \"No. Although thereare some people who think that some of these giant gamma ray bursts and otherexplosions like that other giant outbursts of radiation could be due to things likewhite holes erupting. However, the current favored models are not those.\"IF THESE HUGE GAMMA RAY RADIATIONS THAT WE MEASUREONCE IN AWHILE WERE WHITE HOLE EXPLOSIONS INTO OURUNIVERSE - THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE COMING FROMSOMEPLACE OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSE, WOULDN'T THEY?\"Well, that's a tough question. As you see, there are things that we don't knowabout physics and about the universe. ...And for example, in the case of theuniverse, the most favored model right now is infinite size. And it may bebounded or may not be. But if the universe is infinite in size, we again- even ifwe did spend a lot of time mapping the universe - would only see out to whatwe call the horizon.WE'D NEVER BE ABLE TO GET OUTSIDE OF IT TO LOOK IN, SOTO SPEAK?That's basically right. You can't get outside to look in. So, it's a hypotheticalquestion at the moment - and we don't know the answer.BUT IT'S HYPOTHETICALLY POSSIBLE THAT THE BIG BANGCOULD HAVE BEEN A WHITE HOLE ERUPTION FROM SOMEPLACE OUTSIDE THE CURRENT UNIVERSE?Could well be, but the most favored theories that come out of particle physicsare not white hole theories, but rather assume there was some vacuum energy inthe universe or universes, plural, that was eventually released and created thematter we see today.WE ALWAYS GET BACK TO THE QUESTION OF WHY AND HOWDID ALL THIS BEGIN?And was there anything before it? And you want to know the answer? Theanswer is we don't know.WHY DOES THE AGE OF THE UNIVERSE KEEP CHANGING?The age of the universe keeps changing because we keep getting a lot moreinformation about what's happening out there. You may know that in fact thehistory of the subject goes back to 1929 and 1930 or so when Edwin Hubblefirst discovered the expansion of the universe -- that galaxies tend to be movingaway from us, are red shifted. He tried to calculate the expansion rate of theuniverse by measuring distances and velocities to galaxies back then. The onlyproblem was that in 1929 when he did that, he got an age for the universe thatwas only 2 billion years. And that was a bit of an embarrassment, because at thesame time geologists at the same time were finding that ages of the earth is about3.5 billion years. So, by definition, it didn't make sense for the earth to be olderthan the universe.TODAY, I THINK GEOLOGISTS ARE PLACING THE EARTHCLOSER TO 4.5 BILLION YEARS AND THE ENTIRE SOLARSYSTEM AT 5 BILLION.Yes, something like that. But fortunately, astronomers figured out what Hubbledidn't quite get right and we are now talking about expansion ages for the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"universe in the range of 10 to 14 or billion years.IN JANUARY IN AUSTIN, THE AMERICAN ASTRONOMICALSOCIETY ISSUED INFORMATION SAYING THEY ARE PRETTYCONFIDENT NOW THAT THE UNIVERSE IS BEING REDEFINED ATABOUT 14 BILLION YEARS IN AGE. WHAT HAS HAPPENED TOCLARIFY EVEN THAT MUCH?Well, a couple of other things as well. There are usually three pieces to thispuzzle. One is to determine how fast the universe is expanding because thatallows you to track back the expansion to the time of the Big Bang when it allstarted -- the astronomer's definition of the age of the universe. The other thingthat has happened that is incredibly important has been the discovery in just thepast year that it looks as if in fact the universe is, number one, less dense thanmany of the theorists thought it was. So the universe is not expanding as fast --how do I put it? -- the universe's expansion is not slowing down as fast as theythought it was. Hold that thought. It's a confusing one.But there's also been a discovery by two different groups now, using very distantSuper Nova -- also observed with the Hubble Space Telescope -- that thereappears to be some pressure force, a Cosmological Constant, that is in factincreasing the expansion rate of the universe with time.IS THE ANALOGY SOMETHING LIKE -- IF YOU WERE BLOWINGUP A BALLOON THAT THE AIR YOU ARE PUTTING INTO THEBALLOON THAT IS MAKING IT EXPAND WOULD BE ANALOGOUSTO THIS PRESSURE THAT IS BLOWING OUT THE UNIVERSE?That's a reasonable way of thinking about it. It has some flaws because we don'tthink of the Cosmological Constant as matter, but it's right in the sense that it's apressure term that is sort of the opposite of gravity. It's repulsive as opposed toattractive.SO THE QUESTION IS; WHAT IS THE PRESSURE THAT ISBLOWING UP THE UNIVERSE?Exactly. We've found evidence that it's there. It's not absolutely certain yet.Looking at it with a somewhat jaundiced eye of an experimentalist, so my job isto knock down theories rather than to build them up -- it's not absolutely certainit's the right answer. But evidence is beginning to look pretty good that the stuffis out there. I should say, that the Cosmological Constant probably exists.WHICH IS THIS PRESSURE?Which is the pressure term, that's correct. But we do NOT know what it is.IS IT ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THERE COULD BE OTHER UNIVERSESOUTSIDE OF THIS ONE SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER BYSOME KIND OF ELECTROMAGNETIC MEMBRANE AND THATINSTEAD OF A PRESSURE INSIDE THIS UNIVERSE EXPANDING,THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY SOME KIND OF DYNAMIC BETWEENOTHER UNIVERSES THAT ARE CAUSING ALMOST ANATTRACTION TO EXPAND?Well, that's one idea. There are a number that have been put forward. But themultiple universe idea was almost something required in the past because of thefact it appears that universes that are just exactly bound -- that have just exactlyenough material in them to stop expanding in infinite time -- another verycomplicated concept -- were the very favored ones by theoretical cosmologists."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"However, with the discovery of a possible Cosmological Constant and with thevery strong evidence that exists that the amount of matter in the universe -- themass energy density in the universe is only about one-third -- a quarter to a third-- of what is required to stop the expansion -- OK? The need for a multipleuniverse theory goes away.BUT ISN'T THERE A LOT OF CONTROVERSY ABOUT WHAT ISCALLED \"DARK MATTER\" OR \"HIDDEN MATTER\" THAT MIGHTSWITCH THE BALANCE TO A UNIVERSE THAT WILL CONTRACTON ITSELF?It's going away. In other words, we experimentalists have not found enough stuffout there to really close the universe. If the numbers that are currently beingtalked about are correct, then the expansion age of the universe ends up beingsomewhere between 14 and 16 billion years -- that includes the low massdensity, the value of the expansion rates that we have been measuring with theHubble Space Telescope, and the presence of a Cosmological Constant.THAT IS AS OF JANUARY 1999 WITH WHAT WE KNOW ABOUTTHIS COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT PRESSURE EXPANSION?That's right. And that may solve another problem that's been around for awhilebecause without the Cosmological Constant -- even with a low mass density --one was getting ages for the universe that were between 12 and 14 billion years-- and that was slightly less than what we thought the ages of the oldest starswere -- which is now 14 to 16.SO, NOW THIS WOULD EXPLAIN THAT STRANGE PROBLEM THATWAS DESCRIBED LAST YEAR AND THE YEAR BEFORE THATSOME STARS SEEM TO BE OLDER THAN THE AGE OF THEUNIVERSE APPEARED TO BE?Right. And at the same time we discovered that those stars in the globularclusters which we think are the oldest collection of stars in the universe may infact be a little bit younger than we thought just a few years ago -- are-calibration of the distance to those objects, also based on satellite data allowsus to measure more accurate distances.WHAT IS THE AGE ESTIMATED NOW OF THE GLOBULARCLUSTERS?I'd say that if you take the evidence -- you're probably getting 14 billion yearsplus or minus a couple.THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE CLEAR AT WHAT WE WOULDCONSIDER TO BE THE EDGE OF THE BIG BANG WHERE THEGLOBULAR CLUSTERS WERE AT A MUCH EARLIER STAGE INTHE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE?Well, they are the oldest things we can see around us in terms of stars. And theremay be some older things in the model, but in terms of our ability to measurethe things we see here -- it's a little bit like age dating a rock except you have touse theory and the measured properties of the stars in these clusters to estimatethe age.If all of these suppositions are correct, then I think as Mike Turner at the Univ.of Chicago is often fond of saying -- now, that is -- \"we may have solved thecosmological problem. We may have the correct age for the age of the universe."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"We may have the right ages for the oldest stars that we see around. And thesolution to the problem is better data on the expansion rate. And the presence ofthe Cosmological Constant, this pressure.DOES IT HAVE AN EERIE FEELING TO YOU TO CONTEMPLATETHAT WE'RE IN A UNIVERSE THAT COULD KEEP EXPANDINGINFINITELY FOREVER?No, believe it or not. I've been working on this for too long to have a particularpoint or view. And in fact, I tend to like to read poetry in my off hours. And I'malways struck by Robert Frost's line about the universe ending in fire or ice. \"Icewill suffice.\"MEANING IT WILL GET COLDER, NOT HOTTER.That's right.\"But, how did it happen?Well, that's the $64,000 question. Are they the result of some process that camethrough what we call the combination - the time when matter started to reallydominate what was happening in the universe, or not? And the answer again is: Idon't know.One of the problems we're coming down to, assuming that the Big Picture is nowcoming close to closure assuming January 1999 cosmology as a whole is solved,the question now is how the heck do we get the things that we see to form andbe the way they are. And so far, none of the models -- none of the theoreticalmodels of how structure forms in the universe -- does a good job of making thesebig things. That's why it's very importan t to find out if they are real. Whetherthey are gravitationally bound or things like that. Because in fact, the next leveldown in the cosmology, there is this problem -- what the observer sees -- whatwe see when we go out to map things isn't what the theories of the moment arepredicting. And there is a debate about that between the observers and thetheorists, but in this case you better trust the observers.WHY WOULD GALAXIES LINE UP LIGHT YEARS IN DIAMETER?I don't know. What's usually done now to test out various theories and models isto put everything into a big computer. And generally these simulations do showup filamentary structures. But the filamentary structures that come out of thesimulations are on a much, much smaller scale than the kinds of things thatDavid or I or Margaret are finding.IF THIS PRESSURE THAT HAS BEEN EXPANDING THE UNIVERSEHAS BEEN CONSISTENT, HOW COULD MATTER HAVE LINED UPIN LONG STRINGS?That's a question I don't know the answer to. We think it's gravity. But wehaven't made it work yet.\"Is Pluto A Planet, Or A Kuiper Belt Object?The scientist at the center of this new controversy about re-categorizing Pluto isastronomer Brian Marsden, Associate Director of Planetary Sciences at theHarvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Recently I asked him about headlines such as: \"What is Pluto anyway? ExpertsDebate.\"Brian Marsden, Associate Director, Planetary Sciences, HarvardSmithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Massachusetts: \"It'sabout time that Pluto should be considered as a member of the Kuiper Belt. Ithink many astronomers have come around to that way of thinking anyway.THE KUIPER BELT IS?Yes, the Kuiper Belt -- also called the Neptunian Belt -- is a group of bodies onthe outskirts of the Solar System out beyond Neptune -- probably extendingquite some distance beyond Neptune and a pretty large group. Maybe a totalamount of the mass in the belt could be almost equal to that of the earth. Anumber of bodies have been discovered in that region beginning in 1992 andwe've got 90 members as of this time. And many of those members actually haveorbits that are very much like the orbit of Pluto.All this material we are talking about is basically icy and if you bring an icyobject close enough to the sun, you get a comet. The ice vaporizes and releasesdust and stuff that's in it to make a tail.CRAIG TOMBAUGH IN 1930 -- WHICH WAS JUST ABOUT 70 YEARSAGO -- FIRST DISCOVERED PLUTO AND IT WAS CLASSIFIED AS APLANET THEN. WHY 70 YEARS LATER IS THERE NOW THISQUESTION ABOUT HOW TO CATEGORIZE PLUTO? WHY IS IT NOTA PLANET?I'm not saying it's not a planet. The problem is one of semantics andterminology.ISN'T IT TRUE THAT PLUTO IS EVEN SMALLER IN DIAMETERTHAN OUR OWN MOON?Yes, indeed, Pluto is quite a bit smaller than the moon and only 1/5th the massof the moon. It took really until 1978 to determine the mass of the Plutoproperly because in that year a satellite of Pluto -- Chyron -- was discovered andby measuring how far away it was from Pluto and how long it took to go roundPluto -- you could determine the mass of Pluto to be about 1/5th the mass ofour moon. And as for determinations of the size of Pluto, this was done in the1980s because it so happened that there were some occasions where the satellitewould pass in front of Pluto itself and visa versa and using that information youcould determine the size which is about 1500 miles.WHAT IS IT THAT PROVOKED YOU AND THE INTERNATIONALASTRONOMICAL UNION RIGHT NOW TO GO FOR ARE-DEFINITION OF PLUTO?Well, in the past few years since 1992, we have had discoveries of other objectslike Pluto, but smaller. They are in that part of the Solar System and some ofthem have orbits like the orbit of Pluto with periods of revolution about the sunof 248 years. These objects are smaller. The largest object we know so far of the90 or so that we've discovered there is about 400 miles across. So it's about1/3rd or 1/4 of the diameter of Pluto."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"I think during the next 5 to 10 years we will discover another object out therethat is the same size -- maybe even larger than Pluto.THAN PLUTO?I would not be at all surprised.IN YOUR PROFESSIONAL OPINION AS AN ASTRONOMER, WHATDO YOU THINK PLUTO IS? A CAPTURED COMET? A CAPTUREDASTEROID? IT HAS THIS VERY ODD ORBIT. WHAT DO YOU THINKPLUTO REALLY IS?Oh, I think Pluto is related to comets. I don't think it was captured fromanywhere. I think that the comets originated in that part of the Solar System.They formed just beyond Neptune and didn't form into a large planet likeNeptune.THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL THE ICY DEBRIS LEFT OVERFROM THE FORMATION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM OUT THERE?Yes, indeed. And that icy debris -- what we are seeing out there are fairly largeobjects. These are several -- all of them we have seen there must be a hundredmiles across or more or we couldn't see them. So, they are rather large forcomets, yes. But presumably there are smaller bodies there that we just can'tdetect. There must be an enormous amount of material there and Pluto justhappens to be a giant among all the rest of it. But we are not taking away itsstatus as a major planet. It will still continue to have dual citizenship, if you like.It will still continue to be on the list of major planets.And the International Astronomical Union is not proposing to demote Pluto inany way!SO THE FACT THAT PLUTO IS AT THE EDGE OF A BELT OF ICYOBJECTS THAT ARE REFERRED TO AS THE TRANS-NEPTUNIANOBJECTS -- THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO COME UP WITHCATEGORIZATIONS THAT WOULD SAY PLUTO IS UNIQUE ANDUNUSUAL AND HAS AN UNUSUAL ORBIT AND IS VERY SMALL --SMALLER THAN THE MOON. IT'S STILL GOING TO BE THE 9THPLANET, IT'S NOT CHANGING THAT DESIGNATION, BUT YOUARE TRYING TO CATALOG ALL THOSE OBJECTS OUT THERETHAT YOU REFER TO GENERALLY AS TRANS-NEPTUNIAN ANDARE GENERALLY ICY BODIES?That is exactly what is happening. And furthermore, we may get morediscoveries. I fully expect things Pluto sized -- verging on Pluto size or maybeeven slightly larger than Pluto -- to be found. So, what are we going to do withthose? Yes, we are going to put them in our catalog, but we may also want toconsider adding those to the list of the major planets at some time in the future.YOU ARE CONSIDERED ONE OF THE EXPERTS ON COMETS. WEARE HEADED INTO 1999 AND 2000. ARE THERE ANY COMETSTHAT YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES HAVE FOUND THAT MAY BECOMING THROUGH IN THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO OR THREE?No, we don't have any bright ones on the way that we know about. Any brightcomet that would come along would be unexpected. Now, I realize that thereare certain mystic groups suggesting that there is going to be a big comet coming,I think July or August this year is one of the months mentioned this year by"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"some mystical reasoning. I receive e-mail about this and letters from time to timeand questions that people ask me about this. And I have to answer that we knowof no such comet. There is no comet on its way in that will be at all bright,visible with the naked eye. Certainly not one that is going to come and collidewith the earth. There is none that we know about. And if there are people outthere claiming that something is coming that we don't know about, I would liketo know how they know that is going to happen. We certainly don't, and we'reusually the first to know this sort of thing.\" At the recent American Astronomical Society meeting in Austin, Texas, thelargest structures ever seen in the universe were described -- two strings ofgalaxies stretching for nearly two billion light years. If our universe is about 16billion light years in diameter, these galaxies stretch over at least one-eighth ofit. And there might be even more of them. In fact, some astronomers are referringto the strings of galaxies as \"imprints of the big bang\" that grew from lumps inthe primordial soup of matter and energy soon after creation.Astronomy is a hard science where physical evidence is measured and analyzed.The problem is, as Dr. Huchra pointed out, each year brings new refinements intechnologies and data which can change theories, conclusions and even thedefinition of something as big as a planet. An editorial in the January 25th, 1999Boston Globe newspaper said: \"Nothing pushes the public outrage button quitelike semantics or the fear that something familiar is being scrapped, even if it'sseveral billion miles from Earth and has been the subject of scientific debate foryears. \"Because of its size, its distance from the sun, and its unusual egg-shapedorbit, so different from the more circular orbits of the other planets, astronomershave been arguing the merits of including Pluto in the planetary lineup almostsince its discovery by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930.\"As much as astronomers keep learning, it's a fact that only about ONEPERCENT of the universe has been mapped and studied so far. Only 1%. So thecosmic surprises yet to be discovered must be many.http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa-local-home.htmlCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expressly"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"prohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
