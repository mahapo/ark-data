Beneath the headline is a photograph offarmer Adrian Jackson with one of his slaughtered rams. The Jackson farm inViolet Town, Victoria has been losing 100 sheep a year.Photograph © 1999 by Rob Leeson The Herald Sun.The story by Sue Hewitt begins, \"This ram is the victim of a mysterious killerthat is stalking stock in Victoria. The ram's nose has been bitten off, it's skin hasbeen peeled back and its skeleton has been stripped of flesh. Even the intestineshave been eaten.\"This Australian sheep is not the same as the precise, bloodless excisions of ears,eyes, jaw flesh, tongues, genitals and rectal/vaginal tissues discovered in animalmutilations around the world since at least the 1960s. A common explanationhas been predators or satanic cults. But in Australia, even the farmers doubttheir sheep were killed by dogs or foxes. Hewitt wrote, \"(The farmers) said thesheep were totally devoured while dogs usually mauled several sheep in apaddock and ate only small portions of them.\"Several months ago, farmer Adrian Jackson put a sheep guard dog in thepaddock and the killings seemed to halt. But when the dog was removed theweek of July 5th, two ewes and the ram pictured above were killed and largesections of tissue removed.\"We just want to know what it is,\" Mr. Jackson said. Some investigators havespeculated that perhaps large puma cats are involved. So, The Sunday HeraldSun took the ram carcass to the Melbourne Zoo for analysis.Sue Hewitt reported that \"the head of the carnivore section, Paul Whitehorn,said the killing was inconsistent with a big cat attack. He said a big cat wouldhave crunched through the rib cage and other bones. The ram had a broken rightleg and might have been defenseless when attacked. But Mr. Whitehorn said hecould not identify the killer.\"In many other unusual animal deaths in the United States, necropsies have"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"confirmed broken hip, spine or leg bones as well, provoking law enforcement tospeculate that animals have been dropped from the air to the ground after theexcisions have been performed elsewhere.The manager of the Victorian Farmers Federation in Gippsland is John Curtis.He said, \"I've seen photos after animals have been attacked and they have beenkilled by something we are not used to.\" Mr. Curtis said. DNA testing for salivaon carcasses was being considered. \"We can't rule out anything. (Whatever thisis) bites their nose off. That's uncharacteristic of a dog or a fox.\"London, EnglandWhile I was in England this summer to research the crop circle mystery, I metanother researcher, David Cayton, who has been investigating animal mutilationsin Great Britain for the past five years. He told me there have been several sheepand cattle with the classic excisions of an ear, eye, jaw flesh, tongue removed,genitals cut neatly away and rectum cored out - consistent with the thousands ofother such reports over the past forty years around the world.In the past six months, there have also been more than a hundred strangemutilations of cats around London, usually heads removed and often one ormore legs as well. Similar mutilations of cats and rabbits, often bloodless, havebeen reported since the 1970s in many parts of Canada and the United States.For example, by August 1989, sixty-seven cats had been found in Tustin,California. The New York Times reported on August 13, 1989, \"Some of them(were) cut in half with what some say is almost surgical precision, othersdisemboweled or skinned.\" Janet Hampson of Tustin told reporters, \"There isnever any blood at the scene, the animals are often dismembered with surgicalprecision and paws and other body parts are often left on the ground instrikingly similar arrangements. No one ever seems to hear anything, nor do dogsbark during the killing.\" She believed the cats were captured, taken elsewhere,their blood drained and organs removed, then replaced on their owners' lawns.Cayton gave me a copy of The Independent On Sunday's August 1, 1999newspaper magazine that has a three-page article entitled, \"The Cat Flap\" byRichard Askwith. The article spotlights English headlines such as \"Serial CatKiller Cuts Up 100 Pets\" (Nov. 24, 1998, The Mirror) and \"Ritualistic killersstalk family pets\" (The Sunday Telegraph).Headlines in British newspapers about cat mutilations in 1998-1999. Richard Askwith wrote, \"The trouble started a year ago, although nobody could"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"have recognized then quite how troublesome it was going to be. Nigel Shelton, auniformed Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA)inspector in north London, was called to a bloody scene in Palmers Green. Thedecapitated body of a cat had been found in its owner's garden - and, neatly laidon its owner's doorstep, its head.\"Such things happen: man's inhumanity to domestic pets knows few limits. Butthe curious thing was that a few weeks later something similar happened: a cat'sbody, also in north London, headless. Then it happened again, and again:decapitated cats began to appear at roadsides and in gardens all over London.\"By the end of September 1998, the number of cases was well into doublefigures and the RSPCA had been called in. ... All winter, the savage incidentspiled up, like a bad episode of Inspector Morse; and all winter, (the RSPCA)worked round the clock to track down the mutilators. A special squad -Operation Obelisk - was formed with the Metropolitan Police. Every callrelating to such incidents was meticulously logged, and plotted whereappropriate, on a map which now showed two distinct but converging clusters:around north London and around south London.\"But in contrast to blood at the first scene, most of the other mutilations weredescribed as \"drained blood,\" meaning no blood at the scene. And by November1998, Operation Obelisk had logged in ten unusual rabbit deaths as well that fitthe modus operandi of the cats.As cases kept mounting, in February 1999, Operation Obelisk was called off.Askwith wrote, \"There was no formal announcement, but journalists who hadbeen assigned to cat-ripping duties were quietly informed that the alarm wasover. With a couple of possible exceptions, the cats in question had not beentortured by maniacs. They had been killed by cars and then mauled, after death,by foxes.\" Allegedly, the professor who examined some mutilated animalcarcasses said there were \"little serrated teeth marks,\" which he assumed werefox bites, but the professor refuses to be identified. In some United States casesover the years, serrated excisions have been examined by pathologists whoconclude the serrated edge was somehow cauterized with high heat, implying atechnology and not fox teeth.The sudden dismissal of the animal mutilations as not serious was toocontradictory to the facts for most people. \"It's an absolute load of rubbish,\" saysJune Bailey, a Sussex-based 'pet detective' who helped the owners of several ofthe non-existent cat-ripper's victims. \"An animal, if it gets run over, would notbe beheaded, have its legs and heads chopped off and be returned to its garden.\"The next very odd development in this story was that the RSPCA began todefend foxes. \"We didn't want people to go against foxes,\" a spokesman toldRichard Askwith.Askwith concluded his article, \"That's meant emphasizing in any publicstatement that the foxes only mutilated cats that were already dead. It has alsomeant keeping public statements to a minimum. And so six months of inquiry,costing tens of thousands of pounds and provoking several acres of newsprint,have mysteriously vanished, hurried from sight to avoid embarrassment.\"June Bailey said, \"The RSPCA put forward these ridiculous notions becausethey can't find out who's done it. They don't want to spend any money. But it'sstill going on. There are a lot of rabbits missing in Portsmouth at the moment,and there's an awful lot of cats gone in Sussex.\"More Information:For in-depth investigations of unusual animal deaths that include color"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"photographs, law enforcement offense reports, veterinary necropsy andpathology reports, please reference my books An Alien Harvest, Glimpses ofOther Realities, Vol. I: Facts & Eyewitnesses and my documentaries A StrangeHarvest and Strange Harvests 1993 listed in the Earthfiles Shop.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
