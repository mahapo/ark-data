And so far this week, those vicioushalf mile wide tornadoes with winds approaching 300 miles an hour in Kansasand Oklahoma this week have killed at least 44 people and wiped out more thantwo thousand homes and businesses. Earlier this year in January, another seriesof unusually violent tornadoes tore through the Tennessee region. Are thesefreak storms? Or will atmospheric turbulence get worse and worse as globalwarming continues to take hold of the earth?Few scientists any longer argue that global warming is real. And most agree thatcontributing factors are greenhouse gasses from human industries and cars. Inthe year 2050 -- only 5 decades from now -- the concentration of carbon dioxidein the earth's atmosphere is expected to be at least TWICE what it was in the1700s. And the planet will be somewhere between two and seven degreesFahrenheit warmer.Last week in Philadelphia at a National Oceanographic and AtmosphericAdministration Lab, powerful computers were used to project current globalwarming trends 500 years into the future. Not because continued globalwarming is a guaranteed future. The computer modeling was done, explainedJerry Mahlman -- an expert in climate modeling -- because: \"It is almostimpossible for people to think beyond 50 years.\"Scientists estimate that 90% of the warming from greenhouse gasses will occurin this next century. What happens if you look further into the future with theworld maintaining carbon dioxide levels (of about 560 parts per million) as theyare today? In the computer projection, Philadelphia turns into a hot, steamy citylike Bangkok. The oceans and seas rise and all the coastlines will be underwater. New Jersey, for example, would have ocean all the way to the GardenState Parkway. And Florida would be under water from Key Largo to Ft.Lauderdale.It could get worse if energy consumption continues at present rates. Ifgreenhouse emissions aren't cut back now, levels of carbon dioxide couldquadruple instead of double in the coming century. If that happened, oceanswould rise more than six feet and water would advance inland for at least aquarter mile. \"Exactly where the Earth will end up,\" Mahlman said, \"willdepend upon the choices society makes during the next 100 years. What iscertain is that climate change is coming. There is no question about that. We areonly arguing about when and how much.\"The earth's climate is already changing -- and one place that had a radicalchange in 1998 was the West Peninsula of Antarctica. Satellite images showedthat huge portions of the Larsen B and Wilkins ice shelves broke up morequickly than anyone had predicted. Geologist Ted Scambos at the NationalSnow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado in Boulder has beenmonitoring the South Polar region for several years. He talked to me recentlyabout his surprise that the big glaciers broke up as fast as they did."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Interview:Ted Scambos, Ph.D., Geologist, National Snow and Ice Data Center,University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado: \"We've been monitoring theAntarctic Peninsula for quite awhile because there has been indications of astrong regional climate warming in the area. In the last year, we saw that two ofthe large ice shelves in the area retreated very rapidly. By retreating, they calvedoff thousands of small icebergs and they (ice shelves) are now quite a bit smallerthan they've ever been in the past and are probably on the way out.THESE ARE THE LARSEN B AND WILKINS ICE SHELVES?That's correct.ACCORDING TO A RELEASE I HAVE THAT NEARLY 1100 SQUAREMILES OF THEIR TOTAL AREA DISAPPEARED IN 1998 ALONE.That's right. It's a significant event. I think what makes it important and thereason that people call up and ask about what is going on is that it's such anincontrovertible bit of evidence that something significant is going on -- at leastregionally. And others who study other regions have their own set ofobservations of things that haven't occurred in the past, but are happening now.WHAT HAS ACCELERATED THIS MELTING AND RETREAT?What's happening is that these ice shelves are seeing a longer melt season everysummer -- particularly in the 1990s they have seen lots of melt on their surfacethrough January and February which is summer in the Southern Hemisphere.And as we get water pooling on the surface, the water acts to enhance thefracturing that occurs naturally within the ice shelves. Ordinarily, these fractureshave a tendency to heal themselves and if there isn't a lot of melt water around,then the ice shelves just goes merrily along, cracks form and then seal back upagain. With water and fairly warm temperatures, the cracks penetrate all the waythrough the ice shelf and essentially over a few years it's a mass of fractures andessentially separate icebergs that are all drifting next to one another tightlypacked until a storm or tidal surge comes along and sweeps the bergs out to sea.In other words, it appears that these things (ice shelves) have been shattered forawhile now by these warm summertime temperatures, by the melt water actingon the fractures. And in 1998, we saw large areas getting swept out.1998 WAS THE FASTEST RETREAT OF THESE TWO GLACIERS ONRECORD?Oh, yes. For these two ice shelves, definitely.WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME IN HISTORY THAT THE WILKINS ICESHELF WAS ACTUALLY GONE?Well, that's the key. Also within the last year, we've been able to get a betterhandle on just how old these ice shelves are and the answer we're coming upwith is centuries old -- possibly they've been there since the end of the last IceAge. Particularly in the Larsen B, we can track back surface features that formedwhen the ice was still up in the mountains still grounded on the continent. Andthen as it flowed out over the ice shelves, those surface features remained. So,by knowing the speed of ice flows on the ice shelves we can determine that thatshelf must be old enough to have it flow from the mountains out to the front ofthe ice shelf. And that takes it about four or five centuries at least.So, for Wilkins, it's a little bit fuzzier, but the thickness of the Wilkins and someother features in the area imply that it, too, is at least several centuries old. Now,since we know that a ten year period of particularly warm temperatures causesthese things to disintegrate, then we can say that the climate in the 1990sapparently is unique relatively to the last 400 or 500 years in the AntarcticPeninsula.IF THIS ACCELERATION OF MELT CONTINUES INTO 1999 AND"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"2000, WHAT IS NOW THE PROJECTED TIME FOR WHEN THEWILKINS AND LARSEN B WILL BE GONE?I think the best way to answer that is that in the next one or two warm summerseasons, you'll see both these ice shelves disappear. Or there might be smallremnants remaining, but essentially disintegrate and there will be open oceanbays in areas that used to be covered by ice shelves.THEN YOU MEAN IT COULD HAPPEN THIS SUMMER OR NEXTSUMMER OF 2000?Yeah. It's -- we've seen how fast these things can happen. We have a pretty goodidea of the mechanism. It's not a question of actually having the entire thicknessof the ice shelf melt due to warmer temperatures. The action of a relatively smallamount of melt water can destroy the entire ice shelf even though it's 600 to 900feet thick.WITH THESE LITERALLY MELTING AWAY AND BREAKING OFFINTO THE SEA -- WHAT ABOUT SEA LEVEL RISE?The problem is, or the question is, will the glaciers that fed these ice shelves --sort of behind the ice shelves on the continent, begin to speed up because thereis no longer a large mass of ice obstructing their flow? Again the Larsen B andWilkins -- their break ups don't effect sea level directly. But if the glaciers thatfeed them were to speed up, then that would have potentially an effect on sealevel. I think the key is that this trend is started at the northern tip of theAntarctic Peninsula and over the last 20 years or so, we've seen several iceshelves show melt ponds, show lots of calving events, begin to retreat andeventually disappear. The next several ice shelves to the south are larger andhave larger glaciers feeding them. So, the question becomes: When we see speedups in the glaciers where the Larsen B and the Wilkins used to be and will thetrend continue to the larger ice shelves to the south?IF THEY DO, IF THE LARGER ICE SHELVES TO THE SOUTHCONTINUE TO MELT AT THE RATE OF LARSEN B AND OFWILKINS -- WHAT DO YOU EXPECT WILL HAPPEN?First, if the ice shelves would disappear -- then if the glaciers were to speed upbehind it, there would be a potential to unload some of the ice in the AntarcticPeninsula and the rest of the Antarctic continent into the ocean. The processwould be slow. But it's conceivable that it would have an upward effect on sealevel. That's the only way a regional warming could significantly effect sea level.Direct melting of the ice sheet is not an effective way to try to raise sea level.There is just not that much energy imparted to the ice sheet every year. But bycausing glaciers to flow more rapidly through some feedback mechanism, likeremoving ice shelves or like having water penetrate to the base of the ice sheetand begin to cause things to speed up -- that's how it's possible to cause largechanges in what we call the mass balance of the ice sheet. And by mass balance,we mean mass leaving the continent of Antarctica and flowing towards theocean. And that could raise sea level.HOW MUCH?In the West Antarctic ice sheet which is the area I'm speaking of where there arethese more dynamic glaciers, the potential is about 15 feet of sea level rise.However, the time scale over which that could possibly occur is slow. Even themost radical runaway kind of models would call for a few centuries, a century ortwo before you could really get most of the mass of the west end of Antarcticainto the ocean.BUT WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY THAT THE MELT OF LARSEN BAND WILKINS IN 1998 SURPRISED YOU AND OTHER SCIENTISTS?The rate of change in the Antarctic Peninsula is fairly surprising. And what'smore is the realization that the ice shelves were fairly durable until the decade ofthe 1980s and 1990s also gives one pause in terms of understanding what's goingon there and how it compares to recent climate history.WHAT IT MIGHT MEANS FOR OUR FUTURE AS A SPECIES INWHICH SO MUCH OF THE POPULATION OF THE WORLD ARE ATCOASTAL CITIES."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Yes, it's going to be costly to deal with the many effects that regional warmingsand the overall trends towards a warming climate on earth has. In terms ofcatastrophes, I think sea level rise is going to be a background issue with barrierislands and break waters around the world. The Antarctic may begin to have amore significant contribution in the future, 50 to 100 years from now. Rightnow, the best thing to do is to understand how the system works, to take note ofevents that are occurring that appear to demonstrate rather vividly that things arechanging in the Antarctic ice and climate system.IN A DRAMATIC WAY.Ye a h .WHEN WAS THE VERY LAST TIME THAT SCIENTISTS ESTIMATETHAT THE ANTARCTIC LAND ITSELF WAS FREE OF ICE?That's an interesting question. Basically, there are several epochs in geology.They have names that are associated with either the climate or the geologicevents that were occurring in them. The Pleistocene has been the most recentepoch just prior to the current one and that has been characterized by ice ages.Now, particularly in the East Antarctic -- which is quite cold -- this is where theSouth Pole is located and where some of the Russian bases that have the coldestrecorded temperatures ever are located. The East Antarctic -- chances are it hasbeen covered by ice for the last few million years, with some retreats in the pastbut never completely ice free in the last 2 or 3 million years.In the Pliocene which is the epoch before that when the earth was quite a bitwarmer, apparently there have been beech tree forests in the Antarctic Continentalong the area around McMurdo which is the main base in the Antarctic, a littlesouth of McMurdo.MEANING PALM TREES?No, I mean beech -- southern beech which is a type of deciduous tree.THEY'VE ACTUALLY FOUND EVIDENCE OF BEECH TREES IN THEANTARCTIC?Yes, we have found fossilized leaves in recent sediments in the Antarcticindicating that a few million years ago there were actually forests along thesehillsides on a relatively ice free Antarctic continent - which is quite remarkable.It implies a whole world of different climate.ONLY THREE OR FOUR MILLION YEARS AGO?Yeah. That's true.IF YOU GO BACK 65 MILLION TO THE EXTINCTION OF THEDINOSAURS -- WAS THE ENTIRE PLANET A TROPICAL SPHERE?That's the general model that is painted for the late Cretaceous period -- for theend of the dinosaur era. And a globe that was largely flooded by higher sealevels. For example, here in Colorado, there was a tongue of the Gulf of Mexicoextending up along what's now the Rocky Mountains all the way as what is nowDenver and Boulder.WATER.And into Wyoming. Yes, sea water.HOW DEEP IS THE ICE AT THE ANTARCTIC?It varies of course -- between a good round number for the central part of thecontinent would be between 1,000 and 3,000 meters.WHICH IS ABOUT 3,000 AND 9,000 FEET WHICH IS NEARLY TWOMILES DEEP AT ITS DEEPEST.That's right.HOW DID THAT EVER OCCUR? HOW DO YOU GET 2 MILES OFICE?Lots and lots of cold, snowy winters. Actually, the cold. The amount of"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"snowfall in the Antarctic is remarkably low, but of course, it accumulates yearafter year with almost no melting in the interior of the continent. Only theperimeter of the Antarctic ever experiences melting and then, in general, only fora few days in mid summer. In the interior (of the continent), even though theaccumulation (of snow) may be only a few centimeters of water every year in theform of snow -- it's been accumulating for 100,000 years and you get thousandsof meters of ice built up.WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS FOR 1998 AND 1999 TO MONITOR THELARSEN B AND WILKINS ICE SHELVES AND THE GLACIERSBEHIND THEM?We're going to continue to collect the daily satellite data we get over the area,plus some additional radar images which are higher resolution that help us seethese events in more detail. There is a plan to use new Landsat 7 image data tolook at these areas and re-map the speed of the glaciers flowing into the areathat are no longer occupied by ice shelves and see if there is a speed up.Monitoring the climate at various stations in Antarctica will continue in theBritish Antarctic Survey, and also with some groups in Austria and Argentinawill probably be down in the field again in the spring and summer seasons in1999 and 2000. They will take a look at these areas and to see how they areresponding. The main thing I'll be interested in seeing is whether or not the trendof break ups and the pattern we think we have identified for how break upsoccur if that continues to push southward into the other ice shelves.BECAUSE IF IT DOES PUSH SOUTHWARD, IT MEANS THAT THERECOULD BE ACCELERATED MELTING COMING OFF OF THOSEGLACIERS BEHIND THE SHELVES?More that new areas will be opened up -- yeah -- those are separate evaluations-- Will ice shelves continue to break up further south? Will glaciers begin tospeed up as a result of the removal of the ice shelves? Those are two separatequestions that I will try to address over the next couple of years.\"More Information:The hard reality in all this climate change is that greenhouse gasses aren't goingto leave the earth's atmosphere quickly. That's why global warming is expectedto keep increasing over the next century, even if we cut back on industrial andauto emissions.Last weekend President Clinton endorsed proposed EPA standards aimed atmaking sport utility vehicles and cars run 80% cleaner. To date, sport utilityvehicles have not been required to meet the same tailpipe emission standards ascars. The EPA also called for the sale of only low-sulfur gasoline so emission-control equipment can work more efficiently.Already this EPA effort to make a bigger dent in auto emissions has beenattacked by Republicans defending the automobile culture. And the AmericanPetroleum Institute says it will try to change EPA's proposal. Such politicalshort term thinking is why the computer projection into the future is a soberingreality check that should make equal headlines with political and economicnews.We b s it e s :National Snow and Ice Data Center,Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciencesat the University of Colorado, Boulder, ColoradoCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
