The transformation was over a crop fieldnot far from the young man's bedroom window. He saw electrical dischargescome down out of the pink glowing light. Then, the object disappeared bysimply blinking out. He ran to the field where the ground was still warm totouch and he could hear a crackling noise. There, he found two circles: oneabout thirty feet in diameter and the other only about two feet wide. As far asthe Dutch teenager is concerned, the pink, expanding light made the two circles.Those circles were sampled for Nancy Talbott's BLT research team and she willtravel to Holland next week to re-sample plants prior to harvest and do furtherinvestigations. I'll have further reports from her in the near future.Since early April this year, there have been at least 66 formations in cereal cropsin England. The array of patterns has ranged from one that looks like a timelapse photograph of a lunar or solar eclipse to another near Barbury Castlewhich was a refined image of an ancient Hebrew menorah with a tripod base.There have been several variations on spirals and fractals - and very long andcomplex pictograms reminiscent of 1990 to 1991 when the mysterious cropformations were discovered in more than twenty countries worldwide, includingrice paddies in Japan and wheat fields in Australia.Over the past few weeks, there have been half a dozen in Germany ...4 in Holland and the Netherlands ...2 in the Czech Republic .... and2 in the United States.The first here was not geometric, but oddly scalloped and downed wheat inMaryland. Electrostatic Crackling Noise in Tennessee Crop Formation:Then the first 1999 geometric formation in the U. S. was discovered June 18th inBrentwood, Tennessee south of Nashville. It consisted of a central ring fromwhich a T-Cross and two corridors ending in circles branched at ninety degreeangles. The longest part of the formation was 190 feet."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Diagram © 1999 by Tom Murdic, Franklin, Tennessee.Resident Tom Murdic from Franklin, Tennessee went into the formation with histwo sons to photograph and measure and they heard a crackling sound.Interview:Tom Murdic, Franklin, Tennessee: \"I noticed - we all noticed - this cracklingnoise. And it was during this time that I made the comment to the kids that itsounded like we were in a bowl of rice krispies. And we were all standing still atthe time.SO YOU WERE STANDING STILL HEARING THIS CRACKLINGSOUND AND ALL THREE OF YOU COULD HEAR IT AT THE SAMETIME.Oh, yeah. We all noted it.HOW LONG WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE CRACKLING SOUNDREMAINED WHILE YOU WERE THERE?The whole time.HOW LONG WERE YOU THERE?I would say we were in the circle somewhere between 30 and 40 minutes.SO ALMOST FOR AN HOUR YOU WERE HEARING THISCRACKLING SOUND?Right.COULD YOU FEEL ANY SENSE OF WARMTH OR HEAT COMINGFROM THE PLANTS OR THE SOIL?No, it was a pretty hot day, so it would be very hard to assess anything.COULD YOU IN ANY INTUITIVE SENSE DETERMINE WHETHEROR NOT THIS CRACKLING SOUND WAS COMING FROM THE AIR,FROM THE PLANTS OR FROM THE SOIL?I just say, you were surrounded by it. You were surrounded by it. It waseverywhere. So, I mean, to say it was coming from one particular source, I can'tsay. Of course, you'd think it was coming from the wheat because that's the onlything in there to make noise. You know, having walked on it.HAD YOU EVER HEARD A SOUND LIKE THAT BEFORE?Yeah. Yeah. Static discharge.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"If the static discharge is produced by technology, whose technology, and why?Mysterious Light and Crop Circles in PeruThere was even a circle reported this spring on March 8th in Peru, SouthAmerica. Residents of Cinochero, a village in the Andes about 16 miles north ofCuzco reported they saw a glowing \"light ship\" land in a field. Later, thePeruvians said that a single large circle was left in the grass where the glowinglight landed. Other International Crop FormationsVarious photographers in various countries are trying to document these peculiarpatterns as they emerge. One in Germany named Frank Lauman described recentspirals near Hessen, Germany this way:\"Amazingly, it seems as if the first formation appeared in full daylight and withina perfect view to the nearby road. Local cropcircle researcher WolfgangSchoppe is sure that it was not present at 8 AM on June 26th when he went bythe field. But the formation was there eight hours later at 4 PM.\"Mr. Lauman also reports that same day, June 26th, a second formation wasdiscovered in a field of rye near Hessen. The formation consisted of a huge spiralmade of a wavy path with several small circles embedded in the standing cropbetween the flattened spiral paths.Photographs by Frank Laumen and many other photographers can be seen atwww.cropcircleconnector.com. New photographs from photographer, PeterSorensen, are shown below.This first photograph referred to as the 'Galactic Crescents' was photographed byNan Lu and is Peter Sorensen's favorite crop formation so far in 1999.Swirling crescent pattern at the base of Hackpen Hilldiscovered July 4, 1999.

Interestingly,the last solar eclipse in Europe for another 79 years occurs August 11, 1999.Peter wrote to me when he sent these two photographs: \"Attached are mypictures of the two eclipse formations. The little one at Bishops Cannings nearDevizes was the first, arriving sometime in April, and the long sequence was atMiddle Wallop near Andover. I'm probably the only person who has a shot ofthe little one with the 'sun' yellow like this! Everyone else has it when it(formation) was new, and the whole field of rape was solid yellow flowers(except for the flattened crop that made up the crescent). The flattened crop wasretarded in its growth cycle (which is why the crescent is yellow after rest ofgreen crop had already flowered.\"Yellow blooming oilseed rape in April 1999 that made the crescent and little grapeshotoutside the formation where the solid green circle overlaps the yellow flowers are theresult of delayed growth confined to those areas. All the rest of the field had alreadybloomed.What would produce such delayed growth in a specific pattern? Location is BishopsCannings, Wiltshire near Devizes.
