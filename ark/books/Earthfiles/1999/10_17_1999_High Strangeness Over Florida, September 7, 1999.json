NASA got a lotof calls, too, and told everyone that the mystery lights were actually a Russianrocket booster falling through the atmosphere and disintegrating over the Gulf ofMexico. NASA said the Russians had launched a communications satellite atopan SL-12 booster on Monday, September 6th, and that the SL-12'sdisintegration was expected. Major Michael Birmingham at the Space CommandHeadquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado told reporters: \"The orbital path ofthe booster took it over the United States. It's not unusual. We, the United Statesand Russia, warn each other of any launch and of any object that may re-enterso it's not mistaken for a warhead.\"Major Birmingham said between sixty and eighty used rocket boostersdisintegrate in the atmosphere each year, but rarely hit earth or the ocean. Heexplained that \"anything going 17,000 mph when it hits the atmosphere mostlikely burns up\" before it gets to ground or water.One possible eyewitness to the rocket break up might have been Deputy LynnTaylor with the Sarasota County Sheriff's Office where he has worked fortwenty-nine years. But Deputy Taylor is confused because the object he watchedwas going west to east from the ocean over the land and then made a 90 degreeturn south along the coast line. His patrol car computer clock said it was exactly5:03 AM EST when he first saw the odd light. NASA stated the Russian boosterrocket broke up between 5:01 and 5:03 AM.Interview:High Strangeness Event Over Tampa to Sarasota, Florida, 4:50-5:05 a.m.,September 7, 1999Lynn Taylor, Deputy Sheriff in Special Operations for the Sarasota CountySheriff's Office, Sarasota, Florida: \"I see this light like a big spot light. And Isaid, 'I wonder what's going on?'I didn't hear anything on the radio, but it must be our helicopter checking thearea. This thing, after I got out of the car, I realized, 'Hell, this is not ahelicopter!' This thing is coming from the northwest, and it doesn't seem to be inany big hurry. And it's coming and it's coming and it's coming. And I said, 'Whatin the name of goodness is that?'And I stood there and looked at it for maybe ten or fifteen seconds. And it'scoming straight at me. And what I thought would be just about parallel with theshoreline, it turns south on the shoreline and it just accelerated. And as itaccelerated, I pick my binoculars up and say, 'What in the hell is that?' Excusemy language, but that's exactly what I said.And I pick my binoculars up I had right in the seat and put on it and it was, ithurt my eyes to look through the binoculars. And then it had accelerated and it"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"looked like big chunks of fire was blowing out the back of it, almost like rocks,big fireball rocks. And I said, 'I've never seen anything like that in my life!'SO THIS DEFINITELY DID NOT HAVE A STEADY DESCENTTOWARDS THE GROUND OR THE WATER?Oh, absolutely not. It came from west to east to the shoreline and then turnedand ran along the shoreline south. And people ninety miles away reportedseeing the same thing I saw.Huge, Blimp-like Craft Near Myakka River State ParkTEN MINUTES BEFORE DEPUTY TAYLOR'S SIGHTING AND BEFORENASA'S TWO MINUTE TIME WINDOW OF 5:01 TO 5:03 AM FOR THEBREAK UP OF THE RUSSIAN BOOSTER, AT LEAST TWOEYEWITNESSES SAW A HUGE BLIMP-LIKE CRAFT. ROBERT RUSSELLWAS DRIVING FROM HIS HOME IN PORT CHARLOTTE, FLORIDA TOWORK IN SARASOTA AT THE FIRST UNITED METHODIST CHURCHWHERE HE IS IN MAINTENANCE. WHAT HE SAW WAS HEADEDSLOWLY WEST TOWARDS THE GULF IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OFDEPUTY TAYLOR'S LIGHT AND NOT FAR FROM THE MYAKKA RIVERSTATE PARK, A NATURE PRESERVE.Robert Russell, Maintenance Employee, First United Methodist Church,Sarasota, Florida: \"It was approximately ten minutes of five on that morning ofthe 7th. I was heading northbound on I-75 heading towards Sarasota, Florida. Iwas between Exits 33 and 35 and I happened to look to my left. I seen what Ithought was a jetliner flying very low. And I thought it was going to crash. So, Ipulled to the right hand side and I jumped out of the truck and watched andlistened. I couldn't hear any noise, but as this thing was flying or hovering, Icould see like a light. It was not fire. It was like light and I could see the outlineof the passenger windows, but I couldn't see any wings. I sort of thought, 'It's nota plane.' So, I thought it might be a blimp flying back from the holidays. We hadjust had the holidays the day before.MEANING LABOR DAY?Right. But there was no noise whatsoever. I couldn't hear no wind hitting thewings of the plane and it was low enough so I should have been able to hear thewhishing of the wind or whatever if the thing had wings.Drawing of large, unidentified aerial object near Myakka River State Parkobserved by Robert Russell from approximately 4:50-4:55 AM en route to Sarasota,Florida on September 7, 1999 © 1999 by Robert Russell."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"IS IT NOW ABSOLUTELY STOCK STILL IN THE AIR OR IS ITMOVING?It was hovering. And it had, I could see that it had a blinking light on the frontand a blinking light on the back. And I know for sure that the back light wasblue blinking.WHAT COLOR BLUE?I guess a...COMPARE IT TO THE SKY.A dark blue.A DARK BLUE LIGHT IN THE BACK.And I think it was a white light in the front, but I'm not very sure on that. It washeading towards the Gulf of Mexico. It was heading I guess you would say west.YOU'RE HEADING WHICH DIRECTION?I was heading north. I looked over to my left and that's where I seen it. It was aglow around this thing also. And they are saying that it was this Russian rocketcoming back into the earth's surface burning. It was not fire. I'm also a retiredfirefighter from Baltimore, Maryland. And I know what fire looks like. And itwas not fire. This was a light.IT HAD GLOW AROUND IT?Right, it had a glow around it.THE COLOR OF THE GLOW AROUND IT WAS WHAT?Like a yellow.A YELLOW GLOW AROUND AN OBJECT THAT WAS LOWENOUGH FOR YOU TO SEE THAT IT HAD A CIGAR SHAPE...Right, it looked like a fuselage of a jetliner.WITHOUT WINGS.Yeah, without wings.YOU COULD SEE WHAT APPEARED TO BE WINDOWS ON THESIDE?Right.DID YOU PULL YOUR CAR OVER TO WATCH THIS?I did.HOW LONG DID YOU WATCH?I was there a good five minutes and it looked like it was just a standstill to apoint, but I could tell it was drifting a little bit. But it wasn't moving as fast asthey are saying these rockets supposed to be burning.THAT SOVIET BREAK UP.Exactly.IT SEEMS LIKE THAT THERE COULD BE POSSIBLY TWO ORMORE EVENTS TAKING PLACE SIMULTANEOUSLY. AND DURINGTHAT PERIOD OF TIME, APPROXIMATELY HOW HIGH DO YOUTHINK IT WAS?I'd say a thousand feet, maybe more. But it's hard to say as dark as it was. But Iwas able to see the passenger, the outline of the diagonal and windows in thisthing.WHAT DID THE WINDOWS LOOK LIKE?OK, they looked like an arched window with an orange-yellowish glow in them.And the glow was coming all around this object flying or floating.YOU HAD AN ORANGE-YELLOWISH GLOW AROUND THIS CIGARSHAPED OBJECT AND YOU SAW WINDOWS ALONG THE SIDE.Approximately three windows."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"WITH ONLY THREE GLOWING WINDOWS THAT WOULD NOT BEA TYPICAL AIRLINER.Right. But then I thought it might have been a blimp.\"A Huge \"Spaceship\"THE SAME TIME THAT ROBERT RUSSELL HAD PULLED OFF THEROAD TO WATCH THE MYSTERIOUS \"BLIMP,\" ANOTHER EYEWITNESSWHO WISHES TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS AND WHOM I WILL CALL\"GERALD,\" WAS A FEW MILES EAST OF THE MYAKKA STATE PARK.FIRST, HE SAW A BRIGHT STAR THAT SUDDENLY SEEMED TO GROWTO THE SIZE OF A SILVER DOLLAR AND THEN SOME HOW BECAMEWHAT GERALD CALLS, \"A HUGE SPACESHIP\" ABOUT 300 FEET FROMHIS PICKUP TRUCK.Gerald (anonymous), Between Arcadia and Sarasota, Florida: \"After Inoticed the little, what I thought was a star at first, and in just a matter of twentyor thirty seconds, here's a spaceship - I'm going to say 300 or 400 feet off to myleft. It was really weird because there was no seeing it coming at a distance. Allof a sudden, it was there, off to my left and in front. When I seen the spaceship,I immediately slowed down and pulled over which didn't take me long because Irun about 50 or 55 mph. I slowed down right away and pulled over.As it comes up to me and is parallel about 300 or 400 feet, there is a big beamof light coming off the back of it. This thing is like it's blimp shaped, only thatpart is covered up looking out the window of my truck. I mean you're looking atsomething that was because I'm used to playing football that was like a footballand a half field long, maybe longer.AT LEAST 600 FEET LONG.It was humongous! And as it's kind of floating down toward me, coming towardme and gets parallel, there's this big beam of light. I'm going to say and it waskind of intense because it was like looking at about six feet in diameter comingoff the back of it to the ground. The light never come towards me or anything,just shining straight down to the ground off the back of the ship.WHAT COLOR WAS THAT BEAM OF LIGHT?Like a regular light bulb type of light only it wasn't, it was a direct, it was like a,it didn't spread out and light things up. It just lit the beam up.IT WAS LIKE A TUBE OF LIGHT?Ye s , m a a m .LIKE THE TUBE WAS LIGHTED WITHIN ITSELF, BUT WAS NOTSHINING OUT ON THE GROUND?I couldn't really tell because about the time it started floating in like that, I hadpulled over I rubbed my eyes to make sure I wasn't, I rubbed my eyes twicethrough this ordeal making sure I was awake! And I was awake.DID THE BLIMP PART EVER GO PHYSICALLY ONTO THEGROUND?No. Never did.HOW HIGH DO YOU THINK IT WAS ABOVE THE GROUND?Probably somewhere 200 to 300 feet.WAS THE BEAM FROM THAT 200 TO 300 FEET EXTENDING ALLTHE WAY DOWN TO THE GROUND?I couldn't really tell if it was hitting the ground or not because there was somebushes along the edge of the road, and I couldn't see, you know, the ground if itwas lit up or what was going on with the ground."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"IN THE BLIMP ITSELF FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER, WHATCOLORS WERE YOU SEEING. DESCRIBE AS MUCH DETAIL ASPOSSIBLE.Well, it was either windows or lights. I'm going to say it was windows, as closeas I was looking at it. And they were running the length of the ship. They were,it seemed like there was four or five feet between each of these narrow lights,like five inches.WERE THEY LONG VERTICAL TYPE WINDOWS?Long horizontal. Five or six of them. All I do know is they were narrow andthey had a blue, hazy light coming out of them. It reminded me kind of likewhen they have dry ice and they have these shows and they have dry ice - thatkind of hazy, blue light coming out of it.IN BETWEEN EACH ONE OF THEM, WAS IT BLACK OR A COLOR?I really can't tell you, because the spaceship was kind of a brown-blackish color.And it all kind of blended. I could see like what would have been rectangulartubing as we see it running on the skin of the ship ever so often. This was allkind of a greenish-black. It looked to me to be part of the structure of the ship. Itwas like we would use it for bracing. What they were using it for, I don't know,but it was, every I would have to sit down and draw it but I was close enoughthat I could see that it was running the length of the ship and there were crosspieces in this that were about the same size.And part of it is that it's so overwhelming, you know. You've got a lot to thinkabout when and when I was sitting there watching the ship, it started driftingtowards me, getting closer. And I thought, 'I don't know about this.' So, then Ikind of pulled back on the road real slow. I didn't take off like I would normallytake off, just kind of took off. And the ship backed off. And as he was backingoff, he must have got about to his original position where he first started out asbeing parallel to me. And then, it was for a split second and this is hard tobelieve the ship was gone. The light was there for like a split second and thatwas it!\"More Information:Blimp Pilot Comments:Andrew Shelton, an aviation maintenance technician, who has piloted a200-foot-long blimp in Florida told me that \"airships do not have any windowson the envelope\" which carries the gas that keeps the blimp aloft. The muchsmaller passenger compartment or gondola is suspended beneath the bottom ofthe cigar-shaped gas envelope. Further, he said that blimps \"will never operate indarkness over residences and a state park because it's too dangerous. If they didhave a mechanical problem and needed to land, they wouldn't be able to select asafe place. Blimpses are easily damaged, so you would not fly one at nightexcept over something like a lighted football stadium.\"He also explained \"there are engines on blimps to help keep them traveling andlanding right. And when they come in, you can hear the engines operating forquite some distance.\"MUFON InvestigationThe complex pattern of events before and after 5 AM EST on September 7,1999 between Tampa and Sarasota is being studied by members of the MutualUFO Network in Florida. Lorraine Gerber is Assistant State Director for FloridaMUFON; Phil Bayly is MUFON's Lead Investigator on the September 7thsightings; and Ann Lieberman is MUFON State Section Director for Sarasotaand Manatee Counties. They would all like to hear from any other eyewitnessesin Central Florida who might have seen unexplained aerial objects around 5 AMon September 7th."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The Central Florida MUFON Hotline phone number is: 727-595-7964.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
