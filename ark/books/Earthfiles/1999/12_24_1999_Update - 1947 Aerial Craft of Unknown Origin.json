Rhodes. The rear curvature inward is very similar to sketches bysome retired military men who claim firsthand knowledge of craft of unknown origin.December 17, 1999 Phoenix, Arizona - After filing the December 8, 1999earthfiles.com report about the similarity between the William A. Rhodes 1947photograph and at least three sketches by former military eyewitnesses of craftof unknown origin, I learned that the handwritten date on my copy ofTheArizona Republic newspaper of July 11 was not correct. A printed copy of theoriginal newspaper was sent to me showing the correct date of July 9, 1947,shown above."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Further, Mr. Rhodes's previous recollection was that he had taken the film to hisfriend in the photography department at the newspaper the night before thephotographs appeared on the front page. However, Roswell investigator andauthor, Don Schmitt, has re-printed in his book UFO Crash At Roswell II aletter written on May 26, 1948 to William Rhodes by Colonel H. M. McCoy,Chief of Intelligence, U.S. Air Force. (See below.) The letter specificallyreferences not only Mr. Rhodes's sighting and photography on July 7, 1947, butanother eyewitness \"on or about the same date as your original sighting byanother civilian in Phoenix.\"Therefore, the correct time sequence seems to be that William A. Rhodes tookthe two photographs at dusk on July 7, 1947 and The Arizona Republicnewspaper published them upside down on July 9, 1947. Those dates have nowbeen corrected on the December 8, 1999 earthfiles.com report.Photograph of final composite model of \"craft of unknown origin\" produced byTim Bauer, Senior Design Director, © 1999 The Franklin Mint, Philadelphia, Pa.More Information:The composite model of \"craft of unknown origin\" was produced by TheFranklin Mint from drawings by Frank Kaufmann, former U.

Senior Mint Design Director, Tim Bauer, worked on the Mint's CADSystem to produce a composite that could be rendered into a die-cast model. It'sperhaps as close as the general public can come to at least one particular type ofaerial craft retrieved from the New Mexico desert in July 1947, pending releaseof true information from government insiders who were ordered to enforce astrict policy of silence and denial.For in-depth documents, images and history about government knowledge andcover-up of these and other crash retrieval events, see my book, Glimpses ofOther Realities, Volumes I and II in Earthfiles Shop.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
