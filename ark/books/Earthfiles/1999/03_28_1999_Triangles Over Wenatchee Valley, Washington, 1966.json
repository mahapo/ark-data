In my book Glimpses of Other Realities, Volume II: High Strangeness(Earthfiles Shop), I reprinted pages from a government document entitledExtraterrestrial Entities and Technology, Recovery and Disposal\" classified TOPSECRET/MAJIC EYES ONLY and dated April 1954 by the U. S. WarDepartment.In a section about different kinds of extraterrestrial craft, the U. S. governmentmanual states: \"Airfoil or triangular shape. This craft is believed to be newtechnology due to the rarity and recency of the observations. Radar indicates anisosceles triangle profile, the longest side being nearly 300 feet in length. Littleis known about the performance of these craft due to the rarity of good sightings,but they are believed capable of high speeds and abrupt maneuvers similar to orexceeding the performance attributed to disc or circular (shaped craft).\"In the past few years, aerial triangles ranging in length from 150 feet to 1.2 mileshave been described by eyewitnesses all over the world. Could some today beadvanced U. S. technology such as the new generation of Aurora craft thatinclude the wedge-shaped Manta? The Manta, however, is said to be small andwould not explain the government's own bafflement in 1954 about mysterioustriangular craft defined in its own document as \"extraterrestrial.\" Nor would1990s technology explain what a woman saw in the night sky over theWenatchee Valley of Washington State in 1966 33 years ago on a camping tripwith her daughter. Both want to remain anonymous, but I am very grateful to themother who is 86 years old now, and was at least willing to tell her remarkablestory in her own words.Interview:86-Year-Old Female (Name Withheld At Her Request) Recalling Nighttime Sighting in Wenatchee Valley of Washington State in 1966: \"The mostincredible thing I've ever seen in my life happened back in 1966 in the fall up inthe high Cascades next to one of the beautiful lakes. And I thought, 'Oh, what inthe world has ever happened to the moon?!' It was the biggest, reddest moon I'dever seen. And it was bright red, fire engine red on the bottom and orange in themiddle and on the top was a real deep pink. And so big. It was so big. And itwas in the saddle of the mountain next to the dip. And I looked back over myshoulder and the moon was still there sailing right along. And I looked back upand thought, 'You have to give me some sign if you are what I think you are.' which I thought was intelligence flying in from outer space. And it stopped deadstill wasn't going fast and it stopped dead still and then it slowly sailed away.Well, from then on, I couldn't sleep. And I looked up in the sky and here werethese big triangles and before the night was over, and I was up for nearly all therest of the night and they would change from fluorescent color to blue to greenand gone so fast you couldn't even blink that fast."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"YOU WERE SEEING TWO, OR HOW MANY OF THESE TRIANGLES?Well, I was concentrating on watching two because these red dots in comparisonto the size of the triangles these red dots look liked they came out of the bottomof the triangles.SO THERE ARE TWO TRIANGLES IN THE SKY AND REDGLOWING DOTS ARE COMING OUT OF BOTH TRIANGLES?Yes, at different times, but I'm going to describe the one furthest to the west andthat's the one I first noticed what was happening. And these dots would comeout and they were fire engine red and I judged them to be in comparison to thesize of the triangle about the size of a fifty cent piece.HOW BIG WAS THE TRIANGLE?I don't know, but the red dots came out and up to ten, one right after the other and they would make what I would call a lazy J because they came down andthey always made a little curve to fly away from the line that was coming down.And they would fly to the west.THESE ARE COMING OUT OF THESE TWO BIG TRIANGLES?No. I'm just concentrating on the one. But they would do that with any trianglein the sky.MEANING THAT THESE RED GLOBES OR CIRCLES YOU WERESEEING AND ARE DESCRIBING NOW ARE COMING OUT OF ONEOF TWO TRIANGLES IN THE SKY?Yeah. The one furthest to the south. And they weren't that far apart. But the oneI was watching so carefully. And they would fly away, but they always camedown and went to the west and then go from there in every direction over thesky. And one of our jets came by, came over, and they followed that the onefollowed that back of it and up over. Not over the top of it, but up where theywouldn't be seen. But they followed it clear across the horizon and then cameback. And came back and the triangles showed up again because they wouldblink on and off and come back.And it flew into the bottom of the triangle in the same place that it had comeout. But this triangle I don't know how many because they disappeared so fastand come back, I don't know if it was the same triangle, but they dispersed thesered -- I called them 'ships,' flying saucers because they were round. They woulddispel so many at a time.LIKE DOZENS?Well, I would say up to ten. But the red dots, the ships, the little dots thatwould go out, would come back one at a time. They didn't come back like allten at once. It seemed like they were scouting or looking for something. Well,that's what I thought they were doing.WHEN THESE RED, ROUND DISCS WOULD FLY OUT OF THEBOTTOM OF THE TRIANGLE AND THEY WOULD DISPERSE,WHAT WOULD THE TRIANGLE DO AFTER THEY HAD LEFT?Well, it would blink and disappear and come back and blink and disappear andcome back. But it always changed colors. It wouldn't disappear until it madethese different colors. And then Bingo! it was gone.THEN IT WOULD POP BACK IN?Then it would come back into sight.THERE IS A SECOND TRIANGLE THAT IS DOING SORT OF THESAME THING?Oh, there were a lot of triangles. They would signal they were signaling backand forth to one another.LIKE WITH BEAMS OF LIGHT?Yeah. And the little red dots put out just as big a beam as the big triangles. Andit was just like they were holding a conference. It was terrific!AS YOU LAY THERE WATCHING ALL OF THIS, WHAT WENT"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"THROUGH YOUR MIND?I think I was so excited. I wasn't even thinking about what was going through mymind. I was Oh, I think I was so blessed to be able to see that. I think I was oneof the most privileged people. And granted, I was so afraid when I realized whenit first started that it wasn't of this earth because as human beings we are socrazed for power that I figured what did come through my mind was I figuredthat it would have to be from outer space because any country in this world thathad that power, that speed, back at that time would have, could have controlledthe earth and they would have. I'm sure they would have because that was thefastest thing I've ever seen and the most fantastic. And it went for all night.ALL NIGHT?After they got through with their formation, then they went back like they were -not so much searching, maybe they were getting information or whatever. But itwas absolutely wonderful!The next day, we were going up over the ridge and we hit a mountain meadow.And I said, 'Oh, look at this! Look at this circle. And the grass in the meadowhad been I would say it was anyway 12 feet across in diameter. It was allcrushed down and she said, 'Oh, that's just where the deer slept.' I said, 'Oh, butthey don't sleep in a perfect circle.' And I said, 'By the way, where are all thefootprints for the deer?' And she said, 'Come on! Come on! Let's get out of here!'She wouldn't talk to me about this trip.LIKE YOUR DAUGHTER WAS NERVOUS?I think she was scared.DID YOU THINK ABOUT THOSE RED DISCS THAT YOU HAD SEENCOMING OUT OF THE TRIANGLE?Did I think of them? Yes, I did and I hoped I would see somebody. But I didn'tsee anything other than what I told you.Then the next night, when we got into bed it began a misty rain and I looked upin the sky and there were two of those triangles doing like I've seen airplanes doa dogfight dashing at one another but I didn't see any red dots that time.DID YOU HAVE ANY IMPRESSION ABOUT WHETHER THETRIANGLES DASHING AT EACH OTHER WERE IN CONFLICT ORWHAT?I didn't think about conflict. More, I thought if they were as fast as they couldmove, surely one could have gotten the other. But they moved at such speed.But they changed lights, too.MEANING COLORS?Colors, yeah.WAS IT LIKE SORT OF PULSING AND CHANGING FROM GREENTO BLUE TO YELLOW TO WHITE SORT OF?Yes, but it was more like it was from I thought of it as white because when I firstsaw them the night before it went from like a fluorescent colored light, notwhite, but like fluorescent. And then it would go blue and then green or greenand blue, whichever. It made three definite changes of color and then it was outof sight.THE WHOLE TRIANGLE WOULD PULSE A DIFFERENT COLORAND THEN THE WHOLE TRIANGLE WOULD CHANGE COLORAGAIN?It would pulse the three colors and disappear. And when it wanted to, it wouldcome back. And I tell you, it is the experience of my lifetime. Now, I thought itwas absolutely wonderful to have my children, my babies, the miracle of that.But it's different. It's one of the things I feel blessed with.YOU DIDN'T FEEL ANY FEAR?Well, not after I got over the first shock, no.BUT THE FIRST NIGHT YOU WERE A LITTLE AFRAID?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"When I first realized that it wasn't from this earth.\"More Information:Fiery orange-red discs were also associated with animal mutilation cases fromthe end of the 1960s on.I would appreciate information from anyone in military, intelligence or civilianwork who might have more information.
