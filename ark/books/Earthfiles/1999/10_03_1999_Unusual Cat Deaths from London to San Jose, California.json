And usually without blood at the site.Since at least the 1970s, a similar pattern of cat mutilations has been reported inVancouver, British Columbia; Falls Church, Virginia; Lee, New York; LosAlamos, New Mexico; Ahwatakee Foothills, Arizona; Oklahoma City,Oklahoma; Florida; Tustin, California and now this year since May - in SanJose, California where two dozen cats, a raccoon and a rat have been founddisemboweled, cut in half and oddly skinned.Some historic background: In 1978 in St. Catharines near Toronto, Canada,authorities were frustrated by more than 100 missing cats and dogs and manyothers found in their owners' yards skinned, decapitated, disemboweled, cut inhalf or paws removed, without blood at the site. The New York Times Report About Mutilated CatsTen years later on August 13, 1989, The New York Times reported about 67 catsfound mutilated in Tustin, California - a suburb of Los Angeles near Santa Ana.The NYT wrote:\"Some of them were cut in half with what some say is almost surgicalprecision, others disemboweled or skinned. One resident said, 'Thereis never any blood at the scene, the animals are often dismemberedwith surgical precision and paws and other body parts are often lefton the ground in strikingly similar arrangements. No one ever seemsto hear anything, nor do dogs bark during the killing.' It was believedthe cats are captured, taken elsewhere, their blood drained andorgans removed, then replaced on their owners' lawns.\"Cycles of cat mutilations have re-occurred in Tustin and in Plano, Texas anaffluent suburb north of Dallas. In 1991, 1993 and again the past couple ofyears, police received dozens of reports about cats found cut in half, usuallywith the front half near the owners' yards or sidewalks. Plano Police DetectiveMike Box also had missing reports on more than 80 domestic house cats thatwore collars and I. D. tags, but were never found. Detective Box investigatedsatanic cult activities, but could not find any evidence that connected them tothe mutilated and missing cats and other animals such as dogs."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Half-cat photographed by Plano, Texas Police Officerfor Incident Report No. 91-44994, August 31, 1991.In 1992-1993, Vancouver, British Columbia had a rash of cats found cut in half- usually the front half was found on the owner's lawn. The Supervisor ofAnimal Control for the Vancouver City Pound told reporters, \"The cats areclearly being butchered by someone. It's a real surgical job. And all I hope isthat these cats were already dead when they were cut in half.\" At the time duringthose rash of cat mutiilations in Vancouver, I was working with pathologist andhematologist John Altshuler, M. D., in Denver, Colorado. We were able toobtain one of the half cats - the front half - for analysis of the abdominalexcision. Dr. Altshuler confirmed that the entire excision had been cut withsomething hot enough to cook the collagen and hemoglobin.By September 15, 1999, the San Jose Mercury newspaper headlined \"Cat killermenaces southern San Jose.\" The article began, \"A killer is stalking the cats ofsouthern San Jose, mutilating 21 felines since May 31 - primarily pets takenfrom owners' yards at night and returned dead, often dismembered and skinned.\"More than 2,000 fliers were distributed by police into south San Joseneighborhoods warning owners to keep their cats indoors. And the HumaneSociety of Santa Clara Valley posted a cash reward that has kept growing asanimals have been discovered. It's now more than $20,000.The Director of Animal Services for the Santa Clara Humane Society, MarciaMayeda, talked to me recently about what has happened so far.Interview:Marcia Mayeda, Director of Animal Services for the Santa Clara HumaneSociety, San Jose, California: \"The first case happened around May 30 or 31,although it wasn't reported to us until the end of June when we had found threecats within just a two day period that had been mutilated and disemboweled andreturned to their owner's property and left on the front lawn - either the owner'sor the next door neighbor's. When that happened, this person whose cat waskilled in May like that called us and said the same thing had happened to theircat.Since then, we've had a total of 22 animals, all cats, except for one rat and oneraccoon that have been mutilated and killed and in most cases the cats havebeen returned to their owner's property for them to find.COULD YOU GIVE A DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRST CAT, EXACTLYWHAT WAS EXCISED?The internal organs were removed as well as the lower portion of the body. Theanimal was severed in half and the upper torso and the front legs and the headremained.THE BACK HALF WAS GONE?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Right.THE INTERNAL ORGANS, INCLUDING THE HEART, WASREMOVED FROM THE UPPER HALF?Yes, that was all removed.IN TERMS OF BLEEDING, WAS THERE ANY BLOOD?No, when we found the animals, it became quite obvious that they were beingkilled somewhere else because where they were returned there was no blood,there was no hair lying around, no signs that any of this happened there. So,we're confident that the animals are kidnapped and taken somewhere else wherethis is done and then they are returned. Also, it's a pretty significant undertakingwith what they have done with the animals and there would certainly be a lot ofnoise and people would see this happening.HOW DO YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE GETTING INTO PEOPLES'YARDS AND GETTING THESE CATS AND RETURNING THEMWITHOUT BEING SEEN?Well, it's very easy to get the cats. People allow their cats to go outside and catsnormally will lay on the front yard, front porch, maybe wander over to theneighbor's house. So, it's really easy to grab one. It's not like they're going intothe back yards to get the animal.Our volunteers have been out in those neighborhoods passing out fliers toinform people to keep their pets inside and it's amazing how many stray cats oreven owned cats are just running loose they come across. And it's very easy forthem to pick them up and take them if they wanted to.HAVE ALL THE CATS BEEN RETURNED TO FRONT YARDS?No, not all the cats have been returned to their owners. We don't have ownerson every single cat, and probably three-fourths of the cases we do. What hasalso happened - they may have been returned to the next-door neighbors butwhat we believe has happened is that those cats have hung out at theirneighbor's house as well as the owner's house. Cats will typically pick 3 or 4houses area for their territory. The animals are probably taken from that site, sothat's why they were returned to that site instead of next door.BUT HAS IT ALWAYS BEEN IN FRONT YARDS?Yeah, it's always been in front yards.IN TERMS OF DEMOGRAPHICS, THE PARTICULARNEIGHBORHOOD - HAS THIS BEEN FOCUSED IN ANEIGHBORHOOD THAT WAS 3 X 10 BLOCKS, A TIGHT NARROWAREA?Well, it's San Jose, but it's mostly the suburban area. It's not a really big city inthe sense that there aren't high rises. It's a residential area and there's a main roadthat's called Almaden Expressway that is a kind of main thoroughfare for thatarea and most of these have happened along Almaden, like a block, or two in, sowe think what's happening is that whoever is doing this is familiar with the area.We're really perplexed about who is doing this and why? At first we thought itwas satanic related, and I guess that's still possible.BUT SO FAR NO ONE HAS COME UP WITH ANY EVIDENCE TOLINK IT TO ANYTHING, RIGHT?Right. Not that we're aware of.WHEN WAS YOUR MOST RECENT MUTILATION REPORT?This morning we had a rat - and it was dismembered in the same way that all thecats had been done. Previous to this, we had two cats a week ago Monday sothat would be on the 13th.OF SEPTEMBER. SO WITH THIS RAT ON SEPT. 21ST, IT'S STILL ANONGOING PHENOMENON...Ye s .YOU HAVE NO LEADS?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Right.NO REAL EVIDENCE?Right.ONLY THESE MUTILATED BODIES?Right.WHAT HAPPENED TO THE RAT?The rat was decapitated, but the head was still there and the body was still thereand the internal organs were removed and it looked like it was partially skinned.NOW WHEN YOU SAY IT WAS DECAPITATED BUT THE HEAD WASSTILL THERE, DO YOU MEAN THAT IT HAD BEEN CUT OFF ANDLAID NEXT TO THE BODY?Ye s .NO BLOOD?No, not really.WAS THERE ANY BRAIN TISSUE IN THE SKULL?It looked like it would have been. We don't look for it, but the skull was stillintact and down toward the neck was still connected, so I don't see how theycould have removed it.\"More Information:If you have information to share or want to learn more about protecting pets,here are some numbers to call.A 24-hour hot line for tips and information leading to the capture of theSan Jose cat mutilator has been established by the Humane Society ofSanta Clara Valley.Call: (408) 727-6529 for round-the-clock dispatch.To contact San Jose police investigators, call: (408) 277-4161.For information about how to train your outdoor cat to become an indoorcat, contact the Society's Animal Behaviorist Help Line at: (408)727-3383, Ext. 753.For information on what neighborhood groups can do to organize and thelink between animal cruelty and human violence, call the Humane Societyof the United States at (888) 213-0958.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
