The Environmental Protection Agency maintains an inventory of morethan 38,000 uncontrolled waste sites. Those include 1,400 on the NationalPriorities List (NPL) - which are abandoned waste storage or treatment plantsand mining and weapons manufacturing facilities. Those 1400 sites pose thegreatest threat to public health and the environment. The projected cleanupcosts for these NPL sites using existing physical and chemical methods will beapproximately $750 billion. That's nearly one trillion dollars.A University of Pennsylvania plant biochemist, Philip Rea, Ph.D., recently madea breakthrough discovery that isolated the plant gene in a particular plant(Arabiodopsis thaliana shown below) that encourages the plant to soak uptoxins. He and his research team at the University's Plant Science Institute hopeto make this gene work for them in genetically enhanced plants such as sugarbeets and potatoes to try out at one or more toxic waste sites to see howefficiently soil can be cleaned up. If the plants are successful, the cost ofdetoxifying soils could be lowered from nearly a trillion dollars to the millions.Instead of literally digging up tons of soil to be chemically scrubbed and buriedsomewhere else, the plants could take up most soil contaminants, neutralize thepoisons internally, and then be harvested for safe disposal. This new approachto toxic waste clean up is called \"phytoremediation.\"Photo Credit: Arabidopsis thaliana by Philip Rea, Ph.D., Univ. ofPennsylvania."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I asked Dr. Rea how plants can take in lethal poisons such as cadmium, arsenic,lead and mercury and not be poisoned themselves.Interview:Philip Rea, Ph.D., Prof. of Biology, University of Pennsylvania, PlantScience Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: \"Actually that's the thing thatgot us interested in these various processes. The one thing you have toappreciate when you think about a plant is that plant cells have a very largeinternal reservoir and that reservoir is what is called the vacuole. And that's acompartment that is surrounded by a filtration device, if you will, which is thevacuole membrane. And plants can have a massive capacity for accumulatinghigh levels of toxic materials, providing those toxic materials are dumped intothe vacuole. So, you can think of the vacuole as an intracellular, internal landfillwithin the plant cell. And providing those bad materials are kept within thatcompartment, kept away from the bulk of the machinery that does metabolism inplant cells, the plant cells are able to accumulate those materials, but not sufferthe toxic action of those materials themselves.And the important thing about what we've been working on is that the heavymetals when they get into the plant cell - there are two things that happen tothem - one is that the heavy metals are immobilized, they are bound, soaked upby sponge-like materials, these phytochelatins, and then the phytochelatins plusthe heavy metals that are bound to them - those phytochelatins are then dumpedinto this intracellular landfill, they are dumped into the vacuole. So, the plantcell has at least two levels of protection - one is the binding of the heavy metalto the phytochelatin which in itself makes a major contribution to detoxification.Then the second step is the dumping of the heavy metals plus the phytochelatininto the vacuole. And the vacuole - this intracellular landfill in many matureplant cells - represents between 40% and 70% of the total volume of that cell.So, that's a massive capacity. If you are looking at an herbaceous plant sitting onyour window sill, some 40% to 70% of the volume of that plant is representedby vacuola material. Or another way of looking at it is that every time you biteinto an apple or you squeeze the juice of an orange, more than 90% of thevolume that you are consuming when you do that is material that has been keptin the vacuole.WHAT YOU WOULD TRY TO DO IN YOUR WORK IS TO ENHANCE THEGENETIC ABILITY TO EXPAND THAT VACUOLE ABSORPTION EVENFURTHER?Precisely. To enhance the chemistry that enables things to be transported intothat vacuole. Yes, that's it exactly.IF YOU ARE SUCCESSFUL, THEN YOU WOULD ENVISION THATPLANTS SUCH AS SUGAR BEETS AND POTATOES COULD BE PLANTEDWHEREVER THERE WAS A TOXIC WASTE SITE, ABSORB AS MUCH OFTHE TOXIC METALS AND POISONS AS POSSIBLE, AND THEN SIMPLYBE HARVESTED SORT OF THE WAY WE MIGHT MOW GRASS ANDCATCH IT IN A CATCHER AND THROW IT AWAY?Ye s .THIS GENETIC DISCOVERY IS QUITE RECENT IN YOUR WORK?Yes, yes. Only the last few months, yes.BUT YOU WERE TRYING TO SEE IF YOU COULD ISOLATE SUCH AGENE FOR EXACTLY THIS APPLICATION TO CLEAN UP TOXIC WASTESITES?We were not. What we were looking for were genetic regulatory elements that"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"change the level of expression of other genes in response to heavy metals. Weweren't actually going after the gene encoding the enzyme that is responsible forthe heavy metal detoxification. So, our discovery really was a spin-off ofsomething related, but not something that was directed specifically at cloningthe gene for this enzyme.WHEN YOU REALIZED THAT YOU HAD STUMBLED ON TO THISPOSSIBLE OTHER APPLICATION, WHAT DO YOU DO AS A SCIENTISTTO DEVELOP THIS RESEARCH FURTHER INTO PRACTICALAPPLICATION IN THE WORLD?OK, the first thing we did, of course, was we patented the discovery. And thenext stage is really to look at whether, to determine the best way to engineer thegene into plants such that it has maximum capacity to remove the heavy metal.That actually - there has been a lot of down time in trying to get the gene in thefirst place. As I said, it's taken a long time in so far as people have not beensuccessful until very recently. The next stage, I think, will be an equally lengthyprocess and that is finding appropriate plants to use the genes in.THIS GENE DISCOVERY THAT YOU HAVE - IF YOU CAN ENHANCE ITSABILITY, IT WOULD NOT ONLY TAKE TOXIC METALS OUT OF THESOIL SUCH AS CADMIUM AND SOME OF THE MORE TOXIC LIKEMERCURY AND LEAD - NOT ONLY TAKE IT OUT OF THE SOIL, BUTTHEN BE ABLE TO NEUTRALIZE THAT TOXICITY WITHIN THE PLANTITSELF.Yes. The mode of detoxification is one in which the toxin is bound - there is nochemical modification of the toxin other than its binding to thesephytochelatins. And the ability of the plant to withstand the heavy metal and theability of the plant to hyper-accumulate the heavy metal go hand in hand. Inother words, hyper-accumulators have increased resistance to the heavy metalby virtue of their ability to bind the heavy metal.YOU CAN'T ENVISION THAT THE PLANTS THEMSELVES IN THESESPECIAL CONDITIONS WOULD DIE FROM THE ABSORPTION OFMERCURY, LEAD OR CADMIUM?I think provided that they are able to manufacture enough phytochelatin - andthere doesn't seem to be an upper limit on that.HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO MEASURE HOW MUCH TOXIC MATERIALCAN BE TAKEN, LET'S SAY, OUT OF A SQUARE FOOT OR SQUAREYARD OF SOIL BY THESE PLANTS?That's the next step. We haven't done that.WHAT DO YOU PROJECT?My prediction is that we probably can get the levels of the heavy metals downby a factor of approximately 100. If we can push it any lower, I'm not sure.YOU MEAN 100%?A hundred fold. A hundred times lower than the prevailing, initialconcentration.WHICH WOULD TAKE IT DOWN NEARLY TO ZERO?Which would take it down to levels that are far more tolerable.HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE BEFORE YOU WILLACTUALLY HAVE VIABLE APPLICATION OF SOME GENETICALLYENGINEERED PLANTS TO TRY OUT AT A TOXIC SPILL SITES?I would say two years.TWO YEARS."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Yes. The key thing here is to use plants to remove heavy metals is very cheap bycomparison to the standard procedure. And the sort of state of the art, thestandard procedure, is basically to dig the soil up and take it to a remote site andscrub it with acids and high temperature.WHICH STILL LEAVES SOME TOXICITY WHERE IT'S BURIED.Ye s .AND THIS WAY, IF YOU ARE SUCCESSFUL, YOU WILL END UP USINGPLANTS TO CLEAN POISONS OUT OF THE SOIL ALMOST 100%.To a high degree.\"More Information:The funding to continue this work with the gene (phytochelatin synthaseprotein) that encourages plants to detoxify heavy metals from soil is provided bythe National Science Foundation, Department of Energy and the U.
