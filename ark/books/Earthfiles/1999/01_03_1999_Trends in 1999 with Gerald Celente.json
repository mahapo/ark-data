He also warned that new viruses and bacteriacould cause pandemics like the 1918 swine flu. Soon after that interview,millions of chickens in Hong Kong had to be killed to prevent a new and lethalvirus spreading among poultry. Then Southeast Asia and Russia defaulted onloans and the stock market plunged downward.So, I asked Gerald Celente recently about trends in 1999: Interview:Gerald Celente, Editor, The Trends Journal, Rhinebeck, New York: \"Youwon't forget 1999! It's going to be a year of panic and parties. We're going to seepanic on Wall Street as a Mad Cow Dow acts convulsively. But at the end, theFederal Reserve will bail it out. At the same time, it's going to be a big year ofpartying as America and the world begin to count down to the Millennium.WE'VE GOT THE EURO DOLLAR BEGINNING TO COME ON TOTHE SCENE IN EUROPE WITH ALL THESE OTHER CHANGES ANDI WAS CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR TRENDS JOURNAL STATEMENT:By the end of 1999, the stock market will rebound, the dollar will stabilize andEuro Power will increase as the world rings in the New Millennium with themother of all parties.'WHY DO YOU THINK THE GLOBE CAN ACCOMMODATE GOINGFROM THE DEPTHS TO SUCH STABILITY IN 1999?Well, we say stability in the sense that the market will have finished its wildgyrations. The Federal Reserve, as it did in 1998, is again going to lower interestrates to accommodate Wall Street. Let's remember that interest rates werelowered three times in 1998 -- not because of any signals of weakness in theeconomy, but rather a Dow Jones that was suffering from over-speculation.Well, in 1999, as the market begins to tremble and a Mad Cow Dow willrampage the market with convulsions that will be uncontrollable, the FederalReserve will again run to the rescue. And they are going to lower interest rates.Now, when that happens, you are going to see a lot more foreign companies andcountries put their money into the Euro currency. And there is a reason for it.Europe is going to look in many ways a lot more monetarily and fiscallyresponsible than the U. S. So, we don't want to be gloom and doomers andpredict depression and recession. So, we are saying somewhat cautiously thattimes are going to be rocky this year, but we've learned from past experience thatanything that can be done to re-inflate the market will be done by the FederalReserve.WHY IS IT THAT YOU THINK THE BRAND NEW EURO DOLLARWOULD BE MORE SOUGHT AFTER THAN THE ALMIGHTY U. S."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"DOLLAR?Well, we don't think it will be more sought after, but we do think it will be astrong complementary alternative.THAT THE TWO COMBINED MAY BRING SOME KIND OFSYNERGISTIC STABILITY?Exactly. Because now you're not only relying on the dollar for strength. Youalso have a strong Euro. And we do believe the Euro will be in the first fewyears - I want to clarify this - a pretty strong currency. Remember, it is comingunder the direction of Germany and the Bundesbank in the past has shown a lotof monetary responsibility.REMEMBER THAT THE MAJOR NEWS MAGAZINES ONLY ABOUTTWO OR THREE MONTHS AGO TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THEFALL OF 1998 HAD BIG HEADLINES SAYING THE CRASH OF 1999.NOW, THOSE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE FROM ECONOMIC INSIDERPOINT OF VIEW - THAT 1999 COULD BE A FULL BLOWNDEPRESSION COLLAPSE.We don't see that coming. In the absence of some kind of unforeseen globalevent that nobody can predict - but given market conditions the way they are,we don't see a global collapse. And I'll tell you why. There is right now a sensethat there is over production and over capacity and over-population. That meansthat you can produce and we have produced more product than we'll ever need -computers, shirts, cars and anything else in between. Over capacity means thatwe can produce more. And over population means that you could pick up theroots of any corporation and move it to any place in the country for the cheapestand less regulated restrictions that you can possibly imagine. So you get cheaphelp and you don't have to worry about adjusting your manufacturing to anykind of regulatory process.All this means that you're not going to see inflation come about. There is goingto be downward pressure actually on prices. It also means that it's going to put adampening on this high flying, over speculating casino market fever that isgripping the nation. So, in some ways, capitalism - love it or hate it - is going todo what it's supposed to do and that is to react against over-speculation.However, when the economists look at this and they see a decline in the DowJones Industrials, they think the world has come to an end.YET IN YOUR TOP TEN TRENDS OF 1999, YOU START WITH\"COMPASSION\" ON PAGE ONE. COMPASSION, THE WAY YOU AREDEFINING IT, IS?Well, it is multi-definitional in terms that people understanding that we're not inthis alone. And that all things are connected. And you are responsible for youractions. And that no one system can expect to stand on its own because of thenew and growing understanding that it's a tightly integrated and intricate system.RIGHT. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY Y2K IN THE FUTURESEEMS SO OMINOUS BECAUSE THE WORLD IS SOINTERCONNECTED AND IF EVERY ONE HAS NOT GOT ALL THEIRSOFTWARE AND HARDWARE FIXED BY NEW YEARS OF 1999 TO2000, IT COULD BE HOW SERIOUS?You made it very clear. If one link on the chain breaks, the entire system falls.Go back to 1998 and look at some of the events that happened. We saw theGalaxy IV Satellite went out this year in May. When it went out, 80% of thenation's pagers and other data processing operations went out with it. We sawjust a few months ago a cable being broke in San Francisco and the entire areabeing put out of electricity. So, Y2K you can multiply times probably a coupleof thousand. We anticipate by the way that Y2K will be chaotic and confusing,but it won't be the end of the world. And in a relatively short amount of time,things will be back to pretty normal. Having said that, remember that Y2K istaking about a trillion dollars out of the economy. And will probably takeanother trillion out later on.IN TERMS OF ALL THESE EFFORTS TO TRY TO REPAIR THE"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE THAT IS GOING TO BRING THECOMPUTERS DOWN.Exactly. And that's money that's lost. That's like going into any productiveendeavor. This is spending money to correct a problem.GIVEN THAT WHICH WILL AFFECT THE YEAR 2000, YOU ARESEEING THAT THE YEAR 1999 MIGHT NOT BE AS BADFINANCIALLY AS MAY HAVE BEEN PREDICTED IN 1998. YOUALSO HAVE ON YOUR TREND LIST A COMMENT ABOUT WHATYOU CALL THE SWING CYCLE.' CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT?It's interesting. All of a sudden swing music is becoming very popular. And it'snot only popular among older people, but younger people are embracing it aswell. And we're asking ourselves: What is it that is turning people onto swing?WHICH GOES BACK TO THE 1930S ORIGINALLY.Exactly. And what was going on in the 1930s? The nation was in its worsedepression probably ever. And the world was on the eve of a global war. Andsimultaneously, we ask ourselves, Are people tuning out the hard edgednegativity of rock and rap and looking for an alternative? And the conclusionwe've come to is probably a little bit of both. And that people are reading in thetea leaves of today an ominous future and they just want to have fun. So swingmusic - while it is not a chart topper - is really a symbol of what is going on.DO YOU PERSONALLY SENSE THAT THE MILLENNIUM MIGHTBRING SOME KIND OF HUGE CHANGE COSMICALLY, EARTHCHANGE, WAR OR OTHER?I don't know cosmically. But no one can really say in terms -- is it by accident?Or is it by cosmic design that never before have so many people lost faith in somany institutions that are failing and topping around us. We don't have to lookmuch further than politics and government, but you can. You can look at thehealth care system. Or education. You can look at the traditional family. Ortraditional religions. You can look at corporations or the legal system.OR THE ENVIRONMENT.Oh! Of course!WHICH IS ON YOUR LIST UNDER \"ENVIRONMENTAL MIRACLEGROW.\"That's right. This is going to be a good year for the environment because Al Goreis going to be the front runner of the Democratic party. Gore will look like achampion all dressed in green when compared to the Republicans. So that is thecard he is going to play. Because you are going to get a lot of coverage betweennow and 2000 on the presidential race, the environment is going to be in theforefront. That in turn will push corporations and people to recognize again thatGreen Power is strong.YOU HAVE CUBA ON YOUR TOP TEN TRENDS LIST FOR 1999.WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN THERE?Well, we're going to see major steps toward normalization between the U. S. andCuba. We are forecasting that because U. S. companies have lost their marketpower in emerging nations like Asia and Russia, they are now looking ateconomic growth that is occurring in Cuba - that is equal, by the way, inpercentage terms to U. S. growth - about 3.5% in 1998. So there are new marketopportunities.SO, THE IRONY IS THAT FIDEL CASTRO WHO WANTED HISISLAND TO BE AN EXAMPLE OF COMMUNISM, IS -- AS WE GOINTO 1999 -- BEING LOOKED AT AS A POSSIBLE PRIMECANDIDATE FOR ENLARGING OUR CAPITALISTIC TRADE IN THEUNITED STATES?Exactly. We'll flood them with money and tourists. And they'll export cigars,baseball players and rum.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"More Information:Rounding out his forecast of more trade with Cuba, politics to save theenvironment, more compassion in global interdependence and dancing to swingbands in New Years Eve 2000 celebrations, despite Y2K, Celente also thinksone or more political candidates might try campaigning only on the Internet ...that the Republicans and Democrats might get serious challenges from newprogressive libertarians... that corporate downsizings will increase as economicrecession spreads globally in spite of the Euro Dollar and Federal Reserve'scontinuing help to Wall Street. And that the very young born after 1980 wholive and breathe computers will fill high tech jobs better than their elders.
