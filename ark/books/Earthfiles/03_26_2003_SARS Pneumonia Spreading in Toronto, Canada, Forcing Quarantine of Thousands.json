But this is an incident of unprecedented scope and magnitude.\" - Dr. Sheela Basrur, Scarborough Grace Hospital, Toronto, Canada March 26, 2003 Toronto, Ontario, Canada - The SARS pneumonia microbe is spreading rapidly and two patients have died of the s evere a cute r espiratory s yndrome after treatment at the Scarborough Grace Hospital. The government has designated the illness a \"reportable, communicable and virulent disease\" under the Health Protection and Promotion Act, which lets officials quarantine people against their will. Today Ontario Health Minister, Tony Clement, announced a \"health emergency\" that requires enforced quarantine under the province's emergency powers legislation. Everyone who visited Toronto's Scarborough Hospital since March 16, should remain in their homes for ten days. The reason is that medical experts are now worrying that the SARS disease can spread not only from cough and sneeze droplets, but through the air the way influenza spreads. The hospital closed its emergency department to all new patients on March 24, trying to limit public exposure to the still unidentified pathogen. Scarborough's Dr. Sheela Basrur said, \"We realize this is a substantial amount of people. This number will be in the thousands. But this is an incident of unprecedented scope and magnitude.\" Basrur said those who don't comply can be forced to do so by court order. The cases have tripled since March 24 with 27 patients in Ontario, one in Vancouver and three people in all have died. Police and citizens are wearing surgical face masks and Toronto's supply is nearly gone.

A central command has been set up to work 24 hours around the clock to co-ordinate all information from hospitals and health workers. Increasing the worry about air transmission of the SARS pneumonia are three kindergarten students at a Toronto elementary school near Scarborough Grace Hospital that became ill with undiagnosed fever, but none of the children had come in contact with people suspected of infection. The elementary school has been closed until at least Monday. China - Source of SARS Syndrome The SARS outbreak was carried to Toronto by a person who had taken a business trip to Hong Kong and died of the SARS disease on March 5. Health Canada has urged Canadians planning trips to the most affected parts of Southeast Asia to defer travel for the time being. Those areas are Hanoi, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Guangdong province in China and Singapore, which has also enforced a quarantine on more than 750 people exposed to SARS patients. Even though the W. H. O. international SARS case numbers have not officially changed yet, China is reporting 1323 SARS cases and 49 deaths. As of March 26, 2003 United States Suspected SARS pneumonia cases in the United States have climbed to 45 in 20 states.
