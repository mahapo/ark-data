J uly 1, 2003 Update: Paige Catt reports that “someone from St. Louis tested the soil in the Knobel fractal formation ... and found LOTS of magnetic particles. At first, Todd (Young, farmer) was real sceptical, but where the circles were, was the only place the magnetic particles were found.” She also reports that the camera she used to take the photographs no longer works and she wonders if the electronic Sony was somehow damaged by energies still in the atmosphere when she and her father flew over the formation. J une 13, 2003 Knobel, Arkansas - Long shadows were pointing across crop fields late Saturday afternoon, June 7, when Bruce Catt and his daughter, Caleigh, were flying over farmer Todd Young's 150-acre wheat field. Caleigh had a camera and took four photographs of ten circles crisply laid down in clockwise swirls amid the standing wheat. It is a fractal pattern similar to one in Canada a couple of years ago and reported at Earthfiles , which had eleven circles instead of ten.

One at Windmill Hill near Avebury in 1996 covered a thousand feet in diameter with 194 circles in spiral arms. T riple Julia Set discovered July 29, 1996, at Windmill Hill, Wiltshire, England near Avebury, the largest circle and avenue of standing sarsen stones in the British Isles, constructed around 3700 B. C. for spiritual rituals. This fractal formation of 194 circles spiraled for 1,000 feet in diameter. Aerial © 1996 by Steve Alexander. After Bruce Catt told Todd about the unusual crop formation in his wheat, Young went out to the field to see for himself on the ground and he also took an airplane ride to see it from the air. Interview: T odd Young, Farmer, Knobel, Arkansas: “I thought it was extraordinary and really didn't know what to think. I've heard of crop circles, but this was the first I ever did see. I BELIEVE THAT IN ONE OF THE BAXTER BULLETIN ISSUES, IT QUOTES YOU AS SAYING THAT IT WAS ‘EERIE.’ I WONDERED IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN THAT? Yeah, when you see something in your field that doesn't belong and I have control of everything that is in my field because for the most part, it's odd seeing what Mother Nature or something else or somebody else did in your field. COULD YOU DESCRIBE EXACTLY WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING AT WHEN YOU SAW THIS FORMATION FROM THE AIR?

Circle Dimensions Yes, there are ten circles. The biggest being in the center, which is 47 feet wide. In the outer three (on three different slightly curving arms), the next biggest one is 28 feet circle, the next one is 17 feet and the smallest circles are 9 feet. We also did measure from the center of the smallest circle to the center of the largest on all three (arms) and all were within a foot, roughly 86 feet. It could have been closer than that. It's hard to measure. WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT THESE WERE LAID OUT VERY PRECISELY? Very symmetrical, very precise, yes. WHEN YOU WALKED INTO THE CIRCLES ON THE GROUND THE VERY FIRST TIME, DID YOU GET DOWN AND LOOK AT ANY OF THE STEMS TO SEE HOW THEY WERE BENT DOWN TO THE GROUND? K nobel , Arkansas w heat formati on. Aerial photograph © 2003 by Caleigh Catt. No Stake Marks or Tracks Yes, I did. Obviously I was very skeptical at first and looked at the center point of each circle, looking for something like a stake driven into the ground or something disturbed in the very center of the circles and did not find anything. WHAT ABOUT TRACKS OF ANY KIND? I had a drain pipe going through one of the circles, and I could not see any tracks whatsoever. It's possible somebody could have walked the drain pipe, but between the circles was about seven feet of standing straw and no visibility of anything, no traffic between them. DID THE CIRCLES SEEM EXTREMELY NEAT AND PRISTINE, LIKE LAID DOWN VE RY NEATLY? Oh, most certainly. No straw was standing within the circles and they were all clockwise formations. EVERY SINGLE CIRCLE WAS CLOCKWISE? Yes, all ten. WAS THE WAY THE STEMS WERE LAID DOWN THE SAME FROM CIRCLE TO CIRCLE? Ye s . COULD YOU SEE ANY DIFFERENCES AT THE CENTERS OF THE CIRCLES? No, none whatsoever. WERE THEY ALL SWIRLED FLAT AT THE CENTER OF THE CIRCLES?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Right. DO YOU KNOW IF ANY OF YOUR NEIGHBORS OR ANYONE HAS REPORTED TO YOU SEEING ANY MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS? No. THE FORMATION WAS THERE IN YOUR FIELD ON SATURDAY, SUNDAY AND THEN WHEN DID YOU HARVEST? Tuesday (June 10) I completed may harvest. DID YOU HARVEST ALL THIS WHEAT INTO YOUR COMBINE ALONG WITH ALL THE REST OF THE WHEAT? Ye s . AND THAT WHEAT WILL GO TO? Goes to a coop granary here. WHAT KIND OF CONVERSATIONS HAVE YOU HAD WITH YOUR FAMILY AND NEIGHBORS ABOUT THOSE TEN CIRCLES OUT THERE? Well, just like you and I. I don't know what caused them. I don't know how they got there. Probably we'll never be 100% convinced how they got there or what happened. Nobel, Arkansas is a town of 200 people. We have a little grocery store and care and farm store, and that's pretty much it. IS IT TRUE YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN THAT VERY FARM ON FRIDAY AND THERE DEFINITELY WAS NO FORMATION THERE ON FRIDAY? I did fly over it myself and no, there was none. SO, FOR SURE THE EARLIEST THE FORMATION WAS THERE WAS SATURDAY, JUNE 7, AND THAT WAS SEEN BY BRUCE CATT? Correct, late Saturday afternoon. And it is within 100 yards of a graveyard. ANYBODY LIVING IN A HOUSE ANYWHERE NEAR IT? My landlord does. I do not own the farm. I rent it. And she is within a half mile and there are other houses roughly within a half mile. THAT NIGHT OF JUNE 6-7, DID SHE HEAR ANYTHING UNUSUAL? No, nothing. NO DOGS BARKING OR ANYTHING? No. ANY IDEAS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED? I did not have a clue. I really didn't. I was skeptical to think that something, or someone, made it. I've been asked the question, do I believe there is life on other planets, which I do. I'm not saying intelligent life, but I do believe there is something living on other planets. AND IT MIGHT BE INTERACTING HERE? I don't know. IF YOU HAD ANOTHER CROP FORMATION, WHAT WOULD YOU DO? As of today, I would probably not tell anyone and get rid of it. BECAUSE? Of the hassle and headaches. I have a living to make and I'm not making a living off crop circles. WHY DO YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE SO INTERESTED IN THEM? It's a freak of nature or some one who is very intelligent and knows how to make them or what to do with them. That's something that no one ever sees.”"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"K nobel , Arkansas w heat formati on. Aerial photograph © 2003 by Caleigh Catt.
