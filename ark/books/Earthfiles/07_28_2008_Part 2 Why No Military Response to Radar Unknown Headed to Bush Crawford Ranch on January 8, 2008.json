It was there for the entire time of our radar data and it’s flying figure 8s over the area – going as far as north Texas to as far south as the northern Austin area.” - R obert Powell, MUFON Director of Research “I think the January 8, 2008, Carswell log book was blacked out on the ten F-16s because the military wanted as little known as possible about what their F-16s were doing that day.” - G len Schulze, Electrical Engineer and Radar Specialist R eturn to: Part 1 U pdated: July 29, 2008 Littleton, Colorado - Interviews with Glen Schulze and Robert Powell continue in Part 2 about the discovery of an unknown object that reflected at least 200 skin-paint returns, but was not sending out transponder signals to the FAA radar towers. Further, that unknown aerial object was moving in a straight line between 6:51 PM and 8 PM towards the George W. Bush ranch in Crawford, Texas. Yet, Glen and Robert could not find any radar signals of jet activity responding to that unknown approaching the property of the American President. But in the 2.5 million returns of the FAA radar data Glen Schulze r eceived from his Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, there is radar evidence that at least ten jets were flying up to 8 PM on January 8, 2008, in unusual sorties that took some of those jets over the Stephenville region. Glen's FOIA request was for FAA radar tower data between 4 PM and 8 PM, so he and Robert do not have radar information after 8 PM. A n “Unknown Aircraft” without transponder beacon, but reflecting nearly 200 skin-paint returns, moved in a straight line from Dublin toward the Bush Crawford ranch between 6:51 PM and 8 PM, on January 8, 2008. The unknown object disappeared from radar between 7:03 PM and 7:10 PM. Then at 7:32 PM, the unknown object accelerated rapidly in 30 seconds to 532 mph and then ten seconds later, it decelerated to 49 mph. Graph © 2008 by Glen Schulze and Robert Powell.

Interviews: Robert Powell, chemist retired from semi-conductor industry and cu rrent Director of Research, MUFON (Mutual UFO Network), Austin, Texas: “THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE AN UNKNOWN RADAR OBJECT BY 8 PM THAT IS 10 MILES FROM THE BUSH CRAWFORD RANCH AFTER TRAVELING IN A STRAIGHT LINE FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR (6:51 PM to 8 PM), COULD IT HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE EARLIER OBJECTS OVER SELDEN AND STEPHENVILLE? The only thing I can say is that the object I tracked for an hour is on a straight-line course. Now, it disappears off radar occasionally during that one-hour period, but its course is always constant. I can’t say that it is, or is not, related to the first radar sighting we received at 6:15 PM when Steve Allen (and his friends) saw something. DO YOU HAVE SPEEDS OVER THAT HOUR OF THE UNKNOWN OBJECT?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Yes. The average speed is around 44 mph to 49 mph. That’s very slow. Radar was clocking it in every 10-second radar sweeps and there is one time when the object is at 532 mph and 10 seconds later, it’s at 49 mph. In 10-second radar sweeps (instead of 4.7) you lose some accuracy, but if an object is making any sudden movements, that’s the only way you can catch it. The only one that might be able to do that in a 10-second time frame – and I just don’t know if it can – I know it can travel that fast and it can slow down to that speed would be either a Harrier-type-jet or, I believe, the new F-35s have Harrier jet-type capabilities. So, it’s possible those aircraft might be able to. The problem would be to maintain a slow speed for over an hour – I would think they would run out of fuel, but I’m not an expert on those type of aircraft. T he Harrier II “Jump Jet” is the second generation of vertical/short takeoff and landing (V/STOL) jet aircraft of the late 20th century. They were developed from the earlier Hawker-Siddeley Harriers, are primarily used for light attack or multi-role tasks, and are almost all operated from small aircraft carriers. The Harrier is now built by McDonnell Douglas. The Harrier in this picture is hovering just a few feet over the ground; the heat from the jet exhaust distorts the ground below.

YET, EVERYONE SAID WHAT THEY SAW WAS COMPLETELY SILENT. Right. And for this particular object we tracked for an hour, we only have one witness, the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"lady near Alexander, and she heard nothing from the object. We tried not to draw any conclusions about why the unknown would be there since there is no way for us to know what it was or why it was there. Our main thought was: If there is an object moving in that direction, what would be the reaction of military aircraft to the intrusion? Of course, we looked at the radar data and we did not see any reaction from the military to the unknown radar object. So, that was probably the most surprising part to us. Whether this unknown object was a military aircraft, civilian aircraft, or whatever it was, it just seems strange that the military did not r eact to it. So that either indicates that the military already knows what it is and they are not concerned. Or the military has not seen the unknown object on the F-16s’ radar (allegedly on training exercises that night). SO YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED AT LEAST ONE UNKNOWN AERIAL OBJECT WAS NEAR THE CRAWFORD BUSH RANCH. HE IS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THIS IS A TIME OF WAR IN WHICH NATIONAL SECURITY FROM ANY KIND OF TERRORIST ATTACK IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION. SO, HOW COULD THERE BE UNKNOWNS FLYING AROUND IN THE AIR FROM 6:15 PM TO 8 PM WHEN YOUR DATA ENDS, WITHOUT MILITARY RESPONSE, ESPECIALLY AT THE CRAWFORD BUSH COMPOUND? That’s a very good question – one for which I don’t have an answer.” Glen Schulze: “I was surprised the straight line led right to Crawford! Over the one hour period that target was tracked, Robert calculated several different velocities and he calculated an average velocity of 49 miles per hour over that period. But in between sweeps, during that hour period, there were instances where the velocity clearly sometimes went to zero! This target sometimes hovered for ten or twenty seconds and then suddenly, it would move off again – but always in a straight line. Why was this target without a beacon? We know it was something physical there when you get almost 200 hits in an hour, all in a straight line. You know there is something there. The question is: why was it not checked out (by military)?” A viation map of restricted air space inside white circle around President George W.

Major Karl Lewis, NAS JRB Fort Worth, Changes Story, Confirms F-16s Over Stephenville On January 8, 2008 N aval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth or NAS JRB Fort Worth, also known as Carswell Field, is now home to the U. S. Navy Reserve, U. S. Marine Corps Reserve, U. S. Air Force Reserve, and U. S. Air National Guard. The Carswell military complex is a military airfield located five miles (8 km) west of the central business district of Fort Worth, in Tarrant County, Texas, United States. This military airfield is operated by the United States Navy. The Air Force Reserve Command's Tenth Air Force headquarters and 301st Fighter Wing continue to be based at the installation, as well as the 136th Airlift Wing of the Texas Air National Guard. A number of Marine Corps aviation and ground units are also co-located at NAS JRB Fort Worth. Currently based Air Force aircraft are the F-16 Fighting Falcon and C-130 Hercules. Currently based Marine Corps aircraft are the F/A-18 Hornet and KC-130 Hercules. Se e: NAS JRB Fort Worth. N ine days after the first denial of jets over Stephenville, on Wednesday, January 23, 2008, there was another news release from Major Karl Lewis, a spokesman for the 301st Fighter Wing at the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth (NAS JRB Fort Worth), also known as Carswell Field. The Dallas Morning News reported that Major Karl Lewis had issued a revision to his earlier statement and confirmed there were ten F-16s flying in the Stephenville region the night of January 8, 2008. National Public Radio featured the revised military release at its website and in a January 24, 2008, news broadcast: “Air Force Alters Texas UFO Explanation.” Glen Schulze was also able to confirm radar signals for ten jets in his January 8, 2008, FAA radar data, but what puzzles him are the peculiar sortie patterns the data implies. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"J anuary 24, 2008, National Public Radio news story. Source : NPR we bsite . Confirmed Jet Sorties Between 6 PM and 8 PM, January 8, 2008 Glen Schulze and Robert Powell report that within a minute or two, the jet sorties in their FAA radar data departed Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth Carswell at: F irst sortie: 6:00 PM CST S econd sortie : 6:15 PM CST T hird sortie: 6:29 pm CST Glen found that “ the trailing F-16 wing men took off about 30 seconds behind the leader and each other for separation safety.” Glen and Robert explained that the first sortie left Carswell AFB at about 6 PM and the second sortie at about 6:15 PM, accurate to within one to two minutes because “we can first see the jets once they reach an altitude of a few hundred feet, but not prior to that. The third sortie of two jets headed to Oklahoma and first showed up at 6:29 PM on radar and returned shortly after 8 PM.” Glen Schulze, Semi-Retired Electrical Engineer and Radar Specialist, Littleton, Colorado: “The first four jets took off from Carswell AFB at 6 PM and went down the military training route straight to Stephenville and then they went to the Brownwood Military Operations Area (MOA southwest of Stephenville), did their thing, came back over Stephenville and either went directly back to Carswell or took a little detour a few miles east. So, those first four jets took off from Carswell with one beacon in the lead and they all four returned. Why Did Two F-16s Break Away from Formations? But, the third and fourth jet in that first sortie broke away from the first and second jets with the lead beacon and they had to turn another beacon on. So, even though the first four jets left Carswell with a lead plane with one beacon, when they returned, there were two beacons now from that first group of four jets. To make things even more interesting is that the second sortie of four F-16s did exactly the same thing. The first lead plane had one beacon and the other three were silent. But when they came back, there was another second beacon. So, now we have four beacons landing in those first eight jets, while only two beacons took off."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"WHY WOULD THEY HAVE DONE THAT? Because when they broke away from their formation, from their lead plane, they were no longer safe. They only had a skin-paint return. They were flying near a major airport, DFW. They were not protected by the lead jet’s beacon. They had no way to know just where they were, so for safety reasons if I were the lead pilot, I certainly would not want to fly around DFW without a beacon. So, I think for safety and regulations between the Department of Defense and the Federal Aviation Administration, if you have military planes out there, the lead plane has to have a beacon. So when those jets broke away, they had to turn their beacon on, which they did. THEN WHAT IS NOT EXPLAINED IS WHY DID THOSE JETS BREAK AWAY AND GO TO STEPHENVILLE? Exactly! In fact, the second group of jets that broke away were only in the military operational area for ten minutes, so they did not do much training that day, did they? Those jets broke away from the lead plane and went back to Stephenville after only ten minutes in the training area. Why Did Two F-16s Go to Oklahoma and Circle Back Over Stephenville? Page 25: MUFON Special Research Report, Stephenville, Texas: “CAFB Jets 9 and 10 A 9th and 10th military jet departed CAFB to the north near 6:30 PM and transited to a Military Operational Area (MOA) in southern Oklahoma (well north of our primary area of interest (AOI), with the lead aircraft transmitting beacon returns on code 5241. These two aircraft remained in loose formation for their entire flight and returned to CAFB using only beacon 5241 throughout. Their maneuvers in the Oklahoma MOA were limited to simple and non-intricate concentric circular patterns. Their return to CAFB was not direct as they traveled far to the south, and made a loop around the Dublin-Stephenville area. It seems an odd occurrence that these two planes w ere di verted to the south after compl eti ng thei r maneuvers i n Okl ahoma. The 9th and 10th jets then used the same southwestern military training route (MTR), between Stephenville and CAFB to return to base. Their return altitudes over Stephenville and the AOI center near 7:40 PM was between 2,700 and 15,000 above ground level (AGL) and their ground tracks were within 1 to 2 nautical miles east of the MTR centerline.” [ Editor's Note: Nautical mile = 1/60 of a degree of longitude, which equals 1.15 miles or 1.852 kilometers. This relationship is true for longitudes at the equator, which is 0 degrees latitude. At the Stephenville, Texas, latitude of about 30 degrees north, the relationship is about one degree of longitude equals about 51 nautical miles, rather than 60 nautical miles.] Now, let’s look at the 9th and 10th jets that went up north into Oklahoma. That was just a sortie of two jets. The lead plane had its beacon on. The trailing plane stayed close to it and those two jets did the right thing. They stayed close enough flying together behind that one beacon throughout their mission, even though it took them to Oklahoma and they did a big, wide swing back over Stephenville on their way back. They still had the same beacon"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"configuration on landing that they had on take off. But the first eight jets did not have the same beacon configuration upon returning as they had on taking off. Confusing, isn’t it? The ninth and tenth jets that went up to Oklahoma are really a surprise to me because when they got up to Oklahoma, all they did was make twelve circles in the air - no diving, no wing-overs, nothing like that. But the other eight jets that went to the Brownwood military operational area were doing all sorts of maneuvers. Their ground tracks look like a bunch of spaghetti. The two Oklahoma jets made twelve very conventional circles and then went way south down to Stephenville and came back up to Carswell in the same approach pattern that the original eight jets did. So, I don’t know what was going on there. Carswell Log Book Blacked Out Information on the Ten F-16s, January 8, 2008 J anuary 8, 2008, blacked out log book of times, codes and pin numbers for ten F-16 jets out of the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth or NAS JRB Fort Worth, also known as Carswell Field, released in FOIA data to Schulze and Powell. The Carswell logbooks blacked out the ten F-16 codes, their pin numbers. The Carswell log keeper did not want us to know what those beacons were when they took off or what they were when they landed. WHAT DO YOU SPECULATE WAS GOING ON? The scenario seemed to be a change of plans after the jets were in the air. That occurred for reasons we don’t know, but apparently the ground controllers at Carswell must have known what was going on. So, I think the break ups into the two 4-plane sorties and the 2-plane sortie that went to Oklahoma was commanded from Carswell AFB on the ground. Why that occurred? What the motivation was for that action? I don’t know. WHY WOULD CARSWELL BLACK OUT THE LOG RECORD? Oh, boy! I think the January 8, 2008, Carswell log book was blacked out on the ten F-16s because the military wanted as little known as possible about what their F-16s were doing that day. They had been embarrassed by originally saying they had nothing in the air and didn’t know anything about it. And then less than two weeks later when Karl Lewis sent out a revised press release, I think it was dawning on them that ‘Hey, people are requesting the FAA radar data. Those planes of ours that had beacons are going to show up like gang busters. We better come clean and tell the people that we did have F-16s in the air on January 8, 2008.’ [ Editor's Note: Major Karl Lewis at the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, also known as Carswell Field, issued a press release in mid-January 2008, to radio media only. Angelia Joiner, then working at the Stephenville Empire-Tribune, had originally interviewed Major Lewis in early January when he denied Carswell had any jets over Stephenville and"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"dismissed the January 8, 2008, Steve Allen sighting as probably sunlight glinting off an airliner. But when he sent out his press release changing the Carswell story to confirm ten F-16s had been flying over the Stephenville, Texas, area on January 8, 2008, he did not send the news release to reporter Angelia Joiner. She had to call his office many times before he would even speak briefly with her in a formal and clipped manner that was completely different than his relaxed demeanor during their first interview. ] So, I think it was my FOIA requests to the FAA that arrived eight days after the January 8 events that got leaked over to the military and the military called Angelia to say, ‘We want to be the first to tell you, the good guys that we are, that we did have ten F-16 jets in the air because they knew that Angelia would find out from us a month or so later. MEANING IT WAS THE FILING OF YOUR FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUESTS FOR THE FAA RADAR BEACON INFORMATION THAT WOULD HAVE GOTTEN TO MAJOR KARL LEWIS AT CARSWELL AND THEY WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY ARE IN A SQUEEZE PLAY BETWEEN WHAT THEY HAD FIRST DENIED AND WHAT WAS GOING TO BE REPORTED FROM FOIA. Exactly! And the time line fits that scenario because there was only a four day span there after the FAA got our requests before Karl Lewis comes forth with, ‘Look, guys, we’re going to level with you.’ BUT WHY BLACK OUT THOSE RADAR LOGS? I think they wanted to expose to the public as little as possible on what the jet pin numbers were, what the codes were. They did not want people tracking their planes that day. They didn’t want people like Robert Powell and myself scooping them and proving beyond any reasonable doubt where those planes were after they took off, when some broke off, when other beacons were turned on. They don’t want all that made public because it looks like mission chaos to me. AS IF THEY WERE ALARMED BY SOMETHING? THAT THE JET ACTIVITY WAS UNUSUALLY FOCUSED ON THE STEPHENVILLE REGION THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 8, BOTH IN THE SORTIE OF EIGHT JETS AND THE STRANGE BEHAVIOR OF THE TWO JETS THAT WENT UP INTO OKLAHOMA AND CAME BACK DOWN TO STEPHENVILLE. That’s correct. From what I have been told by people who have looked at the normal incidents of fly-overs of the Stephenville area, on that night of January 8, 2008, there was an abnormal level of military activity over Stephenville.” Radar Data Also Confirms AWAC At 41,000 Feet THE IMPLICATIONS FOR ME ARE PUZZLING BECAUSE IF THE MILITARY DOES NOT KNOW WHAT THE UNKNOWN OBJECT IS, THEY ARE NOT GETTING A TRANSPONDER BEEP FROM IT, BUT CAN SEE SKIN-PAINT ON RADAR, WHY WOULDN'T THE MILITARY AT LEAST FLY UP AND TAKE A LOOK AT IT? Robert Powell: That would be a concern if the military did not get a radar signature on the object because Glen and I were able to obtain the radar signature from a location farther away than the F-16s were. Additionally in our report, we believe there is probably an AWAC (Airborne Early Warning Aircraft) in the area during this entire 4 PM to 8 PM time frame. [ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – AWAC, Airborne Early Warning and Control, or Airborne Early Warning (AEW), is a radar system carried by an aircraft, which is designed to detect other aircraft. Used at a high altitude, the radars allow the operators to distinguish between friendly and hostile aircraft hundreds of miles away."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"T he USAF E-3 Sentry is also known as AWACS: Airborne Warning and Control System. This plane is used to guard the air. With it's rotating radar (“mushroom”), it can search hundreds of miles into the air for enemy aircraft. If an enemy plane is detected, friendly fighter planes will be guided towards the enemies by the radar operators in the Sentry. Image source: U. S. Air Force. AEW aircraft are used for defensive and offensive air operations. The system is used offensively to direct fighters to their target locations, and defensively to counter attacks.] We found a possible AWAC that maintained an altitude of about 41,000 feet, which is higher than most of your civilian aircraft fly. It was there for the entire time of our radar data and it’s flying figure 8s over the area – going as far as north Texas to as far south as the northern Austin area. Those AWAC aircraft have the capability of seeing downward with radar for 250 miles. Those type of aircraft are used whenever they are trying to control – they are like a flying headquarters basically. YOUR IMPLICATION IS THAT IF IT’S A FLYING HEADQUARTERS, SOMEBODY MIGHT HAVE HAD KNOWLEDGE OF SOMETHING IN THAT STEPHENVILLE AND CRAWFORD, TEXAS, THAT NEEDED TO BE OBSERVED DURING THAT PERIOD OF 4 PM TO 8 PM ON JANUARY 8, 2008? What I can say is that if that were an AWAC, I would think they would have seen all objects in that area while they were in that (region of Texas) operating area on January 8, 2008.” More Information : See other Earthfiles reports about Stephenville, Texas, aerial phenomena in Earthfiles Archive: • 07/25/2008 — Apollo Astronaut Edgar Mitchell Says Governments Covering Up E.
