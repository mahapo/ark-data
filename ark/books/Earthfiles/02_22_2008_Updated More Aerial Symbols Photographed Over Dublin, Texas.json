Updated February 22, 2008 February 14, 2008 Dublin, Texas - At the center of many of the local Dublin and Stephenville, Texas, UFO investigations since early January 2008, is 43-year-old Lee Roy Gaitan, the Erath County Constable in Precinct 2, Dublin. Lee Roy has been Constable about four years and a police officer for seventeen years. Not only is he investigating, he and his son were eyewitnesses themselves to remarkable aerial lights on January 8, 2008. Then on February 2, 2008, between 2:50 and 4:00 AM Central, Lee Roy videotaped a disc-like object that looked like a “spinning sun or Jupiter planet throwing off colored strobe lights. What was so odd about it was when I zoomed in, it looked like a triangle or "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"pyramid inside of the spinning disc.” That videotape has still not been released to the public. A week later on February 9, Constable Gaitan saw the same spinning aerial object again and his wife, Wendy, photographed with a digital still camera more pulsing lights in the sky. The aerial events started when Lee Roy received a call around 10:30 PM from a resident looking through a telescope between Dublin and Stephenville.

Lee Roy Gaitan, Constable, Erath County Precinct 2, Dublin, Texas: “I'm at Stephenville working a security job and I see the damn thing again! I see it south toward Dublin. It looks like an object that is spinning and hovering. Well, that was February 9, 2008, OK. Well, that evening at 10:30 PM, I get a phone call from a guy who tells me: ‘Lee Roy, that light is back up in the sky. It’s southeast of your house. I’m watching it through my telescope.’ I bought my wife a pretty nice still camera and we saw it. The light was traveling southeast towards the little town of Gustine, Texas. We get in the car and travel about 15 miles and my wife takes some pictures. Did you see the video that David Caron had? THE PROJECTED SYMBOLS? Yeah, where they were bouncing around. That’s what this is with all the different colors. They are green, yellow, white, red and blue. SO, THESE ARE STILL PHOTOS BY YOUR WIFE. Yes, and it’s with a good digital camera. THEY LOOK LIKE COLORED HIEROGLYPHS? Yes. It looks just like what David had. Exactly what is happening in his video is what is happening in my photos. It is not over. This was about 10:30 PM at night. Then about 11:30 PM – I had been at my sister’s house and I told her about it. She lives in town (Dublin) and they can see this light from town and they are all freaking out. Anyway, around 11:30 PM, my wife and I lost sight of it, but my sister could still see it from town. Well, we come into town and the same guy who called me about the first one calls me again. He says, ‘Hey, Lee Roy, there is a second one.’ He says it’s coming in from around the Selden, Texas, area coming towards Dublin. And sure enough, there’s another one – same thing. PROJECTING THE SYMBOLS?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Yes. And at one time, we could see both in the sky at the same time. One was in the southeast and the other was in the northeast sky. We take pictures of the second one also. There are several eyewitnesses: my sister, her husband, my niece, their neighbor. Anyway, we still don’t know what this is. February 10, 2008, Sunday OK, That’s February 9, 2008. Then on February 10, 2008, Sunday - I had to come up here to Dallas and I forgot my cell phone. The next day, I check it and it was the same guy (with telescope) calling me back about 8:30 PM. He left a message saying, ‘Lee Roy, you’re not going to believe this, but there are five of those lights flying around the Dublin area. DID THAT GUY GET ANY PHOTOS? No, he did not. He was watching through his telescope. He says he can see a capsule on top and on the bottom of this round thing and it’s spinning around and bouncing around in the sky. WHERE IS THE TELESCOPE GUY LIVING? He’s between Dublin and Stephenville somewhere. But I promised him I would not release anything (about him) at all. You know what it looks like? Remember the Lite Bright toys where you would put pegs in and they would light up different colors? EXACTLY. That’s what it looks like.” Angelia Joiner, Former Reporter, Stephenville Empire-Tribune Updated February 22, 2008, about Angelia Joiner: As of Tuesday, February 19, 2008, Angelia has been hired by KCUB-FM 98.5 radio in Stephenville.

A friend of Constable Lee Roy Gaitlan is Angelia Joiner (\"i\" is silent), who worked as the only full time reporter at the Stephenville Empire-Tribune until Thursday, February 7."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Angelia had taken the reporting job at the newspaper 18 months ago after teaching science in grade school and junior high for ten years. Both her parents had become very ill and she quit teaching to help them. When her father's health improved, Angelia couldn't find another teaching position, so she hired on at the Stephenville Empire-Tribune. As the New Year of 2008 began, Angelia's reported about all the strange, unidentified aerial light activity in the Dublin, Stephenville, Selden region after residents began calling the newspaper on January 9. That was after nearly forty people saw a variety of different and colorful aerial lights the night of January 8. One of the January 8 eyewitnesses was Steve Allen, a long-time pilot and Owner, President and CEO of L & S Enterprises and Texas Freight, a trucking and transportation brokerage company in Glen Rose, Texas, which he founded with his wife, Laquita, in 1994.

Steve and two of his friends were on a hill at sunset in Selden when lights arrived in the sky traveling very rapidly, as bright as magnesium welding torches. Those lights kept changing shapes and eventually turned into “white fire” blazing inside large rectangular “frames” in the sky. See: 020508 Earthfiles. Not long after that, two F-16 jets came screaming after the aerial lights with their afterburners red hot. Steve told Angelia and me that the strange lights were right in front of him on the Selden hill and then the next instant seemed to be at the far horizon, while the jets tried to catch up. It was “nothing from this world,” Steve Allen said. The high strangeness of the Texas events provoked constant phone calls and emails to Angelia Joiner at the Stephenville Empire-Tribune. She wanted to stay on the UFO reports, but newspaper management told her to move on to other local stories. Overwhelmed by the stress of conflicting priorities, on Friday, February 1, Angelia submitted her 2-week resignation notice. But the newspaper editor and publisher told her to leave on Thursday, February 7. This week I talked with Angelia Joiner about what she was facing prior to February 1, 2008."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"S trange aerial phenomena have been concentrated since January 1, 2008, in the trianglular region of three small Texas towns southwest of Fort Worth.

Angelia Joiner, former full-time reporter, Stephenville Empire-Tribune, Stephenville, Texas: “At the time, I was the only full time reporter at the paper. It’s a very small newspaper because this is a small town. YES, I REMEMBER SEEING A POPULATION SIGN WHEN I WAS THERE AT ABOUT 15,000. That’s right. The magnitude of the story drained the resources that the newspaper had. Everybody pitched in and tried to help out. But there were hundreds of calls and so many emails. I had other responsibilities at the paper such as weekend pages. There was a lot of work that I was supposed to do that other people ended up helping with and put together. It strained the staff resources there. We did have very good paper sales through the month of January 2008, but one month of good sales really does not add more people to your staff. I think all newspapers are strained in this day and time. Lots of them are pulling back from the areas they cover. Eventually, it was a lot for me and a lot for that newspaper. When I was asked not to report anymore on UFO things, I didn’t have a means to accomplish that goal. I was still getting a lot of phone calls and emails. So, I tried to direct those to after hours to my home computer. Anyway, I just ended up putting in my notice. Sometimes you try to please everybody and what happens is you don’t please anybody."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"SO ON THE ISSUE: WAS ANGELIA FIRED? OR DID SHE RESIGN? COULD YOU EXPLAIN IN YOUR OWN TERMS WHAT LED UP TO YOUR SUBMITTING YOUR RESIGNATION? I turned in my resignation (Friday, February 1, 2008) when I realized my employer was unhappy with my performance, or at least that was my view. So, a week later (Thursday, February 7, 2008) I go in and they are very upset with me. I don’t really know what happened, but they had taken my computer and Rolodex. The managers said various things. I think they were overwhelmed also and they asked me to leave and I did. It was quite an emotional day for me. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE DAYS RIGHT BEFORE YOU TURNED IN YOUR RESIGNATION? DID SOMEBODY COME TO YOU SPECIFICALLY TO SAY: ‘DON’T REPORT ANYMORE ABOUT THE UFO ACTIVITY HERE BECAUSE...? The editor and publisher felt our readership had just grown tired of the stories. They just felt it was time to move on to a new topic, new local community news, I suppose. BUT IT SEEMED TO ME WHEN I WAS THERE FROM JANUARY 29 TO FEBRUARY 1, THERE WAS IN FACT MORE INTENSE INTEREST. I thought there was still a lot of interest, yes, judging from the phone calls and emails there was still a lot of interest, I would say. IF YOU HAD AGREED TO HELP BY RE-DIRECTING THOSE EMAILS TO YOUR HOME COMPUTER AND YOU WERE CONCENTRATING ON COMMUNITY AFFAIRS AGAIN, WHAT WOULD THE PROBLEM HAVE BEEN? Well, I’m not sure. I think they thought I was spending too much of my newspaper time forwarding emails and trying to answer emails and I was still getting a lot of calls. So, they just felt I was not following their directions, I guess, because I didn’t drop it entirely. I didn’t really say, ‘OK, I’ll try to do this after hours. But, if I had a meeting after hours, I did not try to hide that. They knew where I was going for dinner to meet with this person and that sort of thing. It’s just hard to explain. Outside Political Pressure? STEVE ALLEN, RICKY SORRELLS, LEE ROY GAITAN AND POLICE OFFICERS WHO REMAIN UNNAMED, ALL DESCRIBED HAVING PHONE CALLS THAT WERE BASICALLY INTIMIDATING OR TRYING TO PERSUADE THEM THAT SOMETHING MILITARY AND NATURAL WAS GOING ON AND THEY FELT LIKE PRESSURE WAS BEING PUT ON THEM INDIVIDUALLY. DO YOU THINK IT’S POSSIBLE THAT SOME AUTHORITY IN OUR GOVERNMENT WAS PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE PUBLISHER OF THE STEPHENVILLE NEW SPAP E R? No, I don’t think that at all. I don’t believe anybody military contacted them. If that had been the case, they would have pulled me aside and said, ‘This is what’s happened.’ Whenever you work in a small workplace that has very few employees, you know the people year round pretty well. If someone has pressured them, I believe they would have told me that. I just believe it was in their judgment that there was enough of the UFO stuff and let’s go on. YOU TURNED IN YOUR LETTER OF RESIGNATION ON FEBRUARY 1, BECAUSE YOU FELT OVERWHELMED? I didn’t feel like I could please anybody. I was being pulled in a lot of directions and I didn’t feel they were happy with my performance. So, I thought it might be the best thing at the time would be to end the relationship. SO, YOU WERE DOING THE RESIGNATION ON YOUR OWN VOLITION? Yes. Nobody threatened me. Nobody contacted me, like anyone I thought was military asking me to drop the stories. That did not happen. WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED BETWEEN FEBRUARY 1ST AND 7TH, THE FIRST WEEK OF YOUR 2-WEEK NOTICE OF RESIGNATION, THAT WOULD HAVE PROVOKED THE OWNERS OF THE NEWSPAPER TO BE AGGRESSIVE WITH YOU ON FEBRUARY 7?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"I suppose because they saw the number of emails that I was getting and because they felt I was spending too much of their newspaper time on UFO things still. WHAT IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE? Well, I honestly tried to honor their wishes. I did not want to give up the investigations on the UFOs. I did not want to abandon those eyewitnesses. I tried to honor the newspaper’s wishes by directing the attention to after-hours and to my home. Apparently that was not the right thing to do in their eyes. I just really think the whole thing is unfortunate. New Website to Report Mysterious Phenomena in Dublin and Stephenville Region WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU’RE GOING TO DO NEXT? (big laugh) I wish I knew! I’ve already done some freelance things. And now there is the website, www.stephenv illelights.com (Angelia has written the first web article and hopefully will be doing more reporting if the phenomena continues in the region.) HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING HIGHLY UNUSUAL IN THE SKY YOURSELF? No, I have not. (laughs) I do look up at the sky a lot more now. I am more observant, but the way it has turned the witnesses, just rocked their world, turned their world upside down, I’m not sure I want to see it. THE VIDEO THAT IMPRESSED ME THE MOST IN TERMS OF AN AERIAL OBJECT WAS THE PROJECTION OF THE SYMBOLS THAT DAVID CARON TOOK NEAR THE STEPHENVILLE AIRPORT. Yes, I interviewed him and saw that video also. I WONDERED WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF THE VIDEO FROM YOUR OWN EYES, HAVING INTERVIEWED A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE? I’ve never seen anything like that. Of course, you have to recognize that I’m new to the UFO world. I was really impressed with that video. It’s really not explainable, I don’t believe. When I talked with David Caron, he even showed me, ‘Here’s how I put the camera up against the pole on my front porch to try to keep it steady.’ He seemed completely amazed by it also. I watched it all the way through two times. It seemed like the background noise from the traffic – he lives on a fairly busy little road and it’s a paved road. All that background noise seemed constant (on the video) and the talk between him and the man that was there at the time. It was just so unusual to see lights dance around like that in the sky. One of them said, ‘It almost looks like hieroglyphics.’ And I thought it does. I thought it was unusual, too, because the thing does not just like curve – it makes 90-degree angles, 40-degree angles, then it will have curvy spots in it. WITH ALL THOSE DIFFERENT COLORS, ALMOST STRIPED AND SPECKLED. Right! And it was so brilliantly colored – very bright, intense colors. I could not decide if this is something moving and it’s streaking like that? Or is this actually what you see? Can you not keep up with it with your naked eye? I don’t know. IT APPEARS TO BE PROJECTIONS EVERY 15 FRAMES, WHICH IS A HALF SECOND. EVERY HALF A SECOND, EACH OF THOSE HIEROGLYPHS OR SYMBOLS IS CHANGING TO A NEW ONE. Yes, it is sort of a pulsating effect. WELL, I’M WITH YOU IN NEVER HAVING SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT PARTICULAR PROJECTION BEFORE. I’VE RECEIVED A LOT OF EMAILS SAYING IT COULD BE A JVC CAMERA GONE HAYWIRE. UNTIL I TALKED WITH LEE ROY GAITAN LAST NIGHT. NOW HIS WIFE HAS TAKEN PHOTOGRAPHS THAT APPEAR TO BE EXACTLY THE SAME THING. Yes, I’ve seen his pictures and they do look the same. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Restricted Air Space Over Bush Ranch Not Far from Stephenville I GOT AN AVIATION MAP OF RESTRICTED MAPS AROUND THE GLEN ROSE, STEPHENVILLE, DUBLIN REGION. HERE IS A BIG WHITE CIRCLE OF THE BUSH CRAWFORD COMPOUND IN THE MIDDLE. THE COMPOUND IS NOT MORE THAN 60 MILES AWAY FROM MOST OF THE LOCATIONS WHERE THE PHENOMENA HAVE BEEN SEEN, VIDEOTAPED OR PHOTOGRAPHED. HAVE YOU HAD ANYBODY SPECULATE OR SUGGEST TO YOU THAT THE AERIAL PHENOMENON COULD BE FLAUNTING ITSELF BECAUSE OF THE CRAWFORD/BUSH COMPOUND PROXIMITY? Well, more than flaunting itself – not really going in that direction. But I have had comments on the two F-16s that Steve Allen saw that seemed to be in pursuit of the thing that came over the second time. Some people are speculating that the object crossed the Crawford air space, which is the reason those jets scrambled after it. Other than that, I don’t have any more information. IT’S CLEAR TO EVERYONE, INCLUDING PILOTS, WHAT A PHONY EXCUSE THAT WAS DAYS AFTER JANUARY 8, FOR THE MILITARY TO BE TRYING TO BLAME ALL THE EYEWITNESSES FROM JANUARY 1 INTO LATE JANUARY ON TEN F-16S IN A TWO HOUR PERIOD BETWEEN 6 AND 8 PM ONLY ON JANUARY 8. When I did the first story, I immediately began making phone calls to the military bases I thought would be relevant. That’s when I got in touch with Major Lewis at the Naval Air Station in Fort Worth. It used to be called Carswell AFB. He was very nice and said, ‘Let me see what I can find out for you. Did we have jets in the area because I was relating the story of the two F-16s that were in pursuit of the big object, according to Steve Allen. Major Lewis did call me back the next day and said, ‘There could have been jets from some other base, but they were not ours.’ Then the next thing I know is two weeks later, I’m getting a call for a radio interview about the USAF backtracking on their statement. That was the first I heard of it. He did not send me the press release or call me. So, I called him. His demeanor had absolutely changed. It was quite clear that he was probably reading something over the phone to me. I feel like possibly he was reprimanded because all he could do was say, ‘Miss Joiner, at this time all I can say is ...’ and he would read. Now, the thing that really kind of jumped out at me is in the military press release that says that military operating area is over Erath County. Boy, it didn’t take very long for me to get phone calls from pilots in the area and people coming to me, spreading out their aeronautical maps and saying, ‘No, we are not in that Brownwood MOA. We’re way over"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"here.’ And they would point at the map. So, maybe that was a mistake in the military press release. I’m not really sure. BUT YOUR POINT IS THAT WHEN YOU FIRST CALLED MAJOR LEWIS SOON AFTER THE JANUARY 8 EVENING WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE SAW THE LIGHTS AND STARTED CALLING YOU AT THE NEWSPAPER ON THE NEXT DAY, THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO TALK TO THE NAVAL OFFICER AND TO TALK IN A CONVERSATIONAL WAY ABOUT WHAT COULD BE HAPPENING? Right. And he was just a regular guy. Real friendly. Very congenial. And it would be just like me talking to you. It was not scripted, or anything like that (in the first phone conversation). BUT, BY THE THIRD WEEK IN JANUARY OR THEREABOUTS, HE WAS VERY STIFF AND FORMAL WITH YOU AND READING A PREPARED STATEMENT ON THE PHONE. That’s what it sounded like. I think he was reading and he was a lot more cautious. His demeanor had just completely changed. DID YOU ASK, ‘SIR, OFF THE RECORD, CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT KIND OF PRESSURE HAVE YOU HAD FROM HIGHER AUTHORITIES TO SHUT THIS STORY UP ? I did try to go in that direction, but he would still just say, ‘Miss Joiner, all I can say is this...’ So, I could see that something had changed. He certainly was not the same guy that I had spoken with a couple of weeks before.” E xcerpt of Angelia Joiner's reporting summarized in Associated Press wire story distributed nationally on January 15, 2008.
