K. Order Information Below July 9, 2000 Wiltshire, England - While researching for my next book about mysterious lights and crop circles, I found fascinating history and facts about the center of the crop circle mystery, Wiltshire, England, in a recent book entitled, Legendary Landscapes, Secrets of Ancient Wiltshire Revealed by Julie and John Wakefield who live in Marlborough. This work is essential reading for anyone interested in prehistoric Avebury, the region's Neolithic ancestors and the rites that were performed in a land filled with stone circles, avenues, long barrows and rock mounds whose exact purposes are still unknown. In the decade of the 1990s and ongoing, some of the largest and most spectacular crop formations in the world have been focused in Wiltshire's Vale of Pewsey which the Wakefields have discovered is connected to Avebury and the large land canvass upon which cycles of birth, death, fertility, harvests, the sun, moon and stars were tracked for survival and communication with the Infinite Source. One particularly surprising revelation is described by the Wakefields: \"The Neolithic people appear to have placed particular sites onto the natural rolling hills to accentuate their womanly shape; so much so that they have created an incredible architectural icon. Could this really be possible - or could the position of the monuments that seem to make up this female form be mere coincidence and not intentional at all? ... There are many examples of vulvas engraved on rock surfaces in caves, some of which are reddened with ochre which was symbolic of life-giving blood. The carvings date by tool association to around 30,000 B. C. ...(In Wiltshire) The two hills that form the breasts of the Alton Barnes Goddess are Milk Hill and Walker's Hill.\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"With drawings and photographs, the Wakefields show how those hauntingly beautiful hills in the Vale of Pewsey were seen by Neolithic minds as breasts and the body of a goddess with an accompanying serpent.\" Other research the authors have done about the archaeological finds of Egyptian and Mesopotamian beads, other objects and name connections between England and Egypt are another reason that Legendary Landscapes should be read and treasured as an invaluable archive and reference.
