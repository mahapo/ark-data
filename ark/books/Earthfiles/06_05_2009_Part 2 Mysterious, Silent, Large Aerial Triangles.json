See: 052809 Earthfiles, Parts 1 and 2 3 00-foot-long unidentified, silent, aerial craft first discovered only 100 or 200 feet above Cha llis, Idaho, camp trailer on September 27, 2000.

I was traveling west bound on I-80, approaching South Bend, Indiana, about 11 p.m. In the distance was what appeared to be very bright, white airplane landing lights low in the sky. What made me pay attention was the fact that they were extremely bright, they didn't seem to be descending, and they were stationary. While there is an airport near there, it seemed unusual. As I got closer, the highway curved so I couldn't see the lights as they were obscured by trees, but as I came around the bend, and passed over a bridge, I looked to my left to see if they were still there. I was stunned to see a large triangular object with the configuration of 3 large, white lights and and a centered, larger red light on the underside of the object.

I couldn't accurately assess how high up it was or how far away it was, but based on a tower nearby, I guessed it was about a half-mile away and about 500 feet in the air, so it seems that a size of 250 feet along each edge of the triangle is reasonable. The white lights I saw earlier in the distance seemed to be on one of the sides of the object that faced east as I was heading for South Bend. There weren't any similar lights on the side of the object as I passed by. The thickness of the object seemed to be about 10-15% of the length. The corners of the object appeared somewhat rounded. There was a significant amount of ambient light, so I could see some definition of the side facing me. I really couldn't stop and pull over to take a longer look as traffic was moving pretty quickly at the time."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"M ap arrow overlays and comments by David Tyson. My background: I'm an electrical engineer and computer consultant who travels frequently and am pretty knowledgeable about most civ ilian aircraft. I also have a pretty good fa miliarity with many military aircraft. I'd never seen anything like it, so when I got home and began researching a bit, I came across the discussions of black triangles on the web, but the illustrations accompanying your Earthfiles article more closely resemble what I saw. Definitely, something was there. Not a hallucination. 2) From: Plano, Texas, Late 1998 or 1999, 5 AM Subject: Flying Triangle Date: June 5, 2009 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com I saw a flying triangular aircraft in the late 1990s, around '98 or '99. I was working the 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. shift at my job and had went outside at 5:00 a.m. for a coffee and cigarette break. I was working in a commercial/business area of Plano, Texas, at Campbell Rd. and I-75, just north of downtown Dallas. I was located in the city not a quarter mile from I-75. As I drank my coffee and smoked my cigarette under the awning of my building, I suddenly saw an aircraft approximately 100 yds above me. The craft was only visible due to the white lights on it and the single red flashing light that was located approx. one third into the center of the aircraft. The craft was very much like the one you described, but it was not 300 ft. It was more like 100 ft wide and long. The aircraft also had more than 3 lights on it. The craft I saw had six white lights on it and one flashing red light. T riangular craft about 100 feet long and wide seen at 5:00 a.m. near Campbell Road and I-75 in Plano, Texas. Illustration © 2009 by eyewitness. The craft was black, I guess, as it was not visible in the black sky and I believe it may have had a light absorbing texture or paint because it did not reflect light nor did the parking lot light show the craft outline. The craft was only moving about 30 to 50 mph (I guess, very slow) and the time I viewed the craft was approx. 5 to 10 seconds. I was trying to pay attention to details when it happened as I knew I was seeing something that most people have never seen before. The craft did not make a single sound, nothing, zilch, Nada! Another very important thing that I must note: there was no wind at all while the craft was flying over. This was not a helicopter, it was not a normal plane."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"When the craft had moved above and in front of me and I was about to lose sight of it, I was looking to see if I could tell what the back looked like. But it was not visible and the rear of the craft looked very thin. The craft was headed from north to south direction and was just off the highway. I got the feeling that this craft wanted people to see it, as it was lit up literally like a Christmas tree. An ex-Navy friend suggested that maybe it was a new blimp of some sort, but I just don't know. This took place at Glenv ille Rd. and Campbell Rd. I also included a quick paint representation of what I saw. 3) From: Industry, Maine, 1987 or 1988 Subject: Triangular Craft Date: May 29, 2009 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com My story is in response to the story I heard May 28, 2009, on the Coast to Coast AM radio program broadcast out of Augusta, Maine, on WLOB Radio 101.3 FM. The story I am referring to is of the triangular object reported to have been seen by Kris Bales and reported by Linda Moulton Howe. I also have seen a very similar thing. I was not alone when I witnessed this event. I am not sure now of the exact year. I am guessing it to be around 1987 or 88. This took place in Industry, Maine, in a rural area. Myself and about 5 or 6 other people were at my then girlfriend's parents home just hanging around outside by the vehicles. I think we were getting ready to leave somewhere and there were a few other people there. Was a very nice sunshiny, summer afternoon. We were all just chatting standing by the car getting ready to go when suddenly it got dark, like a huge rain cloud just happened overhead, which is exactly what I thought when it just suddenly got dark. I looked up to see what kind of storm would be moving in so fast and to my surprise, just about centered over us, there was this huge, black, triangular craft. It had to be at least as big as a football field. It was just about centered over us when I looked up. It was so big and so low that I really couldn't see the sides of it even. I tell people that it was so low I think I could have thrown a rock up at it and hit it. It was probably not that low, but being so large, I had that feeling. There was no sound at all except for was I think of as what any object might sound like as it went through the air silently. I call it a whirring sound, like something against the wind and moving. No mechanical or jet engine sound. No smoke or vapor trail of any kind. I do not recall seeing any lights or markings of any kind. It was almost an equilateral triangle shape, but maybe a bit more pointy at the forward area. I seemed to be the one most concerned with this thing. Everyone just kind of put it off as a new stealth type of jet, although that sort of thing is not common. I should have reported it and made better documentation of this, but I didn't. The craft was also moving very slow. It was hard to believe that something so large and with no visible or audible engines running could hold such a thing in the air at such a low speed. My immediate thought was that this thing had lost its means of pr opulsion and was looking for a place to land. This is in a mountainous area, by the way. There is/was a field about two miles away in the direction that this craft was going. My idea was to hop in the car and drive to that area to see it land. A few of us jumped in the car, and drove as fast as we could to get to to the field about 5 min. away. We got there, got out of the car, turned off the car's engine, but didn't see a thing or hear it. This is the end of the story. This story is true and there had to have been others that day that also seen this. I am curious if anybody else did report on this."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 4) From: CIA in United Kingdom - Late 1980s to Early 1990s Subject: Flying Triangles Date: June 5, 2009 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com In the late 80s/early 90s, I was stationed in the U.K. with the United States Air Force as a special units officer of the CIA and worked on the Flying Triangle project as a sound technician. I studied the affects of the craft's sound emissions on the environment so I was not privy to all of its workings. But from what I know, the three circles at the outer points generated low amplitude sound waves that crashed with each other in the center which also contained a huge magnesium, circular, flywheel-like device. The three crashing waves kept the wheel in balance. If they moved the wheel slightly in one direction, the craft would instantly travel in that direction as the unit tried to balance itself. It could stop on a dime once balance was allowed. This craft could hover and fly at incredible speeds and made no sound to the outside viewer/listener. It used very little electricity and when I left they were fitting it with solar collectors to test space travel. But I was unsure if this thing could perform in space. Its capable speed has nothing to do with the speed of sound. When out of balance, the craft will continue to accelerate faster and faster. Our test speeds were limited by the size of the Earth's atmosphere. I've noticed increased reports of these crafts over the past few years and it appears they are making them a lot larger than the original test units. But, these are Earthlings, not ETs. [ Editor's Note: Other sources insist any human-made triangular craft is back-engineered from retrieved extraterrestrial technology.] The biggest developmental problem I remember was the vulnerability of the diaphragm-like area between the circles. Any size penetration, like a small bird, would send the craft tumbling out of control. It looks like the newer versions have an additional outer surface to overcome this. One of the pilots told me it was like flying a hot air balloon. They could hover a few hundred feet above people and hear everything they were saying. One other thing I remember that they found out by accident was that if two of these crafts got too close to each other in flight, they would stick to each other like magnets. It wouldn't harm the flight of the craft, but it was weird. When I left, they were studying this and were testing sticking them together in flight like pieces of pie. But no one had suggested a practical use for this ability. The last thing I can say about this project is that the guts of the craft were designed and made at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City. I've been there many times. The main building had no windows and personnel were told it was used for the stealth bomber project, but that was not its true purpose. You can see the building I'm referring to by visiting the base. It is the only one with no windows and has its own special security detail. 5) From: Newbury Park, California - Thanksgiving 1991, 2 AM Subject: Triangular Aircraft Date: May 30, 2009 12:48:09 AM MDT To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com Linda, I heard you on Coast to Coast 5/28/09. Good job by the way. I saw a triangular craft in 1991 and have been watching the skies ever since. On Thanksgiving morning 1991, at about 2:00 a.m. - my girlfriend and I were"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"preparing our turkey in a smoker outside in front of the condo I was living in at the time in Newbury Park, California. I just happened to look up and saw an object above us. My reaction was to run thinking something was fa lling. After my second or third step I noticed it was not moving at all. It was about 60 to 80 feet above the ground just above the trees. It was a huge, black, triangular shaped aircraft approximately 600 ft long. We were both working for Northrop Corp. at the time and knew this was not one of our B-2 Bombers. It was much bigger and triangular in shape, not the sawtooth back end of the bombers. It sat there silent. It did a 90-degree left turn while hovering and then back to the original position. It did this several times. It seemed that it was positioning itself for a better view of what we were doing. We were able to see in the windows, but the lights were off. The bottom was smooth - no landing gear doors, no writing and/or markings and no sign of engines or inlets for engines. Also there were no lights on this craft. There was some sort of white florescent light about 3 feet in front of the craft half way down the leading edge. But no brackets attaching this light to the craft. Very frightening. The 600-foot-long triangle then went up to about 1000 ft and back down to about 100 ft in less then 1 second, then up to about 3000 - 4000 ft and back down to about 100 ft in about 1 second. It did this several times. Then floated up to about 3000 - 4000 ft in about 30 seconds and hovered for a few minuets and slowly aimed to the south and took off faster then any aircraft that I had ever seen. It was out of sight as fast as you could blink. The whole sighting lasted about 15 minutes. This was very frightening. It kind of makes you wonder why we are st ill using cars, trains, boats and planes as well as the space shuttle when there are some sort propellant systems, or lack there of, like this out there. This also makes me think the speed of sound is not an accurate way to measure the speed of this type of craft. 6) From: Salt Lake City, Utah - February 27, 2009, 7:10 to 10:57 PM Subject: Linda Moulton Howe: I heard you on Coast to Coast Date: May 30, 2009 5:23:06 PM MDT To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com I heard you on Coast to Coast with George Noory (May 29, 2009). You asked for people to report about triangle objects seen. The stories below are what happened on the night of Feb. 27, 2009. I served in the U.S. Marines and I was in the air wing division. What I saw was not any conventional aircraft I have ever seen. (1) See top sketch labeled 1. below. The first one I sighted at about 7:10 p.m. It had 3 very dim lights on the bottom in a triangle pattern. The triangle was moving very fast, silent and NNW direction. It appeared to be bending light around it? It was like it was invisible, like you could see though it in a way, except for the lights on it. The lights didn't blink at all and were white-yellow in color with a very slight gray tint and were very dim and hard to see. Very stealthy, no sound at all. The bending of the light around the lights reminded me of the movie “Predator.” Like when the creature was kind of visible, yet non-visible. I'm in the flight path of the jets that come in to land at the Salt Lake City International Airport. The triangle was about the same height of"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the jets that come in to land, but slightly higher and just west of me. My thumb held at full arm's distance would be able to cover this object. The sighting was less than 4 to 5 seconds. See the 1st sketch below 1. F ebruary 27, 2009, 7:10 PM, near Salt Lake City, Utah, International Airport. Four illustrations 1., 2., 3., 4. © 2009 by eyewitness. (2) Second sighting is the third drawing, 3. (sorry for out-of-order confusion) After the first sighting......I'm excited to see such a thing, so I stay outside and watch the sky intently. I'm on the cell phone te lling one of my friends about this sighting. He lives near Ogden City, Utah, about a 45-minute drive on the freeway. While I was telling him about the 7:10 p.m. sighting, I see another ark of light come down quickly (white bluish in color). As it arks slightly upwards, I see a wide band of light going across the sky. Then a row of three round lights come into view. They were white with just a hint of blue in color. The angle was that the tip was raised up about 135 degrees and the row of lights were turned at about a 45-degree angle. I think it is turning and rising at the same time. This object is coming right towards me except rising upwards a little. I can see light coming far from the right of the object, but I can't see where the light is coming from."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"I think I was seeing one side of a triangle, because the light coming from the right side was coming from wider at the back than the rear. The row of 3 lights down one side of the object were as big or bigger than a football field in length. This thing is huge and silent! It was a single row of 3 lights (dim) on a 45-degree angle coming towards me in a rising matter. The left side of it moves straight over me with no sound at all and again in a NNW direction. The sighting was about 3 ½ seconds. And in 3 ½ seconds it was gone! It was a little lower than the lowest jets that fly over and are preparing to land at the SLC Int. Airport. I called the airport to get the average height of the jets preparing to land above my home address. The man told me 3,000 ft was the altitude at my address. He wanted to know why I wanted to know this before he told me, so I told him. He was very interested and wanted to know what time that this happened. I told him the triangle was headed right towards the airport and it was about 8:30 p.m. Back to the description: I could see the side of the craft on the left side, where the row of lights was. Over towards the right was where most of the light emanated from above the thing or side of the thing. It was like one side of a V of lights that were visible at my angle of view. This thing also seemed to be bending light making it very hard to see. The side where the lights were, I could see a slight curvature to it and the side of it was like shimmering water and mirror like. If I held my arm fully extended with the palm flat against the direction of the triangle craft, I still would not fully be able to cover the left side of this object. Like I said earlier it was huge! As this object went over me the bottom of it was completely dark with no lights visible on the bottom of it, just light coming from the sides. Also, as it passed quickly over me it bathed me and everything in a very soft, baby blue-white light, very soft color. From the rear of it as it was leaving, I could only see a blackness with light emanating from both sides. The blackness appeared to be about 20 percent as thick as it was wide. From the rear of it, I could no longer see the row of lights on it, but I could see light coming from both sides of the dark mass of it. I had binoculars around my neck, but was so dumb founded at this object I didn't even think of the binoculars or the camera in my pocket, plus it was so fast! Also I want to add that it didn't interfere with my cell phone at all. (3) Third sighting is the second drawing, 2. [ “Flying wing”] I'm still outside watching the sky (8:45 p.m). My neighbor comes home and sees me outside with a coat, hat, gloves and binoculars. With a puzzled look, she comes over and asked me what I'm doing. I tell her and she starts asking me where I seen the objects. So I'm telling her and all of a s udden, I see another object barely visible in a sense and very high traveling in a NNW direction. I immediately remember my binoculars this time and quickly find this object in my 10 x 50 power binoculars. It was like a flying wing with about 9 round lights forming a slight V-formation. It was fast and silent. The sighting was about 4 seconds long. I asked what she saw and she also saw a triangle pattern of lights. I can't say that I could see much more than the lights. But it did appear to be dark between the area of the lights in the form of a wing-type V-pattern with the ends of each wing squared. We also noticed it had no sound whatsoever. (4) See bottom sketch labeled 4."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"It's cold out and I'm still out watching the s ky, three things in one night! I'm thinking, what's going on?! Anyway, it's about 10:57 p.m. now and I'm in my back yard now. Earlier I was in the driveway. I'm looking to the south. All of a sudden, I see a dimly visible row of lights in a slight V-pattern, but yet almost straight across. It's coming fast and low, much lower in height of the jets that come in to land at the airport. I quickly view this with my binoculars. I'm shocked! It's not one thing - it's a group of off-white triangles. They were moving in formation, 15 to 17 of them, in triangle formations. In each triangle pattern, the lead one would drop back to the rear and then move back to the front again. This was happening in unison along this formation line, from one side to the other. (One triangle of formation with one in between - the next triangle formation with one on each side of the triangle formation. They changed pattern about 4 times). It was very strange and puzzling. It also reminded me of birds in flight at first, but so different, too. How they moved was more troubling to me than what they looked like. The sighting was no more than 4 ½ seconds. I would guess each craft was a little bigger than a small airplane. They had no lights on them, but had a yellow-white glow to them as they passed over head. They were not bright at all - dim yet very solid-looking triangles at first sight. They were a perfect triangle shape (slight curvature on the two leading sides) with a slight V notched out the back edge of them. They were silent and fast. They went right over me. I stared at them intently with my 10 x 50 custom Bushnell binoculars. The bottom of them was smooth and elliptical, no markings at all. As they were directly above me, I could see that they were more arrowhead shaped. The sides had a slight curve with about a 20 percent notch “V” in the rear of them. So think of a triangle with a notch “V” cut out of the back that is about 20 percent of its size. The triangles had a slight glow to them, but no visible lights on them. They were flying very closely together in a moving formation. Moving very oddly. The width of the formation was wider than the palm of my hand flatly held out at arm's length. Please see the 4th sketch. I stayed outside until about 1:15 a.m., but I didn't see anything else peculiar. All of this in one night!
