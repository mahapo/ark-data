April 26, 2003 Beijing, China - Amid rumors that the Beijing government is about to invoke martial law (denied by officials so far), 4000 residents suspected of SARS contamination were ordered to stay home in quarantine yesterday. Beijing authorities also sealed off the city's third major hospital as the number of new SARS cases jumped from 37 to 877 in only five days. Ditan Hospital in northern Beijing was closed only a few days after the Beijing government had featured the hospital as an example of their health care organization and ability to control SARS. Earlier this week, Peking University's People's Hospital was also closed, along with Northern Jiaotong University where 400 students are quarantined. So far in China's capitol of 13 million people, more than 750 people are sick with the coronavirus pneumonia and at least 42 patients have died. As of April 25, the World Health Organization was reporting 2,601 cases in China and 115 deaths (4% mortality rate). Hong Kong is treated as a \"special administrative region,\" with 1,510 cases and 115 deaths (8% mortality rate). Many schools and offices have closed and shopping malls, restaurants, hotels and general city life has come to an eerie silence for a city of 13 million people. Beijing Medical Workers Warned by Government Not To Leave Work Health authorities estimate that one in eight of Beijing's SARS cases are medical workers and some doctors and nurses have reportedly left the city to escape the deadly virus. So, the government has warned the medical community that their medical licenses will be permanently revoked if they don't keep working. Toronto, Canada Remains on W. H.O.'s Travel Advisory List W.H.O. is still advising all optional travel to be delayed to Toronto where there are 140 SARS cases and 15 deaths (10.7% mortality rate). Angry Toronto government officials demanded that W.H.O. rescind its warning, but W.H.O. has "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"refused. Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia, joined the argument by siding with Toronto government in a rare public disagreement with W.H.O. W.H.O.'s Director of Communicable Diseases, David Heymann, argues that Canada SARS patients are known to have transported the pneumonia virus to the United States, Australia and the Philippines, and the only way to slow down the SARS spread is to reduce person-to-person contamination. In other travel-related news, Great Britain travel insurance providers are withdrawing coverage for some SARS-infected countries. SARS Cases as of April 26, 2003 Reported by CDC and W.H.O.
