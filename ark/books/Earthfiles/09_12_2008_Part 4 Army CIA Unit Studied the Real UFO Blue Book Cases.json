May 30, 1998 “YOU ARE AT AREA 51 GROOM LAKE INSIDE A FACILITY THAT IS HOUSING A NON-HUMAN GREY BEING AND YOUR BOSS ASKED, ‘WHERE ARE YOU FROM?’ THE BEING TELEPATHED WHAT? A long name, like 16 or 20 letters in the name of where the grey being was from. My boss could not remember the name and when he came out of the room, I asked him and he said, ‘Boy, I don’t remember what it was. It was a really long name.’ My boss asked the being if the name was part of the Milky Way galaxy or if that was his planet, and the being answered it was like part of a galaxy where he was from – but not our galaxy. ANOTHER GALAXY. Ye s . WHEN THE BEING TELEPATHED TO YOUR BOSS THAT HE AND HIS KIND WERE NOT HERE TO HURT ANYONE, BUT ONLY TO IMPART KNOWLEDGE, HOW WOULD THOSE BEINGS IMPART KNOWLEDGE TO US IF ITS KIND WERE NOT MAKING THEMSELVES PUBLIC TO THE EARTH IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY ? I remember my boss thought that when the being said that, the creature was stretching the truth or lying. Something made my boss feel like the creature was not telling the entire truth. WHEN YOUR BOSS ASKED, FROM A RELIGIOUS POINT OF VIEW, WHETHER THE GREY BEINGS WERE DEMONS, ELABORATE ABOUT WHAT THE BEING’S REACTION WAS? The being seemed to be upset when my boss asked the question – visually upset that my boss thought he was a demon. The expression my boss had was that a demon was like a much lesser type being than what the being thought it was. The being was disgusted with the question. DID YOUR BOSS ASK WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP WAS BETWEEN THE GREY BEING WITH BLACK EYES AND THE 6-FINGERED HUMANOIDS YOU HAD SEEN IN THE DISSECTION FILM? No, he did not. We only had about ten or fifteen minutes that we were allowed there. My boss did ask the being a couple of questions that the being did not answer. One was about how many areas in the world that the grey beings had landed and contacted? – like the way that grey being was at Groom Lake. Are there other grey beings in other places? The being did not answer that. No answer of any kind. DID YOU EVER LEARN DURING YOUR WORK WITH THE CIA WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS BETWEEN THE 6-FINGERED BEINGS AND THE GREY BEINGS? "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"No, never did. OK, SO YOUR BOSS AND THE OTHERS HAVE COME BACK INTO THE ROOM WHERE YOU ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS FROM THE GREY BEING? Ye s . WHAT HAPPENED? DID ANYONE EXPLAIN WHY THE BEING WAS BEING KEPT THERE? No, they would not tell us why he was kept there, how long he had been there, or anything like that. I think one of the answers was, ‘We cannot talk about that.’ WHO SEEMED TO BE IN CONTROL OF THE GROOM LAKE FACILITY AT AREA 51 WHERE THE GREY BEING WAS KEPT? WHAT AGENCY? It appeared to be the U. S. Air Force. The USAF Colonel is who we talked to. DO YOU REMEMBER WHO HE WAS? No. He didn’t have on any identification tag. Usually military officers had a name tag. He had a tag that only gave a first name, ‘Jim.’ And he said, ‘Call me Jim.’ So apparently he did not want anyone to know his last name. We noticed the lack of name tags on a lot of the other officers who were there, too. There were no last names on their uniforms. We had our first and last name on our name tags, but mine was phony anyway. ALL OF YOU IN THE CIA HAD PHONY NAMES EVEN TO RELATE TO EACH OTHER? Yes. We never used real names there at all. DID THE COLONEL JIM TALK ABOUT WHETHER THE GREY BEINGS WERE CONSIDERED A THREAT? No, they did not consider it like a big threat, but there were statements like, ‘We don’t know for sure, but we don’t think they are going to be harmful to us. But we don’t know for certain that they are not trying to invade U.S. or check out our military strength. Even at that time, the saucer sightings were always around classified areas and military bases. So, it looked like the extraterrestrials were scouting. WERE THE GREY BEINGS REFERRED TO AS ‘EXTRATERRESTRIALS’? Yes, they were referred to as extraterrestrials. Most of the time they referred to the being at Groom Lake Area 51 as a ‘Grey.’ DID OUR GOVERNMENT HAVE ANY LIVING, 6-FINGERED HUMANOIDS HOUSED SOME PLACE? No, not that I know of. That’s one of the questions I asked the military man on the way into the Groom Lake facility. I was thinking of the 6-fingered types in the autopsy film I had seen. So, I asked, ‘Is the being we're going to see the same as those from Roswell?’ Our military escort said, ‘No.’ Then I asked , ‘Do you have any beings like Roswell?’ And he said, ‘No.’ DID THE AUTOPSY FILM IN THE INTRODUCTION STATE WHERE THE 6-FINGERED HUMANOIDS HAD BEEN RETRIEVED? It just said, ‘near Roswell.’ NO SPECIFICATION? No, the film did not specify if it was the craft they captured near Roswell. The film just said ‘near Roswell.’ Now, understand there were at least two or three craft our military had picked up around Roswell that same summer of 1947. DID IT EXPLAIN ON THE FILM IF THE 6-FINGERED BODIES WERE FOUND INSIDE A CRAFT? OR OUTSIDE ON THE GROUND? Some were thrown out of the craft, I believe, and some were inside the craft. But the beings inside the craft were dead. There was one being apparently alive that had been thrown out. WAS THERE ANY MENTION OF THE PLAINS OF ST. AUGUSTIN?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"No. The only thing the military man said was that it was ‘near the Roswell area.’ [ Editor's Note: The Plains of St. Augustin are about 50 miles west of Socorro. In 1995, British producer, Ray Santilli, publicly announced he had purchased from the original military cameraman some autopsy footage of two 6-fingered, non-human entities retrieved from a crashed UFO that Santilli said the cameraman dated between May 31 to June 2, 1947, which allegedly was a recovery operation at a crash site southwest of Socorro, New Mexico, near the Plains of San Augustin (west of Roswell and not between Corona and Roswell - an example of the persistent confusion about geographic locations and timelines for UFO crashes, which results from deliberate government insider efforts to hide UFO crash dates and locations).] Roswell Weather Balloon “Was A Cover Story” DID ANYBODY TALK ABOUT THE WEATHER BALLOON STORY BEING DELIBERATELY USED TO COVER-UP THE FACTS? Yes, they told us the weather balloon was a cover story. TO COVER UP THE FACT THAT EXTRATERRESTRIALS AND THEIR ADVANCED CRAFT WERE RETRIEVED. Yes. And I asked, ‘Why did you cover this up?’ 1958 at Area 51 was eleven years later and I asked, ‘Why do you continue to cover this up?’ USAF Colonel Jim said it was covered up originally because the Cold War was just starting with the Soviet Union. Somebody else in the U. S. government – and it must have been Harry Truman – had requested a tight cover on this because of the Cold War and now having aliens from other worlds flying around in the skies, Truman thought it would be too much for the American public all at once. But the cover-up was never lifted, and even to this day in 1998, the U. S. government is still covering the UFO phenomenon up with balloon stories and other misinformation. BALLOONS, SWAMP GAS, VENUS AND EVERYTHING ELSE. Yes, and that the little aliens were nothing more than wooden dummies in extreme high-flying balloons they had in 1947 to detect any radiation from Russian bomb tests. PROJECT MOGUL. Ye s . [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Project Mogul (sometimes referred to as Operation Mogul) was a top secret project by the US Army Air Forces involving high altitude balloons, whose primary purpose was long-distance detection of sound waves generated by the turbulence of the rising hot air from Soviet atomic bomb tests and ballistic missiles. The project was carried out from 1947 until late 1948 and was later succeeded by seismographs and spy satellites.” ] PROJECT MOGUL IS NOT THE EXPLANATION THOUGH, CORRECT? No. There were some high altitude balloons that landed in the Roswell region that the military did pick up later in the New Mexico White Sands area and even in Arizona. But there was nothing at that time in July 1947. As far as I know, there were no balloons or dummies until later in the 1950s. Wooden dummies didn’t even exist in 1947. YOU WERE DEFINITELY TOLD THAT THE WEATHER BALLOON STORY WAS A COVER FOR THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL TRUTH? Ye s . Why Do American Government Insiders Maintain A Policy of Denial About UFOs and E.T.s? AS WE SPEAK, IT IS NOW 1998. THIS IS FORTY-ONE YEARS AFTER YOU FIRST SAW THE 16MM BLACK AND WHITE FILM IN 1957 OF THE 6-FINGERED HUMANOID AUTOPSIES. THERE STILL SEEMS TO BE A POLICY OF DENIAL"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"ABOUT THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTERACTION WITH EARTH. WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THE U. S. GOVERNMENT HAS NOT TOLD AMERICAN CITIZENS AND THE WORLD WHAT THEY KNOW? You would think the government would have told the truth by now. Through the Cold War era back in the 1950s onward to the 1980s, the CIA in a lot of cases in regard to the unidentified flying objects did contact and work with the Russians to see what the Soviets had. And the Soviets had contacted us in regard to UFOs because they had UFO sightings also. The Soviets contacted us and asked if we had some kind of advanced flying craft from the United States. The Russians called Washington to tell us to keep such flying craft out of Russian skies. But we told them they were NOT ours. Extraterrestrial Agendas? IF RUSSIA AND THE UNITED STATES WERE SECRETLY TRYING TO TALK WITH EACH OTHER ABOUT AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL PRESENCE, DID YOU EVER HAVE ANY FURTHER INFORMATION OVER THE LAST 40 YEARS ABOUT WHAT THE AGENDAS OF THE HUMANOID BEINGS ARE? I know that we have worked together with Russia, especially since the Gorbachev thing when everything became more friendly. We know that Russia is developing particle beam weapons, too, from satellite and from ground. We had actually given them a particle beam weapon to shoot down saucer craft. WHY WOULD WE TRY TO SHOOT DOWN CRAFT IF WE PERCEIVED THE BEINGS TO BE BENEVOLENT? It could have been something that happened since the 1947 time period. I think there was an event over the Soviet Union. I know the Soviets had a big craft go over that was like a ‘mothership.’ They tried to shoot it down and the thing shot all their aircraft pursuing it right out of the air in only a few seconds using lasers or whatever the extraterrestrial craft’s weapons were. WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF YOUR INFORMATION ON THIS? This was through my CIA boss’s son who actually talked to me in 1993. He mentioned that there was an ugly incident where the aliens attacked some type of Soviet military base that had sent up jets to attack the big UFO. DID YOU EVER LEARN WHAT TYPE OF BEINGS WERE IN THAT CRAFT? No, I didn’t. It was a fly-over type thing and nothing landed from that one, so no humans would know what was inside the ‘mothership.’ But I know the big craft contained many smaller saucer craft, almost like we would have an aircraft carrier with airplanes on it. IN SUMMARY, YOU WENT FROM 1957 TO 1960 SEEING HIGHLY CLASSIFIED REPORTS ABOUT EXTRATERRESTRIAL BEINGS, TECHNOLOGY AND CRAFT. YOU ACTUALLY SAW 16MM BLACK AND WHITE FILM OF THE AUTOPSIES/DISSECTIONS OF 6-FINGERED HUMANOIDS. YOU WENT TO NEVADA TO NELLIS AFB AND AREA 51 GROOM LAKE WHERE YOU PERSONALLY SAW SIX DIFFERENT CRAFT AND THE LIVE BEING DESCRIBED AS A ‘GREY’ WITH LARGE BLACK EYES THAT WAS DIFFERENT FROM THE 6-FINGERED HUMANOIDS. YET, WHEN YOU LEFT THE U. S. ARMY SIGNAL CORPS AND CIA IN 1960, YOU STILL HAD NO UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THOSE BEINGS OR ANY OF THEM ARE HERE? Yes, that’s 100% right. At that time, there was a big question mark about why they were here. In some cases of U. S. sightings, they were tremendously friendly. FRIENDLY? Yes, friendly. Then abduction experiences came out later. There weren’t any in that original CIA Project Blue Book file that I had seen at that time. I know there were quite a few human abduction reports later. Worldwide Animal Mutilations Linked to Extraterrestrials"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"DID YOU EVER SEE ANY REFERENCES TO ANIMAL MUTILATIONS OR UNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHS? Yes. At that time, I think it was in Colorado – I saw some of those documents. Different parts of the animals were taken – stomach, sex organs and various parts - and they were all excised with a laser weapon of some kind, which left very precise cutting edges (that did not bleed). WERE ANIMAL MUTILATIONS HAPPENING IN THAT 1957 TO 1960 TIME FRAME WHEN YOU WERE WORKING FOR THE CIA? Yes, a few cases in Colorado. WAS THERE SPECULATION ON THE PART OF THE CIA OR MILITARY ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHS AND THE EXTRATERRESTRIALS? Yes. The only thought was that the E. T.s were taking various samples from Earth animals to see what their different body functions were. [ See comments by U. S. Army Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso in More Information below.] Nazi Germany Link to Some Discs WHY DO YOU THINK IN 1998, ALL OF THIS HAS STILL BEEN KEPT SECRET FROM THE PUBLIC AND WORLD AT LARGE? I think basically it’s because of the German UFO program that started way back in 1917 and they developed their first vehicle in 1927. Most people don’t know anything about this. Then after WWII, we did not capture any of those craft. They were all sent to Argentina and to the Antarctic base the Nazis had there since 1938 before the war even started. I think the whole thing is still being kept secret because our government does not know if it’s Nazis flying around or extraterrestrial aliens! BUT YOU SAW WITH YOUR OWN EYES A NON-HUMAN BEING AT AREA 51. Yes, I did. But I mean as far as the overall picture about why our government hasn’t announced the truth? Why is it so top secret? And why lie about it after all these years? I believe we have reverse-engineered some of the alien craft and we have some flying models. But as far as I know, we were never able to reverse-engineer the aerial craft that was thought-driven by the 6-fingered humanoids through their headbands and fingertip pads that interfaced with the entire craft. DO YOU THINK THAT EVERYTHING THAT’S KNOWN ABOUT THE PHENOMENON SHOULD BE TOLD IN ITS ENTIRETY TODAY? Yes, I think it should. There are still unexplained sightings all over the planet. Down here in my state, we have a lot of saucer sightings. THIS IS WHY YOU ARE TALKING TO ME? Ye s . I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT MY PHONE BEING TAPPED. I THINK IF OUR GOVERNMENT WANTS TO TAP ANYONE’S PHONE, THEY WILL DO IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. Yes, they will. And if you change your phone number, they will get right on that. SO, I HAVE TO KEEP GOING FORWARD WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT IT. Yes, let’s get this mystery solved before maybe it’s too late.” C ontinued in Part 5 More Information : The Day After Roswell"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"T he Day After Roswell © 1997 by Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso (Ret.). C lick for Amazon.com. Pages 180 - 183: “In the Pentagon from 1961 to 1963, I reviewed field reports from local and state police agencies about the discoveries of dead cattle whose carcasses looked as though they had ben systematically mutilated and reports from people who claimed to have been abducted by aliens and experimented on. One of the common threads in these stories were reports by the self-described abductees of being subjected to some sort of probing or even a form of surgery with controlled, intense, pencil-thin beams of light. Local police reported that when veterinarians were called to the scene to examine the dead cattle left in fields, they often found evidence not just that the animal's blood had been drained, but that entire organs were removed with such surgical skill that it couldn't have been the work of predators or vandals removing the organs for some depraved ritual. “...In those cases where investigators claimed to have been baffled by what they found, the removal of the organs and the draining of the animal's blood - where blood had been completely drained - were so sophisticated that there was almost no peripheral damage to the surrounding tissue. There was even some speculation, in the early 1960s, that whatever device the EBEs had employed, it didn't even cut through the surrounding tissue (but separated cell-by-cell). We had no medical instruments that even remotely approached what the aliens could do. It was as though some device had simply excised the organs with techniques that even went beyond our own surgical precision. “While I was on the White House National Security staff and later when I was at the pentagon, I was intrigued by these (mutilation) reports. I also remember that both civilian and military intelligence personnel attached to the staffs of individuals who worked for the Hillenkoetter (CIA Director) and Twining (Gen. Nathan Twining) working group on UFOs in the 1950s were actively engaging in research into the kinds of surgical methods that would produce ‘crime scene evidence’ like this. “It was the EBEs (extraterrestrial biological entities) who were experimenting with organ harvesting, possibly for transplant into other species or for processing into some sort of nutrient package or even to create some sort of hybrid biological entity (android). “Although the first public reports of cattle mutilations surfaced around 1967 in Colorado, at the White House we were reading about the mutilation stories that had been kept out of the press as far back as the 1950s, especially in the area around Colorado. (Col. Corso told me privately the earliest mutilation report he read was dated 1951.) “In these reports of mutilations, forensic examination showed no evidence of collateral trauma or even inflammation. ...This meant that whoever was operating on these animals did so in a matter of minutes. ...It was the EBEs' use of directed energy as a medical tool and ultimately as a potential weapon that sent shivers up and down our spines because to our minds it was evidence of the aliens' hostile intentions.” F or further information about 1947 Roswell UFO crashes and retrievals, please see my books in the Earthfiles Shop and reports below in the Earthfiles Archive : • 08/09/2008 — Part 5: Original Carbon of Scorched Memo, Project JEHOVAH and"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Physicists Oppenheimer and Einstein • 08/06/2008 — Updated - Part 3: Original Carbon of Scorched Memo Links Government UFO Cover-Up and JFK Assassination • 08/06/2008 — Part 4: Original Carbon of Scorched Memo Links Government UFO Cover-Up and JFK Assassination • 07/26/2008 — Part 1: Why No Military Response to Radar Unknown Headed to Bush Crawford Ranch on January 8, 2008? • 07/25/2008 — Apollo Astronaut Edgar Mitchell Says Governments Covering Up E.
