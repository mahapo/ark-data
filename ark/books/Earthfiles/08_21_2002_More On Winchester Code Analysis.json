Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon More On Winchester Code Analysis © 2002 by Linda Moulton Howe Face and code wheat formation 250 feet wide by 360 feet long at Vale Farm next to Crabwood forest in the village of Pitt near Winchester, Hampshire, U.K., first reported by e-mail on August 15, 2002, one year after the August 14, 2001 face and code appeared at the Chilbolton Radio Observatory. Aerial photograph © 2002 by Lucy Pringle, http://home.clara.net/lucypringle. August 21, 2002 Pitt near Winchester, Hampshire, U. K. In my effort to keep reporting various new developments in this story, I am sharing here three recent e-mails that might have direct bearing on the formation's creation and code construction.

As there is a clear implication within their site that they created it. http://www.circlemakers.org/totc2002.html \". To help the research effort can we suggest using this site once you've managed to extrapolate all of the ones and zeros.\" This is an ASCII conversion table.\" Their site was Updated 16th Aug 2002. This will help to eliminate one possibility. 2) This is my top current conjecture:- ELI also means English Language Indicator in the braille transcription code. Interestingly Braille is encoded in 6bits which hopefully will cross-refence with the 12 bits of data. Braille is possibly a perfect format to rapidly communicate complex ideas.
