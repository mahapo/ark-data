The magnetic polarity of the sunspot, revealed by SOHO magnetograms, show that it is a member of new Solar Cycle 24.” Update July 11, 2009 Podcast / July 8, 2009 Timberlake, North Carolina - A year ago on June 7, 2008, I received an email from a man who retired from an astrophysics career and is now a semi-retired technology consultant for electronic and electro-optics industries, living in Timberlake, North Carolina. Mike Reed worked at the University of Arizona in Tucson on the Multi-Mirror Telescope (MMT) at Mt. Hopkins, a joint venture with the Harvard Smithsonian Observatory. He had been studying an aerial photograph of the June 1, 2008, formation in barley at Barbury Castle, Wiltshire, England, and emailed me his discovery. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"June 5, 2008 from Mike Reed: “ Hello Earthfiles, “On looking at the Barbary Castle pattern, the ratio of the angles of the radial jumps is apparently the first ten (10) digits of the mathematical constant Pi to 3.141592654. [ Pi is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to the diameter]. “The fact that the Pi decimal point is included and there is rounding up to 10 decimal places is to me a little mind boggling!” Y ellow graphic overlay created by Earthfiles viewer Steve McMath based on June 5, 2008, Michael Reed drawing for Earthfiles.com. An Australian scientist, who requests anonymity, contacted Mike Reed about the Pi discovery and the two men continued a collaboration in analyses of other 2008 crop formation patterns. When the spring 2009 crop patterns in England started April 14, 2009, at The Ridgeway near Avebury, the scientists proposed the pattern was a megalithic sundial that was followed soon after at the West Kennett Longbarrow, also near Avebury, by what might be a solar eclipse counter based on Mayan glyphs and symbols. Then came a large and precisely defined “sunburst” at Rutland's Farm, also near Avebury. The sun seemed to be the theme and on April 24, 2009, came a pattern the scientists interpreted as three monthly phase cycles of the Earth's moon. When the lunar cycle information was combined with the next oilseed rape pattern at Peaks Down near Swindon, perhaps about solar flares and “the apogee and perigee of a full moon,\" the scientists asked: “What will happen on the sun July 7, 2009?” And a countdown began - Would there be an outstanding solar event on that date? I think it is stunning that the most intense sunspot activity in nearly three years of an abnormally quiet sun occurred between July 5 and 6 right up to July 7. There was a solar physics meeting in Boulder, Colorado, in mid-June and the hottest topic was why is the sun so quiet and when will it come back alive? Then Sunspot 1024 erupted suddenly on July 5 - each spot the size of Earth, each spot 8,000 miles in diameter. By July 8, the sunspots had grown to the size of Jupiter, 78,000 miles across! By 1:06 UT July 7, the huge, intense sunspots had projected two large solar flares into space and a large coronal hole also opened up on the sun, releasing increased solar radiation that would reach Earth around July 9. Perhaps the Spring 2009 oilseed rape crop formations were a test to see who would pay"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"attention. Now, we need a Rosetta Stone for the June 30 Milk Hill “alien symbols,” the June 27 South Field “electrical grids” and beyond! On July 7, I interviewed physicist Mike Reed about his perspective of the sudden, huge and intense Sunspot 1024 forming within forty-eight hours of July 7, 2009. Interview: Michael A. Reed, retired optical physicist and President, Reed Development Associates, Inc., Timberlake, North Carolina: “It’s interesting that the original timing came from the April 24th Morgan’s Hill oilseed rape pattern and that formation pointed to July 7, which was also the partial (penumbral) eclipse of the moon. So, there was an astronomical event that was going to occur on that date. The Australian scientist and I associated that with the patterns that seemed to highlight the sun and a July 7, 2009, forecast of a significant solar event looked pretty valid. THE DRAMA OF GOING FROM A QUIET SUN TO AN INTENSITY THAT IS BEING DESCRIBED AT SPACEWEATHER.COM AS THE SINGLE MOST INTENSE SUNSPOT ERUPTION IN OVER TWO YEARS SO CLOSE TO JULY 7, IT IS AS IF SOMETHING WERE MAKING US PAY ATTENTION TO THE SUN AT EXACTLY THE TIME THAT IT SWITCHED FROM ABNORMAL QUIET INTO THIS NEW INTENSITY. That’s true. That certainly is valid. I think the interpretation of a lot of the symbols in terms of a major event that was going to affect the Earth, we may have become overly enthusiastic about forecasting that! But when you look at the situation in April 2009, where you have a completely quiet sun and there is no indication that anything is going to happen on the sun. One could have said, ‘Well, nothing is going to happen for a year.’ Nobody knew! I remember you interviewed several solar scientists who said they had no idea when the sun was going to wake up again. RIGHT. So, then to have the crop circles pointed toward the indication there will be solar activity is certainly significant. Then the fact that the July 7 date came up and that something was going to happen around then – well, something did happen! It wasn’t perhaps as spectacular as we had thought, but certainly from the point of view of a very active solar area, that certainly did occur. That Sunspot 1024 is an extremely active area. You can see the magnetic loops in it, very strong! When you watch the hourly movie of it, the sunspots have been very active. So, in that sense, the overall predictive timing is valid. How Strong Will Solar Cycle 24 and Its 2013 Maximum Be? One of the other issues now that the sun has become active, if you took away the focus on July 7, and looked back over the past few months, there have been quite a few patterns that seemed to relate to the sun and a potential event on July 7. It could also mean that the crop formation intelligence has been saying, ‘This is going to be a whopper of a solar cycle.’ I think there are some physicists who think that is the case, just based on the physics of previous sunspot cycles, that we are due for a somewhat major cycle this time. Certainly, if the formations become more astronomical and we get more intense solar storms, there will be repercussions in terms of potential power outages and some of the effects that solar flares can have on Earth by breaking down communications and things like that. As we go forward in time and this turns out to be an extremely active solar period going towards 2013, it’s going to be more and more important to study the sun. Crop Formation “Language”? FROM APRIL 14 TO JULY 7, 2009, IT MIGHT BE ARGUED THAT THIS HAS BEEN AN EVOLVING ‘LANGUAGE’ COMMUNICATION – NOT LANGUAGE THAT HUMANS HAVE UNDERSTOOD, BUT YOU AND THE AUSTRALIAN SCIENTIST ARE BEGINNING TO SEE AND UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT THE FORECASTING INTELLIGENCE IN THE CROP PATTERNS, WHICH MIGHT BECOME VALUABLE AS WE MOVE TOWARDS THE NEXT SOLAR MAX. Yes, and I think one of the things that comes out of the last three months is the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"introduction of the strange symbol fields that have never been seen before. We’ve all seen a lot of individual symbols in crop patterns before, but nothing like the strings of symbols at Milk Hill reported June 30, and South Field reported June 27. They look sort of like gibberish, but all that means is we don’t understand anything about what they are doing. It’s also something that shows up as the ‘day’ symbol in the Mayan glyphs that mean ‘the day.’ There are also symbols that are equivalent to the Mayan number system: 11, 13 and 1 showed up several times. That’s interesting that we are seeing things like that. The rest of the symbols are incomprehensible! CHARLES MALLETT CONFIRMED THAT EACH OF THOSE FIVE STRINGS OF ALIEN-LOOKING SYMBOLS IN MILK HILL WAS 700-FEET-LONG AND THE ENTIRE FORMATION WAS OVER 1,100 FEET. AND IT RAINED ON AND OFF ALL NIGHT JUNE 29 TO 30. You don’t do that overnight – especially when it’s raining! It will be interesting to see if the symbols are repeated. If so, the better the chance of finding a Rosetta Stone embedded where some symbols get repeated and can become decoded in some intelligent fashion. So far, it’s been very hard. There are some repeating symbols. One is the decreasing, rectangular spiral, which has shown up a few times in different spiral lengths. Y ellow circles mark where a rectangular spiral symbol appears in the five lines, each 700-foot-long, of “alien symbols” that were first reported on June 30, 2009, as the third addition to the Milk Hill complex pattern that began on the Summer Solstice, June 21, 2009.

Charles Mallett Investigates Milk Hill Symbols On June 30, 2009 On Tuesday, June 30, 2009, Charles Mallett, Manager of the Silent Circle Research Centre in Compton Bassett, Wiltshire, learned that a third stage of strange symbols had been added to the Milk Hill Summer Solstice pattern. That afternoon he walked the long, five strings of \"alien symbols,\" estimating each line to be at least 700 feet long. All the symbols were \"precise and clean and each line was no more than three to four feet from the next line. There was no mud on any of the symbols that I examined even though it had rained off and on all night long (June 29 to 30, 2009).\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"T hree ground images of “alien symbols” in third addition to Milk Hill Summer Solstice formation reported on Tuesday, June 30, 2009, and photographed with camera on pole © 2009 by Charles R. Mallett."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Charles Mallett, Manager of the Silent Circle Research Centre in Compton Bassett, Wiltshire: “Regarding the Milk Hill symbols, most people who went there and looked at it really liked it. As you can tell from my ground shot photography, it's very well-defined, very sharp, perfect in practically all ways. But, scratching along the edges of the peripheral areas, there is constant and regular crushing on the plants. BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIVE LINES OF SYMBOLS AT LEAST 700 FEET LONG. HOW COULD ANY HUMANS DO SO MANY SYMBOLS WITH SUCH PRECISION BETWEEN 10 PM AT NIGHT AND 4:30 AM WHEN THE SUN CAME UP ? I don't know. I don't know anybody who could do that. But I'm just saying there was some regular damage around the periphery when I was there on the afternoon of the first day, June 30. I do understand that lots of people had already been there. And for all I know, the peripheral damage I saw could occur in some paranormally generated energy delivery system. We don't have a full understanding of the energetic source behind the genuine phenomenon. But the damage I saw on the periphery was consistent with what I've seen in people damage. WHAT WAS THE WEATHER LIKE THAT NIGHT? Interesting, because that was my first question. In fact a friend of mine went there before me and I asked them to have a real good look for mud because it should be covered in mud if it is faked because it had rained that night (June 29-30). But the added symbols were not muddy. Yet, I found the crushing along the edges. SO THE CONFUSION IS THAT THE SYMBOLS THEMSELVES APPEARED CLEAN, PRISTINE AND PERFECT, BUT THERE WAS EDGE DAMAGE? Yes, that's how it was. THE SCIENTISTS HAVE SAID THIS IS EITHER THE MOST SOPHISTICATED HOAX OF ALL TIME, OR IT IS AN ADVANCED INTELLIGENCE TRYING TO COMMUNICATE. Yes, I would say looking at the formation as a whole now that has three stages and is really huge! HOW LONG IS THE WHOLE THING NOW? The strings of symbols are 700 feet long and the rest of the pattern is at least 400 or more feet in addition, so it's more than a thousand feet long. And in the fields below Milk Hill, there are now half a dozen patterns and it looks really odd. I don't think that many have been in the same stretch of land before and the farmer is not going to be happy about that! When I stood in there and started walking down it, the formation goes on and on and it's like miles of these symbols. It's pretty phenomenal that can occur at night.” Are Symbols About Strengthening Solar Cycle? Mike Reed, Physicist, Timberlake, North Carolina: “IF YOU WERE SPECULATING ABOUT THE INTELLIGENCE BEHIND MILK HILL AND SOUTH FIELD AND THE SPRING OILSEED RAPE FORMATIONS, WHAT WOULD YOU SPECULATE MIGHT BE THE REASONS THAT THE CIRCLE MAKERS WORKED HARD TO FOCUS ON THE SUN AND ASTRONOMICAL CYCLES? If this were going to be an extremely strong Solar Cycle 24, then I would expect to see these patterns and symbols showing up again and again. I would also expect, if this kind of communication is going on, that the strings of strange symbols would be repeated in other formations with new information in them. It seems that most of what has gone on so far this year, one way or the other, was related to the sun and could be interpreted that way. But in terms of the implication that it’s ‘pay attention to the sun’– that is perhaps the bottom line. We should probably be seeing more formations that relate to that and more with specific symbol script associated with them. It’s very much like looking at hieroglyphics and without the Rosetta Stone, you’re kind of sunk. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Math Embedded in Crop Formations YOU, MIKE, ARE THE BREAKTHROUGH WHEN IT COMES TO FIGURING OUT PI IN THE 2008 BARBURY CASTLE FORMATION. THAT SEEMED TO IMPLY THAT A HIGH INTELLIGENCE EMBEDDED INFORMATION IN AT LEAST THAT CROP FORMATION. [ See 060808 Earthfiles about Pi formation.] I could not agree more! Just to think up this stuff and it all happens in the dark of night?! MOST EVERYONE AGREES THAT THE CROP FORMATIONS BETWEEN APRIL 14 AND ABOUT MID-JUNE OF 2009 IN THE OILSEED RAPE SPECIFICALLY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MADE BY HUMANS. Right, and I think that’s the smoking gun. It’s an impossible thing to create huge, precise, unbroken patterns in oilseed rape, such as Morgan's Hill, and those are the formations that pointed directly to solar activity - even one oilseed pattern looked like an angry, active sun. PERHAPS FOR THE FIRST TIME, WE ARE BEGINNING TO RELATE TO CROP FORMATIONS AS EMBEDDED MATH AND AN ‘ALIEN LANGUAGE,’ AND WHAT WE NEED IS A ROSETTA STONE TO ACCELERATE THE UNDERSTANDING. Yes, if those are the only times (Summer Solstice of 2009 and June 30) those symbols are used, then it’s kind of an anomaly. But if we get other formations where those kinds of character strings or symbolic strings are repeated, then that’s going to get very interesting. Then one could look for repeated characters and see if we can make some sense of them. The graphic part is sometimes fairly straightforward. But those symbols (at Milk Hill and South Field) are just frankly bizarre. (laughs) It’s hard to imagine the mind that created them. When they are as long and big as they are and done over night on rainy nights, it stretches the imagination – and being done very well, very crisply. You know, it’s just hard for people to take something that is so foreign seriously. It’s like your head just does not want to accept it and so you dismiss it. (laughs) Impact of Strong Solar Flares and CMEs On Earth Now, the question going forward is: What happens next? Do we see more of these symbol strings? Do we get an opportunity to look at more of them and understand them? Will we see more concern about the sun? Are there other astronomical events that are depicted? The formation makers have done that in the past about the solar system eclipses and conjunction of planets as a way of communicating in a non-threatening way. But the focus on the sun and the potential for serious activity as we go forward is something that’s going to be interesting to see if there is a follow up. Relative to solar activity, if it becomes extremely strong, there could be significant damage to the highly industrialized countries because we are so dependent upon communications. ON SATELLITES. Satellites and the power grid. If you look at what happens on a high voltage system where you have a 3-wire system in three phases and you have a Y-shaped structure with three wires connecting these things at either end. Then the center of where the three coils – the windings of the transformer – where they are joined together in the center, that becomes the ground line and that gets actually physically referenced to the local ground where that transformer is. If you produce enough energy coming from the sun into the atmosphere and start producing potential differences on the surface of the Earth, that energy can go through the ground line and then run down all three of the transmission wires together. That’s not an AC current. It’s a very large, massive DC current. Once you saturate the core of a transformer by putting a large DC current through it, then it stops acting as a transformer and the DC current alone can be enough to melt wires. And you can damage the transformer to the point where it is put out of commission. The big transformers, the 700,000-volt units and the 360,000-volt transformers – these things are not nickels and dimes. They are very expensive and they are not stocked on shelves. SO IF A TRANSFORMER MELTED, IT WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME TO RESTORE?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Yes. That’s why the space weather alerts are so important in order to give the power grids time to disconnect or do whatever they have to do to prevent operating during one of these major solar events. Then there is the issue of satellite communications going down, potential damage to GPS (Global Positioning System) satellites from intense radiation. If there is a focus on the sun and potential strength of solar emissions, then perhaps it is like someone trying to warn us about the potential risks associated. If it turns out to be a strong solar cycle and there is nothing you can do and satellites could fail, then you are going to lose a lot of communications capabilities. If GPS were damaged and some satellites were fried, that’s a major problem in our ability to fly airplanes, navigate and so on. We are very dependent on GPS! WE COULD BE DEALING WITH AN INTELLIGENCE IN THE UNSEEN THAT WANTS US TO UNDERSTAND ITS LANGUAGE SO IT COULD WARN? Yes, that’s certainly a possibility. That’s why I think it’s hard for your mind to sit there and say, ‘This is real’ – in the sense that this is something that looks very alien, very kind of bizarre, but it’s happening and happening so big (in scale) that I think it can’t be a hoax or faked by people running around with boards and strings.” M ilk Hill, Wiltshire County, England, Summer Solstice crop formation that evolved in three parts.
