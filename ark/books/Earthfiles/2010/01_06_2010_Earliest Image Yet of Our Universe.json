January 6, 2010 Baltimore, Maryland - NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has brokenthe distance limit for galaxies and uncovered a primordial population of compact andultra-blue galaxies that have never been seen before. The deeper Hubble looks into space,the farther back in time it looks, because light takes billions of years to cross theobservable universe. This makes Hubble a powerful “time machine” that allowsastronomers to see galaxies as they were 13 billion years ago, just 600 million to 800million years after the Big Bang that started our universe.NASA: This is the deepest image of the universe ever taken in near-infraredlight by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. The faintest and reddest objects (inleft insets of largest image above) are galaxies that correspond to “look-backtimes” of approximately 12.9 billion years to 13.1 billion years ago. Nogalaxies have been seen before at such early epochs. These galaxies are muchsmaller than the Milky Way galaxy and have populations of stars that areintrinsically very blue. This may indicate the galaxies are so primordial thatthey are deficient in heavier elements, and as a result, are quite free of thedust that reddens light through scattering.The image was taken with Hubble's newly installed Wide Field Camera 3(WFC3), which collects light from near-infrared wavelengths and thereforelooks even deeper into the universe. The light from very distant galaxies isstretched out of the ultraviolet and visible regions of the spectrum intonear-infrared wavelengths by the expansion of the universe.Named after the trailblazing astronomer Edwin P. Hubble (1889-1953),the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is a large, space-based observatory which hasrevolutionized astronomy by providing unprecedented deep and clear views of ouruniverse, ranging from our ow n solar system to extremely remote fledglinggalaxies forming not long after the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Hubble's WFC3 took this image in late August 2009 during a total of four daysof pointing for 173,000 seconds of exposure time. Infrared light is invisibleand therefore does not have colors that can be perceived by the human eye.The colors in the image are assigned comparatively short, medium, and longnear-infrared wavelengths (blue, 1.05 microns; green, 1.25 microns; and red,1.6 microns). The representation is \"natural\" in that blue objects appear blueand red objects look red. The faintest objects are about one-billionth as brightas can be seen with the naked eye. The galaxy distances are estimated fromthe infrared colors of their light.These Hubble observations are trailblazing a path for Hubble's successor, theJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which will look even farther into theuniverse than Hubble, at infrared wavelengths. The JWST is planned to belaunched in 2014.This August 2009 view of the universe was taken by Hubble's new infrared camera combinedwith the deepest-ever optical image taken in 2004.

Illingworth (UCO/LickObservatory and University of California, Santa Cruz), and the HUDF09 Team.The data from Hubble's new infrared camera, the Wide Field Camera 3(WFC3), on the Ultra Deep Field (taken in August 2009) have been analyzedby no less than five international teams of astronomers. A total of 15 papershave been submitted to date by astronomers worldwide. Some of these earlyresults are being presented by various team members on Jan. 6, 2010, at the215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington, D.C.“With the rejuvenated Hubble and its new instruments, we are now enteringunchartered territory that is ripe for new discoveries,” says Garth Illingworthof the University of California, Santa Cruz, leader of the survey team that wasawarded the time to take the new WFC3 infrared data on the Hubble UltraDeep Field (imaged in visible light by the Advanced Camera for Surveys in2004). “The deepest-ever near-infrared view of the universe -- the HUDF09image -- has now been combined with the deepest-ever optical image -- theoriginal HUDF (taken in 2004) -- to push back the frontiers of the searches forthe first galaxies and to explore their nature,” Illingworth says.Rychard Bouwens of the University of California, Santa Cruz, a member ofIllingworth's team and leader of a paper on the striking properties of thesegalaxies, says that, “the faintest galaxies are now showing signs of linkage totheir origins from the first stars. They are so blue that they must be extremelydeficient in heavy elements, thus representing a population that has nearlyprimordial characteristics.”James Dunlop of the University of Edinburgh, agrees. “These galaxies couldhave roots stretching into an earlier population of stars. There must be asubstantial component of galaxies beyond Hubble's detection limit.”"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"This is good news for astronomers building the much more powerful JamesWebb Space Telescope (planned for launch in 2014), which will allowastronomers to study the detailed nature of primordial galaxies and discovermany more even farther away. There should be a lot for Webb to hunt for.The deep observations also demonstrate the progressive buildup of galaxiesand provide further support for the hierarchical model of galaxy assemblywhere small objects accrete mass, or merge, to form bigger objects over asmooth and steady but dramatic process of collision and agglomeration. It'slike streams merging into tributaries and then into a bay.“These galaxies are only 1/20th the Milky Way's diameter,” reports HUDF09team member Pascal Oesch of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology inZurich. “Yet they must be the seeds from which the great galaxies of todaywere formed,” adds HUDF09 team member Marcella Carollo of the SwissFederal Institute of Technology.These newly found objects are crucial to understanding the evolutionary linkbetween the birth of the first stars, the formation of the first galaxies, and thesequence of evolutionary events that resulted in the assembly of our MilkyWay and the other “mature” elliptical and majestic spiral galaxies in today'suniverse. Primordial Galaxies Are Only 1%of Milky Way MassThe HUDF09 team also combined the new Hubble data with observationsfrom NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope to estimate the ages and masses ofthese primordial galaxies. “The masses are just 1 percent of those of the MilkyWay,” explains team member Ivo Labbe of the Carnegie Institute ofWashington, leader of two papers on the data from the combined NASA GreatObservatories. He further noted that “to our surprise, the results show thatthese galaxies at 700 million years after the Big Bang must have startedforming stars hundreds of millions of years earlier, pushing back the time ofthe earliest star formation in the universe.”The results are gleaned from the HUDF09 observations, which are deepenough at near-infrared wavelengths to reveal galaxies at redshifts from z=7to beyond redshift z=8. (The redshift value z is a measure of the stretching ofthe wavelength or “reddening” of starlight due to the expansion of space.) Theclear detection of galaxies between z=7 and z=8.5 corresponds to look-backtimes of approximately 12.9 billion years to 13.1 billion years ago.“This is about as far as we can go to do detailed science with the newHUDF09 image. This shows just how much the James Webb Space Telescope(JWST) is needed to unearth the secrets of the first galaxies,” says Illingworth.The challenge is that spectroscopy is needed to provide definitive redshiftvalues, but the objects are too faint for spectroscopic observations (untilJWST is launched). Therefore, the redshifts are inferred by the galaxies'apparent colors through a now very well-established technique.The teams are finding that the number of galaxies per unit of volume of spacedrops off smoothly with increasing distance, and the HUDF09 team has alsofound that the galaxies become surprisingly blue intrinsically. The ultra-bluegalaxies are extreme examples of objects that appear so blue because theymay be deficient in heavier elements, and as a result, quite free of the dustthat reddens light through scattering. What Caused Reionization of the Early Universe?“This is an enigma that still challenges astronomersand the very best telescopes.”A longstanding problem with these findings is that it still appears that theseearly galaxies did not put out enough radiation to “reionize” the early universeby stripping electrons off the neutral hydrogen that cooled after the Big Bang.This “ reionization” event occurred between about 400 million and 900 millionyears after the Big Bang, but astronomers still don't know which sources of"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"light caused it to happen. These new galaxies are being seen right in thisimportant epoch in the evolution of the universe.Perhaps the density of very faint galaxies below the current detection limit isso high that there may be enough of them to support reionization. Or therewas an earlier wave of galaxy formation that decayed and then was“rebooted” by a second wave of galaxy formation. Or, possibly the earlygalaxies were extraordinarily efficient at reionizing the universe.Due to these uncertainties it is not clear what type of object or evolutionaryprocess did the heavy lifting by ionizing the young universe. The calculationsremain rather uncertain, and so galaxies may do more than currentlyexpected, or astronomers may need to invoke other phenomena such asmini-quasars (active supermassive black holes in the cores of galaxies) --current estimates suggest however that quasars are even less likely thangalaxies to be the cause of reionization. This is an enigma that still challengesastronomers and the very best telescopes.“As we look back into the epoch of the first galaxies in the universe, from aredshift of 6 to a redshift of 8 and possibly beyond, these new observationsindicate that we are likely seeing the end of reionization, and perhaps eveninto the reionization era, which is the last major phase transition of the gas inthe universe,” says Rogier Windhorst of Arizona State University, leader ofone of the other teams that analyzed the WFC3 data. “Though the exactinterpretation of these new results remains under debate, these new WFC3data may provide an exciting new view of how galaxy formation proceededduring and at the end of the reionization era.”Hubble's WFC3/IR camera was able to make deep exposures to uncover newgalaxies at roughly 40 times greater efficiency than its earlier infrared camerathat was installed in 1997. The WFC3/IR brought new infrared technology toHubble and accomplished in four days of observing what would havepreviously taken almost half a year for Hubble to do.More Information:For more information about the Hubble Space Telescope and our cosmos, please see theEarthfiles Archive reports below:• 12/24/2009 — Does the Allen Hills Meteorite from Mars Contain Fossilized Microbial Life?• 05/15/2007 — Hubble Finds Dark Matter Ring• 01/19/2007 — Impact of China's Anti-Sat Weapon's Test Debris?• 01/07/2007 — Universe's Mysterious Dark Matter - First 3-D Map• 12/19/2006 — First Stars - Or First Black Holes - in Universe?• 12/23/2005 — Hubble Telescope Discovers More Moons and Rings Around Uranus• 12/17/2005 — Sirius's Companion Star, Sirius B, Finally \"Weighed\"• 11/09/2005 — Dust Storm On Mars, Cosmic First Light and Black Hole At Our Galaxy'sCenter• 07/10/2005 — First Data from Deep Impact Crash Into Comet Tempel I• 06/29/2005 — July 3-4, 2005: NASA \"Deep Impact\" Spacecraft to Blast Hole in CometTemple I• 05/07/2005 — Did Milky Way Gas and Dust Turn Earth Into Icy Snowball Four Times?• 10/07/2004 — Exploding Stars: Investigating the 1604 and 1987 Supernovas• 03/05/2004 — Part 3 - Mars: A Sulfate Salty Planet - Could It Have Sulfate-LovingMicrobes?• 03/03/2004 — Part 2 - Mars: Scientific Challenge of Identifying Substances• 02/23/2004 — Is There Liquid Water on Martian Surface?• 02/03/2004 — Planet 150 Light Years from Earth Has Oxygen and Carbon Atmosphere• 05/14/2003 — Hubble Telescope Finds \"Ashes\" of First Stars in This Universe• 01/05/2003 — What Are the Grooves in the Martian South Pole?• 09/07/2002 — Does Gravity Travel the Same Speed as Light?• 07/11/2002 — Hubble Telescope Photographs Seven Objects Traveling In Pairs BeyondPluto• 06/01/2002 — Scientists Surprised by Abundance of Water On Mars• 12/24/2000 — Martian Bacteria?• 12/14/2000 — A Pleiadian Star Tears Apart Black Interstellar Cloud• 11/26/2000 — Hubble Telescope Solves Puzzle of Stephan's Quintet of Galaxies• 10/09/2000 — Astronomy Updates• 04/24/2000 — A Black Hole in the Big Dipper?• 01/28/2000 — Black Hole Mystery at the Center of the Andromeda Galaxy• 12/26/1999 — Hubble Repair, Gamma Ray Bursts and Unidentified Aerial Objects• 11/07/1999 — Environmental Updates and Calf Fetus Shocks Los Brazos, New Mexico• 02/01/1999 — Astronomy Updates with Brian Marsden and John Huchra, HarvardWebsites:Hubble Space Telescope: http://hubblesite.org/"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2010/02/NASA Hubble: http://www.nasa.gov/hubble Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2010 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2010, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
