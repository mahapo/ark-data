DID ANYONE AT EDWARDS AFB TALKABOUT THAT?Not from Edwards, but I met a man who seemed to know a lot about three differentplanets at war with each other and non-humans that use some kind of powerful weapons.But I don't know any details.DID YOU EVER WORK WITH VANEVAR BUSH, PH.D.?Yes, mostly on mathematics.Vannevar Bush, Ph.D., Electrical Engineer, March 11, 1890 – June 28, 1974.Dr. Vannevar Bush with glasses shaking hands with first Secretary of Defense,James Forrestal, after Dr. Bush was sworn in as Chairman of the Research and DevelopmentBoard on September 30, 1947. From: The Forrestal Diaries © 1951 edited by Walter Millis.[ Editor's Note: Bush was Vice-President and Dean of Engineering at MIT inBoston, Massachusetts, from 1932 to 1938. In June 1940 he convinced U. S.President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to give him funding and political supportto create a new kind of collaborative relationship between military, industry,and academic researchers that had no congressional oversight and hardly anyother oversight. While at MIT, Bush urged Col. Edward C. Harwood to foundthe American Institute for Economic Research as an independent, scientificresearch institute.Bush was appointed in June 1940 by FDR to be Chairman of the new National"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Defense Research Committee (NDRC). During 1941, the NDRC wassubsumed into the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD)with Bush as director, which controlled the Manhattan Project to develop theatomic bomb until 1943. That year the Manhattan Project's administration wastaken over by the U. S. Army. In all, OSRD directed 30,000 men and oversawdevelopment of some 200 weapons and instruments of war, including sonar,radar, the proximity fuse, amphibious vehicles, and the Norden bomb sight, allconsidered critical in winning WWII. At one time, two-thirds of all thenation’s physicists were working under Vannevar Bush’s direction. ]WHAT WAS THE PROJECT?It had something to do with warfare, but was classified. I can't discuss what it was. Heworked on many kinds of military systems. I can't tell you any more than I've told you. Weneed to get off him altogether.BUT HE'S DEAD LONG AGO. WHAT WAS HE INVOLVED IN THAT WAS SOSENSITIVE?He was in a highly classified position and had many projects handed to him at one time.There is enough classified material left behind by that man, it could wreck the country.NOW THAT DR. BUSH IS GONE AND EVERYTHING OLDER THAN 25 YEARS ISSUPPOSED TO BE DECLASSIFIED, WHY COULDN'T YOU TELL ME WHAT YOUWERE WORKING ON BACK IN THE 1940S?The point is, I can tell you how to make the hydrogen bomb. And that's been over 25years, but I don't think I should. I'd get my head cut off for that.WERE YOU EVER IN A MEETING WITH VANNEVAR BUSH AND ALBERTEINSTEIN TOGETHER?No, but I know Einstein had some meetings with Vannevar Bush about getting money tobuild the Fermi lab in Chicago.DID YOU EVER TALK WITH VANNEVAR BUSH ABOUT EXTRATERRESTRALBODIES AND SPACECRAFT?No.DID YOU TALK ABOUT THE SPACECRAFT AND BEINGS WITH ANYONE ELSEBEYOND DR.

ZACHARIAS?Jerrold Reinach Zacharias, Ph.D., January 23, 1905–July 16, 1986,was an American physicist and professor at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology (MIT), Cambridge, Massachussetts. Photograph from National Academy of Sciences.[ Editor's Note: From Biographical Memoirs by National Academy ofSciences - “Jerrold R. Zacharias was given at assignment at MIT in 1940 toestablish a lab on the MIT roof and build a radar system capable of detectingdistant objects. His success led to his being asked by the U. S. Navy to install aradar set on a destroyer. When this was successfully completed, Zachariasbecame the Radiation Laboratory representative at the Bell TelephoneLaboratories in Whippany, New Jersey during the development of aproduction model for the MIT 10-cm. night fighter radar.“Zacharias left MIT in 1945 a few months before the end of WWII (August1945) to go to Los Alamos, New Mexico, to head the Ordnance EngineeringDivision, a position vacated by Captain (later Admiral) W. S. Parsons, whohad left for the Pacific island of Tinian. That OED division later became the Zdivision, which evolved into the Sandia National Laboratories. Zacharias andhis associates established an effective atomic beam research laboratory.” ]Yes, I knew a general out there and Ernest Colvin, who was a chemical engineer.DID YOU WORK WITH THE Z DIVISION?I discussed the extraterrestrial spacecraft.WHICH ONE?The one at Air Force 5 in southern Nevada that had the humanoids come out and lay downon the ground.THE SANDIA BASE Z DIVISION KNEW ABOUT AIR FORCE 5?I think they knew more about it than just about anyone else.AT&T WAS INVOLVED WITH THE Z DIVISION, WASN'T IT?Ye s , it w a s .DID YOU EVER KNOW ANYONE AT AT&T WHO KNEW ABOUT THESPACECRAFT AT AIR FORCE 5?No, I didn't talk with AT&T about the spacecraft, but I knew they were involved."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"HAVE YOU EVR HEARD THE PHRASE, ‘Manhattan Engineering District Joint Chiefsof Staff Integrated Command?’Ye s .WHAT DID THAT MEAN TO YOU?The Manhattan Project was the atom bomb. And they worked with Los Alamos and theWhite Sands Project in a combined effort. I sat in on some of their meetings out at OakRidge, Tennessee.DID THEY EVER TALK TO YOU ABOUT YOUR NEEDING A MAJIC CLEARANCEOR A MAJESTIC-12 CLEARANCE?Well, I had a top clearance - a red shield with the red, white and blue on the bottom. Icould go anywhere. I could walk into the President's office in the White House with thatthing on.DID IT HAVE YOUR NAME ON IT?Yes, it had my name on it and you could not duplicate it because it was stamped into themetal.DID YOU KNOW ABOUT ‘MAJIC’?Yes, MAJIC was supposed to be a group - I might be saying something here I'm notsupposed to so I won't.

Perhaps we need someoutside, universal threat to make us recognize this common bond. Ioccasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if wewere facing an alien threat from outside this world.
