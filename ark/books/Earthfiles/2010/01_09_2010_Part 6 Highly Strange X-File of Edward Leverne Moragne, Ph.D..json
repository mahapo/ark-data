Moragne, Ph.D., Physicist Return to Part 1January 9, 2010 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Continuation of Linda Moulton Howe'sMay 8, 1997, interview with Edward Leverne Moragne, Ph.D., at his Houston, Texas,home: Howe May 8, 1997, Interview with Edward Leverne Moragne, Ph.D.: “IUNDERSTAND THAT YOU THINK AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCECROSSED YOUR PATH IN THE FORM OF A HUMAN-LOOKING MAN WHO SPENTSOME TIME TALKING TO YOU ABOUT ANOTHER WORLD IN WHICH THECIVILIZATION LIVES INSIDE THE PLANET?Yes, he called himself Scotty Moore, looked sort of like a regular guy, but told me thehuman body was being used as camouflage. He talked to me about a lot of things. ThatE.T. told me we humans don't really understand death - that we (soul/spirit) keep going,going, going.CHANGING FORM AT THE MOMENT OF DEATH?That's right, into another energy form.DID HE SAY ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT DEATH HERE?He said you can't take matter stuff with you and when you get to where you're going next,you're not going to want Earth stuff anyway.DID YOU EVER WORK ON ANY SDI PROJECT UNDER PHYSICIST EDWARDTELLER?No, I worked on it on my own.DO YOU KNOW IF ANY U. S. ASTRONAUTS SAW DISCS OR UFO CRAFT ON THEMOON?I know astronauts have seen UFOs, but they don't want to talk about that because peoplewill say they are kooks.WHAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED TO YOU?Huge circular craft, but they aren't going to talk about it.WHY IS THE UFO/E.T. TRUTH SO SUPPRESSED. WHY SHOULDN'T EVERYONEKNOW ABOUT IT?All you do is get up a hot steam in Washington when you try to discuss it.BUT WHY?I don't know, but it's been that way ever since I was first connected with it from that bigcraft and those bodies on the ground in Nevada.DOESN'T THE WHOLE HUMAN FAMILY DESERVE A PUBLIC PRESENTATION OFA BEING FROM ANOTHER PART OF THE UNIVERSE THAT HAD TECHNOLOGYTO REACH EARTH?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Well, that's good, but at the same time, even if that being told you about everything hishome planet, no one here would know more than when he started.BECAUSE?For instance, I can tell you things that you never dreamed of or heard of. For example,about two-thirds of the light scale is black. In that black area, you've got several milliontypes of light.IN THAT BLACK REGION, WHAT RESEARCH DID YOU DO?We wanted to see what the energy of that light would be, but I can't talk about thatresearch.YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE WORLD'S ASTROPHYSICISTS, BIOLOGISTS,MEDICAL DOCTORS AND OTHER PROFESSIONS WOULD BE SO CURIOUSABOUT ALL THE UFO AND E.T. REPORTS OVER THE DECADES THAT THEYWOULD WANT TO ORGANIZE A CROSS-DISCIPLINE RESEARCH PROJECT NOMATTER IF THERE ARE GOVERNMENT POLICIES OF DENIAL. SCIENCE ISSUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT FACTS AND TRUTH, NOT POLITICALMISINFORMATION.Well, the authorities back on those humanoids that laid down - some people wanted to cutthem open, even in suspended animation, and others didn't.WHO SAID NOT TO CUT THE HUMANOIDS OPEN?It was a Lt. General who said, ‘There won't be any cutting on these people at all!’Thedoctor had asked to make a very small cut to see what the humanoid blood looked like.The General said,‘Make that cut damn small!’ And before the doctor had sewed his small cut up, it hadalready healed up. You couldn't even see a scar!WERE YOU THERE WHEN THE CUT WAS MADE?No. I heard about it later.HOW LONG WAS IT AFTER YOU VISITED THE NEVADA DESERT THAT YOUWENT TO SEE THE CRAFT AT AIR FORCE 5?Several weeks before authorities called me again and told me they had the big disc overthere at the time, I think they had the humanoid bodies there, too, because I was told thebodies kept moving positions. When authorities had laid the humanoids out at the hospitalstation, each body was identified some way. Well, the bodies kept changing position.WERE THERE GUARDS WATCHING THE HUMANOIDS AROUND THE CLOCK?Yes, they had guards on duty all the time there.WHERE ARE THOSE HUMANOIDS TODAY AND WHAT CONDITION ARE THEYIN?What I've heard is they are in the same condition when I first saw them back in 1964 - nodecay, no nothing. I guess the bodies are still laying there somewhere, maybe near the bigcraft, but I don't know. The assumption is that when their leader, whoever or whatever thatis, decides to get them - well, who knows? Maybe their leader has decided they don't wantthose humanoids anymore.WERE GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES WORRIED ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPENIF ANY DAMAGE OCCURRED TO THE HUMANOIDS?Our authorities did not want whoever made and owned the humanoids to come to Earthand find the bodies butchered or anything. We didn't want to offend space travelers! Ithink everyone thought back then that the leader of wherever the humanoids came fromwould come and take the bodies back. I don't know why that hasn't happened - at least notyet, as far as I know.” See: U. S.
