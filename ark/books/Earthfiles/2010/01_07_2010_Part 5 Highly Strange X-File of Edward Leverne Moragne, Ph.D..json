Holt, Aerospace Engineer Return to Part 1January 7, 2010 Albuquerque, New Mexico - My January 3, 2010, Earthfiles reportincluded a letter from Alan C. Holt, President of Holt Research and Development Co.(1983 - 1986) to President Ronald Reagan with a copy to Edward L. Moragne datedMarch 27, 1983. After my report was posted, I received an email from Alan Holt. He hasworked as an aerospace engineer since 1967, when he graduated from Iowa StateUniversity with a B. S. in physics, followed by an M. S. in physical sciences with anemphasis in astrophysics from the University of Houston's Clear Lake campus in 1969.Alan Craig Holt, now 64, grew up in Algona, Iowa, north of Des Moines and remembersreading all the science fiction books in the local library and being fascinated with space-related books and programs on television. “I grew up convinced that we could developsome transport capability based on manipulation of gravitational fields,” he told me. Thatconviction fueled his goal to work in aerospace and study propulsion systems.In 1983, using his own time and money, Alan Holt started Holt Research and DevelopmentCo. after many conversations with Edward Leverne Moragne about the Reaganadministration's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and Dr. Moragne's ideas about faster-than-light propulsion. In fact, Alan Holt remembers Dr. Moragne encouraged Alan to writethe letter to President Reagan for research money and contributed the last paragraph abouthow some seed money emerged for physicists J. Robert Oppenheimer, Albert Einstein andEdward Moragne during the Franklin Roosevelt administration.This week I contacted Alan Holt to discuss his recollections about the 1983 letter and hiscollaboration with Dr. Edward Leverne Moragne.Interview:Alan C. Holt, Aerospace Engineer, Houston, Texas: “I was definitely a supporter ofthe Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). I felt that it had a good opportunity to developtechnologies that could be very helpful to the U. S. space program. My letter was writtenin the context of that particular SDI effort because that’s where the money was going atthat point.WHAT WAS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH EDWARD LEVERNE MORAGNE ATTHAT TIME, WHO IS COPIED ON YOUR LETTER TO PRESIDENT RONALDREAGAN?I had a friend in Houston who knew of Dr. Moragne and thought, based on my researchinterests, that I should talk to him. So I contacted Dr. Moragne on a personal basis and metwith him. He had fascinating things to share and was interested in my research, so afriendship developed.THE LAST PARAGRAPH, WHICH I UNDERSTAND WAS WRITTEN BY DR.MORAGNE, STATES: ‘WE WOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU OF THE WAY INWHICH THE FIRST NUCLEAR PILE WAS FUNDED AFTER A VISIT BY DR.ROBERT OPPENHEIMER, DR. EDWARD L. MORAGNE, AND DR. ALBERTEINSTEIN – PRESIDENT FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT PROVIDED A $5,000 GRANT TOSTART THE PROJECT. $1 TO 2 MILLION WAS REQUESTED. THIS GRANT WASCONTINUALLY REFUNDED UNTIL THE PROJECT WAS OFF THE GROUND AND"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"WAS ABLE TO RECEIVE GREATER FUNDING SUPPORT.’DID YOU CONFIRM TO YOUR SATISFACTION THAT DR. EDWARD MORAGNEWORKED WITH ROBERT OPPENHEIMER AND ALBERT EINSTEIN THEN ANDLATER IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE MANHATTAN PROJECT AND THEDEVELOPMENT OF THE ATOMIC BOMB?I was personally convinced, but I did not do any independent checking regarding hisconnections. I saw some of the same information that you received.THE PATENT?[ See: U. S. Patents, Electromagnetic Separator Click on partial Page 3 to see entire patent withillustrations.]The patent. So I took a lot of that on faith base on our friendship. I did try to check on acouple of things in his past, but I think because of his past position, it was not reallypossible to get any feedback. I think he was clearly involved in a lot of sensitive researchover the years.I ASK BECAUSE BEYOND THE PATENT AND YOUR LETTER COPIED TO DR.MORAGNE, IF I SEARCH HIS NAME, OR VARIATIONS ON HIS NAME, I CAN’TFIND ANYTHING BUT THE PATENT.I don’t know.WHAT YEAR DID YOU MEET HIM?It had to be 1981 or 1982. I’m not sure which year.BY 1981, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS THAN 19 YEARS SINCE HIS DESCRIPTIONOF THE BIG CRAFT COMING DOWN IN THE NEVADA DESERT, THE HUMANOIDBODIES OUTSIDE ON THE GROUND AND BEING MOVED TO EDWARDS AFB.DID HE TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT INCIDENT?I don’t remember that description. He shared a lot of different things with me. It’s possiblehe could have mentioned that one, but I think not because I would have asked him moreabout all that. I did know he had interest in UFOs and advanced technologies, and wecould talk about a lot of things openly in that regard. But my focus was on the physicsresearch I was doing.DID HE EVER BRING UP NON-HUMAN EXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFTTECHNOLOGIES AND/OR ENTITIES?That’s something I don’t want to comment on.BECAUSE?There were a lot of things that Ed Moragne shared with me that I thought, if true, werevery sensitive. Almost all the conversations we had and the information he shared with meI considered it to be sensitive. None of it I could personally confirm, but nevertheless, Ifelt what he was sharing was privileged information and I treated it that way.SPECIFICALLY ABOUT EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES ANDTHEIR TECHNOLOGIES?The reason I was talking with him was about advanced technologies that had beendemonstrated by what I presumed to be extraterrestrial vehicles, but I really wanted toconcentrate on the physics research and experiments he had done.WHEN YOU COPIED YOUR LETTER TO PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN ONMARCH 27, 1983, YOU COPIED YOUR LETTER TO EDWARD LEVERNEMORAGNE. DID YOU COPY IT TO HIM BECAUSE HE HAD MADE PROPOSALSTO YOU ABOUT WHAT HE THOUGHT COULD BE DONE WITH ADVANCEDP ROP ULSION SYSTE MS?I think he was supporting the research that I was interested in pursuing. He had conductedpersonal research that was significant in its own right and he saw the potential value of thepath I was pursuing.ARE YOU REFERRING TO HIS STATEMENT WHEN I WAS INTERVIEWING HIMBACK IN 1997 WHEN HE SAID HE WANTED TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM THATWOULD BE 30 TO 60 TIMES THE SPEED OF LIGHT?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The field resonance system work I was pursuing was basically a system that would bypassspace and time and might effectively exceed the speed of light by at least Dr. Moragne'snumbers - to some degree near instantaneous transport.DO YOU MEAN USING FIELD RESONANCE EFFECTS TO ALTER ATOMICSTRUCTURE, WHICH IS WHAT DR. MORAGNE SAID TO ME HE WAS PLANNINGON DOING IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE 30 TO 60 TIMES THE SPEED OF LIGHT.He had different methods than mine that might achieve the same result.DID YOU EVER WORK WITH DR. MORAGNE DIRECTLY IN A LAB OR ON ANYSMALL PROTOTYPES?No. We were only at the discussion stage.WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TO READING MY INTERVIEW WITH DR.MORAGNE IN EARTHFILES?I was surprised and enjoyed reading your article and was glad you had a chance tointerview him before he died. I was very interested in the report about the UFO landingbecause I didn’t recall him sharing that with me.HAD HE SHARED ANY INFORMATION WITH YOU ABOUT ANY UFO LANDINGSAND NON-HUMAN BODIES IN THE CONTEXT THAT THERE ARE ADVANCEDEXTRATERRESTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES AND INTELLIGENCES?We had discussions on that subject and I think he would agree that was the case. But wewere really focused on the physics and how things worked - not only that extraterrestrialsexisted.DID YOU GET ANY REPLY FROM PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN’S WHITEHOUSE?I might have gotten either a form letter thanking me for my ideas. I don’t know if I have acopy because I don’t remember if I did receive any reply. It probably wouldn’t have beenhandled by a letter. At the time, there was a lot of research already going on in SDI(headaed by physicist Edward Teller) and I was probably one of thousands of people whohad ideas to pursue and contacted the White House. So, no reply is not surprising.BUT YOU THOUGHT THAT IF DR. MORAGNE HAD WORKED WITH DR.EINSTEIN AND DR. OPPENHEIMER DURING THE PERIOD OF THE MANHATTANPROJECT DEVELOPMENT (atomic bomb) IN LOS ALAMOS, NEW MEXICO, THATHIS NAME REFERENCED AND COPIED IN THE LETTER WOULD HAVE CAUGHTTHE ATTENTION OF PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE?I think the letter was Dr. Moragne’s idea because I would never have added that lastparagraph. So at the time, I think Dr. Moragne was encouraging me to send the letter. Ididn’t think it hurt for Dr. Moragne to be mentioned. But I really felt like the research hadvalue in its own merits to warrant consideration.IN THE LAST PARAGRAPH ABOUT THE $5,000 GRANT OF SEED MONEY, ISTHAT BASED ON A HISTORIC DOCUMENT?It’s just based on what Ed Moragne told me.HOW LONG AFTER MARCH 27, 1983, DID YOU CONTINUE YOUR WORKINGDIALOGUE WITH EDWARD LEVERNE MORAGNE, PH.D.?I continued talking with him until 1987 when I moved up to Washington, D. C. to work onthe space station program. I might have called him once or twice, but I was not ascomfortable talking on the phone then. When I returned back to Houston in 1994, Irenewed the friendship even though it was not as frequent as it was before.WHAT YEAR DID HE DIE?January 2000. HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?I got a call from a person who had come into Houston to meet with him. The day shearrived, he died. Dr. Moragne’s wife wanted to get in touch with me and didn’t know how,so the other person called me. [ Editor's Note: Dr. Moragne was born in 1915, so he wouldhave been 85-years-old at death. ]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"IN THE EARLY 1980s WHEN YOU WROTE THE LETTER, DID YOU HAVE THEIMPRESSION THAT DR. MORAGNE WAS STILL IN COMMUNICATION WITHPHYSICISTS SUCH AS EDWARD TELLER OR OTHERS WORKING ON SDI?He indicated that he was still tied in and assisting in research and development reviews ofdifferent possible technologies. Yes, I think he was still connected and communicating, butI don’t know with what group specifically.WHEN YOU WROTE THE LETTER TO PRES. RONALD REAGAN WITH A COPYTO EDWARD MORAGNE, PH.D., HAD YOU AND DR. MORAGNE COME TO ANAGREEMENT THAT IF YOU DID GET SEED MONEY THAT DR. MORAGNEWOULD DO SPECIFIC WORK?No. The whole thrust of the letter was to get the White House interested in thetechnologies and to consider them. Of course, it was my and Ed Moragne’s desire thatseed money be made available.DID DR. MORAGNE EVER SAY TO YOU, ‘ALAN, THIS IS WHAT I WOULD LIKETO DO AND THIS IS HOW I WOULD DO IT’?No. Most of the information, except for the last paragraph of the letter that he wrote (Ididn’t know anything about the historic seed funding), were my ideas supported bydiscussions with Dr. Moragne and knowing about the research he had done. So, I think hesupported the ideas, but he had not independently done any research on them either.EXCEPT THAT HE TOLD ME IN 1996 THAT HE WANTED TO BUILD APROPULSION SYSTEM THAT COULD GO 30 TO 60 TIMES THE SPEED OF LIGHT.Right. Certainly the one I was interested in getting developed would do that or better.THE LAST TIME YOU TALKED WITH DR.MORAGNE ABOUT PHYSICS WOULDHAVE BEEN WHAT YEAR?1999. We Are Not Alone in the UniverseFROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE IN A CAREER HAVING TO DO WITH ADVANCEDPROPULSION TECHNOLOGIES, WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT THE FUTUREHOLDS FOR A REVELATION THAT EARTH HUMANS ARE NOT ALONE IN THEUNIVERSE, THAT THERE ARE OTHER INTELLIGENCES THAT CAN PERHAPSBEND SPACE/TIME AND MOVE IN TIME LINES?I think that’s almost a certainty. I expect that fact to eventually be part of ourunderstanding of the universe and how it works.DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE REVEALED IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS?I don’t know. This might be something that happens in bits and pieces over a long time.Then some day, we wake up and the general discussion is that we knew all the time theywere there. That’s not so strange. Or something more dramatic will happen. Everypresident that comes into office you hear rumors that the E. T.s will be revealed, but itnever happens.WHY DO YOU THINK IT NEVER HAPPENS?I think it’s a very difficult subject. My personal opinion is that we’re not dealing with justvisitors from another star system. We’re dealing with visitors that can travel through typesof hyperspace. There might be beings that come from parallel realities and react with us inways that we are not aware of. So, it’s not just the fact that we’re being visited, but thefact that there is a whole, vast multi-verse that we are not familiar with and a lot of peoplewould have difficulty adjusting to.BUT YOU HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WE ARE NOT ALONE IN THIS UNIVERSE?I have no doubt.MEANING EXTRATERRESTRIALS?Other beings as well as physics of other dimensions, consciousness and hyperspace travel.I think the universe is much stranger than we can possibly imagine.”"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Continued in Part 6.Return to Part 1• 01/03/2010 — Part 4: Highly Strange X-File of Edward Leverne Moragne,Ph.D.• 12/31/2009 — Part 3: Highly Strange X-File of Edward Leverne Moragne,Ph.D.• 12/29/2009 — Part 2: Highly Strange X-File of Edward Leverne Moragne,Ph.D.• 12/28/2009 — Part 1: Highly Strange X-File of Edward Leverne Moragne,Ph.D.More Information:For further information about “Dr. Epigoni,” please see Earthfiles Archive:• 01/26/2005 — Final Part 28: UFO Crash/Retrievals: The Inner Sanctum - Status Report VI ©July 1991 by Leonard H.
