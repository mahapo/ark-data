Red circle in central Memphis is where Kathleen Deaton, 44, lives and saw a \"sperm-shaped\" aerial object in June 2005, stop and change altitude several times over backyard deck and house roof. The red circle in Bartlett is where Sandra Smith, 72, in October 2006, saw a \"plane\" stop three times in mid-air, jerk forward and then vanish. July 10, 2007 Memphis, Tennessee - On June 28, 2007, I received an email with the subject line, \"drones,\" from Kathleen Deaton, 44, who lives with her husband and children in central Memphis. Her email began: \"Back in 2005, I was sitting on my deck here in Memphis, Tennessee, in June. At about 3:30 PM, ...I turned around to see one of the most incredibly odd things I've ever seen. It looked like a big sperm cell - it was an opaque balloon of some sort with a tail which seemed to propel it. ...It was flying about 20 feet off the ground, coming between the trees and other houses, and was flying right over my backyard directly towards my deck and me.\" Kathleen had been following my news reports about the dragonfly-shaped \"drones\" at Earthfiles and wondered if the Memphis object could have been another variation on the drone structure. On Sunday, July 8, I called Kathleen to find out what happened in more detail and she agreed to an interview on the record with her full real name. Interview: Kathleen Deaton, Central Downtown Memphis, Tennessee: “ I was sitting out there on the backyard deck. It was a clear day and my dog was sitting at my feet. My dog all of a sudden started barking and got upset and I turned around to look (to see what was wrong) and coming up over my fence in my backyard - I live in an old part of Memphis with houses very close together, so from my back deck I can see the house behind me. Coming up over my fence is this thing. It’s moving pretty swiftly and it’s a balloon shape and for a minute, I thought it was a balloon that had gotten loose from somebody, just floating away and coming in the yard – until I realized its motion was steady. It was not accelerating. It was not deflating. Its motion was steady and it was coming straight to my deck. When it got to my deck, my little dog came over to sit by my foot and that thing adjusted its movement and got up higher. I’d say it was about 20 feet off the ground. When it got to the stairs of the deck, it stopped and then adjusted its movement upward to where it was like 20 feet off the deck. And then it comes up the deck and now it has to get over my roof, so it stops again. My house is made in a U-shape. It stops again and adjusts its height again to go up over my roof. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"When it did that, I hollered at it, ‘Hey!’ When I hollered at it ‘Hey!,’ it stopped. It’s sitting there and its tail is still moving a little. COULD YOU EXPLAIN THE SIZE, THE SHAPE, THE COLOR AND DETAILS ABOUT THE TAIL ATTACHED TO THE ‘BALLOON’? This is going to sound really strange, but it looked just like sperm you see in microscopic pictures. It was opaque. It looked like the material you make a surgical glove out of and it was a pretty big balloon. K athleen Deaton tried to graphically represent what she had seen, beginning with a comparison to the stylized medical graphic above of a sperm cell. As she did several sketches, she remembered the tail did not taper so much and the top of the \"balloon\" part was flattened on top (sketch below): \"The thing I saw had a tail that was more like a fish tail, or a guppy tail even. I’d guess the whole thing was about 7 to 9 feet in length. What was interesting to me at the time, and still is, is that it made no sound that I could hear.There was no mechanical whirring, nothing. That seemed to make it even more sinister. Even ki tes make a w hoosh and sl ight fl utteri ng sound – thi s thi ng w as movi ng, w i th no sound.\" K athleen Deaton: \"The tail seemed to have striations – but that may have been from stretched plastic, or it may have been shadows of wiring?\" The front part was 4 or 5 feet in diameter and the tail part was maybe another 4 to 5 feet (and it all looked like one construction. I couldn’t see a hinge and it tapered off in this tail thing and it looked for all the world in its motion like it was swimming through fluid as if the tail was propelling it. It was the weirdest-looking thing I’ve ever seen. When I hollered out ‘Hey!’ at it, it stopped and then for a minute, I got scared. I thought, ‘What am I doing?’ And my little dog is at my leg just trembling. I don’t know if it was sound-sensitive? Or if it had already stopped and was adjusting its height to get up over the roof. But after I hollered ‘Hey!’ and the thing stopped, it just hung there for a while. I didn’t move. I didn’t say another word. And then it went on up over the roof and I ran through the house and out the front door to watch it and it went across the street and up over houses and just kept on going. Now, we have a railroad track that runs through this part of town where they move military things all the time. We have a police department, which is not even a mile away from this house. I don’t know what it was. I don’t know if it had something to do with local police surveillance? Or had something to do with the military at the old Millington Naval Air Station north of me because they are moving jeeps and trucks and military stuff on these train tracks every day. I’m under the flight line for the base airport and there are C-130s coming in and out all the time over my house. And the thing went towards the train tracks, so I don’t know if it was surveillance for the neighborhood to see what was around? Or what was going on? But it was the strangest thing I’ve ever seen in my life. [ Editor's Note: Naval Support Activity (NAVSUPPACT) Mid-South is located in Millington, Tennessee, 21 miles north of downtown Memphis.

UNTIL YOU SAW THE DRAGONFLY-SHAPED DRONE PHOTOS? Yes, and when I saw those, I thought that’s what that thing was – some kind of drone. DID YOU CALL THE POLICE OR MILITARY OR ANY OTHER AUTHORITY TO REPORT WHAT YOU SAW AND TO ASK WHAT IT MIGHT BE? No, I think I figured it was something military. WHAT WE’RE ALL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS: ARE WE DEALING NOW WITH SOMETHING FROM OUTER SPACE? OR HAVE SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS IN OUR OWN GOVERNMENT BACK-ENGINEERED SOMETHING FROM OUTER SPACE RETRIEVED LONG AGO, WHICH ARE THESE DRONES NOW FLYING AROUND? BUT THEN, WHY WOULD THEY BE SO PUBLIC IF THE GOVERNMENT IS KEEPING IT ALL A SECRET? That’s an amazing question and I don’t have an answer on that! (laughs) The night you were talking about the drones on the radio, I went and looked at your Earthfiles website and thought, ‘My goodness, that explains what I saw.’ \"Organic\" Quality of Sperm-Shaped Object WHAT WAS YOUR GUT FEELING ABOUT THE THING WITH THE TAIL THAT WAS MAKING YOUR DOG COWER NEXT TO YOUR FOOT? At first, I was very curious about it. Then, when I hollered at it and got it to stop, I got real scared. I thought, ‘What am I doing?!’ Because I didn’t know what the thing was. It looked organic. That’s what was really spooky about it. It did not look like some kind of mechanism. It looked organic. And while it was opaque, I guess I could see through it (a little). There was light there, but I didn’t see anything moving (except the tail back and forth). I didn’t hear any noise from it. There wasn’t any kind of antenna off of it. It was real spooky – especially in the middle of the afternoon like that. Very spooky! DID YOU HAVE ANY HUMAN GUT FEELING ABOUT ITS INTENT? I didn’t like it. I wanted to get away from it and I ran in the house. Then before I ran out onto the porch, I made sure it was well out over the street before I went out to peek at it again. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU WANTED TO GET AWAY FROM? I have no idea. YOU’VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT SINCE? No. UNTIL THE DRONE PHOTOS? Right.\" "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Another Memphis Sighting of \"Airplane\" That Stopped Mid-Air On July 2, 2007, another Memphis resident named Sandra (last name withheld at her request) emailed me about a \"plane\" she saw in October 2006 stop, jerk forward, stop, jerk forward, stop, jerk forward three times in a clear blue sky over the Memphis suburb of Bartlett. \"Linda, I was fascinated by the accounts of the drones, and was jolted by the idea that an object might possibly be cloaked. I am a 72-year-old, fairly well-educated rational woman, and have never seen a UFO, but have always been interested in science and open to other possibilities than those demanded by mainstream scientists. \"I don't talk to my friends and family about things like this, but would like to share an experience I had about 10 months ago. Maybe you have a rational explanation for what I saw. I was driving home to north Memphis from a shopping expedition in Bartlett (east of Memphis), and was in a rare space in traffic where there was no one in front of me for about a quarter of a mile, and no one behind me for about the same distance, so I felt secure enough to glance up in the sky. \"The sky was one of that rare blue cloudless variety, and there was an airplane flying across in front of me. That is not unusual, as Memphis has an international airport, an air national guard unit, is the main hub for FED EX, and a Navy Bureau of Personal facility at the old Millington Navy Base. I could not see any insignia as it was too high, but looked to be an airliner in size. As I looked, the plane appeared to stop, jerk forward stop again. This happened three times, and then it simply vanished. I have never seen anything like it. I don't drink or take drugs. \"Sandra (last name withheld at her request)\" On Monday, July 9, 2007, I called Sharon to hear more details about the aerial object that seemed to mimic the shape of an airplane, but could repeatedly stop, jerk and start. Interview: Sandra, 72, retired elementary school teacher and housewife who has lived with her husband and children in Memphis, Tennessee, for fifty years: “In about October 2006, I had driven across the top part of Memphis to go shopping (in Bartlett). I live near the northern boundary of the city limits. As I was coming back from my shopping trip at about 3 PM in the afternoon, I was driving down a 4-lane road right through Bartlett, which is a suburb of Memphis. I was in one of those rare places where you have a half-mile ahead and behind you with no traffic. It was a clear day, blue. There was not a cloud in the sky. As I was not having to pay attention to traffic, I looked up in the sky and there was an airplane up there. It looked about the size of an airliner or a Fed Ex plane. We see them a lot because this is the central hub for Fed Ex. But there were no markings on the plane. It was just a solid grey plane. It was low enough that I could see it clearly, but there were no markings on it. I was just watching the plane and looking back at the road and as I was looking at it, it seemed to stop! And it jerked. And it stopped again. And it did that three times and it just vanished. There was no plane. And I have no idea what I saw. But when you began to talk about the drones on the radio, it didn’t look like the drones. There’s no way I have ever seen anything that looked like the drones, but the fact that it just sort of blinked out! RIGHT. AND I’VE NEVER HEARD OF AN AIRPLANE OR AIRLINER THAT CAN STOP IN MID-AIR, JERK, START AGAIN, STOP, AND DO THAT THREE TIMES. I have never seen one either. WHEN IT STOPPED AND THEN JERKED, DID THE JERK SEEM TO BE WHERE THE PLANE WAS GOING RIGHT OR LEFT INSTEAD OF STRAIGHT? Oh, no. It went straight ahead. It’s like if you wet your finger and put it down on a tabletop and you push it and then it would go again? It was that kind of motion. It would just sort of skid and stop, but it was all in a straight line. And then it was just gone! And it all"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"happened so quickly. SOMETHING THAT STRANGE, I THINK I MIGHT HAVE TRIED TO CALL THE AIRPORT OR POLICE OR SOMEONE JUST TO ASK ABOUT IT. (laughs) No, not me! I thought, ‘This is so strange, but who knows what they are doing now?’ IN TERMS OF MILITARY? In terms of military, that’s right. Or, who knows? We live in a strange time. I’m open to a lot of possibilities. I say this b ecause the only ghost I’ve ever seen was an airplane. (laughs) I’ve never been afraid of unidentified flying objects. But this technology – you just wonder if our government is doing something that we don’t know about? Or that we need to be afraid of? It’s a terrible thing. I never thought I would live to find myself afraid of my own government. THERE IS SOMETHING FLYING AROUND IN THE SKIES THAT A DOZEN WITNESSES HAVE SEEN IT STOP AND START WITH JERKY MOTION IN THE SKY, SILENT, SHAPED LIKE A DRAGONFLY IN ALL OF THE CASES EXCEPT YOURS. THE QUESTION IS: WHO MADE THESE? WHAT IS THEIR WORK, THEIR PURPOSE? DOES OUR GOVERNMENT HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER THEM? AND IF NOT, WHY ARE THEY SHOWING UP IN THIS PUBLIC WAY? The drone business – I wonder if it’s not surveillance? BY? By the government. They might have gotten so good at back-engineering that they have a little craft that can do these things. BUT WHAT IS THE PROPULSION SYSTEM THAT CAN STOP AND START? Yes, I could not believe it did that. I came home and I didn’t tell my daughter who lived with me. BECAUSE? My daughter is not so open minded about those kinds of things. UNTIL TONIGHT, JULY 9, 2007, TEN MONTHS AFTER OCTOBER 2006 – YOU HAVE NEVER TOLD ANYONE ABOUT THIS AERIAL CRAFT THAT STOPPED AND STARTED? No. As I said, my husband and children were not open to anything. I just don’t know anyone who is not interested in anything that is not straight up and down. SO YOU SAT ON THIS STORY UNTIL YOU SAW EARTHFILES AND IMAGES OF THE DRONES? Until I heard you. And particularly it was the interview with the security technician (in Montgomery, Alabama). He talked about it (drone) just vanishing. It was almost like it was cloaked. Like it was invisible and then something caused it to be able to be seen. RIGHT. THAT WAS IN MONTGOMERY, ALABAMA, NEAR MAXWELL AFB. Yes, and I thought, ‘You know, maybe that’s what I saw. Maybe I saw something that was supposed to look like an airplane and then it wasn’t.” I f viewers have more information about the dragonfly-drone phenomenon, please email me at earthfiles@earthfiles.com More Information: For further information about the dragonfly-shaped \"drones,\" please see Earthfiles reports below indexed under Environment: • 06/29/2007 — Another \"Drone\" This Week Near Maxwell AFB • 06/26/2007 — Part 2: Documentation, Palo Alto Caret Laboratory Q4-86 Research Report • 06/26/2007 — Part 1: Explanation of the Recent \"Strange Craft\" Sightings • 06/22/2007 — Dragonfly \"Drone\" Seen October 1995 in Arizona • 06/18/2007 — Writing In Chad \"Drone\" Image - A Link to NASA Clementine 1 Moon Mission? • 06/17/2007 — More Big Basin, California, Bizarre \"Drone\" Images"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"• 06/15/2007 — Part 1: Northridge, California, Aerial \"Drone\" Eyewitness On the Record • 06/15/2007 — Part 2 - Star Wars Physicist Edward Teller, Outer Space Menace And Remotely Piloted Ve hi c l e s ( RPVs ) • 06/08/2007 — More Drone Photos and Other Eyewitnesses • 06/08/2007 — More Drone Photos and Other Eyewitnesses • 05/30/2007 — Birmingham-Type \"Drone\" Seen At Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, in Mid-1980s • 05/28/2007 — Letters About Unidentified \"Drone\" Aerial Objects • 05/25/2007 — Two More Eyewitnesses of Aerial \"Drones\" in 2005 and 2006 • 05/21/2007 — Updated: Odd Aerial \"Drone\"?
