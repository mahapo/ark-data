Photograph by BJ Wolf. Dan Burisch, Ph.D., microbiologist, says he was recruited by American intelligence agents when he was a very gifted science student in high school in the early 1980s. He was born on February 2, 1964, and is now 40 years old. Dan Burisch, Ph.D., microbiologist, in September 2002, during whistle blowing interview with BJ Wolf and Bill Hamilton in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Dr. Burisch began leaking information in the fall of 2002 to California computer software programmer, UFO researcher and Executive Director of Skywatch International, Bill Hamilton. Dr. Burisch told Bill he had conducted biomedical work on an alleged extraterrestrial at Area 51, beginning in 1986.

Dr. Dan Burisch has seen himself as a whistle blower who wants to be free of government control on his life and work and would like to tell the public the truth about extraterrestrials as he understands it. He himself is not certain what his fate "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"will be after speaking out, except his biochemistry knowledge and abilities are considered to be a major help to the U. S. government's efforts to understand the alien agenda. But as of March 17, 2004, Dr. Burisch has announced to Bill Hamilton that he has su cceeded in making an agreement with his superiors to retire. Laboratories Underground the Papoose Mountains, S-4, Area 51, Groom Lake, Nellis AFB, Nevada Dr. Burisch said that several dozen times, he was asked to put on an astronaut-style spacesuit. He was taken underground at the Papoose Mountain S-4/Area 51 lab facility into a round room filled with cold hydrogen atmosphere that was referred to as the \"clean sphere.\" His assignment was to enter the clean sphere and approach an entity that his Majestic-12 superiors described as \"extraterrestrial.\" The being was called \"J-Rod.\" The name \"J-Rod\" came from the being who told Dr. Burisch it stands for the number 15 as depicted in Egyptian hieroglyphs. \"J-Rod\" in human shirt, drawn by Bill Uhouse, Engineer, based on his firsthand experience at Area 51, Nellis AFB. Dan Burisch was told there was a serious medical problem with the J-Rod and MJ-12 wanted Dr. Burisch to extract tissue from the being's arm for microscopic study. Dr. Burisch learned that J-Rod had a nerve degeneration disease that caused skeletal and muscle weakness and loss of body heat. \"J-Rod\" agitated during extraction of tissue from its arm at beginning of medical research in 1986 by microbiologist Dan Burisch under orders from Majestic-12 superiors.

Dan Burisch, Ph.D., Microbiologist, on tape for Bill Hamilton: \"My original feeling was that I was looking at a giant insect. That's the best I can do just off the cuff. It looked like a giant insect, being dark brown and hunched over in the corner, very insectoid in appearance. It almost looked like it had an exoskeleton. I felt afraid inside because I was always told that monsters weren't real. I felt scared, excitement, complete astonishment. Honestly, (before other knowledge), I thought we were dealing with some kind of monkey, something like an Old World ape. But it wasn't. But that's what my feeling was (scared). I'm not going to try to talk about how intellectual I was at the time. It scared the hell out of me! The Brookings Institution paper was present, as well as several position papers clarifying the Brookings Institute. However, each of these I was allowed into they had separate folders and separate clips within them within the 3-ring binders. I was told which numbers I was allowed to open up. They were given to me on a card and those were the ones I was allowed to review during the times I was allowed to review them. Most of the stuff ranged from military applications, physics of the craft I could not have cared less (about the technology). I was more interested in taking in the biology issues. (The craft technology) just doesn't interest me, aside from the fact that I am interested in the biophysical interface between the hand, mind and craft. The beings have on their hands a number of pads. There are open nerves which are protected by various glycoproteins and those glycoproteins are selectively pushed forward or sucked backwards via capillary action. Or they can be through an active fashion pulled back and it kind of pulls a viscous sheath back and allows the J-Rod to have direct interface with the craft. That interested me, although most of it at the time and still some of it now, I have no understanding of. A lot of it has to do with electronics and I don't pretend to understand. I was most interested in looking at issues involving their histo-pathology issues, including some autopsy photographs that showed disease processes which were naturally occurring within them. Isolations of viral material to include new protocols which were being written as they were being worked, which is what we are doing. That's what we are doing, writing new protocols as we are working forward. All of the old standbys are there: everything from electrofloresis to anything. But we are writing new protocols as we are going because this is not new territory. This is, pardon the pun, alien territory. HOW MANY BEINGS HAVE WE HAD TO WORK WITH? I only met one. I am aware of possibly three from the reading. And at the time, I was so stunned by what I was doing, a lot of it was getting by me. When I read the word 'extraterrestrial,\" I tunnel-visioned. When I finally believed and understood that it was in fact an extraterrestrial (I was) numb, numb! THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION AND THE NATURE OF IT. WHAT IS IT ACTUALLY LIKE WHEN YOU COMMUNICATE WITH ONE OF THESE BEINGS TELEPATHICALLY? I could hear my voice and it was like you hear yourself think. I could hear my voice (inside my head). However, the cadence, the affect, was something that distinguished it (as something) other than me. It was no great booming voice from the heavens or anything like that. And I'm glad I do not have a proclivity to hear voice in my head, and I have heard none since! (laughs) I could tell it was somebody other than me and I could tell because I felt drawn towards the subject (entity) that was sending the communication. When the J-Rod spoke with me prior to the bombardment of images, it was something that was part of me, but not part of me. I actually felt non-resident for a moment (out of my body) for a moment. It was almost an OBE (out of body) type feeling and then I could feel myself pull back and experience the sound (inside my head). It was physical! It was more real than touching an object. That's the only real time that I ever felt something more physical than physical. WAS THERE ANY CONVEYANCE OF EMOTION? 100% emotion. If he was upset, I could feel his pain. It got to the point where as I was doing the needle introductions, I could feel what he was feeling. So as I would inject the needle under the integument (arm muscle) and find my proper location prior to removing the sample, I could feel the needle entering him. So, I could feel his feelings.\" According to Dr. Burisch, J-Rod's nerve disease is a serious problem, not only for the entity at Area 51, but is a serious medical problem for the being's entire civilization. This brings us"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"to the \"real reason\" Dr. Burisch says that ETs are here to harvest genetic material from our Earth life in order to keep his kind alive in the present and the future. Time travel is supposed to be a key to the J-Rod survival. Further, Dr. Burisch says Majestic-12 in the United States has made agreements with the ETs to provide medical treatment and allow genetic harvesting from plants, animals and humans in return for advanced technologies that the United States has been trying to back-engineer since at least the late 1940s. Harvesting Genetic Material from Earth in Order for ETs to Survive: Similar Agenda Described in December 1980 RAF Bentwaters Rendlesham Forest Incident Main gate of RAF Bentwaters, morning of December 28, 1980, showing \"Alert Condition\" on sign. Photograph © 1980 by Larry Warren. Dr. Dan Burisch's information sounds very much like U. S. Air Force Staff Sergeant Jim Penniston's description from the December 1980 RAF Bentwaters UFO incidents in England that went on for three nights, beginning after midnight on December 26, 1980, and continuing through to the night of December 28, 1980. Sgt. Penniston said he understood that what set down in the Rendlesham Forest were time travelers from the future who were desperate to repair a serious medical problem and considered genetic material from Earth life to be their \"band-aids\" for survival.

If the biochemist and the military man are correct, is that why tissue and fluids have been removed from animals, plants and humans around the world for at least six decades? This might also explain the Corona, New Mexico rancher's comment to me about the \"horrible secret\" in the Roswell UFO crashes which emerges in some of the alleged U.S. government documents leaked to Bob and Ryan Wood in their Majestic Documents project. See website link at bottom of this report. Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit Summary, Classified TOP SECRET ULTRA"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The IPU Intelligence Assessment was dated September 4, 1960, by the authority of Lt. General John A. Samford, Director, National Security Agency, and approved by Allen Dulles, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and stamped TOP SECRET MAJIC ULTRA. This is one of the documents leaked to Bob and Ryan Wood in their accumulation of files on Majestic-12. Bodies Dissected As You Would A Frog On Page 6 of the document, five alien bodies are described as they were found with a crashed aerial vehicle at a site on the northern end of the White Sands Missile Range in July 1947. The site is called LZ-2 in the report, which means, \"Landing Zone 2.\" Landing Zone 1 is defined as the notorious crash site between Corona and Roswell. A third Landing Zone 3 is defined as 30 miles east of Alamagordo. All three crashes occurred between July 2 to July 6, 1947, according to the MJ-12 report. Paragraph 12 of the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit Summary Intelligence Assessment states: \"The most disturbing aspect of this investigation was that there were other bodies found not far from Landing Zone 1 between Corona and Roswell that looked as if they had been disected (sic, should be dissected) as you would a frog. It is not known if Army field surgeons had performed exploratory surgery on these bodies. Animal parts were reportedly discovered inside the craft at Landing Zone 2 in the northern part of the White Sands Missile Range , but this cannot be confirmed.\" Dissected humanoid bodies and animal parts inside one of the craft must have scared President Truman and his colleagues so badly that they all agreed that a tight lid had to be placed on UFOs a policy of complete denial in the interest of national security while they tried to learn more and figure out what they were up against. Thus, emerged the National Security Act of 1947 that created the Central Intelligence Agency, the Majestic-12 Special Studies Group and presidential executive orders that required everyone associated with the extraterrestrial investigation to lie and misinform the press and the public in order to prevent panic and to maintain national security. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Majestic-12 First Annual Report , 1952 On top of the dissected humanoids and animal parts, there was another disturbing event that would also have provoked the Truman Administration's decision to keep all the real facts about UFOs and what was in them from the press and public. In the year 1952, Truman's appointed Majestic-12 Special Studies Group issued its first annual report as \"A Review of the President's Special Panel to Investigate the Capture of Unidentified Planform Space Vehicles by U. S. Armed Forces and Agencies.\" Biological Warfare and Insidious Retro-Viruses On Page 5 of the TOP SECRET MJ-12 report under a paragraph entitled \"Biological Warfare Programs,\" it states: \"Biological Warfare programs in the U.S. and U. K. are in field test states. Discovery of new virus and bacteria agents so lethal that serums derived by genetic research can launch medical science into unheard of fields of biology. The samples extracted from bodies found in New Mexico have yielded new strains of a retro-virus not totally understood, but give promise of the ultimate biological warfare weapon. The danger lies in the spread of airborne and bloodborne outbreaks of disease in large populations with no medical cures available. Retro-viruses were not even a common medical concept in 1947. Examples of retroviruses are HIV, leukemia and the deadly ebola virus that causes its victims to hemorrhage blood from every orifice. Retro-viruses are composed only of RNA which can provoke healthy DNA to incorporate the insidious RNA instructions into the genome of the cells which then destroy. Four Medical Technicians Died from Contamination At Roswell UFO Crash Sites On Page 9 of the TOP SECRET MJ-12 report it states:"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"8. \"The Panel was concerned over the contamination of several SED personnel upon coming in contact with debris near the power plant of the craft security. One technician was overcome and collapsed when he attempted the removal of a body. Another medical technician went into a coma only four hours after placing a body in a rubber body-bag. All four men were rushed to Los Alamos for observation. All four later died of seizures and profuse bleeding. All four were wearing protective suits when they came in contact with body fluids from the occupants. 9. Autopsies on the four dead SED technicians are not conclusive. It is believed that the four may have suffered from some form of toxin or a highly contagious disease. Tissue samples are currently being kept at Fort Detrick, Maryland. 10. The Panel was also concerned with the detection of air-borne release of radiation over the state of New Mexico. AFTAC detachment from McClellan AFB has conducted several airborne monitor flights over crash Site L-2 at white Sands. Radiation readings indicate a high neutron count was recorded as the plane flew over the site. Neutron count dropped off as the plane flew a considerable distance from the site. A report has been filed with the USAIDS. Finally, Paragraph 13 concluded, \"In the opinion of the senior Atomic Energy Commission medical officer, current medical equipment and supplies are wholly inadequate in dealing with a large scale outbreak of the alien virus.\" Website: http://www.majesticdocuments.com Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
