Since then, more kills have extended to sheep and goats and now the State Dog Warden and Pennsylvania Game Commission are trying to find out what's responsible for the attacks. Their main suspect is a dog. The first office to receive attack reports was the Penn Township Police, in Manheim. Police Chief Larry Snavely described what has happened so far. Interview: Larry Snavely, Police Chief, Penn Township Police, Manheim, Pennsylvania: \"We've had 20 chickens killed. Not sure of exact cause of death. We did have a sheep and two goats killed along with those. And some others injured. And seven rabbits at different locations. What are the marks from the attacks? The initial attacks were around the neck area. One of the sheep had its vertebrae broken. So, it was a snap on that one's neck. I think the goat also was caught at the neck. It also had the back end ripped up some what. One rabbit was eaten and partially the goat. When did this start in reports to you? First reports came in January 1. The first animal killed was some time between December 31 and January 1. What animal was killed first? Probably the first report we received was five rabbits. But I actually think the Italian duck was killed before the rabbits. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"What happened to the rabbits? They were torn apart and eaten. What kind of tracks have you found? Large, round type tracks. Related to any particular kind of predator? We would anticipate its dog prints. The State Game Commissioner has been down and compared them to a replica or coyote and wolf tracks and they don't match up to them. How many animals in total have been attacked? Seven rabbits, one black Italian duck, one goat was attacked and killed but there was another one attacked and injured. Then there was a sheep that was attacked that was injured and not killed. All in the Manheim area? Ye s . Has there been a case like this before of an attack on a range of domestic animals by something with a large, round footprint? No. What is your best guess? We're pretty well confident from what we've seen is that it's more than likely a domesticated dog that has either turned wild and has had to take to blood or just a wild dog that was dumped out, possibly. Has any one seen any unusual animal around Manheim? We're getting sightings now and that's what we're chasing down. Prior to, no. What are people reporting now? Any dog that's out now and not penned is getting reported. But nothing unusual? No. Where there have been bites in the neck, anything unusual about the bite or tear marks? Not that I've been told and I haven't been out at the scenes. Not from what they've brought back, no. Has anyone in your office taken photos? I don't know that we have here. I know the State Game Commission and PA State Dog Law Officer have photographed the animals that were killed, the deceased animals. And we had photos of dogs we've been looking at as suspects. Is it true there was a gate that had a six-inch crawl space underneath that had claw marks which suggested whatever attacked one of the goats or sheep went under the gate? It went under the gate. I'm not sure of the distance. It would have been"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"somewhere around there. Looking at the photos that I saw, I would have guessed (the space) a little more than that. What kind of animal could get under the 6-inch gate space and still attack and break the neck of a sheep or goat? Not confirmed that it definitely had to go under the gate. There was some other footprints that indicated it could have leaped over the fence. We're not really sure how it gained entrance to that yard. How big was the gate it leaped over? The gate was higher than the rest of the fence. I don't know the height of the fence. Was the gated area entirely enclosed? Ye s . Which animals were attacked there? That was a sheep killed there and a goat. And the sheep were injured there.\" More Information: If you have any further information to report, please call the State Game Commission at 610-926-1966 or the State Dog Warden Investigator, Travis Hess, at 717-721-3072.
