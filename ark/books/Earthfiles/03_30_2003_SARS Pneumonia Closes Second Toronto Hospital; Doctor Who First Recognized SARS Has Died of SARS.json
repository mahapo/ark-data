We recognize this is an epidemic that is evolving.\" - 3/29/03 Julie Gerberding, M. D., Director, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia March 30, 2003 Toronto, Ontario, Canada - The severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, attacks the tiny alveoli lung sacs that get oxygen from the blood in normal healthy people. When alveoli are destroyed and eaten up, as SARS seems to do, people cannot get oxygen to breath and suffer acidosis, too much carbon dioxide in their blood. Until now, medical authorities have hoped this new and still unidentified disease was not contagious through the air. But in less than a week, Toronto health officials have closed a second hospital because the SARS pneumonia continues to spread despite quarantines, fueling growing concerns that in fact the new pathogen can spread through the air. Toronto's York Central Hospital has been closed to new patients and hundreds of its employees have been asked to quarantine themselves at home for the next ten days in an effort to contain the ongoing outbreak of SARS. Toronto's Scarborough Grace Hospital was also closed to new patients on March 26, and employees were asked to quarantine themselves at home. So far, SARS has infected 37 people in Canada and killed three. In addition to the hospital closings and quarantines, worried health officials announced Friday that international travelers flying from Toronto would be screened for SARS symptoms. Toronto is a large Asian immigrant city, but other affected places have been Vancouver, British Columbia and Winnipeg, Manitoba. Carlo Urbani, M. D., Dies of SARS Also yesterday, March 29, 2003, Dr. Carlo Urbani of the World Health Organization, who first recognized that a new and severe acute respiratory syndrome had recently emerged in Vietnam and China, died of the mystery illness. Dr. Urbani was an expert in communicable diseases and in early March treated an American businessman hospitalized in Hanoi who also died of SARS. The presumption is that Dr. Urbani contracted SARS from that patient. The current W.H.O. case count worldwide for SARS is 1,610 and 57 deaths. Hong Kong SARS Cases Increase; Some Patients Have Recuperated "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"People in Hong Kong are wearing face masks to help protect against the SARS pneumonia that might spread both by air and close contact. Photograph © 2003 by Associated Press. In Hong Kong, 60 new SARS cases have been reported as of March 30, plus another fatality. Many of the latest patients live in the same apartment complex. Medical experts still have not absolutely confirmed the identity of the SARS microbe and now wonder if the disease spreads through the air, as well as close contact from sneeze and cough droplets. SARS might be a new mutation of a Corona virus which causes the common cold, or a new Paramyxo viru s t h at causes measles and mumps - both of those virus families can spread through the air. W. H. O. is worried that the rapidly increasing case count in Hong Kong could \"start a chain reaction\" of newly infected people. One of the recent patients was aboard Dragonair Flight KA901 from Be ijing to Hong Kong on Wednesday, March 26, 2003. Hong Kong health officials are trying to find the other 222 passengers and 15 crew to see if they have also been infected. Passengers on the airplane should immediately contact W. H. O. or the CDC, and both websites with contact information are listed at the end of this report. Some good news: as SARS is reaching epidemic proportions in Hong Kong, nine doctors, nurses and medical students there who became ill with the pneumonia were discharged from hospitals yesterday confirming that with adequate medical care, SARS can be overcome. Antiviral and Other Drugs Not Working Against SARS At the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia yesterday, CDC Director, Julie Gerberding, M. D., told a news conference, \"The global epidemic continues to expand. We recognize this is an epidemic that is evolving.\" CDC also expanded its travel advisory to mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Vietnam, suggesting all such trips be postponed \"until further notice.\" Dr. Gerberding also emphasized that so far no drugs or treatments have been found to cure SARS. \"We have no evidence that any specific antiviral, steroid treatment or other agents that are targeting this virus have any benefit to patients.\" One help has been ventilators and an estimated 10% of the SARS patient population in Hong Kong and Vietnam have needed ventilator assistance to breathe. As of March 30, 2003 United States Suspected SARS pneumonia cases in the United States have climbed to 62 in 23 states.

Patients who have received good hospital support care, including ventilators, have survived. In fact, the mortality rate of the SARS pneumonia is running only about 3 to 5 %, but the potential severe lung damage in some of the cases demands expert medical treatment and x-rays.
