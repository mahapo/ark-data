But I think that’s going to be one of the great mysteries because if they traveled two miles on foot, they had to cross a large, busy road.” - S gt. Cathy Katzman, Charlotte County Animal Control E ight long-horn cattle, most born in 2004 or 2005, that ended up in a Port Charlotte, Florida, residential neighborhood early Tuesday morning, April 17, 2007, without explanation.

April 21, 2007 Port Charlotte, Florida - The Port Charlotte Sun-Herald reported on April 18, 2007, under the headline Cows! or The Bovine Invaders: \"There were eight, big-eyed and long-horned, voraciously eating lawns and carelessly trampling the gardens that lay in their path. ... Cindy Collins was one of those who called 911 when she saw the animals. Collins didn't think anyone would believer her. 'There's cows at my house! There's "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"cows with horns!' is what she told the 911 dispatcher.\" Cindy's 911 call was around 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday morning, April 17, 2007. Other neighbors were also calling the police which called Charlotte County Animal Control. By 9:30 a.m., Sergeant Cathy Katzman arrived on the scene and managed to get the eight long-horns together in one place while she waited for Florida \"cowboys\" to come and round up the mysteriously displaced animals into a truck for safe keeping at Animal Control until they could find the owner.

Cathy Katzman, Sergeant, Charlotte County Animal Control Office, Fire Department/Public Safety, Port Charlotte, Florida: “ Because they looked like long-horns, I contacted the only person I knew who might own these cows. He came out, took a look at them, told me they were not his cows. He tried to help me find out where the cattle might have come from and neither one of us could find the property. My department contacted some local cowboys that we knew and who had helped out on previous calls for other animals and they came out, rounded up the eight head of cattle and transported them to our impound area which is in Punta Gorda.

Corral Gate \"Taken Off Its Hinges\" On April 19, I was contacted by a gentleman who thought they might be his. He came to our office and identified the cows through photographs, described the animals to me and described their brands. The cattle are in fact his. He does not know how they escaped the confinement area that he had them in, but he did tell me that his gate had been taken off its hinges. But neither of us can figure out how the eight long-horn cattle ended up where they did. WHERE WERE THE CATTLE BEFORE THEY ENDED UP IN PORT CHARLOTTE? They were on a piece of property approximately two miles east, if you could draw a straight line, from where they were supposed to be off of a road called Loveland Blvd., which is here in Charlotte County. It’s one of the few areas here in Port Charlotte where you can have livestock."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"He’s a local man who lives in DeSoto County, which is the neighboring county. And he had the eight long-horn cattle on a piece of leased property in Charlotte County. When he contacted us, he said, ‘I believe you have my cows!’ (Owner's name withheld at Animal Control's request.) They’re all long-horns and fairly young. Two of them had their year brands on them. One was a 4, which tells me that she was born in 2004. The other was a 5, which tells me she was born in 2005. So the animals are somewhere between two and three years of age. \"4\" brand on one of female long-horns, indicating she was born in 2004. Image © 2007 by Sgt. Cathy Katzman, Charlotte County Animal Control. WHAT DID THE OWNER SAY ABOUT THE GATE LIFTED OFF ITS HINGES? He’s not sure if someone was doing vandalism or trying to steal the cattle. He’s not sure what was going on there. He is going to file an offense report with our Charlotte County Sheriff’s Department just in case there are any further problems out there at his leased property. DID HE SAY HE FOUND ANYTHING UNUSUAL AT THE GATE HINGES? No, he didn’t. He just told me that the gate had been removed. WAS THE GATE LYING ANYWHERE NEAR THE CORRAL? It was apparently lying off to the side. HAD HE EVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAPPEN BEFORE? Not that he stated to me, no. HAVE YOU EVER ENCOUNTERED ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE? I haven’t encountered it personally, but I have heard from various ranchers in our area where they are having problems with people going in and cutting their fences, usually to get to something on the other side to go 4-wheeling. They’ll go in by cutting the fence and the cows will get loose. But you usually find out when it’s too late after the cows are gone. With these eight long-horns, somebody might have been trying to pull a prank or somebody was trying to trespass on his property. It could have been that someone was trying to take the cows. This is speculation. I don’t really know. Home Corral Is 2 Miles East of Port Charlotte Neighborhood HOW DID THE CATTLE TRAVEL TWO MILES FROM THEIR ORIGINAL CORRAL INTO PORT CHARLOTTE? (laughs) That’s what I would like to know because they had to cross a very busy road. We didn’t get the first call (at 7:30 am) until after they wound up in the neighborhood. The road that they crossed, Kings Highway, is heavily traveled and it’s beyond me how anyone could have been going down that road and not seen eight cows, either trying to cross or standing on the side! (laughs) IT’S ALMOST AS IF THEY WERE PICKED UP BY SOMETHING IN THE AIR FROM WHERE THEY ORIGINATED AND THEN WERE PUT DOWN IN PORT CHARLOTTE FROM THE AIR? Yeah, you could say that. They just kind of appeared out of nowhere quite literally."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"WERE THE CATTLE ON TUESDAY MORNING AGITATED, NERVOUS OR DISORIENTED? They seemed a little nervous. They were in an environment they weren’t used to. There were neighbors coming out and possibly spooking them. But when there weren’t people around, they stayed very calm in the area where I had them until the cowboys could come out and round them up. SO, IT’S FAIR TO SAY THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED, YOU STILL HAVE A BIG MYSTERY ABOUT HOW THESE EIGHT LONG-HORNS GOT FROM THEIR ORIGINAL LOCATION 2 MILES TO THE EAST TO THE PORT CHARLOTTE NEIGHBORHOOD? Exactly. I would really like to know how they wound up there! But I think that’s going to be one of the great mysteries because if they traveled two miles on foot, they had to cross a large, busy road.” C harlotte County, Florida, Animal Control truck and two of the eight long-horn cattle that mysteriously turned up in a Port Charlotte neighborhood the early morning of April 17, 2007, two miles west of their home corral. Image © 2007 by Sgt. Cathy Katzman. More Information: In the book, The Dyfed Enigma, © 1979 by Randall Jones Pugh and F. W. Holiday, in Chapter 5 the authors report the mysterious and repeated transport in England of cows from one farmer's gated pasture to another farmer's pasture about a mile away - in the night. In the Ripperston-Broadmoore area at Ripperston Farm run by farmer Billie Coombes, \"...a herd of some 100 cattle had escaped during the night about half a dozen times. On these occasions the entire herd had apparently slipped silently past the house, gone down the lane, then turned down a side-road to end up at Broadmoore Farm, half a mile away. This meant that over an hour was wasted in bringing the animals back. Pugh asked Billie Coombes: 'How can you account to me that about 100 cattle - fully-grown beasts - get out of a bolted yard, without anyone opening the gate, and creep past the house without disturbing yourself or any member of the family or your dog, Blackie, and manage to travel half a mile to a neighbour's field?' 'It's the same as I said at the time, they must have flew there!' 'What was the state of the gate when you went over to the yard?' 'It was still locked! That's the funny part of it. It was still locked, but there were no cattle in it!'\" Another remarkable fact described by Billie Coombes to Randall Jones Pugh was, \"The cows can't cross any of the fields (on foot) because of electric fences.\" F or further information about mysterious animal disappearances and deaths, see my books An Alien Harvest , the 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities, and my documentary films in the Earthfiles Shop.
