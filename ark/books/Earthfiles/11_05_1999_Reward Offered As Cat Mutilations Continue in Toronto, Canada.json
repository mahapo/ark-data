Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Reward Offered As Cat Mutilations Continue in Toronto, Canada © 1999 by Linda Moulton Howe November 5, 1999 Toronto, Canada A $60,000 reward has been offered by the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals for information about ten mutilated cats since the current mystery began in August 1999. The reward offer has generated phone calls, but no suspects. The SPCA's lead inspector, Debbie Hunt, is now seeking help from the Toronto Police: \"We don't have the resources or enough experience in profiling criminals.\" Inspector Tony Warr, recent chief investigator in a Toronto bedroom rapist case, will head a new behavioral assessment unit. Their focus will be serial killers, and presumably an international ring of them since similar cat mutilations have been occurring in London, England, San Jose, California, Ft. Worth, Texas and Ontario, Canada at the same time in 1999. Over the past couple of decades, odd cat mutilations have also been investigated repeatedly in Plano, Texas; Tustin, California; Falls Church, Virginia and other U. S. and Canada regions. Half-cat photographed by Plano, Texas Police Officer for Incident Report # 91-44994, August 31, 1991. Hunt has photographs of the current Ontario mutilated cats, many of them precisely and bloodlessly cut in half. One is an orange and white cat, collar still attached. There is a wound above the cat's eye and some bruising around the neck where odd punctures in the throat have been found in some of the mutilated animals. The abdomen was severed in half with a \"razor-straight cut.\" Only the front half remained with all its organs intact. Debbie Hunt told reporters, \"It's like a bandsaw or a very sharp knife is doing this. Wild animals aren't. (Otherwise) the liver, the lungs and the organs would be strewn about.\" Further, the half cats are left near schoolyards or on well-lit street corners as if purposely laid out to be found. Ms. Hunt told me, \"We're talking to some pathologists about the nature of the cuts and have been sworn to secrecy on some things.\" In the past two weeks, the case number climbed from seven to ten as three more mutilated cats were found beyond North York, a Toronto suburb where the first animal was discovered on August 12th. Those three new cases included a cat body found in Mississauga, a community west of Toronto. Another was located in Parry Sound approximately 100 miles directly north of Toronto. Another recent mutilation was in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario at the western edge of the "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Ontario province. Four years ago almost to the day - August 15, 1995 - an earlier cycle of cat mutilations occurred in Toronto. There were no arrests. Across the continent in Vancouver, B. C. in May to June, 1992, several half cats were found without finding the culprit or culprits. Further back in 1978, authorities in St. Catharines near Toronto were also frustrated by more than one hundred missing cats and dogs and others found skinned and badly mutilated. In each of these mutilation cycles, many of the animals have been found cut in half bloodlessly, usually with the front half of the cat placed to be found. These facts have convinced many investigators that the animals are taken some place, killed and cut, and then returned to yards and sidewalks near their owner's homes. Nick Thomas, Director of Communications for the Ontario SPCA, talked to me about the current status of their investigation. Interview: Nick Thomas, Director of Communications, Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, New Market, Ontario, Canada: \"So far, autopsies have only been carried out on four of the cats that have been mutilated. WERE THEY ALL IN THE NORTH YORK AREA OF TORONTO? That is correct. WHAT WERE THE GENERAL FINDINGS? The general findings were that human intervention played a part in the mutilation of the cats. DID THEY EXAMINE THE EXCISION ITSELF FOR ANY SIGNS OF HIGH HEAT FROM SOME SORT OF CAUTERY-CUTTING DEVICE? It is my understanding that some type of a cutting device has been used, but I don't know if heat evidence has been confirmed. The police have developed a profile of what these individual or individuals may be like and that profile leads them to believe that some of these mutilations have been carried out with a special instrument, a special type of scalpel, which they believe could lead them to the individuals carrying out these cat mutilations. SO IT SUGGESTS THERE MAY BE SOME SORT OF EXTRAORDINARY SHAPE POSSIBLY ABOUT THE INSTRUMENT THAT HAS MADE THE CUTS, WORKING BACKWARDS FROM THE EXCISIONS? Right, that would be appropriate speculation. But I don't know. WERE ALL OF THESE FOUR CATS EXAMINED BY A VETERINARIAN AND DID YOU HAVE ONLY THE FRONT HALF OF THE CATS? In some instances, it was the head that was found and the autopsies performed on that portion of the body. SO HAVE THERE BEEN DECAPITATIONS AS OPPOSED TO CUT IN HALF? In the first instances in North York, two cats were decapitated. I'M QUOTING HERE FROM THE TORONTO SUN , OCTOBER 21ST, AND THE QUOTE IS FROM (the SPCA's) DEBBIE HUNT: \"The cats are being cut in half and placed where people will find them.\" That is correct. And as Debby points out, it would appear that the cats were deliberately placed in the locations so that they would be found. DID THE VETERINARIAN REPORT ANYTHING ABOUT WHETHER ALL THE ORGANS IN THE UPPER PART OF THE CATS HAD BEEN REMOVED AS WELL?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I cannot comment on that. I don't know that. HAVE YOU ALL BEEN AWARE OF THE CAT MUTILATIONS GOING ON DURING THIS SAME PERIOD OF TIME IN SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA AND IN LONDON, ENGLAND? (See: Earthfiles.com October 3, 1999) Yes, we are. AND IN TALKING WITH INVESTIGATORS IN THOSE CITIES AND COMPARING, ARE YOU ESSENTIALLY DEALING WITH THE SAME PATTERN? We're being made aware of these things and we've tried to get some information on them, but we haven't been very successful in learning the details of it. And that's why we ourselves have been trying to put as much details as we can out about the instances in Toronto. YOU MEAN SPCAS IN OTHER AREAS WOULDN'T BE OPEN WITH YOU? Well, I think they encounter some of the same problems that we would encounter in terms of the amount of information that we can make available in the public domain in terms of how it might impact a subsequent investigation and any court case. The laws here in Canada are much more restrictive in this area. But at the same time, we have been made aware of the situations in London, particularly, and we have contacted the Royal SPCA to get any information they can make available to us. IN TERMS OF INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN COMPARED BETWEEN ENGLAND AND CALIFORNIA AND TORONTO, WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY IT IS THE SAME TYPE OF HALF CATS AND DECAPITATED CATS ALL DONE IN THE SAME BLOODLESS FASHION ? I would say absolutely yes. Everything indicates there is a great similarity in all three instances here, which is covering a lot of geography at the same time.\" More Information: Anyone with information is asked to call Inspector Debbie Hunt at the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) at (416) 410-4836.
