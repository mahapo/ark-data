Further, one investigator now says that the cut from Mr. Kent's neck to the base of his stomach was \"very crudely done.\" Authorities still do not know whether to classify the mutilated man's body as a homicide or abuse of a corpse after death. Another development is a possible connection between a slash wound on Mr. Kent's neck and a stab wound in the neck of murdered and homeless 64-year-old Alva Figueroa discovered January 28 only four blocks from where Willie Kent's mutilated body was found on February 28, 2003. March 3, 2003 - Update - The 60-year-old mutilation victim has now been identified as Willie Kent. A spokesman for the Philadelphia Medical Examiner's Office, Jeff Moran, will not yet answer questions about the autopsy and said it could take six to eight weeks to complete the examination. March 2, 2003 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - On Friday, February 28, 2003, a man's body was found in an abandoned North Philadelphia rowhouse. Ira Porter of The Philadelphia Inquirer reported, \"The body was found face down about 2:30 p.m. inside the first-floor back room of a trash-filled rowhouse on the 1500 block of North Eighth Street, according to police. Police responding to the scene at first believed that the death might have been due to natural causes, but an on-site inspection by the Medical Examiner's Office revealed that was not the case. ... The man's body had been neatly sliced from the bottom of his neck to the base of his stomach.\" The organs that were neatly removed were his heart, liver and one of his lungs. So far, neither the police nor the coroner are certain if the man died at the scene or had been mutilated elsewhere and then dumped in the rowhouse. Over the weekend, the Philadelphia Medical Examiner's Office \"tentatively identified the man's identity\" pending notification of his family. The man is described as black, 5-foot-7 and between 30 to 40 years old. He was wearing blue jeans, a fatigue jacket and a sweatshirt. Police said a rope was found around his neck and his face was frozen. Time of death, the police speculate, was around Thursday or Wednesday, one or two days before the body was found by a Philadelphia resident looking for metal scrap. Since the 1500 block of North Eighth Street in downtown Philadelphia is notorious for drug addicts, Homicide Capt. Charles Bloom said, \"We thought this was a drug overdose or a homeless person. It was not until they lifted the body up that they saw he was missing some organs.\" The Philadelphia Police Department's Homicide Division has given out a phone number to call if anyone has information: 215-686-3334.
