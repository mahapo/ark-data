Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. \"THE 'WRIGHT' STUFF - A PRELIMINARY REPORT David Dobbs of Cincinnati, Ohio, is a long-time friend and associate in UFO research who is a faithful member of MUFON Amateur Radio Net. The following anecdote or preliminary report, received from Dave on July 8, 1991, is of special interest because it relates to an alleged pre-Roswell crash and retrieval. David Dobbs: 'Tex Martin, to the best of his recollection, was six years old (which would be in 1946) when he went through a guarded doorway at Wright Field. But the strange scene that met his eyes was burned into his memory forever. Not just once, but on several successive days, he saw the same strange object. As an adult, he discussed the incident only with his wife and over forty years would pass before he understood the significance of what he had seen. On the evening of September 19, 1990, while he was watching the Unsolved Mysteries program which described a UFO crash/retrieval, Tex suddenly realized what he had observed in that hangar. Tex is an amateur radio operator. When he accidentally tuned into the MUFON Amateur Radio Net on March 23, 1991, he learned that someone local might have a serious interest in his information. He subsequently contacted the author, who had been acting as net control operator by phone. The narrative which follows is what he related. School had closed the week preceding Tex's sixth birthday on June 10, 1946. As a present, and a reward for having done well in class, he was allowed to accompany his father, Jack Martin, to work. Jack installed aircraft instruments at Wright Field (later to become Wright-Patterson Air Force Base). He worked out of a shanty on the field, but changed clothes and ate with other men in a hangar area furnished with picnic tables. A washroom and lockers were located down the aisle of the L-shaped room. Unusual activity was evident when Tex and his father arrived at the hangar that Monday morning. Military vehicles were parked in front of the hangar doors and 'Army men' were present. Tex emphasizes that these vehicles and soldiers were seen only on that first day. Inside the hangar,, large panel doors could be closed sideways to separate the canteen area from the main part of the hangar. These were just sliding shut as Tex entered the canteen, but not before he caught sight of several low-boy trucks inside with tarpaulin-covered loads. Tex remembers savoring the first Eskimo Pie he had ever eaten and taking the wrapper to a trash can which stood beside a pop machine. Tex eyed the bottles of pop with longing because they included his favorite - chocolate soda. A janitor was stationed nearby guarding a walk-through door in the sliding panels. Noticing Tex's interest in the pop, he offered to treat him. Tex went to ask permission from his father and then came back to accept the drink. While standing there, he was able to look through the small door which had been left open. Inside the main hangar, soldiers were working and quite a crowd was gathering. Several small bodies (Tex thought three or four) lay on stretchers in front of a large, dome-shaped object supported on tripodal legs. Blankets were scattered about on the floor and soldiers were folding up a "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"large tarpaulin. He remembers that the bodies were small, brownish in color, and had large, pear-shaped heads. He estimates that the domed object in the background was 18-20 feet in diameter. It was off-white in color, had no sharp points, and was encircled by a flat band. Tex told his father about the object which he saw when he looked through the doorway. It was probably Thursday morning when a Colonel noticed Tex looking through the door and ordered Tex's father to take him home. A week or two later, Jack Martin lost his job. He told Tex and his mother that he had seen stuff he wasn't supposed to see. Tex remembers his father crying in the kitchen and the difficulty he had finding other work. Tex overheard his grandfather, who also worked at Wright Field, telling his parents that a portion of a space vehicle had been brought in. Tex has a good memory of the topography of the field at that time, with a runway going up a hill where gliders were launched. This ran east and west between buildings towards a water tower. According to his father, there was an underground facility in the hill containing top-secret stuff. Only people with the highest clearances could get in. The investigator's preliminary conclusions are that Tex Martin appears to be a stable, honest individual without the reason or background to fabricate such a story. It appears likely that hypnotic regression could verify the dates and circumstances involved and elucidate a wealth of detailed information. 'OVER THERE' Some time in 1964, 'somewhere at sea,' between the Caribbean and the Atlantic, a specially rigged LST flagship (aka 'spy ship') for a naval amphibious force received a coded radio message in its 'crypto-machine' room, which reported that 'artifacts' had been retrieved with three dead personnel. According to my informant, former Third Class Petty Officer, S. M. Brannigan (pseudonym), a specialist trained to translate intercepted Russian transmissions, the decoded report stated that a UFO had crashed in two parts: the main section near Penkridge in Staffordshire, England; and the remains in West Germany. He further stated that the retrievals of the parts and the occupants were conducted by Air Force Intelligence and shipped to Wright-Patterson AFB, adding that U. S. and other NATO interceptors were involved. Brannigan admitted there was more to the incident which involved coded information that he preferred to keep confidential. The Brannigan disclosure, while sketchy, might spotlight only the tip of the iceberg as to the scope of military crash/retrieval operations in foreign lands. Researchers know that reports of crashes are worldwide from pole to pole on every continent in many countries - even in remote Madagascar. If such incidents are to be secreted, it is my suspicion that U. S. special retrieval teams have been, and still are, prepared to 'go into action' into any crash location within its sphere of military or economic influence such as was exercised with NATO in the 'artifact' retrievals in England and We st Ge rma ny. Similar actions surely would have been mandated in the USSR, affecting the Warsaw Pact nations and those within their 'sphere,' reaching as far as Cuba. During the Cold War years, we had only rumors and 'leaked out' information from that vast domain. Then, suddenly and unpredictably, came news of a collapsed 'empire,' and glasnost which allowed its citizens and UFO researchers more freedom and access to the West. They now share their concerns about their own UFO incursion and reports of landings, abductions, encounters during space flights, power outages and even an 'official' admission of a recent intercept mission over Moscow. And yes, there were crashes and recoveries. But, like the U. S., there is still no official admission. Secrecy still prevails. One Russian correspondent, writing from Denmark, told me in his letter of May 28, 1991, that he believes that his incoming and outgoing mail is monitored by the KGB. He also noted, 'Not far from Moscow in the town of Mitishi, there is a military center where all UFO information is gathered...' COLD WAR UFOS OVER USSR Sensitive information about UFO activity worldwide is occasionally made available"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"to me from reliable sources. Because it usually involves highly classified military situations, most firsthand sources request that it not be published. Others cautiously allow portions of their disclosure to be released, but on their terms and insist on anonymity. Some of this kind of material I prefer not to use in my status reports because it is too brief and too vague to be meaningful. There are exceptions, of course, to name one where it concerns the Soviet Union during the Cold War era when news about UFOs was scarce. During this fragile period of vigilance for a sudden missile attack, sophisticated United States satellites tried to keep track of any and all aerial traffic in Earth's envelope of space. One incident stands out, occurring in October 1981, when a cluster of UFOs was detected heading from space toward Moscow. The results of the incursion are unknown, but unfortunately, a former Air Force Airman, Simone Mendez, assigned to high-security telecommunications with the 2069th Communications Squadron at Nellis AFB, became involuntarily implicated with another airman in her section of work, who gave her a copy of the NORAD message. As a result, Simone got into serious trouble. I was in touch with Simone by phone and mail shortly after the distressing incident, but chose to make only a brief reference to it in Status Report III in deference to her sensitive position and security issues. I have since met Simone twice at MUFON meetings. In October 1990 during the MUFON Missouri Conference, I attended a private session when she was regressed hypnotically by psychotherapist, John Carpenter, in an attempt to clarify the wording of the NORAD message. For Simone, it was a stressful ordeal to face possible charges of espionage and, to me, she still showed depressive concern about the event that happened nine years before. Simone's story about the affair is a long and sad one indeed, but now it is in the open. She revealed her whole story to Barry Greenwood, which appears in two parts starting in the June 1991 issue of Just Cause . Recommended reading! Another sensitive case, involving the Soviet Union, also involved U. S. intelligence capabilities when U. S. agents in 1972 witnessed a UFO landing incident during military maneuvers in East Germany. The incident is documented, a copy of which got into the hands of a trusted person in the ministry. A brief description of the incident was sent to me from a 1988 report by the ministry official as follows: Soviet Ministry Official: 'East German and Soviet armies were conducting war games in East Germany. Suddenly, a large, round, purplish sphere descended upon them; hovering a few feet off the ground in the center of the field of activity - bringing both armies to a standstill. Sphere continued hovering there for several minutes and then shrank to a point of light before disappearing. The incident remains Top Secret due to the fact that it had been viewed by U. S. government agents secretly observing the army activities. This report was filed in the records of Congress on June 24, 1972; case number to be withheld to protect the identity of the officer. Case number is known. Note: Officer reported that he was warned never to reveal the facts of this report, whether he remained in the military or reverted to civilian life.' 'EMISSARY' DR. MARINA POPOVICH: A NEW EAST-WEST CONNECTION In Russia, Dr. Marina Popovich is a living legend. Called 'Gosposa Mig' (Lady Mig), she was her country's most famous woman test pilot with two records in stratospheric flight and experience with three different types of the Soviet fighter plane, Mig and Antonov-Maschines. Honored as a 'hero of the Soviet Union,' her rank in the air force is colonel. After leaving active duty, she studied Technical Science, achieved a doctorate in engineering and joined the Academy of Sciences All-Union Investigation Committee for Anomalous Aerial Phenomena. Her former husband is Air Force General Pavel Popovich, cosmonaut, and former head of the Academy's UFO Commission, and today, head of the Soviet All-Union Center (Soyusufotsentr) with headquarters in the building of the Technical and Engineering Association in Moscow. The credentials of Dr. Marina Popovich, expressed in the foregoing introduction by my German colleague, Michael Hesemann, would certainly put her in an ideal position to act as a messenger, or emissary, to share her country's concerns about"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"UFO affairs. Since glasnost , she has traveled extensively beyond her homeland to lecture with translator, which included an international conference in Tucson, Arizona, May 8, 1991. Through the cooperation of Hesemann, also in Tucson, I was privileged to conduct a two-hour taped interview by phone with Dr. Popovich, during which time I asked about UFO crash/retrievals in the USSR. Her response was forthright, not hedging on naming locations, but she admitted that her disclosures were not official. Hesemann covers some of her revelations in his Fax message to me, May 28, 1991, as follows: Michael Hesemann: 'In June 1990, UFO experts from nine countries met in Munich, Germany, to attend the 2nd International UFO Conference in the Congress Hall of the German Museum. It was the second event of that size in Germany; the first one took place in October 1989, in Frankfurt, with 35 speakers and representatives of 29 countries and 1800 participants. One highlight of the Munich conference was the participation of Col. Dr. Marina Popovich, head of the Soviet delegation with four representatives of Soviet UFO research, including two members of the Academy of Science. Marina Lavrentrevna Vasliyevna Popovich, born July 20, 1931. Linda Howe Editor's Note: Marina Popovich learned to fly and was commissioned into the Soviet Air Force. By the time she met her husband, Pavel Popovich in 1955, she was a Major, a test pilot and held thirteen aviation world records. She retired as a Colonel in the Soviet Air Force and spoke publically in international conferences about UFO phenomena, especially the unexplained disappearance of the Soviet Phobos 2 space probe that arrived in Mars orbit in January 1989. One of the goals for the spacecraft was to fly close to the Martian moon, Phobos, and explore it with equipment from two instrument packages that would be launched to the moon's surface. But on March 28, 1989, after the Soviet spacecraft had aligned itself with Phobos, the Tass news agency reported that: \"Phobos 2 had failed to communicate with Earth, as scheduled, after completing an operation yesterday around the Martin moon Phobos. Scientists at mission control have been unable to establish radio contact.\" During the alignment, Phobos 2 transmitted an image of a long, thin shadow that seemed between the spacecraft and the planet Mars. March 28, 1989, image from Soviet spacecraft, Phobos 2, as it was aligning itself with the Martian moon, Phobos. A Soviet mission goal was to explore the moon's surface with equipment. Image allegedly smuggled to public by Marina Popovich. The next day on March 29, 1989, one of the last transmissions from Phobos 2 showed an image of a gigantic cylindrical object approximately 20 kilometers long and 1.5 kilometers wide seemingly near the moon, Phobos. After that last frame was radio-transmitted back to Earth, the probe mysteriously disappeared. Marina Popovich allegedly smuggled out for public release that frame and another controversial one of a cigar-shaped shadow between the Phobos 2 spacecraft and Mars. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"March 29, 1989, alleged \"last frame\" taken by Soviet's Phobos 2 spacecraft of Phobos before it suddenly and mysteriously disappeared. Long, thin object unidentified. Image allegedly smuggled to public by Marina Popovich. Michael Hesemann: 'In her lecture, Marina mentioned over 3,000 reports of UFO sightings by Soviet military and civilian pilots. The latest UFO sighting over a highway near Moscow on March 21, 1990, was officially confirmed by the Soviet Chief of Air Command, Major General Igor Maltsev in an interview, published in the Union's paper, Rabotschaya Tribuna (Workers Tribune) on April 19, 1990, when the General informed the public that two Mig 23 interceptors were scrambled, but unable to intercept the strange disc-shaped object. It was 'a disc with a diameter from 100 to 200 meters,' the General said, 'capable of hovering and flying with a speed exceeding that of the most modern jet fighter by two or three times.' The object flew in heights between 3,000 and 21,000 feet. It seemed it was completely devoid of inertia. In other words, they had somehow 'come to terms' with gravity. At the present time, terrestrial machines could hardly have any such capabilities.' Marina Popovich also wrote in her book UFO-Glasnost (published Fall 1991, Germany), 'The Soviet Air Force and the KGB have fragments of five crashed UFOs in its possession. They analyzed the material and came to the conclusion that it indeed was not manufactured on Earth with terrestrial technology.' The crash sites she named were Tunguska, Novosibirsk, Tallin/Estonia, Ordzhonikidze/Kaukasus and Dal' negorsk. The latest UFO crash in the USSR happened on January 29, 1986. Shortly before 8:00 p.m., dozens of witnesses in the city of Dal' negorsk in eastern Siberia near Vladivostok observed a ball-shaped object, flying parallel to the ground before crashing with an angle of 60-70 degrees in the 611 meters high 'Hill 611' or 'Izvestkovaya Mountain' in the center of the city. The reddish glowing object had a speed of 45 feet/second before it crashed. According to the eyewitnesses, it jumped up and down for some time before it finally crashed into the mountain, exploded soundlessly and burned for nearly an hour. On February 3, 1986, an expedition of the Far East Department of the Investigation Committee for Anomalous Aerial Phenomena of the Academy of Science led by Dr. Valery Dvuzhiln y arrived in Dal' negorsk, starting the investigation. The scientists discovered many fragments, including lead and iron-balls, bits of glass, traces of high temperature activity, magnetic anomalies, damage to nearby trees and the most mysterious discovery - a fine mesh of netting woven out of inert metal threads out of an alloy of gold, silver, nickel, alpha- titanium, molybdenum and beryllium. One of the scientists who analyzed the material, V. Vysotky, Doctor of Chemistry at Vladivostok University, came to the conclusion in his man-paged investigation report that, 'This fine metallic webbing is undoubtedly a high-technology product and not a thing of natural or terrestrial origin.' He supposed the object in question was an automatic scout probe of alien origin. Some of the threads, Dr. Vysotky pronounced, were only 17 microns thick and even woven with even finer material - impossible for terrestrial technology (of the time). An earlier crash happened on March 6, 1983, when military air surveillance located a low-flying object maneuvering in the Kaukasus Mountains near the city of Ordzhonikidze. A ground-stationed rocket was fired, hit the object,"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"damaged but did not destroy it. Reeling, it continued its flight, losing height, and disappearing from the radar screen. Two months later in May 1983, two mushroom pickers roamed through the Stolovaia mountains near Ordzhonikidze (Kabardino-Balkarskaia-Region), discovered it: An object 24 feet in diameter and of the same height. The upper half made out of crystal-like glass; the lower one out of metal with a four-part telescopic landing gear and two extended ramps. On its bottom side, it has six big, heavy jets and four groups of four smaller jets in cross formation at the sides of the tent-like, crystal-like dome. On one side was a strange symbol: a crescent on its back with four rays meeting in its center. The couple got their cheap, simple camera and took some pictures. Hesitating, the man climbed on the ramp, looked inside of a giant sliding door. Under the dome, he found a big pilot's seat that was double the size of a normal one, made for a giant of 3-4 meters. The couple went to town, gave the film to a local photo shop. The news about the strange discovery spread and the local military learned about it. They went to the site, sealed the area off. It took two days to bring military transporters to the remote mountain plateau. The object was transported first to a local military base and then to a military underground facility near Mytishi, southeast of Moscow. According to Valery Uvarov, member of the Soviet UFO Commission, the investigation of the strange machine led to the discovery of two propulsion: an antigravity-propulsion for the flight and a jet-propulsion for finer maneuvering in a mountain area. Obviously, the craft crash-landed, its pilot left it. Its board-mechanisms functioned good enough to set down, drive out the landing gear and the ramps. The propulsion was identified as 'neutrino beams' by the Soviet scientists, dangerous for humans who are exposed to it for longer than one hour. Indeed, the mushroom-picker and his wife died in 1988 from cancer. According to Uvarov, members of the original retrieval team suffered from the same disease. Indeed, the strange object of which I have four pictures in my possession, does not look like a high tech device from outer space, but more like a test vehicle of a lunar landing module. Uvarov says he believes the Americans discovered a similar device and imitated it for the construction of the famous 'Eagle' lunar landing module used for the Apollo moon program. Indeed, the craft looks too solid to be a hoax and one photograph shows the mushroom picker on one of the ramps, giving the impression of the real size of the object. It was discussed that it might have been a Soviet test vehicle, but this possibility was ruled out by the Soviet Space Agency and the Academy of Science. The second possibility discussed was that the object was constructed for a Polish science fiction movie. Up to now - 8 years later - no movie appeared with this strange object in it. In Ordzhonikidze, nobody remembers a film crew trying to reach the remote region of Stolovania mountains. The case remains a mystery.'\" Continued in Part 17 - Inside the Soviet Sanctum Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
