Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon A New 1999 Book About Crop Circles © 1999 by Linda Moulton Howe \"The Nature of God is a circle of which the centre is everywhere and the circumference is nowhere.\" Empedocles of Agrigentum, 490 B.C. October 29, 1999 Petersfield, Hampshire Lucy Pringle has studied crop formations in England over the past decade and is a founder member of the Centre for Crop Circle Studies, a member of the British Society of Dowsers and Chairman of the Unexplained Phenomena Research Society (UNEX). She is also currently coordinating research into effects of electromagnetic fields on living matter. In her new book, Crop Circles, The Greatest Mystery of Modern Times © Lucy Pringle 1999, she gives an historic context for crop circles in England that long precede the 1990s. Like other authors over the years, she includes an illustration of a 1687 woodcut which depicts the now-famous \"Mowing Devil\" making a flattened circle in a field of oats. Mrs. Pringle also quotes from several British eyewitnesses who remember playing in circles in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s: \"One Sussex woman remembers playing in corn (cereal crop) formations during the war and told Mrs. Pringle, \"I can remember them with absolute clarity 50 years ago when I was a small child and my friends and I spent hours playing in them. There were two fields in particular where they occurred regularly over three or four years. There were two or three circles in the fields and they were all swirled round flat and had well-defined edges. There was an interconnecting pathway between the circles which was not straight but curved. It was only one or two inches wide with the stems splayed sideways.\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Lucy Pringle writes about the physical and emotional effects of crop circles on humans and animals. Those effects include a pressure or tingling on neck, shoulders and head that many people have reported over the years. Some people have reported healings of arthritis and other health problems while others complain about headaches, nausea, dizziness and emotional reactions of fear and/or anger. Many feel uplifted and joyous. Occasionally dogs have refused to go in some formations, porcupines have been found dead in the centers of some in Canada, and Mrs. Pringle reports that in the summer of 1993, the remains of feathers and bird tissue were found \"exploded\" in a crop formation near Wanborough. \"We entered the ringed formation and there were the remains ...numerous small feathers strewn over a radius of 13 to 14 feet from the centre of the circle. From the way the blood and feathers were present in every layer of the crop, right down to the ground, it was apparent hat the birds had been caught up in the actual creation of the formation, blown apart and disintegrated by the force. \"What sort of force can explode a bird? Some form of microwave activity must be present and this could be responsible, and indeed the charring effect evidenced by the porcupine in (one) report would go some way to confirming this. \"This idea of electromagnetic/microwave energy can also help explain the strange effects crop circles have on mechanical equipment.\" Lucy Pringle asks, \"How long will the shapes continue to adorn our fields? Have they got a message for us, or is it romantic, fanciful thinking? ...For the full answer, I believe we may have to look to areas of wider consciousness that can bypass normal thought. Einstein tells us, 'There comes a time when the mind reaches a higher plane of knowledge, but can never prove how it got there.' I believe we cannot dismiss the possibility of some external intelligence being involved in this phenomenon.\" More Information: Lucy Pringle's new book has 135 pages plus Bibliography and Index with black and white and color photographs throughout.
