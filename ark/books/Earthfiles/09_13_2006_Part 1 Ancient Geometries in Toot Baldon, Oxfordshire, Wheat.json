September 11, 2006 Santa Clara, California - Northwest of Oxford, Oxfordshire, England, is a farm region that includes March Baldon, Toot Baldon, Big Baldon, Little Baldon and Baldon on the Green. The entire region's population is less than 500 people. Toot Baldon is located at the top of a hill and the name \"Toot\" means lookout. St Lawrence's Church at Toot Baldon dates back at least to the 12th century and has wide views of the Thame valley to the Chiltern hills. On July 30, 2006, Mark Fussel and Stuart Dike at Cropcircleconnector.com received an alert about a formation in a Toot Baldon wheat field. The first people to check it out and report back were Ellis Taylor, Geoff Ambler and Ross Holcomb. Ross wrote: \"Toot Baldon, Oxfordshire, Wheat, Two intersecting 400-foot circles with 60-foot-wide seed of life in centre of Vesica Piscis. It is two five-foot-wide intersecting rings measuring approximately 400 feet around (132 feet in diameter). There is a circle centered in the resulting Vesica Piscis which measures about 60 feet across. Within the centre of the circle is a 6-petaled \"seed of life\" formation. The southernmost ring is laid in a counterclockwise direction. Interestingly though, the northern most ring is split down the middle by a thin line of standing crop with the inner half of the ring flowing clockwise and the outer half o the ring flowing counterclockwise. \"Within the centre, there is a narrow ring of laid crop forming a circle around the seed of life petals. There is no nest to speak of in the centre, but one small nest in the laid sect ion of the crop between petals which points nearly due north from the centre of the formation. It feel very fresh and fluffy still, although I feel that it has been in the field for a few days (at least 2 to 4).\" On Thursday, August 3, 2006, I joined a caravan going toward Garsington to see the new formation. Along with us was Jennifer Kreitzer, a veteran photographer and event planner in the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. Jennifer would be the only person in the caravan to get photographs inside the Toot Baldon formation of a Flower of Life inside a Vesica Piscis. Flower of Life Symbol"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"F lower of Life geometry made by pattern of overlapping circles. The Flower of Life symbol is considered to be sacred among many cultures around the world, both ancient and modern. Within this symbol can be found all the building blocks of the universe that we call the Platonic Solids. The symbol can be used as a metaphor to illustrate the connectedness of all life and spirit within the universe. Vesica Piscis The Vesica Piscis is an ancient symbol known in the early Mesopotamia, African and Asian civilizations. The geometry is made from two circles of the same radius, intersecting in such a way that the center of each circle lies on the circumference of the other. The name Vesica Piscis in Latin means \"fish bladder.\" In the Christian tradition, the Vesica Piscis is also equated to Christ, the fisherman. It is called a mandorla (almond) in India. Interview: Jennifer Kreitzer, Event Planner, Woods Institute for the Environment, Stanford University, and Owner, CaliDigital, Videography and Website Design, Santa Clara, California: \"I have been interested in crop circles since I first heard about them, but never had a chance to go to England to see them. My friend, Barbara Lamb, invited me to go with her this year and I took her up on the opportunity. [ Barbara Lamb is co-author with Judith Moore of Crop Circles Revealed: Language of the Light Symbols © 2001.] Barbara Lamb was in the habit of calling the Silent Circle Cafe every day to find out new formations so we could go visit them. There was a rumor that something was going on at Garsington. So, we got in the car and drove for two hours to get there. Then, it took a long time to find the wheat field and the formation. But finally we did and there were three cars in a caravan and about ten of us trying to park on the narrow country road. SINCE I WAS THERE AS WELL, WHAT HAPPENED FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW ? For some reason, I was really excited to get into that formation. Andy Buckley (crop circle investigator from Manchester) jumped over the fence and headed down the tramline and I was right behind him. We were moving really fast because we had to go all the way down to the end of the field and back up the tramlines in order to get into the formation without stepping on any wheat. Andy was probably fifty feet ahead of me. As I approached the formation, there were little satellite circles on the side (\"signature\"). So, I started taking pictures of those."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"A ndy Buckley in background at main Vesica Piscis formation beyond the foreground \"signature\" at Toot Baldon, near Garsington, Oxfordshire, reported July 30, 2006.

Then I moved into the actual formation where there was a ring going around it and there was a thin line of wheat standing up, going right down the middle of that ring. Beautiful! WHAT WOULD YOU ESTIMATE THE WIDTH OF THAT RING WAS? The width was probably about five feet. The lay of the wheat was just gorgeous. O nly one of the two rings making the Vesica Piscis at Toot Baldon had a thin row of standing wheat right in the middle of the ring.

HOW FAR DID YOU GET INTO THE MAIN FORMATION? I took pictures of the ring and was walking towards the center and got a picture of the Flower of Life petals in the middle. F lower of Life petals defined as standing wheat inside Vesica Piscis rings. Image © 2006 by Jennifer Kreitzer. That is when someone started calling out to Andy. We turned around and the farmer was actually screaming at us to come back (out of the field). THE FARMER WAS TROMPING THROUGH HIS OWN WHEAT, KNOCKING IT DOWN AND NOT GOING ON THE TRAMLINES LIKE WE HAD ALL GONE WITH RESPECT FOR HIS CROP . BUT THE FARMER, SCREAMING AT US TO GET OUT OF HIS FIELD, WAS KNOCKING DOWN HIS OWN WHEAT. Yes, he seemed livid. He was really, really angry. And it seemed like there was some sort of police car in the road. I saw a car that had lights on top. And I thought, ‘Oh, no. He’s called the police.’ The first thing I did was keep taking as many pictures as I could before we had to leave. As soon as I felt like I could not stay there any longer without making him even more angry, we both (Andy Buckley and I) started back down the tramline again. THE REST OF US HAD BEEN CAUGHT IN THE TRAMLINE LEADING UP INTO THE FORMATION AND I THINK IT’S ONE OF THE MORE FRUSTRATING MOMENTS IN MY LIFE TO BE SO CLOSE TO WHAT SEEMED TO BE AN EXQUISITE PATTERN THAT WE COULD NOT GO INTO BECAUSE THE FARMER WAS SCREAMING AT US TO GET OUT. Yes, that was really disappointing. I could not believe it. I thought, ‘Oh, no, I’m going to get arrested.’ By the time we had gone down the tramlines and back up where the farmer was, others in our caravan - who had not even made it over the fence yet – were talking to the farmer and calming him down enough to where we could talk to him without his screaming at us. We asked him if we could go back because we were researching. But he told us that the people who do this are ‘just drunk blokes from the pub.’ THAT’S RIGHT. WE TRIED TO TELL HIM WE WERE NOT DRUNK BLOKES FROM THE PUB. Exactly. We are researchers. But he didn’t really care. I think he thought we were a bit off ourselves to even want to go into crop formations."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"YES, HE WAS THE FARMER WITH THE ATTITUDE THAT CROP FORMATIONS WERE BEING DONE BY PRANKSTERS AND THE THING THAT ALWAYS GETS ME IS THAT IF HE HAD TAKEN THE TIME AND HAD THE PATIENCE TO SIMPLY WALK IN HIS OWN FIELD TO LOOK AT THAT PATTERN AND NOT GO WITH ANGER, BUT TO GO WITH CURIOSITY, THEN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN AMAZED. Oh, yes!
