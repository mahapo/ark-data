There's more to everything than anybody knows. More dimensions, things co-existing. There are other dimensions ... more than three dimensions. Everywhere, it all works together. Everything co-exists. There's different dimensions we can't go into.\" - U FO abductee, Boulder, Colorado October 22, 2005 Boulder, Colorado - Since I began investigating the worldwide animal mutilation phenomenon back in September 1979, I have interviewed many people who have described a glowing beam technology that can lift animals from and back to pastures. The animals are returned dead and mutilated. I have also interviewed many people in the human abduction syndrome who also describe a glowing beam technology that can lift them individually or in groups. One case involved a husband and wife I will call Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, who were lifted while seated inside their car from a highway north of Boulder, Colorado, the week before Thanksgiving 1980. I researched this case with social scientist and long-time UFO investigator, Richard Sigismund. As our investigation evolved over a year through separate hypnosis sessions with the husband and wife, we were \"seeing\" through the couples' eyes different non-human beings. One was dressed in a blue cape and another wore an odd multi-layered collar. Those beings enraged Mrs. Thompson by subjecting her to a vaginal exam and confused Mr. Thompson when they \"took out and examined\" his memory. At the time around Thanksgiving 1980, the husband was a commercial artist and his wife took care of their young daughter. Mr. Thompson had previously worked as a USAF launch control officer at nuclear missile sites. Driving home late at night, a \"cerulean blue light\" surrounded their car and the couple lost about an hour of time. In the hypnosis sessions conducted by Richard Sigismund, Mrs. Thompson described how the couple could see a beam of light around their car. Then she could see through the light beam that the car was rising from the highway. Eventually, she could see a grove of trees below as the car was lowered in the light. Not far from where the car's \"landing site\" was a disk-shaped craft resting on angled struts that reminded the couple of an erector set. A hairless tall \"man\" in a blue robe and high collar beckoned them toward him. The couple felt overwhelmingly drawn to the being. Once inside the craft, the couple was separated. Each had different examinations. The woman did not know she was about a month pregnant at the time with a son who would be born prematurely six months later, but would be advanced physically and mentally after a seven month gestation. Several hypnosis sessions were done separately over a year, first with Mr. Thompson and later with his wife. During two of them, Mr. Thompson agreed to try drawing the beings and craft while in the altered hypnosis state. The following are excerpts from those hypnosis sessions.

Boulder, Colorado 1983 - 1984 Hypnosis Sessions by Richard Sigismund Subjects: Mr. and Mrs. Thompson (actual identity withheld at their request) Abduction Event: Mid-November 1980 abduction by beam technology from highway north of Boulder, Colorado. Wife: There's some silver things going over me ... like little creepy fingers. (Said with angry disgust.) Sigismund: Can you see the silver things? Or feel them? Wife: I just want it to get its creepy hand off me. (Said with increasingly disgusted anger.) Sigismund: What's it doing? Wife: Touching my breasts. Sigismund: Tell me about it. Talk about it. What do you feel? Wife: I can't decide if it's inspecting me ... or (Very heavy breathing, agitated.) 'Look, buster, down here we ask first!' (She said this loudly and angrily.) I can't see any faces. I just feel it's creepy. Sigismund: How did you get the mark on your stomach? (Referring to a rectangular red patch she discovered \"sun burned\" on her lower abdomen after the abduction.) Wife: Something they put up (me) when they were examining me. (Vaginal insertion.) ...They had some things up me and some things on me. Sigismund: Who are they? Wife: I don't see them. I can't hear noises. I just get an impression of being exceedingly angry at people invading my body without my permission. You know, I mean there was something more like I felt that I was invited here (to disk) and now this is what you're doing - you didn't even ask! The country where I come from you ask first! (Under hypnosis, she laughs angrily.) Sigismund: You had the distinct impression they invited you? Wife: Yeah, he (the guy in blue) ... I almost felt tricked - that I felt angry at being tricked or something."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" U nder deep hypnosis, the husband used charcoal and pastels to draw the craft he and his wife had entered, the being who beckoned them, and the creature who examined him. Like his wife, the man was drawn to the being in blue, but felt hostility toward the creature in a yellow robe with a multi-layered collar who did the examination. He called that entity a \"creep.\" During Mr. Thompson's examination, he smelled an odor he associated with missile sites. Then the being removed the husband's memory. At that point in the hypnosis, Mr. Thompson's voice became very soft and very slow. Husband: Somebody's talking, but ... it's like they're picking my mind ... like I don't have any control. My brain, it's like there's a tunnel that goes through my mind to theirs. My head is gone ... or going. Almost like a shaft through my head, something with my brain to his. I don't know if it goes to him, connects it somehow. Our minds are connected. It's like a tube, maybe it's light? It's like a grey light, grey-brown light, brownish-grey. It's like everything's pulled out of my head. Sigismund: Everything's pulled out of your head? Husband: Yeah ... it's like a waterfall and everything is gone. There's a terrible sound, but I can't tell what it is - only it's piercing, high-pitched. Sigismund: Can you tell where it's coming from? Husband: It's coming from my head! My head is gone ... it's like I can see all my thoughts, like goo. Everything in my mind is stripped. I've got it, but they've got it, too. Got the whole thing. They've just pulled everything right out of me! M r. Thompson stopped talking for several minutes. Sigismund tried to make him go forward in time, but he remained silent with his chin on his chest. Finally, he began to speak in a whisper saying his mind was being put back. He was startled and amazed that something had been added to his mind. Husband: There's more to it than anybody knows. There's more to life, more to the world. There's more to everything than anybody knows. More dimensions, things co-existing. There are other dimensions ... more than three dimensions. Everywhere, it all works together. Everything co-exists. There's different dimensions we can't go into. A fter separate hypnosis sessions with the couple, Sigismund brought them together to look at the drawings and discuss what they consciously remembered. Wife: I know I have extreme distrust feelings about them. And then my mind will start to sway, 'No, they didn't mean anything bad at all.' In fact, they tried to make me feel good. I had a dream a couple of nights after the hypnosis session when it was so vivid and I almost wondered - it was strange - I dreamed I had a confrontation with the guy in blue. He came to that room and I wanted to jump to my feet and scratch his face. And he kind of jerked back. And then I didn't. He perceived my anger and said, 'We didn't mean to hurt you' ... something like it was for a good purpose. And I said, 'Nobody asked me.' And something about the end doesn't necessarily justify the means. The entity said, 'Perhaps.' But he talked to me as if I were a child. M rs. Thompson felt violated and raped. Her anger was very real. Their son was born two months prematurely after Mrs. Thompson had suffered a severe illness soon after the abduction. Yet, the newborn was physically and mentally OK. Her doctors were surprised. At the time of her illness, the doctors had even suggested abortion. The doctors were certain the drugs and fever would cause brain damage in the baby. But the couple was Catholic and said no. The couple reported later that when the boy was six-years-old, his I. Q. was measured to"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"be over 170. By 2005, the son had pursued an advanced college degree in biochemistry. Richard Sigismund put Mr. Thompson under deep hypnosis on July 5, 1984, to see what he could remember about the creatures and craft. First, he was asked to draw the being in blue. As he drew, he answered questions. Husband: He's looking at us, telling us to come in (the craft). He's the leader. The leader is in a blue cape. It's stupid. It's illogical. Cape is illogical. He doesn't need a cape. (Says disgustedly.) Not like that. It's illogical. He doesn't talk with his mouth. He talks with his mind. Sigismund: Can you hear what he says? Husband: It isn't that it's words. It's feelings like: 'Don't worry. Don't be afraid. Don't worry about this.' He wants to know, they want to know about people. There's a bunch of them around us. Some hanging around a control box thing of some sort. There are controls all over the place. It stinks. Smells like a lousy LCT. (Launch Control Tower.) They take my wife off. I don't want her to go. I really get mad. An adrenaline rush. (He is very agitated.) I'm going to kill him! Then the other guy zaps me, puts me down ... little gadgets reach out and grab me. That's that. There's no way you're going to fight your way out of that one. That one little creep is over here ... in the shadow of the doorway where leader is standing. This one is hiding. He's dressed in a kind of gold. Stupid capes. A bove : Charcoal drawing of \"creep\" wearing multi-leveled collar. Below: Color pastel drawing of \"creep.\" Later on Mr. Thompson was to comment that the color of the paper was close to the being's skin color, not the pinkish pastel that he drew with under hypnosis.

Thompson also said his drawing of the face wasn't bony enough, too fleshy compared to the way the aliens actually looked. The husband was disturbed by the similarity between the charismatic being in blue who greeted them at the door of the craft and the creature in gold he did not like. When Sigismund showed the husband a charcoal drawing he had done in 1981, Mr. Thompson said, Husband: That's one of these guys. That's like this guy. (\"Creep\" in gold.) They got big heads. They aren't like we are. O n July 9, 1984, Mr. Thompson drew a pastel sketch of the craft he and his wife had been taken into. Sigismund asked him to explain the strange, angled \"struts\" supporting the craft. Husband: They're just armatures that come out. Can't see how they're attached, but they come out. They're like this. He drew the separate angles in the lower left of the picture. They probably fold down, I imagine. Come down and hold the ship up. R ichard Sigismund conducted drawing session during Mr. Thompson's hypnosis on July 9, 1984. The craft drawn with color pastels had arched windows and doorway that glowed orange. The disc was supported by angled \"erector set\" supports. Source: An Al i en Harvest © 1989 by Linda Moulton Howe. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"A t the conclusion of the separate hypnosis sessions, Sigismund brought Mr. and Mrs. Thompson together to discuss the drawings and their conscious memories. Both were alarmed about one shared memory. Each remembered warnings from the alien beings about a catastrophic event in the couple's lifetime that would destroy much of the Earth's population. But Mr. Thompson said he understood that some humans would be removed to safety by the beam technology and then returned later to Earth to start human life over. Those returned humans would retain their knowledge about the technology and culture that existed prior to the cataclysm. Is this information shared with abductees because it relates to the aliens' involvement with humans? Or is it manipulation of human anxieties for unknown motives? Why are alien beings taking minds, tissues and fluids from animals and humans? Why are people rendered unconscious and treated like laboratory animals? From the human point of view, it's a one-way trade route. What is taken is not paid for. And what's left behind is fear, anger, dead animals and traumatized people. Is it, from the alien point of view, an issue of their survival at our expense? Or a grand experiment in which we are the microbes under their microscopes? The aliens' disregard for human free will and emotion is one of their most disturbing characteristics. Regardless of the ultimate truth, bizarre animal mutilations have happened and are continuing to happen. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people worldwide claim to have had encounters with strange craft that uses a lifting beam technology operated by non-human beings. Perhaps straightforward proof of the non-human existence is something the alien entities do not want humans to have yet. If we understood the whole story, we might realize that our species faces a challenge to its future survival.
