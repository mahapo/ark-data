He had seen photographs of those humanoids that were on the ground in the Nevada desert and at Edwards AFB.” - E dward L. Moragne, Ph.D., Physicist R eturn to Part 1 January 3, 2010 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Continuation of Linda Moulton Howe's May 8, 1997, interview with Edward Leverne Moragne, Ph.D., at his Houston, Texas, home: Howe May 8, 1997, Interview with Edward Leverne Moragne, Ph.D.: “D O YOU THINK THERE IS ANY EVIDENCE OF WARRING PLANETS, OR SOME KIND OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL CONFLICT? DID ANYONE AT EDWARDS AFB TALK ABOUT THAT? Not from Edwards, but I met a man who seemed to know a lot about three different planets at war with each other and non-humans that use some kind of powerful weapons. But I don't know any details. DID YOU EVER WORK WITH VANEVAR BUSH, PH.D.? Yes, mostly on mathematics. V annevar Bush, Ph.D., Electrical Engineer, March 11, 1890 – June 28, 1974. Dr. Vannevar Bush with glasses shaking hands with first Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal, after Dr. Bush was sworn in as Chairman of the Research and Development Board on September 30, 1947. From: The Forrestal Diaries © 1951 edited by Walter Mi llis. [ Editor's Note: Bush was Vice-President and Dean of Engineering at MIT in Boston, Massachusetts, from 1932 to 1938. In June 1940 he convinced U. S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to give him funding and political support to create a new kind of collaborative relationship between military, industry, and academic researchers that had no congressional oversight and hardly any other oversight. While at MIT, Bush urged Col. Edward C. Harwood to found the American Institute for Economic Research as an independent, scientific research institute. Bush was appointed in June 1940 by FDR to be Chairman of the new National "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Defense Research Committee (NDRC). During 1941, the NDRC was subsumed into the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) with Bush as director, which controlled the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb until 1943. That year the Manhattan Project's administration was taken over by the U. S. Army. In all, OSRD directed 30,000 men and oversaw development of some 200 weapons and instruments of war, including sonar, radar, the proximity fuse, amphibious vehicles, and the Norden bomb sight, all considered critical in winning WWII. At one time, two-thirds of all the nation’s physicists were working under Vannevar Bush’s direction. ] WHAT WAS THE PROJECT? It had something to do with warfare, but was classified. I can't discuss what it was. He worked on many kinds of military systems. I can't tell you any more than I've told you. We need to get off him altogether. BUT HE'S DEAD LONG AGO. WHAT WAS HE INVOLVED IN THAT WAS SO SENSITIVE? He was in a highly classified position and had many projects handed to him at one time. There is enough classified material left behind by that man, it could wreck the country. NOW THAT DR. BUSH IS GONE AND EVERYTHING OLDER THAN 25 YEARS IS SUPPOSED TO BE DECLASSIFIED, WHY COULDN'T YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU WERE WORKING ON BACK IN THE 1940S? The point is, I can tell you how to make the hydrogen bomb. And that's been over 25 years, but I don't think I should. I'd get my head cut off for that. WERE YOU EVER IN A MEETING WITH VANNEVAR BUSH AND ALBERT EINSTEIN TOGETHER? No, but I know Einstein had some meetings with Vannevar Bush about getting money to build the Fermi lab in Chicago. DID YOU EVER TALK WITH VANNEVAR BUSH ABOUT EXTRATERRESTRAL BODIES AND SPACECRAFT? No. DID YOU TALK ABOUT THE SPACECRAFT AND BEINGS WITH ANYONE ELSE BEYOND DR. GRAHAM, DAVID AND DAVIS? Yes, I talked with several generals about that. WHAT GENERALS? General Groves. Back when he was first made general, we talked about some things that blew up in the desert. L t. General Leslie Richard Groves. August 17, 1896 - July 13, 1970. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Lieutenant General Leslie Richard Groves (August 17, 1896 – July 13, 1970) was a United States Army Engineer officer who oversaw the construction of the Pentagon and was the primary military leader in charge of the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb during"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"World Wa r II. ] We thought it was someone experimenting with a new weapon. But it could have been some outer space craft that flew in there and exploded on the ground. WHERE WAS THAT? In New Mexico. DID YOU EVER HEAR OF THE Z DIVISION AT SANDIA BASE IN ALBUQUERQUE HEADED BY JERROLD R. ZACHARIAS? J errold Reinach Zacharias, Ph.D., January 23, 1905–July 16, 1986, was an American physicist and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, Massachussetts. Photograph from National Academy of Sciences. [ Editor's Note: From Biographical Memoirs by National Academy of Sciences - “Jerrold R. Zacharias was given at assignment at MIT in 1940 to establish a lab on the MIT roof and build a radar system capable of detecting distant objects. His success led to his being asked by the U. S. Navy to install a radar set on a destroyer. When this was successfully completed, Zacharias became the Radiation Laboratory representative at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in Whippany, New Jersey during the development of a production model for the MIT 10-cm. night fighter radar. “Zacharias left MIT in 1945 a few months before the end of WWII (August 1945) to go to Los Alamos, New Mexico, to head the Ordnance Engineering Division, a position vacated by Captain (later Admiral) W. S. Parsons, who had left for the Pacific island of Tinian. That OED division later became the Z division, which evolved into the Sandia National Laboratories. Zacharias and his associates established an effective atomic beam research laboratory.” ] Yes, I knew a general out there and Ernest Colvin, who was a chemical engineer. DID YOU WORK WITH THE Z DIVISION? I discussed the extraterrestrial spacecraft. WHICH ONE? The one at Air Force 5 in southern Nevada that had the humanoids come out and lay down on the ground. THE SANDIA BASE Z DIVISION KNEW ABOUT AIR FORCE 5? I think they knew more about it than just about anyone else. AT&T WAS INVOLVED WITH THE Z DIVISION, WASN'T IT? Ye s , it w a s . DID YOU EVER KNOW ANYONE AT AT&T WHO KNEW ABOUT THE SPACECRAFT AT AIR FORCE 5? No, I didn't talk with AT&T about the spacecraft, but I knew they were involved."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"HAVE YOU EVR HEARD THE PHRASE, ‘Manhattan Engineering District Joint Chiefs of Staff Integrated Command?’ Ye s . WHAT DID THAT MEAN TO YOU? The Manhattan Project was the atom bomb. And they worked with Los Alamos and the White Sands Project in a combined effort. I sat in on some of their meetings out at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. DID THEY EVER TALK TO YOU ABOUT YOUR NEEDING A MAJIC CLEARANCE OR A MAJESTIC-12 CLEARANCE? Well, I had a top clearance - a red shield with the red, white and blue on the bottom. I could go anywhere. I could walk into the President's office in the White House with that thing on. DID IT HAVE YOUR NAME ON IT? Yes, it had my name on it and you could not duplicate it because it was stamped into the metal. DID YOU KNOW ABOUT ‘MAJIC’? Yes, MAJIC was supposed to be a group - I might be saying something here I'm not supposed to so I won't. I heard of them, that's all. DID YOU EVER HEAR OF A PROJECT CALLED WATER WHEEL? Ye s . W H AT WA S WAT E R W H E E L ? I can't talk about that either. WHAT WAS IT RELATED TO? Well, it was related to weaponry, but you don't talk about those things. BUT IF IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO, WHY WOULD IT STILL BE CLASSIFIED? It was classified until all of us connected with it would receive our de-classification letter. That had to be a certified letter. FROM WHOM? From the general, whoever would be in charge at the time of de-classification. HAVE YOU EVER RECEIVED DE-CLASSIFICATION NOTIFICATION LETTERS? A lot of different times. BUT NOT ON WATER WHEEL? No. March 27, 1983 Letter to President Ronald Reagan"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"WAS THE PROPOSAL TO PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN BASED ON BACK-ENGINEERING OF A CRAFT LIKE THE ONE YOU SAW IN THE NEVADA DESERT THAT WAS TAKEN TO EDWARDS AFB? Beyond that. I wanted to design a craft that would go between 30 and 60 times the speed of light. HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? You have to change direction of atomic material a little bit to do it. You go through with light and you're in a stall and reach a point of resonance where you don't age anymore. WHERE MASS IS INFINITE? Ye s . DID YOU EVER TALK WITH PRESIDENT REAGAN ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL? Yes. He wanted something that would cost the government practically nothing, but would employ 100,000 people. And he could not get that from the proposal. DID YOU EVER TALK WITH HIM ABOUT UFOS AND NON-HUMAN BEINGS? Yes, President Ronald Reagan knew more than I did, actually. He had seen photographs of those humanoids that were on the ground in the Nevada desert and at Edwards AFB. DID PRESIDENT REAGAN KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THOSE BEINGS ON THE GROUND? He said to me, ‘Whoever sent them here sure was a waste.’ WHY DID HE THINK IT WAS A WASTE?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"It was a very valuable and important spacecraft that was laying out there. HAD PRESIDENT REAGAN SEEN OTHER PHOTOGRAPHS OF NON-HUMAN BEINGS? I don't know. I never asked him. DID RONALD REAGAN TALK TO YOU ABOUT THERE BEING ANY THREAT FROM OUTER SPACE? No, nothing at all.” U. S. President Ronald Reagan's first meeting with Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev at Fleur D'Eau for Geneva Summit in Switzerland, on November 19, 1985. According to Pres. Reagan, he told Gorbachev, “...if suddenly there was a threat to this world from other species from another planet outside in the universe - we'd forget all the little local differences that we have between our countries...” Photo from Reagan Library. [ Editor's Note: U. S. President Ronald Reagan first raised the idea of an outer space threat during a December 4, 1985, speech at the Fallston High School in Fallston, Maryland, where he told students about his first November 19, 1985, summit with General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev in Geneva, Switzerland. According to a White House transcript, President Reagan told Gorbachev to think, “how easy his task and mine might be in these meetings that we held if suddenly there were a threat to this world from some other species from another planet outside in the universe - we'd forget all the little local differences that we have between our countries ...” Two years later at the full session of the United Nations General Assembly on September 21, 1987, Reagan said towards the end of his speech to the 42nd Session, “in our obsession with antagonisms of the moment, we often forget how much unites all the members of humanity. Perhaps we need some outside, universal threat to make us recognize this common bond. I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world. And yet, I ask is not an alien force already among us? What could be more alien to the universal aspirations of our peoples than war and the threat of war?” ] C ontinued in Part 5.
