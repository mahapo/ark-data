Nathan Twining) said flatly that the flying saucers are not the result of experiments by the armed forces. Neither the AAF nor any other component of the armed forces had any plane, guided missile or other aerial device which could be mistaken for a saucer or formation of flying discs. \" - J uly 8, 1947, Las Cruces Sun-News R eturn to Part 1 \"Secret War?\" Corona, San Antonio, Carrizozo and San Agustin Plain T he U. S. V-2 rocket program at WSPG appeared to be in trouble. On May 15, 1947, a V-2 almost landed in the center of Alamogordo, New Mexico. The U. S. Army's next V-2 launch on May 29, narrowly missed downtown Juarez, Mexico. Then on July 3, at 6:15 p.m., Army technicians were preparing the next V-2 for launch in the presence of Maj. Gen. Henry Saylor , Chief of U. S. Army Ordnance, Research and Development section and a member of JRDB's UARRP. But there was an eruption in an acid tank. [ Editor's Note: During WWII, General Dwight D. Eisenhower was in England to plan for the Normandy Invasion. SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces) was created. The chief Ordnance officer was Maj. Gen. Henry Saylor. Within his staff was the Technical Division and it had two sections. Research and Development under Col Horace Quinn and the Ordnance Technical Intelligence Section under Col. Holger Toftoy. Col Quinn’s section was concerned with weapons that might be fielded by the Germans and Col. Toftoy’s section was concerned with the weapons that were fielded. Under his staff supervision would be the Ordnance Technical Intelligence Teams. Source: U. S. Army Military Intelligence History.] The Las Cruces Sun-News reported in its July 4, 1947 newspaper: \"...an acid tank ruptured, spraying acid over a number of men reading the missile for a 7:37 p.m. launch. ...The acid filled a giant smoke bomb in a pressure tank with a timed detonator, which would have created a hug cloud of smoke to aid observation of upper atmosphere phenomenon. The smoke bomb rocket's firing has been delayed indefinitely, according to Col. Turner (White Sands Base Commander).\" That same date, the El Paso Times added these comments about the July 3, 1947, White Sands Proving Ground acid tank rupture. \"Eight men were injured, two burned critically. Six of the eight were taken to William Beaumont Army Hospital in El Paso. The precise cause of the accident had not been determined... but Lt. Col. Turner has ordered an immediate investigation.\" Another explanation for what happened the night of July 3, 1947, might be that the eight injured men were operating a high pressure fuel system of a Wasserfall surface-to-air missile when it failed while it was being fueled or pressurized prior to launch. The rocket's propulsion system, substantially different from a V-2's, relied upon a high pressure nitrogen gas system to blend Salbei oxidizer, a strong acid, through a cooling jacket of the combustion vessel before being directly injected with Visol propellant. The mixture was hyperbolic, requiring no ignition, once the two fuels were blended.

Two Discs Over WSPG Headquarters Less than 24 hours later, an El Paso building inspector reported that when he was traveling with four companions in his car on U. S. Highw ay 70 in the San Agustin Pass east of Las Cruces, they w atched tw o flying discs hover directly over the headquarters area of WSPG. All five watched the two flying discs for some time and decided to report it. When a newspaper reported called WSPG and asked if anyone at the base had seen the two flying discs directly above, the response was, \"We have no flying discs here.\" [ El Paso Times , July 8, 1947.] P lains of San Agustin are west of White Sands Missile Range and Socorro, New Mexico."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The V-2 rocket acid tank rupture at WSPG was never reported outside the local area. The two flying discs seen at exactly the same time hovering above the main post of WSPG were not mentioned either. F ront P age, Las Cruces Sun-News , July 8, 1947. \"Military Planes Hunt Sky Discs\" On July 4th, Wright Field, Ohio, a spokesman for General Nathan Twining's Air Material Command said: \"The Air Material Command is making an investigation of saucer-shaped missiles seen recently in the Pacific northw est and Texas.\" [ The New York Times , July 5, 1947.] This surprising announcement confirmed that AMC, established by President Truman and Dr. Vannevar Bush (MJ-2), investigated reports of flying discs. This was only one day before W. W. \"Mac\" Brazel found the remains of a crashed aerial disc on his Corona, New Mexi co, ranch and reported i t to the Rosw el l Sheri ff. The Corona and San Agusti n Pl ai ns events are w ell discussed and documented by Stanton Friedman and Don Berliner in Crash At Corona. Brief Corona/Roswell Disc Crash History W. W. \"Mac\" Brazel found a debris field of silver metal and beige-colored \"plastic\" parts on July 3, 1947. The next day on July Fourth, Brazel went to the Chavez County Sheriff in Roswell. Sheriff George Wilcox called Walker Field and was Major Jesse Marcel, Intelligence Officer of the 509th Bomb Group, came on the line. Major Marcel and others went to the Corona crash site. After they returned to Walker Field, it is presumed that they reported to the Commanding General of the Eighth Air Force in Ft. Worth, Texas, that they had investigated the debris field of a crashed disc technology. (MJ-12 documents leaked in the 1990s describe the Corona craft and others as wedge-shaped, not disc-shaped.) The Roswell AAF Base Commander asked his assistant, Walter Haut, to release the disc crash to the media. As the news was being transmitted over Associated Press teletype between Roswell and Albuquerque, the message traffic was electronically interrupted. The telephone rang at the Roswell base office and a man identified himself as an officer at the Pentagon who threatened the teletype operator, saying that \"bad things\" would happen if she did not immediately stop the transmission. At a radio station in Roswell on July 7, a news report about the Corona crash was being transmitted for ABC and the Mutual Broadcasting Network. The broadcast was interrupted by a teletype message: \"THIS IS THE FBI. YOU WILL CEASE TRANSMITTING.\" [ Crash At Corona © by Stanton Friedman.] The story being transmitted included the information that the crash debris was going to be taken to Texas. But apparently the airplanes that arrived for the debris were from Wright Field, Ohio, under the direction of General Nathan Twining (MJ-4). At the time, General Twining was at the AFSWP, Sandia Base, in Albuquerque. Later Gen. Twining traveled to Alamogordo Army Air Field and then went on to Carrizozo and Corona, New Mexico. In 1947, neither the United States nor any other military or security group of any other country could so immediately descend upon a small community and tie up their communication systems without considerable prior planning. A wire dispatch between Roswell and Albuquerque could not have been interrupted in the middle of a transmission without prior knowledge that the security group needed to monitor communication lines in a specific geographic area. The U. S. has that capability now, but we were not supposed to have it in 1947."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" F ront Page, The New York Times , July 7, 1947. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Other July 1947 Air Crashes Another strange air fatality also occurred on July 4th at the other end of the country. A father and his two children crashed at the end of the runway in Camden, New Jersey. Hundreds of people on Admiral Wilson Boulevard saw the plane fly directly into high tension wires, strike a pole and a tree before crashing against a fence. According to eyewitnesses, the plane never gained altitude at take off. [ Ibid.] Not far away in Seaford, Delaware, two light planes flying next to each other \"interlocked\" their wings in the air and crashed into a forest. The three young fliers in the two planes were killed instantly. [ Ibid.] By July 6, \"military aircraft were hunting the skies over Pacific coast states for flying saucers that for twelve days have puzzled the entire country. Five P-51 mustangs of the Oregon National Guard cruised over the Cascade Mountains with a sixth circling over Portland in constant radio contact with the other five.\" Col. R. G. Dodson, who commanded the National Guard, described their flight as a routine patrol. [ The New York Times , July 6, 1947.] General Carl Spaatz, Commander of the Army Air Forces, was in Washington state on a \"fishing trip.\" He denied knowing anything about flying discs and asserted that he had been out of touch for four or five days. After that interview, General Spaatz promptly left again to continue his \"fishing trip\" in Oregon. [ The New York Ti mes , July 7, 1947.] An Army Air Forces spokesman at the Pentagon suggested that many of the flying disc reports could be attributed to hail storms. \"The hail could have flattened out on one side and when observed from a distance could appear to float or glide to the ground.\" But despite the hail speculation, a P-80 jet fighter stood by at Muroc Field (Edwards AFB), California, to quickly take off if a flying disc was sighted there. Six other \"regular fighters\" were on alert in Portland, Oregon, ready to take off at immediately if a flying disc were sighted there. The New York Times reported on July 7, 1947: \"First sighted on June 25, and greeted generally with scornful laughs, the objects have been reported every day since by observers in thirty-three states. Airline pilots said that they have seen the discs, larger than aircraft, flying in 'loose formation' at high speed. \"A cautious attitude marked both official and scientific comments, but Capt. Tom Brown of the Air Forces Public Relations staff in Washington, D. C., acknowledged that the Air Forces had decided 'there's something to this' and has been checking up on it for ten days. \"'We still haven't the slightest idea what they (discs) could be,\" he added. \"But we don't believe that anyone in this country, or outside this country, has developed a guided missile that can go 1,200 miles per hour, as some reports have indicated.'\" In the same report, Major General Curtis LeMay, assistant Chief of Air Staff for Research and Development, said that \"there was nothing to worry about.\" General LeMay brought with him to the press conference psychiatrist Winfred Overholser, M. D. Dr. Overholser \"compared the reports to sea serpent stories and said they bear some of the earmarks of national hysteria.\" [ Las Cruces Sun-Times , July 7, 1947.] General Curtis LeMay was responsible for the strategic bombing of Europe and Germany during WWII and by 1948, he was responsible for the management, maintenance of air facilities at all of the U. S. National Atomic Weapons Repositories. He was also the first commander of the USAF Strategic Air Command (SAC). That same week on July 6, a Navy Helldiver could not gain altitude on take off from the Squantum Naval Air Station at quincy, Massachusetts. It crashed into three houses, leaving a smoking trail of wreckage. The pilot died and his enlisted passenger was seriously injured. The New York Times said on July 7, \"The plane skimmed over the heads of several thousand persons on Wollaston Beach, knocked the chimney from one house, crumpled the roof and upper rear of the second place, then plowed into the side of a third. The plane was the last of a series of organized reserve craft to take off from the base on a routine weekend training flight.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"T he New York Times , July 7, 1947, p. 13. Also on July 6, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, \"firemen used a sixty-five foot ladder and a rope to extricate a former flier of the Army Air Forces and his light plane from a treetop\" after the plane lost altitude as it approached the airport. \"Losing altitude as he approached the airport, the flier landed in the tree to avoid a crash. Pinioned on a top tree branch, pilot and plane hung there for more than an hour while hundreds of passersby on a nearby road looked on. The pilot was a colonel in the AAF and has had a private license for six years.\" T he New York Times , July 7, 1947, p. 17. On July 7, Major General Twining (MJ-4) of Wright Field's Air Material Command was reported in the July 8, 1947, Las Cruces Sun-News from a telephone interview while he was at Sandia Base, Kirtland Field in Albuquerque, thirty-six hours after the flying disc at Roswell had been discovered and reported by the 509th Bomb Group: \"(Gen. Twining) said flatly that the flying saucers are not the result of experiments by the armed forces. Neither the AAF nor any other component of the armed forces had any plane, guided missile or other aerial device which could be mistaken for a saucer or formation of flying discs. Some of these witnesses evidently saw something, but we don't know what we are"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"investigating.\" Alamogordo Air Field near White Sands was an AMC air field. Debris from the crashed disc site was being removed from Corona on July 7, and in the days following. What is also known now is that General Twining left Sandia Base in Albuquerque and flew directly to Alamogordo Air Field on July 7. General Twining allegedly collected flying disc debris directly on the orders of President Truman. [ El Paso Times , July 11, 1947 and Crash At Corona © by Stanton Friedman.] This author has information that at the same time the Corona crashed disc was being retrieved, another disc on the Plains of San Agustin was also being recovered. The San Agustin disc reportedly had tw o dead entities. One was severely injured and one was a live extraterrestrial biological entity (EBE) which attempted to comfort his fallen comrade at the crash site. This author also has information that yet another possible crash site was east of the Rio Grande River near San Antonio, New Mexico. F ront P age, Las Cruces Sun-News , July 8, 1947.
