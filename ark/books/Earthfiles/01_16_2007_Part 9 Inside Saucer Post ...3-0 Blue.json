Berger, ROTC, University of Cincinnati Return to Part 1 January 16 , 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - A n official publication of Civilian Research, Interplanetary Flying Objects (CRIFO) © 1957 by Leonard H. Stringfield. THE PHOTO 'FINISHERS' - Official and Otherwise Evidence, in saucer lore, assumes many forms. If not a three-dimensional filament of angel hair or a controversial \"hot rock,\" it can be a photograph or a movie showing a shape in the sky, a blip on radarscope, or a voice or sound on a tape recorder. When \"contact\" stories became popular in 1952, the tapes were quick to follow. I've heard several, each purporting to be evidence. One, sounding like a musical arrangement of Morse Code and believed to be signals from a space species, was in my opinion, wishful thinking. Most others, preachments and warnings by space people, are just pure bunk. Where the shysters really shine is in the photo lab. Their \"rogues' gallery is enormous. However, there are a number of \"fraudulent\" photographs in public circulation that belong, in all fairness, on the debatable list. In these instances, the photographer does not intend to be spurious, but is tricked unwittingly by optical phenomena, such as Newton Rings, or by a high-flying \"something,\" such as a meteor or balloon. Doubtlessly in this category, there are thousands of \"saucer\" photographs that will never be heard of, or seen, by either the Air Force or a civilian agency because ( 1) the photographer doesn't give a hoot about saucers, or (2) his scruples go beyond opportunity! A good example of unexploited opportunity is that involving a 35mm Kodachrome slide in the collection of Jack Gunderman of my advertising office. The photograph was snapped by Gunderman through his automobile's windshield while en route to a Mexican vacation in September 1956. My first opportunity to see the slide was at a friend's home and it all "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"happened quite unceremoniously. We had just passed pictorially through Texas into the desert wastes of Mexico, when the slide was projected and everyone exclaimed, \"Flying saucers!\" In view was a simple roadside scene and a spacious sky. In the upper left hand corner were two silvery discs, one astride the other, both tilted as though ready to sweep down on the road. Asking Gunderman if he had been holding out on us, he smiled knowingly and said that he never thought of them as being saucers, but was sure they were just optics. On the other hand, the Air Force handling of saucer film is just as mysterious as some of the film submitted to them for study. Despite their Fact Sheets which attempt to explain away all saucer film, they are not eager to admit possession of certain film, especially such that is not so easily explained away! In mind is the photograph taken July 19, 1956, by a teenager, Michael Savage, of a disc flying near his home in San Bernardino, California. According to the town paper, The Daily Sun, officers at George AFB were interested in the boy's experience and wanted to see the negatives. And, according to a letter published in APRO, which its editor received from Dr. Leonard Taylor, friend and neighbor of the Savage family, \"...We reported to the Air Force at George Air Field and were contacted by personnel from Norton AFB who personally reviewed the site of picture taking. I have personally examined the No. 127 negative prior to giving it to AF personnel, who asked to borrow it and send it to ATIC.\" (Air Technical Intelligence Center) But in October of 1956 when an informed ATIC agent visited my home to pick up the angel hair specimen, I asked about the Savage film, and was told that it had never been received by ATIC. Had Norton AFB actually sent the film to ATIC? If so, were they unable to explain away the object in the photo, thereby classifying its analysis - and causing their agent to deny its possession? A nother act of hocus pocus involves the Mayher film, a 16mm movie which shows a bright saucer-shaped object streaking over Miami, Florida, July 29, 1952. Accompanied by friends, Ralph C. Mayher shot forty feet of film, but today he owns only a few frames thanks to somebody's slight of hand. After shooting the film, Mayher phoned the Marine Air Station. Sent to the scene was Lt. Aldridge who took the film roll with him when he left. For the rest of the story, I quote from Tom Comella's Research Bulletin of June 21, 1955, as follows: \"Although denied the right to show his (Mayher's) films while in uniform, copies were supposedly sent to the Air Force for analysis. However, a letter addressed to Mayher and dated April 13, 1954, revealed the following: 'This is to advise you that a search of the Air Technical Intelligence files has failed to show that the Air Force has ever received the film you mentioned. It is our belief that since this film was originally submitted to a naval base, it must still remain with naval intelligence.' The letter was signed by 1st Lt. R.C. White. Mayher then wired the Marine Corps Air Station in Miami where he was stationed as a service photographer the night he caught the UFO on film. The reply, dated April 19, 1954, stated: 'Saucer film turned over to Air Force on July 31, 1952.' The telegram carried the name of Col. T. G. Enis, C. O. of the air station.' USAF Takes UFO Films Another movie film which apparently fell prey to Air Force legerdemain was that photographed by Nicholas Mariana on August 19, 1950, at Great Falls, Montana. The story is told in a technical article by R. M. L. Baker, appearing in the Spring 1957 issue of Saucers as follows: \"...Mr. Mariana recalls that the Kodachrome original, as returned to him from the Eastman Kodak Processing Laboratory, comprised 315 frames. This original film was shown by him before several clubs and other audiences in Montana. He recalls that the first 30-odd frames showed larger images of the UFOs with a notch or band at one point on the periphery of the objects by which they could be seen to rotate in unison, while on the rest of the film the objects show up only as unarticulated bright, white dots. The film as returned by the Air Force, according to Mr. Mariana, had had the first 35 frames removed and only the remainder of the film was returned and that the clipped-off part was lost.\" Still another case of apparent mishandling involves the famous Tremonton film, the property of Mr. Delbert Newhouse, a Chief Warrant Officer in the U. S. Navy, who photographed 10 to 14 UFOs seven miles north of Tremonton, Utah, on July 2, 1952. After extensive analysis, according to Newhouse, by the Air Force, Navy and private laboratories, the original was not returned. Other Confiscations"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Faring worse was William Rhodes who, in July 1947, snapped a photo of a UFO over Phoenix, Arizona, submitting it to authorities for analysis. According to a letter which appeared in the Spring 1948 issue of Fate magazine, Rhodes got nothing in return. My first and only experience with a controversial film and its controversial handling by the Air Force began on October 14, 1956, when I received three separate reports of UFOs traversing the skies over and near Cincinnati. Later I learned that on the evening of that date, Harry Baston, a photographer interested in lunar studies, had taken several experimental photos through his 6-inch telescope, three of the moon. In a fourth photo not focused on the moon, a luminous object appeared. the object was off-center and cut off at the edge of the photograph. But the portion showing is semi-oval and sharply defined. Radiating around the semi-oval is a misty aura of light. The background is totally black, no celestial bodies showing. Baston says he cannot explain the object, or image, and is certain that it is not a type of Newton Ring or other optical phenomena. Baston is also of the opinion that the apparent object was not a result of the film's development fluid, for he has the negative and this also shows the semi-oval and the aura. Unable to explain the one photograph, I phoned Captain Gregory at ATIC. I told him of my acquisition and when he indicated interest, I offered to submit three photos (and five negatives) to his office for analysis. While on the subject of photographs, Gregory emphasized ATIC's extensive employment of top scientists, including foreign, to analyze any purported evidence concerning UFOs. He also remarked on the \"rumor\" charging the Air Force of being \"guilty of not returning UFO film or the originals\" to its owner and suggested that I personally number the backs of each photo submitted so that I could determine its return. The rest of the story is best told in a letter dated May 14, 1957, from Major T. J. Connair, Jr., Adjutant, ATIC, which follows: \"Attached herewith are the original three (3) photographs and five (5) negatives which you submitted to this organization for review and comment on 7 November 1956. Reference is also made to your letter of 12 January 1957 in which you requested the status and disposition of this material. \"We regret the delay, but as part of the study and reviews, the photographs were submitted to a scientist who later was assigned to an overseas project, leaving them behind. \"With respect to our findings, please be advised that the photographs and negatives were subjected to a series of microscopic and other examinations, including a motion picture size projection. The light appears to be emanating from an outside source into a container believed to be the inside of a telescope tube and photographed with the camera at the eyepiece and being at a slight tilt or angle. A comparison of the sky around the moon with the dark portion around the ovoid of light further indicates that the latter coloration is not a photograph of the sky. The fringe of light to the left of the ovoid (in our opinion) attest to this. \"We are not in position to comment whether your source, which you state is an astronomer, was or was not aware of this, or if this is merely a case of an attempted hoax with you as an unwitting intermediary. \"Copies have been made of the original material to be included with our analysis and other data in case files.\" I have only two comments. One, Harry Baston, who is not an astronomer, never declared that the ovoid image in the photo was a UFO or a saucer. Having given consent to submit the photo to Air Force specialists, he would have realized the chances of himself being exposed as a hoaxer. Thus, I am sure the photo is not a hoax! Two, the original three photos I submitted were not returned! THE NORWOOD SEARCHLIGHT INCIDENT If we were to use another exemplary case in which photographs, including movies, play a prominent part, not only as evidence but again illustrating a possible legerdemain , I would cite the Norwood searchlight incident. But as the facts stand, this one case is exemplary in more ways than photography. To me, it is one of the best cases on civilian record in regards to testimonial evidence. That is: if we accept as evidence certain scientific statements and evaluations, plus thousands of witnesses, including members of the Catholic clergy, the press and the military."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The incident begins August 19, 1949, during a carnival on the grounds of the St. Peter and Paul Church in Norwood, Ohio, a city of 35,000 population \"within\" the city of Cincinnati. For such occasions, Reverend Gregory Miller, pastor of the church, had purchased from army surplus an 8 million candle power searchlight. Borrowed to operate it was Sergeant Donald R. Berger of ROTC of the University of Cincinnati. It was during the height of festivities when Sgt. Berger's sweeping searchlight suddenly flashed across a stationary circular object in the sky. Rev. Miller was called to the scene and later others joined in. That was the beginning. From that date until March 10, 1950, when the object was last seen, Sgt. Berger, who thought he had picked up a \"space platform,\" began logging the events which follow: \" August 19, 1949. Place: St. Peter and Paul Church, Norwood, Ohio. 2015 to 2300 hours. While operating for festival, picked up object at 1585 mils elevation. The object was stationary, appearing as glowing disc. When I moved the searchlight away, the disc continued to glow. Estimated range: 4 or 5 miles. The sky was clear with thin haze at high altitude. I took no action, but next day articles appeared in two local papers re: object. Sept. 11, 1949. Place: St. Gertrude Church, Madeira, Ohio. 1915 to 2315 hours. Picked up object at 15,000 to 20,000 feet at 1620 mils elevation. The object disappeared within a few seconds, traveling straight up. I picked it up again at much greater altitude. Then, when I changed carbons, I lost it again until 2115 hours. As soon as it reappeared, I phoned Wright-Patterson Field. The sky was clear with no visible clouds or haze. Several thousand people also saw object. Sept. 17, 1949. Place: Milford, Ohio. 1900 to 2000 hours. Testing the searchlight about dusk, I had it set at 1600 mils. I could see an object which looked like a white glow. When I turned the light off, I could see nothing. I did this several times. As soon as it became dark, I turned on the light at same elevation and caught object in the beam. Oct. 23, 1949. Place: St. Peter and Paul, Norwood. 1915 to 2245 hours. I turned on the light and picked up object at 1600 mils. Among those present were William Winkler, Father Gregory Miller, Robert Linn (Managing Editor, Cincinnati Post ) and Leo Hirtl ( Post reporter). Reverend Miller and Linn phoned Wright-Patterson and reported object to Intelligence Officer. About 2200 hours, two distinct groups of triangular-shaped objects seemed to come out of the main disc. Each group had about five objects. They came down the beam and then turned out of the beam. The same performance was repeated about half hour later. The disc was still visible when I turned out the light for the night. Oct. 24, 1949. Place: St. Peter and Paul. 1915 to 2100 hours. Set light at 1600 mils. The object appeared immediately in the beam. ATIC agent and Lou Gerhart with me at the time. Held object in beam for about half hour until covered by clouds. Nov. 19, 1949. Place: Norwood, Ohio. 1830 to 2245 hrs. At 1915 hours the beam of the light flashed on the object. Guiding the light back on the object, it then disappeared immediately. About a minute later I picked it up again much higher. The elevation was between 1605 and 1610 mils. Many witnesses, including William Winkler. Sky was covered with low broken clouds. At time, objects appeared much brighter. Dec. 20, 1949. Place: Norwood, Ohio. 2015 to 2200 hours. Turned light on at 2015 and picked up object immediately. At first it was faint and small. As haze cleared, object brightened. At 2130 it got much brighter and spread out almost as large as beam, then disappeared. Present were D.A. Wells (Un. of Cincinnati physicist), Dr. Paul Herget (Un. of Cincinnati astronomer), two O.S.I. members, Father Miller, the mayer of Norwood (R. Ed Tepe) and Reginald Myers. According to Rev. Miller, their names were suspiciously alike: one Eichleberger and the other Eichlebarger. In discussing this, we agreed the similarity seemed more than just coincidence. Jan. 11, 1950. Place: Norwood, Ohio. 1930 to 2115 hrs. turned on light, but didn't find object until about 1945 hours when haze blew away. Observed it for about 15 minutes, very clearly, then it dimmed. It was called to my attention that some smaller objects were passing through the beam. I saw at least two objects several times. Also present were William Winkler and M/Sgt. R. Ekleberry, M/Sgt. John Savage and Sgt. W. Pflueger of the Air National Guard."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"March 9, 1950. Place: Norwood, Ohio. 2000 to 2200 hours. About 2000 I picked up object with the light. About 2045 hrs. two small objects came out of the disc and it looked as if the disc was pushed out of the beam. In about ten minutes, the disc moved back into the beam. The sky was clear. Eleven people were present. March 10, 1950. Place: Norwood, Ohio. 1900 to 2300 hours. Caught object in beam at 1600 mils. At 1945 hours the object moved up and across the beam and disappeared. Half hour later, object reappeared in beam in same position. Object stayed in beam until I turned light off for the night. Present were Father Miller, Capt. Wilks, R.Myers, Wm. Winkler and others. Capt. Wilks phoned Wright-Patterson Field. Capt. Wilks watched the object with glasses while I moved the light.\" Had I awaken several months earlier in 1950 from my great oblivion, I might have been lucky to glimpse the searchlight-illumined object. But as fate had it, it was not until 1952, while appearing as a guest on a special \"saucer\" program on WCPO-TV that I got a proper perspective into the case. Among the program's participants, which included local saucer sighters, was Rev. Gregory Miller who reviewed Sgt. Berger's log and described his own observations. Also present was Harry Mayo, City Editor of the Cincinnati Post. He was not talking because of laryngitis. Leo Hirtl, a Post columnist honked skeptically at saucers because he thought that the small objects seen on the eventful night of October 23, were \"geese.\" Tempers flared. Rev. Miller reminded Hirtl that geese do not have tail lights. I, not to be outdone, put in my interplanetary two cents worth. After the program, and with the cast once again becalmed, Rev. Miller called me aside. From his pocket, he handed me several photographs. \"They'll show you the object in the searchlight beam. If you and your wife have time, I'd like to show you some movies.\" Continued in Part 10 - Scenes from Norwood, Ohio, Searchlight Incident More Information: For further information about Leonard Stringfield's UFO Status Reports, please see reprints below from the Earthfiles Archives: Status Reports I • 10/25/2005 -- Final Part 6: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody • 10/13/2005 -- Part 5: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody • 10/05/2005 -- Part 4: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody • 09/30/2005 -- Part 3: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody • 09/26/2005 -- Part 2: Retrievals of the Third Kind - Kingman, Arizona Crash • 09/25/2005 -- Part 1: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody Status Reports II • 09/19/2005 -- Final Part 9: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 09/17/2005 -- Part 8: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 09/14/2005 -- Part 7: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 09/06/2005 -- Part 6: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 08/22/2005 -- Part 5: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 08/17/2005 -- Part 4: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 07/20/2005 -- Part 3: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 07/14/2005 -- Part 2: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 07/12/2005 -- Part 1: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data Status Reports III • 07/05/2005 -- Final Part 15: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence • 06/20/2005 -- Part 14: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence • 06/17/2005 -- Part 13: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence • 05/10/2005 -- Part 12: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence • 05/04/2005 -- Part 11: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence • 04/19/2005 -- Part 10: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence © June 1982 by Leonard H.
