Photograph © 2001 by Daily News , Milton, Florida. August 12, 2001 Navarre, Florida and Austin, Texas Since the 1970s, there have been waves of cat mutilations in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. In the summer of 2001, more mutilated cats are being found. Navarre, Florida On Saturday, June 30, in the small beach town of Navarre, Florida about fifteen miles east of Pensacola a cat was found strangely cut up near its home. The owners, John and Pattie Goodfleisch, had two cats: one female all white and the other male all black. On that Saturday morning, after the couple had let the cats out and awaited their return, the black male cat did not come back. The couple began searching and found the cat's severed front body on a sandy path near their house. He had been sliced from just behind his front legs all the way back to his tail bone. The missing half was never found. The Tiger Point Animal Hospital was asked to do a necropsy to determine cause of death. The veterinarian said the wound did not appear to be accidental and the assumption was that a human with specific intent had cut the cat lengthwise and removed one half.

Austin, Texas Since March at least a dozen cats have been found cut in half behind their front legs in the northwestern residential area of Austin, Texas. The internal organs and spine sections are cleanly severed, but there is very little if any blood at the scene and no signs of struggle, leading investigators to speculate that the cats are being cut up somewhere else and then returned to their home vicinity. The Austin Police Department and the Travis County Sheriff's Office have been investigating and a large monetary reward has been offered for any information about the perpetrators. Currently, there are no current suspects and law enforcement officials are baffled. I talked this week with Deputy Jimmy Quick at the Travis County Sheriff's Office about the repeating pattern in the dozen unusual cat deaths he is investigating, the most recent being August 4. Mutilated half cat photographed by Plano, Texas Police Officer for Incident Report #91-44994, August 31, 1991 . Interview: Deputy Jimmy Quick, Austin Police Department, Austin, Texas: \"As a pattern, exactly what you mentioned the first time being cut behind the shoulders and bloodless and organs missing. HAVE THE HEADS BEEN PRESENT HOOKED ONTO THE NECK AND FRONT LEGS IN ALL TWELVE CASES? Not all twelve. In all but two. In ten of them, the head was present. The organs were missing. Then in the latest two, they were chopped up into pieces and some legs were skinned, but some organs were still missing and still bloodless. DR. WILLIAM CAMPBELL WAS THE EXCEPTION IN THAT THEY FOUND BLOOD. Yeah, his was one of those that they think might have happened in the yard right next door. They found blood and hair. But according to the Offense Report, the officer said, 'No, it didn't happen there because of the lack of blood.' so, you know I'm going with both. THERE IS A POSSIBLE CONFLICT THERE IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF BLOOD. Yeah. Only one of those is a Sheriff's Office case. Eleven of them are city police cases. In fact, we're the one who put out the number and we started getting all the information of people calling, filling us in on all the dates they have"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"occurred that weren't reported. That's when we discovered about eight more. YOU'RE UP TO ABOUT A DOZEN? The public wasn't aware and once they were, most people just thought it was like an animal attack of some sort. They thought it was kind of strange, pretty clean cuts, and no blood, but they didn't think to call anyone. DR. CAMPBELL SAID THEY WERE ABLE TO VERIFY IN THE NECROPSY ON HIS OWN CAT THAT IT WAS DEFINITELY CUT WITH A SURGICAL INSTRUMENT BOTH IN THE TRACHEA AND IN THE BODY. Right, that's correct. WHAT ARE YOU IN THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE COORDINATING WITH THE AUSTIN POLICE DEPARTMENT DOING? ARE YOU PATROLLING IN THE AREA? Oh, yes, we have already beefed up patrol in that area and in those early morning hours. And we're looking to send extra people out. We sent the information out to our troops that work the area and told them to be on the lookout for anything in those hours because we're kind of narrowing it down to between 4 and 6 a.m. - at least when they are being returned. We're not sure, being that it appears these are being mutilated elsewhere, we're not sure what time that's occurring, but we know they are being returned between 4 and 6 a.m. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT? Because of the times of peoples' dogs, times that dogs are barking in the neighborhood. We've had one incident where a lady said the dogs went crazy and she had been out with her dog like an hour before. The dogs were going crazy and she went back out again a little after 4 a.m. and there it was and the dog hit on it immediately. so, that's how we're narrowing those times down. People go out and take their dogs outside. Now, a lot of those houses out there are big houses on big properties and they are not fenced. So, they go out with their dogs. And they take them out about 4 in the morning. Even my dog gets up about that time. I don't know what it is, but about 4 in the morning some are going out with their dogs and some have told us, 'At 4 a.m., there was nothing there in my neighbor's yard because my dog always sniffs around and goes all over the place. I went out there again at 4:30 a.m. and my dog went right after it.' So, that's happened at least three or four times and that's how we're knowing those times. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT HOWEVER THESE CATS HAVE BEEN RETURNED, IT'S HAPPENING ION A VERY TINY TIME PERIOD WITH PEOPLE KNOWING IT WASN'T THERE AT 4 A.M. AND FINDING IT AT 4:30 A.M. Either happening at that narrow time period, or happening, the cats are being picked up earlier, OK? - and taken somewhere and the parts are brought back between that time period. That's what I don't know. All I can tell you is that the cats are being dropped back off, if that's the case, during that time period (of 4-6 a.m.) WHAT'S BAFFLING IS THAT IF PEOPLE ARE OUT WALKING THEIR DOGS AND ARE AWARE THAT THERE WAS NO CAT IN THE YARD AT 4 A.M. AND THEY FIND IT AT 4:30 A.M., HOW DID SOMEBODY, OR SOMETHING, RETURN. HOW DID THEY RETURN THE CAT WITHOUT PEOPLE NOTICING THAT? I don't know. That's puzzling to us. And they've got up to a $6,800 reward right now and we still haven't gotten any calls. And I would think that if anyone had any information because we've asked for anything. And no one has given us anything.\" "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Necropsy on Cat Owned by William Campbell, D.V.M. On July 26, 2001 at 8 a.m., one of the Austin cats was found cut in half and both front and back ends were in the neighbor's yard next door to the owners, Dr. William Campbell, a veterinarian, and his wife, Linda. The Campbells work at the Anderson Mill Animal Clinic in Austin. The police investigated and asked Dr. Campbell to have a necropsy done on his mutilated cat. Dr. Campbell asked one of his colleagues in the clinic to do the necropsy. Jasen Trautwein, D.V.M., studied both the front and back sections of Dr. Campbell's cat and made a surprising discovery. Jasen Trautwein, D.V.M., Anderson Mill Animal Clinic, Austin, Texas : \"What I found most interesting was that there were two puncture wounds right under the neck that were about 1/8th inch in diameter and about 1/8th an inch apart. I almost missed them just looking over the cat because there were no signs externally. there was no blood or other evidence of trauma except for these two perfect puncture wounds. And then when I looked from the inside, I could follow these tracks - I still can't figure out what this device is - made tracks up through the tongue, so they both went through the tongue in the same hole like one long slice in the back of the tongue, and then up into the tympanic bulla, the inner ear on the base of the skull and it fractured the bone there. Fragments and clotted blood were in that area, but none on the outside of those wounds. WAS THE ENTRANCE AT THE FRONT OF THE JAW? If you were going to scratch a cat under its chin, it would be almost right where the cat's Adam's apple would be. WHERE IT ENTERED THE SKULL, DID IT PENETRATE THE BRAIN TISSUE? Well, the inner ear is part of the brain, so technically, yes. BUT IN TERMS OF THE GREY MATTER? I wouldn't know that because I didn't cut it open any further than that. I sent the cat to the police pathologist. They might have cracked that skull open. I didn't have any tools to really do that so I didn't do it. FROM A MEDICAL POINT OF VIEW, CAN YOU THINK OF ANY PRACTICAL PROCESS OR PRODUCT THAT YOU COULD GET BY DRIVING THOSE TWO HOLES THROUGH THE THROAT AND INTO THE AREA YOU SAW? The only thing I thought they might be doing was they were using that to like if you put it on some hooks to help you hold it still, like especially if it was one person. It might have been a device to give it some tension so it would be easier to skin or cut those other holes. It would make it easier to do the dissection. THOSE TWO HOLES MIGHT HAVE BEEN USED BY SOME INSTRUMENT THAT WOULD HOLD THE CAT IN PLACE WHILE THE REST OF THE EXCISIONS WERE DONE? Yeah, that's the only thing I could come up. TO SEPARATE THE CAT AT THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS RIGHT BEHIND THE TWO FRONT LEGS, WHAT KIND OF INSTRUMENT WOULD IT TAKE TO DO WHAT YOU SAW? It was a really clean cut. The trachea and esophagus were cut perfectly clean. It was cut behind C-2 which is the second cervical vertebrae and it was actually a very clean cut there. It would take a good necropsy knife or filet knife to get through the tissue there. It takes a little bit of energy. WAS THERE ANY BLOOD LEAKING FROM AROUND THE EXCISIONS?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"No, not really. There was a little bit of blood on the fur, on the paws. But everywhere else there wasn't really any blood. Not as much as you would expect. DIDN'T THAT SEEM UNUSUAL? Oh, yeah, I thought that was kind of strange. IN THE BACK HALF OF THE CAT, WERE THERE ANY INTESTINAL ORGANS? The large intestine was still there and about half an inch of the small intestine attached to the large intestine. And it almost appeared as if it had been tied off as if to keep all the contents from falling out like the way someone would if they were gutting a deer and they tie a knot around the intestines. that way, if they cut them, they don't spill everywhere. THAT MEANS THAT.... the stomach, heart, lungs, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, bladder, rib cage and ribs and all of the vertebrae from - 8 cervical, 13 thoracic and 7 lumbar - all gone. WAS THERE ANY BLOOD AT ALL IN THE BACK HALF OF THE CAT? Only a small amount on the fur. And that was interesting. The legs were broken. They looked like someone had sort of cracked them with their hands. COULD THAT HAVE OCCURRED IF THE ANIMAL HAD BEEN DROPPED FROM THE AIR? I wouldn't think so. Not the way cats fall, or the pieces fall. No, this was like someone was starting to skin it and it's almost like you would grab a turkey leg. If you grabbed a stick on both ends and trying to pull your hands together and how the stick would snap in the middle, that's how the legs were broken. That's how it was broken. It had a force on both sides, I think. When cats are dropped, they usually crack their sternums. But this one didn't have a sternum. I wouldn't expect it to break the way this broke. Some of the leg bone breaks looked like they were cut almost with tree trimmers. WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND WHEN YOU THOUGHT, 'WHY ISN'T THERE MORE BLOOD?' I thought someone had drained it. Some sort of cult type thing. some sort of ritualistic killing. I don't know. What surprised me most is that I would have expected the animal to be a bit messier. BECAUSE TO GET ALL OF THAT INTERNAL STUFF OUT, YOU WOULD THINK BLOOD WOULD HAVE SPILLED OUT ON THE FRONT AND BACK HALF OF THE CAT. Yeah, I would have expected it to be messier, exactly. DOESN'T THIS SEEM TO IMPLY THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THIS CAT, THEY CUT IN TWO AND REMOVED ALL THOSE ORGANS AND STUFF THAT IT HAD TO HAPPEN SOME PLACE ELSE THAT WAS NOT IN THAT YARD. AND THE CAT HAD TO BE DROPPED, THROWN, RETURNED SOMEHOW TO THAT YARD. BUT THE PROCEDURE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN DONE IN THAT YARD. I wouldn't say couldn't, but definitely it's less likely. IT' IS MORE LIKELY IT WAS DONE SOMEWHERE ELSE... And brought back. Yeah.\" More Information"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Authorities have asked anyone with information to call the City of Austin Animal Cruelty Investigator, Roy Erwin, at 512-708-6022 or the Travis County Sheriff's Office at 512-473-9721. When there is a re-emergence of cat and dog mutilation cases, there is usually an upsurge in mutilations of larger animals such as cows and horses. And this spring I've also reported about unusual deaths and mutilations of horses and cattle in Missouri and Kentucky. And recently the Saskatchewan, Canada Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) reported that it has seen nearly 100 cases over the past decade in which cows, horses and other animals have been found with their sexual organs bloodlessly removed. The most recent case was a mutilated cow on May 19. A veterinarian who examined the cow said the cuts were very clean, bloodless yet surgical and it was a \"weird case.\" Dave Long, coordinator of investigations for the Saskatchewan SPCA says there is no evidence of tearing or pulling to remove the excisions. The tissue is not hacked out. It's done expertly, like expert incisions cut it out. Coyotes bite and tear. They can't use surgical instruments.\" If anyone has information about current unusual animal deaths in your area, including cats, horses, cows or any other domestic animal, please e-mail me at: earthfiles@earthfiles.com .
