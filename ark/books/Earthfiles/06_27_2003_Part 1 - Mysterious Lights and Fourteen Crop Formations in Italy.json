Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Part 1 - Mysterious Lights and Fourteen Crop Formations in Italy © 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe June 27, 2003 Rome, Italy - For the first time on record, a crop formation was discovered within the city limits of Rome. Also, for the first time over a period from April 25 to June 27, thirteen more unexplained patterns in cereal crops beyond the one in Rome have been reported from the north to the south and east to west in the long \"boot\" of Italy. Whatever is happening, Italy has also had mysterious lights associated with some of its crop formations this year. To better understand the chronology and location of the Italian crop patterns, this week I talked with Adriano Forgione, Editor, Hera magazine, in Rome. The following is a chronological evolution with Adriano's comments. Interview: Adriano Forgione, Editor, Hera magazine, Rome, Italy provided this summary with comments: 1) April 25, 2003 Location: Settimo San Pietro, near Cagliari, on the island of Sardinia. Pattern: Diagram above Images: No aerial photographs, but two photographs of stretched nodes.

This phenomenon is usually found only inside crop patterns, not in the normal crop outside.

Pattern: Three circles of varying diameters in a line similar to Montegranaro on June 8. Images: No photos. June 7, 2003 On the night of June 7 at 5:30 p.m. in the late afternoon., three teenage boys were walking along a field two or three kilometers outside Montegranaro, near Ascoli, in the center of Italy about 20 kilometers from the Adriatic Sea and 250 kilometers north of Rome. The young men were astonished to see a sphere of light appear and send a thin beam down into the crop. One of the teenagers had a new cell phone that can snap digital photographs and he took two frames. Adriano Forgione, Editor of Hera magazine, heard about the young man's images from the mayor of Montegranaro, a longtime friend. Forgione contacted the young man and obtained one of the two images shown below."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" June 7, 2003 at 5:30 p.m., a 17-year-old young man who has asked to remain anonymous, took this digital image on his new cell phone that has a built-in digital camera near Montegranaro, Italy. The next morning three circles in a line of varying sizes were discovered, similar to the earlier Settimo formation. Image provided by Adriano Forgione, Editor, Hera magazine, Rome, Italy. \"They saw this ball of light glowing in the ground and created this light this they told me this light beam to the ground, but no crop was formed then, nothing set on the ground, only this light beam. He did 2 pictures. He gave me only one, but I saw this picture on his phone. It's impossible to make a fake on the phone, I can tell you. For me, it is an original witness. THERE CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN A LOT OF DESCRIPTIONS AROUND THE WORLD OF PEOPLE SEEING SPHERES OF LIGHT THAT HAVE EXTENDED BEAMS OF LIGHT OUT TO OTHER SPHERES OR DOWN TO THE GROUND LIKE THIS PHOTOGRAPH. EARLY THE NEXT MORNING IN MONTEGRANARO, THREE CIRCLES IN A LINE WERE FOUND? Right. 3) June 8, 2003 Location: Montegranaro, near Ascoli, in the center of Italy about 20 kilometers from the Adriatic Sea and 250 kilometers north of Rome. Pattern: Three circles in a line of varying sizes like Settimo's April 25, 2003 formation. Images: Aerial photo by Adriano Forgione. Montegranaro's first of five formations in the region since this one was discovered on June 8, 2003, not far from the site the young man saw and photographed the sphere of light emitting a beam downward the night before on June 7, 2003 at 5:30 p.m. Aerial photograph © 2003 by Adriano Forgione. More Mysterious Lights AND THEN THE NIGHT OF JUNE 8? There was a sighting of some blue and white balls of light in the sky. There was"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"a scramble of military jets and in the morning of June 9, there was a single circle in a field in Potenza Picena. AND THAT POTENZA PICENA CIRCLE WAS IN THE AREA WHERE THE PEOPLE HAD SEEN THE BLUE AND WHITE LIGHTS AND THE JET WAS SCRAMBLED? Yes, the same place. There were also some military who had gone inside the circle and also some police. THE POLICE WENT INSIDE OF THE POTENZA PICENA CIRCLE? Ye s . DID ANYONE KNOW WHY THE MILITARY WOULD BE GOING OUT INTO THE CIRCLE AT POTENZA PICENA? Because there were a lot of rumors about this, the ball of lights, about the crop circles, so they were called by the people there who saw the blue lights. Then the people were scared by the helicopters and jets. But the police and military said they found nothing, no anomaly. 4) June 9, 2003 Location: Potenza-Picena, about 10 kilometers from Montegranaro. Pattern: Large single circle, 30 meters diameter (98.4 feet).
