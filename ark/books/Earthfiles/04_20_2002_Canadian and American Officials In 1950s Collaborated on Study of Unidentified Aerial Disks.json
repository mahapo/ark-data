Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Canadian and American Officials In 1950s C ollaborated on Study of Unidentified Aerial Disks © 2002 by Linda Moulton Howe “I t can be deduced that the vehicles (unidentified disks) have the following significant characteristics. They are a hundred feet or more in diameter; they can travel at speeds of several thousand miles per hour; they can reach altitudes well above those, which would support conventional aircraft or balloons; and ample power and force seem to be available for all required manoeuvres. Taking these factors into account, it is difficult to reconcile this performanc with the capabilities of our technology, and unless the technology of some terrestrial nation is much more advanced than is generally known, we are forced to the conclusion that the vehicles are probably extraterrestrial, in spite of our prejudices to the contrary.” - F rom an August 1952, classified report to Project Magnet for Canada's Department of Transportation, by Wilbert B. Smith, Project Magnet Director, DOT, Ottawa April 20, 2002 Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada - Unknown to Canadian and American citizens during the Eisenhower administration of the early 1950s, the Project Magnet Director of Canada's Department of Transport was working intimately with the highest offices in military, intelligence and the White House in Washington, D. C. Wilbert Brockhouse Smith was an engineer who organized Project Magnet, Canada's official investigation of the “flying saucers” and the theory that their mode of propulsion utilized the magnetic fields of the earth and solar system. Not only was Wilbert Smith studying the physics of the craft, he was trying to communicate with whoever, or whatever, might be in them. That lead Wilbert Smith to try experimentation with radio signals, other technology, and even telepathy through the chaneling of an Elliot, Maine housewife named Frances Swan. As it turned out, Mrs. Swan lived only a few miles from the couple, Betty and Barney Hill, who were abducted in 1961 while driving through the White Mountains of New Hampshire. W ilbert Brockhouse Smith, born in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada in 1910 and died on December 27, 1962 of cancer. He received his M. S. in electrical engineering from the University of British Columbia and worked for Canada's Department of Transport (DOT) as a radio engineer, was the director of ionospheric measurement stations across Canada and the director of Project Magnet which studied the physics of flying discs in the 1950s. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"At the same time that Wilbert Smith was meeting with American and Canadian officials to study technology and the messages coming from the non-humans, Dwight D. Eisenhower was continuing Harry S. Truman's MJ-12 Special Studies Group on extraterrestrial vehicles and biological entities. Below is a November 4, 1953 SECRET memorandum from President Eisenhower to the Director of Central Intelligence, who in 1953 would have been Allen W. Dulles. P age 1 of two-page document received in late 2001 by Bob and Ryan Wood in their on-going investigation of MJ-12. See: http://www.majesticdocuments.com. P age 2 of November 4, 1953 Eisenhower memo to Director of Central Intelligence about MJ-12/Special Studies Project. Interview: Grant Cameron, Canadian Researcher of Wilbert Brockhouse Smith, Director of Canada's Department of Transportation and Head of Project MAGNET, Canada's Official Investigation of Unidentified Aerial Disks in the 1950s: “President Truman and Eisenhower both depended on scientist Vannevar Bush, an MJ-12 participant, to oversee the scientific retrievals and analysis of the extraterrestrial craft and entities. For the past two decades Canadian researcher Grant Cameron has been collecting documents, transcripts and other materials about Wilbert Smith's communications with Canadian and American government officials, including a link to Vannevar Bush."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"MJ-12's Vannevar Bush and Canadian Engineer, Wilbert Smith What we know about the connection between Vannevar Bush and Wilbert Smith is that Vannevar Bush was shown the concept of the geomagnetic propulsion. And we know that an article that was written by Maj. Donald Keyhoe was re-written by Wilbert Smith. Wilbert Smith disagreed with Keyhoe's conclusions about what the Canadians were doing. this article was sent for clearance with, to Dr. Bush for clearance, whether this article could be made public. As to whether they ever talked, we do know that Smith was given access to the bodies and to the craft. Now, whether that was Bush or some of Bush's people, I really don't know at this point. It was confirmed by his son and some of his inner circle people were rumoring this for years that the bodies and the craft so Wilbert would have to have been at the level of MJ-12 or Vannevar Bush or something to have been given access. This did occur outside of Washington where the bodies and craft were seen and that's where Bush was stationed, in Washington, D. C. And it could have been some place like Andrews AFB? That's what I thought. I could probably clear it up. But it was stated right outside Washington, D. C. And that story goes back, the first time I heard that was in the mid-1970s. And there's also an interesting story connected to that which sort of ties in the fact that this is all very true was a story in a book 20 years ago that Silas Newton who was one of the key people in the Frank Scully book had stated this bizarre thing that he had seen the bodies himself and he had been given clearance to see the bodies by Wilbert Smith. That's a very strange thing. And the book (Scully's) was seen as a hoax and Newton was seen as a big part of the hoax. And yet the strange thing is: why would an American claim to see the bodies and then say that some Canadian gave him access to the bodies? You would normally pick a U. S. high official if you're going to make a story up. That sort of confirms the fact that Smith did have this very high level access. And up to 1954. After 1954, he still had access to Canadian labs for running his experiments, but the Canadian Government. was getting pretty embarrassed by all the leaks that were happening inside the program and they shut it down and I don't know if his access to highly classified material was as great after 1954 was as great after 1954 as it was before when he was Director of Project MAGNET, the official project of the Canadian government. To study the aerial vehicles. To study what he called \"flying saucers.\" Wilbert Smith almost never used the word UFO. He always used the words \"flying saucers,\" \"craft\" he never got into using this bizarre word that could mean anything. He seemed to know the reality and he always referred to them what they were - flying saucers, crafts, spaceships, but never used the word UFOs. Wilbert Smith Shown Non-Human Craft and Bodies In the papers you are studying, if he was shown these bodies of some taken out of craft, what was the physical description he gave in terms of hair color and skin color, eye color and so forth? All that was told to me by his son - and this is where we get the story confirmed - that when he (Wilbert Smith) was dying, he had cancer, and he was not too happy with how he had been treated by the Canadian government. and he didn't really talk about it until just before he was dying and his son went to him and asked him some of these questions. And he said, 'This is under the Official Secrets Act, but there is nothing they can really do anymore.' And he described them as typical of the descriptions of the time: that they weren't Greys. They were small people, looked like us, but very small people. That was the only description as to hair color. It's the same sort of idea that he had when a number of times he described the aliens as people who could fit in on the street. And the only difference between the bodies he had seen and the description he gave of the aliens is that they were small people. Why do you suppose there is that discrepancy with Mrs. Swan's description of a man who was 6 feet tall? Yeah, that is a problem. Even Smith's own description that they could fit in on the street. I guess the key is that the bodies were not Greys. A number of people have interpreted there was one story going on that Mrs. Smith had described the aliens as Greys. But when we've checked, and this is from three different sources about the bodies, and it was human type,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"or humanoid. The metallurgist used the word, 'humanoid types,' like us. Different Extraterrestrial Types from 1940s to 1960s and Beyond Part of the confusion could be that Betty and Barney Hill, abducted in the White Mountains of New Hampshire in 1961, lived only a few miles from Mrs. Swan in Maine which involved some form of Greys. That may have colored public discussion. But Mrs. Swan herself described AFFA as about 6 feet all, light skinned, dark haired, dark eyed. But Wilbert Smith said his alien contacts were small, human-like people. That description reminds me of the drawing and description of Frank Kaufmann, now deceased, who said he was on a security detail at a crashed disk site in New Mexico in 1947 in which bodies were somewhat child-like. What I've always seen is a transition in ufology where you go from the Blonds - if you want to call them that, or the human types - to the Greys. That after Betty and Barney Hill are abducted, then suddenly in ufology you see the blond or brown-haired humanoid types sort of disappear from the literature and the Greys seemed to take over. To bring up an interesting point: I asked Mrs. Swan that. I had always seen that as a transition between the Blonds and the Greys, if you want to call them Blonds. And the fact that these two women lived so close together and the fact that when Mrs. Hill was abducted, NICAP even called in Mrs. Swan to talk to her. Mrs. Swan immediately said, 'I'm not talking to this woman. She's in contact with the Evil Ones. I'm in contact with the Good Ones. And I will not talk to this woman.' And now you take it 30 or 40 years ahead, now you have the predominant impression of the Greys is the evil aspect of them, where you never got that in the 1950s. They were always seen as good guys here to save us and this sort of thing. I asked Mrs. Swan this in a letter. I said that I heard a story that the Greys were trying to take over the Blonds. And she said, 'Absolutely no. They tried to take over the Blonds. And she goes into this whole reaffirmation of the fact that there are good ones and evil ones and that the Greys are trying to kill the Blonds and you have this sort of war between the aliens. And in terms of when she taught, in 1959, this Navy intelligence officer who was sent from the Director of Naval Intelligence to talk to her, she taught him how to do this. And when he wrote out the message, it was also signed in automatic writing and signed AFFA as well. But when she saw the signature, she said: 'This is not AFFA. This is one of the Evil Ones.' She told this fellow that this was not AFFA, 'you are dealing with Evil Ones, you have to stop this.' And he was so impressed by what he had done, that he was able to do this, he went running off to the CIA to a high person in the CIA and showed them how to do this. And 20 years later which is sort of confirmed by Mrs. Swan to me and is also in a number of articles, this fellow is still dealing with this AFFA he was in contact with and was literally going out of his mind. He said, 'They are here in the middle of the night. I can't get rid of them.\" They had destroyed his entire life. And when I asked Mrs Swan about whether this fellow had been in contact with her after 20 years, she said, 'Yes, and I warned him he was in contact with the Evil Ones and he wouldn't listen to me. And now, it's too late. Now, he's in trouble.' So this concept of the Blonds changing to the Greys around the time of Betty Hill and the idea of the Good and Evil Ones is sort of epitomized by these two women who lived so close to each other and who lived very close to two prominent nuclear sites: one being the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard where the second atomic submarine was berthed and developed. And Pease AFB which was a nuclear base where the Strategic Air Command (SAC), if they were going to move weapons up the coast, it would go Pease AFB and then Goose Bay, Labrador and then over across the ocean if they were going to go to Russia. So, there were these two very close nuclear connections. In fact, the Pease AFB was the one involved with the Betty Hill case, picking it up on radar and she dealt with people at Pease AFB. You have all these significant connections in this very small area along the Maine/New Hampshire border. Government Concern About “Mental Phenomenon” of the Non-Humans"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"N ovember 21, 1950 Canadian Department of Transport 2-page Intra-Departmental Correspondence originally classified TOP SECRET about Geo-Magnetics. P aragraph excerpted from second page of DOT Memo about Geo-Magnetics. Apparently a difference between the good and evil comes back again to 'mental phenomenon' that was listed in that Top Secret document. The Navy guy was being affected by what Mrs. Swan called the 'Evil Ones' who intruded upon his sleep, were in his mind, in his work and were driving him crazy. Yeah, and this was 20 years later that he came to her for help. He said, 'I can't get rid of them. They are in my sleep. I can't stop it.' He came to her in the 1970s, he came back to her for help, whether she could help him stop this from happening. Do you know what happened? How did she deal with such a situation? 'No, I just told him it was too late.' That's what she wrote to me in a letter. 'He didn't know how to quit. At last he was asking for help.' Oh, yeah, she said, 'I told him how. But I think he was too late.' But it doesn't detail what she told him to do? No. The surprising thing with Mrs. Swan. There are two things so significant with her is that she picked up these 1954 satellites which was one story. But the other was the fact that when she corresponded with me, she looked like she had a grade three education. You could barely read what she was writing. Everything was misspelled. I think one of the things that impressed people I think the CIA dealt with her for a number of years, and Naval Intelligence for a number of years, FBI, the White House, there were a whole bunch of people involved with this woman. And what sort of impressed everyone was that she was able to answer highly technical questions. For example, Arthur Lundahl who was the fellow who discovered the missiles in Cuba and who briefed Pres. Kennedy on the missiles in Cuba, was asking questions of this Navy intelligence officer through this channeling thing and they were able to answer highly technical questions: like what is the orbit of Jupiter? How many miles are we from Jupiter? Highly technical questions. So, when they went in to talk with Mrs. Swan, they would ask her these series of questions and I guess everybody was just sort of taken aback that she could answer mathematical and astronomical questions that were way beyond her ability to comprehend. This was one of the reasons why they were so interested in the fact that this woman actually was talking to aliens."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The interpretation might be that AFFA was somewhere either invisible in the room or a craft and could telepathically place this information in her mind? Yes. Some people called it sort of sound off/sound on device. There were a number of descriptions of this, but it was basically coming some how telepathically to her and as opposed to Wilbert Smith who used other techniques like radios, which is his expertise trying to draw up a system there. But this was a basic, simple, almost like a medium type of thing. Mrs. Swan Knows About Mysterious Satellites of Unknown Origin Can you please explain what happened about Mrs. Swan telling our government about satellites of unknown origin orbiting this planet? OK, what happened is that in late 1953, the U. S. Air Force with their experimental long range radar picked up two objects circling the earth: one was at 400 miles out; one was 600 miles out. And it sent the Pentagon into a state of panic that these huge objects were going around the earth. They set up a number of stations to try to monitor this. And spent a lot of money on it. They went all the way through 1954, they were tracking these objects until Aviation Week and Space Technology broke the story that they (U. S. govt.) was actually monitoring these objects. And Mrs. Swan's connection was as I stated before: in the fall of 1953 and the Halloween party, she started this contact with this AFFA. And in April 1954, she started getting the messages. And in May 1954, Admiral Knowles who lived close to both Betty and Barney Hill and Mrs. Swan was approached by Mrs. Swan saying, 'I'm getting these messages.' He started sending letters to the various agencies. He sent one to the Senator in Maine. He sent one to the White House. He sent one to Naval Intelligence. And what he detailed in the letter is that this woman was talking to two commanders of alien spacecraft that were circling the earth,. So, the Americans became very interested, all the various agencies, in the fact that this woman was talking to two spacecraft going around the earth which was still secret. It was not open until August 1954 when Aviation Week and Space Technology broke the story. Even then in 1954, our government knew there was something orbiting the earth on radar, origin unknown? The Air Force was tracking them. They had White Sands Missile Range tracking them, trying to photograph these objects. They had a station outside Berlin, Germany trying to track and photograph these objects. they were doing everything in their power to figure out what these objects were. The implication was even in Donald Keyhoe's books that they had suddenly picked up extraterrestrial satellites or probes orbiting our planet. Yeah. And they knew they weren't, one of the stories put out when the story broke (in Aviation Week) was that they were probably just natural asteroids or satellites that had been picked up by the earth's natural magnetic field. But Keyhoe's Air Force sources were stating that these things were not in orbit all the time. They would lose them. They couldn't track them for very long, they would leave orbit. That would naturally indicate they were not natural asteroids captured by the earth's magnetic field. They knew right from the word go that these were some sort of craft and it tied in with the fact that Mars was approaching and UFO sightings always went up as they did in the 1952 flap which was at the closest approach of Mars. So, there was this panic going on. Then you get this woman out of Maine who suddenly is talking to two commanders flying giant spacecraft around the earth and they immediately they figure this woman is talking to whoever is flying these two objects we have picked up. And I think that is one of the key reasons that the CIA and Naval Intelligence and the White House and all these different people were so extremely interested in what this woman was saying (Mrs. Swan). Because they knew that she was describing what they had classified as one of the highest secrets in the government. Yes. And there were a lot of tie ins. She seemed to know a lot of things that hadn't been made public yet. And I guess they went there to find out why she had this information or how she was getting the information."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Did Mrs. Swan say specifically what these objects were? She described them as spacecraft. One she identified as M-4 which was commanded by AFFA, which is the same alien that was in contact with Wilbert Smith who was getting different messages from. And George Hunt Williamson, a famous contactee in the 1950s was in contact with AFFA. The other spaceship was known as L-11 and it was commanded, according to Mrs. Swan, by an alien by the name of Ponar. And she described them as, I'm not certain of the exact size, but it was 150 miles across, just huge objects. And later in the 1950s, she described them as moving out to behind the moon. When Smith described in some of his correspondence that the base, AFFA's base, was on the moon. On the back side of the moon. I don't know if they described the front or the back side, but he said there was a base on the moon, that's where AFFA was basing his earth operations out of. Now, what happened to the satellites, we really don't know. Whether they were able to cover it all up - we had stories, for example, that these huge objects were coming down over Washington. This was according to Major Keyhoe. And right over the Pentagon where they were tracking these objects and there was nothing they could do. The objects were up, the big object was up at 90,000 feet, and they scrambled the jets and they just flew around in circles underneath it and it was flying back and forth between Baltimore and Washington and they were able to cover up sightings on the 5th, 6th and 13th of May and on June the 10th, the object came back at 79,000 feet. They couldn't, the Nike missiles couldn't reach that high. The planes couldn't get there. And there was a lot of panic in 1954 over these satellites. There were numerous - Dorothy Kilgallen, the famous columnist, had written in February of 1954 that her sources were telling her that the situation with the flying saucers had become so serious that they were going to gather all the world military leaders together in the summer of 1954 to discuss the problem. Most people have interpreted that as flying saucer sightings. But it doesn't make much sense that you would gather all the world military leaders to discuss flying saucer sightings and it indicated it might have to do with those two satellites. Extraterrestrial Agendas On Earth What did the humanoid aliens tell Wilbert Smith and Mrs. Swan about what they were doing with satellites and craft flying aro und the planet? They were basically the same content of messages that all the 1950s contacts had and it dealt very much with the fact that we are messing up the environment with atomic bombs. For example, they had an alien called Tyla who I was told was an alien called the 'garbage collector.' He was flying around and mopping up radioactive fallout from the tests that were being done by the Americans and Russians. How would they do that? It was never described. But I was told the person who was in contact with the alien and the fact that this alien would be seen flying around - I think Smith in one of his letters refers to the fact that this Tyla is flying around and cleaning up. And there was one interesting story - for example, it was told to me by one of the people who ran one of the big UFO groups. He told me he had talked to Smith and one of the messages that AFFA had given him was this idea of non-intervention. They would only step in if things actually got out of control. Otherwise, we were here to learn our own lessons and things will go the way they go. We have to learn on our own and they can't come here and do our homework for us. And what they had said was: if there was going to be a nuclear exchange - this is what AFFA told Smith - they would step in. And if the world didn't believe they could do it, AFFA would take the moon, split the moon in half in front of the entire world, and put it back together in microseconds to prove they could stop a nuclear exchange. That was basically almost the entire message that Smith had from the aliens - the atomic bomb tests had to stop and that we were on the verge of not only destroying our world, but the harmony of the entire universe. It centered around the atomic thing - that they were here to monitor and control this. For example, AFFA on a number of occasions is described as being in the Pacific fixing faults. The fault lines had become unstable due to the fact that we were doing all this atomic testing. The interesting thing about that is it's plate tectonics, that at that time, people did not know there were fault lines on the ocean floor and one of the people who developed the theory of plate tectonics was a fellow by the name of Dr. Tuzo Wilson who later was"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"the President of the Univ. of Toronto in Canada who was described by Major Keyhoe as one of Wilbert Smith's associates on this Project MAGNET, which was the official Canadian project that Smith was running. We tried to talk to him (Dr. Wilson). He refused to talk to us or be interviewed and it's very strange that you have AFFA described on a number of occasions being in the Pacific fixing these fault lines. And you have Tyla flying around cleaning up the radiation. And they are basically here just sort of keeping things stable and trying to talk to people about the fact that we've got to stop going down this nuclear road. Did you ever ask Mrs. Swan about different alien types and what their different agendas might be? I asked her that a number of times because I was always interested in this transition of ufology between the Good Ones and Evil Ones, the Blonds and the Greys, or whatever you want to call them. I asked her, 'What is the difference between the Blonds and the Greys?' And I hoped she would go into the whole rendition of what each is doing and all she said was: 'It's very simple. The good ones work for God and the bad ones work for the Devil. Read your Bible.' So she would never elaborate on that. A number of times she said, 'You really don't understand what is going on, do you?' She would make little comments. I only had two letters and she made a number of comments in those two letters. She would send my original letter back and just sort of write stuff in the margins. But she was very Biblical in the way she looked at this sort of stuff. I don't think the people like the Naval Intelligence and CIA and those people looked at it in Biblical senses. They were after very hard technical data they were trying to get out of her. And she even described, 'Everyone was in this for their own thing. All Wilbert ever asked me about was how they flew. And everyone had their own little interest. And my friends wanted me to ask AFFA questions.' To her, it was very annoying, all these different people coming with different things they wanted AFFA to answer. Her impression was very simple: they were here to save us and these Greys came along and tried to take over the Blonds and knew right from the word go when she was asked to talk with Betty Hill that these were evil little people and she wasn't going to have anything to do with them and they came from the Devil. That was her impression. Did you ever ask her whether there was any truth to our government having an alliance with greys, working elbow to elbow with them on technology in laboratories? No, she would never go into that. The only question I asked her about the government, and this came from some for the articles that were done in the late 1970s in the interviews that people had done with her - I asked her about a story that had gone around that she had an alliance with the government, that she had agreed with the government. to cooperate in her study of her. I asked her if that were true and she said, 'Yes, there was an agreement to be still,' is the word I think she used. An agreement to be still. She didn't elaborate on it. She just confirmed that she had been working with the government. as they studied her. Implying the U. S. government asked Mrs. Swan not to talk with anyone. Exactly. That was the story and that was the question I put to her, that the story was going out that she had been told to keep quiet and they were talking to her and she confirmed that. That was true. President Dwight D. Eisenhower - Meetings In Oval Office About Extraterrestrial Presence Any direct links to President Eisenhower? The one very interesting story I worked on was the involvement of Pres. Eisenhower in the whole affair. One of the people that Vice Admiral Knowles sent a letter to was the President of the United States. When I was at the Eisenhower Library in 2000 I went there and I was looking for this letter. I was given the transfer sheet of the letter that was sent and the letter dealt with Mrs. Swan and the fact that she was talking to these two objects moving around the earth. And there were some of the actual messages, the automatic writing that were attached to this letter, which is mostly what I wanted to see since I knew what the story was. I was given a transfer sheet that showed the letter had been transferred after a month. It had been held in the White House for a month and then transferred to the Secret Service. There was a dispute with the Eisenhower Library about getting this transfer sheet, whether I should have been told it existed and all this kind of stuff. But, anyway, when I tracked another fellow who had been interviewed at the time of the satellites, a Capt. Orville, who"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"was - he had a post under Eisenhower - I came across a meeting that had taken place on June 10, 1954 in the Oval Office. The fellow, this Orville, it was the only time he had any contact with the President at all. And this is now, they held this letter for a month, and I asked the Asst. Director of the Eisenhower Library if this was standard policy. Because he was giving me the story that, 'Well, the reason this letter is probably transferred to the Secret Service was they considered the person crazy or a threat to the president.' I said if the person was crazy, they would have transferred it in the first hour and if the person is crazy, why would you hold the letter for a month? He agreed with me that this was not standard White House policy to hold a letter for a month. And it all lead to this meeting at 11:15 a.m. on June 10, 1954 where this Orville was in the office. He had never written the president, he had never talked to the president on the phone. He had one contact and that was one meeting in the Oval Office. And his connection is that he had done a big interview about the satellites and basically confirmed that the government. was probably covering this up and this was probably realistic to say these were not natural objects rotating around the earth. The other two people who turned out to be in the meeting were Donald Quarles who is the guy who was in charge of the Air Force Research and Development when they discovered these two satellites and was an expert on satellites and had briefed the National Security Council on satellites. The other person was Alan Waterman who was a National Science Foundation expert on satellites and you had all these experts on satellites in the Oval Office on exactly the same day that they transferred this letter after holding it for a month. So, it seemed to indicate that even the White House took this whole Swan thing seriously. We're still working on that, trying to recover the letter and trying to get any other documentation we can about what happened in this Oval Office meeting. But to me it was a significant point that the White House even took interest in this woman who was just basically a housewife in Elliot, Maine who just one day started getting messages. The next thing you know, there were probably 8 U. S. agencies who were watching this woman and studying her and dealing with her and some very high ranking people. For example, the head of Naval Intelligence; J. Edgar Hoover, Head of FBI; the President of the U. S.; Arthur Lundahl who was the guy who ran the most highly classified lab in the country that analyzed all the U-2 photographs for the CIA; very high ranking people were dealing with this woman, not just low level people in different agencies. Dwight D. Eisenhower was obviously getting briefings about her. It would appear that he would have gotten a briefing, especially at that time. What they did with it? We know for example in the late 1940s a fellow named Stewart Alsop who was a syndicated columnist had written a story about the two satellites. And he had stated that high ranking sources that he had inside the government and inside the National Security Council had confirmed to him that these objects were not natural objects and the government was watching them. And shortly after that, a week or two later, he wrote another article that said Robert Cutler who was the Secretary at the National Security Council who was Pres. Eisenhower's National Security advisor, was so angry at the fact that the story about these two objects rotating the earth was leaking out and the fact they were not natural objects, that the people who worked with him according to Stewart Alsop, the syndicated columnist, stated that he had been told the people who worked with him were afraid to be seen with him. He was so angry. I recovered a letter at one time - Robert Cutler was fanatical about security. It was his key thing he worked on, secrecy and security. And so you have a situation where the story is leaking and they are desperately trying to stop it. Through Bob and Ryan Wood's efforts, we now have documents with a Dwight D. Eisenhower signature space talking about MJ-12 and implications of great concern that the technology and the intelligence behind it could be a national security threat. Right. The more you look, you can find a reference that it was considered a severe threat, that this could be an invasion. Like when they picked up the first satellites, they were big. If you take a look at the military mind, they would say, 'Well, this isn't exactly an alien and his wife and kids on a holiday. This is a big object. This is like they are bringing the 8th Army with them.' So, the military mind would see an invasion, the same as we see now - the possible invasion of terrorism. Everything you have to do that you can to try to stop this. Someone is coming, they are trying to attack us. And that's the way it appeared in the 1950s these things were seen, especially as it related to these huge objects rotating around the earth. High Strangeness of Non-Human"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Technology and Entities Is there anything in Wilbert Smith's letters that indicate he was especially shocked or stunned by any of the alien artifacts he studied? In his description of the whole thing, he said it was basically like looking through a keyhole into another world and then having to try to describe it. But his description was that this stuff is so far beyond anything that we have. For example, he talked about crashed hardware and he said 'it might as well be in the 4th Dimension for what it's worth.' It was sort of like somebody a thousand years ago finding a 747. He said it was just so far advanced that we are not even close to understanding this and that's where he made the description that it might as well be in the 4th Dimension for what it's worth.' That was sort of the point about how he got to talking with the aliens, there was this sort of brick wall. Even though they had the metal, the craft, the bodies, they were really at a brick wall. It really wasn't leading them anywhere or answering a lot of questions these people had. In other words, if you have a lot of physical evidence that is incomprehensible where does it get you if you can't dial up the non-humans that made the technology? If you can't have a two-way dialogue, you don't know where they are from and you don't know why they are here, even if you have lots of their incomprehensible craft and bodies. Exactly. As I have always described it as all it basically does is confirm the reality of the phenomenon. Beyond that, it, for example, we talked to a Dr. Eric Walker who was a very high level government official for about eight years. And that's what he told us: 'Leave it alone. There is nothing you can do about it. You are up against windmills. Study something else. Leave it alone. There is nothing you can do with it.\" And I never understood that until I correlated it with what Wilbert Smith was saying which was the fact that he had established the reality of the phenomenon, he had seen the craft and bodies, and yet he said at one point, 'Unless you have the mind of Einstein, you are not going to get anywhere with this stuff. It's that far advanced.' You can have a dead alien body, but a dead alien doesn't talk. A live one does. In order to understand the phenomenon of abductions, why they are abducting, in order to negotiate with them to stop abductions or whatever we want to do, or to find out why they are, you have to deal with someone who is talking. And Smith realized that very early on, around 1952 probably when the contact stuff started, he realized very early on that he was at a brick wall and you had to go to the next level which was trying to make some sort of communication with the phenomenon. And get the next level of answers that they sought. And at one point, he said, 'It was a good thing we didn't develop the technology because he said all we would use it for was to find a bigger and better way to drop bombs.' When he died he was somewhat frustrated that he never found the answer, but he was happy in one way that the world wasn't ready. For example, he had an anti-gravity experiment he was working on. When he finally decided the government was going to try to steal it, he came home and his wife told me that he took it apart and never said another thing about it until the day he died, and all he said was: 'The world is not ready for this yet.' We're at 2002 and I guess the world is still not ready. Yes, especially when you see what's going on in the Middle East today.” More Information: Wilbert Smith Quotes from Grant Cameron's Research Aliens and Agendas \"It is my opinion that the people from outside are so much like us that they could mingle with us and we would be none the wiser.\" (Milne letter 1957) \"My own contacts as yet have been entirely indirect, and I would like to meet these people face to face.

They know of Alan (Dan Fry's alien), but they are not directly associated with him. Apparently, the time for us is very short and there are several groups who have an interest in the outcome. Most of them are friendly, but there is at least one group that is bent on exploitation. These later have a base near North Bay.\" (Gesner letter 1955) \"I also have had experience with these folks' ability to project mental pictures etc. I have been shown quite a few of their machine elements. Television, cloth etc, as well as some of their manufacturing methods. I must say that in general they are much simpler, more direct and ever so much more efficient than ours. It all stems from a better knowledge of physics, which we just kid ourselves that we have and don't. I am naturally itching to make up some of the things, but I am told to have patience, that the time is not yet right.\" (Gesner letter 1955) Communication \"Some time ago we tried radio contact with the saucer people on 19,940 kc, but without much luck.

But expect to do shortly. I am in charge of all the monitoring services in Canada, so it shouldn't be too hard to get some of the boys to have a listen.\"(Letter to David 1955) \"With regard to direct communication, I can only comment that we on earth do not call the tune; we only dance when they call it. I know of no way in which direct communication can be established from this end. If they want to talk to you, they will arrange it.\" (Castator letter 1956) \"I am afraid that you are assuming that I have a great deal more drag with the space people than I actually have. While they are quite frank with me up to a point, I find that I can not get them to alter their plans one tiny bit. I have tried to coax them into making a landing in my presence, but with no success. They tell me 'All in due time.' Although I have talked to them and they have shown me diagrams and pictures, we have never met face to face. I know what several of them look like and I think I would recognize them if we met, but they steadfastly refuse to be pushed.\" (Gesner letter 1955) \"I think you might be a bit hasty in dismissing 'telepathic' communication with these people from elsewhere, since I know that the system they use does resemble telepathy to some extent, but it is actually electrical, even though they have cut out most of the intervening equipment such as microphones, earphones, vocal cords etc. I have generated this energy in the lab, but I am not smart enough to do anything with it.

I have spent too many hours conversing with people from elsewhere to have any doubts about their reality; they are what they claim to be.

AFFA says that it is one of his ships and it is possible that the British may eventually have gotten their hands on it. I think there are several of them in earth people's hands, but I am afraid that they won't learn much about them from inspection; about as much as a Hotentot would learn about one of our aircraft.

Taking these factors into account, it is difficult to reconcile this performance with the capabilities of our technology, and unless the technology of some terrestrial nation is much more advanced than is generally known, we are forced to the conclusion that the vehicles are probably extra-terrestrial, in spite of our prejudices to the contrary\" \"From the weight of the evidence, I think they come from outer space, but I can't prove it. The best I have is data on which you can put a probability figure - look at it this way, if a stock promoter told you that there was a 60 per cent probability that a certain stock would go up, I don't think you would invest with him. But if the weatherman told you there was a 60 per cent probability that a hurricane was going to hit your area, I think you'd hurry up and bring in the lawn furniture. It's a question of viewpoint. You have to make up your own mind how significant you think the matter is.\" Flying Saucer Observatory \"The deflection in the line (drawn by an electronically operated pen) was greater and more pronounced than we have seen even when a large aircraft has passed overhead. I ran outside to see what might be in the sky. The overcast was down to a thousand feet, so that whatever it was that caused the sharp variation was concealed behind the clouds. We must now ask ourselves what it could have been?\" (Detection made August 1954 two days before Project Magnet closed.) \"For your information we are placing in operation an observation post near the DRB (Research Board) establishment at Shirleys Bay for the purpose of getting measurements on the various reported factors, should we be fortunate to have one of the 'objects' pass near. The equipment will detect and measure simultaneously gamma radiation, radio noise, magnetic variations, and gravity variations. It will also trigger the ionospheric recorder and get a trace of anything that happens to be overhead. According to the past statistics, we should be pretty sure of a sighting here within a year.\" (Letter to military liaison in Washington 1953) \"We closed down the saucer station because it had served its purpose and was contributing nothing that we did not already know or could find out from other sources. Also, it was the focus of public attention which we feel is undesirable at the present time. The instruments are still intact and available if we get any bright ideas.\" (Gesner letter 1954) Government Cover-up \"You ask why there is no official story about the reality of the saucers. I think it is a combination of circumstances, the most important one being that it is not in the present sequence that we should be told.\" (Trench letter 1959) \"For your information EVERY nation on this planet has been officially informed of the existence of the space crafts and their occupants from elsewhere, and as nations they must accept responsibility for any lack of action or any official position which they may take.

Substances such as 'angel hair' and molten tin, etc. have been observed to drop from these craft, and have been gathered and analyzed. Strong magnetic disturbances have been observed in the vicinity of these craft. In fact, I would say that many more people have more evidence supporting the reality of the flying saucers than for the reality of atom bombs. But atom bombs bear the stamp of official disclosure.\" (Article Sputniks, Saucers, and Spacecraft ) \"You seem to be most interested in UFO 'hardware.' There is a great deal of this around, most of it in US official hands (NOT USAF!), but there is quite a bit in private hands as well.\" Project Magnet \"Unfortunately, the Canadian program is classified at the moment and I am therefore not in position to pass along to you much of the information which comes to hand. I can assure you however, that sightings in Canada are subject to pretty rigorous investigation, and it is hoped that the results may someday be made public. (Letter to Civilian Saucer Investigation 1952) \"As you may have heard the Government decided to drop further official investigation of the flying saucer phenomena, but I am carrying on with the work as a purely private project.

Once the step is taken there can be no return, and we have before us the horrible example of Atomic Energy.\" (To Fry 1961) \"I am very amused at your attempts to get my Project Magnet report.
