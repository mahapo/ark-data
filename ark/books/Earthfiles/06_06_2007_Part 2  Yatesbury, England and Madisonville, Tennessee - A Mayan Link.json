Return to Part 1: Yatesbury Spiral - Viewer Comments on Spiral Math June 6, 2007 Yatesbury Field, Wiltshire, England - Two crop formations an ocean apart - one in English barley near the ancient and sacred ground of Avebury Trusloe on Yatesbury Field; the other in a Madisonville, Tennessee, wheat field not far from the historic Cherokee Indian capital of Chota and even more ancient 9,500-year-old Icehouse Bottom. (See Part 3: Madisonville Circles .) The English pattern has fifty-seven circles threaded on a thin, 4-inch-diameter spiral. The Tennessee pattern has nine circles with a triangular \"pointer\" in the middle standing circle that aims west in the opposite direction from Chota.

One Earthfiles viewer, Mark, who studies Mayan glyphs and calendars, sent me the following comments/images concerning the Yatesbury, England, spiral and the Madisonville, Tennessee, 9-fold geometry of circles. From: Mark Date: June 4, 2007 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com \"Regarding the Yatesbury Spiral Crop Circle, there are 57 circles. If the spiral (gaps) were filled in, there would be 87 circles. \"If the spiral is counted both inward and outward then 87 + 87 = 174 and k’in 174 in the Mayan calendar is '5 Ix.' 5 Ix Mayan calendar glyph. On day '4 Ix,' according to the Mayan Chilam Balam book, the 'sky and earth tilted' when our present age began. Thus, this crop circle’s '5 Ix' number 174 would relate to the birth of the next age called the Fifth World by the Hopi or the Sixth Sun by the Aztec. \"The '5 Ix' is another portal on Pakal's tomb lid (see images below) at Palenque, which is related to the portal images I emailed you concerning the other '9 circles' in Madisonville, Tennessee, crop circle. That 'completion portal' is positioned on the tomb lid as day 134 - '4 Ix' on which the Chilam Balam book states the 'sky and earth tilted.' The portal glyph for Pakal tomb lid at Palenque this symbol relates to the beginning and end of our cycle.

[ Editor's Note - From Confessions of an Economic Hit Man by John Perkins: “'The Prophecy of the Condor and Eagle' ... back in the mists of history, human societies divided and took different paths: that of the condor (representing the heart, intuitive and mystical) and that of the eagle (representing the brain, rational and material). In the 1490s, the prophesy said, the two paths would converge and the eagle would drive the condor to the verge of extinction. Then, five hundred years later, in the 1990's, a new epoch would begin, one in which the condor and the eagle will have the opportunity to reunite and fly together in the same sky, along the same path. If the condor and eagle accept this opportunity, they will create a most remarkable offspring, unlike any seen before. “The Prophecy of the Condor and Eagle' can be taken at many levels — the standard interpretation is that it foretells the sharing of indigenous knowledge with the technologies of science, the balancing of yin and yang, and the bridging of northern and southern cultures. However, most powerful is the message it offers about consciousness; it says the we have entered a time when we can benefit from the many diverse was of seeing ourselves and the world, and that we can use these as a springboard to higher levels of awareness. As human beings we can truly wake up and evolve into a more conscious species.\"] From: Mark Date: June 3, 2007 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com Attached are: 1. harmony.gif This is an image of the Harmony/Hunab Ku glyph from the Sixth Sun Tzolk'in. 2. pacal-completion-portal.jpg 3. crop-circle-4-flower.jpg A vebury Manor, near Avebury, Wiltshire, reported July 27, 2005. \"This 2005 English crop circle has a relationship to the 9-circle crop circle in Madisonville, Tennessee, in a fractal geometric way.
