S., Microwave TechnicianUpdated with Earthfiles viewerbluemobluemooncomments: February 14, 2006 \"I'm writing to inform you that I, too, have seen these lights in the sky here inBlythe, CA northeast of Brawley, CA. I've seen lights like these before, but not thatoften. There is a bombing range between Blythe and Brawley and you can see lightsover that area from time to time. I use to make a big deal out of them, but mostpeople I talk to about them don't seem to care. But, I'm happy to see them reportedon your website.\" February 15, 2006 \"I read your post at Earthfiles about the beams seen in the skies over CA. As well, Iheard you on a past recording of Dreamland. The man interviewed said the beamswere descending towards the Chocolate Mountain area, and he pinpointed an area atthe gunnery range. ...Beams shot up can sometimes appear to be shooting down andthat's what may have been seen. It might be a test of a secret gov. weapon known asa Rail-Gun. If the bars of light were truly descending, it might mean the Rail-Gun isnow in space, or on a high altitude jet like the Aurora, fitted with a test version of aRail-Gun.\" February 15, 2006 \"I am wondering if what the individual saw in this instance was fire from an AC-130Spectre gunship, possibly in a training exercise or conducting some sort of live fireexercise in the desert. Twentynine Palms Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Centeris to the north of Brawley. AC-130s usually operate at night. \"If it was not a joint USAF-USMC air-ground exercise, then I have no idea what anAC-130 would be doing firing at the ground near Brawley. The use of this aircraftfor a Drug Interdiction mission would seem rather extraordinary. I also thoughtabout test firing of the Airborne Laser System, yet normally when it is fired, there isa solid shaft of light and not a series of energy \"bolts\" or \"bars\" as with thedescription from Brawley. This is a very interesting mystery.\"Airborne Laser Logo for D.O.D.'s Star Wars Space Policy Project.See website below. February 13, 2006 - On February 8, 2006, I received the following e-mail from amicrowave technician driving around 11 p.m. Pacific time on February 7, when he sawhuge, disconnected bars of light suddenly appear moving downward at an angle in the dark"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"sky lasting for about half a minute. He contacted Earthfiles to ask what the mysterious,aerial bars of light might be. If any Earthfiles viewers have any more information, or haveseen any comparable bars of light, please contact: earthfiles@earthfiles.com E-mail February 8, 2006 From M. S., near Brawley, California:\"I have listened to you a number of time on C2C radio and know of yourinterest in UFOs. I am currently in the southern CA and Yuma, AZ areaworking at RF tower sites doing microwave work. Yesterday night(2/7/06) at around 11 p.m. AZ time, I was driving to a tower site in themountains of southeastern CA and saw something that I have never seenbefore. I estimated from my DeLorme Street Atlas map that a largemilitary installation was around 10 to 12 miles away from my vehicleand directly in front of me at the time on the road I was travelingon. It was totally dark outside of course due to the late hour.Suddenly, there was what appeared to be several huge - and I meanreally huge - fluorescent white beams of light that were all of thesame length and spaced evenly apart, coming down at about a 225degree angle (0 being straight up), in other words, at a downwardangle toward the left halfway between straight down and horizontal.The fixed length beams of bright white light appeared to come out ofthe black sky, probably from at least a couple of thousandfeet in the atmosphere, and at a reasonably slow pace made their wayto the ground. There are mountains or hills in the way so I could notsee the ground or destination where the light beams were directed.Illustration of disconnected, huge, aerial light bars superimposed on photo of actual locationnorthof Brawley, California, on February 7, 2006, seen around 11 p.m. Pacific time. Image © 2006by M. S. for Earthfiles.\"The lights reminded me of the Luxor in Las Vegas, only the thickness,length and brightness of the Luxor lights is a pittance compared towhat I saw. There were only about 7 or 8 of these light beams,lasting a total of about 20 to 30 seconds and then they stopped.After contemplating the lights and their slow downward \"slide\" theyappeared to be some kind of guiding lights. I just know they wereabsolutely huge, thick and bright and were most certainly atechnological phenomena, not a natural one. The size of these lightsand the distance they traveled, as if down a tight cable, easilydwarfed the size of 500 to 1000 foot communications towers. And ifthe lights were closer to 20 miles away, nearer to the center of themilitary installation, they would definitely have had to be the sizeof a mountain.\"I could see nothing else due to the darkness, except that within oneminute there was a yellowish light just off to the west of where the\"fluorescent lights\" were that came on and went off a couple of times.It too must have been 2000 or more feet above the ground. I thoughtit might be some kind of flare light, except that it did not move inany trajectory. It appeared to be still. It was not a typical FAAtower light. It lit up in an isotropic pattern and was not white orred, but yellowish orange. Another tech I met at the site had seenthe yellowish orange light before, but not the white tubular beams.\"Do you have any idea what I might have seen? Or do you think this is"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"some type of technology that the public has not been told about.\"Location of aerial beams of light specified on map as \"lights\" at southeastern part of ChocolateMountain Aerial Gunnery Range north of Brawley, California and northwest of Yuma, Arizona.Map © 2006 by M. S. for Earthfiles.E-mail February 9, 2006\"Hi Linda,\"I decided to drive back to the area where I saw the lights and take apicture from the highway tonight. I took the attached picture at duskand using Paint I then drew in the lines of light where I rememberseeing them. This is as good as my visual memory allows right now.The only difference is that it was at 11:00 PM at night and thereforequite dark, though there was a partial moon in the mostly clear skythat night, but not within the pictured area.\"After looking at the area tonight from the road and remembering thenotch in the mountain to the left of where the lights came down Ifound that the location on the road where I saw the lights from wasprobably a few miles north from where I had indicated on the mapsthat I sent you. In either case, the lights were beaming from, or to,an unknown location behind the mountains quite a few miles away frommy vehicle, and as you can see they \"originated\" quite high in thesky where they then descended from toward the ground in the straightline direction of the lights while maintaining their even spacing.Since these mountains are north of California SR78 going east/west, itappears to be something that the military installation, Chocolate MountainAerial Gunnery Range (CMAGR) is working on.\"The lights were not green or blueargon laser beams like those I have seen in Hawaii, but were all verybright white. No objects could be seen at or near the lights, justthe light beams. They probably don't mind civilians seeing the lightsonce in a while, because the technology is hidden anyway by themountains and the darkness. You would think that if they minded theywould go further north and not beam them so high that everyone in thearea could see them. There is the Border Patrol station to the easton SR78 and if I stop my vehicle within 10 miles of it (at night withmy headlights on) to look at a map or something, they will show up tocheck me out within a couple of minutes. I wonder if the BorderPatrol employees have been briefed about the lights. A tech I workedwith said a Blackhawk helicopter buzzed him once on the road to thetower site near there, then landed and troops got out in some kind of exercise.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Original sketch for Earthfiles by M.
