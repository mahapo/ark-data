Stringfield.THE INCREDIBLE THINGSHere, like potluck, are hundreds of reports which describe \"incredible things\" falling,landing or being propelled to earth. Included are all the sundry fireball phenomena which,to put it bluntly, are either meteorites or ranging missiles and an assortment ofnondescripts, like the metallic object investigated by the Navy in the marshes of OssabowIsland; or the fragments of the \"harmless-looking green object\" which exploded when itwas kicked by Guy Scott near Ft. Jackson, South Carolina, causing serious injury andwhich, according to doctors, caused the injured parts to give off sparks. Perhaps the oddestof the incredible things is the incident reported by Air Force veteran W. B. Brown ofCharlotte, North Carolina, on March 20, 1957. Brown, accompanied by his wife, describedfive \"strange floating, foam-like objects\" in the sky, one which veered away from theothers and hit the ground about 60 feet away. Brown said it looked like \"ice-breaking up,\"but that it was liquid - \"slimy\" to the touch and \"cooling or numbing\" to his fingertips. Thesmell was like burned matches. Brown, who told his story to the Weather Bureau,commented: \"It beats anything I've ever seen.\"In many respects, the Charlotte incident reminds me of another incident that occurred onSeptember 30, 1950, near Philadelphia. In brief, the tory tells of a glowing purple sphere,about six feet in diameter, which settled on a field so lightly that it did not even bend thegrass. Touched by one of the policemen who saw it fall, it began to deteriorate. The officersaid, \"I touched it and it just dissolved, leaving my fingers sticky.\" The object had no odoror substance and completely disappeared within half an hour."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Following is a supplementary list of \"incredible\" incidents, in which are described \"space-to-earth\" objects, and/or their effects. The list is not a comprehensive one for the periodspecified. Excluded are the Fortean falls of fish, lizards and ice, like the 50-pound chunkwhich nearly hit a farmer in Bernsville, Pennsylvania, July 30, 1957, and a still largerchunk of 150 pounds which plunged from the sky, striking the roof of a house in Chester,Pennsylvania, September 8, 1957. That caused residents to flee in terror. While I do notdismiss such \"incredibilities\" as being ufological, astronomer M. K. Jessup has more ablypursued this phase and applied it to theory in his series of saucer books.I cannot vouch for the authenticity of any one of the cases below. However, as the sayinggoes, where there is smoke, there is fire - as has been described in many cases.No less numerous or sensational in this category are the foreign reports. One datelined RioDe Janeiro, Brazil, September 20, 1956, told of mysterious balls of fire soaring over adesolate area in the state of Paraiba, terrifying the populace into flight. Said geologist JoelDantas, returning from an inspection, \"the whole region is highly radioactive. It is bathedin unnatural heat, and the air seems filled with the steam of alcohol.\" Dantas also reportedthat the earth there is covered with crystallized ash that cannot be explained. 1952 Disc Crash in Spitsbergen, Norway"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Spitsbergen, Svalbard Island, Norway, near Arctic.Another \"landing\" report of world-wide significance, but apparently smothered, wasrecounted from the September 5, 1955, issue of Stuttgarter Tageblatt by the Dutchpublication UFO-GIDS as follows:\"OSLO, NORWAY, September 4, 1955 - Only now a board of inquiry of theNorwegian General Staff is preparing a publication of the report on theexamination of the remains of a U. F. O. crashed near Spitzbergen,presumably early in 1952. Chairman of the Board, Colonel Gernod Darnbyl,during an instruction lesson for Air Force Officers, stated: 'The crashing of theSpitzbergen disc was highly important. Although our present scientificknowledge does not yet enable us to solve all riddles, I am confident thatthese remains from Spitzbergen will prove to be of utmost importance in thisrespect. Some time ago, a misunderstanding was caused by saying that thedisc probably was of Soviet origin. It has - this we wish to state emphatically -not been built in any country on earth.\"The materials used in its construction are completely unknown to all expertshaving participated in the investigation. According to Colonel Darnbyl, theboard of inquiry is, however, not going to publish an extensive report until'some sensational facts have been discussed with U. S. and British experts.We should reveal what we found out, as misplaced secrecy might well lead topanic.'\"Contrary to information from American and other sources, SecondLieutenants Brobs and Tyllensen, who have been assigned as specialobservers of the Arctic regions since the event at Spitzbergen, claim thatflying discs have already landed in the polar regions several times. Said Lt.Tyllensen: 'I think that the Arctic is serving as a kind of air base for the UFOunknowns, especially during snow storms when we are being forced back toour bases. Shortly after such adverse weather conditions, I have seen themland and take off on three separate occasions. I noticed then that after havinglanded, they execute a speedy rotation around their discs. A brilliant glow oflight, the intensity of which is variable with regard to speed and at landing andtake-off, prevents any view of the things happening behind this curtain of lightand on, or inside, the disc itself.'\" Pear-Shaped Craft, Red Spray and Microwaves?Back home, and as incredible as any of the freak fireballs and just as disturbing, was thegrotesquerie involving a man, a peach tree, a red spray and a pear-shaped UFO with a fin.The incident occurred over Sycamore Hill, a high point near the heart of Cincinnati, July22, 1955. The principal was Edward Mootz, a benign and non-publicity-minded man whospent much of his spare time beautifying his fabulous garden which was terraced into thehillside.One evening about 6 p.m., Mootz, alone, was tending the soil around a fruit-budding peachtree. Suddenly, from out of nowhere, Mootz was splashed by a liquid red spray, thatlooked like cream soda. His arms bared, but perspiring, were covered with the substance;also the nape of his neck. A billed cap prevented it hitting his face. Looking up, he spotteda strange object passing over heading toward Eden Park. Guessing its height to be morethan 500 feet, Mootz described the object a a pear standing on end, bulbous side upward,with a metallic fin appended to the rear. The object's colors were vivid: red and green,divided at the midsection. No sound was heard."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"For comparison, the August 1957 issue of APRG REPORTER reported a sighting of July 9,1957, in Galveston, Texas in which Mrs. A. D. Suderman and her neighbor watched anobject through binoculars.\"It was high in the sky, way above the sunset. I could havedrawn a line between the red top and green bottom ... As it turned and moved southwest,the green disappeared and it was all red, like a large goldfish.\"While watching the object, Mootz said that he became aware of a sharp tingling sensationon the exposed parts of his arm and neck. \"It felt like phosphorus burning into my skin andthe pain was intensifying,\" Mootz said. Wasting no time, he ran to his house, removed hisclothing and washed thoroughly. Mootz told me later that what saved him, in his opinion,was his heavy perspiration, which helped dilute the spray.The next morning, Mootz revisited the ill-fated spot. To his amazement, the peach tree wasdead! The branches and twigs were shriveled grotesquely; the leaves curled and crispbrown; and the once-healthy buds of peaches looked like prunes. A little digging showedthat the tree was killed to its very taproots - overnight!I learned of the incident a couple of weeks later and made an appointment with Mootz foran interview. It was a Sunday afternoon when Dell and I drove over. We found Mootzmiddle-aged, friendly and chatty. Carefully, he recounted the details of the incident, gaveme samples of the mummified peaches and twigs, showed me the many white pinprickscars on his arm \"where the substance burned in,\" and finally explained that theauthorities, three men, had already visited him, right after the incident and had takenaway the tree and all its dead fruit. Mootz would not identify the authorities, except tosay they were dressed in plain clothes and were courteous. Said Mootz: \"They promised areport of their analysis within six weeks,\" but when I checked a year later, the report hadnot yet arrived.In every respect Mootz was cooperative. I took 8mm movies of the vacant area where thetree had stood and of Mootz standing near it. Later I had him draw for my filesimpressionistic sketches of the UFO he had seen. Indeed, on paper it was strikinglydifferent from the usual discoid UFO shape.I lost no time in getting the \"pruned\" peaches, the twigs and other chunks of root I dug uppinto the hands of a friend of mine who offered to take them to the Physics Laboratory atVilla Madonna College in Covington, Kentucky. There, elaborate tests were made, onewhich involved a comparison of seeds from the Mootz specimen and another provided bythe lab, which had been allowed to dry out sufficiently. Under controlled conditions, onlythe lab seed sprouted normally. The Mootz specimen proved to be completely dehydrated![ Editor's Note: Implication is exposure of Mootz and peach tree to heating, dryingmicrowave radiation.] Pock-Marked CarsSpring 1954 introduced a new phenomenon, the glass pox. Starting in Bellingham,Washington, where 1500 windshields of automobiles suffered damage, it then spread east,effecting mostly northern cities. In most cases, the glass showed quick symptoms, one typeappearing as a single pit mark, but usually in multiples, as though pelted by bee bee shot.Occasionally, in these instances, the glass fractured radially from pane to pane. In theother type, the glass assumed a honeycombed appearance; in many instances the glass wascompletely collapsed.Everything under the sun, including the sun, was blamed. Experts were baffled; sauceritesknowingly pointed skyward. Cincinnati, always a saucer hotbed, got in the act. Many localreports reached me in 1954, including the chance to see some of the evidence. But it wasnot until August 29, 1955, that I thought I had a case where the poxed windshield and thesaucer revealed a plausible cause-and-effect relationship.The clues of this suspected tie-in began at 3:15 p.m. when a metallic disc reflectingsunlight was reported hovering over the Ohio River. It then shot away at the approach ofan airliner, which was heading toward the Greater Cincinnati Airport. In the evening,shortly before midnight, another report reached me by phone, describing a bright blueobject shaped like a pear, circling over Eastern Cincinnati. I went outside wearing onlyshorts, looked all around with binoculars, but saw nothing. No sooner than I had retired,the phone rang again. A new voice described a pink object turning red, which had justzipped over Indian Hill. Pretty close to home, I thought. This time, dressed only inbinoculars, I slipped out the side door but was again too late.Next day, my brother Jack phoned. His voice vibrated with excitement as he describedwhat had befallen his neighbor's new 1955 Ford parked in front of his house overnight."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The car's rear window was completely shattered. \"It's in a million pieces and each piece isshaped like a cube.\" Nobody could explain it, but the neighbor was plenty mad. Thatevening, still slightly embarrassed for having rummaged through the neighbor's ash cans,Jack brought me a shoe box full of samples. They ranged in size from half-inch cubes tolarger favriform-fractured sections.I later learned from Lex Mebane of Crime Scene Investigations in New York that thefavriform type of poxing, as typified in this one case, was actually no mystery at all.Mebane sums up his research into this phase as follows:\"Windows that crumble suddenly into a multitude of curve-sided, rectangularfragments are made of 'tempered' glass, which has this characteristic mannerof fracture. It has been used in cars only in recent years - I don't know justwhen it was introduced, but it was not long before 1955. Its merit is that it sunusually strong and that when it does crack, it does not crack into the vicioustriangular fragments of ordinary glass. It turns into a sort of 'sand' which isunlikely to cut anyone. This is a safety feature, introduced because cuts frombroken glass are one of the most dangerous hazards of automobile accidents.With tempered glass, this hazard is eliminated.\"I am not sure whether tempered glass is used in windshields. I thinklaminated glass (a plastic sandwich, likewise for safety) is still used there. I amnot sure why. But tempered glass is now common in rear windows. It is madeby sudden chilling of hot glass. This produces a case hardening: the piece isstrong, but unstable, containing locked-in tensions. When it is overstressed, itgoes all to pieces in an instant. The principle is that of Prince Rupert's Drops,which are obtained by dropping molten glass into water. These are tear-dropshaped, with long, curved, tapering tails. The glass is strained, and if the tail issnapped, the drop 'explodes' into a sandy powder, disappearing before one'seyes. This phenomena is what is seen also in the sudden crumbling of rearwindows.\"The question is: What has overstrained the windows and caused them todisintegrate? I have been told by people more familiar with cars than I am thateven standing in the hot sun can do this. The first curved wrap-aroundwindows are also apt to be overstrained in fastening them to the frame andmight 'let go,' seemingly without cause, at almost any time. I think probablythere was also some deficiency in the manufacture, at least at first. Thecrumbling of tempered-glass windows is not really an unusual phenomenonand it just is not the same thing as the 'glass-pox' epidemic of suddenappearance of pits on windshields. The newspapers just picked it up andconfused the two events.\"Science, however, is still scratching its head over the pitting mystery. This is revealed byIrving Petite in a feature article appearing in the Seattle Sunday Times, April 14, 1957.Writes Petite: 'After three years, this mystery appears still unsolved.' He points out thatscientists, considering all plausible theories, have agreed that the H-Bomb does not causepocking of glass; that hydrofluoric acid etches glass smoothly; that special resins can causechips in glass, but only under carefully controlled conditions. Suggested answers: Smallblack spheres from H-Bomb, meteors, or an unknown source.Petite goes on to relate that Hanford Thayer, a consultant on the wartime ManhattanProject, is still making a study of the pocked windshield phenomenon. Thayer carefullysearched every square foot of the concrete street in front of his home in Seattle on April15, 1954, during a glass-poxing incident. He found several black, pea-sized particles. One,a spheroid, is a glassy opaque substance and non-radioactive. The hard imperfect ball isbelieved to be the only specimen available for analysis. According to Thayer, thewindshield pocking mystery is not closed!\" EVIDENCE IN THE FLESH - THE 'GNOMEN'[ Editor's Note: Gnomes/Gnomen - \"Distantly related to dwarves, gnomesare smaller - averaging three to three and a half feet and weighing about 70pounds. Gnomes have deep tan or brown skin and white hair. The mostdistinguishing feature are their noses, in which they take great pride. For somereason, all gnomes have very large noses - compared to the rest of their facialfeatures. The average life span for a gnome is 350 years. Gnomes tend to livein hilly meadows and rocky woodlands. Their small size makes them wary oflarger races, though gnomes are not hostile unless the larger folks are evil.Gnomes are much less dour than their dwarf relatives, with sly and livelysenses of humor.

Possibly the Air Force thought of thiswhen they dispatched investigators by helicopter from Maxwell AFB, in Alabama, toSylacauga in 1954 to examine the \"meteorite,\" which fell through the roof of Mrs. HewlitHodges, causing her injury. Incidentally, when I wrote to Mrs. Hodges about the meteorite,her lawyers answered that it was for sale - the price, $5,000.While civilian researchers cannot afford helicopters - or do not have funds to buy acelebrated meteorite - a few, not bothered with bulletin deadlines, have aircraft and willtravel! I have had a couple of standing offers: Jim McAshan III's of Knoxville, Tennessee,and Jack Grant's of Columbus, Ohio. They have offered to fly anywhere the not newsbreaks. But I'm afraid that domesticity and all its implications have been my chiefdeterrent. Besides, my own \"backyard\" - the greater Cincinnati area - has provided enoughfollow-up material to keep me busy for years.Knowing this was Ted Bloecher of CSI, N. Y. His first visit to CRIFO was a brief weekendin August 1955, in the midst of a UFO flap. Not only saucers were rampant, but so werereports of \"little green men.\" So much was happening, in fact, that we had little more timethan to get acquainted. During the year, however, with the big flap gone, except for itswake of data waiting for correlation, Ted and I took time to kick around the \"little greenmen\" by mail. To me, the subject was challenging. Kelly-Hopkinsville, Kentucky, \"Little Men\"The first \"little men\" incident to alarm the nation took place on August 21, 1955, in Kelly,near Hopkinsville, Kentucky. The story covered by the news wires told of a band of littleogres that descended on a farmhouse, causing its occupants some frightful moments.Depiction of one of several non-human entities seen by familyin Kelly-Hopkinsville, Kentucky, beginning around 7 p.m. local timeon August 21, 1955. Sketch courtesy Donn Davison.[ Editor's Note: According to The UFO Encyclopedia © 1980 by MargaretSachs, \"at about 7:00 p.m. on August 21, 1955, teenager Billy Ray Sutton"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"went outside the family farmhouse to get a drink from the well. When hereturned, he announced that he had seen a large, bright object land about acity block away. ...almost an hour later, a barking dog alerted the family to theapproach of a glowing creature, less than 4-feet-tall with long arms raised overits round head. When it was about twenty feet from them, two of the menfired at it. The little man somersaulted and hurried away into the darkness.\"When a second creature appeared at the window, a shot was fired at Mirright through the screen. The entity seemed to have been hit and disappeared.As one of the men led the way through the door to see if the creature wasdead, a claw-like hand reached down at him from the roof. Another entity wasseen on a tree branch. The men fired at both creatures. The bullets seemed toricochet off them as if they were covered in nickel-plated armor. The creaturein the tree floated to the ground, then scuttled away.\"Soon the eight adults and three children had locked themselves inside thehose. From time to time, the entities appeared at the windows. They wereimpervious to the bullets. However,, their glowing, round, yellow eyes seemedsensitive to the house lights and the Suttons concluded that this was whatprevented the creatures from coming toward the doors.\"The incident was investigated by the U. S. Air Force, local authorities,journalists and civilian UFO investigators. It was classified as unidentified byProject Blue Book.\"]While the nation tittered over this, the little creatures dropped into Cincinnati. Like aplague, they began infesting the communities of Winton Woods, Cumminsville, CampWashington, Mt. Airy and Greenhills. Then at the height of the furore, the police nabbedAlbert Snapp, a 15-year-old boy who was wearing long, green-dyed underwear. Headmitted having fun in Cumminsville scaring his neighbors. The youth, however, deniedleaving his neighborhood during his masquerade. Snapp thus became the \"whipping boy\"for all the hooliganism and provided the press its cue to laugh off all the reports. Oneincident, however, occurred in Greenhills and left several question marks. Alien Creatures On Stockton, Georgia, RoadJuly 3, 1955Another incident related during the press's fanfare was that befalling Mrs. WesleySymmonds of Cincinnati. While driving through Stockton, Georgia, to Florida on July 3,1955, she encountered four bug-eyed creatures standing in the road. This case I do notdismiss. Having talked with Mrs. Symmonds and having heard her testimony on tape madeduring an interrogation by Calvin Prem, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney for HamiltonCounty, I felt that she was relating the truth. At least in my opinion, it was an attempt torelate an experience she could not explain."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"\"Frightful creatures\" as described by Mrs. Wesley Symmonds during interviewwith Len Stringfield in which she recounted her experience, which she \"hopes to forget,\"while motoring through Stockton, Georgia, on July 3, 1955.

While sensational, the cases could notbe easily checked at their sources. The attempts I made to contact the principals involvedwere unsuccessful because the people were inaccessible. Other cases equally sensational I"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"learned about on a tip from Herb Clark, my friend in GOC. These all occurred before theKelly case and were centered in the vicinity of Loveland, northeast of Cincinnati. Mostbaffling was an affair allegedly occurring under a bridge, which involved Civil Defenseofficials. All attempts to elicit additional information brought the proverbial Sphinx silence.In August of 1956, Ted Bloecher returned to Cincinnati. This time, staying a week, hecame armed with new data on the Kelly case. When I reviewed the data, I couldunderstand Ted's enthusiasm to investigate the Cincinnati cases. It was indeed aneye-opener and a magnificent job of intelligence work on the part of Miss Isabel Davis ofCSI, who visited Kelly for first-hand information.Drafting a plan of action, Ted and I began with the Greenhills case. First, we arrangedinterviews at the home of one of its key witnesses. She was one of two girls who had beenwith boy friends \"parking\" and panicked on the sight of a little luminous creature.Operating separately, Ted and I took turns interviewing and while doing so, sketched thealleged creature, careful to capture every feature she could reconstruct and describe frommemory.When we finished, to our surprise the drawings looked much the same as the little bipedwhich was sketched for the Cincinnati Post following the Symmonds story of the yearbefore. Instantly, Ted and I knew something was wrong, for the Post's \"little man\" wasnothing more than a cartoon. According to Mrs. Symmonds, the Post drawing was quiteunlike the creatures she saw in Stockton.We asked about the two boys and learned that one had been killed during the year whileserving in the Air Force. The other, the driver of the car, was in the Navy. Luckily, he washome on leave and we reached him by phone. Hesitant, fearing publicity, he finallyadmitted having seen a \"luminous body\" standing near a fireplug. Unable to explain it, hesaid it \"glowed,\" but it \"wasn't green like the newspaper said.\"Next in our plans was a check into the Loveland cases. Of these, the \"affair under thebridge,\" as I called it, was the most intriguing to Ted. In Orbit, I had written about it as \"acase involving a prominent business man ... who saw four little men about 3-feet-tall undera certain bridge.\" This person had \"reported the bizarre affair to the police\" and that \"anarmed guard was placed there.\" I told Ted that most of my attempts to glean additionaldetails were foiled; that the local Civil Defense unit, which I heard had been engaged atthe bridge, would not talk; that the Loveland Police Chief John Fritz, who \"knew about thecase,\" had \"brushed off\" one inquisitor and that my feelers elsewhere fell flat. However, Idid learn from a member of the school board of that community that the incident had beeninvestigated by the F. B. I.But not to be discouraged, early one morning, Ted hopped a cab to Loveland. His first stopin the police station found Fritz cordial and chatty, but \"somewhat fidgety\" when askedabout the armed guard at the bridge. Ted, however, had no trouble in extracting the homeaddress of C. F., one of the principals in the case. Later that afternoon, Ted visited C. F.But as I had expected, C. F. refused to review the case beyond the details that had alreadyslipped out.But the day was not wasted. Ted's richest plumb came quite unexpectedly. In what seemedto Ted a stratagem to circumvent the bridge affair, Fritz introduced a new lead into another\"little men\" case.It was a hot humid Saturday evening when Ted, Dell and I met Mr. R. H., by appointment,at the 31 Bar in the city. My first glimpse at R. H. was reassuring. For obvious reasons, insuch abstract investigations, one always beforehand conjures up the worst type ofindividual. But here was a man in a responsible position, well-dressed, well-mannered. Hisvoice was soft, undramatic, and his eyes steady, never shifting. Sipping a martini, we heardR. H.'s amazing story from which the highpoints follow:\"About 4 a.m. on a march night in 1955, while driving through Branch Hill onhis way to Loveland, R. H. saw in the beams of his headlights what appearedto be three men kneeling at the right side of the road. His first impression wasthat \"somebody was hurt or some crazy guys were having fun.\" Curious, hestopped his car and got out for a better look. To his surprise, he discoveredthat the figures were non-human and about 3-feet-tall. They were not green,R. H. stressed, but rather a 'greyish color,' including the garments. These tight-fitting, stretched over a 'lop-sided chest' which bulged at the shoulder to thearm pit. Over this bulbousness hung a slender arm, noticeably longer than itsopposite member. Save for only a fleeting impression of 'something baggy,' thelegs and feet were obscured by weeds and brush. 'Their heads were ugly,' saidR. H., reminding him of a 'frog's face' mostly because of the mouth, whichspanned in a thin line across a smooth, grey face. While R. H. thought theeyes 'without brows' seemed normal and the 'nose was indistinct,' the pate of"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"the head 'had a painted-on-like-hair effect, like a plastic doll.' He added, 'Itwas corrugated, or like rolls of fat running horizontally over a bald head.'\"According to R. H., the middle biped was first seen with its arms upraised.'They were raised a foot or so above the head,' he said, 'and holding a darkchain or stick, which emitted blue-white sparks jumping from one hand to theother.' As R. H. approached, he said this biped then lowered its arms with thechain 'as if to tie it around its ankles.' R. H. said he wanted to get closer, butby the time he had reached the front fender of his car, the 'little men' made aslight 'unnatural' move toward him, 'as if motioning me not to come anycloser.' For about three minutes, R. H. said he stood still, just watching - tooamazed to be afraid. Next thing he remembered, he was on his way to Fritz'soffice.\" (Implying missing time?)\"Impressionistic\" sketch of gnomen seen by \"R. H.\" on the road near Loveland,Ohio, March 1955. Note frog-like mouths, rolls of fat on brow and lop-sided chests.Sketch © 1955 by Leonard Stringfield.Fritz, by his own admission, investigated. Armed with gun and camera, he drove to theindicated area, made four or five passes, but saw nothing. An interesting and possiblecorrelative sidelight of this case, however, is the fact that members of the Loveland GOCPost, according to its supervisor, reported seeing a UFO in the general area sometimeduring the R. H. encounter. Later attempts to obtain the date of the sighting, which wouldalso date R. H.'s story, were unsuccessful.Three characteristics stand out in the R. H. revelations:1) Gregariousness of three bipeds.2) One with arms upraised.3) Their greyish color.In review of all the astounding evidence culminating from the testimony of other incidents,it is noted that the Branch Hill case shares similar characteristics with each and/or all.Gregariousness, or a banding together of the bipeds, is characteristic of both the North andSouth American cases. In the United States, Kelly reported \"approximately 15,\" while theStockton and the Loveland bridge affair each reported four. In Venezuela, Valenciareported six; Carora four; Petare three; Amacuro Delta two. Only Zulia reported one."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Front page of Venezuelan newspaper sent to Stringfield by Horacio Gonzales of Caracas,which headlines \"hairy biped\" incident in Petare in November 1954. Police investigating thescene where Gustavo Gonzales (upper right) said he struggled withcreatures depicted in lower right drawing.The arms upraised anomaly is noted also in the Kelly and Stockton cases. Significantly,Stockton also evidenced one of the bipeds holding a metallic rod (compare R. H.'s \"chairor stick\") with which it seemed to be digging in the road.But perhaps most significant and contrary to newspaper talk was that in no one incidentwere the bipeds described as green. In all, they were described variously as brown, tan orgray. While there were also minor variances in the description of the \"skin\" as being hairyor rough, and the \"hands\" being claw-like or rake-like, the widest divergence of reportedfeatures were those describing the head and face. In some, the eyes were luminous andlemurian or \"as large as saucers.\" In others, they were bird-like, small or normal. In some,the noses were long and pointed; in others, mere orifices.One striking anomaly in comparing two cases from Kelly and Branch Hill was thesimilarity of certain facial features, while in others they were the very opposite. In bothcases, the bipeds evidenced wide, frog-like mouths. But while Kelly evinced extra-proportionate elfin ears - like in fairytale drawings - the Branch Hill featured no ears at all!Perhaps for the sake of argument, the best analogy on earth is the Order of Primates,consisting of man, apes, monkeys, marmosets and lemurs. Of Man, the negroids beholdboth the tallest and smallest of Homo sapiens. Among his cousins are the gorilla and thetarsier. All related, but different!There are other incidents which involve little bipeds - or shall we call them gnomen? Ofthis group is an Indianapolis incident which allegedly involved a high school principal who,with companion teachers, were terrorized by four gnomen near a river campsite in 1954.Ted finally tracked down the principal, who denied the story. Another Loveland incidentwas related to Ted and me and the supervisor of the Loveland GOC after it was brought tomy attention by Herb Clark. When the supervisor visited my home in regards to UFOreporting, he told of a gnoman frightening a woman in her yard. More information waspromised, but liaison was never established. Still another incident occurred in Kentucky,which involved several gnomen seen from an automobile on a dark roadside. According tomy reluctant intermediary who earlier promised all the details, one of the bipeds touchedthe car's fender, leaving marks or scratches on the paint.
