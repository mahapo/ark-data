Today, Jim is a tax consultant in Las Vegas, Nevada.May 12, 2006 Las Vegas, Nevada - A decade ago at a 1995 conference, I was introduced to a man namedJim Sparks. He described totally conscious encounters with extraterrestrial biological entities (EBEs) that hesaid were “small, grey, drone worker types and taller, true aliens, or supervisors.” Jim explained that a fewyears before in 1988, he was happily married and was a thriving real-estate developer working in both Texasand North Carolina. Then suddenly, he came face-to-face with beings from other worlds. Jim Sparks told methat at first he had dozens of what he thought were repeating, vivid dreams about floating from his bed at nightout through a guestroom window to a place filled with computer screens. He thought he w as losing his mind. Then after one episode, on his guestroom carpet, he found dozens of petals and leaves from a honeysuckleplant that grew outside the window he kept floating through in his \"dreams.\" The flower petals and leaveswere embedded in his own footprints sunken in the thick carpet. In fact, one footprint had only the front half ofhis foot in the guestroom carpet. The heel was defined by petals and leaves on the other side of the glasswindow. After sundown, Jim knew the humid air settled on the grass and that anything in his lawn would clingto bare feet. The hard physical evidence on his guestroom carpet was the turning point for an escalation in thenumber and intensity of abductions. It was as if Jim was being slowly introduced to another reality. Once hismind accepted that he was actually going somewhere at night, the other reality took him more often. Not only has Jim Sparks experienced at least two abduction methods, he might have the answer about why3-dimensional gold symbols are placed over telepathic upload/download “movies” and communications fromthe grey, non-human beings.

Somehow they create a field that breaks down the matter? The matter stays intact, but somehowyou (can go through the molecules). I'm not sure how it w orks. I’m not a scientist. But it does. Nonetheless,that’s going the easy way. You’re escorted. There is another way of being pulled that I do not like. In fact, it’s horrific because it torques your body. It’shard on everything. That’s when I think a craft is actually in flight passing by, hovering over. I call that beingpulled the hard way. The hard way is miserably uncomfortable. I’ve had hard pulls. In the beginning, the hard pulls were when I was sleeping. Then as things went on andmonths turned into years and it became a conscious interaction. But before that, I could either be asleep orawake. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The fi rst thi ng you w oul d noti ce on a hard pull i s that you w oul d start to hear a w hi rl ing, w hi ppi ng sound thatthe rpms of that sound would slowly increase. So it would sound like someone was taking a jump rope, (hemimics sound of rope going round in the air). As you do the jump rope faster, it’s a whipping, whirling soundthat starts at a slow rpm and it would paralyze you. That’s what you would hear and you would hear it insideyour head. As the rpms of that whirling sound increase, you feel a sensation in your body of like coming from the center ofyour stomach, spreading out and up into your upper torso of a paralyzing sensation. Then the whirling,whipping sound would get louder and faster and louder and faster and I don’t know if you’re breaking down(molecularly). I don’t know what it’s doing, but it’s starting to come up your torso towards your heart and itincreases. It gets to the point it’s screaming in your head and you get the sensation that you’re going to die. Ofcourse, who wants to die? So, you’re screaming inside your head and you’re hearing this stuff inside yourhead, but you are completely paralyzed and you’re going, ‘No! No!’ It’s like you don’t want to let go and it’sgetting louder and louder and louder until it gets to an extreme and you black out. Blacking out means totally unconscious. And then w hen you regain consciousness, you’re there. You're aboarda craft. WHAT WOULD BE AROUND YOU? In the beginning, I w as paralyzed. I couldn’t move. I w as sitting up on something that was like a bench. My – infront of me was a like a desk. I call it a screen desk. It was a desk that was nothing but a big screen. It was likea work desk thing that was in front of me. And then approximately 6 or 8 feet from my face to something thatlooked like a wall screen. So there’s a table screen and a wall screen. Jim Sparks's depiction of the EBE \"classroom\" where he was forced to learn a symbolequivalent of the English alphabet and numbers, as well as alien shorthand symbols and phrases.Drawing by Jose Galante © 1996 for Jim Sparks.My head could move up and down. That was allowed to move up and down. My right hand would lean on thistable screen and my right hand could move, but I could not move my right hand off the screen or anything. Myright forefinger could move and would act as something that could draw letters, symbols and stuff like that. I had no clue where I was. I had no understanding as to why I was there. I did not know who did this or whatdid this. If you can imagine first of all going through the trauma of being pulled and my experiences have beenpretty much in every case totally conscious. The first thing I heard and knew from whatever they were – they didn’t let me see them at first, either.Everything was a slow break in. It took months and years. I found myself there in this paralyzed state and myfirst instructions were, ‘A.’ And you think, ‘What do you mean A?’ As it turned out, it was the alphabet: A, B, C, - all the way to... but no Qs and Zs.... to translate what was anextraterrestrial version of the letter ‘A,’ whether made it up for the purpose to try to teach us? I don’t know. Towhat our version of an ‘A’ was."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Drawings of the first letters and numbers that Jim Sparks says the non-human beingstaught him. Unlike the English alphabet, for example, which is written and understood as static letterson a two-dimensional surface such as a piece of paper, the alien symbols were differentiated in the numberand direction of motions in their construction. \"a,\" for example, was three motions: left to right, right to left, and left to right, all back and forth in thesame short, horizontal line. Drawings by Jim Sparks with Jose Galante © 1996. SO THEY DID THIS WITH LETTERS AND NUMBERS TEACHING YOU A TRANSLATION BETWEENEXTRATERRESTRIAL SYMBOLS AND WHAT WE WOULD CALL ENGLISH LETTERS ANDNUMBERS? Under 100% total duress. I hated everything about being there. I hated the fact that I wasn’t asked. I hated thefact that it wasn’t like, ‘Hi, we’re from wherever and would you like to learn something new?’ It wasconstantly being forced. So, most of my time and energy 18 years ago was directed toward, ‘I hate you. Youdon’t understand what we’re all about. You have no clue. You should ask. You don’t know what dignity is.You don’t know w hat respect i s.’ So I was more involved in fighting and opposing and arguing. Any instructions that were given, it was my goalto do the opposite and make them as miserable about their task as they were making me about even being there.So, I did everything I could not to cooperate. In those beginning stages, a letter would come up on this workbench in a shadow-like form. We’re talking2-dimensional flat surface. I would simulate the letter 'A.' Then it would show up also on a wall screen. They(EBEs) absorb data anywhere from ten to 100 times faster (than we do). That’s why it’s difficult tocommunicate with a Grey and why they don’t like questions is because they are already 100 times faster thanyour mi nd i s doi ng things. It w oul d be l i ke tryi ng to communi cate w i th a monkey or somethi ng. We al w ays askthe same questions: ‘Who are you?’ ‘Where are you from?’ Blah, blah, blah. So, I learned over the years youjust don’t ask anything and you get the information you want by just keeping your mouth shut and it will cometo you through them."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Supervisor non-human being that appeared with powerful presence and orderedJim Sparks to write his question in alien symbols after sparks argued with small, grey \"drones.\"Drawing by Jose Galante © 1996 for Jim Sparks.It did progress to a 3-D holographic, floating in the air. But when you would look at these things in the air infront of you, you could see through it. So, it w ould almost be like a weak hologram would be, only the lightwould not be very bright. It would be floating in the air in front of you. It could be either a nature scene or atable or letters or symbols or all of these things. Warning About Earth's Deteriorating Environment I had an abduction experience where it was like a mother ship kind of training or abduction thing where wewere in a corridor. The corridor opened up into this huge thing that looked like the size of a basketballgymnasium, even bigger. But when you looked at the ship from the outside, it looked smaller. But once youwere in there, all of a sudden, it’s this huge thing. We were being seated in front of these things that looked like monitors. Scenes were coming upon thesemonitors that were Earth scenes, like a beautiful crystal clear ocean, a beautiful crystal, pristine skies withbeautiful mountain scenes; and all these nature scenes that would stay on the monitor screens for 3 or 4seconds and then the monitor would go dark and you would hear a hum. And then another scene would come up. It would stay on for about 3 seconds and then it would fade way andthere would be a dark screen and you’d hear another hum. You started to relate to the hum almost hypnoticallyas the beautiful scenes came up. Then each Earth scene started getting uglier and the telepathic message was, ‘You are killing your planet. Yourplanet is dying,’ as to what we were doing to the rain forest, pollution, and all that stuff. ‘Stop it!’ But, what really stood out with me was that I was in this alien school hard class (laughs). The first 18 monthswere just – I was pulled three or four times a week and this went on for a year and a half finding myself infront of this table screen and wall screen and learning the equivalents of letters and numbers and whatever. 3-D Symbols Over Images: An Alien Filing System But I noticed on these monitors in the bottom left... I saw the symbols that I learned back in 1988, six or eightyears earlier. So, I was more focused on the symbols in the bottom left than I was in looking at the Earthscenes. I could decipher them. I had an interest in, ‘What is this? I can decipher this stuff.’ On the bottom left, what I was getting is that every time one of those scenes would come up. I learned it was afiling system. As I picked it up, ‘Oh, that’s a filing system!’ A telepathic loud voice in my head would go,‘No!’ Like you are an animal or dog, like one word commands, as if, ‘No, don’t try to study the symbols.That’s not what this is for. That’s not what you’re supposed to do. You’re supposed to look at the sceneswe’re show ing you here.’ But I couldn’t help myself and just kept looking at the symbols. I figured it to be a filing system and then"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"blacked out. So, I can associate symbols with holographic scenes because it’s a way of filing whatever theyare projecting. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE ABDUCTION SYNDROME WHO HAVE HADTHE DOWNLOADS THAT THEY THINK ARE LIKE FEATURE FILMS RUNNING THROUGH THEIRHEADS WITH THE 3-D SYMBOLS SUPERIMPOSED OVER THE FEATURE FILMS, HAVE YOUPERSONALLY EVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE THAT? Whenever that stuff is in use – the 3-dimensional symbols associated with particular scenes and stuff – I don’tknow if that’s supposed to burn an associated symbol with a movie so it’s like a subconscious or subliminalway of mind-control? Or a subliminal method for you to retain data of something you’ve seen, so when you seethat symbol maybe you know w hat i t means? Massive Content in Small EBE Symbols I know over the years it went from the simple A, B. C, symbols to the letter ‘A’ being some equivalent to whatI thought was some alien symbol of the letter ‘A.’ Then it became like a shorthand version. Then the shorthand version turned into a whole sentence, orsomething that looked like the size of a centimeter wiggle would be a sentence. Then, the centimeter wigglesymbol would become an entire paragraph. Then it turned out you could get 20 pages of text into something thesize of a 50 cent piece, or even in some cases, a quarter with a bunch of squiggles on it. But when you look atit, you get 20 pages of information instantly. So, my experiences went from going to elementary school with A, B, C and all this kind of stuff to the nextthing you know, you’re getting something akin to the Encyclopedia Britannica in coin-sized symbols. Twenty pages of English text retold in only two pages of alien symbols,further reduced to one-half page in alien shorthand and further reduced to one circle of shorthandsymbols equivalent to the full 20-page English text. Drawings by Jose Galante © 1996 for Jim Sparks. JIM, DO YOU THINK YOU NEEDED THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL TECHNOLOGY TO GATHER THEENCYCLOPAEDIA INFORMATION FROM THE SMALL DARK CIRCLE? OR DO YOU THINK YOUWERE ABLE, AT THAT POINT, TO EXTRACT INFORMATION ON YOUR OWN? It seemed to me for the whole communication system to work efficiently, they have to be around. Whateverthey are trying to communicate w ith you, like teaching – I’m always suspicious of anything they do – but itseems like their presence has to be here in order to make it work. Then once they are gone, science (meaningus) is left with bits and pieces that you actually can’t decipher. EBE Technology to Hide in Other Dimensions They have an understanding of hiding, or using, other dimensions. In other words, you or an E. T. - a Grey -can be literally occupying the same space at the same time. But maybe in a different frequency where you can’tbe seen, or your presence can’t be felt or heard. So, they are using other dimensions to work from and ourdimension."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"So, what I surmise is that they can be – sometimes you see them shadowy or sometimes you can haveexperiences where you’re looking at the Grey or extraterrestrial like you are looking right through their body,almost ghost-like. Then there are other times where they seem pretty solid and they are not quite. And thenthere are other times that they are physically 100% here. So, the aliens (EBEs) can be ghost-like: 60% in one dimension they are working in, or hiding in, so to speak.Then they can be 40% in this dimension. They can work in this dimension from another dimension and they canadjust the percentages just like you w ould a rheostat. WHY DO YOU THINK THEY DO THAT? Advanced technology. Say you wanted to study lions in their natural habitat. There’s extreme danger therewhen being a few feet from a lion when they are ready to feed or whatever it may be doing. But you want towork with it as much as you can without harming yourself or being detected. So, now you have tools to work with. First you are noticing the mood of a lion, but you want to get close up tocheck it out. So why not be 95% in your hiding dimension and 5% in the dimension, or the reality of, that lionwhere you are ghost-like so if it pawed at you, it w ould go through you and not harm you. You can vary thelevels of your study by adjusting what percentage you want to be in this reality versus another one so you canget the work done. It’s just a tool. It’s a technological tool. YOU ARE SAYING THAT WHEN PEOPLE SEE THE EBENS IN A TRANSLUCENT FORM THAT THEYSEE THROUGH WHERE IT IS GHOST-LIKE, IT’S BECAUSE THEY ARE PROTECTING THEMSELVESFROM US? Absolutely! Unless shown otherwise, I’m 98% convinced it’s a technological tool. It’s a defense mechanism.It’s just one of the tricks they have in their big technical bag of tricks. So, when they are translucent and youcan see through them, it’s because they have adjusted whatever frequency of being in this reality that they wantto be, while they are in a safe harbor in another dimension. I’ve learned through the years that there are several dimensions out there. Some of them are created. Nothingexists in them. And there are other dimensions that things actually exist in them, whether they are alive in thatdimension or not or whatever they are. I think when people see ghosts and things of that nature, that’s justanother dimension bleeding through. Or there are areas physically on the planet where our dimension and otherdimensions can bleed through better than others. DID THE GREY BEINGS EVER SAY TO YOU STRAIGHTFORWARDLY, OR SHOW YOU ON ONE OFTHE SCREENS, WHERE THEIR HOME BASE IS LITERALLY? In the early years, I did ask a lot and particularly what anyone would ask: Where are you from? What’s it likeover there? My interactions with these things in the early years were on a punishment/reward basis. If I wascooperating with trying to learn the symbols and letters – things evolved for me to be more cooperative as theyears went by, then the reward session would be, ‘You can ask a question.’ When it came to that question (about where are the EBEs from), the answer was always the same. It would belike they are from somewhere it would be too difficult for human understanding to comprehend. The closestanswer to being anything that I could, or anybody could, relate to would be: ‘We’re star people.’ Where are they from? Over the years, when you say ‘star people,’ I don’t particularly think they have a home. Ithink they are in a lot of places all the time, scattered throughout the universe. BUT, JIM, WHAT IF THEY ARE FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION THAT IS NOT EVEN IN THIS ONE? That is equally as possible. But see, this is what I’ve learned from them over the years from them, too. Theyare so deceptive! They are the masters of deception. Deception on top of deception on top of deception.Clearly they don’t want you to know these things. It’s almost like what they say, you better start calculatingalmost the opposite equally as well in order to get somewhere as far as information is concerned. UFO Crashes - Some DeliberateTechnology Red Herrings? SO, WHAT IS IT THAT YOU THINK AFTER 18 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WITH THESE GREYBEINGS THAT THEY REALLY WANT WITH US AND THIS PLANET? It might even floor you when I tell you this. These crashes, when we find bits and pieces of half or whole shipsor whatever, the Black Budget people are doing and anything of that nature. Anything that we find that we thinkis a part of what their technology is, is because they purposefully crashed this stuff so we’ll think that’s whattheir technology is. As a matter of fact, this is something that is the latest with me. When we went from vacuumtubes to solid-state technology, meaning quartz crystals and all that – a big jump out of nowhere! It’s beensuspected that some of the material from these crashes lead us to go from sort of an ancient technology towhere we are now, with high-speed computers and everything. However, I feel like they are using a technology that they don’t want us to know about or even venture in. So,they drop stuff like that from the sky, so to speak. We’re lead to believe when we find these things like, ‘Wow,what is this? What is this disc here? Or what is that?’ And we jump in leaps and bounds in our technology, butit keeps taking us in a direction that they have total control over. And it keeps us from going in the directionthey are in. IT SORT OF THE BAIT AND SWITCH. ONE MILITARY MAN BACK IN THE EARLY 1980S TOLD ME"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THAT THE GREY BEINGS LIE AND WE NOW KNOW THAT SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGY THATWE GAINED FROM SOME OF THE CRASHED DISCS DOES NOT WORK. IT’S AS IF THEY LEAD USDOWN A RED HERRING TO SLOW US DOWN OR DEFLECT US. Beautiful! I hadn’t heard that, but there you go. I couldn’t be any more in league with that opinion. So, that’s theway you always have to think when it comes to them. If they can process data just in their minds ten to ahundred times faster (than we can), and they have a mass, telepathic consciousness. WHY ARE THEY HERE ON THIS EARTH INTERACTING WITH HUMANS, ANIMALS AND EARTHLIFE? I had always asked and couldn’t seem to get a direct answer to, which was: Why me? Why me?! I don’t meanto be self-centered, but I was the one going through these intrusive procedures which were commonly knownas abductions and why? There were times when I was a good laboratory mouse and I cooperated with theirexperiments, so got my little reward sessions. One time in particular I asked ‘Why me?’ And there was scene after scene going back from maybe 30 or 40years ago, then 100 years ago, then thousands of years ago to something that looked like a half-ape, half-humanbeings in the African savannah. In each and every case, I saw individuals in each of the separate scenes thathad features of my own. So, what I concluded by what they (EBEs) showed me, the answer to my questionwas, they follow certain family lines throughout thousands, if not going back millions of years. Jim Sparks interpreted this 3-D holographic scene shown to him by the non-human beingsas the forbidden history of man's artificial creation by \"Star P eople\" who manipulated DNA inalready-evolving primates to create Homo sapiens. Drawing by Jose Galante © 1996 for Jim Sparks.WHICH WOULD BE FOLLOWING BLOOD LINES? Yes. What would the tracer element be to go from one individual to the other to the other to the other? Andhow, I’m not sure. But there is obviously some kind of tracking system that they have that follows certain linesand species, and maybe in their eyes, with particular traits that are of use to them (EBE) for whatever purpose. Things are multi-faceted. You might have some that are working with the military. You might have some thatare just medical. God only knows. But in that case, what I got out of it was that they tracked a particular gene or family line somehow going backall the way to when we were kind of apelike. YOU AND I HAVE DISCUSSED THAT PRESIDENTIAL BRIEFING PAPER THAT I WAS SHOWN IN1983. THERE WAS A PARAGRAPH THAT SAID, ‘THESE EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICALENTITIES MANIPULATED DNA IN ALREADY-EVOLVING PRIMATES TO CREATE HOMO SAPIENSSAPIENS. IF THAT’S TRUE, THEN WE HUMANS ARE THEIR LABORATORY PROJECT. The impression I got also – and of course I responded violently as opposing the idea to them (EBEs) fromanger was – yes, I was lead to believe on more than one occasion that the whole reason that we humans arehere is due to their manipulation (of genes). It’s almost like there is an ownership – an ownership attitude ontheir part. So, it’s like, ‘You (EBEs) don’t have the right to do this or that and interfere with our lives. Theirposition is they have the right to do with anything we humans do because if it was not for the EBEs, we humanswouldn’t be here. I have a problem with that. But, it may very well be true.” More Information:"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Keepers, An Alien Message for the Human Race © 1996 by Jim Sparksis to be published in late June 2006 by www.5thworld.comand w ill be a va ila ble f or or de rs a t a ma zon. c om.
