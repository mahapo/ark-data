Image © 2006 by Jaime Maussan Productions. June 22, 2006 Mexico City, Mexico - While scientists are trying to save polar bears and other animalsfaced w ith hardship and extinctions as planet Earth continues to w arm up this century, another kind of animalthreat continues to happen around the world without comment from scientists or political leaders. Lawenforcement calls that threat, \"animal mutilations.\" The bloodless, trackless deaths have occurred amonghorses, cattle, sheep, goats, domestic cats and dogs, and wild animals around the world since at least the early1960s. Long associated with the strange animal mutilations have been beams of light coming from unidentifiedaerial discs in the sky. I have interviewed about a dozen ranchers and other eyewitnesses who have seenanimals either raised up from pastures in light beams or lowered back, dead and mutilated. What is thatpowerful beam technology? And who, or what, focuses the beams on animals – and even sometimes people?Military and intelligence insiders say the perpetrators are “extraterrestrial biological entities.”If so, was it an extraterrestrial beam that lifted a brown horse in the air near a Milan, Italy, apartment buildingand kept the horse suspended about a hundred feet off the ground? Or was it a balloon hoax? The incident goesback eight months ago to October 17, 2005, at 5:07 p.m., Milan time. The exact date and time were recordedon three minutes of digital videotape taken by Milanese fashion designer, Antonio Urze, from his 6th floorapartment balcony. His girlfriend, Simona Sibila, called him excitedly to get to the balcony to see the “flyinghorse.” And Simona was called to the balcony by her young sister, who first cried out that she saw a horse“flying in the sky.”Antonio Urze and Simona Sibila are both in their late twenties and are successful professionals in Milan’sactive fashion industry. The unmarried couple has lived together in the same Milan apartment for the past fiveyears. And both say they have seen strange phenomena since they were young, but don’t know why. However,each thought the horse suspended in mid-air might mean another intelligence out there wants people to knowthat a large horse can be lifted and held high in the air. The couple wonders if the implication of the “flyinghorse” is that Something wants the human species to be better prepared to see such events on a more frequentbasis.In March of this year, the couple met Mexico investigative journalist and TV producer, Jaime Maussan, inItaly. They showed Jaime the videotape. He asked for a copy to study back at his offices in Mexico City andcalled me to say that what he was seeing on the tape reminded him of my animal mutilation investigativereports about eyewitnesses who have described animals rising in beams of light.Jaime sent me a dub of the three-minute videotape that Antonio Urze shot from his 6th floor balcony in Milan.Unfortunately, because Antonio did not put the camera on a tripod, the lens is constantly moving and most ofthe individual video frames do not show a well-focused horse. Jaime sent me two frames from the videotape.One shows a wide shot that includes towers and antennae in the foreground and the horse suspended nearby."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Frame of digital videotape shot by Antonio Urze at 5:07 p.m. from his 6th floor apartment balconyin Milan, Italy, on October 17, 2005. Antennae are in foreground; horse is about 100 feet high,suspended in the air in front of the apartment balcony. Image © 2006 by Jaime Maussan P roductions.The second frame is zoomed in more and shows a silhouette of a horse, seemingly tipped up more verticallyfrom the other frame. In the first minute or so, the sun does reflect off what seems to be an actual horse for acouple of seconds and the horse’s hair is a brownish-red. A closer zoom a minute later on the digital videotape. The horse seems to be tipped morevertically than in the other frame. Image © 2006 by Jaime Maussan P roductions.This week after screening the videotape several times, I called Jaime Maussan for an interview about what hehas learned from the couple so far and how he plans to investigate further.Interview:Jaime Maussan, Inve stigative Journalist and O wne r, Jaime Maussan Productions, which produce s atelevision show called “Big Mysteries of the Third Millennium,” Mexico City: “They said the first personwho saw the object, or horse, was a little girl, the sister of Simona. She was very excited, saying that a horsewas flying. Simona came out to the balcony and then she saw something. But she did not understand what shewas seeing. She did not know if it was a helicopter, a UFO or what. She stayed there for four or five minutesuntil she realized it was a horse. At that moment, she went inside and called Antonio Urze, who came and sawthe horse for two or three minutes before he went inside to get his video camera and record what he wasseeing.You can hear in the video the voices of Simona and Antonio talking about the flying horse (in Italian). Antoniosaid in the interview that he knows about horses and he was able to see the horse very close from him. He sawsometimes that for him demonstrated that the horse was very tense. The ears were very pointed to the front.The neck very tight. He saw the legs moving and he realized that this horse was alive. That’s when he decidedthat he had to record this. The duration of the tape shows it was brief, but at the same time long enough to seethe perfect form of a very big horse. This horse is not a small horse, but very big. The color is brown. You cansee that in the videotape. That’s what I know about the incident.They are absolutely convinced that these events happened as a demonstration of the beings that are somehowshowing them the UFOs very close to them. They believe these are demonstrations. They don’t understandexactly why, but that’s what they believe, Linda.COULD THE LITTLE GIRL OR COUPLE EVER SEE ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE A BEAM HOLDINGTHAT HORSE IN THE AIR?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"No, they just saw the horse flying. They never saw any kind of craft or anything else. They just saw the horsemo vi ng.IN THE VIDEOTAPE, YOU CANNOT REALLY SEE MOTION OF THE HORSE ITSELF AS ANTONIODESCRIBED HE COULD SEE WITH HIS EYES. WHAT DID HAPPEN TO THAT HORSE? WHY DIDANTONIO STOP VIDEOTAPING?That question, I don’t know the answer for sure. I wonder, too, but it seems that the horse as we see at the endof the tape is going away and you can see the horse is very little when we had the last moment of the shot. Inmy opinion, the horse is really moving (while suspended).IN TERMS OF EYEWITNESS DESCRIPTIONS IN INTERVIEWS WITH ME OVER THE LAST THREEDECADES, WHEN PEOPLE HAVE SEEN ANIMALS AND HUMANS RISE IN THESE BEAMS OFLIGHT, THE ANIMALS USUALLY AREN’T MOVING. IT IS AS IF WHATEVER THE BEAMTECHNOLOGY IS, IT SOMEHOW PARALYZES OR HOLDS IN PLACE PEOPLE OR ANIMALS.I don’t know if they (alien intelligence) were carrying this horse with a beam, or what? We don’t see thebeam and we don’t see a craft. I don’t know if this is a similar event (to past interviews by Linda), or not? Other Eyewitnesses and High Strangeness in MilanIN THESE LAST 8 MONTHS SINCE OCTOBER 17, 2005, AT 5:07 P.M. – WHICH IS ON THEVIDEOTAPE WHEN THEY WERE VIDEOTAPING – HAVE THEY SEEN ANYTHNG AT ALL REALLYUNUSUAL NEAR THEIR APARTMENT IN MILAN?Yes, they have continual recordings. They sent me some images. I won’t have the new video until I go to Milanof what looks like some kind of robot or humanoid flying very close to them. The images are really startling.But they are just still images. I haven’t seen the video of this (robots) flying. They e-mail me that they havenew events happening very close to them.It’s very important that you see the other videos they have recorded because some of them are the best I’veever seen regarding UFOs. For that reason, I really believe that this couple is having a very particularexperience – like having not just one contactee, but two contactees. But they are not claiming that they havereceived messages or that they have communication. All they say is that they have experiences.And Antonio Urze, he claims that when there is going to be an important event or something in the sky, he feelsit in the chest. When he feels that sensation, he takes the camera and he goes out and he sees the craft. But thatdid not happen with the horse. The horse, he didn’t feel anything. He came out (on the balcony) because Sibilawas calling him.It seems there are many witnesses around Milan regarding these unusual events. Many of the eyewitnesses (inMilan) are policemen. That’s very interesting. Another very important thing regarding the video of the horse isthat Antonio tried to investigate around the area where they live. Somebody had to have lost a horse. But theycould not find anybody who had lost a horse.They (couple) looked honest and sincere to me. They didn’t ask anything for their video. They said I shouldcopyright the videos and give any money to the children of Georgia because as you know, Georgia is feedingmore than 2000 kids every day in Uruguay and Argentina. They gave the rights to all of their material to theGeorgia boys. For me, that looked very nice and proves they don’t want money, they don’t want fame, eventhough he is a designer of clothes, a fashion designer, and she is also a designer and a model. She is a verybeautiful woman. They are a very handsome couple, I would say. They live very well. They are verysuccessful. They are really professionals. I don’t find any reason to believe they are trying to hoax something,or lie about this. All they want is that the case is known around the world. They are not afraid of anything.They are not afraid of criticism. They don’t care about criticism and they are willing to confirm anythingbecause they really believe that the experience is important and is absolutely real. Was It A Sophisticated Balloon?CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOU PLAN TO DO IN MEXICO CITY IN JULY TO TRY TO ANSWER THECRITICISM THAT THIS MIGHT BE SOMEBODY’S HOAX WITH A BALLOON SHAPED LIKE AHORSE?We are going to create a horse and we are going to try to make it fly exactly the same way it looks in the video.We will also take small balloons in the shape of a horse to see how they fly. We will do our best to try toreally replicate to find the real answers. And if what is happening in Milan is really extraordinary. Or is itsomething which could be easily explained?”More Information:I appreciate hearing from Earthfiles viewers and radio listeners about your own firsthand knowledge andexperiences concerning these subjects, or other earth mysteries.
