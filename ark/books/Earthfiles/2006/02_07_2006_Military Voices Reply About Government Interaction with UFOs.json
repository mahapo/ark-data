S. Navy physicist, Bruce Maccabee, about hisdiscussions with a USAF geophysicist referred to as \"Hawk.\" See two-part 012106Earthfiles. I also reported more about former New Mexico State Representative (DonaAna County, Las Cruces) Andrew Kissner's investigations of V-2 rocket research at WhiteSands Proving Ground in 1947 when aerial discs interfered with launches. See \"PeculiarPhenomenon\" Real X-Files series beginning with 121905 Earthfiles.Since these several reports, I have received more than a hundred e-mails from people whohave either firsthand military and/or intelligence backgrounds, or are relatives of peoplewho have such backgrounds. Many have asked that their identity remain anonymous. Ifeel it is valuable to share some of the e-mails and hope other Earthfiles viewers and radiolisteners will contact me with additional information that complements, or goes beyond,what I am posting in this first in a series of Earthfiles military voices.Military Voices Respond to January 20-21, 2006Earthfiles and Radio Reports 1) USAF Radar - Vertically Rising \"Fast Walkers\" (See Update Reply after thise-mail.) \"Please don't use my name. The information I have may, or may not, be ofmuch use to you. But after listening to you on Mr. Noory's program tonight(Jan. 20, 2006), I thought you might be interested.\"My career in the U.S.A.F. spanned nearly twenty-four years, from 1968 to1991. The entire time was spent in radar operations. First as a Scope Operator,ending up as Superintendent of Operations for one of the squadrons atU.S.Space Command located in Colorado Springs, Colorado.\"Through out my career, I tracked hundreds of fast moving objects. I didn'tthink anything much about them until tonight when it was stated that theapproximate speed of UFOs is at least 1500 to 1700 miles per hour. We usedto refer to these objects as 'Fast Walkers' and chalked them up to SR-71's orother experimental aircraft. There were some, however, that did not fit thecriteria of normal aircraft. For example, speeds could vary on a particularradar track from 1500 to over 2000 miles per hour in a matter of seconds.Some would come into range at around 45 to 50 thousand feet and appear tostop or slow to just a few hundred miles per hour, but when they were verifiedon our height finding radar, we found they had not slowed at all, but wereclimbing at a phenomenal rate to above 100 thousand feet within a matter ofseconds.\"In 1976, I was trained in electronic warfare. It was my job to maintain thehighest quality radar reception in any environment. This was back in what Icall the 'old manual days' when one in this field would work a console full offrequency analyzing equipment so that you could 'see' the enemy's jammingsignal and then manually steer your radar's frequency away from it. Sort oflike tuning in a radio station for the best sound. With this specialized training,it was relatively easy to tell the difference from a tangible target and a false"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"return.\"In 1982, I was assigned to NORAD in the Missile Warning Center. There Idiscovered that there really are 'men in black.' Our mission there was to locateany missile launches anywhere in the world. This was done through the use ofinfrared, radar or other means of detection. We would then process the dataand disseminate it to the Pentagon and several other foreword users.\"There were times when we would detect an anomaly and process theinformation as trained. Later, usually before the end of the shift, people wouldcome into the center and request all of the information gathered for theparticular sighting. They would be gone anywhere from a few minutes tohours, and when our log books were returned, the pages were missing thatcontained the data, and we were told that we saw nothing.\"Update Reply to 1):\"I wanted to write to you and verify one of the military e-mail messages thatyou posted on your website (above). The first email, titled USAF Radar -Vertically Rising \"Fast Walkers\". What this person wrote about his time in theNORAD Missle Warning Center is definitley true. From 1983 - 1987, I was anenlisted Air Force computer maintenance tech at Cheyenne Mountain, andfrom 1987 - 1988 I worked in SPADOC and was part of the AutomatedIntelligence Upgrade (AIU) program at NORAD. I had a Top Secret/SCIclearance and was one of a very few techs allowed in every part of thecomplex. I frequently worked in the Missle Warning Center and haveexperienced the very thing he described, down to the visits and theinstructions that came with the visits. It got to be a pretty regular thing. I alsohad access to the Command Post, Space Operations, Intel, SPADOC and othervery sensitive areas. What he mentioned is just the tip of the iceberg.\" 2) U. S. Border Patrol - UFO Interference with Atlas Missiles\"I was just listening to your fascinating report on UFOs. I want to tell youabout something I heard about many years ago in around 1964. I wasstationed with the U.S. Border Patrol at Carlsbad, New Mexico during thattime and had a good friend who worked for the old AEC.One night we were playing cards and drinking some beers. He had been up tothe Las Vegas underground atomic sites and was in Carlsbad for some R&R.His name was JB. He swore us all to secrecy and told us about anunderground air base near Roswell, NM. He said that it was located in thedesert, on what I believe is BLM land, probably 40 or 50 miles northeast ofRoswell. He said that the government had discovered a huge limestonecavern, many times bigger than the Carlsbad Caverns and had developed itinto some kind of underground air base and installation. He said it had a bigretracting door that planes could fly into...I suspect he meant helicopters, as itwould have to have been a huge opening for a jet plane to land in. He said thatthe doors were then retracted and the whole site was invisible as the doorswere covered with sand and looked like the rest of the landscape.We had occasion to drive out in that area with a four wheel drive jeep andcovered a lot of it but never saw anything. The land there is really barren, justmiles of sand dunes. He also said that there was no road leading to the site andeverything came and went by air.There were some other really weird things happening during thosetimes...UFOs, strange events at a couple of the Atlas missile silos aroundRoswell. One event we personally witnessed. Supposedly an Atlas missile hadbeen \"accidentally fired\" while the silo doors were closed. The missilereportedly blew part way through the doors and then exploded. The bad partis that it reportedly had a nuclear warhead on it, and that the warhead hadbeen blown away somewhere by the highway.My partner and I were in the patrol car heading up to Portales, NM when wecame on a state police/AF police roadblock. That was about 4am and it wasstill dark. There were helicopters and vehicles running all over the area onboth sides of the highway. One of the state policeman manning the roadblocktold us what had happened. He said the AF was frantic because they couldn'tfind the warhead. He finally let us through as we were in a marked patrolvehicle with a warning if we saw it not to try to pick it up."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"About a month later we were in Roswell, stopped at the state police office andhappened to run into the same officer who had been at the roadblock. Weasked him what had developed with the lost warhead. He said that the AF hadadvised them that an old Indian had stopped and picked it up and put it in hiscar trunk and drove to St Louis, as I remember. He showed up with radiationburns in the hospital there and that was how they located the warhead.I have asked people who know about such things and they said that the storydoes not sound plausible...the part about an Indian picking it up. They saidthat those warheads were too big for one man to pick up and carry off. So,what the whole thing was all about, I don't know. We also heard that anothersilo had a similar 'accident' later on. Of course all of the silos were abandonedby the AF as was the SAC air base there.I later heard that some of those silo incidents were actually instigated byUFOs in the area, although we didn't hear that from the AF. I think the wholestory of an accidental firing was made up to cover the UFOs being involved.During those times, there were various sightings of UFOs by many people,some by state police officers. Some real strange things happened aroundWhite Sands and Alamogordo during those times, too. One incident told by astate policeman was that all the power went dead on a stretch of the highwaynorth of Alamogordo. His car stopped, all electrical things quit...as with abunch of other cars as far as he could see. Cars just stopped running. Thatwent on for about 15 minutes and then suddenly they all came on andeveryone drove off.I know of one incident where a state policeman saw a UFO land early onemorning. He was able to drive his patrol car up close to where it was parked afew hundred yards off the highway. He got out his accident investigationcamera and shot some film of it before it took off. He then shot photos of themarks it made on the ground. He called the sighting into his dispatcher. Veryshortly after he reported it he was descended upon by some plain clothes menfrom White Sands. They took his camera away from him, took out the filmand he never got it back, according to what he told us.Our friend JB, who worked for AEC...he died of cancer when he was still inhis late 20's. I was not surprised as he told us that he was going down into theholes to retrieve radio gear right after some of the underground A bomb tests.We couldn't believe him when he told us that because any fool would knowthat the radiation had to be tremendous. I suspect that is why he got eaten upwith cancer at such a young age.There were numerous other things that happened in those days around Easternand central New Mexico. We did not know of the 1947 UFO crash however,at the time. That news came later, long after I moved away. I retired from theBorder Patrol in 1990, after 32 years of service.Some of the most vivid UFO sightings I heard about was while I was stationedon the Canadian border in Derby Line, Vermont. That is another story.I hope this helps you out with some of your research. I do agree with youabout the UFO thing. I think the government, for whatever reason, is keepingthe truth from us.\" 3) U. S. Navy - Green Aerial Oval Performed Aerial Patterns\"While at Basic Training for the US Navy, Dec 1966, I was one of about atleast 500 Navy personnel who witnessed a UFO. It looked like an emeraldgreen oval in the dark 04:30 am sky. Our training company was marching tothe galley for breakfast. The incident lasted about 20 to 30 minutes. Fromexiting our barracks to the time we reached the outer area of the galley,the green oval would fly from one horizon to the opposite one in about 1second! When our company finally reached the area just outside the galleyand we were facing south, the oval then shot straight up and stoppeddirectly above us for some time.\"When it finally moved, it started makingthe outline of a staircase, stopping at each vertex momentarily. When itfinally reached down to the horizon it again stopped momentarily. It then"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"flew to a point about 45 degrees above the horizon or half ways up the sky.It again froze in the sky. At that point it got smaller and smaller suchthat we could no longer see it.\"The next day our company commander, aSubmarine Service Chief Petty Officer, told us that the San Diego PoliceDepartment had been flooded with phone calls from the residents of themarina in the immediate area. Also that the two bases in the area (NASMiramar & NAS Coronado Island) had picked the object up on radar and hadlaunched jets to intercept it.\" 4) U. S. Navy Officer - American Military Shooting At Disc Technology\"I wanted to relate the story of my father, who was a U. S. Navy officer from1941 to 1973. From 1962 to 1973, he was a captain and during this period,was granted the highest security clearance, which was referred to as a 'supersecurity clearance.' Naturally, this gave him the ability to see and hear aboutthe most classified material. He was also the Reserve CO of NAS Twin Citiesin Minneapolis from 1969 until the base was decommissioned in 1970.Because of his rank, security clearance, and the fact he possessed a Bachelor'sof Science from Eastern Michigan University, he was selected in 1965 toattend what was called a 'West Coast Weapons Seminar' sponsored by themilitary and contractors Lockheed and Aerojet-General, which together,worked on the Polaris missile project at the time. The meetings took place atthe Naval Base at Point Hueneme, CA., and the emphasis was on propulsionsystems. My father stated that roughly 50 scientists and high-ranking militaryofficers were in attendance.\"Upon listening to your report on COAST, I decided to pose some questions tomy father. Mind you, he had not listened to the show, and in fact, never hasheard Coast to Coast AM. So, of course, his answers could not be influencedby any media. I began asking him if the subject of ETs and UFOs was everdiscussed at this very classified seminar. He initially stated that he reallycouldn't get into specifics of what was discussed. Then I asked if based onwhat he may have heard or seen at the seminar, did he believe ETs existed. Hesaid, 'Well, I would say yes.' After what one calls, a 'pregnant pause,' heactually SHOCKED me by volunteering the following. . .'Well, there was acraft shot down.' I asked, 'What craft was shot down?' He replied, 'A UFO hadbeen shot down some years before - I believe it was the late 1940s.' I asked,'Was it one or more than one?' He stated that, to his knowledge, just one hadbeen shot down. This seemed to dovetail with what you discussed in Earthfilesand the radio.\"He added that the V-2 program you referred to was, he believed, utilizedexclusively by the Navy for the subsequent development of the Polarisintercontinental missile and that the Navy was many years ahead of the otherservices in missile technology.\"As you would understand, none of this material was brought home by himand was strictly 'For Eyes Only' and discourse was only amongst a relativelylimited group of officers and scientists. Although today he is 86, he maintainsa relatively sharp mind and his knowledge of the military remains quiteawesome. As a highly-decorated officer, he always was extremely level-headed and thoroughly professional.\"During his tenure as a captain, he also made visits to NORAD, EllsworthAFB in South Dakota, Offut AFB near Omaha, NAS Roosevelt Roads inPuerto Rico, and served a short time at the Pentagon.\"I used to have quite a bit of skepticism regarding UFOs. Because I alwaysknew my father had a security clearance, I decided that he couldn't impart anyinformation, so I stayed away from asking questions. I regret I waited so long.I appreciated your most interesting radio input and Earthfiles report. I hopethis has been helpful.\" 5) Roswell, NM Military Radar - Pilot Disappeared Pursuing UFO\"I worked with a man named HF who lives in Brush Prairie, Washington(northern suburb of Vancouver, WA) and he worked at radar installations and"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"went on alert for Roswell. He knew of a pilot disappearing in a pursuit of aUFO. He had very high security clearance for communications, was told by(men in black) that some events 'never happened' and were not to bediscussed such as high speed objects being tracked via radar. Even with thepassage of time, he could not even acknowledge Area 51 (Nellis AFB,Nevada) because he did not want to end up in Leavenworth (prison). Hereported firsthand sighting of a 'mothership' in the desert while being stationedthere and reported detecting traces of radioactivity in its trail.\" 6) White Sands Missile Range Commander - Mysterious Disks andRadioactive Light Beam\"A friend of mine in college told me his father was commander of WhiteSands in the 1950s, I believe, and said it was common knowledge during testmissile firings that 'mysterious disks' would swoop in at thousands of miles perhour, follow the (missile) trajectory, and zoom off again. He also said that twoairmen reported to sick bay after being surrounded by a light, and later diedof radiation poisoning.\"Military voices continued in Part 2.More Information:For more information about UFO/E.T. phenomena, please see the following reports inEarthfiles Archives :Â· 02/05/2006 -- Part 11 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collectand Analyze Flying DiscsÂ· 01/27/2006 -- Part 2: Navy Physicist and USAF Geophysicist Discuss UFOs and ETsÂ· 01/20/2006 -- Part 1: Navy Physicist and USAF Geophysicist Discuss UFOs and ETsÂ· 01/17/2006 -- Part 9 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collectand Analyze Flying DiscsÂ· 01/13/2006 -- 31st Cattle Mutilation on Red Bluff, California RanchÂ· 12/21/2005 -- Updated: Part 2 - Peculiar Phenomenon, Early United States Effortsto Collect and Analyze Flying DiscsÂ· 12/02/2005 -- Abduction by Grey ETs in Huge, Black TriangleÂ· 11/11/2005 -- Part 3: An Alleged 1953 UFO Crash and Burial Near Garrison, UtahÂ· 11/10/2005 -- Part 2: An Alleged 1953 UFO Crash and Burial Near Garrison, UtahÂ· 11/02/2005 -- Part 3: Unusual Animal Deaths -Sheep Mutilations in Moortown,Dartmoor, EnglandÂ· 10/27/2005 -- Updated: Five \"Satellites\" That Merged As One StarÂ· 10/25/2005 -- Part 6 - Final: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of AllegedUFOs and Occupants in Military CustodyÂ· 10/13/2005 -- Part 5: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOsand Occupants in Military CustodyÂ· 10/07/2005 -- Part 1: Beam Technology Lifted Body Near Ft.
