The admission that creatures are flying around out there doingwhatever they are doing and we have no control over them amounts to a loss ofcontrol.\" - Bruce Maccabee, Ph.D., U. S. Navy Physicist Return to Part 1 January 27, 2006 Thurmont, Maryland - Back in early 1986, physicist Bruce Maccabeelistened to USAF geophysicist Hawk talk about the \"real Project Blue Book\" as describedin the mid-1960s by his old friend, USAF Lt. Col. Bob Hippler. Hawk had originally metCol. Hippler in Albuquerque when Col. Hippler wanted to know more about thegovernment's knowledge - and cover-up - of E. T.s and their advanced technologiesinteracting with Earth. When Hawk met up with Col. Hippler a couple of years later, hewas living and working in two worlds one real and secret; the other not real and public.Col. Hippler was trying to find a university willing to investigate UFOs for the U. S. AirForce. Dr. Maccabee concluded that Hippler was part of the government cover-up,\"searching for patsies who would be willing to officially come up with the answer the AirForce wanted.\" And what the Air Force wanted was a white wash that would say therewas nothing to UFOs, so the public and media would leave them alone.At the same time, Hippler emphasized to Hawk that there were two Project Blue Books and Hippler worked for the REAL one. It's now assumed that the authority overseeing theREAL Blue Book was the Special Studies MJ-12 group assembled by President Harry S.Truman. MJ-12 was assigned a TOP SECRET MAJIC \"need to know\" about theextraterrestrial biological entities and their very advanced technologies facts that MJ-12decided were better kept to them, in the interest of national security, while they tried toback-engineer whatever E. T. technology they retrieved from crashes, and tried to figureout what the E.T.s wanted.In 1986, Dr. Maccabee talked to UFO researcher/author, William Moore, about the Hawkinterview and Bob Hippler's revelation. Moore tracked Hippler down by phone. But all thereal Project Blue Book investigator said was: it happened a long time ago, he didn't wantto talk about it, goodbye. And click, hung up the phone.Hawk also told Dr. Maccabee about autopsies that had been done on extraterrestrialbiological entities and the terror that military security guards have had and probably stillhave about night duty at sensitive military installations such as Area 51 at Nellis AFB,Nevada; Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque; and others. The reason for their terror? Theappearance of lights in the sky and security guards who disappeared and never returned.Interview:Bruce S. Maccabee, Ph.D., Research Physicist, U. S. Naval Surface Warfare Center,Dahlgren Division; Author, The UFO/FBI Connection, The Secret History of theGovernment's Cover-Up © 2000 and Abduction in My Life © 2001, Thurmont,Maryland: \"Hawk is talking about guards in these areas south of where you (Linda Howe)live in Albuquerque the McCormack ranch and all that. And that the guards in areas nearNellis AFB, Nevada, where he was stationed to monitor nuclear tests (seismic studies.) Hefound out that the guards in these installations were afraid to stay out at night.WHY WERE THEY SO AFRAID?Apparently, they had seen lights in the sky and other things and, according to Hawk,guards had disappeared. When they spent nights in some of these areas, they just weren'tfound the next day. How accurate this is, I don't know. This is what Hawk presumably wastold by other guards who were there."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Non-Human AutopsiesCOULD YOU PLEASE TALK ABOUT AT LEAST SOME OF THE DETAILS THATHAWK TOLD YOU HE UNDERSTOOD ABOUT AUTOPSIES OF WHAT WERECALLED, 'EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES'?Hawk said the Navy doctors had 24 academic degrees among the three of them. Thequestion was: Why do they need that many degrees? The answer was that they studied'humanoids.' The implication being these were not human beings, but of human shape.They also had some Army doctors acting as advisers to the Navy doctors. What Hipplersupposedly said to Hawk was that Hippler was shown photographs of three whole bodiesand bits and pieces of others. Three non-human bodies were autopsied at Wright-PattersonAFB (Dayton, Ohio) and doctors doing the autopsies were astounded. There were noesophagus, no stomach and no reproduction system. The blood was not green, but it wassomehow different (than human). They were like on the order of 4' 8\" to 5' 2\" tall. Theyhad tiny features and tiny bone structure. Their eyes were more slanted than ours, moreOriental. They had long fingers and tiny hands.From Hawk's testimony, if it absolutely correct, he has indicated there has been a majorcover-up from back in the 1950s and 1940s. It's wide and deep, involving things we'veheard about in recent years such as the autopsies of aliens and so on. I think a lot of whatHawk said had never been said before twenty years ago. A lot of it is still unknown to mostpeople - the history of this real Project Blue Book. Also, things we haven't gotten into yetabout things he was told by a guy by the name of Dale Graff, who was in the DefenseIntelligence Agency (DIA). I get the impression that there are a number of secret agenciesof the U. S. government involved and people involved.They treated this subject as if they could talk about it because it was 'not real,' as stated bythe phony Project Blue Book. I asked Hawk why he wasn't breaking security regulationsby talking about this stuff. He said he was told these things never happened and so it wasOK to talk about them. Why Has U. S. Government Lied About Existence ofNon-Humansand Advanced Disc Technology for More Than 50 Years?THEREFORE, HOW COULD YOU CLASSIFY SOMETHING THAT 'DIDN'T EXIST'?Right. I suspect that the government right now is caught in its cover-up tradition. They'veestablished a tradition that there is nothing to flying saucer reports. That tradition wasestablished way back in 1947, or even before, and they stuck to it. If they switched andsaid, 'They are real,' that would swamp the government with people asking questions of'What do we do about it?' and 'What are they doing here?' Those are questions that stillmight not have clear answers. We don't know.BUT IT WAS LIE. THE POLICY HAS ALWAYS BEEN A LIE. WHY SUCH A SERIOUSLIE FOR SO LONG?It could be that the information they are covering up they figure would be extremelydetrimental to civilization if they released it. The other alternative is: they don't know whatis going on and they don't want to admit it. As I said, they've established their tradition thatthere is nothing to it and they are just plain going to stick to it try to keep their headsburied in the sand as long as they can. Dale Graff, Defense Intelligence Agency,and Remote Viewing of Discs[ Editor's Note: Around late 1976 to 1977, Dale Graff, then a physicist with the AirForce's Foreign Technology Division (FTD), gave a remote viewing contract to theStanford Research Institute research team of Hal Puthoff and Russell Targ. Graffwanted to replicate some Soviet psi experiments done in submarines, as well as testthe Soviet hypothesis that psi was transmitted via ELF (extremely low frequency)electromagnetic waves. These test were conducted in July 1977, with the help of"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Ste phan Sc hwartz. See Jim Schnabel, Remote Viewers: The Secret History ofAmerica's Psychic Spies, Dell, 1997, pp. 206-7.)Graff was stationed at Wright Patterson-Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, and hadtaught a class on parapsychology at a local community college. He had also started asmall, informal group of remote viewers at the base. (Ibid. p. 217.)Graff had continued to task SRI on behalf of the Air Force for the next few years. In1980, he won a fellowship for \"exceptional analyst\" within the intelligencecommunity, and planned to take two years off to conduct research in otherlaboratories such as SRI; a psychokenesis lab in Princeton, N. J.; a J.B. Rhine-affiliated lab in Durham, NC; and a Department of Energy lab where microwaveweapons were being studied. His fellowship was revoked by the office of the AirForce Chief of Staff, and with the encouragement of Jack Vorona, he retired fromthe Air Force and moved to the Defense Intelligence Agency, where he ran theAdvanced Concepts Office. (Ibid. pp. 227-8, 334.) Graff served briefly as thebranch chief of the operational unit of Star Gate from around 1982 or 83 until heresigned in summer of 1993. (Ibid. p. 381.) Graff is evidently now touring the newage conference circuit.]WHAT ROLE DID DALE GRAFF FROM THE DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCYPLAY IN THIS PERIOD THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT WITH HAWK?I'm not sure what his role was. Certainly, he told Hawk quite a few things about Air Forceor military activities in respect to aliens and craft. But Dale Graff was plugged stronglyinto the remote viewing stuff. There is an intersection here between way out stuff beyondnormal mental capabilities and UFOs. The RV (remote viewing) guys started up in themid-1970s. We're talking about Hal Puthoff and Russell Targ who got a contract from theC.I.A. to do work at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI in Palo Alto), if I'm recallingcorrectly, to investigate the possibility of remote viewing. To their great surprise, fromwhat I read, some of the remote viewers came up with flying saucers. In other words, theyremotely viewed flying saucers.I personally knew one guy, Eldon Byrd. Byrd happened to work at the Naval SurfaceWarfare Center where I worked at the time. That's how I happened to meet him. Eldonbecame world famous for an experiment he did with Uri Geller using a metal called\"nitinol\" (nickel-titanium) invented at the Naval Research Laboratory. That was so-called'memory metal.' According to Eldon Byrd's description of what happened, Geller by justrubbing the (nitinol) wire - changed its shape memory. Under ordinary circumstances, youwould have to raise it to several hundred degrees Centigrade, to red hot, in order to dothat. Geller was a deep believer in extraordinary mental powers such as remote viewingand telekinesis.Uri with Dr Eldon Byrd and Dr. Ron Hawk (not \"Hawk\" source in Maccabee interview) fromLawrence Livermore Radiation Laboratory.

Right: Uri Geller with WernherVon Braun,V-2 rocket expert who was head of Project Paperclip at White Sands Proving Ground in 1947. Time period:1973-1976.From the RV point of view, you had these RV guys remotely viewing flying saucers quiteby accident. And from the flying saucer side, we had these abductee reports where theabductees talked about hearing words in their head, apparently coming from thesecreatures. But the creatures were not moving their lips and there was no sound involved.It's like direct communication into your brain. That sounds very much like some sort oftelepathy, which is an extraordinary mental ability. This guy, Dale Graff, was some howplugged into both remote viewing and the E.T./UFO research. When Will the U. S. Government Tell the Truth?AFTER SO MANY YEARS OF HAVING RESEARCHED SO MANY E. T. AND DISCCASES OVER THE YEARS, WHAT IS YOUR PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE IN 2006ABOUT WHAT THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT MIGHT DO IN TERMS OFFINALLY TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICALENTITIES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES?I don't think the U. S. government is going to say anything until everything is out theresomehow independently of the government. Then, the government might admit that itknew all along. But I don't think they are going to do anything positive in terms of arelease of information on an official level.WHY?Well, for one thing, I think it's this tradition situation. Another thing, I think if theysuddenly admit it's all real, or some of it is real, they are going to be absolutely swamped itwill almost shut the government down with all the questions that are going to be asked.A third thing is that they might say, 'Well, the information is so unusual or horrendous orwhatever that we're worried about civilization falling apart. We really can't afford to havethat happen yet. (laughs) It really depends on what sort of information they have. Worldwide Animal Mutilations and Human AbductionsDO YOU THINK IT IS THE HARD PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF THE WORLDWIDEANIMAL MUTILATIONS AND HUMAN ABDUCTION SYNDROME THAT ARELARGELY KEEPING THE GOVERNMENT QUIET, ALONG WITH THEIR OWNCULPABILITY IN ATTACKING THE DISCS AND HAVING RETALIATION BY ATECHNOLOGY THAT THEY CANNOT COPE WITH?Certainly, if the U. S. government finally said, 'It's all real and there's nothing we can doabout it' that would be bad news for the government for ALL governments. Whether ornot that is the situation if they think they cannot do anything about it - I don't know. But,like I said, I don't think they are going to say anything until the answer is out there andthen admit they knew it all along.You have to understand, the number of people who are truly in the know is probably verysmall. Most of the government has suffered along with virtually everybody else with whatI call a 'self cover-up.' This subject has such huge import for the human future that nobody"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"really wants to know it's true. The admission that creatures are flying around out theredoing whatever they are doing and we have no control over them amounts to a loss ofcontrol.So, if this is a situation and the government knows we have no control, the governmentrealizes itself it would lose control of the situation if it were to admit that. Of course, itwould have profound implications for our understanding of our place in the universe. Also,the history of the human race might be different from what we think, what we've beentold. Science and religion and economics and all sorts of things would be severelyimpacted. Different Non-Human Types and Agendas?COMPLICATING ALL OF THIS IS WHAT EMERGES FROM SO MANY PEOPLE -WHETHER MILITARY, INTELLIGENCE OR THE ABDUCTION SYNDROME - THATTHERE ARE MORE THAN ONE TYPE OF NON-HUMAN. THOSE TYPES INCLUDETHE SO-CALLED 'BLOND NORDICS' AND 'REPTILIANS' IN ADDITION TO THEGREY EBENS. THEREFORE, IF IT IS A MIXED BAG OF MULTIPLE SPECIES WITHMULTIPLE AGENDAS AND YOU WERE IN THE SHOES OF THE PRESIDENT ANDTHIS GOVERNMENT, WHAT WOULD YOU DO?Give the shoes to somebody else! (laughter)WHICH IS APPARENTLY WHAT EVERYONE HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO DECADEAFTER DECADE.We're talking about something that's related to the ethics of the creatures, or the E. T.s, orwhatever. The fact that they haven't landed and just taken over might be an indication oftheir own ethics. They realize that our society has grown up assuming that we're the onlyintelligent life around and maybe the only intelligent life in the universe. To realize thatwe're not and there are other creatures around doing things that we can't do and we haveno control over, would be a shock to our civilization and it might fall apart.One thing I do worry about is whether the information that filters into the culture is anaccurate portrayal of what these creatures really are. It might be that we really don't know,but any portrayal at all is maybe better than none. Or it could be that the portrayals thatwe are getting are totally wrong and that could be bad. But we just don't know. Left: Drawing by L.

'Earth's Secret War'?If you assume that Hawk's story about a jet attacking and being shot down is true (SeePart 1, Misawa, Japan, Spring of 1959), you have to assume that the government wasoperating on two tracks or maybe that the government got slapped down. We know that in1952 when there was this monstrous amount of sightings, there was even a news storysaying that pilots had been ordered to fire on these objects if they wouldn't land. If youcouldn't get the object to land, shoot at it, basically."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Seattle Post-Intelligencer, July 28, 1952.Even Edward Ruppelt, former head of the USAF (public) Project Blue Book begins hisbook about a pilot who fired on a UFO, a flying saucer.Above: The Report On Unidentified Flying Objects © 1956 by USAF Capt. Edward Ruppelt,former head of the (public) \"USAF Project Blue Book Investigating Flying Saucers.\" Below: Chapter Onebegins with a 1952 summer USAF F-86 jet attack on a disc.LEN STRINGFIELD TOLD ME HE HAD FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE THAT WE HADA STANDING ORDER FROM THE END OF THE 1940S UNTIL AROUND 1952 to1954 TO SHOOT DOWN THE DISC TECHNOLOGY. LEN SAID: 'WE LOST SOMANY PILOTS TRYING TO CARRY OUT THAT ORDER. IT WAS RESCINDED.'Well, I wouldn't be surprised. I don't know about losing a lot of pilots, but I wouldn't besurprised that there had been an order. Then you have Hawk's story about a USAF planebeing shot down or captured by the disc on radar in 1959.ESPECIALLY WHEN I THINK BACK TO A MAN WHO HAD WORKED INWASHINGTON, D. C. IN A HIGHLY CLASSIFIED POSITION AND TOLD ME:'WE'RE DEALING WITH EARTH'S SECRET WAR.' AND IF THAT 'EARTH'S SECRETWAR' WAS GOING ON IN THE 1940S, THE 1950S, AS HAWK KNEW FIRSTHAND,AND INTO THE 1960S AND 1970S - AND PERHAPS EVEN NOW AS WE GO INTOTHE 21ST CENTURY - WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR FUTURE INRELATIONSHIP TO SOMETHING THAT CAN MUTILATE ANIMALS WORLDWIDEUSING A BEAM TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO PEOPLE?Yes. I don't know. But like J. Allen Hynek (Northwestern University astronomer; adviserto USAF; and founder of the Center for UFO Studies, CUFOS) said when asked: 'How doyou live with this stuff?' Allen said, 'I live with it every day as if it were not real.'AND THAT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S OFFICIAL POSITION.(laughs) That IS their official position it isn't real. The big problem is that you don't know"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"what their (E.T.s') goals are. So, you don't know necessarily how to react or what sort ofpolicy to formulate. If they all loved us and we decide to form a policy of retaliation, wemight turn them from friends into enemies.On the other hand, if there are creatures out there slavering to eat us (laughs) and weformulate a policy of love, we might make a nice meal with no resistance at all. So,without knowing exactly what the non-humans are going to do, it's kind of hard to decidewhat sort of 'exopolitics' to develop.THAT MIGHT BE THE REASON WHY THERE HAS BEEN SUCH A STRICTAMERICAN POLICY OF DENIAL FOR MORE THAN 50 YEARS ON A SUBJECT INWHICH IT IS BECOMING VERY CLEAR THROUGH LEAKED DOCUMENTS - ANDPEOPLE LEAKING, LIKE HAWK - THAT OUR GOVERNMENT HAS ATREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT THEY DEFINE AS,'EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES.' THEY DON'T WANT THE PUBLICAND THE MEDIA TO HAVE THE FACTS BECAUSE THE MJ-12 CONTROLLERSSTILL MIGHT BE CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT THE AGENDAS ARE? U.S. Government and E. T. Communications?Yes. You can go beyond Hawk and beyond autopsies of aliens to the idea that there havebeen communications going on. There is the Holloman AFB communication scenario, forexample. Or most recently, the SERPO-type of scenario distributed on the web. (SeeSERPO website link below.)AN EXCHANGE (OF HUMANS) TO ANOTHER PLANET.An exchange, which is really about as far as you can go, I guess. Or if you pick somethinglike the David Jacobs (human abduction investigator) scenario of integration of E.T.s withhumanity by hybridization. Either one of these situations, you would assume that youwould learn a lot about the aliens (in the exchange) in what they are doing, why they aredoing it, how they are doing it, how long it is going to take to get something done whateverthat amounts to.The problem there is that we have very tenuous sources of information, like this guy'Anonymous,' who is telling us all about SERPO. What can you believe? And what can youforget? What is believable and what is not?I WAS TOLD IN THE 1980S THAT WE HAD AN EXCHANGE PROGRAM - PERHAPSBEGINNING ON APRIL 25, 1964, - IN WHICH SOME HUMANS FROM THE UNITEDSTATES WENT TO ANOTHER SOLAR SYSTEM DESCRIBED AS ZETA RETICULI IAND II (37.5 light-years from Earth). ALLEGEDLY, AT LEAST THREE HUMANSWERE THERE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND AT LEAST ONE CAME BACK TOREPORT. IF THAT REALLY HAPPENED, BRUCE, WHY WOULDN'T ALL OF THATINFORMATION HAVE FINALLY BEEN GIVEN TO THE WORLD AS HARD PROOFEVIDENCE OF OTHER INTELLIGENT LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE, UNLESS THERE ISSOMETHING THAT DISTURBS OUR GOVERNMENT?Yes, something about that information might make somebody in the government think it'stoo hot to handle.WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT COULD BE?I suppose that if they were to come out and say, 'We belong to them.' You could ask, 'Isthis any different than religion?' (laughs) But it would really bring things home more. Youhave these creatures presumably coming down and abducting people, mutilating animals,having direct interaction with human lives. We don't know what the non-humans are doingor why they are doing it.BUT THAT THE REASON MIGHT BE BECAUSE THERE IS AN INTIMATEHISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THOSE BEINGS AND THE BEINGS ONTHIS PLANET?Yes, that is certainly possible. And to admit to something like that would cause majorshocks in our culture and cultures of the world.\"More Information:The drawings of different non-humans by eyewitnesses are from my book, Glimpses ofOther Realities, Vol. I: Facts & Eyewitnesses © 1994 and available at the Earthfiles"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Shop.For more about American military aggression against UFOs, crash/retrievals and UFOretaliation, please see reports below in Earthfiles Archives :· 01/17/2006 -- Part 9 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collectand Analyze Flying Discs· 01/09/2006 -- Part 8 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collectand Analyze Flying Discs· 01/03/2006 -- Part 7 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collectand Analyze Flying Discs· 12/31/2005 -- Part 6 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collectand Analyze Flying Discs· 12/27/2005 -- Part 5 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collectand Analyze Flying Discs· 12/24/2005 -- Part 4 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collectand Analyze Flying Discs· 12/24/2005 -- Part 3 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collectand Analyze Flying Discs· 12/21/2005 -- Part 2 - Peculiar Phenomenon, Early United States Efforts to Collectand Analyze Flying Discs· 12/19/2005 -- Part 1 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collectand Analyze Flying Discs· 05/03/2005 -- Part 3: Japan Air Lines Pilot Interview About November 1986 UFOEncounter· 05/03/2005 -- Part 2: Japan Air Lines Pilot Interview About November 1986 UFOEncounter· 05/02/2005 -- Part 1: Japan Air Lines and Mile-Diameter UFO, November 1986,Drawings and Transcript· 04/17/2005 -- 1949 Aerial Disc Covered-Up By Project Blue Book As \"Kite\"· 04/14/2005 -- \"Battle of Los Angeles\" On February 25, 1942: America Fired At AUFO· 02/11/2005 -- Story Behind \"Inflation-Theory Implications for ExtraterrestrialVisitation\"· 12/30/2004 -- Audience Feedback About Earthfiles \"September 12, 1952: America's'Secret War'?\"· 12/30/2004 -- September 12, 1952: America's \"Secret War\"?
