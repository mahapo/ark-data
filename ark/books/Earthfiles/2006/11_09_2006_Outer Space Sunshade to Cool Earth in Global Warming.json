The goal: to keep the world's global temperature cooler.Illustration by University of Arizona Steward Observatory.November 9, 2006 Tucson, Arizona - Even a year ago, I would not have reported about asunshade in space to help cool off our planet in the grip of global warming because anouter space sunshade would have seemed too much like science fiction speculation - notnews.But Earth keeps warming. Greenland, the Arctic and Antarctic keep melting, sea levels arerising and finally the banking/business community is beginning to realize – andacknowledge – that global warming threatens people and economies around the world.The most recent major player on the world economic scene to speak out is Sir NicholasStern in London, the former Chief Economist at the World Bank and head of the BritishGovernment Economic Service. Back in July, England’s Chancellor of the Exchequerasked Sir Nicholas Stern to lead a major review of the economic challenges in this centuryof rapid global climate change and its impacts on Great Britain and the world.On Friday, November 10, 2006, Sir Stern reported to both the Chancellor and PrimeMinister that:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"“The scientific evidence is now overwhelming: climate change presents veryserious global risks, and it demands an urgent global response. ... If no actionis taken to reduce emissions, the concentration of greenhouse gases in theatmosphere could reach double its pre-industrial level as early as 2035.\"That means in the next quarter-century, the average mean global temperature couldincrease rapidly. For perspective, over the last one hundred years of the 20th Century, theaverage global temperature rose one degree Celsius. If, in the next twenty-nine years, itwarms “over 2 degrees Celsius,” a probability warned about in Sir Nicholas Stern’s officialreport, the consequences could be catastrophic for regions of the planet that will beplunged into severe drought while other regions experience excessive rains and flooding.Further, Sir Stern’s report states:“In the longer term, there would be more than a 50% chance that thetemperature rise would exceed 5 degrees Celsius. This rise would be verydangerous indeed; it is equivalent to the change in average temperatures fromthe last ice age to today. Such a radical change in the physical geography ofthe world must lead to major changes in the human geography – where peoplelive and how they live their lives.”In short, global warming now, and for the foreseeable future, is going to cost governmentshuge amounts of money to cope with weather damage and relocation of people oninundated coastlines. Instead of figuring billions of dollars to cope, some are alreadybeginning to talk in trillions of dollars. That’s why a sunshade in outer space between thesun and the Earth is suddenly a serious subject.In astrophysics, there is a name we will probably start hearing more about. It’s theLagrangian points, five positions in interplanetary space between the Earth and sun wherea small object affected by the gravity of the Sun and Earth can theoretically stay in thesame position between the two larger planet and solar bodies. Think of a satellite ingeosynchronous orbit around Earth in a fixed position. But the distance to one of theLagrangian points is a million miles beyond Earth. It's called \"Lagrangian Point 1,\" or\"L-1.\"A physicist from Oxford University now teaching at the University of Arizona in Tucson,has proposed in the most recent issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy ofSciences, a plan to launch trillions of feather-light, very thin, transparent discs into spacewhere they would form a “several million square kilometers cloud” at Lagrangian Point 1between the Earth and the sun. Solar energy would be deflected by those trillions of discsinto a ring that would bypass Earth and theoretically cool our planet by about 2%. Thecost to produce trillions of discs and get them launched into outer space is projected to be“ a few trillion dollars.”The lead scientist on this proposal is Roger Angel, Ph.D., Professor of Astronomy andOptical Sciences in the Steward Observatory at the University of Arizona in Tucson. Italked with him this week about the feasibility of his idea and how long it would take toexecute.Interview:Roger Angel, Ph.D., Prof. of Astronomy and Optical Sciences, Steward Observatory,University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona: “The idea of the sunshade – it’s not analternative to alternative energies or reducing carbon. That we have to do anyway. But theidea of the sunshade is that if we find ourselves in a position where the climate effects thatare very serious seem to be otherwise inevitable. In other words, we already have gotenough carbon in the atmosphere and we find that we are on a track to melt Greenland orsomething that raises the sea level, then the only thing you can do to prevent that would beto explicitly cool the planet.There are ideas, for instance, to put aerosols in the atmosphere, which would mimic theeffect of a big volcano like Pinatubo, which was known to cool the Earth.[ Editor’s Note:"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Mt. Pinatubo, Philippines volcano spewed more than 5 billion cubic metersof ash and pyroclastic debris into the Earth's atmosphere in June 1991.In June 1991, after more than four centuries of slumber, Pinatubo Volcano inthe Philippines erupted so violently that more than 5 billion cubic meters ofash and pyroclastic debris were ejected from its fiery bowels producingeruption columns 18 kilometers wide at the base and heights reaching up to 30kilometers above the volcano’s vent.For months, the ejected volcanic materials remained suspended in theatmosphere where the winds dispersed them to envelope the earth, reaching asfar as Russia and North America. This phenomenon caused the world’stemperature to fall by an average of 1 degree Celsius.]But a cleaner way to cool the planet is to put a sunshade in space. There is a natural point,Lagrangian Point or L-1, which is a million miles toward the sun where if you setsomething orbiting there, then it will kind of stay in line between the Earth and the sun andcan permanently cast a shadow on the Earth.[ Editor’s Note: The Lagrangian points, also Lagrange point, L-point, orlibration point, are the five positions in interplanetary space where a smallobject affected only by gravity can theoretically be stationary relative to twolarger objects such as the Earth and Sun. The Lagrange Points mark positionswhere the combined gravitational pull of the two large masses providesprecisely the centripetal force required to rotate with them. They areanalogous to geosynchronous orbits in that they allow an object to be in a\"fixed\" position in space rather than an orbit in which its relative positionchanges continuously.As seen in a frame of reference which rotates with the same period as the twoco-orbiting bodies, the gravitational fields of two massive bodies combinedwith the centrifugal force are in balance at the Lagrangian points, allowing thethird body to be stationary with respect to the first two bodies.]Contour plot of the effective potential of five Lagrange pointsin relationship to the Earth and Sun.

N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on ClimateChange; other scientific research) have worked out say if there is a doubling of carbondioxide (by the end of this 21st Century) - and that’s a target only if we are fairlyaggressive about switching to renewable energies - we might be able to hold the carbondioxide increase to doubling. (It could go much higher). Then you would need to shadeabout 2% of the sunshine that arrives on the Earth. And so, you need a large area of 'stuff'at L-1 – something like 2% of the area of the Earth – and that’s a few million squarekilometers. So, the problem is – how light can you make this? How could you get thismuch material out there (a million miles from Earth)? I’ve figured out how light you couldmake it, but it would still weigh 20 million tons because there is so much area to fill.What gets launched are the discs a couple of feet in diameter of very thin material instacks, nearly a million discs at a time. I’ve also looked at how you could launch that muchmass and this would be by magnetic acceleration in a technique that was developed atSandia Labs in Albuquerque. When you get out there (at L-1), rather than building a greatbig structure, my idea is to deploy all this material in literally trillions of very small “ spacecraft.” Each one is a couple of feet in diameter and weighs about as much as a bigbutterfly.IT WOULD BE ALMOST LIKE MAKING A BIG CLOUD THAT WOULD REFLECTBACK PHOTON ENERGY FROM THE SUN?It’s very much like a little cloud that sits in front of the sun and dims it down a little bit. Itwould dim it down by no more than thin cirrus clouds – just a very small amount. The lightis not actually reflected back to the sun. It’s just deviated by a small angle enough so thatlight that would have hit the Earth is just deviated a little bit away.Each disc is a couple of feet in diameter. It’s thinner than Saran wrap and it’s imprintedwith some small scale structure on the surface so it diffuses the sun a little bit. As shown inthe graphic illustration, sunlight is diffused into a ring shape. So where the light, if it hadbeen only clear material without inscribed patterns, had gone straight through, the light justgets bent a little bit into a donut – it’s bent a couple of degrees off the original line. That’senough to make it miss the Earth.WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENS TO THE SUNLIGHT?The same as happens to the starlight that gets bent. Instead of heading straight towards theEarth, which is what it would have done if there were no discs there. When light goesthrough a disc, it gets bent by a couple of degrees in all directions. The sunlight spreads outinto a donut shape and misses the Earth, which is in the middle of the donut. Space Sunshade Is MovableWHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS DURING GLOBAL WARMING, THERE ARESUDDEN CHANGES AND WE NEED MORE SOLAR ENERGY?Each of these discs is actually controlled. Unfortunately, this L-1 point in space – if youput something there and you don’t control it, eventually it will wander away. It’s not ableto stay there indefinitely. So in each little 1-gram-disc are rectangular panels which containsome sensors and ways to reflect the sun and put pressure on the individual discs to holdeach one in the right place. At any time, you could send out a signal, which says, ‘Move toone side.’ The discs have in them little solar reflecting panels, or sails, so each disc canmove off to one side. The problem is much more keeping them in line (between the Earthand sun) than it is getting rid of them. Their natural tendency is to wander away. How Urgent Is the Need for An Outer Space Sunshade?HOW SERIOUS DO YOU THINK GLOBAL WARMING IN THIS CENTURY IS ANDHOW MUCH WILL WE PERHAPS NEED SOMETHING LIKE THE SUNSHADEBETWEEN THE EARTH AND SUN?I think there is a very strong consensus of scientists in the field that it is very serious andit’s quite serious in particular for Arizona and New Mexico and the center of the UnitedStates because that looks like it’s going to heat up more than the general average for theplanet.So, it’s a very dire future. If we go on with business as usual, then the normal conditions ofArizona and New Mexico could be more extreme drought than we’ve ever experienced."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"On top of that, snow melt in the Rockies is going to get a lot less because it will melt muchearlier. So, the Colorado River and other rivers that supply us might dry out. It’s prettygrim. That’s not an extremist picture. That’s a generally accepted picture.The largest of the Colorado River-Big Thompson Project's reservoirs,Lake Granby was reduced in parts to mud flats by the ongoing 2004-2006 severe drought,which significantly cut normal spring runoff. Image © 2004 Mark Henle, The Arizona Republic.The question of the speed with which this happens and whether we get into irreversiblethings like Greenland melting and sea level rising by 20 feet – this we don’t understandwell enough how quickly that might happen or whether it would happen. But there’s aprobability of it happening.So, the sunshade idea is like insurance. It’s not something you would implement unless youknew that some fairly dire and otherwise uncontrollable consequences were going tohappen. Then, if you could reverse what seems to be an inevitable ocean rise and thissunshade gadget would do it, you might think it worth paying for and doing it. Cost and Time Line to GetOuter Space Sunshade at L-1HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST AND HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO GET OUTINTO THAT L-1 AREA BETWEEN THE EARTH AND THE SUN?Actually getting there is like a year or something, so that’s not so long. The cost would be afew trillion bucks, the best I can estimate it. The time to do it depends a little bit on howurgently you want to do it. I scaled a time after you get all the launching facilities built,and it would take ten years to get everything up there.TEN YEARS. I KNOW IN SOME OF THE PROJECTIONS RIGHT NOW FOR TENYEARS IN THE FUTURE SHOW THE ARCTIC ICE IN THE SUMMER IS EXPECTEDTO BE OPEN WATER AND GREENLAND IS MELTING FASTER THAN ANYONEHAD PREDICTED.GIVEN THE FACT THAT EVERY YEAR WE SEEM TO BE GETTING SCIENTIFICREPORTS THAT SAY GLOBAL WARMING IS ACCELERATING, WHEN DO YOUTHINK WE HAVE TO DO THE SUNSHADE NOW OR WE WILL BE TOO LATE?WHAT IS YOUR OWN PROJECTED DEADLINE AS TO WHEN THIS MIGHT HAVETO BE DONE?I can’t say that, but I agree with you. Things are speeding up. But you could not attempt avery high tech project like this sunshade without much more research and experimentationto understand the best way to do it. So, what I would advocate is spending some moneynow.Nasa spends $15 billion a year and it seems to me they should spend a few percent of thatlooking at how they might do constructive things to help the global warming problem. Mypresent grant from NASA is $70,000 to look at this a bit more. I would like to see hundredsof millions of dollars go into it – that kind of money could really start to answer thequestions. So whereas I’m guessing it might cost a few trillion dollars, if we put somemoney into research, we would know more exactly.WHAT IS NASA’S RESPONSE?At the moment, they are too busy with other things. And as you know, the national priorityset by the Administration is not very high in this area of global warming challenges.IF THE SUNSHADE DOESN’T GET FUNDED AND DOESN’T GET LAUNCHED,WHAT IS YOUR GREATEST WORRY?My worry at the moment is that we need to study ways to cool the planet, like thesunshade and sulfur in the atmosphere or increasing clouds or making more ice on the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"oceans. There are many possible alternatives to reducing the heat input from the sun. Ithink we need to look at them all very hard now and invest money in the research, alongwith a big effort in renewable energy and ways to cut carbon. These are complementary.We have to cut carbon anyway. But these ideas like the sunshade are in case we just can’tmove fast enough. We’ve already put a huge amount of carbon in the atmosphere andwe’re just beginning to see the effects of that. And if it turns out those effects are very badalready, then for the coming hotter future, we need something like the sunshade.IS THERE ANYBODY WHO IS STANDING BY AND IS READY TO MAKE THESEMANY TRILLIONS OF SUNSHADES THAT COULD BE LAUNCHED?The technique of mass production would have to be increased even more than anything wemass produce now. I think we could mass produce now in quantities of millions. We wouldhave to learn how to mass produce in quantities trillions. That’s a new level of massproduction.WHEN YOU SAY THAT, IS ONE OF THE BIG STUMBLING BLOCKS THAT A LOTOF PEOPLE WOULD SAY IT’S AN INTERESTING IDEA, BUT IT’S NOT FEASIBLETO DO?I think at the moment we don’t know how to bring the costs down enough. I quoted in theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences paper that mass production of high techthings like laptop computers is presently about $100 per kilogram if you bought laptops bythe pound! (laughs) We have to get the price of these little discs down to about$20/pound. They are comparable in complexity to a laptop – maybe a bit simpler.Similarly for the launching, we have to learn a lot. At least I can show that the energyneeded to do this electro-magnetic launch is quite affordable. This is how I came up withmy cost estimate of a few trillion dollars. How Long to Produce and Launch Sunshade to L-1?BUT IF YOU WERE FUNDED TO DO THIS AND THE WORLD SAID, ‘YES, WENEED TO DO THIS,’ IT MIGHT TAKE AT LEAST 20 YEARS TO GET ALL OF THISPRODUCED, LAUNCHED AND IN PLACE?Yes, it would take at least that long. In the meantime, other techniques like putting sulfurin the atmosphere are sort of quicker fixes for cooling the planet. So, sulfur wouldprobably be the first line of defense, such as creating artificial volcanoes. But they arefairly short-lived. So, the space sunshade would be a longer term fix that would give usmore time to cut CO2 levels and so on.IF WE PUT SULFUR IN THE ATMOSPHERE AS A FIRST STEP TO REDUCING THEIMPACT OF GLOBAL WARMING, WOULDN’T WE THEN HAVE ANOTHERPROBLEM OF ACID RAIN?It turns out that already far more sulfur is being put into the atmosphere than you need tocontrol global warming. It’s just that it doesn’t go into the stratosphere where it’s useful.So you could actually produce acid rain and the amounts of sulfur in the higher parts of theatmosphere where they would do the cooling job.MEANING THERE MIGHT BE AN ATMOSPHERIC LEVEL WHERE THE SULFUR ISNOT GOING TO PRECIPITATE DOWN IN RAIN?Yes, if you go high in the stratosphere, it does a better job of scattering back sunlight. Andit also precipitates out much more slowly than from the lower part of the atmosphere. So,you can actually have your cake and eat it, too. You can produce acid rain and increasethe scattering in the high atmosphere. Natural Variability of Earth's Warming and CoolingWHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT THEEARTH HAS BEEN GOING INTO GLOBAL WARMING, AS FAR BACK AS THEDINOSAURS, IN CYCLIC PERIODS AS WELL AS ICE AGES? WHATEVER WE AREENTERING NOW MIGHT BE SOME NORMAL CYCLE OF THE EARTH AND WEBETTER NOT TAMPER WITH IT?No serious scientist, I think, is saying that. The evidence that this is manmade by fossil fuelburning is overwhelming."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"AND THE CONSEQUENCES BY THE END OF THIS 21ST CENTURY COULD BEWHAT?Pretty severe in places on the planet where it goes hotter than average. It’s extremelyunpleasant. And people who live near the present sea level – there are hundreds of millionsof them. If the sea rises 20 or 30 feet, that’s the end of their cities. The level of damage ispotentially enormous. On that scale, the space sunshade, I believe, would last 50 years. Ifit costs $5 trillion bucks, that’s $100 billion/year. This is much less than 1% of world GDP(gross domestic product). So, even though in absolute terms, the sunshade is veryexpensive, in terms of cost savings to the planet, it’s almost negligible.\"More Information:For further information about global warming, please see reports below in the EarthfilesArchives:• 09/09/2006 -- Methane - Another Threat in Global Warming• 08/23/2006 -- Solar Cycle 24 - Headed for Intense X Flares by 2010-2012?• 08/19/2006 -- Repair of Earth's Ozone Layer Has Slowed• 07/18/2006 -- 2006 - Hottest Year So Far in U.
