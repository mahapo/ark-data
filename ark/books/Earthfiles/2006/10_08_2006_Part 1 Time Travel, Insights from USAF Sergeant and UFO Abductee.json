They need chromosomes....(They are using us) Like Band-Aids.\" - USAF Staff Sergeant James PennistonOctober 8, 2006 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Time travel technology has come up somuch over the years in both the abduction syndrome and military/intelligenceconversations, on and off the record.But in addition to human time travelers from a distant, damaged future trying to survive,there is no question in my mind that our government has been trying to cope for at leastsixty years with a wide variety of \"extraterrestrial biological entities,\" which interface withEarth and also use time travel technologies.The complexity of the phenomena and the many unknown agendas keep power-humans instraightjackets. Then when you add the global animal mutilations and human abductionsyndrome to the mix, a policy of strict denial about it all was, and is, provoked.But I keep doing my work because I do not agree that lies and denials are ever the correctpolicies - especially in a country that is supposed to be a \"government of the people, by thepeople, and for the people.\" The following was first presented in my book, Glimpses ofOther Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness © 1998. Christmas week in December 1980 was a tense and confusing time for several dozen menat the joint United States and English Royal Air Force Base at Bentwaters near thesoutheastern coast of the British Isles. In the early morning hours of December 26, oddlights were seen moving in the Rendlesham forest and various security and militarypersonnel investigated.Two of the security men, Staff Sergeant James Penniston and Airman First Class JohnBurroughs, had a close encounter with one of the lights. From that time onward, Pennistonhas had haunting memories and dreams of both the night in the forest and a follow-updebriefing session by intelligence agents who apparently used a drug and hypnosiscombination to retrieve further information from Penniston and to possibly erase part ofhis memory.On September 10, 1994, Jim Penniston volunteered to undergo hypnosis with ahypnotherapist to remember more details of the Bentwaters AFB incidents and his owninvolvement in t hem. The following is a summary with verbatim excerpts from that 1994hypnosis session, which I transcribed from an audiocassette recording.Penniston remembered having Christmas Day dinner on December 25, 1980, with hisfamily. Then he returned to work that night at Bentwaters AFB. The hypnosis sessionbegan with Penniston describing the appearance of blue and red lights moving in the forestat the East Gate of Bentwaters around 2 a.m. in the early morning of December 26, 1980.Afterward, there were a series of meetings and debriefings with superior officers.Lt. Col. Charles I. Halt, Deputy Base Commander at Bentwaters, told Penniston, \"Thereports will remain confidential and we should treat the incident as Top Secret and notdiscuss it with anybody.\"Penniston remembered being told there was radiation where the lights had been, a dosageequivalent to \"five or ten x-rays.\"After his encounter with lights, Penniston received a call to report on December 30, 1980,to the Orderly Room at the head of the 81st Security Police Squadron, Bentwaters. ThereMajor Malcolm Zickler ordered Penniston to report to the Air Force Office of Special"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Investigations (AFOSI) for a meeting to tell his story to AFOSI Special Agent \"G.\" Presentalso was Major \"B.\" AFOSI's task is to investigate Air Force personnel crimes and othersensitive matters. Therefore, it is the only organization that can legally intrude into thecommand structure at any level without commanders having full knowledge.Penniston knew he had purposely left out the most significant part of his encounter:approaching a white light, seeing a large disc-shaped craft with raised symbols on itssurface, reaching out to touch the symbols and receiving binary code information.Penniston was asked to wait while the officers talked outside in the hall with unidentifiedmen. Through the wall, Penniston overheard the name \"D. S. 8 or A,\" or \"D. C. 8 or A.\"Most likely it was DS8, Britain's Ministry of Defence Secretariat \"responsible for dealingwith complaints of low-flying aircraft,\" according to Sky Crash about the December 1980Bentwaters AFB mystery © 1984 by Brenda Butler, Jenny Randles and Dot Street.Agent G returned to introduce two more men who asked Penniston to repeat his story asecond time. He did, but again left out touching the raised symbols on the craft's hull.Then Agent G left to confer privately outside his office yet again and two other agentscame back to tape record the third telling of Penniston's story. Excerpts from September 1994 Hypnosis SessionWith Former USAF Staff Sergeant James PennistonEvent: Lights and Disc EncounterBentwaters AFB, England, December 26, 1980The agents asked Sgt. Penniston to sign a release so he could be given Sodium Pentothal(thiopental) combined with hypnosis. Thiopental is a barbiturate, which inducesunconsciousness smoothly and rapidly and has been referred to as a \"truth serum\" whenused with hypnosis techniques. The agents told Sgt. Penniston the session would berecorded by two tape recorders. Penniston said he agreed \"to get them off my back. Theyseemed a lot happier after I signed the release.\"Penniston remembered that the agents at Bentwaters had him \"lay down on a walnuttable\" and that a \"British guy\" got the needle ready. An American said the procedurewould not hurt, that \"it's standard procedure and not to worry about it. We've done itbefore.\"The questions began about the lights that appeared at the Bentwaters AFB Eat Gate atzero, zero, zero, two hours (00:02 AM) on December 26, 1980.

Mathematical theory says that ifmatter approaches the speed of light, time appears to slow down to an external observer. Ifyou were the matter, you would notice no difference in time. The closer you got to thespeed of light, c, the slower time would go. If you reached c, time would stop. Then if youcould exceed c, time would reverse - but only to the outside observer. You, the travelergoing faster than light, would have no reference point for time change until you returned toyour physical starting point on Earth, for example, and slowed back down to normalspeeds. Then you would find you had returned to the past like the famous limerick:There once was a lady named Brightwho traveled much faster than light.She departed one day in a relative wayand came home the previous night.Theoretical physicist Kurt Godel described in his book, Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist, a particular kind of rotating galaxy in which \"by making a round trip on a rocketship in a sufficiently wide curve, it is possible in these worlds to travel into any region of"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the past, present and future, and back again, exactly as it is possible in other worlds totravel to distant parts of space.\"This state of affairs seems to imply an absurdity. For it enables one, for example, to travelinto the near past of those places where he has himself lived ... But the velocities whichwould be necessary in order to complete the voyage in a reasonable length of time are farbeyond everything that can be expected ever to become a practical possibility: ...thevelocity of the ship must be at least one over the square root of two of the velocity oflight.\"Repeating what Penniston recalled in hypnosis:British Ministry of Defence Memo that references \"several entitiesnear RAF Bentwaters on the night of December 29/30 1980.\" The date discrepancywith Jim Penniston's account is because several events took place over several nights."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"January 13, 1981, report to the Royal Air Force/CC by Bentwaters USAFDeputy Base Commander, Lt.
