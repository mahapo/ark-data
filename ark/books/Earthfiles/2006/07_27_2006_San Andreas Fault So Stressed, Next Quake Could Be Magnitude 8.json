There is about a 70% likelihood of a largeearthquake within the next 30 years.\" - Seismologist Debi Kilb, Ph.D. Blue triangles indicate 2006 small quake activity along San Jacinto Fault, Elsinoro Fault,and Rose Canyon Fault, while the San Andreas Fault near the Salton Sea is building more andmore energy in a \"locked up\" mode, moving only 1 inch per year. Map source: USGS.July 27, 2006 La Jolla, California - Last month, the June 22, 2006, issue of the science journal Nature,published recent detailed research of the San Andreas and San Jacinto faults in Southern California. The datashows the San Andreas so stressed that its next quake release of energy could be a magnitude 8 on the Richterscale. The San Andreas Fault is considered the main boundary between the Pacific and North Americantectonic plates that are slowly moving past each other. Some day in the far distant future, those moving platesmight even break off sections of the Pacific coast into the ocean. The tension between those moving plates iswhat makes California \"earthquake country.\"[ Editor's Note: USGS reports that earthquake magnitude \"is a measure of the size of anearthquake. The Richter Scale, named after Charles F. Richter of the California Institute ofTechnology, is the best known scale for the measuring of magnitude (M) of earthquakes. Thescale is logarithmic; a recording of 7, for example, signifies a disturbance w ith ground motion10 times as large as a recording of 6. The energy released by an earthquake of M 7, however,is approximately 30 times that released by an earthquake of M 6; an earthquake of M 8 releases900 times (30x30) the energy of an earthquake of M 6. An earthquake of magnitude 2 is thesmal lest earthquake normal l y fel t by humans. Earthquakes w i th a Ri chter val ue of 5 or higherare potentially damaging. Some of the w orld's largest recorded earthquakes--on January 31,1906, off the coast of Colombia and Ecuador, and on March 2, 1933, off the east coast ofHonshu, Japan--had magnitudes of 8.9 on this scale, which is open ended.\"As the Richter scale does not adequately differentiate between the largest earthquakes, a new\"moment magnitude\" scale is being used by seismologists to provide a better measure. On themoment magnitude scale, the San Francisco earthquake is estimated at magnitude 7.7 comparedto an estimated Richter magnitude of 8.3.\"Intensity is a measure of the strength of shaking experienced in an earthquake. The ModifiedMercalli Scale represents the local effect or damage caused by an earthquake; the \"intensity\"reported at different points generally decreases away from the earthquake epicenter. Theintensity range, from I - XII, is expressed in Roman numerals. For example, an earthquake ofintensity II barely would be felt by people favorably situated, while intensity X would produceheavy damage, especially to unreinforced masonry. Local geologic conditions stronglyi nfl uence the i ntensity of an earthquake. Commonl y, sites on soft ground or al luvi um haveintensities 2 to 3 units higher than sites on bedrock.\"]To put a magnitude 8 earthquake into perspective, one hundred years ago on April 18, 1906, San Franciscowas hit by an early morning earthquake between magnitude 7.7 and 7.9. That quake ruptured the northernmostsection of the San Andreas fault for 296 miles. From San Juan Bautista to Cape Mendocino, that 1906earthquake stunned geologists with its huge horizontal displacement in the Earth's crust. At least 3,000 peopledied. Broken gas pipes set the city on fire."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The earthquake hit at 5:12 a.m. local time on April 18, 1906. This photograph shows Sacramento Streetas fire approaches.

He combined the visualimagery with data from historic geological records, Global Positioning System readings and current seismicinstruments stationed every 20 meters. The result is a study with a factor of a thousand times improvement inspatial resolution.Prof. Fialko found more evidence that the southern San Andreas fault is \"mostly locked up.\" Not being able tomove forward much, the fault builds up stress. Currently, the Southern California San Andreas is only movingabout one inch per year. According to Prof. Fialko, that means during the last 300 years, the southern SanAndreas fault has accumulated so much locked up energy that when it finally breaks that lock, the resultingearthquake will be huge - between magnitude 7 and 8. This also means that the city of Los Angeles or the SanBernardino/Riverside region could be hit by a seismic event as big as the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.When could the next big one happen in Southern California? The research indicates a 70% chance in the nextthirty years.Prof. Fialko was surprised to learn that the San Jacinto Fault, a little west of the San Andreas, is moving atabout twice the speed as earlier estimates. So, the San Jacinto Fault has built up a lot of energy which couldbreak out in a magnitude 7 earthquake. What if both the San Andreas and San Jacinto Faults erupted at thesame time? Seismic engineers at UCSD Jacobs School of Engineering's Englekirk Structural EngineeringCenter have been testing buildings on a \"shake table\" to see what various intensities of shaking can do.On January 14, 2006, a 7-story building built on their 25 foot by 40 foot shake table was subjected to groundmotions equivalent to the January 17, 1994, Northridge earthquake. What the engineers are learning is thatwood frame construction will collapse. But smaller concrete and reinforced steel frames will survivepowerful earthquakes with only minor damage. The research from several years of work on the shake tables atUCSD have also caused most of Southern California's freeway bridges to be retrofitted to withstand severeground shaking. The problem is that a magnitude 8 earthquake could seriously affect several square mileswherever it hits. Older homes and buildings built from wood frame construction could collapse in hugenumbers.This week I talked with Prof. Debi Kilb, a seismologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla.She worked with Prof. Fialco on his San Andreas and San Jacinto Fault investigations and begins with thequestion that Prof. Fialco wanted to answer.Interviews:"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"De bi Kilb, Ph.D., Se ismologist, Scripps Institution of Oce anography, University of California-San Die go,La Jolla, California: \"What’s the probability that w e’re going to have a large earthquake, magnitude 6, 7 or8, on the southern part of the San Andreas Fault? There is about a 70% likelihood of a large earthquake withinthe next 30 years. If you look at the southern part of the San Andreas Fault and ask how long is it? It’s about100 miles long. So how large can an earthquake be on a 100-mile-long fault segment? The answer is amagnitude 7 or 8.For the San Jacinto Fault, which is parallel to San Andreas – just further to the west – it’s not quite as long andthe largest one we expect to occur on the San Jacinto Fault is only a magnitude 7.BUT THAT’S BIG.It is definitely big.SINCE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT TWO FAULT LINES WITH BOTH HAVING A POTENTIAL TORELEASE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN A MAGNITUDE 7 AND 8 WITHIN THE NEXT 30 YEARS,THAT’S GOING TO HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES ON THE LARGE POPULATIONS THAT LIVEWHERE BOTH OF THOSE FAULTS ARE.That’s right. It’s not necessarily within the next 30 years that we expect it. We expect the earthquake couldhappen today, tomorrow, or maybe even 100 years from now (with a 70% chance it will occur in the next 30years, according to Prof. Yuri Fialko's study). What would that mean for the nearby communities? One thingwe worry about is what direction will the earthquake rupture? If the earthquake goes from the south to thenorth, all the energy is going to be directed to the north. In that case, those folks in Los Angeles will feel thebrunt of it much more than those folks to the south.On the other hand, if the earthquake ruptures from the north to the south, most of that energy is going to be goingsouth. In that case, people in Mexico would get more of the brunt than people to the north. So rupturedirectivity really plays a role in terms of who is going to get hit most, what’s going to be the structuraldamages, and what kind of ground motions are we going to expect.HAVE YOU DONE ANY COMPUTER MODELING THAT GIVES ANY INDICATION ABOUT WHICHMIGHT HAPPEN MORE THAN ANOTHER?There have been all kinds of modeling that has gone on. But you can think of it as dominoes. We don’t knowexactly what the small-scale fault structure is. If you imagine lining up dominoes and someone gets to take outten or twenty of them and add in another thirty, what’s going to happen when you hit the system is that it’sreally going to change. But we can do an overall study and ask: what are the general characteristics? What arethe things that we absolutely know and then incorporate the uncertainties.HOW DOES THAT COME OUT IN TERMS OF WHAT MIGHT PROBABLY HAPPEN?That’s where they got the 70% likely within the next 30 years, and could be as long as a hundred years. An 8can be very devastating. As you said, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake was approximately a magnitude 8earthquake and very devastating for that city. San J acinto Fault Moving MoreRapidly Than ExpectedWhat the Fialco study also showed is that the rate of movement on the San Jacinto fault is twice as big as weexpected. What this means is that it will probably have twice as much energy released in the same period oftime than previously expected.Does that mean we’re going to have an earthquake today or tomorrow? Not necessarily. Just that the rate istwice as high. One thing is that the plate tectonic boundary there – most people think that the San Andreas Faultis accommodating most of the plate tectonic movement. But the Fialco study is showing that some of that(movement) is being accommodated by the San Jacinto Fault right next door. So, the San Andreas Fault and theSan Jacinto Fault are two major players in how the plate tectonic stresses are being accommodated in thatregion.WOULD YOU SAY IT’S A GOOD GUESS THAT THE SAN ANDREAS FAULT WILL ERUPT FIRST?Your guess is as good as mine. These things have a repeat time of about 300 years. We haven’t been studyingthem for longer than about 600 years or so. We don’t really have the repeat time and data to tell us that.THE AREAS THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED THE WORSE GIVEN AN 8 MAGNITUDE ON THE SANANDREAS, WOULD BE WHICH SECTION ON THE SAN ANDREAS FAULT?It would be right under where the earthquake occurred. So, if we had an earthquake that occurred just east ofthe Salton Sea, that region would feel the brunt of it. So, the closer you are to the earthquake rupture, typicallythat’s w here you are going to have the most damage.WHAT DO THE COMPUTER MODELS INDICATE MIGHT BE THE MOST LIKELY PLACE TO ERUPT?One thing they have modeled is looking at a rupture in the southern part of the San Andreas Fault and if itruptures from the south to the north up tow ards Los Angeles, the L. A. basin kind of rings like a bowl of jelly.When you get that going on, you can think of waves washing back and forth. These are waves in hard rock andthat’s going to cause a lot of damage.WOULD YOU HAVE THE SAME CONCERN WITH THE SAN JACINTO FAULT?Yes, because that fault is just a little further to the west there."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RELEASE 7 ON THE RICHTER SCALE?Approximately, yes. We don’t know if they are going to all rupture all at once in one large earthquake? Or in aseries of smaller earthquakes, magnitudes 5s and 6s?WHAT IS YOUR OWN SPECULATION ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN?I just always think: Be prepared, not scared. We don’t have enough data to favor one over the other. What Should People Do During Earthquakes?AS A PERSON STUDYING SEISMOLOGY, WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND TO THE PUBLIC IS THEBEST THING TO DO IF YOU’RE IN A HOUSE OR APARTMENT OR STRUCTURE?The first thing you w ant to do is figure out w here you are almost every day all day. If you spend 8 hours at yourdesk, look around and see what might fall on you. If you have your bowling ball collection above you, youmight w ant to move it down to a lower level. If you have an insecure ceiling fan that’s just hanging on by onewire, you might want to secure that.Just some simple ten minutes to look around and say, ‘What could fall on me and where can I move things?’That will really help you. If you can bolt a bookcase down so you are not buried by books.IS IT TRUE THAT IF YOU ARE IN A BUILDING AND IT REALLY BEGINS TO ROCK AND ROLLTHAT YOU SHOULD RUN FOR A DOOR FRAME AND BRACE YOURSELF IN THAT FRAME?You really need to know what the construction is like. Take a look at the construction. If that doorframe isframed on either side by large windows that could crack and fall and generate a whole slew of broken glass,then you don’t want to be there, especially if you are hanging out in your bare feet. So, use common sense. Say,‘Wherever I go today, I’m going to look around and say, ‘If there is a large earthquake that’s going to occurnow, where do I want to go?’ If I decide I want to go under this one desk, am I going to have to fight withtwenty other people who also want to get there?IS THERE EVER A REASON TO RUN OUT OF A BUILDING INSTEAD OF STAYING IN IT?If you have time and you can get somewhere w here you can be assured that nothing will fall on you – like themiddle of a large grassy field is a nice spot to be.BETTER THAN BEING INSIDE OF A BUILDING SOMETIMES?If you are in the middle of a field and nothing can fall on you, it’s much better.WHAT DO YOU PERSONALLY WORRY ABOUT THE MOST?That I’ll be out of town and an earthquake will happen. (laughs)BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE THERE?Yeah, I want to be there!IF YOU WERE THERE, WHAT WOULD BE THE FIRST THINGS YOU WOULD DO?Well, safety first, of course. And then it would be check the seismic instruments. Where was it located? Didall our seismic instruments record it? Were there precursor signals? Where are the aftershocks going to occur?Basically go into my scientific mode.\" \"Shake Tables\" Helping Engineers StrengthenCalifornia Structures in Earthquakes"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"January 14, 2006 \"shake table\" test of 7-story building built specifically to test its strengthin a seismic shaking equivalent to the January 17, 1994, Northridge earthquake.

Image courtesy UCSD.Another UCSD professor has spent most of his career in the engineering department concentrating on how tostrengthen freeway bridges throughout California so they can better hold up in big earthquakes. He is FriederSeible, Ph.D. Since 2002, Dr. Seible has been Dean of the Jacobs School of Engineering and now serves asChairman of the California Department of Transportation's Seismic Advisory Committee.This week I discussed with him Prof. Yuri Fialko's research, which indicates that both the San Andreas Faultand the San Jacinto Fault are stressed to such an extent that there is a high probability over the next 30 to 100years of at least one 7 to 8 magnitude earthquake in Southern California. In the event of a magnitude 8, I askedDean Seible how many square miles might be affected and how many people might die?Interview:Frieder Seible, Ph.D., Dean of the Jacobs School of Engineering, University of California-San Diego, andChairman of the California Dept. of Transportation's Seismic Advisory Committee: \"If we do have amagnitude 7 or 8 earthquake in the L. A. basin or in the San Bernardino/Riverside area, that this is an areawhere several square miles will be affected by strong shaking.We have been going in California to a retrofit program of all of our state-owned bridges for the last 17 years,since the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. We have essentially retrofitted maybe all but 5 or 6 of the state-ownedbridges in California. So, I would expect, for example, that our transportation infrastructure in the Los Angelesarea or San Bernardino/Riverside region that there will not be a lot of collapsed structures and a lot of loss oflife, even in a magnitude 7 or 8 earthquake. But we will see damage to these structures.On the building infrastructure side, we have still a lot of buildings of older vintage, which have not necessarilybeen retrofitted. So we can still expect significant damage and losses in all types of buildings. It’s not just onespecific type. You have seen in the Northridge earthquake that we had significant damage in wood frameconstruction, which people did not expect before that. So, since most of our residential construction here inCalifornia is wood frame construction, we would again expect in a bigger earthquake in L. A. or SanBernardino/Riverside also significant damage in this type of construction.COULD THE DEVASTATION BE IN SOMETHING LIKE 100 SQUARE MILES? 50 SQUARE MILES?HOW MANY SQUARE MILES OF DAMAGE COULD THERE BE?It’s very unlikely it w ill be hundreds of square miles. But depending upon the length of the fault that ruptures, itcertainly can be in the tens of squares miles.IS THERE EVER AN ARGUMENT FOR RUNNING OUTSIDE AS OPPOSED TO STAYING INSIDE?Certainly when you talk about residential areas, by all means. Because typically our buildings are one to twostories and if you get 20 to 30 feet away from your 2-story building, it can collapse and it won’t hurt you. Butw hen you talk about dow ntow n Los Angel es w here you have al l the hi gh-ri se buil di ngs, I don’t think i t makes abig difference if you are inside or outside if a building comes down.WHAT DO YOU PERSONALLY WORRY ABOUT THE MOST AS THE WORST CASE THAT COULDHAPPEN?In a big earthquake, the thing we worry most about is that we do get a lot of casualties and injuries. This iswhat we are most concerned with as structural engineers and to make sure that our structures in the endprovide a level of what we call ‘live safety.’ This is what we are striving toward. But in a big earthquake likewhat you are referring to, this is not over right after the earthquake. That’s when the problems really startbecause a lot of the economy will be interrupted just to get to the casualties in a first responder mode will bevery difficult because even though a lot of our freeway bridges may stand up, but there will be other structureswhich have fallen across the freeway and you still won’t be able to use the freeway system. Or that we havebig settlements behind our bridge abutments where you can still not use the freeway, even though the bridge isstill standing. It will be very difficult in the end to first perform the immediate emergency response for searchand rescue and then to provide the necessary emergency services for the survivors of the earthquake. We see"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"that in other countries around the world, what the problems are. I think it can be very similar here in one of ourbig urban environments if we get a magnitude earthquake of the size you are describing.IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT IF AN 8 MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE HAPPENED TOMORROW OR THISWEEKEND, THAT THE BRIDGES THAT YOU HAVE REINFORCED MIGHT HOLD UP, BUT THATGIGANTIC SECTIONS OF LOS ANGELES MIGHT COLLAPSE?We will have damage to our bridge infrastructure. We will have damage to our building infrastructure. I thinkin the end, big areas of Los Angeles can and will be affected, and it will be very difficult to have traffic inthose areas and move around.THEN YOU HAVE THE PROBLEM OF HOW DO YOU HELP PEOPLE? HOW DO YOU GET WATERAND SERVICES? THERE COULD BE A MAJOR DISRUPTION FOR AS MUCH AS A WEEK?It can be a week or even longer than a week, depending upon the extent of the damage. It can be several weeks.Maybe even a month.\"More Information:Large San Andreas Fault EarthquakesWikipedia:\"1857 Fort Tejon Earthquake — 350 kilometers were ruptured in central and southernCalifornia.
