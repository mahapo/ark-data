Source: Journal of Virology. March 21, 2006 Lajolla, California - The World Health Organization (W.H.O.) in Geneva, Switzerland, isconcerned that with each new case of bird flu in humans, the possibility that the virus could mutate into a formtransmissible from human-to-human increases. Once that happens, it's a worldwide influenza pandemic. Ithappened in 1918 and that pandemic killed fifty to one hundred million people around our planet, dependingon various sources. Modern research on skeletons of some of those victims has revealed that the binding sitesof the 1918 influenza virus had similar characteristics to those in the new lethal strain of H5N1 bird flu. It'salso educated medical opinion that the 1918 pandemic flu strain first originated in birds and mutated insidehuman hosts to move person-to-person. \"With continued outbreaks of the H5N1 virus in poultry and wild birds, further human cases are likely. Thepotential for the emergence of a human-adapted H5 virus, either by re-assortment or mutation, is a clear threatto public health worldwide,\" says Ian Wilson, D. Phil., a Scripps Research professor of molecular biologyand head of the laboratory that conducted recent research on a technology called the glycan microarray. Themicroarray is more efficient in searching for virus binder shifts and the goal is to take the array to variousH5N1-infected parts of the world and efficiently look for any H5N1 mutations that could signal easiertransmission in humans. In the March 16, 2006, issue of the journal, Science, Dr. Wilson explained his new research with the glycanmicroarray and its investigation of the hemagglutinin (HA) binders in the Viet04 strain of H5N1 that killed a10-year-old Vietnamese boy in 2004. That strain is referred to as: A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (Viet04). How Influenza Viruses Take Hold in Bodies Animal and human cells have what are called “receptors.” Viruses get a foothold in bodies by creating sites ontheir surfaces which can bind to specific cell receptors. The virus does that by changing, or mutating, itshemagglutinin (HA) binders to match whatever host cell receptor the virus is trying to bind. The hemagglutinin(HA) structure of the Viet04 H5N1 virus has been found to be closely related to the HA structure of the 1918pandemic influenza virus. Avian viruses, such as H5N1, first go after bird intestinal epithelial cells. In contrast, human influenza virusesfirst go after epithelial cells in the lungs and upper respiratory tract. Once the respective viruses have bound totheir respective host cells, the viral genetic material can be transferred into the host. The result is influenzainfection in either animals or humans. Recent Discovery of One Method H5N1Could Adapt to Humans Now molecular biologist, Ian Wilson, reports that “once a foothold in a new host species is made, the virusHA can optimize its specificity to the new host. Our recombinant approach to the structural analysis of theViet04 virus showed that when we inserted HA mutations that had already been shown to shift receptorpreference in H3 HAs to the human respiratory tract, the mutations increased receptor preference of the Viet04HA towards specific human glycans that could serve as receptors on lung epithelial cells. The effect of thesemutations on the Viet04 HA increases the likelihood of binding to, and infection of, susceptible epithelialcells.” In other words, small mutations in the H5N1 HA binder could be one way the bird flu virus changes to adaptto human hosts. But Ian Wilson stresses that there could be other unknow n, “unidentified mutations,” w hich"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"could develop and allow H5N1 human-to-human transmission. Researchers at Scripps hope the glycanmicroarray will at least be able to quickly identify new strains of the H5N1 virus that might be on the verge ofadapting to human cell receptors.Interview: Ian Wilson, D.

Phil., Oxford University, U.K.; Prof. of Molecular Biology, Dept. of Molecular Biology,Scripps Re se arch Institute , La Jolla, California: “In 1918, we don’t know when the first virus of that strainemerged and how long it took to switch its receptors. But we have discovered in our lab that some minorsequence changes can help the H5N1 virus bind to human receptors. The question is: Could those minorsequence changes in the H5N1 be how the virus accomplishes human-to-human transmission?What we suggested in our Science paper is indeed we saw some receptors (on H5N1 virus) change byswitching ony two mutations. But it wasn’t as dramatic a switch as in the 1918 or 1968 pandemic viruses, theirability to switch receptor specificity. It’s still unknown what the H5N1 virus could or will do, but we suggestthis HA receptor switch is a possible route that the H5N1 virus could get a foothold in the human population. HOW LONG MIGHT IT BE BEFORE YOUR LABAORATORY RECEIVES SOME OF THE MORECURRENT STRAINS OF H5N1 THAT HAVE BEEN KILLING PEOPLE IN AZERBAIJAN, EGYPT,TURKEY AND OTHER COUNTRIES? Probably within the next few weeks, I imagine we’ll be able to get some samples. ON THE BASIS OF THE WORK YOU HAVE DONE ON VIET 04, WILL YOU THEN BE ABLE TO HAVEA FASTER 'BIG PICTURE' OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH THE VIRUS AND HOW IT MIGHT BECHANGING IN THESE LATEST HUMAN DEATHS? Glycan Microarray Yes. At least as far as looking at the receptor binding specificity, which is what we’re really looking at. Wecan see if there has been any switch in ability to bind to human cells. We can do that using this glycanmicroarray that was developed here by the Center for Functional Glycomics, which is headed by Jim Paulson.That array could be of great use in determining whether the viruses bind to more avian-like receptors or morehuman-like receptors. We can look for that in the more current viruses. IF YOU SAW THAT IT WAS MOVING IN A HUMAN RECEPTOR TREND IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS,THAT MIGHT ACCELERATE THE PROPOSAL NOW TO TRY TO USE H5N1 EXISTING VACCINES INPOPULATIONS THAT ARE ESPECIALLY THREATENED, SUCH AS POULTRY WORKERS? If a virus came along that looked like it had acquired the ability to bind to human cells, that would definitelybecome a candidate for a vaccine. It’s not just change in receptor binding that goes on. Mutations are acquiredelsewhere in the virus and the virus does that so it can escape our immune system. So, the antibodies areproduced against previous viruses. That is why we have to be immunized with a different vaccine strain everytwo or three years because even though it is the same H3 virus, for example, we’re being immunized against –as it changes, we have to change the vaccine, too. So, similarly H5N1 viruses have changed over the (past 9)years and you would obviously get less protection from a vaccine strain that was used several years agocompared to what the current strain would be. WHY IS H5N1 SO LETHAL TO BIRDS AND TO THE HUMANS THAT GET IT? I don’t think we understand all the correlates of why a particular virus is so lethal. For example, this virus issimilar to other viruses in that it has a very polybasic sequence which is very easily cleaved in order to makethe virus infectious. We haven’t seen such a virus in the human population yet. This is the first with that type ofsequence. So there is that and a number of other correlates that we probably don’t fully understand yet that arelikely to be responsible. IF THE PANDEMIC TAKES OFF AND IT IS A VIRUS MUTATION FOR WHICH NONE OF THEVACCINES OR ANTIVIRALS WORK, WHAT WOULD THE WORSE CASE BE?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The worst case scenario would be if a virus came along for which we did not have a vaccine strain currentlyavailable and that none of the Tamiflu or other antivirals would work. But I think because of the enormoussurveillance that is going on, we are getting very quick feedback on what the viruses are, their make-up andproperties. One should be optimistic that the virologists are on top of this and isolating and characterizingthese viruses very quickly. WOULD YOUR LAB BE ONE OF THE FIRST IN THE WORLD TO KNOW IF H5N1 CHANGES TOADAPT TO HUMAN RECEPTORS?Not necessarily. It depends on the people in the field who are isolating the viruses. What would we like to dois use the glycan microarray technology to be able to get out into the field to be able to aascertain if the viruswere changing receptor specificity. In that case, we would know fairly early on.\"More Information: For more information about H5N1, please see the following reports in Earthfiles Archives: • 03/10/2006 -- The Rapid Spread of H5N1 Bird Flu Virus• 02/03/2006 -- Trends 2006• 11/13/2005 -- H5N1 Avian Flu Has Infected 21st Person in Thailand. 13 Have Died.• 10/26/2005 -- Updated - H5N1 Bird Flu - The Next Pandemic?• 08/05/2005 -- Scientists Puzzled by \"Bizarre\" Pacific Coast Die-offs in 2005• 07/22/2005 -- H5N1 Bird Flu Virus Kills Three Indonesians• 06/21/2005 -- CDC Reports First 2005 Human Case of West Nile Virus in Kansas• 06/21/2005 -- Vietnamese Doctor Studying H5N1 Bird Flu Falls Victim to Virus• 06/03/2005 -- West Nile and Bird Flu: Two Increasingly Dangerous Viruses• 03/12/2005 -- Could Avian Flu H5N1 Cause the Next Pandemic?• 01/29/2004 -- Unprecedented Outbreak of Avian Flu Has Killed Ten People in Asia• 01/13/2004 -- Updated: SARS and Bird Flu Back in Asia• 03/18/2003 -- Updated - SARS Pneumonia Tentatively Identified as Paramyxoviridae Virus• 09/24/2000 -- Infectious Diseases - A Global ThreatWe bsi t e s: Scripps Research Institute: http:/ /www.scripps.e du/ e _inde x.html Journal of Virol ogy: http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/reprint/78/18/9954.pdf Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2010 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2010, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
