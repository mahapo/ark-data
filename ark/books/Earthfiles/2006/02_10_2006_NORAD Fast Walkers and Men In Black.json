Navy air traffic controllers man radar screens of Air Operations Center on board theUSS Theodore Roosevelt in 1999. Image courtesy U. S. Dept. of Defense. February 10, 2006 - There's an airspace intrusion mystery which has haunted ourAmerican military radar centers for decades. The intruders are called \"Fast Walkers\" unidentified aerial objects that suddenly appear on radar moving at 1200 to 1700 mph.Recently at Earthfiles, I received a firsthand report from a former U.S. Air ForceSuperintendent of Operations for the First Command Control Squadron inside NORAD(North American Aerospace Defense Command) about the \"fast walkers\" he personallytracked on military radar during his 24-year-long career. The first radar \"fast walkers\" thathe saw were in 1970 when he was stationed on the island of Okinawa.M. S., retired Master Sergeant, USAF, and former Superintendent of Operations forthe First Command Control Squadron, NORAD, Cheyenne Mountain, ColoradoSprings, Colorado: \"I went out to Okinawa where I was on a little island about half waybetween the main island and Taiwan. Our job was as flight followers for the B-52s thatwere going into Vietnam. That was the first place I encountered them and that was in1970.TALK ABOUT ENCOUNTERING UFOS THROUGH RADAR.Basically, what you see is: the old radars I worked with had roughly a 200 mile range. Youwould see and we used to measure speeds. And a sweep or one complete rotation of theantenna took 12 seconds. We would count the number of sweeps and count the distancethe thing traveled and then figure out how fast it was going.We would see something come up on the perimeter of the radar scope, right out on theend. And within maybe 5 or 6 sweeps, it was all the way to the other side of the scope inno time at all.THAT WOULD MEAN IT WAS TRAVELING HOW FAST?Oh, geez, I think from 1200 to 1700 mph. Our old height finders at the time this was 1950svintage radar would go up to 100,000 feet. There were times we couldn't even see it. It"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"was gone. And I don't think it was an SR-71. They did fly back then. The reason I say thatis that whenever they went through an area that was considered like in our range of radar,allied forces, they would have what they called a transponder onboard. Aircraft still carrythem today all aircraft have them, just about. That sends out a signal saying, 'This is me.This is who I am.' But it's in code. It's a 4-digit code. We would read that code and we'dsay, 'Yeah, that's flight so and so going to wherever they went.'But these things (fast radar blips) didn't squawk anything. They didn't broadcast any kindof a code or anything. They would just appear and then they would be gone in about fourto half a dozen sweeps of the radar across the scope. \"Weather\" Explanations for Fast WalkersWeather systems on radar. Image courtesy USAF.SO, YOUR FIRST RADAR BLIPS THAT WERE RELATED TO UFOS WAS IN THE1970S. HOW DID YOUR SUPERIOR OFFICERS EXPLAIN THEM TO YOU AT THETIME?They said it was probably just either weather phenomenon or an SR-71, or something ofthat effect. They pretty much explained it away.DID YOU GUYS ACCEPT THAT?At the time, I was only 19. So, who knew any better? (laughs)AS YOUR CAREER EVOLVED AND YOU SAW MORE ANOMALIES ON RADAR?As the career evolved, I got more knowledgeable with radar. I understood it better. I alsobetter understood the physics behind it. So when something like that (fast radar blip), wewould say, 'Well, they can say it's weather. But I know what weather looks like and that'snot weather. I kind of knew better.On the other hand, I didn't know if it was R & D aircraft for all I knew. I didn't know. Ihonestly did not know what it was. Men In Black Visit NORAD Missile Warning CenterTALK ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE YOU RELATED IN YOUR E-MAILCONCERNING THE MEN IN BLACK.I don't know if that's what they really call themselves. But we would be in the MissileWarning Center. It was a very interesting place. We used to do line checks there. In otherword, we would pick up the phone and push the button to talk to the distant end to makesure the line worked.THIS IS INSIDE OF CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN INSIDE OF NORAD.Yes. And we would call, for example, a radar site or satellite facility that tracks missiledata and that type of thing. We would call at the beginning of each shift to make certain allthe lines worked and make sure we knew what we were dealing with. That was standardprocedure.It was one of those places where if the phone rang, we didn't know if it was just a linecheck or World War III! especially if it was in the middle of the shift. It was a very intensearea to work.Basically what would happen there is that we would get what appeared to be a missilelaunch out of nowhere places that missiles should not have been, like in the middle of the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Atlantic or middle of the Pacific or off the equator or anywhere. We would see this andtrack it and we treated all launches the same. It didn't matter if it was the space shuttle or aSoviet launch. It didn't make any difference. We would treat them all the same because itwould be practice for us. So we always worked them.Anyway, one of these things would come up out of the middle of nowhere and we'd log itall down and run the normal data sequences and present it to the forward users as inDepartment of Defense; Ft. Richie; the White House; the Pentagon and all the peoplethere.HOW NORMAL IS IT IN THE MILITARY TO HAVE PEOPLE IN BLACK SUITSSHOW UP AND BE ABLE TO TAKE EVERYTHING WITHOUT SOMECLEARANCE?Well, we all had Access badges. Those Access badges had numbers printed on them thatyou were allowed to go into and allowed to obtain data from. You know, everything is on aneed-to-know basis in the military.Well, these guys would come in and we would examine everybody's badge before theycame in the door. These guys had nothing blacked out on their badges. All the numberswere exposed. They could go anywhere.I really don't know if anybody was called and told we were going to get a visit from themor not. I would imagine. Our actual Crew Chief for the entire crew, which meant theCommand Post, Missile Warning, the Space Surveillance Center, Intelligence all thedepartments that worked inside Cheyenne Mountain were headed up by a General. AndI'm sure he probably had a call and then he disseminated down to the perspective areasthat needed to know.YOU ALL WOULD JUST ASSUME THAT ANYBODY WHO WAS ABLE TO COMEINTO CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN AND WALK INTO YOUR OFFICE WHERE YOUHAD CLASSIFIED RADAR INFORMATION AND THAT THEY COULD SHOW THISBADGE WITH THESE NUMBERS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THENEED-TO-KNOW AND YOU WOULD HAND TO THEM WITHOUT QUESTION?As far as I knew, yes.WERE YOU EVER DE-BRIEFED BY ANYONE ABOUT THESE UNIDENTIFIEDSBEING SOMETHING EXTRATERRESTRIAL, INTERPLANETARY OR ANY WORDSLIKE THAT USED?No, they didn't say it like that. They would come back anywhere from a few minutes to afew hours later with their log book. The log book if it was something that was pertinentand they wanted it kept secret that page would disappear. It would come out of the logbook.They'd come back and say, 'Here you go.' You'd look at it and they would basically saysomething like: 'By the way, guys, you didn't see anything.' Or, 'This watch did not exist.'And we would just say, 'OK.' Whatever it takes.HOW WOULD THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?In the field I was in, you just accepted it. I had a TOP SECRET clearance, as everybodydid in there. Our phone number was classified. We couldn't even answer. If we got anoutside call, it would go through the NORAD operator and then be piped into us. We couldnot answer the phone, 'Missile Warning Center.' We had to answer it with a 4-digit numberthat our extension was. It was one of those kind of things.So if somebody said, 'You didn't see anything.' We'd say, 'OK, we didn't see anything.' Itwas that simple. You didn't question it. You didn't ask about it. It's just the way it was.BUT DID YOU THINK ABOUT IT?Oh, of course you think about it.WHAT DID YOU THINK COULD EXPLAIN THESE MEN TAKING THIS RADARDATA AND TELLING YOU NOTHING HAPPENED?My crew at least and there were five crews. I can speak for my crew we would dig into thebooks and try to figure out if it was a radar anomaly of some sort, what it originated from.If it was a satellite anomaly, we'd try to figure out which it originated from and try to getdown to the bottom of the anomaly and what was going on. But some were anomalies andsome weren't.WHAT WAS THE MOST ANOMALOUS CASE YOU CAN REMEMBER?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I would say the extremely fast moving and high objects. Occasionally we'd get a launchout of the Pacific or Atlantic.WHERE NOTHING WOULD BE TO LAUNCH ANYTHING?As far as we knew. That's the whole thing.WHAT IS YOUR OWN THINKING TODAY ABOUT THE PHRASE,'EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITY' WHICH HAS COME UP IN LEAKEDGOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS. LT. COL. PHILIP J. CORSO OF THE U. S.
