Then he said the UFO turned on a blue beam and it wasrotating and the beam was starting to move toward him. ...Searchers never foundanything no wreckage, nothing.\" - \"Hawk,\" USAF Geophysicist January 20, 2006 Thurmont, Maryland - Some of the startling facts that are emergingfrom research about the V-2 rocket history at White Sands Proving Ground in the late1940s are New Mexico and Texas newspaper headlines about the \"peculiar phenomena\"that were interfering with those early rocket launches. The peculiar phenomena werecausing the rockets to veer off course. Photographs showed the peculiar phenomena werecircular discs that instantaneously appeared next to the V-2s right before the rockets wentoff course and crashed to the ground. General Nathan Twining even referred to the discs asan \"enemy weapons system,\" according to government insiders who have leakedinformation in the past ten years.That was not known to those 1947 newspaper reporters. They also did not know that theTruman administration had secretly ordered the American military to shoot down the disctechnology. United States pilots tried shooting at many of the discs, but there wasretaliation. The retaliation has allegedly included plane crashes and reports of beams thatcan capture a plane and pilot in midair and cause them to vanish. According to off-the-record testimonies and leaked documents, such mid-air captures were even watched onradar.Now, for the first time, UFO investigator, Bruce Maccabee, Ph.D. - who has worked morethan 30 years as a research physicist at the U. S. Naval Surface Warfare Center inDahlgren, Virginia - is reporting information he learned from an American Air Forceofficer in late 1985 to early 1986, which includes American aggression against a UFO andretaliation. Dr. Maccabee and I know the true identity of the source, but at the presenttime, the man will be called \"Hawk.\" In the late 1950s, Hawk became a weather officer forthe U. S. Air Force. Then he studied geology and by the mid-1960s, was doing geologicalmeasurements related to underground atomic bomb tests. A decade later in the 1970s,Hawk was working in the advanced physics branch of the Foreign Technology Division atWright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.Hawk was known to another Wright-Patterson scientist named Robert Collins, co-authorof the 2005 book entitled Exempt from Disclosure, written with former Air Force Office ofSpecial Investigations (AFOSI) counter-intelligence agent, Richard C. Doty. Hawk'sknowledge about UFOs is discussed in the book, which provoked Dr. Maccabee to finallyrelease the details of his own discussion with Hawk twenty years ago. Ironically, it wasRobert Collins back then who arranged the meeting between Bruce Maccabee and Hawk.Hawk, through Dr. Maccabee, provides important insights about our government'sknowledge of the UFO phenomenon despite official denials in the interest of nationalsecurity. This Part 1 begins with Hawk's own firsthand experiences with UFOs as he firstdescribed them to Dr. Maccabee in mid-November 1985.Interview:Bruce S. Maccabee, Ph.D., Research Physicist, U. S. Naval Surface Warfare Center,Dahlgren Division; Author, The UFO/FBI Connection, The Secret History of theGovernment's Cover-Up © 2000; Abduction In My Life © 2001; Thurmont, Maryland:March 1954, Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio\"Hawk was in the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corp (AF ROTC) and was about togo regular Air Force. They gave him a tour of Wright-Patterson AFB. At various buildingsthere, he described how he was with a small group of guys who somehow wandered off ontheir own away from the main tour group while they were in a wind tunnel test facility. In"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"order to catch up, they decided to cut through some temporary rooms which had been setup inside the large wind tunnel building by movable wall-type things that you can put up tohave instantaneous rooms.So, they are going through one and they find some models of craft there. I guess somewere conventional aircraft and some were far out like a flying wing. I believe he said therewas a cigar shape, but what attracted him was a disc-shaped thing one or two discs thatwere very carefully made out of wood.He described it as being a pancake-shaped disc with a tail coming up in the back. Whatpopped in my mind was the picture in Case 10 of Special Report 14, by Project Blue Bookat the Batelle Memorial Institute (Iowa Sate Univ., Ames Iowa.)[ Editor's Note: An in-depth report about the Rogue River case with BruceMaccabee is in Earthfiles 041705.]Drawings by one of Ames Laboratory eyewitnesses in Battelle Institute Special Report 14, Case X (Serial1119.00).Case X information: \"An employee in the supersonic laboratory of an aeronautical laboratory (AmesLaboratory, San Francisco)and some other employees of this lab, were by a river, 2 1/2 miles from its mouth, when they saw an object.The time was about1700 hours on May 24, 1949. The object was reflecting sunlight when observed by naked eye. However, hethen looked at itwith 8-power binoculars, at which time there was no glare. (Did glasses have filter?) It was of metallicconstructionand was seen with good enough resolution to show that the skin was dirty. It moved off in horizontal flight at agradually increasing rate of speed, until it seemed to approach the speed of a jet before it disappeared.No propulsion was apparent. Time of observation was 2 1/2 to 3 minutes.Case 10 was an object seen by five witnesses who are fishing the Rogue River in Oregonin May of 1949. Two of the guys worked for the Ames Research Laboratory in SanFrancisco, where they did aeronautics research of various types. They looked at this objectthrough binoculars and it was a flat disc-shaped thing with a tail on the back.I sent a copy of this picture to Hawk and he said it was like what he had seen. Then hedrew his own version of what he saw and it was a carefully drawn circular-shaped objectwith something like a flat dome on top and a tail fin or vertical stabilizer on the back end."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The people who saw the round object near the Rogue River described it as coming along,hovering over the river, not making any sound at all, rotating on its vertical axis and thenaccelerating to the speed of a jet in a few seconds and never making any sound.So, whatever the Rogue River people saw was pretty bizarre and that may well have beenthe inspiration for the model that Hawk said he saw with his friends (at Wright-PattersonAFB). He also said that one of the buddies who was with him recognized these things. Thisother kid said this is what his father had been telling him about, flying saucers.THE FATHER WAS AN AIR FORCE OFFICER STATIONED AT WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB IN OHIO.Right. Then the next thing that happened to him was really a bizarre story.AND THAT WAS SPRING OF 1959. USAF Attacks UFO Which Retaliates with Blue BeamSpring of 1959, 8th USAF Headquarters, Misawa, Japan"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Misawa (in red) in northeast corner of Japan's big Honshu island,the location in 1959 of the American 8th Air Force Headquarters.Hawk was stationed at the 8th Air Force Headquarters in Misawa, Japan (northeasternHonshu Island). He had taken courses in meteorology. At this time, he was themeteorologist who was providing weather reports for the Air Traffic Control Center, radarcontrol center at this air force base in Japan.While he was there one day, they were giving him a tour of this radar control center. Hehad been there for a few months and he was now being given a tour. He was standing theretalking with some person who was giving him a tour when suddenly things started tohappen. How he gets this information, some how words are being handed back and forthverbally by these people watching radar screens. The guy who is in charge of the wholeoperation some word comes, 'They're back again!'Hawk asks his friend, 'Who's back?'And his friend says, 'These things happen often. One or two objects will come towardJapan and then set up in a holding pattern or stay there stationary for a period of time andthen suddenly take off and head west. He said this was somewhat approximately over thearea between the north and south islands of Japan.THE COMMANDER SAYS, 'WE'LL SCRAMBLE!' WHAT HAPPENED?These objects had become stationary and the question was: what do we do about it?Apparently this thing had happened before at least something like it had happened before and so, the guy who was in charge decided to send up aircraft to investigate. Hawk said hehad been told there were two specially instrumented F-106s. He thought at the time thatwas strange because the F-106 had barely been introduced in the United States. If youactually look up the history of F-106s, I think the first one was in 1955 or 1956.By the way, a search was made by Don Berliner (Fund for UFO Research) to find out ifthere were any missing F-106s. I believe he did find four that they could not account for.THE IMPLICATION WAS THAT A BRAND NEW AIRPLANE THAT WAS DESIGNEDFOR FIGHTING HAD BEEN ESPECIALLY EQUIPPED TO ATTACK \"ALIEN FLYINGMACHINES\" OR UFOS?I don't know if you would say special devices for attacking. But I got the impression thatthese were special devices for instruments to make measurements. They obviously hadweapons on the airplanes as well. According to Hawk, he was told there were twospecially instrumented aircraft and that when they decided to scramble, one guy could notget his special intstruments to work, so the other guy they only scrambled one aircraft.Then Hawk was asked to provide a weather report what would the pilot see in terms of theweather. Hawk said it was a full moon up above a uniform cloud cover at 10,000 feet, orsomething like that. As soon as the guy broke through the cloud cover, he would haveclear visibility.Hawk said he could not hear the radar operators talking into their microphones next totheir desks. But they had put the voice of the pilot onto a loud speaker so that everybodycould hear it. The pilot talked about climbing up through the clouds and then seeing lo' andbehold, this object I don't know if it was a light or structured craft or something five or tenmiles away, some distance away. He asked what to do and was told to go into a holdingpattern. So, I guess he started flying around in circles until they told him what to do.Hawk said at this point, the commander in charge of the radar installation put through a"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"call to Washington, D. C. to find out what to do. Hawk was impressed because the guy gota very quick response using what was then a new form of radar, a radio transmissionknown as 'single side band transmission.' Hawk said that he was in weather forecasting andhad to have quick responses on things like monsoons that might start up and create badweather. So he was accustomed to getting a response, but even his responses might takehim fifteen or twenty minutes or an hour to come back. He was impressed because theygot a response almost within minutes. It was obviously a pretty important thing thatsomebody in Washington, D. C. was prepared for, I guess.Anyway, the word came back to 'roll in' and basically attack this object - which basicallymeant he was now heading towards the object and he was firing all his missiles, howevermany that might have been. I presume they were early versions of the Sidewinder missile,which was a heat-seeking missile.An F/A-18 Hornet strike fighter fires an AIM-9 Sidewinder missile.Photo courtesy U.S. Department of Defense.There would be some period of time in which the missiles were traveling. The pilot saidthat the missiles had all exploded before they hit the unidentified aerial object (shielded?).Then he said the UFO turned on a blue beam and it was rotating and the beam was startingto move toward him.At that point, he went into a dive and Hawk said he was impressed at the voice of thepilot. It suddenly went up into this high falsetto, an indication of controlled fear. The pilotwas turning and trying to go away from the object and on the radar scope, Hawk said hecould see the spots getting closer to one another. Then they merged and there was just onedot on the radar and the radar people didn't know what to do. All of a sudden, that dotdisappeared. Hawk said for the next 48 hours, he was giving weather forecasts as to whatthey would find while they were doing the search. According to Hawk, searchers neverfound anything no wreckage, nothing.THIS ISSUE OF AGGRESSION, ATTACK ON ORDERS BY OUR MILITARY AGAINSTTHE FLYING DISC PHENOMENON, GOES BACK ALL THE WAY TO THE V-2ROCKET MISSILE LAUNCHES WE WERE DOING AT WHITE SANDS. THEN WEWERE GETTING RETALIATION THEN, IT APPEARS, AND THE BASECOMMANDER AT WHITE SANDS IN MAY OF 1947 FIRST CALLED THEM,'PECULIAR PHENOMENA,' AND THEY WERE BEING PHOTOGRAPHED ASDISCS.AS I READ THIS MANUSCRIPT, BRUCE, IT SEEMED THAT ONE OF THE MOSTIMPORTANT INSIGHTS FROM THIS MAN - WHO WAS WORKING AT ACLASSIFIED LEVEL INSIDE OF OUR GOVERNMENT WITH SOME KNOWLEDGEABOUT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS AND THEIR OCCUPANTS - WAS THATHE KNEW FIRSTHAND THAT WE TRIED TO ATTACK AND THERE WASRETALIATION.Right. He and others were told officially that it never happened. The plane was lost, butfor some other reason. He asked if the event were classified and he was told, 'No, becauseit did not happen.' And you can't classify something that didn't happen. (laughs) So that'ssort of how they got away with it. There is no supporting information only the people whowere there at the time and they are not going to talk. Hawk Learns More About E.T.sand UFO Technology in Albuquerque, New MexicoCOULD YOU EXPLAIN THEN FROM JAPAN HOW HAWK CAME TO BECONVINCED THAT WE ACTUALLY WERE DEALING WITH EXTRATERRESTRIAL"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES?I think that convincing probably came during the late 1970s into the 1980s, based on whatpeople had told him. but you get the impression from (Robert) Collins's book that Hawkknew a lot more than he told me. What he told me was sort of like the tip of the iceberg.He started off with his own experiences and then went into what other people had toldhim.Now his third semi-direct personal experience occurred in the middle 1960s when he wasat a conference in Albuquerque. My understanding is that the conference had to do withhis geological work in monitoring the underground nuclear explosions, often called UGTs underground tests.He was at a conference there with a buddy of his. He and some other people were invitedto go to a facility which is south southeast of Kirtland AFB and I believe the buildings arestill there. It was a facility where they did nuclear tests on animals. The way he describedit was they had animal pens around this facility and they would take them into a buildingwhere they would put the animal in a room. Then they had a radioactive source of nuclearradiation that was in an underground vault to minimize the radiation hazard to people whoworked there. After the animal was inside this presumably radiation-shielded room, theywould then bring up this, raise the source of radiation to where it was irradiating the animalfor some period of time. They would put it (the radiation source) back down in the ground.So, Hawk was invited along with some other guys to go and see this facility. He went thereand he described how the various men had various rankings and degrees. While his groupwas there, they noticed there was another small group of guys from the Navy and he saidthey were saying, 'You think that the Air Force guys have a lot of degrees. There are guysin the Navy who have several doctorates. They are doctors and have Ph.D.s and otherdegrees. Somebody asked, 'Why do they need all that?' - all those degrees to do whateverit is they are doing. According to Hawk, the reason was because they were working onaliens.EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES. (laughs)Hawk says word goes around, 'That must be bullshit.' But nevertheless, his friend Bob gotinterested and decided to see if he could get in on the work. Bob was told, 'You don't askthem. They invite you.'AND BOB HIPPLER WAS...Bob Hippler becomes a real person if you read what I wrote. You know the effect on meof finding his name in a document written by Jim McDonald. (laughs) My eyes were goingacross the page reading fast and I hit that word and my eyeballs just stopped moving. Itwas like I was frozen in space! I never expected to find a real person connected with thisguy Bob Hippler! (laughs)WHO IS, WAS, BOB HIPPLER?I don't know what Hippler's rank was at the time in the Air Force. Hippler told about anumber of facilities in the Albuquerque area and Kirtland AFB where research was doneon aliens. Some pretty strange things, like he said the tramway what's that called? [ Editor'sNote: Lt. Col.Robert Hippler.]IT'S CALLED THE SANDIA TRAMWAY.The \"World's Longest Tramway,\" from the base to the topof 10,378 foot Sandia Peak, Albuquerque, New Mexico.Sandia Tramway Company -\"Cut Out\" Cover for MJ-12 Meetings?The Sandia Tramway Company was actually a cover for an organization to build a meeting"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"place for people who were controlling the information having to do with aliens that youmight call MJ-12. But Hawk did not use that terminology.There were some other buildings in the Albuquerque area that were associated with thisproject having to do with aliens, according to Hawk. But again, this is according to whatHawk was told back in the middle 1960s. He and Bob Hippler drove around Albuquerqueactually finding these various places confirming the actual places existed. Of course, theycould not confirm what was going on.So, after this conference was over, Hippler and Hawk went their separate ways. It was acouple of years later that he ran into Bob Hippler and said, 'Did you ever get the job youwanted to join this work on aliens?'Hawk recalls Hippler saying because he said it three times - 'I'm now a member of the realProject Blue Book. I'm now a member of the real Project Blue Book.' And Hawkremembers him saying it three times. He did not know what Blue Book was, but heremembers Hippler referring to it three times and saying it was the real one.\"A \"Memo for Record,\" dated May 12, 1966, on the subject of \"UFO Report\" with distribution of originaland sanitized copies to several people, including Lt. Col. Robert Hippler. This memo is included in the\"Special Reportof the USAF Scientific Advisory Board Ad Hoc Committee to Review Project 'Blue Book.'\"See website: http://www.cufon.org/cufon/obrie n.htmBack in 1986, Dr. Maccabee talked to UFO researcher/author, Bill Moore, about theHawk interview and Bob Hippler's revelation. Moore tracked Hippler down by phone. Butall the real Project Blue Book investigator said was that it happened a long time ago, hedidn't want to talk about it, goodbye. And click, hung up the phone.The Jim McDonald that Dr. Maccabee references was Dr. James E. McDonald, the seniorphysicist at the Institute for Atmospheric Physics and Professor in the Dept. ofMeteorology at the University of Arizona in Tucson. Throughout the 1960s, Dr. McDonaldinterviewed hundreds of UFO witnesses and uncovered many government documentsrelated to the phenomenon. He testified before Congress during the 1968 UFO hearingscalled by Cong. Gerald Ford. Dr. McDonald was highly critical of the United States AirForce's Project Blue Book Condon Report which dismissed UFOs as largelymisidentifications. Dr. McDonald and serious UFO investigators thought the Condonreport was phony a government attempt to white wash the REAL phenomenon.Now, Dr. Maccabee has reinforced that contention with Hawk's revelation that there wasanother real Project Blue Book that Bob Hippler worked for, probably under the MJ-12Special Studies Group. It was like a shell game there were two Project Blue Books: aphony one to keep the public and media away from the real Blue Book investigation.Continued in Dreamland Online radio and Earthfiles Part 2 - E.T. autopsies anddisappearance of military security guards."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"More Information:For more about American military aggression against UFOs, crash/retrievals and UFOretaliation, please see reports below in Earthfiles Archives :· 01/17/2006 -- Part 9 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collectand Analyze Flying Discs· 01/09/2006 -- Part 8 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collectand Analyze Flying Discs· 01/03/2006 -- Part 7 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collectand Analyze Flying Discs· 12/31/2005 -- Part 6 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collectand Analyze Flying Discs· 12/27/2005 -- Part 5 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collectand Analyze Flying Discs· 12/24/2005 -- Part 4 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collectand Analyze Flying Discs· 12/24/2005 -- Part 3 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collectand Analyze Flying Discs· 12/21/2005 -- Part 2 - Peculiar Phenomenon, Early United States Efforts to Collectand Analyze Flying Discs· 12/19/2005 -- Part 1 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collectand Analyze Flying Discs· 05/03/2005 -- Part 3: Japan Air Lines Pilot Interview About November 1986 UFOEncounter· 05/03/2005 -- Part 2: Japan Air Lines Pilot Interview About November 1986 UFOEncounter· 05/02/2005 -- Part 1: Japan Air Lines and Mile-Diameter UFO, November 1986,Drawings and Transcript· 04/17/2005 -- 1949 Aerial Disc Covered-Up By Project Blue Book As \"Kite\"· 04/14/2005 -- \"Battle of Los Angeles\" On February 25, 1942: America Fired At AUFO· 02/11/2005 -- Story Behind \"Inflation-Theory Implications for ExtraterrestrialVisitation\"· 12/30/2004 -- Audience Feedback About Earthfiles \"September 12, 1952: America's'Secret War'?\"· 12/30/2004 -- September 12, 1952: America's \"Secret War\"?
