The telescope, which looks like a pair of binoculars,consists of two 200-millime te r te lephoto camera lenses. The lenses are attached to electronic devices that measured slight dips in light output from the star, indicating that an object was crossing in front of it.The telescope is on the summit of the Haleakala volcano in Hawaii.

Aninternational team of professional and amateur astronomers, using simple off-the-shelf equipment havediscovered a Jupiter-sized planet orbiting a star similar to our sun 600 light-years from Earth in theconstellation Corona Borealis..\"This discovery suggests that a fleet of modest telescopes and the help of amateur astronomers can search fortransiting extrasolar planets many times faster than we are now,\" said team leader, Peter McCullough of theSpace Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.The \"binocular\" telescope called \"XO\" is made from commercial equipment and consists of two,200-millimeter telephoto camera lenses. The telescope is on the summit of the Haleakala volcano, in Hawaii.\"To replicate the XO prototype telescope would cost $60,000,\" McCullough said, \"and we have spent farmore than that on software, in particular on designing and operating the system and extracting this planet fromthe data.\"McCullough and the amateur astronomers found the new, large planet they call \"X0-1b\" by noticing slight dipsin the star's light output. That indicated an object presumed to be a Jupiter-sized planet was passing in front ofthe star. The light dips by approximately 2% and indicates the planet is orbiting rapidly in a four-day orbitaround its sun.Artis t' s illus tra tion of J upite r- s ize d pla ne t, XO - 1b, orbiting in a 4-da y r e volutionaround a sun similar to ours 600 light-years from Earth in the constellation Corona Borealis.Illustration courtesy NASA, ESA, and G. Bacon of STScI.Astronomer McCullough said: \"Of the planets that pass in front of their stars, XO-1b is the most similar toJupiter yet known, and the star XO-1 is the most similar to the Sun, but XO-1b is much, much closer to its starthan Jupiter is to the Sun.\" Thus, the rapid 4-day revolution.Searching for extrasolar planets by looking for light changes is known as the \"transit method\" in extrasolarinvestigations. So far, XO-1b is only the tenth planet to be discovered using the transit method and the second"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"using the simple telephoto lens. In addition to the ten extrasolar planets discovered using the transit method,another 170 planets have been found using other methods. The XO telescope in the hands of amateurastronomers could speed up the search and discoveries which show that solar systems are common in ourgalaxy. The astronomer's unanswered question is: Will scientists find signs of life on extrasolar planets? Two Years of SearchingSTSI reports: \"From September 2003 to September 2005, the XO telescope observed tens of thousands ofbright stars. In that time, his team of amateur astronomers studied a few dozen promising candidate starsidentified by McCullough and his team. The star X0-1 was pegged as a promising candidate in June 2005. Theamateur astronomers observed it in June and July 2005, confirming that a planet-sized object was eclipsing thestar. McCullough's team then turned to the McDonald Observatory in Texas to obtain the object's mass andverify it as a planet. He received the news of the telescope's observation at 12:06 a.m. February 16, 2006,from Chris Johns-Krull, a friend and colleague at Rice University.\"It was a wonderful feeling because the team had worked for three years to find this one planet,\" McCulloughexplained. \"The discovery represents a few bytes out of nearly a terabyte of data: It's like trying to distill goldout of seawater. By timing the planet's passages across the star, both amateur and professional astronomersmight be lucky enough to detect the presence of another planet in the XO-1 system by its gravitational tugs onXO-1b. It's even possible that such a planet could be similar to Earth.\"More Information:The Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore is operated for NASA by the Association of Universitiesfor Research in Astronomy, Inc., Washington.For more about extrasolar planet discoveries, please see reports below in Earthfiles Archives:• 03/25/2005 -- Glow of Distant Worlds Seen For First Time• 12/17/2004 -- Is Our Solar System's Red, Mysterious Sedna An Alien Planetoid?• 02/03/2004 -- Planet 150 Light Years from Earth Has Oxygen and Carbon Atmosphere• 06/14/2002 -- Another Solar System Like Ours?• 12/01/1999 -- Six More Planets Discovered 60 to 190 Light Years AwayWebsites:http:/ / hubble site .org/ ne ws/ 2006/22http://mcdonaldobservatory.org/news/http:/ / me dia.rice .e du/ me dia/ De fault.asphttp://www.bu.e du/phpbin/ ne ws/ re le ase s/browse .phphttp://www.ifa.hawaii.e du/info/pre ss-re le ase sCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2010 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2010, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
