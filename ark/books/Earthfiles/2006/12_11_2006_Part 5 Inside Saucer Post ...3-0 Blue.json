S. Navy Admiral Delmar FahrneyReturn to Part 1December 11, 2006 Albuquerque, New Mexico -An official publication of Civilian Research, InterplanetaryFlying Objects (CRIFO) © 1957 by Leonard H. Stringfield.THE CASE AGAINST CENSORSHIPEven though the evidence pointed heavily in favor of the popular belief that censorshipwas practiced by the press, I still lacked the proof of it. And, while lacking proof, I feltdetermined not to close my mind on the possibility that there still was another answer forthe press' strange behaviorism in regard to the flying saucer issue. Perhaps, I have oftenthought, I had leaned too heavily on local incidents as my best evidence. These, I believed,in my negative moments, were certainly no criteria for the status quo on a national scale.Still picking at my own presumptions, I also wondered about the few intelligent stories thatwere being carried by the newswire services and those that were published with aneditorial challenge by newspapers in other cities. In brief, I felt convinced that somethingwas amiss in the press's attitude and actions, but when searching for its pattern, the patternbecame more and more patternless. Perhaps John DuBarry, former Aviation Editor of Tr uemagazine, hit upon the answer when he wrote me the following:\"UFO censorship is presumed to operate in two areas - in the government andin the press. Before considering its causes and effects, let's define the term. Bycensorship, I assume we mean deliberate interference with, or suppression of,communication for reasons of policy. Such censorship has indeed taken lacein the government, as Donald Keyhoe and Edward Ruppelt have showed us.Though the policy basis is still unclear - whether it's fear, stubborn disbelief,or simple bafflement, we don't know - there has been a more or less successful"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"squelching of good UFO cases.\"In the press, however, the situation is different. No central command exists,as in the government, that can compel silence. From experience on bothnewspaper and magazine staffs, I know that most publishers and editors wouldreact against ny attempt to shut them up about UFOs. I am sure that thegovernment has not tried directly to do so. A few publications, I don't doubt,have adopted a self-imposed censorship as a matter of policy. (They don'tbelieve in saucers, or they don't want to encourage public concern aboutthem.) Most publications just don't know what to think and consequently,accept Air Force pronouncements. If they are silent, we can blame them forbeing negligent or gullible, but not for being censored. As a matter of fact,local newspapers report a fair number of UFO sightings and news clippings arethe mainstay of our UFO files.\"Therefore, let's capitalize on this lack of censorship in the press. If UFOinvestigators and groups will take it as a major duty to give calm, reasoned,intelligent comments on observable phenomena in letters to editors, radionewscasters and so on, we'll get a hearing and we'll help to keep presschannels open until conclusive proof is at hand.\"To me, DuBarry made sense! His reasoning covered most of the \"old saws\" cryingcensorship and provided at least a sensible explanation for even the extreme issues whichbothered the more searching critics. Reviewing these accordingly, I could see instead ofcensorship the \"canned\" editorial as an editor's laziness; the smothered story as an editor'sbias; the garbled account as an editor's poor discipline; and I might add, the funny story,which if not funny originally, was made that way to suit an editor's witty nature. But,editors like to see newspapers and to offset the scare headlines they embroider aroundinternational incidents and murder, most will jump at a story like this little squib appearingin the Cincinnati Post on July 13, 1957:\"A flying saucer (with little men scampering around it) was reported byhundreds of Chicago residents. ...Military and weather bureau officialsidentified it as a runaway weather balloon, drifting at an altitude of 60,000feet. ...They explained everything, except the 'little men.'\"The Cincinnati Post, however, stumbled for an answer when asked why they blacked outthe big saucer story hitting Indianapolis on August 6, 1957, which involved UFOsmaneuvering around an Air Force bomber. Probably it was not funny enough.On the other hand, DuBarry points out the kind of newspaper which adopts a policy ofself-censorship. Such might be the case of the Cincinnati Enquirer, who edits news with aprotective complex. One example possibly is a United Press story datelined San Juan,Porte Rico, published by the Enquirer on March 10, 1957.\"A fiery object hurtled toward a Pan American Airways plane high over theAtlantic Ocean today on March 9, 1957, forcing it to take quick evasiveaction to avoid being hit, the pilot reported. Four persons requiredhospitalization for shock and injuries suffered apparently because of themaneuver. Capt. Matthew Van Winkle said he could not identify the flamingobject which menaced his transport at the half-way point on the flight fromNew York to San Juan. The pilot of a Trans-Carribean plane said he saw theobject and said he believed it could have been a meteor. A Pan-Americanspokesman said other planes on the same route saw more than one object.Capt. Van Winkle said his first impression when he sighted the object was thatit was a jet plane. But when it got closer, he said he noticed it was not shapedlike any known jet. To avoid a collision, Van Winkle said he pulled the planeinto a steep climb, rising 1500 feet in a few seconds.\"But for some quirk of reasoning, the Enquirer headlined the story this way: \"Pilot Climbs,Avoids Meteor: Four Hurt.\" To the ordinary reader, the object in question would be writtenoff as meteor. But had the reader seen the Philadelphia Inquirer's version of the same UPrelease, he would have read under the headline, \"Airliner Dodges Fiery Object\" a far moredetailed account, which quotes Capt. Van Winkle: \"...It was a burning greenish whiteround object, unrecognizable, but definitely not a meteor.\" Thus we see by coloring thenews to satisfy a policy, the story lost its true perspective.Later, Civilian Saucer Intelligence of New York dug deeply into the case and interrogatedVan Winkle and others. Their findings published in CSI's May issue of Newsletter proposesthe meteoric explanation, but admits that the odds are equally in favor of it being a UFO.Added confirmation came from the Baltimore Sun, which datelined a UFO report onMarch 9, 1957, from Columbia, S. C. as follows: \"A huge flashing object shooting throughthe air was reported early today by several residents in the Columbia area. The brilliant"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"object was described as emitting feathery-like flames as it moved rapidly along just abovethe tree tops.\"Since the Atlantic incident, there have been three other known instances wherecommercial aircraft have had narrow escapees with UFOs. One was a DC-3, which lost tenfeet of its wing. To my knowledge, the Enquirer bypassed all three stories. However, sincethe Post published all three, it again reveals certain \"protective\" traits in another papers'policy.The three Post articles included 1) Phoenix, Arizona, April 21, 1957, DC-3 with ten feetof wing chopped off the end of the left wing by \"some object\" with which it collided inflight an hour earlier. 2) Near El Paso, Texas, July 17, 1957, nearly 80 passengers aboardDC-6 were thrown from their seats as plane dived to avoid collision with a green-lightedobject. 3) Amarillo, Texas, July 22, 1957, several of the 34 passengers aboard aTrans-World Constellation were injured when plane dived to avoid an object.While I have frequently taken the Cincinnati Enquirer to task for its suspicious handling ofUFO news, it was ironically the same newspaper on April 7, 1957, that provided me withthe kind of evidence which could change my views toward the Enquirer and which couldvindicate all newspapers from the same suspicions.The evidence was simple and it began with Mrs. Catherine Golden, Chairman of theCincinnati UFO Society, who called the Enquirer to announce that Major Donald Keyhoewould lecture on April 6, 1957, at the Hughes High School Auditorium. As expected, whenthe announcement appeared in print, it was a lampoon of Keyhoe.In t he meantime, with Orbit bowing out, I had prepared a CRIFO statement, whichsummarized three years of research. I delivered copies to all three newspapers and thenewswire services, but these were smothered, save for a brief squib appearing in EdChapin's column in the Times Star. I was still enduring that snub when I introducedKeyhoe to the audience. My first words were vindictive barbs aimed at the press. Thosebarbs, followed by Keyhoe's critical review of the \"conspiracy,\" I thought would surelydraw the press's ire and the inevitable slap. But to my surprise, the next morning'sEnquirer pulled an about face and stated:\"SAUCER LID BY AF CHARGED - Expert Says Truth on Flying Objects isBeing Withheld.\"An estimated 500 persons yesterday heard Major Donald Keyhoe, 'flyingsaucer' authority, charge the Air Force with withholding the truth on itsinvestigations of unidentified flying objects. ...Keyhoe heads the NationalInvestigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), which he said willattempt to fill the 'breach' left by Air Force silence on the matter. 'This is anhonest investigation,' he said. 'We expect to get rid of all hoaxers and thelunatic fringe.' Keyhoe outlined the history of sightings since 1957. Forawhile, he said, a group inside the Air Force believed in making public thefacts of its UFO research and leaked some of it. Then the lid went downtighter than ever.'\"Admitting that he had 'never seen a flying saucer, except on a radarscope,'Keyhoe cited several sightings which he said had gone unexplained. He saidthat fear of creating widespread hysteria apparently is responsible for the AirForce policy - the fear that 'if we would admit we were being observed bypeople from another planet, it would cause panic. If the objects are from otherworlds,' Keyhoe said, 'I personally don't accept that there is anything ominousabout them. They've had many years to attack us. We have the right to knowthe facts,' he said, suggesting the Air Force would be wiser to release thosefacts gradually and prepare the public.\"A straight and sober report; neither saucers nor Keyhoe sold short, which is so often thecase when other newspapers recount his lectures. Had the Enquirer been under the\"thumb\" or \"too close to Wright-Patterson, nautically and politically\" as has been charged,the lecture would have been snubbed or subjected to choice phraseological snipes.Still another example of a newspaper asserting its rights was the Provident, Rhode IslandBulletin on March 6, 1956, which rose editorially to challenge the official explanation fora mysterious skyquake. The Bulletin wrote:\"Every now and then, a noise like a giant thunderclap explodes over broadsections of Rhode Island, shaking homes, rattling windows, and alarmingcitizenry. The common assumption is that the noise comes from a jet planebreaking through the sound barrier. Local military air commands, though,seem to be forming the habit of issuing denials, each time the thing happens,that any of their aircraft could have caused the blast. Exactly this occurred"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"last Saturday for the second time in recent weeks. However accurate theymight be, these automatic denials serve no useful public purpose. Frightenedcitizens don't want to know what did not happen, but what did. And they havea right to be told. ...People are jittery enough these days, and they aren't goingto be reassured by piecemeal official denials that don't explain anything.\"Remarks like these would hardly indicate that its editor had succumbed to censorship. Ifsuch extreme controls existed, no newspaper, including the Bulletin, would be free tocriticize the authorities.More evidence, this counteracting the charge that newswire services smother saucer news- and coming as a surprise to me - was an International News Service (INS) story whichbroke December 18, 1954. It read as follows:\"GROUP DEFIES IKE'S DENIAL - The publisher of CRIFO Newsletterchallenged President Dwight Eisenhower's recent statement that there is noreason to believe the phenomena (saucers) are from another planet. LeonardStringfield said in a letter to the President that the Air Force possessesevidence supporting his belief the saucers are interplanetary vehicles.Stringfield asked that the Air Force release this evidence, which he saidconsisted of films and the evaluation reports of these films. The publisherclaimed Air Force conclusions about the saucers are so serious that someofficers have been threatened with court martial if they talk too freely.\"Unaccountably, my letter of rebuttal to Ike somehow was picked up by INS after I hadoffered it to United Press and Associated Press where it was spurned. The AP office toldme they would have to check first with their New York Bureau. But when I phoned thenext day, I learned AP had killed it. But the INS report apparently had stirred up a hornet'snest. Hard on its heels came a Scripps-Howard blast. In an article about civilian saucerresearch, Robert Carter of the Washington, D. C. office singled out my letter to PresidentEisenhower as a prime target and commented: \"Stringfield was all worked up.\" Crater alsotook slaps at researchers Max Miller, Jim Moseley and Meade Layne. But most significantwas the fact that INS carried the story - and certainly any decree by the government whichwould gag UP and AP would also include INS.Exploding the myth of censorship once and for all was the Admiral Delmar Fahrneystatement on behalf of NICAP (National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena)headquartered in Washington, D. C., and publisher of The U.F.O. Investigator. Hisstatement made every front page and newscast in the USA on January 16, 1957. In brief,Admiral Fahrney said, \"There are objects coming into our atmosphere at very high speeds.No agency in this country or in Russia is able to duplicate at this time the speeds andaccelerations which radar and visual observers indicate these unidentified flying objectsare able to achieve. There are signs that an intelligence directs these objects because of theway they fly; the way they change position in formations would indicate that their motionis navigated and controlled.\"Commented C.S.I. of New York in their May 1957 News Letter: \"...All that's needed to getUFOs back on the front pages is a saucer story involving an eminent military man.\"Summarizing, I cannot believe at this writing that anyone of our great newspapers isinterlaced in a conspiracy to censor saucer information. Perhaps the answer to theirseeming errant behavior is in keeping with the words expressed by John DuBarry: \"Ifthey're silent, we can blame them for being negligent or gullible, but not for beingcensored.\" Although DuBarry might be correct, I also believe i is true that on occasionsour editors - and particularly the newswires - have been \"requested not to write this orthat\" about a UFO incident, which seems to be the case in England as pointed out by theBritish Flying Saucer Review. Such, however, if true, not only confirms the handclasp of a\"gentleman's agreement\" in the U.S.A., but also suggests there is an Anglo-American fearin having its people know what is hidden under the lid of the Pandora's Box.The British publication, Uranus, wrote: \"...The press in England is not censored, but theirstaffs include science editors who have friends in the 'right places,' and with a knowledgeof the methods employed in official departments, these reporters know only too well theofficial viewpoint on the subject of flying saucers.\" THE SPOILS OF SILENCEWhatever other reason there is for the unpublished stories such as the Cincinnati jetintercept of August 23, 1957, many would be lost to public interest if it were not for thesounding boards of civilian research organizations which collect valuable information fromworldwide, fact-hunting correspondents. Commenting on CRIFO, the \"inside-looking-out\"saucer author, Edward Ruppelt, once wrote me: \"I must say that yo have a very effective"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"'report collection net' established.\" Following are typical cases published in Orbit, which noone newspaper dared to probe beyond their headlines, but required time and effort on thepart of a voluntary investigator.Case 299, investigated by Mrs. I. E. Epperson of Burbank, California, whobrought to light additional facts concerning the object hovering overLockheed Aviation Plant on February 13, 1957.Case 296, investigated by Kenneth Smith of Knoxville, Tennessee, who tied ina local smog mystery with a fireball's passing over on January 21, 1957.Cases 247 through 251 and 255 through 263, each bearing copious clippingswith personal investigations and observations sent in by Ray Scrimshaw ofMinnesota; Claressa Van Hoof of Williston, North Dakota; Elmer Dahl of St.Paul, Minnesota; and Charles Follick of Great Falls, Montana, during the bigflap over the North Central states in November to December 1956.Case 218, investigated assiduously by Dean Strawn of Corona, California,who produced valuable concatenating evidence of a skyquake, a forest fireand a UFO, September 12, 1956.Case 217, investigated by Richard Hall of New Orleans - a researcher whocontributed heavily to CRIFO files and then published Satellite. Hall trackeddown reports of objects cavorting over New Orleans on September 12, 1956.Case 200, investigated by C. H. Marck of Denver, who kept me posted almostdaily on the spate of incidents occurring near Ft. Collins, Colorado, in August1956.On the other hand are those with experiences to tell who shrink away from publicity,fearing ridicule or that they are treading on security. Frequently, I have received excellentreports from individuals who denied the right to publish their information; or the writersrequested anonymity. \"I'll be laughed right out of my job,\" was one remark. Another goodone: \"My wife thinks I'm nuts already. She hears of this and she'll leave me for sure.\"I always tried to laugh with them, but a few were truly worried about information releasedinadvertently. I remember one case involved an engineer who returned to Cincinnati fromArizona with a very lucid report of what he had encountered on his trip. Obligingly, hetook the time to write it up on the request of a friend of mine, who in turn obliginglysubmitted the report to CRIFO for review in Newsletter. When the sighter learned of this, Iwas told he almost went into shock and demanded that his report be destroyed. In hisopinion, what he had seen was a U. S. secret weapon and he spent weeks fearing that hisreport had violated national security. I dismissed the case, not even alluding to it in mybulletin, although it would have tied in with other material on hand.Another case in which fear of consequence prevented the investigator from obtainingvaluable direct confirmation involved a weird and most unusual sighting. The eyewitness'sfear kept it from reaching the press, except for Orbit. C. W. Fitch of Cleveland, Ohio,attempted to follow up certain leads in a Jacksonville, Florida incident (Orbit Case No.162, May 9, 1956). This involved the experience of two girls who were terrified by alow-hovering object over a bus stop late at night.A thorough follow-up of this case was made by Fitch in an attempt to obtain additionalinformation and confirmation of the occurrence. He succeeded in locating the driver of thebus and obtaining his written confirmation of having seen the objects, backing up the girls'story, but beyond that his perseverance was greeted by cold silence. He was desirous ofobtaining the additional testimonials of two gentlemen who were passengers aboard thebus that evening and who had also observed the two mysterious devices which hadfrightened the girls so badly. Numerous courteous letters, mailed registered, failed to elicitany reply from these two witnesses.Fitch got direct confirmation of the incident from three of the principals involved, JoanFrost, Gertie Wynn and Wallace L. Marlowe, the driver. Excerpts from their letters areincluded at this point since they are highly illuminating as to their personal reactions at thetime.Joan Frost: \"The object was surrounded by an eerie red mist of light with a brighter red,almost like a flame, shining through three cracks of a door in the bottom of it. We saw thedoor which was closed and seemed to be quite a good size, but did not take too muchnotice of it because when we saw that it looked like we were going to get picked up. I gotterrified and started to run.\"Gertie Wynn: \"It went just above our heads. There was definitely no sound at all. I surehad a fear of being kidnapped. It was also an exciting feeling of something different.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Wallace L. Marlowe: \"I was the operator of the bus that was mentioned by Miss Frostand I remember the occurrence quite well. As I approached the corner, I saw two strangeobjects in the air just above the girls and ahead of my bus. I pulled on down to where theywere standing and stopped. I remember the girls were badly frightened when they boardedthe bus and I believe they mentioned something to the effect they thought they were aboutto be kidnapped. As I looked at the objects as they hovered just above us for a second andthen they both went up into the air at a high rate of speed. There was absolutely no soundof any kind. These objects, whatever they were, were quite large. As I recall, one wasslightly smaller than the other. They appeared to be round. There was a slight red glowfrom the underside and a bright light on the top of each one. I have no idea what theywere, but I do know they were not jet aircraft. It gave me a very eerie feeling which I stillrecall.\"Indirect confirmation eventually was obtained from the two passengers referred to as Mr.W. T. Hill and Mr. C. R. Lewis, both of Jacksonville, Florida. Fitch had related theJacksonville sighting to a friend, Mr.Bob Albers, past-president of the Cleveland AviationClub who then became interested in it. While on a vacation in Florida, during March 1957,Albers made it a point to call on Marlowe, Hill and Lewis. On his return to Cleveland, heacquainted Fitch with the fact that all three of these individuals talked freely to him ofhaving seen the strange objects. While willing to discuss and confirm their sightingverbally, the latter two were apparently apprehensive of putting anything in writingrelating to it. However, the additional verbal confirmation received through Albers helps toplace this case in the top bracket of authentic and reliably confirmed UFO sightings. THE DANCE OF 'LIFE'A horse of a different color in the publishing business is Life magazine, the pictorial bigbrother of Time - both of which carry big sticks of influence everywhere in USA! In 1952,Lif e published a sensational feature article entitled, \"Have We Visitors From Space?\" inwhich its authors, H. B Darrach, Jr., and Robert Ginna, presented \"scientific evidence thatthere is a real case for interplanetary flying saucers.\" Commented Robert Ginna in a laterarticle in Lif e: \"...the story prompted an unprecedented response from the readers.\"On March 5, 1955, on behalf of CRIFO, I wrote to Lif e's editorial office: \"In respect toLif e's silence on 'saucers' since its big expose, 'Have We Visitors From Space?' in 1952,might this writer construe such to mean that nothing has since happened to alter thatbelief? By that, I mean the hypothesis that 'saucers' are interplanetary.On March 25, 1955, Life answered: \"Many thanks for your letter of March 6. Unhappily,in sending it on to the editors for consideration, it has been lost - or so very well misplacedthat all our efforts have failed to locate it in the right editor's suggestion folder. Would yoube good enough to send me a copy? This time, I will see that it receives prompt attention.\"On March 27, 1955, I sent a carbon copy as requested. Having heard nothing by May 2, Iwrote a follow-up. My letter read in part, \"slightly flabbergasted, I'm still awaiting yourreply to either my original letter of March 5, 1955, or its copy duplicate mailed at yourrequest on March 27, 1955. You promised that my second letter would receive promptattention, but I see that another month has rolled by and still no answer.\" I ended my letterrepeating my earlier question.Finally on May 12, I received the following reply from which I quote: \"Unfortunately, theeditors report that they are unable to fit another 'flying saucers' article into upcomingschedules - at least for the time being. They will, however, keep the subject at hand andperhaps it can be reconsidered later on.\"On May 17, I wrote, \"Your letter of May 12, in reply to mine of May 2, is received and thewriter is grateful for your prompt reply. However, your answer leaves this writer mystifiedin that it obliquely evades the question asked in a series of letters dating back to March 5,1955. In view of Life's silence on the subject - despite new and material evidence - itseems, therefore, safe to conclude that Life's present opinion and policy remainsunchanged and thus, still upholds the belief that UFOs (saucers) are interplanetaryvehicles.\"Two more follow-ups never brought answers. Obviously, a game of hocus pocus, I thought.Probably the easiest way for Life to get itself off the hook. But perhaps there was a reason- the same reason which impelled Life and Time to treat the saucer problem so sleazilysince 1952. I thought I knew why.\"Continued in Part 6 - UFO Film and Mysterious Green Fire Balls"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"More Information:For further information about Leonard Stringfield's UFO Status Reports, please see reprintsbelow from the Earthfiles Archives:Status Reports I• 10/25/2005 -- Final Part 6: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 10/13/2005 -- Part 5: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 10/05/2005 -- Part 4: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 09/30/2005 -- Part 3: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 09/26/2005 -- Part 2: Retrievals of the Third Kind - Kingman, Arizona Crash• 09/25/2005 -- Part 1: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary CustodyStatus Reports II• 09/19/2005 -- Final Part 9: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/17/2005 -- Part 8: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/14/2005 -- Part 7: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/06/2005 -- Part 6: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 08/22/2005 -- Part 5: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 08/17/2005 -- Part 4: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/20/2005 -- Part 3: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/14/2005 -- Part 2: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/12/2005 -- Part 1: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New DataStatus Reports III• 07/05/2005 -- Final Part 15: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 06/20/2005 -- Part 14: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 06/17/2005 -- Part 13: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 05/10/2005 -- Part 12: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 05/04/2005 -- Part 11: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 04/19/2005 -- Part 10: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence © June 1982 byLeonard H.
