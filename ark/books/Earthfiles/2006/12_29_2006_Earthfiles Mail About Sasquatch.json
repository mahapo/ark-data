I happened to be on tour (I am a guitarist and recording engineer) andwhile in Crescent City, CA, back in '93, I stopped in at the local newspaper tomeet with Steve Selke, a reporter who had broken the Owen story thru theAP. I am a graduate in Anthropology, Humboldt State, 1979, studied primateswith Rosalind Ribnick (no longer at HSU). She was very influential andpersuasive about the sasquatch existing in the local area. I went on to work asan archaeologist with CalTrans, District 9 in Bishop. Bill Michael, the curatorat the museum in Independence , CA has told me of bigfoot sightings in theSierras as recent as last summer. Anyway, Mr. Selke was 'run out of town on arail' after his bigfoot stories appeared in the paper...\"Darrell put me and the singer up for the night, took us back up the mountainwhere his son Josh had first seen the creature and showed us footprints andcasts he made as well as hair samples. WE heard the shrieks coming from themountain at night. Judy Del Ponte, property owner in the area told Darrell afamily of 5 creatures were living on her property and had been there for 20years or more. This is about 20-25 miles due west of where the Patterson filmwas shot. I saw his video, uncut, before it was aired on Sightings, completewith expletives and definite glowing red eyes.\"I have a cassette of some screams that dates back to the '70's, I believe, andit sounds identical to what we heard at Kitson Springs (located just over theWillamette Pass, southwest of Bend, Oregon, HWY 58, I think. Anyway, Ibelieve these creatures do live in and travel thru the lava tubes that are vastand unmapped throughout California, Oregon and Washington. I collected an81/2x11 sheet of paper with a drawing of \"Sasquatch and Family\" taken fromthe ranger station at Castle Crags State Park. When I showed this to 2 femalerangers at McCarthur-Burney Falls park, also in California, where sightingswere prevalent last year, they were a bit horrified to see them portrayed as'gentle woodland creatures.' ... The screams we heard are forever etched intomy memory and the sound of the taped shrieks literally gives me horrendouschills up and down my spine and I get tears and shaky as well. I guess I wastoo skinny to eat!\"I had one other encounter in 1983 near Bend, Oregon - actually it was atKitson Springs. We were screamed at for about 20 minutes while we (mysister and girlfriend) lay still, trying to pretend to be dead. It finally ran away,shrieking as if it were warning others that we had beaten them to the spring.Feel free to contact me if you'd like, and thanks for your tireless andwonderful work.\"2) On Dec 29, 2006, Danny Adair from Oregon wrote:\"Big foot ...

He started making the loud shrilly screams at us. As wepaddled along the shore line this big male followed us along the shore. Hewould stop at times and make very aggressive gestures but never stoppedmaking the loud shrilly screams until it finally turned and went into the trees.This took place at around 2:00 pm.\"I had a Sasquatch walk into my camp at night as the campfire was dyingdown. This Sasquatch walked straight over to my ice chest that was sitting onthe ground. This Sasquatch took the lid off and reached down to get a packageof hamburger meat that was sitting on the block ice. This Sasquatch took outthe hamburger and unwrapped it from the freezer paper. This Sasquatch thentook half of the hamburger meat then put the other half, still in paper, backinto the ice chest. This Sasquatch put the ice chest lid back on, not straight,and then walked off into the dark woods. This Sasquatch must have had akeen sense of smell and showed a good level of intelligence. I have often seenProbes just before, during or just after my encounters with Sasquatch... butnot always.\"There are to many guys around this area that would go out hunting for thisbeing..with the wish only to kill one.
