S. Navy physicist, Bruce Maccabee, about hisdiscussions with a USAF geophysicist referred to as \"Hawk.\" See two-part 012106Earthfiles. I also reported more about former New Mexico State Representative AndrewKissner's (Dona Ana County, Las Cruces) investigations of V-2 rocket research at WhiteSands Proving Ground in 1947 when aerial discs interfered with launches. See \"PeculiarPhenomenon\" Real X-Files series beginning with 121905 Earthfiles. Since these several reports, I have received more than a hundred e-mails from people whohave either firsthand military and/or intelligence backgrounds, or are relatives of peoplewho have such backgrounds. Many have asked that their identity remain anonymous. Ifeel it is valuable to share some of the e-mails and hope other Earthfiles viewers and radiolisteners will contact me with additional information that complements, or goes beyond,what I am posting in this first in a series of Earthfiles military voices.Continued from 020706Earthfiles:Military Voices Respond to January 2006Earthfiles and Radio Reports 7) Naval Officer Says UFO Shot Down by U. S. in 1940s\"I wanted to relate the story of my father, who was a U. S. Navy officer from1941 to 1973. From 1962 to 1973, he was a captain and during this period, hewas granted the highest security clearance which was referred to as a 'supersecurity clearance.' Naturally, this gave him the ability to see and hear aboutthe most classified material. He was also the Reserve CO of NAS Twin Citiesin Minneapolis from 1969 until the base was decommissioned in 1970.Because of his rank, security clearance and the fact he possessed a bachelor'sin science from Eastern Michigan University, he was selected in 1965 toattend what was called a 'West Coast Weapons Seminar' sponsored by themilitary and contractors Lockheed and Aerojet-General, which togetherworked on the Polaris missile project at the time. The meetings took place atthe Naval Base at Point Hueneme, California, and the emphasis was onpropulsion systems. My father stated that roughly 50 scientists andhigh-ranking military officers were in attendance at the 1965 seminar.\"Upon listening to your news update on Coast (January 20, 2006), I decidedto pose some questions to my father. Mind you, he had not listened to theshow. In fact, he never has heard Coast to Coast AM, so his answers could notbe influenced by any media. I began asking him if the subject of ETs andUFOs was ever discussed at the very classified 1965 seminar. He initiallystated that he really could not get into specifics of what was discussed.\"Then I asked - if based on what he might have heard or seen at the seminar -did he believe ETs existed. He said, 'Well, I would say yes.' After what was a'pregnant pause,' he actually SHOCKED me by volunteering the following.'Well, there was a craft shot down.' I asked, 'What craft was shot down?' Hereplied, 'A UFO had been shot down some years before ... I believe it was thelate 1940s.' I asked, 'Was it one of more than one?' He stated that to his"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"knowledge, just one had been shot down. This seemed to dovetail with whatyou discussed on Coast to Coast.\"He added that the V-2 program you referred to was, he believed, utilizedexclusively by the Navy for the subsequent development of the Polarisintercontinental missile and that the Navy was many years ahead of the otherservices in missile technology.\"As you would understand, none of this material was brought home by himand was strictly 'For Eyes Only' and discourse was only among a relativelylimited group of officers and scientists. Although today he is 86, he maintainsa relatively sharp mind and his knowledge of the military remains quiteawesome. As a highly-decorated officer, he always was extremely level-headed and thoroughly professional. During his tenure as a captain, he alsomade visits to NORAD, Ellsworth AFB in South Dakota, offut AFB nearOmaha, NAS Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico, and served a short time at thePentagon.\" 8) USAF Security Sergeant, Elgin AFB, Watched UFOs Through Binoculars\"I was an Air Force Security Sergeant at Eglin AFB, Florida, years ago, andsaw through Admiral 'Bull' Halsey's own binoculars two spacecraft movingthrough space from points far out in space from point A toward point B.\"Anyway, I think that Earth got the attention of the recent ET folks in 1945when we detonated the first nuclear weapons. When Harry Truman signed the'National Security Act' into law in 1947, I believe he unwittingly signed awayour republic! It's the birth of the 'National Security State.'\"The absolutely most stupid thing that Earth's present governments can do isdemonstrate hostility toward these advanced ETs!\" 9) Manzano Base Employee, Albuquerque, NM, in Late 1980s\"I still wonder on a daily basis about what bodies would have required storageinside morgue drawers set into the solid granite of an alcove behind asubstantial locked gate - -an alcove that was behind another inner gate for aroom marked 'Morgue' on old blueprints that I saw while I worked insideManzano Base. At that time in late 1980s, Manzano Base was guarded bypimply-faced SPs with orders to shoot to kill. There were three fences - themiddle one gave us our entertainment if we ventured outside of the mountainat lunch time, particularly on a rainy day. Tumble weeds would just go 'poof'when they hit that middle fence.\"I realized that special weapons were stored at that time; thus, the insanelyhigh security at Manzano. However, we had our own pimply-faced SPs whoguarded our tunnels and we were not working with anything that I would call'extraterrestrially weird.' It was just terrestrial stuff that I may or may not be atliberty to talk about, but I'll err on the side of caution and still not talk about.\"Anyway, why were those morgue drawers so protected?? Manzano, by theway, is way the heck out at the edge of Kirtland AFB. If you can get on baseand drive down Wyoming until it ends, it ends at Manzano. I know it's beenfully declassified/deactivated, so the fence and all that might no longer bethere.\"Also, anything about underground areas at Wright-Patterson AFB? I workedin Area C and there were a lot of air ventilators poking up in a very largeotherwise empty field out near where I worked which was the Joint LogisticsSystems Center (JLSC).\" 10) UFOs On Radar At NORAD Base in North Carolina in Early 1970s\"I joined the U. S. Air Force in 1970 and have been on active duty and in theUSAF Reserve ever since. I will be retiring this year. From 1972 to 1974, Iwas stationed at a small radar site (701st Radar Squadron, Fort Fisher AirForce Station, Kure Beach, North Carolina). The base was part of NORAD. Iwas in communications and we ran the teletypes and switchboard for the base."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"We handled very little classified traffic, so when the people in the radar roomsdownstairs brought classified traffic up to the communications center, it was anotable occasion.\"Also notable (at least for me since I have always been interested in UFOs)were the telephone calls we would occasionally get from off base about lightsor UFOs out over the ocean. When we got one of these calls, we always notedit in our Master Station log. Most of the time, the calls would be put throughto the radar officers downstairs, but occasionally they would be busydownstairs and we would take down the information and then pass it on. Idon't know where the information went from there.\"During my first summer there in 1972, I started noticing something. Theradar would occasionally go down. When this happened, we would get a shortclassified message to send out and what it usually said was that the radar wasdown and they were running diagnostics. At some point after that, we wouldget another classified message to send out that would say either that the radarwas back up and it would state what the problem had been; or we would senda message that said the radar was 'running rabbits.'\"I was curious and asked what 'running rabbits' was and was told it meant theycould not find a problem. They had run all the internal diagnostics and theradar was working properly, so the consensus was that it was interferencefrom outside the system.\"That summer was also very active for lights being seen out over the oceanand we got a lot of telephone calls late on swing shifts or during midnightshifts. The typical call would be from someone who had been walking on thebeach or out on one of the piers at night anywhere from Wrightsville Beachdown the coast through Holden Beach. The people usually told aboutwatching lights out over the ocean where the horizon should be. They wereusually red, but sometimes were orange or deep yellow. Everyone alwaysassumed that the lights were shrimp boats or fishing boats until the lightswould suddenly shoot up into the sky and disappear. I could visualize whatthey were talking about because I had seen similar lights over Lake Huron andLake Michigan when I was a kid growing up in Michigan.\"I started seeing a connection between the sightings of the lights and the radarbeing down. And not just the radar being down, but the radar 'running rabbits.'The calls got so common that summer. We worked rotating shifts and Ipersonally took close to a dozen reports from late spring through early fall1972. Multiply that by three other shifts and it potentially was quite a fewreports. The radar OIC (officer in charge) asked that we not even put the callsthrough to the radar room and just take the information down at theswitchboard and pass it on to them.\"I remember one call particularly. It was early on a midnight shift, probablyaround 0100. The caller identified himself as Airman something, US Air ForceReserve. He sounded a little shook up. He said that he and his girlfriend hadbeen out on the end of the Kure Beach Pier, closest to the base, and they hadbeen sitting on one of the fishing benches when a light caught his eye. Hepointed it out to her. It was red and was moving slowly from right to left andback again. He said he was telling her that it was probably a shrimp boat whenit suddenly shot up to about 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon. He was verydetailed in his description, even mentioning that there was no moon, that itwas a clear night. He said the red light hovered there for a couple of minuteswhile he and his girlfriend speculated about what it was.\"He decided that it was probably a helicopter, maybe a boat had gone downand the coast guard was doing a search. He said that about the time he hadmade that speculation, the light started to get larger. At first he thought it wasexpanding. Then he realized that it was actually moving toward them. He saidthat they sat and watched as it very quickly approached them and then passeddirectly over them at a speed that no helicopter could achieve. He said it waseven faster than a fighter jet. What really freaked him out was that there wasNO SOUND whatsoever, not even a rush of air and that the lights on the pierflickered and went out as it approached, as did the lights in the building on thebeach where the pier started and there were street lights. Then the lights cameback on as the red light moved away from the toward the mainland. He andhis girlfriend immediately went back to his house, about a fifteen minutesdrive, and he called the base and made his report.\"The interesting thing that I noticed was that almost every time I got a call"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"about lights or a UFO, the radar was down running rabbits or would be in thenext few minutes. But I didn't get a call every time the radar was runningrabbits. Sometimes the radar would go down during daylight hours. Just tocheck my observations and satisfy my curiosity, I pulled out station logs andmessage logs from other shifts and found that they were pretty much the sameas mine. If someone reported lights or a UFO, the radar was down.\"At one point, I talked to one of the radar officers about this and asked him ifhe thought it was possible that the radar was being jammed. At first he quotedthe official AF statement that this radar was virtually unjammable. But thenhe grinned and shrugged and said that he could not think of what else it mightbe.\" 11) White Sands Missile Range, 1964\"I now realize that I was not imagining what I witnessed in a late evening walkwhile I was stationed at White Sands Missile Range in 1964. I was formerlytrained by the U. S. Army at Redstone Arsenal Ordnance Guided MissileSchool and then I was assigned to an Honest John, Little John and LanceMissile testing unit. The contractor for the Lance Missile was LTV.\"Having had a SECRET clearance, I had been to some of the most sensitiveareas of White Sands, the V-2 launch pad, the 'Blockhouse,' Trinity site, andso on. I had some knowledge of the history of those areas prior to being there,including the Lonnie Zamora episode that was alleged to have occurred duringthe time that I was assigned to WSMR, not far from Socorro. I was19-years-old in 1964 and was involved in firing missiles every month fromvarious sites on the ranges at White Sands.\"We did testing of the missiles under all conditions imaginable and someunimaginable. The situation that placed me in a late night walk at about 20:00hours was as follows. I was enroute from the Billets to the Bus Terminal tobring another soldier back to the Billets where he would be staying for thenight before moving on to his assigned area. The Terminal near the MotorPool was about 1.5 miles away, using the conventional route of sidewalks androads. But being of the mindset to shorten that route, I decided to cut acrossthe open fields that were less than conventional. Marveling at the night skyand the clarity with which I could see the stars, I then saw a sight that I couldnot help but wonder if it had something to do with all the other White Sandsactivity? Across the night sky came this streaking light without a sound andnot much of a tail as would be associated with a meteor. It moved from myright to left and was moving at a rate of speed that I could not gauge, but I cansay that it was moving faster than any aircraft that I had seen in my short19-year life. What set this moving light apart from anything that I had everseen was the fact that as fast as it was streaking across the night sky, suddenlywithout slowing its speed, it made a 90-degree turn upward and within a flash,it disappeared into infinity.\"I was completely stunned at what I saw and when I met with the Ft. Blisssoldier, I was stumbling all over my words trying to express what I had seen. Iwas met with disbelief when I told some other in the unit, including a coupleof commissioned officers. Whether or not my story was believed or not, it wasmighty coincidental that I suddenly found myself on an overseas levy (theonly person shipped from my unit) and wound up in Italy.\" 12) USAF Fighter Wing Moved from Hawaii to Fly Patrol Over Alamogordo,NM\"I served in the U. S. Air Force from 1947 to 1951 as an enlisted man. In1949, I was stationed in Hawaii with the 81st Fighter Wing of the 7th AirForce. In the summer of 1949, the entire Fighter Wing was shipped back tothe states. All the aircraft, P-47s, were left at Wheeler Field on Oahu.\"The Fighter Wing was being transferred to Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque.Kirtland had been in moth balls since the end of the war. We reactivated thatbase. The 81st Fighter Wing received the first jet fighter planes (F-86s) issuedto the Air Force.\"I never thought of it then, but over the years since I have often wonderedwhy the (Pentagon) moved our whole Fighter Wing of maybe 2,000 or 3,000"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"troops and 90 fighter pilots clear across the Pacific Ocean and set up newoperations at Kirtland? We had first been ordered to move to Selfridge FieldAFB, Michigan. We had already stenciled Selfridge on our footlockers. Thedecision higher up to change destinations was late in coming.\"The word on the base was always, 'Our mission is to fly patrol overAlamogordo.' But thinking back on it, questions arise: If you need a fleet offighter planes to patrol an air space, where and what is the threat? Who waspatrolling the place before we got the assignment?\"One year later in 1950, the whole Fighter Wing was shipped out to MosesLake AFB, Washington. Once again we reactivate an Air Force Base whichhad been mothballed at the end of WWII. Our mission there, we were told,was to 'fly patrol for the Hanford atomic energy site.' I was discharged there in1951. The Fighter Wing was still intact, fulfilling its mission.\"Military voices continued in Part 3.More Information:For more information about UFO/E.T. phenomena, please see the following reports inEarthfiles Archives :Â· 02/05/2006 -- Part 11 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collectand Analyze Flying DiscsÂ· 01/27/2006 -- Part 2: Navy Physicist and USAF Geophysicist Discuss UFOs and ETsÂ· 01/20/2006 -- Part 1: Navy Physicist and USAF Geophysicist Discuss UFOs and ETsÂ· 01/17/2006 -- Part 9 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collectand Analyze Flying DiscsÂ· 01/13/2006 -- 31st Cattle Mutilation on Red Bluff, California RanchÂ· 12/21/2005 -- Updated: Part 2 - Peculiar Phenomenon, Early United States Effortsto Collect and Analyze Flying DiscsÂ· 12/02/2005 -- Abduction by Grey ETs in Huge, Black TriangleÂ· 11/11/2005 -- Part 3: An Alleged 1953 UFO Crash and Burial Near Garrison, UtahÂ· 11/10/2005 -- Part 2: An Alleged 1953 UFO Crash and Burial Near Garrison, UtahÂ· 11/02/2005 -- Part 3: Unusual Animal Deaths -Sheep Mutilations in Moortown,Dartmoor, EnglandÂ· 10/27/2005 -- Updated: Five \"Satellites\" That Merged As One StarÂ· 10/25/2005 -- Part 6 - Final: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of AllegedUFOs and Occupants in Military CustodyÂ· 10/13/2005 -- Part 5: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOsand Occupants in Military CustodyÂ· 10/07/2005 -- Part 1: Beam Technology Lifted Body Near Ft.
