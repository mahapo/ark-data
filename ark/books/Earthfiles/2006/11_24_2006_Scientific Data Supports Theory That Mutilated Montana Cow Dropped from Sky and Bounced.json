Conrad is the county seat of Pondera. The most recent cow mutilationoccurred in Valier, 25 miles northwest of Conrad. From the early 1970s to 2006, rashes ofmutilations have repeated every few years. In 2001, the Pondera County Sheriff'sOffice investigated fourteen cases officially reported and knew aboutanother half dozen cases not officially reported.November 24, 2006 Valier, Pondera County, Montana - This week I visited MontanaPondera County Sheriff Tom Kuka and his Chief Deputy Dick Dailey and Deputy EdErickson in their Conrad Court House offices. I was there to work with a Toronto, Canada,company producing a series entitled Best Evidence to air on The Discovery Channel in2007. I traveled with field segment producer, Michael Sheehan, and his freelancecameraman Douglas Monroe from Pleasant View, Utah, and audioman Mike Kasic fromMontana, to join Sheriff Kuka and his deputies at the John and Patricia Peterson ranch inValier northwest of Conrad. Conrad has a population of 3,000 and Valier about 500.On October 8, the Petersons had moved part of their cattle herd into one of their Valierfields after barley was harvested. The ranchers knew that everything was fine at 5 p.m.that afternoon before they locked the gate and went home. Early the next morning onOctober 9, a neighbor saw the cow laying about fifty feet behind the Peterson's barbedwire fence along the county road, but did not report the downed cow. Later, by October11, 2006, the Petersons discovered the dead and mutilated cow and called Sheriff Kuka.See: 101706 Earthfiles. Several ranch families within a mile of the cow's mutilated bodyon the west and north never saw or heard anything unusual. About a mile to the east is aU.S. Air Force missile launch control station."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Looking south on gravel county road in Valier, Montana, 25 miles northwestof Conrad. Pink arrow points to cow's dead and mutilated body as a deputy approached.Image by Pondera County Chief Deputy, Dick Dailey.On November 21, as our vans rolled down the gravel county road, the large, black cowstood out on the beige stubble field in the afternoon sun. By then, it had been about sixweeks since her death, but no coyote or other predator had taken any bites from her body.However, there had been a human intruder. A local resident said that a Montana NBCaffiliate reporter had cut off the cow's head on Saturday, November 18, before we arrived.One of the Peterson's neighbors said the reason for the head removal was to have aMontana college lab examine it. But the Petersons told me no one had asked them forpermission to remove the head.The rest of the visible body showed the udder had been removed in a somewhat circularcut like the rectal/vaginal region. In addition to the excised udder and rectal/vaginal hole,back on October 11-12, 2006, Sheriff Kuka and deputies found the cow's left ear, eyeball,circle of tissue around the eye, tongue, and jaw flesh had also been removed. Altogether,that list of removed tissues is typical of worldwide animal mutilations since at least the1960s.Sheriff Tom Kuka and Pondera County Sheriff Deputies examined headof mutilated cow on October 12, 2006.

Image © 2006 by Pondera County Sheriff's Office.Cow Bounced On GroundThe Sheriff had called me after his first October visits to the Peterson ranch to tell methere appeared to be a bounce mark some four to five feet southeast of the dead cow'sbody. The soil was shoved up against the north side of the mark, suggesting that the1300-pound cow had dropped from high enough above to hit the ground with considerableforce and bounced to its final resting place with its legs and head pointed north.Near center of photograph is the bounce mark amid barley stubble where Sheriff Tom Kukaand his deputies found the barley broken off and the soil piled up to the north only a few feetfrom where the cow bounced down a second time, dead and mutilated. The cow's headin upper left corner shows the sky-facing jaw stripped of flesh.Image by Pondera County Chief Deputy, Dick Dailey.One of the mysteries, Sheriff Kuka told me, was that even though the physical groundevidence indicated the cow had bounced south to north, all the 6-inch-high barley stubbleunderneath her body was neatly lined up and flattened to the ground north to south in theopposite direction."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Deputies lifted mutilated cow up and found barley stubble underneathwas all neatly laid down north to south, the opposite direction of the soil piledup in bounce mark. Image by Pondera County Chief Deputy, Dick Dailey.I had arranged back in early October for Sheriff Kuka to talk with biophysicist W. C.Levengood in Michigan about how to sample the soil and young volunteer barley plantscoming up amid the stubble. Today I interviewed W. C. Levengood in his lab about hisanalyses so far, which support Sheriff Kuka's theory that the Peterson cow was droppedfrom above, already dead and mutilated.W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist, Ph.D.-eq, Pinelandia BiophysicalLaboratory, Grass Lake, Michigan. Photograph © by Linda Moulton Howe.Interview:W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist and Ph.D.-Eq, Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory,Grass Lake, Michigan: “I call these bovine excisions because the alterations in the tissueon the cow are not only very consistent, but they are very precise.What I had here in the Pondera County cow - thanks to Sheriff Tom Kuka’s good work - Ihad excellent soil and barley samples to investigate. The samples were taken at variousdistances from the cow. In the north and west directions, I found pretty much the samething I’ve found in most of the mutilation sites. As you proceed from the animal, theenergy in the plants and soil that I’m able to measure increases to about 20 feet from thecow (20-foot-diameter circle around mutilated animals where measured energies arehigher). Then energies typically and consistently drop off by distance from the deadanimals. That’s what I found in the Pondera County cow. But there were also surprisinganomalies.I’m measuring the CDP pulses, which are charge density plasmas. When I refer to chargedensity pulses, I am referring to ten years of data that I have studied since the mid-1990s.Dr. John Gedye and I published about these pulses of charges, which can be produced by anumber of things, including stress or impact pulses. These pulses are due to very specificclustering and organization of specific molecular isomers (different molecularconfigurations) in the matrix of the water molecules in what you are studying. In this case,I'm studying soil.[ Editor's Note: Biophysicist Levengood has been studying negatively andpositively charged ion energies in water, soils and plants since the mid-1990s.His work has been published in the respected botany journal, PhysiologiaPlantarum, the Journal for Scientific Exploration, and Subtle Energies andEnergy Medicine shown below. The reference to measured energies in thisPondera County mutilated cow research is a reference to \"charge densityplasmas.\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Levengood and Gedye publication © 2003 in Subtle Energies & Energy Medicine,Vol. 13, Number 2, Pages 131-153. Later, biophysicist Levengood changedthe name of the measured energy to \"charge density plasmas.\" ] Energy Impact 200 Feet South of CowBut south of the cow, the energies were extremely high.YOU FOUND THE GREATEST ENERGY CHANGE WAS 200 FEET SOUTH OF THEMUTILATED COW?Yes. That was a great anomaly to me. And I’ll explain more about that in a moment. Butthere are a couple of glaring exceptions.Sheriff Kuka thought there was a case here for the animal being dropped from above ontothe ground and then bounced, ending up a few feet away from a depression in the soil. Inthis depression, the barley plants had been knocked over and everything was pretty wellcrushed. So, I asked Sheriff Kuka to get soil in that depression and also roll the cow overand get soil under the cow.I ran the samples and was totally baffled that the soil in the depression (bounce mark) hadthe lowest energy of anything I’ve ever seen in my investigations of crop formations andbovine excision sites. The energy was almost zero. So far, I have never seen anything likethat and I’ve been looking at soil now for three years from crop formations and bovineexcisions.The soil underneath the cow was a little higher, but still extremely low, compared to thenormal control soil samples. That puzzled me and I kept measuring and looking at the dataand found another anomaly about 200 feet south of the cow. The energy there wasextremely high. That didn’t make a lot of sense because that far away is where we expectto have our baseline control samples. Well, this was no control!In the west and north samples, the energy was much lower and in the normal range I wouldexpect. So, I decided I had to concentrate how to solve the anomaly of the soil beneath thecow being such a low energy.In the past decade, I have tested soils to see what the energy in it looks like.Experimentally, when I tapped the sides of containers filled with soil, the energy went wayup. In other words, it indicated that the soil can contain energy. But in the Pondera Countycase, we find it was ultra low near the cow and bounce mark. Impact of Cow's Body On Soil"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Pink arrow points at dirt piled up along mutilated cow's back right leg.Green arrow points to bounce mark. Perhaps from force of impact, the intestinesare protruding from rectal hole, which in most animal mutilations is a dry, empty holepenetrating into the body. Image by Pondera County Chief Deputy, Dick Dailey.My hypothesis is that when the Pondera County cow was dropped, it reduced the naturalenergy in the water molecules of the soil. Normal silicate-type soils have a negative chargeon the little sand grains and crystals. That’s why - when a thunder cloud comes over withpositive charge on the bottom - it discharges itself to the Earth because the Earth isnegatively charged.So, I think the Montana cow of significant weight (1300 pounds) produced a wave or pulseof positive energy that neutralized the negative energy in the soil. So, at least temporarily,the soil near and under the cow had energy that was nearly zero.Right at the cow, the energy in the plants were also anomalously low. That would fit inbecause when the cow hit, the initial impact and second landing, the plant energies wereneutralized.AT THE BOUNCE MARK WHERE THE SOIL PILED UP AND WHERE THE COWLANDED.Right. I don’t recall ever having this tremendous degree of directionality (from south tonorth) in both the soil and plants that I saw here. Usually it’s in rings around the animals,not a specific direction.Pondera County Deputy Sheriff standing directly south of mutilated cowon Peterson Ranch in Valier, Montana. Plants and soil 200 feet south were mostintensely affected by energy changes, indicating a south to north direction up tothe cow's dropped body. Image by Pondera County Chief Deputy, Dick Dailey. Soil Impact TestsTo test my hypothesis, I devised a system of pendulums in the lab. I attached a weight tothe pendulum and got a container with flexible sides and filled it with soil and put mycharge collector plates down on the sides of the soil. From previous work the past threeyears, I put the charge collector plates on all four sides of the tank: north, east, south and"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"west.Then I did controlled impacts laterally, which would be parallel to the surface of theground. But it hit below the surface of my tank about half way down. Then I would get anenergy pulse in all four directions.What I found interesting in the Pondera County cow is that there was a much higherenergy going south to north than north to south. The data from my impact studies on soilsin my impact tanks agrees with the drop/bounce theory. That's why I saw such a very lowenergy in the soil near the mutilated cow where we think it first hit when it was droppedfrom above and bounced to the second position where it came to rest.YOU ALSO FOUND THAT THE ENERGY WAS LOW IN THE SOIL BENEATH THEBODY OF THE MUTILATED COW?But not nearly as low as the bounce mark and that fits in, too, because the cow did not fallas hard in the bounce to its final resting place. The bounce would not have been nearly ashigh as the cow was when she fell with considerable force from above onto the bouncemark.SO YOUR WORK SUPPORTS SHERIFF KUKA’S HYPOTHESIS THAT THE COW WASDROPPED FROM ABOVE ONTO THE GROUND. THEN THE IMPACT WITH THESOIL REDUCED THE CHARGED DENSITY PLASMA ENERGY IN THE SOIL.Right. Was Montana Cow Droppedfrom Advanced Beam Technology?Greeley Tribune, Greeley, Colorado, Sunday, November 2, 1980.IF WE ARE DEALING WITH AN ADVANCED BEAM TECHNOLOGY, AS SOMEEYEWITNESSES HAVE DESCRIBED, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE COW INPONDERA COUNTY WAS SUSPENDED IN THAT BEAM TECHNOLOGY AND WASMOVING AT AN ANGLE ON THE GROUND AND INTERACTED WITH THEGROUND PERHAPS AROUND 200 FEET FROM WHERE THE COW WASEVENTUALLY DROPPED?It might be. I have no way of saying precisely where the energy is coming from. Or what’scausing the energy. But it’s a reasonable hypothesis because I have found before at bovineexcision sites, where there is no physical evidence of dropping, that there is an indicationthat there is a peak in energy twenty feet from the animal, all around the animal. It makesa regular circle around the animal of high energy.THAT ALSO COULD BE EXPLAINED IF THERE WAS A BEAM THAT WASCASTING A CIRCLE ON THE GROUND AT THAT POINT WHERE THE ANIMALWAS DROPPED?That’s right, yes. That’s a possibility.SPECULATING FURTHER, IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE BEAM TECHNOLOGYCAUSED THE BARLEY STUBBLE TO LAY DOWN NORTH TO SOUTH BEFORETHE COW'S BODY HIT THE GROUND BOUNCING SOUTH TO NORTH?Maybe.\""},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"More Information:See Earthfiles Archives:• 08/03/2005 -- Another Cattle Mutilation in Pondera County, Montana• 01/18/2002 -- Part 2 - Cattle Mutilation Cases from the Pondera County, MontanaSheriff's Office• 01/12/2002 -- Part 1 - Update On 2001 Montana Cattle Mutilations14 Cattle Mutilations Reported to Pondera County Sheriff's Office (6 more unofficiallyreported) in 2001: June 12, 2001 - Don Reishus, Depuyer (Pondera County) - Mutilated cow.June 12, 2001 - Karl Rappold, Depuyer (Pondera County) - Alive bull withsevered tail.June 26, 2001 - Mark Taliaferro, Depuyer (Pondera County) - Mutilated cowwith blue-green color on jaw tissue.August 6, 2001 - Steve Young, Fort Shaw (Cascade County) - Mutilated cow.August 15, 2001 - Larry Elings, Browning (Glacier County) - Mutilatedyearling.August 15, 2001 - Doug Banka, Belt (Cascade County) - Mutilated cow.August 31, 2001 - Gerald Miller, Conrad (Pondera County) - Mutilated cow.September 24, 2001 - Jim Vandenbos, Conrad (Pondera County ) - Mutilatedcow with \"burned off\" hair.October 6, 2001 - Everett King, Valier (Pondera County) - MutilatedCharolais cow in impact crater.October 21, 2001 - New Miami Hutterite Colony, Dupuyer (Pondera County)- TWO mutilated cows.October 28, 2001 - Robert Lettenga, Conrad (Pondera County) - Mutilatedcow.November 1, 2001 - Glen Bouma, Conrad (Pondera County) - Mutilated8-month-old steer calf.December 8, 2001 - Dan Majerus, Conrad (Pondera County) - Mutilated13-year-old cow.For further information about animal mutilations, please see reports below in theEarthfiles Archives and my books, An Alien Harvest and the 2-volume book, Glimpses ofOther Realities in the Earthfiles Shop:• 10/19/2006 -- Another Cattle Mutilation in Pondera County, Montana• 10/02/2006 -- Unusual Deaths of Six Female Goats in White Salmon, Washington• 09/29/2006 -- Manipulation of Time and Matter by Non-Humans: The Experiences of Jim Sparks• 09/20/2006 -- Animal Mutilations Increase Again in Argentina• 09/20/2006 -- Updated: Three Sets of Concentric Rings in South Texas Field• 09/13/2006 -- Part 2: Enchanting Wheat Bundles of Charlbury, Wiltshire• 09/05/2006 -- Part 2: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet?• 09/04/2006 -- Part 1: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet?• 08/23/2006 -- More Cat and Dog Mutilations• 08/17/2006 -- Military Helicopter Aggression Toward Red Sphere in U.
