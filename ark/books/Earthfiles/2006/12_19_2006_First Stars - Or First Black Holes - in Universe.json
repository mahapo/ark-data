The remainingbackground light is from a period of time when the universe was less than one billion yearsold, and most likely originated from the universe's very first groups of objects - either hugestars or voracious black holes.

December 19, 2006 Greenbelt, Maryland - In this week's Astrophysical Journal Letters,NASA scientists report that \"new observations from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescopestrongly suggest that infrared light detected in a prior study originated from clumps of thevery first objects of the Universe. The recent data indicate this patchy light is splatteredacross the entire sky and comes from clusters of bright, monstrous objects more than 13billion light-years away.\"'We are pushing our telescopes to the limit and are tantalizingly close to getting a clearpicture of the very first collections of objects,' said Dr. Alexander Kashlinsky of NASA'sGoddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., lead author on two reports to appear in theAstrophysical Journal Letters. 'Whatever these objects are, they are intrinsically incrediblybright and very different from anything in existence today.' First Stars? First Black Holes?\"Astronomers believe the objects are either the first stars -- humongous stars more than1,000 times the mass of our sun -- or voracious black holes that are consuming gas andspilling out tons of energy. If the objects are stars, then the observed clusters might be the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"first mini-galaxies containing a mass of less than about one million suns. The Milky Waygalaxy holds the equivalent of approximately 100 billion suns and was probably createdwhen mini-galaxies like these merged.\"This study is a thorough follow-up to an initial observation presented in Nature inNovember 2005 by Kashlinksy and his team. The new analysis covered five sky regionsand involved hundreds of hours of observation time.\"Scientists say that space, time and matter originated 13.7 billion years ago in a tremendousexplosion called the Big Bang. Observations of the cosmic microwave background by aco-author of the recent Spitzer studies, Dr. John Mather of Goddard, and his science teamstrongly support this theory. Mather is a co-winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physics forthis work. Another few hundred million years or so would pass before the first stars wouldform, ending the so-called dark age of the Universe. Brief History of the UniverseThis artist's timeline chronicles the history of the universe,from its explosive beginning to its mature, present-day state.Image Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/A. Kashlinsky (GSFC).\"Our universe began in a tremendous explosion known as the Big Bang about 13.7 billionyears ago (left side of strip). Observations by NASA's Cosmic Background Explorer andWilkinson Anisotropy Microwave Probe revealed microwave light from this very earlyepoch, about 400,000 years after the Big Bang, providing strong evidence that our universedid blast into existence. Results from the Cosmic Background Explorer were honored withthe 2006 Nobel Prize for Physics.\"A period of darkness ensued, until about a few hundred million years later, when the firstobjects flooded the universe with light. This first light is believed to have been captured indata from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. The light detected by Spitzer would haveoriginated as visible and ultraviolet light, then stretched, or redshifted, to lower-energyinfrared wavelengths during its long voyage to reach us across expanding space. The lightdetected by the Cosmic Background Explorer and the Wilkinson Anisotropy MicrowaveProbe from our very young universe traveled farther to reach us, and stretched to evenlower-energy microwave wavelengths.\"Astronomers do not know if the very first objects were either stars or quasars. The firststars, called Population III stars (our star is a Population I star), were much bigger andbrighter than any in our nearby universe, with masses about 1,000 times that of our sun.These stars first grouped together into mini-galaxies. By about a few billion years after theBig Bang, the mini-galaxies had merged to form mature galaxies, including spiral galaxieslike our own Milky Way. The first quasars ultimately became the centers of powerfulgalaxies that are more common in the distant universe. NASA's Hubble Space Telescopehas captured stunning pictures of earlier galaxies, as far back as ten billion light-yearsaway.\"With Spitzer, Kashlinsky's group studied the cosmic infrared background, a diffuse light"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"from this early epoch when structure first emerged. Some of the light comes from stars orblack hole activity so distant that, although it originated as ultraviolet and optical light, itswavelengths have been stretched to infrared wavelengths by the growing space-time thatcauses the Universe's expansion. Other parts of the cosmic infrared background are fromdistant starlight absorbed by dust and re-emitted as infrared light.\"'There's ongoing debate about what the first objects were and how galaxies formed,' saidDr. Harvey Moseley of Goddard, a co-author on the papers. 'We are on the right track tofiguring this out. We've now reached the hilltop and are looking down on the village below,trying to make sense of what's going on.'\"The analysis first involved carefully removing the light from all foreground stars andgalaxies in the five regions of the sky, leaving only the most ancient light. The scientiststhen studied fluctuations in the intensity of infrared brightness, in the relatively diffuselight. The fluctuations revealed a clustering of objects that produced the observed lightpattern.\"'Imagine trying to see fireworks at night from across a crowded city,' said Kashlinsky. 'Ifyou could turn off the city lights, you might get a glimpse at the fireworks. We have shutdown the lights of the Universe to see the outlines of its first fireworks.'\"Mather, who is senior project scientist for NASA's future James Webb Space Telescope,said, 'Spitzer has paved the way for the James Webb Space Telescope, which should beable to identify the nature of the clusters.' Stars Spring Up Out of the DarknessThis artist's animation illustrates the universe's early years,from its explosive formation 13.7 billion years ago, to its dark ageswhere gas begins to clump together, to its first starsand mini-galaxies. Illustration by NASA.\"Scientists using NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope found patches of infrared light splatteredacross the sky that might be the collective glow of clumps of the universe's first objects.Astronomers do not know if these first objects were stars or 'quasars,' which are blackholes voraciously consuming surrounding gas.\"The universe's first stars sprang up out of the gas clumps, flooding the universe with light,an event that probably happened about a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.Though these first stars formed out of gas alone, their deaths seeded the universe with thedusty heavy chemical elements that helped create future generations of stars.\"The first stars, called Population III stars (our star is a Population I star), were muchbigger and brighter than any in our nearby universe, with masses about 1,000 times that ofour sun. They grouped together into mini-galaxies, which then merged to form galaxies likeour own mature Milky Way galaxy.\"More Information:For further information about cosmic research, please see the Earthfiles Archives:• 11/27/2006 -- Namibia Telescopes Find First \"Gamma Clock\" in Milky Way Galaxy• 08/19/2006 -- Red Rain Cells of Kerala, India - Still No Definite DNA• 09/16/2005 -- \"Planet X\" and the Kuiper Belt's Oddballs, \"Santa\" and \"Easterbunny\"• 08/12/2005 -- Deep Impact Spectra: Carbonate, PAHs and Some Amino Precursors in Comet Tempel I• 07/10/2005 -- First Data from Deep Impact Crash Into Comet Tempel I• 06/29/2005 -- July 3-4, 2005: NASA \"Deep Impact\" Spacecraft to Blast Hole in Comet Temple I• 05/06/2005 -- What Are The Straight Lines on Saturn's Titan Moon?• 04/20/2005 -- Outer Space Impact At Serpent Mound, Ohio, 256 Million Years Ago"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"• 04/01/2005 -- What's Killing Off Marine Life Every 62 Million Years?• 02/17/2005 -- Iapetus and Enceladus: Baffling Moons of Saturn• 01/13/2005 -- NASA \"Deep Space\" Craft Will Hit Comet On July 4, 2005• 12/17/2004 -- Is Our Solar System's Red, Mysterious Sedna An Alien Planetoid?• 11/17/2004 -- European Space Agency's SMART-1 Satellite Begins Moon Orbit• 09/20/2004 -- Part 1: Martian Water Vapor and Methane Overlap in Equatorial Regions• 06/25/2004 -- Wild 2, An Amazing Comet• 03/31/2004 -- Methane on Mars - Biology?
