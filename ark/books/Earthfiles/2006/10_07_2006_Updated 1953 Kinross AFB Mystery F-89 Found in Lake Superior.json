Where arrow stopsis general area in which the UFO radar blip and F-89 radar blip merged and then disappearedin Canadian territory, 70 miles off the tip of Keweenaw Peninsula (on left)Update October 7, 2006: Since this Earthfiles and my Coast to Coast AM radio interviewwith Adam Jimenez on September 22, 2006, the Great Lakes Dive Company website nolonger functions on the net and neither Adam Jimenez nor Jim Bessette have returnedphone calls or emails as they did prior to September 22. Adam told me that the companyunder which he and Bessette have operated, Great Lakes Dive Company, would bemoving and not be settled until some time in October 2006. Perhaps that explains thecommunication interruption in website, phone and email.However, James Carrion, MUFON Director, has not been able to confirm that a companydoing business as \"Great Lakes Dive Company\" has ever been registered with the State ofMichigan. So far, the Jimenez and Bessette communication with the Canadian government,as Jimenez described, has not been proved or disproved. Security concerns might haveprovoked Jimenez and Bessette to move out of public access until either a salvageoperation or other procedure can establish their claims as legitimate or not.September 22, 2006 Brown City, Michigan - Recently, the Great Lakes Dive Companyin Michigan, in the persons of Adam Jimenez and Jim Bessette, announced a discovery ofan F-89c on the bottom of Lake Superior. Also, Jimenez asserts that 212 feet from the jetis a mysterious object shaped a bit like a teardrop. Could these underwater finds helpanswer what happened fifty-three years ago on November 23, 1953, when Michigan’sKinross AFB launched an F-89 to investigate a rapidly moving UFO? That night,American Air Force radar operators watched the radar blip of the F-89, carrying two men,merge with another radar blip of an unidentified flying object.Back then, the most prominent investigator of government information about UFOs wasMajor Donald Keyhoe, U. S. Marine Corps, and former Director of the NationalInvestigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, also known as NICAP. Major Keyhoewrote five books, beginning in 1950 with The Flying Saucers Are Real – which waspublished only three years after the famous Roswell disc crash headlines that thegovernment tried to turn into a weather balloon.Ten years later in 1960, when Major Keyhoe wrote Flying Saucers: Top Secret, he wasfrustrated by the ever-tightening censorship and outright lies that had become the strictlyenforced policy of what Keyhoe called the “Silence Group.” Two year’s before that book’s"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"release, he had been surprised in 1958 when the USAF at Lackland AFB, Texas, sent him ascript for a closed-circuit radio broadcast at the base. Lackland wanted Major Keyhoe’spermission to use some of his book material. That 1958 U. S. Air Force script began with adetailed description of what happened during the Kinross F-89’s encounter with a UFO onNovember 23, 1953 – in contrast to the Air Force public explanation that a Canadianairliner crashed. [ Opening excerpt of Lackland AFB closed-circuit radio scriptconcerning Kinross incident reprinted with Major Donald Keyhoe's comments in MoreInformation below.]Keyhoe included the never-released script in his 1960 book, from which I am quoting. TheAir Force script began by summarizing official regulations about unsolved UFOinvestigations deliberately kept from the public. Then the Lackland Air Force script stated:“The question now is not ‘IF?,’ but ‘WHY?’ and ‘WHERE DO THEY COME FROM?’ Allsightings mentioned are authenticated as described in this broadcast. It was the evening ofNovember 23, 1953, and wintry darkness had settled over Michigan. At an isolated radarstation, Air Defense operators were watching their scope in a routine guard againstpossible enemy attack.”With full details, that official USAF script then showed how radar operators had picked upthe blip of an unknown object over the Soo Locks near Sault Sainte Marie, Michigan.[ Editor's Note from U. S. Army Corps of Engineers in Detroit, MichiganDistrict: \"The world-famous Soo Locks form a passage for deep-draft shipsaround the rapids in the St. Marys River. Before white men came to the area,the Ojibway Indians who lived nearby portaged their canoes around the'Bawating' (rapids) to reach Lake Superior from the St. Marys River.\"In 1797, the Northwest Fur Company constructed a navigation lock 38 feetlong on the Canadian side of the river for small boats. This lock remained inuse until destroyed in the War of 1812. Freight and boats were again portagedaround the rapids.\"Congress passed an act in 1852 granting 750,000 acres of public land to theState of Michigan as compensation to the company that would build a lockpermitting waterborne commerce between Lake Superior and the other GreatLakes. The Fairbanks Scale Company, which had extensive mining interests,in the upper peninsula, undertook this challenging construction project in1853.\"In spite of adverse conditions, Fairbanks' aggressive accountant, Charles T.Harvey, completed a system of two locks, in tandem, each 350 feet long,within the 2 year deadline set by the State of Michigan. On May 31, 1855, thelocks were turned over to the state and designated as the State Lock.Soo Locks in Sioux Sainte Marie, Michigan, allow sea trafficfrom the huge Lake Superior to Lake Huron and Lake Michigan.Image courtesy U. S. Army Corps of Engineers.\"Boats which passed through the State Lock were required to pay a toll offour cents per ton, until 1877, when the toll was reduced to three cents.Within a few years, commerce through the canal had grown to nationalimportance, and the need for new locks became clear. The funds requiredexceeded the state's capabilities, and thus, in 1881 the locks were transferredto the United States government, and were placed under the jurisdiction of theU.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps has operated the locks, toll free,since that time.\"]Since Soo Locks was a restricted area, an F-89 jet from Kinross Air Force Base south of"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Sault Sainte Marie was immediately sent to investigate with a crew of two.1958 Lackland Air Force Base closed-circuit radio script, never broadcast: “The UFO, flying as fast as a jet airliner, was heading toward Lake Superior.At over 500 mph, the F-89 raced after it, out across Whitefish Bay. Nineminutes ticked by. Slowly the jet closed in. The plane was followed by radaruntil it merged with an object 70 miles off Keweenaw Point in upperMichigan. A stunned radar officer was quoted, 'It seems incredible, but theblip apparently just swallowed our F-89. No trace was ever found of themissing men, the F-89 or the UFO.'” And now, half a century later, recently released Sharc2 sidescan sonar and RemoteOperated Vehicle (ROV) images taken a year ago in August to September 2005, might helpanswer the question: What happened to the Kinross F-89 \"swallowed up\" on radar by aUFO?A couple of weeks ago I interviewed Adam Jimenez, Project Manager for the Great LakesDive Co. Adam received a Bachelor’s of Science Computer Engineering degree in 1990from the Kettering Technical School in Michigan run by General Motors. He is also aMaster Diver who has a Certificate with Rebreather Apparatus. He explained that in theyear 2000, he and his colleagues formed their dive business to look for shipwrecks on thebottom of the deepest of the Great Lakes, which is Lake Superior. The original goal forGreat Lakes Dive Company was not to salvage what they find, but to videotapediscoveries for documentary productions.Originally in 2005, what the company was searching for were two Canadian-Frenchminesweepers that sank off the Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan. Problems arose withtheir sidescan radar, which had to be repaired. When it was ready to work again, it was toolate to resume the minesweeper search, so they took a run at the last known coordinates ofthe Kinross F-89 that was also off Keweenaw Peninsula.Interview:Adam Jimenez, Project Manager, Great Lakes Dive Co., Brown City, Michigan: “Wewent out to the general vicinity of the last known radar contact. We began sweeping thearea with out sonar array, which is an advanced system capable of searching a wide area.For people who don’t know a lot about sonar equipment, most sonar equipment is verynarrow. You will search about a 1500-foot section of lake bed at a time and it takes a longtime to “mow the lawn,” as they say, back and forth sweeping with sonar.Ours is a wide range sonar. It’s capable of looking over a wide area. It took us five or sixdays of sweeping until we got the hit on the F-89, or what appeared to be the F-89. Wedidn’t know until we looked at it a little closer.Sharc2 Sidescan Sonar LowResolution of F-89c ScorpionSharc2 sidescan sonar low resolution (to maximize range) image of F-89cScorpion lying on bottom of Lake Superior in Canadian territory. Wing missing.Black rectangle below plane is not part of scene, but is graphic blackout of GPSand depth data. Sonar image © 2006 by Great Lakes Dive Co."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"United States Air Force F-89c Scorpion.There was a lot of emptiness down there. There weren’t any wrecks in the immediate area,so it’s a lot of plain, flat lake bottom. You get this shape that just sort of appears out ofthat. So the anomaly kind of stands right out to you. Several of us jumped up and said,‘What is that? Back up!’ We went back.Did we say, ‘That’s the F-89!’ No, we didn’t know at that time until we were able tore-scan with the high resolution and take some measurements.SO, THEN YOU THINK IT’S PROBABLY THE F-89 FROM THE 1953 KINROSSINCIDENT. HOW DID YOU THEN FIND THAT OTHER MYSTERIOUS OBJECT?When we went back and got the high res image of the F-89, we immediately dropped theROV in the water to look at the F-89 to hopefully get a serial number off the tail, whichwas exactly what we did. Also to get visual confirmation that it was the F-89 from otherthings like what type of wing pod does it have? What type of canopy have? Anything togive us a clue that this was an F-89 and not perhaps some other airplane.And what made us focus on the object when it began causing problems with ourequipment. There’s a huge story there, not including the huge story about what happenedleading up to 1953. Sonar Distortion Lead to Mystery ObjectWHAT WERE THE PROBLEMS WITH YOUR EQUIPMENT?We did not notice the (unknown) object at first until we began a detailed scan - what wecall a high-resolution scan of the area - basically trying to find the wing and any othermissing part we could find. There was one corner of the search grid that was sending backa distortion. It was only on that corner of the search grid. We could drag the sonar fishover the F-89 and get a good image – for a sonar image anyway – clear as a bell, which iswhat you see on our website (Sharc2 sidescan sonar low resolution image above.) Butwhen we would drag the sonar fish over that particular location of the object, we wouldget a visual distortion in one of the corners of the search grid.When we began looking at the ‘mystery object,’ as we refer to it, we were trying to imagethe area in more detail to try to find parts of the F-89 that were not attached to the plane.Because of that visual distortion, we focused on that. It was kind of strange and we didn’tknow if we were having a reoccurring problem with our sonar array. We would take theunit back to the F-89. It would not distort. We’d take the sonar unit back to the cornerabout 200 feet away, it would distort. Did F-89 Have Nuclear Weapon?So, one of the team members recalled that F-89s were equipped at one point with nuclearweapons. This prompted us to take everything out of the water and return to Michigan andobtain a Geiger counter. We were concerned we might be dealing with a radioactivesource. We did that. We got hold of a handheld Geiger counter, put it inside the ROV tothe bottom and the results were negative. There was no radiation coming from the object.ANY SPECULATION BY ALL OF YOU ABOUT THE INTERFERENCE? WHAT’SCAUSING THE INTERFERENCE?We thought radiation at first because it was almost a mimic of – if you’ve ever had acellular phone turned on next to a computer monitor and get a phone call, you’ll see a"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"distortion in the monitor. And that’s kind of what we were looking at in the images wewere getting – that sort of visual distortion. So we thought we might be dealing with someform of radiation. But we eliminated radiation.We still don’t know. We haven’t been back since with the shark system – the big sonararray. We simply captured the images we captured on the cannibalized sonar system to getwhat we got. But it would be an interesting test to go back next season and use the sharkarray and find out exactly what is causing that distortion. Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV)Videotape Image of Mystery ObjectIN THE SIDESCAN IMAGING, WHAT CAN YOU DESCRIBE IN MORE DETAILABOUT THE TEARDROP-SHAPED OBJECT?It’s 212 feet away, actually. You really can’t tell by the sidescans. The ROV footage ismuch more telling. What can I tell you about it? We don’t know what it is. We’re notUFOlogists. We are divers and scientists. The ROV footage shows that it is clearly metallic.It doesn’t show up on a regular magnetometer scan, which does not necessarily meananything except it’s not made out of iron.Unidentified teardrop-shaped object 212 feet from F-89with triangle-shaped slide mark to the lower right. Image by remoteoperated vehicle (ROV). Images © 2005 by Great Lakes Dive Co.It definitely has the reflective qualities of metal. That’s why we call it metallic. There hasbeen some speculation on the internet that it’s dented in the front. In fact, it is not dentedin the front. That appears to be a distortion on the sidescan imagery. So, it’s very smoothand metallic in shape and fairly large.COULD YOU PLEASE GIVE SOME OF THE MEASUREMENTS YOU KNOW – THEDISTANCE BETWEEN THE PLANE AND THE TEARDROP-SHAPED OBJECT ANDTHE ESTIMATED SIZE OF THE TEARDROP-SHAPED OBJECT?The distance between the two objects is approximately 212 feet. I believe the size of theteardrop is roughly, I think it is 8 feet by 15 feet. But that’s just the exposed portion. Wedon’t know what else lies beneath the sand.SO RIGHT NOW YOU’RE SAYING, FROM YOUR BEST EDUCATION, THAT THETEARDROP ITSELF IS NOT MORE THAN FIFTEEN FEET IN DIAMETER?It’s not diameter, because it’s oblong kind of shape. So, from what we can tell that’sexposed, it’s about a fifteen by eight feet section.BUT NOT LONGER THAN FIFTEEN FEET?Exposed, right. Now, who knows what else is underneath? What you’re seeing in thesidescan from the tail to the tip is about fifteen feet. From the absolute widest point of theteardrop across is, I believe, 8 to 10 feet, somewhere in there.ARE THERE ANY INSTRUMENTS YOU CAN USE THAT CAN SAY WHAT THIS ISMADE OUT OF?No. It does not show up on a magnetometer and that’s pretty much what you can usewithout actually getting into recovering the object.BUT IF IT DOES NOT HAVE IRON, IT IS NOT GOING TO HAVE A SIGNATURE IN A"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MAGNETOMETER?Right. Magnetometers are essentially huge magnets. Anyone who has had a magnet knowsthat sometimes they attract metal and sometimes they don’t. This one (unknown circularobject) does not give a reading on the magnetometer. Mystery Object That's Visible Under SandIs Only 15 Feet LongIN THE ORIGINAL STORY THAT WAS RELEASED FROM THE AIR FORCE ANDMEDIA AT THE TIME (IN 1953), THE AIR FORCE SAID THAT THERE WAS ANOBJECT IDENTIFIED AS A UFO TRAVELING OVER 500 MPH, THAT THE F-89 WASRACING TOWARD OUT ACROSS WHITE FISH BAY. AND THAT THEY WATCHEDON RADAR APPARENTLY AS THE BLIPS BETWEEN THE F-89 AND THE UFOTHAT WAS TRAVELING RAPIDLY CAME TOGETHER AND JOINED INTO ONEBLIP. ONE OF THE QUOTES FROM THAT PERIOD OF TIME WAS FROM THE AIRFORCE: ‘The blip apparently just swallowed the F-89. No trace was ever found of themissing men, F-89 or the UFO.’ THAT’S A QUOTE FROM A REPORT.Correct.SO YOU WOULD THINK THAT WHATEVER THIS OBJECT WAS, THE BLIP THATSEEMED TO SWALLOW THE F-89, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE BIGGER THAN ANF-89?Yeah. The airplane disappeared at 7,000 feet also. The aircraft we found does not appearto have hit the lake from a fall of 7,000 feet. The wreckage we found would certainly notsuggest that the plane fell from an altitude of 7,000 feet.SO THERE REALLY IS A SUBSTANTIAL MYSTERY ABOUT WHAT THETEARDROP-SHAPED OBJECT IS DOWN THERE A FEW HUNDRED FEET FROMTHE F-89?Absolutely. A tremendous mystery! What IS the Mystery Object?The Great Lakes Dive Co. would simply have sent the GPS coordinates of the aircraft tothe U. S. Air Force so they could retrieve their airmen, if it had not been for the object.Certainly, that’s what we would do with the minesweepers once they are located. Wewould supply the coordinates to the appropriate agencies who might want to recover theirofficers. But the object changed everything, so it kind of puts us in a holding pattern witheverything.MEANING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A CLOSER IDENTIFICATIONPERHAPS OF WHAT THE OBJECT IS?Correct.YOU WOULD DO THAT IN 2007 IN WHAT WAY?We would take the ROV back down. Again, we looked at most of the site. We’d like tolook a little bit further. We were hampered by worsening weather in the middle of the lake.So we weren’t really able to finish what we would like to finish. And there’s been somesuggestion by the team to utilize what they call a high-pressure wash system on the ROV,which basically generates a stream of water capable of dusting the silt off things. Possiblytaking a run at the unknown object with that system. We don’t know. We’re still workingout the logistics.IF YOU COULD THEN SPRAY OFF SOME OF THE COATING OF THE MUD ANDSILT, YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SEE MORE CLEARLY WHAT THAT OBJECT IS.Correct.YOU WOULD DO THIS VIDEOTAPING AS YOU WENT?Absolutely. Well, as much as we could. Whenever you use a high-pressure wash system, ittends to stir up silt quite a bit. So, there might be waiting and seeing afterward."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Any Military Interest in the Lake Superior Discoveries?HAVE YOU HAD ANY CONTACT FROM ANY MILITARY AGENCY TO DATEABOUT THIS?No. No military agencies. The only contacts we’ve had are routine contacts with theCanadian government regarding permits to the site, which is not sinister in the slightest. It’sroutine. The Canadian government believes anything on the lake bottom is their property –especially something that has not been reported as being discovered. They like to knowwhat the location is before they issue a permit to return.We have other projects in the works, which forces us to keep a delicate peace with theMinister of Culture in Canada so that nothing else gets disrupted.SO CURRENTLY WHERE THE F-89 AND THE ROUND OBJECT LAY IS INCANADIAN TERRITORY?That’s correct.IF THIS ROUND OBJECT TURNS OUT TO FALL INTO THE CATEGORY OF ASILVER DISC AS WAS PHOTOGRAPHED SO MANY TIMES IN THE 1940S, 1950S,THE 1960S – WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD BE THE NEXT STEP AS FAR AS YOUBEING ABLE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT RETRIEVING IT? OR WORKING WITHTHE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT? AND WHAT PERHAPS WOULD THE U. S.GOVERNMENT SAY?I think the U. S. government – unless they can show that the object is their property –would have much of a say about the (unknown) object itself. Of course, the F-89 remainsthe U. S. Air Force property, which is fully understandable. But the Canadian governmentis very restrictive. They consider everything on the lake bottom, be it a shipwreck, plane orsomething else unknown, their property automatically. So, any kind of recovery effortthat’s done legally would have to be done through the Canadian government, unless theU.S. government could prove the (unknown) object is their property, which I have no idea.They might say it’s a piece of their military hardware. Maybe they know something wedon’t.THE SIZE IS PUZZLING, BUT IF IT IS CURRENTLY THAT THE PART WE ARESEEING IS ONLY AN UPPER PORTION OF SOMETEHING THAT MIGHT BEBIGGER UNDERNEATH, THAT COULD BE A WHOLE OTHER STORY?Certainly. The speculation can run the spectrum from one end to the other of what it is andhow big it is. One of our team suggested perhaps it is upside down. Perhaps we are seeingthe bottom of whatever that is. It’s possible it’s a piece of something. The rest of it couldbe somewhere else. We just don’t know. It’s wide open for rampant speculation at thispoint without further analysis. Mid-Air Collision? Or Advanced Technology That \"Placed\"F-89 On Bottom of Lake Superior?ABOUT THE ISSUE OF THE F-89 NOT LOOKING LIKE IT HAD FALLEN FROM7,000 FEET, IT REMINDS ME OF THE FAMOUS MANTELL CASE OVERKENTUCKY IN WHICH THEY FOUND THAT PLANE BROKEN UP WITHTHOUSANDS OF LITTLE HOLES IN IT. AGAIN, I BELIEVE ONE OF THESTATEMNTS WAS THAT IT DIDN’T LOOK LIKE IT CRASHED. IT LOOKED LIKE ITHAD BEEN PLACED AND CRACKED APART. THIS RAISES THE QUESETIONABOUT THE INTERACTION WITH THE UFO ACTIVITY – THERE AREALLEGEDLY BEAMS OR ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS THAT MIGHT PLACE APLANE DOWN IN THE BOTTOM OF WATER WITHOUT THE PLANE ACTUALLYFALLING.Anything is possible at this point, Linda. If I had to guess, I’d say the plane experienced alow level collision with the object that’s near it. Maybe the altitude was being reported bythe pilot and maybe unbeknownst to him, he was a lot closer to the lake than he thought.The forensics of the aircraft suggest that it was a low level speed collision with something.There does appear to be what we refer to as a ‘strike mark’ on the (unknown) object thatdoes match the hole where the wing used to be on the F-89. There’s an oblong kind ofunique shape where the wing used to be. There’s a – I don’t know if you would call it ascratch per se. It’s definitely not a dent. But there is a matching formation on the objectthat matches the hole where the wing was (on the F-89). So, if I had to guess, my best"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"guess would be that a low level collision took place and both objects went to the bottom(of Lake Superior).WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT SCRATCH, YOU MEAN THAT THERE IS ASCRATCH ON THE ROUND, OR TEARDROP-SHAPED OBJECT?Right. I call it a strike mark. I don’t know if you could call it a scratch. It does not appearto be an indentation of any kind in the metal. It’s just an oblong mark, if you will, that doesmatch the oddball oblong mark on the F-89.If you can imagine a wing being ripped off from an airplane, it’s going to leave a verydistinguished hole. It’s not going to be a simple laser cut, precision line. It’s going to leavea strange shape because of twisted metal. Well, this shape does appear to match with themark on the object.YOU WOULD SPECULATE THEN WHAT HAPPENED?From those two things, the strike mark (on unknown object) and the hole in the F-89, Iwould speculate that the F-89 did collide with this object in some manner.AND BOTH WENT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF LAKE SUPERIOR?That would be our guess, yes. Now, that’s assuming this (unknown round object) isn’t justa piece of something, but it would appear that both things went to the bottom in theirentirety. There doesn’t appear to be a broken off piece of something. But again, we don’tknow. We don’t know how much is below the surface.THAT WING FROM THE F-89 MIGHT STILL BE THERE UNDER THE BOTTOMMUD, OR IT MIGHT BE UNDER THAT OBJECT?It’s a possibility. There are several theories about what might have happened to the wingand that is certainly one of them – that it could be under the object itself. Or nearby andjust buried under mud we can’t see. We’re not sure.IF IT REALLY IS A SILVER DISC IN THE UFO CATEGORY, WHAT DO YOU THINKHAPPENS NEXT?(laughs) That’s a good question! I’m not sure.”More Information:Excerpt from 1958 Lackland Air Force Base Closed-Circuit Radio Script, NeverBroadcast:"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The entire script is reprinted in Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness© 1998 by Linda Moulton Howe.
