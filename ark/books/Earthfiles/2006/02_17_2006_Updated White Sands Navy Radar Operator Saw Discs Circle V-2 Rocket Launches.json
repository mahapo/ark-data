S. Navy DC1 Lloyd Eugene CampFebruary 17, 2006 Algood, Tennessee - For the past year, I have been reporting aboutthe revelations of former New Mexico State Representative, Andrew Kissner, from LasCruces in Dona Ana County. Las Cruces is not far from White Sands Missile Range.Andy's work in local construction projects brought him in contact with White Sandsemployees who told him about flying discs that interfered with rocket launches from 1947onward.Back in the Truman Administration, it was called White Sands Proving Ground. That'swhere German physicists were brought after World War II in Project PAPERCLIP to workon American research and development of captured German V-2 and Wasserfall rockets.In May 1947, at least two German rockets launched from White Sands went off courseand crashed. In both instances, round, aerial discs were seen visually and on radar near therockets just before the rapidly moving missiles veered from their trajectories. One on May29, 1947, turned 180 degrees in mid-air and crashed near the new airport in Juarez,Mexico. The result was a huge crater in the ground, but nothing was left of the largerocket. Andrew Kissner's sources told him the truth was that the launched rocket hadevaporated. The implication was that the disc technology was responsible. The BaseCommander explained to the media that \"peculiar phenomena\" had interfered with therocket tests. The \"peculiar phenomena\" were the unidentified aerial discs.Front Page, Las Cruces Citizen, Las Cruces, New Mexico, May 22, 1947.El Paso Times, El Paso, Texas, May 30, 1947.July 4 - 6, 1947: Disc Crashes and RetrievalsNear Roswell and White Sands Proving GroundFive weeks later, between July 4 to 6, 1947, three aerial craft described in leakedgovernment documents as \"not from this world,\" crashed in three New Mexico sites: onewas on the Mac Brazel ranch between Corona and Roswell; a second was found at the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Trinity Site at the northern end of White Sands Proving Ground where we tested the firstatomic bomb in July 1945; and a third was discovered on the Mescalero Apache IndianReservation 30 miles east of Alamogordo and Holloman AFB. Craft and non-humanbodies both dead and alive were retrieved from the crash sites.Afterward, Andrew Kissner was told that American President Harry S. Truman authorizeda 1947 classified Executive Order and extended the War Powers Act to enforce a strictcover-up of all matters related to an extraterrestrial presence on this planet. ThatPresidential Executive Order appears to still be in effect today nearly 60 years later. Oneof Andy Kissner's most important sources was a high ranking officer at White SandsProving Ground who died in 1998.He gave Andy some reasons why the U. S. government has lied and misinformed about theextraterrestrial presence for more than half a century:government insiders watched on radar and saw in photographs the \"peculiarphenomena\" - advanced aerial devices that could easily keep pace with our rapidlymoving V-2 rocket tests;government insiders were shocked that the disc technology had an advanced beamtechnology which can lift up and lower animals and people;government insiders concluded at least one non-human agenda is to harvest geneticmaterial from animals and people transported by the beam technology;and government insiders learned that the non-human intelligence has, and will,retaliate if attacked.In the past several months - as I have reported about the disc crashes and retrievals andthe American government's strict policy of denial in the interest of national security I havereceived many letters and e-mails from people who had parents or relatives serving in theU. S. military during the Truman and Eisenhower administrations. One of those morerecent contacts is from Sherry Camp Malin. She was born on February 6, 1959, inCoalmont, Tennessee. Her father, Lloyd Eugene Camp, spent his 35-year career in the U.S. Navy and yet his daughter, Sherry Camp Malin, thought he told her in the hospitalbefore he died in 1993 that he retired as a Sergeant Major, which would be a U. S. Armyrank. [ See Andrew Kissner comments in Update below.] In 1947, Lloyd Camp was29-years-old and had moved his family to the White Sands Proving Ground area of NewMexico where he worked in radar and V-2 rocket research.1918 - 1993In late 1940s to 1950s, Lloyd Eugene Camp was a DC1 in U. S. Navy at White SandsProving Ground working in radar and V-2 rocket launches. Photograph provided by his daughter, Sherry CampMalin.Sherry contacted me because she heard about my reports that aerial discs interfered withV-2 rocket launches and she wanted me to know that her father told the family he hadwatched strange disc-shaped aerial objects circle around rockets after launches fromWhite Sands.Recently I talked with Sherry Malin about her father, Lloyd Eugene Camp, who died in"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"1993 at age 75.Update:OPNAV U.

Lloyd Eugene Camp told his family that he retired after 35 yearsof military service as a Sergeant Major, which is an Army rank. But the family only knewhe worked for the Navy.Andrew Kissner: \"The White Sands Proving Ground (WSPG) from the1940s on has always operated as a U. S. Army installation. In that context, theArmy is the 'landlord' for a wide variety of U. S. Navy, Air Force and otheragency 'tenant' facilities. The Army provides White Sands Missile Rangetoday with infrastructure such as roads, utilities and overall base security forthe various operating tenant agencies and facilities. The Naval ResearchLaboratory (NRL) was an integral component to WSPG operations in 1947,but the Navy did not own the real estate. The land was the U. S. Army'sresponsibility.\"It is certainly possible that Army and Navy radar operators would beoperating radar jointly, especially during Navy V-2 rocket tests. Lloyd EugeneCamp's SECRET Security Clearance document above certainly indicates Mr.Camp started as Navy personnel, indicated by the DC1 rank. His retirement asa Sergeant Major indicates U. S. Army service as well, but it is not clear whyhis service career would have changed from Navy to Army.\"[ Editor's Note: Sherry Malin has been searching for her father's DD-214discharge papers for some time which should help clarify the Navy to Armyevolution, if that was the situation. Earthfiles will update this report if thedischarge document is found. ]Interview:Sherry Camp Malin, Homemaker, Algood, Tennessee: \"My Dad was in the Navy. Hetold me that he helped carry out top level research on the German V-2 rockets. Dad, hesaid he ran the radar equipment and he also set up the equipment and stuff for thelaunches. And he helped (Werner) Von Braun set up equipment. Dad would run the radarequipment, too.

Hesaid that they would circle the rockets and follow them. And then like several times, theradar equipment would lock in on the missiles and the rockets would crash.Upside down \"pie pan\" aerial disc, Winkelriot, Switzerland.Photograph © 1976 by Billy Meier.In one instance, one of the rockets crashed into a cemetery in Juarez, Mexico. (May 29,1947 See: Earthfiles reports listed below in More Information.CAN YOU REMEMBER ANY SPECIFIC DETAILS HE MIGHT HAVE TOLD YOUABOUT THE DISCS WITH WERNER VON BRAUN OR FROM A SCIENTIST POINTOF VIEW, WHAT WERE THEY DEALING WITH?He didn't say what Von Braun said they were. It was obvious to them that they didn't comefrom this world. They were from somewhere else. There wasn't anything on this planet thatwas that technologically advanced enough to do what those things did.Whenever they took off, they would circle the rockets and then the UFOs would zoom offout into space, maybe a thousand miles a minute or whatever! We just don't have anythingcapable of doing anything like that.WHEN YOUR FATHER TALKED TO YOU ABOUT THESE DISCS BEING INVOLVEDAT THE TIME OF THE V-2 ROCKET RESEARCH AND BEING ABLE TO CIRCLEAROUND THE ROCKETS AFTER THEY WERE LAUNCHED, DID HE SAYANYTHING TO YOU LIKE, 'YOU MUST NOT TELL ANYONE'?Yes. He told me and my brother that we should not be telling everybody about it. We didn'treally discuss it.DID HE EXPLAIN WHY IT HAD TO BE KEPT A SECRET?He always said it was like for national security reasons that we really shouldn't say"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"anything. About a couple of months before he died when he was in the hospital, I decidedmaybe that I should talk to him about this and get all the information written down that Icould find. He told me extensively about all the things he pretty well knew. I interviewedhim, just so that I would have a record of this because I wanted to have his stories for mydaughter whenever she becomes an adult. She might want to pass these stories down to herchildren.WAS HE THERE WHEN THE THREE CRAFT CRASHED NEAR CORONA, THETRINITY SITE AT WHITE SANDS AND THE MESCALERO INDIAN RESERVATION JULY 4 TO 6, 1947 WHEN THE THREE 'INTERPLANETARY\" VEHICLESCRASHED?My dad, yes, he was out there. I don't know how much he knew about that. But he told mespecifically that the Roswell crash was real. Sherry Camp Malin's Notes At Her Father's Death Bed in1993CAN YOU READ DIRECTLY FROM THE NOTES YOU TOOK WHEN HE WAS INTHE HOSPITAL DYING?Yes, certainly.'One time while one of the rockets was being launched, two unidentified flyingobjects appeared along side the rocket. My father saw them both on radar andvisually from where he was. He saw what appeared to be two silvery discscircling the rocket. He observed them for several minutes before theysuddenly turned on their sides and zoomed off over the Jarilla Mountain range(near Orogrande, New Mexico).'Meanwhile, the radar equipment went haywire and locked in on the flyingsaucers as they quickly vanished from the radar screen, causing the men tolose track of the rocket. Then as a direct result of the interference of theseflying saucers, the rocket crashed into a cemetery in Juarez, Mexico. My dadeven told me that they tried shooting missiles at the flying saucers on separateoccasions. He had seen these flying saucers several times circling rocketswhen they were launched at White Sands.'The mysterious, silvery discs became a common nuisance at White SandsProving Ground. My dad, as well as countless other military personnel,including pilots and radar controllers reported these events to officials incommand of the White Sands Project. Eventually the word was sent out toshut the men up at all costs for the sake of national security.'My father's name and rank at the time of these UFO sightings was SergeantMajor Lloyd Eugene Camp. [ Editor's Note: Despite Sherry's memory andnotes from her father's deathbed, the SECRET clearance document aboveshows rank in 1953 as DC1 in U. S. Navy.] He started working at White SandsProving Ground around 1947 and he was 29-years-old at the time hewitnessed these events.'My mom, dad and brother also saw one of these flying saucers while theywere traveling through the White Sands desert one evening during the summerof 1947. I have the full details of the accounts of all three of them about theirshared sighting of what they described to me as, 'like a huge, silvery pie panturned upside down in the sky, hovering above the road ahead of them.' Theywitnessed this object just flip over on its side and quickly disappear into thesky.' Disc Agendas?DID HE TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT HE SPECULATED THE SOURCE OF THEDISCS W ERE? OR W HAT THE DISCUSSION WAS W ITH FE LLOW SCIENTISTSAND GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES ABOUT THE SOURCE OF THE DISCS? ANDWHY WERE THEY HERE? WHY WERE THEY INTERFERING WITH THE V-2ROCKETS?My dad told me that they all knew they were not from this world, that they were from thestars. My dad, he said that he thought because at the time we were beginning to develop"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"nuclear weapons and missiles and things of this sort that would be the destruction of ourworld if we let these things loose. If someone used these weapons. So, naturally, I guessthat was a turning point maybe in our history, or something, that there was suddenlythousands of UFO sightings started happening around that time period. Government Cover-Up of \"Earth's Secret War\"DID YOUR FATHER EVER SAY TO YOU THAT THERE WAS SOME KIND OFEARTH'S SECRET WAR?Yes. My dad said they even declared war on these UFOs, on these ships, and they shotmissiles at these things on several occasions. But it didn't do any good, of course. Themissiles just wound up crashing and the guns or whatever they tried to use. The pilotswould even come in talking about these things, having chased them and stuff.WAS YOUR FATHER AWARE OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS FROM THE PRESIDENT OFTHE UNITED STATES, FOR EXAMPLE?My dad, he said that some part of the government, they sent word back to thecommanding officers and people in charge of White Sands Project to shut the men up fornational security reasons and that they were not to talk about it anymore.IT DOESN'T SEEM CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE THINK OF THE UNITED STATESOF AMERICA BEING A DEMOCRACY FOR A FEW PEOPLE TO HAVE ALL THESECRETS ABOUT SOMETHING AS GREAT AS EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICALENTITIES FROM SOME PLACE ELSE BEING HERE AND BEING FIRED UPONAND PERHAPS FIRING BACK OR RETALIATING AND OUR GOVERNMENTDECLARING WAR, BUT NOT LETTING ANYBODY KNOW?Like I say, my dad I think it did upset him. He didn't think that they should be doing that.My dad didn't think he said it could probably start a panic if this stuff got out probably.Maybe that was one of the reasons they didn't want this information out there.WHAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS YOU REMEMBER HIM TELLING YOU THAT WASTHE STRANGEST OR THE MOST INCREDIBLE THING HE SAW THESE DISCS DO?I guess their speed. They could turn sideways or anything really fast. They would be gonein just an instant. It would be hard to see them. They was gone in just a second. We havenothing in this world at that time especially that could even come close to being that fast.IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOUR FATHER TOLD YOU THAT OURGOVERNMENT KNEW ABOUT THE INTELLIGENCE INSIDE THE DISCS?He said that they were more highly advanced than we ever dreamed of them being. Ofcourse, dad was pretty secretive about a lot of that stuff. I don't think he really told meeverything that he knew.DID HE EVER LEAVE YOU WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS AFRAID OFWHATEVER THE INTELLIGENCE WAS?No. He wasn't afraid of them.THEN WHY WOULD THE GOVERNMENT GIVE OUT THE EXCUSE TO HIM ANDOTHERS IN AUTHORITY THAT IF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND WORLD WERETOLD THE TRUTH THAT PEOPLE WOULD PANIC?Yeah. Well, that does not make sense to me either.\"The upside down pie pan aerial craft has long been associated with the blond humanoidsreferred to as \"Nordics\" or \"Swedes\" - not the grey-skinned, large black-eyed, EBENs(extraterrestrial biological entities) generally connected with egg-shaped craft, spheres orthin discs.
