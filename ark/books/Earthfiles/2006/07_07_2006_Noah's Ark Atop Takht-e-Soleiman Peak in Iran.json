The B.A.S.E. Noah's ark expedition trekked to a 15,000-foot peakthere in July 2005 and June 2006 and found the unusual dark rock outcrop below.Dark rock in upper right extends about 400 feet through to the otherside of the Soleiman peak.

July 7, 2006 Monument, Colorado - Long before the time of Jesus Christ, the Bible says God was angry atsinful humanity and planned to flood the planet above all the mountain tops to get rid of everyone. But Godtook pity on a man named Noah and his family and decided to save them and many animals. The salvation,according to the Bible, was a boat made of “gopher wood.” As the flood waters receded, Noah’s ark came torest on “Ararat mountains,” plural. In Jeremiah Chapter 51, verse 27, Ararat is called a kingdom that fightswith Babylon – not a volcanic mountain in Turkey. In fact, Mt. Ararat, Turkey, was not given that name untilaround 1200 A.D. That means historically, there was an ancient Ararat kingdom with many mountains in whatmost likely would have been Mesopotamia, or today’s Iran and Iraq.Further, the King’s James version of the Bible in Chapter 11, Verse 2, states that Noah’s descendants,“...journied from the east (and) found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.” Three chapters laterin Genesis Chapter 14, (Genesis 14:1,9) Shinar is the land ruled by king Amraphel, who reigned in Babylon.Babylon means “gate of god” and was on the plain of Shinar along the Euphrates River, about 50 miles southof modern day Baghdad, Iraq.One Noah’s ark researcher named Robert Cornuke had explored Mt. Ararat in Turkey with astronaut JamesIrwin some years ago. Mr. Cornuke was FBI-trained and worked as a police investigator and SWAT teammember in Orange County, California. He read a lot of history and came to the conclusion that Noah’s ark musthave stopped on one of the Ararat mountains east of Babylon in Iran. He and others interested in finding the arkand other biblical artifacts, formed the Bible Archaeology Search and Exploration Institute, known asB.A.S.E.In July 2005 and June 2006, Mr. Cornuke and his team applied to the Iranian government for tourist visas,which were granted. Without publicity, the B.A.S.E. team quietly searched the top of a 15,000-foot-high peakof the Soleiman massif in the Elborz mountain range of northern Iran. There they found a large, dark-coloredrock outcrop about 400 feet long that looks quite different than the surrounding mountain rock. On closeinspection, the dark rock has a lot of slabs in it that could be interpreted as fossilized wood planks or beams ofa boat. What convinced Bob Cornuke to search the Iranian mountain?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Boa rd- like s la bs f os s ilize d on the Sole ima n pe a k? O r s imply la ye r e d r oc k outc rop? Ima ge © 2006 by B.A.S.E.Interview:Robert Cornuke, Director, Bible Archaeology Search and Exploration Institute (B.A.S.E.), and formerOrange County, California, SWAT te am police office r, Monume nt, Colorado: “We were told early on bya man named Ed Davis who in 1943 was an Army Sergeant building roads through Iran – he was taken up tothis mountain and shown this object that he was told was Noah’s ark. So that was our primary – going to thisone particular mountain is what we were doing, following the Ed Davis story, the Army Sergeant from WorldWar II.GIVEN THE ROCKY RELATIOINSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND IRAN, HOW DID YOUGET PERMISSION TO EXPLORE THERE?I contacted a travel agency in Iran. They told me to fill out the appropriate paperwork, to file the appropriatepaperwork. There were state-appointed guides that would be with us 24/7. We were allowed to go into thecountry as tourists to go look into the mountains of Iran. It was not that difficult.But the relationship between the United States and Iran is well known and it’s very tumultuous right now, sowe were very careful to be low key, go to the mountain, climb the mountain, photograph what we needed tophotograph and then get out of there.It was not that impressive when we first walked up to it. We said this is just a big black rock outcropping,different from anything else for miles and miles – a very distinctive rock outcropping. When we got up close toit, we saw the rock resembled beams. Stone that looked like wood beams, a big jumbled pile of beams thatmaybe had been on a wooden ship at one time, or some wooden structure. It was very exciting to see thisobject up there that was very different from all the other rocks in the whole region."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Close-up on slabs of rock that might be fossilized wood beams? Image © 2006 by B.A.S.E.COULD YOU GIVE SOME SIZES? THE BIBLE TALKED IN CUBITS. NO ONE TODAY REALLYUNDERSTANDS WHAT A CUBIT IS.Right. The Bible describes the ark as 300 cubits by 50 cubits by 30 cubits. Now, a cubit is a fluctuatingdistance. It was the tip of the finger to the elbow of the ruler at the time. That’s where the problem comes in.We don’t know how big the ruler was at the time. But a loose interpretation is about 450 feet long, 75 feetwide and 45 feet high – an enormous ship.We found this rock object to be about 400 feet long in the side of a hill. It goes in one side and out side theother. So, this object just fits the general description of the Bible.IS THERE SOME SCIENTIFIC METHOD THAT CAN NOW BE APPLIED TO THIS ROCK THATCOULD CONFIRM IF IT WAS WOOD ORIGINALLY AND WHEN IT MIGHT HAVE BEENCONSTRUCTED AS WOOD?Yes and no. We don’t even know what ‘gopher wood’ is. So not knowing what gopher wood was at the timethe ark was constructed, we just don’t have a method to determine what gopher wood is. At the best, we canlook at some of these rocks and slice them open in thin sections and see if we can see any cell structure. Whenwe cut the rocks open, we found a unique sea organism that was in the rock. That can only be found in a deepocean environment.We also found sea life around this object, which indicated to us that at one time it was under the ocean. Wefound thousands of clams, some of them in a one-inch mantle of clams in the area at about 14,000 feet. Thisobject (dark rock) had some cell structure in it, but maybe the whole object is stone and maybe only a fewsamples down below have some cell structure, which would be residue from petrified wood – maybe fromtrees that were up there. We are still going through the process of trying to determine what are we looking at inthis object? We’ve only been a few weeks. We’re really in the embryonic stages of the research.We have had initial reports from lab technicians and a geologist on a thin section (of the rock); he had detectedsome cell structure in the rock.WHEN YOU SAY CELL STRUCTURE, YOU MEAN SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE LIKE FROM ATREE OR PLANT THAT WOULD BE FOSSILIZED?It looks like some of the samples we brought back have some cell structure in them. Most of the objects upthere just look like rock, common every day rock. But we took the most tantalizing pieces that might have somecell structure and we’re really pleased that we’ve found a little, or been told we have a little.\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Slab of dark stone. Image © 2006 by B. A. S. E.Robert Cornuke’s next goal is to pay for clear, close-up satellite imagery of the dark rock outcropping on theTakht-e-Soleiman massif, in the Elborz mountain range. The fact that the unusual long slabs of rock stick outboth sides of the mountain top does not prove it’s a fossilized boat. But at least Mr. Cornuke thinks he isfinally looking on the right mountain range east of Baghdad in northern Iran.More Information:[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia: \"Alborz, also written as Alburz or Elburz, is a mountain range innorthern Iran, stretching from the borders of Armenia in the northwest to the southern end of theCaspian Sea, where also Tehran and Iran's highest peak, Damavand (5604 meters), and endingin the east at the borders of Turkmenistan and Afghanistan. The Alborz mountain range forms abarrier between the south Caspian and the Qazvin-Tehran plateau. It is only 60-130 km wideand consists of sedimentary series dating from Upper Devonian to Oligocene, prevalentlyjurassic limestone over a granite core. Alborz enjoys a central role in the historical texts ofIran such as the Shahnama, and also in Persian mythology.\"At the northwest part of the middle Alborz, some jagged, rugged and not parallel ridge linesform a sub-range that contains about 160 distinct peaks higher than 4000 meters, called Takht-e-Soleiman massif. The conclusion of the ridges at the middle of the sub range forms the landssecond highest peak and one of the most technical climbing's named Alamkooh (4850 meters).The Takht-e-Soleiman massif holds Iran's largest glacial region and unlike most othermountains of Iran, winter lasts until July at higher parts of this area.\"For further information about the search for Noah's ark, please see reports below in the EarthfilesArchives.• 03/26/2006 -- \"Anomaly\" On Mt.
