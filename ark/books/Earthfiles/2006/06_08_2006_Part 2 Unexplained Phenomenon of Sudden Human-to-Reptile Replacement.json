For example, Jim heard aboutsuch an incident from the daughter of a prominent Texas politician several years ago who saw her fatherchange briefly and then returned to his normal human self. Both Jim and I have interviewed another Texasresident who saw her best friend sitting on a couch, suddenly replaced by a sitting “alligator” for a fewseconds before the friend returned to her normal-looking human self. The Texas eyewitness in this report willbe called Sara.Interview:Sara, house wife, married twice, four children, 61-years-old at time of this interview in March 1999, andnow 68-years-old, Northeastern Texas: “I came into the subject with Jim Marrs when I simply related afact about reptilians. I said, ‘Well, I’m sure a lot of people don’t agree or understand, but I have had areptilian incident in my life – in fact two of them. Jim asked to hear them.JIM CALLED ME AND ASKED IF I WOULD TALK WITH YOU AS WELL. THANK YOU FORSHARING. I AM VERY INTERESTED IN THE REPTILIAN SPECIES, BOTH IN OUR ANCIENT ANDMODERN HISTORIES, AND I WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT IF YOU COULD TELL MEABOUT YOUR TWO ENCOUNTERS.The first encounter I had, Linda, was many, many years ago. I had four children and they were all down withthe measles at one time.WHAT YEAR DO YOU THINK THAT WAS?I believe my oldest child was either in the third or fourth grade.THAT WOULD BE WHAT YEAR?Mary was born in 1966 and she was in the third or fourth grade.SO THAT WOULD PLACE HER AROUND 9-YEARS-OLD?Something like that.SO, 1966 PLUS NINE YEARS WOULD BE AROUND 1975?Yes.WHERE WERE YOU THEN?Ft. Worth, Texas. I was home. The kids were all sick, but Mary loved school. She wanted a poster – they weretrying for a poster to win a $25 savings bond. She said, ‘Mother, make me a poster,’ hoping she would win,which she did not, I might add.Anyway, I told her I would go to the library and see if we could work up a poster that would be the winningone. I went to the library and got an idea for a poster. While I was sitting there reading – I’m quite an avidreader – I was sitting at a regular rectangle-long table. I had been sitting there and reading for at least an hour,maybe longer."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Then I heard this gasp from the room and looked up. In walked, one of the most striking, beautiful, woman thatI had ever seen in my life. She was absolutely striking in that she was very tall. I’d say she was close to 6 feettall. She had on heels. She had masses of red hair piled on top in a swept up hairdo that made her look eventaller. She was absolutely regal looking, absolutely regal! As I was telling Jim, I’m sure her suit cost morethan my car. I knew very little about clothes and fashion as far as that type clothing, but you could know just bysimply looking that she was impeccably tailored in every way, that everything about her was money, well puttogether. Perfect skin. She looked like a movie star to me.She come and sat down on the other end of the rectangular table and I was watching her along with all theother mostly women. A few men were there, too. I noticed that she kept gazing at me. She did not stare in ahard looking way, but when I looked up, she was simply and calmly looking at me without let up. I wasfeeling, I suppose, unkempt compared to her standards.I felt ill at ease and awkward because here was this gorgeous creature simply staring at me. I felt like apeasant in front of a queen, if you want the truth. And she asked me after several minutes of this uncomfortablegazing at me – but it was not really an asking. It was more like a statement of fact. Would I come and talk toher.I got up and went, but I’ve often wondered why I went. It was not a command in the sense of ‘Get your rearend up here.’ Yet, Linda, there w as force behind it, is all I can tell you. And I simply got up and w ent.She said, ‘We’re going to talk about you.’ Or something like that. It’s not an exact quote, but very similar. Shesaid, ‘Your name begins with ‘S,’ does it not?’ And I said, ‘Yes, my name is Sara.’She said, ‘Your name is also a word, your last name is a word besides being your last name.’ My marriedname at that time was Wisdom, which is a word besides being a last name.She told me I had four red-headed children, which I did and do. She told me my first child was born black-headed and turned red later. An absolute fact. I said yes to all this, rather open-mouthed and dumfounded. Iwas simply amazed, bowled over. I can’t even tell you my emotions at the time. I think I was intimidated byher looks, by her interest in me and by her force is all I can tell you, Linda. I don’t know how to explain it anybetter than that.She told me that I would get a divorce in 1980, which was several years later; that I would marry a man whosefirst name began w ith a ‘J.’ I said, ‘OK,’ this might or might not come to pass, kind of filing things aw ay. Sara's Introduction to Wicca and ReptiliansShe told me that I had a mission, something to do with reptilians. To my knowledge, that was the first time Ihad ever heard the word ‘reptilians,’ as in like a humanoid being. She asked me if I knew what a coven was. Isaid, ‘No, ma’am, I don’t.’ She said, ‘It’s like a wiccan.’ She did not use the word, ‘witch.’ She said‘wiccan.’ I said, ‘No, ma’am, I’m not familiar with that.’ She said, ‘It’s the study and love of Earth and how towork with Earth energies.’[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia: \"Wicca is a Neopagan religion or religious movement found inmany different countries, though most commonly in English-speaking cultures. Wicca was firstpublicised in 1954 by a British civil servant named Gerald Gardner after the British WitchcraftAct was repealed. He claimed that the religion, of which he was an initiate, was a modernsurvival of an old witch cult, which had existed in secret for hundreds of years, originating inthe pre-Christian Paganism of Europe.\"Wicca is thus sometimes referred to as the Old Religion. The veracity of Gardner's claimscannot be independently proven, and it is thought that Wiccan theology began to be compiled noearlier than the 1920s. Most traditions of Wicca remain secretive and require members to beinitiated.\" ]Basically she confounded me. I was not even vaguely familiar with the terms, with anything she spoke. It waslike I was speaking one language and she w as speaking totally over my head, other than the questions about mychildren.Then she told me that the number 13 would be very powerful for me. I asked her, ‘Why?’ She said somethingto the effect that the number 13 was not understood, that it was a very powerful number, and that I wouldunderstand what the number 13 meant.’ Then she took out what you and I would call a business card, except itwas blank on both sides. She told me that when I was totally alone, to do this spell that she wrote on the card,and I would get great understanding about my mission or something very similar to that. The exact words, Ihave actually forgotten.Well, Linda, I had four children. My first child is a genius; my second child/son is retarded; then I have twonormal children. I was never alone, Linda, never! It took seven years after the library for me to be alone. Onenight it dawned on me for the first time in years I was going to be alone. My kids were a little older and hadthings to do. My baby daughter, Lee, the one who lives down here by me now, was going to my mother's tospend the night. My husband w orked nights at General Motors. I thought, ‘I am alone. I’m going to find thatcard.’ Magic Ritual"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"5-pointed star pentagram inside circle.This ancient symbol has long been used for magic rituals.On it, the woman had told me to draw a pentagram on the floor and then to put a chair in the middle of it. Theonly warning she gave me was that until the spell was complete, no matter what I saw or heard, I was never toleave the chair. If I did, I could die. And I think part of the reason that I never tried it is that some part of mewas scared, some part of me was drawn to it. But on some level, there was still a great deal of fear. The cardsaid to draw the pentagram, put the chair in it, do not leave, give the offering, do the chanting, repeat thewords, and I would get a clue as to my mission in life.We were building a den and bedroom on at the time. The den was totally finished, but the bedroom was not. Ithad one complete wall up with sheet rock and a partial wall with sheet rock, so we had a couple of blankwalls and it was still in the process of being finished. I went in the unfinished bedroom and drew thepentagram (on the floor) with chalk approximately 5-foot in diameter. I placed my chair. The card also said totake an offering into the pentagram. I got to thinking, ‘What is an offering?’ I had no idea w hat an offering was.The only offering I could think of was that I had a cake cooked. I took a piece of cake and put it on a saucerand then went to the chair in the pentagram. But when I looked at the magic ritual words she had written on thecard, I realized that I did not know how to pronounce the words.WHO WERE YOU OFFERING THE CAKE TO?She did not say and I was dumb enough not to ask before. I honestly did not know. But even though I wassomew hat fearful, I thought it w as also a little risqué. I thought, ‘I’m going to have a kick.’ It’s going to be adelight, it’s a little bit scary.’ Mysterious, Strong Wind During RitualI got in the pentagram and set the chair in. I repeated the words as best I could, which were silly words, Ithought, at the time. They were certainly not normal English w ords that you and I would hear normally. Thedoors were shut. The window s were shut, and yet, this wind came up. I began to get very fearful. I realized onsome level that something was happening that I could not control. I closed my eyes. I remember that. Iremember thinking I hadn’t prayed in a long time, but this was probably a great time to start. The wind wasundeniably real. It was frightening! I was scared. \"Upright Alligator\" Appeared, Red EyesI had shut my eyes several times. I don’t remember how long I had them shut, but when I opened them – and Iknow this sounds totally bizarre – standing before me sitting on a dining room chair was what you and I wouldcall an upright alligator, except it did not appear frightening like it was going to attack. It had a steady starejust like the woman had. I’m a tall woman, 5' 8.5\". If I were sitting in a chair, the top of my head would still benear 5-foot-tall, I would think.DO YOU KNOW IF THE WOMAN'S EYES IN THE LIBRARY AND THE ALLIGATOR’S EYES HADVERTICAL PUPILS, AS OPPOSED TO ROUND?No, ma’am, I don’t. I don’t remember her eyes being any different from mine or your eyes. But the alligator’seyes were red, I do know that. They definitely had the vertical, up and down pupils. That I noticed. But Iimmediately shut my eyes. Unbeknow nst to me at the time, my daughter had gotten sick to her stomach and mymother had brought her back home. My mother, of course, knew that I was in the house. She let Lee out and shecome through the house yelling, ‘Mother! Mama, where are you?’ She come to the unfinished bedrrom w here Iwas and she opened the door and yelled, ‘Mama!’I said, ‘Lee, don’t!’ And about the time I yelled, the wind was so fierce that at first, it knocked my daughterdown kind of on her back hip to the side. Lee got up on her knees. And I said, ‘Oh, God.’ I went through such aperiod of fear there! All I can tell you is that I was praying loud and long and I know that sounds comical, butit’s the truth.WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THE BEING WHEN YOU HAD THE WIND BLOWING?Green, yellow-green, more of a yellow-green than a green.THINK OF SOMETHING THAT I MIGHT KNOW THAT WOULD BE CLOSE.Take a shade of emerald green and shade of lime green with yellow mixed and it had scales. It looked just likeif we had gone to the zoo and seen an upright alligator with red eyes gazing at you as in total curiosity, buttrying to communicate its essence with you."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Exa mple illus tra tion of re d- e ye d r e ptilia n huma noid © 1995 by David W. Chace.Reptile and Ritual Offering DisappearedWAS THE BEING STILL STANDING THERE?No, ma’am, when I opened my eyes again, the being was gone. My cake was gone. My saucer was gone. Thesaucer never came back. My daughter was very scared the first couple of days. She had to sleep with me.DID SHE SEE THE BEING?I asked her and I don’t know. I really don’t know. I know that Lee kept having nightmares for several days. Shewanted to sleep with a light on, or sleep with me. I don’t know, Linda. I truly don’t know.THE TIMING OF HER COMING HOME IS ODD, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO GO BACK TO THE EYES.COULD YOU PLEASE GIVE A DESCRIPTION IN TERMS OF SOMETHING I MIGHT KNOW FOR THERED COLOR YOU WERE LOOKING AT?The eyes were red is all I can tell you.DID THEY GLOW? OR WAS IT A RED LIKE YOU WOULD LOOK AT TOMATO SKIN?I’m going to say more red like you would look at tomato skin and yet, they had a power, Linda. A pow er thatwas direct. You felt the power from this creature. I was scared to death. I don’t know what I thought I couldconjure up, but whatever - it certainly was not that! Reptilian Communication?BEFORE YOUR DAUGHTER CAME HOME AND YOU WERE LOOKING EYE-TO-EYE ATAPPROXIMATELY A 4.5 TO 5 FOOT TALL ALLIGATOR WITH RED EYES THAT HAD VERTICALPUPILS LIKE A SNAKE’S OR A CROCODILE’S...Yes.DO YOU REMEMBER HAVING ANY IMPRESSION IN YOUR MIND OF A THOUGHT VOICE, OFSYMBOLS, OF ANY COMMUNICATION?No, I can’t say a thought. Right now , I can’t remember a symbol. The only thing that I can honestly tell you thatover the years, I thought it was communicating with me. Yet, I cannot tell you why or how, but communication,yes.WHAT WAS THE RESIDUE INSIDE YOURSELF AFTER THAT INCIDENT IN TERMS OF THEQUESTION: WHAT IS MY MISSION?I don’t know. At the time, it was so farfetched above and beyond anything I had ever thought or dreamed ordealt with. It was like I had been dropped off the face of the Earth into something I had never encounteredbefore and had nothing to relate to it with. I honestly don’t know. It was so fearful that for a time I don’t think I"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"did want to deal with it. It was only later, probably two or three years later, that I began to try to see what itmeant. I went back to the library often just to see if I could see her again.At that moment the 'alligator' appeared, I was too incoherently scared to think of anything. I don’t rememberanything but total fear at the time and stunned amazement - ‘Why did this happen? Why did she pick me? Whatdid this mean?’ I couldn’t answer any of those questions. It was like a foreign thing. Second Reptilian Experience in 1992Then about seven years ago in 1992, I knew a woman named Barbara. She was about two or three years olderthan me. She was an R. N. (registered nurse). I met her through a metaphysical class. She was very much intoholistic healing and UFOs.She said she could communicate with 'them' when she desired to - usually between 3 and 4 a.m. She could goto one certain window of her house and the UFOs would communicate with her. We talked about that quite abit. As an R. N., she was an extremely articulate, well-educated woman. In fact, as I was telling Jim, if I couldpoint out anything bad about Barbara, I could not. She was in every way to my knowledge a person oftruthfulness, great compassion, and I found her to be a delightful friend in every w ay. She was not married atthe time. I had gotten divorced and re-married James.I was very curious about UFOs at this particular time in my life and Barbara was very free and easy with herremarks. She apparently did not try to hide anything. She simply stated what she considered fact. If youbelieved it, fine. If you did not, it was still fine. She was a very soft-spoken woman, blond hair, about 5' 6\",very attractive lady. Her older husband had died of a heart attack three or years before I met her. She had nochildren. She was just a very fine lady. I respected her and admired her in every way. Human-to-Reptilian \"Replacement\"Back then, we lived right on a main highway. One day I was working in the yard and she stopped by and said,‘Sara, I am so tired.’ It was due to a couple of ladies being off. She said, ‘I’ve worked three weeks without aday off. The next two days I’m off and I’m totally exhausted. I’m too tired to even go out to eat.’I said, ‘Well, Barbara, I’ve got to put supper on the table in about half an hour. Why don’t you go take care ofyour client and come back here for supper? When you go home, you’re free.’She said, ‘Oh, that sounds wonderful! I would love it.’She came back. My husband was there. She was talking about how tired she was, that when she left our houseshe was going to go home, take a bath and spend the rest of the time in bed resting.We were having Mexican food. We went to the den with our meals. Barbara and I both took a goblet of icedtea. James took coffee. We were sitting there. We were having a good conversation. Then all of a sudden,there sitti ng across from me on my couch w as this repti li an person.THE THREE OF YOU WERE SITTING IN THE LIVINGROOM?In the den.IN THE DEN. AND YOU’VE GOT YOUR FOOD AND YOUR DRINK. AND WHAT EXACTLY DID YOUSEE OCCUR?She had on Army green jeans or Levis.THE ROOM IS NORMAL.Yes, ma’am.TELL ME THE FIRST MICROSECOND OF THINGS NOT BEING NORMAL. WHAT EXACTLYHAPPENED?Barbara made this statement, she said: ‘Sara, I am not just tired. I am absolutely gut tired to the bone. I am sotired, I’ve changed my mind about the bath. I think I’m going to go home and go to bed.’I looked up because it was kind of a cute remark the way she said it - and there was the reptilian.WERE YOU LOOKING AT BARBARA?Yes, she was on the couch. I was in one of the recliners.ARE YOU SAYING THAT NOW BARBARA IS NOT SITTING THERE, BUT A REPTILIAN IS IN HERPLACE? OR ARE YOU SAYING THAT A REPTILIAN IS SITTING NEXT TO BARBARA?No, ma’am. Barbara turned into the reptilian – absolutely, irrevocably what I’m telling you.DID THE REPTILE RESEMBLE WHAT YOU SAW WHEN THE WIND BLEW BEFORE?No, not exactly. This time the reptilian's eyes were yellow. They were kind of a yellow-green with the pupilgoing up (vertically), but they were not red at all. The skin was a yellow-green. But her nose, or snout, was notlong. It was rather short and triangular, but it w as not long at all. The alligator that I first told you about (in thew i nd) had a l onger snout."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Exa mple illus tra tion of ye llow - e ye d re ptilia n huma noid © 1995 by David W.

No , ma ’ a m. It w a s a d o ne d e a l w he n I s a w i t.WHAT EXACTLY WAS OCCURRING BETWEEN YOUR EYES AND THE REPTILIAN'S?It was like someone snatched Barbara away and the reptilian was in her place. Yet, I knew that what I waslooking at was Barbara. In fact, we had talked about reptilians at one time. She had asked me what I thought –did I think that reptilians were all bad? I told her that I wouldn’t assume that anything was all bad or all good.I assumed something like, ‘It’s people. There are good people and bad people.’ I would assume any race ofaliens would have the same choice of the factions.DID BARBARA MAKE ANY REACTION TO YOU AS A HAND RAISE? ANYTHING IN HER FACE?ANYTHING LIKE I NOW KNOW THAT YOU SEE I’M A REPTILIAN, BUT YOUR HUSBAND ISSITTING THERE. WAS THERE ANY INDICATION TO YOU FROM THE REPTILIAN THAT THEREPTILIAN KNEW THAT YOU WERE NOW SEEING A REPTILIAN BODY INSTEAD OF BARBARA’SHUMAN BODY?Only in her action of immediately running out of the house.WALK ME THROUGH THAT IN DETAIL. YOU ARE SAYING THAT YOUR HUSBAND IS EATINGAND IS NOT AWARE AT ALL...No, he was not. He never saw Barbara in her transformation at all.YOU ARE LOOKING AT HER. DO YOU REMEMBER IN THOSE MICROSECONDS IN LOOKING ATHER, DID YOU SAY ANYTHING LIKE, ‘BARBARA, WHAT HAPPENED?'I’m certainly sure that I did, but the only thing I remember is dropping the food. I dropped my plate and thegoblet (iced tea). The minute it dropped and hit the floor, I was still staring at her. Immediately, she got up andran out of the house.DID SHE SAY ANYTHING?To my knowledge – and I don’t know if James said she did or I remember it - but she said something like,‘I’ve got to go.’AS YOU DROP THE FOOD, CAN YOU HEAR THE SOUND OF THE PLATE HITTING THE FLOOR?Oh, yes.DO YOU SEE ANY REACTION BY THE REPTILIAN AT THE SOUND OF THE GOBLET AND PLATEHITTING THE FLOOR?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"If I do, I don’t remember. The only thing I remember thinking is that this is connected somehow with my firstincident in the library. That hit my mind. If there was anything else, I don’t remember it.SO, THE REPTILIAN DIDN’T FLINCH, MOVE, HEAD NOD, EYES BLINK, NOTHING?There was absolutely no blinking of the eyes. No, ma’am, that I remember. It was just there.IN THE NEXT MICROSECONDS, HOW DOES IT/BARBARA GET UP?If she got up i n any extraordi nary w ay, I don’t remember. It happened so qui ck, i t w as simpl y that w hen shemoved to the door, she was Barbara again – no longer reptilian.DID YOU SEE ANY TRANSFORMATION OR FLICKER OR ANYTHING BETWEEN THE REPTILIANBACK TO BARBARA?You know, Linda, I want to say yes that I noticed something about the head and chest, but I honestly can’t tellyou.THINK ABOUT IT NOW IN YOUR MIND’S EYE AND YOU KNOW WHAT HOLOGRAMS ARE?Yes.WOULD THERE BE ANYTHNG AKIN TO HAVING SOMETHING LIKE A HOLOGRAM OF BARBARASUDDENLY SUPERIMPOSED OVER THE REPTILIAN?(long pause) I don’t know . I truly don’t. All I can tell you that my emotions at the time were stunned. It was notfear so much as my mind linked the connection to the first incident in the library.WHAT IS YOUR HUSBAND SAYING TO YOU ABOUT YOUR DROPPING THE PLATE AND THEGOBLET?The mi nute Ba r ba r a r un o ut, J a me s ma de s o me ki nd o f r e ma r k l i ke , ‘ Sa r a , w ha t ha p p e ne d ?

He could not conceive she had runout and he could not conceive why I would have dropped the food and goblet of tea. He was just stunned –what happened?!WHAT DID YOU SAY?I said something like, ‘Did you see Barbara in any way different?’He said, ‘She looked awful tired.’ I knew right then that he had not seen her, as I had perceived her. Link Between Two Reptilian Incidents?DO YOU NOW HAVE AN IMPRESSION OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE RED-HAIREDREPTILIAN IN THE LIBRARY, THE RED-EYED REPTILIAN IN THE WIND AND SEEINGIT/BARBARA BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN SO EXHAUSTED? WHAT IS THE CONNECTION?The best I can tell you is that at the time I did not. But then Barbara Marciniak’s book came out, The Bringersof the Dawn around 1995. A lady told me about it and I like far-out books. I got the book and it made such animpression on me that I bought it on a Wednesday and Thursday morning I started reading the book. Thursdaynight when James came in for supper after work, I was still reading the book. I propped it up on the faucetswhen I did the dishes. I could not get the book out of my mind. The minute that I finished the book, I startedback on page one. I read the book 27 times!OH, MY GOSH.That’s right. I could not STOP reading the book. I took notebooks. I still have two or three notebooks. I tookeach chapter and then I took each page. Then I wrote how many words on each page was the word ‘created.’ Icircled each of those words in the book.‘CREATE’ OR ‘CREATING’ – WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE?I don’t know. It was like I had to do it. I don’t know.IN THE BRINGERS OF THE DAWN, ARE THERE ANY DESCRIPTIONS OF REPTILIANS?No descriptions at all, other than she calls them the ‘dark t-shirts,’ but there is no physical description at allthat you’re going to say, ‘If you ever see one, they look like this.’ Absolutely not.DID YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE BOOK HAD ANY REFERENCE TO REPTILIANS IN IT?Not until I read the book.DID BARBARA USE THE REPTILIANS IN THE BOOK IN ANY WAY?Yes. After the Reptilian Replacement"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"GOING BACK FOR A MOMENT TO BARBARA GOING OUT THE DOOR. YOU HAD KNOWN HERWELL. DID YOU THEN TALK WITH HER THAT NIGHT?No, ma’am, I did not talk with her that night. Not for a couple of days. Before, we were talking two or threetimes a week. She had an answering machine. I would leave her a message and she would call me back or viceversa. I did not know what to say, Linda. I thought, ‘How do you tell a person that you saw them in thismanner?’ Then if you knew me better, you would understand that I don’t like things that I can’t explain.After a week or so, I left her two or three messages. She did not return my calls. I thought the only thing I coulddo is take the bull by the horns and I’m going to go by her house. I knew she was there. I had seen the car in thedrive. I knocked on the door several times. Nobody came, but I knew instinctively that Barbara was there andshe di d not w ant to tal k.So, I very calmly said, ‘Barbara, you know w ho is here and I’m going to sit on the porch until you come out.’She immediately opened the door. She said, ‘Come on in.’ She was nice, but very cool, very distant, very –like a barrier was put up.She said – and this is an exact quote, as I remember it: ‘I know you saw me as I really am.’My first question was: ‘How many more is there just like you?’She said, ‘Sara, there are four or five, all women.’I said, ‘No men?’ She said, ‘No, not that I know of.’But, Linda, I never had nerve enough to say I saw her as a reptilian. She never mentioned the word ‘reptilian.’The only thing she ever said was, ‘I know you saw me as I really am.’HOW WAS THE CAMOUFLAGE OR DUALITY PERPETUATED?What do you mean?WHAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE IN APPEARING IN A HUMAN FORM AND THE REAL REPTILIANFORM?The only thing I have ever come to terms with on that is that Barbara was totally, absolutely exhausted fromworking. I think that weakness allowed the change.SO YOU DIDN’T TALK WITH HER ABOUT IT? YOU DIDN’T SAY, ‘HOW DO YOU DO THIS?’No, ma’am. I did not have nerve enough to mention the reptilian form. I did not know how to express it. Shewas very distant. She had put up a mental barrier. That was it. We never talked again to this day.SHE STILL LIVES WHERE YOU ARE?No, she lives about an hour from me now.SO, AS FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED, SHE IS STILL ALIVE AND STILL THERE?Yes. I heard through the grapevine that she had married. Whether that’s true or not, I’m assuming that it is. ButI do not know it for a fact. Barbara's Deep Interest in UFOsHOW DID SHE EXPLAIN HER INTEREST IN UFOS?She said that her mother – it seems to me that Barbara was the oldest child and she had a little brother, about ayear or so younger. Then her mother died in childbirth when Barbara was about 4. She said, ‘I knew my daddynever touched me. I can remember that as a kid. But he doted on my brother.’ She said, ‘When my mother diedand they come and took away her body, I was standing in the doorway. My daddy, for the first time I couldever remember him touching me, picked me up and set me on the edge of a dining table and told me: ‘I don’tknow how to tell you this. But you are not mine. He said, ‘Your daddy is from the heavens and I’m going toadopt you out.’That afternoon, he took her to some children’s home and she was adopted. She never went to her mother’sfuneral or anything.YOU’VE NEVER HAD A DISCUSSION WITH HER ABOUT HER PURPOSE, OR THE PURPOSES OFTHE OTHER WOMEN, AS REPTILIANS DISGUISED AS HUMANS - OR WHATEVER THE LINK IS TOTHE SUDDEN REPTILIAN APPEARANCE?No, she would not call me again. The two or three times that I tried to call her after the brief time at her house,she would never answer again.DO YOU THINK OF YOURSELF AS REPTILIAN?I have often wondered that. I don’t know.HAVE YOU EVER SEEN YOURSELF AS A REPTILIAN IN A MIRROR?No , ma ’ a m.ANY DREAMS ABOUT YOUR BEING ON A DIFFERENT PLANET, SURROUNDED BY REPTILIANSINSIDE OF A CRAFT, INTERFACING WITH REPTILIANS IN ANY WAY?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"No , ma ’ a m.BLOODLINES ARE THE KEY TO THE WHOLE HUMAN ABDUCTION SYNDROME AND JIM AND IARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MESOPOTAMIANBLOODLINE AND THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL PRESENCE.

I certainly know nothing about genetics, except what I read.WHAT IMPRESSION DO YOU HAVE ABOUT WHAT THE SIX WOMEN SHE MENTIONED WEREALSO REPTILES ARE DOING?I think I have power, more power than I realize.DO YOU MEAN THAT THE SIX OF YOU HAVE SOME AUTHORITY IN POWER IN THE REPTILIANWORLD AND YOU ARE DELIBERATELY MASQUERADED WITH AMNESIA AS NON-POLITICAL,NON-POWERFUL HUMANS?Linda, I don’t know.
