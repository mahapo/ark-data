Bigfoot. Those names have longbeen associated with tall, hairy creatures that appear to be half-man and half-ape. In 1978,a resident in rural Snohomish, Washington, had been hearing eerie, high-pitched screamsaround her forested property and her dog was agitated. One late afternoon, she could see ahairy, ape-like creature she estimated stood between 8 to 10 feet tall standing in the treessome distance from her back porch. When the Sasquatch began emitting sounds, she raninto the house for her tape recorder and was able to capture a few minutes.Click for podcast of Sasquatch screamsand this Earthfiles report.At the end of 2006, eyewitnesses in the United States and Malaysia reported seeing tall,hairy, Bigfoot-type creatures. The most dramatic incident was in Washington County,Wisconsin, on November 9, at 1 a.m. There in the woods near a place called Holy Hill, aman reported to the Sheriff’s Department that a 7-foot-tall, dark-haired animal - largerthan a bear - jumped into the back of the man’s pickup, dragged out a deer carcass andtook off running with it. Sheriff’s deputies never found the dead deer or the Bigfoot."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"A week later not far from Holy Hill, but in the neighboring county of Waukesha, two boysreported seeing a Bigfoot at the edge of the woods where they were playing on atrampoline. The creature was about a hundred yards away. The boys said it was: “a hairymonster on the corner of the woods, leaning on a tree.”At the same time on the other side of the world in the deep jungles of Malaysia, at least tenpeople in half a dozen regions described a Bigfoot creature and its footprints in the jungle.The distance between some of the tracks was nearly six feet. The footprints were pressedinto the ground at least three inches, suggesting great weight.

Jeff Meldrum, Ph.D.,received his Masters of Science Degree from Utah’s Brigham Young University in 1984after studying Vertebrate Locomotion. Five years later in 1989, he received his Ph.D. inAnatomical Sciences from the State University of New York in Stoneybrook. His Ph.D.research focused upon terrestrial adaptations in the foot skeletons of African monkeyswith implications for hominid bipedalism (walking, running on two legs). After that he didpost-doctoral work at Duke University for two and a half years. Then he worked asProfessor of Evolutionary Morphology in the Cell, Molecular and Structural BiologicalDepartment at the Medical School Campus of Northwestern University in Chicago. By1993, Jeff Meldrum became Professor of Human Anatomy at Idaho State University."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"In November 2006, Prof. Meldrum had participated in a Discovery Channel televisionprogram about Bigfoot/Sasquatch, and his new book entitled, Sasquatch: Legend MeetsScience was released in September 2006. Prof. Meldrum also has more than 200 plastercasts of alleged Bigfoot/Sasquatch footprints – some of which he has gathered himselffrom field investigations.But the media spotlight on his work provoked criticism from some fellow faculty members.Then a local Associated Press reporter took the angle that Bigfoot/Sasquatch sightings arehoaxes. The criticisms reached the internet where one false story even had Prof. Meldrumstripped of his tenure and fired for politically unacceptable research.Recently I talked with Prof. Meldrum about the unjustified attacks against him in thecontext of his distinguished academic career and his near-conviction that there is anunidentified species out there.August 2005, searching for Sasquatch in Cascade mountain range of Washington State.Left to right: Richard Noll; Prof. Jeff Meldrum; wildlife photographer and author,Peter Matthiessen; and John Mionczynski. Photograph © 2005 by Richard Noll.Interview:“WITH THAT KIND OF BACKGROUND AND THE FACT THAT YOU TAKE THESASQUATCH SERIOUSLY, I WOULD THINK THAT EVERYBODY ELSE SHOULDTAKE IT SERIOUSLY?One might think that (laughs). I have colleagues who say that I am a ‘believer;’ therefore, Iam no longer objective. That is not the case. I have always rejected the label of ‘believer’and its misapplication. It is used in a very derogatory sense. Belief, for most people, carriesthe connotation of a position of faith – one accepts a tenant or conviction in the absence ofconclusive proof. I have certainly not done that.I don’t know for a certainty if Sasquatch exists or not, by the standards of scientificmethodology.MEANING THAT YOU DON’T HAVE THE BODY.That’s right. But the charge that science doesn’t begin until there is a body is absolutelybaseless and ill-founded. It would be unscientific to ignore the evidence that is availableand to just simply wait sitting on one’s hands for a body to be provided or drop into one’slap.My position is there is ample circumstantial evidence, even physical evidence in the formof hair, which defies identification. That situation in itself should be perplexing to mostrational people.If there are strands of hair, which are incontestably hair – not some artificial fiber, and yetno professional hair identifier analyst can attribute them to a known animal, common oruncommon, is itself a perplexing situation that is worthy of our consideration.THAT LEADS TO YOUR NEW BOOK. HOW DID THE BOOK COME ABOUT ANDWHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE STRONGEST EVIDENCE YOU HAVE PRESENTEDSO FAR IN THAT BOOK?I became involved in this when I was confronted with a set of footprints. That’s what"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"really pulled me in. Once the footprints were in front of me, this was a very clear set ofvery fresh tracks about 35 to 45 in number along a muddy farming access road in thefoothills of the Blue Mountains outside of Walla Walla, Washington. There was no roomfor wrong identification. It was either a hoax; or it was the trace of a living animal. Givenmy background that we just discussed, I was in a particularly opportune position to renderreasoned opinion on that. I was impressed to the point where I felt compelled to pursue thequestion a bit further.WHAT WAS THE DATE AND TIME YOU WERE THERE? WHAT EXACTLY INRELATIONSHIP TO WALLA WALLA?It’s about a 20 minute drive to the east of the northeastern corner of Walla Walla, up intothe foothills to a place called Five Points because of the intersection of five rural roadsnearby. It occurred in February 19, 1996, just over ten years ago.HOW LONG WERE EACH OF THOSE PRINTS AND WHAT WAS THE DISTANCEBETWEEN EACH ONE?Where they were just strolling along the dirt road. Something had apparently spooked itbecause it spun, made a hairpin turn, and began walking a little more briskly. Thesefootprints were just under 15 inches in length.I could easily match the track, about 3 feet or 2.5 feet. But then when it was apparentlyspooked by presumably a car coming down this gravel road late on a Saturday night, earlySunday morning, it literally made a spinning turn and started walking back, glancing backover its shoulder as indicated by the right foot angling out at 45 degrees every couple ofsteps. Then it took off and literally began running on the front half of its feet. Its heelswere not making contact. The stride nearly doubled in length. The footprints, as it traveleddown across this fallow stubble field, it was leaving full length imprints, very deep, 2 to 2.5inches in the soft, moist, tilled soil, and made its way back across the field towards thecover of the ditch, where the tracks were lost in the ditch bed of hard gravel and sand soil.Sasquatch full-length track on left beside half-track on right.Photograph © 1996 by Jeff Meldrum.WHAT IS A TYPICAL LARGE MAN’S FOOT LENGTH?Typical is probably between 10 and 11 inches. Size 10 ½ is probably one of the mostcommon sizes for United States males. When you get up to 13 inches to 13.5 inches,you’re up to about 1% to 2% of the male population. Beyond that, a 14-inch to 15-inchfoot, you’re talking about probably .5% or .1% of the population. So, it’s an exceptionallylarge footprint.CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHY THIS FOOTPRINT IS NOT HUMAN?Yes, one of the things – this is what really grabbed my attention was that in several of the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"tracks were these half tracks where the heel was in the air, but not in the way that you or Iwould run down the beach and leave a small imprint with just the ball of our foot and thefive toes. This imprint comprised the entire half of the foot, in front of what I would inferwould be the position of what is called the transverse tarsal or mid joint, which in humansis quite stable. It screws into a locked position that helps to support the longitudinal arch,the arch along the length of the foot. That is a very characteristic feature of the humanfoot. But these track feet were very flat and then exhibited this sign of mid-foot flexibility,which is an ape characteristic. The mid-tarsal break, or the ability to flex the foot at thatmid point is an adaptation present in apes – particularly present in apes – that use agrasp/climbing adaptation in their locomotion. They have a robust big toe that diverges outand opposes the lateral four remaining digits in a pincher grip as the ape climbs up anincline, like a tree trunk or branch. In order to maintain that grasp, the mid-foot flexibilityallows the levering action of the hind part of the foot, the heel segment, to flex relative tothe front prehensile portion of the foot.It’s that interesting combination of features that is present in the Sasquatch foot that reallycaught my attention. It had a big toe that was no longer divergent, like in a chimpanzee orgorilla, but yet it seemed to retain that mid-foot flexibility and the toes were still noticeablylong. That was the key because in order for the toes to remain long, they have to be sparedthe bending portions that we impose on our feet, on our toes in particular, when we pushoff at the latter part or end of our step.But if the foot is flexed in the mid-foot and pushing off from the anterior part of the footinstead of through the big foot, then the toes could be spared those bending stresses andmaintain some of their length and lend the foot a greater degree of prehension than ispresent in the human foot, especially in the western human foot confined in shoes most ofits life.[ Editor's Note: Prehension can be defined as \"the application of functionallyeffective forces by the hand to an object for a task, given numerousconstraints\". This definition emphasizes the function and task. There areinfinite number of ways to grasp an object by changing the kinematics andkinetics of the hand. We need to control 30 mechanical variables to hold anobject stable, 6 for each digit: 3 components of acting force and 3 componentsof moments on the object. We can change the force sharing (how the forcesare distributed among fingers. Each finger can have a certain proportion of thesum of all finger forces) among the involved digits. We can also changekinematics of prehension using different finger positions to grasp an object.Source: Penn State, Biomechanics.]All that taken together is really an elegant adaptation for the habitat in which these animalssupposedly are in, which is very broken, rough terrain with lots of steep inclines. Thisallows them to navigate through it much more efficiently than we can with stiff boots on.These were clearly not made by a simple set of carved feet strapped to someone’s bootstromping in the mud opportunistically taking advantage of that softer soil! They were not.They could not have been, in my estimation.If you were using static, stiff feet, it would have required – due to the variation from levelwalking to walking up inclines and running down across the soft soil – it would haverequired at least three sets of varied footprints with variation in positions carved into thetracks and an additional set to be used in those instances where just the front half of thefootprint left an imprint. A stiff, straight foot could not be used there to make the halftracks where only the fore part, or front half, of the foot left deep imprints.So, based on that, it just seems very unlikely. I guess you never say never. But theremarkable consistency in some of the features: the presence of the half tracks;the presence of the mid-tarsal pressure ridge that was evident in this particular set oftracks.Those physical facts spurred me on to look for other examples. So, I began to identifyother incidents where half tracks were identified. The proportions were similar, the contextwas similar. There were other examples of mid-tarsal pressure ridges, which occur whenthe foot makes full contact with the ground. But then as the step proceeds and the heel iselevated, the pressure is concentrated over the fore part of the foot proportionally becausehalf of the foot is bearing the entire body weight. It will sometimes create a pressure ridge,which is a release of pressure where material is extruded behind the foot, behind thecontact area of the foot. As I looked for more examples of that, more of them popped upwith similar configurations, similar placement and proportion, and as those examplescontinued to accumulate, it just became more and more unlikely in my mind that thesewere just a series of spurious hoaxes."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Julie Davis Encounter with SasquatchAugust 5, 2000, San Juan National ForestA sketch based on Julie Davis eyewitnessaccount of August 5, 2000, encounter with 8-foot-tall Sasquatch.WHEN IT COMES TO EYEWITNESS REPORTS OF ENCOUNTERS WITH THESEBIG SASQUATCH/BIGFOOT CREATURES, WHICH ONE DO YOU KNOW ABOUTTHAT HAS THE MOST DETAIL AND SUBSTANCE?The one that has always impressed me is the experience of Julie Davis (former instructorat the University of Colorado Law School) in August 2000. Julie is very experienced in theoutdoors and is very familiar with bears. She has hiked solo on the Continental Divide trailthrough much of Colorado. She is an avid goat packer. She was out with a couple of hergoats and dogs in a very remote area of southern Colorado in the San Juan Mountains.She had gone off trail to get a little more secluded. Even in that remote area, she was stillbumping into other hikers on the trail and she just wanted seclusion. She went severalmiles off trail to a nice meadow with a lake and set up camp. She was sitting on a rockplaying a recorder. Upon arriving, she said her dogs had acted up. She thought this wasbear country and there might be a bear stalking the meadow. Then the dogs were acting upmore and she didn’t want the dogs to tangle with the bear, so she had taken them andstuck them in the tent. She grabbed her pepper spray. As she stepped out of the tent, shenoticed the goats were very attentive to something behind her tent.She stood up and turned around and was there face-to-face with a Sasquatch standing inbroad daylight right behind her tent about twelve feet away. She locked eyes with thisindividual. She told me she was looking at something she had never seen before. It staredat her and then glanced at her goats and then looked back at her and then looked at thegoats.She had a very good look at its face and was able to describe its facial features. And thenthere was a sense of, ‘I won’t bother you if you don’t bother me.’ At that point, it turnedand strode off toward the tree line. She remarked that its grace and fluidity of its gategiven its bulk and size. It glanced back at her and then disappeared into the woods.[ Editor's Note: Julie Davis has been quoted about her encounter this way:\"It had very, very broad shoulders — huge shoulders. Its face was almostcompletely covered in fur, but human-like, on the human side of halfwaybetween a human and gorilla.\"\"Medium-chestnut fur like an Irish setter's. Big brown eyes. From my workwith the Great Bear Foundation in Montana, I've had a lot of time to get toknow what bears look like up close. This animal was bigger than any bear.It uttered a low rumble, and immediately a second animal — slightly smallerand lighter in color — looked at me from behind the big one. Then theyturned, ran back into the forest, and disappeared.\" Source: The Denver Post,January 5, 2003.]Prof. Meldrum: \"One of the things that stuck in my mind the most because it was an oddobservation, I thought. Julie noted there was short hair across the bridge of its nose. It didnot have a beard per se, but it had hair on its face, which came up quite high on its cheeksand was continuous right across the bridge of its nose.That struck me as odd because if you have the vision of a chimpanzee or gorilla, neitherhave that feature. But I reached to my bookshelf and got a book, which had some verysharp portraits of adult male orangutans. Sure enough, they have very short hair thatextends right across the bridge of their nose."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Glowing Red Eyes?WHAT ABOUT THE EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS WHERE THEY HAVE SEEN ASASQUATCH STANDING IN FRONT OF THEM AND THE EYES WERE RED?Right. One of the early encounters I had with a witness, Darrell Owen, in northernCalifornia, laid claim to having a videotape of one in which the Sasquatch was under aridge reclining and when they approached, its eyes glowed red, as if they wereself-illuminating.I spoke with the fellow at the video lab who enhanced and highlighted and provided stillsof the images for Darrell Owen and basically he said he could not see any of the thingsOwen described. There was no eye shine that he could see. I’m always a bit skeptical ofthe self-illumination descriptions. But if this Sasquatch animal has proportionally largeeyes in order to gather light for nocturnal behaviors, a widely dilated pupil would producea red eye effect just as you get with the flash on an individual with very pale blue eyes, ordilated eyes under dim light conditions. Where Are Sasquatch Skeletons?WHY DO YOU THINK WE DON’T HAVE A BODY OR A SKELETON?It still is perplexing that we haven’t, that someone hasn’t stumbled on something. Butwe’re making discoveries all the time. In paleontology, new species are found. If this is alarge body omnivorous primate, it probably has no natural predators. It would be at the topof its food chain. If it’s a large ape, it probably has a very long life expectancy of 40 to 60years perhaps. It reproduces rarely, if we can extrapolate from the great apes. Births arerare and infrequent and widely spaced. An adult female orangutan may give birth to only 4individuals in her entire lifetime with anywhere from 4 to 8 years between births.So, given a very rare population with long life expectancy, with infrequent reproductionand no natural predators – when death occurs, it’s a rare event. Two, it’s going to be anatural event. Therefore, animals that die natural deaths as they become old and decrepitand ill, they secret themselves off and once they pass away, insects and other predators eatthe remains and the skeletons are carried off by scavengers, by porcupines and rodents.People don’t realize that a porcupine can make in very short order gnaw a large bone tonothing. I’ve found elk bones which have been chewed by porcupines and there is just notmuch left even to identify which particular bone it is. They are just chewed down to almostnothing.Anyway, the second factor then is the physical environment. That is where these Bigfootanimals are most reported are wet, coniferous forests. Particularly in the PacificNorthwest, these are soils that are largely volcanic-derived that are notoriously acidic.Acidic soils and conditions are not conducive to preserving bones. So, what scavengershaven’t eaten, the physical environment quickly deteriorates and decomposes. In a shorttime, there is not much left.If you stop and think that every year, literally thousands of deer die of winter kill frompredators and succumbing to the rigors of winter. Yet, when you go out for a hike in thespringtime, you don’t find the floor of the forest littered with deer carcasses. The carcassesare very efficiently recycled. Could Sasquatch Live in Subterranean Tunnels?WHAT ABOUT THE IDEA THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME SUBTERRANEANTUNNELS RUNNING IN THIS COUNTRY FOR REASONS UNKNOWN, BUT THESESASQUATCH/BIGFOOT MIGHT HAVE A SUBTERRANEAN LIFE?It’s an interesting proposition, but one that is based on meager or non-existent evidence.Yes, there are lava tubes and caves in the Cascade Mountains, but no one has everdocumented or demonstrated the existence of any extensive network that could be utilizedfor travel and habitation by an unknown population.I don’t think you have to resort to that scenario. I think their rarity, their behavior – if youtalk to any person who has experience with wildlife photography and trapping of exoticanimals. Invariably, they will tell you that the most difficult animal to deal with, to locate,photograph, capture – are animals that are rare, solitary, that are far ranging and are"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"nocturnal. All of those aspects apply to the Sasquatch – plus, we have an animal that hasan intelligence at least on par with the great apes, if not more so.

He barked up a different tree and found a couple of skeptics on campus who hadin the past said negative things about my research and my preoccupation with the subject.He created a controversy and quite frankly misrepresented. My tenure has never beenquestioned or placed in jeopardy, nor have I ever talked with the reporter about how long Imight be at ISU. Never happened.BUT YOUR TENURESHIP AT IDAHO STATE UNIVERSITY IS IN PLACE AND ISNOT THREATENED?Absolutely. ”In a review of Prof. Jeff Meldrum’s new book, Dr. George Schaller, Vice President of theWildlife Conservation Society’s Science and Exploration Program wrote:“Jeff Meldrum is a scientist, an expert in human locomotor adaptations. InSasquatch: Legend Meets Science, he examines all evidence critically, not toforce a conclusion, but to establish a baseline of facts upon which furtherresearch can depend. His science is not submerged by opinion and dogmaticassumption. With objectivity and insight, he analyzes evidence from tracks,skin ridges on the soles of feet, film footage, and DNA, and he compares it tothat on primates and various other species. He disentangles fact fromanecdote, supposition, and wishful thinking, and concludes that the search foryeti and sasquatch is a valid scientific endeavor. By offering a criticalscrutiny, his book - Sasquatch - does more for this field of investigation thanall the past arguments and polemics of contesting experts.” 2005 - Did Sasquatch Upend Rock As \"Calling Card\"?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Richard Noll measuring height of upturned rock found in Cascademountain camp site in August 2005.

They called me over and askedwhat I thought of it and did I see anybody move the large rock to that spot. I hadn’t. Tentswere further away and no one was moving rocks. The rock was about 12 feet away fromwhere the track was and where the track was found is the only place that rock could havecome from. There were other similar rocks near the track.\"Our guess was that the rock was moved the previous night. I let Peter stay in my camperthat night and his tent was unoccupied. John stayed in his own tent and I slept in the cab ofmy truck.
