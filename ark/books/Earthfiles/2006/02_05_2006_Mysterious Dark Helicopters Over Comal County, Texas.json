I want it to stop.\" -John Cores, Rancher Guadalupe County (right yellow) is located in south central Texas east of San Antonio and southeast of NewBraunfels,which is its largest city and county seat 29 miles northeast of San Antonio and 45 miles southwest of Austin. Updated - February 9, 2006 Guadalupe County, Texas - This past week, the SanAntonio Lightning news website reported that the Federal Aviation Administration has notbeen able to identify two, so-called 'dark helicopters' reported near the ground on a ComalCounty, Texas, ranch. The ranch is actually in Guadalupe County, southeast of NewBraunfels and east of San Antonio. On November 23rd, and a month later on December22nd, Guadalupe County rancher, John Cores, filed a complaint with the FAA, after ablack and another dark blue helicopter intruded where his cattle water and graze. Mr.Cores says he could not see ID markings on the helicopter.He told the San Antonio Lightning: \"One tried to land by my cattle tank, but left when Iapproached. It had no number I could see. My biggest concern is that they (helicopters)are scaring my cattle. I want it to stop.\"Mr. Cores did not photograph either of the two intruding helicopters. But out of curiosity,he got a camera to photograph a helicopter flying over his ranch at a higher altitude whichhe thought looked like the original offending choppers. He photographed a Robinson 22 or 44 long-tailed, small helicopter used for pilot instruction and other civilian work. FAA"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"inspector, Tom Hennessee, received copies of the distant helicopter photos and told SanAntonio Lightning that such complaints \"are not uncommon\" without explaining why lowchopper intrusions are common. Mr. Hennessee also said \"it is virtually impossible\" totrack down specific helicopters without knowing an ID number.Contributing to the I. D. challenge is this odd fact: dark numbers on dark painted aircraftare legal. I talked to rancher John Cores this week about the problem that if dark colorednumbers are legal on dark paint, how would anyone be able to see them? Mr. Cores hadalso received a letter from the FAA inspector saying the agency had closed the case due toinsufficient evidence, meaning no I. D. numbers to investigate. FAA Altitude Regulations for AircraftFAR Sec. 91.119, Para. B, C and D(Federal Air Regulations)Concerning minimum safe altitude which states \"except when necessary for take-off orlanding, no person may operate an aircraft below the following altitudes:\"A. Anywhere an altitude allowing, if a power unit fails, an emergency landingwithout undue hazard to persons or property on the surface.\"B. Over any congested area of a city, town or settlement or over an open airassembly of persons, an altitude of 1,000 feet above the HIGHESTOBSTACLE within a horizon radius of 2,000 feet of the aircraft.\"C. Over other than congested areas an altitude of 500 feet above the surface,except over open window or sparsely populated areas. In those cases, theaircraft may not be operated closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel,vehicle or structure.\"D. Helicopters. May be operated at less than the minimums prescribed inPara. B or C of this section if the operation is conducted without hazard topersons or property on the surface. In addition, each person operating ahelicopter shall comply with any routes or altitudes specifically prescribed forhelicopters by the Administrator (FAA).\"Interview:John Cores, Guadalupe County rancher, New Braunfels, Texas: \"I was born 58 yearsago into an Air Force family. I grew up around aircraft. I have never had a problem withaircraft, especially a helicopter coming down in my backyard until November 23, andDecember 22, 2005.I was told the helicopters had to have I. D. numbers. That was by Faye from the FAA,Local District Standards Office. She said they are 12 inches high. They can even be blacknumbers and a black background! Below is the incidence report I filed with the FAA.'Incidence report:First ChopperWhen? 1:30 p.m., November 23, 2005WHERE? About 200 yards east southeast of 29 minutes 39.10 seconds northby 98 minutes 06.31 seconds west. That's the location. Guadalupe County (notComal Cty)WHY? That's the question.HOW? About 1:30 p.m. on Nov. 23, 2005, I heard a helicopter approachingand stepped out the back door of my house to see a dark helicopter in a finalapproach mode from the northeast. The chopper flew low over my neighbor'spasture and ended its descent hovering at about 10 feet over the catch pondthat feeds my stock pond.The chopper hovered for a few seconds, and then ascended to a thousand orso feet and headed back northeast. The helicopter was a dark black or bluewith no visible numbers. The paint was finished in a clear coat that is shiny asopposed to a flat black."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"2nd ChopperOn December 22, 2005, at 11 a.m., another dark chopper again visited thesame location, only this time seemingly trying to stay 500 feet from personsand structures. The aircraft hovered for more than a few seconds and left.This incident made me recall another incident involving a helicopter. InOctober 2005, a helicopter actually landed in the pasture next to mine. It waslike a smaller version of the local Air Life helicopter blue and white with adolphin kind of shape. A man exited the helicopter and walked towards myneighbor's house. I didn't report it until after the November 23rd incident. Icalled my neighbor, explained the landing and said I didn't think much of it atthe time, only that it was odd. I figured my neighbor flew, or had a friend whoflew. But he didn't and he didn't know about that day time landing behind hishouse.Investigation:Those were the incidents. We now turn to the investigation. Having hadtraining and practice as a military policeman, I was curious about the mystery.I learned that a flight school was located at the New Braunfels Airport. 1.5hours after the incident, I was at the New Braunfels Airport and saw two ofthe black birds. I was told by an airport employee that they belonged to theflight school. I asked to see the pilots, but no one was available. I asked to seeflight plans and was informed they don't file them.It turns out this info was false, but it sent me off on a wild blue goose chase. Itwas not until December 22, 2005, at 5 p.m., that I saw a helicopter from theflight school when it flew over my house, apparently in no violation. It was asilver-colored helicopter. It landed at the New Braunfels Airport which I cansee from my house. I called to verify it as belonging to the school and it did.I talked with more than a few people in the industry. No one ever surveyedthe site (at ranch), but everyone was quick to lecture me about helicopters.The story was remarkably the same.First point: helicopters have different regulations than fixed-wing craft. Theycan come right down to the ground. They just can't land.Second point: it was probably a training exercise for emergency landing wherethe instructor tells the pilot 'OK, the engine has quit. Pick a spot and land.'Third point: Helicopters need to fly at low altitudes to check powerlines, gaslines, fence lines, and even work cattle. (These uses of the helicopter areobviously legitimate uses, but should be covered by flat plans and enforced asmore development occurs and cases of abuse arise.)I was even given a name of someone as the culprit. But it turned out hishelicopter was white. It didn't take long to see the existence of what I call the'Brotherhood of the Helicopter.' I pushed all the buttons and got anin-your-face attitude in order to get someone's attention.'John Cores: \"The entire industry pilots, support personnel and the FAA have been unableto give any answers to the questions raised by this incident. Indeed, the FAA's owninvestigation lasted from Dec. 29 until Jan. 12, 2006. They never visited the site (on myranch). So, we don't know what it was. If it's a training exercise, they need to go to atraining field to do those training exercises. Like I said, I grew up around aircraft andnever had a problem with them. I'm in the middle of 68 acres. It's hard to put a helicopterdown here any place, even if they are allowed to right on the ground without some sort ofconsequence. If anybody other than myself walks in among my cattle, they go berserk.AND NOW YOU ARE SAYING THE CATCH-22 IS: IF THE HELICOPTER/S THATHAVE COME DOWN ON YOUR PROPERTY ONE TO THE GROUND AND ONECLOSE TO THE GROUND WHERE YOUR CATTLE ARE AND IF THEY ARE DARKCOLORED AND IF THE I. D. NUMBERS ARE DARK, YOU WOULD HAVE NO WAYOF GETTING I. D. NUMBERS TO REPORT TO THE FAA IN THE FIRST PLACE?That is the only thing that I can conclude from this. Now, who that was (in the darkchoppers) and what they were doing remain questions that aren't answerable because ofthat. So, we can't find out. There is a very big question: who was that? And what are theydoing there? That's still unanswered.AND WHAT YOU ARE RAISING IS THE QUESTION: IF THE RULES ARE"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"DIFFERENT FOR HELICOPTERS, THEN THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE LANDING NEAR WATER, NEAR CATTLE THAT CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS. THEISSUE WOULD BE, WHY?Exactly.\" Earthfiles Viewer Replies 1) February 6, 2006\"I have been a helicopter/airplane pilot for 20+ years and was based in South Texas forseveral years. The fuzzy pictures are possibly identifiable as a Robinson R-22. The mastand generally small round appearance is very indicative of this type helicopter.\"The R-22 is used as a training helicopter and as such someone is probably using thisrelatively out of the way area for training.

I just hope they are not terroristor drug dealers learning to fly out of FAA range.\" 3) February 6, 2006\"The pictures of the helicopter(s) in your latest article on Earthfilesappear to be similar to the OH-6A. See the links.http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/oh-6-pics.htmhttp://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/oh-6-specs.htm \" 4) February 6, 2006\"I've seen your Black Helicopter coming in for a landing at the San Antonio InternationalAirport within the last few week.I thought it was unusual because it was completely black with no markings at all. I live inComal County and I have seenseveral helicopters over the last year but they are usually to far away to tell if they haveany marking.\" 5) February 6, 2006\"In an effort to define just what type of aircraft is depicted in the picture of \"The BlackHelicopter\" , I submit this from 40+ years of aviation activity.( Pilot, Aircraft mechanic,aircraft designer and builder .) Best estimate is the craft depicted is a two placereciprocating engine powered Robinson R-22. Given that this is a civilian aircraft(non-military) of limited range , a radial of 150 miles maximum can be ascribed to thepossible area of inquest. A good starting point would be the review of all Robinson R-22`slocated via the FAA Registry within this region of Texas. As this is a \"standard category'licensed manufactured civilian aircraft Identity numbers and registration should be on file(provided that this aircraft is being operated within the confines of the FAA Regulations)My guess is there is a flight training operation or a private operator that has been using thegiven airspace around the gentleman`s ranch as a practice area . Frankly his cows are safe,as this helio is not capable of lifting and flying away with anything more than sage brushcaught on it`s landing skids with two folks on board. As far as annoying the cows or therancher, well let`s just say it`s considered poor form to be conducting low level flight opswithout asking permission of the given land owner.... Hope this aids in clearing up thesituation.\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 6) February 6, 2006\"Pictures look like Robinson R-22 Light Helicopters. I am a pilot andthe boom tail configurationseems correct. Their Range is only 200 miles, 300 with auxiliary tanks.That information might help in ID'ingthe airport where they are based. If they are R-22's they do not havean in-air refuel capability.\" 7) February 5, 2006\"I'm a Veteran 20 year Naval Aviation Chief with 7k combat aircrew hours. The mysteryhelicopter on your site has a few features that narrow the type/model types. It was a fuzzyimage, but I think this is close:http://www.cbhelos.com/300CBi%20specs.jpg The absence of a distinct tail boom androtor mast narrow things a bit. The outline of the front(cockpit) fuselage section is in thecategory of a small utility type helicopter. These are common with Sheriff departments andranchers. I searched this and included a search result that has 3D views and things like therange. If somebody really wanted to find the helo, go for type/max range/color. Draw amax round trip range circle around the point observed on the map.
