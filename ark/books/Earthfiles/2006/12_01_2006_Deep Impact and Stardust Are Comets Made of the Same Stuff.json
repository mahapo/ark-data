Since its launch in March 2004, Rosetta hasbeen on a trajectory that will eventually lead it to its landing on a comet in the first half of2014. After landing, Rosetta will burrow into Comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko,named after two Russian scientists who discovered the 2-mile-diameter comet in 1969.The Rosetta spacecraft is heavy and needs to use three gravity assists from Earth and onefrom Mars in February 2007 to get to Comet 67P seven years from now.This is the third human effort since 2000 to get close to comets. On July 4, 2005, theNASA Deep Impact mission slammed into Comet Tempel I with cameras andspectroscopes operating. Back on Earth, the largest infrared telescope ever launched intospace, Spitzer, and other instruments were also watching. Behind these scientific effortsare the questions: what exactly are comets made of? And did comets bring water and seedsof life to Earth long ago?Actual cratered surface of Comet Tempel I ninety secondsbefore the impactor smashed into the fluffy ice at 23,000 mph.Photograph courtesy NASA.NASA illustration of Comet Tempel I with its many ice/gas geysers"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"as Deep Impact prepares to launch its impactor into thecomet on July 4, 2005.

S. Air Force's Utah Test and Training Range.The video image above was taken from a NASA DC-8 plane flyingat the eastern edge of the Nevada state line.What's interesting is that there are agreements, and differences, in the data between thetwo missions. Originally, scientists assumed that what would be found in one comet wouldbe found in all comets. The hypothesis is that comets are primordial - residues of the cold,early solar system on or about the time that the sun began to flare into a hot star. Thepresumed ancient purity of comets has long tantalized planetary astrophysicists andastronomers who have asked: could comets be the source of Earth water and life?As we enter 2007, both the Stardust and Deep Impact science teams are preparing papersfor scientific journals about their respective discoveries so far. Recently, I talked to one ofthe chemists who gave me a glimpse into the data. Once it was thought that comet\"snowballs\" were born and grew up in the Kuiper Belt and Oort cloud that surround thesolar system's planets. The picture that is emerging now about the solar system's birth is achurning mixing bowl. Icy dust from far beyond where Neptune and Pluto are today wereswirled into the gases and dust around the new hot, sun and flung back out again to thefrigid edges. Adding to the complexity is the fact that apparently not all comets are thesame age.Although the two science teams have ended up with different data concerning carbonatesand clays, there is solid agreement that both Tempel I and Wild 2 comets have crystallinesilicates, tiny crystalline rock such as peridot and jadite, which are pale to darker green onEarth. Those crystals imply both comet substances were exposed to high heating and rapidcooling.The chemist who talked with me recently is Carey Lisse, Ph.D., Prof. of Physics andSenior Research Scientist, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab (APL) in Laurel, Maryland.Prof. Lisse is also a member of the Deep Impact Science Team and Principal Investigatorfor the Chandra X-Ray and the Spitzer telescopes.Interview:Carey Lisse, Ph.D., Prof. of Physics and Senior Research Scientist, Johns HopkinsApplied Lab (APL) in Laurel, Maryland. Prof. Lisse is also a member of the DeepImpact Science Team and Principal Investigator for the Chandra X-Ray and theSpitzer telescopes: \"One of the most important findings in both Stardust and Deep Impact– we are all very much in agreement on this – is there are silicates. There had to be a lot ofmixing in the early solar system. In order to do the annealing, to change to glassycrystalline silicates, you had to be inside the orbit of present day Mercury. But the cometsare formed out past Neptune. So, you had to have an efficient mechanism to bring stuffvery close to the sun and then send it back out again.One of the immediate consequences of all this is that the whole early solar system had tobe churning and turning over and mixing radially. Stuff would come all the way into thesun and then go all the way out again. That is a very important result. Different Deep Impact and Stardust DataThe carbonates and clays that we claim we detected with Deep Impact have not beenfound to date by the Stardust mission. We see a disagreement at least right now betweenStardust and Deep Impact results. There is a number of reasons why those disagreementscould be there. It could be as simple as the fact that Stardust collected its samples in a veryhot way. In other words, the little pieces of dust had to be slowed down in aerogel andthey were heated doing that."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"It could also be that Stardust was only sampling surface material from their comet (Wild 2)and Deep Impact saw very definite differences between the surface material and theinterior material from which the bulk of the ejecta came.But also on the other hand, it could be that Deep Impact only sampled one place on CometTempel I. That’s the place which just happened to be between two large impact craters.But Stardust sampled all throughout the coma of Wild 2. In other words, Stardust may wellhave sampled all along the surface of Wild 2 and gotten a much better global average.Deep Impact may have in fact sampled a very unique place on Tempel I. Let’s go back tothose two impact craters. They were about 300 meters across (2,953 feet) that were oneither side of our impact site. When you hit a comet – we know this because we saw thiswith Deep Impact – you eject a lot of dusty material. But you also create a lot of very hotwater and carbon dioxide. We saw this with our Deep Impact fly-by spectrometers.Yellow arrows point out the two craters about 900 meters (2,953 feet)in diameter between which the Deep Impact impactor crashed and exploded a craterof debris for scientists to study with spectrometers on July 4, 2005. Image courtesy NASA.Those very hot gases can be reactive, can create chemistry. It’s not hard to believe thatyou could have possibly made some of the carbonates and clays during the impact event.So, we have to think about this a lot and scratch our heads, but for right now, I would saytime is going to tell whether with more work. Stardust has only looked at 10% of itssamples – and has to worry about the implications of their system effects (where the dustis heated as it moves into the aerogel.) It’s not clear. But maybe they are going to be ableto work out what happens when stuff gets collected in aerogel.What Deep Impact and Stardust won’t be able to allow for is surface versus interior or oneplace on a comet versus many places on a comet in sampling. So, we’re probably,unfortunately, in the end left with an open question mark and will have to wait untilmissions like Rosetta core into a comet - land on and sample a comet and look at it for along time and really study the whole structure of the comet to answer questions about thecarbonates and the clays.[ Editor’s Note: European Space Agency’s Rosetta Orbiter Mission – TheEuropean Space Agency (ESA) office in Paris, France, says missioncontrollers the last week of November 2006 began preparing for the Rosettaspacecraft's swing-by Mars in February 2007.Since its launch in March 2004, Rosetta has been on a trajectory that willeventually lead it to its final destination during the first half of 2014: to landand burrow into Comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The spacecraft isheavy and needs to use three gravity assists from Earth and one from Mars inFebruary 2007 to get to the comet seven years from now.Comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko was discovered in 1969 by K.Churyumov, University of Kiev, Ukraine, and S. Gerasimenko at the Instituteof Astrophysics in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. The comet is 4 kilometers in diameter(2.4 miles) and orbits around the sun every 6.6 years at distances rangingbetween 186 million kilometers (115,599 miles) to 857 million kilometers(532,629 miles).On arrival at Comet 67P, the Rosetta will enter orbit around the comet andstay with it as it journeys in towards the Sun.Mission goals:To study the origin of comets, the relationship between cometary andinterstellar material and its implications with regard to the origin of the SolarSyste m.]"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" No Amino Acids, but Amorphous Carbons and PAHsThe amorphous carbons and the PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) – I thinkeverybody agrees on and is pretty exciting stuff. People have pretty much known theamorphous carbon before we ever went to a comet. That amorphous carbon oforganic-like dust could contain the precursors to life – I think there is a connection there –a tenuous connection, but it’s probably there. And we need to do a little bit more work.Again, we probably have to wait for Rosetta to dig some of this stuff up and put it in theirsample bin.[ Editor's Note:Amorphous Carbons are not crystallized graphite, but glassy carbon.'PAHs' are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Prof. Lisse: \"Think Bucky Ballsand carbon nanotubes and graphite which has been exposed to hydrogen andwater. That could also be catalytic for life or it could be a component. Butthere is nothing that shrieks that there has to be bacteria or life. We don't havethat.\"Structure of a multi-walled nanotube © Alain Rochefort,Center for Research on Computation and its Applications (CERCA). ]The PAHS are something we’ve seen between the stars, just like the silicates. We expect tosee PAHs in comets if they are primitive material. I think we have very strong informationabout that from Deep Impact from watching the very hot PAHs when we first hit it(Tempel I). We see it in the Spitzer spectrometer. I think we’re seeing indications of it withthe Deep Impact fly-by infrared spectrometer. And we also see it later on with Spitzer inthe cool material. The PAHs are there.One thing that’s important that I had not realized until I talked to my colleague who is aPAH expert, Dr. Lee, is that PAHs are very much a minority constituent. We see themeasily because they are really very good emitters of thermal infrared radiation, but they area very small fraction of the carbon in a comet.They aren’t the bulk majority of the carbon, which becomes important in chemistry lateron to build the structures and chemicals and minerals we see on Earth. So, the PAHs aremore a tracer of things. It’s not clear if they are important at all in the astrobiologyimplications.THE WHOLE POINT OF WONDERING ABOUT WHETHER COMETS MIGHT HAVECONTRIBUTED TO DEPOSITING LIFE ON THIS PLANET OR OTHER PLANETS ISONE OF THE MAJOR QUESTIONS THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN: ARE COMETSPUTTING WATER AND POSSIBLY LIFE ON THIS PLANET, RIGHT?Comets spend the vast majority of their lives very far out from the sun where it’s very coldwhere chemical reactions move very slowly – it’s much more likely, it seems to me, thatcomets brought the basic feedstocks of these materials to Earth. Comets bombarded Earthwhere we had liquid water and it was much warmer temperatures, so that’s where thereactions occurred that led to life. We do see, for example – we haven’t seen any evidenceof amino acids or sugars or complex bio-molecules in comets. But we do see amino acidsin the asteroids and meteorites that come from asteroids, which come from a muchwarmer, higher temperature process.So, again, this is indirect evidence for the fact that if you brought - if you took a cometand melted it down and converted it, you could create amino acids, the same way if youtook a comet and slammed it into the Earth and altered it and also warmed up the materialon it, it could also create amino acids.So, my answer to your question is that I do not think comets brought life itself. I think"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"comets brought the materials that can lead to life.I will point out one thing that is positive in your question is that the earliest life we knowabout on the Earth we think happened around 900 million years after the formation of theplanets. And that is suspiciously around the same time where what we call the Late HeavyBombardment – looks like the final, huge number of comets and asteroids coming in andpummeling the Earth and the moon, creating a huge number of craters that we still see onthe moon today.This would argue that if life formed about this time and comets were bombarding the Earthabout that time, that comets did have something to do with it (evolution of life).It cancertainly be interpreted as comets brought the feedstocks, if you will, the 'Purina life chow'to the Earth. Then there might have been a bit of bacteria or simple little piece of proto lifethat was forming and suddenly it had this very rich environment and took off from thereonce there was the very rich soup of material brought by comets.COULD YOU DETAIL MORE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DEEP IMPACT ANDSTARDUST DATA-GATHERING?Stardust has the wonderful capability of having about 10 micrograms of cometary materialin the lab. It can be tested and poked and prodded and probed with the most advancedcompositional and physical techniques we have today to try to understand the structureand chemistry and what we call petrology, the actual formative minerals and what madeup the dust that was around that comet, Wild 2? What was emitted from the comet?There are some problems, or details, they have to worry about in that when they capturedtheir Stardust dust, they captured it into what’s called aerogel, which is a very light, veryfluffy, almost jello-like material made up of silica. Silicate is made of silica and oxygen,similar to the rock-forming elements we’ve been talking about.Stardust captured the material at about 6 to 7 kilometers per second. It has to decelerate ina millimeter or two. And that is a very quick deceleration in a very shot distance. So, thedust gets heated up a bit, actually quite a lot. I’m not clear exactly how many hundreds ofthousands of degrees.The details of exactly what happens to the dust when it is heated up after it is captured arestill being understood. The understanding is actually on the job. They have many particlesthey can work with, which is good. But it’s going to take them time to figure out exactlythe details.What they have been looking at most of all are what are called ‘terminal particles.’ Theparticles are pretty small. For example, in Deep Impact, we basically saw particlesbetweenpoint-1 and a few microns in size from our ejecta from deep inside the comet.Stardust is finding that the vast majority of those size particles are severely altered whenthey are captured in the aerogel. They are small enough that they get heated a lot, changeda lot.The really big particles, the ones that are 10 microns and larger. Just to give you an idea,your hair is probably like mine – thin Caucasian hair about 1 to 3 microns thick. The 10microns or larger particles were so big that only their outer rims got affected at all. The restof them survived very well.Don Brownlee (Stardust Director) calls these “almost rocks or boulders.” What they aredoing with their first preliminary analysis is they are looking at the composition of these“boulders.”The small dark ring in aerogel slice might be the firstpieces of matter ever captured from outside our Solar System.Image by Stardust@Home, Space Science Lab, UC-Berkeley and NASA.[ Editor's Note: You can help scientists look for interstellar dust on aerogelslices gathered in 2004 from Comet Wild 2 by joining an interactivemicroscope program Stardust@Home. ]They are seeing very simple olivines, pyroxenes and metal sulfides. They are able to dolots of studies on these rocks and boulders and they are inferring from that to their generaloverall data, their total findings. That’s a little worrisome."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"With Deep Impact, we didn’t have any material in the lab (on Earth). We can’t do any ofthis direct analysis. We can’t use x-ray microprobes or any sort of time-of-flight massspectrometry, or anything like that.But what we have is not 10 micrograms. We have literally ten to the 15th times morematerial. We have 10 to the 9th grams of ejecta came out of our comet (Comet Tempel I).So, rather than the total equivalent of maybe one 30-micron interplanetary dust particle,we’ve got something the size of a small avalanche came out of the comet.The problem is that we didn’t have it in front of us in the lab. It was three-quarter's of thedistance between the Earth and the sun away from us when we looked at Comet Tempel I.All we could do is use what is called ‘remote sensing.’ So, what that means is that we havea spectra from Spitzer and this spectra has bumps and wiggles and we can try to infer fromit. We’ve done a very good job, we think, of trying to fit this spectrum and try tounderstand what’s in it.But, as the Stardust folks rightly point out, we have what is called a ‘uniqueness problem.’We can tell you generally there is so much olivine and so much pyroxene and so muchmetal sulfide and so much carbonates. And we can tell you that it all fits the spectra verynicely. But without the material in our hand in the lab able to probe it and test it and figureout exactly what it is, we have the problem that it’s possible that someone could come upwith a somewhat different recipe (for comet components) and identify and fit that spectraas well.I don’t think this is very likely because I’ve put a lot of work into it. But I do have to beopen-minded and the truth of the matter is there could be a different recipe in the twocomets. And this is the issue. We were hoping to see an exact agreement between Stardustand Deep Impact and we don’t have that exact agreement right now. Maybe Comets Are Not the SameIn Composition and AgeWHY COULDN’T COMETS BE DIFFERENT?The answer is that they could be. What you’re hearing from me is that’s a simple answerand you could be exactly right. And let me get to that in a second.But both Deep Impact and the Stardust teams would like to have the comets be a HolyGrail, or be representative of the proto solar nebulae so that we can dig right into them. Wewere hoping to say here’s what’s in the comets: here are your dinosaur bones of solarsystem formation. Here’s your answers. We may be finding as you are suggesting that it’smore complicated than that.We have one comet that was made, oh, let’s say, out by Uranus. And another comet thatwas made out by Pluto way past Neptune. And one was made a few million years after thesun turned on. And the other was waiting for 10 million years to get made. They are goingto look very different. In fact, to answer your question, the more we look at Wild 2 andwe look at Tempel I – to our eyes, the Deep Impact eyes – Wild 2 looks very young, veryunprocessed. It looks like it was a comet from early on in the solar system and the Stardustresults seems to be saying it has a very simple composition. It only has magnesium-richsilicates and the pyroxenes are calcium and iron and magnesium rich, but they also looksimple.In Deep Impact, our dust is looking more complicated – like there is a lot more iron-richolivine. The clays and these carbonates look like water processing of the olivine andpyroxene.Translation: Maybe Tempel I is actually made of material that had been baked and boiledand processed around the sun more and maybe spent more time in the proto solar nebulabefore it was incorporated into a comet. This is making sense for the compositionaldifferences. It also makes sense when you look at the bodies. Tempel I really shows allkinds of different layers. It shows etching into the layers. It shows flows. It shows impactcraters. It looks like it’s a very complicated surface that we are still trying to understand.So, to answer your question: it’s very possible that there are big differences due toformation and evolution of these two bodies. We may still be learning that.AND THAT AGE OF COMETS MIGHT BE ONE OF THE BIGGESTCHARACTERISTICS OR FACTS TO CONSIDER WHEN YOU ARE COMPARINGDATA?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"I am now 44-years-old. I have been doing comets only since the early 1990s. That’s fifteenyears I’ve been studying comets. We rally are in our infancy. If you think about it, withDeep Impact and Stardust, we’ve only managed to start looking at the surfaces and barelysampling two comets for material in the last few years.It wasn’t until 1950 – only fifty years ago – that we really began thinking about comets notas flying sandbags but as coherent bodies, icy snowballs – icy dirt balls, I should call themnow to be correct, because it looks like they’ve got as much or more dirt and rocks onthem as ices. It wasn’t until then 50 years ago that we started thinking about them in theproper terms. And it’s only in the last ten years that we’ve really started sampling them.Fifty years from now, we might have another big paradigm shift and we’re going to lookback on this and answer your question just like you think the answer is, which is, ‘Oh,yeah, once you start looking at ten, twenty, thirty comets up close and you get coresamples from them and you look at them in the lab, you’re going to see that they weren’tall made at once. They didn’t just all form immediately once the proto solar nebulacollapsed. But some of them were formed early. Some of them were formed late. Some ofthem might have been heated when it came near a very young Jupiter, which could havebeen hot.Others stayed forever out in the Kuiper Belt and were always cold and never had anychanges at all. That’s a very likely possibility. We just can’t say anything about it nowbecause we don’t know that much. Water from Comets andAmino Acids from MeteoritesWHAT’S YOUR OWN GUT FEELING ABOUT WHETHER COMETS ARE GOING TOTURN OUT TO BE WHAT BROUGHT SOME DNA LIFE HERE?My gut thinking is that I do not think comets in and of themselves brought DNA. I thinkcomets brought the basic feedstocks and my training as a chemist is that liquid water is anincredibly fascinating and powerful medium for making reactions happen. You cannotunderestimate the fact that with water life can happen so much easier.It is fascinating I think and should not be understated that there are amino acids inmeteorites. Amino acids have been found in the residues of meteorites such as the famousAllende meteorite.[ Editor’s Note: Allende Carbonaceous Chondrite Meteorite A fragment of the Allende carbonaceous chondrite meteorite.Source: The Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, Astronomy and Spaceflight.A meteorite of the type known as a carbonaceous chondrite, which fell nearthe village of Pueblito de Allende, in the Mexican state of Chihuahua, onFebruary 8, 1969. Several tons of material were scattered over an areameasuring 48 kilometers (30 miles) by 7 kilometers (4.3 miles).Specimens of the meteorite were found to contain a fine-grained carbon-richmatrix studded with many chondrules, both matrix and chondrules consistingpredominantly of the mineral olivine."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"A thin section of the Allende meteorite showinga carbon-rich matrix around the chondrules. Source: The Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, Astronomy and Spaceflight.AAS Encyclopedia: \"Close examination of the chondrules, by a team fromCase Western Reserve University, revealed tiny black markings, up to 10trillion per square centimeter, which were absent from the matrix andinterpreted as evidence of radiation damage. Similar structures have turned upin lunar basalt, but not in their terrestrial equivalent, which would have beenscreened from cosmic radiation by the Earth's atmosphere and geomagneticfield. Irradiation of the chondrules, it seems, happened after they hadsolidified but before the cold accretion of matter that took place during theearly stages of formation of the solar system, when the parent meteorite cametogether.The Allende meteorite also contains fine-grained, microscopic diamonds withstrange isotopic signatures that point to an extrasolar origin; these interstellargrains are older than the Solar System and probably the product of a nearbysupernova.\" ]The fact that amino acids are in meteorites is very interesting. But now, remember that ameteorite, which we think comes from an asteroid, is a body that has undergone meltingand been baked and boiled compared to a comet. A comet is a very primitive body, whichis much more like a simple selection of the dust and gas that was originally between thestars and that fell together to form our very young proto solar nebula and fell into the sunand made the sun.IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT THE COMETS BROUGHT THE WATER AND THEMETEORITES MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT THE DNA?I don’t think there is any evidence for DNA. I want to be very strong about that. But it’spossible they might have brought the amino acids.THAT WOULD END UP EVOLVING INTO DNA?If you can make amino acids and precursors in asteroids, why can’t you do it on theEarth’s surface as well? In other words, in the process of melting a comet and slammingbodies into each other and reforming them in order to make the asteroids, why can’t youdo the same thing on the Earth itself. You should be able to once it’s cool enough.We are looking with our modern techniques and it seems like we are seeing a rate ofplanetary formation around stars in the order of 5% to 10%. So, there’s maybe as many as10 billion planets in our Milky Way galaxy. That’s a lot of planets!It could be that making life, finding an Earth and making a body that has oxygen and wateron it really is an incredibly rare event. Then out of 10 billion planets, it only has to happena few times. But we would not be having this conversation if it did not happen, right?RIGHT.That’s the anthropomorphic principal. If life had not happened, we would not be discussingit. So, it’s a chicken and egg problem. It had to happen for you and I to be having thisconversation, to be alive here today. We’re an existence proof that life can happen.I’m often asked if there is life or something out there in the galaxy, my answer is that thereare 10 billion planets in this galaxy. It happened here (on Earth). I think it has to havehappened somewhere else. The problem is that it could have happened hundreds oflight-years away, so the neighbors are very far away and hard to talk to. There is no suchthing as a warp drive as far as we know in physics today. So, there may be life out there.I’m pretty sure there is. I think Jodie Foster said in Contact, ‘It would be a terrible wasteof space.’ But it could be it’s very hard for us to find it. Or if we do find evidence of it, it’sgoing to be very hard to communicate with because communication has to move at the"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"speed of light. Where Did All of Earth's Water Come From?IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT ALL OF THE WATER OF EARTH CAME ONLYFROM COMETS?My current understanding is that there is no evidence. In fact, there is evidence to thecontrary. It looks like there is an upper limit on the amount of water that could have comefrom comets. By studying the amount of deuterium, which is heavy water.The amount of deuterium in comets – and deuterium is a hydrogen atom that has an extraneutron in it, so it’s called heavy hydrogen. When we compare what we saw in cometssuch as Hyakutake and Hale-Bopp with what we see in our oceans, a fellow named RowenMeyer showed a few years back that comets have a lot more deuterium in their water thanis in the Earth’s oceans.Comet Hale-Bopp, April 1997. Image © by Alessandro Dimaiat Col Druscie Observatory, Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.So some Earth water could have come by comets, but if you had to match the deuterium tohydrogen ratio that we see in the Earth’s oceans, you have an upper limit in which onlyabout 30 to 40 percent of our planet's ocean water could come from comets.This is a fascinating result from looking at three of the bright comets in the last twentyyears (Haley, Hyakutake and Hale-Bopp) . One problem with this analysis is that Rowenwas looking at deep comets, or what we call Oort Cloud comets. They come from a giantsphere around our solar system and they are not the comets that we think did most of thebombardment during the Late Heavy Bombardment, which are the Jupiter family comets.Solar system is where the two lines come together near the center of the Oort Cloudgraphic, emphasizing how much greater the icy comet-making region is beyond planets.The Kuiper Belt, another comet-making region, is closer to the planets.Those are comets that are found in a disc around our solar system and they are derivedfrom the Kuiper Belt objects. They are bodies that performed at the edges of our solar"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"system and are like Wild 2 or Tempel I. There might be a difference in the deuterium tohydrogen ratio.No one has ever measured the D/H radio in a Jupiter family comet. The Rosetta missionwill do this for the first time. So, that number of 30 to 40% is provisional for now. It mightbe a very good number. It’s the best number we have today.WHERE DID ALL THE REST OF THE WATER COME FROM?OK, rocks have intrinsic water built into them. If you were to pick up a random rockoutside and took it home and put it in your fireplace and heat the rock up, you would seevapor coming off of it. It’s almost like seeing steam come up from a sauna. Rocks havewhat is called water hydration. They have chemical water bound into them, which can beremoved from them upon heating.So, when the Earth was a red lava ball, it was so hot to begin with that nothing could laston its surface and it boils off all the water and organic things and a lot of it does getdestroyed and goes back into the atmosphere and back into the proto solar nebula.But as it cools, eventually it cools enough that water is coming from the rocks in theinterior. There is water in lava today. There’s actually a lot of water. We see this. So weknow there’s water inside the rocks inside the Earth. That water could have come bubblingup from the inside of the Earth and remained stable on the Earth’s surface.\" Summary of Deep Impact Data So Far(Stardust Data to Be Published in 2007)No ammonia, methane or formic acid.Confirmed and Maybe Substances:1) Amorphous Carbon - Similar to glassy carbon, not crystallized graphite.2) Crystalline Silicates - Such as olivines (like greenish peridots/fosterite)3) Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN)4 ) Methyl Cyanide5 ) Methanol6 ) Carbon Monoxide, CO - Maybe?7 ) Carbon Dioxide, CO28 ) Wa t e r (Tempel I is about 40% to 50% water ice)9 ) Ethane (Hydrocarbon consists of two carbons and six hydrogens;non-soluble in water. It is the simplest hydrocarbon containing more than onecarbon atom.)10 ) Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs.11 ) Carbonates (Iron and magnesium carbonates, not calcium/limestone. )12) Clays - Rock mixed with acid or water (such as Smectite).More Information:For further information about Deep Impact, Stardust and other comet research, please seethe Earthfiles Archives:• 08/12/2005 -- Deep Impact Spectra: Carbonate, PAHs and Some Amino Precursors in Comet Tempel I• 07/10/2005 -- First Data from Deep Impact Crash Into Comet Tempel I• 06/29/2005 -- July 3-4, 2005: NASA \"Deep Impact\" Spacecraft to Blast Hole in Comet Temple I• 01/13/2005 -- NASA \"Deep Space\" Craft Will Hit Comet On July 4, 2005• 06/25/2004 -- Wild 2, An Amazing Comet - Stardust Mission• 08/19/2006 -- Red Rain Cells of Kerala, India - Still No Definite DNA• 09/16/2005 -- \"Planet X\" and the Kuiper Belt's Oddballs, \"Santa\" and \"Easterbunny\"• 08/12/2005 -- Deep Impact Spectra: Carbonate, PAHs and Some Amino Precursors in Comet Tempel I• 07/10/2005 -- First Data from Deep Impact Crash Into Comet Tempel I• 06/29/2005 -- July 3-4, 2005: NASA \"Deep Impact\" Spacecraft to Blast Hole in Comet Temple I• 05/06/2005 -- What Are The Straight Lines on Saturn's Titan Moon?• 04/20/2005 -- Outer Space Impact At Serpent Mound, Ohio, 256 Million Years Ago• 04/01/2005 -- What's Killing Off Marine Life Every 62 Million Years?• 02/17/2005 -- Iapetus and Enceladus: Baffling Moons of Saturn• 01/13/2005 -- NASA \"Deep Space\" Craft Will Hit Comet On July 4, 2005• 12/17/2004 -- Is Our Solar System's Red, Mysterious Sedna An Alien Planetoid?• 11/17/2004 -- European Space Agency's SMART-1 Satellite Begins Moon Orbit• 09/20/2004 -- Part 1: Martian Water Vapor and Methane Overlap in Equatorial Regions• 06/25/2004 -- Wild 2, An Amazing Comet• 03/31/2004 -- Methane on Mars - Biology?
