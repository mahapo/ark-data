It was radiating light and this was done to disguise his true scaly,reptilian appearance.\" - Jim Sparks, Author, The Keepers © 2006 December 14, 2006 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Between 1988, when Jim Sparks was34-years-old, and the spring of 1995, when Jim was 42-years-old, he felt like he graduatedto yet another level in his relationship with non-human beings. He had been given thecompletely conscious task of helping to calm dozens of human men and women brought toan outdoor location for an apparent multiple human abduction. The grey beings were nolonger paralyzing Jim and he could consciously walk around and help people at theabduction site before transport to several aerial discs and inside those craft. Sparks felt amixture of pride about the new alien trust in him, while at the same time he felt guilty thathe was helping the aliens to control his fellow humans.After that, Jim Sparks had an abduction experience that changed him forever, he says, andleft him obsessed with saving the rain forests and stopping the human slash and burn byfire that is destroying them. This experience, excerpted here from my book Glimpses ofOther Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness © 1998, is puzzling because yet anothernon-human type comes into Jim's life. These tall, reptilian entities also provoke questionsabout a possible connection to viper references in Enoch of the Dead Sea Scrolls and theBook of Genesis in the Bible.\"There is a predestination doctrine known as the Two Spirit Theology,in which one's soul is said to be fated for all eternity, blessed or cursed as the resultof a kind of angelic wrestling match between two of the 'Watcher' spirits: ...a Good Angel and an Evil Angel, who struggle for possession of your soul...\" - Comment by David Flusser, Israeli Biblical Scholar, Dead Sea Scrolls.The Testament of Amram, Dead Sea Scrolls, translated by Prof. Robert Eisenman: \"I saw Watchers in my vision, the dream-vision. Two men were fighting overme ... holding a great contest over me. I asked them, 'Who are you, that youare thus empowered over me?' They answered, 'We have been empoweredand rule over all mankind.' They said to me, 'Which of us do you choose torule you?'\"I raised my eyes and looked. One of them was terrifying in his appearance,like a serpent, his cloak, many-colored yet very dark. ...And I looked again,and in his appearance, his visage like a viper. ...I replied to him, 'This Watcher,who is he?' He answered, 'This Watcher ... his three names are Belial andPrince of Darkness and King of Evil.'\"I said (to the other Watcher), 'My lord, what dominion (have you?)' Heanswered, 'You saw (the viper), and he is empowered over all Darkness, whileI (am empowered over all Light.) ... My three names are Michael, Prince ofLight and King of Righteousness.'\" Jim Sparks Encounter with Reptilian Humanoids,Their Warning and Possible AgendaJim Sparks: \"The pulling (abduction) started the usual way with a low-pitched whirlingsound, only this time it didn't speed up as fast or get as loud and it was more gentle. I wasparalyzed again, but I momentarily regained consciousness before the final transport"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"sequence was complete and I could see where I was going. That was a first!\"As my eyes opened, I saw that I was at least a thousand feet above the ground and slowlydescending. Below me was an abandoned carnival park. I was floating over a large,old-fashioned wooden roller coaster and I wasn't scared! I was calm and relaxed and theride was so gentle I was actually enjoying it.Aerial view of a dozen non-human creatures in abandoned carnival park from Jim Sparks'smemory of what he remembered consciously as he descended through the air toward the beingsduring a March 1995 abduction.

Then I saw the profiles of about a dozen large creatures standing in asemi-circle. Although it was night, I could make out the shapes of their body size and theywere large, even by human standards. A few inches from the ground, I blacked out.\"As I began to regain consciousness, I was standing and heard telepathically loud andclear:'We would have given it to you, but we knew it wouldn't have meant anythingunless you earned it. It was the only way you could possibly understand whatyou have been a part of and what you have to do.' (I now know the 'it' wasknowledge.)\"I was clearheaded and wide-awake conscious. There were twelve large, humanoidcreatures standing in almost a complete circle in which I was a part. The creaturesappeared to be at least six feet tall. All of them had their heads turned towards the alienwho was standing to my immediate left.Jim Sparks's depiction of the holographic human face superimposed over the largereptoid's head.

The creatures didn't take into consideration that as this holographic facespoke and moved its lips, there was no audible sound.Glass reproduction of Earth reptile eye with vertical pupil.Image by Van Dyke's Taxidermy.\"The voice being communicated telepathically was out of sync with the lips! Plus, the facewas obviously a hologram because it was slightly off center from the body. But it workednonetheless because I wasn't scared.\"As the reptoids transmitted telepathically, I noticed that each alien seemed to beconcentrating its thoughts to the creature on my left. One thing for sure, they were of onemind, and it said:'There are some things you need to understand. Yes, it's true that we havebeen in contact with your government leaders and heads of power. It is alsotrue that agreements have been made and kept secret from your people. It isalso true that in the past, some of your people have lost their lives or havebeen badly hurt to protect this secret. Our hands had no part in this.'We contacted your leaders because your planet is in grave trouble. Yourleaders said the vast majority of your population wasn't ready for anythinglike us yet, so we made time agreements with your leaders as to when yourpeople would be made aware of our presence. This part of the agreement hasnot at all been kept.'It was also agreed that in the meantime, steps would be taken to correct theenvironmental condition of your planet with our advice and technology. Wesay advice because we respect the fact that this is your planet, not ours. Yourgovernment also broke this agreement.'\"I felt an awful emotion of abandonment from these aliens. They are different. I neversensed true emotion from the other grey aliens before. But the feeling from these reptilianbeings was not at all good. It felt like great loss. I couldn't help asking, 'You aren't giving upon us, are you?''There was a long pause of silence and I had a strong feeling of tremendous loss. So I askedagain, 'Well, are you?' There was another long pause. Then finally:'No, We are now concentrating our energy on the average person. Your air,your water, are contaminated. Your forests, jungles, trees and plant life aredying. There are several breaks in your food chain. You have anoverwhelming amount of nuclear and biological weapons which includenuclear and biological contamination. Your planet is over-populated.' Wa r ni n g : It is almost to the point of being too late unless your people actnow. There are better ways to derive your energy and food needs withoutcausing your planet any damage.'Those in power are aware of this and have the capability to put thesemethods into worldwide use.'\"I asked, 'Why aren't we doing it now?' There was silence and the whole thing was sostrange because I could see that the whole group was thinking and speaking its mind at onetime. It felt good because I was a participant in an honest to goodness meeting! The best"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"part was that for the first time I was getting direct answers to my questions. 'Why aren't weputting these new methods into use now?''Those in power view it (technology for clean energy and abundant food) as amilitary and security threat.'\"Then I got angry as hell and said, 'You mean to tell me our people in power have theability to save and better this planet and they aren't doing it?!' The thought that technologywas being held back from the public because of paranoia and greed outraged me and thealiens saw my anger. But was it true?'Amnesty'\"I asked, 'What do you mean?''Complete amnesty. To those in power, the governments and the leaders whohave been suppressing the truth. They can't be held liable for any past wrongdeeds. It is the only way these leaders can come forward with the truth. It isnecessary that you do this in order to work together and survive.'\"There was silence for awhile as if they wanted me to think about what was just said. Thiswas a hard truth to swallow. If anybody had a good reason to hate their government forcovering up this information, it was me and others like me. Most abductees still considerthemselves victims who constantly suffer ridicule. When your own government's policy isto say, 'You're just plain crazy,' it only deepens the pain.\"But this is a time when intelligence should rule over emotions. So, I asked, 'How do I fitinto all this? What can I possibly do?''What you are doing already. We will share much more knowledge with you inthe future. Although you understand a lot, we will show you much more.Continue to work with people that come to you.We are aware of the smallgroups that are forming around the world. These are people who areprepared to learn and we consider them the core. Most important is thecondition of your planet. The first step in solving this serious problem isamnesty.We have advice. You will receive more knowledge in the nearfuture.'\"As this was going on, it started to rain. I mean it was pouring! The creatures didn't evenbudge or try to get out from under it. They didn't have to - we weren't getting wet.Although we were standing completely outdoors with no roof, not one drop of raintouched us. I guess we were being protected by some sort of electric field. I could heardrops as they fell, but there was a clear detectable line (around us) between rainfall and norainfall. Then they said,'It's time to go.'\"A thought flashed into my mind. 'Wait, please! I have a request. I want to see what youlook like.' I'll never forget their response as long as I live.'It will strike fear in your heart.'\"I answered, 'It won't scare me so much if you don't stand there and stare at me. It wouldhelp if you would just wave at me. Just don't stare. Promise me you'll wave.'\"Now, I can't believe how stupid that request was. I had in the flesh, face-to-face,probably some of the most intelligent creatures from the far reaches of the galaxy withanswers that have been plaguing mankind since the dawn of time. And what did I say?'Could you wave at me?'\"The strangest thing started to take place. A spinning white light with a hint of green beganto radiate over their faces and upper bodies, all dozen of them. The intensity of the lightslowly got brighter and it was radiating from no direct or detectable source. I could seethey were huge. Their upper torso was strong with huge shoulders and a thick, strong necklike football linebackers. As the light became brighter and details clearer, fear and shockzapped through me.\"I said, 'You have scales!' Their faces looked like a cross between a lizard and a snake -nothing at all like the little grey guys.\"Their eyes were small like ours, only diamond-shaped and the pupils were a red color.Their heads were in normal proportion with their bodies, but bigger than ours. The skulllooked like their brains stuck out over their foreheads covered by skin. This feature wasslightly different among all dozen of them."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"\"I said in a scared whimper, 'You promised to wave.' And each and every one of themslowly lifted their arms and waved in front of their faces. Their hands were huge withthick, club-like fingers too thick to work fine instruments. But you have to keep in mindthat their technology is thought-activated.\"I stood there and stared at them for awhile in silence, absorbing this spectacular sight.Their message kept running through my mind. I was sure that my country has beeninvolved with aliens. Most Americans believe there's been a cover-up. But what really gotto me was the message about the poor condition of our planet! Then I felt the accelerationpull and blacked out.\"I understood better their nature and agenda. They are neither benevolent nor evil. Theyhave been among us in secret for thousands of years, maybe longer. But the length of timeisn't as much the issue as why they have been among us. I believe they have been farmingus for raw materials.\"We humans have been a self-perpetuating crop, a crop that doesn't need much tendingand continues to reproduce, at least up to now and all the earth problems. Thank goodness,they don't kill us. They just use us. this system has worked well for the aliens for a longtime. But now there's a problem and their investment is in trouble. They have spent a lot oftime, travel and effort to farm us. But we are on an almost irreversible path ofself-destruction. Nuclear and biological weapons and their waste have polluted the air,land and water. Forests, jungles and trees are being cut down or are dying. Now there arebreakdowns in the food chain and the rest of the food chain is contaminant ed.Over-population, disease and viruses beyond our grasp with new and more complicatedillnesses crop up every day. These are just a few of the problems we humans have created.\"Most of us are blind or numb to this reality because we can still go to the grocer and buyfood. We can go to work and back and not see this death and dying. All seems almostnormal. But if we environmentally destroy ourselves, the aliens still have an excellentinsurance policy. They've been collecting seeds from plants, animals and humans. Throughsemen and ova extraction, the aliens can start us, or other earth life, all over again here, orsomewhere else.\"More Information:Jim Sparks with his dog, Tucker,when he lived in, Ft.
