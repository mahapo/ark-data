Me, the baby, has already been delivered. They found me out in ahallway wrapped up in a towel. One testicle was missing.\" - R.D.March 2, 2006 Northern California - Fifty-eight years ago, the date July 2, 1947, wastwo days before the alleged crashes of three extraterrestrial aerial craft in the Roswell andWhite Sands Proving Ground region of New Mexico. That night of July 2nd, in Casper,Wyoming, a baby boy was born after 35 minutes of missing time, later linked to anabduction of the unborn child by a non-human entity that had orange eyes. Over the pastfifty-eight years, that child, “R.D.,” grew into adulthood, haunted by strange memories andthe panicked confusion his mother described at the time he was born. His official birthcertificate says R.D. was delivered in the public hospital in Casper. Yet, his mother wasdefinite that she was in a military hospital that seemed nearly empty while she was inlabor. On July 2, 1947, RD was born in a Casper, Wyoming, hospital.His birth certificate names the public hospital. But his mothersaid she delivered in a Casper military hospital. His mother passed away some years ago, but the desire to understand what happenedwhen he was born kept RD reading and researching about people who have describedmissing time abductions by non-human entities. After hearing me speak on the radio about government cover-up of UFO crashes, retrievalsand back-engineering of extraterrestrial technologies, R.D. contacted me. He explainedthat he owns a farm supply company in northern California and is afraid to disclose hisidentity. He does not to hurt his business and family life. But he gave me permission tointerview him on audiotape for Earthfiles and Dreamland. He is curious if anyone else hasheard of, or experienced, a similar missing time near the moments of birth.

"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Here now is the only case of missing time before birth that I’ve ever encountered in myinvestigations of Real X-Files.Interview: \"RD,\" Owner, Farm Supply Company, Northern California: “A few minutes before Iwas born, the power went out. Everything turned black. No emergency power came on.The people tuned out. After the power came back on and everyone came back to theirsenses, I’m not there. Me, the baby, has already been delivered. They found me out in ahallway wrapped up in a towel. One testicle was missing. WAS THERE AN EXCISION IN THE SAC? Yes, they had to sew it back up. WAS THERE ANY BLOOD? No. WHAT I’VE HEARD YOU SAY IS THAT YOUR MOTHER WAS IN THE PROCESS OFLABOR... Right. ...AND YOU ARE NOT BORN YET. Right. ALL OF A SUDDEN THE POWER GOES OUT. THE LIGHTS GO OUT. AND IASSUME THIS IS TESTIMONY FROM YOUR MOTHER? This is testimony from my mother and second hand testimony from somebody else 30years later. BUT GOING BACK TO YOUR MOM WHO WAS THERE AND TRYING TO GIVEBIRTH, SHE REMEMBERS THAT THE POWER WENT OUT, EVERYTHING WENTDARK. IT’S NOT KNOWN FOR HOW LONG. IT’S NOT KNOWN WHAT HAPPENEDTO THE DOCTOR, YOUR MOTHER AND THE PEOPLE. BUT WHEN THE LIGHTSCOME ON, AT WHATEVER POINT OF TIME THAT IS – AND WE’RE ASSUMINGSOME SORT OF MISSING TIME AS A GROUP OF PEOPLE – YOU ARE BORN NOWON A TABLE IN THE HALL WITH ONE OF YOUR TESTICLES CUT OUT WITH ACLEAR EXCISION. Well, I won’t say it’s a clear incision. Let’s say it was surgically removed and my mothersaid there was no blood. They were checking me to see what had happened. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR TESTICLE BEING CUT OUT ANDUSING THE TERM ‘CLEAR EXCISION'? CLEAR EXCISION MEANS SOMETHINGHAS BEEN REMOVED THROUGH A CUT. They said that if they had done it or cut something off of me, it would have been differentand there would have been blood and an open wound. But it was pretty much - there wasno blood, nothing. And they just put a stitch or two on as a kind of preventative measure.Then they noticed there was a drop of blood in front of each ear. They had a small incisionthere, too, on the upper top right on the head where the ear connects itself. HOW BIG AN INCISION ABOVE EACH EAR?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I don’t know for sure, but she thought it was about a quarter-inch. WHAT YOU’VE DESCRIBED IS SO REMARKABLE THAT MOST PEOPLELISTENING WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME FOLLOWING WITHOUT SAYING,‘HOW COULD THIS BE?’ BUT WE KNOW IN THE WORLD OF THE HUMANABDUCTION SYNDROME, THAT ALL KINDS OF VERY BIZARRE THINGS HAVEHAPPENED IN WHICH PEOPLE REMEMBER BEING UP TO A CERTAIN SECONDAND THEN THEY THINK THAT THINGS CONTINUE THE NEXT SECOND. BUT INFACT, THERE CAN BE TWO HOURS MISSING OR FIVE DAYS OR WHATEVER. Right. She was in pain. She was in labor. Everything went black instantaneously. When thelights came back on, she was not in pain. She was not in labor. The doctors – I think therewas one doctor and two nurses – if I remember correctly, my mother told me there wasone male and two female and only three of them. They are acting extremely disoriented.They are looking around like they were just waking up or something. Then they got intokind of a panic and then she got into a panic and somebody went running out of the doorand came back about a minute later with me! So, they had no recollection or idea abouthow I was born or delivered. DID ANY ONE TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THIS AT THE TIME? No. But it gets stranger as we go on here, too. So that was some of the informationimparted to me by my mother. And by the way, the missing time was approximately 35minutes. The electric clock on the wall was off by 35 minutes. LET’S ASSUME IT’S MISSING TIME. YOU JUMP FROM THERE TO YOURTHIRTIES BEFORE ANY OF THIS COMES INTO PLAY AS AN ABDUCTIONEXPERIENCE WITH NON-HUMANS? I some times would have a dream and in this one dream scenario, I would see a creature,this face, and it was humanoid, but not human: no hair, grey, but very weathered-lookingwith lines around the mouth and the nostril area. The eyes were orange. ORANGE? Orange. COMPARE THAT COLOR TO SOMETHING I MIGHT KNOW. A ripe orange. VERY ORANGE. Very, very orange. HOW WOULD YOU COMPARE THE DETAILS OF THOSE EYES TO HUMAN EYES? They were bigger. And no whites. There was no iris, but there was a difference in the verycenter which might have been a pupil. It was still orange, but it was different – a little moreyellow. SO, A YELLOW CENTER, PERHAPS, IN A BRIGHT ORANGE EYE."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"A bright orange eye. And then out at the very edge, dark. Black instead of white. WAS THE CENTER PART THAT WAS YELLOW VERTICAL LIKE A SNAKE’S? ORWAS IT ROUND LIKE A HUMAN’S? It wasn’t distinctly like we have a hole in the center. It was not like that. It was more justlike an area there a lot less intense in the coloring and it was a little different in theconfiguration. THE COLOR OF THE SKIN? Sort of brownish-grey. BROWNISH GREY. CAN YOU THINK OF ANYTHING I MIGHT KNOW THATWOULD BE THAT SAME COLOR? Like a dark russet potato. I got the feeling of age. Russet potatoes. WAS THERE A MOUTH? Oh, yes. Small lips. SO, HOW DOES THIS LINK TO THE 35-MINUTE-MISSING TIME ON JULY 2, 1947? What I saw at my own birth time and my own recollection of what happened when I wasborn is all of a sudden, I’m aware of light. That’s the first thing I’m aware of. Then thesecond thing I’m aware of is bright light. I didn’t see any doctors. I didn’t see my mother.Then the second thing I was aware of is the face I described to you. But I saw other faces,too. OF? The other faces were alien also, but they were more of what I call the standard gardenvariety grey, which is black eyes. Within my vision, they are in very close proximity toeach other, physically close. Even though in my memory I don’t hear anything verbal,there is some kind of interaction going on between them and I was either being held, or ina container that was being held, by the smaller grey entities. They entered into some kindof communication, if you want to put it that way, with the entity with the orange eyes. Atthat point, I did not see the other entities any longer. TELEPATHICALLY – EVEN THOUGH YOU WERE A NEWBORN BABY – DO YOU"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"REMEMBER ANY EXCHANGE OF TELEPATHIC THOUGHTS? Yes, that’s where this gets very interesting and I think why it bugged me for the rest of mylife. I could feel a sense of urgency. There was no vocalization and I didn’t know wordsanyway. But there was this feeling of urgency and maybe beyond urgency, concernbetween the various entities and this one orange-eyed entity. When they handed me tohim, I had this feeling that I was definitely being communicated with in my memory of theevent. But it’s more like, for lack of a better term, he was trying to do something to me inmy mind - call it programming, maybe. I don’t know. I was somehow rejecting it. This is why the level of concern by the entities because itwasn’t taking. I can remember that it’s hard for me to figure out what the time involved onthat was, but I would say it was definitely in the minutes that after whatever repeatedinteraction was going on between me and the orange-eyed being, it just ended abruptly. Iwas given back to the other creatures, the little greys. Then I had a feeling of physical painand then I went to sleep. I woke up when I was being carried by a human and assume it was the hospital orderlythat picked me up from the hallway outside the delivery room. And then I saw my mother. THIS IS AFTER THE 35 MINUTES OF MISSING TIME WHEN THE POWER WENTOFF AND EVERYTHING WENT DARK AND NOBODY KNOWS EXACTLY WHATHAPPENED? That’s right. IN THE 58 YEARS SINCE THE VERY BIZARRE TRAUMATIC BIRTH THAT MIGHTBE LINKED TO AN ABDUCTION RIGHT BEFORE BIRTH FOR SOME KIND OFPROGRAMMING IN WHICH YOU RESISTED IT. YOU STILL END UP WITH ONEOF YOUR TESTICLES REMOVED AND TWO CUTS ABOVE EITHER EAR. FOR PEOPLE LISTENING, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE YOUR FELLOW HUMANSTO LEARN FROM THIS EXPERIENCE BASED ON WHERE YOU ARE AT58-YEARS-OLD IN YOUR THINKING ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND WHATHAS OCCURRED IN YOUR LIFE? That’s a good question. I think that what this points out that we’re not in control ofeverything to the extend that we think we are, as soul masters of our own destiny on thisplanet as humans. I really don’t like the fact that they took an organ that is capable ofproducing a lot of DNA for them (testicle) for genetic purposes. IN YOUR LIFE, IN DREAMS OR TELEPATHY OR ANY OTHER METHOD, HAVEYOU EVER RECEIVED ANY INSIGHT ABOUT WHY THE ORANGE-EYED BEINGAND THE SMALLER GREYS TOOK YOU AT BIRTH AND WHY THEY TOOK YOURTESTICLE? Intuitively, yes. I perceived a definite feeling of hostility. That was the last emotion I feltfrom the individual with the orange eyes. HOSTILITY TOWARDS YOU? Hostility towards me. Looking at it as an adult, it was like, ‘How dare you resist me andnot go along with this?’ And so, what was their intent? What are they doing? I don’t know.Maybe they are looking for a Manchurian candidate? I don’t know. Are they just looking"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"at having some kind of genetic experiment? I don’t know. But they are definitely doingsomething and it’s not random. Obviously, it’s going to have planning and forethought andthere is a program at work here. WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT PROGRAM MIGHT BE? I have no idea, except I’m not so sure it’s good for us. I’ve never had a good, positivefeeling about these creatures or beings. The creature I’m talking about with the orangeeyes is on the other side (against good beings). HE’S THE ONE WHO WAS HOSTILE TO YOU WHEN YOU WERE A BABY. Right. They don’t want to reveal themselves because they would possibly screw up theiragenda which is manipulative, underhanded, devious and is out to do us no good andwould like to deprive us of our free will. WHAT IS THEIR GOAL? Subjugation. OF THE SURFACE LIFE OF THE EARTH? Subjugation of humanity, whether it’s just on this planet – if this is one of many, I don’tknow. But subjugation of the human race as we know it. It’s their needs and I don’t knowwhat they are. IF YOU EXPERIENCED IN REALITY AN EFFORT TO PROGRAM YOU AS ANEWBORN ABOUT TO BE BORN, NOT YET BORN, BY THE ORANGE-EYEDCREATURE AND YOU RESISTED? HOW MANY BABIES ON THIS PLANET NOWOF 6.5 BILLION MIGHT BE PROGRAMMED BY THE ORANGE-EYED ENTITIES? That’s something I’ve wondered about many times and I don’t know. But I have thedistinct feeling that it’s more than a few. HOW WOULD ANY OF US KNOW? I don’t know. I really don’t know. IF THAT IS THE TRUE CONDITION OF THE EARTH TODAY, THEN THERE AREGEOPOLITICAL DIVISIONS THAT MIGHT ALL LOOK LIKE HUMANS, BUT SOMEARE PROGRAMMED BY SOMETHING ELSE? They are humans who have been altered or affected. THAT’S WHAT I MEAN – PROGRAMMED. The Manchurian candidate idea. WHAT WOULD PROGRAMMED HUMANS - PROGRAMMED BY THEORANGE-EYED BEING - BE UP TO? Right. But my feeling is they were running out of time to achieve their goals. So, theyramped up their programs and efforts. I WONDER WHY THERE WOULD BE A TIME LIMIT? I don’t know."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"I’VE RUN INTO THAT ISSUE BEFORE WITH PEOPLE IN THE HUMANABDUCTION SYNDROME. PEOPLE HAVE A SENSE THAT THE BEINGS THAT AREDEALING WITH THEM ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME, THERE IS GREATURGENCY, THAT WE WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND AS A SPECIES WHAT’SHAPPENING. PROBABLY THE OTHER COMMON DENOMINATOR IS THATPEOPLE IN THE HUMAN ABDUCTION SYNDROME DO NOT TRUST THEMOTIVES OF THE BEINGS THAT HAVE DEALT WITH THEM. Those are my feelings, at least of that particular class of beings. But I don’t think they arethe only beings out there. In fact, I know there are other beings out there who are notunder-handed and not manipulative. THE FACT THAT YOU HAD SOME KIND OF INSTINCTIVE RESISTANCE ANDTHERE MIGHT BE A MAJORITY OF HUMANS THAT HAVE AN INSTINCTIVERESISTANCE. THAT GOES TO THE QUESTION: WHICH PERCENTAGE DOES NOT,OR IS NOT ABLE TO RESIST, AND WHAT IS THAT PROGRAMMED PERCENTAGEDOING ON THE PLANET – ESPECIALLY IF THAT IS THE PERCENTAGE INP OSITIONS OF P OWER? That’s a very good question. I don’t know. I don’t know what percentage of them haveachieved their ends or goals. Now, this might seem very strange, but I have the distinctfeeling that there is interference, if you want to put it that way, being run against thisprogram (of the orange-eyed entity/ies), their agenda. A COUNTER MOVE AGAINST THE ORANGE-EYED ONE. Ye s . THEN WHO IS DOING THE COUNTERING? I have the feeling that some people might call them angels, some people might call themthe Nordics. I don’t know who you want to call them. I can’t unequivocally say I’veactually met them the same way I met this being who I really believe was physical and Idefinitely did meet. But I think they (the ones countering the orange-eyed entity) are promoting thedevelopment of humanity and they are on our side. I know that’s a rather simplisticoverview and they want us to succeed, but we have the ability to destroy ourselves.Without interference here, it’s maybe still a toss up. I don’t know. Or if not destroyourselves, at least wreak quite a bit of panic and damage against ourselves. I also have the feeling that things are going to get worse before they get better. A lot worseon a lot of different fronts. IF WE HAVE SOME NON-HUMANS OUT THERE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEENINVOLVED IN SEEDING LIFE ON THIS PLANET IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THEYHAVE MONITORED AND WATCHED AND CARE WHETHER OR NOT THECURRENT HUMANOID MODEL, HOMO SAPIENS, EVOLVES AND SURVIVES,WHY AT THIS CRITICAL TIME WITH ATOMIC WAR AROUND THE CORNERPERHAPS – WHY WOULDN’T THOSE NON-HUMANS MAKE THEMSELVESCLEARLY PUBLIC SO THAT IT WOULD SHIFT THE WORLD, WOULD SHIFTHUMAN MINDS, IN A SECOND? I don’t know. I think it has not so much to do with free will as it has to do with we have tocome to grips with our own ability to make decisions on our own.
