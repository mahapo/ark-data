May 17, 2006 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Twenty-three years ago, under orders of President RonaldReagan, American helicopters landed at Pearls Airport in northeastern Grenada at 5 o'clock in the morning onOctober 25, 1983. Fidel Castro’s Cuban People's Revolutionary Army fired at the U. S. Marines with smalla r ms a nd ma c hi ne guns .

The Marines and Rangers, backed by Navy ships, wouldprevail over the Cuban revolutionaries and their Soviet weapons. But even before the shooting began, theRangers had evacuated American students from the St. George's Medical Center who were later flown by ahuge C-141 transport plane back to the United States. The Grenada invasion by U. S. Army and Marines from October 23 to November 21, 1983, had allegedly beenrequested by six neighbor islands that were nervous. Government authorities on Antigua, Dominica, St. Lucia,St. Vincent, Jamaica and Barbados wanted President Ronald Reagan's help because Castro was building along runway on Grenada for military operations. U. S. officials were afraid that the nearly 10,000-foot-longairport would be big enough to land long-range Soviet bombers. From there, Castro and his Soviet allies couldwork into Central and South America. U. S. News & World Report said in its November 7, 1983, edition: \"Secrecy surrounding the operation wasalmost total. While congressional leaders were informed on the eve of the mission, they were not told when itwould be launched and were not asked to approve the mission. Not even the White House press office wasinformed. Reporters were not permitted to accompany U. S. forces to Grenada, and those already there werequickly ordered out. Journalists were allowed on the island only on the third day.\" A month later, the American invasion of Grenada was over on November 21, 1983. Official casualty totalswere 19 dead U. S. soldiers and 116 wounded; 29 dead Cuban soldiers; and 49 Grenada residents dead, alongwith several hundred wounded. Now I have a military source who says more was happening during that Grenada invasion than anyone knewthen - or now. There was a Top Secret UFO crash/retrieval covered up by the Top Secret invasion. Thelocation was in the northeast near the Pearls Airport. Dwayne Britnell - now 58-years-old - was drafted intothe U. S. Army in January 1969, where he worked for twenty-three years until his retirement on September 1st,1992. During the October 1983 Grenada invasion, Dwayne was a staff officer of the 1st Core SupportCommand (COSCOM) at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina, working in Security Operations Training and Intelligence.COSCOM was a 5,000-man unit that supported the 18th Airborne Corps and Ft. Bragg. When the secretinvasion began, Dwayne was on 12-hour shifts helping to coordinate getting troops, supplies and equipment toGrenada. Interview:Dwayne Britne ll, Se curity O ffice r, Me dical Company, Albuque rque , Ne w Me xico, and Re tire d U. S.Army Staff Officer (1969-1992): \"Our job was to occupy and defend Point Salines, which was the airstripon the southwestern tip of the island. WHAT WERE YOU TOLD WAS THE REASON FOR THE OPERATION IN GRENADA? I was told, of course, that it was political. Everything in the news at that time was that we were protectingsome college students that were American on the island. But, of course, that was a smokescreen because theREAL reason was that our intelligence picked up that the Cubans were expanding the runway so that theRussian military aircraft could land there and bring nuclear missiles within a range of continental U. S. Ofcourse, Pres. Reagan said, ‘No, that’s a no go. Put a stop to it.’ So, that’s why we invaded and killed theCubans. WHAT WAS IT THAT YOU LEARNED LATER ON AND HOW DID YOU LEARN THAT YET EVENANOTHER SECRET WAS BEING COVERED UP IN THE GRENADA OPERATION? If you look at the map, there are visibly two airstrips on the island of Grenada. One on the northeast side. ThenPt. Salines on the southwestern side. I can verify that from my experience in running the operation, that thenorthern airstrip had been declared a No Fly zone. I never could figure it out and I kind of blew it off untillater this kid that was in the USAF told me the story of what was going on and what transpired in extracting aUFO off of the island. CAN YOU TELL US WHAT HE TOLD YOU? Let me give you a little background. The runway was so short at Pt. Salines that everything we flew downthere, we flew – and I can verify that because I went to many staff meetings. We flew everything, mosteverything, by C-141s to the island of Barbados. We have a USAF base there and that’s where the young man,the young airman told me the story when he was stationed there at the air base. Everything was flown intoBarbados and offloaded from the C-141s and re-figured for C-130 transport because they were the only onesthat could land safely at the short runway at Pt. Salines."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" My wife knew his wife through the base veterinarian office and they were visiting our house one Sundayafternoon. Then he told me the story of what actually happened that he personally witnessed. WHICH WAS? He said a C-5A flew onto the airstrip at Barbados and it was piloted by a USAF one-star General and crew.They got off and the General said, “I need two volunteers for the night. My crew and I have to take crew restand I want one inside the aircraft and one outside walking around the aircraft to secure it overnight.’ So, he (young airman) said he was assigned the inside duties and having flown on a C-5A from Korea in mycareer, I know how it’s configured. Everything he told me matched up. All the passengers w ere in the rear ofthe plane facing backwards and there is a huge long ladder that goes down to the flooring down in the aircraft. So, he said in the middle of the night he got curious as to what the cargo was and he started down the ladderwith his flashlight and that’s when he saw it. He said, ‘That’s the god-awfullest thing I’d ever seen in my life!’Obviously, it scared him on many levels. But it was probably overgrown with growth having been in thejungle up there on that airstrip for so long. He – I don’t know how to put this (laughs). Basically, he said hewet his pants and went back up into the passenger compartment. Bell-Shaped UFO Covered with Jungle Vines But he drew a map on my dining room table – not a map, but a sketch – of this craft. Of course, he didn’tapproach it. He was too scared once he realized what it was. He didn’t know what was in it and I don’t either,whether there were actual alien bodies or anything like that. I really don’t know. Green lines indicate the vines still clinging all over the top or bell-shaped UFO after the USAF and Marinetroops cut it out of the Grenada jungle on the northeastern end of the island near P earls Airport and Tivoli.The craft was loaded aboard a C-5A for transport to Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, after one crew rest stop inBarbados. Government insiders have said this type of craft is linked to the blond humanoidsreferred to as \"Nordics,\" different from the grey EBEs (extraterrestrial biological entities) and anothergroup described as \"standing up lizards.\" Drawing © 2006 for Earthfiles by Dwayne Britnell. However, the way the story went, the next morning the General came out and relieved him and they took off toWright-Patterson AFB. My knowledge of why they chose a C-5A is because a C-5A is known for itscapability of short takeoffs and landings. Of course, that airstrip was very short. I also verified with a buddyof mine that I had know n in the Army who was a pilot and he fought in a helicopter. I called him a couple ofyears ago and he verified that the terrain up on that northeast (part of Grenada), the cliffs several hundred feetof drop-off in solid rock. There was a V in the rock that you had to go through to drop down so it would bevery difficult to get an aircraft to land on that Pt. Salines airstrip. But he said the natives had dug out bunkers inthe side of that rock to defend the airstrip and it might explain that they either shot (the UFO) down or it wasjust disabled and landed there. AND IT WOULD FIT INTO A C-5A? Oh, yeah. It obviously – C-5s are huge now! But this obviously was not what is termed a ‘mother ship,’ but asmaller craft. He said it fit in there fine."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The C-5A/B Galaxy is a heavy-cargo transport plane which can carry unusually largeand heavy cargo for intercontinental ranges at jet speeds.

Source: Military Analysis Network. Another comment he made was that prior to coming to Pope AFB, that he was stationed up at Wright-PattersonAFB and he knew for a fact up there that there are two runways and that one of them is never used for traffic.Off to the side, there is a huge building environmentally controlled – it has all the air conditioners and stuff outon top – which makes sense to house bodies or... And I also got that verified on a TV show on the Sci FiChannel that there were scientists who worked off base. They had a tunnel and went up elevators up into thatfacility on Wright-Patterson AFB. DID THEY HAVE TO USE MACHETES? OR WHAT DID THEY USE TO CHOP THIS DISC OUT OFTHE JUNGLE? A combination of cranes or forklifts and probably they carried some MAG-handling equipment capable oflifting it and putting it in the cargo plane. Probably carried it down with them and maybe the aircrew loaded itup. Or they got units on the ground to assist. He was a young airman, Air Force security police on the island of Barbados. So, he wasn’t there when theyloaded it. He was only there to secure it on Barbados when they took crew rest. SO, THEY FLEW FROM GRENADA TO BARBADOS? Right. THEN THEY WENT ON TO WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB? Right. SO, HE NEVER SAW IT IN THE JUNGLE? No. WHAT WAS IT THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF? The reason I said that is he drew on the sketch he drew for me, he drew vines all over it as if they didn’tbother to take the vines off and just cut them away and picked it up. It was disk on the bottom and kind of wentup into a point at the top, kind of a top. You know those tops that you spin? A spinning top. That’s pretty muchthe shape of it. HE DREW IT WITH THE VINES FROM NORTHERN GRENADA ALL OVER IT AS IF THEY HADCHOPPED IT OUT AND THEN LOADED IT ON THE C-5A TO GO BACK TO WRIGHT-PATTERSONAFB WITHOUT TAKING ANY OF THE VINES OFF? Right. Now an interesting point, one time the Prime Minister of Grenada, through the United Nations, had madea call for open and public investigation and that the international community ousted him from his position.They forced him out because he wanted to go public with – probably that fit together with his prior knowledgeof the physical presence of a UFO on his island. He knew that they existed and so he wanted to get otherpeople to help and participate. DID YOUR AIR FORCE SOURCE SAY ANY OF HIS SUPERIOR OFFICERS OR ANYONE ELSETALKED ABOUT OUR GOVERNMENT, OR SOME GOVERNMENT, SHOOTING THIS DISC DOWN ONGRENADA? No. It was kind of a closed thing. I’m sure the General told him, as most people are told, ‘Hey, you didn’t seeanything in here, you understand? If you want a career in the Air Force, you never say anything about this.’ Notelling how long that thing had been there prior to our invasion of the island. I have no idea how old it was, orhow long it had been there. My only suggestion was because it was overgrown with vines, that it had beenthere for quite some time. DID YOUR SOURCE EVER GET ANY MORE INFORMATION FROM ANY WORK IN RELATIONSHIPTO WHAT WRIGHT-PATTERSON FOUND? No. No. We were six months after the operation had ended and he went his way and I went mine. Findingsources like that are few and far between. IT’S AMAZING, ISN’T IT, TO CONTEMPLATE WHAT SIZE OF UNDERGROUND INSTALLATION, ORBUILDING INSTALLATION, THAT WRIGHT-PATTERSON WOULD HAVE TO HAVE OVER THELAST 60 YEARS TO ACCOMMODATE ALL OF THE CRAFT THAT HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED BY"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE PEOPLE AS HAVING BEEN TRANSFERRED THERE? Oh, absolutely! And not only from my source, the young airman. He said it w as a humongous building. But I also got from these civilians that it was multi-storied underground and that they went by a hallway orrailway under it and then had elevators up and down to go to the various floors and to the top. So, yeah! I canonly imagine how huge that facility is. WHAT DO YOU PERSONALLY THINK FROM A LONG 23 YEAR ARMY MILITARY CAREER ABOUTTHIS GOVERNMENT’S POLICY OF COMPLETE DENIAL ABOUT EXTRATERRESTRIALBIOLOGICAL ENTITIES THAT THEY KNOW ABOUT, BUT MAINTAIN A POLICY OF DENIAL IN THEINTEREST OF NATIONAL SECURITY? They think they are protecting the American public because my – the comment, if the people knew what wasgoing on, people would be jumping off of buildings. WHY? Out of fear. There are three fears: fear of death, fear of the unknown and fear of change. The validity ofspacecraft and aliens in our environment would be all of those things, create the fear of all three. I think theythink they are protecting the American people and the world by keeping it a secret.\"More Information: If any Earthfiles or Dreamland viewers and listeners have had any similar experience, please contact me at:earthfiles@earthfiles.com.
