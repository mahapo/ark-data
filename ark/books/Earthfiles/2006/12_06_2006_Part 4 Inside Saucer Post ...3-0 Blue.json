This photo was borrowed from me, after my lectureto Ground Observer Corps in September 1955, by a Cincinnati Post reporter. Later Ilearned that the Post could not reproduce photo for publication because of 'too much graininess.'Photo sent to CRIFO by Jesse Leaf of Brooklyn, N. Y.\" BEHIND THE LOCAL MUZZLEDuring the local flap of 1955, I visited a saucer-sympathetic newspaperman inthe editorial office of the Times Star. After discussing several recentdevelopments, which did not merit review in his newspaper, he assured methat they weren't being cut because of any restrictions he knew of. But as theEnquirer had told me, he was sure that the \"public was tired of reading aboutlights in the sky.\" His reasoning was sound, I thought, and as I expressed myunderstanding, I turned to leave. Smilingly, he said, \"Now if anything bighappens, let me know.\"On August 23, 1955, it happened! About midnight, residents throughout thecity were jarred by the roar of jets. From SAC, Lockbourne AFB, south ofColumbus, the Air National Guard jets were alerted, scrambled and were overCincinnati in 12 minutes. The alert began when three UFOs were sighted andconfirmed by radar somewhere between Columbus and Cincinnati. In themeantime, Walter Paner, Superintendent of Hamilton County GOC, on duty atthe Mt. Healthy Post, phoned me about the existent alert and relayed the wordthat jet interceptors were due over the area. He said the UFOs had been activeover Mt. Healthy, Ohio, and could be seen clearly by observers from thetower.In short time, the jets flying at approximately 20,000 feet were overCincinnati, but poor visibility prevented me and a visiting friend from Toronto,Canada, from seeing the UFOs, which had deployed over a wide area.According to radar, the interlopers had extended 37 miles south, 24 milesnorth of the city, and as far as 10 miles east of Mt. Healthy. A later call fromPaner disclosed that a UFO was seen hovering in pendulum-like motionsdirectly over the tower.At about 12:10 a.m., the jet interceptors made contact, swooped in and chasedthe UFO, which disappeared at incredible speed. In the meantime, theForestville and Loveland GOC Posts reported the erratic flights of UFOs tothe Air Filter Center and described them as round, brilliant white spheres anddiscs. I remained on watch from Madison Place with binoculars until 2 a.m.But heavy clouds prevailed and obscured the activity. However, overhead thecontinuous din of low flying jets reminded me of action in the Pacificcampaigns while waiting for the inevitable attack. Incongruously, the publicwas asleep or perhaps wondered about the noisy jets, but did not suspect thetruth.The following morning, jet aircraft were still aloft over greater Cincinnati, butit was not until nightfall that a UFO again was spotted by GOC in Forestville.Herb Clark, Ralph Bardoff and Fred Pfeffer were on duty and described theobject to the Filter Center as brilliant white and made no sound. Confirmingreports of UFO activity came from GOC in Loveland and as far west asVevay, Indiana.From a researcher's standpoint, the incident was extraordinary! Here, like thedawn of day, was evidence with radar confirmation of a solid body, ormachine; evidence, according to GOC observers, of its control andmaneuverability; evidence of the Air Force's policy to scramble and interceptthe UFO; and evidence of our government's concern over the UFO pervadingAmerican skies.Equally extraordinary, I thought, was the fact that the entire incident was\"cleared\" for publication in Orbit. This, too, had come about uniquely. Havingwritten up the report as I knew it had happened, I phoned Paner at his homeand asked for his advice about publishing it. He said he was not sure, butwould check with the authorities and suggested that I call back. Doing sominutes later, Paner told me it was perfectly acceptable as I had written it.Then to my surprise, he volunteered additional information regarding the radartracking which included the distances traveled by the UFOs. For furtherconfirmation of the UFOs' activity, I phoned the Control Tower of the GreaterCincinnati Airport in Boone County, Kentucky. They admitted, too, thatunidentified blips were tracked on their radar screen."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Stunned, my only rationalization wa that the Air Force had suddenly changedfrom their program of silence - or that I was being taken under their wing forspecial duty - or that somebody was talking out of turn. Indeed, before mewas startling evidence and a startling story that Cincinnati and the world hadawaited. But the Cincinnati newspapers were not interested! When I phonedthe Enquirer, they shrugged it off. A Post reporter took notes, but the storynever appeared in print. The Times Star , however, stumbling with promises tosend a reporter out to get all the facts finally, after a conference betweenreporter and city editor, decided against it.Reeling from these rebuffs, I now felt sure the press was playing the Air Forcegame. Remembering my Lake Charles interview, I also took greater stock inmy assumption that PIOs had long ago visited the local newspapers seekingtheir pledge of cooperation. Looking back, I recalled that similar securitymeasures had been affected with the press during World War II, especially inregards to matters concerning the Manhattan Project. While I couldunderstand the necessity for these wartime measures, I could find only causeto wonder about a peacetime blackout on the UFO. Was the news bad? WereUFOs belligerent? Was the jet intercept incident of August 23, one example ofa global defensive action? Perhaps the evidence within the record of localevents could supply the answer.Mrs. Isabel Hagglund of Palo Alto, California, commented on a series of localevents which I reviewed in Orbit: \"The silence of all conventionalcommunication media on the subject of the UFO has a nightmare quality.Three days after reading CRIFO I look around and wonder if I live in thesame world in which your newsletter was published? It must have beenanother Ohio in another United States on another planet where the orangeglobes and balls of light and small green men were seen, for neither the pressnor radio mentioned it here.\"With little or no reprieve in UFO activity through September and October of1955 I decided to headline, \"The Case for Interplanetary war\" in theNovember issue of Orbit. Research was shocked!While I was absorbing the complaints of those who preferred to think thatsaucerlings were peace-loving, another event in the \"spirit of cooperation\"was shaping. The Cincinnati Enquirer - reiterating its allegiance to the AirForce, I thought - summed it up as follows:\"Once again, and in the most unqualified terms, we have the wordof the Air Force that the flying saucers seen by so many people inso many places were not there at all. Whatever all these peoplesaw, they were not aircraft, missiles or spaceships from this orany other planet, according to Donald A. Quarles, Secretary ofthe Air Force ... Even if the story stopped there, we could expecta good many flying saucer enthusiasts to ignore the dictum of theAir Force and to go right on accumulating their sightings, theirtheories and their campaigns to persuade the public that thesesaucer-shaped space ships are real.\"Reading this, I almost chuckled. Had the editorial writer, I thought, forgottenhis respect for his fellow newspapermen who had seen UFOs, which includedno less than the Enquirer's own managing editor; not to mention the managingeditor of the Post and several other prominent columnists and reporters,representing each of the three Cincinnati newspapers? Instead of crowing, Idecided to drop the matter. Besides, who was there to crow to, except toOrbit readers and most of them already knew that editors and saucers weren'tmixing well.It was not until March 21, 1956, that saucers brought the Enquirer andCRIFO together again. It all began peaceably when a member of its staffcalled to inquire whether I had received \"saucer\" reports that evening. Herelated that his paper had received a number of calls and wondered if I couldadd to their story? I told him that I had received several calls, some reportinga bright luminous object hovering in the west, which was obviously Venus.However, others described objects, not Venus. One told of a low-flying objectchanging from red to white, making no sound. Another reported a steadygreen light darting away swiftly after hovering. Another described an objectwith swept-back wings. Still another report, received before the evening's rashof sightings, said a long, metallic cigar-shaped object flew lower over ahighway near Harrison, Ohio. The object \"without windows or protrudingparts\" buzzed an automobile, terrifying three male occupants."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The next morning on March 22, 1956, the Enquirer's jaunty play-up of theincident touched off the usual controversy. Under glaring headlines,accompanied by four photographs, two showing amorphous blobs, two lightsshaped like baseball bats, the Enquirer reported the sightings I contributed, inaddition to the following:\"An unidentified object burned like a bright beacon for at least 45minutes high in the western sky ... That's how long it wasobserved by an Enquirer reporter and photographer who took upstations at North Bend following telephone calls ... To the nakedeye, the object appeared to be an extraordinarily intensebluish-white light, suspended at about a 30-degree angle abovethe horizon. However, through binoculars the object appeared tobe a compact galaxy of lights, changing form as they revolvedslowly. At one point, with binoculars set slightly out of focus, itassumed the appearance of a diamond brooch ringed withemeralds turning lazily on an eccentric axis. ...Residents of a largearea in the down river section reported that it was the thirdconsecutive night 'the thing' has appeared.\"On March 23, the Enquirer had the mystery object simply explained! Under aheadline which read, \"It's only a star, folks! 'Thing\" is Identified from PlaneWindow.\" The newspaper told of a F-84 Thunderjet that swooped the nightbefore overhead at 30,0000 feet, unseen, but in radio contact with a C-45piloted by Brig. General Edsel Clark, Ohio Air National Guard AdjutantGeneral.Joining the General in this reconnaissance was Alan Kain, who photographedthe object on the night of March 21, for the Enquirer. Kain, who knew whatto look for, was the first to sight the object. Then, according to the Enquirer,the General spoke into the microphone to the jet pilot, received an answer andturned to Kain smiling, \"Pretty star, isn't it?\" The case was closed. The saucerwas Venus! However, in the days following, I had continued to collect sightingreports, most of which reverted back to the night of March 21, 1956. In all, Ihad seventeen covering a three day period. Eleven, according to my analysis,were explainable as Venus - six were not!Armed with this composite report, I called on the Enquirer's city editor,George Carr, hoping to impress him with the six sightings which could not beexplained as Venus. Carr, however, refused to review my analysis and told mehe considered the case closed! In spite of this, on March 26, the Enquirerreopened the case, featuring a story in which Dr. Paul Herget, Director ofCincinnati Observatory of the University of Cincinnati, was quoted as follows:\"The planet Venus will keep getting brighter until the middle ofMay. Every fool who goes out and looks at it for the first timewill see a flying saucer.\" Herget was asked to explain why theUFO object appeared like emeralds and changed shapes. Hecommented, \"A completely spurious image - your observationmust have been made under poor conditions. And I don't want toexplain your poor binoculars.\"Herget's voice was final as far as the Enquirer was concerned,but to me the most significant event of the evening of March 21 -and which I am revealing for the first time - took place afterVenus had set into the horizon. Charles Deininger of the Mt.Healthy GOC Post in the city's northwest had just hung up thephone after reporting mysterious lights seen in his area. Runningoutdoors to check the eastern skies, I immediately spotted twolarge, low-flying lights, similar to those on a plane's wing-tips.One glowed green and one yellow, both speeding north. Betweenthe lights was a dark mass, the body. But it was the soft eerieglow of the lights and their distance apart in relation to theirnearness to the ground that impressed me the most. Watching theobject skimming over a nearby hill into the horizon, I knew that itwas not an aircraft. For it to be that large and low, its engineswould have been easily heard. But at no time was there anysound.Running back indoors, I flashed a call to the Air Filter Center inColumbus. While giving a quick descriptive run-down on theobject to the sergeant on duty, I was suddenly interrupted andtold to stand by. After moments of silence, the sergeant returned"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"and asked me to repeat the object's course. \"We're trying anexperiment,\" he said. \"Now describe the object again as loud asyou can.\" While repeating it for the third time, the sergeant againcut in and told me to stand by. This time I could hear him callinga code name (purposely omitted because of possible securityinfringement). Then his voice, in a one-sided conversation, askedsomeone if my descriptions were clear. After another lull andwithout further comment about the experiment, the sergeant thenbegan filling out a \"column 9\" report.For reference, I quote from S.O.P. No. 13, May 17, 1955, Page 2,Paragraph 5, entitled \"Operations - Types of Aircraft to Report\"as follows:\"In case of unknown flying objects or aircraft indistress or any unusual occurrences, a column 9report should be made. Give a description of theunknown object, its size, shape and speed; or if anaircraft is in distress give complete details. Air Forcepersonnel on duty will ask additional questionspertaining to the object or aircraft in distress oroccurrence and additional information you can givewill be helpful.\"In the meantime, hearing a jet's hum over my area strengthenedmy first suspicions of being in direct communication with a jetpilot. Maybe the one aloft! To me, this meant radar hadconfirmed the object and that some of the people seeing a light inthe sky over Cincinnati were seeing something besides Venus!\"Continued in Part 5 - Media's Biased Editing of UFO IncidentsMore Information:For further information about Leonard Stringfield's UFO Status Reports, please see reprintsbelow from the Earthfiles Archives:Status Reports I• 10/25/2005 -- Final Part 6: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 10/13/2005 -- Part 5: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 10/05/2005 -- Part 4: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 09/30/2005 -- Part 3: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 09/26/2005 -- Part 2: Retrievals of the Third Kind - Kingman, Arizona Crash• 09/25/2005 -- Part 1: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary CustodyStatus Reports II• 09/19/2005 -- Final Part 9: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/17/2005 -- Part 8: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/14/2005 -- Part 7: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/06/2005 -- Part 6: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 08/22/2005 -- Part 5: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 08/17/2005 -- Part 4: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/20/2005 -- Part 3: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/14/2005 -- Part 2: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/12/2005 -- Part 1: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New DataStatus Reports III• 07/05/2005 -- Final Part 15: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 06/20/2005 -- Part 14: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 06/17/2005 -- Part 13: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 05/10/2005 -- Part 12: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 05/04/2005 -- Part 11: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 04/19/2005 -- Part 10: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence © June 1982 byLeonard H.
