K.© 2006 by Linda Moulton Howe Seventy-eight triangles in fractal pattern were reported in Savernake Forest wheat fieldnear Marlborough, Wiltshire, England, on July 19, 2005. Aerial image© 2005 by Cropcircleconnector.com. August 17, 2006 Cherhill, Wiltshire, England - Two weeks ago at the Silent Circle Cafe in Cherhill, I metand talked with Kate Fenn about an encounter she and a colleague had with military helicopters, which seemedto be aggressively interacting with a large, red, glowing sphere above a crop formation in the SavernakeForest near Marlborough. The date was last year in early August 2005.Kate Fenn is the Community Care Officer for the Adult Health and Social Care Team at Savernake Hospital inMarlborough. Kate and one of her hospital colleagues were driving toward Ramsbury on the Stitchcomb farmroad in the Savernake Forest."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Savernake Forest and surrounding crop fields are southeast of Marlborough,Wiltshire County, England. Stitchcombe Road runs through the forest and fields.Interview:Kate Fenn, Community Care Officer, Adult Health and Social Care Team, Savernake Hospital,Marlborough, Wiltshire , England: \"It was a sunny, bright day about 11 a.m. There was no wind, butsuddenly we saw trees moving wildly in the forest and wondered what was happening? Then we could hearhelicopters. Two were very close by, very loud and roared over the top of the car. They were black militaryhelicopters and we wondered what they were doing in this area, because we don’t tend to see those particularhelicopters. We are close to the flight path of RAF Lyneman and are very aware of what flies over most of thetime, particularly in the summer months when it is light.These two helicopters were making the trees very, very wild, and my friend was quite scared because theywere very low and the noise from them was vibrating through the car. So we slowed up to see where they hadgone and we actually found they had gone into one of the first fields you come to when you take that little road.I decided to pull over and have a look at exactly what they were doing because they appeared to be hoveringthere at that time. The noise was extraordinary! The trees were quite wild around us. I saw a luminous red ballof light that was underneath the helicopters and was moving independently from them w ithout any effort at all.The type of red it glowed was kind of ketchup red, a tomato red, which seemed to be contained in the form,which would have been about five feet in diameter. Not that great a size, but the sphere was moving quiterapidly when it chose to. The light seemed to be conscious with intelligence and moved across the triangleformation that was there, which was situated down in a dip in the land. We were very aware of this ball oflight moving, almost playing with these helicopters. The helicopters were just above it, trying to follow itacross the field. But the light didn’t seem to be perturbed by the two helicopters at all.Illustration with Kate Fenn for Earthfiles of the first two military helicopters in early August 2005,which moved aggressively above the 5-foot-diameter red, glowing sphere. Below the helicopters and the red spherewas the 78-triangle fractal pattern (rings around triangle symbolize the complicated formation) in SavernakeForest wheat field near Marlborough, first reported on July 19, 2005.We stood and watched for a few minutes. The helicopters came back again and were joined by two otherhelicopters (for a total of four). So, it was almost like a full-scale exercise going on out there in the middle ofSavernake Forest, which is certainly not normal. Then a helicopter came across to us in the car and we werevery aware that we were not wanted there. My friend and colleague was very frightened. Since we had anappointment to get to as well, we decided to leave. That red sphere of light was not connected in any way tothe helicopters. It was quite independent of them. It seemed then to just shoot off. You couldn’t see it becauseit moved so fast.Later on that particular day, when we got back to the hospital everybody that works there had been very awareof the activity of these military helicopters because they had flown so low over the hospital itself."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Sphere Large Compared to MostMysterious Lights in Crop FormationsFIVE FEET DIAMETER FOR ANY KIND OF A GLOWING, MYSTERIOUS LIGHT, ESPECIALLYASSOCIATED WITH CROP FORMATIONS, IS HUGE. OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DECADES, THELIGHTS HAVE USUALLY BEEN DESCRIBED AS ABOUT 6 INCHES TO 12 INCHES IN DIAMETER.IT'S EXTRAORDINARY THAT THERE WAS A FIVE-FOOT-DIAMETER RED, GLOWING SPHERE INRELATIONSHIP AT FIRST TO TWO HELICOPTERS, AND THEN FOUR HELICOPTERS?That’s right. That’s correct.IF YOU WERE GOING TO CHARACTERIZE WHETHER THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE5-FOOT RED GLOWING SPHERE AND THIS HELICOPTER WERE AGGRESSIVE FROM THE SPHERETO THE HELICOPTERS, OR AGGRESION FROM THE HELICOPTERS TO THE SPHERE – WHATWOULD YOU SAY?I would say it was most definitely aggression from the helicopters to the sphere. The aggression didn’t seem tocome in any w ay from the sphere. It seemed to be – you could say, confident. It was very smooth in movingand not bothered by the helicopters at all. There was no aggression from the sphere at all.WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY THE RED LIGHT WAS PLAYING CAT AND MOUSE WITH THEHELICOPTERS?Absolutely. And if we had not been shaking in our boots with fear, I think it would have been fun to watchlonger and to see what went on before we got there.DID YOU HEAR ANY SOUND ASSOCIATED WITH THAT RED SPHERE?Nothing at all.COULD YOU SEE ANY RED LIGHT COMING FROM THE SPHERE ONTO THE ENVIRONMENT, THEPLANTS, THE HELICOPTER, ANYTHING? WAS THERE ANYTHING REFLECTING THE RED LIGHTIN THE ENVIRONMENT AROUND IT?It didn’t appear to be. It seemed that all of the light was contained within the sphere itself.WAS THAT UNUSUAL THAT THERE WAS NO LIGHT CAST FROM THE RED GLOW?Absolutely, yes. You would have thought some of the glowing light would be cast.IF THE BRITISH MILITARY IS IN AN AGGRESSIVE STANCE AGAINST THESE MYSTEROUSLIGHTS, HAVE YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUE SPECULATED ABOUT WHY THAT MIGHT BE?Pure fear, I w ould imagine. Pure fear. I didn’t see any aggressive movement (by the sphere), not anything thatwould indicate it was aggressive, or could be aggressive. Once the shock of seeing what we saw had gone, wedid wonder that same thing – why the military was being so aggressive and interested in it? What Was the Red, Glowing Sphere?DID YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUE TALK WITH EACH OTHER ABOUT WHAT A 5-FOOT GLOWINGSPHERE COULD BE? AND FROM WHERE?Absolutely. We are very used to seeing different things in the night and day time – sometimes to do withfarming and combine harvesters at this time of year. But in broad daylight in the middle of a field in a forest,certainly there was nothing at all that we could think it could have been. We know it was not connected in anyway to the helicopters. We had no idea what we had seen, but we actually did not feel frightened by that(sphere) at all. We were much more afraid of the helicopter activity.WHAT ABOUT THE IDEA THAT THE RED, GLOWING SPHERE COULD BE FROM OUTER SPACE?I can’t give any other explanation because it was nothing I had ever come across before. Both of us, mycolleague is far more skeptical than myself. But that was the only possibility we could think of and accept.WHEN YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUE CONTEMPLATE SOMETHING FROM OUTER SPACE BEINGHERE AND IN THE FIELDS, DOES IT SCARE YOU? PROVOKE YOU? WHAT IS THE RESIDUE THATYOU ARE LEFT WITH BY THIS LINK BETWEEN MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS AND THE CROPFORMATIONS?I can’t speak for my colleague because she is not here. I know she was very frightened by it, by the thought thatsomething from anywhere else was visiting us. But as I discussed with her, it could be something that is verywelcome. It is probably a part of the universe that we’re in, so why should there be any separation. It’s left mewith a knowledge that these things do interact with us, probably far more than we realize.WHAT DO YOU THINK THE CROP FORMATIONS ARE ABOUT?I believe that they are a combination of energies. I believe they are from the Earth, to do with the water and todo with interplanetary beings, if that’s what you want to call them. I think there are many things that have to bein place and aligned for that to happen. Also, our consciousness. I think it is perhaps a combination of thosethings, but I think they are very special messages for all of us."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"HAD YOU BEEN ABLE TO EXPLORE THE CROP FORMATION BEFORE OR AFTER THE REDSPHERE AND HELICOPTERS EVENT?I had explored it when it first appeared. It had lots of triangles. I thought it was very special indeed. It wasrelated to pyramid energy. I was very overwhelmed with that formation.IN ALL THE YEARS OF CROP FORMATIONS EMERGING IN SOUTHERN ENGLAND, HAVE YOUEVER HEARD OF ANYONE ENCOUNTERING A 5 FOOT DIAMETER RED, GLOWING SPHERE?Many years ago at Alton Barnes, something similar appeared at that time. It was at the beginning of theformations appearing. There were many people from this area watching the skies at that time, and manyscientists as well. From what I believe, they were watching for UFO activity and I saw something similar onthat day.YOU SAW ONE OF THOSE RED SPHERES?Yes, once before back then. That’s the only similar thing, but it was not red at that time. It was just a largeluminous light that went over and many people saw it. But that was the only thing I’ve ever seen that would besimilar to the Savernake red glowing sphere.\"More Information:For further information about worldwide crop formations, please see reports below in the EarthfilesArchives and my book, Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles, in the Earthfiles Shop.• 08/15/2006 -- Part 2 - Three Crop Formations Near Uffington White Horse - A \"Merkabah?\"• 08/13/2006 -- Part 1: Three Crop Formations Near Uffington White Horse• 08/12/2006 -- From Wiltshire to Red Alert At Heathrow Airport• 07/21/2006 -- U.
