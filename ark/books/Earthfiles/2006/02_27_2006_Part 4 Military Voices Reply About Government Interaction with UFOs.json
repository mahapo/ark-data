The pilot was immediately killed.It became apparent to the USAF that these things were watching theguys at the secret installation in Bermuda.\" - Source: USAF Officer, 1950s February 27, 2006 - On January 20-21, 2006, I posted at Earthfiles and broadcast onCoast to Coast AM radio an update with U. S. Navy physicist, Bruce Maccabee, about hisdiscussions with a USAF geophysicist referred to as \"Hawk.\" See two-part 012106Earthfiles. I also reported more about former New Mexico State Representative AndrewKissner's (Dona Ana County, Las Cruces) investigations of V-2 rocket research at WhiteSands Proving Ground in 1947 when aerial discs interfered with launches. See \"PeculiarPhenomenon\" Real X-Files series beginning with 121905 Earthfiles. Since these several reports, I have received more than a hundred e-mails from people whohave either firsthand military and/or intelligence backgrounds, or are relatives of peoplewho have such backgrounds. Many have asked that their identity remain anonymous. Ifeel it is valuable to share some of the e-mails and hope other Earthfiles viewers and radiolisteners will contact me with additional information that complements, or goes beyond,what I am posting in this series of Earthfiles military voices.Continued from 020706Earthfiles:Military Voices Respond toEarthfiles and Radio Reports15) \"Antigravity Device\" At WSMR in Early 1970s?\"I was stationed at White Sands Missile Range in 1972 to 1974 and worked onvarious projects, including the Viking Mars Lander, SkyLab and the Mirageproject (declassified in the mid-1990s). I worked mostly at Building 1510.\"The range commander at the time (a civilian) was Gordon Dunaway. He is anamazing man, VERY intelligent, and he once told me that there were things heknew that kept him awake at night and he wished he had not known.\"Another high level official who worked there at the time was George Fugate.Later, Gordon retired and Dave Novlan took his place. Many of ourdownrange projects involved strange craft (blue glowing propulsion systems)that were clearly antigravity devices. But I was not at a clearance level then tobe privy to that fact. It was just obvious to those of us who provided supporton the flight tests.\"I was not at a high enough clearance to be directly involved with the testcraft projects, but I did support them at Building 1510 where we providedimpact prediction and other related technical support. Also, the Mirage projectinvolved long-range targeting lasers which were capable of shooting downboosters from Green River, Utah, downrange to WSMR. That was in the earlyto mid-1970s, long before 'Star Wars' was supposedly initiated.\" 16) UFO Beams Minuteman Missile Silo At Ellsworth AFB in Mid-1960s\"At Ellsworth AFB, the 44 Strat. Missile Wing, Minuteman 1 and then 2 hadthree squadrons of 50 Minuteman each. The Launch Control Facilities were65 feet underground, concrete and steel, shock isolated. The 50 missiles ineach squadron were 3 to 5 miles away. Security and support services topside.No one, not even maintenance crews, could get into a site quicker than the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"security troops upstairs could get there, winter or summer.\"Re: UFOs, we had a spring and summer of almost daily sightings. The mostinteresting of which occurred when the individual site alarms were set off andwe dispatched the topside 'Strike Teams' to investigate. Normally, the alarmswere set off by a cow or deer rubbing up against the fence.\"But this particular evening, I was at Echo, the Squadron Command Post,when the topside crew called me and told me that there's been a UFO sightingby a strike team sent to a site. There was the stream of light down to the topof the missile silo and a hovering UFO.\"I talked to the Strike Team leader later on because I had reports to make. Thewhole point of all this is that the crew commander sent a Sitrep to SAC HQand some Colonel came over the radio and said these immortal words: 'Son,what do you see?' After a long silence, the crew commander was forced tosay: 'Sir, we're 65 feet underground and 4 miles away, so I don't see anything.'\"The Colonel immediately dropped off the net. This was initially funny, butupon thinking about it, we all realized that this particular HQ guy did not evenknow how a Minuteman squadron was deployed. The Team Leader later toldme that the UFO did not really hurry, but a couple of minutes after theyarrived, it shot straight up and out of sight at an unbelievable speed - nosound, but a mild hum.\"There were men in black around for about two months that summer,deployed around in choppers, ready to quickly get a look at the things. I neversaw a summary of their sightings.\" 17) UFOs Attacked 'Invisible-Painted' USAF Plane Near Bermuda, 1950s\"When my father was in the U. S. Air Force in the 1950s, he became ahigh-ranking officer and he had clearances that only a very few would beprivy to. He told me a story about what happened back in the 1950s and whathe had witnessed and was involved in. He could not share this with anyonebecause he knew that the top guys in government would assassinate him if anyof this would come out.\"He then told me that the U. S. Air Force had a secret installation basesomewhere near Bermuda. It was underground. It was dismantled after a UFOincident. They were experimenting on a wrecked UFO and discovered a wayto create a certain type of paint which cannot be seen with the naked eye. Thenatural color of this type of paint is silver in a more balanced nature, but whenit is energized through the friction of wind, it can be controlled to make it looklike it's invisible.\"They then put this special paint on a plane (can't say what type of plane inthis e-mail). The pilot took off into the air and only a few feet from theground, it cannot be seen with the naked eye.\"Several UFOs appeared out of nowhere and apparently shot our 'invisible-painted' plane down. The pilot was immediately killed. It became apparent tothe USAF that these things were watching the guys at the secret installation inBermuda.\"The USAF board at the time decided then it was an act of war against these,whoever was flying the UFOs. It became clear with realization that theseso-called Unidentified Flying Objects were also using the invisible-typetechnology and probably still are. This technology was highly classifiedbecause it was reverse engineering from UFO technology.\"More Information:For more information about UFO/E.T. phenomena, please see the followingreports in Earthfiles Archives :• 02/23/2006 -- Huge Boomerang Craft and Blond Beings• 02/22/2006 -- Part 3: Military Voices Reply About Government Interactionwith UFOs• 02/21/2006 -- Part 2: Military Voices Reply About Government Interactionwith UFOs"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"• 02/17/2006 -- Updated: White Sands Navy Radar Operator Saw Discs CircleV-2 Rocket Launches• 02/13/2006 -- Mysterious, Aerial Bars of Light Near Brawley, California• 02/10/2006 -- Crashed Disc Photos, \"Ebens,\" and Area 51 \"Anti-Gravity\"• 02/10/2006 -- NORAD \"Fast Walkers\" and \"Men In Black\"• 02/07/2006 -- Military Voices Reply About Government Interaction withUFOs.• 02/05/2006 -- Part 11 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts toCollect and Analyze Flying Discs• 01/27/2006 -- Part 2: Navy Physicist and USAF Geophysicist Discuss UFOsand ETs• 01/20/2006 -- Part 1: Navy Physicist and USAF Geophysicist Discuss UFOsand ETs• 01/17/2006 -- Part 9 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts toCollect and Analyze Flying Discs• 01/13/2006 -- 31st Cattle Mutilation on Red Bluff, California Ranch• 12/21/2005 -- Updated: Part 2 - Peculiar Phenomenon, Early United StatesEfforts to Collect and Analyze Flying Discs• 12/02/2005 -- Abduction by Grey ETs in Huge, Black Triangle• 11/11/2005 -- Part 3: An Alleged 1953 UFO Crash and Burial Near Garrison,Utah• 11/10/2005 -- Part 2: An Alleged 1953 UFO Crash and Burial Near Garrison,Utah• 11/02/2005 -- Part 3: Unusual Animal Deaths -Sheep Mutilations inMoortown, Dartmoor, England• 10/27/2005 -- Updated: Five \"Satellites\" That Merged As One Star• 10/25/2005 -- Part 6 - Final: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study ofAlleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody• 10/13/2005 -- Part 5: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of AllegedUFOs and Occupants in Military Custody• 10/07/2005 -- Part 1: Beam Technology Lifted Body Near Ft.
