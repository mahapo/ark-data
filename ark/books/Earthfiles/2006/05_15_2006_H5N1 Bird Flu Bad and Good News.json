May 15, 2006 Tanah Karo, Sumatra, Indonesia - Five people in an Indonesian family have all died of birdflu, according to Nyoman Kandun, who heads the Indonesian Healthy Ministry's Office of CommunicableDisease Control. Three others in the family also contracted the deadly H5N1 virus, but so far have survived. Eight people in one family becoming infected with bird flu is known as a \"cluster\" case. Those cluster casesare what medical authorities around the world want to study most closely to see if there is any evidence ofdirect human-to-human transmission. To date, human cases of H5N1 have been linked to close contact withfarm birds such as chickens and ducks. As of May 12, 2006, the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) shows cumulative H5N1 cases in Indonesia tobe 33 with 25 deaths. The current world total of cases in ten countries compiled by W.H.O. is 208 cases and115 deaths.

The fear was that the spring 2006 migration of birds into Africa and NorthAmerica would accelerate the spread of the deadly disease and increase the possibility that the lethal viruscould keep mutating into one that can spread human-to-human.

One caution: since the cycle of the deadly virus is still not understood, new cases in migratory birds couldoccur again in the summer of 2006 because it is known the virus can survive for long periods in water. SeniorVeterinarian Juan Lubroth at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome told The NewYork Ti mes: \"Is it like Y2K, where also nothing happened? Why didn't H5N1 sweep up the coast form Nigerto Benin and Senegal and back up through Europe? Why didn't it hit Africa's big lakes? All we have are a fewsnapshots of the virus. What we need is a movie of its life cycle.\" Websites: World Health Organization: http://www.who.int/e n/ Centers for Disease Control (CDC): http://www.cdc.gov/ Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
