The galactic center is 26,000 light-years from Earth and is fullof stars. There were five radio bursts in 1-meter-long radio wavelengths of 330 MegaHertzdetected over a 7 hour period on the night of September 30 to October 1, 2002. The fiveradio bursts were equally spaced apart by 77 minutes and there were no detectable x-rayemissions. No one studying our galaxy has ever seen any radio bursts like that before. Thesource is a complete mystery."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The SNR 359.1-00.5 region is enlarged on the left and the yellow spotindicates the location of the 5 strong, repeating radio bursts in the 1-meter-longwavelength recorded on September 30 to October 1, 2002. Name givento unknown source: \"GCRT J1745-3009.\" Graphic overlaycourtesy Sweet Briar College Physics Department.Another Radio Burst September 28, 2003Now, this year on March 1, 2006, the same science team published in The AstrophysicalJournal new data about another similar radio burst detected on September 28, 2003. Thatwas a single burst luckily caught in a short 10-minute observation. No one knows if therewere other bursts before and after the one detected from Earth. The 2003 single radioburst was approximately three times weaker than the five radio bursts in 2002. Still, no oneknows what the source of such similar radio bursts toward the center of our galaxy couldbe, while a possible third radio burst is being analyzed from 2004 data.The lead scientist monitoring the Milky Way Galaxy center is Scott Hyman, Ph.D.,Professor of Physics in the Dept. of Physics and Engineering at Sweet Briar College inSweet Briar, Virginia. He began his research a few years ago at the request of a colleagueat the Naval Research Laboratory. Why the Navy would want to investigate radio signalsin the galactic core is not known. But the strong, repeating radio bursts on regular intervalswithout x- ray emissions (X-rays are found in some natural cosmic emitters) provokes atleast a question: could the source be another cosmic civilization? I recently talked withProf. Hyman about that question and what more he has learned about the powerful,repeating long wave radio bursts. Interview:Scott Hyman, Ph.D., Prof. of Physics, Dept. of Physics and Engineering, Sweet BriarCollege, Sweet Briar, Virginia: \"It’s still an enigma. The five bursts that were emittedwere detected by the Very Large Array Telescope in Datil, New Mexico, operated by theNational Science Foundation. On September 30 to October 1, 2002, the array was pointedat the galactic center.The Very Large Array is a set of 27 dish antennas coordinated so they can act as one largeantenna the size of those 27 to give very high resolution and sensitivity radio images. So,the object could have been anywhere in principal between us and the galactic center. Wedo not know the distance. We don’t have a distance determination yet."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Small section of Very Large Array (VLA) radio telescopes,which move on tracks in coordination together in Datil,New Mexico. Image courtesy VLA.So, when I was analyzing the data two years later, I can describe the Eureka! feeling I hadwhen I was looking at the data, which was compiled from all six hours. I saw a little radiosource, little blob on the image of the galactic center that normally is not there. At thispoint, I have been monitoring for so long that I know pretty much every blob of radioemission that is a steady emitter.What I did was divide the data set into halves in time and sure enough, I was able to honein on five ten-minute-or-so bursts where it was very intense. In between, there was noemission at all. So, this is a very exciting moment.THESE BURSTS CAME IN A VERY REGULAR INTERVAL, DIDN’T THEY?Yes, yes, that’s right. They came 77 minutes apart, give or take 30 seconds. The problem isthat the observation was only six hours long and we do not know how long those burstswere occurring after the detection or observation ended, or before the observation began.It could have been going on much longer.I should tell you that we have done more monitoring since we published the March 2005paper in Nature. We applied for more observation time, principally to find and detect thesource again. We’ve been monitoring all this year of 2006, but have not detected it againin our current observations.However – and this is the good news – again we found the source in data from 2003. Butagain, two to three years too late to follow it up. So, we now have at least two differentdetections of the radio source:1) the five bursts from September 30 to October 1, 2002;2) and then one burst we detected in September of 2003, in data taken by theGiant Metrewave Radio Telescope, near Pune, India.Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), near Pune in Maharashtra, India.GMRT is the world's largest radio telescope at meter wavelengths. It consists of thirtyantennas of 45 meter-diameter spread over a 25 kilometer region and operating atwavelengths of 20cm, 49cm, 90cm, 128cm and 200cm. Image courtesy GMRT.WAS THAT BURST THE SAME 77 MINUTES APART?That’s the problem. We only detected one burst. But that data was not taken in acontiguous manner. That instrument only observed typically ten minutes at a time withspacing in between for calibration or other observations. So, we caught one burst. But wemight have missed the others, if there were others."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Enigma: No X-Rays Associated with Radio BurstsIS ONE OF THE BIG ANOMALIES ABOUT THE REPEATING RADIO BURSTS THATTHERE ARE NO ASSOCIATED X-RAYS?In this case, yes. We’ve looked in the archives of various x-ray telescope facilities and donot find any x-rays emitted near the time that we detected the bursts in (very low) radiofrequencies.We also did our own search in 2005 with the Chandra X-ray Telescope, which is NASA’sorbiting satellite telescope, and did not detect bursts or any steady emissions. We werehoping we would find a source of x-rays that was steady. There are other transient sourcesthat exhibit steady, constant emission, and then periodically bursts. But we did not findthat. So, on the one hand, we were disappointed. On the other hand, it adds to the mysteryabout what the source is.YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT AN UNKNOWN DISTANCE AND THE POWER OF THISTO BE PERCEIVED HERE ON EARTH MUST BE GIGANTIC?The luminosity is what we are really after and, of course, we don’t know that because wedon’t know the distance (from Earth to the radio bursts.) But if it is at the galactic center,because we were just pointing at the galactic center, then it is a very bright, luminousobject, in strong bursts – one of the strongest radio bursts ever detected. Mysterious Radio Bursts HaveNo Circular PolarizationThe other interesting feature about it that would tend to rule out a nearby object is that wehave not detected any circular polarization. In other words, radio emissions can bepolarized – which is a characteristic of its waves of radio emission. Nearby brown dwarfstars or flare stars tend to be polarized. We did not detect polarization in the bursts that wedetected.We also detected it at a low frequency for radio waves. Our monitoring program is at 330megahertz precisely because we get a large field of view at that low frequency, so we canmonitor over a fairly large region of the sky.The low frequencies – we have not detected low frequency bursts from nearby flare starsor brown dwarfs typically. So the puzzling radio bursts doesn’t fit a brown dwarf or flarestar signature. Could the Radio Source Be A \"Magnetar\"?DO YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY SPECULATION NOW IN 2006FALL ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT BE?We have been working on a paper that would model the source as a ‘magnetar,’ which is ahighly magnetized object, a very collapsed star like a pulsar, but even more magnetized,which could power extreme bursts like this.But now the picture is getting more complicated because of the second detection we had in2003 (from India). We have some evidence that it really did not repeat – that it really wasan isolated burst, even though we only had ten minutes every hour. There are some otherobservations further afield in which we might still have detected this source 77 minuteslater or earlier, if it had been emitting. Possible Third Radio Burst in 2004I should point out that we have possibly a third detection. Again, it’s another archival dataset from 2004. We’re still analyzing that data, so it’s a tentative detection. If it’s true, it’sstrange it would have diminished quite a lot. It’s a faint detection – one burst again, butthirty times fainter than the others. So, we’re being very careful to determine whether thisis a beneficed detection or not. But in fact, if its strength is decaying, that will thencomplicate matters as to the origin of the radio emissions. I’m sorry to say that we justdon’t have any really definitive idea or any additional information since 2002, except that"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"it’s still alive. We have had a detection in 2002, 2003 and perhaps 2004. Could Source Be Another Cosmic Civilization?SINCE SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, originally NASA program and nowindependent) IS CONVINCED THERE IS OTHER LIFE OUT THERE, WHYCOULDN’T THIS MYSTERIOUS SERIES OF RADIO BURSTS BE FROM A FARDISTANT CIVILIZATION?That’s something that would be so exciting. I actually do believe that SETI has at leastfiled this detection in their archives as one to keep an eye on. But nothing is ruled out,except the wise scientist will always try to rule out the more mundane explanations beforegoing there (extraterrestrial).IT SE EMS IN A WAY THAT SCIENCE IS IN A STRAIGHTJACKET. SE TI AND CARLSAGAN AND SO MANY OTHERS OVER THE YEARS HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE‘BILLIONS AND BILLIONS’ OF PLANETS THAT SHOULD HAVE LIFE OUT THEREIN THE UNIVERSE. WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING IN A VARIETY OF FREQUENCIESVIA SETI. WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS THAT YOU HAVE BEENABLE TO MONITOR OVER THREE YEARS, WHY IS IT THAT THE FIRSTPOSSIBILITY IS NOT THAT YOU MIGHT FINALLY HAVE GOTTEN A STRONGRADIO SIGNAL REPEATING FROM A CIVILIZATION?Well, because that would be the most extraordinary conclusion that would demand themost evidence. Carl Sagan had a great adage where he said that extraordinary claimsdemand extraordinary evidence or proof. So, the more extraordinary the claim, the moresure you’ve got to be. The threshold for the evidence pointing in that direction wouldmean the bar would have to be set very, very high. Variability of Radio Bursts Complicates HypothesesBut the problem we have is that we haven’t detected enough to rule out anythingdefinitively and to constrain new models. If our evidence that it’s not emitting every 77minutes any more is true, then that will constrain models of the source. Some of the papersthat have been published have suggested it could be a double pulsar or it could be a whitedwarf pulsar or various things which may or may not be able to explain why it is not emitevery 77 minute when it does emit.HOW WOULD YOU PROVE IF THIS WERE A STRONG RADIO SIGNAL FROM ANADVANCED CIVILIZATION IN THE GALACTIC CENTER?I imagine you would need repeated – you would have to find a signal in the haystack thatis a message, a statement, a code, something that cannot be explained naturally. And Idon’t really want to go there anymore (laughs).OK, WELL, IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THIS IS AN ENIGMA AFTER ALL THIS TIMEAND IT WOULD BE FASCINATING TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE ON EARTHWOULD GO ABOUT TRYING TO SEE IF IT WERE SOME KIND OF ADVANCEDINTELLIGENCE.Sure, well, the only way to do it is to keep monitoring and get more data. The first thing isexperimental in this case. We can’t go there! (laughs) So, we have to wait until it burstsagain and hope we are detecting it. But one can’t speculate in any logical direction withoutit only being a speculation unless one has more evidence and data. Future ResearchWHAT IS NOW THE CURRENT PLAN YOU HAVE WITH WHICH INSTRUMENTSAND WHERE TO KEEP MONITORING?We have a program this year where we are monitoring approximately every week with theVery Large Array (VLA), which is run by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory(NRAO) in Datil, New Mexico. Also, we are monitoring with the GMRT in India. You takeboth instruments together, we are monitoring approximately once a week.We’ve analyzed much of that data and have not detected more radio bursts. We have beenawarded more monitoring time with the Indian telescope for the next six months into next"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"year, first part of 2007.The Very Large Array won’t be in a configuration where we can monitor with it again untillater in 2007. So, we are still monitoring, still hopeful that we will detect it, and otherobjects like that.THE NAVAL RESEARCH LAB IS NOW BUILDING THE LONG WAVELENGTHARRAY (LWA) IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE VLA?Some of its construction might be there, but it might expand beyond even into Arizona andCalifornia. And it won't be completed until perhaps 2011.Long Wavelength Array (LWA) is now under developmentby the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory, perhaps ready to listento the galactic center by 2011. Graphic courtesy VLA. Importance of Detecting Low Frequency Radio BurstsEven if we don’t detect the repeating radio bursts again and even if we never figure outwhat it is – what's important is that this research demonstrates that there are phenomenaout there, which at low frequencies, we can detect. Low frequencies are importantbecause you can observe a wide field of view and there are new instruments that are beingdeveloped at low frequencies to take advantage of that wide field of view and that willhave even higher resolution and higher sensitivity. That means many more classes oftransient radio sources will be able to be observed. So, the more we open the window up todetecting new phenomena, the more we will be able to understand and perhaps be able toput this radio source in a context that contains other discoveries at low frequencies.THIS IS BASICALLY THE FIRST TIME THAT SCIENTISTS HAVE HAD ACONCENTRATION IN VERY LOW FREQUENCIES ON THE GALACTIC CENTER?It’s been about ten years or so since the first really dedicated low frequency observationsgot underway. As far as I know, ours is the first to monitor the galactic center at lowwavelength frequencies. There are other monitoring projects with other telescopes atsomewhat higher frequencies, but they will be constrained by their field of view and otherlimitations.SETI HAS NEVER LOOKED IN THIS LOW FREQUENCY BEFORE?I’m not certain what they are using to search for extraterrestrial signals, which would bemuch more frequency-dependent. SETI is looking at particular frequencies, while we arelooking at a bandwidth of low frequencies.IS PART OF YOUR STUDENTS’ EXCITEMENT BECAUSE YOU ALL MIGHT BE ONTHE VERGE OF DISCOVERING PERHAPS ANOTHER INTELLIGENCE?No, I’d have to say not! (laughs) That’s not what’s exciting about it for us. We’re excitedabout the possibility of having detected a new natural source of radio emission that couldopen up new science – a new understanding of how our universe works. Or how compactstars emit such large bursts and the energetics involved deep within the star that causessuch events to happen."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Now, I’m not going to tell you I haven’t fantasized that it might be extraterrestrial life attimes!! (laughs) But that’s not why I had a Eureka moment. Why Doesn't Earth Pick Up Other Life Signals?IF SAGAN AND DRAKE AT CORNELL WERE RIGHT ABOUT BILLIONS OFPLANETS IN THIS UNIVERSE THAT WOULD HAVE LIFE, WHICH DOES HAVELOGIC TO IT, WHY DO YOU THINK WE HAVE NOT DISCOVERED SIGNALSCOMING FROM OTHER SOLAR SYSTEMS SOME PLACE THE WAY WE EMIT INTHE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM FROM THIS PLANET?It’s a big universe. Our instruments are too primitive. The signals, by the time they get tous, are too weak. Or not enough intelligent life. Who knows?THAT’S PROBABLY THE BIG MYSTERY, ISN’T IT?Yes. If you believe there is other intelligence out there. Of course, if you don’t believethere is other intelligent life, then it’s no mystery at all.BUT WOULDN’T THAT SEEM ILLOGICAL THAT THERE WOULD NOT BE OTHERINTELLIGENT LIFE IN THIS HUGE UNIVERSE?To me, it is. But often, you are always cautioned from extrapolating from one point. Still, Iwould agree with you.I THINK YOUR WORK IS EXCITING ON ALL FRONTS – NATURAL, OR POSSIBLYANOTHER CIVILIZATION.Thank you!
