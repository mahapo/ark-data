Andrew Kissner Return to Part 1Trouble All Over the WorldThe most controversial research finding will undoubtedly generate argument from bothproponents and skeptics of the flying disc phenomenon. But it appears that flying discsvery possibly behaved aggressively in 1947. It's also possible there was aggression beforethat year, but certainly after the May 29 detonation in Juarez, Mexico, and secondexplosion near Mt. Franklin in New Mexico.This possibly explains one reason why the U. S. government will not admit that UFOs andtheir occupants exist. Aerial events reported and explained away as the result of \"naturalcauses\" do not appear to have been \"natural\" in any respect. Have you ever wonderedwhy in all of the instances that military units have been observed in association with thisphenomena, no report has mentioned that military personnel shot at the objects? Thisauthor believes we definitely did in the summer of 1947. One of the many unansweredquestions is how long was there an American military order to shoot down the discsdescribed as \"enemy weapon systems?\"A lengthy series of mysterious and unexplainable civil and military air disasters occurredafter the May 29, 1947, Juarez incident. My research in several local and nationalnewspapers from that time period show that more than sixty U. S. Army and Navy aircraft- B-29s, B-17s, Corsairs, P-80s, P-84s, AT-6s, P-51s, C-47s, F-7s - were lost over a twomonth period beginning on May 29, 1947. One hundred twenty Army and Navy airmenwere killed and 74 others injured in these incidents. Most of those airplane accidentsoccurred over the continental United States.By June 15, 1947, President Harry Truman commissioned a blue ribbon panel of expertsheaded by Civil Aeronautics Board Chairman, James Landis and Dr. Jerome Hunsaker(MJ-7), Chairman of the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NASA) toinvestigate.On May 29, 1947, at La Guardia Field, New York, at 8:10 p.m. EST, a United AirlinesDC-4 used all of the runway to take off, but failed to gain altitude, flipped over andexploded at the end of the runway. Thirty-eight people died. It was the largest commercialairline disaster in U. S. history at that time. [ The New York Times, May 30, 1947.]In the NYT's article, an assistant New York district attorney who interviewed the injuredpilot at the hospital reported: \"He said that he tried to get it off the ground, but nothinghappened. The plane continued on through a wire fence and across a highway and crashedinto a ravine. The next thing he knew, there were flames all around him.\"Further, a reporter at the scene said: \"Flames shot fifty feet or more into the air, forming atorch that could be seen for miles. The heat from the burning gasoline in the big plane'stanks was so intense that would-be rescuers on the scene ... could not help with theirhandheld fire extinguishers.\"A subsequent Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) investigation concluded that as the pilot wastaking off and approaching 100 miles per hour:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the aircraft's engines were operating normallythe flight controls were freeall systems on the plane were functioningbut the airliner did not develop enough lift to gain altitudeAs the airplane neared the end of the runway, the pilot ordered the first officer to cut allpower while the pilot applied the brakes, but could not stop suddenly enough. The VicePresident of Operations for United Airlines said:\"A study of weather conditions which prevailed at the time indicates theprobable cause of the accident was a wind shift (change in the direction of thewind) of almost unbelievable suddenness, which changed from the southblowing at 19 mph only a few minutes before takeoff to a northwest windblowing at 23 mph.\"It is believed that a freak gust of wind, slightly in advance of an approachingsquall line, was responsible for the accident. To my knowledge, this has neverhappened before to a plane of this type; or, in fact, to any large transportplane. Take-off accidents in themselves are extremely rare. This particulartype in a transport is unheard of.\" [ Ibid.]Less than twenty hours later on May 30, 1947, an Eastern Airlines DC-4 flying aboveAberdeen Proving Ground (another U. S. Army Ordnance/OSRD test site) at Port Deposit,Maryland, crashed. Fifty-four passengers and crew members died. According toeyewitnesses, the airliner: \"...fell apart in the air and nosedived into the ground,\" explodingon impact. That second crash then became the worst U. S. commercial airline disaster atthe time.Front page, The New York Times, May 30, 1947."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Front page, The New York Times, May 31, 1947.Staff of the Civil Aeronautics Board, returning from La Guardia Field after investigatingthe earlier United Airlines crash, \"watched helplessly\" as the Eastern Airlines DC-4, flyingthree to five miles ahead of them, \"nosed down,\" crashed and exploded. CAB investigatorslanded at Aberdeen Proving Ground and rushed to the crash scene. [ Ibid.]According to an eyewitness, \"I saw the plane in a steep glide and several gleaming things,like metal, fell away from the plane as it hurtled down.\" Were those \"gleaming things\"more peculiar phenomena?In the newspapers reviewed for this manuscript, I found worldwide that twenty-nineaircraft were destroyed within 72 hours of the \"Juarez Incident\" and 198 people died.Other air crashes included:A U. S. Army Air Forces B-29 bomber which crashed around midnight at the end of therunway at Ladd Field, Alaska, on May 29, 1947, when it failed to gain altitude on take off.Three died.
