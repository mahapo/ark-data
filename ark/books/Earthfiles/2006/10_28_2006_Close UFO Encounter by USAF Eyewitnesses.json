Whenever aircraft went down, his rescue unit would be called intoaction.Al was born on August 25, 1931, so in 1953, he was twenty-two-years-old and in his thirdyear working for the USAF. He had signed up for a full twenty years and did not retire as aMaster Sergeant E-6 until December 31, 1970. [ See Retirement Order below.] From 1959to 1967, Al was in the first Astronaut Recovery Program to pull astronauts out of theCaribbean and other waters after Earth orbits or flights to the moon and back. After heretired from the USAF, Al worked in the computer industry selling and repairingcomputers and installing networks.It was around 9:30 p.m. one night in December 1953, that Something from outer spacecame close-up and intruded into the Ladd AFB military air space.Interview:Al Caldwell, 75-years-old, Retired as USAF Master Sergeant E-6 in 1970, CarlJunction, Missouri: \"We were all sitting around our table playing cards. We took turnsevery night: one flight crew would have to stay at the hangar in our quarters there all nightlong for any type of emergency. And this one December night that I was on duty there, theguard outside the hangar called upstairs and said, ‘Please come down. There is somethingout here you need to see.’So, the five of us in the flight crew ran down the stairs of the hangar and across the road.Our hangar was isolated across to one end of the base. Across the road about fifty feetfrom us was an anti-aircraft battalion. And directly above it was this object! As wewatched, the object went straight up so fast, in a fast jerky motion. Then, it stopped andcame directly over us.It was as large as our hangar (at least 100 feet in diameter). It was right above us. So, Ipicked up the phone that was on the side of the hangar and called radar across the baseand asked them if they saw this object. They said, ‘Yes, it’s over your hangar.’‘How fast did it come in?’‘We could not estimate it, it was so fast. So, we’re scrambling our jets. At that time in1953, we only had F-86s.This object would just sit there, solid black in the center. The outside ring, which wasrotating, was colors like light green, yellow and orange and some blue. Really beautiful!"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Unidentified round, fiery aerial craft estimated at 150 feet in diameterwhich moved so rapidly that radar operators said they could not estimate its speed.Drawing by Al Caldwell of the craft that hovered motionless and silent rightabove the Ladd AFB hangar, Fairbanks, Alaska, in December 1953.The center was black, solid black. Then it had the outside ring, which was fiery goingaround it in different colors. The colors were like bluish, yellowish, orangish and greenish.Those are the colors I can most vividly remember. There was no noise to it at all.WHEN YOU COMPARE IT TO FIRE, CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT?Maybe like on the tail end of a rocket. I’ve seen missiles come back into the Earth. Whenthey come back, they are different colors than they are down on the ground. It’s a lightergreenish glow to them instead of red fire. It was not like red fire. It was high intensity heattype.WOULD IT BE THAT THE FIRE WAS MOVING RAPIDLY IN ROTATION?Oh, yes, it was going around very fast.YOU MIGHT SAY THAT THIS WAS LIKE A LOT OF DIFFERENT COLORED LIGHTSTHAT WERE SPINNING SO QUICKLY THAT THEY BLENDED TOGETHER INTO AFIERY LOOK?That’s possible. I had not thought of that.IN OTHER WORDS, WHAT WAS PRODUCING THE LIGHT?That’s what I don’t know unless it was what they used for their power. While we wereunderneath this object, all of us in the flight crew could not hear any sound from thisobject. But the feeling it put on us was so peaceful and we were just in awe! It was sopeaceful being underneath it and looking at it.When the jets went down the runway, the object went up real fast and stopped and tiltedat like a 45-degree angle. When the jets got their wheels up, they would go through a rightangle turn. Before they completed their circle to come back up, this object took off andwent and disappeared straight up into the sky, into the stars. USAF Investigators Try to Force Natural ExplanationThe very next day, the USAF investigators came and took us and divided us up intodifferent rooms and interrogated us one at a time over and over, trying to make us admit itwas the aurora borealis Northern Lights or ice fog or whatever. Anything they could pin iton besides what it really was, a UFO.But we said, ‘Nope, we know what we saw and we were there.’"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"They brought us out altogether and told us, ‘We can’t break your story. You’re all stickingto the same story. But we’re going to warn you. You will not talk about this to anyone foreight years, or you will be in a lot of trouble.’ Threatened us like that.WHY DO YOU THINK EIGHT YEARS? THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN 1961.I have no idea. I often wondered why they picked eight years. I don’t know.DID ANYBODY IN THE DEBRIEFING USE THE WORD ‘EXTRATERRESTRIAL,’‘INTERPLANETARY,’ ‘UFO FROM OUTER SPACE,’ OR ANY PHRASE LIKE THAT?They didn’t. But we did. We used it, UFO, as we told them what we saw.WHEN YOU USED THE WORD UFO, WHAT DID THE DEBRIEFERS - WHO WERETRYING TO BREAK DOWN YOUR STORY - SAY?They said, ‘No, you don’t know what it was. It was something else. It had to be clouds orice fog or something else. It wasn’t what you think it was, not UFOs.WHEN YOU SAID, ‘RADAR WAS MONITORING AND RADAR CONFIRMED THATTHIS OBJECT CAME IN AT A SPEED SO FAST THEY COULD NOT DETERMINE’ –WHAT DID THE DEBRIEFER SAY?They just looked at us. Also, we told them that when the UFO left, radar said the samething, they could not estimate the speed of it because it was so fast. The investigatorswould just ignore us. They didn’t want to acknowledge anything we were telling them.IN OTHER WORDS, THEY WERE DETERMINED BECAUSE THEY HAD ANOTHERAGENDA TO MAKE THE INTERVIEW WITH YOU ALL AGREE TO SOME OTHERSTORY BECAUSE THEY WERE UNDER ORDERS, APPARENTLY, IN A POLICY OFDENIAL.Yes, they wanted to discredit us, to make us change our story and make us say we did notsee what we saw.BUT THE EIGHT OF YOU STUCK TOGETHER?Oh, yeah! We were so close to that thing. It was right above us! You know how big anaircraft hangar is? Well, the UFO was about twice the size of a hangar. And it was as big asour hangar. We were right under it! It must have been there for five minutes.FIVE MINUTES YOU WERE UNDER IT?Sure. Long enough to talk to radar across the field.WHAT DID YOU ESTIMATE THE LENGTH AND WIDTH OF THE HANGAR WAS?We could put a C-54 in it, so it must have been at least 100 feet long.YOU’RE LOOKING AT A UFO THAT WAS LARGER THAN 100 FEET INDIAMETER?Oh, yeah, maybe 150 feet in diameter.DO YOU REMEMBER THE QUESTIONS THE INVESTIGATORS ASKED?They asked over and over: What did you see from beginning to end? We told them exactlywhat I just told you and the fact that I picked up the phone and called over to radar andtried to get an estimate on the speed. What radar had told us. We told them what it lookedlike and how we felt while we were underneath it. They just kept trying to make us say itwas something else, anything other than what we saw.I can definitely say it was no ice fog and there were no northern lights that night. It wasclear. It could not have been anything else (other than UFO). It wouldn’t even come closeto being an aurora borealis.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Retirement Order relieving Al Caldwell from active duty on December 31, 1970,after twenty years of service in the U.
