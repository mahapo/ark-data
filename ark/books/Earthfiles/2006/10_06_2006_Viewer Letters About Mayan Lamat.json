Estimated diameter is about 300 feet.Aerial image © 2006 by Cropcircleconnector.com.1) October 5, 2006Email from Australian scientist who requests anonymity: \"Etchilhampton Hillseems to show some kind of space-time grid from general relativity. By thatinterpretation, its four-fold symmetric star-shape could be interpreted to illustrate agravity-wave vibration, which has two degrees of freedom as \"up-down\" or \"left-right\" (that is, vertical or horizontal).Similarly the round white circle, which is shown below that four-fold star, could bemeant to illustrate how space and time will vibrate due to a passing gravity wave, nearan originally round planet such as Earth.Finally, its construction date of August 14, 2006 could possibly be one year before areal impact date of August 14, 2007, but only if the crop artists have a symbolic logicresembling our own, which is not certain.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------How might Etchilhampton Hill of August 2006 relate to previous Mayan-type croppictures?Recall that Wayland's Smithy of August 2005 showed two sets of base-16 hexadecimalnumbers as \"13-10-7\" and \"14-5-11\".If we choose to interpret those numbers as \"calendar dates\" (an idea first suggested byJaime Maussan) within the current 52-year Mayan calendar system, starting on Dec.21-22, 1960 and ending on Dec. 21-22, 2012, then we can translate those base-16numbers into our modern calendar by simple calculator math:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"0-0-0 = Dec. 21, 196016-0-0 = Dec. 21, 201213-10-7 = May 1-4, 2005 (first crop picture of the 2005 season at Golden Ball Hill)14-5-11 = August 13-16, 2007 (same as August 14 for Etchilhampton Hill of 2006, butadd one year exactly)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------To make this clear, let us show the latter calculation in detail.For \"14-5-11\" in base-16, we first need to obtain a fraction of the 52-year period asfollows:14 /16 + 5 / (16*16 ) + 11 / (16*16*16) = 0.87500 + 0.01953 + 0.00269 = 0.89722,which is a fraction of 52 years between December 1960 and December 2012.Further calculations then show that 0.89722 x 52 = 46.655 years since the startingdate of December 21-22, 1960.First we add 46 years to December 21-22, 1960 to get December 21-22, 2006.Next we add 0.655 years = 239 days to December 21-22, 2006 to get approximatelyAugust 15, 2007.[ Note that three base-16 numbers in 52 years only give a modern date accurate to fivedays.]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The 52-year Mayan period represents a regular periodic motion of the Sun and Venus.One Mayan Sun equals exactly 5200 \"years\" of 360 days each (as shown at SilburyHill in 2004).Then we take (360 / 365.25) x 5200 to get 5125.26 years of 365.25 days each. Dec.21, 2012 AD (2011.95) minus 5125.26 then gives 3113.3 BC, or 3114.3 BC sincethere is no \"year zero.\"How do we know that the Mayan 52-year calendar, based on motions of the Sun andVenus through our sky, was the proper choice?Well, it was illustrated symbolically at Silbury Hill in August 2004; and a series of\"Mayan glyphs\" were shown around the outer part of Wayland's Smithy in August2005.Finally, the central \"crescent\" of Wayland's Smithy 2005 showed only 15% remaining,which was nearly correct for August 2005 as a fraction of 52 years spanning 1960 to2012. In other words, (2012-2005) / 52 = 7 / 52 = 0.134.[ See Earthfiles Archived reports below for images and more information.]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thus we see a strong logical connectivity of all three August patterns over threesuccessive years from 2004 to 2006.One of the most interesting aspects of this crop-circle logic is that those 52-yearcalendar periods refer to periodic motions of the Sun and Venus as seen from Earth,and not in a Sun-centered frame of reference.If they were not made by local human fakers (of a mathematical nature), then howcould the crop artists possibly be 'aliens'? They could instead be humans from our ownpast, or maybe from our own future? Time-travel through wormholes makes all thingspossible, even apparent contradictions involving causality.'You do not understand the basic nature of time. There is no present without the past,and no future without the present.' Those words were written by Ursula LeGuin in hergreat novel The Dispossessed, where her character Shevek invents a new theory oftime that makes faster-than-light communication possible.That was considered wildly speculative when she wrote the book, but today we call it'quantum teleportation,' and it is discussed in leading scientific journals such as Nature."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Who can say whether advanced scientists on Earth will eventually invent some newtechnology, which will enable them to send messages back in time, by makingcomplex patterns in summer crops? We see motifs there which are all too human, andoften not 'alien' at all: Celtic symbols, Buddhist symbols, Jewish symbols, or evenhighly-coded warnings about the near future.Simply by waiting for another 11 months, we should be able to learn whether thosepatterns are being made by local humans from our own time, or else by humans fromsome other reality?If any readers would like to study those crop patterns further, to obtain a possiblymore accurate or revised date from Etchilhamton Hill 2006 and Wayland's Smithy2005 (see also Wayland's Smithy 2006), then any sincere, well-thought-out effortswould be welcome. By drawing open pictures in crops, their messages are meant forall of us: not for any particular country or tribe, but for all of us.\" 2) October 5, 2006Ted Robertson, Harpsichord Maker and Independent Crop Circle ResearchAssoc. (ICCRA) Investigator, Indiana: \"That particular star formation has been oneof my favorites this year and just from the looks of it alone I thought it one that isprobably authentic. It does look like Venus now that you mentioned it. The paths beingso narrow and straight, so elegant and the design itself gives a “positive” feel to it.Another thing too is that for me the octave represents a completion and a resting point.This seems congruent with the Mayan symbol of eight the Lamat. The eight for acompletion of scale containing only diatonic tones while the thirteen – also mentionedas the long count with 13 baktuns represent another way of looking at the harmonicscale when it includes all the half steps ( includes the non-diatonic notes as well). Andso twelve different tones are the number of notes counted in a chromatic scale whenon note thirteen one reaches the octave again.So both 8 and 13 represent to me completion ( the octave) where the notes countedend on an octave the first using the diatonic scale and the second using the chromaticscale.I do think that the Lamat is an excellent interpretation of this crop circle and this inthe light of all the other Mayan glyphs seems very likely.\"More Information:For further information about Mayan and Aztec-related crop formations, please see reports belowin the Earthfiles Archives.
