A rapidly spreading fungal disease is predictedto wipe out about half the world’s frogs, toads, newts and salamanders by the end of thisyear. Andrew Blaustein, a zoology professor at Oregon State University, says, “Species aregoing extinct very fast. These are bio indicators that something is wrong with the planet.”The Australian Government Department of Environment reports, \"Chytridiomycosis is aninfectious disease that affects amphibians worldwide. It is caused by the chytrid fungus(Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis), a fungus capable of causing sporadic deaths in someamphibian populations and 100% mortality in others. The disease has been implicated inthe mass die-offs and species extinctions of frogs in the past 15 years, but its origin and itstrue impact on populations remain uncertain and are under investigation.Frog infected with Chytridiomycosis.Eyelids droop and skin deteriorates.\"First discovered in dead and dying frogs in Queensland in 1993, chytridiomycosis is ahighly infectious disease of amphibians, caused by the amphibian chytrid fungusBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Research since then has shown that the fungus iswidespread across Australia and has been present in the country since at least 1978. It isalso found in Africa, the Americas, Europe, New Zealand and Oceania.\" Amazon Rainforest Threatened by DroughtSevere drought has been affecting the world’s largest rainforest in the Amazon of Brazilfor the second year. Some scientists warn that “global warming and deforestation arepushing the entire enormous area towards a tipping point, where the rainforest could startto die.” Tree and plant deaths in the Amazon rainforest could release huge volumes ofcarbon dioxide into the Earth’s atmosphere, making greenhouse warming even worse.Boats in July 2006 where Amazon waters have dried up in second yearof severe drought.

Even more dramatically, several hundred shearwaters fell dying ordead onto a crabbing boat in Unalaska Bay. Seabird specialist, Art Sowls, from the AlaskaMaritime National Wildlife Refuge, told authorities that shearwaters can move in flocks ofmore than a million birds at a time. Sooty shearwaters migrate nearly 40,000 miles (64,000kilometers) a year, flying from New Zealand to the North Pacific Ocean every summer insearch of food, according to a new study.Art Sowls wondered if the seabirds might be suffering from starvation. A few of the deadbirds are undergoing necropsies and Art Sowls told me he hopes to have lab results backby mid-September. If the answer is starvation, could it be related to the rapidly warmingArctic climate that is causing permafrost to melt and forcing animals and their ecosystemsto keep moving north in order to find familiar food sources? Siberia and Arctic Permafrost MeltingThis si nk hol e recentl y near Fairbanks, Al aska, formed due to the melti ngof a large ice pocket within permafrost that is gradually thawing as temperatures warm.Photo courtesy Vladimir Romanovsky, Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska Fairbanks.Now this week in the September 7, 2006, issue of the journal Nature, Prof. Katey Walterfrom the University of Alaska at Fairbanks published data that shows the Arcticpermafrost – especially in Siberia – is melting faster - and releasing five times moremethane - than originally calculated. Methane is another greenhouse gas, but can trap heat23 times more powerfully than carbon dioxide because methane absorbs solar radiation ina different spectrum than CO2."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"University of Alaska at Fairbanks researcher Katey Walter, Ph.D.,conducting methane measurements on one of the study lakes September 2005 in Siberia.A new more accurate measuring technique was used on the bubbling methane, which is23 times more powerful a greenhouse gas than the more prevalent carbon dioxide.\"The effects can be huge,\" said Walter, the lead author of a study in the Thursday,Sept. 7, 2006, issue of the journal Nature. \"It's coming out a lot and there's alot more to come out.\" Photo © 2005 by AP/Dmitri Draluk.What exactly is permafrost? When the last Ice Age glaciers were around some 20,000years ago, dust and organic material got blown around on the soil in Siberia and Arctictundra. The dust and organic material built up to at least 80 feet thick where it has beenfrozen ever since. Until this new modern era of global warming.Regions containing permafrost within the top 11 feet of soilcould decrease by as much as 90% across the Arctic over the next century,based on simulations by the NCAR Community Climate System Model. Shown areareas with near-surface permafrost in the CCSM simulations for 1980-1999 (light blue)and 2080-2099 (dark blue). The latter projection is based on the IntergovernmentalPanel on Climate Change's A1B emissions scenario, often called the \"business asusual\" scenario. Image courtesy David Lawrence.As the Earth warms up, the permafrost soils begin to melt and become wet. Microbes startto eat the carbon-rich organic material and use up oxygen as they consume the carbon.The result is that the carbon in the watery permafrost gets converted to methane, which isCH4. That’s one carbon molecule and four hydrogen molecules. That methane gas from allthe carbon-digesting microbes bubbles up through melted water on the surface ofpermafrost and into the atmosphere. The warmer the Earth gets, the faster the permafrostmelts, the more methane is added to the atmosphere, the thicker the methane and carbondioxide blanket around the Earth becomes, which heats up Earth even more. Scientists callit a “positive feedback” cycle and methane could threaten the world’s future climate evenmore by accelerating global heating.One atmospheric scientist, who spent twelve years studying global warming computermodels at Lawrence-Livermore Laboratory in California, is now a staff scientist at theCarnegie Institution’s Department of Global Ecology in Stanford University. He is KenCaldiera, Ph.D. This week he explained that the Earth’s permafrost is supposed to have atleast 900 billion tons of methane. That’s 150 tons of methane for every man, woman andchild in the 6 ½ billion people on our planet. The fact that the Ice Age soils are nowsuddenly melting in more volume and speed than anyone ever expected disturbs Dr.Caldiera greatly.Interview:"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Ken Caldeira, Ph.D., Staff Scientist, Carnegie Institution, Department of GlobalEcology, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California: “The frozen ground is 80 feet thickon average in Siberia. So, as soon as you heat the planet to a certain extent, it’s like wehave a fuse burning down into the permafrost and releasing methane as it goes. So, whatwe might be doing over the next decades potentially could push us back some kind oftipping point where that would result in the release of most, or all of, the methane inpermafrost soils.IS THERE ANY COMPUTER SIMULATION ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TOSURFACE LIFE IF ALL THE METHANE WERE RELEASED?In our computer simulations of just fossil fuel burning without methane, we gettemperature increases in the Arctic region of 20 degrees Celsius warming (68 degrees F.).When you get that kind of warming, definitely the methane will go (from permafrostmelting). We’re looking at the kind of planet that has not existed for 50 million years.GOING BACK TO THE DINOSAURS, REALLY.Yes, or maybe the period shortly after the dinosaurs. But certainly what we’re doing to thisplanet is unusual even when viewed from a geologic perspective. For example, currentdata suggests that the Earth has never had more greenhouses gases in its atmosphere as ithas now for at least 20 to 25 million years – and possibly 50 million years.The other thing is that both the carbon dioxide - and methane after it converts to carbondioxide – dissolves into the oceans. CO2 when it dissolves into seawater makes the oceanmore acidic and can prevent marine organisms from building their shells and skeletons. Sowe are looking at a wide array of potential environmental catastrophes that we barelyunderstand.AND ARE REALLY COMING UPON US QUICKLY.Yes, I think there is a sense of urgency. Katey Walter and her co-workers (Univ. of Alaska,Fairbanks) did a very thorough job of sampling the methane bubbles that were coming upthrough the lakes that formed in the permafrost. As the permafrost melts, the ice wasturning to water and forming lakes. They (scientists) would put little devices to measurethe bubbles and measure the amount of methane coming out. They did a samplingtechnique where they had some of the bubbling bubble catchers distributed randomly andsome distributed over hot spots where they saw bubbles coming out vigorously.By having the random sampling component, they could make better extrapolations fromtheir measurements to what the average methane release was over the lakes. Then theywere able to use satellite photographs and other aerial type materials to understand the sizeof these lakes have been growing over time. The main advance that gave them the higherestimate was a more thorough and careful set of measurements of the methane bubblingout of the water.HOW SURPRISED ARE YOU AND OTHER SCIENTISTS THAT YOU KNOW THATWITH THIS MORE THOROUGH MEASYUREMENT THAT IT IS NOW APPARENTLYCLEAR THAT FIVE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF METHANE IS BEING RELEASED?I look at this new methane data as a disturbing early harbinger that maybe things might beworse than our global warming models predict. I mean this is coming up repeatedly. Therewere models of how much sea ice should melt back as a result of global warming and thesatellite observations show that sea ice in the Arctic is melting back much faster thanpreviously assumed. There is other evidence that Greenland is melting faster than a lot ofmodels predicted. Here we have observations that suggest the permafrost is melting andreleasing its methane faster than we had thought.So, there is a whole series of observations where things are looking worse than had beenanticipated before. It’s getting to the point where finding out things are worse than youthought is no longer surprising – that there seems to be a general trend of results thatsuggest that the early ideas about what the effects would be of global warming would behave turned out to be rather optimistic outlooks on the future.IF THE METHANE FEEDBACK BEGINS TO ACCELERATE BECAUSE OF GLOBALWARMING, WHAT IS THE WORST CASE IF THIS NOW FIVE TIMES AS MUCHMETHANE AS THEY THOUGHT KEEPS INCREASING OVER THE NEXT QUARTERCENTURY? WHAT IS THE WORST CASE FOR SURFACE LIFE WITH THIS MUCHMETHANE BEING ADDED TO THE BLANKET AROUND THE EARTH?If current emission trends continue, the temperature bands – you can think of it as theEarth warms in bands of climate or temperature moving toward the poles. Already thosebands are moving ten to twenty feet per day on average and under middle of the road kind"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"of emission scenarios, those bands start moving 30 feet per day toward the poles.Maybe it will end up being 40 or 45 feet a day and ecosystems need to move to keep upwith their climate zones. And it’s obvious that oak trees and other sedentary organismscannot move that fast to keep up with climate change. So, what will happen is thatorganisms will die off in climate zones they are no longer adapted to. Invasive species willcome in and occupy those ecological niches.So, I think what we will see is a replacement of the complex life that has developed overmany millennia and millions of years and be replaced by a much weedier world. I think thefuture will be a great place for weeds and we will see a much weedier world.People say, ‘Hasn’t climate changed in the past?’ If you look at the change from the glacialtime to after the Ice Age ended, the current climate is changing about 100 times faster thanit changed during the end of the glacial time. Carbon dioxide is increasing in theatmosphere about 100 times faster than it did in the last Ice Age.My perspective is that we are so far – our industrial society has so overwhelmed naturalemissions (of CO2) that we are far outside the capacity of the natural system to keep upwith the rate of change that we are asking Earth to undergo.DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE NUMBERS OF EXTINCTIONS WILL BE EVENGREATER THAN HAS BEEN PROJECTED?Yes. The ecosystems will have to move towards the poles at 30 feet a day in order to keepup with the climate change. First, that’s hard enough to do if you have a complete band ofnatural vegetation going from the equator to the poles. But in real life, that ecosystem hasto cross roads and farm roads and cities and towns and then ump to some other placewhere it could possibly adapt to the new climate. If you take that oak tree that has anacorn that depends on a squirrel to run and bury that acorn somewhere. So maybe if thelifetime of that oak tree is 50 years and that squirrel can run a few hundred feet with thenut, it might be able to move a few hundred feet in 50 years.That’s why I think what we are likely to see in the future is a world of weeds where weedsreplace the kind of complex ecosystems that are more common today.IS THERE ANYTHING THAT COULD BE DONE NOW THAT COULD EFFECT, ORSTOP, THE TIPPING POINT IN THE INCREASING METHANE RELEASE?OK, I think there are two basic strategies. The first strategy involves just diminishinggreatly CO2 emissions, which requires a transformation of our energy systems.The other possibility that has been discussed, although nobody has published detailedcalculations about it is it might be able to inject aerosols in the stratosphere to block somesunlight and engineer our climate to prevent additional Arctic warming – or even cool theArctic.It’s one thing to add CO2 into the system and inadvertently be changing climate. Thepolitics, ethics and wisdom of purposefully engineering our climate is a far more dubiousmatter. But it looks like it would be within our technical capability to engineer our climatedirectly. The question is: Do we have the wisdom to actually do that without creating evenbigger problems.IF WE DON’T DO EITHER, WHAT IS THE WORST CASE FOR THE FUTURE WITHMETHANE BUILDING UP?Nobody can really predict the future. But I think.. to me it looks like we are pushing ourplanet into territory it has not been for many tens of millions of years. When you give theplanet that hard a knock, I don’t think anybody can accurately predict what is going tohappen. OUT: “Nobody can really predict the future. But to me it looks like we are pushing ourplanet into territory it has not been for many tens of millions of years. When you give theplanet that hard a knock, I don’t think anybody can accurately predict what is going tohappen.” Climate Models Must Now Be Changedto Add New Methane DataOne of the most surprising facts I learned from Dr. Caldeira is that neither of the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"atmospheric computer models at the National Center for Atmospheric Research inBoulder, Colorado, nor the Lawrence-Livermore Laboratory in Livermore, California,have included increasing methane emissions in their atmospheric calculations.Solutions to slowing down global warming include curtailing dependence on fossil fuelgreenhouse emissions. This week former astronaut and U. S. Senator from New Mexico,Harrison Schmitt, told lawyers at an Albuquerque Bar Association meeting that we needquickly to get back to the moon to ensure humanity’s energy future. He explained that inthe dust on the moon is an element called Helium-3. There’s enough helium-3 on the moonto feed little sun-like fusion reactors on Earth for the foreseeable future. Senator Schmittsays there is already a political context that would allow mining helium-3 for a globalenergy system. That is the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 between the United States and theSoviet Union. That treaty prohibited nuclear weapons or military bases on the moon. Italso prohibits any nation from claiming the moon or other celestial bodies as territory. Butthat 1967 treaty would not prohibit a private company from going to the moon to minehelium-3.Competition for lunar resources will soon begin as nations such as Japan, China, India,Russia and the United States all plan to be back on the moon in this coming decade.Meanwhile, in another ten years, how much of the Amazon forest will have died or beencleared away - releasing tons of carbon dioxide into the Earth’s atmosphere? How muchpermafrost will have melted releasing tons of methane into the Earth’s atmosphere? Howmuch warmer will the Earth be? How ferocious will storms be? And how many species willbe forever gone from the air, the water and the lands of our planet?More Information:For further information about global warming, please see the reports below in theEarthfiles Archives:• 08/23/2006 -- Solar Cycle 24 - Headed for Intense X Flares by 2010-2012?• 08/19/2006 -- Repair of Earth's Ozone Layer Has Slowed• 07/18/2006 -- 2006 - Hottest Year So Far in U.
