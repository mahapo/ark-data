Military and intelligence teams such as Project MOONDUST, Project, POUNCE and Project STORKwere (perhaps still are?) involved in disc and EBE crash retrievals since at least 1941 in Cape Girardeau,Missouri. Those teams have also been involved in operations beyond crash retrievals. [ See: Earthfiles12/28/02 and Earthfiles 01/14/03.] Back in 1986, I was based in the Washington, D. C. area as a contracted producer-writer-director-editor for apublic broadcasting series about chemistry. My program responsibility was about the \"mole,\" which is used tocount atoms. It's a very big number, six followed by twenty-three zeroes, and is also known as Avogadro'sNumber. The challenge was to tell a story that could explain the application of moles in chemistry in as visualand interesting way possible. Part of the story took place in a large chemical plant in North Carolina where thecrew and I went for production. After the first day back at our lodging, I was sitting alone at an outdoor tablew o r ki ng o n my s c r i pt. A ta l l ma n c a me to my ta b l e a nd s a i d my ful l na me , \" Li nd a Mo ul to n How e , \" no t a s aquestion, but as a statement. He asked if he could sit down. Curious, I said, \"Yes.\" Without establishing any background or context for himself except to say I could call him \"Dan,\" heimmediately went to the subject of worldwide animal mutilations and the documentary television program Ihad produced, A Strange Harvest, which was first broadcast on May 28, 1980, at KMGH-TV in Denver,Colorado, where I had been Director of Special Projects. His comments indicated he had firsthand knowledgeabout extraterrestrial biological entities that were the mutilators, or \"food and gene harvesters,\" as he put it. Then he said something like, \"Everyone fantasizes that E.T.s would be like Spielberg's film with the funny,harmless guy who has a glowing finger and could sit down over coffee, or a beer, and teach us about theuni verse. [ Close Encounters of the Third Kind by Steven Spielberg, 1977.] But you need to know that'snever going to happen and there's good reason for the government clamp-down on all this.\" Then he told me about his own remarkable experience which I will share here and at Dreamland Online,without any proof. There has been resonance to Dan's description by a few people in the human abductionsyndrome that I've told, i ncl udi ng Whitley Strieber. Dan said the time was the mid-1970s and he was working for MJ-12 (Majestic-12, see website below) onmatters concerning extraterrestrial activities. The location was a small town in Arizona that had a watersupply held by a dam. His unit received word that the dam had been broken for reasons unknown by EBEsdescribed as \"Nordics,\" or \"Blonds.\" He said that the blond-haired, blue-eyed humanoids were the mostenigmatic and most difficult to communicate with directly. Dan acknowledged there were at least three mainextraterrestrial groups interacting with Earth: the human-sized, blond humanoids; the small, grey-skinned andlarge black-eyed entities most reported in human abduction cases; and another humanoid type that looked likea \"standing-up lizard.\" His assignment was to travel with a small team to the Arizona town to investigate in a confidential andclassified manner what had happened. Further, since there was no way to ask the blond humanoids why theyhad broken the dam, he understood that someone up the chain of command was trying to establish contact withthe Grey EBEs. Dan said, \"For a long time, we have been able to monitor Hertz frequencies from a variety ofcraft and have some of them classified as belonging to certain E.T. types. Sometimes we've gotten help fromthe Greys when we've sent out a specific signal. And that's what someone did - got Greys to help us figure outwhat was going on.\" Dan said in Arizona one of his superior officers came to him and said it was time he knew what it's like to bearound \"one of these guys.\" So, a demonstration was arranged with a Grey entity that had either shown up inresponse to the signal call, or was transported from some place already in the United States. Dan did notknow. He said it was explained to him that the Grey entities knew that humans \"freak out\" if the Greys float above theground, which Dan was told is their preference. He did not know, or did not explain to me, if it wasmind-over-matter or a technology. But the Grey entity had agreed to keep its feet on the ground as it movedtoward Dan for close-up communication. It w as explained to Dan exactly where the Grey being would appear several yards away, how it wouldawkwardly walk on the ground to about four feet in front of Dan with its head down, and when it raised itshead and made eye contact, the communication would begin. Dan was told it would be a telepathic downloadand upload to and from his brain and that the experience would be overwhelming. Dan was also told toimagine someone standing in front of him with acid or a flame thrower. The very cells in Dan's body wouldwant to run away, he explained - \"cellular fear\" beyond his own mind because whatever the Grey entities giveoff, it's so completely alien that it's difficult for a human to remain conscious and rational. I remember Dan laughing as he said, \"I didn't believe it. I'm a big man. It's an approved situation. Why should Ibe scared of anything?\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" The grey entity appeared exactly where Dan's superior told him it would and began to move awkwardly alongthe ground toward him. Dan compared the Grey entity's motion to \"Donald Duck walking in a cartoon.\" Hesaid he remembered thinking the experience would be a \"piece of cake.\" But when the Grey entity got to aboutsix or eight feet from where Dan was standing, the \"big man\" felt his knees begin to shake. Dan said he was soshocked that his body was responding, he almost did move away. But he knew that his superior and colleagueswere standing off to his left somew here watching. \"The only thing that kept me there was that I did not w ant toembarrass myself in front of them.\" When the 5-foot-high Grey was only about four feet away, Dan was looking down at the top of the grey head.He wondered if something like extraterrestrial pheromones were coming off the non-human creature that madehim feel such panic, like he wanted to faint? Then the Grey's head slowly began lifting upward. Dan said w hen he saw the big, black, almond-shaped eyes,instantly inside his mind w ere \"seven feature films all running at the same time with sound, smell, temperature,feeling - and in 3-D! On top of the 3-D films, there were gold-colored, 3-D symbols that kind of floated abovethe films.\" Dan said he could feel his mind trying to ask questions, but he had no control over w hat was happening. As hishuman mind tried to question, the films would branch off as if \"answering without my asking.\" Whatever washappening in his human brain w as provoking changes in the massive dow nload the Grey was putting in Dan'sbrain. Dan said he also felt like everything he had ever experienced and knew was simultaneously going intothe Grey's mind. I remember Dan saying, \"That alien told me a lot about where it comes from and what theyare doing here, but I couldn't tell you or anybody. It w as all a huge jumble.\" Then the Grey being lowered its head. The download/upload ended and Dan was collapsing to the ground. Heremembered the feel of human arms catching him as he fell. His colleagues had been waiting for the collapsebecause they had seen it before. He had to lay down afterward. There is a huge irony in hearing a military man describe face-to-face communication with an extraterrestrialbiological entity that left only mental blanks, confusion and a memory of his own body's fear. And Dan neverlearned why the other extraterrestrials, the blond ones, had broken a dam in Arizona.
