Is It A Rare Magnetar? © 2006 by Linda Moulton Howe \"Spitzer (infrared telescope) came along and showed us this exploded star,one of the most intensively studied objects in the sky, is still undergoing death throesbefore heading to its final grave.\" - Oliver Krause, Ph.D., University of Arizona April 22, 2006 Pasadena, California - The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena reported this week thatNASA's Spitzer Space Telescope has made accidental and surprising infrared images of light echoes from astar that was supposed to have died 325 years ago in a supernova explosion. But the new infrared informationindicates Cassiopeia has released \"at least one burst of energy as recently as fifty years ago\" from its cosmicgrave 11,000 light-years from Earth. Oliver Krause, Ph.D., at the University of Arizona's Astronomy Department in Tucson, explained: \"We hadthought the stellar remains inside Cassiopeia A were just fading away. Spitzer (infrared telescope) came alongand showed us this exploded star, one of the most intensively studied objects in the sky, is still undergoingdeath throes before heading to its final grave.\" The echo of an energy burst is the first witnessed around a long-dead star and the largest ever seen. Anotherastronomer at UA, George Rieke, Ph.D., said, \"We had no idea that Spitzer would ever see light echoes.Sometimes you just trip over the biggest discoveries.\"These Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) infrared images were taken one year apart on November 30, 2003,and December 2, 2004. The yellow center is the supernova remnant of the dying star, Cassiopeia Aand surrounding reddish-orange clouds of dust."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"This false-color image made by three different wavebands of light, shows the many sidesof the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant. Image credit: SST and NASA. NASA reports that, \"A supernova remnant like Cassiopeia A typically consists of an outer , shimmering shellof expelled material and a core skeleton of a once-massive star called a neutron star. Neutron stars come inseveral varieties, ranging from intensely active to silent. \"The new infrared echo indicates the Cassiopeia A neutron star is active and might even be an exotic, spastictype of object called a 'magnetar.' Magnetars are like screaming dead stars, with eruptive surfaces that ruptureand quake, pouring out tremendous amounts of high-energy gamma rays. Spitzer might have captured the'shriek' of such a star in the form of light zipping away through space and heating up its surroundings.\" Astronomer Rieke says, \"Magnetars are very rare and hard to study, especially if they are no longer associatedwith their place of origin. If we have indeed uncovered one, then it will be just about the only one for whichwe know what kind of star it came from and when.\" Cassiopeia A is the youngest known supernova remnant in our Milky Way Galaxy, and the strongest extrasolarradio source in the sky. Calculating its expansion back, astronomers have found that the supernova must haveblown up around the year 1667. Strangely, it was not widely noticed by that epoch's astronomers. However, asastronomy historian, William Ashwort, found out in 1980, it was perhaps observed by John Flamsteed onAugust 16, 1680, who cataloged a star near its position as \"3 Cassiopeiae.\" However, he did not recognize itas a supernova, or \"New Star,\" and simply cataloged it as an ordinary star.
