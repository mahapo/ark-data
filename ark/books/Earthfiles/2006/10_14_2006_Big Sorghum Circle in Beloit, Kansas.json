There are only two reports that are larger.\"- Jeffrey Wilson, Director, ICCRA Beloit, Kansas is northwest of Herington and Lost Springs, Kansas,the site of two wheat circles reported on June 2, 2006. Beloit is also about70 mi les northw est of the U. S. Army's Fort Ril ey in Manhattan, Kansas.October 14, 2006 Beloit, Kansas - Four months ago, I reported about two circlessuddenly showing up on June 2, 2006, in a wheat field owned by Merle and Diane Ecklundin Lost Springs, Kansas, which is a bit south of Herington and north of Wichita. [ See061106 Earthfiles.] Both circles were estimated to be about 28-feet in diameter.Biophysicist W. C. Levengood examined wheat from both circles and found fundamentalbiophysical and biochemical changes in the plants that he hypothesizes could only haveresulted from interaction with a spinning vortex of plasma and other energies.Now, again in Kansas, a very large single circle was discovered around 11 a.m. on themorning of Saturday, September 9, 2006, along Highway 9 in Beloit, Kansas. Beloit isabout 90 miles northwest of Lost Springs.

She saidthey were growing Haygrazer sorghum to be harvested for cattle feed. She drove back andforth from her home in Beloit about three times a day right by the field. She said theredefinitely was no circle there on Friday, September 8, at 6 p.m. It rained all day Friday andall night until Saturday morning when the circle was first seen. There were no paths ortracks leading to the large circle in 7-foot-high sorghum that was more than 100 feet fromthe road.On September 15, six days after the discovery, Ted Robertson of the Independent CropCircle Research Association (ICCRA), traveled eleven hours by car from his Indiana hometo investigate. He was joined by Rich Webb of MUFON and ICCRA. Ted had also beenwith me in my investigation of the July 17, 2006, 5-circle soybean formation in Geneseo,Illinois. [ See: 082706 Earthfiles.] By now, Ted has investigated at least thirty cropformations in the United States and I talked with him recently about the Beloit circle."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Inside the Beloit, Kansas, sorghum circle on September 16, 2006.On left, Rich Webb of MUFON and ICCRA.

Big! 133 feet. It looked impressive from the road, pretty substantial. It’sat least 100 or so feet into the field. So, it’s not exactly right next to the road. And I wasalso struck by the height – it looks like corn, but it’s actually Haygrazer, which is a varietyof sorghum.HOW TALL WAS THIS CROP?I’m 5 foot 7 1/2 inches. And the seed heads were at least 7 ½ feet. Some areas were tallerthan others. It ranged in height from like 4.5 feet to maybe 7.5 feet.Local farmer standing next to 7-foot-tall sorghum plants inBeloit, Kansas, circle on September 17, 2006.Image © 2006 by Ted Robertson.SO, YOU WERE APPROACHING A CIRCLE IN WHICH MANY OF THE PLANTSWERE TALLER THAN YOU ARE?Yes, and it’s kind of a neat feeling.FROM BOTH THE AERIAL PHOTOS AND THE PHOTOS YOU TOOK FROM THEHILL ACROSS THE ROAD, YOU WOULD NEVER GUESS THAT IT WAS THATHIGH.We really did not know what this was. In some ways, it looks like wheat because it hastassels on the top. And it is planted so closely. Corn is usually planted in rows, and theseare sort of rows, but they are more tight and more plants, more closely spaced.THAT’S WHY IT LOOKS SORT OF LIKE VELVET AROUND THIS CIRCLE FROMTHE WIDER SHOTS?Yes, it’s very healthy, the plants. I must say I was expecting some to be torn out,completely snapped off, where they had been pushed over, or torn out of the soil. I don’t"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"think I found one plant that was loose, and I pulled on a lot of plants and looked at them. Thick Sorghum Stalks Bent Without BreakingNo scrape marks or breaks in thick sorghum stems bent flat to the ground.Images © 2006 by Ted Robertson.I KNOW IN YOUR FIELD NOTES, YOU WERE IMPRESSED BY THE LACK OFDAMAGE ON THE STALKS AND HOW REALLY PRISTINE THE PLANTS LYINGDOWN WERE.That’s true. Normally, we look for scrape marks on the upper surface along the base whereit comes from the soil. I would say the majority of them were not even splintered. The soilwas moist, I think, when this formed and the roots tipped up a little bit, maybe came out insome plants. Maybe it was a combination of the roots tipping and the plants bendingslightly, although maybe 40% of the plants had split, but it did not look like the plants thatwe mechanically broke off in our own experiment. No Mud On Sorghum CircleIF IT HAD RAINED JUST THE NIGHT BEFORE, WOULDN’T THERE HAVE BEENMUD SOMEWHERE ON ALL THESE PLANTS, OR AROUND THE PLANTS, IF ITHAD BEEN PEOPLE?Yes, because I’ve walked in crop circles – and know you have – after it’s rained you getmuddy and the plants get muddy and I looked under a lot of this canopy of green, growingsorghum, lifting it up and photographing it at ground level, looking for scrape marks, bootmarks, mud. I even looked at areas where dirt clumps are and you want to see if the plantsactually smashed those clumps, or if they are intact. If something is flattening the plantsdown manually, like a board, I would assume that a stem next to a taller dirt clod reallycould not be, because the dirt cloud would be flattened along with the stem in most cases. Idid find intact dirt clods that just seemed like no one had trudged on them.I FOUND ONE OF YOUR MOST INTERESTING PHOTOGRAPHS AND COMMENTTHAT HERE IS ONE OF THE SORGHUM PLANTS DOWN, IMPRESSED INTO THE"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"SOIL. RIGHT NEXT TO IT, IT APPEARS AS IF THE SOIL IS A FEW INCHESHIGHER THAN THE PLANT.Sorghum stalk impressed into the moist soil after long rain, but fragile clumps of soilwere piled up higher next to the stem untouched. Image © 2006 by Ted Robertson.Definitely yes. These plants were imprinted half way through the diameter of their stalksinto what had been mud and was drier after the long rain, leaving like a groove. Next tothe downed plant, only one or two inches away in some cases, were these clumps thatwere now dry but fragile. Just inches away! The crop circle was impressive the way theplants went down.HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THAT PARTICULAR ANOMALY OF EMBEDDED STEMSNEXT TO RAISED SOIL IN OTHER FORMATIONS?Yes, I have. It’s what I like to see if I’m looking for something I don’t think is manmade.That one photograph, the stem is literally touching the dirt cloud that is two to three incheshigher. The dirt clod does not have a flat top. It’s like a spire. With a board, I think itwould take down the dirt clod as well, especially since it was raining. We did not find anymud on the stems, not any scrape marks.TED, IN THIS BELOIT CIRCLE – AS OPPOSED TO THE ROTATING COUNTER-CLOCKWISE OR CLOCKWISE DIRECTIONS WE FIND IN MANY OTHERFORMATIONS, IS IT ALMOST MORE OF A RADIAL LAY?Yes, it has a general clockwise flow, but it’s not a tight swirl. It splays out more radially, soinstead of taking maybe seven times, starting in the middle, to spiral out to the perimeter, ittakes more like three or four. That to me is more difficult. On top of that, the center of thecircle is not where the center of the swirl is located.Inside sorghum circle where plants put down in a general clockwise direction,but more loosely in a more radial distribution. Image © 2006 by Ted Robertson.DOESN’T THIS SEPARATE OUT THE SO-CALLED MECHANICALLY MANMADE,WHICH REALLY HAVE TO HAVE A CENTER POINT USUALLY IN ORDER TOFLATTEN A CIRCLE?Right. The outer perimeter of the circle was almost a perfect circle. Over 133 feet, it was132 by 133 feet, which is only a foot difference. That's closer to a perfect circle than we"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"usually find in formations. [ See diagram below.]AND VERY DIFFICULT GIVEN THAT THE CENTER IN YOUR DIAGRAM IS SIX TOSEVEN FEET OFF OF WHAT WOULD BE THE GEOMETRIC CENTER.The other thing is there is an added detail to the east (inside the circle) about 80 degreesoff of north. There is a secondary swirl with a little center, which is so subtle, and yet ithas layers underneath. It’s almost like water flowing down a drain. The main drain is nearthe center, but the smaller drain is about ten feet from the edge of the circle. It’s like waterthat flows into this little swirl.Yellow arrow points at little swirl of sorghum plants within the large133-foot-diameter circle. Image © 2006 by Ted Robertson.HOW WOULD YOU COMPARE BELOIT TO THE MANY CIRCLES THAT YOUHAVE INVESTIGATED YOURSELF OVER THE PAST HALF A DOZEN YEARS ORSO?The most outstanding thing about Beloit is that it is a huge circle, in terms of single circles,especially for the United States. We don’t get them. One hundred feet in diameter is prettybig. In 2000, when I saw my first crop circle in corn, we had a 100-foot-diameter circle. Atthe time, it was the largest circle in corn. This one (in Beloit) is 133 feet in diameter andit’s in sorghum, probably the single largest circle that we know about in sorghum.THE CHARACTERISTIC OF SORGHUM IS THAT IT IS STIFF LIKE THE STALKS OFCORN.That’s the closest thing I can describe it as. These plants were almost like corn. In fact, ifthere were ears on these, it would look just like corn. But they were all green and growing,none were loose. It was just like I saw in Miamisburg, in terms of the base of the roots. Itwas even a little bit more gently laid down than in some corn circles that I’ve seen."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Thick standing stalks of the Haygrazer sorghum, similar to stiff corn stalks,and grown for cattle feed. Image © 2006 by Ted Robertson.WHICH IS IMPRESSIVE, GIVEN THE STIFFNESS OF CORN. IT HARKENS BACKTO THE FIRST REAL MYSTERY IN ENGLAND, WHICH WAS HOW COULD THE‘MAGICALLY BENT STALKS’ OCCUR, WHETHER IT WAS IN WHEAT, BARLEY,CORN MAIZE, OR SORGHUM? HOW COULD IT HAPPEN WHEN YOU YOURSELFDEMONSTRATED THAT IF YOU PUSHED THOSE THICK STALKS DOWN, THEYWILL LITERALLY SNAP OFF AND OOZE?That’s a very good point. They do explode, and it seems the thicker the stalk, the harder itis to make that bend. I was bending with my bare fingers as gently as I could on thesamples that we tried to lay flat. In most cases, they would tear out and juice would fly outand that juice was kind of irritating, itchy. I know Rich Webb got an allergic reaction thenext day and I was itching in the field from it.But the thinner stems were more like grass. They could be put down. But that’s the otherthing – to make them stay down, doesn’t work. It’s very interesting. Sorghum Note Elongation AnalysisIT’S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ANALYSIS NOW ON THE LENGTH OF THEGROWTH NODES IS DEFINITELY OUTSIDE ANY STATISTICAL POSSIBILITY OFCHANCE. THERE REALLY IS A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF ELONGATED NODES ASWE HAVE FOUND FOR YEARS NOW IN THE TRULY MYSTERIOUS FORMATIONS?Right. Jeff Wilson and Dr. Chuck Lietzau did independent L-NEAT tests on full sets ofsamples that I collected individually for each of them. Jeff can tell more about that, but thenodes were significantly elongated.”"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Top: Beloit, Kansas, sorghum stem with elongated node.Bottom: Normal control sample of sorghum from outside the circle.Photograph and graphics © 2006 by Jeff Wilson, ICCRA.The L-NEAT test (Levengood-Node Elongation Analysis Test) was developed bybiophysicist W. C. Levengood and published in the peer-reviewed science journal,Physiologia Plantarum, back in the mid-1990s. It measures the growth nodes in cerealcrop formations for a comparison with the normal crop outside formations. Jeff Wilson,Director of the Independent Crop Circle Research Association (ICCRA), has been usingthe test for several years. He has found that none of the proven manmade crop formationshave ever shown growth node elongation. Only authentic crop circles have had theanomalous node elongation, which can be 15% to as much as 300% longer than normalcrops. Biophysicist W. C. Levengood hypothesizes that the node elongation is caused byinteraction with spinning energies of plasmas and microwaves produced by an unknownsource.Jeff Wilson and his ICCRA colleague, biologist Dr. Charles Lietzau, received sorghumsamples that Ted Robertson and Rich Webb gathered in Beloit. Jeff summarized for mewhat they found.Jeffrey Wilson, Director, Independent Crop Circle Researchers Association(ICCRA), Williamsburg, Ohio: “Only authentic crop circles exhibit this anomalousgrowth node elongation, which can range from 15% to 300% elongation, depending on thecrop, the moisture content of the plants and the time of the growing season.In this particular crop circle in Beloit, Kansas, I received samples collected from ICCRAinvestigators, Ted Robertson and Rich Webb. I went through the samples with my wife,Delsey, and we measured and recorded the growth nodes of all the plants for thiscomparison using a digital caliper to get an exact measurement of each growth node. Wefound that there was overwhelming statistical evidence that the growth nodes in the Beloit,Kansas, crop circle were elongated, compared to control plants taken from the standingcrop in the same field.DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING ELSE ANOMALOUS AS YOU WERE DOING THEL-NEAT ANALYSIS ON THE BELOIT, KANSAS CROP, WHICH IS A SORGHUM?DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING ELSE THAT STUCK OUT TO YOU?The idea of vertical splits in crop circle formations is being debated around the world by anumber of investigators. We don’t know what the significance of it is. We did not findvertical splits in any of the control plants, but just a few in the formation plants.Yellow arrow points to vertical split in sorghum stalk.The still unexplained, but vivid red discoloration, was found in many of theBeloit circle sorghum plants. Image © 2006 by Ted Robertson.[ Editorial Note from Ted Robertson: “About the red stalks with splits, thesewere very few in number – I probably found one or two and took somephotos. These did not look like the types of splits I saw before in terms of size.This one (above) was much larger. In other formations the splits were much"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"smaller and on the node – the underneath or ground facing side of the downedstalk. In Beloit, Kansas, the splits were in what seemed more fragile outer leafsheaths and not over nodes – and I only saw a few of these – not veryprevalent. These splits could be a natural drying out or wind fraying of thestem. Or they could be the result of the energy forces that were involved increating the formation – or a combination of both where a mysterious forcealters the leaf sheath at the nodes likely weakening it. Then perhaps over time,the leaf splits open and flares. We did a statistical analysis experiment andfound that the amount of plants that exhibited a red coloration on the stalksdowned inside the formation was less than the amount of affected plants inthe standing field outside of the formation (controls).” ]It’s possible that these vertical splits, which look in some cases similar to expulsioncavities. But they don’t go all the way down through the nodes. It’s just a split in the outernode sheet. It’s possible they could be related to expulsion cavities, but there is not enoughevidence to determine that at this point.BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT IN EITHER CASE, THE SPECULATION IS THATSOME KIND OF ENERGY INTERACTION WITH THE PLANTS MIGHT CAUSE THISSPLITTING?It’s possible, but it’s also possible that it could be a natural effect after plants get laiddown. Many times we find the cracks only on the side of the plant facing the ground andnot anywhere else. So, it could be a result of some natural decay process or other. Wedon’t know yet. But the node cracks are something notable we found in the Beloit plants. Why the Beloit, Kansas, SorghumCircle Is Not ManmadeWHAT IS YOUR OVERALL PERSPECTIVE NOW ON THE LARGE BELOIT,KANSAS, CIRCLE IN SORGHUM?Well, certainly, the L-NEAT numbers tell us it’s authentic. There are a number ofcontextual pieces of information that would also support that. It has a number ofcharacteristics, which show it to be well in line with other authentic crop formations thatwe’ve seen over the years.- Growth nodes of downed plants in circle elongated in comparison to controlplants outside the circle.- The Beloit circle was in close proximity to Plum Creek, which borders theeastern edge of the field. Water is often found near crop formations.- The circle was right over the top of limestone in which crop circles aroundthe world seem to be locating themselves over the tops of undergroundaquifers.- The circle was in really close proximity to power lines. There are power lineson both sides of the road that border the southern edge of the field. FromEurope to Canada to the United States, crop formations are often found nearmicrowave or other electronic towers.- The circle was on the down slope in the low part of the field approaching thecreek. Many crop formations are found on the sides of hills.- While there are no Indian mounds nearby, we do find that there was anancient Native American connection to this crop circle. There’s a nearbyhistorical marker, which notes something called the 'Great Spirit Spring.'"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Beloit, Kansas, telephone tower is on hill across Highway 9 in upper left.Photograph © 2006 by Ted Robertson. Beloit Circle Is Third LargestOn Record in United StatesThis Beloit, Kansas, crop circle is one of the largest single circles that’s ever been reportedin the United States. There are only two reports that are larger. There was a circle last yearin Green Mountain, North Carolina, that was reported to be 176 feet in diameter. Thenthere was a circle that was part of a big 14-circle formation in Rockville, California, in2003. The largest circle there was 140 feet across.So, this one in Beloit at about 133 feet would be the third largest ever reported. To giveyou an idea, I went through and looked at over the past ten years, I looked at over 120crop circles reported in the United States that had been measured accurately, and theaverage is about 43 feet in diameter. So, this is well over three to four times the averagesize crop circle.THE FACT THAT A CIRCLE THIS BIG COULD HAVE BEEN LAID DOWN SOGENTLY, AS TED ROBERTSON DESCRIBED IT, IS REMARKABLE IN ITSELF.It’s quite remarkable. The people who lived closest to the field, the Ackerman family, theirhouse overlooks the field. One of their daughters and a friend were up until about 3o’clock in the morning the night this crop circle seemed to show up. They reported nounusual lights, no unusual sounds; the family did not report anything. They said the circlewas not in the field when the sun went down and it was there at 7 a.m. when the sun cameup.IT RAINED ALL NIGHT, DIDN’T IT?It rained all night and it had rained all the previous day. There did not appear to be anyheavy lightning or thunder associated with that rain, and the circle showed up during thatrain shower. Anomaly of Off-Centers In Big Circleand Small SwirlDid Ted tell you about the second little swirl?YES.Multiple centers in crop circles are quite rare. I can only think of probably half a dozen inthe United States that have occurred like this. What’s interesting in this particular case isthat both of the swirled centers in this crop circle were on the eastern side of the circle.They weren’t even close to being in the geometric center of the circle. But the circle itselfis only out of (perfectly) round by about a foot.So, you have essentially a geometric circle, but the swirled centers to it are way off from"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"where the geometric center would be.RIGHT, I UNDERSTAND THAT THE CENTER IS ABOUT 6 TO 7 FEET FROM WHATTHE GEOMETRIC CENTER WOULD BE AND THAT SECOND, MORE SUBTLE,SWIRL IS ALMOST TO THE FAR EAST SIDE OF THE CIRCLE.Yes, it’s only about 20 feet from the edge.THROWING OFF THE CENTERS OF CIRCLES HAS BEEN REPORTED SO OFTENOVER THE YEARS IN ENGLAND. WHAT DOES THAT SUGGEST TO YOU?That’s a good question. I think perhaps however the circles are being created, it could bethey are being formed on some kind of an angle, rather than a vertical 90-degree hit fromabove to the ground. It could be coming down on an angled trajectory, rather than straightup and down to the surface.It’s kind of like shining a flashlight to the ground. You still get a circle, but the angle ofincidence could be pretty dramatic. That’s just a possibility. I don’t think there is any goodevidence at this point to say one way or the other.\" Diagram of Beloit, Kansas, Circleof September 9, 2006Diagram of Beloit, Kansas, sorghum circle reported on September 9, 2006.Diagram © 2006 by Ted Robertson.

Photograph © 1975 by Ted Phillips.Jeffrey Wilson noted that the large Beloit sorghum circle is only about twenty milesnorthwest from one of the most famous anomalies to ever be discovered in Kansas, knownas the Delphos Ring. Thirty-five years ago on September 2, 1971, eyewitness RonJohnson watched a ball of light hover near the ground 75 feet away. It emitted a rumblingsound for about three minutes and then flew up into the sky while emitting a veryhigh-pitched sound.Afterward, there was an 8-foot-diameter, glowing ring in the dry soil where the ball of lighthad been. MUFON investigator, Ted Phillips, investigated and soil samples were gatheredfor analysis. Compared to normal soil in the area, the Delphos Ring would not absorbwater; was more acidic; had 5 to 10 times more calcium, was coated with an unusualhydrocarbon; and contained an unknown crystalline substance with a low atomic weight.But that was a glowing ring in dry soil – not a 133-foot-diameter circle in 7-foot-highsorghum.
