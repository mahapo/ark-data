February 10, 2006 - Three weeks ago on Coast to Coast AM radio, I had informationfrom military, political and scientific sources about an aerial disc technology - defined as\"interplanetary\" and \"extraterrestrial\" by the Truman administration. That disc technology which the public and media have called \"UFOs\" - interfered with our V-2 rocket tests atNew Mexico's White Sands Proving Ground, beginning around 1947. We even shot atthose discs and there was retaliation.During the radio program open lines, a man named \"Don\" called in and said his uncle fromthe U. S. Navy had a briefcase containing TOP SECRET files and B&W photographs ofcrashed discs and entities. Don said his uncle showed the contents of the briefcase to himsometime before his uncle's death in 2002 - and before his uncle burned everything \"underorders,\" he said. I asked Don if he would leave his phone number for me to follow up. Inthis report, I would like to share some of the details Don told me about the photographsand his uncle's alleged firsthand experiences with live humanoids classified as\"extraterrestrial biological entities\" (EBEs or EBENs).Don told me there was not just one crash. He said there were two others at the same time one near the Trinity Site on White Sands where we exploded the first atomic bomb test inJuly 1945. The third was east of Alamogordo and Holloman AFB on the Mescalero IndianReservation.Those three crash sites are consistent with the leaked MJ-12 documents that Bob and RyanWood have published. One is dated July 22, 1947, and entitled \"InterplanetaryPhenomenon Unit Summary.\" Another is \"Majestic Twelve Project's 1st Annual Report.\"The July 22, 1947 \"Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit\" TOP SECRET summary begins:\"The extraordinary recovery of fallen airborne objects in the state of New Mexicobetween 4 July to 6 July 1947\" and states that about a half hour before the clock turned tomidnight going into July 4, 1947, \"radar stations in east Texas and White Sands ProvingGround, New Mexico, tracked two unidentified aircraft until both dropped off radar. Twocrash sites have been located close to the White Sands Proving Ground.\" The reportspecifies one is near Corona and the other is near Oscura Peak and the Trinity Site atWhite Sands.Later in the Majestic Twelve 1st Annual Report, more was known and a third crash site islisted as 30 miles east of Alamogordo on the Mescalero Indian Reservation. According to"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the government reports, bodies were found at both the Corona and Trinity Site locations.Don told me his uncle showed him B&W photographs of all three crash sites. NearCorona, he said there were photographs of the craft that was embedded in a hillside andtwo entities standing up alive. There were also two smaller, dead bodies on the ground onehad an arm and leg cut off and the other had a slice across its belly. Don assumed thishappened from the crash impact. Paragraphs from \"Interplanetary Phenomenon UnitSummary\"Dated: July 22, 1947 from U. S. War DepartmentLanding Zone 2 (LZ-2) was ten miles northwest of Oscura Peak on White SandsProving Ground as it was known in 1940s."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Majestic Twelve Project1st Annual ReportAbove: Page 8 of \"Majestic Twelve Project: 1st Annual Report, Annex A\" after 1947 disc crashes andretrievals.Cleaned copy of original by Bob and Ryan Wood, www.majesticdocuments.com.

Acouple of days later, Don was not returning my phone calls and finally he left this voicemessage on my phone:\"Hi, Linda. It's Don. The reason I ain't returned your calls your phone's beenbugged. I've been getting some calls. And I've had people following me, so I'mgoing to kind of back out of this. I don't know what to tell you. You can callme, and I'll answer it. But I ain't going to say anything else. This is getting alittle bit too scary because I just had a feeling I shouldn't have opened up. ButI figured it was a dead source. But it still ain't dead.\"Let's go back about five years ago when Don's Navy uncle was alive, but dying from ablood disease and other ailments. Don says the briefcase was old, cracked leather, fromwhich his uncle took out file folders, documents and black and white photographs of theJuly 1947 crashes in New Mexico by other-worldly aerial discs. Two brief clarifications:Don said there were no ears on the beings, only tiny slits. But he uses the word, \"ears.\"And he says his uncle referred to \"beyond our galaxy\" and thinks that means outside ourMilky Way galaxy, not just beyond our solar system. But he isn't sure. He begins withdescribing the stamp on the back of a photograph of the craft embedded in a hill nearCorona.Don, U. S. Marine Corps Special Forces and Uncle (mother's brother) in U. S. Navyfrom 1940s to 1950s: \"On the back, it said: 'Property of the United States Navy TOPSECRET.'PROPERTY OF THE NAVY?Yeah.DID YOU EVER SEE THE LETTERS 'MAJIC' STAMPED ON ANY OF IT?It was across the top of the folder. It was in solid black in big bold letters. And (therewere) B&W photos.YOU SAW THESE PHOTOS WITH YOUR OWN EYES, RIGHT?Yeah, the first one was a craft in the side of a hill at an angle. Two bodies were on theoutside and two were standing upright. The two dead were one I remember was lookedlike he was just split open, like someone took a knife and just laid him open (across belly).The other was missing a leg and an arm. Skin from B&W (photos), you really can't tell.Estimated height would be somewhere between three to four feet. Egg-shaped head. Longarms. Short legs. Long, pointy fingers.Mouths were round. It wasn't like our mouths. It was more like an oval shape.DO YOU MEAN OVAL UP AND DOWN? OR OVAL GOING SIDEWAYS?Sideways.OK. SO, YOU WERE NOT LOOKING AT JUST A THIN LINE.Right.WAS IT ESPECIALLY DARK COMPARED TO THEIR SKIN?About the same color as their eyes in a B&W photo because their eyes were at a slantedangle with a darkness to them. And they tapered down to like a little point where it goestoward the ears.THE POINTS WENT TOWARD THE EARS, NOT TOWARD THE NOSE?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The points went toward the ear (slits).Their skin looked wrinkled almost like it had some kind of uniform on it. But, I really don'tknow. And it was just like you take a piece of paper and put a little crease in it. You knowhow the actresses use skin tone body suits?YES.I would put it somewhere in that category.DID YOUR UNCLE EXPLAIN HOW THEY GOT THAT DISC EMBEDDED IN THEHILL OUT? WHAT DID THEY PUT IT ON? HOW DID THEY MOVE IT?It was moved by a flatbed truck covered under a tarp with two cranes that removed it fromthe side of the hill and moved it in the middle of the night.YOU THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS 30 FEET IN DIAMETER?Ye s .DID YOUR UNCLE MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT OUR MILITARY FIRING ATTHESE DISCS?Our military fired at them, but it didn't do any good. We were told not to tell anybody forthe rest of our lives. But I figured Hey! It's time to let it out. Why Persistent U. S. Government Denial?RIGHT. I WONDERED IF HE SAID ANYTHING THAT DAY WHEN HE WASSHOWING YOU ALL THE MATERIAL FROM HIS BRIEFCASE? DID HE SAYANYTHING TO YOU ABOUT WHY THE SECRET WOULD STILL BE KEPT INWHAT ESSENTIALLY NOW IS THE 21ST CENTURY?They just don't want the American people to know that E.T.s, or humanoids, or whateveryou want to call them, exist. And that some of them could have the power to literally wipeus off the face of the Earth.DID HE SAY THAT?Ye s .DID HE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WHO THESE ENTITIES WERE? WHERE THEYWERE FROM? THAT SORT OF THING?They are from outside our galaxy. That's all he would tell us. And that they were trying toteach us what they knew of different forms of medicine. They were strictly here for peace.FROM ANOTHER GALAXY?Yeah. (I asked him if he meant \"from another solar system\"? But he said he rememberedhis uncle using the word galaxy and thought he meant beyond the Milky Way galaxy. Thisis different than the more \"traditional\" origin commonly given as the binary star systemZeta Reticuli I and II, about 37.5 light-years from Earth.)WHAT I THINK THE GOVERNMENT CALLS 'EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICALENTITIES\" THE ACRONYM IS EBEN. DID YOUR UNCLE EVER USE THAT TERM,'EBEN\"?Yes, but he didn't pronounce it \"EBEN.\"WHAT DID HE SAY?He said it was \"EBB-un.\" Every now and then, you'd hear something on news, or theybroadcast from Spain or somewhere else showing some unidentified thing. And they wereexplaining it as swamp gas and all this other stuff. And he'd just start laughing. You know,everybody would look at him like, 'What are you laughing at?'And he's say, 'If only the people only knew what it was.'HE TOLD YOU WHEN HE SHOWED YOU THE PHOTOGRAPHS THAT THESEEBENS WERE FROM ANOTHER GALAXY AND THAT THEY WERE HERE TOTEACH US ABOUT MEDICINE?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Yes. And how to live in peace.THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE DOING A VERY GOOD JOB.No, they don't. Of course, the government ain't letting them out, either, are they?IT'S A VERY BIG PUZZLE. THAT'S WHY I'M HOPING MAYBE YOUR UNCLE TOLDYOU SOMETHING THAT WOULD GIVE US SOME INSIGHT INTO WHY IT IS ALLSEEMINGLY SO STRANGE, CONFUSING AND COMPLICATED.One letter I read was by a 'Wolkaman,' or 'Walkaman.' I don't remember the last name, buthe said it would cause mass panic if the American citizens should find out about the E.T.sbecause they would automatically confuse them and terrorize them.THEY WOULD AUTOMATICALLY CONFUSE THE PUBLIC?Ye s .ND THE TERROR WOULD COME FROM WHAT?That it never went into detail. It just kind of ended there. I don't know if that meantterrorize the aliens? Or terrorize the American public? According to Truman, he didn't trustthem.DO YOU KNOW WHY?No. It wasn't written. Truman just said to keep them (live captured EBENs) underconfinement and not to let a word leak out. And that was for \"Private Eyes Only,\" if Iremember the letterhead right.DID YOUR UNCLE TRY TO EXPLAIN TO YOU ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT HEUNDERSTOOD ABOUT WHY TRUMAN WOULD NOT TRUST THEM?No, he never did say that. But he had complete trust in them.YOUR UNCLE TRUSTED THE EBENS?Yes. He said he didn't feel any fear around them. Telepathic CommunicationSO YOUR UNCLE HAD BEEN FACE-TO-FACE WITH THEM?Ye s .DID HE HAVE TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION?Like a trance state he fell into when he was standing next to them. It was just like athought pattern. He could tell what they were thinking and they read everything he wasthinking. Yet, it sounded like they were talking back and forth.IT WAS INSIDE OF HIS HEAD?Right.DID HE HEAR HIS OWN THOUGHT VOICE? OR DID THE EBENS HAVE ADISTINCTLY DIFFERENT QUALITY OF SOUND INSIDE HIS HEAD?He said they had a higher pitch than we do. But it was completely inaudible, yet he couldunderstand every word they were saying.DID HE EVER SAY, 'I ASKED THEM TELEPATHICALLY: WHY ARE YOU HERE?'AND HEAR FROM THEM DIRECTLY?He said basically they were here to shed peace upon the world and to teach us how to livein peace and to explain some of the medications that would cure 90% of the disease in the1950s.MEDICATIONS?Right.HIS CLOSEST CONTACT WITH THE EBENS WAS IN 1947?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"1948.IN 1948, AFTER THE (THREE) CRASHES (NEAR ROSWELL AND WHITE SANDS).Right. \"Anti-Gravity\" Demonstration by Ebens At Area 51 S-4WHERE WAS THAT (CLOSE CONTACT)?Dreamland - Area 51, Groom Lake.AND THAT'S WHERE YOUR UNCLE WAS IN CONTACT WITH WAS IT ONE ORMORE EBENS?There was two there that he was in contact with.WERE THEY WORKING WITH OUR GOVERNMENT?Ye s .WERE THEY WORKING ON TECHNOLOGY? OR?The way he put it, it was a sealed room with a ball floating in mid-air suspended bynothing.WHAT WERE THEY DOING?What he witnessed was like how can I put it? one room in a room. Like there would be acubicle inside of a larger room. There was a metal sphere - -what he described that wasjust literally being moved side-to-side, up and down with nothing holding it.WAS THE METAL SPHERE INSIDE OF A GLASS ROOM?Yes, it was glass, or plastic.THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER ROOM. WHERE WERE THE PEOPLE WATCHINGTHIS?In the exterior room. It would be like taking a cake and putting a small cake pan over thetop of it, a clear one. And then taking a larger one and putting it over the top of the smallerone like a confinement area.AND YOUR UNCLE WAS IN THAT OUTER ROOM?Right.WHERE WERE THE TWO EBENS HE WAS WORKING WITH?One was sitting next to him. The other one was sitting next to some high-ranking birdcolonel.WHAT WERE THE EBENS TRYING TO DEMONSTRATE FOR YOUR UNCLE ANDTHE BIRD COLONEL?Defying gravity.WERE THEY DOING IT WITH THEIR MIND? OR SOMETHING ELSE?Just with their mind. There was nothing else in there.OK, SO THE EBENS WERE TRYING TO SHOW THAT THEY COULD LIFT THEMETAL SPHERES WITH THEIR MIND?Right. And according to what my uncle said, they (metal balls) weighed anywhere from100 to 200 pounds. It was nothing it was like for them lifting a piece of paper.DID YOUR UNCLE UNDERSTAND WHY THE EBENS WERE DEMONSTRATINGTHAT FOR OUR GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY?Well, from what he theorized and what he could pick up, they were showing him thepower of mind vs. matter. So, I don't know if the craft flies like that, or what?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" Hand-Imprinted Control Panels in DiscsDID HE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE EBENS HAVING HAND-IMPRINTEDPANELS AND A BAND AROUND THEIR HEADS THAT THEY USED TO FLY THECRAFT WITH THEIR MIND?There was a hand-imprinted panel on two sides of the craft: one in the back and one in thefront. So, I don't know if that was for a pilot and co-pilot? But he never mentioned nothingabout a band.ABOUT WHAT?About a band around their head.BUT FROM YOUR DISCUSSION WITH HIM AND HIS EXPLAINING DOING THISWORK AT AREA 51, YOU UNDERSTOOD THAT THESE BEINGS PROBABLY FLEWTHE CRAFT WITH THEIR MINDS?From the impression he gave me, yes.THOSE HAND-IMPRINTED PANELS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH BEINGABLE TO CONTROL THE CRAFT WITH THEIR MIND.Right like horizontal, vertically. It could have something to do with speed. I have no ideawhat they are powered by. And neither did he. So, we're assuming it's all mind over matter. 1945 Atomic Tests Caught EBENs Attention?WHY WOULD THEY HAVE COME FROM ANOTHER GALAXY ALL THE WAY TOHERE?A nuclear bomb explosion in what 1941?WE EXPLODED THE FIRST ATOMIC DEVICE AT TRINITY SITE AT WHITE SANDSIN JULY OF 1945.OK, that's the only thing he would say. It had something to do with the first bomb we blewoff. We were getting too powerful for our little, tiny planet. It would be like a Star Trekfilm where a parent body would be watching over its child. That's the way he kind ofdescribed it.Early stage of Fat Boy \"gadget\" atomic bomb test on July 16, 1945, at Trinity Site, WSPG,which detonated at 05:29:45 local Mountain War Time with energy equivalent to 19 kilotons of TNT. TheSeattle Times:\"The heat was so intense that it vaporized the tower holding the bomb and melted the sand underneath into agreen glass dubbed Trinitite.A mile away, exposed surfaces were heated to 750 degrees. At 10 miles, the heat still felt like the open mouthof a fireplace,witnesses reported. Despite bulldozing away the fused sand, the radiation levels today, half a century later, arestillten times that of the background radiation levels found in nature from radioactive rocks and cosmic rays.\""},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"One of the few color photographs of the Trinity atomic bomb. Physicist and Los Alamos Director,J. Robert Oppenheimer, later quoted from the Hindu Bhagavad Gita: \"I am become Death, the destroyer ofworlds.\"SO, DID YOUR UNCLE EVER SUGGEST THAT HUMAN BEINGS MIGHT HAVEBEEN MADE BY THESE EBENS?He thought about it, but he couldn't prove it.WHEN YOU SAY HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT, WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOUSPECIFICALLY?Specifically? He said we are all probably from outer space and don't know it.THAT WE HUMANS ARE?Ye s .THAT THERE MIGHT BE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WHAT HE CALLED THE'EBB-uns' AND I'VE HEARD 'EBENS,' THE ONES THAT WERE IN THE CRASHES ATROSWELL AND HUMANITY?Right.WHY, IF THEY ARE SO ADVANCED, IF THEY CAN CONTROL CRAFT WITHTHEIR MIND, IF THEY CAN MENTALLY LIFT UP HEAVY METALLIC BALLSINSIDE OF A GLASS ROOM AT AREA 51 WHY WOULD THEIR CRAFT HAVEEVER CRASHED IN NEW MEXICO OR ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE PLANET?Up to his dying day, he couldn't even figure out why there was such a tight lid on it. But hedid make one comment that didn't make any sense he said: 'The government will neverknow and some of them are actually ours.' And I have no idea what that means.Somebody was watching him until the day he died. But he didn't say if it was Intel? Or justsomebody the President of U. S. assigned to watch over him? Or the Navy assigned towatch over him? Or who was assigned to watch over him? Because he didn't know.WHY, THEN, DO YOU THINK THAT HE PULLED OUT THAT OLD BRIEFCASEWITH THE FILES AND PHOTOGRAPHS FROM ROSWELL, THE TOP SECRETDOCUMENTS ONE EVEN LABELED 'MAJIC'? WHY DID HE DO THAT?Just to get rid of it because he said that was his orders - to destroy everything if he thoughthe was going to die. He found out he was going to die within two years.AND HE DECIDED TO SHOW YOU ALL?Yes, because we kept bugging him.AND THEN HE BURNED IT.Yes, and that was the end of it.BUT WHY WOULD HE HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO KEEP ALL OF THISMATERIAL IN A BRIEFCASE IN THE FIRST PLACE?That I don't know.\""},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"More Information:For more information about UFO phenomena, please see the following reports inEarthfiles Archives and the books and documentaries listed in Earthfiles Shop.Â· 02/05/2006 -- Part 11 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collectand Analyze Flying Discs Â· 01/27/2006 -- Part 2: Navy Physicist and USAFGeophysicist Discuss UFOs and ETsÂ· 01/20/2006 -- Part 1: Navy Physicist and USAF Geophysicist Discuss UFOs and ETsÂ· 01/17/2006 -- Part 9 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collectand Analyze Flying DiscsÂ· 01/13/2006 -- 31st Cattle Mutilation on Red Bluff, California RanchÂ· 12/21/2005 -- Updated: Part 2 - Peculiar Phenomenon, Early United States Effortsto Collect and Analyze Flying DiscsÂ· 12/02/2005 -- Abduction by Grey ETs in Huge, Black TriangleÂ· 11/11/2005 -- Part 3: An Alleged 1953 UFO Crash and Burial Near Garrison, UtahÂ· 11/10/2005 -- Part 2: An Alleged 1953 UFO Crash and Burial Near Garrison, UtahÂ· 11/02/2005 -- Part 3: Unusual Animal Deaths -Sheep Mutilations in Moortown,Dartmoor, EnglandÂ· 10/27/2005 -- Updated: Five \"Satellites\" That Merged As One StarÂ· 10/25/2005 -- Part 6 - Final: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of AllegedUFOs and Occupants in Military CustodyÂ· 10/13/2005 -- Part 5: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOsand Occupants in Military CustodyÂ· 10/07/2005 -- Part 1: Beam Technology Lifted Body Near Ft.
