History© 2006 by Linda Moulton Howe\"The average temperature for the continental United States from January through June 2006 was thewarmest first half of any year since records began in 1895.\" - NOAAJuly 17, 2006, temperature map for mainland United States.July 18, 2006 Asheville, North Carolina - The following is the National Oceanic andAtmosphere Agency's summary of America's \"record warm first half of year, widespreaddrought and northeast record rainfall.\"NOAA report on July 14, 2006: \"The average temperature for the continental United Statesfrom January through June 2006 was the warmest first half of any year since records began in1895, according to scientists at the NOAA National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C.Last month was the second warmest June on record and nationally averaged precipitation wasbelow average. The continuation of below normal precipitation in certain regions and muchwarmer-than-average temperatures expanded moderate-to-extreme drought conditions in thecontiguous U.S. However, much of the Northeast experienced severe flooding and recordrainfall during the last week of June. The global surface temperature was second warmest onrecord for June.U.S. Temperature HighlightsThe average January-June temperature for the contiguous United States (based on preliminarydata) was 51.8 degrees F (11.0 degrees C), or 3.4 degrees F (1.8 degrees C) above the 20thcentury (1901-2000) average. Five states (Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska and Missouri)experienced record warmth for the period. No state was near or cooler than average.The nation observed the second warmest June on record this year. In the West, 11 states weremuch warmer than average. Only five states (Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia andSouth Carolina) were cooler than normal for the month.The June statewide average temperature for Alaska was near average, and January-June was0.55 degrees F (0.30 degrees C) cooler than the 1971-2000 average.U.S. Precipitation HighlightsThe average precipitation for June 2006 across the continental U.S. was 0.3 in. (8 mm) belowthe 20th century average.Record rainfall in parts of the Northeast during May and June contributed to the wetter-than-normal first half of the year for that region. Heavy precipitation along the East Coast fromJune 22-28 resulted in widespread flooding. For example, Washington’s Reagan NationalAirport reported 11.37 inches (289 mm) during that time and a record June total of 14.02inches (356 mm). More than 10 inches (254 mm) of rain fell in Federalsburg on Maryland’sEastern Shore in a 24-hour period."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"In June, 45 percent of the contiguous U.S. was in moderate-to-extreme drought (based on thePalmer Drought Index), an increase of 6 percent from May, while 27 percent was in severe-extreme drought (up from 20 percent in May). Additionally, from January through June, warm,dry conditions spawned more than 50,000 wildfires, burning more than 3,000,000 acres in thecontiguous U.S. and Alaska, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.Global HighlightsIt was the second warmest June on record for global land- and ocean-surface temperaturessince records began in 1880 (1.08 degrees F/0.60 degrees C above the 20th century mean) andthe sixth warmest year-to-date (January-June) (0.90 degrees F/0.50 degrees C).\" Eastern Gulf of Mexico Coast TemperaturesCurrent water temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit near Pensacola, Florida are 90 degrees F; Naples, Florida =87.6 F; and Key West, Florida = 84.9 degrees F.

NOAA's U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey was established in 1807 by Thomas Jefferson, followedby formation of the Weather Bureau and the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries in the 1870s.Through the emerging Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), NOAA is working with itsfederal partners and more than 60 countries to develop a global monitoring network of Earth.For further information about global warming, please see reports below in the Earthfiles Archives: • 06/24/2006 -- \"High Confidence\" Earth Is Warmest in 400 Years - Maybe Even 2,000• 04/08/2006 -- Recent Caribbean Coral Reef Die-Off Biggest Ever Seen• 03/17/2006 -- Planet Earth's Ice Melt• 02/20/2006 -- Mysterious Deaths of Whales in Mexico• 11/18/2005 -- Is the Sun Heating Up?• 10/07/2005 -- Warmer Sea Surfaces, Increased Wind Power Making Hurricanes Stronger• 09/29/2005 -- 2005 Arctic Summer Ice Melt - Largest On Record• 09/23/2005 -- 9 X-Class Solar Flares Between September 7 - 19, 2005.• 09/23/2005 -- Phenomenon of \"Instant\" Hurricanes in 2005• 09/15/2005 -- Animal Mutilations Reported in Switzerland, Hollywood and Kansas• 08/26/2005 -- What Is Killing Amphibians Around the World?• 08/26/2005 -- Another Cattle Mutilation in Canada• 08/18/2005 -- Unusual Summer Swarm of Arkansas Copperheads• 08/05/2005 -- Scientists Puzzled by \"Bizarre\" Pacific Coast Die-offs in 2005• 05/11/2005 -- Greenland Sea Cold Water Re-Cycling Has Nearly Stopped.
