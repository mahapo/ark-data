Merapi Volcano In Ring of Fire © 2006 by Linda Moulton Howe An \"imminent\" eruption, say authorities, has provoked a call formore than 20,000 people to evacuate their homes on Saturday, May 13, 2006. - 1994 Eruption killed about 70 people.- 1930 eruption killed 1,370. Mt. Merapi volcano near heavily populated Yogyakarta,Indonesia, on May 13, 2006. Rising 9,700 feet (2,900 meters), Merapihas been steadily active for more than a decade. Image © 2006 by AP . May 13, 2006 Yogyakarta, Indonesia - The Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program wrote aboutMt. Merapi in 2000:\"Merapi, one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes, dominates the landscape immediately northof the city of Yogyakarta in one of the world's most densely populated areas. Merapi is theyoungest and southernmost of a volcanic chain extending NNW to Ungaran volcano....Pyroclastic flows and lahars accompanying growth and collapse of the steep-sided activesummit lava dome have devastated cultivated lands on the volcano's western-to-southern flanksand caused many fatalities during historical time. Since 1953, activity has been characterizedby extrusion of lava into the summit crater, with periodic lava dome collapse and nuée ardenteformation. Summit lava dome growth has continued since the 1969 gas explosion.\" The volcano is monitored from the Merapi Volcano Observatory (MVO) in Yogyakarta, w hichstates at its website at least 32 villages at 500 meters up the mountain have more than 250,000 people at risk ifvolcanic lava moves down the active mountain.

Although Chinese records show a Krakatau eruption in the 3rdcentury AD, and some 17 additional historical eruptions are reported from Kelut as well asKrakatau through the 15th century, uncertainty surrounds many of them. Europeans firstbegan to document eruptions in 1512 (Sangeang Api and Gunungapi Wetar), about thetime Portugal gained control of the Mollucan clove trade. \"The disastrous Krakatau eruption of 1883 was followed by several devastating eruptionson other islands and in 1920 a Volcano Survey was established by the government, leadingto much improved volcano monitoring and reporting. The Volcanological Survey ofIndonesia (VSI) now operates a network of 64 volcano observatories continuouslymonitoring 59 volcanoes. \"The great sweep of the Sunda Arc, over 3,000 kilometers from NW Sumatra to the BandaSea, results from the subduction of Indian Ocean crust beneath the Asian Plate. This arcincludes 76% of the region's volcanoes, but those on either end are tectonically morecomplex. \"Indonesia leads the world in many volcano statistics. It has the largest number ofhistorically active volcanoes (76), its total of 1,171 dated eruptions is only narrowlyexceeded by Japan's 1,274, and these two regions have combined to produce one-third ofthe known explosive eruptions on Earth. Indonesia has suffered the highest numbers oferuptions producing fatalities, damage to arable land, mudflows, tsunamis, domes, andpyroclastic flows.\" Since serious record keeping did not begin until more modern history, 80% of datedIndonesian volcano eruptions have occurred since the 1800s.
