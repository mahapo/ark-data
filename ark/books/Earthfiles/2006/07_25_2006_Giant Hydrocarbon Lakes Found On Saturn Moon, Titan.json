Radar images courtesy NASA and JP L.July 25, 2006 Pasadena, California - NASA and JPL report: \"The Cassini spacecraft, using its radar system,has discovered very strong evidence for hydrocarbon lakes on Titan. Dark patches, which resemble terrestriallakes, seem to be sprinkled all over the high latitudes surrounding Titan's north pole.\"Scientists have speculated that liquid methane or ethane might form lakes on Titan, particularly near thesomewhat colder polar regions. In the images, a variety of dark patches, some with channels leading in or outof them, appear. The channels have a shape that strongly implies they were carved by liquid. Some of the darkpatches and connecting channels are completely black, that is, they reflect back essentially no radar signal, andhence must be extremely smooth. In some cases rims can be seen around the dark patches, suggesting depositsthat might form as liquid evaporates. The abundant methane in Titan's atmosphere is stable as a liquid underTitan conditions, as is its abundant chemical product, ethane, but liquid water is not. For all these reasons,scientists interpret the dark areas as lakes of liquid methane or ethane, making Titan the only body in the solarsystem besides Earth known to possess lakes. Because such lakes may wax and wane over time, and windsmay alter the roughness of their surfaces. Repeat coverage of these areas should test whether indeed these arebodies of liquid.\"These two radar images were acquired by the Cassini radar instrument in synthetic aperture mode on July 21,2006. The top image centered near 80 degrees north, 92 degrees west measures about 420 kilometers by 150kilometers (260 miles by 93 miles). The lower image centered near 78 degrees north, 18 degrees westmeasures about 475 kilometers by 150 kilometers (295 miles by 93 miles). Smallest details in this image areabout 500 meters (1,640 feet) across.\"The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the ItalianSpace Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology inPasadena, manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassiniorbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The radar instrument was built by JPL and the ItalianSpace Agency, working with team members from the United States and several European countries.\" More Information:For further information about solar system research, please see reports below in theEarthfiles Archives:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"• 05/05/2006 -- Saturn's Titan Moon Has Puzzling Dunes• 04/11/2006 -- Hot Venus Now Studied by ESA's Venus Express• 03/17/2006 -- Planet Earth's Ice Melt• 11/09/2005 -- Dust Storm On Mars, Cosmic First Light and Black Hole At Our Galaxy's Center• 10/19/2005 -- Saturn's Icy Moon, Dione, Up Close• 09/16/2005 -- \"Planet X\" and the Kuiper Belt's Oddballs, \"Santa\" and \"Easterbunny\"• 05/06/2005 -- What Are The Straight Lines on Saturn's Titan Moon?• 03/25/2005 -- Glow of Distant Worlds Seen For First Time• 03/20/2005 -- Astronaut John Young: \"The Moon Can Save Earth's Civilization.\"• 02/17/2005 -- Iapetus and Enceladus: Baffling Moons of Saturn• 01/22/2005 -- Titan - A Moon Where It Rains Methane Into Seas and Soils of Hydrocarbons• 01/14/2005 -- Updated - Cassini/Huygen's First Look At Titan's Surface• 11/25/2004 -- Closest Look At Mysterious Titan from Cassini Spacecraft• 06/11/2004 -- Cassini Spacecraft Will Rendezvous with Saturn July 1, 2004• 04/21/2004 -- At the X-Conference, Former Naval Intelligence Officer, C.
