In that 16th Century, as today in the 21st Century, thecommon citizens were taxed, manipulated and controlled by the power/greed structures of various governmententities. Riding by horseback to help the commoners, at least in literature, was a generous and caring soulnamed Robin Hood. He stole from the rich to share with the poor and his name became a symbol forchampioning the rights of the common citizen in the face of bullying and arrogant corporate and politicalhierarchies.In early 2000, a modern electronic \"Robin Hood\" emerged. Back then, he was a 34-year-old, self-taughtinternet technology consultant in London who was frustrated to see all kinds of information and speculation onthe Web about secret American technologies back-engineered from recovered extraterrestrial craft, whichmight solve the world's energy and transportation problems. His name is Gary McKinnon. Gary knew hismother's London water and heating bills were rising every year and resented the unfairness that so manypeople, especially pensioners, would suffer to simply stay warm in winter and cool in summer. Some peopleeven die, unable to pay utility bills. So, he decided to look for hard evidence of antigravity technology andzero point energy technology that he kept reading about. What if such energy breakthroughs might already existin secret, compartmentalized American government projects? Gary thought if he could prove such energysystems did exist, he would report what he found to the world and let the chips fall where they might. Hewanted truth to overw helm the national security lies in the U. S. and his own country, England.Gary McKinnon in Trafalgar Square, London, England, his home city. In February 2006,he turned 40-years-old. He is a self-taught internet technology consultant.Image courtesy mother, Janis McKinnon.Gary had also read about Donna Hare, a woman who had worked at the NASA Johnson Space Center inHouston, Texas, as a slide technician. Her office was in Building 8, a building that required a SECRETclearance to enter. Since Donna had a SECRET clearance and had received NASA's 1969 ApolloAchievement Award and several other honors for her technical artist skills, she assumed she could goanywhere in Building 8. One night there, she visited a fellow technician. She has since reported publicly aboutwhat happened in a May 6, 1995, WOL-AM radio broadcast from Baltimore, Maryland (See websites below.)In a transcript made of that broadcast, Donna Hare said: \"While I was there, I was trying to learn new methodsand new things about the whole NASA photo organization. I was looking at pictures and my friend directed myattention to one area on a photograph. There was a white, circular-shaped dot in the B&W photo. I asked himif it was a spot on the emulsion. He said, 'I can't tell you, but spots on the emulsion do not leave round circlesof shadows underneath.' I also noticed that there were pine trees. And I did notice there was a shadow underthe white dot, and the trees were casting shadows in the same direction as the circle shadow of whatever theaerial phenomenon was, because it was higher than the trees, but not too much higher. I asked, 'Is that a UFO?'My friend said, 'I can't tell you.' I asked what he was going to do with the photo? He said, 'We have to airbrushthese things out before we sell these photographs to the public.'Gary McKinnon also read about Donna Hare's firsthand information that NASA airbrushed out UFOs fromNASA photographs. So, Gary wanted to see if he could find any similar original UFO photographs in NASAcomputer files that had not been airbrushed. Gary created commands for his computer to look up ranges ofInternet Protocol (IP) addresses to find out which were used by NASA and American military sites. Hissearch began in early 2000 and extended to early 2002. During those two years, he found a list of"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"\"Non-Terrestrial Officers\" associated with what Gary thinks is an off-planet operation, perhaps to weaponizespace. He also saw a NASA photograph from the point of view of the upper atmosphere looking down towardEarth. In the foreground, very close-up, was a bizarre object unlike anything Gary had ever seen before. Theshape was a cigar, pointed at both ends. The cigar had four geodesic dome structures. Gary could not see anyrivets or seams and thought he was most likely looking at extraterrestrial technology.That night in early 2002, while he was studying the cigar-object in the NASA photograph, Gary was cut off bywhoever the NASA operator was of that particular computer. In March 2002, Gary McKinnon was arrested inLondon by authorities from the National High Tech Crime Unit, which has now been absorbed into a newlyformed intelligence agency called Serious Organized Crime Association, or SOCA. Originally, Gary wasgoing to be penalized under Britain's Computer Misuse Act. Maximum sentence would have been six months injail and/or community service. But by November 2002, the American Department of Justice intervened in hiscase and said the DOJ would pursue Gary's extradition to the United States for the alleged hacking damage hehad caused to American government computers. Now, in June 2006, Gary and his English attorney say he didno damage to American computers and are fighting the extradition proceedings, which might last for anotherfive years if taken to the European Court of Human Rights.I talked by phone with Gary McKinnon this week at his London home. Since it is illegal to hack intocomputers, especially military and government ones, I asked him to first comment on the American extraditionrequest.Interview:Gary McKinnon (40-years-old), Self-Taught Internet Technology Consultant, London, England: \"Iobviously absolutely agree it’s illegal. You can’t counter the law. But in my opinion, and in the opinion ofmany others, I was acting in what I felt to be the public interest.CAN YOU EXPLAIN?I was looking for very hard evidence of anti-gravity technology, zero point energy technology that was arrivedat by the reverse engineering of extraterrestrial craft and via secret compartmented projects of the Americangovernment, as well as others. I felt the world needs this free energy technology.YES, COULD YOU EXPLAIN A BIT MORE FOR THE GENERAL AUDIENCE ABOUT WHY YOU FEELTHAT IT IS JUSTIFIED TO HACK INTO AREAS THAT MIGHT HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT FREEENERGY AND NEUTRALIZING GRAVITY?First of all, I wouldn’t like to say to everyone that it is justified. I’m a person who was on my own. I wasdoi ng w hat I felt w as per fectl y justifi ed, but I w ouldn’t recommend it to anyone. I fel t w e are not getti ng truthfrom the scientists and governments because they don’t know the truth (about) these ‘black projects,’ if youwill, are conducted outside of the normal government over-sight.My personal opinion was – in Britain, for instance, we have old age pensioners dying because they can’tafford to warm themselves because they can’t afford the fuel bills, which have gone up 55% in the last twoyears. So, to have good evidence, or to think you might have a chance at getting good evidence, that thetechnology exists whereby everyone can warm themselves for free and heat their food and have their baths orwhatever. I felt I was morally justified at the time. NASA and Military IP Address SearchesHOW DID YOU GO ABOUT YOUR FIRST SEARCHES? AND HOW DID YOU ACCOMPLISHBREAKING IN?OK, this isn’t something you do through Google. These are private military networks. They are not websites.There is a finite address space on the internet. I think it numbers about 40 billion different IP addresses. Everytime someone has an IP (Internet Protocol) address, which is just like a street number for your house on thestreet or your apartment number, you have to register that address with naming authorities. There are variouscommands you can give on the computer to look up ranges of IP addresses and find out from the namingauthority for that country who owns those IP addresses. So that’s what you do to locate the networks.WHAT WERE THE FIRST SUBJECTS YOU SEARCHED?I really was a one-issue person. I felt that since the UFOs were the source of this technology and energytechnology in particular, and that there were so many sightings in America and lots of rumors from secret partsof the government and having recovered E.T. crafts and researching and investigating them thoroughly, thatperhaps the best place would be to start with military sites. List of \"Non-Terrestrial Officers\"WHAT WAS THE FIRST PROVOCATIVE INFORMATION YOU REMEMBER FINDING?I think the first thing was an Excel spreadsheet and the title of which was: 'Non-Terrestrial Officers.'NON-TERRESTRIAL OFFICERS?Precisely. Non-terrestrial officers. (Gary spells out ‘officers’)WHAT DID IT SAY?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Non-terrestrial personnel. It was basically an administrative work sheet. It was literally just a list of namesand ranks. But nowhere - when you do web searches or even an official Army, Navy, Air Force publicationsand literatures – that phrase is nowhere to be found. So at first, I thought I wouldn’t get my hopes up and say itwas literally some kind of non-terrestrial, like non-human. I thought it must be some kind of space-basedterrestrial fleet, like you would have people from Earth doing the development.But that coincided with finding another document, which had lists of ship-to-ship and fleet-to-fleet materialtransfers. None of the ship names matched up to U. S. Navy ships. So, the circumstantial evidence to mepointed towards the development of a new space-going force and hence, the weaponization of space.NON-TERRESTRIAL, MEANING NOT DOWN ON THE EARTH AND NOT NEAR THE EARTH?Precisely. Based off-planet. NASA Airbrushes UFOs from Its PhotosGOING FROM THERE, WHAT WAS THE NEXT WORDS OR INFORMATION THAT STOOD OUT INYOUR UFO SEARCH?Unfortunately, there was only one more. But for me, this was the convincing thing, the smoking gun, as it were.I’m sure you are aware of the disclosure project run by Steven Greer? In a book that they sell, there is anex-NASA photographic expert. Her name is Donna Tietze Hare. And she said she had Secret Clearance inBuilding 8 at Johnson Space Center. There were various projects going on, but they all had Secret Clearanceand you had to have a Need To Know. You could not really tip toe into each others’ projects and have a look.But some of her colleagues she had worked with before and knew on a friendly basis were working close bywithin Building 8. A chap called her over and said, ‘Why don’t you take a look at this photograph?’ It washigh resolution satellite imagery. The view was about ½ to 1 kilometer above the Earth’s surface. There was awhite disc-shaped thing above the trees in the landscape. She said something like, ‘Perhaps that’s a blob onthe emulsion.’ As a photographic expert, she searched for a technical explanation first.He said, ‘Blobs on the emulsion don’t have shadows, do they?’ He pointed to an actual shadow on the groundcaused by the object (in the air). He showed her a few more photographs and she said to him: ‘Well, what doyou mean? Are you basically airbrushing these images out before they reach the public?’ He replied, ‘I’m notsaying anything. You can make up your own mind about what w e are doing here.’OK, so I thought, I’ll use the same method, which was not clever hacking, unlike the media would have youbelieve. I use lots of other peoples’ programs to search for blank passwords. I used the same method onJohnson Space Center. I found plenty of blank passwords. That was quite common, unfortunately. And then, Iused various network commands to strip out the machines that were in Building 8. Again, I did a sort ofsub-net scan on those machines and stripped out the ones with blank passwords there. No Firewalls or PasswordsBEFORE WE GO INTO WHAT YOU FOUND, JUST FOR CLARITY, COULD YOU EXPLAIN ONE MORETIME WHY YOU DON’T CONSIDER THIS HACKING? THAT WHAT YOU ARE BASICALLY FINDINGIS WEAK SECURITY?Yes. Very good point actually. Glad you slowed me down on that one. Yeah, the reason I didn’t consider ithacking is that it was more like logging on. It was sort of a one-trick-pony. I was looking for blank passwords.So, there were no firewalls to begin with; otherwise, I would not have been able to log on from outside thenetw or k.NO FIREWALLS?No firewalls at all. And then secondly, no passwords. And it was not just an ordinary user. I was looking forAdministrator-level passwords, an administrator that would have built an account in most Windows operatingsystems. They have full control over the one local machine that is on.WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT AT THE MANAGEMENT LEVEL IN NASA, WHERE ANADMINISTRATOR WOULD HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WORKING UNDER THEM, THAT PERSON’SCOMPUTER DID NOT HAVE A FIREWALL OR A PASSWORD. IT WAS A DEFAULT SYSTEM?Precisely, yes. And I think part of the trouble is that when you’re working in a huge organization – and I knowthis because I have done I. T. (internet technology) support for banks. If you want everyone to have Windows,you don’t run around with one CD to everyone’s machine. You create what is called an ‘image’ of Windowsand all the office software you are going to use and then you go across the network and write that image toevery single machine’s hard drive. So, it’s a System Administration’s method of making your w ork easier.I think on some occasions because you are on a network level, and when people don’t usually log in with theadministrator on every single machine, if you leave the password blank on the image and then write that imageto every single machine on the network, then unfortunately, every machine is compromised.That was not the way on every network, but that did happen in a few where there were literally thousands ofmachines had blank passwords.SO TECHNICALLY, FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW, IN THOSE ACCESSES, YOU ARE NOT HACKING.YOU SIMPLY HAVE FOUND AN INSECURE SYSTEM IN WHICH YOU ARE ABLE TO BYPASS THEDEFAULT INSTEAD OF A PASSWORD?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Precisely. And it was not even bypassing. It was literally just logging on. But obviously I would like tostipulate that it is still illegal because you are not the legal owner of those credentials. Unidentified Cigar-Shaped Aerial DeviceRIGHT. OK, NOW, PROCEED WITH WHAT YOU FOUND.OK, Donna Hare, ex-NASA photographic expert had said she had seen these air-brushed out photos at JohnsonSpace Center.When I finally got down to those machines, the first machine I was on, I think, because I think the wholenetwork in that building is used for that purpose – these images were 200 to 300 megabytes in size. Bear inmind, this was before Britain had broadband. I was on a 56-K dial-up modem. That’s like 5 minutes permegabyte. There was no way on Earth I was going to download it from my own machine.But the program I was using for remote control of machines – once you had logged on as administrator - gaveyou graphic control. You could sit there in London in my kitchen and be looking at the screen just as if youwere sitting on a chair in front of the actual monitor where the Johnson Space Center is.Also, the images were in a proprietary format. They were not normal jpegs or gifs or anything we are used toseeing. So, I decided the best thing to do was to navigate to one of the images in a folder from the Windowsdesk top and double click it and hope they had the right application software running so it would come intoview. And it did!But because of the size (in megabytes), I still had to turn it down to very low color. I think it was only 4 colorsinstead of 16 million. Very low screen resolution. And even then because the file was so huge, it took awhileto come down the screen.What I saw – I was expecting what Donna had described – saucers above the Earth with maybe land massesoutlined and shadows. But there was only one, unfortunately, that I got a chance to look at. It appeared to behanging in space. The bottom 2/3s of the screen was a curvature (of the Earth).MEANING, JUST SO WE’RE CLEAR, THAT YOU’RE SEEING THE CURVATURE OF THE EARTHBELOW THE OBJECT?That’s correct. Well, I’m assuming it’s the Earth. There were no landmasses visible. But it was the familiarblue and white swirl.OK, SO WE ARE LOOKING IN COLOR?Well, it was not true color. It’s what is called ‘cross-hatching’ or ‘shading’ once you’re down to 4-bit or 8-bitcolor. You’re seeing shades of grey, you’re not seeing actual blue. But they were cloud patterns just as we’reused to seeing from space shots and shuttle shots.SO, NOW, YOU’VE GOT THE CURVE OF THE RECOGNIZABLE EARTH FROM SPACE THAT WE’VEALL SEEN FROM THE SPACE SHUTTLE. WHAT ELSE IS THERE IN DETAIL?[In the NASA photograph] hanging there sort of mid-way between the camera viewpoint and the Earth’ssurface, is a very smooth, almost classic cigar-shaped object. The thing is there horizontally, positionedhorizontally, with almost pointed ends to the cigar, so it wasn’t the classic blunt-ended cigar. Above andbelow, and to the right and left, there were geodesic domes, sort of golf ball-shaped.On closer inspection, there were no rivets, there were no seams, there were no nuts and bolts, there were notelemetry aerials, there were no windows. There was nothing. It just looked unlike anything manmade. It didhave a strange look – it either was very advanced and secretive, or not of this Earth.DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT HOW MANY FACETS THERE WERE ON EACH ONE OFTHE SPHERES? AND WERE THEY HALF SPHERES? OR WHOLE SPHERES?It was very, very clear. It happens that I have a great interest in programming computer graphics and amfamiliar with facets and polygons and whatever. These were very like golf balls, highly multi-faceted. Itwasn’t like sticking to 8 or 16 or 32. And it was half a sphere.IT WAS A HALF?Actually, no on the left and the right might have been - I think they were slightly more than half way. But thetop and the bottom were definitely half. It did slightly remind me of a place over here called Menwith Hill. Ithas sort of golf ball radar stations. But there (Menwith), there are many less facets to those. But they did kindof remind me of those."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Above and below: Ge ode s ic dome s c ove r ing ra da r ope ra tions a t the U . S.

It looked like one preciseshape. It was either very advanced or not manufactured by people.GARY, DID YOU EVER SEE AT THAT TIME ANYTHING ON THE NASA SCREEN THAT SAIDNON-TERRESTRIAL OR EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITY OR ANY WORDS THATWOULD RELATE ANYTHING THAT YOU SAW SPECIFICALLY TO AN EXTRATERRESTRIALINTELLIGENCE?Unfortunately, no. When I eventually got into the networks, I wrote a program to search for files for KeyWords. I had a long list which included what you just mentioned. Apart from that, the Excel spreadsheet wasone. I’m not quite sure where I picked that up. Nothing in NASA about ‘extraterrestrials.’ China Lake, California; Fort Belvoir, Virginia;Fort Huachuca, ArizonaWHAT ABOUT OTHER AGENCIES?The Excel spreadsheet and the document about fleet transfers. Both were from the same network."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"YOU’RE NOT SURE IF THE 'NON-TERRESTRIAL' ON THE EXCEL SPREADSHEET OFNON-TERRESTRIAL PERSONNEL WAS IN ANY PARTICULAR AMERICAN AGENCY SUCH ASARMY, AIR FORCE, PENTAGON AND SO FORTH?I’m pretty sure it was an Army network. It may even have been China Lake, actually. I am just trying to put mymind back to then. It was toward the end, probably late 2001. Either China Lake or Fort ... how do you guyspronounce it? [tries to say Huachuca]FORT HUACHUCA IN ARIZONA. FORT HUACHUCA HAS LONG BEEN LINKED TOEXTRATERRESTRIAL COVER-UP AND SO HAS CHINA LAKE.Right. This is what amazes me. At the time I was doing this, I was playing it blind a lot of the time. In fact,sometimes I wasn’t sure what the function was of the network I was on. I think I may have been in places thatwere more sensitive than I even realized at the time.AND WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT YOU HAVE COME ACROSS CHINA LAKE AND FORTHUACHUCA WITHOUT KNOWING MUCH ABOUT THEM.Yes, the reason I remember them is that they w ere huge, huge networks. Typically you get a few hundredmachines. But on both of those and Fort Belvoir, which is what connected me to Huachuca – you’re talkingabout 5,000 machines per network that were wide open. And that’s where I think I viewed that imagingtechnique whereby you have blank passwords on many, many machines. That’s why I remember the names. Iremember spending a long time in those networks.AND FORT BELVOIR IS WHERE THE CIA IS LARGELY CONNECTED WITH OTHER THINGS.Is that public knowledge?I HAVE REPORTED THIS IN CONNECTION TO INTERVIEWS I HAVE DONE WITH A MAN WHOTOLD ME ABOUT HIS WORK FOR THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY IN THE 1950S, INWHICH THEY SCREENED 16MM FILM OF UFOS IN THE AIR; THAT THEY SCREENED AUTOPSIESON NON-HUMAN EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES; WHERE THEY LOOKED ATPHOTOGRAPHS OF BOTH CRAFT AND ENTITIES FROM OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD. Martian Photographs - Raw?

AND A MAN WAS EXPLAINING TO HER AT THE JOHNSON SPACE CENTER THAT THEYREGULARLY AIRBRUSHED OUT IMAGES OF UFOS FROM HIGH RESOLUTION SATELLITEIMAGES.SO, I WONDERED IF YOU CAME ACROSS ANYTHING HAVING TO DO WITH ALTERINGMARTIAN IMAGES SUCH AS CYDONIA?Oh, I wish I had. That’s something I’ve seen a lot about. It was very strange to me that the last Mars mission,the communications were scrambled. All the TV pictures were not live for a change. It’s the first time in thehi story that i mages w ere show n later. Early 2002: Gary McKinnon Gets Cut OffAt NASA ComputerWhen I was looking at that cigar image on the screen, someone on the machine in the NASA office was still atwork and I think I must have been creating so much network traffic, or they might have seen it on the screenitself. Because I saw the mouse (pointer) move across the screen, right click the local area network icon anddisconnect. Hats off to NASA. That cut me out and I could not get back in. At the same time, they closed off theWindows Port 139 Scanning Method.It w as a horrible moment: very triumphant. But it was also the moment I got caught. I felt badly at the time. Ithought, ‘Criky, I’ve just got to what I have been looking for two years and at the same time got caught w hilefinding it!’I THINK YOU TOLD A BBC INTERVIEWER ABOUT A VERY UNUSUAL AND STRANGE MOMENTWHEN YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE WORKING NIGHTTIME, BUT THERE WAS A NETWORKENGINEER WHO WAS SUDDENLY COMMUNICATING WITH YOU. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT?That was incredibly strange. I can’t remember where I was, but again it’s the graphical remote control, whichis silly really. I’m sure a proper hacker would find another way to interact with the machine rather thanmoving a pointer very visibly across a desktop. But suddenly a WordPad appeared on the screen and someonetyped, ‘Who are you?’ They had obviously seen a mouse moving around.I had to think on my feet. So, I pretended to this guy that I was from the NIPRNET (Non-classified InternetPRotocol and Route Network), the American military’s sensitive UNCLASSIFIED network. I pretended I wasa NIPRNET security engineer and that I had discovered some unauthorized scans coming from this machine.So I was using what I was actually doing as a cover to pretend to this guy that I was an official presence.DO YOU REMEMBER WHICH AGENCY THAT WAS?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"It was probably Army or Navy.WHY WOULD THAT NETWORK ENGINEER IN PERHAPS THE NAVY OR THE ARMY HAVEACCEPTED YOUR EXPLANATION THAT YOU WERE WORKING FOR THAT MILITARY COMPUTERSECURITY?The explanation for that was exhibited very well in his behavior. Having told him that I was from NIPRNETsecurity, he took over and immediately started trying to impress me with his knowledge. He ran a virus scan,he had a port scanner thing that checked the machine while communicating with me in WordPad. His humannature was caught up with impressing me such that he accepted my lie.HAVE YOU HAD ANYONE FROM MILITARY OR CIVILIAN INTELLIGENCE IN ENGLAND OR THEUNITED STATES MAKE CONTACT WITH YOU CONFIDENTIALLY TO SUPPORT THE FACT THATTHERE IS UFO KNOWLEDGE OF EXTRATERRESTRIALS AND BACK-ENGINEERING OF SUCHTECHNOLOGY?Umm, I’ve had contact, but not to confirm the phenomenon, no. These are people who are trying to help me.AND THE IMPLICATION WOULD BE, IF THEY ARE TRYING TO HELP IT’S BECAUSE THEY KNOWTHAT THE TRUTH IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE GOING AFTER EXISTS?That’s a very logical assumption based on the facts. LEGAL CHALLENGE OF AMERICANDEPT. OF JUSTICE EXTRADITION REQUESTCOULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN BETWEEN 2002 AND 2006, WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LEGALSYSTEM BETWEEN YOU IN ENGLAND, WHICH IS YOUR HOME COUNTRY, AND THE UNITEDSTATES?The original arrest was by something called the National High Tech Crime Unit here in England.IT IS OFFICED IN WHICH AGENCY?It no longer exists. They have been absorbed into a new super agency. I think it is now equivalent to the FBI,called the Serious Organized Crime Association (SOCA).WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE ARREST AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE? March 2002 Arrest Under U. K.'s\"Computer Misuse Act\"The initial arrest in March 2002, I was told by the arresting officers that I was got under the Computer MisuseAct in Britain. They said that I would spend maybe 6 months to a year in prison, but most probably communityservice.Then I was on police bail, in which you don’t pay any money. They just trust you to not run away. I did twopolice interviews in the same year of 2002. The first of which was very friendly and they were kind oflaughing and joking about little green men.But in between the first and second interview, the National High Tech Crime Unit went over to the Office ofNaval Investigation, I think in Washington, D. C. They came back with a very much more heavy attitude. Theyseemed to be very impressed by the top brass over there (in U. S.). November 2002 American Departmentof Justice Threatens ExtraditionAfter that second interview in November 2002, then came the threats from theAmerican Dept. of Justice that they would intend to pursue an extradition case, which is unheard of incomputer hacking.GARY, WHAT WERE THE GROUNDS THAT THE AMERICAN DEPT. OF JUSTICE WAS SAYINGTHAT THEY COULD EXTRADITE YOU, AN ENGLISH CITIZEN, WHO YOUR GOVERNMENT WASPREPARED TO PENALIZE YOU UNDER YOUR COMPUTER MISUSE ACT?OK, well, in 2002, Britain was under the auspices of one of our older extradition bills. I think it goes back to1989. But having made the threats, the DOJ did not actually pursue the application and put forth a formalrequest until 2004, which was a year after a brand new U. K. and U. S. only extradition treaty – the 2003 U. K.Extradition Treaty. That changed the face of our extradition law in that it put NO pressure on the requestingparty; i.e., the people who want to extradite you – America, in this case. They put NO pressure to provideevidence at all. You just have to provide what they call prima face evidence, a solid case to get solid groundin evidence – evidence being the key as to why this person should be extradited."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"2003 New U. K. and U. S. Extradition Treaty ProposedMy legal team and I think this is a definite tactical delay on behalf of the DOJ to wait until there is a law inplace, which makes it easier. Bear in mind, the 2003 treaty was formulated for the fast-tracking of terroristsuspects. It’s being absolutely misused now. They are using it for white-collar crime. It’s been used andabused.On top of that, not only has it been misused, it’s only been signed by the British. Congress, or the Senate, orwhoever does that job on your end has NOT ratified it yet. So, it’s a one-sided treaty, which I think – I may bewrong – but I think that’s illegal in international treaty law. So, that’s a tactical delay from the threats in late2002 until mid-2004, with nothing happening. It’s still hanging over my head. June 2005 Re-Arrested for American Extradition WarrantI was not actually re-arrested until June 2005.THAT RE-ARREST WAS WHY?Because they put forward an indictment and a warrant for my extradition. It formalized the extradition request,more than saying, ‘We intend to extradite you.’ They actually waited until the act was in place and then putforward a formal request, which ended up being an arrest warrant for the British police to pick me up.BUT YOU ARE SAYING IT WAS INITIATED BY THE AMERICAN DEPT. OF JUSTICE?What’s called the CPS, the Crown Prosecution Service – they are kind of an intermediary above the police.They (CPS) decided to hand it over from the National High Tech Crime Unit to the American authorities. TheNATCU, the Crime Unit, were very angry because it’s a very high profile arrest case in cyber crime, which istheir field of endeavor. It’s a feather in your cap – you get a bigger budget and more respect. But when I askedsomeone quite high up in the CPS why this happened? Why did I get handed over on a plate from onegovernment to another, when I could very well be tried and prosecuted in my own country?He said, ‘This came from way over my head. It came from very high up.’ Now, whether that means someone inthe Crime Prosecution Service above him gave the go ahead? Or there is some political shenanigans going onand someone in the top brass connected to E. T. research said, ‘We really want this guy!’ And my governmentsaid, ‘OK, you can have him.’ Who know s? But the strange thing about this is that America has extraditionagreements with, I think, it’s 119 or 120 countries. And only two of those countries will extradite their owncitizens without any evidence and that’s Britain and Ireland. America did not ask publicly for this stipulation.But Britain seemed to hand it over on a plate. 2003 U. K. and American Extradition TreatyStill Not Ratified by U. S.?AND TO DATE, AS YOU AND I SPEAK ON MONDAY, JUNE 5, 2006, THE UNITED STATESCONGRESS OR AGENCY IN OUR GOVERNMENT HAS STILL NOT SIGNED THIS EXTRADITIONTREATY WITH ENGLAND?Supposedly that’s exactly true. In fact, the last meeting the U. S. Senate had was behind closed doors. Thereare no reports on what they said, but the outcome of it was that they refused to move forward on it. I think therewere some complications that had to do with the IRA and Irish nationals living in America. I hear there is ahuge Iri sh backl ash (in U. S.).BUT, GARY, IF OUR COUNTRY HAS NOT SIGNED OFF ON THIS EXTRADITION TREATY WITHENGLAND, HOW COULD WE BE EXTRADICTING YOU TO THE UNITED STATES IN THIS MONTHOF JUNE IF THAT IS THE CURRENT PROPOSED PLAN?That’s a very good question. I think a treaty implies more than one partner to it. You would assume thateveryone would have to sign it for it to have full legal effect. But Britain is just steam rolling ahead andsaying yes to every request without evidence except that you have to identify this is the person you want andhave an affidavit by experts saying, ‘We accuse him of this and this and the other.’A one-sided treaty – who’s ever heard of such a thing?! Also, it’s retrospective. So, although the treaty wasenacted in late 2003 – which was rushed through Parliament here in England, by the way. It was at a time thatmost MPs (Members of Parliament) were on holiday at Christmas time and they used something called theQueen’s Statutory Instrument, a speci al w ay of forci ng somethi ng through.I’m not very happy with the laws around here. All I want is to be tried in my own country under my own lawsystem.THE TREATY THAT WAS RAMMED THROUGH IN ENGLAND DURING THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYAND STILL HAS NOT BEEN SIGNED BY THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE RETROACTIVE TOWHICH YEAR?That’s a very good question. I think there is no backwards limit. Fighting Extradition in European Court of Human Rights"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"WHAT DOES YOUR LAWYER THINK ABOUT THE CHANCE OF YOUR DEFEATING THEEXTRADITION REQUEST?I think on the face of it that’s unlikely the way things are going, the erosion of civil liberties, especially sinceBritain and the U. S. are such great partners. We are also great partners when it comes to eroding our civilliberties. You can look at the changes in health and education over here to parallel the changes in health andeducation in your ow n country. We almost have a copy of your government. So, on the face of it, not veryhopeful. But, if you get the public awareness. In America, you have a great tradition of governments reallylistening to public pressure. That’s a really healthy thing about your system over there.Over here, they don’t really tend to listen quite so much. But that’s what we are trying to do. I think she(attorney) thinks that if we can get the public opinion behind us and get enough people to speak up and see howunfair the law is, and if enough people listen and it airs widely enough, hopefully it will change the law. AllI’m asking is for a fair trial in my own country.”More Information:For further information about the American government's cover-up of an extraterrestrial presence, please seereports below in the Earthfiles Archives and my books, Glimpses of Other Realities, Volumes 1 and II;An Alien Harvest; and my documentary films, A Strange Harvest and Strange Harvests 1993, in theEarthfiles Shop.• 06/01/2006 -- Recent Cattle Mutilations in Kiowa County, Colorado• 05/18/2006 -- Top Secret UFO Retrieval During 1983 Grenada War• 05/12/2006 -- An Extraterrestrial School for Humans• 05/08/2006 -- Another Extraordinary EBE Telepathic Upload/Download• 05/05/2006 -- Military Man's Description of EBE Telepathic Download• 04/28/2006 -- Modern Warfare Applied to Extra-Terrestrial Invasion• 03/23/2006 -- Part 2: U.S. Navy Chief Yeoman Describes \"Extraterrestrial Biological Entities\" in TOPSECRET/MAJIC Photographs• 03/17/2006 -- Part 1: U.S. Navy Chief Yeoman Describes \"Extraterrestrial Biological Entities\" in TOPSECRET/MAJIC Photographs• 02/27/2006 -- Part 4: Military Voices Reply About Government Interaction with UFOs• 02/17/2006 -- Updated: White Sands Navy Radar Operator Saw Discs Circle V-2 Rocket Launches• 02/10/2006 -- Crashed Disc Photos, \"Ebens,\" and Area 51 \"Anti-Gravity\"• 02/05/2006 -- Part 11 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs• 01/27/2006 -- Part 2: Navy Physicist and USAF Geophysicist Discuss UFOs and ETs• 01/20/2006 -- Part 1: Navy Physicist and USAF Geophysicist Discuss UFOs and ETs• 01/13/2006 -- 31st Cattle Mutilation on Red Bluff, California Ranch• 12/24/2005 -- Part 3 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs• 12/21/2005 -- Updated: Part 2 - Peculiar Phenomenon, Early United States Efforts to Collect and AnalyzeFl yi ng Discs• 12/17/2005 -- Sirius's Companion Star, Sirius B, Finally \"Weighed\"• 12/07/2005 -- Zeta Reticuli I and II - Binary Home of Extraterrestrial Biological Entities?• 12/02/2005 -- Former Canadian Minister of Defence Calls for Public Parliament Hearings About UFOs andExtraterrestrials• 11/02/2005 -- Part 3: Unusual Animal Deaths -Sheep Mutilations in Moortown, Dartmoor, England• 10/27/2005 -- Updated Part 1: Unusual Animal Deaths - 22 Horses and 1 Burro Near Calhan, Colorado• 09/08/2005 -- Canadian UFO Researcher Blocked by U.
