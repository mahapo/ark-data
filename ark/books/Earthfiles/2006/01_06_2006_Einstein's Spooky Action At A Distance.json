If you now measure on earth theone that remains, you find it's spinning clockwise. Then you know that the fiveother ones on the moon will also spin clockwise, but there's no physical interactionbetween them.\" - Dietrich Leibfried, Ph.D., NIST January 6, 2006 Boulder, Colorado - In this New Year, time and events seem to hurdleforward faster and faster while advanced computers become smaller and smaller. Somephysicists even think by mid-21st Century, there could be quantum computers in whicheach bit would be an atom. A quantum computer would use one of the strangest propertiesof our universe to calculate mathematical problems quickly that might take billions ofyears for classical computers to solve.I'm talking about the high strangeness of quantum mechanics in which atoms are observedto be spinning both clockwise and counter-clockwise at the same time. That simultaneousspinning in two directions at once is called \"superposition.\" Physicists have repeatedlyconfirmed that the position in time and space for atoms and subatomic particles is alwaysuncertain until an observer tries to measure where the atom or particle is. Then instantly,the simultaneous spinning in opposite directions \"collapses\" its wave-like state into ameasured particle that either spins clockwise or counter-clockwise on a 50/50 randomchance like the toss of a coin.Only in the past ten years has laser technology advanced to become a tool that canprecisely interact with atom spin directions. It's a new field in quantum physics called\"precision laser spectroscopy.\" Physicists who use lasers are studying one of quantummechanic's many mysteries. Einstein called it \"spooky action at a distance\" and it alwaysbothered the great physicist who wanted the atomic world to conform to his GeneralTheory of Relativity that predicts strict order in the large macro worlds of suns andplanets.But Einstein's orderly relativity theory does not work at the randomly uncertain atomiclevel where particles can be waves spinning in two directions all at the same time andeffect each other at a distance without any physical connection. This high strangeness iswhat provoked the famous Austrian physicist, Erwin Schroedinger, to question whether acat placed in a box was both dead and alive until someone opened the box to look. Thecat's state, Schroedinger wondered, might be as uncertain as the spin and position of anatom until it's observed.In the past decade, no physicist had been able to measure more than one or two atoms at atime. But when they did, there was always confirmation of \"spookiness at a distance.\"That means scientists discovered that measurement of only one atom's spin directioncaused another atom to match that spin direction. Physicists began calling thisphenomenon \"entanglement.\"Now for the first time, a scientist from Germany working at the National Institute ofStandards and Technology in Boulder, Colorado, has made a major breakthrough inquantum entanglement. Dr. Dietrich Leibfried earned his Ph.D.-equivalent in physics fromLudwig Maximillian University in Munich and did post-doctoral studies under thesupervision of 2005 Nobel Prize-winning physicist, Dr. Ted Hench.Dr. Leibfried wanted to use lasers on beryllium atoms and see how many he couldentangle at once to spin the same direction no matter when observed. The answer so far issix six beryllium atoms prodded by a precision laser in a vacuum."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"NIST physicists coaxed six beryllium atoms with one electron removed (ions),so they would carry one positive charge which could be trapped and held with electromagnetic fields in avacuum.The blue light is the precision laser spectroscopy used to artificially affect the nucleus spin on onewhich affected the other five nuclei so that all six \"are collectively spinning clockwise and counter-clockwiseat the same time.\" Image credit: Bill Pietsch, Astronaut 3 Media Group, Inc.Actual photomicrograph of the six beryllium ions held by an electromagnetic field and laser cooledto about 1/1000 of a degree above absolute zero in a vacuum. Dr. Leibfried: \"To produce the picture, we canscatterlight from a laser on the ions into a CCD camera. The inside ions are roughly spaced by 2 micrometers,the spacing is a little larger for the outside ions, so we have to use magnifyingoptics to create the image.\" Image courtesy NIST.Once entangled, those six atoms are always going to spin the same direction no matter howfar the atoms are separated from each other.Dr. Leibfried also wonders how many atoms must be entangled to reach a threshold whereEinstein's General Theory of Relativity takes over on the macro scale. Is Schroedinger'scat always big enough for humans to tell if it's alive or dead when the box is opened?Interview:Dietrich Leibfried, Ph.D., Research Physicist, National Institute of Standards andTechnology, Time and Frequency Division 847, Boulder Colorado: \"If we look at ourevery day experience, we would certainly say, for example, that the cat is either dead oralive. You'll never see that it's dead and alive. But if you look at quantum theory, such apossibility would exist. Basically there is a problem with what we see in every day life andwhat quantum mechanics predicts.It seems that when you look at single atoms, there is no problem with superposition states.They are very well established. You can have things like one atom spinning counter-clockwise and clockwise at the same time. This has been done for many years.CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT SINCE IT'S SO PUZZLING. HOW CAN ANYTHING BEGOING IN TWO DIRECTIONS AT ONCE?I don't think I can explain that and I'm in good company there. If you noticed in The NewYo r k Ti m e s article (12-28-05), there have been some quotes featured by great scientists byNiels Bohr and (Richard) Feynman and (Albert) Einstein and others. They all basically allboil down to: you can't really explain how this works. You can just accept that it works likethat.HOW DO YOU MEASURE SOMETHING SPINNING IN TWO DIFFERENTDIRECTIONS?Basically what you can measure is its spin either in one direction or the other. The onlyexplanation that is compatible with all your findings is that it really has been in asuperposition, or spinning both ways at the same time. Every time you look at it, yourandomly get the answer that it's clockwise or counterclockwise. But you can neverpredict which way it goes.IS IT LIKE SPINNING OR TOSSING A COIN? IS IT 50% CLOCKWISE AND 50%COUNTER-CLOCKWISE?Yes, that's how the measurement would look. But as long as you don't look at it, it justremains in this eerie superposition state."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Young's Double Slit Experiment - Photon SuperpositionWHAT IS THE THEORY ABOUT WHY ATOMS SHOULD EXIST SPINNING BOTHCLOCKWISE AND COUNTER-CLOCKWISE AT THE SAME TIME?(sighs) What should I say to that? The only way you can explain certain experimentalfindings is that if you assume they can take this crazy state. There is another famousexperiment you might have heard of that sort of shows the same features and it's calledYoung's Double Slit Experiment.There you have two slits and you can have, for example, light passing through the slits.Even if you make the light source extremely weak so there is only one photon at a time,you will get an interference pattern on a far away wall that looks like only one photonpassed through both slits at the same time. Again, the superposition state. You get theinterference pattern because there was a superposition. If you would assume that thephoton goes through only one of the slits, you would never get that interference patternyou see.If you accept that, you can build a theory that works well for atoms. If you don't accept it,you're in trouble. That has been like that for almost 100 years now.In a graphic depiction of Thomas Young's 19th Century \"double slit experiment\",the nearest screen had two slits through which light passed. Beyond is the striped interference pattern thatresultedafter only one photon in a wave state passed through both slits at the same time - a superposition.THAT'S WHAT BOTHERED ALBERT EINSTEIN SO MUCH?Yes, what bothered him especially is that if you look at the thing, you get a random result.That's what he did not like. He also thought there might be what he called 'hiddenvariables' behind the whole thing. So, there's a bigger theory that tells you which slit, forexample, the photon went through. You just don't know the theory yet, you don't haveaccess to the variables in the theory. They are hidden. But in principal, they exist. It's A Random Universe?If you assume that, you can set up some inequalities and that was done by John Bell lateron. You can show that quantum mechanics do violate the inequalities. John Bell was verydismayed by that because he was on Einstein's side. He wanted to actually prove that thereare hidden variables, but experiments proved the inequalities do not work out. Now, wehave to assume that there is no local realistic theory with hidden variables that would dothe job. So, Einstein still has to be bothered by that.THE BOTTOM LINE IS: IT'S A RANDOM UNIVERSE?Yes. But this also offers some positives, I would think. For example, if everything isdeterministic, what about free will? Can you really make decisions? Or was it allpre-determined by the initial conditions of the universe? If there is some randomness,perhaps it offers some positive aspects. I would not say it's only disturbing. It could also besomething that gives human decisions another dimension. \"Spooky Action At A Distance\" with 6 Beryllium AtomsCOULD YOU GO THE NEXT STEP AND ADDRESS THIS 'SPOOKY ACTION AT ADISTANCE'?Yes, so as soon as you accept there are superpositions and you also have several systems"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"you take apart. For example, instead of looking at one atom or one photon, you can nowlook at the possible quantum states of two atoms, let's say. You can put them into a statewe call 'entangled' and this is basically what we just pushed to the present limit of 6 atoms,which is not very many, of course. But that's all we can do so far.YOU ARE ADJUSTING THE SPIN OF THE ATOMS WITH LASERS?Ye s .THAT'S THE ENTANGLING OF THE SIX?Yes. You have to do certain operations, certain laser pulses to get the entanglement. Theidea is there that you get this state where you don't know anything. It's at the same time,clockwise and counter-clockwise, but now for all six of them. They either all go clockwiseor all go counter-clockwise. Nothing in between.Now, you can think of the following situation. Of the six beryllium atoms we haveentangled, you take five of the atoms and put them into a spaceship and send them to themoon. If you now measure on earth the one that remains, you find it's spinning clockwise.Then you know that the five other ones on the moon will also spin clockwise, but there'sno physical interaction between them. If you measure the one down on earth to spincounter-clockwise, you know that the other ones will also be counter-clockwise. So beforethe measurement, you did not know anything at all. After the measurement, you knowwhat the guy on earth is doing and you even know what those remotely stored atoms willdo (on the moon). That is really strange because there is no physical interaction betweenthem. You, the researcher, go from a state where you know nothing about those guys to astate where you know everything about them.IF THE 6 BERYLLIUM ATOMS SPLIT APART BETWEEN THE MOON AND THEEARTH ARE ALL SPINNING THE SAME DIRECTION, DOES THAT IMPLY THATALL OF THE BERYLLIUM ATOMS IN THE UNIVERSE AT THAT MOMENT ARESPINNING IDENTICALLY TO THOSE SIX?Oh, no, not at all. It's only the six you prepared in a rather complicated fashion. That wasthe feat achieved in this experiment, that you can - it was hard to even entangle twoparticles so far. And only in the last ten years or so, we've learned technology to do it withsix atoms. If the six beryllium atoms were entangled with everything else, then some otherguy in Germany could do an experiment and measure something and that would affect theoutcome of my experiment. That would be trouble because how could I ever do acontrolled experiment? I would have to control the whole universe to do that. So, it's reallyonly the ones I'm looking at, that I'm preparing in my experiment. It's not other atoms. Could Consciousness Interact Physically At the AtomicLevel?BUT YOU ARE IMPLYING THAT ENTANGLEMENT IS HAVING TO INVOLVESOME KIND OF CONSCIOUSNESS BY YOU AND THE RESEARCHERS ON THOSEAT O M S .Not necessarily.WHAT IS IT THAT DOES THE ENTANGLING?The entangling is done by physical interactions that we can tailor the right way to get thestate in a controlled fashion. But there are also 'random events' that can result in entangledparticles.We have quantum mechanics that gives us superposition and entangled states. But we alsohave a huge environment always looking on to these quantum systems and theenvironment basically forces that we see cats either dead or alive and we don't seesuperpositions because there are so many things interacting with the cat that could figureout whether it's dead or alive, for example, by interacting and seeing what the temperatureof the cat's body is, or if the cat is breathing, it will move some air particles around it.ISN'T THE IMPLICATION OF QUANTUM PHYSICS THAT EVERYTHING FROMTHE ATOMIC LEVEL TO THE GROSS MACRO MATTER LEVEL IS IN ALLPOSSIBLE INFINITE STATES OF BECOMING AND BEING AND DYING ALLSIMULTANEOUSLY?I wouldn't go so far, I think. We are really touching on questions I don't feel comfortableanswering, to be honest. But at least I can offer my personal take on it. I think that this"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"environment hypothesis at least lets you explain what you locally observe. So, withouttaking the whole universe into account, you just acknowledge that you can only look at avery small subsystem. Then you will see results like cats being dead or alive. If you look atthe whole universe, you're basically in this conundrum that you just talked about.MEANING THAT ALL THE CATS IN THE UNIVERSE ARE ALIVE AND DEADSIMULTANEOUSLY.In that small part that I look at, it seems to me it's in a definite state. This has all kinds ofphilosophical implications. My take on it is that you just need to do more experiments andmaybe you will figure it out eventually. Or maybe it's just something beyond our reasoning.There are people who believe that basically what we can perceive with out brains is noteverything, so there is something outside of what we can perceive and we just get the bestpossible description what we can see with our senses and process or think about and thenwe get the best possible description and that is quantum mechanics. But there are morethings out there than we can see. Are Atomic Entanglement and Its Spooky Action At ADistanceNecessary to Produce Macro Reality?IS THE WORK YOU ARE DOING IMPLYING THAT THERE MUST BE SOME KINDOF ENTANGLEMENT AT THE ATOMIC LEVEL FOR THERE TO BE SOME KIND OFDEFINITE SLICE OF REALITY? THAT WE PERCEIVE A SLICE OF REALITYBECAUSE AT THAT MOMENT IN THE LOCAL UNIVERSE, THERE IS SOME KINDOF ENTANGLEMENT?I would say yes. So, if we look at the small system, there is certainly some kind ofentanglement where we see all the quantum weirdness there. In our every day life, wedon't. There must be some boundary or whatever that distinguishes these two worlds: ourevery day life and what we can do in the laboratory.Now, doing this with more and more atoms will just give you a better idea where theboundary is. At some point, you would just expect that things break down and you will seewhat you see in every day life. Maybe that's at 10 atoms? Maybe it's at 100 atoms? Maybeit's at a million atoms? Or maybe it's at 10 to the 26th atoms, which would be sort of likewhat a cat has.AT THAT POINT, WHEN YOU GET THAT MASSIVE AMOUNT OF ATOMS,SOMETHING CHANGES IN THE PHYSICS?Possibly so. There are theories that predict that, too. But that's basically what nobodyknows. In order to explore that, you just have to try to build larger and larger entangledsystems and see what happens. That's the experimental way of looking at it.WHAT IF THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THE STATE OF THE ATOMS AND WHATMAKES UP ATOMS IN THIS UNIVERSE THAT IS AFFECTED BY CONSCIOUSNESSAND THAT WOULD EXPLAIN 'SPOOKY ACTION AT A DISTANCE?'I would not feel comfortable endorsing anything like that because I think it elevatesconsciousness to being sort of a physical property and there's no evidence so far that it'sreally true. You can conjecture this, but I don't think there is any kind of experimentalproof to show that.BUT IT'S TRUE THAT TODAY STILL ONE OF THE BIGGEST MYSTERIES INQUANTUM PHYSICS IS: WHAT CAUSES ENTANGLEMENT IN THE FIRST PLACETHAT ATOMS AT A DISTANCE WOULD ALWAYS SPIN THE SAME WAY?Yes. But as far as I'm concerned, there is no connection to consciousness there.BUT OTHERS WOULD ARGUE THERE MIGHT BE?Yes, you can certainly there is a puzzle there and there is something that people don'tknow. But, if somebody comes up with an experiment that would show that consciousnessis involved, fine with me.\" Dr. Leibfried told me he thinks it's possible that a quantum computer might be built by themiddle of this century in which each bit would be a single atom that spins the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"simultaneously clockwise and counter-clockwise, equivalent to zeros and ones. He said inour current computers, we enter one input and get back one output. But in a quantumcomputer, the superposition of atoms spinning simultaneously clockwise and counter-clockwise would be like many \"parallel universes\" of zeros and ones at work. For example,to search for, and find, one phone number out of a billion phone numbers could be done bya quantum computer in a fraction of a second, while the classic computer might takehours.Entanglement also opens up the future possibility of instantaneous communication acrosslight-years without radio waves. Perhaps such superposition technology is why SETI nevergets radio signals?All this is especially incredible given the fact that no human even knew electrons existeduntil J. J. Thomson's discovery in 1897, only one hundred nine years ago.More Information:For more about quantum physics, please see reports below in Earthfiles Archives :· 03/25/2005 -- Glow of Distant Worlds Seen For First Time· 10/25/2003 -- Science Data Reinforces Invisible \"Dark\" Matter and Energy MakeUp 96% of Our Universe· 10/11/2003 -- Is Our Universe Finite and Shaped Like A Dodecahedron?· 09/07/2002 -- Does Gravity Travel the Same Speed as Light?· 02/24/2002 -- Mysterious Slowing of Pioneer Spacecraft 7 Billion Miles from Earth· 02/27/2001 -- Slowing Light to A \"Stop\" for Fraction of A Second· 12/20/2001 -- Will Our Universe End With Its Final Light Frozen in Time?· 01/28/2000 -- Black Hole Mystery at the Center of the Andromeda GalaxyWebsite: NIST: http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/cat_states.htmCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2010 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2010, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
