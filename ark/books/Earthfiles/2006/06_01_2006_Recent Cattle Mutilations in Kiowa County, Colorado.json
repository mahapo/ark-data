Hundreds of animal mutilations since the 1960s have been reportedto law enforcement in Kiowa County and surrounding region.The Chuck and Sheri Bowen windmill-powered watering hole on their 13,000-acreranch near Eads. P hotograph © 2006 by Chuck Bowen.June 1 , 2006 Lamar, Colorado - I began traveling with my television crew in Kiowa, Elbert, El Paso,Logan and many other eastern Colorado counties in the fall of 1979 as I began my documentary investigation ofthe animal mutilation mystery which was frustrating ranchers and law enforcement that year - again. Since atleast the 1960s, ranchers had been finding horses, cattle, sheep, goats, rabbits and other domestic and wildanimals dead with the same excisions of tissue, usually without blood or tracks. Typically, if a dead animalwere on its right side, the left ear, eye, jaw flesh, tongue and even teeth, trachea and esophagus were excisedin \"neat, surgical, precise cuts.\" In males, the penis and testicles are either totally removed in an oval excision,or some parts of the male sexual organs are removed. In females, whole udders can be cut hide-deep, leavingbehind large circular, square or triangular patterns in the belly. Or only the teats are cored out. Or half theudder neatly cut away. The vaginal tract is almost always cored out in females. And in nearly every mutilationcase, regardless of sex, the rectal tissue is cored out in 6-inch-diameter holes that extend into the body as faras fourteen inches or more.After nine months, my investigation was broadcast in a two-hour special entitled A Strange Harvest onKMGH-TV (then CBS), Channel 7, in Denver. I reported what law enforcement and ranchers told me, on andoff the record: that \"creatures not from this planet\" were doing the mutilations. Later in 1997, I was to meetand talk with retired Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso, author of the book, The Day After Roswell. In private, Col.Corso emphasized to me that he had seen official classified documents in Washington, D. C. which describedworldwide unusual bloodless, trackless animal deaths in which the same patterns of tissue had been excisedani mal to ani mal and country to country in both hemi spheres. Col . Corso told me the earl i est date he saw onthose classified documents was 1951 and the mutilators were named as \"extraterrestrial biological entities.\"It's now a half century later and animal mutilations continue. Investigators in Chile and Argentina report thatsince 2002, over three thousand dead and mutilated animals have been reported to law enforcement andveterinarians. Just like the Colorado and other cases over the years, pathologists have confirmed the SouthAmerican animals are being cut with high heat, some technology that is cauterizing the tissues. Many cases arealso associated with mysterious lights and beams in the sky."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"On the Bow en ranch eighteen miles from Eads, Something strange killed two pregnant black Angus. The firstwas found on February 13, 2006; the second on April 1, 2006. Both animals were near Sand Creek and the siteof the notorious Sand Creek Massacre of November 29, 1864, when U. S. Army soldiers killed more than 200Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians. Chuck and Sheri have uncovered about 3,000 artifacts by searching with ametal detector.Sheri and Chuck Bowen with a metal detector and shovel on their Sand Creekranch near Eads, Colorado. P hotograph provided by the Bowens.Interview:First Pregnant Cow Mutilation DiscoveredFebruary 13, 2006Black Angus About 8-Years-Old, First CalfChuck Bowe n, Ranche r, Eads, Kiowa County, Colorado: “I was out checking the cows as we always do.We feed them Monday, Wednesday and Fridays – that’s what I did in the wintertime. At first I thought she haddied having a calf because it was the calving season. Then when I saw her is when I found out she had beenmuti l a te d .The cut was on the left side of her head and it appeared to be with a sharp knife cut along her jawbone andthen around her eye and then back to her nose, kind of a triangular shape and all that skin was removed on theside of her head. That’s really about all we saw as far as mutilation. It appeared that she had died just instantlybecause usually around an animal, there will be some thrashing about when they die. Her legs, tail, everythingwere totally still. The grass, for instance, was straight up on either sides of her legs and either sides of her tail.Usually there would be kicking and the ground disturbed around by her moving tail. There wasn’t any of that.It’s just like she had been laid right down in the grass unmoving.February 13, 2006, Chuck Bowen discovered one of his pregnant black Angus cow's deadand mutilated, laying on brittle February grass that was unbroken and without tracks.P hotograph © 2006 by Chuck Bowen."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The pregnant cow's legs were laid onto the pasture without any signs of struggleor broken grass. Photograph © 2006 by Chuck Bowen.IN FEBRUARY, WAS THE GRASS KIND OF BRITTLE?Yes, in February it would be.SO IF ANYBODY HAD WALKED OR DRIVEN AROUND THE COW, YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN SOMEKIND OF DAMAGE TO THE GRASS, WOULDN’T YOU?Right. And we had the Sheriff investigate. We didn’t find any signs of a footprint, car track or anything.Neither he nor I could.WAS THERE ANY BLOOD ANYWHERE?Yes, on this one that was one of the unusual things. There was a lot of blood around where the cut had been.The fact is that when we found her, it was still oozing blood out of the excision, which the Sheriff thought wasvery unusual for a dead animal to continue to bleed that way. We figured she had died 24 hours before that.Pregnant black Angus cow's left lower jaw was stripped of flesh which bled onto the grassaround the head. The cut is typical of classic animal mutilations, but the bleeding was not. No examinationof tongue was done, so it's not known if the tongue was also removed as in mostmutilation cases. P hotograph © 2006 by Chuck Bowen. DID YOU OPEN UP HER MOUTH TO SEE IF HER TONGUE WAS MISSING?No, w e didn’t have anything to open her mouth with. I think we did think her tongue w as missing, but I don’tknow for sure that.UDDER, VAGINAL AND RECTAL TISSUE?Yes, it was all there. Nothing had been done there, so that was also unusual for most mutilations. The only partwe saw cut out was the left jaw. It also seems like the left eye might have been gone, but the ear was there.DID YOU REPORT THIS TO THE KIOWA COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE?Yes, I did.WHEN THEY CAME OUT, DID THEY SAY YOU SHOULD GET A NECROPSY DONE OR DO ANYFORENSICS?They asked us if we wanted to do that, but said it would be up to us to do it (pay). So I did call our vet and hesaid in order to do anything like that he would have had to know about it immediately within the first hour orso. High Strangeness"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"“There were still other cows around when I found her and they were very bothered by whatever had happened,very upset. One of the cows was even throwing her front hooves into the air and bellowing. She would kind ofwalk around the (dead cow) and kick her legs up in the air and bellow. I thought this was very odd behavior.She was scared to death.IF YOU’VE BEEN RANCHING FOR 30 YEARS, YOU’VE NEVER SEEN THIS BEHAVIOR BEFORE?No, I never had.AND YOU INTERPRETED THAT THE COW WAS SCARED TO DEATH?Yes, that’s how I interpreted it – whatever happened just scared her to death.SHE WAS THE ONLY COW ACTING THAT WAY?There were others around her that acted bothered, but not quite that extreme. They were like walking aroundher like in circles. But this one was the only one that acted bizarrely, I guess.Also, since I do a lot of my metal detecting out there, I carry a metal detector, which I had with me that day.And I thought if somebody killed her with a gun, maybe I could locate a bullet in her. So, I ran my metaldetector over her. The strange thing was that I did not find a bullet, but like over her entire body, the detectorread – it tells me what kind of metal I’m finding. When I ran it over her, it came up on the screen that it was‘foil,’ like some kind of aluminum foil or some kind of lightw eight kind of metal. I thought that was reallystrange.YOU WERE GETTING THAT FOIL READING AS IF THE COW WAS SOMEHOW ENCASED ORLAYERED WITH A LIGHT FILM OF FOIL?Yeah, that’s probably how I would describe it – a light film of metal. It didn’t produce a beeping sound like itdoes if I find lead or iron or something like that. There was just a kind of light hum and on the screen it wouldlight up ‘foil.’ Like there was a light metallic thing over her body.DID ANY PREDATORS APPROACH HER BODY?No, it seemed like the coyotes weren’t really bothering her or anything. But the birds w ere. Birds had been allover her. Usually the coyotes are eating on them (dead cows) right away, but this one – in fact after all thistime (3.5 months since mid-February and 2 months since April 1), the cow carcasses still haven’t beenbothered by the coyotes. Second Pregnant Cow Mutilation DiscoveredApril 1, 2006Pregnant Black Angus, Calf Partially Born ( Only photos by Kiowa Sheriff's Office)\"Pretty close to April 1, 2006, on the opposite side of Sand Creek, she was kind of behind a slight 6-foot highbank, so I didn’t see her right away. It was actually more like two or three days before I found her. She wasactually in the process of having her calf, but of course, it died, too.SO WHEN YOU FOUND HER, THE MOTHER HAD THE EXCISION FROM THE JAW AND THEUNBORN CALF WAS WHAT? PARTLY INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE BODY?Yes, it was half way out. It was a perfectly normal birth: both front legs were out and it was just ready to be, ifthe back legs had come out, it would have been a perfectly normal birth. So just half way out, yes.COULD YOU GO BACK OVER THE HEAD AND BODY OF THE MOTHER ABOUT EXACTLY WHATYOU SAW TAKEN?It was just exactly the same thing – the cut along the lower part of the jaw and around the eye and nose and thatpiece of skin removed. Oh, the different thing was that there was no blood at this site.AND CUT FROM THE CALF?No.DID YOU LOOK IN THE MOUTH OF THIS ONE?No, it was too late to try that. Oh, the Sheriff took – he sent his deputies and they took photos of this one.WHAT IS CLOSEST DISTANCE TO NEIGHBORS AND DID THEY SEE OR HEAR ANYTHINGUNUSUAL?I did talk to the neighbors. They didn’t see anything unusual and they haven’t had this happen to them. Thereare neighbors to the east and their house is three miles west of where it happened.THEY DID NOT SEE OR HEAR ANYTHING UNUSUAL?No, none of them did.NO ONE OUT THERE HAS HAD ANYMORE MUTILATIONS?No, and what prompted me to go to the news is that horse which was mutilated in Fort Lupton."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"YOUR RANCH IS NEAR THE KANSAS BORDER?Yes.FORT LUPTON WOULD BE ABOUT 200 MILES NORTHWEST?Yes.IT WOULD BE THE SAME PASTURE LAND WHERE YOUR FATHER FOUND MUTILATED CATTLEIN THE 1970S TO 1980S?Yes, those mutilations were on the same ranch, but about five to six miles on up Sand Creek. And they weremore your classic mutilation with the tongue and udder gone and no blood at all on any of them.\"More Information:If you have any information about the unusual animal deaths in Kiowa County, Colorado, please contactEarthfiles, which would like more information about any unusual animal deaths around the world.Please email: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.For further information about the worldwide animal mutilation phenomenon, please see reports below in theEarthfiles Archives and my books, Glimpses of Other Realities, Volumes 1 and II; An Alien Harvest;and my documentary films, A Strange Harvest and Strange Harvests 1993, in the Earthfiles Shop.• 01/13/2006 -- 31st Cattle Mutilation on Red Bluff, California Ranch• 11/02/2005 -- Part 3: Unusual Animal Deaths - Sheep Mutilations in Moortown, Dartmoor, England• 10/30/2005 -- Part 2: Unusual Animal Deaths - Another Half Cat Mutilation in San Antonio, Texas• 10/27/2005 -- Part 1: Unusual Animal Deaths - 22 Horses and 1 Burro Near Calhan, Colorado• 10/22/2005 -- A Lifting Beam Technology in Colorado Human Abduction• 10/03/2005 -- 2005 Horse Mutilation in France• 09/15/2005 -- Animal Mutilations Reported in Switzerland, Hollywood and Kansas• 08/26/2005 -- Another Cattle Mutilation in Canada• 08/22/2005 -- More Half Cat Reports: San Jose and Seattle• 08/13/2005 -- Mystery of Bloodless, Decapitated Kangaroos in Melbourne, Australia• 08/11/2005 -- Part 4: Two Men See Cow Mutilated in Light Beam• 08/03/2005 -- Part 3: Two Men See Cow Mutilated in Light Beam• 08/03/2005 -- Another Cattle Mutilation in Pondera County, Montana• 07/28/2005 -- Feedback on Half Cat Mystery• 07/26/2005 -- Part 2: Two Men See Cow Mutilated in Light Beam• 07/22/2005 -- Part 1: Two Men See Cow Mutilated in Light Beam• 07/14/2005 -- More Half Cat Mutilations in Seattle, Washington Region• 07/07/2005 -- Part 2: Eyewitness Description of Cattle Mutilation• 07/04/2005 -- Part 1: Eyewitness Description of Cattle Mutilation• 07/01/2005 -- U.
