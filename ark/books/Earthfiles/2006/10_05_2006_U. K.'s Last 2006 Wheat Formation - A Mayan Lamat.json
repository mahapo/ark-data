K.'s Last 2006 Wheat Formation - A Mayan \"Lamat\"?© 2006 by Linda Moulton Howe \"Great Cycle of 13 Baktuns.\" A Mayan Baktun is thirteen cycles of 394solar years that equals the Grand Calendar.October 5, 2006 Mexico City, Mexico - The beginning of the Mayan \"Long Count\" or\"Great Cycle\" calendar is variously located between August 6 and August 13, 3113 B. C.on the Christian calendar. In Mayan chronology, the beginning date is written 13.0.0.0.0.The \"Great Cycle of 13 Baktuns\" will complete on December 21, 2012, current era, andthe Mayan Long Count calendar will reset to 13.0.0.0.0. A Baktun is 394 solar years. So,the change over to this current thirteenth Baktun that ends in 2012 began in 1618. The Wars of 1618 and NowThe socio-political parallel between the beginning of this 13th Mayan Baktun in 1618 andthe end of the Baktun in 2012 is eerily similar. In 1618, the Thirty Years' War began,principally on the territory of today's Germany, and involved most of the major Europeancontinental powers. The war was both a religious conflict between Protestants andCatholics and a rivalry between the Habsburg dynasty and other powers. One example isthat Catholic France even supported the Protestant side, in its increasing rivalry with theHabsburgs. The physical fighting ended in 1648 with the Treaty of Westphalia, but thefamine and disease of the Thirty Years' War caused damage in Europe for another 300years.On March 20, 2003, the George Bush \"dynasty\" invaded Iraq allegedly to fight terroristsand provoked an even more intense religious war between Islam (Muslim) extremists andnon-Islam. The Mayans expected similar past, present and future events to re-occur atcertain repeating nodes in the cycles of time.Jose Arguelles wrote in his 1987 book, The Mayan Factor:\"Like the Buddhist and Hindu cosmologies, the Mayan describes a universe ofinfinite cycles of time and being. If anything, the Mayan is even more precisein its computations of these cycles. In any case, the contemplation of thefar-ranging and all-encompassing cycles inevitably led to a consideration ofthe fact that we are not alone, that infinite other world systems exist moreevolved than that of our own system.\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Three Mayan CalendarsThe Mayans were obsessed with time and kept three calendars going simultaneously: 1) the Long Count; 2) the Tzolkin, or Sacred Calendar; and 3) a solar calendar called Haab.The Long Count has ticked away time through 13 Baktuns of 394 years each; the Tzolkinwas used to keep track of 260 days in 20-day increments in an endlessly repeating cycle;and the Haab counted out 365 days of the Earth's revolution around the sun. Lamat Symbol in the Tzolkin CalendarIt is in the Tzolkin that the Lamat symbol appears. Jose Arguelles wrote:\"The Tzolkin is generally considered as the 260-day Sacred Calendar - thenumbers one through thirteen repeating twenty times in conjunction withtwenty Sacred Signs - in actuality it is much more. Taken as a grand calendar,the Tzolkin describes the Mayan Great Cycle, or Hologram of Time.\"Arguelles also recognized the Tzolkin's similarity to the Chinese I-Ching,which is allegedly synchronized with the spiral DNA of genetic code. \"Whilethe I Ching is precisely synchronized with the genetic code, the Tzolkin issynchronized with the galactic code.\"Beginning with one dot in the upper left corner and descending in a countof thirteen and repeating that thirteen count twenty times.

They build on eachother and reference each other for meaning. Also, a certain meaning is also gained by theirrelation to each other in the order in which they invariably appear. ...In this presentation,the Signs describe a process of development, the path of life itself. The first seven Signsrepresent the cycle of the lower body or physical being, while the remaining thirteen Signsdescribe the evolution of the higher mental body.\"Arguelles: \" Symbol 8. Lamat = Star, Harmony, The Octave,Intuitive Realization of Pattern of Higher Life, Love, Star-Seed. SOUTH.\"Graphic © 1987 by Jose Arguelles.What did this symbol literally mean to the Mayans? \"Star,\" often the planet Venus. Venus"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"was a major player in the Tzolkin. Mayan astronomers even calculated correctly itssynodic period as 584 days.[ Editor's Note: The synodic period is the time that it takes for the object toreappear at the same point in the sky, relative to the Sun, as observed fromEarth; i.e. returns to the same elongation. This is the time that elapses betweentwo successive conjunctions with the Sun and is the object's Earth-apparentorbital period. The synodic period differs from the sidereal period since Earthitself revolves around the Sun.] Mayan Obsession with Cycles of TimeThe Mayans honored 52-year-cycles as sacred and in two 52-year-cycles - or 104 years -Venus makes 65 revolutions back to where it started - another cycle for the Mayans totrack and celebrate.L F Rodriguez, wrote in a 1985 report entitled \"Astronomy Among the Mayans\" for Rev.Mexicana Astronom. Astrofis. 10: \"The Mayan concern for understanding the cycles ofcelestial bodies, particularly the Sun, the Moon and Venus, led them to accumulate a largeset of highly accurate observations. An important aspect of their cosmology was the searchfor major cycles, in which the position of several objects repeated.\"The Dresden Codex w hich contains Mayan observationsabout Mercury, Venus, Mars, the Moon and the Sun.

At least 1,400 years ago, Mayanscientists accurately calculated the length of Earth's annual revolution around the Sun tobe 365.242 days. Our modern astronomers say it is 365.242198 days. Other Mayanastronomers found that 149 lunar months lasted 4,400 days which meant that a lunarmonth was 29.5302 days. The modern day calculation is 29.53059.Jose Arguelles wrote in The Mayan Factor: \"On certain of their monuments, we find therecording of dates and/or events occurring as much as 400 million years in the past. All ofthis they did with a unique and incredibly simple, yet flexible, numerical system thatcounted by twenties instead of tens and used only three notational symbols - dots, linesand an oval (shell shape?) for zero. Why? And to what end?\"That use of zero and extraordinarily accurate astronomical calculations provokedarchaeologist Sylvanus Griswold Morley in 1935 to say about the Maya:"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"\"When the material achievements of the ancient Maya in architecture,sculpture, ceramics, the lapidary arts, feather-work, cotton-weaving anddyeing are added to their abstract intellectual achievements - invention ofpositional mathematics with its concomitant development of zero,construction of an elaborate chronology with a fixed starting point, use of atime-count as accurate as our own Gregorian Calendar, knowledge ofastronomy superior to that of the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians - and thewhole judged in the light of their known cultural limitations, which were on apar with those of the early Neolithic Age in the Old World, we may acclaimthem, without fear of successful contradiction, the most brilliant aboriginalpeople on this planet.\" Mayans - From A Larger Galactic Community?Aboriginal? Jose Arguelles argued in The Mayan Factor that the probable source of theMayan civilization was extraterrestrial and that all the brilliant astronomical and calendarknowledge had one mission: \"This mission, it seems, was to place the Earth and its solarsystem in synchronization with a larger galactic community. ...The key and the code leftbehind by the Classic - or shall we say the galactic - Maya describing their purpose andtheir science is embedded in the deceptively simple system of thirteen numbers and twentysymbols called the Tzolkin.\"Arguelles's hypothesis was that the Maya perceived resonant frequencies symbolized intheir glyphs and cyclic counts. Their knowledge was not confined to the Earth. Arguellesdescribed resonant frequencies driving the cosmos, from the Mayan point of view, and akey to the evolution of this solar system and Earth is the frequency of the galactic core.The Tzolkin, Arguelles said, was \"spinning through its endless fractal harmonics andovertone permutations. ...what we find recorded on the great stone monuments and certainof the extant codices, or painted manuscripts, is actually the skill the Maya demonstratedin showing the relation between the galactic harmonic and the annual cycles of the Earth,Moon, and other planets of the solar system\" - especially Venus, the Lamat, the eighthsymbol in their 20-count in the Tzolkin.And it is the Lamat Cycle which concludes the last twenty years of the Mayan Long Countcalendar from 1992 to 2012. It is in this period that the Earth can either transform inArmageddon annihilation or \"a galactic synchronization with the beyond.\"\"Lamat\" formation in wheat at Etchilhampton Hill, near Devizes, Wiltshire,England, reported on August 15, 2006. Estimated diameter is about 300 feet.Aerial image © 2006 by Cropcircleconnector.com.Interview:"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Jaime Maussan, Investigative Reporter, Jaime Maussan Productions, Mexico City,Mexico: \"As you know, I went to England because I was expecting that these messagesthat we have found in the month of August would happen again, as it happened in 2004and 2005 – with the so-called 'Mayan messages.'For that reason, I thought that something was going to happen and we were expecting asignificant Mayan-type formation. I went with a group of Mexicans, who stayed inWiltshire from August 5 to 15. Unfortunately, they did not have a chance to see this Lamatformation because they left before we knew this had happened.But I decided to stay because I was very confident that something would happen, that wecould have a message. For that reason, on the morning of August 15, after I heard a rumorthat there was a new formation at Etchilhampton, I went there with an Englishman, a cropcircle hunter, Tony Cook.Etchilhampton Hill is in the far left corner of the map.

But the formation on the ground was the purest and mostdelicate that I have ever seen. All those many thin lines! We could not imagine what itwas, but we saw thin lines. That’s why I thought it was also going to be a 3-dimensionalformation.WHAT WAS THE WIDTH OF THOSE LINES?The width of those thin lines were probably five to ten inches, no more than ten incheswide. It’s impossible to walk in them and to make those kind of lines without leaving atrace, a path - I don't think it's possible. It was so perfect. The perfection and complexity"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"of this formation was really amazing.The thin lines were estimated to be about ten inches wide.Above: Pole shot of the \"Lamat\" formation © 2006 by Cropcircleconnector.com.Below: Close-up of a single thin line and one of the pointed star corners © 2006 by Jaime Maussan.Then that day, I went up in a plane. We still did not know exactly what the pattern was,but we thought it could be connected to the Mayans. And then the next day at The SilentCircle Café we found in a Mayan calendar all these symbols of the Tzolkin sacredcalendar. It has 20 different signs for 20 days that keep repeating in a cycle for 260 days."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Near the forested hilltop of Etchilhampton Hill, Wiltshire, England,the wheat formation was reported on August 15, 2006.Aerial photograph © 2006 by Jaime Maussan.Lamat is the first and last symbol in the Dresden Codex, in the Table of Eclipses. It startswith a Lamat day and will finish with a Lamat day. The last Lamat day we have in thattable is May 19. We have to remember that in the calendar formation that we had last year(2005) at Wayland’s Smithy, right in the center was an eclipse, a partial solar eclipse. Wealso found an arc and this arc means zero. The zero in the horoscope of the Mayan is May20.Wayland's Smithy ancient mound surrounded by trees behind \"Mayan Calendar.\"The center standing crescent around downed wheat circle was interpreted by someas a solar eclipse on the Tzolkin calendar starting a new \"zero day\" of May 20.Aerial photograph © 2005 by Lucy Pringle.Annular Solar Eclipse of May 20, 2012Annular solar eclipse courtesy NOAA.[ Editor's Note: An annular eclipse occurs when the Sun and Moon are exactlyin line, but the apparent size of the Moon is smaller than that of the Sun.Hence the Sun appears as a very bright ring, or annulus, surrounding theoutline of the Moon.]That day the moon, Earth, the Sun, the Pleiades will be aligned and we will be, accordingto the Mayans, in direct alignment with the center of our galaxy. For that reason, it is avery important astronomical day. We found that eclipse date in the 2005 Wayland’sSmithy formation. For that reason, my geologist friend, Calderon, considers that thisEtchilhampton message is related to the message at Wayland’s Smithy. He is consideringthat Lamat is probably the sign of the change of the era, the end and beginning of the newera. According to codex information, the transition of the Lamat end of the big calendarwill start with the solar eclipse on May 20, 2012. And we know that the calendar of theMayan will finish in December.We also have to remember that we are moving toward a very big cycle of the Sun, theSolar Maximum. According to many scientists around the world, this one is going to be"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"spectacular, very strong. We have to remember the Mayan prophecies told us that the Sun,would more or less take out of balance all the natural systems of the Earth. This wouldchange the conditions of the Earth and our civilization.I don’t believe this is going to be the end of Earth or human beings. I think it is going to bea big change and I think the Mayans tried to say that a long time ago. I don’t know if theythought we were going to be here and they did it for us (later generations)? Or they did itfor themselves? But somehow, they knew of these cycles of the Sun and for some reason,they thought this day, May 20, 2012, is going to be a very important day.We will also have the transit of Venus across the Sun then on June 5 to 6, 2012. For manyinvestigators, Lamat also represents Venus and Calderon believes that this Lamat atEtchilhampton is a message related to the end of the Mayan calendar and the veryimportant upcoming transit of Venus. For the Mayans, astronomical events were decisive,were somehow designed for the change (of eras). Caldron believes that the Etchilhamptonand Wayland's Smithy formations are related to each other and he expects more in the nextyear (of 2007).Calderon also thinks the Lamat symbol in Mayan means ‘deep,’ deep inside you. It meansyou can make an introspective trip into yourself, and there you will find respect and lovefor yourself. Through that, you can find love for others, the tolerance and compassion.That’s more or less what Lamat means – it’s a new era or change when human beings aregoing to learn to respect themselves and through that, respect others and be morecompassionate and tolerant.We believe that this is going to mark the end of an era, the end of old values and thebeginning of new values. We believe it’s somehow announcing a new human being. At thiswars around the world moment, it seems almost impossible, but this is what the old Mayancivilization left us to know. We will all observe this happening. Right now, we know thatwhoever is doing these formations in England is using this knowledge to remind us aboutthat and these two symbols try to give us information about something they know, or theyshare with the Mayans about the future. We should be very respectful of this and shouldobserve what is going to happen in the future.WHY IS IT THAT MAYAN GLYPHS WOULD BE PUT DOWN IN ENGLAND ANDNOT IN MEXICO?That’s a very good question, but I don’t know. The formations in England are not beingdone by the Mayans. They are being done by some intelligence, which is using the Mayansymbols, because we understand the Mayan symbols, to impart information. These are realmessages and I think the crop formations are probably one of the most important thingshappening in the world.WHY DO YOU THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR HUMANITY TO BE GIVEN NOTICEABOUT WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN 2012, EVEN THROUGH THE MAYANCALENDARS?It seems as the Mayans knew we are going to have a (Solar Max) cycle of the Sun thatcould change conditions on the Earth at this time. They knew about the Sun, the cycles ofthe sunspots, about the moon, the cycles of the moon.We don’t know yet who the Mayans really were with all their knowledge, or how old theyreally were. Perhaps they were much older than we think. Perhaps they came fromsomewhere else off planet? I don’t know. Where did they get all their knowledge? Weshould be more interested in that.\""},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"August 15, 2006, \"Lamat\" wheat formation at Etchilhampton,Wiltshire, U. K. Aerial image © 2006 by Lucy Pringle.
