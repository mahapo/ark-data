Military Intelligence, Flying Discsand Plane CrashesOn June 27, 1947, it was announced that \"two top generals\" from U. S. Army Ordnance would visit WSPGthe week of June 30. Major General Everett S. Hughes, the commanding general in charge of U. S. ArmyOrdnance and Brig. General Henry Saylor, Chief, Research and Development Group and a member of JRDB'sUpper Atmosphere Rocket Research Panel. The two Generals were visiting WSPG to \"inspect the new safetydevices installed on V-2s\" and to witness the next launch on July 3. But there really were no new safetydevices on V-2s to inspect and there would not be a V-2 launch on July 3. [ Source: El Paso Times, June 27,1947.]On June 28, two people were killed when their \"low flying\" rented plane struck an electric pole, sliced off awing and crashed into Lake Ontario. The plane had been flying lower than the treetops. [ Source: The NewYork Ti mes, June 29, 1947, p. 25.]The New York Times, June 29, 1947, p. 25.Also, two men died in \"a blazing plane after it had smashed into the roof of a one-story bungalow\" in Canaan,Connecticut. It took hours to remove the bodies that had been \"embedded\" into the roof of the house. The planecould not gain altitude after take off and flew directly into the roof setting it on fire. The plane, based inBrooklyn, was on its return trip when the accident occurred.

His \"blood stained shirt and cap\" were reportedly found in an alley in Albuquerque on July 3.Whitacre was assigned to the AFSWP at Sandia Base. There might have been $500 in cash on him when hedisappeared. So, robbery was was suspected motive. But the Army was concerned about his disappearancebecause he possibly \"had sensitive information about atomic bombs.\" What happened to Corporal Harvey S.Whitacre of the AFSWP? [ Source: Las Cruces Sun-News, July 18, 1947.]Also reported to be on June 30, but might have happened earlier, was 18-year-old \"discharged soldier,\" JoseG. Serna of Mountainair, was fatally burned when the car he was driving ignited in flames about 45 miles fromwhere Mac Brazel would find the flying disc debris. Serna lost control and his car rolled down a 300 footembankment. With his clothes on fire, Serna crawled out of the crashed car and rolled in the grass to smotherthe flames. He died in Albuquerque. [ Source: Las Cruces Sun-News, July 2, 1947.]At Tinker Army Air Field, the first of many standard military replies were voiced about the flying discsightings. \"Oh, applesaucers,\" said Col. Frederick Bell. He said he would like to meet the man who flew thediscs. Another cynical jet pilot added that possibly those people making the reports \"were seeing headlinesinstead.\"On July 2, 1947, the Army released a statement that said that although the Army believed that most peoplewere sincere, there was a form of mild hysteria circulating and that the flying disc phenomenon is more \"like astudy in human psychology\" than a study of aerial phenomenon. This military propaganda came only five daysafter Army antiaircraft artillery in a modified Wasserfall surface-to-air missile - or perhaps an Army airForces fighter piloted by Capt. Dyvad - had just shot down two flying discs over WSPG. An Army Generalcalled a press conference and assured the American people that \"we weren't being invaded by men fromMars.\"By July 5, 1947, flying discs had been reported in at least thirty-one states. Many of those reports were fromEl Paso, Las Cruces and Carrizozo in southern New Mexico and West Texas. [ Source: Las Cruces Sun-News,July 6, 1945.]On July 2, 1947, the high energy physicists involved in the development of America's first atomic bombs wererecalled to Los Alamos Laboratory for \"summer research\" by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). TheAEC's request came five days after the U. S. Army knew that it had succeeded in bringing down two examplesof the foreign (disc) technology. Aviation experts believed they might be nuclear powered.[ Source: Las Cruces Sun-News, July 2, 1947.]The physicists asked to join the \"summer research\" at Los Alamos included Enrico Fermi, who had left LosAlamos only two years before and was brought back from the University of Chicago. Another physicist wasEdward Teller, who would go on to develop the hydrogen bomb and establish Lawrence Livermore NationalLaboratory. Others were Frank Hoyt, also from the University of Chicago; Frederic J. de Hoffman fromHarvard; John Calkin from Rice Institute; Robert Bacher from Cornell; G. K. Rollefson from the University ofCalifornia; Charles Critchfield from the University of Minnesota; and Joseph Keller from Iowa StateUniversity. All came together in July 1947 at Los Alamos \"to work together on the hill.\"Then on July 4, 1947, Corona rancher W. W. (Mac) Brazel reported to the Roswell Sheriff that he foundremains of a crashed flying disc in one of his pastures 40 miles north of White Sands Proving Ground.[ Source: Crash At Corona © by Stanton Friedman.]Continued in Part 18 - The Plane Carnage ContinuesMore Information:For more about military voices and Majestic-12 leaked documents, please see reports below in EarthfilesArchives:• 03/17/2006 -- Part 1: U.S. Navy Chief Yeoman Describes \"Extraterrestrial Biological Entities\" in TOPSECRET/MAJIC Photographs.• 03/23/2006 -- Part 2: U.S. Navy Chief Yeoman Describes \"Extraterrestrial Biological Entities\" in TOP"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"SECRET/MAJIC Photographs.• 02/27/2006 -- Part 4: Military Voices Reply About Government Interaction with UFOs• 02/22/2006 -- Part 3: Military Voices Reply About Government Interaction with UFOs• 02/21/2006 -- Part 2: Military Voices Reply About Government Interaction with UFOs• 02/17/2006 -- Updated: White Sands Navy Radar Operator Saw Discs Circle V-2 Rocket Launches• 02/07/2006 -- Part 1: Military Voices Reply About Government Interaction with UFOs.• 03/26/2004 -- Back Engineering ET Craft•03/17/2004 -- Part 1 - \"Horrible Secret\" in UFO Crash Retrievals Near Roswell, New Mexico, in July1947?•03/17/2004 -- Part 2 - \"Horrible Secret\" in UFO Crash Retrievals Near Roswell, New Mexico, in July1947?For more about American military aggression against UFOs, crash/retrievals and UFO retaliation, please seereports below in Earthfiles Archives :• 04/05/2006 -- Part 16 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs• 03/23/2006 -- Part 15 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs• 03/09/2006 -- Part 14 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs• 02/28/2006 -- Part 13 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs• 02/27/2006 -- Part 4: Military Voices Reply About Government Interaction with UFOs• 02/22/2006 -- Part 3: Military Voices Reply About Government Interaction with UFOs• 02/21/2006 -- Part 2: Military Voices Reply About Government Interaction with UFOs• 02/19/2006 -- Part 12 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs• 02/17/2006 -- Updated: White Sands Navy Radar Operator Saw Discs Circle V-2 Rocket Launches• 02/07/2006 -- Military Voices Reply About Government Interaction with UFOs.• 02/05/2006 -- Part 11 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs• 01/29/2006 -- Part 10 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs• 01/17/2006 -- Part 9 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs· 01/17/2006 -- Part 9 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and AnalyzeFl yi ng Discs· 01/09/2006 -- Part 8 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs· 01/03/2006 -- Part 7 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs· 12/31/2005 -- Part 6 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs· 12/27/2005 -- Part 5 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs· 12/24/2005 -- Part 4 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs· 12/24/2005 -- Part 3 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs· 12/21/2005 -- Part 2 - Peculiar Phenomenon, Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs· 12/19/2005 -- Part 1 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs· 05/03/2005 -- Part 3: Japan Air Lines Pilot Interview About November 1986 UFO Encounter· 05/03/2005 -- Part 2: Japan Air Lines Pilot Interview About November 1986 UFO Encounter· 05/02/2005 -- Part 1: Japan Air Lines and Mile-Diameter UFO, November 1986, Drawings and Transcript· 04/17/2005 -- 1949 Aerial Disc Covered-Up By Project Blue Book As \"Kite\"· 04/14/2005 -- \"Battle of Los Angeles\" On February 25, 1942: America Fired At A UFO· 02/11/2005 -- Story Behind \"Inflation-Theory Implications for Extraterrestrial Visitation\"· 12/30/2004 -- Audience Feedback About Earthfiles \"September 12, 1952: America's 'Secret War'?\"· 12/30/2004 -- September 12, 1952: America's \"Secret War\"?
