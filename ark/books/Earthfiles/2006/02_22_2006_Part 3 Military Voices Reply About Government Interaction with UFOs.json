S. Navy physicist, Bruce Maccabee, about hisdiscussions with a USAF geophysicist referred to as \"Hawk.\" See two-part 012106Earthfiles. I also reported more about former New Mexico State Representative AndrewKissner's (Dona Ana County, Las Cruces) investigations of V-2 rocket research at WhiteSands Proving Ground in 1947 when aerial discs interfered with launches. See \"PeculiarPhenomenon\" Real X-Files series beginning with 121905 Earthfiles. Since these several reports, I have received more than a hundred e-mails from people whohave either firsthand military and/or intelligence backgrounds, or are relatives of peoplewho have such backgrounds. Many have asked that their identity remain anonymous. Ifeel it is valuable to share some of the e-mails and hope other Earthfiles viewers and radiolisteners will contact me with additional information that complements, or goes beyond,what I am posting in this first in a series of Earthfiles military voices.Continued from 020706Earthfiles:Military Voices Respond to January 2006Earthfiles and Radio Reports13) UFOs Caused V-2 Rocket Tests At White Sands to Go 180 Degrees OffCourse and Crash\"My stepdad was stationed at White Sands Proving Ground in 1953 to 1954and worked on missile recovery. I was there when Werner Von Braun wasthere and I went to school with his son. At the time, it was a small communityand everyone lived on post. The U. S. Navy was there testing various missiles,lots of V-2 firings and FireBee testing.\"I recall that my stepdad would fly to a missile impact and recover the manyping pong balls that were scattered on impact. There was a time when the U.S. Navy was testing a Talos missile and there were several unexplainedfailures. The techs who worked on the electronics swore they checked eachmissile several times prior to flight, but for a period of time, missiles would do180-degree turns on themselves (like the Juarez, Mexico UFO incident) andcrash.\"I recall several times at gatherings of adults as they talked shop, it wasmentioned that UFOs had done it (caused the missiles to veer off course andcrash). I remember once when the base went on alert because a missile wentastray and crashed near the White Sands monument.\"[ Editor's Note: According to history written by the Smithsonian National Airand Space Museum, \"In July 1944, the Navy's Bureau of Ordnance requestedSection T of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) tostudy anti-aircraft missiles to counteract the Japanese Ohka piloted bombs andother suicide weapons sent against the United States in the Pacific. Therequirement was for a missile to shoot down a plane at a range of 20,000yards at an altitude of 30,000 feet.\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Four months later by November 1944, the Navy's Bureau of Ordnanceassigned the Applied Physics Laboratory of the Johns Hopkins University inSilver Spring, Maryland, to undertake the development of radar-guidedsurface-to-air missiles. This project became known as Bumblebee whichproduced several ramjet-powered missiles which evolved from the 1945 STVto the 1951 Terrier to the 1958 Talos. Also see: Earthfiles 12/21/2005 and4-part series Earthfiles 12/04/2004.Original full-scale replica of America's first surface-to-air missile,the Supersonic Test Vehicle (STV), called Bumblebee, or the \"Flying Stovepipe.\"Demonstration flight was on October 16, 1945, Island Beach, New Jersey, and reached1400 mph. Produced by Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Baltimore, Maryland.Bendix SAM-N-6/IM-70/RIM-8 Talos - The Ta l o s long-range surface-to-airmissile was the ultimate result of the U.S. Navy's Bumblebee program, whichalso led to the SAM-N-7/RIM-2 Te r r i e r and RIM-24 Ta r t a r missiles.Bumblebee was begun in 1944 with the goal to create a ramjet-poweredanti-aircraft missile. The initial development was done by the Applied PhysicsLab of the John Hopkins University, and APL started to fly the Cobra ramjettest vehicles in 1945, which eventually led to the larger PTV-N-4 BTV(Burner Test Vehicle) in 1948. The Ta l o s was to have a primary beam-ridingguidance system, and in 1948, supersonic beam-riding was demonstrated withthe CTV-N-8 STV (Supersonic Test Vehicle). These tests proved verypromising, and STV was actually developed into a tactical missile of its own,the SAM-N-7/RIM-2 Te r r i e r medium-range SAM. The final Ta l o s test vehiclewas the RTV-N-6 XPM (Experimental Prototype Missile), which first flewsuccessfully in 1951 as the RTV-N-6a3. By that time, the Ta l o s SAM hadbeen assigned the designation SAM-N-6 by the Navy. The first full Ta l o sprototype (XSAM-N-6) flew in October 1952, and later that year, the firstsuccessful intercept was made by an RTV-N-6a4 test vehicle. Because therequired missile performance was increased several times during development,the Ta l o s SAM did not become fully operational until 1959, almost a decadelater than originally planned. Bendix became prime contractor for Ta l o sproduction. All Ta l o s variants had some surface-to-surface capability,although probably only the nuclear-tipped versions would have been reallyeffective. In 1963, all variants of Ta l o s were redesignated in the RIM-8series.] 14) V-2 Missile Crashes and UFOs\"My father was old for the draft, but none the less was drafted as a pooryoung man from Kansas with a highschool degree. After taking an aptitudetest, he was sent to Rutgers University in New Jersey for a one-year crashcourse in engineering. My mom and newborn brother were living with a sisternear New Jersey so to be close to my dad. An officer showed up one day andinformed her that my dad had been reassigned and to stay put in New Jersey.She would receive his pay, but would not be able to know the nature of theassignment. She was not to be alarmed as she would receive nocommunication.\"At the same time, my dad was being loaded onto a train with blacked ouwindows for a three-day journey that made several stops and picked up bothcivilians and military - each car was overseen by MPs (military police). The"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"trip ended about midnight as the passengers were offloaded onto buses withblacked out windows at a remote train station with all signs covered. Thebuses drove until morning where they unloaded at an encampment in pinemountains (Los Alamos). My dad was stationed at Los Alamos until the warended and he was in the Corp of Engineers where he oversaw a workshopwhich built whatever the scientists requested. Most people did not know (andwere not allowed to discuss) what other groups were doing.\"He was allowed to begin writing my mom after a couple of years. The lettersat first had an Albuquerque Post Mark, but were highly censored. She wasallowed to come to New Mexico near the end of the war and my mom anddad were allowed a few short afternoon supervised visits in a park in Santa Fe.\"After my dad was able to get his ME (mechanical engineering) license inTexas, in addition to commercial private sector work, he did consulting MEwork for DOE, DOD, DOA, DON and many facilities, but especially at WhiteSands, Holloman AFB, Sandia Labs and the Navy Site (Naval ResearchLaboratory at White Sands). I do know he worked on mechanical systems fortest facilities as well as basic HVAC for buildings. When he retired, he told methat at that time there was not a building or installation on WSMR that he hadnot had some involvement with.\"Through all this, my parents instilled in us a deep mistrust of our governmentat all levels, which I saw grow to almost a level of paranoia (especially in mymother) before they passed away. My conclusion can only be that they sawand knew firsthand the deceit of our government.\"When my dad would mention the V-2 crash in Juarez, Mexico, it was withdisdain! As a kid we used to climb up to several plane crash sites on theFranklin Mountains above El Paso, if my memory serves, in the 1949 to 1951era you spoke of. The crashes at the time were blamed on the weather, buteven as a kid I would think, 'Why are they so low on the mountain?'Franklin Mountains rise above El Paso, Texas.\"In the late 1970s, I lived near Anthony, New Mexico, with a clear view ofAnthony Gap (a pass between), the Franklin Mountains and the OrganMountains with White Sands Missile Range on the other side. There weremany nights I watched with amazement as lights moved strangely through theair. My inquiries were answered as 'night training and testing of helicopters.'Then one morning at 2 a.m., I thought we were experiencing a 'closeencounter' when everything lit up and started shaking. There was a deepbeating feeling, but not a loud sound. A large black military helicopter barelymissed my house and took a hard landing across the lane in an onion field. AsI ran out, I was met with an order to go back into the house as there werealready MPs in vehicles around it. By morning, it was gone. I still wonderwhat I was watching in the sky?\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Franklin Mountains in El Paso south of Fort Bliss Military Reservation,Alamogordo/Holloman AFB and White Sands Missile Range, known as White Sands ProvingGround in the 1940s to 1950s.
