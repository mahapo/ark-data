Below is a sampling for consideration.1) From Female Artist, Illinois\"Dear Linda,Several months ago I had a problem with my gum under and to the side of a molar, inside mymouth. This new bump got very painful and I went to see a dentist and he was going to dopossible mini-surgery to see what was so painful under this new rising bump. I could feel that itwas like a hard piece of bone.My appointment was scheduled several days in advance but the bump was almost unbearableso while I could feel it with my finger nail and could tell it was somehow pushing out....orrather my body was pushing it out...I got a tweezers and I actually grabbed it and pulled thedarn thing out myself! The pain was instantly gone and the spot healed very quickly, withinhours! I looked at it with a powerful diamond loupe and it looked exactly like the photo of thatlittle mass taken from a Child's lip! I even wondered how on earth fibers were very muchentwined into the live bone tissue. I didn’t even set it down before grabbing the loupe to look atit so I know those fibers were there and clearly within the tiny bone structure. I still have thislittle piece in a plastic bag and of course the bone is dried now...but the fibers are still thereentwined!( needless to say, I canceled the dentist appointment and told the dentist it came out and wasjust a piece of bone...not bothering to say anything more about the strange fibers in it.)It looks (((exactly))) like this second photo (below) you posted on Coast to Coast AM. Thingsjust keep getting stranger and stranger! If I didn’t pull this out of my own mouth I would noteven believe in that Morgellons 'disease.' (It may not be a disease at all.) But now I know thatthe debunkers of this new phenomena are flat wrong!\"Objects emerging from lesion on child's lip at 200x.Image courtesy Morgellons Research Foundation.2) Australian Scientist"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"\"It has to be an infectious agent where the bug genome carries a connective-tissue gene, sayactin or pili, etc.One possible therapy might be dietary selenium or seleno-methionine: most AIDS patients diein part due to Se deficiency.The virus makes huge amounts of its own seleno-proteins, which then deplete normal amounts,leading to chronic fatigue.The only reliable way to i.d. the bug would be to micro-sequence its major protein-peptides,then work backward to get a PCR test.The Morgellons foundation could pay for such tests on contract from a mass-spec facility, ifsufficient sample? Only a few hundred dollars.Give me a unique non-human peptide sequence, and I would be able to design specific PCRprimers right away.\" 3) K.A., Montana:\"I read your story on the Morgellons illness and have been following the research into what itmay be. I have also been following the chemtrail news and there seems to be a link between thetwo, and that is the fiber. I read that the fibers coming out of the lesions are fluorescent and canbe seen using a black light. The same information is being said about the fibers coming from thechemtrails. Please look at www.carnicom.com/micro3.htm with scientific information and labreports on the fibers coming from the chemtrails. The microscopic pictures of the fibers fromthe lesions and fibers from the chemtrails are virtually identical.\" 4) Los Angeles, California Resident:\"Listening to your interview with George on C2C...Have been hearing about this disease and I had a thought albeit a bit wacky...Under the current conditions where we're being sprayed incessantly with chemtrails...I am wondering if there might be a connection.The skin is the largest body organ.Things emerging from the skin are usually the body trying to clean itself out.If we're breathing in polymers daily...or almost daily as in the case of Los Angeles...could it bethat the body is trying to eliminate these polymers?I personally have noticed the associated fatigue and fog head associated with thespraying...This could be just the next step. The fact that it's happening on such a wide scalecould also be explained by the spraying... All just thoughts but maybe it will help somehow.All the best to you. Thanks for your work.\" 5) JD, Location Unknown.\"I believe you will find that Undecylenic Acid will cure Morgellons Syndrome. It can bebought over the counter and it works very quickly. You might want to pass this on to those whocan use this information.\"6) Tustin, California Writer\"Morgellons Disease- Try 1/2 tub Hot bath water with 1 pound boxof IODIZED SALT for rash/ itching relief... it seems to work and meltsthe 'scalp-scabs' that stick to the clumps of hair follicles.\" 7) Ohio Resident\"(Morgellons sufferers) might try food grade hydrogen peroxide (diluted of course) and/orcolloidal silver, two excellent antifungal/anti mold treatments...as well as a complete systemicantifungal cleanse (check health food stores).\" 8) San Francisco, California Vegetarian\"Only one of our local news shows here, in SanFrancisco, has even brought it up. Believe it or not,it's a Fox affiliate(!). They have done three segmentson it in the last 6 months or so."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I am a healthy person. I am a vegetarian. I keep tovirtually exclusively organic foods and products. Idrink only bottled or filtered water/ice. Quite awhile before I ever heard anyone anywhere mentionanythi ng remotely soundi ng l i ke the symptomsassociated with Morgellons, I was seriously doubting my stateof mind because I was having the most bizarreexperience. Intermittently, I was experiencing thesensation of a sharp 'bite' on my skin. When I lookedat the location of the feeling, there was nothingthere...or so I thought. Upon closer inspection, Inoticed a little, black speck at these 'bite' spots.After a while, the specks were replaced with tiny,black or red fibers. Just a single barely noticeablefiber. In fact, I only noticed them because of the'biting' sensation that caused me to investigate it.I don't know if anyone else has this experience withthe fibers...but I put a few of them on a whitesurface - I wanted to see what they were, and I wasshocked to find that they would react to heat! If Iplaced my finger next to them or breathed gentlytoward them, they moved(!)in the direction of the heatsource. If left alone for a while, some seemed to stopreacting, others did not.Anyway, I saw some doctors - they felt it was '...inmy head.' I knew better. Anyway, when I started tohear the news reports, it freaked me out a bit. Iheard it may be associated with Lyme disease. I heardthat the fibers are not living organisms, thank god.Anyway... I refuse to be a victim/sufferer/guinea pig,with this or anything. So I decided that I didn't havethis problem.And, I'm happy to say, I don't suffer from it anymore.I am not saying that it was 'all in my head,' not atall. I feel it may be quite real for those who haveit. I am just fortunate enough to know to my corethat I create my reality and I eradicated thatunwanted problem from myself and my life. (That maysound incredible/not believable but it is whatha p p e ne d / ha pp e ns w he n I s e t my mi nd to s o me thi ng.I wish for health and healing to those suffering, fromthat or any health concern. I especially hope that thesource of it is quickly identified and eradicated. Ithink it may be environmental - chemical exposure ofsome sort. Some people are more sensitive than othersto ma n- ma d e po l l uti on.Thank you for helping get the w ord out. People whosuffer need to know that there are people who believethem.\" 9) 64-Year-Old Registered Nurse\"I am a 64 year old Grandmother, RN, and a suffer of Morgellons. I believe I contracted thisdisease while in Belize for a month 4 years ago.I am a registered member of Morgellons.... I use Frontline for dogs. It helps, but does nottotally rid the buggers. I probably will kill myself with this insecticide but don't know whatelse to do.It can be passed along, something I discovered much to my chagrin. I have never been analarmist but I have just now noticed the Chemtrails in the sky. Someone is definitely sprayingsomething, possibly because \"they\" know that there is this horrible disease threat. That may bewhy CDC is so reticent to help in this matter.\"10) D.S., Texas\"THANK YOU SO MUCH! for the information on Morgellons. I heard the last part of yourinterview Wed night/Th morning with George Noory. ...My niece in San Antonio has beensuffering for about a year with a strange disease which sounds very similar to what youdescribe. I've sent your article to my sister and encouraged her to sign up for the researchfoundation at OK University. One of the 'diagnosis' she received was that she was allergic toher own blood! She has been on various antibiotics and steroid combinations for severalmonths now - with little relief. She is about 35, divorced with four children (two in school andtwo pre-school).\"More Information:Origin of the Name \"Morgellons\" Wikipedia: \"The name Morgellons w as"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"coined in 2002 by Mary Leitao of McMurray, PA, while investigating her son's unexplained rash. She namedthe condition Morgellons (with a hard g), after a condition from the monograph, 'A Letter to a Friend' by SirThomas Browne, in 1690, wherein he describes several medical conditions in his experience, including thatendemial distemper of children in Languedoc, called the morgellons, wherein they critically break out withharsh hairs on their backs. Also, a 1935 paper by British doctor, C.E. Kellett, identifies the name 'Morgellons'with the Provençal term masclous, or 'little flies.' It is doubtful that the 17th century disease has anything to dowith modern day Morgellons; however, the similarities were such that Mary Leitao elected to use the name asa consistent label when addressing politicians, physicians and health departments.\"Website:Morgellons Research Foundation: http://www.morgellons.org/symptoms.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
