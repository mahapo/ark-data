Andrew Kissner Return to Part 1Trouble in the Desert (cont.)Wendover Field and \"GAPA\" ProgramWendover Field was the site of Project Y's TOP SECRET 'KINGMAN' nuclear teststaging area in the isolated desert in western Utah near the Bonneville Salt Flats. The U. S.Army Air Force's first atomic bomb element, the 509th Bomb Group, trained atKINGMAN under code name \"CENTERBOARD.\" That was prior to its relocation toTinian Island for the atomic bomb missions at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This is the same509th Bomb Group based at Roswell, New Mexico, following their return from the PacificTheater of Operations.The 509th Bomb Group worked directly with the AEC's Z Division at Sandia Base inAlbuquerque to field test new atomic weapons designs following WWII. This is the same509th that allegedly transported flying disc debris related to the \"Roswell incident\" fromWalker Field in Roswell, New Mexico, to San Antonio, Texas, for further shipment to theAMC at Wright Field outside Dayton, Ohio. Several key members of this decorated andprestigious Army Air Force group over the past two decades have come forward toconfirm that something very odd happened at Walker Field in Roswell during July 1947. [Sourc e: Sandia National Laboratories, The Postwar Decade © 1990 by Necah S. Furman,Univ. of New Mexico Press, p. 93.]Nuclear weapons flying components were assembled under the direction of Project Ypersonnel in KINGMAN's fabrication shops. The Army Air Forces conducted the tests.Later, the data gathered from the tests was analyzed at LASL. KINGMAN'S LASLscientific and technical personnel evolved into LASL's Z Division. AMC/Wasserfallsurface-to-air missiles were evidently tested and perhaps installed around the AEC test andassembly facilities at KINGMAN."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"In published newspaper accounts of the era related to the \"GAPA program,\" MajorGeneral Nathan Farragut Twining (MJ-4), Commander of the Air Material Command(AMC) at Wright Field, Ohio, is mentioned as providing the functional authority to moveand redeploy the surface-to-air missile system to WSPG. General Twining's assignmentimmediately prior to assuming command of the AMC was Commanding General of the20th Air Force which was the Army Air Forces headquarters unit responsible for the 509thBomb Group during WWII in the Pacific Theater of Operations. General Twining,identified in the Eisenhower MJ-12 document as MJ-4, would become Chief of Staff of theU. S. Air Force in 1953 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1957 to 1960. [Sourc es: The New York Times, June 7, 1947 and April 3, 1954.]The GAPA system reportedly had a range of thirty miles, could achieve a maximum114-mile-altitude and deliver a 674-pound high explosive warhead. When fired at a mobileairborne target, GAPA was expected under some scenarios (not even worst case) to departthe Proving Ground in the direction it was fired. Unless the target was directly north overWSPG property, there was a good possibility that the missile would fall outside theProving Ground \"fence line.\" So, it was necessary to have witnesses on site that wouldverify that the rocket was a V-2 if the mission was to be done secretly. (The U. S. Armydid not want the Russians to know that we had \"secured\" one of \"their drones.\") It wasalso necessary to make-up a V-2 failure story if the missile went off WSPG.No record has been found related to an American GAPA surface-to-air missile programfrom any source other than 1947 newspaper reports. The first operational U. S. surface-to-air missile reported in current litertaure is the Nike Ajax manufactured by WesternElectric, Douglas Aircraft and Aerojet General. This is definitely not the system reportedin New Mexico newspapers in May 1947. Michigan's \"Project Wizard\" SAM effort wasinstalled at Alamogordo Army Air Field, but had not developed a workable prototype atthe time.It is believed that the GAPA program reported by General Twining is a SAM system basedupon the German \"Wasserfall\" design collected with German V-2s in occupied Europe."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Wasserfalls were one-third scale copies of the V-2, with the addition of four controlsurfaces eleven feet rearward from the warhead section. The Wasserfall was aimed andcontrolled using a single \"Rheinland\" targeting system composed of one radar, a direction-finding device, a control transmitter and a comparator-computer. It was a mobile systemthat used a wheeled transport dolly. The Wasserfall propulsion system was substantiallydifferent than the V-2's, even though by appearance they looked similar. The Wasserfallrelied on high pressure nitrogen gas to feed Visol-Salbei propellants into a fuel mixtureregulator. Prior to injection, the Salbei oxidizer (acid) circulated through the chamber'scooling jacket. Chamber pressure was 280 psi. Exhaust velocity was 4,250 mph. [Source:Ordway, International Missile and Space Guide, pp. 96-97.]General Electric's first Hermes missile, A-1, was based on the Wasserfall surface-to-airmissile design. This appears to continue to be a secret of the U. S. military. In 1981, aNASA administrator testified before a Congressional committee and mentioned that theHermes A-1 was based on the German Wasserfall, a surface-to-air missile design. This isthe only reference to this fact in all the published literature I've studied. Why would this besecret?Germany planned to produce 5,000 Wasserfalls per month in 1945. We can assume thatthe AMC had an ample supply of these missiles and their components for study. It alsoappears that the Antiaircraft School at Ft. Bliss possessed operational systems. The firsttest of the GAPA at WSPG was reported to be the 40th launch of the Ground-to-AirPilotless Antiaircraft system (GAPA). But no published literature could be foundconcerning a GAPA system. [ Sources: United States Civilian Space Program 1958-1978,p. 167; The New York Times, June 7, 1947.]Mobile Wasserfall missiles would be tested under partially controlled conditions at WSPG,even if they were fired at a potential enemy target. Construction of launch and testfacilities for several different surface-to-air missile systems at the Proving Ground hadbeen underway since March 1947, six miles east of White Sands National Monument and30 miles northeast of WSPG headquarters along U. S. Highway 70. This deploymentrepresented an acceleration of a previously approved test program. The question: wouldthe mysterious radar target reappear at the time of the next scheduled V-2 launch set forMay 29, a date mentioned by Col. Turner to a local newspaper reporter on May 16? [Sourc es: Ibid.]In July 1947, reportedly as a result of the AMC's mission to develop surface-to-air missilesfor the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Alamogordo Army Air Field was transferred to the AMCfrom the Army Air Force. Within days of the purported discovery of a flying disc nearCorona, New Mexico, Alamogordo AAF became an AMC installation commanded directlyby General Twining (MJ-4) at Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio. [ Source: Hsi and Panitz, FromSundaggers to Space Exploration, p. 308. ] First WSPG Test of Wasserfall Surface-to-Air MissileOn May 22, 1947, it appears that the first modified Wasserfall surface-to-air missile wasfired from White Sands Proving Ground launch row. In the literature concerning the erawritten four decades after the rocket test, the missile was identified as a \"Corporal E,MXX774.\" [ Sources: Ibid.; Devorkin, Science With A Vengeance.] This firing exceededexpectations of program officials according to Lt. Col. Turner. The next two MX774firings, however, were reported to be complete failures. Another source present during thefirst test reported that the first launch was a total failure. It is believed that the missiledetonated in the air during the course of its first WSPG test flight. [ Source: Ibid.]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Las Cruces Sun-News, May 23, 1947, front page.Col. Turner publicly reported on May 23, 1947, that the first test flight of the \"AllAmerican\" rocket - \"the first in a new series of missile\" - had been a success. At the sametime, Col. Turner contradicted his earlier statement and denied that a V-2 launch wasplanned for May 29. Col. Turner insisted that the next V-2 launch would be June 12, 1947.[ Source: Las Cruces Sun-News, May 23, 1947.]Secretly, Army Ordnance and a Ft. Bliss antiaircraft artillery unit began preparing a V-2. Itis believed that a modified Wasserfall antiaircraft missile was placed on its mobiletransport dolly for a May 29, 1947, firing in the vicinity of Launch Complex #33. Securityremained tight at the complex. A Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter, Hanson Baldwin, wasinvited to attend a May 29, 1947, V-2 launch, along with Major General Homer of Ft. Blissand Lt. General Leonard T. Gerow, Commandant of the U. S. Army's Command andGeneral Staff School at Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas.At the time, Hanson Baldwin was the military affairs editor at The New York Times. Inlater years, he was identified as a member of both the NSC 5412/1 Committee and the\"Quantico Study Group.\" He wrote many of The New York Times articles about the V-2program, surface-to-air defense, intelligence collection, psychological warfare and was theprincipal writer to review the National Security Act of 1947 for the NYT. [ Source: Ibid.;The New York Times, May 30, 1947.]Apparently Col. turner felt that there was reason to misinform the local media that a V-2launch would be attempted on May 29, 1947. The SECRET launch was scheduled for11:00 a.m., but was delayed until 4:00 p.m. A V-2 launch was reported to have beenattempted and aborted at 4:00 p.m. that day before the invited guests. Then, the launchwas called off indefinitely at 4:10 p.m. Both Generals returned to their respectivecommands, while reporter Baldwin returned with General Homer to Ft. Bliss 35 milessouth of WSPG. [ Source: Ibid.]At 5:30 p.m. local MST on May 29, 1947, a Navy Helldiver flew over WSPG and crashlanded at Las Cruces Airport, 25 air miles west of WSPG Launch Row. The cause of thecrash was reported as \"a failure of the plane's hydraulic landing gear.\" Within 30 minutesat approximately 6:00 p.m. MST, a second plane commanded by a student pilot overturnedas it attempted to land at the same airport. [ Source: Las Cruces Sun-News, June 1, 1947.]About an hour later at 7:15 p.m. MST, it is believed that at least one Wasserfall surface-"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"to-air missile, complete with a 674-pound high explosive warhead, was fired at one ormore unidentified radar targets hovering to the southwest of WSPG Launch Row. Atapproximately 7:20 p.m. when the warhead was at an altitude above 60,000 feet, theproximity fuse detonated ten miles north and slightly west of Mt. Franklin.
