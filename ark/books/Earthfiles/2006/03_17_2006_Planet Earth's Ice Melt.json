In 2005, that average surface temperature was 58.3 degreesFahrenheit – the hottest year on record ever in modern human history. In fact, the last time the Earth was thiswarm is estimated to be at least ten thousand years ago, or longer. Some scientists think the last time was thePliocene 3 million years ago. By the end of this century, the average global surface temperature is expected to increase perhaps another 3degrees Fahrenheit - and maybe as much as 10 degrees F. - depending on CO2 and methane increases in theatmosphere. That means over the next several decades, the Earth‘s global average temperature could rise threemore times than last century. Some people argue the cause is natural variability of our planet w obbling around the sun and not the humanIndustrial Revolution. However, I have talked with a scientist renowned for his ice core investigations of historic climate changes.He says the hard evidence is that this planet’s wobble distance and polar tilt have been farther from the sunfor a long time, not closer. He also says that in Antarctic ice cores which go back nearly a million years – none of the ice layers show CO2 levels as high as they are now in 2006, which is 381 parts per millionvolume – and climbing. In fact, 2005 saw the largest increase in CO2 on record. I'll begin with the ice melt down all over this planet that is happening faster than anyone expected. The meltdown includes Greenland, Antarctica, mountain glaciers and the Arctic. Tonight I’m focusing on the latestscience reports from Antarctica, Greenland and Mt. Kilimanjaro – ice that’s on land melting into the oceans. I’ll start with the massive ice sheet of Greenland, which covers more than 650,000 square miles. In someplaces, the ice is two miles thick. If it all melted into the ocean, sea levels around the world would rise 23feet. In February, NASA and university scientists reported that Greenland’s southern glaciers are melting twice asfast as they did only ten years ago. In fact, the southern Greenland glaciers are among the world’s fastest -moving at eight miles a year, dumping into the Atlantic Ocean so much water that it is now equivalent to 225times what Los Angeles uses in a year. That ice melt is accelerating so much that it could double again by2015. Global warming computer models have not had this kind of rapid melt down data before in their scenario forGreenland. So, now the sea level rise projection is going up. Prof. Jason Box, Ph.D., at the Byrd Polar Research Center at Ohio State University in Columbus, has beenrepeatedly visiting Greenland over the past decade. Recently he returned from another trip and told me he wassurprised by the current melt in the southern glaciers.Interviews: Greenland Calving front, or break-off point into the ocean, of this Helhiem Glacier located in southeast Greenland.The image, taken in May 2005, shows high calving activity associated with faster glacial flow.This glacier is now one of the fastest moving glaciers in the world.

I have been going there for more than twelve years each year. But what has made these glaciers accelerate beyond any recent observations is the warming that has gone onaround Greenland that is well-documented in temperature records at coastal stations. The melting is occurringfor a longer period of time, so the glaciers are flowing faster, longer. WE KNOW THAT 2005 BROKE ALL RECORDS OF ALL TIME AS BEING THE WARMEST YEAR FORAVERAGE GLOBAL TEMPERATURE. THE PROJECTION FOR THE REST OF THIS CENTURY IS FORINCREASING WARMTH. RIGHT NOW, WHERE DOES THE COMPUTER SHOW THAT THE MELT ONGREENLAND IS GOING TO APPRECIABLY START CAUSING SEA LEVEL RISE? Greenland is already contributing significantly to sea level rise. Our best estimate right now is that Greenlandcontributes about 1/3rd of the global sea level rise. So at the end of this century at 2100, we expect sea levelsto be two to three feet higher than today. How much the sea level rises depends on the warming patterns. Another way to think of this is that more than 100 million people globally live within 3 feet of vertical sealevel. So, millions of people can be affected by sea level rise. A large population that is threatened by sea level rise is in Bangladesh. They don’t really have higher groundin that nation and more than 100 million people live there. WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO GO? WILL GOVERNMENTS BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS CRISIS? Unfortunately, we are already committed to a significant sea level rise. The amount of carbon dioxide has goneup by almost 40% above pre-Industrial levels. That increase in the greenhouse affect will cause warming thathas not yet fully kicked in. Right now, the oceans are absorbing about fifteen times the heat that land is. Theocean total heat content has really gone up dramatically. Very reasonable computer models suggest a point of irreversibility for Greenland exists at a warming between2 and 3 degrees Celsius and we’re already looking at a warming of about 2 degrees C., maybe 3 degrees C.over this century. So, it seems that if this irreversibility point exists, that we’re getting frightfully close to it. Freezing temperature in Fahrenheit is 32 degrees; in Celsius it is 0 degrees.

Yes, at the point of irreversibility, even over the course of a cold year, it’s possible the ice sheet would stillbe losing mass.” Antarctica Ross Sea, Antarctica Ice Melt. Photograph © 1998 byMichael Van Woert, NOAA NESDIS, ORA. Joining Greenland in melt down is Antarctica, especially the West Antarctic ice sheet. It’s not only meltingmore rapidly than expected, its ice shelves are very unstable as the ocean water around them is heating up. Ifall the West Antarctic ice sheet broke up and slid into the ocean, worldwide sea levels would rise twenty feet. So, in some distant future, if all the Greenland and West Antarctic ice melts into the oceans, global sea levelswould rise forty-three feet. Using two NASA satellites, scientists from the University of Colorado have made the first study of total massbalance of the entire Antarctic ice and found it to be “in significant decline.” It’s melting at the rate of 36 cubicmiles a year. One of the project leaders on the Antarctic satellite study is John Wahr, Ph.D., Professor of Physics at the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"University of Colorado and Fellow at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences inBoulder. Antarctic glaciers began moving more rapidly into the ocean in recent years after some ice shelves melted andbroke up. John Wahr, Ph.D., Prof. of Physics and Fellow, Cooperative Institute for Research in EnvironmentalScie nce s (CIRES) , Unive rsit y of Colorado, Boulde r, Colorado: “And as soon as they break up, then theglaciers (behind them) are free to move more rapidly into the ocean. Evidently, that is tied to global warming in the sense that they are floating ice shelves. As they get the wateraround the ice shelves warmer, they come in underneath the ice shelves. There is now warmer waterunderneath the ice. It tends to accelerate the melting and pretty soon the ice shelf is gone. What our resultsshow is that increase is evidently dominating over the increase in snowfall. We found that the total loss of mass in the Antarctic ice sheet between 2002 and 2005 has been enough to raisesea level by .4 millimeters per year.But another way to think of it is: If you covered all the state of California with water, that’s enough waterevery year to reach a depth of 14 inches, a little more than a foot over the entire state. THAT MUCH IS GOING INTO THE OCEAN? Every year, at least for the last 3 years that much went into the ocean. WHICH IS A LOT! I THINK SOMEONE COMPARED IT TO A LAKE TAHOE GOING INTO THEOCEAN EVERY YEAR. That’s exactly what it is. The issue is: will that continue and maybe accelerate?This (new data) seems to show that Antarctica is not in balance probably because of this accelerated glacierflow into the oceans. So, it’s something we’re all going to have to monitor carefully for the next few years tosee if it does accelerate. Where this is probably coming from - in fact, we know it’s coming from - West Antarcticabeneath South America. That’s a very unstable place because the ice there is resting on bedrock that is beneathsea level. IF THAT ENTIRE WEST ANTARCTIC ICE MASS WENT INTO THE OCEAN, BREAKING UP, HOWHIGH WOULD SEA LEVEL RISE? It would rise by about 20 feet. GLOBALLY. Globally, that’s right. But, of course, this is not going to happen over a few years. At the present rate (of melt),it w ould take thousands of years.What we have to worry about is: Is this an indication that things are really starting to happen and shake loosedown there (in West Antarctica)?” Mt.

While there is still a lot of ice left to melt in Antarctica and Greenland, the glaciers on top of Earthmountains – ranging from the Himalayas to South America and Africa – are melting so fast that many areexpected to disappear in the next ten to fifteen years. In fact, the famous, and once glistening white glaciers atop Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Africa, will becompletely gone in less than a decade. Dr. Lonnie Thompson, Distinguished Professor of Geology, and Research Scientist at Ohio State University’sByrd Polar Research Center, has been traveling to mountain glaciers for twenty years to monitor their decline.He is discouraged by the rapid melt of ice that for centuries has provided fresh water for humans and animalsall over this planet. When the mountain glaciers are gone, what will replace that water? What happens tocrops? Climate refugees – both human and animal – will be forced to migrate as this globally warming centuryunfolds. But to where? At what cost? Lonnie Thompson, P h.D., P rof. of Geology and Research Scientist, Byrd Polar Research Center,Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.

(OSU), Columbus, Ohio: “I believe that if youlook at glaciers in the big scheme of things, they are one of our temperature regulators for the planet. Mountainglaciers and big ice sheets, a lot of heat is being taken up in the melting of those ice fields. But as those icefields get smaller, they become less and less effective in taking up that heat. So, we’re losing one of ourbalancing mechanisms we have in our climate system. SO, THE MORE WE MELT, THE FASTER WE MELT? Yes. We just returned from Mt. Kilimanjaro on Feb. 6, 2006, so that we could determine how much ice hadbeen lost over the five years since we did this last time. We were amazed at the changes in the ice during thetime we were on top of the mountain. But also, just in comparing the aerial photos from 2000 to 2006. It’sclear that the glaciers are on track for disappearing and we believe that when we actually do the numbers,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"we’ll be able to show that the rate of loss has actually accelerated. AND IF IT HAS ACCELERATED, WHAT IS THE EARLIEST DATE THAT THERE WILL NO LONGERBE ANY SNOW ON MT. KILLIMANJARO? As far as the timing of when the glaciers will disappear, that’s an interesting question. In 2003, for the firsttime that we have any record of, it was observed along the side of the Furtwangler Glacier a lake actuallybursting out of the side of that ice field. Above: The margin, or edge, of the Furtwangler Glacier atop Kilimanjaro's summit as it looked in 2000.Below: 2006 image shows the retreat of the massive ice field. Rocks in front of tripod were against ice wallin 2000. Since then, the ice wall has shrunk back as much as 5 meters (16.5 feet).P hotos courtesy of Lonnie Thompson, OSU. Since 2000 (to 2005), melting has started to occur. Ice is a threshold system. It’s pretty stable up totemperatures below freezing, but as the temperatures rise above freezing and you get the formation of water,then you change the albedo. There is less energy being reflected from the surface and more radiation beingabsorbed. That puts it in a positive feedback. So, it’s quite possible that the glaciers will disappear muchquicker.[ Editor’s Note: Albedo is the measure of reflectivity of a surface or body. It is the ratio ofelectromagnetic radiation (EM radiation) reflected to the amount incident upon it. This ratiodepends on the frequency of the radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an averageacross the spectrum of visible light. It also depends on the angle of incidence of the radiation.Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 9%. The ocean surface has a low albedo. The averagealbedo of Earth is about 30%, while the albedo of the moon is about 7%. In astronomy, thealbedo of satellites and asteroids can be used to infer surface composition, most notably icecontent Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, has the highest known albedo of any body in the solarsystem, with 99% of EM radiation reflected.Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) ofvarious areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the globalscale: it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease global warming."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The \"classical\" example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback. If a snow coveredarea warms and the snow melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and thetemperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens.Source: Wikipedia]I THINK 2015 IS ONE OF THE PROJECTED YEARS AND THAT’S ONLY NINE YEARS AWAY. Nine years away, yes. As these ice bodies shrink, then there is more and more of the crater floor beingexposed and more solar radiation being absorbed, which drives up the temperature and leads to more ice meltand quicker acceleration of rate of loss. It’s very clear that these ice fields are going to disappear. Then youneed to know what is the impact for these people. BECAUSE IF THERE IS NO SUBSTANTIAL ALTERNATIVE WATER SOURCE TO THE GLACIERS ON TOP OF MT. KILIMANJARO,THOSE PEOPLE ARE FACED WITH HAVING TO MOVE TO SURVIVE? Exactly. This is a real problem. If you look at the current population in Tanzania where Mt. Kilimanjaro is located, it’s about 37 million pe ople . B ut by2050, that is projected to be 67 million! They are suffering from water shortages in today’s climate, so it will be grow ing more c ritic a l a s w e goforward in time. And I would say that in places like Tanzania, where you have the Indian Ocean to the east, desalinization of ocean water might be afactor in supplying fresh water as we go into the future. Most of the models which look at the impacts of global warming show that as the Earth gets warmer, there are places where it will ge t w e tte r a ndthere will be heavier precipitation. But in the central areas of continents where a lot of grains are grown globally, those areas tend to become warmand dry. So, we would expect to see this trend continue as temperatures around the planet continue to rise. WHAT I’M HEARING IS THAT TODAY IN 2006, THE PLANET IS CONSUMED BY THE ISSUE OF TERRORISM. BUT IN ANOTHERTEN, FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS, THE LACK OF WATER AND FOOD WOULD MAKE TERRORISM SEEM LIKE A GNAT ONTHE SURFACE OF THE EARTH. I agree totally with that. In 2003 in Europe, they had a heat wave that kille d ove r 49,000 people. We’ve come off of two years of significantly moreintense hurricanes. The cost, the loss from those hurricanes – both in terms of lives and property – have been tremendous - with Katrina being moreloss in one year than had ever occurred before.One of the questions is: What does it take to wake us up?” One energy alternative is production of methanol from grain crops. Brazil is doing that. But for everypossible solution, other problems multiply. Any country that decides to turn over a lot of crop land togenerating fuel for cars and industry is competing with its own food production. Prof. Thompson also is concerned about China's 1.3 billion people and their need for more food and energy.Changing climate is bringing great drought to parts of that nation and North Korea. There are places in Chinawhere the water table has been dropping a meter a year since the 1980s. Currently, both China and NorthKorea have what is called a “5th Season” beyond winter, spring, summer and fall. It’s the “Dust Season,”which is in the spring. It’s so bad now that people have to wear masks and schools are canceled and peoplecannot go shopping. What happens if the dust bowls keep expanding, threatening water and food supplies? Earth Wobbles and Ice Cores As the Earth is warming up with hard data to prove that warming, there are people who will argue that the“real cause” of global warming is the sun, or a natural variation in the Earth’s orbit around the sun. About the sun’s role, this week I talked with David Hathaway, Ph.D., Solar Physics Group Leader at theNASA Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Even though the last couple of years, the sun hadsome extraordinarily strong X-flares while it’s supposed to be at solar minimum, the past few months the sunhas behaved normally. Sunspot numbers are low as they should be and no substantial increase in solar energyhas been measured in modern times that might explain the current and significant warming of the Earth. Now, what about the Earth’s tilt and wobbling motion as it moves around the sun in an orbit that is notperfectly circular? I got a reality check about this question from Dr. Richard Alley, Prof. of Geosciences atPennsylvania State University in University Park, Pennsylvania. For years he has been studying the Earth’sclimate through ice cores. He has also studied the three orbital cycle variations of our Earth over thousands ofyears which can bring the Northern Hemisphere either closer or further away from the sun."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Image Credit: Thomas G. Andrews , NOAA Paleoclimatology P rogram. Richard Alley, Ph. D., Prof. of Geosciences, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pa: “One(variation) is how round the Earth's orbit is about the sun. It’s elliptical, but it’s more squashed and then lesssquashed. It’s almost round and then highly squashed. It takes about 100,000 years to go from squashed toround to squashed. Second, there is the tip of the North Pole. Does it sort of lean over so that the North Pole can get a sunburn? Ordoes it stand straight up so the North Pole can’t get a sunburn? That varies over about 41,000 years. Third, there is a wobble. Because the orbit is squashed rather than round, do we have Northern Hemispheresummer - which is when the bald spot on top is pointed at the sun – Do we have Northern Hemisphere summerwhen we’re close to the sun? Or when we’re far from the sun? Summer and winter are not close and far. They are the temperature. They are not the distance. So, you go fromhaving Northern Hemisphere summer close to having it far and back over about 19,000 to 23,000 years. It’snot a perfect periodicity. There’s a wobble in it.So, the three of these are all going on together. These are the factors that have paced the ice ages. So, thereason why we go from a world with little ice to a lot of ice and back has been these variations. When thenorthern lands get very little summer sun, then you can grow ice. And w hen the northern lands get a lot ofs umme r s un, the n yo u me l t i c e .At the present time, w e’re sort of at a turning point where we go from having lost the northern sun to gainingthe northern sun. So ri ght now , not a l ot of change i s goi ng on at al l. The l ong-term w oul d be a sl ow i ncreasein northern sun over many thousands of years. The change associated with these wiggles over years ordecades or even centuries is very small. The change over 10,000 to 100, 000 years is fairly large. But over theti me scal es w e humans thi nk of, i t’s not terri bl y big.THAT’S WHY THEN, IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT IF WE HAVE ACCELERATED ICE MELT INGREENLAND AND ANTARCTICA IN JUST THE LAST 5 TO 10 YEARS, THE CAUSE HAS TO BEWHAT WE’RE DOING ON THE EARTH?It’s fairly clear that the changes in Greenland and Antarctica are linked to warming in the regions that arechanging – either warming of w ater under ice shelves is melting them and letting things go faster. Or morewarming on the surface.The temperatures in the polar regions reflect the global signal. Yes, if you change CO2, it effects the poles aswell as the equator. If you say that Nature rolls the dice to see what the weather will be, we are making the diebe loaded. And we’re loading it tow ard warming. And the warming comes up. But it might have come upwarmer by itself.BUT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, WE ARE THE ONES CONTRIBUTING TO THE CO2 BLANKETAROUND THE EARTH?We are the ones contributing to loading the dice to make it warmer, yes."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" Ice Core Research Deepest ice core from Antarctica goes to around 800,000 years ago.None of the ice layers have shown a carbon dioxide level as highas it is now in 2006 at 381 ppmv. Image courtesy NSIDC. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THAT GREENLAND DID NOT HAVE AN ICE CAP?I wish we had an answer to that. The usual answer is there has been ice on Greenland for 3 million years. It isjust possible that it was smaller. There is fairly good evidence it was somewhat shrunken about 120,000 to130,000 years ago. It’s conceivable that it was shrunken even more than that. But the usual answer is about 3million years.WHAT ABOUT ANTARCTICA?The longest record so far in Antarctica – they probably pushed it past 800,000 years. It’s very recentlyrecovered. There are still analyses going on. So, the greenhouse gas record has only been published out toabout two-thirds of a million years. But it’s headed toward 1 million years, but not there yet.IN THE MILLION YEARS, IT HAS ALWAYS HAD ICE?Yes.IN THE TWO-THIRDS OF A MILLION YEARS THAT YOU’VE BEEN ABLE TO LOOK AT CO2LEVELS IN THE ANTARCTIC ICE, HAS ANYTHING EVER REACHED THE LEVELS WE HAVE NOWIN OUR ATMOSPHERE?No. The levels now are a bit above what Nature was doing over that interval.SO FOR A MILLION YEARS, WE HAVEN’T HAD THIS MUCH CO2 AROUND THE EARTH?Over that time, humans have pushed CO2 out of the band of natural variability, yes.IT’S SUPPOSED TO DOUBLE THIS CENTURY.Yes.WE ARE REALLY IN UNCHARTED TERRITORY THEN?Certainly for the times that we humans have been here and modern and knowing what’s going on, we arechanging things past w hat we’ve experienced, yes.GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOU HAVEN’T BEEN ABLE TO DO ICE CORES PAST TWO-THIRDS OF AMILLION YEARS, IS THERE ANY ESTIMATE ABOUT WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THATANTARCTICA DID NOT HAVE ANY ICE ON THE LAND?If you go back before the Oligocene, back to the Eocene, into the Cretaceous, the time of the dinosaurs in theCretaceous, there probably was either no ice or very little ice on Antarctica.SO YOU HAVE TO GO BACK AT LEAST 65 MILLION YEARS?Actually probably only about 35 million to 30 million, something like that.IF AT THE TIME OF THE DINOSAURS, THERE WAS NO ICE ON ANTARCTICA AND IT’S NOW TWOTO THREE MILES THICK IN SOME SECTIONS?Yes."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"WHAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED THAT MUCH ICE BUILD UP SUDDENLY ON LAND THAT HAD NOICE 65 MILLION YEARS AGO?Yes, the best explanation actually is natural changes in carbon dioxide. Continental drift, opening uppassageways between continents might have contributed as well.

As a consequence, it was very warm.AND WE’RE HEADED IN THAT DIRECTION AGAIN NOW.Headed in that direction again, yes. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME IN YOUR ICE CORE WORK THAT YOU HAVE FOUND THIS MUCHCO2?No one has yet gotten an ice core long enough to find CO2 levels this high. So, the ice core record now goesback almost two-thirds of a million years and the record does not record anything as high as what we havenow .SO WHEN WE GO TO THE LAST INTER-GLACIAL PERIOD, WHICH WAS HOW LONG AGO?About 125,000 to 130,000 years ago was the previous interglacial.WHAT WAS THE CO2 LEVEL THEN?I think it was around 280 – maybe up toward 300, but not as high as today (which is 381 ppmv).FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AS A SCIENTIST STUDYING ICE CORES AND YOU LOOK AT THESENUMBERS AND WHERE WE ARE NOW, WHAT IS YOUR REACTION?I think humans are changing the atmosphere in a way that is changing the climate.IS IT DANGEROUS?(laughs) The question of danger really depends on what you are worried about and who you are worriedabout. There have been a variety of attempts to assess how dangerous is dangerous? If you live very close tosea level in a place where you don’t have a lot of bulldozers and a lot of money to build seawalls, there isn’tmuch you can do. As it gets warmer and sea level rises, this is clearly not a good thing for you. So there aresome people for which even small changes can be dangerous to.There are other people for which you would have to talk about a much larger change before you would call itdangerous. There is some evidence that would point to a little bit of warming as being helpful to our economy.When a big blizzard closes down the East Coast airports, it’s expensive. But it depends on how you are counting and who you are. It might actually help the northern economies a littlebit to have some warming. But too much warming would become a bad thing.IN FACT, THE ESTIMATE IS THAT 100 MILLION PEOPLE TODAY LIVE WITHIN 3 FEET VERTICALRISE FROM SEA LEVEL. AND IF THE PROJECTED SEA LEVEL RISE OVER THE NEXT DECADES ISTHREE FEET APPROXIMATELY, THEN IT MEANS WE ARE GOING TO BE FACED LITERALLYMIGRATIONS AWAY FROM THE COASTLINES.That would seem to be a reasonable presumption. If that many people are living there and the sea level comesup, they are going to have to do something.\"More Information: For more information about global warming and glacier melts, please see the following reports in Earthfiles Archives: • 02/20/2006 -- Mysterious Deaths of Whales in Mexico• 11/18/2005 -- Is the Sun Heating Up?• 10/07/2005 -- Warmer Sea Surfaces and Increased Winds Make Hurricanes Stronger• 09/29/2005 -- 2005 Arctic Summer Ice Melt - Largest On Record• 09/23/2005 -- Phenomenon of \"Instant\" Hurricanes in 2005• 08/05/2005 -- Scientists Puzzled by \"Bizarre\" Pacific Coast Die-offs in 2005• 05/11/2005 -- Greenland Sea Cold Water Re-Cycling Has Nearly Stopped.
