June 28, 2006 Destin, Florida - Exactly five years ago in June 2001, cat mutilations were reported inNavarre, Florida, and Austin, Texas. At Earthfiles, I showed the Daily News article below of the Navarrecouple holding their white surviving cat. Their black male was found cut in half, without blood. Since the1970s, there have been repeated waves of cat mutilations in Canada, the United Kingdom and United States.Pattie and John Goodfleisch hold their surviving white female cat, Kitty, after they foundtheir other black male cat, Maximum, cut in half on Saturday, June 30, 2001.P hotograph © 2001 by Daily News, Milton, Florida.Navarre is southwest of Eglin AFB in the Florida panhandle.At the same time in northwestern Austin, Texas, law enforcement were investigating a dozen incidents ofmutilated cats since March 2001, in which the head, neck and front legs of domestic cats had been severedbloodlessly through the spine by a sharp instrument. Most of the internal organs, rib cage and spine wereremoved in the mutilated cats and some were cut in half bloodlessly right behind the two front legs."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Now in the spring of May 2006 in Destin, Florida, only a few miles east of Navarre, another round of half catmutilations have been reported since early April, especially along Holly Street. Tony Tenore found his cat cutin half on his front yard lawn. Half a dozen other neighbors have found mutilated cats in their yards. And at theend of May, Henry Boenning, who lives only a couple of doors from Tony Tenore, found his 16-year-old catgutted without blood.Interview:Henry Boenning, Hotel Restaurant Manager, Destin, Florida: “I have been living in Destin, Florida, forsix months and I was told by my neighbor maybe two months ago to be careful with my dogs and cats becausesomething was cutting them up. The neighbor to her left - apparently someone threw a cat over their fence andit was severed in half. And it was a cat that neighbor did not even own.Then across the street, their cat was gutted and cut in half and left on their lawn. And then my cat, Spot, whowas 16-years-old. She doesn’t usually go out, but I let her out this one night and she did not return. I found herthe next morning, basically gutted. There was no blood. She was on my front lawn. All the internal organswere gone, except a few things. Her hind legs were gone and her front legs were skinned. There she was w ithher collar and tags. She lived a good life, but that’s a helluva way to go! I just think it’s some sicko. It’s not acult, I don’t think, or they would not have returned it.WAS THERE ANY BLOOD AT THE SCENE AT ALL?No, no. Whoever it was, picked up my cat and did their thing and returned it.WAS THERE EVER ANY BLOOD ON ANY OF THE OTHER CATS?No.HAVE YOU INQUIRED WITH ANY LOCAL VETERINARIANS ABOUT WHAT THEIR PERSPECTIVEIS?I’m the only one who did an autopsy. That’s how I found out it was intentional. She said it was not a coyote orany animal. It was definitely intentional.MEANING THEY WERE DEFINITELY SURGICAL CUTS?I wouldn’t exactly say you are a surgeon when you’re going to cut a cat up.WERE THE CUTS CONFIRMED BY THE VETERINARIAN TO HAVE BEEN CUT WITH A SHARPINSTRUMENT?I don’t know. I called the police. The police took it to the vet and I had an autopsy done and the vet said ‘itwas intentional.’ Not predators like coyotes or foxes, which the police keep saying it is.ANY OTHER REPORTS IN DESTIN?I have researched it and these are occasional occurrences.\" Rochester, New York"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Rochester is in far western New York state on Lake Ontario.The June 28, 2006, issue of the Rochester Democrart and Chronicle.com reports, \"Several recent animalbeheadings in Rochester might be linked to a religious ritual, Humane Society officials believe.

The goat's frontlegs, head and intestines had been removed.\"Before then over the weekend, a white goat and five chickens were found with their heads cut off on railroadtracks.
