It made no sound, was silvery in color, traveling at terrific speed....It was definitely being maneuvered by intelligent beings.\" - Radio broadcast by Frank Edwards, June 30, 1954Return to Part 1November 29, 2006 Albuquerque, New Mexico -An official publication of Civilian Research, InterplanetaryFlying Objects (CRIFO) © 1957 by Leonard H. Stringfield.5 - THE NEWSWIRES SHOW THEIR HAND - AND SCISSORS!Even more inexplicable than the newspapers' method of handling saucers wasthat of the news services. When Frank Edwards first alerted his listeners in thelatter part of 1953 that saucer reports were being smothered at their source,speculation for its cause was quick to follow. Rumor was that something bighad happened behind scenes in the military. One story making the roundsclaimed that the Air Force was hiding three saucers and their crews in hangarsat Edwards AFB, Muroc, California. While I could not substantiate this claimor its connection with the newswire action, I was made aware through officialcorrespondence of a sudden and important change in the Air Force's policy of"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"disseminating UFO information.A letter from Major Robert C. Brown of the Air Technical Intelligence Center(ATIC), Wright-Patterson AFB, dated August 21, 1953, said: \"The AirTechnical Intelligence Center has received your letter dated 5 August 1953,requesting an interview with Project Blue Book personnel. These personnelare quite busy at the present and request you obtain your information from theDepartment of Defense, Office of Public Information, Washington 25, D. C. If,however, they cannot supply you with the information that you desire, there isa possibility that an interview can be arranged.\"Then on December 2, 1953, Captain R. C. White of OPI, Department ofDefense, Washington, answered a list of 82 questions I had submitted to hisoffice, concerning official views on the UFO. In his postscript to the 82answers Captain White said, \"I'm sorry to have to refer you again to ATIC ondetailed sightings because of their workload. However, if you will limit yourquestions to one or two sightings at a time, they may be able to help you. Ifnot, send them to me, one or two at a time, and I'll try to run them down.\"Then came the switch! On December 17, 1953, Chief Warrant Officer, R. C.Schum of ATIC, answered my follow-up letter concerning my original proposalfor an interview as follows: \"In reference to your letter of 8 December 1953,the Air Technical Intelligence Center has been directed to make all informationon Project Blue Book available to the Department of Defense, Office of PublicInformation, Washington, D. C., for release from that point only. Completeinformation is furnished the Office of Public Information on a day-to-day basisas well as by summary reports. Therefore, an interview with that office mightbe of benefit to you. In regard to your specific questions, the Air TechnicalIntelligence Center will request a copy from the Office of Public Informationand attempt to answer them more fully. These will then be returned to youthrough the Office of Public Information.\"One of the first reports to steer my suspicions, involving both the military andthe newswires, slipped by the \"censors\" on June 30, 1954, from Mobile,Alabama. I first heard of it from Frank Edwards who phoned me fromWashington prior to his broadcast. He read the high points from his script -\"Brookley AFB officials report radar had tracked a UFO ... It made no sound,was silvery in color, traveling at terrific speed. ...It was definitely beingmaneuvered by intelligent beings.\"[ Editor's Note: Originally named Brookley Field, the airport waspreviously a U.S. Army Air Force supply base, employing around17,000 civilians. In the late 1960s, the airport was turned over tothe City of Mobile, Alabama, and re-named Mobile DowntownAirport, which is now operated by the Mobile Airport Authority.]I remember Frank stressing one phrase, intelligent beings. I thought the reportwas unusual, so I followed it up. It was a United Press item, so I checked withthe City Desk at the Cincinnati Post. \"No such story on our wires,\" said theman on the desk. When I asked if he would put a tracer on it, he promised hewould and told me to call back the next morning. When I checked, I was toldthat the story was denied in Mobile.Later, I learned of JANAP 146 (Joint Army-Navy-Air publication) reprinted inMarine Major Donald Keyhoe's 1955 book, The Flying Saucer Conspiracy."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Reprinted in Appendix 1, on pages 301-303, The Flying Saucer Conspiracy© 1955 by Major Donald E. Keyhoe, U. S. Marine Corps, Retired.Then I felt even more certain that controls in some mysterious manner hadbeen leveled on the news media. Another example of suspected finaglingbehind the scenes involved a local incident in which a sensational UFO stirredthousands of Cincinnatians on August 5, 1955."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"A Times Star headline said, \"Aerial Whazit Intrigues City,\" but that was theextent of the United States population that the story intrigued - it never madethe newswires! For the account and my editorial comment, I quote from theSeptember 2, 1955, issue of Orbit:\"At 8:40 p.m., a large brilliant tear-drop-shaped object, flyingsouth to north, crossed the city's skies. It moved swiftly andsoundlessly in a straight horizontal path without visual arc.Witnessed by thousands, including this writer whose view wasexcellent, the object appeared as large as a dime held at arm'slength.\"A notable feature was the sharply etched roundness of thedevice, which gleamed in a uniform brilliant white luminescence.Tapering abruptly behind this white mass was a short fiery tail ofbluish-green - much like the tonguing flame of a rocket. Its speed,although constant, was too fast for any known aircraft, yet tooslow for a normal meteor.\"During the next few days I interviewed over fifty otherwitnesses. Most all confirmed the description which I had phonedto the Columbus Air Filter Center and the newspapers. Somedescribed the object as 'cone-shaped,' like a 'pear' or, as mydaughter, Colette, told me, 'a light bulb with a little blue tail.'Reports poured in from every section of the city, mostly in theeastern half or from high ground in the west. One report fromCold Springs, Kentucky, claimed that the object was exceedinglylow and appeared to have 'windows.'From Columbus came reports that residents there also saw a ballof fire streaking over the city. It was described as a bright yellowcolored light with a red and green fringe or halation. The object"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"silently disappeared in a cloud bank about 5,000 feet high. OverLancaster, about 30 miles southeast of Columbus, a similar objectwas reported by many residents. C. M. Smith of that city writes:'...my family and I were sitting out on our terrace when we saw agiant fireball traveling very rapidly from south to north. Itappeared as a pear-shaped object glowing white with a red andorange fiery tail.'\"Several reports from northwestern Cincinnati described theobject as suddenly and silently exploding just north of the city.One witness said he thought he saw it hit the earth and burst intovertical streamers like a bomb. Curiously, the object was not seenin adjacent areas northeast of the city, which gives rise to thetheory that two objects were seen over Cincinnati almost at thesame time.Lending weight to this theory is the fact that the majority ofwitnesses represented two extreme ends of the city and from twoextreme ends of Kentucky from which the objects were seen tooriginate. By this deduction, we can, therefore, account for theone object exploding in northwestern Cincinnati. The other,perhaps, changed course and flew ENE toward Lancaster wherethe description of the object tallies with the object witnessed bymyself. If the later case were not true, as we have earliersuggested on the assumption that no one reported a UFO in theoutlying areas of northeastern Cincinnati, then we may believethat three and possibly four separate objects had traversed theskies over Ohio.\"Whatever the explanation for the newswires being silent on the Mobile,Alabama, and Cincinnati, Ohio, incidents, the man-on-the-street was notgetting the best facts available. For instance, during the deluge of sightingsreported almost daily in the greater Cincinnati area in 1954, most all wereconsidered un-newsworthy. \"The public is tired of saucers,\" opined aCincinnati Enquirer columnist. However, his paper gave respectful emphasisto an Air Force statement carried by the wire services on June 1, 1954, whichsaid that saucer reports had fallen off sharply since 1952.The Air Force statement went on to say that from January 1 to June 1, 1954,only eighty-seven sightings had been reported. Captain White of OPIconfessed that saucer mail was just trickling in - about five a day, he said, andyawned, 'Ho hum!'Hardly in a yawning mood, I could not believe White's statistics. Was itpossible that CRIFO's mail was five times as great as the Air Force's?Certainly \"87 reports since January 1954\" was debatable. I alone had receivedover a hundred reports since January and Frank Edwards told me on the phonethat he received almost that many a month. Curious, I phoned Lt. ColonelO'Mara, Deputy Commander of Intelligence, Wright-Patterson AFB. Duringthis \"interview\" of July 8, 1954, I was told the Air Force was receiving about\"700 sighting reports\" a week. The figure 700 probably covered all reportsreaching ATIC for evaluation, including civilian reports. A great percentage ofthis number undoubtedly had conventional explanations as had many of thereports I received during that same period.I asked Lt. Col. O'Mara about the \"87\" number. Colonel O'Mara said thatnumber represented the cases under \"special analysis.\"Inasmuch as Colonel O'Mara had scuttled the Air Force statement, his newfigures on \"sighting\" frequency meant little to Cincinnati newspapers. Only theTimes Star gave it coverage. The newswires would not touch it! However,"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"when I phoned the news to Frank Edwards at Mutual in Washington, D. C., theairwaves that night carried the information coast to coast - and deep inside thePentagon.\"Continued in Part 4 - Manipulated MediaMore Information:For further information about Leonard Stringfield's UFO Status Reports, please see reprintsbelow from the Earthfiles Archives:Status Reports I• 10/25/2005 -- Final Part 6: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 10/13/2005 -- Part 5: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 10/05/2005 -- Part 4: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 09/30/2005 -- Part 3: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 09/26/2005 -- Part 2: Retrievals of the Third Kind - Kingman, Arizona Crash• 09/25/2005 -- Part 1: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary CustodyStatus Reports II• 09/19/2005 -- Final Part 9: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/17/2005 -- Part 8: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/14/2005 -- Part 7: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/06/2005 -- Part 6: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 08/22/2005 -- Part 5: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 08/17/2005 -- Part 4: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/20/2005 -- Part 3: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/14/2005 -- Part 2: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/12/2005 -- Part 1: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New DataStatus Reports III• 07/05/2005 -- Final Part 15: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 06/20/2005 -- Part 14: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 06/17/2005 -- Part 13: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 05/10/2005 -- Part 12: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 05/04/2005 -- Part 11: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 04/19/2005 -- Part 10: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence © June 1982 byLeonard H.
