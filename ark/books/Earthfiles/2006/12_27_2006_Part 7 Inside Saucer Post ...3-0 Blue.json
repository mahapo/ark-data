Stringfield.THE WITCH HUNT FOR EVIDENCEI gave never seen a down-to-earth spaceship. I have never been to Mars and back.Therefore, I cannot say that flying saucers are spaceships from Mars. Yet, without seeingor feeling these \"irrefutable proofs,\" I believe that an unknown percentage of the UFOs onofficial and CRIFO file are actually interplanetary vehicles - maybe from Mars.It's a matter of interpretation, I suppose. Seems easy when you have an archive of\"evidence,\" like CRIFO's, at your fingertips. This, plus a studious knack at ratiocination -the patience to put the myriad loose ends into a pattern - can usually make the \"saucersfrom Mars\" image look excitingly clear. That is, for some people. Perhaps it wasratiocination that changed the mind of Henry J. Taylor about saucers.In 1949, Taylor, then radio commentator, said he was sure saucers were secret U.S.weapons. But on May 4, 1957, it was announced that Taylor, newly appointed ambassadorto Switzerland, had told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that at least 10% offlying saucer reports are \"very disturbing.\" He said the average 10th case has to be takenseriously because it \"had been seen by too many sober-minded people, with photographicand other evidence.\" Added Taylor, \"...It is very difficult to deny that something ishappening around us that we just don't quite understand. ...I just don't think that we knowall the secrets of the universe yet.\"But others, perhaps less informed or less ratiocinative than Taylor, wanted their evidence"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"in the form of hardware. Through the years, I have collected more than my share of it. Ithas come to me in assorted sizes, shapes, weights, colors - and odors! Some of it soprecious that I was allowed only to fondle. Others of it so secret I knew of only throughwhispers. I am told that the Air Force has tons of hardware all fenced in under tarp andguarded at Wright-Patterson. At least two sources told me they saw it being hauled thereunder tarp and being escorted by military police in 1953. Another well-informed source in1955 went further, claiming he saw a saucer at Wright-Patterson. It was made ofsomething like plexiglas, he said, only sturdier. When I tried for more details at a laterdate, my informant was in New York. At least a half dozen more attempts always foundhim out of town.Then there was the Maury Island affair of June 21, 1947, known to all saucerites. It, too,had its mysterious metals and slag. John Otto, a private researcher, showed me a prizedspecimen of the slag when I visited Chicago in 1954. He got it from Ray Palmer, whowhile Editor of Fate magazine, received it from Harold Dahl and Fred Crisman. Those twomen, according to their testimonies, were involved in a weird sea-going escapade. This,however, was later \"exposed\" as a hoax with Dahl and Crisman since having vanishedfrom the scene of saucers. Then there is the story and the mystery about the smallradioactive lead disc found in Colorado with a curious inscription that read \"undark,\"which baffled both Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and FBI.[ Editor's Note: Fred Crisman (July 22, 1920 - December 10, 1975) wasallegedly a federal agent who operated under many guises as writer, educator,minor political provocateur, broadcaster and self-described \"disruption agent\"from Tacoma, Washington.Wikipedia: \"In the mid-1940s, his name appears in the pages of pulpmagazines, reporting on his own Shaver Mystery experiences via letters to theeditor, warning of the threat from subterranean-dwelling 'Deros,' or'detrimental robots.' He claimed to have encountered the beings while fightingas a commando in Burma during World War II, and wrote that he sustainedinjuries from a futuristic laser weapon.\"His name next pops up as a key player in the strange Maury Island Incident,an early UFO encounter. Crisman claimed to have seen the objects inquestion, and to have collected debris.\"He next turns up in Tacoma in the late 1960s, railing against the city's citymanager form of government. He hosted a conspiracy-themed radio talk showunder the pseudonym 'Jon Gold,' and wrote a self-published book, TheMurder of a City, Tacoma. He was also appointed by the mayor to serve onthe Tacoma Public Library board.\"During this time period, he was subpoenaed by Jim Garrison to testify in thecase against Clay Shaw in the John F. Kennedy assassination. When Shawwas arrested, apparently Crisman was the first person he called. Variousconspiracy theories place Crisman on the grassy knoll, possibly as a radiooperator, or as one of the three tramps taken in to custody near Dealey Plaza.His Grand Jury testimony is now public, and in Murder of a City, Tacoma,Crisman claimed no knowledge of a conspiracy, and he was not called as awitness in the actual trial. Documents that indicate a Crisman link to theKennedy assassination may have been fabricated by Crisman himself, as theyare written in an idiosyncratic style reminiscent of Crisman's own.\"Crisman died in 1975, but his name continues to resonate in the shady worldof conspiracy theories. Michael Riconosciuto was a key player in the Inslawflap of the 1980s and 1990s, which may have led to the untimely death - somewould say murder - of journalist, Danny Casolaro, who was working on abook entitled The Octopus. Riconosciuto was a young electronics whiz fromTacoma who was a close acquaintance of Crisman's, and who helped Crismansweep for (and possibly plant) electronic eavesdropping devices during theyears he was writing Murder.]And there is the incident involving a lady saucerite. A firm believer in contact stories, sheclaimed in all seriousness to have had her own contact with a spaceman - on more intimategrounds. However, nine months have since passed and I've heard nothing yet about thebouncing evidence.But being reminded of the contact element and their \"slight-of-handling\" the evidence, Ialways think of Truman Bethurum. In the summer of 1954, Ric Williamson and otherSoulcrafters gathered suddenly at my home, mainly to discuss business for their proposedlecture in Cincinnati. During the discussion about who would do what, I managed to slip ina word to Bethurum on a point which had bothered me since I read his book, Aboard A"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Flying Saucer © 1954. It concerned the paper on which Aura Rhanes, the \"Scow's\"captain, had graciously written a message for Bethurum. Thinking of evidence, I asked himif he had thought of having the paper analyzed chemically. But Bethurum evaded thequestion and rejoined the clamor about lecture ticket sales. When I tried again later, asympathetic Soulcrafter intervened. He explained that an analysis of the paper wouldprove nothing, since paper manufacturers on Clarion used pulp from trees just like thoseon earth!And the poor mailman! If he only knew what he was sometimes carrying inside a packageto my door. A piece of flint, a chunk of quartz, Christmas tree tinsel, and the funniest of all- three pink-colored, but well solidified, dog droppings. Said a note enclosed from thefemale sender: \"I found these in my garden the next morning.\" She described the saucerflying over her house the night before. While I can figure out the droppings, I'll neverknow how they got pink. A joke maybe?!Another mystery item was a chunk of metal of crystalline structure that weighted aboutnine pounds. Shaped like a teardrop, it showed external evidence of having been exposedto great temperatures. The metal was found by Mrs. Ila Arthur in an abandoned gravelquarry near Lafayette, Indiana - at a site remote from industry. While the lone piece ofmetal could not be traced to a UFO, or to any past UFO activity in the area, Mrs. Arthurwas of the opinion that it came from the sky. Not overlooking the extraterrestrial answer,she gave her trophy to her son-in-law, Frank Gallagher. He broke it up for examinationand sent me several sizeable fragments. I took a specimen to the University of Cincinnati.But although geologists and metallurgists there were able to describe its elementsspectroscopically, they could offer no solution as to its identity or source.Ruled out, however, was a meteorite. Ruled in was industrial slag. I later submittedsamples to ATIC, Wright-Patterson AFB. After their analysis, they replied in part:\"A thorough, critical analysis naturally required a certain amount of smalldestruction of the metal fragment. ...All material submitted is 'man-made' or'man-fabricated.' Samples were found to be ferro-chromium and magnetic andnot radioactive. The composition obtained for those samples was:Chromium, 67 - 71%Silicon, 0.1 - 1.0%Ni, Co & Mn, 0.2%Mg, Ca & Al, 0.5%Iron, Balance\"The crystalline structure and non-oxidized condition of these samples pointsdirectly to the fact that a high temperature such as would be encountered byone of meteoric origin has not been imposed. Both the common appearanceand the analysis of these strongly suggest that they have come from the bin ofeither a steel mill or steel foundry where chromium in this form is customarilyadded to steel melts.\"Although this analysis might be correct, the official opinion as to origin of the object mightbe nothing more than presumption. Other consultants, who considered all the anomalies ofthe case, could not offer so pat an explanation.More confounding to the experts were specimens of \"hot rock,\" collected by NorbertGariety, which looked much like the Maury Island specimen. It was dull black, minutelycrystalline, obdurate. Gariety, now editor of S. P. A. C. E., was on vacation and had thegood fortune to stop over in Erie, Pennsylvania, where he chanced to read an item in theAugust 12, 1956 Dispatch, which described the experience of George Traut. The item toldhow Traut and his companion, Bud Buzar, driving on a lonely road at 12:45 a.m., Saturday,had been forced to halt by a huge rock, which, with a smaller one, obstructed their path.Traut said, \"They were too hot to handle with bare hands, so I pushed them off thehighway into the berm.\" Saturday morning, Traut returned to the road site with a truck andtook the rocks home.Commented Gariety in S.P.A.C.E., \"I called the Traut residence and made an appointment....I found the Trauts cooperative ... filling me in on details not carried in the newspaper. Imade photos of the find and carried away several small pieces.\"Before returning to Florida, Gariety visited the Stringfields and left one of the specimenswith me. I made arrangements through an intermediary to have it examined at theUniversity of Cincinnati. Interest was high. But unexplainably, it was months before therock was returned to me, minus analysis. Said the intermediary, \"Probably slag.\"According to Gariety, another piece of the rock was sent later to M. K. Jessup, author offour UFO books. Jessup promised to send a sample to the Smithsonian Institute, butnothing more was heard. Gariety also gave a sample to Dr. Virgil Sleight, geologist at theUniversity of Miami."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Sleight concluded that the specimen:1) contained no nickel, probably not meteorite;2) did not look like any rock that he had ever seen;3) suggested slag - yet was more coarsely crystalline and heavier than mostslag.Gariety then approached Dr. Raymond Parks, radiologist of Jackson Memorial Hospital.Said Parks, \"We have no physical measurement other than those for radiation. ...Therefore,we have no information whatsoever, except to state that it dose not emit gamma, beta orenergetic alpha particles.\"Next to examine the rock was Dr. Russell Williams, astronomer. He said, \"Whatever it is,it's not part of a meteorite - and I certainly do not think it could be furnace slag.\" Finally,specimens went off to the A. & G. Refining Co. of Miami, Florida. There, twometallurgists said the rocks were composed of \"chromium, Tungsten, vanadium, iron,copper and molybdenum.\"To those who insist that the rock was slag, Gariety reports, \"Please I pray thee do tell -what in the world would anyone be doing out hauling red hot furnace slag at 12:45 a.m.Saturday night?\" There is one other possible answer. Remembering that 130 miles is but ashort hop for a saucer, we note that an object described as \"a bright steel-gray ship,\" wasreported by the Pittsburgh Sun Telegraph as hovering over the city for more than twohours later that same Saturday morning when Traut had found the \"slag.\" THE 'SOFTWARE' DEPARTMENTIn the \"software\" department is \"angel hair.\" Purportedly a saucer by-product, it isvariously described as looking like cobweb or spun glass fluff. Curiously, it seems to havea predilection for falling to earth during the month of October. The unofficial recordspeaks for itself, compiled by Fantastic Universe magazine and its contributors such asIvan Sanderson, naturalist.Date of UFO \"Angel Hair\" Incidents // Locality // UFO in AreaOctober 14, 1797 // Osaka, Japan // UnknownNovember 10, 1949 // Depues Ferry, Pa. // YesOctober 1950 // Paradise, California // UnknownOctober 17, 1952 // Oloron and Geronce, France // YesOctober 27, 1952 // Gaillac, France // Yes1953 // Onga Onga, New Zealand // Unknown1953 // Gisborn, New Zealand // YesApril 15, 1953 // Auckland, New Zealand // UnknownMay 30, 1953 // Pelmerston North, Christchurch, N.

The report said that an Air Force freighter, No.5911, gathered a \"strange sticky substance\" on its windscreens and front fuselage during anight flight over Kaitaia on February 26, 1955. During the flight at 6,000 feet, the crewheard \"dull thuds\" on the aircraft just before the appearance of this substance on thescreen. Simultaneously, the aircraft compass \"went wrong\" and the crew was forced toreturn to base at Whenuapai early.The substance did not disintegrate on touch and whenrubbed, it \"smeared like grease.\"More rare, however, is the UFO incident which involves two types of software. Thefollowing describes both angel hair and a plastic-like ribbon, the latter found clinging to theparked automobile of Mr. and Mrs. L. L. Leonard of Cherry Valley, Illinois, on September30, 1956. By letter, in which a sample of the ribbon was enclosed, Mrs. Leonard related:\"...Looking overhead and slightly East, I thought I saw a jet. But it was going so fast that Ichanged my mind when I saw a few more of the same white objects. My husband got thebinoculars, 7 x 50, and through them the objects appeared white and half the size of a peaat arm's length. The objects traveling very fast suddenly ejected long white streamers,which floated in the air, hanging absolutely perpendicular. One of these round, white'things' came just a little lower than our treetops and I ran after it, trying to see where itlanded. But I lost it. On one of our evergreens there was something the looked like spiderwebs, but on picking off a strand and handling it, I thought it had the consistency of spunglass. As we were watching these white 'things' explode, we looked up at a section of thesouthwestern sky and there was a concentration of these silver streamers, which lookedlike stationary silver rain. It was a most eerie sight.\"A similar description of a substance falling from the sky over Campinas, Brazil, inDecember 1954, was described in the July - August 1957 issue of UFO - Critical Bulletin,published by J. Escabar Faria of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Faria wrote:\"...Three UFOs crossed the skies of Campinas. They dropped waste material,which was seized by the Brazilian Air Force. But before the FAB Intelligencecollected the stuff, a sample was analyzed by Dr. Visvaldo Maffel, aprofessional chemist, who stated to newspapers that the material had shown astrange alloy. Dr. Maffei assured that the chemical examination resulted in analloy of tin together with it and other unknown metals. The composition was ahigh amount of tin in great pureness (88.91%), \"unusual on this planetbecause the tin had not the common impurity in presence of leads, antimony,iron and other ores.\"Faria then describes the reported UFOs: \"...Such odd contrivances were roundof gray color and exhibited two parts. One of them turning around incessantly.At the moment in which they crossed the city at moderate speed, theydropped the stuff in a liquid form on the garden of a lady. A neighbor,Benedito Gonzales de Nascimento, said it looked like 'silver rain.' Thefilaments, when touching the ground, transformed rapidly in solid silver-colored rectangles intensely heated.' The substance subsequently was sent toProf. Charles Maney, physicist at Defiance College in Ohio. Extensive testswere made and when I phoned Prof. Maney in July of 1957 regarding hisanalysis, I learned that he and Prof. Nathan Meltz, a chemist, had confirmedthe earlier Brazilian tests.\"Mrs. L. L. Leonard continued her description: \"We didn't see the phenomena without theglasses. These silver streamers must have been of an enormous length. My car was parkedin the garage with the double door opened all the while. When I took it out the nextmorning, a long piece of 'something' was plastered on the fender. ...It seems that therewere two kinds of the streamers: some were like spider webs and others were the ribbontype.\"The 'life' of angel hair on earth is almost ephemeral. According to numerous reports, itdematerializes of its own accord, and more quickly at the touch of human hand. Gettingsamples is therefore not easy, even when it falls close to some, as it did on October 10,1955, over western Cincinnati and parts of northern Kentucky. During this incident, thefluff came down in sheets and streamers, draping over housetops, trees, bushes andautomobiles. To the wrath of one lady, some fell over her freshly hung laundry - but notone authentic sample was obtainable! No UFOs were reported during this daylight fall. Butthe night before, Harlan Grimes had seen a bright disc over Bromley, Kentucky, goingnorth toward western Cincinnati. About the same time, another observer reported alow-flying red, luminous ball zoom up through a wooded ravine near Hooven, north of"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Bromley.Grimes, alerted by the UFO he had seen and upon hearing of the angel hair fall, tried tofollow up several reports. Near one site, he found a small mass of cobweb-like matterclinging to a screen door. Not sure of its nature, he wound it around a straw and brought itto my office. Suspecting cobweb, I later put this in a vial and sent it to Prof. CharlesManey at Defiance College, who was making a special study of the phenomena. Prof.Maney later informed me that the sample was too small for proper analysis, but he wrotean article about the \"angel hair\" for the November - December 1956 issue of Britain'sFlying Saucer Review.Then lo and behold, it happened right in my own front yard! On September 25, 1956,shortly before 5 p.m., my wife, Dell, watched \"something\" white waft down in the gentlebreeze and finally alighting on the lawn. Deftly, she gathered the gossamer-like filamentson a stick nd put the collection into a large glass jar. While she was screwing on the lid,one of the filaments somehow caught on the metal surface. Thus, the stick on which waswound the balance of the substance, was left to hang in the jar supported only by thefilament. Pretty tough material, I thought. The filaments seemed sensitive, Dell said,having a tendency to curl when touched - which she did only briefly. Otherwise, she said,the substance behaved quite unmagically. No, she did not see a saucer!Examining the filaments through the glass, I noted that their appearance was differentfrom those that Grimes had collected. But, remembering a photograph of the Puentespecimen, which appeared with an article on this topic in the November 1954 Pageantmagazine, I was impressed by the similarity between the Puente substance and ours.In view of the unique manner in which the specimen was preserved, I wondered next whatto do with it. Mailing it was out of the question, which eliminated the possibility of acivilian analysis out of the city. But I soon found the answer. During this period, I wasdeeply involved with the Air Force on a matter which concerned UFO reporting. So, whenI phoned Captain G. T. Gregory at Section 4E4, Wright-Patterson, regarding my problem, Ialso informed him of the angel hair. Capt. Gregory, keenly mindful of all Air Forceregulations, expressed interest and promised to send a man to my home to pick up thespecimen.On October 12, 1956, M/Sgt. Oliver Hill arrived. Calmly, Hill took pictures of my frontyard, of the glass jar in which hung the mute evidence, and an inadvertent shot of mydaughter, Denise, riding her bicycle in front of me while I held the jar. Then away went thejar to Dayton.On November 15, 1956, ATIC sent me the following: \"The ample purported to be so-called'angel's hair,' reportedly a volatile by-product of the fuel in 'flying saucers,' was given bothchemical and microscopic tests. Without doubt, it is cuprommonium rayon, which is morecommonly called 'Bemberg Rayon' in the United States. This material, after exposure tothe air for 72 hours in the Materials Branch, did not volatilize. This is the type of industrialor waste product 'lint' that might be ejected into the atmosphere by certain manufacturersof textiles, in this case rayon. Incidentally, there appears to be no basis whatsoever for theassumption that the material was other than the industrial waste product described.\"While I am willing to accept the Air Force explanation, I can't help wondering whomanufacture Bemberg Rayon in Eastern Cincinnati?CRIFO files are full of reports describing software oddments, but the one that struck me asthe oddest of all was a whatzit that fluttered to earth like a bird. Upon landing, it burned ahole in the pavement. The stupefied witness, Harold Taylor of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,described the \"thing\" as a \"mass of filthy, denim-like cloth.\" According to the PatriotNews, March 7, 1955, Taylor was looking out of his office window and saw what appearedto him to be birds - like crows, he said - flapping their wings, then gliding for awhile about200 feet above Front Street. Five minutes went by and there was another. But this one wasgliding downward and landed near the top of a tree back of the YMCA.\"It hung there for perhaps half a minute and then floated to the ground like a bird,\" saidTaylor. \"As it hit, though, it seemed to lose its substance and became a mass. I forgot aboutit for a while and when I went out for lunch at noon, I looked at the spot where the 'thing'had landed. It had been depressed into the asphalt.\"Taylor, wary of telling anyone what happened, ate his lunch and returned to the office. Buthe couldn't keep it to himself and confided in Meade Hager. Together, they went out with ashovel and dug 'it' up. \"The smell was terrific,\" he said. \"Something like the gas whichescapes from a faulty refrigerator. It got so bad we had to take it outside.\"At State Police Headquarters, chemical analysis experts looked over the cloth. They ruledcoincidence. Just guessing, but \"coincidence\" was probably no more the answer for theTaylor mystery than the easy-out explanations provided for other freakish events believed"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"to be associated with saucers. FIREBALLS AND ODDBALLSParticularly interesting in this Fortean department of freakish events is not hardware,software or yard goods, but their effects and who or what caused them. [ Editor's Note:Fortean refers to Charles Fort, who wrote books in the 1930s about unexplainablephenomena before the modern age of disc \"saucers.\"] Usually the only evidence is theverbal testimony of man, should her survive, who might relate the details of his experienceor the testimonial impairment to an inanimate body.In many cases, the culprit is a fireball. But to begin with, we must understand that thename \"fireball\" covers quite a large family of fiery phenomena, ranging from themysterious Kelly green variety down to the mischievous little spray of light called St.Elmo's Fire. While the latter might scoot up the mast of a ship or pirouette around a churchsteeple, other so-called fireballs have inflicted damage and death, according to reports. May 6, 1937, Hindenburg Explodes Over Lakehurst, New JerseyAfter the destruction of the zeppelin Von Hindenburg over Lakehurst, New Jersey, in1937, investigators told of a 'ball of fire' - possibly St. Elmo's Fire - maneuvering near theairship. Their guess is that the fireball (UFO?) somehow ignited the hydrogen.Above: Moment of Hindenburg explosion at 7 p.m. ET, Lakehurst, New Jersey,on May 6, 1937, captured by a newsreel photographer. Be low: Colorized film frameafter Hindenburg lay burning on the ground. Thirty-five people died.[ Editor's Note: The Hindenburg was named after Paul von Hindenburg(1847-1934), the President of Germany (1925–1934). It was to have beennamed the Adolf Hitler but Hugo Eckener, director of Luftschiffbau Zeppelin,would not permit that because of his anti-Nazi politics. The Hindenburg wasoriginally intended to be filled with helium, but a United States militaryembargo on helium led the Germans to modify the design of the ship to useflammable hydrogen as the lift gas. This also gave the craft approximately 8%higher lifting capacity.Explosion on May 6, 1937, at 7 p.m. ET in Lakehurst, New Jersey.

The pride of the Third Reich prepared to land, and hundreds ofonlookers gathered to watch. Then suddenly flame burst forward of the upperfin. In a matter of seconds, the largest airship ever built fell in a firey mass.35 people died in the flames - and nobody knew why. Sabotage? A bolt oflightning? The mystery surrounding the disaster has never been resolved -until now. In many years of research, a NASA scientist at Cape Canaveral hasfound proof that neither the hydrogen in the hull nor a bomb was to blame,but the fabric of the Hindenburg's outer skin and a new protective coating. Asingle spark of static electricity was enough to make it burn like dry leaves.The \"infallible\" German engineers had designed a flying bomb just waiting toexplode.]Aircraft were also earmarked for similar fates. From my files marked \"Aircraft Disasters,\"which include a library of statistical data supplied by my colleague, Richard Hall, I notethat several aeronautical mishap have been due to mysterious meteorological or fireballphenomena. One incident occurred on April 11, 1955, datelined Bombay, India. Elevencommunists were carried to their death in the China Sea. Associated Press reported thatsurviving crew members said '...the crash was preceded by a 'muffled explosion. This wasfollowed by fire emanating from an extraneous source wholly unconnected with thestructure of the aircraft.'\" One expert guess was that \"lightning or some othermeteorological freak had caused the crash.\"Although not a disaster and possibly less mysterious was another report, which occurredon July 27, 1957, over Knoxville, Tennessee. A ball of fire burned a small hole in the tail ofan American Airlines plane flying through a thunderstorm. While the airline's spokesmansaid he believed it was caused by static electricity, he also stated that all aircraft have shortwires, which are designed to carry static electricity away from the body of the plane.Down to earth again, another trouble-making fireball - possibly a \"thunderbolt\" - causednear-panic in Sydney, Australia, in October 1954. The story is quoted from FlyingSaucers, the publication issued by CSI of New Zealand.\"Pandemonium broke out in the Sydney suburb of Belmore when a fireball shot acrossthree closely settled streets during a severe electrical storm. Bursting over homes, itsnapped electric wires, strewed them in the street and set gas mains on fire. Dozens ofscreaming women and children had miraculous escapes from death. The fireball cut amile-long swathe of destruction as it shot through the area with a mighty explosion. Bricks,tiles and fences were shot up in the air. Police went from door to door offering to helpdistressed families, some of whom were hysterical with terror.\"Another freak fireball, probably ball lightning, was reported in the Jerusalem Post on April20,1957. The item was sent to me by Herman Rovner, a long-time correspondent, whosesharp eyes for Fortean data have contributed greatly to CRIFO's library. The item stated,\"Fireball lightning, resembling a disc in shape and with an estimated electrical tension ofmillions of volts, struck the transformer of Kfar Shamai at 4:20 this morning. Thetransformer was severely damaged and the insulators melted, turning into a solid block ofglass. The remains were sent to the Palestine Economic Corporation laboratories for tests.The transformer near the Hadassah Hospital was also hit and the power supply broke downfor 90 minutes.\"Nor is man immune. A report dated February 10, 1955, from Auckland, New Zealand, tellsof a groundskeeper walking onto the green of a bowling club. Bending over to begin hiswork, he was shocked to see a fireball, bright red, ranging in from a clear sky and landinginches from his feet. Said the groundskeeper, \"I ran for my life across the paddock, but itwas gone when I turned around.\" Later investigation showed no mark on the green grass.Another incident was a \"fireball\" that struck a woman dead. It was mentioned in an articleby Erna Bence in the Tacoma News-Tribune on April 2, 1957. The article is chiefly adescription of another fireball seen by a high school student, Jim Geise, landing near aroadside. But Geise is also quoted as saying that the Air Force Intelligence officers whoinvestigated told him that a woman walking along a road in Florida had been transfixedwith fear by the sight of a fiery object hurtling silently toward her. She was knocked to theground. Witnesses ran to help,but found her dead with severe burns on her body.When I wrote to the Air Force Press Desk to ask about this Florida incident, their tersereply evaded the issue, suggesting that I write directly to Geise.Similarly grotesque was an incident reported by the Saucerian Bulletin in Clarksburg,West Virginia, concerning four teenage boys on June 25, 1957. While driving to Greenest,Indiana, the boys were attracted to a huge red light in the sky. They parked to get a betterlook. When they stopped the car, the red light moved over them and descended to about200 feet. Curious, the boys flashed the car spotlight on the object. According to their story,"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"it then closed in rapidly and discharged a small object which entered the car window, hitthe floor and bounced up, exploding in one of the boys' face. In the meantime, the parentobject shot upward at great speed and \"turned north like a bolt of lightning.\" When theboys were later questioned, they said the explosion sounded like a loud handclap.Corroboratively, other reports of a similarly described object came into policeheadquarters from the northwest part of the county.Additional information came from C. W. Fitch of Cleveland, Ohio. He told me during anAugust visit that he personally interviewed the boys in Greenest and believed their story.Investigation by recognized authorities earlier, he said, had dismissed the case as a hoax.But he believed \"the discrepancies in the boys' stories could have been due to their state ofexcitement at the time when narrating their experience.\" Fitch also learned that the objectwitnesses was \"cigar-shaped\" and not \"kidney-shaped,\" as described by Barker. Thismix-up occurred when the boys were describing the shape of a fragment of the object,which entered the car's window. According to Fitch, one of the boys described the color ofthese fragments as \"red with silver flecks or fibers in its surface.\"After Fitch's visit with me, I phoned Mr. Kenneth Bennett who is Editor of The PutnamCounty Graphic. I asked his opinion of the incident, which involved his son, George. Theelder Bennett admitted he took stock in it because the boys came to him utterly amazed atwhat they had seen. Regarding the fragments, which he said he4 had misplaced, he statedthey were a yellow shade with purplish hues. He added that the substance was a \"crossbetween a plastic and a glossy paper.\"Similar to the Florida and Greencastle incidents is one taken from the August 1957 issuesof A. P. R. G. Reporter of Seattle, Washington. Datelined Lake Tahoe, California, July 22,1957, this incident follows:\"Two girls, 12-year-old Karen Zunino and 14-year-old Judy Banks, both of Millbrae, SanMateo County, were standing near the boat landing at the trout fishing harbor nearStateline on the south shore of Lake Tahoe when something that 'looked like a ball of firesuddenly zoomed down at the twosome.' Harold Rauch, operator of the boat rental, statedthat he saw the ball of fire knock the girls down. The girls were unconscious for fiveminutes, but the attending doctors reported no injuries.\" Baffling Mystery of Kelly Green Fireballs\"This is a scrupulously accurate eyewitness painting of a mysteriousgreen fireball rushing through the night sky over New Mexico byMrs. Lincoln La Paz.\" Drawing reprinted in Life magazine, April 7, 1952.My files covering freakish fireball phenomena are extensive. Still, the most baffling toscientists is the Kelly green variety, which plagued the skies over the Baltic in 1948 andthe U. S. Southwest in 1949 to 1950. These aerial concentrations have given rise to thebelief that their points of origin were respectively Russia and the U.S. Stating this opinionis Dr. Leon Davidson, who wrote to CRIFO on October 23, 1954, the following:Leon Davidson, Ph.D., October 23, 1954: \"It should be clear that the 'greenfireballs,' or 'green lights,' as they were called in New Mexico when I livedthere, are very different objects from the round, or oval, 'flying saucers.' Thesaucers typically are seen to hover, make sharp turns, vary their speed andmaneuver a great deal. The 'fireballs' travel in straight lines without makingturns, always travel at high speed, never hover and last only a few seconds.We might compare the saucers to flying-wing type aircraft of circular shapeand compare the 'green fireballs' to meteors or 'falling stars.'\"The Air Force has not made public any analysis of the numerous reports of"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"'green light' sightings in the Southwestern United States. However, in the AirForce's final official 'Project Grudge' report, issued by Air Material Commandheadquarters in August 1949, Prof. J. Allen Hynek of McMillin Observatoryin Columbus, Ohio, stated in his personal opinion that the green fireballreports were caused by some secret U. S. research activity being conducted inthe Southwest. This statement, of course, has not been widely publicized bythe Air Force.\"An explanation of this 'secret research activity' can be found in theunclassified and openly published article, 'The First Night-Firing of a V-2Rocket in the United States' by Dr. Fritz Zwicky in the publications of theAstronomical Society of the Pacific, Vol. 59, page 32, February 1947. Thisdescribes the start of a U. S. Government-sponsored program for producingartificial meteors (fireballs) at White Sands, New Mexico. Such artificialmeteors would have appeared at about the times and places at which 'greenlights' were reported and would have had the same appearance. ...It issignificant that the Air Force has never said one word about the workdescribed by Zwicky, although it has been often asked to comment on the'strange coincidence.'\"In case the 'worldwide' appearance of green fireballs is considered to rule outthe above explanation, it should be noted that the foreign sightings beforeZwicky's work started were in the Baltic Sea area. Now this just happens tobe the only other place in the world where V-2 rockets were being fired atthat time by the Russians and their captured German rocket scientists. Itseems quite probable that they were conducting their own upper-atmosphereresearch using 'artificial meteors' produced by methods similar to the onedescribed in Dr. Zwicky's article.\"An amateur astronomer at Los Alamos, New Mexico, who had himselfwitnessed eleven green fireballs from December 1949 to April 1950, stated ata meeting of the Los Alamos Aerophysical Association in 1950 that, in hisopinion, the 'green lights' were not natural meteors. His reasons were:a) the 'green lights' lasted about five seconds each, whereasnatural meteors last about one second only.b) the brilliant green color would be rather unusual for a naturalmeteor.c) the 'green lights' traveled horizontally, while the naturalmeteors usually have a vertical direction.d) the 'green lights' traveled in North-South or South-Northdirections, while natural meteors would tend to move toward theEast or West more frequently. (Incidentally, White Sands is southof Los Alamos.) Other observers at Los Alamos had reportedseeing the 'green lights' break up into a shower of red sparks onoccasion.\"At least one triangulation of the height and speed of a 'green light' wascarried out, using reports from two New Mexico cities a number of milesapart. This triangulation was in the official files and it proved that the fireballwas at about ten miles altitude and traveling at a speed of several miles persecond. This is about what would be expected of 'artificial meteors' asdescribed by Dr. Zwicky in his article in Ordnance magazine, July-August1947. (Natural meteors usually are much faster, traveling at speeds of aboutfive to twenty miles per second.) ...\"While Davidson presents a convincing argument, the years since the suspect concentrationin the U. S. Southwest have witnessed the Kelly green fireball from areas as geographicallyremote as Tasmania and Thule. The Thule incident occurred in 1954 - a green fireballobserved from a military plane. The Tasmanian cases were described in the April 1955issue of Orbit. The worldwide nature of the Kelly green fireballs would tend to rule out theexperimental earth made \"meteor\" theory. So, we must either explain it away as anunknown meteorological phenomenon or accept it with other saucer-like phenomena ashaving a common origin from outer space.Meade Layne of BSRA in San Diego calls them \"wipers\" as if they are sent to earth toerase the radioactive poisons from the atmosphere. On the other hand, Major DonaldKeyhoe once conjectured that they were ranging missiles. Whatever the explanation, wemust then be reminded of the words of General John Samford, who as Director of AirForce Intelligence in 1952 said: \"There have remained a percentage of the total of 20% ofthe UFO reports that have come from credible observers of relatively incredible things.\""},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Continued in Part 8 - The Incredible ThingsMore Information:For further information about Leonard Stringfield's UFO Status Reports, please see reprintsbelow from the Earthfiles Archives:Status Reports I• 10/25/2005 -- Final Part 6: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 10/13/2005 -- Part 5: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 10/05/2005 -- Part 4: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 09/30/2005 -- Part 3: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 09/26/2005 -- Part 2: Retrievals of the Third Kind - Kingman, Arizona Crash• 09/25/2005 -- Part 1: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary CustodyStatus Reports II• 09/19/2005 -- Final Part 9: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/17/2005 -- Part 8: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/14/2005 -- Part 7: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/06/2005 -- Part 6: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 08/22/2005 -- Part 5: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 08/17/2005 -- Part 4: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/20/2005 -- Part 3: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/14/2005 -- Part 2: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/12/2005 -- Part 1: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New DataStatus Reports III• 07/05/2005 -- Final Part 15: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 06/20/2005 -- Part 14: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 06/17/2005 -- Part 13: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 05/10/2005 -- Part 12: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 05/04/2005 -- Part 11: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 04/19/2005 -- Part 10: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence © June 1982 byLeonard H.
