He did fournecropsies, but they do not know what killed the goats.\" - Gini Nichols, Owner White Salmon, Washington, is an hour east of Portland on the Columbia River.October 2 , 2006 White Salmon, Washington - Gini Nichols was born in White Salmon,Washington, fifty years ago. At age thirty, she bought a farm a few miles from town. Thenshe married Andy Nichols eleven years ago. Instead of moving into town, the coupledecided to stay on Gini's farm. The land had become overgrown with weeds, so theypurchased goats to keep the wild plants controlled. This year, their small herd of eightgoats contained one 6-year-old buck male. He was corraled separately from the sevenfemales, who ranged in age from 6-years-old to 5-months-old.On Tuesday evening, September 26, the Nichols had some neighbors over for dinner whohave helped care for the goats when the Nichols were away on vacation or other weekendtravel. All eight goats were healthy and happy to see the neighbors and at 8:30 p.m., thevisitors \"talked goodbyes\" to the goats.Thirty minutes later, at 9 p.m., the Nichols say their two dogs in the house \"went crazy\"barking, but the couple thought it was raccoons outside which had been hanging around.As in so many animal mutilation cases I've investigated over the past twenty-seven years,farmers and ranchers are used to dogs barking for common reasons. So no one wentoutside to look. Later, the Nichols learned that at the same 9 p.m. time, another neighbor'sdog also \"went crazy\" barking. That dog was let out \"to chase raccoons,\" but the people inthe house did not go outside to look, either, assuming raccoons were the problem. A thirdneighbor later reported that around 9 p.m., there was a big ruckus outside that sounded like\"raccoons fighting.\" But again, that neighbor did not go outside to check either. Strangely,no one - neither the Nichols nor their neighbors - heard any goats bleating for their lives.Nine and a half hours later at 6:30 a.m., Gini Nichols got in her car to go to work in WhiteSalmon. But what she discovered only a few feet from the driveway, stopped her cold.Interview:Gini Nichols, Independent goat farmer with husband for eleven years, White Salmon,Wa shi ng t o n: \"On Wednesday morning, September 27, 2006, when I got up to go to work,I was driving out – our driveway goes right past the pasture and I saw one of the goatslying down next to the fence only a few feet away. I thought, ‘That looks really strange.’I stopped the car and honked the horn and yelled for my husband. I said, ‘We have a sickgoat.” Then I looked more and saw the other five bodies lying all across our one-acre field."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Six female goats found dead at 6:30 a.m., on Wednesday, September 27, 2006,in fenced pasture of White Salmon, Washington, farm owned the past eleven years by Giniand Andy Nichols. The udders on three of the goats had been cleanly and bloodlesslyexcised. All photographs by Klickitat County Sheriff's Department.My husband said, ‘I don’t know what happened.’ We were both, ‘What could havehappened?!’I drove on to work and got about a quarter of a mile and said, ‘I’ve got to go back. There’ssomething wrong. We need an autopsy.’ So I went back to the house and we walked outinto the field.One goat was turned lliterally up on her back with her legs up in the air leaning against thefence. That was when we saw her udder was missing.The two Klickitat County Sheriff's deputies who investigated placed a numberthat represented the body count before photographing on Wednesday, September 27, 2006.We both thought that coyotes had come in and ripped her udder off. Then we checked theother goats and two were missing udders and three of them weren’t. But there were nogunshot wounds, no knife cuts, no nothing. There was no blood at all."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"First female goat had no external excisions, but all six females had severelyblackened lungs which baffled the veterinarian who performed necropsies in the field.The second female goat had a neatly \"scalloped\" excision of its udder,a scallop pattern often found in udder excisions from mutilated cows.The third female goat had its legs up against the fence and headtwisted up and to its right side. Its udder had been excised.The fourth female goat was dead without any external excisions.Below her open eye and protruding tongue."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The fifth female goat, black and white behind the fourth goat,had its udder excised at the red site in this photograph.The sixth female goat was dead without any external excisions.\"We didn’t know what’s going on. The more we thought about it, we decided to call theKlickitat County Sheriff's office. Two deputies came about 7:30 a.m. (an hour later). Onehappened to be a retired Fish and Game man, who has seen animal mutilations. Thatdeputy took one look at the goats and he said, ‘This was not done by an animal. This wasdone by a knife.’So, he said, ‘You guys get out of the field. I’m calling in more detectives and this is now anofficial investigation.’ The Sheriff's Deputies looked over the six dead goats and called in aveterinarian. Four Veterinarian Necropsies,But No Cause of DeathHe did four necropsies, but they do not know what killed the goats. They have absolutelyno idea what killed them. And all their lungs were black and collapsed. The vet said it waslike they had been sick for like a week or two weeks for their lungs to be like that. Itshould not have been like that. He said, ‘I don’t know what caused this.’"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"They took tissue samples of the lungs, heart, liver and kidneys and sent them to theUniversity of Washington. So, we’re waiting to find out what killed them.DID THE VETERINARIAN SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OFEXPOSURE TO HIGH HEAT?He did not, not to us anyway. They wouldn’t let us out into the field when he was doingthe actual autopsies. So, I don’t know what he said to the deputies.DID THE VET SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE EXCISIONS THEMSELVES?He said whoever did this knew what they were doing. The cuts were very precise. Theywere not nicked. They went in just deep enough to basically skin the udders off.THE UDDERS WERE THE ONLY ORGANS REMOVED FROM THESE GOATS?The only thing wrong with three of them.THE OTHER THREE WERE DEAD, BUT WITH NO OTHER SIGNS OF EXCISIONS?Ye s .DID THE VETERINARIAN EXAMINE ALL THE GOATS?He did the necropsies here in the field and he did full necropsies on four of the goats andon the other two, he just cut them open and discovered that their lungs were black, too, buthe did not do full necropsies on them.ALL SIX GOATS WERE AFFECTED WITH THE BLACK LUNG?Ye s .DO YOU REMEMBER THE VET SAYING ANYTHING SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT HEWAS SEEING IN THE BODIES?They would not allow us in the field. We were sitting on the porch watching.AND THE EARS, THE EYES, THE TONGUE, THE JAW FLESH...?Everything was there.EVEN THE RECTUMS HAD NOT BEEN TOUCHED?Nothing.HAVE YOU TALKED WITH ANYONE ELSE IN YOUR AREA WHO HAS HAD ANYKIND OF ANIMAL MUTILATIONS?Nobody has said anything, except that maybe there were some cases in Centerville back in1984 to 1985, which is about 25 miles from White Salmon. Dogs \"Went Crazy\" At 9 p.m. Night BeforeDID ANYONE REPORT ANY UNUSUAL SOUNDS OR LIGHTS?No lights. Our dogs went crazy at about 9 p.m. (on Tuesday night, September 26). We’vebeen having a rash of skunks, so we wouldn’t let the dogs out of the house. Then ourneighbors told us afterward that their dog went crazy about 9 p.m. Then another neighborsaid they heard what sounded like raccoons fighting at 9 p.m.DID ANYBODY GET UP TO CHECK OUTSIDE?No, nobody did.HOW FAR FROM WHERE YOU WERE INSIDE YOUR HOUSE TUESDAY NIGHT TOWHERE THE GOATS WERE LYING IN THE PASTURE?From our bedroom to the pasture is maybe 80 feet.SO, IT’S VERY CLOSE.Very, very close."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"AND OUTSIDE OF YOUR DOGS BARKING INSIDE THE HOUSE, YOU DIDN’THEAR ANYTHING?Nothing.AND YOUR NEIGHBORS ARE HOW CLOSE?The neighbors who had their dog upset, they are probably 1,000 to 1,500 feet away.SO YOU WERE THE CLOSEST AND DIDN’T HEAR ANYTHING AND THEY WEREA THOUSAND FEET AWAY AND HAD A DOG GO CRAZY, TOO, BUT IN BOTHINSTANCES, NOBODY WENT OUTSIDE TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON?They released their dog because he has been chasing raccoons. But he can’t get to ourplace because of fences.DID YOU LOOK FOR TRACKS IN YOUR PASTURE?We looked and looked, but our pasture is grass and alfalfa and so there were not anytracks.HOW FAR WERE THE ANIMALS FROM THE ROAD?From the main road, they are about a thousand feet. But from my driveway, they wereonly five feet away.ONLY FIVE FEET FROM YOUR OWN DRIVEWAY?Ye s .SO, WHATEVER HAPPENED THE NIGHT OF TUESDAY TO WEDNESDAYMORNING (SEPTEMBER 26 TO 27) HAPPENED RIGHT OUTSIDE OF YOURHOUSE?Ye s .ISN’T THAT EXTRAORDINARY THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN OR HEARDANYTHING?Yes. It’s extremely scary, is what it is! My goats would not let anybody get close to them.They aren’t going to come up to the fence. So, somebody – I don’t know – they had toplan it ahead of time. And you cannot see my goats from the main road. My house is thelast house on our road.HOW COULD ANYBODY HAVE BEEN RIGHT OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE TOACCOMPLISH THIS WITH SIX GOATS WITHOUT THE GOATS BLEATING,SCREAMING?I don’t know. It has my husband and me really up in arms. To say the least, we are verynervous. Our animals don’t go out at all now. My two dogs stay in at night. One Female Goat Left AliveIt's also strange that of the seven females in the pasture, one is still alive. She is a baby, mybaby, 5-years-old. I hand-fed her, raised her. (The ages of the six dead female goats: onewas 6; two were 4; one was 3; and two were 5 months.)HOW DO YOU THINK SHE SURVIVED?We don’t know. Our thought was that she was in heat and might not have been with theother goats. She might have been over trying to get close to the buck. But we don’t know.BUT THAT FEMALE WAS OUT THERE SOMEWHERE IN THAT PASTURE?Yes, she was. When we found the other goats, she was running around the pasture scaredto death, absolutely scared to death. And she is still so nervous we cannot touch her.\"Gini Nichols has organized a reward fund for information that can lead to the arrest andarraignment of those responsible for killing and mutilating the Nichols' goats.
