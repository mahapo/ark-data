Pathways tosmaller circles and large circles were not there on August 17. Paths were created by a Henry CountyDeputy Sheriff and farm owner, Jim Stahl, plus others who first entered field on Saturday, August 19, 2006,when 12-feet-deep \"walls\" of soybeans were standing untouched between larger center circle andtwo outer, smaller circles.

Where Illinois and Iowa run along either side of the big Mississippi River outlinedin the orange rectangle on the map, that region is known as \"Quad Cities.\" That 4-city complex is Davenport,Iowa; Bettendorf, Iowa; Rock Island, Illinois; and Moline, Illinois. Twenty miles eastof Moline in Henry County is Geneseo, Illinois, a farming community of about 6,500 people. August 28, 2006 Geneseo, Illinois - On Friday, August 25, 2006, around 3 p.m. CDT,Jim Stahl heard and saw a large, dark helicopter circling over the soybean formation to thewest of his house. He managed to grab a digital camera and and got outside as thehelicopter flew over his yard and away to the north."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Above: H-46 or H-47 helicopter flying over the Jim and Chris Stahl home on Middle Roadeast of the soybean crop formation in Geneseo, Illinois, around 3 p.m. CDT on Friday,August 25, 2006.

Or itcould be the larger H-47 model used by the U. S. Army for transport. There are five majormilitary bases in Illinois: Rock Island Arsenal; Scott AFB; Peoria Air National Guard(ANG); Springfield ANG; and the Naval Station Great Lakes near Chicago. The closest toGeneseo is Rock Island Arsenal between Rock Island, Illinois, and Davenport, Iowa, in theQuad City region about a half-hour by car from Geneseo.Rock Island Arsenal is highlighted by yellow on the map.According to the Illinois Governor's office, the Arsenal \"is a center for Department ofDefense logistics ... and is the home to four major U. S. Army headquarters organizationsthat have regional and global responsibilities to soldiers - ranging from Army munitionsmanagement to regional installation management.\"The Naval Station Great Lakes (NSGL) is north of Chicago and about 150 miles northeastof Geneseo. According to globalsecurity.org, NSGL is \"the largest military installation inIllinois and the largest central processing training center of recruits in the Navy.\"Scott Air Force Base is in St. Clair County, Illinois, near Belleville about 200 miles southof the Quad City region and not far from downtown St. Louis, Missouri. The USAF baseserves as headquarters for the Air Mobility Command, the United States TransportationCommand, the Eighteenth Air Force, and the Air Force Communications Agency."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Military Interest in PreviousU.

Video frame by Ted Robertson for © 2006 Earthfiles.Interview:Juliet Vanopdorp, Annawan, Illinois: \"A week before these actually showed up, mychildren and I were driving to Geneseo for an appointment. We started discussing cropcircles. The children were asking questions about how they were formed? I said some weresupposed to be hoaxes, but some are really unknown. Some people think they are aliens. Ichoose to think they are signs from God and messages for us humans, but I don’t know ifwe can understand what the messages mean. The kids asked if we could see one and I saidwe might have to go to Europe because we won’t see any here.Less than a week later, the children came screaming out of their bedroom after watchingthe news, ‘There are crop circles in Henry County!’ They were just thrilled. So, I told themwe were going to go see them. And I wrote the farm owners a letter to explain why wewanted to see them.WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU GOT HERE?I took a few pictures inside the circles as it was getting dark. We didn’t stay very long,maybe five minutes or so. Before we got home, I started looking at the pictures on mydigital camera and there were little bright lights and circular things in a couple of pictureswhere I stood in the back of my husband’s truck and I was trying to get the circles. Thecircles didn’t turn out in the dark, but there are lots of circles in the picture.NONE OF YOU SAW ANY LIGHTS WHEN YOU WERE TAKING FLASHPHOTOGRAPHS?No, we did not.\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Above: Translucent spheres on one of Juliet Vanopdorp's digital images in the Geneseosoybean circles on August 22, 2006.

I emailed a photo of the fungi we found in thesoybean circles to Kathie Hodge at Mushroomexpert.com for identification. Kathie wroteback: \"Your photo appears to be of a stinkhorn called Phallus rubicundus. I don't thinkthis one has a common name beyond Stinkhorn, which applies to many species in a familyof mushrooms called the Phallaceae. The family (and genus) take their name from thesimilarity of the fruiting bodies to phallic organs. They have caps that are covered in greenslimy spores and they stink horribly, smelling something like rotting meat. This attractsflies, which disperse the spores. Stinkhorns are not poisonous and are common incomposted soils around the world. This particular species is not too common in NorthAmerica, but not too surprising to find it here, either.\"Biophysicist W. C. Levengood has hypothesized in his investigations of crop formationsthat the plants and soils show evidence of interaction with microwave and spinning ionenergies. Were the delicate fungi \"scorched\" by microwave energy in spinning plasmavortices during the creation of the five soybean circles? Or is the scorched blackness anatural drying process of the Stinkhorn's dark slime that contains spores?Phallus rubicundus growing out of ground inside one of soybean circleson the Jim and Chris Stahl farm in Geneseo, Illinois.
