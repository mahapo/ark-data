January 3, 2006 Fiji Islands and South Sandwich Islands - Two strong earthquakeshave been reported in island regions north of Antarctica. The first 7.3 magnitude on theRichter scale was east of the South Sandwich Islands which are north of Antarctica. Thesecond several hours later was a 7.1 magnitude located in the Fiji Island chain furthernorth of Antarctica. South Sandwich Islands Associated Press: \"The quake struck at 5:10 a.m. local time (January 3, 2006), and wascentered 10 kilometers under the seabed some 345 kilometers southeast of Bristol Islandof the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands. ...South Georgia, formerly a whalingstation, is now a permanent station run by scientists from the British Antarctic Survey. TheSouth Sandwich Islands to the south of South Georgia are uninhabited. The islands areadministered from the Falkland Islands, another British overseas territory.\" No tsunamiwere reported.

Associated Press reported: \"There were no immediate reportsof injuries or damage and the Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said it did notexpect the quake to trigger a damaging Pacific-wide tsunami. A seismologist at Fiji's Minesand Resources Department. said the quake was too deep to have been felt anywhere in theFiji islands. Fiji is regularly hit by earthquakes in its 332 islands - about 110 of which areinhabited - because it sits in an active seismic area in the South Pacific.\" Fiji island chain north of Auckland, New Zealand, w hich is also north of Antarctica. Antarctic Quakes Linked to Earth Pole Shiftin Edgar Cayce's Prophecies Edgar Cayce was born in 1877 and died in Virginia Beach, Virginia, in 1945. In his68-year-long life, he was known as \"the sleeping prophet\" because he would close his eyesand appear to go into a trance to answer questions about peoples' health, reincarnationhistory, and what he saw as catastrophic changes in the Earth's future. At his death, he leftthousands of accounts of past life and medical readings. A stenographer took notes duringhis sessions and at least 14,000 transcripts of his readings are under the protection of theAssociation for Research and Enlightenment (A. R. E.) in Virginia Beach, Virginia. In one of his readings on January 19, 1934 (Cayce reading 3976-15), Cayce said therewould be a literal and physical pole shift:\"There will be the upheavals in the Arctic and in the Antarctic that will make for theeruption of volcanoes in the Torrid areas, and there will be shifting then of the poles- so that where there has been those of a frigid or the semi-tropical will become themore tropical, and moss and fern will grow. And these will begin in those periods in1958 to 1998 ...\" Also, in the classic book, Edgar Cayce - The Sleeping Prophet © 1967 by Jess Stearn, anexcerpt from another Cayce reading is given:\"Apparently concerned that the 1958 to 1998 cycle would destroy civilization as weknow it, a millennium-minded individual had asked, 'What great change or thebeginning of what change, if any, is to take place in the Earth in the year 2000 to2001 A.D.?' With Cayce's axis change in effect for some sixty years by then, theseer saw at this time a resulting shifting of the poles: 'When there is a shifting of thepoles, or a new cycle begins.' That was for the year 2000 A. D.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Edgar Cayce 1877-1945. Photo at age 32 in 1909. Edgar Cayce at age 55 in 1932. William Hutton, geologist and co-author with Jonathan Eagle of the 2004 book, Earth'sCatastrophic Past and Future: A Scientific Analysis of Information Channeled by EdgarCayce, became interested in Edgar Cayce's Earth changes predictions after he read EdgarCayce: Mystery Man of Miracles © 1956 by Joseph Millard. \"For me,\" says Mr. Hutton,\"that book described the Edgar Cayce phenomenon and it mentioned such things as thelost continent of Atlantis, a coming pole shift, the rising and falling of Lemuria in thePacific and so on. I taught geology in universities and worked in state and a nationallaboratory. Then I decided to retire to Virginia Beach where Cayce had lived and to studyhis readings at the A. R. E. Finally, it occurred to me that as a geologist, I should write abook about Cayce's view of the future Earth. That first one was Coming Earth Changes ©1996, which I published through the A. R. E. and has been a successful book becausethere is so much public interest in the Cayce prophecies about the past and future.\" That lead William Hutton investigating more about the pole shift prediction linked on aprophesied Cayce timeline to earthquakes in the Antarctic and Arctic and consequentialvolcanoes in the \"Torrid zones.\" By 2004, William Hutton and Jonathan Eagle hadproduced another Cayce-related book, Earth's Catastrophic Past and Future: A ScientificAnalysis of Information Channeled by Edgar Cayce. After the January 2, 2006, report of the two large earthquakes north of the Antarctic,William Hutton wrote as his Hutton Commentaries website: \"Major quakes like today's arethe kind that have clear relevance to the pole shift and coming Earth changes predicted inCayce reading 3976-15, on January 19, 1934. Today's quake was located only 2 degreessouth and 5 degrees east of Montague Island, which was the subject of our November 24,2005, bulletin on the eruption of Mt. Belinda (volcano). ...This volcanic island lies only 1.5degrees north of 60 degrees south latitude, our chosen boundary within which we say thatAntarctica is located. Montagu Island is 'close enough [to Antarctica] for governmentwork,' as the saying goes. \"The strong eruption of Mt. Belinda on the island of Montagu, coming as it does at the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"present time, is but another indication ... that the shifting of the poles may be rapidlyapproaching.\" Interview: William Hutton, Geologist and Co-Author with Jonathan Eagle © 2004 Earth'sCatastrophic Past and Future: A Scientific Analysis of Information Channeled byEdgar Cayce and Webmaster, \"The Hutton Commentaries\": \"In Cayce's reading about Antarctic quakes and pole change, we're not talking about theshift of the magnetic poles (which has happened many times in the Earth's history). Thathas nothing to do with what the Cayce readings predicted. We're talking about a true shiftof the axis of Earth's rotation.I read a book called The Earth's Shifting Axis © 1996 by Mac B. Strain (see amazon.com).Strain gave us a skeleton to work from and Jonathan Eagle, my co-author, developed acomputer model to incorporate this theory which was applied for a 1 degree shift down the122 degree west meridian.THE IDEA OF CHANGING THE ACTUAL POLE ORIENTATION OF THE EARTH, ASOPPOSED TO THE OFTEN-DRIFTING MAGNETIC POLES, RAISES THEQUESTION: WHAT KIND OF ENERGY OR FORCE WOULD IT TAKE TOLITERALLY AFFECT THE ANGLE, THE DEGREE, ON WHICH THE EARTH ISTILTED?As you know, the Earth has a tremendous amount of angular momentum that tends to keepit spinning just like it is. What we are proposing is that it is not the entire ball of the Earththat is tipping over. What we're saying is that the densest part of the Earth, which is theiron core has a density about 6.0 or 8.0, somewhere in that range. It has its own innermomentum. In fact, it seems to be de-coupled from all the rest of the Earth. It's thought tobe rotating slightly faster than the surrounding mantle and crust.So, if there are shifts in the interior of the Earth, in the core of the very dense material,there's a good chance this can throw off the equilibrium of the spinning Earth. Then theEarth has to assume a new figure. Or the core has to assume a new figure and that figure issuch that the outer crust and mantle will slide right over the inner core. This then is whatwe think will happen if there is this shift. We're not sure there will be a shift. But that'swhat we think could happen.The results of such a sliding of the grapefruit skin over the core, if you will, those resultsare spoken of in several Cayce readings and this is the end point of our speculations.IN CAYCE'S READINGS, WHAT DID HE LINK THIS DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THEANGLE OF THE POLES TO IN TERMS OF OTHER EARTH EVENTS?It means everything because all the other changes that were predicted in two of the verybest of the readings all of those changes must fit with a 1 degree pole shift. Here is a morecomplete text of Cayce's reading 3976-15, on January 19, 1934:'The earth will be broken up in the western portion of America. The greaterportion of Japan must go into the sea. The upper portion of Europe will bechanged as in the twinkling of an eye. Land will appear off the east coast ofAmerica. There will be the upheavals in the Arctic and in the Antarctic thatwill make for the eruption of volcanoes in the Torrid areas, and there will beshifting then of the poles - so that where there has been those of a frigid or thesemi-tropical will become the more tropical, and moss and fern will grow. Andthese will begin in those periods in 1958 to 1998, when these will beproclaimed as the periods when His light will be seen again in the clouds.' Cayce's Predicted Time Line Is Off?WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE WORDS AND YOU KNOW THAT CAYCE IN THESEREADINGS THOUGHT THIS POLE SHIFT WOULD HAVE OCCURRED BY 2000 TO2001, AND THAT WE ARE TALKING ON DECEMBER 13, 2005, NO POLE SHIFTHAS OCCURRED TO DATE. WHAT IN YOUR MIND DOES THIS SAY ABOUT THECAYCE READINGS, THEIR ACCURACY AND PROJECTING INTO THE FUTURE?I'm so glad you asked that because it bothered me tremendously. I began to wonder moredeeply about the reliability of the Earth change readings. So, what I did was go back to thetime in the 1920s mainly when various people around Cayce, experiencing his first medical"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"readings that were so successful, and then getting the other readings on such things asAtlantis and so on. they began to wonder where the information was coming from. Theyasked many questions about this. This lead to two chapters in our book that deal with thegeneral reliability of the readings, where the information came from, and what causederrors in the readings that were given?I applied the criterion that I developed from the readings themselves on the validity andcredibility of the readings. That includes the fact that the truth of the readings could bewavered. Cayce was a channeler and he could contact millions of subconscious minds.And some that had already passed on. Then there were other sources such as the AkashicRecords, archangels, universal consciousness - maybe a dozen sources in all.Then after he contacted a source, if there was a problem in the environment of the reading that is, if the people who were sitting there listening to him might have strong thoughtsabout some of the material he was covering. Or if he had a cold or other various problems,the material coming through could be wavered.So, I looked at the particular reading which dealt with the years 2000 to 2001. I lookedvery carefully at this and it's in our book. I decided that a particular reading, which was826-8, (August 11, 1936) on pole shift, had low predictive value. This is looking back afterthere was no pole shift and somebody could say this was just my way of covering up for abad prediction, which is also possible. But let me tell you about this particular reading. Itwas given for a woman who had lived on Atlantis. Remember reincarnation is through allthe Cayce readings. A woman who lived on Atlantis. This is what the reading actually said:Question: 'What great change or the beginning of what change, if any, is totake place in the Earth in the year 2000 to 2001 A. D.?'Answer: 'When there is a shifting of the poles, or a new cycle begins.'This fragment was for a 35-year-old male Protestant lawyer. This fellow was all over thelot with his questions. He asked many things that were not according to the initialsuggestion for the reading, which was that he wanted to have the Cayce source commenton his mental and spiritual developments and expression in the present life (1936).It was one of the problems with Cayce that when a person deviated in his questions fromthose of the initial suggestion given by the conductor of the reading that Cayce would bethrown off and material that came through him was wavered as to the full truth of whatwas being transmitted to his subconscious mind.The acid test of pole shift and other Earth change predictions is their scientific credibility.If true, momentous societal and political changes are imminent. The geopolitical map ofthe world will be redrawn. What Jonathan Eagle and I are exploring is the transition fromthe end of one Age to the beginning of another.\"More Information:Click on cover to order.For more about Edgar Cayce, please see reports below in Earthfiles Archives :· 11/19/2001 -- Update on Underwater Megalithic Structures near Western Cuba· 06/13/2001 -- Update on Mysterious Deep Water Sonar Images Off Western Cuba· 05/16/1999 -- Edgar Evans Cayce About His Father and Atlantis"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Websites: http://www.huttoncommentaries.com/ http://www.edgarcayce.org/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
