Find Evansville, Indiana, on the map above. A little southeast of the city is the AngelMounds Historic Site. Several miles northeast of Angel Mounds in Dubois County is the farming community ofHuntingburg. Further northeast is the Crane Naval Surface Warfare Center, worth noting because the militaryhas long been interested in crop formations. [See: 10/03/2003 Earthfiles and 09/12/03 Earthfiles and08/29/03 Earthfiles and 09/04/03 Earthfiles. ]On Sunday, June 25th, w heat farmer David Ring was running his harvester into the last field. Suddenly herealized a big, flat circle was neatly laid down in his crop. He told me the plants “looked combed down in aswirl.” He and one of his farmhands got off the harvester and discovered there were also odd patterns comingoff the big circle. One looked like a backward F and the other was a straight line with two short lines comingoff of it. There were also two big loops coming off one side of the circle that looked a bit like their owntractor tramlines, but Mr. Ring knew he had not made the loops. The width of each of the loops, or three-quarter rings, varied from 1 foot 6 inches to 3 feet 8 inches.David Ring was puzzled. “It was my last field to harvest, I’m a farmer and I wanted to get as much of thatwheat as I could.” He noticed that when he ran his harvester over the formation, most of the flattened circlewheat went into his machine. But the backward “F”, the other strange glyph and the double rings all seemed tobe more tightly flattened to the ground and did not chop up into his harvester. He also noticed that where therings and appendages came into the circle, the flattened plants angled right and left in a zigzag pattern.Zigzag lay of wheat in areas of the flattened wheat circle where the rings and appendagesjoined the circle.

The next morning, the manager of the local Huntingburg Airport flew over thewheat formation and took photographs. By Thursday, June 29, crop circle investigator Ted Robertson - withthe Independent Crop Circle Researchers' Association (ICCRA) - got to the field to take measurements andmake a diagram. The next day, Jeffrey Wilson, Director of the ICCRA, along with other ICCRA fieldresearchers Roger Sugden, Charles Lietzau, Ph.D., Delsey Wilson and Ted Robertson, met at the formationsite to gather plant samples and measure the pattern with a new magnetometer, Broadband TriField EM Meter,Na tur a l Tr i Fi e l d EM me te r , c o mp a s s , a nd Ga mma - Sc out radiation detector. AnomaliesSo far, the apical growth nodes in the collected wheat samples are statistically elongated, which means thatsome kind of complex energy interacted with the plants. Elongated growth nodes have been found in cropformations around the world for the past fifteen years and are not an anomaly that can be produced by hoaxers.Also, the radiation in the crop pattern was two to three times higher than background. The radiation level isnot harmful, but is statistically significant and has been measured in other mysterious crop formations over the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"years. \"Ri ght now ,\" Jeff said, \"the data i s tel li ng us that this Hunti ngburg w heat formati on w as notmechanically man-made.\"Le ft to right: N e w ma gne tome te r, B r oa dba nd TriFie ld EM Me te r, N a tura l TriFie ld EM me te r ,compass, and Gamma-Scout near the center of the main circle.

Image © 2006 by ICCRA.Jeff Wilson, who has investigated dozens of crop formations in the United States over the past decade, told methat at first glance the pattern in the aerial photographs did not appear to be very sophisticated. But when heand his team began to study what was left after the harvester, they found many fascinating anomalies –including one never seen in an American crop formation before.Interview:Jeffrey Wilson, Director, Independent Crop Circle Researchers Association(ICCRA), Williamsburg, Ohio: “Where the rings touch the circle on both sides of this formation, theflattening of the ring pathways flows into the circle on both sides. That was a real puzzle to us when we werefirst walking the perimeter of the circle because how can the rings both flow into the circle on both sides?It turned out that there is divergence in the flow from near the center point of the rings. It’s off the centerline alittle bit. But the whole formation is laid out on a slope. Where this divergence occurred, the flow goes up thehill into the circle and the flow goes down the hill and into the circle – both ways, so it divides them back andforth.Ted Robertson and Roger Sugden, ICCRA, point in opposite directionsfrom the point in the rings where the wheat went down in opposite directions and flowedonto the large flattened circle where the rings connected. P hotograph © 2006 by Jeffrey Wilson, ICCRA.YOU FOUND THAT 'HAIRLINE PART' IN THE TWO-RING HANDLE. THEN YOU ALSO DISCOVEREDANOTHER LITTLE PIECE THAT SEEMS TO BE A KEYSTONE OR CENTER POINT THAT LINES UPWITH THE CIRCLE CENTER AND WHERE THE RINGS PART IN TWO DIRECTIONS?Yes, that is something we spotted on the aerial photograph. There is sort of to the north-northeast of the mainbody of the formation, there was an area of randomly downed, flattened wheat. In that section, there was alittle L-shaped, kind of notch, or flattened area. That appears to be part of the geometry of the formation itself.That is like the keystone to unraveling how the rest of the geometry works inside the rest of the formation. So,that lies on that centerline that divides the part in the two rings, but also goes through the center point of theflattened circle and through this little keystone pathw ay. All the rest of the geometry flow s and is connected tothat point.HOW MANY TIMES IN AMERICAN FORMATIONS HAVE YOU FOUND SOMETHING LIKE AKEYSTONE SOME DISTANCE OUTSIDE OF A PATTERN?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I would say I couldn’t think of a particular formation in which this occurred.The \"corner angle\" beyond the circle, backward \"F\" and \"antenna\" is the keystone to the pattern's geometry.That keystone is right next to an actual Survey Marker standing nearby in the green grass,shown below. Graphic overlay © 2006 by Jeffrey Wilson, ICCRA.Survey marker in David Ring's Huntingburg, Indiana, wheat field.Image © 2006 by Jeffrey Wilson, ICCRA.I CAN’T EITHER. THE ONLY ONE THAT REALLY COMES TO MIND IS THE ONE IN ENGLANDABOUT THREE YEARS AGO WHERE THERE WAS A LAND SURVEY MARKER THAT WAS 200 OR300 YEARS OLD. IT APPEARED TO BE A KEYSTONE FOR THAT FORMATION, BUT AGAIN IT WASMANY METERS FROM THE MAIN FORMATION. EVERYTHING LINED UP AROUND THAT SURVEYMARKER.I would say that nearly every complex formation we’ve looked at has something unique and unusual that we’velearned from. Although this one is unprecedented, it’s not unusual to find something new to discover and tolearn from.It’s interesting, too, that you mention that other U. K. formation that had that survey marker as a keystonebecause right adjacent to this little keystone (in Indiana) is an actual survey marker, a geodesic survey marker,is in the field right at that corner point right next to it. Power Dimming in Huntingburg,Indiana, on June 22, 2006THE FARMER FOUND THIS I BELIEVE ON JUNE 25TH AND THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEENTHERE LONGER. I UNDERSTAND THERE WAS A POWER FAILURE IN THAT AREA AROUND JUNE22ND, THREE DAYS BEFORE, PERHAPS LINKED TO A THUNDERSTORM. BUT SOMETIMESPOWER FAILURES HAVE BEEN LINKED TO TIMES WHEN CROP FORMATIONS OCCUR, AT LEASTIN ENGLAND AND SOME PLACES.That’s a good point. During the rain showers, the local neighborhood, the houses nearby including the house inwhich David Ring’s son and daughter-in-law lived, and the local airport which is adjacent to this field – all ofthose people reported NOT a power outage, but a voltage loss. The power dimmed dramatically, so much sothat they said their light bulbs were just barely flickering on. They called and reported this to the powercompany, but it seemed to be fairly widespread within the immediate area surrounding the formation that therewas this power dimming. It was not exactly a power outage.But power outages or power dimming do seem to be somewhat related to the times that crop circle formationsare reported in a local area. A lot of people have reported this in the past.The area in which this occurred, there are not a whole lot of residential buildings nearby. It’s in a pretty rural"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"area and it’s mostly farmland. I would say within visual distance, there are maybe three houses total. None ofthem are at all close to where this occurred.The formation itself is also about at least 400 feet from the closest road, but it’s also hidden by a bit of a rise.That’s the slope it’s on, on the backside of the slope from the road. No one could really see it from a vantagepoint of driving past. Even though it’s close to the airport, it’s in a place that’s perpendicular to the runways.So as planes are approaching the runways or taking off from the runways, they are not flying over this spotexactly. They are coming in at a completely different angle, so it didn’t surprise me that nobody from any of theairplanes had reported this before the farmer found it while harvesting. It’s also kind of shielded from theairport by a pretty tall grove of trees, so anybody flying low in or out of the runways would have blocked theirvision also.Huntingburg Airport separated from David Ring's wheat field by thick grove of tall trees.Wheat pictograph close to green ditch near center of photo.

American Crop Formation Linkto Ancient Earth MoundsTHIS SEEMS TO UNDERSCORE THE QUESTION: WHY DO CROP FORMATIONS APPEAR WHERETHEY DO? IN THIS CASE, IT MAY BE THAT THE MOUND QUESTION, THE ANCIENT HISTORY OFTHE LAND, HAS MORE TO DO WITH WHY THIS SEEMINGLY SOMEWHAT HUMBLE, BUT QUITEFASCINATING PATTERN, WAS PLACED IN THIS MODERN WORLD AT SUCH A STRANGE SIDE OFA HILL NEAR AN AIRPORT 400 FEET FROM A ROAD. IT MIGHT NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DOWITH THE MODERN TIME. IT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH ANCIENT LINE UPS?That could very well be because this particular area of southwestern Indiana is pretty full of ancient NativeAmerican mounds. We find that formations in the Midwest are coming down in the areas where the mounds arelocated.One of the interesting curious aspects that I uncovered as I was looking through the historical record to seewhat could be nearby in the county or outside of the county, there is a very large Mississippian city calledAngel Mound, where there were several large pyramids near what is now Evansville, Indiana, which is about40 miles to the southwest of where this crop circle location is. That city, and anywhere surrounding it forabout 70 miles, is just filled with Native American mounds across this whole region.WHY WERE THEY CALLED ANGEL MOUNDS?Typically archaeologists when they discover and excavate a site name it after the current landowner. That waswho the landowner was when the Angel Mounds were excavated in the 1920s. The family name was Angel, sothey named the mounds after them.[Editor’s Note: Wikipedia: “Angel Mounds State Historic Site is located on the Ohio River inVanderburgh County, Indiana, adjacent to Evansville. It is part of the Indiana Department ofNatural Resources, Division of Indiana State Museums and Historic Sites. It is one of 16 statemuseums and historic sites in Indiana and is listed as a National Historic Landmark. It is namedafter the Angel Family who settled in this location along the Ohio River in the early 1800s.\"For over a thousand years, Southwestern Indiana w as home to many Native Americans.Today, Angel Mounds State Historic Site is nationally recognized as one of the best preservedprehistoric Native American sites in the United States. From 1100 to 1450 A. D., a town onthis site was home to people of the Middle Mississippian culture, who engaged in hunting andfarming on the rich bottom lands of the Ohio River. Because Angel Mounds was the home of achief, it was the regional center of a large community that grew outward from it for many miles.This settlement was the largest known town of its time in Indiana, but the Mississippian peopleeventually deserted it. No one today knows why.\"] Passenger Pigeons, Magnetic Fields and Earth Mounds"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"There is a school of thought in which the earth mounds might have been placed in certain locations becausethere were magnetic, or electromagnetic, anomalies in those particular areas that the Native Americans couldsense. There is also a second line of thought that in centuries past, the dominant species of animal in NorthAmerica and around the world was the passenger pigeon. There were literally billions of passenger pigeonsand they would migrate in flocks of up to 60 miles long and black out the sun as they flew on their migratorypattern. Unfortunately, the passenger pigeon is now an extinct species – hunted to extinction by man. They w entfrom being the most populous, dominant species on this continent to being extinct within one generation.They seemed to fly along certain migratory routes in which we find all of the major geometric earthworks inthe Midwest. There seems to be a relationship between where the geometric earthworks were placed and themigratory patterns of the birds that w ere flying at the same time.WHICH WOULD TIE IN PROBABLY TO THE MAGNETIC LINES OF THE EARTH?Right. There have been recent studies that show that migratory birds do follow the magnetic field lines. Theyseem to have an ability that actually allows them to SEE the magnetic field lines of the planet. If they could seethe magnetic field lines, they could see where the anomalies were. Then you could see where the birds werespiraling around above the magnetic anomalies wherever they occurred, wherever the spirals or eddies of themagnetic fields would occur.Well, it turns out that in the case of this Huntingburg, Indiana, crop circle formation, this formation falls alongone of these migratory patterns. In fact, if you go just a little bit to the south, southwest of where this formationoccurred, that township is called Pigeon Township. It was named that because that was one of the spawningplaces of the passenger pigeon. If you continue farther south, southwest, you hit the Pigeon River, in w hich thatwater way was one of the major spawning grounds for the passenger pigeon. There is also the Little PigeonCreek nearby there.If you continue on that same trajectory, you hit the Angel Mounds. If you go in the opposite direction, goingnorth, northeast, two or three miles north of Huntingburg there is a mound that is w ritten about in the history ofDubois County, Indiana, which Huntingburg is a part of. There is a mound that was excavated and they foundthere that the top several inches of the earth was nothing more than pigeon droppings. They dug through thepigeon droppings to get to the mound itself to then excavate the burial when the archaeologists were looking atit. So, the passenger pigeons were on the same trajectory and route, and this Huntingburg formation appears tofall right along that line.”Jeff Wilson is still analyzing his magnetometer readings and the results, along with any other new data, will beadded as an update to this Earthfiles report when available.Huntingburg, Indiana, near center of earth mound map.
