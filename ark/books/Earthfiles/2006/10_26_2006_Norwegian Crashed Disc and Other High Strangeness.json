Stringfield. October 26, 2006 - In September 1957, Leonard H. Stringfield, finished his first book,Inside Saucer Post ... 3-0 Blue, based on his research cooperation with the U. S. AirDefense Command Filter Center in Columbus, Ohio. Len had served with the 5th U. S. AirForce and was baffled by three unidentified lights that he and other crew members saw in1945 while being transported in a C-46 near Iwo Jima. After the war, Len Stringfieldseriously began to investigate the UFO phenomena. For the next thirty-seven years, hetried to learn from firsthand sources about government cover-ups of UFO incidents andthe interaction of non-human intelligences with Earth. Len died on December 18, 1994.At Earthfiles in 2003, I began reprinting with his family's permission all of the UFOCrash/Retrieval Status Reports Len wrote. Please see More Information below. Thefollowing is an excerpt from that first book after Len Stringfield collaborated with the AirDefense Command Filter Center under his assigned code name, \"3-0 Blue.\" 1952 Disc Crash in Spitsbergen, Norway"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Spitsbergen, Svalbard Island, Norway, near Arctic.Len Stringfield: \"Another UFO landing report of world-wide significance, but apparentlysmothered by Norwegian authorities, was recounted in the September 5, 1955, issue ofStuttgarter Tageblatt by the Dutch publication UFO-GIDS as follows:OSLO, NORWAY, September 4, 1955 - Only now a board of inquiry of theNorwegian General Staff is preparing a publication of the report on theexamination of the remains of a UFO crashed near Spitsbergen, presumablyearly in 1952. Chairman of the Board, Colonel Gernod Darnbyl, during aninstruction lesson for Air Force officers, stated: 'The crashing of the Spitsbergen disc was highly important.Although our present scientific knowledge does not yet enable usto solve all riddles, I am confident that these remains fromSpitzbergen will prove to be of utmost importance in this respect.Some time ago, a misunderstanding was caused by saying that thedisc probably was of Soviet origin. The Spitsbergen disc - this wewish to state emphatically - has not been built in any country onearth. The materials used in its construction are completelyunknown to all experts having participated in the investigation.According to Colonel Darnbyl, the board of inquiry is, however,not going to publish an extensive report until 'some sensationalfacts have been discussed with U. S. and British experts. Weshould reveal what we found out, as misplaced secrecy mightwell lead to panic.'Contrary to information from American and other sources,Second Lieutenants Brobs and Tyllensen, who have beenassigned as special observers of the Arctic regions since the eventat Spitsbergen, claim that flying discs have already landed in thepolar regions since the event at Spitsbergen. They claim thatflying discs have already landed in the polar regions severaltimes.Said Lieutenant Tyllensen: 'I think that the Arctic is serving as akind of air base for the unknowns, especially during snow stormswhen we are being forced back to our bases. Shortly after suchadverse weather conditions, I have seen them land and take offon three separate occasions. I noticed then that after havinglanded, they execute a speedy rotation around their discs. Abrilliant glow of light, the intensity of which being variable withregard to speed and at landing and take-off, prevents any view ofthe things happening behind this curtain of light and on or insidethe disc itself.'\"[ Editor's Note: Another 1955 European UFO crash and retrievalreport was contained in a special dispatch from the late columnistDorothy Kilgallen, datelined May 23, 1955, London, England,INS, as follows:\"British scientists and airmen, after examining the wreckage ofone mysterious flying ship, are convinced that these strange aerialobjects are flying saucers from another planet. The source of myinformation is a British official of Cabinet rank. He told me: 'Webelieve, on the basis of our inquiries thus far, that the saucerswere staffed by small men - probably under four feet. It'sfrightening, but there's no denying that flying saucers are from"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"another planet.' This official quoted scientists as saying a flyingship of this type could not have been constructed on Earth. TheBritish Government, I learned, is withholding an official report onthe flying saucer examination at this time, possibly because itdoes not want to frighten the public.\"] Pear-Shaped Craft, Red Spray and Microwaves?Back home, and as incredible as any of the freak fireballs and just as disturbing, was thegrotesquerie involving a man, a peach tree, a red spray and a pear-shaped UFO with a fin.The incident occurred over Sycamore Hill, a high point near the heart of Cincinnati, July22, 1955. The principal was Edward Mootz, a benign and non-publicity-minded man whospent much of his spare time beautifying his fabulous garden which was terraced into thehillside.One evening about 6 p.m., Mootz, alone, was tending the soil around a fruit-budding peachtree. Suddenly, from out of nowhere, Mootz was splashed by a liquid red spray, thatlooked like cream soda. His arms bared, but perspiring, were covered with the substance;also the nape of his neck. A billed cap prevented it hitting his face. Looking up, he spotteda strange object passing over heading toward Eden Park. Guessing its height to be morethan 500 feet, Mootz described the object a a pear standing on end, bulbous side upward,with a metallic fin appended to the rear. The object's colors were vivid: red and green,divided at the midsection. No sound was heard.[ Editor's Note: For comparison, the August 1957 issue of APRG REPORTERreported a sighting of July 9, 1957, in Galveston, Texas in which Mrs. A. D.Suderman and her neighbor watched an object through binoculars.\"It was highin the sky, way above the sunset. I could have drawn a line between the redtop and green bottom ... As it turned and moved southwest, the greendisappeared and it was all red, like a large goldfish.\"]While watching the object, Mootz said that he became aware of a sharp tingling sensationon the exposed parts of his arm and neck. \"It felt like phosphorus burning into my skin andthe pain was intensifying,\" Mootz said. Wasting no time, he ran to his house, removed hisclothing and washed thoroughly. Mootz told me later that what saved him, in his opinion,was his heavy perspiration, which helped dilute the spray.The next morning, Mootz revisited the ill-fated spot. To his amazement, the peach tree wasdead! The branches and twigs were shriveled grotesquely; the leaves curled and crispbrown; and the once-healthy buds of peaches looked like prunes. A little digging showedthat the tree was killed to its very taproots - overnight!I learned of the incident a couple of weeks later and made an appointment with Mootz foran interview. It was a Sunday afternoon when Dell and I drove over. We found Mootzmiddle-aged, friendly and chatty. Carefully, he recounted the details of the incident, gaveme samples of the mummified peaches and twigs, showed me the many white pinprickscars on his arm \"where the substance burned in,\" and finally explained that theauthorities, three men, had already visited him, right after the incident and had takenaway the tree and all its dead fruit. Mootz would not identify the authorities, except tosay they were dressed in plain clothes and were courteous. Said Mootz: \"They promised areport of their analysis within six weeks,\" but when I checked a year later, the report hadnot yet arrived.In every respect Mootz was cooperative. I took 8mm movies of the vacant area where thetree had stood and of Mootz standing near it. Later I had him draw for my filesimpressionistic sketches of the UFO he had seen. Indeed, on paper it was strikinglydifferent from the usual discoid UFO shape.I lost no time in getting the \"pruned\" peaches, the twigs and other chunks of root I dug uppinto the hands of a friend of mine who offered to take them to the Physics Laboratory atVilla Madonna College in Covington, Kentucky. There, elaborate tests were made, onewhich involved a comparison of seeds from the Mootz specimen and another provided bythe lab, which had been allowed to dry out sufficiently. Under controlled conditions, onlythe lab seed sprouted normally. The Mootz specimen proved to be completely dehydrated![ Editor's Note: Implication is exposure of Mootz and peach tree to heating, dryingmicrowave radiation.] Pock-Marked Cars"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Spring 1954 introduced a new phenomenon, the glass pox. Starting in Bellingham,Washington, where 1500 windshields of automobiles suffered damage, it then spread east,effecting mostly northern cities. In most cases, the glass showed quick symptoms, one typeappearing as a single pit mark, but usually in multiples, as though pelted by bee bee shot.Occasionally, in these instances, the glass fractured radially from pane to pane. In theother type, the glass assumed a honeycombed appearance; in many instances the glass wascompletely collapsed.Everything under the sun, including the sun, was blamed. Experts were baffled; sauceritesknowingly pointed skyward. Cincinnati, always a saucer hotbed, got in the act. Many localreports reached me in 1954, including the chance to see some of the evidence. But it wasnot until August 29, 1955, that I thought I had a case where the poxed windshield and thesaucer revealed a plausible cause-and-effect relationship.The clues of this suspected tie-in began at 3:15 p.m. when a metallic disc reflectingsunlight was reported hovering over the Ohio River. It then shot away at the approach ofan airliner, which was heading toward the Greater Cincinnati Airport. In the evening,shortly before midnight, another report reached me by phone, describing a bright blueobject shaped like a pear, circling over Eastern Cincinnati. I went outside wearing onlyshorts, looked all around with binoculars, but saw nothing. No sooner than I had retired,the phone rang again. A new voice described a pink object turning red, which had justzipped over Indian Hill. Pretty close to home, I thought. This time, dressed only inbinoculars, I slipped out the side door but was again too late.Next day, my brother Jack phoned. His voice vibrated with excitement as he describedwhat had befallen his neighbor's new 1955 Ford parked in front of his house overnight.The car's rear window was completely shattered. \"It's in a million pieces and each piece isshaped like a cube.\" Nobody could explain it, but the neighbor was plenty mad. Thatevening, still slightly embarrassed for having rummaged through the neighbor's ash cans,Jack brought me a shoe box full of samples. They ranged in size from half-inch cubes tolarger favriform-fractured sections.I later learned from Lex Mebane of Crime Scene Investigations in New York that thefavriform type of poxing, as typified in this one case, was actually no mystery at all.Mebane sums up his research into this phase as follows:\"Windows that crumble suddenly into a multitude of curve-sided, rectangularfragments are made of 'tempered' glass, which has this characteristic mannerof fracture. It has been used in cars only in recent years - I don't know justwhen it was introduced, but it was not long before 1955. Its merit is that it sunusually strong and that when it does crack, it does not crack into the vicioustriangular fragments of ordinary glass. It turns into a sort of 'sand' which isunlikely to cut anyone. This is a safety feature, introduced because cuts frombroken glass are one of the most dangerous hazards of automobile accidents.With tempered glass, this hazard is eliminated.\"I am not sure whether tempered glass is used in windshields. I thinklaminated glass (a plastic sandwich, likewise for safety) is still used there. Iam not sure why. But tempered glass is now common in rear windows. It ismade by sudden chilling of hot glass. This produces a case hardening: thepiece is strong, but unstable, containing locked-in tensions. When it isoverstressed, it goes all to pieces in an instant. The principle is that of PrinceRupert's Drops, which are obtained by dropping molten glass into water.These are tear-drop shaped, with long, curved, tapering tails. The glass isstrained, and if the tail is snapped, the drop 'explodes' into a sandy powder,disappearing before one's eyes. This phenomena is what is seen also in thesudden crumbling of rear windows.\"The question is: What has overstrained the windows and caused them todisintegrate? I have been told by people more familiar with cars than I am thateven standing in the hot sun can do this. The first curved wrap-aroundwindows are also apt to be overstrained in fastening them to the frame andmight 'let go,' seemingly without cause, at almost any time. I think probablythere was also some deficiency in the manufacture, at least at first. Thecrumbling of tempered-glass windows is not really an unusual phenomenonand it just is not the same thing as the 'glass-pox' epidemic of suddenappearance of pits on windshields. The newspapers just picked it up andconfused the two events.\"Science, however, is still scratching its head over the pitting mystery. This is revealed byIrving Petite in a feature article appearing in the Seattle Sunday Times, April 14, 1957.Writes Petite: 'After three years, this mystery appears still unsolved.' He points out that"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"scientists, considering all plausible theories, have agreed that the H-Bomb does not causepocking of glass; that hydrofluoric acid etches glass smoothly; that special resins can causechips in glass, but only under carefully controlled conditions. Suggested answers: Smallblack spheres from H-Bomb, meteors, or an unknown source.Petite goes on to relate that Hanford Thayer, a consultant on the wartime ManhattanProject, is still making a study of the pocked windshield phenomenon. Thayer carefullysearched every square foot of the concrete street in front of his home in Seattle on April15, 1954, during a glass-poxing incident. He found several black, pea-sized particles. One,a spheroid, is a glassy opaque substance and non-radioactive. The hard imperfect ball isbelieved to be the only specimen available for analysis. According to Thayer, thewindshield pocking mystery is not closed!\"More Information:For further information about Leonard Stringfield's UFO Status Reports, please seereprints below from the Earthfiles Archives:Status Reports I• 10/25/2005 -- Final Part 6: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOsand Occupants in Military Custody• 10/13/2005 -- Part 5: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs andOccupants in Military Custody• 10/05/2005 -- Part 4: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs andOccupants in Military Custody• 09/30/2005 -- Part 3: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs andOccupants in Military Custody• 09/26/2005 -- Part 2: Retrievals of the Third Kind - Kingman, Arizona Crash• 09/25/2005 -- Part 1: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs andOccupants in Military CustodyStatus Reports II• 09/19/2005 -- Final Part 9: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - NewSources, New Data• 09/17/2005 -- Part 8: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - NewSources, New Data• 09/14/2005 -- Part 7: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - NewSources, New Data• 09/06/2005 -- Part 6: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - NewSources, New Data• 08/22/2005 -- Part 5: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - NewSources, New Data• 08/17/2005 -- Part 4: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - NewSources, New Data• 07/20/2005 -- Part 3: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - NewSources, New Data• 07/14/2005 -- Part 2: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - NewSources, New Data• 07/12/2005 -- Part 1: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - NewSources, New DataStatus Reports III• 07/05/2005 -- Final Part 15: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing TheEvidence• 06/20/2005 -- Part 14: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 06/17/2005 -- Part 13: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 05/10/2005 -- Part 12: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 05/04/2005 -- Part 11: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 04/19/2005 -- Part 10: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence© June 1982 by Leonard H.
