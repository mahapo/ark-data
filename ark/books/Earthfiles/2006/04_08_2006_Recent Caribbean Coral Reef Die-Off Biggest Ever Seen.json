Water west of Florida and the Keysmeasured 79 degrees F. to a depth of 150 meters (492 feet). And never in weather records had two Category 5 hurricanes occurred within three weeks of each other in thesame hurricane season - and on the same path. Those gigantic storms were Katrina followed by Rita, both fedby all that warm water in the Caribbean. Today we know the 2005 hurricane season had the greatest number of intense storms ever, dominated byKatrina which is now in the record books as the most expensive natural disaster in American history. Withglobal warming expected to keep raising the world’s average mean temperature for the remainder of thiscentury, ocean waters are also expected to be warmer. Those warmer ocean temperatures mean more chances for another Katrina AND the decline and die-off of oneof the world’s most valuable life forms: coral reefs. Coral reefs are like rainforests in the oceans whichprovide shelter to more than 25% of all marine life. In only the past 25 years, 35 million acres of coral reefshave been destroyed – largely by human activities that range from water pollution to dynamite fishing andramming boats into the fragile reefs. If the present rate of destruction continues, 70% of the world’s coral reefswill be gone in a few decades. Like dominoes falling, when the reefs die, whole populations of fish, marineanimals and plants have to move to survive. And survival is not guaranteed without the protective reefs. Now comes sobering new data from the National Park Service, NOAA and Caribbean scientists that the warmGulf of Mexico and Caribbean waters of 2005 caused the biggest coral reef die-off on record. “Unprecedented,” says Mark Eakin, Ph.D. in Biological Oceanography and Coordinator for NOAA’s CoralReef Watch based in Silver Spring, Maryland."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"August 29, 2005 to January 30, 2006: Monitoring the rapid bleaching followed by diseasefollowed by death of coral in the Caribbean. Images provided by NOAA.Interviews: Mark Eakin, Ph.D., Coordinator, Coral Re e f Watch, National O ce anic and Atmosphe ric Organiz ation(NOAA), Silver Spring, Maryland : “What we’ve seen in using our global satellite data is that the warmingin the Caribbean in 2005 was the largest that we’ve ever seen. From the satellite data, we see that the thermalstress to which the corals were exposed was greater than any we have seen in the last 20 years of records.And if we look at just average temperatures of the eastern Caribbean, September when the major warming wasgoing on in the eastern Caribbean – it was the warmest September we have seen in the last 100 years ofrecords.Image courtesy Earth Sciences and Image Analysis Laboratory, NASA Johnson Space Center."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Thermal images of Gulf waters west of Florida and the Keys measured 79 degrees F.to a depth of 150 meters (492 feet). Image courtesy Dept. of Marine Science, University of South Florida.What we saw in 2005 was a warm water mass in the eastern Caribbean that was much more severe than anywe’ve seen in the satellite or instrument records. The result of this was bleaching that extended throughoutmuch of the Caribbean. In some areas such as the Virgin Islands, they saw over 90% of their corals bleachedand more than 20% mortality on average. That wasn’t in just that part of the Caribbean. This level of bleachingextended across the entire eastern Caribbean and was preceded by bleaching in the Florida Keys, in the flowergarden banks off Texas, and on reefs off Panama and Belize. So, this was an event that went across the entireCaribbean. Right now as we’re speaking, there is another area of warm water off ofFiji and Tonga – we just heard reports that there is some mild bleaching going on in those areas. THE BLEACHING IS ALMOST ALWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH WARMER WATER THAT CAUSES THESYMBIOTIC ALGAE TO LEAVE THE CORAL ANIMAL? That’s correct. The same warm water throughout the Gulf and across the tropical Atlantic that leads to the mostintense Atlantic hurricane season on record was the same water that leads to the coral bleaching. So, we’relooking at a large-scale climate event that has many impacts. Worst Case Future for Corals and Marine Life?IF WE ARE IN GLOBAL WARMING AND WE CAN’T SUDDENLY REDUCE THE CO2 AND METHANEBLANKET THAT IS WARMING THE PLANET, THEN WHAT IS THE WORST CASE FUTURE FORCORALS AND MARINE LIFE? It’s hard to really say what the worst case is. There is a wide range of different scenarios that have come outfrom the scientific community. What we do know though is that we expect an increase in ocean temperatures,as well as an increase in atmospheric temperatures. As those temperatures increase, coral bleaching eventsbecome more frequent and more severe. How severe and how frequent they are going to be depends on a lot ofthings that are still uncertain in the computer models. It would be difficult to project how the corals are goingto respond over the next 100 years. IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT THE DIE-OFF OF THE CORAL IN THE 2005 TO 2006 EVENT IS AS MUCHAS 30% IN SOME AREAS OF THE CARIBBEAN? I’ve seen numbers that exceed 25%. But the important part is that these surveys are still going on now. So theextent of this event is still being learned. IT IS UNPRECEDENTED? Absolutely.\" 830-Year-Old Star Coral Died 830-year-old star lobed coral in P uerto Rico colonies has died frombleaching by record-breaking hot water since January 2006. Photograph courtesy NOAA. One of the most recent science reports about the unprecedented Caribbean coral die-off came from Prof.Hernandez-Delgado at the Univ. of Puerto Rico. He recently found that a colony of 830-year-old star coral thatwas more than 13 feet high is now all dead. This surprising death, along with so many other reef corals, has"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"only happened in the past four to five months. That nearly 1000-year-old coral had survived a lot of previousclimate changes - until now. This week I asked a Fisheries Biologist with the U. S. National Park Service in the Virgin Islands if the deathof 830-year-old star coral reefs in 2006 could mean in the future all coral reefs could die? U. S.

Jeff Miller, Fisheries Biologist, U. S. National Park Service, Virgin Islands National Park, St. John,Virgin Islands: \"That is a very grave concern. When we have a ship that runs aground, they can pulverize anumber of 800-year-old coral colonies as well. BUT ISN’T HIS POINT THAT IN 800 YEARS, THIS HAS NOT HAPPENED TO THE PUERTO RICOSTAR CORAL BEFORE NOW, WHICH MEANS THAT WHATEVER THE CONDITIONS ARE, THEYARE WORSE THAN THEY HAVE BEEN FOR 800 YEARS? We can say the accumulative effect of everything had a fatal result on that coral colony. And it’s absolutelydisturbing that that happened. There is no doubt. On one hand, I feel very honored to be able to see thesecorals. And then I feel very sad watching them die and knowing there is nothing I can do about them. Theyhave lived for so long and I have to sit there and go out week after week and watch them disappear. It is very troublesome. It is very discouraging. But yet, we have to keep trying to do something for the aspectswe can manage. We have to keep researching. What caused that 830-year-old coral to die? Was it a bacterialinfection? Was it a combination of different types of bacteria? What was the connection between the bleachingevent and the coral disease that caused it to die in such a short period of time? Absolutely – those arequestions we have to answer. Thank goodness he was there to document it so we can raise it to a nationalpriority and say: let’s do some genetic work and find out what really happens on a DNA level when thesecorals get sick. If you think it’s hard to figure out how you catch the flu, imagine trying to figure out how acoral gets sick. IF ALL THE CORAL IN THE CARIBBEAN AND OTHER PLACES WHERE THERE ARE CORAL REEFSDID DIE, WHAT WOULD BE THE WORST CASE FOR THE OCEANS? If all the coral were to die – boy! I don’t think there would be a time when all the coral dies. Reefs havesurvived a number of times through geological time. I think what w e’re seeing is as the reefs as we know themwould change. Different components will move in such as sponges, macro algae. What happens when we losereefs is there would be more shoreline erosion, the fisheries would be affected to a large degree, and islandsthat depend upon those fish for protein and food would be affected by the decline of reefs. There are serious downstream consequences of coral decline, more so than just ‘There won’t be anything thereto look at when I go on vacation.’ There are some substantial consequences.\" Coral Future in 2006?This week, hurricane forecasters at Colorado State University announced the 2006 hurricane season will bebusy with more large storms than normal, but will not be as terrible as last year. Their projections are basedon complex data that change from season to season. Let’s hope they are right and there isn’t another Katrina.But coral reef scientists are very concerned that as water temperatures climb this summer, more coral willbleach and die."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Top: Normal healthy elkhorn coral on September 2, 2005.M iddle : Same elkhorn coral completely bleached white one month later on October 5, 2005.Bottom: Same elkhorn coral dead on October 26, 2005.
