June 22, 2006 Tulsa, Oklahoma - At the end of April 2006, a 23-year-old man in Texas named TravisWilson killed himself after suffering for a year with the painful, itching syndrome called “Morgellonsdisease.” He said it felt like bugs were crawling under his skin. None of the antibiotics and medicines he triedstopped his agony.The highly strange Morgellons disease did not rise to public consciousness until the past few years. Thisafternoon I talked to a senior communications officer at the Centers for Disease Control. He said thtMorgellons syndrome is finally being acknowledged by CDC as a public complaint that needs to be studied.For the first time, a medical working group has been assembled at CDC to specifically investigate theMorgellons syndrome and that group's first meeting is next week. CDC also now has an e-mail address for thepublic. It is: morgellonssyndrome@cdc.govThe non-profit Morgellons Research Foundation at Oklahoma State University has more than 4,000 peoplenow registered as sufferers. The largest percentages are nurses and teachers."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Recently, I talked with a Morgellons patient who has worked as a nurse for 26 years. Cindy Casey has been afull time registered nurse specializing in critical care since 1990. Three years ago, she began to itch,especially on her legs between her knees and ankles. Then sores opened which she scratched so hard, scarsformed. She also said it felt like bugs crawling beneath her skin and the painful itch was so bad that she couldnot sleep. The weight of clothes against her skin was even painful. Cindy is now on medical leave fromCalifornia Pacific Medical Center's critical care unit. She is a volunteer staff member for the MorgellonsResearch Foundation and described for me her firsthand experience with Morgellons disease.Interview:Cindy Case y, Re giste re d Nurse , Now On Me dical Le ave from California Pacific Me dical Ce nte r'sCritical Care Unit, Hughes Springs, Texas: “The itching is so intense! It was unlike anything I had ever had.I’ve had poison ivy and some things that itch pretty bad, but this was unlike anything I’d ever had. It’s anitching and crawling sensation. It actually feels like something crawling under your skin.And this is kind of the problem because that’s the best way to describe the sensation, yet when you say that to aphysician, they automatically put yo in a category as “delusions of parasitosis.” This is what they’ve beentaught in medical school – that people who have crawling sensations, or think they have bugs (in their skin),are delusional. Now here I am a nurse, and I’m not hallucinating! It’s so frustrating!And these (symptoms) continued on and got worse and worse. And the skin lesions came up. First, it was kindof intermittently. And then like the past three years is when I became full blown skin lesions all over my body.The most unusual part of this is the unusual fibers that you can see emerging from the lesions.CAN YOU DESCRIBE HOW YOU FIRST TRIED TO REMOVE THEM FROM YOURSELF? WHAT DIDIT FEEL LIKE AND HOW DIFFICULT IS IT?It’s pretty difficult. I would take tweezers and try to remove these fibers. It’s very difficult. They have like asubstance on them that is connected into the tissue. A lot of people have pulled long fibers out that aremacroscopic. I do have a few that can barely be seen with the naked eye, but you CAN pull them out with agood pair of tweezers. That’s the only thing you get relief from these lesions is when you can pull these fibersout.AND ONCE YOU’VE PULLED THEM OUT, HOW LONG IS IT UNTL ANOTHER ONE EITHER COMESBCK IN THE SAME PLACE, OR NEARBY?Within 24 hours, and maybe even within 12 hours, I’ve noticed before. They are very fast-growingmicroscopically. They resemble the hyphae of fungus, but they don’t fit any fungus that’s ever been described.It’s too large. But it’s almost like a moldy-like substance.When he (Dr. Wymore) began to try to culture it, nothing grew. So, PCR tests w ere difficult because he did notknow a particular organism to look for. Even forensic labs are just at a loss for having any answers. It doesnot match any, absolutely no textile that is known. I thought analysis would be a lot quicker.”[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a molecular biologytechnique for enzymatically replicating DNA without using a living organism, such as E. coli oryeast. Like amplification using living organisms, the technique allows a small amount of theDNA molecule to be amplified exponentially. However, because it is an in vitro technique, itcan be performed without restrictions on the form of DNA and it can be extensively modified toperform a wide array of genetic manipulations. PCR is commonly used in medical andbiological research labs for a variety of tasks, such as the detection of hereditary diseases, theidentification of genetic fingerprints, the diagnosis of infectious diseases, the cloning of genes,paternity testing, and DNA computing.\"] Analyzing what the bizarre Morgellons fibers are has been slowed down by the fact that Dr. Randy Wymorehas a fulltime job as an Asst. Prof. of Pharmacology and Physiology at Oklahoma State University in theCollege of Osteopathic Medicine. [ Focus on relationship of nereves, muscles, bones, connective tissue andorgan systems.]He works on Morgellons as a volunteer with a couple of graduate students, provoked after he saw the fibersunder a microscope for the first time a year ago and knew he had never seen anything like it before.The fibers are most often clear, but sometimes blue or red. Currently, volunteer researchers are applying whatis called “Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy,” or FTIR, in an effort to find out what the Morgellonsskin fibers are."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Randy Wymore, Ph.D., Asst.

Prof. of Pharmacology and Physiology, Oklahoma State University,Colle ge of O ste opathic Me dicine , and Dire ctor, non-profit Morge llons Re se arch Foundation, OSU: “Wehave solicited the help of the local police crime lab because they do FTIR spectroscopy and they do metalanalysis because one possibility is that the colors are not pigments per se. They are NOT dye, that much isclear. But maybe they are so homogenous in color because it’s actually a metal in a particular ionized state thatgives the colored appearance. So, we’re just waiting for them to do these experiments.The most common are not colored at all - or they have a slightly brownish to darkish apperance to them. Theones that are the most striking are the blue and red ones because they so stand out. The blues are often – theyare just incredibly bright – almost an electric blue.Morgellons fibers in child's lip skin lesion show bright autofluorescenceand are not from textiles. Imaging was done using an Olympus P rovis Microscopewhich employs standard wavelengths for rhodamine (Excitation 550 nm/ Emission/565 nm )and Fluoroscein/alexa 488 (Excitation 494 nm/Emission 519nm).Image courtesy Morgellons Research Foundation.THE REDS ARE VERY DEEP RED, OFTEN ALMOST MAGENTA-COLORED. BUT SO FAR, NO ONEHAS AN I. D. OF A SPECIFIC ELEMENTAL COMPOSITION ON WHAT ANY OF THEM ARE?No. Some FTIR spectroscopy has been done, but until it’s replicated, we can’t really discuss that. It sunfortunate that lesions with bizarre-looking fibers are such a big part of this story. I know from looking atbizarre disease, it really stands out. But what I think is a really awful effect that is taking place with peoplesuffering from Morgellons is that there are neurological effects.Many of these patients are very much like people with diabetes who have uncontrolled bouts of diabetes.There is peripheral nerve damage so they have that pins and needles tingling in their feet, fingers and toes.They have difficulty sometimes feeling things in their periphery, all the way to muscle effects where certainperipheral muscles in their feet and lower legs make it difficult for them to walk. I’ve seen now a couple ofMorgellons sufferers who have very pronounced foot drop. That is when they lift their leg up to take a step,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"their foot just drops at the ankle. They have to take an exaggerated step to place their foot down to take the nextstep so they don’t trip over their own feet.The (patients) also have central neurological effects – something they have coined a name for: ‘brain fog.’ It’sjust a profound difficulty in focusing, clear to the point where some patients actually manifest period of timewhere they have difficulties forming words and communicating.IS THIS WHY IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS, THERE HAS BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT A LINKPOSSIBLY TO LYME DISEASE?I think the initial link of those Morgellons patients, which have been tested for Lyme disease, there seems to bea hi gh coi nci dence of it. Now , w hether or not Lyme di sease has anythi ng to do w i th Morgel l ons, I have noidea.People who have Morgellons disease are very sick. There are skin manifestations and nervous systemmanifestations. It might be communicable or contagious. It can’t be highly contagious, in the same sense likeinfluenza. But then it’s a mystery. We have some whole families where every single family member, includingin-laws, non-blood relatives, sometimes have it.But then, we have other families where a husband or wife significant others have been together for 2, 4, 6years, or in some cases with children, that don’t have it. So, very puzzling!But I am going under the assumption that at the root of this there is an environmental cause, a genetic – eitherpredisposition, or a protective, factor. And then, any other usual suspects in terms of contagious sorts ofelements such as bacterial, viral, protozoan, worms. Nothing really has been eliminated for me, except for – interms of causative agents – I do not believe (it’s) one of the little bugs called collembola (arthropod). A lothas been written about it. But we can’t amplify the DNA from collembola in any of the scabs or shed materialor fibers from patients. So, I don’t believe it’s that. But as far as what the causative organism is, I have noidea.A lot of physicians are still at the point of sending e-mails and calling and saying, ‘Well, why in the world doyou thi nk this coul d be real ?’For myself, physicians and others here at Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences, we’ve movedway beyond that point and now are trying to approach the research as to how do we figure out what’s goingon?In all honesty, it gets tedious trying to defend the fact that this is a real condition, as opposed to something thatis purely delusional. Because we know it’s not (delusional). People say, ‘How sure are you that this is a realdisease?’ Well, the people are suffering horribly! Obviously, it’s real. Something is going on here.But in terms of: Is it something physical that we can try to work at and try and test and try and figure what’sgoing on? After I got to witness an examination and see what we were seeing, I have NO doubt whatsoever asto the reality of Morgellons disease!Just a couple of weeks ago, I think over about a 10-day period, we had 341 or so new registrations in thatshort period of time. And the majority of them were at least two people per registration, all the way up to inone case, one registration represented six fa mi l y me mb e r s .AND THERE YOU ARE BACK TO THE MYSTERY OF CLUSTERING. IS THIS SOMETHING THAT ISINFECTIOUS?Right. While I am sort of investigating something that a lot of people think is sort of on the fringe side, theapproach we are using to investigate is very much mainstream medicine as we try to sort through this and fromthat mainstream medicine’s perspective, I can’t really address the specifics on that (infectious?) because wejust don’t know.AND WHY WOULD SOMETHING THAT’S AFFECTING 4,000 PEOPLE AND COUNTING BECONSIDERED FRINGE?Because of the seeming impossibility of the symptoms. I am totally unhappy with the way physicians justdismissed the symptoms of Morgellons disease and then dismissed their patient.But on the other hand, as far as saying if you were a physician and someone said: ‘I have red and blue fibersgrow i ng out of my ski n.’ A certai n heal thy skeptici sm i s not unw arranted there. For most of us, w e w oul d say,‘No, that’s not possible.’Now, that being said, it does get back to the physician who should do a thorough diagnostic work up. With a$10 handheld microscope from your typical electronics store, you can see even the larger microscopic fibersin the skin with the hand-held microscope. So, it’s not even the matter of having the right equipment to be ableto look at it. But what it does take is actually looking. And that’s what most of the physicians who haveimmediately reached for the ‘diagnosis of parasitosis’ have done. They have not gotten close enough to look atthe skin. They definitely have not looked with a magnifying glass, or a microscope.Because if they did, they would see things in the skin that when you look at someone who is unaffected anddoes not have Morgellons disease, you just don’t see these. Something is definitely going on here.”"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Randy Wymore, Ph.D.: \"Shaft of hair with 'something' wrapped around the shaft.
