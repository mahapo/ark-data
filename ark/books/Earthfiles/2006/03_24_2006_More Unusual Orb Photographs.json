Since then, I have received two more unusual orb photographs I would like to share. These contain spiralstructures inside the orbs that are peculiar, hard to explain and have also turned up in some photographs at cropformations the past few years. Unusual Spiral Orb on Digital FrameTaken in June 2003, Brookline, MassachusettsMarch 17, 2006 \"Dear Ms. Howe,I was reading your website, Earthfiles.com, especially taking note of the unusual lightphotographed by your surveyor friend in New Jersey. There was another photo in the articletaken in Wisconsin in which the 'light' appeared to have structure. Interestingly, I have a photofrom my archives, taken in June 2003, which has a very similar anomaly. It was taken at aHoliday Inn in Brookline, Massachusetts. My family laughed when they saw the photo since itlooks like my son is swinging at the 'ball.' In fact, there was no ball. I had always assumed the'ball' was a digital photo artifact and nothing more. The photo was taken with a CanonPowershot A60 digital camera. I am an engineer and am, consequently, very skeptical of anysupernatural origins! I took the photograph to a couple of local camera shops, Hunts Camera and Video and RitzCamera, both in South Portland, Maine. At Hunt's, the two people I spoke to said they had neverseen such an anomaly, but thought it was external to the camera. This was because a blow-up ofthe image showed chromatic aberration, structure and shadow. The only explanations they couldoffer were dust on the lens or something in the air that would have triggered the flash. Iexplained that dust on the lens was unlikely because photos taken immediately before and afterdid not have the anomaly. If it was something in the air, we did not see it. At Hunt's, they had no clue as to what caused the image, having never seen anything like itbefore either. They, too, thought it was external to the camera. They offered to check out thecamera if it appeared gain. I suspect that will be unlikely because this is the only time inhundreds, if not thousands, of photos that the anomaly has appeared. Please feel free to post it toEarthfiles. I w ould be very interested if anyone else has an explanation. Best Regards,Peter VachonScarborough, Maine\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Above : June 2003, Holiday Inn in Brookline, Massachusetts.

We stayed at the Crescent Hotel which was built about 1885 and is supposed to behaunted. After taking numerous photos with my Sony 7.2 megapixel cyber shot camera whichshowed more anomalies than I ever imagined I would get, I have come to believe that may bethe case. Most of the really strange pictures were taken in our room. After a while orbs became a dime a dozen - there were so many of them and everyone wasgetting pictures of them. But in our room, to the left of the headboard of one of the beds, is alarge white oval that I took 11 pictures of over three days. It would come and go but it alwayswould be in the same location. Most of the photos were taken on our first night there. I awoke at 6:00 a.m. the next morning and even though it was still dark I took a picture of mysister sleeping and the thing was still there. I only got one picture of it that night, but the nextmorning when we were ready to check out, I took a few more shots to see if I could get anythingand there it was again. My friend had a regular camera and she also got a picture of it althoughit did not come out as well as mine.These are the first two pictures I took in our room that evening while my sister was watchingT.V. I don't know enough about digital cameras to know if the glare on the pillow and behindmy sister are from a problem with the camera or not (but I think not). When we went on theghost tour at the hotel we were told that if we got a picture of an orb to take another onebecause the orbs moved. I wound up taking over 75 pictures looking for orbs and anything elsethat might pop up.Do you have any idea w hat this thing could be? Have you ever seen anything like it? The hotel"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"has a web site that tells the history and a few ghost stories. This hotel was also featured on anepisode of Ghost Hunters that is on the Sci-Fi channel and I think it is supposed to air again atthe end of this month.

Behind the sister, the lamp and dresser objects seemto be in motion, as if a time lapse. Yet, the sister and foreground seem still. There is a \"concentric\" orb abovethe sister's head, which in the photograph below seems to have moved to the pillow. The translucent oval,or \"fish\" pattern, at the left of the high bed frame seems to move slightly. Images © 2006 by Susan Saffa. Unusual Orbs on Digital FrameTaken in Summer 2005, Washington, D. C. \"I am sending you another photo I took last summer when w e went to Washington D.C. This picture was takenduring a tour of the Capitol Bldg. and the room is the old Supreme Court Room. After my weekend at theCrescent I started looking back at all my other pictures I had taken with my digital camera. I was surprised athow many orbs I found - I had never noticed them before. I am willing to bet that many people have pictures oforbs that they don't know about. There were a lot in our room and on the ghost tour. You can put this photo onyour website also.Susan SaffaTulsa, Oklahoma\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Above: Old Supreme Court Room photographed during tour of the Nation's Capitol, Summer 2005,Washington, D.
