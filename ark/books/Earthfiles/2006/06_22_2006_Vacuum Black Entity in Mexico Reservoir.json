We arrived there at 2:30 p.m. and I brought my Canon Powershot A-95along with me.\"At around 5 p.m., w e got ready to head back home, so we put things in my boat. Since wewere in the southern region of the dam where aquatic lilies are in abundance, there's no way ofgetting through that is not by boat.\"When we left the dam, there were people getting ready to board their kayaks and it occurred tome to take a photo from that location. I saw nothing unusual until I checked the computer andnoticed that in one of the photos, something similar to a creature in black could be seen,watching the people in the boat.\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"In the 1:23 between the first photograph at 17:12:27 on the left and the second photograph at 17:13:04on the right, the black entity and surrounding beige-colored structure have disappeared.
