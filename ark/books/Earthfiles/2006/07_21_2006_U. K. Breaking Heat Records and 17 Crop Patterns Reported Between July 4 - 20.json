Breaking Heat Recordsand 17 Crop Patterns Reported Between July 4 - 20© 2006 by Linda Moulton Howe\"A streak of light, like a honey-coloured comet tail, flashed past me at eye level no more thansix feet from my head.\" - William Betts, U. K. Crop Circle ResearcherUPDATED with mysterious light photos July 24, 2006 Petersfield, Hampshire, England - It is so hot insouthern England right now that the London Zoo is feeding blood-flavored ice blocks to the lions to help keepthem cooler. The hottest day ever recorded in a British summer was on July 19th. London’s Undergroundsubway system has no air conditioning and temperatures have reportedly reached 117 degrees Fahrenheit,while road surfaces south of London have been melting.Paradoxically, the U. K.’s spring was one of the coldest and wettest on record, slowing down the growth ofcereal crops to as much as eight weeks behind schedule. Until recently. Now all the heat has been making thewheat and barley and other crops grow so rapidly that some farmers near Barbury Castle in Wiltshire Countyhave already started harvesting some fields.Simultaneously, there has been a rash of crop formations in six English counties between July 4th and 19th. Two of the most outstanding were in Oxfordshire on July 8 – both near Wayland’s Smithy, which a year agowas the focus of extraordinary Mayan formations. Some people analyzed the 2005 Wayland’s Smithy patternsand concluded the crop formations contained clocks or calendars counting down to mid-August 2007. Onescientist hypothesizes that an astronomical event might be coming in August 2007, which could impact theEarth. That idea makes the recent 2006 Wayland’s Smithy pattern even more significant because it looks likean explosion that erupts 3-dimensionally from the wheat. Even the British media has been calling it the “first3-D crop formation in English history.”One long-time crop circle researcher and photographer is Lucy Pringle, who is based in Hampshire, England –one county that so far in 2006 has not had a single reported crop pattern. In previous years, there have alwaysbeen Hampshire crop circles and no one knows why this year has been different so far.I talked with Lucy this week about her impressions of some of the most outstanding June to July cropformation, beginning with one reported on June 9th at West Overton. This was the first pattern for WiltshireCounty in 2006. One eyewitness saw a small light flash rapidly out of the West Overton pattern. Thosemysterious lights have long been associated with crop formations around the world.Interview:Lucy Pringle , Crop Circle Re se arche r/Author and Ae rial Photographe r, www.lucypringle .co.uk: June 9, 2006 - West Overton, WiltshireFirst crop formation reported in Wiltshire County on June 9, 2006, in young wheat.Aerial image © 2006 by Lucy Pringle, www.lucypringle .co.uk.“I like the look of the West Overton one (North Farm near West Overton on June 9). It’s rather like a necklace.What is fascinating about it was the sort of arcs, the semi-arcs on the outside on the perimeter. They don’tmatch up on the opposite side perfectly. Yet, it has the most overall harmonious aspect to it. I like it a lot. Acolleague of mine, William Betts, with whom I go into the crop circles quite a lot.

WHAT HAPPENED?That was quite extraordinary in a way because it appeared on the night of the Summer Solstice. There werepolice all around at Avebury, which as you know is a great gathering place being a sacred complex among thestones. It was not all that far out into the field. But that was extraordinary that it appeared with all the policeand people present that night.WHAT DID THE FARMER DO THE NEXT DAY?Well, the farmer the next day – I managed to fly over it and the very next day, he took the center out. (laughs)He hates crop circles! He absolutely hates crop circles, so unfortunately none of us were able to get in to makea physical evaluation of the flattened crop.THAT WAS IN WHEAT, WASN’T IT?That’s right, young winter wheat. In fact, to the best of my knowledge, we have not had any in barley inWiltshire. There have been one or two in barley in Kent. But what is so extraordinary is that we had the very,very cold spring and the crops were held back quite considerably. At one time, we thought there was a delayof about six weeks and then about two weeks. We’ve had intense heat – 35 degrees C. sizzling heat (in the 90sF.) for the past two weeks. This has brought the crops on so fast that they are nearly all turning color earlierthan before. So I think that this season has caught up and it’s going to be – well, w hen I was flying the otherday over Barbury Castle, they were harvesting already certain wheat fields. That’s early!YES, I’M SURPRISED TO HEAR THIS. YOU’RE TALKING IN CENTIGRADE, WHICH IS GETTINGINTO THE UPPER 90 DEGREES F., WHICH IS UNUSUAL.It’s absolutely phenomenal for the U. K.THIS CROP FORMATION BEING IN WHEAT ON JUNE 21, AT SILBURY HILL, IT REMINDS ME SOMUCH OF REPEATING PATTERNS ON THIS VARIATION OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS. I’MCURIOUS WHAT YOU YOURSELF AS YOU LOOKED AT THIS PATTERN FROM THE AIR, DIDN’TYOU THINK OF ALL THOSE OTHER PATTERNS THAT ARE VARIATIONS ON CIRCLES ANDCRESCENTS WITH THE DOT IN IT.Yes, indeed. It does seem to be a variation on all the previous years, as you say. It was a very clean cut onefrom the air. Some people call it the ‘wink’ – with one eye shut and one eye open. But it’s unfortunate, if youcan’t get into it to really examine it from the ground, you can only evaluate it from the air.IT DOES STAND OUT TO ME AFTER LOOKING AT HUNDREDS OF CROP FORMATIONS SINCETHE EARLY 1990S THAT THIS DOES FALL INTO THE PATTERN OF ONE OF THE TRULYMYSTERIOUS.Yes, I think it does. You might say it’s slightly more old-fashioned.

What was so lovely is that I got up at 5 a.m. that morning and I was in the air by7:30 a.m. We flew all the way on a glorious morning. The Rollright Stones are very famous circle of stones. Iwent there one summer solstice and I can remember trying to count the stones and nobody can count the stones.There are thought to be between 70 and 80 in a circle, but nobody knows.WHAT IS THE PROBLEM IN COUNTING THEM?Well, this is one of the phenomena with ancient stone circles. There is some sort of electromagnetic field,which affects your brain. The area of your brain has to do with counting. I know just in the DNA formation in1996 at the East Field, I could not count the circles in there when I was trying to bury my bottles (for watertesting). Everybody was in fits of laughter. It’s the same effect. This is a well-known syndrome – that peoplewithin ancient stone circles due to the electromagnetic field present, they cannot count. They go round andround and say they are sure. There was a baker in the olden days who put loaves of bread around trying tocount. But even then, he could not do it. And it is the most amazing place.HOW WOULD YOU INTERPRET THE 9-FOLD GEOMETRY IN RELATIONSHIP TO THOSE NINEROLLING STONES?9-fold is sacred, isn’t it? You get the sacred of the 9.

If you folded them over, theywould actually fit in the most amazing way.RIGHT. I’M LOOKING AT THE PHOTO AND I CAN SEE THAT, LUCY.It looked truly beautiful from the air – I can’t tell you! And I went into it the day after it appeared andunfortunately it belonged to the same farmer on Silbury Hill. I was only in it for about ten minutes w ith DavidCayton and Robert Hulse and various other people. The farmer was absolutely determined that he was going totake it out.I think it was David Cayton who said, ‘You are actually creating a whole lot more damage than any of us whoare just examining it.’The farmer said, ‘Well, that’s my prerogative, isn’t it?’ And of course, it IS his prerogative. This is what wemust not forget. It is their (farmers’) land. It is their livelihood. And they get fed up with people coming in notasking permission. I think this is something we must bear in mind. I think a lot of farmers in Wiltshire this yearhave said they are going to cut them out as soon as they appear.DID HE DO THAT WHILE YOU WERE THERE? DID HE CUT THIS ONE DOWN?Yes, he did. He came in with his harvester machine and he asked us all to leave, which we did.SO IT WAS ONLY THERE FOR TWO DAYS?Well, I suppose a day and a half.IT’S SAD BECAUSE THIS ONE PERHAPS OF ALL OF THEM THIS YEAR – IT WOULD HAVE BEENFASCINATING TO SEE WHAT SOME GROUND ANALYSIS WOULD HAVE GIVEN.I only got so far in the pattern. I did see little kinks in the crop, little tiny white lines over some of the crop. Idid find some crushed. I can’t say whether that was due to somebody walking over it and because there wereother people in it. I just have to say I have no opinion about that. This is where it is so extraordinarily difficultto carry out ground research unless one is really in it very soon after it has appeared and before a whole lot ofpeople get into it.GIVEN THE FACT THAT SO MANY PEOPLE WERE IN THERE A DAY AND A HALF BEFORE THEFARMER CUT IT DOWN, A LOT OF THAT DAMAGE COULD HAVE OCCURRED BECAUSE OF ALLTHAT HUMAN TRAFFIC.Indeed it could. And this is where I think an awful lot, or majority of times, one has to say: I have no opinion. Icannot have an opinion because I was not there when it formed, so I don’t know. It was very beautiful.

THAT IS THE PICTOGRAM AT BLOFIELD NEAR BRUNDALL,NORFOLK.Yes, it does take us right back to the early days, to 1990 or 1991! It’s a long pictogram with circles that arejoined together by shafts and then there are extremities coming out from the circles. And then it’s a huge thing,a linear thing with the shafts linking the circles.I WAS CURIOUS IF YOU KNEW ANYONE YOU TRUSTED WHO HAS BEEN IN THIS ONE?No, I don’t.HAVE YOU FLOWN OVER IT YOURSELF?No. That’s a long, long way over.

It just borders on to Norfolk as well. We know from the geophysicalsurveys which were conducted about six or seven years ago, that about 93% of all the crop formations inEngland appear on chalk land where you have the aquifers underneath, which respond and react to theelectrical force when these formations appear.

And I think they were saying on the cropcircleconnector, the White Horse at Uffington is linked tothe goddess, Rhiannon, which was connected to birds. So, there it is absolutely on the other side of the WhiteHorse. Many of these things are linked to sacred sites and the energy of those sites must play a part in theinteraction, I think, between the force and the appearance of these wonderful formations.IT’S ALWAYS BEEN MY HYPOTHESIS THAT IT’S ANCIENT INTELLIGENCE THAT IS INVOLVEDWITH THE CROP FORMATIONS.I agree. And focuses on the ancient, sacred sites and mounds.[ Editor's Note: Birds of Rhiannon - \"The Welsh Goddess Rhiannon (Great Queen) wasaccompanied on her white horse by totem birds whose songs could 'awaken the dead and lullthe living to sleep.'Birds possessed supernatural powers and, through Celtic myths, divine entitled frequentlyshape-shifted between human and bird form.Birds are a potent force in Celtic mythology, often symbolizing the flight of spirits to theOtherworld.

Photographs and Research BeforeFarmers Cut Down FormationsSINCE THE FARMERS ARE THREATENING TO CUT DOWN THE PATTERNS IMMEDIATELY, HOWARE YOU GETTING OVER THEM WITH YOUR BEAUTIFUL PHOTOGRAPHS SO QUICKLY?I’ve got a network of information going. As soon as certain people verify something, they tell me. I pass it onto other people and so we have a network going. I think this is important.The thing that is slightly concerning me is my scientific day coming up this following Sunday. I’m particularlyinterested in the hormone level tests. In the past we have had some quite compelling results which make onethink: how does that happen? For instance, one of the results we have had is tremendous fluctuations in thethyroid glands. That’s a very slow moving gland, not like our adrenals which obviously move fast. They haveto because they are a fight or flight mechanism. They have to respond quickly. But the thyroid is a pretty slowmoving, sluggish gland. One year, Annie McCathrie, who was there a couple of years ago, she had a 40% dropin her thyroid levels over a period of two hours from the time we had gone from the control test and gone intothe formation. There was no explanation for that.In fact, a biotechnician with us was concerned about that and said, ‘Let’s hang on and test her again an hourlater.’ It came up a bit, but she was still about 30% down, which is huge. We would not expect that to happennormally, except over a period of several months, not two hours!RIGHT, IN TWO HOURS, THERE WAS THAT DRAMATIC CHANGE.

Wayland’s Smithy is one of the great Neolithic burial chambers in Britain, morethan 5,000 years old. This ancient grave near the Uffington White Horse was named after Wayland, the Saxongod of metalworking.The Australian scientist who found a mid-August 2007 date in last year’s Wayland’s Smithy wheat calendar isimpressed by the recent 3-dimensional explosion from wheat again near Wayland’s Smithy. He sent thefollowing email:“a) some kind of expansion/explosion that b) is losing strength by 1/r-squared as it expands outward through space; and c) its three longest arms show some kind of end detail that tells (presumably) when the rays will reach Earth.“Last year at the Wayland’s Smithy mayan glyph, we were told about August 13-16, 2007,through binary-hexadecimal coding, just as Jamie Maussan – journalist from Mexico City –said, ‘These are dates! Something is going to happen at the date in the formation.’The scientist continues: “We are not talking about something mystical, or legends from theBible, but some kind of hard fact, both astronomical and geological in nature. And it has theinvisible crop artists very concerned. ”If astronomical, the scientist wonders, could it be a cyclic event such as an energy pulse from the black hole atthe center of our Milky Way galaxy? Or increased plasma eruptions from our Sun? Or other galactic event thathumans have never experienced – but which the intelligence behind the global crop formations understandsand anticipates?More Information:Report by William Betts, U. K. Crop Circle Researcher, about his field trip to West Overton, Wiltshire,formation on Sunday, June 11, 2006:\"The time available to me this year to go circle chasing is more restricted than has previouslybeen the case and whereas before I was able to take my time it is now a question of finding awindow of opportunity. When Nick Nicholson phoned me late Sunday evening on the 11th Juneto tell me about an interesting new arrival near West Overton, Wiltshire, I decided to make thejourney down from London that night. When I arrived at the lay-by just past the Bell Inn the fullmoon, which had accompanied me for most of the journey had disappeared behind clouds. Thisleft me standing, pole, steps and cameras on the edge of the North Farm field in the pitch blackof the night.It must have been about 2:45 a.m. when I began my forage through the gap in the hedge and intothe dark, following the directions Nick had given me. I turned to my left and made for the 5thtramline which took me up the gently sloping field. As I approached the copse on my left Icame across a series of wide circular tractor marks which swung across the tram lines. Thesesurely couldn’t be part of the crop circle Nick had described to me over the phone. I hesitated,moved up further then turned back. Nothing else came into view. I was lost. I returned to thebottom of the field and started up one of the other tramlines, again arriving level with the copseon my left. Still no crop circle. I never cut across standing crop and it seemed like miles walking up and down these tractorlines, the field appeared to go on for ever. On my third attempt I once again got more or less"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"level with the top of the copse and was again on the point of returning to the bottom of the field,despairingly, when something happened that stopped me dead in my tracks....a streak of light,like a honey coloured comet tail, flashed past me at eye level no more than six feet from myhead. It was there for a matter of seconds only and crossed in front of me from left to righttowards the open field. The time was now about 3:30 a.m. and I looked at the copse close tomy left then across the vastness of the field to my right.I decided to carry on walking up the hill and came across a narrow fox run crossing the field atright angles to the tramlines. I followed it, and, narrow as it was, by putting one foot carefullyin front of the other I avoided crushing the standing stems of wheat on either side. Its twistingroute took me across at least three tractor lines and I finally arrived at a point where I couldsee the dark mass of the formation below me. I spent what was left of the night and the earlydawn taking photos and looking closely at the circle. The lay had a very spontaneous andnatural looking flow, and although most of the stems were lifting back up to the light I again gotthe feeling of crashing waves and rushing water that I have had in other impressive cropformations.To consider whether this is man-made or ‘genuine’ misses the point, for me at least. The ratherawkward design seen from the aerial views belies the experience on the ground. I felt it had alot of energy. Few if any of the laid stems were crushed, crimped or broken, most were gentlycurved at the base and many of the nodes were bent horizontally to follow the flow of the lay. Icould find no tell-tale white plank marks, although I suppose a garden roller could have beenused, though the bloom on the stems was intact wherever I looked and there was no evidence offoot marks either. If it was man-made some team had gone to a lot of trouble to create it on landbelonging, by all accounts, to a very unwelcoming landowner for little or no satisfaction orbuzz; the formation had almost gone unnoticed...a few days more and the crop could haverighted itself to render the taking of aerial photos pointless.On that point, I returned to this formation 10 days later to find little or no change in the state ofthe crop, it had hardly been visited and the stems were no more advanced in their phototropicefforts to reach the light than before, as if they had been ‘fixed’ in this position by the energythat originally created the formation. I noticed this in the Windmill Hill crop circle of this yearand that was only 24 hours after its creation. The bending of the stems here (see ground shots atwww.culture -crop.com/2006windmillhill.htm ) appeared to be in too much of an advancedstate after only 24 hours to be the sole result of phototropism. Did the energy which struck thestems at the nodes cause the bending, rather like knees bend when given a kick from behind? The problem with the study of this subject is that little room is allowed for any grey areas, theformations are either seen as ‘genuine’ or ‘man-made’. We know little of the mind behind thegenuine circles. As for the man-made hoaxes its not too difficult to get an idea of the mentalityof those who are behind most of them. The North Farm field creation however leaves meperplexed. The whole experience had an otherworldly feel to it, almost as if whoever made it,if man-made, was in on the ‘coup.'\"For further information about worldwide crop formations, please see reports below in the EarthfilesArchives and my book Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles in the Earthfiles Shop. • 06/11/2006 -- Updated: Two Mysterious Circles in Wheat Baffle Kansas Farmer• 04/07/2006 -- First 2006 Grass Circles in Conondale, Queensland, Australia• 09/02/2005 -- \"Mayan Clock\"? in August U.
