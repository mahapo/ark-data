Conrad is the county seat of Pondera. The most recent cow mutilationoccurred in Valier, 25 miles northwest of Conrad. From the early 1970s to 2006, rashes ofmutilations have repeated every few years. In 2001, the Pondera County Sheriff'sOffice investigated fourteen cases officially reported and knew aboutanother half dozen cases not reported.October 17, 2006 Valier, Montana - Thirty years ago in 1975-1976, there were so manycattle mutilations in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico and other parts of theUnited States that sheriffs reported some mutilated carcasses were still warm to touch. Allthe cows, steers, bulls or heifers were usually missing an ear, eye, jaw flesh, tongue,genitals and rectal/vaginal area. Law enforcement often described the cuts as looking likethey had been done with a \"cookie cutter,\" or \"surgical.\"Another common characteristic was lack of blood and no signs of struggle or tracks aroundthe dead bodies - not even the animal's own tracks. That's what made so many sheriffs anddeputies look to the sky and wonder what was lifting the mutilated animals and somehowreturning them, or dropping them, back to their home pastures?One of the hot spots over the decades has been Great Falls, Montana, and surroundingcounties such as Pondera Back in 2001 between June and December, the Pondera Sheriff'soffice investigated fourteen cattle mutilations. On top of those, there were possibly anotherhalf dozen talked about by a rancher west of Conrad who never officially reported them.Recently, on the morning of October 9, 2006, another classically mutilated cow was foundon a ranch in Valier, about twenty-five miles northwest of Conrad. This 1300-poundhealthy cow had been in a herd of approximately two hundred. On October 8, the cattlehad been moved into the stubble field after barley was harvested. The owners saw thateverything was OK at 5 p.m. that day before they locked the gate and went home.But the next morning, a neighbor first saw the cow dead about fifty feet off the countyroad. Eventually word reached the owners and the Pondera County Sheriff, Tom Kuka.

He and a deputy went to see the dead cow on thenight of October 11. Sheriff Kuka has seen a lot of the stripped jaws, surgically strippedudders and cored out rectums.

Atthat time, we would get readings anywhere from 8 to 12 at a quarter mile away. As we gotcloser, it bounced all the way up to 16 right directly east of the dead animal and then backdown to 8. We never got any higher readings than that. It was like there was no radiation,or very little to speak of.We continued to move up on the animal, photographing it as we came all the way around.It was very typical to all the other mutilations we’ve had in this area. There was no sign ofany struggle. There were no signs of any blood.Left jaw bloodlessly stripped of flesh, as in the majority of animal mutilation casessince at least the 1960s.

[ Editor's Note:Sheriff Kuka is waiting for his own 35mm prints to return from lab and I will update myEarthfiles report with photographs he thinks show the bounce.]This mutilated cow was lying in a harvested barley field. The stubble was approximately 3to 4 inches tall. The animal looked like it hit and bounced to the north, but the stubbleunderneath it was bent south. And I still don’t know how – I tried to figure out how itcould have been bent that way. I really haven’t got that through my mind yet how thathappened.Bar ley stubbl e underneath black Angus cow is l ai d dow n goi ng south,while the bounce mark the Sheriff investigated four to five feet southeast of the cow's bodyindicated the animal was first moving in a northerly direction.IF IN FACT, THERE IS SOME KIND OF ENERGY INVOLVED WITHTRANSPORTING THESE ANIMALS, THE ENERGY ITSELF MIGHT HAVE DONESOMETHING TO THE STUBBLE BEFORE THE ANIMAL WAS LAID DOWN?Could have, but only where the animal was actually laying. You could also see where itwas laying with its right side down on the ground. The left side was up and that was theside where the skin was removed on the face clear to the jawbone. The tongue was stillintact.EARS AND EYES?The ears and eyes were still intact, yes.SO WHAT EL SE WAS TAKE N?The whole udder was gone. The hide had been removed cleanly in a size about like a"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"basketball.Cow's udder removed in smooth, clean cut. Sheriff Kuka said there was no bloodon any of the excisions, but inside the abdomen, some blood had pooled (red above).WHAT ABOUT THE RECTAL AND VAGINAL AREA?Yes, that was done like it was all cored out at one time. But because of the time that hadelapsed since the morning of Oct. 9 (when the neighbor first saw the dead animal and didnot report it), the intestines were starting to come out.On the morning of October 12, 2006, three days after the neighborfirst saw the cow dead, intestines were sliding out large rectal and vaginal holethat probably looked like image below of a typical animal mutilation.Cow found Fourth of July week, 2002, by BLM workers underfence wire on ranch in Christmas Valley, Oregon.

I would have had a vet here to do that. If she wouldhave been bred, it would have been this last spring and it would have taken a vet todetermine if she was. But she actually should have been and she looked like a good,well-nourished animal, so I’m sure she was most likely bred.WHEN YOU DO AN INVESTIGATION LIKE THIS, IS THERE ANY REASON WHYYOU DON’T GET A VETERINARIAN IN ALL THESE CASES TO DO A NECROPSY?Yes, the cost. We simply don’t have the money to do it. And most of the vets in this areawould not want to do it anyway. They don’t seem to have time for such things (as animalmutilation investigations).BUT YOU AS SHERIFF IN CONRAD, HAVING DEALT WITH ANIMALMUTILATIONS OVER THE YEARS, FEEL IT IS IMPORTANT TO INVESTIGATE,RIGHT?Ye s .CAN YOU TALK IN SOME DETAIL ABOUT WHAT THE MARK LOOKS LIKE INTHE STUBBLE GROUND?It’s like a piece of angle iron had set down there. It was very symmetrical, like somethingmade from a right angle, or 90-degree angle.Yellow graphic indicates straight depressionin soil \"as if by a 90-degree angle\" approximately three feet longfound about five feet from cow's dead body.It was like if you took an angle iron at a 90-degree angle, turned it, so the edge was downand you pushed that into the dirt – the mark it would leave. And the mark wasapproximately 36 inches, about 3 feet, long.MEANING, THE ANGLE ITSELF WAS MADE BY SOMETHING THAT WAS THREEFEET LONG?Correct.THAT’S BIG!It is. And it was pushed into the ground. That’s something else, too. Where this animal waslaying, we rolled it over so we could see what was on the underside, plus we wanted to"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"draw fluid from the bottom eye because there was no fluid in the top eye.The ground – I don’t know if you have been on farm ground (growing) small grains – itleaves a furrow. That was all pushed down flat, but there wasn’t a big crater like where theanimal would have fallen from a long distance.BUT YOU HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT SOMEHOW, HOWEVER THE ANIMALWAS PUT DOWN ON THAT STUBBLE, THAT THE WEIGHT OF THE ANIMALITSELF HAD CAUSED BOTH A DEPRESSION OF THE STUBBLE AND FURROWAND THE STRANGENESS OF THE STUBBLE GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTIONOF THE ANIMAL’S BODY?Ye s .HOW FAR WAS THE 90-DEGREE ANGLE FROM THE DEAD AND MUTILATEDCOW’S BODY?Four to five feet.IN WHICH DIRECTION?South to southeast. And the stubble was bent to the south. It appeared to us that right onthe other side of this angle iron depression that there was a spot where something hit theground. The mutilated cow looked like she fell from the sky, hit the ground and bounced tothe north, but the stubble underneath her body was bent south. She was headed north,which means her body should have pushed the stubble to the north. The dirt was piled upagainst her stomach, which was facing north. That means the cow would have slid to thenorth.However, when we rolled it up and over, the stubble was pointing south. The dirt, the wayit was piled up against the right rear foot was three-quarters covered with dirt when itcame to rest there.WHICH AGAIN UNDERSCORES THAT THIS ANIMAL WAS DROPPED FROMABOVE.Yes, but strangely the dirt was pushed to the south and the stubble was bent south, eventhough it looked like the cow was dropped going north. The stubble was pointing south justthe opposite of what it should have been.REALLY PUZZLING.Yes, I know. There are so many things about this stuff that I can’t rationalize in my head. Iguess that’s what is so frustrating to me. U. S. Army Lt. Col. Philip J. CorsoWorldwide Animal Mutilations Perpetrated by Extraterrestrials\"...At the White House we were reading about the mutilation stories that hadbeen kept out of press as far back as the middle 1950s... Our intelligenceorganizations believed that the cattle mutilations - that could not be obviouslyexplained away as pranks, predators, or ritual slaughter - were the results ofinterventions by extraterrestrials who were harvesting specific organs, or forexperimentation.\"- Page 182, The Day After Roswell © 1997 by Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso(deceased)RIGHT, AND NOBODY HAS COME UP WITH ANSWERS BEYOND LT. COL.PHILIP J. CORSO SAYING THAT OUR GOVERNMENT KNEW FROM THE EARLY1950S THAT DOCUMENTS HE READ SAID EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICALENTITIES WERE KILLING AND MUTILATING ANIMALS AROUND THE WORLD.AND HE WENT ON THE RECORD IN A BOOK AND ON TELEVISION. THAT ISTHE STRONGEST INSIDER STATEMENT ABOUT THIS PHENOMENON THAT HASBEEN ON THE RECORD.Well, it’s got to be something like that. I can’t – there isn’t anything else out here. Thisstubble I’m talking about – it’s very brittle. If there was a truck big enough to haul thisanimal around, or a pickup, it’s going to leave tracks. It’s going to sink into the ground andleave tracks. There is nothing out there.THIS IS VERY INTERESTING. ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, WHAT YOU ARE"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"DESCRIBING IS WHAT OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS DESCRIBED FOR THEPAST 50 TO 60 YEARS. THAT IS THAT THE IMPLICATION OF THIS EVIDENCEWAS THAT THIS ANIMAL WAS DROPPED FROM ABOVE ONTO THE GROUND.Yes. There are no other marks out here. This field – nobody has been out in this field. Thefarmer/rancher family came out there in late August to early September and harvested thebarley. They left and had not been back in there. Nobody else would have been back inthere. Then, they brought those cattle in and the very next morning, this cow is dead andmutilated. At that time (morning of Oct. 9), nobody could tell it was mutilated. Otherwise,those neighbors would have called. When we get there, it’s still - we’ve had cool enoughtemperatures here that it’s not bloated as bad as it would have been early in the summer.As far as flies or anything else, there was hardly anything there.IN MANY CASES, THE ABSENCE OF FLIES HAS BEEN ONE OF THE STRANGEANOMALIES.Five years ago, there was another mutilation within two miles of this one. At that time,these people reported that their dogs went over to look at that (mutilation) and then ranback to the pickup and jumped in (as if afraid) and didn’t want to have anything to do withit.Today, this same dog came to this one (mutilated cow) and it came up there and sniffedaround and was willing to stay with this animal. Several Neighbors, But No OneSaw Or Heard AnythingTHOSE KINDS OF WHAT SEEM TO BE DIFFERENCES AND CONTRADICTIONSARE THROUGHOUT THE ANIMAL MUTILATION REPORTS. IT’S HARD TO KNOWWHY, BUT IT RAISES THE QUESTION: HOW MANY NEIGHBORS LIVE AROUNDTHAT PARTICULAR STUBBLE FIELD AND HOW CLOSE?Just directly half a mile north of this location of the dead animal is an occupied residence.A half a mile east is another occupied residence. As the crow flies about three-quarters ofa mile is another occupied residence that is kind of northwest of the dead cow. And almoststraight west, a little bit northwest, is part of the family members that owns the cows. Theyare all less than a mile away.SO THOSE ARE AT LEAST FOUR RESIDENCES WITHIN A MILE. DID ANYONESEE OR HEAR ANYTHING UNUSUAL?Nope, not a thing.THAT IN ITSELF IS BIZARRE IF THIS ANIMAL WAS DROPPED FROM THE SKY.I would say with that Air Force base, T. O., there are a lot of helicopters around there. So,it would not have been out of the ordinary, but not a lot of them fly around at night. Coyotes Stayed Away from Mutilated CowAnother thing, coyotes. There are an awful lot of coyotes in that area and dogs bark atnight a lot and bark while the coyotes are howling. That’s not uncommon for dogs to bark.So, unless they saw lights or saw someone driving by or someone came to the door, theyprobably would not think much of sounds like helicopters or dogs barking.IN SPEAKING OF THE PREDATORS, THE NATURAL PREDATORS LIKE COYOTESAND WOLVES, DOES IT STRIKE YOU STRANGE THAT ON OCTOBER 12, ASSPEAK, WHEN THIS ANIMAL WAS FOUND ON OCTOBER 9, THAT IT IS STILLTHERE COMPLETELY INTACT AND APPARENTLY HAS NOT BEEN TORN APARTBY PREDATORS?It does. And the fact that also last night when the first responding deputy arrived at thescene, there was a coyote within 50 yards of this animal and the coyote still did not goafter the dead cow this morning. The coyote was a quarter mile from it this morning.SO, THE COYOTE WAS BASICALLY STAYING AWAY FROM THIS DEADMUTILATED COW’S BODY?Ye s ."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"WELL, I’VE SURE SEEN THAT BEFORE. I’VE SEEN IT WITH MY OWN EYESOVER IN THE MORA AND LAS VEGAS, NEW MEXICO AREA, WHERE I WALKEDWITH A RANCHER RIGHT UP TO A MUTILATED ANIMAL AND WE COULD SEETHE COYOTE PACING AS IF THERE WAS AN INVISIBLE WALL ABOUT 12 TO 15FEET FROM THE BODY OF THAT MUTILATED COW. THE ENTIRE TIME WEWALKED, THAT COYOTE WAS PACING AND NEVER APPROACHED THATBODY.This cow did have some bird droppings on her, but very few. We never saw any birds.There were none there on Oct. 12, that morning when we arrived.WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE BODY OF THE COW?We turned it back over to the rancher, John Peterson, and he wants to leave it there for awhile because he's curious to find out if any predators come around it.\"Ranch owner, John Peterson, examining his dead and mutilated black Angus cow.As of October 19, 2006, ten days after animal first found, the cowhad not been touched by coyotes or other natural predators. Ranch Owner Puzzled by CoyotesJohn Peterson and three other generations of his family have ranched the Valier, Montana,property over the past one hundred years. John was born and raised there 47 years ago.Even though some of his neighbors have had cattle mutilations in the past, he’s never hadone before. The bloodless preciseness of the cuts shocked him. He was also curious to seecoyotes in the field that wouldn’t go near the dead cow. So, he decided to leave her whereshe was found. Ten days later when I talked to him on October 19th, no predator had yettaken a bite.John Peterson, Family Ranch Owner, Valier, Pondera County, Montana: \"This is thefirst mutilation that has ever occurred on this place. My brother and nephew and niece andI run the cows here. They are my brother’s kids. This is the first one any of us Petersonshave ever lost to a mutilation.SHERIFF KUKA SAID YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE THE ANIMAL TO SEE WHATWOULD HAPPEN. COULD YOU GIVE ME AN UPDATE AS TO WHAT HASHAPPENED WITH PREDATORS THERE SINCE YOU FIRST SAW IT ON OCTOBER11?I just drove by there this morning out of curiosity and nothing has eaten on it yet (Oct. 9 toOct. 19, ten days). But there was a raven sitting on the cow. But I don’t believe she waseating nothing there.The other cows have finally moved in. It took them quite awhile. I’m not sure if you arefamiliar with how other cows are around dead cows – how they just kind of go nuts andtear the ground up. These cows have finally started doing that with this dead one.IN OTHER WORDS, THE HERD WAS SO SPOOKED FROM SOMEWHERE AROUNDOCT. 9 OR 10 ON THAT THEY WOULD NOT EVEN APPROACH THAT MUTILATEDCOW?No. I’d be watching from a distance, and the other cows would just graze around her. Then"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"I’d say around Sunday or Monday (Oct. 15 to 16), the cows finally started going aroundher and bawling. And now they are really getting the ground tore up fighting around hernow.BUT SO FAR IN WHAT IS NOW TEN DAYS SINCE YOUR NEIGHBOR SAW THECOW LAYING DEAD FOR THE FIRST TIME ON OCTOBER 9, THERE HAVE BEENNO COYOTES, WOLVES OR ANYTHING?No. My nephew even seen a coyote out there one night. The coyote did not disturb her. Ialso had a coyote come up to my place. I didn’t disturb the coyote because I was curious.It was headed in the general direction (of the mutilated cow), but nothing has stopped toeat on her.HOW UNUSUAL IS THAT IN YOUR AREA FOR A COYOTE OR WOLF NOT TOHAVE PHYSICALLY DECIMATED A DEAD COW BY NOW?Well, we hauled in a load of cows to this one neighbor, and he lost one right away to bloat.It died. My nephew – I have another nephew who lives right beside that place – he said inabout a week’s time, that cow was picked pretty much down to the bones.THIS ANIMAL OF YOURS HAS BEEN THERE FOR A FULL TEN DAYSUNTOUCHE D.Yes. And the coyotes are very thick around here. It’s nothing to hear fifteen or twentycoyotes yipping and howling around the house at night.WHICH MEANS THAT SOMETHING HAS CONTAMINATED, OR IS STILL AROUNDTHE BODY, OF THE MUTILATED COW THAT MAKES THE COYOTES ANDOTHER PREDATORS NERVOUS?Yeah. There’s something there that they just don’t like. I don’t know why the birds arelanding there. Maybe they can’t smell like the coyotes and foxes can. But those coyotessure don’t bother that dead cow - and that's weird.\" Nearby \"T. O.\" Missile SiteThe black Angus cow still lays in the barley stubble field dead and mutilated with marksaround her that suggest she was dropped from the sky and bounced. What aerial objectcarried that cow and dropped her?Only one mile from the dead cow is the \"T. O.\" missile site, one of many undergroundmissile bunkers that have been, or still are, in Pondera and Great Falls Counties inMontana. \"T. O.\" stands for Tango-Zero Launch Control Facility. Tango was the SquadronCommand Post (SCP) in the 564th SMS south of Valier, Montana, about 100 miles north ofMalmstrom AFB at Great Falls, Montana. [For more information about animal mutilationsaround Montana Minuteman missile silos, please see my book, An Alien Harvest, in theEarthfiles Shop and the reprinted Mystery Stalks the Prairie in the Earthfiles Archives.]I asked John Peterson what he feels now about the whole animal mutilation mystery?John Peterson: \"Boy, it's mixed emotions between government and aliens! I hate to bethe guy who says there are Martians out there, but also I look at the government's T. O.missile base right there and they say nothing. Well, they've got to be involved, even if it isaliens. The government has to be involved somehow to not say something - even if theycan't detect it. They've still got to have some kind of interest in it.IF THE GOVERNMENT IS COVERING MUTILATIONS UP, THEY WON'T SAYANYTHING.Yeah, and if they are covering it up, then they are involved.IN THE COVER-UP, THAT'S RIGHT, BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT'S HAPPENINGAND THEY HAVE A POLICY OF DENIAL.Yeah, any time you deny something, that makes you involved, in my opinion.\" If that cow had been dropped from a UFO beam technology to the ground, did that \"T.
