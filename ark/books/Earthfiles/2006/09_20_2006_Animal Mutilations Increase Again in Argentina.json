The yellow areas have all had repeated animal mutilations since 2002,with an estimated total of more than 3,000 in Argentina and Chile.September 20, 2006 Santa Rosa, La Pampa, Argentina - Argentina animal mutilationinvestigator, Guillermo D. Gimenez, recently sent me a report from Santa Rosa, La PampaProvince, Argentina, by Salvatore Valentin Carta, about the unusual death and mutilationof a pregnant mare found bloodlessly cut up. The ranch owners said the horse was nottheirs and the mare's owner is still unidentified. How did the pregnant mare end up on astranger's property?Left side of mare's head removed to the bone; left eye removed, tongue removed,internal organs removed.

The mare wasabout 3-years-old and we are pretty sure was pregnant."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"333 kilometer marker near the location of pregnant mare's mutilated body,north of Santa Rosa, La Pampa, Argentina. Image © 2006 by Salvatore Valentin Carta.\"The body of the mare was empty of organs, the left eye had been cut out and the left sideof the horse's jaw was cut off along with the tongue. We estimate the mare had been in thiscondition for about five days. There were many flies and worms. On September 10 (day ofCarta's investigation), it appeared that the horse had been pulled/moved from its originalsite.\"About 100 meters away is an establishment that raises horses. We asked them about thedead and mutilated mare and they told us the horse did not belong to their property.\" Other La Pampa High StrangenessSince September 10, 2006Scott Corrales of Inexplicata, Journal of Hispanic Ufology, translated a Centro de EstudiosUFO (CEUFO) report by Quique Mario dated September 17, 2006:\"There has been noticeable UFO activity in our region over the past fewweeks. On Friday at 20:10 hours (8:10 p.m.), there were several witnesses tothe vertical descent of a light having the relative size of a soccer ball, rangingin color from white to sky blue. What was most remarkable about the objectwas its vertical trajectory. The episode was seen to the west of the city ofSanta Rosa, capital of La Pampa Province, Argentinean Patagonia.\"At 20:00 hours (8:00 p.m.), we received a report concerning the presence ofanother object with a size similar to that of an elongated football, sweptbackward, having the general shape of 'a pear,' to the southwest of the town ofMacachin, some 150 kilometers southeast of Santa Rosa. Another residentdriving along the road from the Province of Buenos Aires heading into LaPampa also described a phenomenon whose description matched the former.\"Only minutes ago, dozens of witnesses informed me of the transit of twostrange objects flying west to east at regular speed, one ahead of the other.Eyewitnesses reported that they resembled 'the lights of two cars, one aheadof the other.' The observation lasted nearly 3 minutes and surprisingly, thelights 'went out.'\"In recent weeks, animals have been found mutilated in bizarre fashion inwestern La Pampa, while the presence of 'lights' is reported nearly daily. TheCentro de Estudios UFO will visit the area in order to compile more detailsand eyewitness accounts. Six More Recent 2006 Cattle Mutilation ReportsSeptember 18, 2006, Inexplicata translation: \"It was verified that in a ruralfarm located in the vicinity of the 'Padre Buodo' wilderness, located at thecrossing of National Routes No. 35 and 152, Jurisdiction of General Acha(south of Santa Rosas in above map), two black Aberdeen Angus heifers and acalf of the same type and color appeared to have been mutilated, presentingsigns of bodily damage similar to others detected recently (for example, abovemare).\"The deaths, according to the veterinarians consulted, occurred some ten days"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"prior to the date of their discovery. Moreover, in the locality of Quehue, onProvincial Route 18, Kilometer 94, at the 'San Emilio' farm, another BlackAngus calf was found dead and mutilated. A similar fate befell a cow (samebreed and color) found between the localities of Quehue and Utracan, to thenorth of General Acha, on Provincial Route 9. It should be noted that therehas been an increase in cattle mutilations in La Pampa Province, withspecimens of the Aberdeen Angus breed being predominant.\"September 19, 2006, Inexplicata translation: \"Another black Aberdeen Anguscow - this time pregnant - was found dead and mutilated at 17 kilometers fromProvincial Route No. 152, jurisdiction of General Acha, a locality some 110kilometers (68 miles) south of Santa Rosa, La Pampa.\"The animal was missing its right ear, presented a large incision in the udderand an absence of genitals and anus. Only a large hole measuring some 25centimeters (10 inches) in diameter was found, with its edges cauterized, andthrough which 40 centimeters (16 inches) of the dead front legs of its unborncalf protruded.\"The animal's death is estimated to have occurred ten days ago and goes on toform part of the numerous cases reported in the area, which have theaforementioned Pampean locality as their epicenter.\" Since 2002, Animal Mutilations and UFOs Left: Young calf owned by Camilo Lisiardo in Rufino, Cordoba Province, Argentina, founddead and mutilated on July 1, 2002. Its jaw flesh was thoroughly removed. Photograph © 2002 byEl Diario de la Republica. Right: Strange lights continue to be reported in areas of mutilatedanimals, such as this one videotaped on July 10, 2002, in Villarrica, Chile.Video frame © 2002 by Alberto Sandoval.Perhaps the strangest event in Argentina in 2002 occurred at the end of June. The locationwas Suco west of Rio Cuarto very near the border of San Luis Province. A well-knownlivestock producer found nineteen of his cattle inside a large water tank that had a sheetmetal tank and a metal conical cap. Nine of the cattle were dead, according to aveterinarian who was called to examine the animals. The remaining ten animals were aliveinside the water tank, but near death from the freezing cold temperature of the water.Police also investigated. So far, no one has been able to explain how the nineteen cattlewere put inside the tank, which was even surrounded by a tall fence.If you consider eyewitness accounts in the United States over the past 30 years in whichpeople have seen beams of light come out of glowing discs in the sky and have watchedanimals rise up in the beams and then be lowered back down into pastures by the beams,such a technology might be able to put nineteen cattle inside the water tank. If that didhappen, it still does not answer the question: why would anyone, or anything, want to putnineteen cattle inside a large water tank?More Information:For further information about Argentina animal mutilations and high strangeness, pleasesee reports below in the Earthfiles Archives:• 06/23/2005 -- Updated: More Than 3,000 Unusual Animal Deaths Reported in Argentinaand Chile Since 2002• 09/07/2002 -- High Strangeness Continues in Argentina• 07/19/2002 -- Unusual Animal Deaths and Unidentified Aerial Lights Persist in Argentina• 07/02/2002 -- Argentina's SENASA Blames Mouse for Animal Mutilations• 06/22/2002 -- Argentina Animal Mutilation Count Rising Above 100• 06/15/2002 -- Cattle Mutilations In LaPampa, Argentina"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Website:Inexplicata http://inexplicata.blogspot.com/ Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
