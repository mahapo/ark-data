S. government informationabout a classified project called SERPO. The internet buzz also produced a Wikipediaentry which states:\"Project Serpo is a term in ufology circles referring to an alleged exchangeprogram between ultra top secret levels in the government of the United Statesand aliens from a homeworld called Serpo. In November 2005, an anonymoussource claiming to be part of a high level group of people within the USDefense Intelligence Agency (DIA), began releasing information allegedlyconcerning Project Serpo. This released information claims that in July 1947there were two extraterrestrial disk UFOs that crashed in the state of NewMexico, widely known and referenced as the famous Roswell UFO incident.\"The Project Serpo releases further claim that there was one surviving alienentity, known as EBE, which was an abbreviation for ExtraterrestrialBiological Entity. Communication was allegedly established with thissurviving EBE, and consequently its home world. The EBE lived for 5 yearsand died in 1952. Communications continued with the home world, allegedlyin the Zeta Reticuli star system, which led to the arrangement of an exchangeprogram taking place between 1965 to 1978, in which 12 American astronautstraveled to Serpo, 8 of whom returned. Project Serpo may also have beenknown as Project Crystal Knight at the time (1965-1978).\"I first heard there had been an exchange of humans with one or more extraterrestrialbiological entities at Holloman AFB on April 25, 1964, while I was working on a televisionproduction for Home Box Office entitled: UFOs, The E. T. Factor. The hour special wasnever completed or broadcast because of U. S. government interference. [ See my firstbook, An Alien Harvest © 1989 in Earthfiles Shop.]I never heard the word \"Serpo\" until the November 2005 internet release, which struck meas a lot of misinformation mixed with a few facts. Thus, a classic U. S. governmentintelligence effort to muddy waters of an actual historic event classified under a policy ofdenial in the interest of national security. Further, contaminated Serpo release would allowinsiders to monitor who contributes information to the unfolding Serpo saga. The penaltyfor violating signed oaths of secrecy in the U. S. military and government intelligence canbe stiff fines and imprisonment. It's also possible that the Serpo material planted on theinternet since November 2005 was officially approved by a need-to-know authority whowanted to test the public waters. Either way, mixing a lot of fiction with a few facts isstandard operating procedure in such calculated intelligence efforts.The Serpo details on the internet were different from what I had been told in generaloutline in the early 1980s and later given more details in 1991 by the late Richard Neal, M.D., a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology at the Beach Medical Center in Lawndale,California.Dr. Neal was a gynecologist who began investigating disappearing pregnancies in womenwho also described being taken by non-humans aboard craft for gynecological procedures."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"He presented his collected data in a presentation entitled \"The Missing Embryo/FetusSyndrome\" at the 1992 Mutual UFO Network Symposium in Albuquerque, New Mexico.While I was working in 1991 as Supervising Producer and Concept Creator on aParamount/Fox-TV special entitled, UFO Report: Sightings, I met with Dr. Neal in LosAngeles. He had handwritten notes from an off-the-record discussion he had with a U. S.intelligence operative about an early 1960s human and extraterrestrial biological entityexchange at Holloman AFB, or from not far away at the Trinity Site in the northernpanhandle of White Sands Missile Range. Exchange destination: a planet in a solar systemrevolving around one of the two binary stars of Zeta Reticuli I and II, 39.41 light-yearsfrom Earth.

Photographs courtesy NASA. Dr. Neal and I had previously discussed information I had written in my first book, AnAlien Harvest © 1989, about a landing of an egg-shaped craft at Holloman AFB on April25, 1964, and an exchange of physical artifacts which I had discussed with RobertEmenegger at his Los Angeles home in spring 1983. [ My notes from that 1983 discussionare included in the page scans below from An Alien Harvest.] Bob Emenegger had beenthe writer of a television program entitled, UFOs: Past Present and Future. Its firstAmerican broadcast was in 1974. Bob had been exposed to discussions about 16mm filmthat documented a UFO landing at Holloman AFB, which he and the TV producer, AllanSandler, were supposed to receive for inclusion in their television program. Authorities inthe Pentagon yanked the allegedly unique historic film from Emenegger and Sandler rightbefore their final editing and broadcast deadlines."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I first came to talk with Bob Emenegger because of a radio interview he had done onHouston, Texas, radio station KTRH, Thanksgiving Day 1976, about a UFO landing atHolloman AFB in the presence of an \"Alphonso Lorenzo.\" During my research for theHome Box Office special in 1983, researcher Tom Adams in Paris, Texas, had heard aboutthe radio interview. I was able to obtain a copy and tracked Bob Emenegger down todiscuss it in more detail. [ Part 2 of this report has the relevant radio transcript excerptabout Alphonso Lorenzo.]By then, in many off-the-record conversations trying to find substantive ground on whichto proceed with the HBO documentary, I was told that Steven Spielberg's November 16,1977, release of his now classic feature film, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, wasbased on some historic fact. I was told that Holloman AFB was the scene of a UFO landingand meeting that included exchange of artifacts and one or more humans entering anextraterrestrial spacecraft for a trip to an EBEN planet in the binary star system, ZetaReticuli I and II. See 120705Earthfiles.In 1991, Dr. Neal wanted me to know that not only did he have a discussion with an insidesource which confirmed the human/E. T. exchange, Dr. Neal said he had been told thatthree men went to an EBEN planet in the Zeta Reticuli system. One man, he said, had diedthere, one had gone insane (fate unknown) and one had been returned to Earth and placedin a U. S. government safe house on an island to live out the rest of his days without thepublic or media ever knowing. Dr. Neal understood that the survivor was referred to as\"Alphonso Lorenzo,\" also known as Guillermo Mendoza. Beginning on Aug 29, 2006, at 2:17 PM, Bren Burton of the internet forum, Open Minds,wrote to me:\"Dear colleague, I realise that you are very busy, but maybe you could shedsome light on something for me. I run a forum (Open Minds) which isdebating the 'Serpo' phenomena. www.OpenMinds.co.nr If you are not awareof the story - it relates to some of the disclosures which, I believe, you wereintroduced to some years ago, regarding a supposed alien exchange prog.Would you be kind enough to let me know your thoughts about the 'serpo'disclosures and give your permission to have those thoughts published on ourforum? I would be more than happy to provide a direct link to your'earthfiles' web site. Either way, thanks again for your time, and for anyinsight you may be able offer.Best wishes,Bren Burton.\"That afternoon, I replied:\"Thanks for contacting me. I learned back in the 1983-1984 time period aboutan alleged exchange program of humans leaving Holloman AFB on April 25,1964, for Zeta Reticuli with non-humans while I was working on a Home BoxOffice television special entitled, \"UFOs: The E. T. Factor.\" I was told threehuman men went: one died on the alien planet; one went insane (don't knowfate); and one returned to Earth and was given a safe house in which to livethe rest of his life on an island provided for by the U. S. government.\"For more details, please see my books available at http://www.earthfiles.com/shop.cfm1) An Alien Harvest2) Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I: Facts & Eyewitnesses3) Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"There is also relevant information in the extensive Archives of my newswebsite, http://www.earthfiles.com.\"That same day, Brendon wrote back:\"Thanks for the response. I'm going to push my luck here (!), but could youelaborate on how you came by that information?\" He also inquired about BillRyan at the Project Serpo website doing an interview with me.\"The next day on August 30, 2006, since I had been on the record from 1989 through the1990s concerning what I had learned about an alleged Holloman landing and exchange inmy 1989 book, An Alien Harvest, and my 2-volume books (1994 and 1998), Glimpses ofOther Realities, I replied:\"My main source was Robert Emenegger, the writer of UFOs: Past, Presentand Future, which was broadcast in the U. S. on television in the late 1970s. Ithink it would be of great value to you all if you would read my 2-volumebook, Glimpses of Other Realities, in which I discuss Emenegger and much,much more. After you and your colleagues have absorbed those two books,then I would be happy to do an interview.\"On August 30, I also received a follow up inquiry from Brian Parks, Torrance, California,about Brendan's Serpo inquiries:\"Beside Bob Emmenegger, was your other source James McCampbell?\"On August 31, 2006, I replied:\"I am not commenting on SERPO. I know nothing about SERPO as anacronym or program.\"I am only relating what I was told back in the early 1980s about a humanexchange. My information about an exchange did not come from JamesMcCampbell.\"What I left out was my 1991 conversation in Los Angeles with the deceased Richard Neal,M. D., about his handwritten notes described above.Later that day, this exchange was posted by Victor Martinez (ongoing, large email listabout SERPO), leaving out my clarification that I was not addressing SERPO which Iknow nothing about:Brendan Burton (Admin of the Open Minds forum) asked Linda Howepersonally about \"Project SERPO\":LINDA REPLIED: \"I learned back in the 1983-1984 time period about analleged exchange program of humans leaving Holloman AFB on April 25,1964, for Zeta Reticuli with non-humans while I was working on a HomeBox Office television special entitled, \"UFOs: The E.

He lived in Houston and had access to NASA but did notwork for NASA.\"BILL RYAN: This is potentially very important ... it starts to look likea trip to Reticulum 4 DID occur.\"I've also received two messages from a claimed intel source in the last24 hours who said that several important details were just plain wrong,and suggested that either I'd got lucky and guessed uncannily accurately(in the event that I'd made it up), or that I'd been deliberatelydisinformed.He said no more because he told me I was heavily monitored. This personappears only to have just now come across the Serpo story on the Web.The game may have changed now. Let's forget the details of the story,how many went, what the dates were, even the alien culture and whetherGMRRF exists or not (I'm sure it doesn't). Only one question is reallyimportant. Was there an exchange program?I suggest that the answer is that there WAS. The circumstantial evidencemounts, and the \"Project SERPO\" story on the Web site starts to looklike disinfo which surrounds and protects the details of an incrediblytrue event. Another important question is what other untold truths thedisinfo may be designed to conceal.All views welcome, and do copy to others if you wish.Best to all,– BILL RYAN\"The next day on September 1, Hal Puthoff, Ph. D., Director of the Institute for AdvancedStudies at Austin, in Austin, Texas, and a pioneer in the search for zero point energy, wroteto Victor Martinez the following email after forwarding my comment to Bob Emeneggerand asking if my comment was true:\"On Sep 1, 2006, at 10:36 AM, Puthoff@aol.com wrote:Victor, I checked with Bob Emenegger concerning the statement circulatingthat he verified an exchange program. Here's his answer:\"The truth is I was briefed on three aliens, looking similar to us, only short,blue grey skin - met with Holloman AF personnel -Alfonso Lorenzo acted as ahost/handler (medical tech) - He alerted Paul Shartle at Norton (AFB inCalifornia) about the incident and film of the event.

I saw a document from Holloman with his nameon it. I read, at Norton, where it landed, the date, specifics who was involved,which building they were taken to ; where the craft was stored (end of MarsAve) and about signals they were asked to ID. At Holloman everything wasthere as outlined. Col Lane/Shartle's military boss and OSI (at Norton) knewwhat Shartle was doing. Col Weinbrenner (Commander Foreign Tech) didn'tblink when I mentioned it.\"When showing our program at ASTARA in Upland Calif.

The head radar man at Holloman made reference to\"the day that 'flying bathtub' landed\". No one at the Pentagon questioned theincident (but also didn't comment one way or another - except to add \"...anevent that may happen in the future... or perhaps has already happened\" Ididn't take any liberties. The Pentagon had a legal agreement with finalapproval on all we presented Yes, this is a remarkable event - If at the time Iknew more. I may have done more.
