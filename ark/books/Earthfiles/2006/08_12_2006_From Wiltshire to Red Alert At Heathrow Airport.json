I had been insouthern England for two weeks to explore crop formations and do more research on the mysterious red rain ofKerala, India. [ See: Earthfiles061606 and upcoming new report. ]The big, white, full moon was setting over the Vale of Pewsey and the sun was rising in pink and gold cloudsas I reached the M-4 freeway back to London. The car radio was playing peaceful classical music when therewas a news interruption about a British intelligence discovery that terrorists planned to blow up airliners enroute from England to the United States. The three targeted airlines were United, American and Continental.My flight was United, scheduled to leave in about five hours. Scotland Yard and MI-5 had suddenly made adecision that morning to order British airlines to ban all liquids and food from carry on that might be used asexplosive chemicals. Passengers would be restricted to a passport, airline ticket, small billfold and not muchelse which had to be in a clear plastic bag. Everything else had to be checked. Further, it was not clear if anyflights would be allowed from Heathrow to the United States.Stunned, I looked at the large case and shoulder bag I had planned, as always, to keep with me that containedmy cameras and other valuable gear, along with a full water bottle. There was no room in my check-onsuitcases for any of it. At that moment, I w ondered if I should take the next exit to any town other than Londonand wait out the crisis. But my gut said: Keep going. You could get trapped in a deteriorating situation.A few miles from Heathrow, the traffic was slowed to barely moving and even police cars and ambulanceswere stuck in the jam w ith their alarm lights turning. When I finally got my rental car to Avis, no one knew ifany American-bound airliners would fly. But an Avis manager said, \"You should try to get to United and seebecause this situation could last for a long time.\"One of hundreds of police and milita ry pa trolling outs ide a nd ins ide H e a thr ow A ir port,London, on August 10, 2006.

The threat level was raised to highest Red.Image © 2006 by Stephen Hird, Reuters.When I got to the terminal, there were military men carrying machine guns and police with large rifles. Traineddogs were sniffing luggage everywhere in the crowd and barking, making me wonder what the dogs had foundthat could blow up any of the airliners we were trying to board. The atmosphere was potential catastrophe. Allof us were trying to wrap carry-on we did not want to leave behind in makeshift bundles, bound by airline tapeand labeled with paper name tags. It was a leap of faith in crisis that somehow the airline baggage systemwould be able to keep track of all those last minute packages sent along conveyor belts to airlines that might,or mi ght not, fl y."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"All carry-on was reduced to passport, airline ticket, and small billfoldto be carried in clear plastic bags handed out at Heathrow.Image © 2006 by David Moir, Reuters.A valuable book I had purchased in a small Avebury bookstore was confiscated with the firm warning: \"Nobooks allowed!\" When I asked why, the security officer said angrily, \"We don't know why, but it's an order.No books!\" I begged to keep it and more security people came to me. \"There are no exceptions.\" I asked,\"Could you mail it to me?\" Finally, one of the female security said she would try to mail it and took myaddress card. That confiscation of books is an ironic metaphor of the police state mentality that is beginning toovertake western industrialized nations in the war for freedom in Iraq and other radical terrorist spawninggrounds. Can cellulose in book paper be used by terrorists to make bombs from shampoo, toothpaste and othercommon liquids? No one seemed to know.For tw o hours, w e all w ai ted not know i ng if our Uni ted fli ght w oul d be cleared for take off. The announcementto board came w ith urgency. Quickly the plane was filled up because no one had any carry-on. The big jetrolled tow ard a runway and then stopped w ith engines running. After about thirty minutes not moving, thepilot's dejected voice announced that we were in an unusual limbo state: Heathrow could not give clearance totake off until the FBI and Homeland Security in the United States gave permission for the United flight to landat Washington Dulles airport. The pilot also said that the United States had ordered military jets to fly overmajor East Coast cities to patrol incoming air traffic to America. If we took off, our flight would be only thesecond one from Heathrow to the U. S. on August 10. Most all other flights had been cancelled. We weretrapped w ith jet engines running for ninety minutes, not knowing w hat would happen.Finally, four hours late, United Flight 921 took off from Heathrow for Washington Dulles. When we landed,instead of cheers, there was an eerie silence from the passengers. If everyone else felt like I did, there was anaching sadness deep inside me about the insane minds that have changed the world so terribly in only fiveyears - changes in which a few have been able to put the majority in repulsive, increasingly tightening straightjackets.People in the big U. S. Customs room at Dulles were uncommonly quiet as well. Perhaps now everyone isafraid of being arrested, even for speaking innocent words amid so many armed police. I overheard onefemale security officer, with her large gun strapped to her hip and tears in her eyes, say to another securityofficer, \"Today I even had to taste baby milk to see if it were real.\" Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
