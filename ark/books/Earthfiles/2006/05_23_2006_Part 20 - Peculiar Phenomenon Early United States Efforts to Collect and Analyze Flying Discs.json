That's all I was photographing, bodies.\" - U. S. Army/Air Force PhotographerReturn to Part 1The U. S. Army 509th Bomb Group, Z-Division at Sandia Base, New Mexico; the antiaircraft artillery schoolat Ft. Bliss, Texas; and U. S. Army Ordnance, Enemy Equipment Intelligence Section, attempted to pick updebris of a crashed aerial vehicle in a pasture between Corona and Roswell. At the same time, other crasheswere reported, including on the Plains of San Agustin. In the San Agustin crash, there reportedly were twodead entities, one severely injured and one live extraterrestrial biological entity which attempted to givecomfort to his fallen comrades at the crash site. I have no details about yet another possible crash east of theRio Grande River near San Antonio, New Mexico. Please note that the Corona and San Agustin Plains eventsare discussed and documented by Stanton Friedman and Don Berliner in Crash At Corona © 1992.Briefly, this is what happened. W. W. \"Mack\" Brazel found silver debris in one of his ranch pastures on themorning of July 3. Some witnesses say it was the next day on the Fourth of July that Mack went to see theChavez County Sheriff in Roswell; others say it was July 5. The Sheriff, George Wilcox, called Walker Fieldand was given Major Jesse Marcel, Intelligence Officer of the 509th Bomb Group. Major Marcel and otherswent to the Corona crash site. After returning to Walker Field, the men presumably reported to theCommandi ng General of the Ei ghth Air Force i n Ft. Worth, Texas, that they had found a crashed UFO.Mack Brazel reported his discovery to a local radio station. As the report was being transmitted overAssociated Press teletype between Roswell and Albuquerque, the message traffic was interrupted. Thetelephone rang and a man identified himself as an officer at the Pentagon. The man threatened the teletypeoperator by saying \"bad things\" would happen if she did not immediately stop the transmission. On July 7,another radio station in Roswell transmitting a story for ABC and the Mutual Broadcasting Network, wasinterrupted. A simple statement came over the teletype: \"THIS IS THE FBI, YOU WILL CEASETRANSMITTING...\" [ Crash At Corona © 1992 by Friedman and Berliner.]The story being transmitted included the information that the crash debris was reportedly going to be taken toTexas. But the pilots were from Wright (Patterson) Field, Ohio. The plane was under orders of GeneralNathan Twining's AMC. General Twining (MJ-4), however, was not in Ohio. He was in New Mexico - first atthe AFSWP at Sandia Base in Albuquerque. Later he went to Alamogordo Army Air Field and, it is believed,went from there to Carrizozo and Corona.In 1947, neither the U. S. nor any other military or security group of any other country could instantaneouslydescend upon a small community and tie up their communication systems without considerable prior planning.A wire dispatch between Roswell and Albuquerque could not have been interrupted in the middle of atransmission without prior knowledge that the security group needed to monitor communication lines in aspecific geographic area.Anti-aircraft Artillery, the Army Air Forces at Alamogordo Army Air Field and Army Ordnance at WSPGknew that they had \"splashed\" possibly three flying discs: one northwest of WSPG; one near San Antonio andthe other northeast of WSPG - due to their own covert action. The U. S. Army knew to monitorcommunications in these areas because the flying discs were headed in those directions when the flying discswent off range radar behind the crests of the San Andres Mountains on the north and west, and Oscura Peak tothe north. None of these military groups, however, had the expertise to monitor communications. That fellunder the purview of the FBI and military intelligence.Over the next two weeks, military and civilians \"flashing curious identification cards when challenged byguards\" said they were with project so and so.\" The Armed Forces Special Weapons Project at Sandia Basedescended on Roswell from \"all over the country.\" [ Stanton Friedman and Don Berliner in Crash At Corona© 1992.]An Army Air Force photographer then based at Anacosta Naval Air Station in Washington, D. C., wasinterviewed by Stanton Friedman for the book Crash At Corona. The photographer said that he was told topack his bags and board a B-25 that took another photographer and himself to Roswell.\"We got out there to one of the three crash sites near Corona, and there were a helluva lot ofpeople out there in a closed tent. ...There were four (non-human) bodies I could see when theflash went off. That's all I was photographing, bodies. They were under a canvas and militarypeople would open it up and you'd take a picture, flip out your flashbulb, put another one in,take another picture and give them the film holder and then you went to the next spot. I guessthere were ten or twelve officers. The bodies looked like they were laying on a tarp.\" [Ibid.]The U. S. Army first reported the crash to be a flying disc. But within a few hours, a counter-story emerged"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"that the crash was nothing more than a weather balloon. On July 8, 1947, General Ramey, Commander of the8th Air Force, said that there had been a big misunderstanding and that the balloon and its radar target werepart of an upper atmosphere research program. There was no mystery because what rancher Mack Brazel hadfound was only the balloon and its reflector. [ Front Page, The New York Times, July 9, 1947.]By September 1994, while Peculiar Phenomenon was being researched and interviews were conducted in thefield, the official story had changed again after nearly half a century. The Air Force explained that it was not aweather balloon. It was a \"secret balloon\" related to Project Mogul, an early attempt to develop technology tospy on Russian nuclear testing activity. After forty-seven years, the U.S. Air Force officially admitted that the\"weather balloon story\" was actually a cover story for a TOP SECRET Atomic Energy Commission project. Ibelieve that the Air Force changed its official line, motivated by what one former President termed \"thelimited hang out approach.\" It was in a curious statement made on July 10, 1947, three days after recoveryoperations began at Corona. An Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) spokesman in Washington, D. C., wasquoted in a Las Cruces Sun-News article headlined: \"Don't Make Early Plans to Visit the A-bomb Test Site.\"The AEC spokesman said:\"It certainly will be months, and it might be years, before visitors are allowed at the spot wherethe first atom bomb was exploded. The blast, which depressed a crater in the earth andliquefied the top sands, took place two years ago. But it is still a forbidden zone to the public.'People are not allowed there (an AEC official said). We are making continuous studies at thecrater of the cumulative effects of radiation.' ...A careful watch is kept on the health of the menwho work there to safeguard them from over-exposure.\"Front P age, Las Cruces Sun-News, July 10, 1947.The announcement was evidently directed at residents of southern New Mexico and cautioned them not to goto the Trinity Site. The statement appears to explain why AEC personnel in radiation suits and militaryconvoys with Army and Navy personnel might be seen on Highway 380, which is the primary east-west accessto both the San Antonio and Corona flying disc crash sites. Five days after that announcement, a P-80 landedon the same highway forty-five miles east of the Trinity site turn off. Three days later, the P-80 crashed as itattempted to take off from the highway.On July 11, four days after recovery operations began at Corona, the FBI announced that it would hold aspecial conference for all police and sheriff's officers in Lincoln, Chavez, Otero and a portion of GuadalupeCounty of south-central New Mexico. Is it surprising that this geographic area is the same area where militaryrecovery operations were underway related to several flying discs? The meeting was scheduled for 7 p.m. onthe evening of July 21, 1947, in the District Court Room of the Lincoln County Courthouse in Carrizozo. Theconference addressed the topic of \"coordination in law enforcement\" by Mr. R. C. Suran, Special Agent incharge, El Paso region, Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mr Suran was quoted as saying: \"These conferenceshave become increasingly important due to their value in enabling law enforcement officers to become betteracquainted with each other, thereby increasing mutual cooperation.\" [ Front Page, Lincoln County News, July11, 1947.]"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Front Page, Lincoln County News/Carrizozo Outlook, Friday, July 11, 1947.Brig. General Montague (MJ-11) was assigned to command the AFSWP at Sandia Base on July 12. Hisprimary responsibility to guard and protect U. S. nuclear weapons, probably using German Wasserfallsurface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft artillery. He was given three days to report for duty. It remains unclearwhat relationship General Montague had w ith General Leslie Groves, who had been the Commanding Generalthroughout the entire history of the Manhattan Project and also carried the title of Commander of Sandia Base.[ Front Page, El Paso Times, July 12, 1947.] General Groves wasn't replaced until February 1948. WhenGeneral Groves was replace Major General Kenneth Nichols is reported to replace him. Yet at the same time,Gen. Montague is also reported to be Commander of Sandia Base. It should be mentioned that a one stargeneral's staff car was reported at both the Corona and San Agustin Plains disc crash sites. [ Sandia NationalLaboratories © Furman.]Col. Harold Turner was replaced by the U. S. Army as Commander of WSPG on July 15, 1947. Brig. GeneralBlackmore, a general staff officer of U. S. Army Ordnance, assumed command. Col. Turner was relieved ofcommand responsibilities at the Proving Ground a week and a day after his troops began picking up flying discdebris at Corona. The reader by now knows the \"official\" 1994 version of the U. S. Air Force position on theRoswell Incident was that it was a \"secret nuclear detection balloon.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Front P age, Las Cruces Citizen, July 17, 1947. Carrizozo, NM: Disc Retaliation?Carrizozo, New Mexico, was between the disc crash site near Corona (Landing Zone 1, or LZ 1)and the disc crash near the Trinity Test Site west of Oscura P eak (LZ 2). The third crash site was east of Alamogordo.The three crash sites, or \"Landing Zones,\" were dated July 4-6, 1947, and described in the 1952 \"Majestic-121st Annual Report\" at www.majesticdocuments.com. Graphic © 1994 by Andrew Kissner.On Tuesday, July 15, 1947, a P-80 Shooting Star jet fighter landed on a remote, straight stretch of Highway380, twenty-five miles south of the Corona flying disc crash site at the small community of Carrizozo just northof the northeastern corner of WSPG. This P-80 was similar to other aircraft that had standing orders at MurocField, California, to intercept any flying disc that might be sighted there, This Shooting Star landed nearCarrizozo the same time as the U. S. Army and Navy were packing up debris from the Corona and White Sands"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"disc crashes and loaded four alien bodies onto Army B-29s and C-54 transports. [ Las Cruces Sun-News, July20, 1947; Crash At Corona © Berliner and Friedman.]The P-80 waited at Carrizozo. Its mission, although secret to this day, was to provide air cover for therecovery operation. This was necessary in the event that another flying disc appeared and attempted to impedeelements of the recovery T-Force. Perhaps a disc would attempt to retrieve the bodies of the crashed disc'sdead crew members.The fighter was not based at Alamogordo Air Field. Rather, it was based at March Field, California. Usingaircraft based at a distance from the site of a possible engagement is a further security precaution. Thisprevents discussion between pilots once back at base who can compare notes and experiences with local newsstories and subsequent gossip. The T-Force's air security assignment was itself compartmentalized.The P-80 waited for two and a half days in Carrizozo. It sat next to Highway 380, was refueled by a U. S.Army tank truck driven to Carrizozo from Ft. Bliss, not Alamogordo Army Air Field which was closer by 65mi l e s . The El Paso Times quoted U. S. Army sources that the plane had refueled at the Carrizozo airport. Andyet, in 1995, that small airport still does not offer jet fuel. The cover story was that the fighter \"ran low onfuel\" in a rain storm. On Thursday night, military mechanics called for a battery charger that was airlifted tothe site by a U. S. Army air transport - again not from Alamogordo Army Air Field, but from Ft. Bliss, home ofthe anti-aircraft artillery school. [ Las Cruces Sun-News, July 20, 1947.]It should be understood by the reader that Carrizozo airport in 1947 was an unimproved dirt strip. Over fourdays at least two C-47 transports, another \"Army transport\" and a P-80 all used either the airport runway orHighway 380 as a makeshift landing strip. All of this activity was less than 25 miles from the \"Roswell\" flyingdisc crash site southeast of Corona.Reporters quoted U. S. Army sources for the Las Cruces Sun-News and the El Paso Times in which they weretold that the P-80 had made a forced landing at Carrizozo on a cross country flight between March Field,California, and Ft. Worth, Texas. The local Lincoln County News, however, based on interviews with Armypersonnel on the scene, reported that the plane had been on a flight between March Field and Biggs Army AirField in El Paso. No explanation was given about why the P-80 was 120 miles north and further east than itsintended destination. Why the official deception?On the afternoon of July 18, 1947, the waiting was over. As Capt. Floyd G. Soule of Riverside, California,brought his fighter back onto the center of the road and evenly applied power to his General Electric J-33engine to develop maximum thrust engineered to drive his plane to 620 mph and released his parking brake,everything was fine. As he past stall speed and accelerated to 120 mph and pulled back on the stick, the planelifted off the roadway to an altitude of 100 feet. But it would gain no more altitude. Conditions radicallychanged and it was too late. The fighter veered violently to the right, nose down. An eyewitness reported thatthe airplane was flying very fast and without any observable or explainable cause, simply rolled over andcrashed. [ Author interview, September 6, 1994.]That eyewitness description is at odds with all published reports that indicated that either the plane did not getoff the ground, or if it did, perhaps rose only several feet. The official cause of the crash was listed as \"bumpsor pot holes in the roadway\" that precluded the plane from lifting off the ground. In reality, it was flying veryfast at 100 or more feet when it rolled over.The P-80 was out of control and flew directly into the Monte Vista gas station on the southwest corner of StateRoute 54 and Highway 380. The airplane and the gas station exploded in a fireball simultaneously. Capt.Soule was killed instantly. It also killed Joe Hunter Drake, 25, of Carrizozo, and critically injured GlennDavis, his six-year-old nephew from Ancho, New Mexico. Also injured were Mrs. Pick Warden of Capitan,New Mexico, and Mr. Joe Phillips, 28, of Carrizozo. Besides the P-80 and the gas station, the resultingexplosions and fire destroyed three trucks and a car. Mrs. Warden's injuries were caused when a panickedtruck driver ran over her.At 5:30 p.m. on July 18, 1947, more than one U. S. Army C-47 transport with medical personnel fromAlamogordo left Carrizozo. The injured were transported to William Beaumont Army Hospital in El Paso.[ Las Cruces Sun News, July 20 and 24, 1947; El Paso Times, July 19 and 21, 1947.] The Lincoln CountyNews said the C-47s had been called in to \"the declared emergency\" and that \"when they (C-47s) becameavailable, they transported the dead and injured to Ft. Bliss.\"No one to this day has associated this tragedy with the recovery operation of a flying disc 25 miles north ofCarrizozo at the same time. For a P-80 jet, that distance could be covered in 30 seconds. It's not surprising thatan association was not made because oddly, only three newspapers reported about the fiery explosion. TheUSAF never acknowledged any airplane accidents near the disc crash sites around the time of the Roswellincidents. The USAF did report loosing five aircraft in New Mexico during July 1947. The P-80 explosion inCarrizozo is mentioned by the Air Force as only having occurred somewhere in New Mexico. The Air Forcereported four other aircraft losses during July, which this author was not able to find in any publishednews source from 1947.
