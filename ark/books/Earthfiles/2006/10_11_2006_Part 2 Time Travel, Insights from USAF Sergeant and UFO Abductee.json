I'm notreferring right now to the time travelers from Earth's futurethat are here also.\" - Abductee Linda Porter Linda Porter with her daughter, Lisa, on December 25, 1995.October 11, 2006 Albuquerque, New Mexico - The first week of March 1991, Ireceived a brown, legal-sized envelope by Certified Mail postmarked February 28, 1991,from Porterville, California. The envelope contained an audiocassette, letter and drawingsfrom a woman named Linda Porter.The day I received the package, I took her audiocassette to play in the car on errands. Herclear and articulate voice impressed me. Linda Porter was an educated person struggling tounderstand a life full of phenomena that did not fit acceptable categories of reality. Shehad decided it was important to reach me after hearing a conference presentation I hadgiven in California concerning eyewitness testimony about non-human intelligencesinteracting with our planet. She was concerned about her vulnerability as a person caughtup in the human abduction syndrome and was frightened about the United Statesgovernment's policy of suppressing the alien presence.Her letter began, \"We (abductees) are caught in the middle of a series of ongoing eventsthat will one day prove to be historically significant to the future of the Earth.Unfortunately, because of our continuing, non-voluntary interactions with these beings, wehave, in a sense, become victims of both sides of the phenomena."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"\"On the one hand, we are used by the aliens for their own purposes, whatever thosepurposes may be. On the other, if we speak out, we risk ridicule from the public, and insome cases, possible harassment and/or intimidation by government and militarypersonnel.\" \"The people who live on the Earth, those who will survive the (destructive) changes (tocome), will be evolving into a new species of being. ... I'm not referring right now to thetime travelers from Earth's future that are here also. That was something that wasnecessary because Earth governments got hold of a dangerous technology that greatlyaltered Earth's future for the worse. Remember the mistake that was made that I told youabout awhile back. Some type of technology fell into the wrong hands and the (future)travelers were sent back in time to change that. Don't know if it has been changed. At leastnot yet. But that was an entire side-bar to evolution that was never meant to happen.\" Linda Porter was the first of half a dozen people in the human abduction syndrome I metmeet and interviewed who described human body cloning and \"soul transfers\" under thecontrol of non-human entities. (See more information and drawings in my book, Glimpsesof Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness.)She told me that grey beings demonstrated the cloning and soul transfer process before itwas also done to Linda because her heart was failing. The person she watched was a manwho died on a table in the presence of a grey entity. From the man's upper torso and heademerged a golden-yellow-orange light, elongated in the air as it moved across the roominto a lighted tube that contained a cloned body of the man about a decade younger. Lindaunderstood there was a confusing problem about Earth body containers, souls, otherdimensions and altered time lines.Linda Porter: \"I was told that the (resurrected) cloned man would berelocated elsewhere (maybe Australia) and would continue on with his life.(Linda thought it was vital to the non-human entities that the man's soulcontinue functioning longer inside the same kind of \"container\" that his older,sick body had been.) Part of the reason they take tissue samples fromabductees when they are quite young is to have this tissue in reserve in case anew body (for abductee) becomes necessary later on.Linda Porter's depiction of dying man's \"soul.\" lifting out of his upper torso"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"and floating across the room to enter the sick man's clone at ayounger age. Drawing © 1991 by Linda Porter.\"New bodies can be stored indefinitely. The containers in the sketch with thethree people in the tubes are storage containers. The containers in both newsketches I sent you are 'activation' containers. They have a light in the top thatmust be on the person for (unknown) amount of hours before a body can beactivated - if a body has been in storage. If newly made, it does not need light.In the sketch with the three people in the tubes, the body on the far right wasthe (younger) one given to the (dying) man.Linda Porter said she was taken by a \"grey scientist\" to a room where threepeople were in tubes. She felt the people were alive, but in a state of suspendedanimation, and that the man on far right was the younger clone activated by a\"soul transfer\" from his previous older body (dying man). Drawing ©1991 by Linda Porter.\"I got the impression, the aliens do not like to do this soul transfer very often.Actually, I got the feeling the aliens are not supposed to be doing this at all.\"But they seemed to be backed into a corner and have no other recourse.They also seem to be trying to hide all this from some 'higher' form of life -whatever the 'authority' is that prohibits this soul transfer also prohibits themfrom interfering on this planet. (?) Whoever it is, is much higher evolved thanthey are and wields a great deal of power over many, many other realms ofexistence.\"There is much, much more to existence than we could ever begin tounderstand. Much of what we have been taught regarding the physicaluniverse and the laws that govern it is wrong.\"This creature's civilization communicates difficult concepts via the use ofsymbols that radiate emotion. They use this form to get concepts across withtheir exact true meanings intact. No misinterpretations can occur this way.\"The symbols are not mathematical ones, but appear as 3-dimensionalholographic pictures that resemble abstract sculptures. The emotional aspect isrelayed via carrier waves that resemble sound waves, but are not part of thehuman sound spectrum. These waves can be felt, but not heard. If thecreatures want to clear a certain area of humans, they can 'broadcast' thiscarrier wave over the area at a certain frequency and it will create intense fearin people, causing them to flee the area. It does not cause any harm, so theysay. [ Howe's Note: Most humans cannot hear frequencies below 125 hertz, orabove 10,000 hertz.]\"The universe is built on sound patterns, which is why so many differentworlds/dimensions can exist in the same space. Each is on a different"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"frequency. Disrupt a world/dimension to the point that you destroy the carrierwave it exists on and you have created a 'hole' in existence that cannotsupport the dimension above or below it. Each frequency, besides maintainingits own world/dimension, also supports - or holds in place - the one above itand below it. Everything is interdependent!\"There are countless worlds/dimensions occupying the same space withoutbeing aware of one another because of having their own individual octaves.This octave/frequency holds the world/dimension in place and causes it toexist safely without interfering with (or even being aware of) other worldsaround it. This frequency acts as a buffer zone to keep everything in its place.Do anything to disrupt it and you begin a collapse that starts a deadly chainreaction. If the density of this collapse reaches a certain weight, space/timeitself begins to collapse.\"Whatever the experiment is that our government is involved with in outerspace, (if successful) it will change the density of matter to such an extent thatthe chain reaction started will not be able to be stopped by anybody in anyworld/dimension!\"There are literally hundreds of different alien life forms here trying to stopwhat is happening as it is putting their own worlds at risk. Some, as I hadmentioned in earlier letters, are not supposed to be interfering, but are doingso anyway. What they are all trying to do is stop the 'ripple effect' that willemanate outward from Earth should this (government) experiment succeed.\"With all their technology, Linda, why don't the aliens - or their superiors -just walk in and stop the whole thing themselves? Why do they need usabductees to speak for them? Something just doesn't make any sense. Iwonder if we are being lied to, used for some purpose to put over ideas theywant us to believe? If there is an experiment, maybe if it succeeds, it will putus in competition with the aliens for something they don't want to share.Maybe they're trying to 'scare' us out of 'their' neighborhood.\"More Information:For further information about time travel, UFOs and human abductees, please see reportsbelow in the Earthfiles Archives and my books, An Alien Harvest; the 2-volume bookGlimpses of Other Realities; and Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles in the EarthfilesShop.• 09/29/2006 -- Manipulation of Time and Matter by Non-Humans: The Experiences of Jim Sparks• 08/13/2006 -- Part 1: Three Crop Formations Near Uffington White Horse• 03/25/2005 -- Glow of Distant Worlds Seen For First Time• 11/03/2004 -- Gen.
