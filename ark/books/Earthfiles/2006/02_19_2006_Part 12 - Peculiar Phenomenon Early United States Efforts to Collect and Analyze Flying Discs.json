Andrew KissnerReturn to Part 1Increased Plane Crashesand the National Reaction On June 4, 1947, the same day President Truman requested an extension of the SecondWar Powers Act from Congress, a curious announcement appeared in the June 4, 1947, ElPaso Times, about 300 cadets who had graduated from the National Military Academy atWest Point and would arrive in El Paso in ten transport planes to watch nine B-29 bombersdrop 500 pound bombs reportedly south and east of the main post area of WSPG. Thegraduates would also have the opportunity to watch Ft. Bliss Antiaircraft Artillerydemonstrate antiaircraft weapons and observe U. S. Army Ordnance launch a WACCorporal missile. The announcement was made five days later Col. Turner departed forWashington, D. C., following the \"Juarez V-2 Incident.\" Using military non-combatants as cover for covert military activity is not new. This isespecially necessary when the military activity will be observable to the public or apotential adversary. Explanations are needed for the press and public when large numbersof antiaircraft artillery are moved, when artillery is deployed to unusual locations, whenbombing an area in full view or even in hearing range of a population, or when missiles arelaunched. West Point cadets entering military service for much of their lives might be theperfect viewing audience to demonstrate attack on a new adversary. The Eighth Air Force based at Davis-Monthan Field in Tucson would supply the B-29s ofthe 43rd Bombing Group for the demonstration at \"Orogrande Bombing Range.\" Thecadets on a tour of U. S. Army installations around the U. S. arrived at Biggs Army Airfieldfrom Wright Field, Ohio. Later renamed Wright-Patterson AFB, this base vital to theAmerican military was home of General Nathan Twining (MJ-4) and the Armed Forces AirMaterial Command where the cadets \"had the opportunity to see the Army Air Forceslaboratories there.\" [ Ibid.] The cadet announcement was the first of two publiclyannounced live bombing exercises in the White Sands region over the next five weeks. After \"Juarez Incident,\"Plane Crashes All Over the World In that same week after the May 29, 1947, \"peculiar phenomenon and Juarez rocketcrash,\" airplanes began to crash all over the world. The night of May 29, a four-engineC-54 Army courier plane with 42 persons on board crashed in mountains southwest ofTokyo. The same night, a B-29 bomber crashed and burned shortly after taking off fromLadd Field in Fairbanks, Alaska. The same day, an Icelandic Airways plane with 25persons aboard was reported missing on a flight from Reykjavik to Kureyri."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Front Page, The New York Times, May 30, 1947.On June 2, 1947, Lieut.

[ Ibid.]On June 3, a \"twin engine Army patrol plane\" crashed two hundred feet short of the end ofthe runway at San Bernardino, California, when it \"miscalculated its altitude on landing\"and killed four and injured one.

Hesuggested that only 1,000 men were assigned to this area and that the new threats \"ofplanes and the long range robot looms over every battlefield.\" [ The New York Times, June8, 1947.]Evidently when Baldwin was in southern New Mexico or west Texas, he had heard areliable story concerning the possibility that \"long range robots\" would be employed asoffensive weapons in future wars.On June 8, a 14-year-old swimming in a gravel pit in Owosso, Michigan, was decapitatedwhen the propeller blade of a \"low flying\" airplane stuck him.

Turner announced that a V-2 test scheduled to be conducted onThursday, June 12, was postponed and that all future V-2 flights would be suspended untilsuch time as \"safety devices\" could be installed to prevent a recurrence of May 29's flightinto Juarez, Mexico. This announcement was made five days after all C-54 transports weregrounded by the U. S. Army Air Transport Command. [ Las Cruces Sun-News, June 6 and11, 1947.]Front Page, Las Cruces Sun-News, June 11, 1947.Previously, one ground station and one individual was responsible for determining if a V-2rocket was flying off course. It was changed to two more flight safety officers as well astwo other ground stations would watch for a rocket malfunction and terminate the flight ifa problem developed. No mention was made by Col. Turner that the safety device on theMay 15, 1947, V-2 (26th launch) worked perfectly. Col. Turner indicated that the next V-2launch would probably be on July 3, 1947.
