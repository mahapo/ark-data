Myers Beach, Florida, 1999.September 29, 2006 Las Vegas, Nevada - Eleven years ago at a conference about thehuman abduction syndrome, one of the participants was a man named Jim Sparks, bornJim Sparacino to his Italian parents fifty-two years ago on November 15, 1954.Unlike many abductees who experience loss of consciousness and missing time, Jim’sinteractions with what he calls ‘aliens’ have been mostly conscious. Even back in 1995,Jim Sparks made a clear distinction between what he described as “small, grey, droneworker types” versus “taller, true aliens, or supervisors.” Jim explained that when he was thirty-four years old in 1988, he was happily married andhad thriving real-estate work in both Texas and North Carolina. Then suddenly, beingsfrom other worlds entered his life and he thought he was losing his mind. Jim Sparks hadinteractions with two different types: one category was the grey-skinned, large dark eyes,that apparently come in many varieties, including small androids that do work for taller,very intelligent controllers.From 1988 into the 1990s, Jim was schooled by the Greys in front of computers and3-dimensional projections. Jim was forced to learn the alien symbols and numbers.Eventually, Jim says he was also contacted by alleged U. S. government intelligenceoperatives who wanted to know about the alien symbols and numbers.Jim also had a conscious, face-to-face encounter with several tall, reptilian-skinnedhumanoids. Jim says those reptilians warned that the Earth’s environment is facing a crisisand that the planet must be saved, whether humans survive or not.Now Jim Sparks has put his eighteen years of interactions with non-humans into a newbook entitled THE KEEPERS: Alien Message for the Human Race. Of the manyabductees I’ve interviewed, Jim has always impressed me with his down-to-Earth attitudeand common sense. So, I recommend his new book, which can be ordered from thepublisher on a limited promotional sale now at the toll free number given below.Jim has always stressed that when people see aerial craft jump from one side of the sky to"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the other, or see entities walk through solid walls, or feel a weight go down on their bed,but cannot see what’s making the weight – it’s all advanced technologies.

If you are a time traveler, so to speak, it’s no big deal to you. It’s just anothertechnological apparatus. You can go from Point A in time to Point B in time whenever youwant, almost as simple as using a TV remote control.In fact, from what I can see and experience with these beings, it’s almost mundane andboring to them. It’s not even exciting to travel time. It‘s just something that they do. Sincewe’re stuck in it, time is extremely relevant to us.WHEN YOU SAY FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THE NON-HUMANS ARE EVENBORED BY THE IDEA OF TIME TRAVEL, COULD YOU SHARE YOUR OWNPERSONAL EXPERIENCE ABOUT HOW YOU EVEN LEARNED THAT?I think by a mistake. There was one experience I just can’t get over. I know it will stickwith me the rest of my life, regarding time travel. Before the mistake, I should share thefact that whenever I was ‘abducted’ – I still haven’t found the perfect word for thatexperience yet. I like to use the word 'pulled' because of the sensation. In the alien world,we would do certain tasks that would end and another task began. When the non-humansdetermined it was time to end, or for me to go back, a week could have gone by, a monthcould have gone by. Then no matter how long I had been gone, I would find myselfexactly where I left off, as though I had never left, and as if the aliens had never pulledme.When I say a mistake, I had an experience – and bare in mind that 90% of them areconscious recall right in your face – where I was at home and got pulled in the lateafternoon or early evening. I was watching television. I was on the sofa. My hand was onmy head and my elbow was on the sofa. I was lying sideways watching TV.I had gotten up and walked over to get something to eat and drink to snack on from therefrigerator. So, I had to walk by an island in the kitchen and make a sharp right turn to getinto the kitchen to get into the refrigerator. I got up from the sofa, walked across the livingroom. I have an aquarium, so I looked at my fish for a few seconds. Then I opened up therefrigerator door, grabbed a soda, drank it. Got something to eat. Shut the door and walked"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"back around the aquarium in the living room and back to the sofa. And then I got pulled. Iwas not expecting it.I had a two-hour experience. This was the first time manipulation where it was firsthand inmy face and it just astounded me. Because what happened was: I had gone through theabduction experience for the two-hour period. When I came back, I came backapproximately a minute or two minutes before I originally left, meaning that I foundmyself back on the sofa. But like I was in two places at once, I could see myself get upfrom the sofa, walk around the aquarium like I did earlier and into the kitchen. I just satthere with my mouth shut in shock and didn’t make a sound. I could hear my footsteps. Icould hear myself going into the kitchen. This other me watched from the sofa and heardthe refrigerator door open, saw a light go on in the refrigerator, heard the sounds of medrinking the soda. I heard and saw the whole scene! Then I watched myself come backfrom the kitchen. This is not an out of body experience because let me set a foundationhere.All this stuff is technology. I’ve stuck to the logic of technology. I am not letting myselfdrift to the left or right on that issue. When I saw myself walking back to the sofa, I justsaid, ‘Well, here comes me and what is ‘me’ going to do when it sees me now?’ But that‘me’ did not even see me and as it got closer, it started fading and disappeared.So, I saw something in solid real life - myself - back a minute or two before I left! Invisibility TechnologyAnother area that astounds me is an invisibility factor there. They have the ability to beinvisible. Again, I just look at these things as technology, nothing more than that. I’m notgoing to get spooked by it. I’m just going to witness it and see if I can figure it out. I’m nota technician or a scientist. But I’m going to take as much of a science approach as I can.They just create some kind of electrical field and anything within that field, the laws ofphysics don’t apply as we understand them. That’s why sometimes you can see them aswhole or other times you see them look faded. Or we see them walk through walls. Arethey really walking through walls? Or are they displacing matter that is the wall in thefield? They literally are going through solid matter.FROM A TECHNOLOGY POINT OF VIEW, IT SOUNDS AS IF THE NON-HUMANSCAN DEFLECT PHOTONS, WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM INSTANTLY INVISIBLE.AND THAT THEY ALSO HAVE SOME KIND OF CONTROL AND MANIPULATIONAT THE ATOMIC OR MOLECULAR LEVEL?Their technology is so sophisticated – I’ll address one level. Again, it’s the invisibility thingagain. They can toy with the mind. Remember, a perfect example would be if you arewalking along the sidewalk and you see a red ant pile. Some how with technology, let's saywe manage to communicate with one of the ants.Our mind is thinking a million miles an hour and this ant is just looking up and saying,‘Wow, for the first time I’m seeing a human face.’ How can you tell that ant what a carpayment is? It does not even understand what anything is in our big world. So, relativelyspeaking, when I say toy with our minds, the E. T.s understand the basic humanday-to-day stimuli and visuals. In other words, if you are in your car and driving down thehighway – you’re looking at signs, you’re looking at the other cars, you might see a flockof birds fly by, all the natural things that we do.But what the E. T.s do is take the natural things and manipulate them, for example, into aflock of birds. You think it’s a flock of birds, because the non-humans will transmit anenergy into your mind and work with the chemicals in your mind and the electrical systemin our body and brain. So, you think you are seeing a flock of birds and so does everybodyelse on the highway. Actually, it could be a formation of alien ships. So, they aretransmitting something that affects human minds. Screen MemoriesI UNDERSTAND THIS WHOLE IDEA OF A SCREEN MEMORY THAT HAS BEENDISCUSSED IN THE ABDUCTION LITERATURE SINCE THE 1970S BY LEOSPRINKLE, BUDD HOPKINS, JOHN MACK AND OTHERS. THE SCREENMEMORIES HAVE BEEN THINGS LIKE A DEER, OR AN OWL, OR BIRDS -NON-HUMAN MANIPULATION THAT CREATES DISGUISES."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Absolutely. Something that you would just see every day and not give it a second thought!The reason I spot these things from time to time is that I’ve had so much exposure over thelast eighteen years to E. T. technology and how they screen image and how they work.I’ve been adamant about not being friendly with them and just observing and having aframe of reference where I can understand and try to keep it as logical and scientific aspossible – even though in the early years, it was pretty terrorizing.Their trickery - it’s so good! It’s like a chameleon. A chameleon can blend into thescenery. Or like an octopus that can do that at the bottom of the sea. They can look likethe sea floor and the other fish don’t notice them. The E. T.s are such masters at this. Theyare absolute masters! One of their ships can be a car in your parking lot and you just don’tgive it a second thought. Your brain just sees a car and goes on. It doesn’t even say theword ‘car’ in your mind. You’ve got to remember what we are dealing with. We aredealing with beings that have the capacity to retain and assimilate more data and processmore data than we can. They’ve been around longer. They can think faster.IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY CAN TAKE ATOMS AND MOLECULES ANDMANIPULATE THEM ANY WAY THEY WANT TO, TO LOOK LIKE ANYTHINGTHEY WANT US TO SEE. IT REMINDS ME OF A DEPUTY THEY EVEN SAW AGLOWING RED SQUARE IN A GROVE OF TREES WHERE THEY WEREINVESTIGATING ANIMAL MUTILATIONS AND THE NEXT MORNING. THEREWERE THEIR TIRE TRACKS WHERE THEY HAD STOPPED THE NIGHT BEFORE.THE GROVE OF TREES THAT HAD THE RED, GLOWING SQUARE IN IT DID NOTEVEN EXIST. EVEN THE TREES HAD BEEN SOME KIND OF SCREEN MEMORY.Exactly. But you’re dealing with different technologies. It’s almost like having a universalremote control. You’ve got the remote control that creates invisibility. You’ve got theremote control that controls the camouflage techniques. You’ve got the remote controlbutton that can create a field. Another that can travel through time. Projecting Percentages of Matter -From Other Dimensions?It’s like an electrical field, for lack of a better definition. I’m not a scientist. But sometimesthere is even a humming sound associated with it that I pick up. They create a field andthey can manipulate not so much, from what I can tell – yeah, you’ll see things that theywant you to see and they can manipulate matter in that way. What really intrigues me isthe E. T.s can be 5% to 10% in this dimension on this physical plane while the rest is inanother dimension. In other words, let’s say you are in your living room and you seesomething that looks like an apparition or ghost that you can kind of see through it.Well, they might be only 2 to 3% in our dimension and they are 98% or 97% solid in someother dimension. There are dimensions out there like layers of an onion, by the thousands,in a sense that they squeeze into. But they don’t really. The E. T.s molecularly change thevibration of something so they can be in another dimension and solid, but be projectedhere in only 5%. That’s when they are doing research work here and they don’t have tohandle physical items or objects in our dimension or plane.I see sometimes they will be 40%, or 50% in our dimension if they need to move solidobjects here. But, their self-defense is to disappear. So, if you charge at them, they aregone. Or if you charge at them by running at them in an attack or anything of that nature,you can put your hand right through them.With their science, I’ve seen them take an object, for example – something as simple as acan of soda pop. They can take one can of soda pop and make two cans of soda pop fromit. Each can has 50% of the molecular structure and weight divided evenly. Then they cando it in quarters. Then they can do it in eighths. Then they can break it down intothousandths. Then the next thing you know, you are looking through those cans.That’s what the E. T.s do with their technology – push a button and you have time travel.Push another button, you have invisibility. It’s not like each individual E. T. is a high techwizard. They are just like any other person who is using a tool.DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE NOW IN 2006 WHERE THE REAL ORIGIN IS FOR THEGREYS?Well, when we say greys – you have working beings, which in my experience are createdjust for that purpose. They are part biological, they are part robotic. These things are usedas a tool for labor, for tasks, even if it’s technical. I think a lot of the beings are mistakentools, or biological working beings, are mistaken as extraterrestrials. My experience"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"primarily has been in what you would call greys and some referred to as reptilian,snake-like, lizard-like beings. They all seem to have these little workers as a tool. Whenyou ask, ‘Where are they from?’ Could it be from working in another dimension? Could itbe from another time? From another place? Can it be from another star? Can it be a race ofE. T.s that are not from the two I just mentioned? But the E. T.s will have the little workerbeings with them, too?When you take in consideration that traveling time means nothing and invisibility isnothing. Getting from point A to point B is nothing. What I have learned about them isthey are extreme masters of deception, meaning that almost anything we can come up with– and I’m not trying to belittle our scientists or agencies that are studying this stuff – the E.T.s can lead them to believe, as you could an ant, anything they are using.JIM, WHAT NOW IN 2006 DO YOU IN YOUR HEART THINK THE GREYS ANDWHOEVER THEIR INTELLIGENT CONTROLLERS ARE, WHAT DO THEY WANT?What I’ve come to in the last 18 years, we’re about ½% of what they are about and 99.5%is something else that we don’t have a clue what they are doing. What we are seeing is that½% in our face from time to time.”The Keepers: An Alien Message for the Human Race© 2006 by Jim Sparks, published by Wild Flower Press.ISBN is: 1-930724-05-5Jim’s new book can be ordered from the publisher on a limited promotional sale for$19.00 through October 1, 2006, at this toll free phone number: 800-366-0264.Beginning Monday, October 2, 2006, the normal price will be: $24.00 at 800-366-0264.More Information:For further information about the human abduction syndrome, please see reports below inthe Earthfiles Archives.• 06/13/2006 -- Mysterious Triangle-Shaped Welts and Bruises• 06/08/2006 -- Part 2: Unexplained Phenomenon of Sudden Human-to-Reptile \"Replacement\"• 06/02/2006 -- Part 1: Unexplained Phenomenon of Sudden Human-to-Reptile \"Replacement• 05/12/2006 -- An Extraterrestrial School for Humans (Jim Sparks)• 05/05/2006 -- Military Man's Description of EBE Telepathic Download• 04/28/2006 -- Modern Warfare Applied to Extra-Terrestrial Invasion• 03/02/2006 -- Missing Time Abduction Before Birth• 01/27/2006 -- Part 2: Navy Physicist and USAF Geophysicist Discuss UFOs and ETs• 12/07/2005 -- Zeta Reticuli I and II - Binary Home of Extraterrestrial Biological Entities?• 12/02/2005 -- Abduction by Grey ETs in Huge, Black Triangle• 10/22/2005 -- A Lifting Beam Technology in Colorado Human Abduction• 10/07/2005 -- Part 1: Beam Technology Lifted Body Near Ft.
