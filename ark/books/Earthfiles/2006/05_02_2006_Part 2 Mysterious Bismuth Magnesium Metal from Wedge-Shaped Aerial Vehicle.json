Each of six pieces received were \"formed\"with a curvature that tapered, as shown to the right in photo magnification above. Return to Part 1May 2 , 2006 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Coast to Coast AM and Dreamland radio host, Art Bell, calledme and said there were half a dozen pieces about two inches long, an inch wide and about a quarter-inch thick.One side was dark and the other side was a shiny silver. I contacted the university professor who agreed to analyze the new material and Bell shipped two fragments tohim, keeping the other four in a safe deposit box. The professor's first step was to photograph the metal pieces as they arrived at his laboratory. He placed thedark side of one piece on the left and silver side of the other on the right, both next to a quarter coin that isabout an inch in diameter for size comparison.

On June 8, 1996, the professor released his first report about the material. He had examined a cut and polishedcross-section with the scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). He stated:\"Each sample had a 'silvery,' shiny side with a rough (granular) appearance. The other side wasbl acki sh-gray. Looki ng at the sampl es edge-on, numerous l ayers can be seen. The sampl es w erehard but brittle, and a few small pieces could be broken off using a small hand vice and manualpressure. \"Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) revealed that the shiny side contained more than 95%magnesium (Mg) and a small amount (2-3%) of zinc (Zn). The dark side contained a significantamount of bismuth (Bi ). \"...the material appears to represent layers ... consisting mainly of magnesium and a smallamount of zi nc separated by thin l ayers contai ni ng a hi gh bismuth content.\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Above : Magnesium (Mg) spike and small amount of zinc (ZN) in EDS analysis of silver layer.Below: Bismuth spike in EDS analysis of black layer. Spectra by university professor.The SEM was set in a \"back-scattering\" configuration so that heavier elements show up brighter. Therefore, thedark bismuth appears as thin white lines and the much lighter magnesium/zinc shows as darker shades of gray.The professor measured the layers and found that the thin, wavy lines of bismuth varied from one to fourmicrons, about half the diameter of a human blood cell, and the magnesium/zinc varied from one hundred totwo hundred microns in thickness. One scientist thought the waviness in the metal layers might be a fractalwave pattern superimposed deliberately during the process of layering the metals together. If so, the metalmight resonate with a specific electromagnetic frequency. Or, the waviness might be the result of heat absorbedin the metal's production or function.

P hotograph © 1996 by professor. Later the professor did more refined analysis with Wavelength Dispersive Spectroscopy (WDS) and said:\"The material corresponds to layers of Bi and Mg/Zn with the weight percent of the Zn varyingslightly from about 2.4% to 2.9% between Bi layers. No Zirconium (Zr) could be detected withthe Mg/Zn area which is frequently found in magnesium/zinc alloys.\"In summary, the metal fragments allegedly from the \"central underside of a wedge-shaped\" spacecraft found inNew Mexico have about twenty-five alternating layers. The bismuth layers average one to four microns and themagnesium/zinc layers average 100 to 200 microns. Bismuth is a hard, brittle metallic element that is greyish-white with a tinge of red. That pink color in thestomach medicine, Pepto-Bismal, comes from a bismuth ingredient. A pure, man-made bismuth crystal. P hotograph © 1996 by Linda Moulton Howe. Bismuth's atomic number on the Periodic Table of Elements is 83. Lead is 82, so bismuth is heavier than lead.Bismuth is frequently found in ores of tin, lead, copper and cobalt. Bismuth is not attacked by hydrochloricacid, and only slightly by hot sulfuric acid. But the element is rapidly dissolved by either dilute or concentratednitric acid. Further, the Guide to Uncommon Metals says, \"Bismuth is one of the few metals that expands when cooled,like water does when it turns to ice, and that makes bismuth valuable for detailed metal castings. Bismuth alsohas a low melting point, but its thermal conductivity is lower than that of perhaps every other metal with theexception of mercury, and its electrical resistance is high. A modern use is as a coolant for nuclear powerreactors.\" Bismuth is the most diamagnetic of the elements - meaning it resists penetration by magnetic fields morestrongly than any other element. Magnetic field lines tend to be displaced around bismuth, rather than passingthrough it. Bismuth also has the greatest Hall Effect. That means if a voltage is placed on bismuth while themetal is in a magnetic field, a current flow will be induced that is ninety degrees to the voltage. Bismuth is anefficient absorber of infra red energy and researchers are experimenting with bismuth coatings that will convertheat to electricity. Bismuth is also added to metal mixtures in superconducting research. Fifth Letter from \"Grandad\" - July 5, 1996 On July 5, 1996, the fifth and final letter from the South Carolina source added a few more comments about thelayered fragments, supposedly copied verbatim \"from Grandad's journal\":"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"\"Sample extraction radiated light for a full (3) hours.

Secondary examinations at Los Alamos Facility.Footlockers subsequently airlifted by Courier to Wright Field, Ohio.\"In addition to the unfamiliar combination of bismuth and magnesium/zinc, there were questions about theisotope ratios in the magnesium. Isotope refers to the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of eachatom. For example, magnesium on Earth is made up of about eighty percent 24-Magnesium. That means thereare twelve protons and twelve neutrons at the center of each 24-Magnesium atom. The other twenty percent is equally divided between 25-Mg, which has one additional neutron compared to24-Mg, and 26-Mg, which has two additional neutrons compared to 24-Mg. If the layered metal were trulyextraterrestrial in origin, some wondered if anomalies might be detected in those ratios, or percentages, ofisotopes. One such anomaly was reported in 1957 when a metal fragment allegedly from a UFO in Ubatuba, Sau Palo,Brazil, was analyzed by the Brazilian government in laboratory tests. The fragment was found on September14, 1957, after eyewitnesses saw a \"flying disc\" explode into thousands of fiery fragments which fell onto thebeach and sea. The metal tested to be nearly 100% pure magnesium and was 6.7% heavier than ordinary puremagnesium. Former NASA scientist, Paul Hill, calculated that the density anomaly could be explained if themetal were the pure isotope 26-Mg not found naturally on Earth. Supposedly, that Brazil metal no longer existsto test further. (See More Information below.) I learned that an ion microprobe, which could analyze magnesium isotopes, was newly installed at the CarnegieInstitution of Washington, D. C. After discussions with Dr. Erik Hauri in the Department of TerrestrialMagnetism, who agreed to analyze the layered Bi/Mg metal, I drove to washington on July 20, 1996, with a cutand polished slice of the layered material. Dr. Hauri found about 11% more 26-Mg in our mysterious sample,but still not outside terrestrial ranges for magnesium metal.Slice of bismuth and magnesium/zinc layered metal being placed by Erik Hauri, Ph.D.,operator of the ion microprobe, into container for magnesium isotope ratio analysis on July 20, 1996,at Carnegie Institution of Washington, D.

One anomaly was that the bismuth/magnesium layered material emitted more positive ions than the pure"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"magnesium metal being used for standard comparison. Hauri wrote in his report to me:\"The Bi-Mg sample gave count rates of Mg+ ions which were enhanced sixty times more thanin the pure Mg metal standard.\" (Howe's emphasis.)Dr. Hauri suggested three possible reasons for the difference. First, he explained that the zinc might act as acatalyst for Mg ionization. Second, that catalytic process might be enhanced if there were a distinctivearrangement in the Mg crystal structure which related to how the material was originally constructed. Third, ifoxygen were somewhere in the sample, it could enhance Mg ionization. However, Hauri acknowledged thatnone of the ion microprobe spectra showed any oxygen.

The layered metal had about 11% more 26-Mg than magnesium metal standard, but not outsideterrestrial magnesium ranges. Ion microprobe analysis by Erik Hauri, Ph.D., Department of Terrestrial Magnetism, CarnegieInstitution of Washington, D. C., July 20, 1996. One technician in a solar cell manufacturing company thought he could reproduce the layered metal in a vacuumvapor deposition process. After three unsuccessful tries, he slowed down the vacuum process to build onelayer per week. I received the result by mail. There were four layers about the size of a postage stamp. Thesample was mostly white, not alternating silver and black layers. Within a month, the four layers delaminatedfalling apart in a plastic bag along with the bismuth grains that looked like black pepper. I also contacted dozens of people in the scientific and industrial community to see if I could find anyone whohad worked with bismuth and magnesium/zinc layered together in alternating and wavy micron thicknesses.Those inquiries ranged from the Director of Material Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts and the National Science Foundation in Washington, D. C., to metallurgistsat Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, New Mexico and aerospace and exotic metals manufacturers tomilitary labs and intelligence agencies. No one had any knowledge of such layered metal. Speculation about the metal's possible function included resisting or detecting magnetic fields. Anothersuggestion came from a man who claimed to have worked on back-engineering technology retrieved from theSoviet Union and other sources during the Cold War in the 1970s. He said metal made out of bismuth andmagnesium layers came into a lab at Edwards AFB, California, as an \"unknown\" and left as an \"unknown.\" He said later that he learned the material might \"turn into a lifting body\" if placed in a million volt electrostaticfield augmented by an unspecified frequency of a \"Class C RF signal.\" On the radio, I asked for research help. Electrical engineer and optical physicist Travis Taylor, Ph.D., thenworking at the Army's Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, volunteered to try the experiment. But first, heasked his superiors and contacts at the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) if it was all right to work with meon the Bi/Mg metal. Travis told me the DIA officials approved, as long as he kept them informed about whatwe learned. First, I asked Travis if he would do a literature search in scientific and military channels to see if he could findany references to bismuth and magnesium/zinc manufactured in thin, alternating micron layers. After severalweeks, he told me:\"I have basically exhausted every resource that I have ever tried to use in the past from about1940 to now. I have found no reference, even in government research, forbismuth/magnesium-zinc layers. This material didn't just make itself. It had to come fromsomewhere. And that's one of the things about it that excites me - somebody had to build it andno one has reported building it. It's a very high tech piece of material, so if they didn't report it,why did they build it? That's what we do in science. We do some research and then we telleveryone about it. And nobody's told anyone about this material!\"Then he tried 500,000 volts produced by a Van de Graaff generator with the Bi/Mg on a plastic insulator. Thelayered metal at one point moved sideways through the electric field so energetically that it fell off theinsulator. After that, Travis built a Van de Graaff generator big enough to provide 1.2 million volts. He got a"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"magnesium/zinc alloy control that matched the magnesium and zinc percentages, but had no bismuth and did nothave the wavy pattern peculiar to the layered metal. Insulation from the electrostatic field was a thin piece ofpaper suspended above the generator. The layered bismuth/magnesium metal and the control were placed onthe paper. To Travis Taylor's surprise, the Bi/Mg tended again to move sideways in the electrostatic field while thecontrol did not. When a tunable 1 to 20 MHz radio signal was added, the Bi/Mg seemed to have a moreenergetic reaction to back away from the direction of the RF signal when it was tuned to about 7 MHz. Traviswondered if there might be a connection to the nuclear magnetic resonance frequency of bismuth which is about7 MHz, the same as the stimulating RF signal. Nuclear magnetic resonance occurs at the subatomic level undercertain conditions when a substance is placed in an external static magnetic field. Research continued with tests of the metal in static and oscillating magnetic fields by a scientist working on\"electro-gravitic\" research. That scientist had already narrowed his interest to two elements most likely toinfluence gravity: mercury and bismuth. So far, the Bi/Mg was \"dead,\" not moving, in the magnetic fields tried.The researcher wondered if the large positive ion emission discovered during the Carnegie test might relate toan ion generation function for an unconventional craft propulsion system. Col. Corso told me he had not heard of layered bismuth and magnesium, but described his understanding of oneextraterrestrial spacecraft propulsion: \"The craft was able to displace gravity through the propagation ofmagnetic waves, controlled by shifting the magnetic poles around the craft so as to control, or vector, not apropulsion system, but the repulsion force of like charges.\" Whatever the layered bismuth and magnesium/zinc's function might be, by May 2006 it remains a mystery. Todate, no one has ever reproduced the layered material, either. The information from the South Carolina sourcecould be a controlled government release into public consciousness without the political commitment ofofficial sanction. If government insiders do know about layered Bi/Mg and the extraterrestrial wedge-shapedcraft it is supposed to have come from, their silence is consistent with a policy of cover-up since at least theearly 1940s.Ar tis t' s illus tra tion of w e dge - s ha pe d a e ria l ve hic le ,based on at least three eyewitness descriptions.Image © 2002 Tim Bauer.More Information: Book: Unconventional Flying Objects - A Scientific Analysis © 1995 by Paul R.
