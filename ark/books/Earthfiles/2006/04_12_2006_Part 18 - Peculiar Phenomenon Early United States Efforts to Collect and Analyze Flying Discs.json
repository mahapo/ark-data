Andrew KissnerReturn to Part 1\"Secret War?\" The Plane Carnage ContinuesOn the Fourth of July 1947, while Mac Brazel was visiting the Roswell Sheriff to tell him about the crash ofa flying saucer on his ranch near Corona, a B-17 bomber crashed in Sibley, Louisiana, w ithin one mile of therunway. A public affairs officer at Barkesfield Field in Shreveport announced that it had crashed because \"astaff sergeant had taken the plane on an unauthorized flight.\" Little is known about this event because the onlyreport found concerning the crash, explosion and fire was an Associated Press wire photo in a localnewspaper in New Mexico. [ Las Cruces Sun-News, July 6, 1945.]Thirty miles south of Tucson, Arizona, a pilot and his passenger were killed as their plane took off from alanding strip on their ranch the Fourth of July. Eyewitness observers reported that as the plane took off, it lostpower and crashed at the end of the runway. \"The ...light plane plunged into the ground from a height ofseveral hundred feet shortly after taking off...\" The pilot was a B-29 navigator in WWII and a flying instructorat a pilot training school in Tucson. [ Front Page, Las Cruces Sun-News, July 5, 1947.] Front P age, Las Cruces Sun-News, July 5, 1947.On July 8, The New York Times Military Affairs Editor, Hanson Baldwin, wrote yet another story about theneed to re-survey the American air defense capability.\"The Air Coordinating Committee, which last made an estimate of national needs in 1945, willreport to the President that a minimum of 3,000 to 5,000 military aircraft per year will benecessary to assure our nation's security. Stanford Research Institute (SRI) will conduct a"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"detailed study of national requirements. ...In addition to Stanford, the committee will drawupon the Air Material Command of the Army Air Forces and the Navy's Bureau of Aeronauticsfor information and plans evolved in those quarters before drafting its report.\"That same day above New York City and eastern Canada, eight flying discs were reported. Police wereinundated with phone calls as were astronomers. In the story, a professor in Australia discussed an experimentthat he conducted with his students. He had 450 of them stare at a fixed point in the sky. Twenty-two cameback ten minutes later to ay they had seen a flying disc. \"Just as I thought,\" said the professor. It was all due tothe red corpuscles of blood passing in front of the retina of the eye.\" [ Ibid.]On July 9, an Army Air Forces C-54 transport on a flight from Bermuda to Florida simply \"disappeared,\"according to the Air Transport Command. Its crew of six was presumed lost at sea. A search and rescue effortwas launched and two cushions were found with an oxygen bottle and some aircraft plywood before the searchwas called off. [ The New York Times, July 9, 1947, p. 47.]On July 11, another V-2 was launched at WSPG. This test was terminated 35 seconds into the flight. The LasCruces Sun-News reported that after the missile had soared eighteen miles, the rocket was \"brought down by anewly installed safety station after it became evident that the missile, while on a northerly course, would gonorth out of the safety range. The missile was in the air seventy seconds ... and landed two miles from thelaunch site and the remaining fuel exploded. Col. Turner said the test firing was an excellent demonstration ofthe effectiveness of the new safety devices.\" [Author's emphasis.]Only one month before, Col. Turner told reporters that V-2 rocket fuel does not explode, \"it burns.\" But afterthe July 11 aborted launch, Col. Turner explained that the remaining fuel in that V-2 exploded on impact withthe ground.On July 12, the wife and daughter of a New Jersey businessman were killed when their seaplane crashed as itattempted to land at Lake George, New York. The pilot was critically injured. Another seaplane, circling tosee what had happened to the first plane, also crashed as its wingtip brushed the water while it was banking ina turn. The pilot of the second plane suffered minor injuries. [ The New York Times, July 13, 1947, p. 47.]On July 13, twenty-one people were killed and fifteen injured when a DC-3 crashed into a swamp in Florida.The plane on a flight from Newark, New Jersey to Miami, crashed a mile short of an emergency runway inBroward County. A passenger on board the place said that one engine stopped and then a second enginestopped and the aircraft crashed.Also on July 13, an American Airlines CD-4 en route to Shannon Airport, Ireland, landed in Newfoundlandafter two of its four engines \"went dead\" over the Atlantic Ocean. The commercial airliner had been rented bya Long Beach, California firm. [ The New York Times, July 14, 1947, p. 2.]That same day, a Navy Corsair fighter flying from the Naval Air Station at Willow Grove, Pennsylvania,crashed and exploded at Harbourton, New Jersey, in the cemetery of a Presbyterian church. The pilot died. Hewas apparently seeking a landing in the rural and isolated area when he struck a tree that knocked him intoutility poles on both sides of a road that sheared off both the plane's wings. \"Debris was scattered around theheadstones by the blast that followed.\" [ Ibid.]On July 14, Harold Duke of Hot Springs, Arkansas put his burning twin engine airplane down on an abandonedairstrip near Albuquerque just as the fire \"was reaching the control panel.\" [ Front Page, Las CrucesSun-News, July 16, 1947.]That same day, two U. S. AAF aircraft collided in mid-air near Frankfurt, Germany. This accident isunreported in any U. S. media with the exception of an obituary notice in a Wilson, Texas, newspaper, thehometown of one of the dead pilots.On July 15, a Las Cruces family and their friend watched a comet-like object from their front yards:\"...while seated in their front yard, they saw a large light in the sky. The object appeared largerthan an automobile headlight and was traveling at a terrific rate of speed and left a trail like acomet. The object was going north and was almost directly between the Organ Mountains andLas Cruces when discovered. It burst into three pieces and immediately searchlights went upfrom the White Sands Proving Grounds and searched the skies for an indefinite length of time.\"[ Front Page, Las Cruces Citizen, July 17, 1947.]Off the coast of Melbourne, Australia, eight members of the British Royal Navy were killed on July 20, in aseries of airplane accidents over one hour. Two Fireflies from the British aircraft carrier Theseus interlockedin the air and dropped 1,000 feet into Port Phillip Bay, killing six and injuring one. A Seafire aircraft thenattempted a landing on the deck of the Theseus and struck and fatally injured a seaman. A second Seafire thenattempted a landing, bounced over the crash barriers and ran into two parked aircraft killing one mechanic andinjuring another. [ The New York Times, July 21, 1947.]On July 21, an Argentine transport plane ran into a crowd killing seventeen when it could not stop on therunway. After running into the crowd, the airplane burst into flames.[ The New York Times, July 22, 1947, p. 10.]"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Front P age, El Paso Times, July 22, 1947.Also on July 21, two U. S. Marine Corps aircraft interlocked in mid-air above El Toro Air Field, California,and crashed. Two pilots bailed out, but the third was killed. Eyewitnesses said the tails of t he two planesappeared to lock together. [ Ibid.]The New York Times, July 22, 1947, p. 25.The same day, two 5th Air Force pilots were killed when their planes collided in the air two miles east ofTokyo.

While Planes Crashed,Flying Discs Were EverywhereOn July 5, Civil Aeronautics officials in Augusta, Maine, saw dozens of \"flying missiles\" over the citytraveling in a northerly direction. In a new s article about the sighting, a spokesman for General Electric saidthat it had been successful in \"growing large ice crystals\" which if viewed at a distance, in just the right light,might resemble a flying disc. [ The New York Times, July 6, 1947, p. 36.]"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" On July 7, a group of ten people watched a flight of eight flying discs near St. Maries, Idaho. One of the femaleeyewitnesses told the El Paso Times on July 7, 1947, \"The discs came into view at an extreme speed, going ina northerl y di recti on, suddenl y sl ow ed and fl uttered l ike l eaves to the ground. She sai d that they w ere as l argeas a five room house and were extremely bright. She said that she and her companions could not find themafterward, nor any sign that they had been there.\" In the same El Paso Times report, a professor of psychiatry at Syracuse University College of Medicine saidin a radio interview, \"the discs possibly were a result of experiments by unknown government agencies. Theelement of mass hysteria should not be taken into consideration. They have been seen by too many people intoo many different places to be dismissed so lightly.\" On July 6, the Army Air Forces reported that they would like to see a flying disc. A more interesting aspect ofthis report quotes a nuclear physicist at the California Institute of Technology (CIT) as saying, \"They (flyingdiscs) have nothing to do with nuclear physics.\" CIT became a member of the JRDB, UARRP on the recommendation of Holger Toftoy about six months priorto the physicists's statement. CIT was also the principal contractor for the Hermes project that was trying outsurface-to-air missiles at White Sands. General Electric was a subcontractor to CIT. Civil Aeronautics Board Airplane FatalitiesJanuary through June 1947On July 24, the Civil Aeronautics Board released its fatality figures for the first six months of 1947.Domestically, the CAB reported a total of 167 people killed between January 1 and June 30, 1947. This wasthe highest number since statistics began being collected in 1939; the fatality rate was three times higher thanthe year before. And yet, that record-breaking official CAB total does not seem to include all the fatalitieslisted in the newspapers I researched for the period.There was a real threat to the national security of the United States in the summer of 1947, but few Americanswere aware that it was not the U.S.S.R. It was not China. It was not the Koreans. The threat was the new disctechnology with weapons that were more capable than anything on earth. It was a new technology that no oneunderstood. The American insiders, the MJ-12 group, were not going to mention its existence to anyone.The New York Times, July 24, 1947, p. 9.Continued in Part 19 - American Attacks and Disc Retaliations?More Information:For more about military voices and Majestic-12 leaked documents, please see reports below in EarthfilesArchives:• 03/17/2006 -- Part 1: U.S. Navy Chief Yeoman Describes \"Extraterrestrial Biological Entities\" in TOPSECRET/MAJIC Photographs.• 03/23/2006 -- Part 2: U.S. Navy Chief Yeoman Describes \"Extraterrestrial Biological Entities\" in TOPSECRET/MAJIC Photographs.• 02/27/2006 -- Part 4: Military Voices Reply About Government Interaction with UFOs• 02/22/2006 -- Part 3: Military Voices Reply About Government Interaction with UFOs• 02/21/2006 -- Part 2: Military Voices Reply About Government Interaction with UFOs• 02/17/2006 -- Updated: White Sands Navy Radar Operator Saw Discs Circle V-2 Rocket Launches• 02/07/2006 -- Part 1: Military Voices Reply About Government Interaction with UFOs.• 03/26/2004 -- Back Engineering ET Craft•03/17/2004 -- Part 1 - \"Horrible Secret\" in UFO Crash Retrievals Near Roswell, New Mexico, in July1947?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"•03/17/2004 -- Part 2 - \"Horrible Secret\" in UFO Crash Retrievals Near Roswell, New Mexico, in July1947?For more about American military aggression against UFOs, crash/retrievals and UFO retaliation, please seereports below in Earthfiles Archives :• 04/05/2006 -- Part 16 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs• 03/23/2006 -- Part 15 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs• 03/09/2006 -- Part 14 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs• 02/28/2006 -- Part 13 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs• 02/27/2006 -- Part 4: Military Voices Reply About Government Interaction with UFOs• 02/22/2006 -- Part 3: Military Voices Reply About Government Interaction with UFOs• 02/21/2006 -- Part 2: Military Voices Reply About Government Interaction with UFOs• 02/19/2006 -- Part 12 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs• 02/17/2006 -- Updated: White Sands Navy Radar Operator Saw Discs Circle V-2 Rocket Launches• 02/07/2006 -- Military Voices Reply About Government Interaction with UFOs.• 02/05/2006 -- Part 11 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs• 01/29/2006 -- Part 10 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs• 01/17/2006 -- Part 9 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs· 01/17/2006 -- Part 9 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and AnalyzeFl yi ng Discs· 01/09/2006 -- Part 8 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs· 01/03/2006 -- Part 7 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs· 12/31/2005 -- Part 6 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs· 12/27/2005 -- Part 5 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs· 12/24/2005 -- Part 4 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs· 12/24/2005 -- Part 3 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs· 12/21/2005 -- Part 2 - Peculiar Phenomenon, Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs· 12/19/2005 -- Part 1 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect and Analyze FlyingDiscs· 05/03/2005 -- Part 3: Japan Air Lines Pilot Interview About November 1986 UFO Encounter· 05/03/2005 -- Part 2: Japan Air Lines Pilot Interview About November 1986 UFO Encounter· 05/02/2005 -- Part 1: Japan Air Lines and Mile-Diameter UFO, November 1986, Drawings and Transcript· 04/17/2005 -- 1949 Aerial Disc Covered-Up By Project Blue Book As \"Kite\"· 04/14/2005 -- \"Battle of Los Angeles\" On February 25, 1942: America Fired At A UFO· 02/11/2005 -- Story Behind \"Inflation-Theory Implications for Extraterrestrial Visitation\"· 12/30/2004 -- Audience Feedback About Earthfiles \"September 12, 1952: America's 'Secret War'?\"· 12/30/2004 -- September 12, 1952: America's \"Secret War\"?
