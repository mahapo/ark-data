Northwest ofWaterhen Lake is Cold Lake Air Weapons Range. Investigators often wonder ifthe UFO phenomenon monitors Earth military installations? July 1, 2006 Maidstone, Saskatchewan, Canada - Mysterious, unexplained glowing discs have beenshowing up almost weekly since early April 2006 at Meadow Lake and Waterhen Lake in Saskatchewan,Canada, northeast of Lloydminster. Barb Campbell, organizer of the SPPRC - Paranormal Research Centre inSaskatchewan, Canada is also Manager of the Sandpiper Motel in Maidstone, Saskatchewan. Barb has madethe two to three hour trip to the lakes to investigate the unidentified aerial phenomena and talk to eyewitnesses.In one instance at Waterhen Lake First Nation, it was estimated that perhaps a thousand people saw strange,moving lights over the water. Back north of Lloydminster on a ranch in Hillmond, Barb has also investigated arecent cattle mutilation discovered by the farm owner on June 17, only two weeks ago.Interview:Barb Campbe ll, SPPRC - Paranormal Re se arch Ce ntre in Saskatche wan, Canada; also Manage r,Sandpipe r Mote l, Maidstone , Saskatche wan, Canada: \"I was raised around cattle on a cattle ranch most ofmy life. I have seen natural causes of animal deaths. I have seen what can happen when a bear attacks and alsodogs.On the night of June 17th, 2006 I received a call from a farmer in Hillmond north of Lloydminster. He haddiscovered one of his cows, in a herd of about sixty, dead the previous morning (June 16, 2006) andr e me mb e r e d my na me fr o m ha v i ng r e a d the Lloydminster Meridian Booster. He told me that the carcassappeared to fit the same as other mutilations he had heard about."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The instant I came across this carcass in the field, I knew right away that this was not a predator kill. The onething that really struck me was the position of her body - very contorted, unnatural. It’s not something wherethe animal would have just dropped sick and died that way. Not possible. To me it seems more – like she wasdropped from above and ended up in that position.Unfortunately, when we got to the scene, it had been a week and a half to two weeks since this occurred. Itwould have been nice to be there when it was fresh. Then we could possibly have seen more than we did.Seven-year-old Simmental/Hereford Cross that had a calf was found by farm owner the foggy morningof June 16, 2006, in Hillmond, Saskatchewan, Canada. Note the circle of brown grass around the mutilatedcow's body. Biophysicist W. C. Levengood links this often-seen grass phenomenon at animal mutilationsites to microwave and other complex energies perhaps involved in a technology which lowers thealready-dead and mutilated animal to the pasture ground. Image © 2006 by Barb Campbell, SP P RC.Clos e -up of H illmond cow's right side of head where ear, eye and jaw flesh removed. Tongue unknownbecause of decomposition. Since at least the early 1960s, animals have been found around the world with an ear missing,eye missing, circle of flesh removed around the eye, half the jaw flesh removed revealing clean jaw bone, often the tongueis removed deep within the throat along with trachea and esophagus, genitals are excised and rectums are cored out.No blood, no signs of struggle, no tracks. Image © 2006 by Barb Campbell.No Tracks or Signs of StruggleBUT IT’S SIGNIFICANT THAT MUCH WAS PRESERVED AFTER TWO WEEKS IN A LAND WHERENATURAL PREDATORS SUCH AS COYOTES NORMALLY WOULD DECIMATE CARCASSES.That’s correct. The one thing the farmer noticed is that the coyotes would not come near it.DID YOU FIND ANY EVIDENCE OF THE ANIMAL STRUGGLING ON THE GROUND OR ANYTRACKS AROUND THE ANIMAL?Absolutely not. That’s one of the things I really looked for because an animal that size is pretty strong. Ananimal like that would have put up such a struggle, too. There would have been dirt like in her hooves, deepmark grooves in the ground. Nothing was disturbed. It’s as if it happened somewhere else and the result is shewas put on that spot. That’s it, left to rot. It’s pretty intriguing. Ear Tag Mysteriously RemovedWe did find her right ear tag from her missing right ear about 45.5 feet away from her head north. Her bodywas facing east and her head had been tw isted back north.When an ear tag is on a cow’s ear, it’s very difficult to remove that without damaging the hole that is on thetag. The photograph is on the website, too, of that ear tag and there is absolutely no damage around the hole tothat tag. So, for that tag to be removed, the ear itself would have to be sliced. It did not come off naturally. It"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"was not taken off by any predators. There are no teeth marks on that tag. There were no marks around the areaor on the ground to indicate any dog or coyotes or anything like that. Ear tag that had been in the right ear cut from Hillmond cow was found 45.5 feetfrom cow's dead and mutilated body. The tag hole was not cut.Image © 2006 by Barb Campbell.No BloodCOULD YOU FIND ANY EVIDENCE OF BLOOD ANYWHERE?No, absolutely not. I really paid close attention to her hide, too, for dark particles such as hemoglobin. I couldnot see anything. I looked on her hairs. I could not find anything. And if you look at the excisions, they are cutstraight, the edges are smooth. Some even look a little burned.Rectum cored out in Hillmond cow.Image © 2006 by Barb Campbell. Nothing Unusual Seen or Heard by NeighborsDID YOU TALK WITH ANY OF THE NEIGHBORS ABOUT WHETHER THEY HAD HEARD OR SEENANYTHING STRANGE IN THE AIR, ON THE GROUND OR ANY PLACE AROUND THAT PASTURE?I was not able to speak to neighbors. I spoke to the farmer’s son and spoke to the farmer the night before. Noone had noticed anything unusual.There is no other access to this place other than right past in front of the houses, which is really narrow – just aroad width to get through there. Or from the air. If nobody came past their house, then whatever came there,quite possibly came from above.THIS WAS JUNE 17, 2006, THAT YOU RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE FARMER ABOUT THEMUTILATED COW. HOW DOES THIS COW FIT INTO OTHER UNUSUAL PHENOMENA YOU HAVEBEEN TRYING TO STUDY AT MEADOW LAKE? WHERE IS MEADOW LAKE IN RELATIONSHIP TOTHIS PASTURE?Meadow Lake is not too far away. Probably a couple of hours going straight across, pretty close to three"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"hours. It’s in line with a mutilation that occurred at the same time last year; the first one reported last year wasaround Paradise Hill. That’s not too far away from where this one was found this year.Then if you go further in the direction of Meadow Lake, there has been quite a few animal mutilationshappening around Mackwa – and there’s a line going straight up to Meadow Lake, if you look on a map.There have been a lot of strange lights. Of course, just a little bit north of Meadow Lake at Waterhen Lake,there was the massive amount of people, like over a thousand, who witnessed some very unusual activity upthere and close encounters. Most Dramatic UFO Activity At Meadow LakeCAN YOU DESCRIBE THE MOST DRAMATIC?The most dramatic up there happened around 2:30 in the morning. Sightings began April 4, 2006, and werealso recorded April 28, and three days prior to that. So possibly April 25, at 2:35 in the morning, the nightwatchman, Kenny, was out watching doing his duty at Waterhen Lake First Nation. All of a sudden, he noticedthese lights.Now, people around here have always seen these lights, but for the first time, they started to come down from10,000 feet. They came right down, right over the top of him and over on to the lake, a meter above the lake,eight or nine objects and he said, ‘The size of houses. They are like two Frisbees on top of one another, withan orange in the middle. The orange in the middle had windows around it.”Sketch by eyewitness of one of the unidentified aerial objects that put on a dramatic 6-hourshow for many eyewitnesses beginning around 2:35 a.m. on April 25, 2006.Sketch done for SPP RC investigator, Barb Campbell.They came down onto the lake. The lake had a thin layer of ice. The lights went quite the distance across thelake and then they started to alternate heights, as if they were doing something, spinning. The top and middleand bottom are spinning separate directions from each other. Beautiful disc-shaped lights! Bright orange on thetop and underneath was like fifteen different colors of the rainbow, all in synchronization, like smooth andrunning into each other.So, these objects were going up and down. Two would take off and another two would take their place. Thiswas going on for 3.5 hours. He, Kenny, is running around trying to wake everybody up that he can to come outand take a look at this. He made a call also to the RCMP. An officer came out, too, to look and he was baffled.He couldn’t explain what it was. There are two RCMP officers who have seen these strange lights and objectsat Water Hen Lake.IF THIS WENT ON FOR MORE THAN THREE HOURS, DID ANYONE GET PHOTOGRAPHS ORVIDEOTAPE?Apparently one woman captured some video footage and then something happened down the road. It goterased or used up.Three nights later, these objects came back and she happened to have her camcorder and she filmed it. Thereare about 3.5 minutes of it. Although you can’t see the colors, you do see the lights. They are the best nighttimeimages I’ve seen on film. They are nearly the size of walnuts (in the video), very clear. She shows you what alamp post looks like compared to what you are seeing, so you won’t say they are just street lights. They are notstars. You can definitely see they are not stars. There is one there that has the lights go across the center indifferent squares.Then there are objects that were in a diamond formation just hovering there. Then two begin to chase oneanother. It’s really fantastic! When you look at the objects that were in the diamond formation, they fit thedescription of the ones above the lake. Close Encounter with Androids?I had a call on May 19, 2006, from one man who said he and his buddies had a 6-hour encounter with a discand humanoi d bei ngs, four to si x bei ngs at Greenw ater Lake Provi nci al Park southeast of Ti sdale, al ongHighway 773 East. At one point, the young man got close enough to the beings to see they were not breathing,but they were making clicking sounds. That’s quite extraordinary.NOT BREATHING AND CLICKING SOUNDS LIKE SOME KIND OF ANDROID ENTITY?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Yes, they said the entities blended into the scenery so well that if you didn’t know what you were looking at,you wouldn’t see them. Like the first one was in the water and it looked like the entities were wearingsomething like hip waders, like fishermen wear. The entities would not move so long as the guys werewatching them.The young men got in their truck and took off and it looked like the entities were coming after them. Theystopped, turned around, and out of curiosity they went back. That’s when they got close enough to one at theshore to see it was not breathing.\"There have also been reports of reptilian-type beings and Barb Campbell plans to keep interviewingeyewitnesses and reporting what she discovers at her website: http://www.spprc.org/ Barb Campbell's \"Close Encounter\"with Bizarre-Shaped Aerial CraftSmithers is north of Vancouver, B. C., Canada.I had a very close encounter with a craft in the mid-1970s in a valley near Smithers, British Columbia. It wasjust about treetop height, directly above my head. I have yet to this day to see a drawing or sketch of anyoneelse having seen the same thing.It (odd-shaped craft) was so surreal. I had a whole view of the valley and it disappeared in like a couple ofseconds flat and there w as nowhere it could have gone. Just like into nothing. Just gone! I’ve never seenanythi ng l ike i t si nce.\"Gr a phic pre pa r e d by B a rb Ca mpbe ll to illus tr a te the biza r re a e r ia l c ra f t"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"she encountered at Springhill R a nc h in Smithe r s , B.
