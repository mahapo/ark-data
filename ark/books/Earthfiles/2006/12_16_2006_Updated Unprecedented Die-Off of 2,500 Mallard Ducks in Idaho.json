In doing some research,we can’t find any other die-offs of this magnitude with mallard ducksin the United States.\" - David Parrish, Idaho Dept. of Fish and GameSome of the 2,500 mallard ducks that had died betweenDecember 8 and 13, 2006, along Land Creek Springs near Oakley, Idaho.Photo courtesy Idaho Fish and Game.Land Creek Springs, a waterway near Oakley, Idaho,where dead mallards were first reported on Friday, December 8, 2006. Updated December 16/ December 14, 2006 Oakley, Idaho - In a six day periodbetween December 8 and December 13, 2006, the Idaho Fish and Game Departmentreceived reports of dead mallard ducks on the Land Creek Springs waterway near Oakleyin the Sawtooth National Forest region of south central Idaho. By December 13th, thedeath count was up to 2,500 ducks, unprecedented in Idaho wildlife history. By December14, the first laboratory results from several agencies are expected and I talked about theunprecedented die-off with David Parrish, Magic Valley Regional Supervisor in the IdahoDepartment of Fish and Game where he has been employed for twenty-six years.Update: Idaho Fish and Game News Release on December 15, 2006"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"\"Ducks Died of Fungal InfectionState and federal officials have confirmed that about 2,500 mallard ducksfound dead southeast of Burley, died of an acute fungal infection.The official cause of death is acute aspergillosis, a respiratory tract infectioncaused by a fungus commonly found in soil, dead leaves, moldy grain,compost piles, or in other decaying vegetation.Test results from University of Idaho’s Caine Veterinary Teaching Center inCaldwell confirmed the presence of the fungus in tissue samples taken fromthe ducks this week. The results confirm preliminary diagnoses at two otherwildlife health labs in Washington and Wisconsin.The fungus can cause respiratory tract infections in birds that inhale thespores. The most likely source of the spores for these ducks is moldy grain,but no specific site has been found as the source.Waterfowl die-offs are common and many happen in the United States everyyear. During the past six months, 16 events each involving more than 1,000birds occurred. Testing for diseases is a routine part of the investigation ofwaterfowl die-offs.The first dead ducks were found by a hunter Friday, December 8, along LandCreek Springs near Oakley. Idaho Department of Fish and Game was notified,and conservation officers found 10 dead ducks near the spring and along thestream’s edge.Officers returned to the area on December 10 to find more than 500 deadducks. By the end of clean-up operations Thursday morning, the number hadgrown to about 2,500. Though a small proportion of the duck population inIdaho or the United States, the number of dead birds in this die-off is unusualfor Idaho.Officials initially considered it unlikely that avian influenza was the cause ofthis die-off. Widespread testing of waterfowl in fall of 2006 has not found thehighly pathogenic avian influenza strain H5N1 in the United States.Tissue samples from dead birds were not consistent with avian influenza, butas a precaution samples were sent to U.S. Geological Survey’s NationalWildlife Health Center in Wisconsin for testing.Results from the first two groups of ducks tested confirmed that they did nothave the highly pathogenic avian influenza strain H5N1 that is currently ofconcern in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Results from additionaltests are pending.The Idaho Department of Environmental Quality, Department of Agricultureand the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service helped with the investigation of thisoutbreak. Hunters are advised not to kill any obviously sick animals, includingducks and other waterfowl.\"Interview:David Parrish, Magic Valley Regional Supervisor, Idaho Department of Fish andGame (employed for 26 years), Jerome, Idaho: \"We first got a report of waterfowlmortality on the site back on Friday, December 8, 2006. We had a conservation officerdispatched to the area and he found 10 dead ducks. We cleaned those up.We got another call from a hunter on Sunday afternoon, Dec. 10, about dead ducks in thesame general area. We dispatched an officer again. At that point in time, he found about500 mallard ducks that were dead.By Monday morning, December 11, we sent staff out on site. We found roughly 1500 deadmallards and by yesterday afternoon after we picked up all of the carcasses, the count wasup to about 2500 mallard ducks."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"David Parrish: \"These photos were taken the morning of December 13, 2006,as Idaho Dept. of Fish and Game staff was removing carcasses from the site for disposal.We removed the carcasses for several reasons: to ascertain whether additional duckswere dying; to minimize the potential for secondary mortality to predators;and to address the potential for a public health issue.\"The dead mallard duck carcasses were hauled to a local pit, incineratedand covered with soil.

In doing some research, we can’tfind any other die-offs of this magnitude with mallard ducks in the United States. We havea number of agencies that are investigating the cause of death and looking at potentialmortality factors. We have our Dept. of Environmental Quality (DEQ), the South CentralDistrict Health Office, the Idaho Dept. of Agriculture. At the federal level, we have theDept. of Homeland Security involved. There are a number of agencies and they are alllooking at a number of potential factors. DEQ has taken water and soil samples from the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"area. The Dept. of Agriculture has taken pesticide samples. Our agency is taking tissuesamples and has sent them off to a number of labs.WHAT ABOUT THE ISSUE OF H5N1 AVIAN INFLUENZA?Chances are very remote, but we did some samples off to a U. S. Fish and Wildlife lab inWisconsin to look at that potential.IS IT TRUE THAT SOME OF THE MALLARD DUCKS STILL ALIVE WERESUFFERING RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS?That is correct. But the ducks that we’ve done necropsies on have shown abscesses on thelungs, which could be causing the respiratory distress. According to our veterinarian, Dr.Mark Drew, at our health lab, he said that the ducks he has looked at have not shown theclassical signs of a virus or influenza type outbreak.WHAT IS HE SAYING THE ABSCESSES COULD BE CAUSED BY?They could be caused by a bacterial infection or a fungal disease. That’s his best guess atthis point in time, but he has not received results back from the laboratory yet.WHY WOULD A FUNGUS OR BACTERIA AFTER ALL THESE YEARS SUDDENLYCAUSE SUCH A LARGE DIE-OFF IF IT HAS NOT HAPPENED BEFORE?It could be that these ducks got into some moldy grain of some type or a grain that wastreated with some type of chemical that caused the mold to become toxic and the duckspicked it up. We’re not sure.IF THIS WERE H5N1 THAT DOES TEND TO KILL DUCKS AND MIGRATORYBIRDS REALLY QUICKLY IN LARGE NUMBERS, WHAT WOULD THEVETERINARIAN EXPECT TO FIND IF THE DUCKS HAD DIED FROM H5N1?Talking with Dr. Mark Drew this morning, he said there would be physical signs when theydo a necropsy. He was talking about some of the internal organs, which show signs such asbeing enlarged, inflamed. He said he has seen nothing of that sort in the necropsies he hasdone so far.HAVE YOU HAD REPORTS OF MORE DEAD MALLADS TODAY?No, we have not.IS THERE ANY INDICATION THAT ANY OTHER BIRDS HAVE BEEN AFFECTEDBEYOND THE MALLARDS?We have found no other mortalities other than mallard ducks at this location, which is veryunusual.YOU WOULD THINK OTHER BIRDS WOULD BE EATING FROM THE SAMESOURCES AS THE MALLARDS?Right. We have pintails, Canadian geese and other birds and we’ve seen no othermortalities. This is a very unusual situation and I don’t think any of us have ever dealt withthis type of mortality before.DID YOU ASK THE VETERINARIAN TO COMMENT ON THIS VERY PRECISEFOCUS ON THE MALLARDSD WITHOUT OTHER BIRDS DYING?Yes, and we’ve not had any experience with anything like this in the past. Dr. Martin findsit very unusual that it’s just infecting the mallards.WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF THE WATER THAT COMES INTO LAND CREEKSPRINGS, THE WATERWAY NEAR OAKLEY, IDAHO?Yes. It is an artesian-type springs system. It just boils up from the ground and it drainstoward the Snake River.FOR THAT TO BE CONTAMINATED, IT WOULD MEAN CONTAMINATEDGROUND WATER?That’s correct, yes.IS THAT BEING STUDIED?Yes, it is. The DEQ has taken water samples and submitted them to laboratories.FROM YOUR OWN LONG EXPERIENCE IN THE IDAHO FISH AND GAME"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"DEPARTMENT, WHAT IS YOUR OWN INTUITIVE SENSE ABOUT WHAT ISHAPPENING?It’s just a guess, but because it is a localized event, I would guess it would have to do witha contaminated grain source of some type.IF YOU CAN FIND THAT CONTAMINATED GRAIN SOURCE, WHAT DO YOU DO?It can be covered. Or if it’s laying on the surface of a field, it can be plowed under. It canbe scraped up and physically removed. There are several different options that areavailable to us. IS THERE A WAY YOU GO TO FARMERS TO ASK FOR HELP TO FIND THECONTAMINATED GRAIN?We have been working with the Idaho Dept. of Agriculture to contact landowners in thearea. We’ve also sent some of our conservation officers out to see if we can find thepotential source of mortality here. But to date, none of us have been successful in findingthe exact cause.WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP?Well, we’re hoping to get some laboratory results back today. We have a conference callset up through our State Emergency Communications System at 4 p.m. this afternoon. Atthat time, the agencies will share their results and if we have a definitive cause ofmortality, then we will form a plan of action to deal with whatever is causing all thedeaths.\"Anyone with information should contact Idaho Fish and Game in Jerome at:208-324-4359.This Earthfiles report will be updated when the laboratory results are in.More Information:For further information about bird die-offs, please see the Earthfiles Archives:• 08/05/2005 -- Scientists Puzzled by \"Bizarre\" Pacific Coast Die-offs in 2005• 07/14/2005 -- 8,000 White Pelican Chicks Mysteriously Died At Chase Lake, NorthDakota• 08/27/2004 -- Global Warming Impact On Birds - More Extinctions Expected• 08/01/2004 -- Sixth Straight Year Hundreds of Birds Die at Roestler Lake, North Dakota.• 07/24/2004 -- What's Happening to Birds? - More Reports• 07/22/2004 -- What Is Happening to Birds?
