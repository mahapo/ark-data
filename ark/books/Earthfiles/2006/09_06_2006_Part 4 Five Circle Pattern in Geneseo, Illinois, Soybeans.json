One of his photographs sparked a question in the minds of Roger Sugdenand Jeffrey Wilson of the Independent Crop Circle Research Association (ICCRA).Puzzling Soybean Circle PlacementGraphically superimposed blue line goes along sprayer lines;red line goes along planting rows. Aerial image © 2006 by Ted Robertsonand graphic © 2006 by Roger Sugden and Jeffrey Wilson, ICCRA.Jeff applied the red and blue lines to the photograph and wrote to me by email:“Roger Sugden looked at Ted’s aerial photos of that site and it appeared atfirst that the formation was aligned to the planting rows and not to thetramline sprayer lines, but the actual planting rows. Those are at a differentangle than the sprayer lines are. Sprayer lines seem to be parallel to the road,but for some reason – we don’t know why this is the case – when they plantedthere, they planted sort of on an angle. So, Roger first looked at it and thoughtit was aligned to the planting rows, rather than the sprayer lines.\"But in a better overhead aerial, I looked at it more carefully and it does notappear to be aligned to either one, which is the photograph I sent you with thetwo colored lines. One colored line (blue) is aligned with the tramlines. Theother colored line (red) is aligned with the planting rows. The formation is notaligned to either one, which is somewhat significant in the sense that generallywhen we are in a manmade formation, it’s aligned to some feature on theground like the sprayer lines or perhaps the planting rows or telephone poleson the ground or some building feature that the people use as a marker whenthey are laying out the construction on it.\"In this case, the Geneseo soybean circles are not aligned to any groundfeature, including the tramlines, the planting lines, the poles nearby, or eventhe microwave tower off in the distance.\"September 3,2006 email from Chris and Jim Stahlin answer to my question about the sprayer and planting lines:Jim Stahl: \"The field is actually one big triangle. I planted the rows parallel to the fencerow on the north. I sprayed parallel to the fence row on the south.\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Aerial showing 5-circle-formation not aligned to Middle Road on left.Jim Stahl planted soybeans parallel to northern fence row to the right off camera.Ted Robertson found, using GPS, that the formation was rotated 19 degrees eastof magnetic north.

On August 22, 1991, farmers Delmar and Carol Meyer found that circle of cornswirled counterclockwise. Three days later on August 25, 1991, a local pilot (deceased Blue Grassmayor) flew over and found the second circle near old Highway 61, now called 140th Avenue.

Aerial photograph courtesy Carol and Delmar Meyer.Interview:Delmar Meyer, Farmer, Blue Grass, Iowa: “It was fifteen years ago back on August 22,1991, probably around 6 p.m. I did custom bailing and I was going down the road (CoonHunter's Road) with a tractor. I looked up there on the hillside and I could see a circle. Iwent down and finished bailing and came back and got the wife (Carol) and said, ‘Let’s golook at the hole in the ground.’ A couple of weeks before, there was a (limestone) quarryover about three miles and they had a hole that fell in. So I thought maybe it was anotherone in my corn. But then, when we got out there, it was no hole. It was just a completecircle in our corn.SO IS YOUR FARM ON A LOT OF LIMESTONE?I’m not certain – the quarry is at least three miles away – but at the time I didn’t know"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"what else it could be.WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU SEE IN THE CORN?I just went out there and it was all counterclockwise. Jim Stahl’s in Geneseo was allclockwise, wasn’t it?RIGHT.Mine was counterclockwise and it was just like something set on top of it and just wentdown. There were no cornstalks scuffed, no ears of corn knocked off. There wasn’t a stalkoutside that 46-foot-diameter circle! Everything was inside the circle. You know if youknocked corn down, it would fall into different rows. But this was neatly inside that48-foot-diameter perfect circle. Actually, it was measured it at 46 feet, five inches.[ Editor’s Note: Carol Meyer sent me an aerial photograph taken by local piloton August 25, 1991, which showed a second corn circle near old Highway 61that ran in front of their farm house. She said it also measured 46-feet and wasput down as someone's hoaxed copy of the first circle. \"We decided not to talkmuch about the second circle because we were afraid of being called crazy.\" ]IT WAS LIKE YOU PUT A COOKIE CUTTER DOWN AND EVERYTHING INSIDEWAS SWIRLED COUNTERCLOCKWISE?Ye s .HAD YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE?No, but we had heard about a crop circle over in Illinois around that time (Milan, Illinois,1990 - see report below.)DID YOU HAVE THE SHERIFF COME OUT TO LOOK AT THE CIRCLE?Yes. I called the Scott County Sheriff’s office right away and they came out and said aboutthe same thing that Jim Stahl in Geneseo, Illinois, said now. The deputy called his dispatchand said, 'I don’t know how we’re going to report this. There’s a circle out here and there’sno signs of anything – not of anybody walking to it or anything like that.’ So, that was allthey had and eventually they called it a hoax.BUT HOW COULD THAT BE IF THERE WERE NO TRACKS?I know, but they put it that way so they don’t have to go further and investigate it.THIS WAS A FIELD THAT DID NOT HAVE ANY TRAMLINES?Right, it didn’t have anything. The deputy and I looked around the outside edge of thecircle for any foot marks and didn’t find anything. There were no footprints in therewhatsoever, and there were no corn leaves pulled on the ground or anything.HOW WERE THE CORNSTALKS SWIRLED COUNTERCLOCKWISE?I don’t know. They just looked like they fell over.WERE THEY STRAIGHT? OR SWIRLED SOMEHOW?They were pretty straight, but there was not a one of them outside the edge of the circle.So there had to be some curve to it to stay inside.ALL THE PLANTS LEFT STANDING AROUND THE CIRCLE SEEMEDUNTOUCHE D?Ye s , t h e y w e r e .WERE ALL OF THE CIRCLE STALKS LIKE THEY HAD FALLEN TO A POINT INTHE CENTER?Well, in the center, there were a couple of bare spots, just like the plants were turned outfrom there and the dirt was all there was. It was like they were all put down at one time.There weren’t stalks on top of another. It’s just like something sat down on the stalks andput them down neatly, but the leaves weren’t torn up or ears knocked off. But somethingtook those plants down."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Center of corn circle nearest Coon Hunter Road found by Delmar and Carol Meyeron August 22, 1991.
