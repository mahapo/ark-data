Edward J. RuppeltReturn to Part 1November 28, 2006 Albuquerque, New Mexico -An official publication of Civilian Research, InterplanetaryFlying Objects (CRIFO) © 1957 by Leonard H. Stringfield.4 - \"THE ONLY CERTAINTY IS THAT NOTHING IS CERTAIN\"- Pliny the ElderProof! The word so legalistic is so endearing when its weight is on your side, yet socrushing when it is not. Webster's Dictionary says it is \"that degree of cogency, arisingfrom evidence, which convinces the mind of any truth of fact and produces belief .\"Many readers of Orbit probably wondered many times if it could be proved that I, itseditor, actually existed. One ungentle letter from a subscriber asked if I were just a figmentof the imagination for I never answered his mail. Of course, I had a reason in his case. Hehad told me in his first letter that he knew saucers were the craft of Satan.The word \"proof\" always bothered me. Edward Ruppelt, in his Foreword to The ReportOn Unidentified Flying Objects asks \"What constitutes proof? Does a UFO have to land atthe River Entrance to the Pentagon, near the Joint Chiefs of Staff offices? Or is it proofwhen a ground radar station detects a UFO, sends a jet to intercept it, the jet pilot sees it,and locks on with his radar, only to have the UFO streak away at a phenomenal speed? Isit proof when a jet pilot fires at a UFO and sticks to his story even under the threat ofcourt-martial? Does this constitute proof?\"I wondered about the place of proof in man's claims to understand or interpret hisanthropological or biblical past. And with even less propriety, it popped up when the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"subject of saucers got too hot. Musingly, spelled backwards, proof becomes \"foorp\" and Ifor one would be freshened by an official statement that would read, \"We have noirrefutable physical foorp that flying saucers exist.\"Evidence! What would be the kind of evidence that would prove that flying saucers exist? No one is sure, for in the first place there is no general agreement - even amongsaucerites - as to their probable identification or source. A few have been satisfied with abelief they are merely unknown natural phenomena; a few more hold to the hope that theyare earth made devices or weapons, while a lesser number think of the \"changing shapes\"as stratospheric protoplasms. The first to suggest this theory to the U. S. Air Force wasJohn P. Bessor of Pittsburgh, Pa., in 1947. In 1955, I talked with an Air Force officer whorelated that he had talked with a pilot who claimed he saw something looking like\"shapeless animals\" in stratospheric flights. A growing number, however, believe the UFOis a vehicle or missile from outer space.Flung together by circumstance, the space-minded group includes the cream of science-fiction addicts, the cultists, the objective and sometimes incommunicative scientist and thestudent-philosopher who professes a strong faith in his fellow man. The latter, resting hiscase for \"evidence\" in the recognition of man's virtue to report UFOs honestly andaccurately, invariably refers to the very earliest incidents, now known as the \"classics.\"Usually cited are Kenneth Arnold's \"nine saucer-like things ... flying like geese in achain-like line\" near Mt. Rainier, June 24, 1947. Or Captain Chiles' and co-pilot Whitted'sreport of a \"long rocket-like ship ... with two rows of windows\" near Montgomery,Alabama, July 24, 1948. And the \"dogfight\" between Lt. Gorman's F-51 and a fastmaneuvering orb of light near Fargo, North Dakota, October 1, 1948.Being \"honest and accurate reports,\" our student sees none of these incidents to beexplainable as natural phenomena. There is no scientifically declared phenomena in whichgeese fly in a chain-like line, or have two rows of windows, or perform intricatemaneuvers. Nor can any of these classic UFO events be explained as man-made machinesbecause several reports since 1947 have described \"saucer-like\" objects identical toArnold's which have flown dangerously close to commercial airliners.The Daily Sketch in London reported in November 1954, \"The pilot of a Brazilian airlinerreported a fleet of 19 saucer-like objects that flew at tremendous speed, less than 300 feetfrom his plane. His passengers panicked. Members of the crew had to act 'most violently'to overcome their fears.\"Thus, in view of logic, secret man-made machines do not run tests in the air lanes. So innone of these incidents, including Arnold's, were the \"saucers\" man-made. For that matter,neither was the \"rocket-like\" ship which swerved to avoid collision with the airliner pilotedby Chiles and Whitted; nor the object in the Fargo case which maneuvered with a militaryaircraft! All other explanations for the classics are ridiculous. The only logical explanationis that the objects are of extraterrestrial origin.In the years to follow, hundreds of reliable reports have been added to the stack ofevidence. Some of the best were the military sightings supported by radar. Major DonaldE. Keyhoe describes several in Flying Saucers from Outer Space. Of further interest is the\"official\" slant on other cases reviewed by Edward J. Ruppelt in The Report OnUnidentified Flying Objects. Notably here, the former head of Project Blue Book cites aUFO picked up by radar and pursued by a night fighter on May 29, 1952, over the SaginawBay area commented: \"A lot of people I knew were absolutely convinced this report wasthe key - the final proof. Even if the thousands of other reports could be discarded on atechnicality, this could not be. These people believed that this report in itself was proofenough to officially accept the fact UFOs were interplanetary space ships.\"But even with the Saginaw Bay \"evidence,\" the U. S. Air Force said, \"There is a total lackof evidence that they (flying saucers) are interplanetary vehicles.\" This is a quote from aUSAF letter from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense to me which was datedApril 9, 1957.While most people were content with that answer, others had equally different ideas aboutevidence. Some believed that Adamski's plaster of Paris mold of a space man's shoe printwas good enough. Others believed the word of Dan Fry, who contended that his trip in asaucer was evidence.Curious about what constitutes proof and evidence, I wrote to Lord Dowding, former AirChief Marshall for the RAF, World War II, and asked for his comments on the bestevidence in his country. His reply of May 21, 1957:\"In answer to the request contained in your letter of May 17, 1957, I wouldrefer you to a book entitled, Flying Saucer from Mars, published by FrederickMuller Ltd., London. So far as I am aware, this is the only recorded instanceof a landing in Britain, followed by a personal contact with the occupant of a"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"UFO. It also contains the only photograph which I have seen of a visitorclaiming to be from outer space (if we exclude the 'porthole' photographs inAdamski's second book). We got Mr. Cedric Allingham (the author) to lectureto our local Flying Saucer Club, and we were all strongly impressed that hewas telling the truth about his actual experiences, although we felt that hemight have been mistaken in some of the conclusions which he drew from hisinterview. The general views which he expressed on UFOs in his book willalso fail to gain universal agreement, although I am sure that they weregenuinely held by him. The circumstances of the encounter were in manyrespects similar to those of the adventure of the two Norwegian girls pickingberries in a wood with which you will doubtless be familiar. Unfortunately,Mr. Allingham died in Switzerland last year.\"Proof, therefore, when applied to UFO evidence is a relative word. On this premise, theUFO can be as interplanetary or as mundane or as non-existent as the individual mind isflexible or capable of defining it.Personally, having been pre-conditioned by my beliefs in the evolutionary prehistory ofman on Earth, I found the interplanetary hypothesis not difficult to accept. Apart from anoccasional exploratory or playful deviation from the theory, the sharpest thorns in my sidewere the bits of evidence from \"reliable sources\" which hinted that saucers were U. S.secret weapons. The thorns grew bigger and sharper after I began CRIFO. At one point, Isuspected that I was being maneuvered into the mundane definition, for my informant was persistent with his \"inside\" information. But after a little personal sleuthing, I found thatthe maneuver lacked both depth and substance. During this pressure period, I rememberanother \"insider\" who phoned several times, suggesting that my Newsletter was barking upthe wrong tree.\"One night when he phoned, I asked him to consider three simple basic questions:1) Would a secret U. S. weapon fly our commercial air lanes?2) Would a secret U. S. weapon fly wantonly over foreign countries?3) Would a secret U. S. weapon be tested over the U. S. capitol or over largepopulated cities?Stumbling over my first question, the \"insider\" hung up. While it was simple to explain tomy opposition that UFOs frequently violated all three points, it was not always wise torelate the details of my best supporting information, most of which came from confidentialsources. Reliable informants were a careful lot and they spoke out only because of theintense enthusiasm they shared in the UFO mystery, or because of a disdain for what onereferred to as \"unmitigated censorship.\" Most, however, spoke hintingly and winkingly.Several with hot tips were more dramatically cautious. They said they would deny theinformation they gave me if it were published.Needless to say, I never broke a confidence. But apart from any moral aspect, a person inmy \"research\" position had to be on constant guard when talking to strangers. \"Watch fortraps,\" I was warned by one well-informed person, when discussing the military angle.\"They'll give yo a hot one, you publish it, then they'll chop your head off.\"Not trusting a stranger, however, also had its negative reaction. Some, no doubt, viewedmy silence or evasiveness on some confidential matters as being melodramatic. But morethan a few had me marked as a spy for the Air Force. One private researcher from theWest Coast, visiting my home in 1955, told me, \"Let's don't kid each other - you don't trustme and I don't trust you.\"One in saucers soon learns to live with all the information crisscrossing his mind daily.Sometimes he is guided by its apparent truths - like the time I advised a dabbler in thestock markets to start thinking about railroads. \"They'll be back on their own soon,\" I said.\"Saucers and airliners don't mix well.\"I said it half jokingly, of course, but my reasoning was supported by the formidable stacksof mail received daily from non-joking citizenry. Most were scornful of the official silencewhich had enveloped the saucer problem since Captain Mantell's death chase in 1948(Kentucky). Many raked the Air Force over the coals; others condemned \"big business\"and later \"international bankers.\" A few blamed religion. Another popular notion claimed aspace race had taken over the world governments and was directing our ships of state. Inthe saucer business, rumors were always rive and the juiciest ones always won space insome little saucerzine. One mimeo sheet went so far as to claim that Christ and hisdisciples were lodged on the moon and were waiting to return to earth in a fleet of saucers.While the cultists were exploiting saucers, causing many on-the-fencers to abandon theirinterest, the man-on-the-street still saw them as a proofless fantasy. The world of MarilynMonroe and the scrabble board were more 3-dimensional!"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 5- THE PUZZLE OF THE MUZZLEPopular in the minds of many saucerites is the belief that our great American news mediaare muzzling saucer news under a vise of censorship. Wrote one pundit in a letter to CRIF:\"Our press talks glibly of the freedoms while their very own is lost. It is obvious that theyhave become subservient to the dictates of the military overlords who will stop at nothingto suppress flying saucer information.\"I have never shared the pundit's views, for if censorship were in effect, it would havemeant the suppression of all saucer news local as well as national! But as every sauceriteknows, most newspapers on occasions have published reports of local UFO activity, someeven on the front page. Perturbing me most, however, were not the \"big\" events publishedin the \"little\" town, but the big events and the manner in which they were treated in the bigcities. Too often these accounts were chopped, garbled or made ridiculous by the localpress and in almost every instance, completely neglected by the newswires. Even moresuspicious was the \"canned\" editorial and the handling of cases involving the military.One such canned \"editorial\" just happened to make the rounds during the big saucer flapof 1954. Under the heading, \"Enter The Flying Saucer Season,\" it read in part as follows:\"Air Force officials pointed out a few days ago that the 'flying saucer season' is nowapproaching. The meteor showers which are easily seen in the heavens in the summer,especially in July and August, always bring about a flurry of reports of 'flying saucer'sightings.\" According to Civilian Saucer Intelligence of New York, this so-called editorialappeared in at least three national newspapers: Pomeroy, Ohio Daily Sentinel on June 25,1954; the Public Herald, Mt. Holly, New Jersey, July 15, 1954; and the Lake Wales News,Florida, August 19, 1954.In the January 1956 issue of Orbit, thinking I had the answer, I wrote editorially:\"While I know of no federal directive which muzzles saucer stories from print(as one editor told the writer, he \"never saw an edict\"), there is however validreason to believe that a clandestine 'gentleman's agreement' has been effected.The reason is that rarely and only weakly have our truth-hunting editorschallenged the agency concealing the true saucer facts. Instead, it seems thatsome have gone beyond any 'agreement' and for autonomous or other selfishreasons have conspired with the silence group. This is done by snuffing outlocal sightings and tagging sighters as screwballs. The writer's activities havefrequently taken him behind scenes of the press. Here, most shrewd newsmenhave a conversant respect for the saucer mystery.\"But, curiously, few since 1952 have dared write up their beliefs, eventhough the facts at their command should have provided the trigger. On oneoccasion, while tracking down an Associated Press release, this writer wastold by a top staff writer and columnist of a local paper that while attending apress meeting in Washington, he learned that officials \"were taking more thana casual interest\" in the UFO problem.\"But I have noted that this same staff writer has not reviewed or mentionedsaucers in his columns since 1952. Still another sign of cooperative agreementbecame evident in Lake Charles, Louisiana. While vacationing there duringJune of 1955, this writer visited the office of the local paper, the AmericanPress. During the interview, which was set up for a possible feature story onCRIFO (tying it in with my wife having been born and reared in LakeCharles), we were told by the Managing Editor that public informationofficers (PIOs) from the adjacent Strategic Air Command (SAC) base hadvisited his office and asked that all saucer reports be directed to the base. Wealso noted that although the editor seemed warm to the idea of a feature storyduring the interview, nothing ever appeared save a notice that the Stringfieldswere vacationing.\"Eighteen months later, like a footnote to my theme on \"cooperation,\" the British FlyingSaucer Review in its July-August 1957 issue wrote:\"An unidentified flaming object flew across the State of Victoria, Australia, onthe evening of Sunday, May 19, 1957, and was seen by thousands of people.Telephone switchboards at Melbourne's weather bureau, police headquarters,airline and newspaper offices were jammed with calls from 5:45 p.m. until 8p.m. It is estimated that over 23,000 sighting reports of the object came in.Times given of its sighting at places hundreds of miles apart suggest its speedat nearly 2,000 mph. Reports described the object as being silver in colour,leaving a white or blue vapour trail in the night sky. ...Radio Australia"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"broadcast a long report, nearly 500 words, about this sensational sighting. TheB. B. C. considered it of sufficient importance to include in their 10 p.m. newsbulletin on the Light Programme that evening. The news agencies wired thestory from Australia. But the next morning not a single London newspapercarried it!\"Flying Saucer Review is positive that there is no actual censorship of flyingsaucer news in Britain. The Press does not like to be told what it may printand what it may not print. There is Freedom of the Press. There are no ordersnot to print anything in peacetime. No orders. However, there are occasionswhen editors are \"requested\" not to write about this or that. No actual order isgiven. It is just a written request from a certain Governmental committee.Flying Saucer Review is aware that such a body exists and knows its nameand address.\"It may be that the B.B.C. 'beat the gun' monitoring its news straight from theAustralian broadcast and giving it out in a condensed version on the LightProgramme. However, a telephone call to night editors would have stoppedthe story receiving large publicity in the morning papers.\"Flying Saucer Review admits that there may be some other more mundanereason why the Australian sighting was not carried in the London papers thefollowing morning. On the other hand, it was received in London andbroadcast by the B. B. C. in plenty of time. It is too much of a coincidencethat not one of the London dailies carried the most sensational andwidely-seen UFO sighting on record, and one that had been broadcast on a B.B. C. news bulletin!\"Why should this news item be possibly frowned upon? This was a terrificsighting seen by an enormous number of people. It must be remembered thatonly recently there had been quite a lot of press publicity in Britain over theWest Freugh R. A. F. radar sighting in Scotland, closely followed by theEnglish Channel radar sighting. This latter one had been the subject of aquestion in the House of Commons. If this Australian sighting had been giventhe publicity it deserved in the British Press, people might well have recalledthe Scottish one, and have started thinking again about the Channel affair withits unsatisfactory explanation by the Air Minister. Maybe, it was considered in'the national interest' to preserve calm by 'killing' the story.\"Continued in Part 3 - Censorship of UFO IncidentsMore Information:For further information about Leonard Stringfield's UFO Status Reports, please see reprintsbelow from the Earthfiles Archives:Status Reports I• 10/25/2005 -- Final Part 6: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 10/13/2005 -- Part 5: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 10/05/2005 -- Part 4: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 09/30/2005 -- Part 3: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 09/26/2005 -- Part 2: Retrievals of the Third Kind - Kingman, Arizona Crash• 09/25/2005 -- Part 1: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary CustodyStatus Reports II• 09/19/2005 -- Final Part 9: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/17/2005 -- Part 8: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/14/2005 -- Part 7: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/06/2005 -- Part 6: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 08/22/2005 -- Part 5: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 08/17/2005 -- Part 4: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/20/2005 -- Part 3: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/14/2005 -- Part 2: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/12/2005 -- Part 1: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New DataStatus Reports III• 07/05/2005 -- Final Part 15: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 06/20/2005 -- Part 14: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 06/17/2005 -- Part 13: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 05/10/2005 -- Part 12: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 05/04/2005 -- Part 11: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 04/19/2005 -- Part 10: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence © June 1982 by"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Leonard H.
