Andrew Kissner Return toCrash in Juarez, Mexico, on May 29, 1947he explosion at Mt. Franklin was witnessed by General Homer and reported by the ElPaso Times the following day. That explosion occurred more than ten minutes before asecond explosion at least twenty-five miles further south. General Homer dispatchedtroops to look for missile wreckage and investigate the first crash site ten to fifteen milesnorthwest of Ft. Bliss towards WSPG. [ Source: Ibid.]El Paso Times, El Paso, Texas, May 30, 1947.My sources say it was America's first surface-to-air missile strike against an unidentifiedradar object (disc) - a target that was possibly crippled by the first explosion and continuedto fly in airspace north of Ft. Bliss until it eventually impacted within one mile of the newBuena Vista Airport four miles south of downtown Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico, at 7:32p.m. local time. Elapsed time of the total event was seventeen minutes"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Maximum engine burn time for either a V-2, or a modified Wasserfall, would not haveexceeded three minutes. A three minute burn would have allowed either rocket to travel125 miles. But the impact crater was 55 miles south of WSPG Launch Row, a distancethat would have been covered by the May 15, 1947, \"Alamogordo V-2\" in slightly overfive minutes after achieving an altitude of 80 miles. What caused this May 29, 1947, eventto last for seventeen minutes?[ Editor's Note: According to the White Sands Missile Range Museum, the Juarez,Mexico rocket crash was a \"modified V-2\" Hermes II: \"The V-2 rocket was theworld's first large-scale rocket and was developed by Germany in WWII as aweapon. It had the capability of delivering a 2,000 pound warhead at supersonicspeeds to target areas 150 miles away. The Germans fired about 3,600 V-2s attargets in England and on the continent during WWII. \"The architect of the rocket was Dr. Wernher von Braun who based much of hisdesign on the pioneering work done by Dr. Robert Goddard during the 1930s nearRoswell, N.M. In late 1945, 300 railroad freight cars of V-2 components captured inEurope arrived at White Sands. From 1946 to 1952, 67 V-2 rockets were fired here.The use of these rockets launched the United States into the Space Age. \"The V-2 provided the U.S. with valuable experience in the assembly, pre flighttesting, handling, fueling, launching and tracking of large missiles. The scientificexperiments conducted aboard the V-2 gave us new information about the upperatmosphere, gave us our first photographic look back at the earth from space, gaveus the first large two-stage rocket and carried the first biological experiments intospace. \"Also, an errant, highly modified V-2, referred to as Hermes II, crashed justoutside Juarez, Mexico on May 29, 1947. No one was injured but the incidentprompted White Sands to develop a safety program...\"] Left: Hermes A-1 (Wasserfall) surface-to-air missile.

Photo provided by Andrew Kissner.he El Paso Times and The New York Times both wrote in their May 30, 1947, editionsabout the Juarez crash. Juarez eyewitnesses reported \"a blinding flash of light\" followed bya tremendous pressure wave, followed by the appearance of a mushroom cloud. Themushroom cloud excited local rumors that an atomic bomb had exploded. The concussionof the blast was sufficient to crack windows six miles north of the crash site, while anelectric clock stopped, apparently due to some blast effect at the El Paso County Sheriff'sOffice. The ground shock generated by the explosion was felt 35 miles northwest of theimpact crater.An American Airlines pilot landing at the El Paso Airport at 7:41 p.m. said that he saw\"the flames and smoke\" at his altitude. \"If I had been 30 seconds earlier, at the height Iwas flying, I would have been directly in its path.\"Whatever the object had been was not apparent - it was totally vaporized by the explosion.Small shreds of \"burned gray metal fused with molten sand and rock,\" were found aroundthe 50' x 50' x 24' crater. There was no V-2 rocket body at the bottom of the hole.Strangely, there was nothing in the hole except dirt. What crashed and made the hole?MPs stationed at Ft. Bliss and other U. S. Army personnel from WSPG rushed across theborder into Mexico in an attempt to secure the downed object. They were met at the craterby Mexican troops and summarily evicted. Mexico's General Enrique Diaz Gonzalezcommanded the Juarez Garrison. Gen. Gonzalez placed Juarez off limits to U. S. Armypersonnel for several weeks after the explosion. The entire Juarez Garrison's rocketrecovery efforts resulted in a small pile of debris that fit on top of a desk."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Front Page, El Paso Times, May 30, 1947, detonation crater in Juarez, Mexico,after May 29, 1947, WSPG launch.Two Mexican pilots landed their plane shortly before the object detonated. They reportedseeing a flash of light that temporarily blinded them. The light was followed by a deafeningexplosion. Several spectators at the crash site were interviewed by a local reported. Theeyewitnesses said they thought that a \"piece of the moon\" had fallen out of the sky. If thiswas the U. S. Army's first attempt to shoot down a flying disc, where did the disc go?There was no explanation ever given about why the launched \"V-2,\" or modifiedWasserfall SAM missile (Hermes A-1), vaporized.Col. Turner at WSPG did not see the Juarez crash site, but he told the press: \"There wereno explosive materials in V-2s. If any fuel had remained in the rocket, which was highlyunlikely, it would have simply burned.\" But there was no fire in the crater. A brush firestarted spontaneously by the heat of the explosion scorched the surrounding desert. [Sources: El Paso Times and The New York Times, May 30, 1947.] An effective cover story was immediately provided to the press and public that anotherV-2 launched from White Sands Proving Ground had gone astray, experienced a totalgyroscope failure, flew 180 degrees off course and crashed in Mexico. Interestingly, theTechnical Director at WSPG and spokesman for the V-2 program, Herbert Karsh,immediately left WSPG due to a \"family illness\" after it was announced that a V-2 hadgone off course into Mexico. In addition, Col. Turner immediately left for Washington, D.C. and did not reschedule is return to WSPG until June 9, 1947.It was never learned what the security detail dispatched by General Homer found at thesite of the first explosion on the west side of the Franklin Mountains east of Anthony, NewMexico - twelve minutes before the explosion in Mexico. Three days after the Juarez crash, the editor of the Las Cruces Sun-News reported that heand his neighbors were eyewitnesses to part of the event:\"We were caught in an undesirable circumstance Thursday night when just bychance, we looked toward the Organ Mountains in time to see the 'modified"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"V-2' rocket that caused so much excitement a few moments later by landingnear Juarez, Mexico, climb into the air. It seemed to slant a little to the south,in contrast to the normal almost vertical flight path.\"The vapor trail a V-2 leaves gives the rocket a 'toy' sky rocket appearance fora few seconds. Then the vapor trail ended, but in the gathering dusk, theorange colored exhaust could be seen and followed for a long time. The rocketclimbed high, almost straight up until it seemed to be nearly over Las Cruces -actually, it was many miles east of the city - then turned to the south.'\"Perhaps that turn to the south was because the launched rocket was a modified WasserfallSAM missile in the Hermes program, which unlike V-2 rockets, were remotely steered totheir targets by a ground crew after launch.The Las Cruces Sun-News editor continued:\"At that instant, as the rocket, its exhaust resembling another bright star,drifted past two first magnitude stars and the moon, we realized somethingwas wrong, that a news story of top importance was in the making. Weweren't alone in seeing it. Dozens near our residence could be heard shoutingto members of their families and friends to come out and see the rocket.\"We were wrong about one thing, however. The long period (comparatively)we could see the exhaust of the rocket made us believe a new type of missilewas being tested, not a V-2 which burns less than 70 seconds. Since details ofthe rocket's construction are secret, however, it is possible some Americanalterations to the German V-2 make for a longer burning period andconsequently, a greater range.\"We aren't making any apologies for the Army - it can usually take care ofitself, but the fact that two V-2s have gone astray recently (May 15 and May29, 1947) is no reason to condemn the guided missile program or to worryover the possibility that one of them may land in Las Cruces. In the first place,firings are watched carefully and malfunctions are usually noticed almostimmediately.\" [ Source: Las Cruces Sun-News, June 1, 1947.]According to the Astronomy Department at New Mexico State University, the sun wentdown on May 29, 1947, at 7:06 p.m. local time. So the western sky would still be bright at7:16 p.m. when the Las Cruces Sun-News editor said he saw \"two first magnitude stars.\"His eyewitness observation is about one month before the national headlines that pilotKenneth Arnold saw \"flying saucers\" on June 24, 1947, and others saw them innorthwestern New Mexico. The two New Mexico Navajo reservation eyewitnesses alsothought they were seeing a star, but it was broad daylight. Then after watching the \"star\"for awhile, it began moving and disappeared over the horizon to the southeast, proving itwas not a star."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Front page story, The New York Times, May 30, 1947.
