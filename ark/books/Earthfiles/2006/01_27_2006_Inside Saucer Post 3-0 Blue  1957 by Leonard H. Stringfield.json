Stringfield (out of print)Reprinted with permission in Earthfiles.com© 2006 by Linda Moulton Howe November 27, 2006 Albuquerque, New Mexico - In September 1957, Leonard H.Stringfield, finished his first book, Inside Saucer Post ... 3-0 Blue, based on his researchcooperation with the U. S. Air Defense Command Filter Center in Columbus, Ohio. Lenhad served with the 5th U. S. Air Force and was baffled by three unidentified lights that heand other crew members saw in 1945 while being transported in a C-46 near Iwo Jima.After the war, Len Stringfield seriously began to investigate the UFO phenomena. He wasDirector of the Civilian Research, Interplanetary Flying Objects organization, also knownas CRIFO, and edited ORBIT Magazine. Over nearly five decades, Len tried to learn fromfirsthand sources about government cover-ups of UFO incidents and the interaction ofnon-human intelligences with Earth. He died on December 18, 1994.At Earthfiles, with his family's permission, I have reprinted all of the UFO Crash/RetrievalStatus Reports Len wrote. Please see More Information below. In the interest of providinghistoric archives which give a context for modern UFO reports, the following is a reprint ofLen's first book in 1957 (out of print) after he collaborated with the Air Defense CommandFilter Center in Columbus, Ohio, under his assigned code name, \"3-0 Blue.\"An official publication of Civilian Research, InterplanetaryFlying Objects (CRIFO) © 1957 by Leonard H. Stringfield.This book is dedicated to my daughters, Colette and Denise,who may some day read the official version of truthabout the unidentified flying objects.FOREWORDBefore accepting the title on the cover, I considered the aptness of severalothers, such as UFO, CRIFO and the Midnight Oil, suggested by my friend,Ted Bloecher; The House of Saucers, offered by my daughter, Colette, whohas felt the intimacy of my all-consuming project; and my own, From Saucersto Ulcers, which in a sense was labeling another \"inside\" truth resulting fromthis project."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"But none of the hundreds of titles entertained could thread the CRIFO needlemore definitively than my final choice, Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue. In thesefew words is revealed the silent \"other side\" of CRIFO's operations, which hadits beginning in September 1955 when the Air Defense Command Filter Centerin Columbus, Ohio, officially designated my home as a \"UFO reporting post.\"For this duty, my home telephone was cleared and I was assigned a codename, which was in part \"...3-0 Blue.\" While only Ground Observer Corps(GOC) personnel and a few associates during CRIFO's peak years knew of thiswork with ADC, CRIFO was better known internationally as a civilian\"clearing house\" for saucer information which I edited and featured in mypublications, Newsletter/Orbit.To properly spike any misunderstanding, Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue, inspite of its swaggering name and the matter it describes, is not an exploitationof secret military data. Making certain I was in no manner violating securityby publishing certain data which referred to Post ...3-0 Blue, I wrote to theSecurity Review Branch of the Department of Defense. They replied terselythat it was \"not a matter of interest to the Department of Defense.\"While \"3-0 Blue\" may not publicly be of interest to the Department ofDefense - or for that matter, may not prove anything to the skeptic who mustsee a saucer land in his yard - I hope that the \"Inside\" part of the title will bejustified by the text, which describes the human side of the CRIFO story, pluswhat its director thinks on many controversial issues.In presenting the facts, I have also endeavored to unmask the many rumorswhich claim that the press is censored, that science is biased and themisconception that every light in the sky is a spaceship.As in the old days when facing Orbit deadlines, writing this book has had itsshare of ups and downs. As usual, my only encouragement came from theold-line of faithfuls to whom I will forever be grateful. Unfortunately, they aretoo numerous to mention. But, as I write this Foreword with the finished textbeside me, I am once again reliving the climacterics of CRIFO from itsprimordial The Incident to Iwo on to its lugubrious last lines ending this book.LEONARD H. STRINGFIELDSeptember 23, 19571 - THE INCIDENT TO IWOTo start at the beginning properly, I must go back to \"sometime\" 1950 whenmy roving half-hearted inquisitiveness about flying saucers finally broughthome a rich reward - two glowing first-hand reports each occurring within ashort time of the other. One told of a local family sitting outdoors who wereshocked by an object zooming low over their house. According to the keywitness, the object lit up the whole yards and the rooftop. The other reportdescribed a blue-colored ball swinging like a pendulum across the expanse of aridge just north of Cincinnati.To me, these reports had the ring of genuineness, mainly because the sightersthemselves were \"genuine\" people. Somehow, I thought, the press accountshad always made the sighter seem unreal! But my judgment of past events atthe time was hardly a creditable one. In no one instance can I remember doingmore than gloss over a story. In brief, my life between 1947 when saucerswere first publicized and 1950 was mainly one of \"husbanding\" and plying acareer in advertising. Remotest in my mind were spacemen and spaceships.But when the 1950 sightings reached me, all at once an incident in the pastleaped into real significance. The incident, one which had been forgotten alongwith other distasteful events of the war years, suddenly lent tremendoussupport to the suggestion that saucers were interplanetary. Accordingly, it tookon a new and ominous meaning. From it eventually grew CRIFO and theunderlying reasons for the many pessimistic tones in its publications."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Stringfie ld: \"Sketch, from memory, of three unidentified 'blobs' of lightseen from imperiled C-46 while flying from Ie Shima to Iwo Jima, south of Japan,on August 28, 1945. While this sighting is inconclusive, I have classified it alongwith other unexplained 'foo fighter' phenomena seen by airmen duringWorld War II.\" Sketch © 1957 by Leonard H. Stringfield.I have many times since 1950 tried to reconstruct the facts of the incident,hunting for details, trying to remember my reactions. But the terrors of themoment, plus the erasure of time, have left me little to go on, save only thestarkest highpoints. A check into my U. S. Army diary told me the incidentoccurred August 28, 1945, while flying from Ie Shima, near Okinawa, to IwoJima. I was being transported in a C-46, a \"flying coffin\" whose number was304. I was one of nine members of 5th Air Force personnel (with specialequipment ) assigned to occupy Atsugi Airdrome near Tokyo, Japan, prior tothe major landing forces. For the incident itself I must rely on my memory.According to a note in my diary, the passengers were Harry Berning, Stouch,W. J. Smith, Ramsey, Greenwell, Vucetich, Vaerly, Briggs, myself, and threeunknown crew members, pilot, co-pilot and navigator. In my search forpossible verification, I have located only one passenger, Harry Berning ofCincinnati. Without putting words into his mouth, I asked Berning what herecalled about the incident at Iwo?Said Berning, \"I'll remember the flight as long as I live. I was plenty scared ... Iremember our plane getting off course. We were lost. I first knew somethingwas wrong when the co-pilot came back and told us, 'We're in trouble.' Iremember our plane flying in heavy clouds and the co-pilot handed me a pairof binoculars so I could help them look for a clearing.\"When I asked Berning about seeing the three objects, he said he didn't. When Itold him I had seen them from the left side of the plane, he said he was on theright side and again emphasized, \"I was plenty scared.\" In spite of my beliefthat the objects were responsible for my plane's behavior, I hope that I haven'tover-dramatized the incident.During the flight, about midway between Ie Shima and Iwo Jima, the C-46suddenly developed trouble in the left engine, the prop feathering. As theplane dipped, sputtered oil and lost altitude, I remember looking out throughone of the portholes and to my surprise, seeing three unidentifiable blobs ofbrilliant white light, each about the size of a dime held at arm's length.The blobs were traveling in a straight line through drifts of cloud, seeminglyparallel to the C-46 and equal to its speed. I vaguely recall that when my planepulled up, the objects remained below and they disappeared into a cloud bank.All other details are hazy for I had no reason at that time to rationalize theobjects or try to identify them. Also, my prime concern at the moment was theperformance of the C-46 and my personal safety. I remember pointing out theobjects to a companion nearby, but cannot recall any unusual concern aboutthe lights on his part, for he too was more apprehensive of his safety. Theplane, without further incident, landed safely at Iwo. I remember it undergoingextensive check-up so that it would be ready and airborne for the final hop toAtsugi. No one during the stop-over mentioned the objects as I recall, nor did Ireport them, for Iwo at that time was a bustling staging area waiting for thewar officially to end.At this writing, still relying on my memory revived in 1950, I can find nomundane explanation for the three objects flying abreast of my plane high overthe Pacific. It is my opinion that the objects were propelled devices beingpossibly analogous in appearance and behavior to the popular \"foo fighter\" ofWorld War II vintage, which is still unexplained, according to Air Forcestatements. I also believe that the sudden erratic behavior of my plane was dueto a mysterious force generated by the UFOs."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"While I have often alluded to this incident in previous writings and lectures, Ihave never disclosed its details. In the early days of CRIFO I was temptedseveral times to give it top billing in the Newsletter, but then it was a matter ofkeeping up with all the latest news.In the March 1955 issue of Newsletter, which spoke out against the theorysuggesting saucers were secreet U. S. weapons, I had planned to include asection on the foo-fighter. A perfect tie-in, I thought, for such \"foo-nomena,\"as witnessed by myself, could not have possibly been earthmade. No nation, indefeat or in victory, in my opinion, would have been so foolhardy as to use asecret weapon during the delicate period of surrender. I had all my argumentslined up, good ones, I reasoned. In support of my contentions, I would lead offwith other foo fighter reports already published in saucer literature.Next was the possibility of getting two more good reports from reliablesources. I promptly secured one, the sighter having been a radio operator of aB-24 during a mission over Formosa in 1945. His report described a verticalchain of luminous globes, one following the other in a spiral climb toward hisaircraft. Showing no menace, they continued to climb out of view. When areply to my inquiry about the other report finally arrived, I was told by thiscorrespondent that the information had best not be revealed because ofsecurity. Pressed by time, I dropped the matter thinking I would later devotean entire issue to this subject. But like other proposals such as lunar findingsand the little bipeds, the foo-fighters never got to print. In the late months ofCRIFO, I decided to keep my experience confidential until I would somedaywrite my book.By 1952, the year of the wildest saucer flap, I was pretty well sold on theInterplanetary Theory. According to Edward J. Ruppelt in The Report OnUnidentified Flying Objects, \"a flap is a condition, or situation, or state ofbeing, of a group of people characterized by an advanced degree of confusionthat has not quite yet reached panic proportions ...\" Max Miller in FlyingSaucers, Fact or Fiction, says: \"When applied to UFOs, a flap designatesanything from a 'flurry' to a 'panic' of sighting reports and the resultanteffects.\"About fifty miles northeast of Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio,is Wright Patterson AFB in Fairborn, Ohio. Norw ood is a suburb northeast of Cincinnati.On July 25, 1952, while the nation was in a tizzy over the Washington blipincident (UFOs on radar over the Capitol), I saw something. It was a large,orange teardrop-shaped object zipping soundlessly across the night sky. OtherCincinnatians who saw it said it changed direction. Reporting it to the press, Ialso announced that I was forming Civilian Investigating Group for Aerial"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Phenomena. But while CIGAP did not go very far as a fellowship in research,its existence in name only did manage to stir up local interest. It put me ontelevision where I first met the Reverend Gregory Miller, the key person to themost fact-rooted case on CRIFO record. It also brought in several good currentreports. But, out of the hundreds of reports reaching me during the 1952 flap,only a handful were worthy of investigation. Most were just lights in the sky -and, as the Air Force would say - could be simply explained if more data wereobtainable. More than once, I too saw lights in the sky during this big flap, butlooking back critically, I cannot say the lights were saucers.As my files grew, so did my exasperation with the official policy of silence andcontradiction. Like others \"all stirred up,\" I began writing letters. One,published in the Cincinnati Enquirer, won me $5.00 as the best letter of theyear. In this missive, I slapped at Dr. Harlow Shapely, Director of the HarvardObservatory, for his statement calling \"saucers a lot of complete nonsense.\" Inanother letter published in the December 1952 issue of Tr ue magazine, Iwrote: \"...I like your forward, fact-rooted, go-to-hell approach on the subject....It seems rather curious how the general run of newspapers and certainnational magazines neatly avoid the facts and run to the apron strings of someexpert who will tell them that saucers are cobwebs.\"While my letter to Tr ue was rather pointless, it did bring me several keyletters. One was from Bill Culmer of Robinson, Illinois, an energeticfact-hunter, with lots of leads, a level head and an above-average sighting tohis credit. Culmer, who died September 20, 1954, was indeed the spark ofinspiration which led me to take the bull by the horns. In the course of ourletter writing, we parlayed the idea and the need for a research organizationwith a factual bulletin. 2 - CRIFO IS BEGATDuring my exchange of letters with Culmer, I was a reasonably normalhusband and father. By day, I was the advertising manager of a nationallyknown manufacturer. After hours, I worked my hobbies. My favorite lair wasmy greenhouse. I would spend hours there, puttering with exotic philodendron,anthurium and fern. When I tired of this, I turned to my oils and brush - ordabbled in things scientific such as astronomy or paleontology. Saucers,however, were winning over.One day to my sorrow, I found that my avidity for saucers and neglect of mygreenhouse had caused the demise of Anthurium veitchii, my rarest and mostprized aroid. Perhaps this was my turning point, for it was a week later that Idecided to take up the saucer hue and cry. On March 10, 1954, I foundedCivilian Research, Interplanetary Flying Objects (CRIFO), and began workingon a format for a monthly publication. A bulletin, I thought, would serve tokeep all my correspondents informed. I decided to print only 200 copies.Then in a radio newscast of May 18, 1954, Frank Edwards, who hadchampioned saucers since 1950 over the airwaves, urged his ten millionlisteners to write for CRIFO's Newsletter. Twenty-four hours later, the life ofLeonard H. Stringfield was changed! What had been a simple pursuit eruptedinto a brute of big business. I ate my dinner at the telephone and entertainedguests while I typed. Bookkeeping nearly replaced romance and my only restwas in the sanctum of the bathroom. By the end of the month, nearly 6000letters of inquiry had been processed in my basement, which had becomeCRIFO's headquarters. My staff was my wife, Dell, conscripted from thekitchen; my daughters Colette (6) and Denise (4), who licked postage stamps;my mother; and my friend, Herb Clark with the Ground Observer Corps(GOC). Letters from enthusiasts everywhere in the world ranged from retiredgenerals, pilots, engineers, newspapermen, doctors and lawyers, businessmen,members of a nudist colony, a woman who had seen an \"unidentified flyingman\" - and one lost soul who, enclosing a dollar, left only one return addresson the moon."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Landslide of mail following the Frank Edwards radio broadcast of May 18, 1954,at which time he told his \"10,000,000 Americans\" to write to CRIFO for its Newsletter.Only a couple of weeks later in June 1954, an Air Force spokesman said that their \"saucer\"mail only came in trickles.

Coming to mind are many happy moments, like beingthe toast of many civic or social groups; like feeling honored by a letter fromher Majesty, the Queen of England, or Sir Winston Churchill, or LordMountbatten of Burma - or like being reminded in a letter from a subscriber,\"We especially appreciated your frank and objective reporting.\" And, comingto mind are the moments of despair, like the day I drove to Lawrenceburg,Indiana, to investigate a saucer that landed. I found instead a Fourth of Julyspin wheel. But out of each month's gross of evidence came a rewarding net ofvital information - information that made CRIFO a Pentagon-in-miniaturewhich sought to serve the public's appetite for truth.Air Force heads knew this. Perhaps that is why four dapper gentlemen in thesummer of 1954 visited my home with such obvious urgency and asked suchpointblank questions. Perhaps that is also why Major General John A.Samford, USAF, then Director of Intelligence, wrote me on March 16, 1956:\"The Air Force greatly appreciates the interest which you and yourorganization, as well as others, have taken in the Unidentified Flying Objectprogram. The success of this program has been, in part, due to the excellentcooperation of such individuals and groups in submitting UFO reports forconsideration either directly or through various publications. These reportshave become an important part of the UFO picture. A continuation of thisassistance is indeed welcome ...In conclusion, please accept our thanks foryour interest in this matter and be assured that we are always glad to receivecontributions such as yours.\" 3 - CRIFO GOES \"ON DUTY\"It was a warm evening on September 11, 1955, when I presented my simplecivilian case for the interplanetary flying saucer. My audience was themembers of the Ground Observer Corps (GOC), which represented all posts inHamilton County, Ohio. I remember while driving to the meeting place at theAnderson Township School in Forestville, remarking to Herb Clark, then ChiefObserver for that area's GOC post, that the recent upswing of saucer reports inthe county was causing concern in the Air Force.The U. S. Air Force had released a Special Report 14, on October 25, 1955,which indicated by map that Hamilton County, Ohio, and environs rankedthird highest in the nation in frequency of UFO reports during the period 1947to 1952.During this upswing, my telephone jangled at all hours. Most calls were routinereports describing \"lights in the sky.\" Others, however, were voices soundingurgent. \"It's right over my house. What should I do?\" exclaimed one lady,alone and frightened in Mt. Washington. I suggested that she call the sheriffand I would report to the Air Force. The weirdest, perhaps, was a frantic callfrom Anderson's Ferry. A male voice cried, \"It's a big light and it's landing in my backyard.\" Then a companion's voice broke in, \"Something's coming out ofthe bottom. Hurry!\" Promising to call back, the receiver slammed down andthat was the last we heard from Anderson's Ferry. Other calls, less desperate,but giving me time to run outdoors - sometimes clad only in shorts andbinoculars - told of flying quoits, footballs and triangles. Usually too late for"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the good ones, I always managed to make it in time to see Venus sinkinggibbously on the horizon or Arcturus \"bobbing around\" behind a veil of ruffledatmosphere, or a \"whole group of saucers\" which were nothing more than thePleiades.Unknown to most callers was my new assignment with the U. S. Air Force. OnSeptember 9, 1955, the Air Defense Command - probably triggered intodecision by an incident occurring the night before - informed me that my hometelephone had been cleared to report UFOs through coded channels directly tothe Filter Center in Columbus, Ohio. Wanted were up-to-the-minute sightingsreaching me from the greater Cincinnati area. But, even before this officialclearance, I had reason to be in quick communication with the Filter Center.On August 5, having already been briefed on procedure by GOC, I reportedthe flight of a spectacular UFO, large and brilliant - seen by thousands andmyself - coursing over the city. And then, on September 8, 1955 - the triggerincident - I reported that a local skywatcher, Gordon Zerbo, had phonedasking me to check a large object, maybe a \"satellite\" in space, which he wasseeing through his telescope. I was eager to investigate, for coming to mindwas another large object or satellite - nearly 10,000 feet in diameter - whichhad glowed over Cincinnati skies in the beam of a powerful searchlight during1949-1950. When I first glimpsed through Zerbo's telescope, which peeredthrough a narrow clearing in a clump of treetops, I was frankly puzzled. Infocus was a gaseous orange ball which appeared to be spinning. For almosttwo hours, I watched the object which seemed fixed in the sky, and for twohours I remained in close touch with the Filter Center, reporting every newdevelopment.On the second night, I began to suspect an astronomical oversight and on thethird night had solved the mystery - the satellite was Polaris, the \"fixed\" NorthStar! The object which seemed so large and gaseous was only an opticalillusion - poor lens. But myriads of other UFOs reported during this turbulentperiod were less easily explained away. Knowing this was Intelligence atWright-Patterson AFB who, I later learned, was worried about the \"satellite.\"Most calls, significantly, came from the thinly populated perimeter of the cityof Cincinnati. Many told of low flying objects; others of objects hovering nearthe ground. A few callers, speaking guardedly, told of frightening encounterswith ugly little bipeds. In one area, just west of Cincinnati, UFO reports wereso heavy that people were afraid to leave their homes after dark, and mencarried firearms."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Cincinnati Times Star, October 20, 1955, describing UFO activityin Western Cincinnati that concerned the U. S. Air Force.It was in the midst of this ominous activity that I opened my lecture. Sittingbeside me near the podium were 1st Lt. Edward Thorne and Sgt. James Usseryof the Air Defense Command Filter Center. Before me were the rows ofaudience. To ease matters, I tried a little stratagem. Whipping a hanky from mypocket on which were smears of my wife's lipstick, I pretended to wipe mybrow. Then, looking surprised at the smears, I commented triumphantly, \"Well,at least my wife loves me! In spite of saucers, she still thinks I'm sane.\"Nobody laughed! Most members had seen saucers; they were in no jokingmood. Nor was I really, and I lost no time hammering at my strongest links ofevidence. I highlighted the Norwood Searchlight Incident.[ Editor's Note: 1949 UFO Incident, Norwood, Ohio, suburb ofCincinnati - Between August 19, 1949 and March 10, 1950,police, military officials, scientists, clergy and civilians in theNorwood, Ohio, region reported ten visual sightings of a strange,glowing, large aerial object. Photos were taken on October 23,1949, by Norwood Police Sgt. Leo Davidson, and two reels ofmotion picture film were kept in the possession of ReverendGregory Miller, last seen at WCPO Channel 9 TV studios in 1952.Still frames from the movie film were given to investigatorLeonard Stringfield and published in his book Saucer Post ...3-0Blue.There was also the alleged observation of the object by searchlightoperator Donald R. Berger, who kept detailed log notes about hisobservations. The sightings began in earnest after 11:00 p.m. onAugust 19, 1949. Berger's logs indicate that he observed the UFOfrom 8:15 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. Cincinnati residents saw it until 6:30a.m. the following morning. The public argument about movietheater searchlights creating the object seems contradicted by anall night event. Also, one weather bureau official said in the early"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"morning he saw two objects that looked like \"two weather ceilingballoons\" that weren't moving despite a wind speed of 25 to 32miles per hour.Even the 1949 Berger logs stated: \"When I moved the searchlightaway, the object continued to glow,\" which might have been asecond object. Berger's logs were kept by Rev. Gregory Milleruntil 1954. Rev.

My final hammer blows were directed at the"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"press, which I accused of muzzling saucer stories. While citing one silencedcase, Lt. Thorne discreetly slipped a note onto my podium on which he hadwritten, \"The press is here.\"Indeed! No sooner had I closed my question and answer period than JimJohnson, a youngish Cincinnati Post reporter, rushed me from the millingaudience. He was visibly stirred by my scorn of the press and equally stirredto get a hot story.Eastern Hills, Ohio, Journal,September 23, 1955.Reporter Johnson kept picking at a reference I had made to censorship, a wordI had used loosely in answering someone's question about the hidden saucerevidence. It was obvious that Johnson was planning to feature this angle.Despite my objections, and later attempts to reason with him, even to point outa misquote in his notes, he sputtered defiance. He showed the sameimplacability when he finally wheedled me into surrendering a photograph Ihad shown the audience. And so it was that the young reporter departed withhis hot story. Next day I looked for the Johnson blast in the Post, but to mysurprise there was not even a squib about my talk, or the GOC meeting."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Curious, I phoned the city desk. I asked about the story. The reply: \"Decidedagainst it.\" I asked about the photograph. The reply: \"Too hazy. It would showtoo much grain in a blowup.\"Back after my GOC talk, after the last loitering members left the auditorium, Iapproached Lt. Thorne, who was stuffing papers into his folio and said, \"Ididn't tell them everything.\" I hastened to explain that I was urged before thelecture by Walter Paner, then supervisor of Hamilton County GOC, to \"tell allI knew about flying saucers.\" When I saw Lt. Thorne looking at mequizzically, I added that Paner had assured me that my talk had the officialnod from \"somebody higher up.\" Lt. Thorne was silent as we moved towardthe exit. Then as we emerged outdoors, I said that it was not my intention toundersell my theories, or the GOC, but I did renege on some of my bestevidence about the Norwood Searchlight incident. I then told him that certainfacts known by me about that case were confidential and must remain so.These facts, I said, clinch my argument for the interplanetary saucer.\"Someday you may be proved right,\" said Lt.
