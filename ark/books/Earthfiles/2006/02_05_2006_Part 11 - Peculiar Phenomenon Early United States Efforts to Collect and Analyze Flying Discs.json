But those spectacular Sacramento Mountains rising steeply from the valley floor couldinterrupt radar radio signals at White Sands where radar research and the best anti-aircraftsurveillance and tracking technology were developed during WWII. Radar research fellunder (MJ-2) Dr. Vannevar Bush's OSRD. [ Source: The New York Times, October 6,1948.] Any object that stood in the way of radio waves emitted from a transmitting unitwould be reflected back to a receiving station. If something stood behind the reflectingobject, it was essentially invisible to the radar operator. Radar is a \"line of sight\"surveillance and tracking system. That is the primary reason that up through today, thesimplest way to evade detection by ground-based radar is to fly at low altitude near thecontour of the earth, down canyons, around mountain ranges and tree top level. It's alsoone of the reasons that the Tularosa Basin was selected for the missile test range. Anyattempt by an adversary to uses ground-based radar to record a rocket test - assuming thatan adversary could locate a radar site within the vicinity of WSPG - would not be able tocollect telemetry until the rocket appeared above the crest of the mountains.

Hegraduated from Tufts College with a B.S. in 1913. He earned a joint doctoratein engineering from Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology (MIT) in 1917. He returned to MIT in 1919 to become aprofessor (192332) and vice president and dean of engineering (193238). Hewas elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE)in 1924. During this period, he devised a network analyzer to simulate theperformance of large electrical networks. He is best known for his design ofthe differential analyzer, an analog computer that could solve differentialequations with as many as 18 independent variables. From 1939 until 1955 hewas president of the Carnegie Institution, Washington, D.C. 1890 - 1974.Vannevar Bush, Ph.D., with his differential analyzer, 1932-1938.He is also listed as MJ-2 on President Harry S. Truman's Special Studies Group concerningextraterrestrial biological entities interacting with Earth. From 1941 to 1945 he was also the director of the U.S. Office of ScientificResearch and Development (OSRD), where he administered the U.S. war effort toutilize and advance military technology. He personally advised President Roosevelton technological matters and organizing the nation's academic researchers to attackmilitary problems. He directed such programs as the development of the first atomicbomb, the perfection of radar, and the mass production of sulfa drugs andpenicillin. In 1955 he returned to MIT, retiring in 1971. From 1957 to 1962 he wasChairman of Merck and Co., the large pharmaceutical company, based in NewJersey. He received numerous honors including the Lamme Medal from the AIEE(1935), and the AIEE Edison Medal in 1943 \"For his contribution to theadvancement of electrical engineering, particularly through the development of newapplications in mathematics to engineering problems, and for his eminent service tothe nation in guiding the war research programs.\" He was awarded the National"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Medal of Science, presented by President Lyndon B. Johnson in January 1964. Bush wrote Endless Horizons (1975) and Modern Arms and Free Men(1985), although he is probably best known for his July 1945 article, As We MayThink and Endless Frontier. He passed away on June 28, 1974, in Belmont,Massachusetts. ]If it were possible to set up a radar, enemies would only be able to gather limitedintelligence and none related to the critical \"boost\" or \"terminal\" phase of the test. Thisprinciple also worked in reverse, however. Any object that went past or below the peaks ofone of WSPG's mountain ranges would also be invisible to WSPG radar in the early years.

Army-Ordnance, Enemy Equipment Intelligence Section (EEIS),in front of a German Wasserfall rocket modified by the American Project PAPERCLIPat WSPG and called an Hermes A-1 surface-to-air missile. Major Holger Toftoy, Chief of U. S. Army-Ordnance, Enemy Equipment IntelligenceSection and Dr. Vannevar Bush (MJ-2), Director of OSRD, worked together prior to thewinter of 1944. Bush's Combined Intelligence Objectives Subcommittees (CIOS) identifiedenemy technology and research facilities in occupied Europe and Germany which theUnited States found useful. These were judged to possess high scientific value and wouldbe used in the post war period to refine and advance the cutting edge of U. S. weaponstechnology. [ Sources: The Nuclear Oracles © Sylves, p. 253; Science With A Vengeance© Devorkin.] Toftoy's missions, ordered by OSRD and the JCS and supported by U. S. Army Ordnanceand the OSS, were to capture, secure, defend and hold high value scientific facilities andawait the arrival of technical scientific teams who would sort and evaluate on the groundwhat had been captured. The booty would then be disassembled, crated and sent wherever(MJ-2) Dr. Bush's OSRD directed. Toftoy became a legend within his area of expertisewhich was based upon his secret wartime exploits in Europe. In 1947, Holger Toftoy livedin two places: El Paso, Texas and Las Cruces, New Mexico. Toftoy also worked in twoplaces: the Fort Bliss Military Reservation, Texas, and WSPG, New Mexico. [ Source: TheNuclear Oracles © Sylves, p. 102.] Operation 'PAPERCLIP\" was the last in a series of covert operations to recover enemyscientific equipment in the European Theater of Operations during WWII. It was precededby Operations 'WILDHORN,' 'CROSSBOW,' 'OVERCAST,' and \"BACKFIRE.\" ProjectPAPERCLIP's reported scope required securing sufficient components to construct onehundred V-2 missiles. That demanded gathering the rocket blueprints, technical manuals,their control and test facilities and scientific personnel from Germany and moving allcovertly to WSPG. Only now does it appear that PAPERCLIP's mission also includedmoving German Wasserfall surface-to-air missile systems to Ft. Bliss, Texas and Project\"KINGMAN\" in Utah.

S. Navy, theCoast Guard, and U. S. Customs. That was truly a \"joint\" JCS operation. Germany's Underground Mittelwerk and V-2s In March 1945, Toftoy was ordered to form his group. In April 1945, Toftoy received wordthat the German rocket facilities at the Mittelwerk had been overrun. At the same time, hewas told that the Allies would be forced to surrender the area to the Russians withinseveral weeks as part of the Potsdam Agreement between the western allies and the U.S.S.R. Toftoy's T-Force descended on Mittelwerk and within 120 days removed 360 tons ofGerman rocket components from the Russian area. [ Source: United States Civilian SpaceProgram 1958-1978, p. 151.] Most of the components were shipped back to U. S. ArmyOrdnance and OSRD at Ft. Bliss, Texas, and WSPG, New Mexico. Only now do we knowthat Toftoy also shipped Wasserfall surface-to-air missiles to join the AMC/AEC\"KINGMAN\" site at Wendover, Utah.

The main V-2 assembly line waslocated in an underground factory called Mittelwerk that was excavatedbeneath Kohnstein Mountain, about 2 km southwest of the town ofNeidersachswerfen. The Dora concentration camp (later called Mittelbau KZ),where most of the Mittelwerk workers were imprisoned, was located on thesouthwest edge of the Kohnstein, near the southern portals of of Mittelwerktunnels A and B.\"Immediately after the war, while America was building its own rocketprogram on the foundations of German technology, the horrible reality ofslave labor used during V-2 production was concealed from the public. Onlyin the past 10 years, as prisoners' histories have been published, have webegun to understand more. Estimates put the number of prisoners used by theGermans for V-2 production at - Mittelbau at more than 60,000. Over 25,000of these were killed either by beatings, starvation, and sickness in thecomplex, or by the brutal efforts of the SS to relocate them before theAmericans arrived in April, 1945. We now know that many of the mostshocking \"concentration camp pictures\" that are seared into our commonconsciousness from this era were taken by U.S. troops as they entered theMittelbau camps.\" ]Above: Outside the Mittelwerk entrance which was excavated beneath Kohnstein Mountain, Germany,about 2 kilometers southwest of the town of Neidersachswerfen.Below: Inside one of the Mittelwerk tunnels with a rocket part in foreground and propped up fins for V-2rockets."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Project Hermes, ordered by the JCS after being supported by OSRD and managed by U. S.Army Ordnance, was a missile research and development effort to design and build rocketssimilar to Germany's General Electric's research laboratory at Lynn, Massachusetts, wasthe principal contractor on the effort through the California Institute of Technology (CIT).V-2s had been successfully employed to bomb London and a number of other Europeancapitals between 1943 and March 28, 1945. [ Source: Science With A Vengeance ©Devorkin.] The vision of the OSRD's CIOS panel in respect to V-2s in 1944 was that a ballistic missilefitted with a nuclear warhead such as those developed by LASL might represent theultimate future strategic weapon. General Electric would design and fabricate Hermesmissile systems. It is now known that Project Hermes involved more than the developmentof the German V-2 model. Project Hermes also commissioned the development of otherGerman rockets. The preponderance of the published literature suggests that Hermes was aproject to simply develop one rocket - one similar to the V-2 ballistic missile. Today, it isknown that the first Hermes A-1 was not a duplicate of a V-2. It was a duplicate of theWasserfall surface-to-air missile. [ Source: United States Civilian Space Program1958-1978, p. 167.] This fact would not be known if not for a NASA administrator who in 1981 mentioned it ina Congressional testimony. Yet, throughout 1995 literature related to the Hermes A-1, it iscalled a duplicate of the German V-2 rocket. Why the misinformation? The Wasserfall surface-to-air missile system was intended to defend high value militaryand political targets from air attack. The U. S. nuclear weapons stockpile could certainlybe defined as a high value target, one that justified the use of the most sophisticatedanti-aircraft systems to protect it from a potential air strike. The AEC was particularlyconcerned with air threats and constructed all of its storage and final warhead assemblyareas underground for that reason.

One of the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"underground storage areas under construction in July 1947 for WATERSUPPLY waswithin 100 miles of the Corona/Roswell flying disc crash site. (MJ-4) General Nathan Twining's AMC was responsible for the development of improvedsurface-to-air missiles for the JCS. President Truman improved air security substantially byexecuting an executive order on January 18, 1948, which banned all flights over AECfacilities at Oak Ridge, Tennessee; the Hanford Engineering Works at Richmond,Washington; and Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in northern New Mexico.

Porter of General Electric's Hermes Group met Toftoy in Europe during the summerof 1945 and reviewed progress on PAPERCLIP. Porter had a proprietary interest in whatwas being collected in Germany. Also in Europe at the time was Ernst Krause.. Krausebecame head of the Naval Research Laboratory's ballistic missile efforts and becamechairman of OSRD's V-2 Research Panel in 1946. [ Source: NYT, January 18, 1948, FrontPage.] Krause and Porter roamed around occupied Germany together during the summer of 1945to gather information and to interrogate German scientists about guidance systems, gyros,inertial systems and to buy components from German manufacturers who wereencouraged not to disassemble their wartime production facilities for rocket components. [Sourc e: Science With A Vengeance © Devorkin, p. 47.] These would be useful to OSRD,Army and Navy Ordnance and the AMC to advance the U. S. military space scienceprogram. Interrogations of German rocket scientists sorted out those that would beparticularly useful versus those of lessor value. Those individuals that were of interest toOSRD would have a PAPERCLIP attached to their file. The human approach was simplefor the scientists that the U. S. wanted. The question: \"Would you prefer to go to the U. S.with U. S. Army sponsorship? Or would you prefer Russia under Red Army sponsorship?'The questions put that way usually achieved the desired result. German scientists beganarriving at Ft. Bliss, Texas, at Toftoy's EEIS center in the winter and spring of 1946through Juarez, Mexico. In 1947, the entire research component of New Mexico's military complex and the AtomicEnergy Commission laboratory system (LASL at Los Alamos; the AFSWP at Sandia Base;LASL's Z Division in Albuquerque at Sandia Base; and WSPG) operated directly underthe highest military and civilian authority in the United States, which were OSRD, JRDBand the JCS, U. S. Army Ordnance, and Enemy Equipment Intelligence Section (EEIS)under command of the legendary Holger Toftoy, based at Ft. Bliss, Texas. The flying disc intelligence was focused on the one area in the U. S. where any \"peculiarphenomenon\" that disrupted weapons research activity was immediately a matter ofconcern to the JCS and the President. In this remote region of the southwest, flying discshad flown directly into the primary scientific and military units that collected advancedweapons technology for every element of the United States government. The Americangoal was to develop high altitude weapons systems. U. S. Army radar technicians noticed on May 29, 1947, that the phenomenon hadappeared from ground level.
