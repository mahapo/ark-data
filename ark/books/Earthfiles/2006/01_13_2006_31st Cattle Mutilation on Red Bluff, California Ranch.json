A few miles north, a rancher in Anderson, California, had cattle mutilations in 1999 and2004.January 13, 2006 Red Bluff, California - For the past half century, unusual deaths thatlaw enforcement call \"animal mutilations\" have been reported around the world. Bothdomestic animals and wild game have been affected, especially horses and cattle.Ranchers and law enforcement have long been puzzled because animals are found with thesame pattern of hide and tissue removed usually without blood from the head, sexualorgans, and vaginal/rectal area. There are no signs of struggle or tracks around the deadanimals, not even the animal's own tracks. That peculiar fact provoked law enforcementlong ago to wonder if the mutilators came in and out of pastures from the sky?Many ranchers have also speculated that their mutilated animals have been cut with lasersbecause of the bloodless nature of the excisions. In fact, pathology exams over the yearshave confirmed in some mutilations that cuts were made with heat energy of some kind.But another puzzle is the lack of carbon residue at the heated cut lines. Earth life iscarbon-based and normal laser surgery always leaves some black carbon on surgicalexcisions which can be seen under a microscope.January 17, 1997, Barton Ranch - Pure Hemoglobin Particles On Mutilated BullBiophysicist W. C. Levengood in Grass Lake, Michigan, thinks a very complex set ofenergies are involved. He began studying soil and grass samples from mutilation sites. Asimilar pattern of respiration changes in plant cell mitochondria were repeatedly confirmedaround animal mutilation sites, including grass collected near the rectum of a mutilated bulldiscovered in northern California on the Jean and Bill Barton Ranch in Red Bluff, onJanuary 17, 1997, south of Redding.Dead and mutilated 2,000 pound bull discovered January 17, 1997, by owners Jean and Bill Bartonon their winter ranch near Red Bluff, California.

Photograph on January 18 © 1997 by Jean Barton.The Bartons were checking their cattle from horseback at their winter ranch when theyfound their 2,000-pound Black Angus bull dead and mutilated in a remote field strewnwith volcanic rocks which can only be reached on foot or horseback.Field investigator Jean Bilodeaux discovered an unusual substance on the bull's chest andtesticles that was black and hard. Biophysicist Levengood confirmed the substance waspure bovine hemoglobin that could only be produced by complex laboratory centrifugeprocesses. He told me:\"To do this, you need to break down the cell membranes to the erythrocytes andleukocytes to remove the hemoglobin molecules. That requires a laboratoryprocedure with very precise biochemical steps. It's totally incomprehensible how thehemoglobin could be removed in the middle of the night out in the middle of apasture and be separated from all the other cellular components and some of itsprayed on the dead animal.\"Dehydrated fragment from black particles found on chest hide of mutilated bull discovered in Red Bluff,California,January 17, 1997.

Analytical chemistry analysis determined this ispure bovine hemoglobin. Photomicrograph © 1997 by W. C.

A veterinarian took photographs of thatolder cow and told the rancher there was no explanation for how the animal's jaw flesh,eyeballs, udder, rectal and vaginal tissue had been so precisely and bloodlessly removed.Then in August 2004, the newborn heifer suffered the same fate.Newborn female calf found dead and mutilated mid-day on August 7, 2004,on the Harry and Carole Hawes ranch in Anderson, California.

Then over in the stomach area werestraight edges of the cuts on the hide. Then when I looked at the head, the jawbone wasclean of flesh and hide, just like the very first crossbred cow ten years ago that got mestarted (with the ranch cattle mutilations). Then when I looked closer, there was noeyeball, although it was not cored out like some of them have been. Above: Circle of flesh removed around bull's rectum.

But this one, probably because of theear tag, was just a clip.Bull's ear tag # 726 intact in right ear that was cut in halfwith straight line. Photograph © 2006 by Jean Barton.WHAT ABOUT THE TONGUE AND TEETH?I believe all the teeth were there. I'm starting now to see if there are missing teeth, but Ithink they were all there. But the tongue was completely gone because they always aregone, at least the ones I find.IT APPEARS THAT THIS BULL THAT IS ABOUT 2-YEARS-OLD IS AT THEBOTTOM OF A HILL OR CLIFF AND THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT OF ROCKSAROUND.Our cattle range on rocks here east of Red Bluff and the bull is lying down near the bottomof the gully. It's a dry stream bed most of the year, but we've had lots of rain and there iswater around the bull's body.HAD THERE BEEN OTHER CATTLE GRAZING IN THAT AREA?Yes, all our cows were grazing in that several hundred acre field.IS HE THE ONLY ANIMAL THAT SEEMED TO BE AFFECTED BY WHATEVERHAPPENED?As of January 5, 2006, yes. But we lost a bull last year in the same field on January 4,2005. Then earlier, back in January 1997, we lost another bull in that field.IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT JANUARY?I have no idea why we have lost two of them in January. I think the other one was inFebruary. High Strangeness in Barton Ranch Cattle DeathsCOULD YOU GIVE A HISTORY OF WHAT IS NOW 31 UNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHSON YOUR RANCH IN RED BLUFF, CALIFORNIA, OVER THE LAST DECADE?The first two were cows that had just calved about three weeks before and they each hadbull calves. That was on our summer grazing in the Lassen National Forest on PapooseMeadow. They were the first two that we really knew what we were finding.The very first animal that we lost up there in Susanville when the vet came out with thedeputy sheriff and did a necropsy of the two cows. It was the laser cut with no blood.That's the other thing but it's so common to me that I just never mentioned it. No blood!WHICH IS CLASSIC WITH THE UNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHS LINKED TOEXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES IN OUR GOVERNMENT'S OWNLEAKED DOCUMENTS. BUT WHEN I HAVE GONE TO UNIVERSITIES THATSTUDY PREDATOR ATTACKS, YOU FIND THAT THERE IS BLOOD ALL OVER THEPLACE IN ALL OF THEIR PHOTOS.Oh, yes. And the twitching of the front legs and hind legs as they die. My cattle, they justdrop. There is no movement of the legs.NO SIGN OF STRUGGLE ON THE GROUND.Correct. Since then, we've had newborns. They've never walked on the ground! They wereinstantly killed.We've had a young calf dropped through trees because he had his legs intertwined with"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"tree branches. There is also a neighbor up in the Anderson, California, area that youinvestigated his cows. And they seem to have been dropped from trees.RIGHT. AND IN MY BOOK, GLIMPSES OF OTHER REALITIES, VOL. II, ONE OFTHE FEW EYEWITNESSES TO HIGHLY STRANGE LUMINOUS OBJECTS IN THESKY AND BEAMS OF LIGHT DESCRIBED THE CRATERS IN THE GROUNDWHERE MUTILATED ANIMALS HAD DROPPED FROM THOSE GLOWINGLIGHTS INTO THE GROUND HARD ENOUGH TO CREATE CRATERS AROUNDTHEIR BODY.I don't know about craters, but we did have that horned cow of our neighbor's that wasrunning with our cattle up in the mountains and she was dropped and the horn wasembedded in the ground. I could not lift her head to pull that horn out. It took two men topull the horn out of the ground.She was cooked! By that, I mean, the interior of her body instead of moist contents wasdry like corn flakes. And there was black searing on the bones, the rib bones, and the hairaround the cut.DID YOU HAVE A VETERINARIAN OR LAW ENFORCEMENT LOOK AT THATANIMAL?No. Wait, we did, because the tracker came to that one. He was a professional tracker andhe came with U. S. Forest personnel or deputy sheriff one or the other. He walked aroundlooking for signs of cars or man or something because it was a fresh meadow that we hadjust put the cows in within the week. So, it was not beaten down very much. He could notfind anything not even coyote tracks.We've had yearlings, oh heifer calves three months old that were bouncing around one dayon the feeding strip one day when we were feeding hay and the next day they were dead.That one we sent to the U. of Calif. Davis Veterinary Lab for forensics. And they said itjust died.THEY HAD NO EXPLANATION FOR THE CUTS?No. Or the fact that the intestine on the outer 16 inches was missing. But it was dead andthey presented us with a bill, so now we just don't bother with that. To have the localdeputy sheriff come out 'Oh, that's a coyote.' (laughs) When they all have the same cuts, itjust isn't worthwhile of my time (to contact authorities anymore).We've lost oh, the beautiful yearling heifer. She was just a gorgeous one of my pets atEagle Lake. You came up and investigated. That one was really weird because within twoweeks, her skull was bare of all flesh and hide.And the yellow jackets they were biting us when we were away from the body. But whenwe were close to the body, we were immune. And she also had the hair on the back of herneck and the center of her back standing upright.AND WE ALL TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOMERESIDUAL ENERGY TO KEEP THE YELLOW JACKETS AWAY FROM THATBODY.Yes. Everybody got bit as soon as they got away from that animal. That was really strange. Who? - or What? - Is Killing and MutilatingBarton Ranch Cattle?WHAT IS IT ABOUT THESE ANIMALS SINCE 1995 THAT HAVE CONVINCED YOUTHAT PREDATION SUCH AS COYOTES CANNOT BE THE EXPLANATION?We had a very intelligent deputy sheriff up in Lassen County who had gone on the internetand read about cattle mutilations down in Alabama. They had the same things missing thatour two cows were missing. You started putting the pieces together and then I met you. Iwas really resistant at the time, but you wanted grass samples for Dr. Levengood. Thosegrass samples kind of convinced me that something strange was going on.A lady on the west side of Red Bluff called and had me come out and look at the picturesshe had taken of a deer that was killed. It was within the city limits of the town, but it wasin a shed and it was missing the rectum and various parts, just like a cow.We have some oak trees along the creek. We used to calve our cows in this 30-acre field.This young calf - he was maybe a week old or so - and we found him in the bottom of a"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"gully. He was underneath a tree, but the way the sticks were it was just impossible to havedied with his legs like that because one part of the stick was on top of his front leg and theother was underneath his hind legs.THE IMPLICATION IS THAT HE HAD FALLEN THROUGH THE BRANCHES OFTHE TREE?Well, that's my guess.YOU'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS AT LEAST TEN YEARS. YOU'RE LOST 31ANIMALS. HOW MUCH LONGER CAN THIS GO ON WITHOUT SOMETHINGBREAKING ABOUT THE ACTUAL TRUTH OF SOMETHING THAT IS NOT HUMANINVOLVED WITH ALL THESE ANIMAL DEATHS AROUND THE WORLD?I imagine it will be another generation.BECAUSE?It's something that is not politically correct to talk about.AND TO THINK THAT HUMANS WILL NOT ADDRESS IT FOR WHAT IT IS?Well, Linda, you're about the only person that I know of that addresses this subject andlet's us know about it. I don't read about the Argentina and Chile and other SouthAmerican countries and Australia having cattle mutilations. Except in Earthfiles.com. Extraterrestrial Biological Entities?WHEN YOU PERSONALLY THINK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF EXTRATERRESTRIALBIOLOGICAL ENTITIES BEING INVOLVED WITH ALL OF THESE ANIMALDEATHS ON YOUR RANCH IN CALIFORNIA FOR AT LEAST A DECADE, WHAT,JEAN, DO YOU THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF WHY?I think they are collecting blood. I think they are collecting well, they go for the sexualorgans, they go for the eyes, for the tongue, and the blood is drained.DOES THAT ADD UP TO ANYTHING FOR YOU INTUITIVELY?Yes, but I'm not going to say it out loud!DO YOU MEAN LIKE A GENETIC HARVEST?I agree.IF IT IS A GENETIC HARVEST, WHY DOES IT GO ON YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTERYEAR, LITERALLY FOR DECADES? ONE MAN SAID TO ME, 'PERHAPSCENTURIES.'That's possible. I honestly don't know. But when the blood is gone and the sexual organs somany times.AND WHAT COULD IT ALL BE USED FOR?That's a good question.\" U. S. Army Lt. Col. Philip J. CorsoNamed \"EBENs\" As Animal MutilatorsWhat many people do not realize is that animal mutilations were directly linked to\"extraterrestrial biological entities\" by an American Army Lt. Colonel . His name is PhilipJ. Corso. His ground-breaking book, \"The Day After Roswell\" was published in July 1997 onthe 50th anniversary of the famous and controversial crash of one or more discs in theRoswell, New Mexico area. In his book, Col. Corso wrote:\"In the Pentagon from 1961 to 1963, I reviewed field reports from local and statepolice agencies about the discoveries of dead cattle whose carcasses looked asthough they had been systematically mutilated and reports from people who claimedto have been abducted by aliens and experimented on. ... Local police reported thatwhen veterinarians were called to the scene to examine the dead cattle left in fields,they often found evidence not just that the animal's blood had been drained, but that"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"entire organs were removed with such surgical skill that it could not have been thework of predators or vandals removing the organs for some depraved ritual. \"...I also remember that both civilian and military intelligence personnel attached tothe staffs of individuals who worked for the Roscoe Hillenkoetter and GeneralNathan Twining working group on UFOs in the 1950s were actively engaging inresearch into the kinds of surgical methods that would produce \"crime sceneevidence\" like this. They concluded it was extraterrestrial biological entities whowere experimenting with organ harvesting, possibly for transplant into other species,or for processing into some sort of nutrient package, or even to create some sort ofhybrid biological entity. ...We had irrefutable evidence that EBENs were landing onfarms, harvesting vital organs from livestock, and then just leaving the carcasses onthe ground because they knew we could not do anything about it.\"Animal mutilations continue around the world from the Northern Hemisphere to theSouthern. More than 3,200 cases have been reported to law enforcement and veterinariansin Chile and Argentina since 2002. But exactly who? - or what? - is doing the killing andtissue removal is still a mystery.More Information:Also click on these other Red Bluff, California, cattle mutilation reports:October 15, 2000 EarthfilesJuly 28, 2001 EarthfilesAugust 11, 2004 EarthfilesAlso see books by Linda Moulton Howe: An Alien Harvest and Glimpses of OtherRealities, Volumes I and II.Visit: Earthfiles Shop.For more about animal mutilations, please see reports below in Earthfiles Archives :· 11/02/2005 -- Part 3: Unusual Animal Deaths -Sheep Mutilations in Moortown,Dartmoor, England· 10/30/2005 -- Updated Part 2: Unusual Animal Deaths - Another Half CatMutilation in San Antonio, Texas· 10/27/2005 -- Updated Part 1: Unusual Animal Deaths - 22 Horses and 1 BurroNear Calhan, Colorado· 10/22/2005 -- A Lifting Beam Technology in Colorado Human Abduction· 10/03/2005 -- 2005 Horse Mutilation in France· 09/15/2005 -- Animal Mutilations Reported in Switzerland, Hollywood and Kansas· 08/26/2005 -- Another Cattle Mutilation in Canada· 08/22/2005 -- More Half Cat Reports: San Jose and Seattle· 08/13/2005 -- Mystery of Bloodless, Decapitated Kangaroos in Melbourne,Australia· 08/11/2005 -- Part 4: Two Men See Cow Mutilated in Light Beam· 08/03/2005 -- Part 3: Two Men See Cow Mutilated in Light Beam· 08/03/2005 -- Another Cattle Mutilation in Pondera County, Montana· 08/02/2005 -- Part 1: Anomalies Confirmed in Pennsylvania and Arizona RandomlyDowned Crops· 07/28/2005 -- Feedback on Half Cat Mystery· 07/26/2005 -- Part 2: Two Men See Cow Mutilated in Light Beam· 07/22/2005 -- Part 1: Two Men See Cow Mutilated in Light Beam· 07/14/2005 -- More Half Cat Mutilations in Seattle, Washington Region· 07/07/2005 -- Part 2: Eyewitness Description of Cattle Mutilation· 07/04/2005 -- Part 1: Eyewitness Description of Cattle Mutilation· 06/23/2005 -- More Than 3,000 Unusual Animal Deaths Reported in Argentina andChile Since 2002· 06/17/2005 -- Unusual Cow Death in Paradise Hill, Saskatchewan, Canada· 04/13/2005 -- Highly Strange Dog Death in Arkansas; 2000-Pound Bull Dropped;Calf Skinned· 02/21/2005 -- Updated - Bull and Cow Mutilations Northwest of Corpus Christi,Texas· 01/15/2005 -- Bull and Cow Mutilations Northwest of Corpus Christi, Texas· 12/22/2004 -- Part 2: \"Reasons Why U.S. Government CAN'T Release Truth AboutUFOs!\"· 12/22/2004 -- Part 1: \"Reasons Why U.S. Government CAN'T Release Truth AboutUFOs!\"· 12/10/2004 -- Part 4: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"· 12/10/2004 -- Part 3: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation?· 12/07/2004 -- Part 2: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation?· 12/04/2004 -- Part 1: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation?· 09/13/2004 -- Parts 1-6: \"Clearview\" Investigation of UFO Experiences on A RockyMountain Ranch· 08/28/2004 -- Cow Mutilation and Loud, Unidentified Sound in Farnam, Nebraska· 08/11/2004 -- Newborn Heifer Mutilation in Anderson, California, on August 7,2004· 07/21/2004 -- The Apollo Program, Cape Canaveral and UFOs· 01/24/2004 -- Oregon Man's Experiences with High Strangeness· 10/28/2003 -- Part 2 - U.
