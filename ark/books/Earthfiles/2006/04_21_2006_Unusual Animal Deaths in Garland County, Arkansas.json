But there was no exit wounds and when we had thevet do an x-ray on them, there was no bullet.\" - Capt. Ray Shoptaw,Garland County Sheriff's Office, Hot Springs, Arkansas Unusual animal deaths occurred in northern Garland County, Arkansas,west of Little Rock, from November 2005 into February 2006.April 21, 2006 Hot Springs, Arkansas - The worldwide animal mutilation mystery that I've investigatedsince the fall of 1979, is most commonly reported for cattle and horses. But wild animals such as deer and elkhave also been found with their rectums cored out and sexual organs removed along with jaw flesh, tongue,eye and ear - with no signs of blood. In fact, several pathology examinations of tissue in mutilated animalshave confirmed cauterization with a cutting instrument hot enough to prevent bleeding. In addition to cattle,horses and wild animals, every kind of farm and domestic animal has also been affected, including house petssuch as cats and dogs. Those cases are especially terrible because the pet owners are devastated to find abeloved dog or cat dead with its paws cut off, or head cut off, or even skinned. Now, comes news from Garland County, Arkansas west of Little Rock, that since November 2005 into thisspring, a cow and three pigs have been cut open, as well as puppies and cats cut up strangely, and a beagledog was literally skinned alive. Concerned residents in Hot Springs and animal activists from People for theEthical Treatment of Animals, known as PETA, raised $21,000 reward money for information leading to thearrest of the perpetrators. Local young boys and teenagers are suspected by the Garland County Sheriff'sOffice because at least one bragged about killing the cats and skinning the dog. Yet, so far no person has beenarrested or arraigned for any of the assaults. This week, I talked with Garland County Sheriff's Capt. David Ray Shoptaw about the animal attacks anddeaths - especially two dogs with bloodless holes in their heads. Their respective rectums were also cored outin deep, bloodless holes which the veterinarian said must have been done with a cauterizing instrument. Capt.Shoptaw has worked in the Sheriff's Office for 24 years and now heads up the Criminal Investigation Division.He told me he has never seen anything before in his law enforcement career in which animals have beenattacked like this.

Ray Shoptaw, Head, Criminal Investigation Division (CID), Garland County Sheriff's Office, HotSprings, Arkansas: \"We had one cow killed. Then we had two dogs that were killed very strangely. Then wehad two cats that were killed. Then we had a dog that was skinned alive. Ran back home with its skin draggingbehind him. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE STRANGE CASES OF THE TWO DOGS?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" OK. The two dogs were both, we thought, shot in the head at first, because there was a little bit of blood andthere was some kind of round, cylindrical hole in their heads. But there was no exit wounds and when we hadthe vet do an x-ray on them, there was no bullet. So, it might have been some kind of large, round, sharp metalinstrument. But it looked like they took a scalpel that cauterizes as it cuts and they cut their anuses out in aboutthe size of 3-inch hole. And then they grabbed ahold of that and started pulling and they pulled everything theycould pull out and as they pulled, they cut the little muscles and stuff that are hung to the body in there. Theypulled everything out all the way up to the rear portion of the stomach. They left probably about 6 inches ofwhere the intestines run out of the stomach.

The point about this is that the vet said the excisions around the rectums were totally clean – no blood. Therewas no blood whatsoever, except for what was up there by the holes in the heads. WAS THE ABDOMINAL MATERIAL THAT WAS LAID OUT BETWEEN THE TWO DOGS ALL THATHAD BEEN IN BOTH OF THEM? OR WAS SOME MISSING? No, there w as nothi ng mi ssi ng that w e know of. WHERE EXACTLY WAS THE HOLE IN THE SKULL? The hole in the skull on one dog was near an eye and the other was right in the top of the head. WAS THE ONE NEAR THE EYE RIGHT IN THE CENTER OF THE FOREHEAD? No. LIKE TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT? Yes, that’s why we thought it was a shot. THE OTHER WAS RIGHT AT THE TOP OF THE HEAD? Right. WHAT’S INTERESTING TO ME IS THAT I HAVE BEEN IN PUERTO RICO WHERE THERE HAVEBEEN UNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHS THAT HAVE INVOLVED GOATS AND SHEEP AND DOGS ANDRABBITS, AND ONE OF THE STRANGE HALLMARKS OF THOSE CASES WERE BLOODLESSHOLES OFTEN IN THE FOREHEAD, BUT SOMETIMES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE JAW, THE TOP OFTHE HEAD, OR ON THE BREASTBONE. Well (these holes) were the only place where there was any blood. There was no blood back there (rectums).It was almost like if there had not been the blood on the head, it was almost like it was done somewhere elseand brought back there and laid down. But there was the blood around the head – just a little bit, not much. WAS THAT BLOOD AROUND THE HEAD ON ONLY ONE OF THE DOGS OR BOTH? It w as around both. WHERE THE HOLE PENETRATED INTO THE SKULL, ONE AT THE SIDE OF THE EYE AND ONE ATTHE TOP OF THE HEAD. Yes. DID A VETERINARIAN PATHOLOGIST LOOK AT IT UNDER A MICROSCOPE TO DETERMINE? That, I don’t know. All I know is that we had it taken to a vet to have ‘autopsy’ done and that was the findingsshe sent me back. THAT THERE WAS CAUTERY. That it appeared, yes, cauterized THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER REPORTS FROM VETERINARIAN PATHOLOGISTS IN SOME UNUSUALANIMAL DEATHS ALSO SAYING ‘CUT WITH HIGH HEAT’ OR SOME KIND OF CAUTERY."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Yes, I have seen that. I have looked up a lot of that on the computer. It’s the strangest thing I’ve ever seen in mylife! YEAH. AND THESE ANIMALS, WERE THEY OWNED BY TWO DIFFERENT OWNERS? Both the dogs were owned by one man. He lived down the road. They were taken from his yard and taken toanother road near his house and left up there. Then he missed the dogs and he started looking and that’s wherehe found them. Beagle's Entire Hide Removed While Alive DID THE DOG THAT WAS SKINNED ALIVE DIE? Yes, it did die. When it came home. The lady had left her house at about 12:15 p.m. and she was going towork. She got a call on her cell phone about fifteen minutes later, around 12:30 p.m. A neighbor said, “I justsaw your dog run by with blood all over it.” She turned around immediately and went home. And the dog w as around behind the house w ith its skin cut off.And so she picked it up, took it to the vet, and the vet – there were so many blood vessels cut from the skinthere w as no way to hook it all back up. So, the skin w ould have died. There w asn’t any w ay to do anything.So, what they did was give the dog medicines to keep it from hurting and just let it die. That’s pretty sick, huh? YES, IT IS. I’M CURIOUS ABOUT THE TIMELINE. WERE THE FIRST UNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHSTHE TWO DOGS WITH THE HOLES IN THEIR HEAD? No, actually the cow was first. RIGHT AFTER THAT, IS THAT WHEN THE TWO DOGS WERE KILLED?Probably about two or three weeks later, maybe four weeks, about a month later. As a crow flies, the cow was relatively close to where the two dogs were. And then it was another three weeks or so before the littledog w as skinned. SO, THE REAL MYSTERY IS THE TWO DOGS WITH THE HOLES IN THEIR HEADS? That’s a mystery to me. That’s the mystery to me. The skinning could be done by someone. But how wouldsomebody do that other? That just blows my mind! TO CORE OUT THE RECTUMS WITHOUT BLOOD, TAKE OUT THE ABDOMINAL TISSUE ANDLEAVE TWO HOLES IN THE SKULLS. Yes. AND THE VET DID CONFIRM CAUTERY? The vet didn’t confirm it. The vet said it appeared to be done with something that caused the bleeding to stopand that it was very clean and precise. That’s just about what her words were. BUT WITHOUT EXPLANATION. Absolutely!\" Cauterizing Instrument in Unusual Animal Deaths?

Photomicrographs © 1989 by John Altshuler, M. D. The issue of lasers comes up in the animal mutilation cases because often the clean, bloodless excisionsappear darkened on the edge and feel harder than normal tissue. In fact, pathologist John Alshuler, M. D.,pathologist and hematologist, confirmed in more than thirty cases between 1989 and 1995 that the tissue hadbeen cut with high heat. But he was puzzled by the lack of carbon residue in the mutilated animals heexamined. All Earth life is carbon-based. The application of lasers to tissue, animals or humans, leaves acarbon residue which was never seen microscopically on any of the animal mutilation tissue. What was thecutting instrument? Was the cutting down by sound, not by light or burning?Mysteriously on June 16, 1993, a plug of tissue was bloodlessly removed from a dogin West Hennepin, Minnesota. P hotograph by Minnesota's West Hennepin Public Safety Department. Todd Boelter, a police officer with the West Hennepin Public Safety Department outside St. Paul, and Chiefof Police Larry Bailey, were puzzled by the lack of tracks and blood in a horse mutilation and bloodlessly\"biopsied\" dog in the second week of June, 1993. Police Officer Boelter told me in an interview that aveterinarian brought the dog to the police department, alive but with a hole in its left hip near the tail bone.The hole was one-half inch wide and two inches deep. The hole was dry and bloodless. The veterinarian said,\"The injury was possibly made by an electrical probe, like a cattle prod, because the injury did not bleed.\"The dog continued to heal afterward.

Since the 1970s, there have also been waves of cat mutilations in Canada, England, California, Texas,Florida, Virginia and other parts of the United States. One cycle began in May 1992 in Vancouver, BritishColumbia, Canada. Typical was a purebred Russian blue cat that was put out in the evening and never cameback. The back half of the cat was found three blocks from its owner's home without a trace of blood. It wasthe fourth cat found cut in half in a two week period. Only half cats were found - either the back or front half,but not both. By January 10, 1993, Vic Warren, Supervisor of Animal Control for the Vancouver City Pound,had opened a file on seven cats found cut in half. \"They're clearly being butchered by someone - it's a realsurgical job,\" he said. \"All I hope is that these cats were already dead when they were cut in half.\" On March 1993, Dr. John Altshuler in Denver received one of the Vancouver half-cats for examination andconfirmed that the entire excision had been cut with high heat. Similar reports of cats cut in half emerged in the summer of 1991, the spring of 1993 and at least twice more inthe early 2000 to 2005 period in Plano, Texas, an affluent suburb north of Dallas. I talked with Plano Police Detective Mike Box. In addition to the half cats, by August 1991 the police hadmissing reports filed on more than eighty domestic house cats that had collars and I. D. tags. None of those catswere ever found. In 1993, other animals disappeared from nearby Creek-Forest neighborhoods. Detective Boxand his department investigated satanic cult activities, but could find no hard evidence that connected them tothe mutilated and missing cats and other animals, such as dogs. Thirteen years before in 1978, authorities in St. Catharine's near Toronto, Canada, were also frustrated bymore than one hundred missing cats and dogs and others found skinned and badly mutilated. Similarly by August 1989, sixty-seven cats had been found in Tustin, California. The New York Times reportedon August 13, 1989, \"Some of them (were) cut in half with what some say is almost surgical precision, othersdisemboweled or skinned.\" Janet Hampson of Tustin summed up the eeriness of it all: \"There is never anyblood at the scene, the animals are often dismembered with surgical precision and paws and other body partsare often left on the ground in strikingly similar arrangements. No one ever seems to hear anything, nor do dogsbark during the killing.\" She believes the cats are captured, taken elsewhere, their blood drained and organsremoved, then replaced on their owners' lawns."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Top: Headless rabbit found at Sound Beach, Long Island, New York, on April 21, 1990.
