Tile art by Ironbound, a Portuguese company in Newark, New Jersey. June 30, 2006 Portugal - Eighty-nine years ago on May 13, 1917, three children watching sheep in Fatima,Portugal, saw lightning. Then a “small, pretty lady” appeared, suspended in the air at the top of an oak tree.The lady told them she w ould return to the same oak grove every month for six months. Her last visit w ould beOctober 13, 1917. Then she would tell the children who she was and what she wanted.The lady did appear on the 13th of each month after that. As word spread that a miracle was happening inFatima, Portugal, an estimated crowd of 50,000 people were gathered on October 13, 1917, for the sixth andfinal appearance. By then, the Catholic Jesuits in the parish said it was the Virgin Mary, even though theapparition suspended at the top of the oak tree never called herself that.The oldest of the three children was Lucia. She reported to the parish priest after the last October apparitionthat she heard the lady say: “Build a chapel here to Our Lady of the Rosary.”The Jesuit priests in the Fatima region then announced to the world that Christ’s mother had appeared inFatima to convert humans to “the Immaculate Heart of Mary.”But what exactly did the three children – Lucia, Jacinta and Francisco – say they saw at the top of an oak tree?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Jacinta Marto (age 7), Francisco Marto (age 9) and Lucia dos Santos (age 10),the three children of Fatima in 1917, the year they were witnessto the small female apparition atop the oak tree.Below is a summary of Fatima apparition descriptions from Page 18 of a 2005 book by Portugal historiansentitled: Heavenly Lights, The Apparitions of Fatima and the UFO Phenomenon. The authors are Dr.Joaquim Fernandes and Fina D’Armada.She was an apparently feminine and very beautiful figure.She was wrapped in a light “that blinded.”She measured approximately 3 ½ feet tall.She appeared to be between 12 and 15 years old.She wore a skirt, a coat, and maybe a cape, which were white.Her skirt and robe had a checkered pattern of gold thread.She had two or three cords at her waist.She wore something on her head that covered her ears and hair.She had black eyes.She had a strand of beads resembling a rosary, some type of hoop earrings at her neck,and a luminous ball at her waist.She came from above and disappeared, little by little, back up into the sky.She made no facial movements and did not move her legs.She spoke without moving her lips.She moved only her hands, once in a while.She turned her back to the children when she rose up in the sky.The Being of Fatima, P ortugal, in the 1917 oak tree apparitions,as interpreted by the authors, according to the first description provided by Luciato the Parochial Inquiry.

Lucia told Church investigators that when she asked the small,glowing, young lady suspended at the top of the oak where she was from, the lady “pointed to the sky, sayingshe was from there.”The historians were intrigued by the strong UFO phenomenon link to Fatima. In fact, the cover of their firstbook, Heavenly Lights, The Apparitions of Fatima and the UFO Phenomenon, has a photograph of the threechild eyewitnesses above a graphic image of three grey aliens with large black, slanted eyes.Heavenly Lights © 2005. Click here to amazon.com listing.Now in their second latest book in a trilogy about the Fatima events of 1917, the historians focus on a“conspiracy to cover-up the true origins of the Fatima prophesies.”The two Portuguese authors formally asked Catholic Church authority for access to the original records of theFatima incident, which had been held secretly by the Church in archives located at the Sanctuary of Fatimasince 1917. Quoting from their press release about the new book:“For the first time, they tell the esoteric history of the ‘cover story’ concocted by the Church,which has both shaped our modern view of the Fatima incident and obscured its truesignificance as the first major UFO close encounter case of the 20th Century. At the heart of thematter, lies a conspiracy by the Jesuits to suppress the fact that the entities encountered by thechildren at Fatima were not deities descending from Heaven, but rather were alien beingsvisiting our planet from ‘elsewhere’ in the vast cosmos.”Recently I talked with the Portuguese authors of Heavenly Lights and the new 2nd book, Celestial Secrets:The Hidden History of the Fatima Cover-Up, to be released in July 2006. The English translator isAlexandra Bruce. My first question by phone to the authors was: What evidence convinced them as historiansthat Fatima was caused by the UFO phenomenon?Interview:Joaquim Fe rnande s, Ph.D., and Fina D' Armada, Authors, Heavenly Lights: The Apparitions of Fatimaand the UFO Phenomenon © 2005; and Celestial Secrets: The Hidden History of the Fatima Cover-Up"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"© 2006, who reside and work in Portugal as historians: \"Because of the many testimonies of disc-shapedcraft, which started out silver, but became transparent and revealed the bodies of three beings inside.

Chionetti.Also, he says it is the reports also of people feeling like they might if a fighter jet were nearby. The airtrembled and literally dried up everyone. It had just rained, but everything just dried up totally around them,the clothes and the ground itself. Five or six people also reported instantaneous cures, healings.IF THERE WAS TECHNOLOGY AND PEOPLE SAW DISCS AND SAW BEINGS IN THE DISCS ANDTHEY SAW BEAMS THAT WERE PROJECTING THE ENTITIES THAT WERE TRANSLUCENT, DIDTHE JESUIT PRIESTS THEN FORCE LUCIA TO LIE?My answer would be yes! (laughs) There is Fatima 1 and Fatima II. Fatima I is with the kids and theeyewitnesses of the events of 1917 described. Fatima II is the version that went down in history sort ofcobbled together by the Jesuits. What the authors are trying to explain is the political background during thattime, prior to the establishment of the Republic of Portugal, the church and the state had been one. Many churchclerics were expelled from Portugal and fled to the Dorothean convent at Pontevedra, Galicia, northern Spain.That’s where Lucia at the age of 18 was interned in one of those nunneries where you are not allowed tospeak. But she was visited and basically told what to do by Jesuits on a regular basis. She was visited byJesuit priests who had been expelled from Spain and they built their own version of the Fatima story in theyears following the apparitions.[ Editor’s Note: Catholic World News reported: “Sister Lucia, the last survivor among thethree Portuguese children to whom the Virgin Mary appeared at Fatima, has died at the age of97. Sister Lucia died on February 13, 2005, at her Carmelite convent in Coimbra, Portugal,after a long illness. Living in isolation in the cloistered convent, Sister Lucia had reportedlylost her eyesight and hearing in the months preceding her death.Born on March 22, 1907, Lucie Dos Santos was only 10 years old when the Virgin appeared toher and her two young cousins, Francisco and Jacinta Marto, on a field outside the town ofFatima, on May 13, 1917. The apparitions continued through October 13 of that same year, andthe seers conveyed Mary's predictions of World War II, the rise of Russian Communism, andthe urgent need for the faithful to pray the Rosary.Sister Lucia also revealed the famous ‘third secret’ of Fatima, which was kept secret bysuccessive Popes until May 2000, when John Paul II revealed the text of a mystical visioninvolving a ‘bishop dressed in white’ who was struggling toward the Cross, over the bodies ofmartyrs, until he himself was felled by gunfire. Pope John Paul concluded that the visionreferred to the attempt on his own life. Some Catholics continue to insist that aspects of the‘third secret’ have not yet been disclosed, although the Vatican insists that there is nothing moreto reveal.Sister Lucia had spoken of the Fatima promises in four published memoirs, but kept the ‘thirdsecret’ hidden. She divulged that secret to the Bishop of Leira, Portugal, in January 1944; heconfided the secret to Pope Pius XII. Sister Lucia had said that the secret should be revealed atthe Pope's discretion, but not before 1960.The first Pontiff to meet privately with Sister Lucia was Paul VI, when he visited Fatima inMay 1967. Pope John Paul II met with her on three separate occasions: in 1982, when he madea pilgrimage to Fatima to thank the Virgin for saving him from assassination; in 1991, on the10th anniversary of the shooting; and in 2000, for the beatification ceremonies.Francisco and Jacinta Marto were beatified by Pope John Paul in ceremonies that took place atFatima on May 13, 2000 - the anniversary of the first apparition there. Both Francisco andJacinta had died in their youth - in 1919 and 1920, respectively. Sister Lucia made a rarejourney outside the Carmelite cloister to take part in the ceremony.After the Fatima apparitions, and subsequent personal visions of the Virgin in 1923 and 1929,Lucie Dos Santos entered religious life-- first in Spain and later, in 1948, as a Carmelite inPortugal. Questioned as to w hether Sister Lucia could be canonized, as were the other tw oyoung Fatima seers, Cardinal José Saraiva Martins was non-committal. The prefect of theCongregation for the Causes of Saints reminded reporters that the Church ordinarily requires a"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5-year interval between an individual's death and the opening of a formal cause forbeatification. Moreover, the Portuguese cardinal observed, ‘sanctity is a strictly personalthing.’ He added: ‘The fact that all three children saw the Holy Virgin does not show anythingabout the sanctity of each one.’\"] Both \"Nordic\" and \"Grey\" EntitiesPresent in Fatima?IN THE BOOKS, THERE ARE TWO SPECIFIC DESCRIPTIONS BY DIFFERENT EYEWITNESSES OFUNUSUAL ENTITIES IN MAY 1917. ONE IS BLOND-HAIRED, WHITE-SKINNED, BLUE-EYED; AGIRL OF APPROXIMATELY 14 WHO IS DESCRIBED IN ONE INCIDENT. IN ANOTHER, THE ENTITYABOVE THE OAK TREE IS DESCRIBED AS HAVING BLACK EYES, WHICH WOULD SEEM TO BELIKE THE GREY EXTRATERRESTRIALS. THE BLOND, BLUE-EYED WOULD SEEM TO BE LIKETHE NORDICS IN THE CLASSIC E. T. LITERATURE.Yes, they were two very different apparitions. The blond one was the fourth eyewitness who died only 10months ago, who gave the story about the young blond teenager. You are right, the other apparition above theoak tree did have black eyes and very small features.SO HOW DO THESE INVESTIGATORS RECONCILE TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENTEXTRATERRESTRIAL GROUPS BEING INVOLVED IN WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A HIGHLYDECEPTIVE SERIES OF EVENTS – SPECIFICALLY TO FOOL THE POPULATION INTO THINKING ITWAS A RELIGIOUS EVENT?In the authors’ opinion, the extraterrestrial phenomenon is an inter-dimensional, ongoing millennial ancientthing that we’ve superimposed our own meaning upon. So, the meanings that were ascribed to the events ofFatima came from the psychological and language of the culture in those times. Then, the Jesuits manipulated itto fit their goals, which were to make Russia Christian again. It’s what Jacques Vallee wrote in his books: thisstuff has been going on forever, it’s not going to stop, and it will just morph and we’ll give it new meanings asour technology and culture and subconscious evolves. We’ll start having a different relationship to these sortsof events. Why Would the UFO IntelligenceMasquerade As Marian Apparitions?WHAT IS THE IMPLICATION FOR THESE INVESTIGATORS OF WHAT APPEARS TO BE ADELIBERATE EFFORT ON THE PART OF THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCE TOMASQUERADE ITSELF EXACTLY AS MARIAN APPARITIONS WHICH THE CATHOLIC CHURCHHAD BY THEN ACCEPTED?That’s an interesting question. So everyone said if the kids saw a woman dressed in white, who else could itbe but the Virgin Mary? The question is: were the ETs trying to look like Catholic imagery? Or was it thesubconscious in the public milieu at the time trying to make sense out of something that makes no sense. So, it’sa saint, an angel, the Virgin Mary.Then later on in the last half of the 20th Century when high-tech started happening and sci-fi started happening,you can describe it all as something else. That’s the theme of the second book: it was not Mother Mary. It wassomething inter-dimensional, extraterrestrial or other, but the 'pretty woman' morphed over time as the Jesuitsgot their hands on it in a super-religious country to turn it into a miracle instead of something scary andbizarre.I’M TRYING TO SAY IT WAS JUST EXTRATERRESTRIALS MANIPULATING HUMANS.They don’t rule that out. But it does not seem as likely as something that is beyond our comprehension. Theauthors don’t feel they have enough evidence to definitively state there was direct extraterrestrial manipulationof the people in Fatima. Was it inter-dimensional? Extra-dimensional? Extraterrestrial? Holograms? It wasweird – especially when you are talking about 19th Century rural Portugal. All that happened w as so beyondthe people involved that it’s very hard to say exactly what happened. You’re talking about a lot of illiteratepeople who went to church every Sunday.BUT THE WHOLE POINT OF THE BOOK, HEAVENLY LIGHTS ARE THE DETAILS, WHICH THESUBTITLE UNDERSCORES: A UFO PHENOMENON, WHICH IS E. T.The authors say they were the first to point out the incredible similarities between UFO encounters thatoccurred in Fatima and the events reported at Fatima.But what the hell is an extraterrestrial? We don’t know. That’s beyond our comprehension. They don’t feelright as scientists, historians, to declare. Maybe the military has stuff they don’t know about. But they know thelocal mythology and philosophical fairies that have been reported for eons in the area – it could be any ofthese things or all of them at once. Yes, it might have been an encounter with flesh and blood, nuts and bolts,extraterrestrials. But the area has been renowned for fairies and weird things forever.The first book was more of a shock like, ‘What if Fatima was a UFOs and extraterrestrial encounter?’ Thesecond book is going more into, ‘What the hell is a UFO? What the hell does extraterrestrial really mean? Andthe Jesuit manipulation of the story."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Catholic Church's Response to Books So Far?The initial reaction of the Catholic Church was one of total shock and surprise because they themselves hadnever bothered to take a look at the original documents of the 1917 Fatima events. These two historians werethe first to ask for permission to view and study documents about Fatima in an historical manner. The CatholicChurch has not been afraid of the discovery of something that would shake the dogma of the Catholic faith.However, the authors were forced to sign documents in order to get access to the documents and to write aboutthem. In that way, the authors were compromised.At the time they were writing the books, she had a scholarship at a university that was for another topic,another major. When her studies came to light, it was a time of political change in 1964 of a new democracy.When the church saw what she was writing about, her scholarship was suspended and her career as aninvestigator was destroyed. She explains that Fatima is not only a Catholic thing to the country of Portugal. It’sone of the biggest sources of revenue for Portugal from tourists in the 20th Century. So it’s almost like Churchand State become one around the Fatima phenomena.GIVEN WHAT YOU JUST SAID, THEN IS IT A THREAT TO THE CURRENT CATHOLIC CHURCH INPORTUGAL, SPAIN AND THE VATICAN TO HAVE THIS WORK OUT WITH SO MANY DETAILSABOUT THE 1917 SERIES OF EVENTS BEING UFO PHENOMENA AND NOT MARIANAPPARITIONS?Beliefs are entrenched, but the facts do speak for themselves. It might take a century for the facts to sink in.These are not made up stories. The made up stories are what the Church/Jesuits said. Of course, these arethreatening to the Catholic Church and Marian believers worldwide and to whatever cottage industry revolvesaround Fatima today.\" Celestial Secrets Available July 1, 2006The new book, Celestial Secrets: The Hidden History of the Fatima Cover-Up by Portuguese historiansJoaquim Fernandes, Ph.D., and Fina D’Armada, is available beginning this weekend of July 1st atamazon.com.
