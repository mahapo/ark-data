Each of six pieces received were \"formed\"with a curvature that tapered, as shown to the right in photo magnification above.April 28, 2006 Albuquerque, New Mexico - In addition to my work as a TV producer, documentaryfilmmaker and writer, I have reported news about science, the environment and unexplained phenomena since1993 on the nationally syndicated radio programs, Dreamland and Coast to Coast AM, originally hosted byArt Bell. The title, Dreamland, is slang used at Nellis AFB, Nevada, to describe the top secret Area 51 wherehighly classified technology and craft have been stored and tested. Some say there are \"extraterrestrial\" craftthere hidden behind and below the Papoose Mountain range. Several of my radio interviews have concerned research about alleged extraterrestrial vehicles that hadcrashed near Roswell, Capitan Mountain and Socorro, New Mexico, in 1947. Some of those reports I did fromEngland and Italy in the fall of 1995. That's when scenes of a six-fingered and six-toed humanoid dissectionand craft debris were broadcast in the U. K. and United States amid intense controversy about whether or notthe film was actually historic. First Letter from \"Grandad\" - April 10, 1996 A few months later, Bell and I received a series of letters, each post-marked from South Carolina and signedonly \"A Friend.\" The first letter was dated April 10, 1996, and included several metal pieces: \"I've followed your broadcasts over the last year or so and have been considering whether ornot to share with you and your listeners some information related to the Roswell (New Mexico)UFO crash. \"My grandfather was a member of the Retrieval Team sent to the crash site just after the incidentwas reported. He died in 1974, but not before he had sat down with some of us and talked aboutthe incident. I am currently serving in the (United States) military and hold a Security Clearanceand do NOT wish to 'go public' and risk losing my career and commission. \"Nonethel ess, I w oul d l ike to briefl y tell you w hat my ow n grandfather tol d me about Rosw el l .In fact, I enclose for your safekeeping 'samples' that were in the possession of my grandfatheruntil he died (in 1974), and which I have had since his own estate was settled. As I understandit,, they came from the UFO debris and were among a large batch subsequently sent to Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio from New Mexico.\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Aluminum pieces sent by anonymous South Carolina source with his first April 10, 1996,letter allegedly \"appropriated\" by his grandfather as samples from a wedge-shaped vehicle thatcrashed \"between San Mateo Mountains and Sierra Blanca\" west of Roswell.Date not given by source. Photograph by Art Bell © 1996. The writer did not give a specific crash date or location in that first letter. Bell and I repeatedly asked duringradio broadcasts for those facts because several different testimonies have emerged the past few years aboutcrashed or landed discs in different locations and different time periods. If true, the incident that madenewspaper headlines about a \"flying saucer\" crashing on the Foster Ranch between Corona and Roswell thefirst week of July 1947 was not a unique event. In his fifth and final letter received July 5, 1996, the writer finally quoted notes \"from Grandad's journal\" thatplaced the impact site \"between San Mateo Mountains and Sierra Blanca\" west of Roswell, but did not give adate. Sierra Blanca peak is about seventy miles straight west of Roswell. San Mateo Peak is another eightymiles west of Sierra Blanca. Between those two mountain regions in 1947 was the White Sands ProvingGround (later named White Sands Missile Range) where the post-World War II V-2 rocket program wasoperating under the direction of Germany physicist, Werner von Braun. Magdalena and Socorro are at thenortheastern edge of the Pl ains of San Agustin and north of the San Mateo Mountains."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" The source also clarified in another letter that the vehicle was a \"Wedge-shaped Disc.\" A wedge could beshaped like a piece of pie or perhaps a curved crescent, but a disc is round. So, we assumed the grandfatherwas using \"disc\" generically for UFO. The South Carolina writer included the following highly strange description - based, he said, on conversationswith his grandfather - about the security team's efforts to retrieve the wedge-shaped \"Disc\" and threenon-human bodies, two dead and one alive: \"...the Team arrived at the crash site just after the AAF/USAF reported the ground zero location.[ Editor's Note: U. S. Army Air Force was splitting into Air Force and Army during the summerof 1947.] They found two dead occupants, hurled free of the Disc. A lone surviving occupantwas found within the Disc and it was apparent its left leg was broken. There was a minimalradiation contamination and it was quickly dispersed with a water/solvent wash, and soon theoccupant was dispatched for medical assistance and isolation. The bodies were sent to theWright-Patterson AFB for dispersal. The debris was also loaded onto three trucks whichfinished the on-load just before the sunset. \"Grandad was part of the Team that went with the surviving occupant. The occupantcommunicated via telepathic means. It spoke (transmitted) perfect English and communicatedthe following: The Disc was a 'probeship' dispatched from a 'launchship' that was stationed atthe dimensional gateway to the Terran Solar System. The occupants were part of a race ofexplorers from a Solar System 32 Light Years from Terra. They had been conducting operationson Terra for over 100 years. Another group were (sic) exploring Mars, and Io (Martian moon).Each 'probeship' carried a crew of three. A 'launchship' had a crew of (100) One-Hundred. \"The Disc that crashed had collided with a meteor in orbit of Terra and was attempting tocompensate its flight vector, but because of the collision, the inter-atmospheric propulsionsystem malfunctioned...\" The letter writer also listed some of the institutions his grandfather said were involved in research on the craftand its occupants. Included were the University of Colorado; Office of Naval Research; the Army/Air Force;University of California, Los Angeles; Atomic Energy Commission; National Advisory Committee onAeronautics; and Office of Scientific Research and Development. \"Grandad spent a total of 26 weeks in the Team that examined and debriefed the lone survivorof the Roswell crash. Grandad's affiliation with the 'project' ended when the occupant was to betransported to a long-term facility. He was placed on-board a USAF Transport aircraft that wasto be sent to Washington, D. C.\" The statement that a meteor impact disabled the extraterrestrial craft was curious. One would assume that spacetravelers, or time and dimension skippers, would have sensors and deflection shields for all sorts of intrudersin their space and around their remote-controlled explorer craft. Some government insiders said microwaveradar experiments conducted at White Sands Proving Ground in the 1940s might have interfered with theextraterrestrial craft guidance systems. At least the metal pieces sent by the South Carolina writer were hard physical facts that could be tested. Icontacted a scientist in a major Midwestern university w ho has helped me analyze unusual materials, providedhis name and location are anonymous. He used a scanning electron microscope to examine structure and energydispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to analyze element composition. He confirmed that the metal was greater than99% aluminum of normal density."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Second Letter from \"Grandad\" - April 22, 1996 After I reported those findings on the radio, we received a second letter dated April 22, 1996. The source saidthat \"based on past conversations on the subject (of a Roswell crash) with Grandad,\" he understood that thealuminum provided \"a conductor for the electromagnetic fields created in the propulsion systems.\" This letteralso elaborated about the \"occupant-survivor.\" \"...critically-needed data was 'eliminated' by the self-destruct mechanisms on the disc vehicleitself. Furthermore, the occupant-survivor of the crash refused to disclose technical information,despite a series of interrogative attempts to extract technological data. No means could be foundto secure the information. There were always two Security Team members present at everyface-to-face meeting with the survivor. The survivor had the ability to deduce thoughts andquestions prior to them being asked. Sometimes it became frustrating. \"The Disc itself was literally dissected and it was discovered that the propulsion system hadactually fused together the many interior components. There were control-type devises forgedin the shape of the alien hands, which were assumed as controls and activation surfaces. [Editor's emphasis.) \"What is today fiber-optic technology was part and parcel of the alien technology within thecontrol panels, albeit fused and melted when the self-destruct mechanism was activated. Therewere Westinghouse-affiliated persons on the Team, and Grandad always thought some of themhad gone back with the knowledge and incorporated it into the future research with the phonesystem.\" Back-engineering extraterrestrial technology for American military and commercial development was wellknown to retired U. S. Army Lt. Colonel Philip J. Corso, former Chief of the Army's Foreign TechnologyDivision, in the early 1960s. In The Day After Roswell, his ground-breaking and best-selling book, ColonelCorso described his assignment in 1961 to 1963 to get extraterrestrial technology out of Pentagon storage intothe hands of defense contractors. Click cover for amazon.com. The Day After Roswell © 1997 by Lt. Col. Philp J. Corso (Ret.). Lt. Col. Corso's boss was General Arthur Trudeau, then head of Army Research and Development. TheColonel's list of back-engineered extraterrestrial technologies included night vision image intensifiers, fiberoptics, supertenacity fibers, lasers, molecularly aligned metallic alloys, integrated circuits,microminiaturizaton of logic boards, particle beams, electromagnetic propulsion systems - and hand imprintedcontrol panels. This is what Col. Corso wrote about panels retrieved from a \"crescent-shaped\" extraterrestrial vehicle thatcrashed in New Mexico and which sounds similar to the South Carolina writer's description: \"...the series of raised deck panels where there were indentations for the creatures' hands. Theindentations on these panels, as the Roswell field reports described them looked like the handprints pressed into the concrete at the old Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood. Were thedirectional commands a series of electronic instructions transmitted directly from the creatures'brains along their bodies and through the panels into the ship itself as if the ship were only anextension of the creature's body?\" Col Corso said that extraterrestrial bodies first went to Wright Field in Cincinnati, Ohio, but after the USAFbecame its own separate branch of the service, \"the remaining bodies stored at Wright along with thespacecraft, were sent to Norton Air Force Base in California. Experiments were carried out at Norton andultimately at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada at the famous Groom Lake site, Area 51 known as Dreamland,where the Stealth technology was developed.\" The Colonel said that the USAF and CIA \"Maintained a kind ofal i en technol ogy museum\" at Norton Ai r Force Base near San Bernardi no, Cal ifornia, \"the fi nal resti ng place of"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the Roswell spacecraft\" - at least one of them. Norton AFB was closed down in the 1990s and one wonderswhere the \"alien technology museum\" went? Or if it's still there, is it underground or disguised in some way? Col Corso said the motives of the extraterrestrials were puzzling and of great concern to government insiderswhen he worked in the White House National Security Staff under President Dwight Eisenhower and later inthe Pentagon under General Arthur Trudeau. The priority of the U. S. government was to get as much advancedextraterrestrial technology as possible, keep it out of the hands of Cold War enemies, while \"pushing throughweapons development that might reduce the advantage\" of the advanced and potentially threatening non-humanintelligence. The Colonel agreed the government had extraterrestrial artifacts from more than one spacecraft. He said thatduring the Norton AFB testing, it was discovered that \"the entire vehicle functioned just like a giant capacitor... the craft itself stored the energy necessary to propagate the magnetic wave that elevated it ... as if gravitywas being folded around the outside of the wave that enveloped the craft. ...Somehow the pilots became part ofthe electrical circuitry of the vehicle, vectoring it in a way similar to the way you order a voluntary muscle tomove.\" The Colonel told me how amazed military and science investigators were about the spacecraftfunctioning as an extension of the beings' neurological systems, including their molecularly align ed andstrengthened flight suits and hand-imprinted control panels. Panels with six-fingered hand depressions allegedly found with six-fingered humanoidsat UFO crash site a few miles from Socorro, New Mexico. First broadcast on U. K. and U. S. A. televisionon September 28, 1995. Photograph from 16mm film © 1996 Orbital Media Ltd., U.K. I continued to investigate the possibility that the aluminum pieces might be \"punch outs\" from terrestrialmachining operations, since they measured in common terrestrial quarter-inch and inch sizes. However, AlcoaAluminum engineers thought that the 99%+ purity of the aluminum w as not typical of industrial machiningwhich usually involves harder alloys. So, there w as speculation that if the South Carolina w riter's story weretrue, the military handlers might have had samples from the alleged extraterrestrial craft punched out todistribute to American scientists to study. Third Letter from \"Grandad\" - May 27, 1996 On May 27, 1996, a third letter arrived containing a surprise - six more pieces of metal that were very differentfrom the aluminum. The letter said: \"I have listened with interest to the ongoing reports on the samples I sent your way. I noted thatResearcher Linda Moulton Howe discussing the testing of the samples noted that basically it ismerely Aluminum. Slight variations on the testing, but indistinguishable from 'normal'Al umi num. \"Actually, this is precisely the same initial findings of Grandad's Team. However, I neglected toinclude metallic samples of the exterior of the crashed Roswell disc. I now include theenclosed, and can only say that these scrapings came from the exterior underside of the Discitself. It literally was a 'shell-like' shielding of the Disc. Brittle and layered, almost with apre-fabricated design and placing. Keep in mind that these are the last of Grandad's samples.They have sat for years inside a closet with his personal effects. \"Because of certain concerns, I will not be contacting you on this matter. Perhaps I am a bitparanoid, but I do have a family & career to think about. I hope you understand. Hope these lastsamples are helpful. Of course, I will be listening.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Photograph of two metal pieces from the South Carolina writer's second shipment of sixreceived May 27, 1996.
