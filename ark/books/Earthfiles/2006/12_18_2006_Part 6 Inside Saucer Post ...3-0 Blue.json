Tombaugh, Ph.D., AstronomerReturn to Part 1December 14, 2006 Albuquerque, New Mexico -An official publication of Civilian Research, InterplanetaryFlying Objects (CRIFO) © 1957 by Leonard H. Stringfield.(Cont) THE DANCE OF \"LIFE\"It concerned the Tremonton film known in 1952 as the \"U\" film in secret Air Force circles.Major Keyhoe, in his book Flying Saucers from Outer Space, had exposed its secrethandling by photographic experts in the Air Force and Navy. By 1954, the film hadbecome a \"real piece of positive evidence\" among fact-hunting saucerites. It was duringthis heady period that Dr. Leon Davidson, nuclear scientist and formerly of the AtomicEnergy Commission (AEC), sent a letter to CRIFO for publication in the Newsletter.Wrote Dr. Davidson:\"I was at the Pentagon on the afternoon of November 5, 1952, as a result ofan invitation by letter of October 23, 1952, from Colonel William Adams. ...Imet Colonel Adams and Major Dewey Fournet and we spent two hoursdiscussing flying saucers and the Air Force's investigation of the subject....Later, Major Fournet took me into a nearby briefing room and ran the films(Tremonton) off for me twice, also stopping the film at several points so that Icould examine typical frames at length. I was told that about six prints hadbeen made and had been submitted to various photo-labs in the country(including Life magazine's lab, as I recall) to be scrutinized for fakery.\"On September 28, 1953, an Air Force spokesman said that the owner of the film, NavyW/O Delbert Newhouse \"can make the film public if he wishes.\" However, when I wroteto Life about pictorializing the film, they replied on November 25, 1953, \"We have notheard anything more about the once-proposed showing of the Tremonton films. ...We shall"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"certainly be interested when and if this material is made public.\"[ Editor's Note: Tremonton, Utah, UFO Color Film, July 2, 1952:Several metallic-looking, disc-shaped aerial vehicleson frame from 40 feet of 16mm color movie film taken on July 2, 1952 byU. S. Navy Warrant Officer and Navy photographer, Delbert C. Newhouse.A Warrant Officer and Navy photographer named Delbert C. Newhouse andhis wife were driving along a road seven miles from Tremonton, Utah, whenthey spotted a formation of brilliant metallic-looking, disc-shaped objects, in acloudless blue sky.Newhouse used a 16mm camera and telephoto lens to shoot forty feet of filmof the objects maneuvering. The color movie film was submitted to ProjectBluebook for evaluation. It was studied for three months at the U.S. Air ForcePhoto Reconnaissance Laboratory. The head of Project Bluebook thought thefilm showed unknown flying aerial vehicles. But the CIA said the objects werebirds. ]Had Life forgotten they had examined the film? Or was Lif e told to forget? Or was it atypical case of Life's right hand not knowing what its left hand was doing?Notwithstanding, as the world now knows, the \"U\" film - despite denials of its existence bythe Air Force in 1954 - was made public in the movie, \"UFO,\" a United Artist productionin 1956. While Life was neither interested in printing stills of the \"U\" film, or in reviewingthe movie, \"UFO,\" Life did take time out on December 5, 1955, to promote the juveniledrawings depicting un-typical flying saucers released by the Air Force in their SpecialReport No. 14, dated October 25, 1955. THE HIGHEST WALL IN THE WORLDSaucerly speaking, something was rotten in Washington! This was particularly clear to thestudent who had followed the long record of Air Force statements and all the better UFOreports since 1947. To him the matter was no longer a joke. It was obvious that a worriedWashington was hiding something big - perhaps much bigger than the Manhattan Project.Guarding this secret was the highest wall in the world - the Wall of Security! On one sidestood the tatterdemalion forces of civilian research. On the other side was the Air Force -the watchdog over the evidence.Such was the status quo while CRIFO's forces were building up. Statistically, during onefluid period in 1955, CRIFO's bulletin could boast of more than 2300 paid subscribers.Included in that figure were many prominent Americans. Most were unafraid of havingtheir names associated with saucers. Others, however, preferred obscurity because of theircompany's contracts with the Air Force or affiliations with observatories, colleges or themilitary.Foreign agents also were aware of CRIFO, several inquiring about Orbit directly. Others, Isuspected, came through members of the diplomatic staff. On a confidential tip from oneLatin American correspondent, I learned that his government received Orbit regularly,having them translated into Spanish.On the other hand, I have approached several foreign governments with questionsregarding the UFO problem. Replies, however, by such open and direct communication,are scarce. Curiously, only the Soviet Union has responded. A registered letter, dated June11, 1957, reads:\"Seemingly, the communications concerning the appearance over yourcountry of unidentified flying objects receiving in the foreign press the nameof 'flying saucers,' to which you refer in your letter, do not have any relationto true reality, seeing that these appearances have not been observed by us."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"\"Naturally, under these conditions there cannot be talks either about anyofficial government statement on the question of unexisting objects, or abouttheoretical investigations in this domain.\"The letter was signed by A. G. Karpenko, Scientific Secretary, InterdepartmentalCommission for Interplanetary Communications, Academy N.A.U.K., USSR. While I wasnot disappointed by the letter's text, I was unhappy to note that the U.S.S.R. had agreed onat least one issue with the U.S.A. Also of interest was the department from which the letterwas addressed. By this, we at least know that the U.S.S.R. is organized to think in terms ofinterplanetary affairs.Back home, CRIFO's prestige and spirit were high, its subscribership was strong and sowere the demands placed on it for authoritative information. More and more, I realizedthat my editorial word alone was not enough. For CRIFO to prosper continuously, it wouldneed the strength of official and professional support. There were three sources - theOffice of Public Information (OPI) of the U. S. Air Force in Washington, the legislativebranches of government and the men of science.One exploratory effort on March 18, 1955, took me by phone to Captain Robert C. Whiteof the Air Force's OPI in Washington. We talked saucers for one hour. In that time, Ihammered on the proverbial issues, but White - well-trained and wary and fending offcertain questions with the proverbial Air Force answers - found his best defense in silence.On general issues, however, White was more responsive.\"Five to twenty-two percent of saucer sighting reports were unexplainable,varying from month-to-month. 'Foo fighters' of World War II vintage havenever been satisfactorily explained. At least two pictures of UFOs taken byspecial grid cameras show only pinheads of light. Green fireballs, 'to the bestof Air Force knowledge are not a result of the Air Force or any othergovernmental testing.' When reminded that the phenomena have been seenpassing over many large cities, Capt. White said that such a developmentwould never be tested over populated areas, although there was heavymilitary experimentation in areas where fireballs are most frequently seen -New Mexico. Capt. White emphasized, however, that such experiments werenot green fireballs. 'They do exist,' he said. 'That's why thousands of dollarswere spent investigating them.'\"This is a scrupulously accurate eyewitness painting of a mysteriousgreen fireball rushing through the night sky over New Mexico byMrs. Lincoln La Paz.\" Drawing reprinted in Life magazine, April 7, 1952.\"When asked about the confidential nature of these investigations underProject Twinkle, Capt. White said, 'The project files have never beendeclassified.' He said there was no reason for this other than no pressures hadbeen made to release the information. He said in effect that the officers whohandled the data probably never bothered to declassify the material beforeleaving the service or being transferred. Capt. White intimated here that thismaterial showed nothing of concern.\"He said, 'The Air Force things the green fireballs are astronomicalphenomena.' He suggested the fireballs should be of more concern toastronomers than the Air Force. After pointing out to Capt. White the futilityof talking with astronomers, referring to Dr. Herget, I then interposed byquoting a statement by Dr. Lincoln La Paz, an authority on meteors, regardinggreen fireballs: 'They are not any kind of meteor I have ever heard of.' Citingthese authoritative words, I again asked Capt. White for the Air Force'sinterpretation of this kind of phenomena. He answered simply, 'We cannotexplain them.'\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Clyde Tombaugh, Ph.D., astronomer and discoverer of Plutoin 1930 on left, discussing searches for near-Earth satellites with Lincoln La Paz, Ph.D.,March 3, 1954. Photo from Albuquerque Journal.On the other hand, Air Force replies to my letters have brought even less information.Most replies tersely evaded my questions entirely. A typical sparing answer to a letterwhich I addressed to Capt. White asking questions about green fireball phenomena got thisreply: \"Capt. White is on leave prior to transfer to Spain after having completed his tourhere. I am enclosing a copy of our latest press release which answers your question in thisletter.\" The letter was signed by Major William W. James of the Air Force Press Desk.Speculatively, I have often wondered what Major James would have written had I askedfor information on the Air Force's provisions to combat the mosquito in the tundra?And if there should be any doubt about my collection of \"replies,\" I need only to quote inpart from a letter from the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, dated 14 December1956, as follows: \"...We have just completed a review of the considerable file ofcorrespondence that has accumulated over the past few years between you and variousunits and offices of the Air Force.\"But the evasive reply and the polite rebuff were not only confined to CRIFO. A largenewspaper which once tried getting a look-see at the Tremonton film was told at the lastminute that the film had been destroyed accidentally by fire. Another attempt to get thefacts in 1950 took a Cincinnati businessman, following the Norwood Searchlight Incident,to Washington. At the Pentagon, a high-ranking officer told him to forget saucers andadvised instead \"to start collecting postage stamps.\"Others tired of the military merry-go-round turned their efforts to the lawmakers. One suchinquiring letter was written by Robert Hopkins of LaGrange, Illinois. He got this tactfulreply from Congressman William McVey, which said in part: \"...The government has beenpaying considerable attention to reports regarding reported movements of these celestialbodies and recently issued a statement to the effect that they had run down thousands ofthese reports and could not discover a foundation for any of them.'Still another attempt through jurisprudence had more far-reaching implications. Theprincipal contestant was Thomas Eickhoff, a Cincinnati businessman. Eickhoff firstbecame interested in saucers in 1951, having seen an object in the sky that year which hecould not explain. In 1954, he touched off a melee in the Air Force by making public highpoints of his interview with Colonel O'Mara, and has since favored a showdown betweencertain claimants of the interplanetary theory and the Air Force who oppose it. Eickhoff'sopen letter describing his later legal actions follows:1954 Thomas Eickhoff Letter:'Yes, I did have a case for Federal Court.However, by use of the injunction if necessary he wouldprevent anyone from testifying in court concerning this book becausemaximum security exists concerning the subject of UFOs.'\"Jurisprudence - a system of laws of a country. Right. Justice. The act ofadministering same. It has always been my opinion that the law of the land isfor the protection of the rights of the individual and that due process ofadministering this cardinal weapon against injustices and wrongs is above andbeyond the interference by anyone or anything.\"At present, in the UFO controversy, there exists two diametrically opposedfactions; one, the various government agencies who make statementsexplaining away the UFO as hallucinations and scientific improbabilities; theother, a group of persons who claim personal contacts with people from otherplants or by means of radio and thought waves.\"It is not my position to sit in judgment on either of these factions, but rather"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"to fling the gauntlet down between them and ask by due process of the law,which is right?\"In 1954, I took the initial and, what I thought to be, right steps toward endingthis comedy of errors. There were two men slated for speaking engagementsin our city. Both had made contact claims in books and were here primarily topromote sales. I could not see why the officials would let these men, if theirword was false, speak here with authority. The rebuff I received from the FBIwas that the men were only stating personal opinions which they were entitledto state. However, the books which these contact claimants offered for salewere headed by such sale clinchers as 'documentary, fact, truth and so on.'\"It was during this time that my wife and I made a personal visit to Lt. Col.John O'Mara, then Chief Deputy Commander of Air Intelligence, Wright-Patterson AFB. While we talked, Col. O'Mara once again branded these menas obvious hoaxers and also made disparaging remarks about Major DonaldKeyhoe and his books. He later was caused to rescind many of these remarksabout Major Keyhoe. He also stated that 'there are no such things as theTremonton or Montana motion picture films showing saucers in flight.However, many Americans today have seen those very pictures which wereshown on public movie screens. The Colonel did admit that grid cameras hadbeen placed on many jet pursuit ships and indicated they were for furtherstudy of the UFO problem. I hastened to mention that it seemed like a largeamount of the taxpayers' money was being spent on this 'obvious hoax.' TheColonel ended the interview by saying that sighting reports were arriving atthe phenomenal rate of 700 per week. I am certain, as I am sure the Colonelwas, that a very small percentage were authentic cases. After this shotskirmish, I gave up at least temporarily, arguing with 'City Hall.'\"In the next year, there were more sightings and more claims of personalcontacts. Saucer books, magazines and direct mail circulars were beingpublished in increasing numbers. My thoughts were: How was it that the'charlatans' were going on their way busily fleecing the people,unapprehended by the audacious use of the U.S. mail system? Frankly, I didnot know. At any rate, I purchased one of these books via the mail systementitled Inside The Space Ships by George Adamski. However, prior topurchasing the book, I examined it and found a very vulnerable legal Achillesheel. Adamski's 'heel' in this case was: '...I do have witnesses to one of myjourneys in a space craft. Both are scientists who hold high positions. Oncethey are able to make a statement, the picture will change overnight.However, the way things are nowadays with everything classified as security,for the time being the scientists must remain in the shadow. When theybelieve that they can release the substantiation they have without jeopardizingeither the national defense or themselves, they have said that they will do sothrough the press. How soon that will be? Your guess is as good as mine.\"On the strength of this statement, which in a sense is scientific corroborationof his experience, the book ceases to be a product of his personal opinion andbecomes a statement of fact open to question by legal means.\"Irate with the government's lassitude in challenging the 'charlatans,' I decidedto force the issue myself. The book in question was George Adamski's. It wasmy opinion that he should be brought to Federal Court where he could proveby use of the testimony of his two scientists that he really had been on a spaceship from another planet. Of course, this would also have given thegovernment their opportunity to press the case and when he was unable toproduce the aforementioned scientists, they could prosecute Adamski for theact of fraud committed by illegal use of the U. S. mail system.\"I called an attorney friend and explained the situation. I said, 'This is a hotone. You can back out if you like.' He answered that in his opinion, I had acase. Out of respect to the various agencies involved, my lawyer decided tocall in a certain federal representative to act s a go-between. At first, thisrepresentative thought that we were just kidding, but my lawyer convincedhim that we were serious. We gave him our plan of action. 'Do nothing until Icheck' was his advice. We waited and finally he suggested a letter of inquirybe sent to a certain agency in Washington. This we did and the answer thatwas forthcoming was so evasive that it even angered my very conservativelawyer friend. 'They can't do this to us.'He called the representative and said, 'We're going through with it.' Therepresentative then asked him to please hold off once more until he could getto Washington. Within the week, my attorney called me to his office. He had"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"received the answer which also included instructions for all parties concernedto deny any connections with the statement. The statement itself came fromMr. A. D. of a certain top agency in Washington. Said A. D.: 'Yes, I did have acase for Federal Court. However, by use of the injunction if necessary hewould prevent anyone from testifying in court concerning this book becausemaximum security exists concerning the subject of UFOs.' My lawyer, aftercarefully pointing out the fact that if the injunction was used, I would be lefthigh and dry and would be pen for countersuit. He suggested we drop thecase.\"I still believe that I have had my personal rights tampered with. I still believethat the men who market their books by the mail system should be caused toshow proof of their statements. This is the latest the government could dotoward protecting the people who, because of a lack of official information,'go for these publications.' Mine is only one small fist beating on the hugesoundproof door to City Hall. It is, it seems to me, more the rule than theexception nowadays that the individual and his rights are becoming a lostlegion in the quicksands of security.\" Hardest to measure in my quest for authoritative information was the depth of thescientific well of thinking. Most scientists, fearing public controversy or that they are goingtoo far out on a professional limb, usually eschewed off the inquisitor before he could say\"flying saucer.\" On the other hand, there were a few with preconceived ideas about theuniverse who volubly attacked every suggestion of saucers from space. To the newspapers,tired of saucers, these utterances were a welcome relief. Usually, they found enshrinementon the front pages or in hot weather editorials.To the layman, however, who believed everything he read, it meant that Science had castits lot and that saucers were, as Dr. Harlow Shapley said in 1952: \"...a complete lot ofnonsense.\" Or as Dr. Walter Cornberger said in 1956: \"The only true flying saucers arethose you see when you have an argument with your wife in the kitchen.\" Or as Dr.Clifford Furnas, former Assistant Secretary of Defense, said in 1957: \"People who reportflying saucers just see spots before their eyes.\" But to the saucerite, these men were not atrue sampling of scientific thinking. They were either \"talking with their feet in theirmouths,\" or were paid to talk that way!For the more qualified opinion on inside-science, I quote in part from a letter receivedfrom Ward Kimball, Director of Walt Disney's Tomorrowland: \"...The most interestingaspect of creating the factual space travel television shows for Disneyland has been theexciting contacts we've made with the scientists, engineers and physicists connecteddirectly or remotely with the government guided missile and artificial satellite programs.The one question that seems to start the fur flying, good-naturedly and otherwise, is whenwe ask, 'What do you think about flying saucers?' The answers range from, 'It's veryabsurd!' all the way to 'If a flying saucer landed on my lawn tomorrow, I would not be atall surprised!'Realizing the importance of first-hand information, I once tried my luck at the personalinterview. It was in October 1954, after getting a barrage of clippings covering a greenfireball incident in New Mexico. I phoned Dr. Paul Herget, Professor of Astronomy at theUniversity of Cincinnati, who is now one of the heads of the Navy satellite program. I toldhim about the fireballs and remarked that I had talked with Wright-Patterson about thesaucer question. Before hanging up, he agreed to see me privately at the observatory. In itsdome was a 16-inch Clark telescope, but it was also Dr. Herget's sanctuary for asteroidresearch, of which he was the world's authority.When Dr. Herget and I met at the observatory, I explained that the purpose of my visitwas to get his professional advice on saucers. For some reason, I felt uncomfortable.Maybe it was the severe furnishings of the room: the old wooden staircase, thestraight-back chairs, the mustiness. Getting to the subject, Dr. Herget was first to speak.\"Do you have security clearance?\" he asked.I replied that since I left Air Force Intelligence after World War II, I had none. My presentresearch was strictly civilian. As though operated on a pushbutton, the atmospherechanged. Turning red, Dr. Herget said harshly,\"I take a dim view on the whole subject.There's absolutely nothing to it.\"I suggested the known evidence; the reports of trained observers.\"I take a dim view on the whole subject,\" said Dr. Herget again and cited one or twoexamples in which he swept away every sighting report on record. To his knowledge, therewas no evidence! He made it clear that flying saucers were anathema!"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"\"But what of the sightings by amateur astronomers?\" I asked. I was thinking of severalrecent reports reaching me from sincere observers using good telescopes. Dr. Hergetresponded quickly. He said he had little faith in the amateur's reports, adding that theywere not qualified to identify anything in space. I could feel my patience fading. \"For thatmatter, sir,\" I countered, \"how can you prove you're seeing asteroids?\" I knew this was thewrong thing to say.It was. When I next asked about the Norwood Searchlight Incident in which Dr. Hergetwas involved, he vollied: \"Nothing to it. Just gas! I tell you, I take a dim view of the wholesubject.\"By this time, I had taken a dim view on the whole interview. I gave up, thanked him for histime and left feeling more baffled than ever. But I kept wondering why he had asked aboutsecurity clearance? I also wondered what might have been said if I had the necessaryclearance?Other scientists were not openly pro or con. One leading astronomer and an authority onMars wrote from Mt. Palomar: \"I wouldn't mind commenting about 'saucers' if I really hadanything worthwhile to say about them. I haven't kept up on this. I'm still not convinced oftheir existence, but have an open mind on the subject. I'll have to wait until I actually seeone. Then I probably won't have my glasses with me so my observation will be worthless.'Willing to go on public record, but playing his hand cautiously was astronomer James C.Bartlett, Ph.D. In a Baltimore lecture in March 1956, Bartlett said he was positive saucersexisted and were controlled mechanisms. But from there, he admitted his convictionsfaded into speculation. Bartlett said it is not impossible that the objects come from anotherplanet, but the probability is that the answer is to be found on this earth. Following thelecture, he admitted he had seen both discs and cigar-shaped objects which he could notexplain.Also on the conservative side was Alfred C. Loedding, former civilian head of the first AirForce investigation into flying saucers and a Princeton University aeronautical engineer.According to the Trenton, New Jersey, Times, Loedding had stated unequivocally thatthere were such things as flying saucers. He based his statement on more than 100 reportsreceived from airline pilots, test pilots, Air Force officers and other reliable sources.Perhaps the most striking revelation of inside scientific thinking came by letter fromcorrespondent Horacio Gonzales of Caracas, Venezuela. He quoted the statements by threeAmerican scientists who were interviewed by the local press while visiting Venezuela inDecember 1954.1954 Letter from Horacio Gonzales, Caracas, Venezuela:\"Dr. H. Cross Sabine, once on the staff of Cornell University: \"If they are notthe experiments of any nation on earth, then they must come from some otherplanet.\"Dr. Kurt Metheus, once on the staff of the faculty of Physical Sciences of theUniversity of Michigan: \"We cannot disbelieve what has been said about theflying saucers - atomic explosions may be the motive for the strange visits.\"Dr. Wilson Henry of the University of Pennsylvania (in paraphrase): Saucersare not the result of imagination or mass psychosis, but are space shipsmanned by beings from the planet Mars.The U. S. news wires did not carry the statements. But the date of the press account issignificant, for it coincides with information I heard at that time which told of a U. S.military and scientific team sent to Venezuela to investigate reports of a series of weirdsaucer events.Perhaps the real clue to the Pan American affair was revealed by Coral Lorenzen in herAPRO Bulletin from Alamogordo, New Mexico, published in early 1955. Through herinformant, Gonzales, Coral published the details of the terror brought to five Venezuelancities by a sudden outbreak of saucer landings and encounters with ugly little creaturesdescribed as hairy bipeds. APRO also revealed, \"It is indeed surprising that no mention hasbeen made in the U. S. newspapers of the Petare, Carora, Valencia and Zulia encounters....Stranger it seems is the fact that Mr. Miller of Business Week; Mr. Arnold Dible ofUnited Press; and Mr. John Schell of North American Newspaper Alliance were all'coincidentally' in Caracas two days after the Petare incident!'Judging by the hushed-up statements of Sabine, Metheus and Henry, all Ph.D.s, perhapswe can better understand the position of scientists in the U.S.; the neutralism of most, thedouble-talk of many and the revolt of a few."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Aroused about the official silence, one American scientist claimed privately that the publicshould be told the true facts before it was too late. Another, a British astronomer, scorned\"Pentagon-minded people,\" while still another noted astronomical authority in Englandwrote: \"I was perturbed to find a renewal of your request for permission to quote from mylunar notes in a forthcoming issue of Orbit because I replied granting you full permissionto use my letter for this purpose sometime in July. Anyway, quite obviously you havenever received this answer, which leads me to suspect that mail is being tampered withamong 'saucer' correspondents. ...More than a remarkable percentage of mycorrespondence has been suffering in this respect over the past two or three years and notall of it has been overseas mailing, either. I wonder what is going on?\"The most celebrated scientists to speak out publicly and giving similar theories were ClydeW. Tombaugh, Ph.D., astronomer and head of the U. S. satellite search; and HermannOberth, Ph.D., father of the German V-2 rocket. Both saw possibility that saucers werefrom another solar system.Further testimony illustrating Dr. Tombaugh's objective thinking is in his statement whichwas written with clearance for publication in this book. Here is the statement:\"I have seen three objects within the past seven years, which defied anyexplanation of known phenomena, such as Venus, atmospheric optics, meteorsor planes. I am a professional, highly-skilled observing astronomer. Inaddition, I have seen three green fire balls which were unusual in behaviorfrom scores of normal green fire balls.\"There might be observations of these objects with theodolites obtainingangles for parallax; thence distance, size and speed. Unless such objects areseen under clouds or in the tangent rays of the sun just after sunset or with apair of observers equipped with theodolites at the end of a measured base line,any other reported heights, sizes and speeds are mere guesses. Most peopleguess badly on such aerial phenomena.\"Most of the sightings can be traced to known phenomena, but some ten orfive percent cannot. But there ar still things to learn about the atmosphere,which may whittle down the percentage even more. I think a great deal will belearned about electrical and ionization phenomena from the InternationalGeophysical Year (IGY) program.\"I think that several reputable scientists are being unscientific in refusing toentertain the possibility of extraterrestrial origin and nature (for UFOs). It isyet too early for any decision of finality.\"Continued in Part 7 - Mysterious Fireballs Connected to UFOs?More Information:For further information about Leonard Stringfield's UFO Status Reports, please see reprintsbelow from the Earthfiles Archives:Status Reports I• 10/25/2005 -- Final Part 6: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 10/13/2005 -- Part 5: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 10/05/2005 -- Part 4: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 09/30/2005 -- Part 3: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary Custody• 09/26/2005 -- Part 2: Retrievals of the Third Kind - Kingman, Arizona Crash• 09/25/2005 -- Part 1: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants inMilitary CustodyStatus Reports II• 09/19/2005 -- Final Part 9: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/17/2005 -- Part 8: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/14/2005 -- Part 7: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 09/06/2005 -- Part 6: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 08/22/2005 -- Part 5: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 08/17/2005 -- Part 4: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/20/2005 -- Part 3: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/14/2005 -- Part 2: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data• 07/12/2005 -- Part 1: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New DataStatus Reports III• 07/05/2005 -- Final Part 15: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 06/20/2005 -- Part 14: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"• 06/17/2005 -- Part 13: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 05/10/2005 -- Part 12: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 05/04/2005 -- Part 11: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 04/19/2005 -- Part 10: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence © June 1982 byLeonard H.
