One of the workers hit something solid like astone and lifted out glob of clay. When the dirt was cleaned off, the workers were surprised to see a brown-colored stone about four inches high and two and a half inches wide shaped exactly like a goose egg. Allaround the egg were carvings. The owner and manager of the post hole project was Seneca Ladd. He wasinterested in geology and historic relics, so he claimed the \"mystery stone\" for his private collection.The dense stone was later identified to be fairly dense quartzite. Today, the stone is housed in the NewHampshire Historical Society in Concord. The Director of Collections and Exhibitions there since 2003 isWesley G. Balla, M. A. I talked with him this week about the mystery stone and asked him to describe thesymbols carved in it.Interview:Wesley G. Balla, M. A., Director of Collections & Exhibitions, New Hampshire Historical Society,Concord, Ne w Hampshire : “All the way around the sides and the bottom, there are a series of images,symbols, pictographs that have been carved or cut on to the stone. The pictographs include a human face, ateepee, and circle on one side.Brownish, dense quartzite stone the shape and size of a goose egg about four inches highand 2.5 inches wide. Originally found in the ground by post hole digger in Meredith, New Hampshire,in 1872. Its origin and age are still a mys te ry.

In another section of the mystery stone are arrows or spears, a crescent over crossed spears, and a spiral."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"In another section, is an ear of corn over a circle that has a number of other figures inside of it, which are hardto make out. They are sort of curved and angled figures.On the very bottom drawn around one of the boring holes is a multi-sided geometric figure. It is very preciseand even in the way it’s drawn, angles. It’s similar to a star, but it’s really a square superimposed on another"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"square, so there are 8 straighter sides than you would have in the depiction of a star symbol. Small Machine-Bored Holes At Topand Bottom of Mystery StoneCOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE BORE HOLES AND AT THE TOP AND BOTTOM? HOW WERE THEYMADE AND WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE?Again, it’s a mystery. We don’t know why they were made or when. We know how they were made, probablyby a metal drill. We’ve had an analysis done which suggests that the top hope is about an eighth of an inch indiameter. The bottom hole is 3/8ths inch in diameter. One is larger than the other. There are abrasions orscratches on the inside of each hole that suggest they were made by metal. When? and who? remains a mystery.AN EIGHTH OF AN INCH FOR ONE OF THOSE HOLES MEANS IT COULD NOT HAVE BEENMOUNTED ON ANYTHING THAT WAS THICK. IT HAD TO BE MOUNTED ON SOMETHING VERYTHIN.Yes. We assume it was mounted somehow, but there is no real context for any of this. No one to ourknowledge has seen anything quite like this. The scratches found in the analysis inside the holes suggests thatthe egg-shaped stone was probably made in recent history, that it’s not a prehistoric piece because NativeAmericans did not have the technology to drill with metal.DID ANYONE EVER TRY TO DATE THE LAYER IN THE GROUND FROM WHICH THE STONE WASTAKEN?No, that is one of the things that is conspicuously absent. It was just viewed as something that was pulled upout of the ground. No one said what level or if there was anything else at that level. It was just, ‘We found thiswhen we were digging post holes.’ That’s been the story since 1927 when it was given to the HistoricalSociety. We don’t even know precisely which spot in Meredith it was dug up. If you don’t have a very precisesite, it’s very hard to date.IS THERE ANYTHING IN MEREDITH LIKE AN ANCIENT EARTH MOUND OR STONE CIRCLES ORSOME VERY OLD GROUND MARKING SIMILAR TO THE OHIO EARTH MOUNDS?Not that I’m aware.HAVE YOU HAD EXPERTS IN VARIOUS KINDS OF PICTOGRAMS AND RUNE LANGUAGES TO SEEIF THE EGG-SHAPED STONE SYMBOLS COMPARE TO ANY OTHER LANGUAGE OR SYMBOLS?No, we don’t know anything about the pictographs.”More Information:For further information about archaeological mysteries, please see reports below in theEarthfiles Archives:• 07/07/2006 -- Noah's Ark Atop Takht-e-Soleiman Peak in Iran?• 03/26/2006 -- \"Anomaly\" On Mt.
