[ See December 15, 2006 issue of Science Express online. ]In January 2004, the Stardust spacecraft flew through comet dust and captured specks of itin a very light, low-density substance called aerogel. Stardust's return capsule parachutedto the Utah Test and Training Range on Jan. 15, 2006, after a seven-year mission. Thescience canister containing the comet particles and interstellar dust particles arrived atJohnson Space Center on Jan. 17. From there, the cometary samples have been processedand distributed to about 150 scientists worldwide who are using a variety of techniques todetermine the properties of the cometary grains.Stardust spacecraft flew through Comet Wild 2 dustin 2000, 2002 and 2004, collecting particles in aerogel.Image and graphic courtesy NASA."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Stardust aerogel collector. Aerogel is as light as air, but is strongand an excellent insulator. Images courtesy NASA.\"A portion of the organic material in the samples is unlike anything seen before inextraterrestrial materials,\" said Scott Sandford, the study's lead author and a scientist fromNASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley. \"Capturing the particles inaerogel was a little bit like collecting BBs by shooting them into Styrofoam.\"The comet organics collected by the Stardust spacecraft are more \"primitive\" than thoseseen in meteorites and may have formed by processes in nebulae, either in space cloudsbetween the stars, or in the disk-shaped cloud of gas and dust from which our solar systemformed, the study's authors found.\"Comets are a major source of the water and carbon on the moon,\" said S. Pete Worden,NASA Ames director. \"Therefore, understanding comets will help scientists learn whatnatural resources to search for on our nearest neighbor in space -- resources that will aidastronauts in exploration beyond Earth,\" Worden explained.Image of the glass needle performing the first series of cuts.Researchers can monitor the progress of the keystone operationfrom the computer monitor or from outside the cleanroom.Several of the analyses indicated that the samples contain polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons (PAHs), scientists said. PAHs are molecules made of carbon and hydrogenthat are common in interstellar space - and in barbeque grill soot.Certain PAHs chemical varieties also contain oxygen and nitrogen. Some scientists believethat these PAHs variants exist in interstellar space as well. They are of interest toastrobiologists because these kinds of compounds play important roles in terrestrialbiochemistry, according to Sandford.\"Our studies of the comet dust show that the organics are very rich in oxygen andnitrogen,\" Sandford said. \"The data are not incompatible with some of it being in thePAHs, but we still have a lot to learn in this area.\"Although some of the other organics captured by the Stardust spacecraft look somewhatsimilar to the fairly stable organics found in meteorites, Sandford noted that many of theorganic compounds appear to be very volatile. One sample even showed an abundance ofmaterial containing alcohols.Many scientists believe that comets are largely made of the original material from whichour solar system formed and could contain pre-solar system, interstellar grains. Accordingto scientists, continued analysis of these celestial specks may well yield important insights"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"into the evolution of the sun, its planets and possibly, even the origin of life.\"I anticipate that people will be asking for and working on these samples for decades tocome,\" said Sandford. \"What we report in the papers that appear this week is just thebeginning of what we will learn from these samples. One of the advantages of returnedsamples is that they are available for study into the future, a gift that keeps on giving.\"More Information:Also see 120106 Earthfiles report about Deep Impact study of Comet Tempel I.For further information about Deep Impact, Stardust and other comet research, please seethe Earthfiles Archives:• 08/12/2005 -- Deep Impact Spectra: Carbonate, PAHs and Some Amino Precursors in Comet Tempel I• 07/10/2005 -- First Data from Deep Impact Crash Into Comet Tempel I• 06/29/2005 -- July 3-4, 2005: NASA \"Deep Impact\" Spacecraft to Blast Hole in Comet Temple I• 01/13/2005 -- NASA \"Deep Space\" Craft Will Hit Comet On July 4, 2005• 06/25/2004 -- Wild 2, An Amazing Comet - Stardust Mission• 08/19/2006 -- Red Rain Cells of Kerala, India - Still No Definite DNA• 09/16/2005 -- \"Planet X\" and the Kuiper Belt's Oddballs, \"Santa\" and \"Easterbunny\"• 08/12/2005 -- Deep Impact Spectra: Carbonate, PAHs and Some Amino Precursors in Comet Tempel I• 07/10/2005 -- First Data from Deep Impact Crash Into Comet Tempel I• 06/29/2005 -- July 3-4, 2005: NASA \"Deep Impact\" Spacecraft to Blast Hole in Comet Temple I• 05/06/2005 -- What Are The Straight Lines on Saturn's Titan Moon?• 04/20/2005 -- Outer Space Impact At Serpent Mound, Ohio, 256 Million Years Ago• 04/01/2005 -- What's Killing Off Marine Life Every 62 Million Years?• 02/17/2005 -- Iapetus and Enceladus: Baffling Moons of Saturn• 01/13/2005 -- NASA \"Deep Space\" Craft Will Hit Comet On July 4, 2005• 12/17/2004 -- Is Our Solar System's Red, Mysterious Sedna An Alien Planetoid?• 11/17/2004 -- European Space Agency's SMART-1 Satellite Begins Moon Orbit• 09/20/2004 -- Part 1: Martian Water Vapor and Methane Overlap in Equatorial Regions• 06/25/2004 -- Wild 2, An Amazing Comet• 03/31/2004 -- Methane on Mars - Biology?
