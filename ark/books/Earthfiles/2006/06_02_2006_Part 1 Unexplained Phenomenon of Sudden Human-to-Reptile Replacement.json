Photo and drawing © 2006 by Earthfiles.June 2, 2006 Southeastern U. S. - Author and UFO investigator, Jim Marrs, and I have shared informationover the past decade about firsthand eyewitnesses who have seen a close family member, or friend, suddenlybe replaced for a few seconds by a standing reptile. For example, Jim heard about such an incident from thedaughter of a prominent Texas politician who saw her father change briefly and then returned to his normalhuman self. Both Jim and I have interviewed another Texas resident who saw her best friend sitting on acouch, suddenly replaced by a sitting “alligator” for a few seconds before the friend returned to her normal-looking human self.Recently, I received an e-mail from a 37-year-old medical transcriber from the southeastern United Statesabout another extraordinary replacement. His short girlfriend disappeared for several seconds and wasreplaced by a tall, blue-scaled reptile. I am using the term replacement because the eyewitnesses do notdescribe visible transformation. The impression is that a human in human clothing is there, then suddenly notthere, and in the human’s place is a tall reptilian humanoid without clothes. The reptile’s scales and gold, orred, eyes dominate the memories of the eyewitnesses who stress the overwhelming and mesmerizing physicalpresence of the reptilian entity before them.To protect the girlfriend’s identity in this case, the man I interviewed calls her “Rachel.” I will refer to him as“Martin.” The date was February 1992 and the time was about 8:30 p.m. in the evening. The couple hadknown each other for about a decade. Rachel had finally moved in with Martin only three months before.Unexpectedly, about three days before the reptilian phenomenon occurred, Rachel had learned she waspregnant. That night, the two were emotional and trying to decide what to do, even though Rachel wasbecoming adamant that she did not w ant to persist w i th the pregnancy. Marti n sai d she di d not l i ke chil drenand that night she seemed determined to have an abortion.I begin now with Martin’s description of what happened as Rachel sat clothed in a white robe on the waterbedand he was standing nearby.1992 photo of \"Martin\" sitting in apartment he shared with \"Rachel\" during February 1992reptile and light phenomena. P hotograph provided by Martin.Interview:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Martin, Me dical Transcribe r, Southe aste rn, Unite d State s: \"She was sitting on the waterbed and we werestill discussing what we were going to do about the child. I was standing maybe four or five feet away fromher. She was sitting on the waterbed in a white terry cloth robe and as she was talking, I began to notice that aman’s face was superimposed on her face. I thought this is really strange. I started blinking a little bit andrealized that it wasn’t going away. It was a very scruffy face. It w as like translucent-looking, so you could tellher body was still there. But the face was different. I could still see her hair, but there was this scruffy manwith a beard who looked like a sailor or a whaler hundreds of years before. I got the feeling that I knew him,or was married to him like in another lifetime or something. So, I brought it up to her. I said, ‘Look, Rachel,I’m seeing this face superimposed on yours.’ And she said, ‘Yeah, I can see a face on you that’s not youobviously.’ At that point, we became sort of mesmerized by this process that was happening.HOW DID SHE DESCRIBE THE FACE SUPERIMPOSED ON YOU?She never did. She never said what she saw. I was so mesmerized by her that I didn’t think at the time to ask. Iwas just so engrossed in the experience.What happened at that point is that she got up. I kind of took a step back and she got up from the waterbed andstood – took a couple of steps over to the landing on the side (about 5 feet from Martin) and sort of set herelbow down. That’s when things got really weird. She didn’t move much. She just stood there like she wasgoing to talk some more and there was this reptilian in front of me.She didn’t do anything except get up, stand there, and in a second, there was the reptilian being there. It waslike things got very quiet and I became very – at that point, your whole body reacts to this. You are like you gointo some sort of shock. Your brain is seeing something that you’ve never seen in your life. You don’t knowhow to explain it. It doesn’t fit into any of the boxes in your mind.The next thing I remember is that a few seconds passed by. Something I remember about the reptilian beingitself was the regality, this sort of sense of importance. So if this was another being from somewhere else thatwas possessing her, this was not an ordinary reptilian. This was a reptilian that was higher up in the socialhierarchy, would be my guess, if they even had a structure like that in their society.GO BACK AS BEST YOU CAN SECOND BY SECOND TO THE MOMENT THAT RACHEL GOT UPOFF THE BED AND DESCRIBE A WORD PICTURE AS DETAILED AS YOU CAN AS SHE IS MOVINGFROM THE BED.She got up from the waterbed and once she got up, I couldn’t see the man’s scruffy face anymore. So, sheapproached me a little bit, and then acted like she wanted to move away and not saying anything, she stoodback against the landing and that’s when I saw the reptilian being for several seconds. Then at that point, thiswas the focal point of this whole experience: seeing that being was so dramatic and so shocking to me becauseit was right there in the room with me breathing right there! Its skin – you could see everything about it.The skin looked wet, not like an amphibious creature, but the skin looked wet. It had a wet texture to it almostlike it was shiny.WHAT COLOR CAN YOU COMPARE THAT TO SOMETHING THAT WE MIGHT ALL KNOW?The closest color is blue indigo because it wasn’t a light blue or purple, but itdefinitely had blue and purple mixed together. It also had like black edges as though the scales had some sortof shadowing or ridges that I was seeing in the light of the room.

Drawing © 2006 by Earthfiles.YOU DID THESE DRAWINGS AND YOU ARE LOOKING AT SCALES, CORRECT?Yes.WHAT ABOUT THE FACE? CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE FACE AFTER THE CHANGE?I saw Rachel standing there propped up against the landing. But then in almost a second, the reptilian wasthere and Rachel was gone. It was not like Rachel’s body looked like a reptilian. It had nothing to do with her.It wasn’t even Rachel’s body anymore. It was a totally different ‘person,’ a totally different creature. Theshape of the head was different than hers. The body shape was different. It did not have her bone structure. Itwas a totally different creature. But the face was what I focused on primarily.COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THE SHAPE OF THE HEAD, THE COLORS YOU SAW AND ESPECIALLYTHE EYES, NOSE AND MOUTH?There wasn’t much of a mouth. It was more like a slit for the opening. There wasn’t much of a nose, either.There might have been indentations that were very small where the nose would be on a normal human. Youcouldn’t really see a lot. But I do think there was a crest somewhere on the forehead area, not very prominent.But there was a small ridge somewhere. I just can’t remember it enough to draw it and say that’s exactly it.The eyes were gold and the pupils were very markedly different from a normal human and were like agoldish-black color mixed together. Compared to the skin, it was really beautiful-looking and the shape of thehead w as general l y smal ler than Rachel ’s head. I’ve been tryi ng to sift thi s through i n my mind, theinterpretation I made when I saw this reptilian – that it was a female. But it was not because of themannerisms. It might have been just because of the general energy of this being at that time my girlfriend? Butit struck me as female, although there were no real female characteristics to the face that I could compare,other than the size. It seemed to be a little bit smaller than I would imagine a male version to be.COULD YOU SEE FEET AND HANDS?I can’t remember. I don’t remember the lower half of the torso at all. I know that in my peripheral vision, Ibelieve that I saw every part of the body. But I was just in so much shock; it was almost like a residual trace tome no w . I j us t d o n’ t r e me mb e r i t.HOW FAR WOULD RACHEL HAVE BEEN FROM YOU AT THAT POINT WHEN SHE WASREPLACED BY THE REPTILIAN?I would say no more than 5 feet away. It was pretty close. Right outside my personal space.IF YOU WERE COMPARING THE EYES OF THE REPTILIAN TO AN ANIMAL THAT I MIGHT KNOW,WHAT WOULD IT BE?I would say a cat.OK, A CAT’S GOLD EYES AND THE PUPILS WERE VERTICAL AND DARK OR?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Yes, the pupils were vertical, not horizontal.WAS THE COLOR OF THE VERTICAL PUPILS DARK?I think it could have been a little bit lighter where the gold was in the middle and then the darker part was onthe outside (of vertical pupils) was like a darker gold. I don’t know if there was any black there or not. It justlooked really strange, not like anything I’d ever seen. Wall Transforms to Light and SymbolsWHAT HAPPENED NEXT?What happened next is that Rachel was there again. The reptilian w as gone and never came back. Immediately,as soon as I saw here standing there again in the very same exact spot, but it’s her now – still we haven’t saida word!Then the entire back wall - to me, my first thought was, ‘There’s a reflection of a swimming pool in here.' Butthere was not a swimming pool anywhere near that part of the complex. But that’s what my brain was tellingme: This is a swimming pool reflection. It engulfed the whole wall. There was no sensation of anything likewater or an association with a swimming pool. It’s just the way it looked.And as we kept looking at it together, there were these brilliant colors that came onto the wall that almostlooked like the most beautiful colors I’d ever seen. Then the geometrically shaped symbols were in thismedium, floating on the wall in these colors.Illustration of wall that transformed into swirling color and symbols after the reptilianhad appeared and disappeared. Drawing © 2006 by Earthfiles.As we were standing there five to ten minutes and the beautiful colors were just unbelievable. It was likesomething from another universe or dimension. It wasn’t like someone had taken a slide projector and putsome colored filters on it. It was really beautiful and these symbols were swimming in this medium that lookedlike water. But there was no water source. There was no reflection, nothing, coming out of the window. That’sthe only logical place it could have been coming from. Even so, a reflection would not have been imbued withall those brilliant colors and symbols.It was almost as if the symbols themselves had meaning to me personally, like a language or some sort of othersymbol language that an extraterrestrial race used that perhaps Rachel and I were part of before we ever camehere to this planet."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"As this occurred, we were both sort of in awe and these symbols seemed to almost melt into us and wouldchange and disappear off the walls. We would see a couple of them floating through this water medium andthen it was almost like they came off the wall towards you and went into your heart, or melted into your beingsomehow.The problem is, I don’t remember anything else. I don’t remember us going to bed that night. I don’t rememberanything after the wall experience, after those five or ten minutes elapsed. I can remember how excited I feltthat something was happening, but I didn’t know what it was.But as far as the spiritual implications of it, there was this feeling that I had been privileged to see some sortof reptilian being that was not of this dimension or of this world and wasn’t really exactly arrogant, but it hadan air of authority about it and an air of spiritual technology – something that I just could not understand. It wasbeyond me, but I could sense it. My gut feeli ng coul d sense that somethi ng important had happened.DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME, DID YOU SAY TO RACHEL, ‘WHAT JUST HAPPENED? I SAWYOU AS A BLUE REPTILE?No, I never told her that I saw that – I never told her at that time to the best of my recollection now that I sawthat.DID SHE SAY ANYTHING TO YOU?No, nothing, as if nothing had happened. I w as so engrossed now in looking at the wall and symbols. At thatpoint, I started to think: ‘This has something to do with the baby she is carrying.’ But it was all in coded form.What was so difficult for me about remembering and writing those symbols down now is not just because somuch time has elapsed since it happened. The symbols themselves seemed to unlock something when we sawthem. It’s like they just disappeared into you.IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ALL OF THIS WAS ORCHESTRATED FOR A VERY SPECIFIC BLOODLINE,WHICH TOOK YOUR SPERM AND RACHEL’S EGG TO ACCOMPLISH THIS PARTICULAR FETUS,AND THE REPTILIANS TOOK IT IN THAT PROCESS?Yes, I’ve often thought that. I thought also that it was almost like a reincarnation nostalgic feeling and it wasalmost like it was a trade-off. Because they did that, then we could see some of these other things about oursoul hi story that w e w oul d not otherw ise have seen i n thi s li feti me. I don’t know w hat Rachel saw . She coul dhave seen all kinds of stuff, as far as I know. But, from my perspective, seeing a reptilian like that was almosta privilege to see this being and then the symbols and all on the wall and the paranormal nature of the wholeexperience. I mean, happening in an apartment – you wouldn’t think that would happen. It really changed me inmany ways. I’m not so, I don’t make snap judgments about people anymore. I’m not so quick to w ritesomething off. It’s made me a lot more open minded and intelligent and conversant about spiritual things. Rachel Leaves MartinAnd what happened in the days and weeks following this event was that our relationship deteriorated verybadly. It wasn’t very long – within 60 days – she packed her stuff up in her car and I never saw her again.IN THOSE 60 DAYS, YOU NEVER ADDRESSED THE REPTILIAN ISSUE WITH HER?No. I don’t think I could have if I wanted to. I was so repressed about it. I couldn’t bring it up. I didn’t want totalk about it.DID SHE EVER SAY TO YOU, ‘I’M DEFINITELY GOING TO HAVE AN ABORTION’? OR WAS IT UPIN THE AIR BY THE TIME SHE LEFT?No, it wasn’t up in the air. She actually scheduled it, went to the appointment and when she came back laterthat day, she had a paper from the clinic that said, ‘This person has been to this clinic and is on medication –like a work excuse slip. Perhaps they took the fetus or something was left there, some kind of residual materialand they thought they were doing a pregnancy termination and they really didn’t. I don’t know. Was Fetus Removed From Rachel DuringReptile's AppearanceIT COULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN DURING THAT VERY STRANGE MOMENT OF THETRANSFORMATION (TO REPTILIAN) AND THE LIGHTS AND SYMBOLS.Yes, because another question about it is: where did Rachel go? Where did she go during those seconds thatthe reptilian w as there? In time, things feel so stretched out when you have something like this happen to you. Italmost gives you the feeling that anything could have happened. An hour could have gone by and you would notknow any better if you had been programmed not to remember.YES, IT SEEMS TO ME SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES JUST BASED ON THE CONTEXT OFTHE LARGER HUMAN ABDUCTION SYNDROME THAT IS SO FOCUSED, IT SEEMS, ONEXTRACTING SPERM, EGGS AND SOME KIND OF GENETIC HYBRID PROGRAM. MAYBE DURINGTHE PRESENCE OF THE REPTILIAN IT WAS IN THE PLACE OF RACHEL WHO WAS SOMEPLACEELSE AND THE FETUS WAS BEING TAKEN?Yeah, it could have been. It could have been that our DNA combining is what actually caused the ability forthis being to materialize here.DID ANY MPRESSIONS COME TO YOUR MIND (ABOUT REPTILE) WHILE DOING DRAWINGS FOR"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"ME?There was just a familiarity connected to this being and I still don’t understand what the whole purpose of thevisitation w as. I want to know if I have a child out there somewhere, I w ant to know ! I w ant to know w hat thiswhole experience was about and what reptilians really are? And why are they here? If they have a negativeagenda? It makes me very angry that they would take my child without telling me about it, or my consent. Howdoes that relate to giving permission on a soul level versus an every day conscious ego level? There are somany questions?I got the feeling from this being that it wasn’t necessarily all negative, but that there was negativity there. Itwas like a neutral feeling.FROM THEM TO US?Yes, from this specific being to me, as if I was a representative of humanity. I’m not sure. Maybe it could be anegative agenda and one reason I sort of feel that way is the secretness. The secret activities. Why don’t theyjust come out and tell me what’s going on? I guess they can’t appear to you because if they do appear to you,you would be scared out of your mind and not be able to communicate effectively with them.And I don’t think we should be frightened to death of them. They are obviously real. I saw it and they are realon some level. I think they are very real. They are actually real beings and that if they really wanted to hurt us,they could certainly. I think they have superior knowledge to us. That is where, I think, this sort of evocativefeeling comes about the reptile in the Garden (of Eden) – that it was tempting Eve to eat from the Tree ofKnowledge. I just think these beings seem like that to us because there is a cunningness, or very weird feeling,very weird, almost overpowering and intoxicating feeling that you get from just being in their presence.AS PERHAPS THEY WERE LOOKING AT US WITH SOME DISDAIN, BUT MANIPULATING US ATTHE SAME TIME?Yes. Obviously, I think they were manipulating me in my life in some way.\"To be continued in Part 2: Another Human-to-Reptile IncidentMore Information:If you have any firsthand experience with a similar, sudden and brief human-to-reptile-to-human\"replacement,\" please email: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.For further information about the possibly related human abduction syndrome, please see reports below in theEarthfiles Archives and my books, Glimpses of Other Realities, Volumes 1 and II; An Alien Harvest;and my documentary films, A Strange Harvest and Strange Harvests 1993, in the Earthfiles Shop.• 05/12/2006 -- An Extraterrestrial School for Humans• 04/28/2006 -- Modern Warfare Applied to Extra-Terrestrial Invasion• 04/03/2006 -- Genetic Harvest in Cimarron, New Mexico?• 03/02/2006 -- Missing Time Abduction Before Birth• 01/27/2006 -- Part 2: Navy Physicist and USAF Geophysicist Discuss UFOs and ETs• 12/02/2005 -- Abduction by Grey ETs in Huge, Black Triangle• 10/22/2005 -- A Lifting Beam Technology in Colorado Human Abduction• 06/20/2005 -- Part 14: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence• 05/26/2005 -- Part 1 - Brazilian Air Force Opens Its UFO Files to Public• 04/28/2005 -- Dozens of Unidentified Aerial Objects Videotaped Over Sonora, California• 03/01/2005 -- Part 1: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence © June 1982 byLeonard H.
