[See link in More Information below.] What provoked Gary to try such illegalaccess was the testimony of a former NASA photo technician, Donna Hare, who said NASA was airbrushingUFOs and UFO-related objects out of photographs on the moon. Gary believes the U. S. and his home country,the U. K., have secretly back-engineered extraterrestrial technologies that could provide energy at this criticaltime on Earth when petroleum is dwindling and the average citizen's gasoline, air conditioning and winterheating bills are rising so rapidly, many people cannot pay them. Gary wants the UFO secrecy cracked openand whatever secret energy systems there might be revealed to the world so cheaper, or free, energy can beaccessible to all citizens.After I reported that interview, I received the following e-mail on June 8, 2006:\"I was listening to the latest report you did with the English \"Hacker\"? and was reminded of anincident that took place after I graduated from high school in Houston. I had a couple of closefriends there and in our senior year we were pretty much inseparable. As it got closer to ourgraduation in the 1960s, we were finding jobs to make money for graduation and deciding whatwe would do about college.One friend in particular went to work in a warehouse at Ellington AFB for a contractor atNASA and his job, as he described it, was he took the pictures brought back from space by theastronauts and they were transferred by a machine he ran to microfilm. During the next threeyears he stayed doing the same job and was not a permanent employee in that when they hadwork for him he was called and as the end of the 60s neared and the moon landings took placehe worked more and more.He go t ma r r i e d b e fo r e me a nd a s s uc h s p e nt mo r e fr e e ti me w i th hi s w i fe tha n w i th me a nd mygirlfriend. When I got married, he was in my w edding and we spoke of an incident he had toldme about before and we recalled that he had seen these in the past but was told not to speak toanyone about them. He was always very cryptic and would only say there were things in spaceand on the moon that were not man made but were machines. Part of his job was if he foundthem (alien machines), he was to report them and log the microfilm numbers.I had no contact w ith hi m for several years and he avoi ded al l attempts for any of us to get hol dof him. Then there was a recent high school class reunion and I had found his name in theregi stry. I contacted hi m to see i f he w oul d be comi ng to the reuni on. He w as l ivi ng at the timein the southwest and remarried. He was trying to see if they w ere going to be able to come andhe would let me know. I sent him several emails and we had set up a slight communication untilI said I had not heard from him since I had asked him about the pictures he had worked with atNASA. He has had no communication with me since and will return no calls. Strange.\" The next day, I received the following e-mail about one female's experience with extraterrestrial biologicalentities in Akron, Ohio, in 1995, at age 9.\"My 1st and only encounter occurred in my home town of Akron, Ohio, when I was the veryyoung age of 9. First let me state that a few days before leading up to my experience, I wouldalways feel like I was being watched, and I would often be awakened with bright lights thatwould strobe through my bedroom.Well,it all happened on a hot summer night in 1995. At that time I would always sleep with mycovers over my head due to the constant feeling of deeply being watched.The night was muggyas I was restless under my covers and I felt that same presence only stronger then ever this timeright next to me.The tension was so terrifying that I was overwhelmed with an impulse toconfront the unknown. So I threw the covers off of me and turned to face it at the sametime.What I seen only added to my fear.The visitor stood about 4 ft tall. It had a transparent greenish blue texture like that of NorthernLights, and it had very little to no features. Its eyes were large and almond-shaped and itresembled to be what everyone recognizes now days as a 'grey.'In a fit of panic I quickly covered myself with the blanket hoping that it would leave me, but asI lay there it literally tugged at the blanket and it w ould persistently tap or touch me as if to tell"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"me to face it. Let me state that there was an overwhelming feeling of fear to an extreme. Sofighting the fear and realizing that the being w as not going to leave, I once again pulled thecovers off of me and confronted it only to find that there were two more of them. Besides thevisitor next to my bed, there was one at the foot of my bed and one in the door way of my room.Now, around the same time that I made contact with the visitors' eyes, I found myself paralyzedand unable to move or speak. As I tried to speak, all that would escape was a mere whisper.They then telepathically spoke among each other through me in some sort of strange gibberishtype of language. After their conversation, I blacked out, felt myself being lifted off my bed andcarried off, and then I felt myself being lowered back onto my bed. So I seem to have some sorto f mi s s i ng ti me .These beings seemed to almost be in a partially physical form. I could actually almost see mydresser through the visitors. I am now 20-years-old and even though this happened years ago, Istill remember it like it was yesterday. It truly changed my life.\" Also, on June 8, 2006, I received the e-mail below following up my Earthfiles reports about people whohave seen a girl friend and a good friend suddenly and briefly \"replaced\" by a standing-up-lizard or reptile,without explanation or understanding of what happened:\"I don't have a replacement story for you, but something from my high school days has alwaysbugged me. I went to school at East Central High School in Tulsa, Oklahoma, from 1964 to1967. In around 1965 or so, a family moved into our school district from overseas (father wasmilitary) and the kids enrolled in school. I think there were four that enrolled, and one of thosewas extremely strange.He had pale blue eyes with vertical pupils. It was always kind of creepy being around him, butthe family as a whole was very social and outgoing. The parents even hosted some partieshaving kids over from school. It was explained to me that the boy was adopted along with hissister when they were stationed in Germany.I never really understood why someone would adopt when you already had kids, but strangerthings have happened. Stranger yet, none of the kids are listed in our school registry from thattime.I have never seen or even heard of humans with cat eyes.\" Update : More e-mail about vertical pupils in humans:Received on June 19, 2006:\"I, too, have been 'puzzled' about two instances of seeing those vertical pupils in human eyes(which I had always understood was not possible to be vertical, just by the nature of the humaneye design). I am not talking about misshapen pupils from eye injuries, called 'broken yoke,'that we've all seen in people. I mean both eyes had totally vertical pupils, both eyess ymme tr i c a l .The first time was a boyfriend. I was standing at the bathroom mirror putting on make-up and hewas standing behind me in the doorw ay, so I w as talking to him while looking at him in themirror. I saw his eyes and the pupils were distinctly vertical and I must have said somethinglike, 'What's wrong with your eyes?.' He left the doorway and wouldn't let me look at his eyes.He said he'd been told about his eyes by other people in the past, so this must have happenedbefore. I don't recall ever seeing it again in him. (He was Hispanic with very dark eyes and thepupil was not as noticeable as in light colored eyes, so to see the pupils in the first place wasbizarre, let alone that they were vertical!)The second time, I was in a hospital and the girl who was in the other bed had eyes withvertical pupils. I remember the pupils were black and the round colored part (cornea) washazel colored. Just a human eye, except for the vertical pupils-clearly, distinctly VERTICAL!She also said something to the effect that she was aware how they looked (I guess I must haveacted astonished).I have asked numerous medical people if eyes can have vertical pupils, and no one has everseen this. I asked a psychiatrist even, since they can prescribe drugs and maybe a drug doesthis, but he said he had never seen it. I cannot find any information in medical books when Ilook up 'pupil' either - just references to the 'broken yoke' effect from eye injuries.Over the years I have just remained puzzled by these two incidents. Hope this helps in yourinvestigations.\" Received on June 18, 2006, from Donna Lee, www.trace sfrombe yond.com:\"One of the strangest experiences I’ve had, happened 18 years ago at Disneyland. My husbandand I were in the process of relocating from Northern California to Kansas and decided tospend part of our last Christmas in the area taking our 2 year old daughter to Disneyland.In an attempt to economize we stayed just outside the park in a motel that provided bustransportation into the park. We boarded the bus early the next morning, grabbing one of thelong, bench-like seats that face each other behind the driver. After we settled in, my daughter"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"fell asleep in my arms and I began to take in my surroundings. I noticed a little boy about mydaughter’s age sitting directly across from me. His hair was so blond it was almost white, andhis eyes were a brilliant blue. His eyes...that’s when I noticed his eyes had vertical pupils!I had never seen anything like it before and tried to find a rational explanation. Did he havesome sort of genetic syndrome? He seemed mentally normal and I’d never heard of anythinglike that. Was he blind? No, I could tell by his movements he was’t blind. As I pondered overthis unusual little boy, I noticed the sandy-haired man sitting next to him, w ho I assumed washis father, was intently watching me watch the child, and he had the most sinister, slight smileon his face. I was completely taken aback by his stare, so I turned away.Just then the bus pulled up to the stop in Disneyland and my husband, daughter and I were thefirst to get off. As soon as we debarked, I asked my husband if he had noticed the boy with thevertical pupils, but, he had not. I turned around to search for the boy and the man so I couldpoint them out, but they were nowhere to be seen. I watched for them all day but never didcome across them.\" Received on June 18, 2006, from a radiologist:\"There's a medical condition called coloboma, that has a split iris, sometimes looking like andcalled 'cat's eye.' There was a kid living in the retirement apartment where my grandparentsstayed for several years who had it, and it really was difficult to look him in the eye! Can'tremember for sure if it was one or both, but I think it was both eyes. His dad was themaintenance man for the complex. That boy's condition was associated with a syndrome inwhich half the body is often small (hemiatrophy or hemihypertrophy) and was also associatedwith Wilms tumor of the kidney. I think coloboma can also be an isolated sporadic or geneticoccurrence, or can occur from eye injury.\"[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - \"A coloboma is the term used to describe a holein one of the structures of the eye, such as the lens, eyelid, iris, retina, choroidor optic disc. The hole is present from birth and can be caused when a gapbetween two structures in the eye, which is present early in development in thewomb, fails to close up completely before a child is born. A coloboma canoccur in one or both eyes.\"] See further information at Shands Health Care.I appreciate hearing from Earthfiles viewers and radio listeners about your own firsthand knowledge andexperiences concerning these subjects, or other earth mysteries.
