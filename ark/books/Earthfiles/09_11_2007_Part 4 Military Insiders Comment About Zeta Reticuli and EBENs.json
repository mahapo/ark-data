The Greys have crude telepathic abilities compared to the Ebens and the Greys are more reckless. They aren't as compassionate as the Ebens either. But in truth, I don't think the Ebens have always explained to us what they are doing like they are supposed to (by treaty?)\" L eft: Drawing of Grey entity by L.

Illustration © 1990 by Hingwah Hatch for Linda Moulton How e. \"Linda, I think the EBE Type I and II are connected and II are either Eben androids or are involved with the Greys, or both. The study of the different types was never my assignment.\" \"What is the relationship between the Greys and the Ebens?\" \"They were enemies at one time. They are supposed to live without war today, but the Ebens have no control over the Greys. The Greys do their thing and the Ebens do theirs.\" \"Is there a pecking order among the alien types?\" \"To the best of our knowledge, no cooperation exists between the different alien groups. And I think there was a war about 6,000 years ago between the Ebens and the Blonds over territorial rights to a planet somewhere. I don't know if it was out at Zeta Reticuli or around her or what.\" \"So, both groups, the Ebens and the Blond humanoids, make android creatures to do work for them on different planets?\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"\"That's what I understand. Androids come in many different types - insect, humanoid MIBs (Men In Black), and others. All have an advanced implanted brain that can operate on its own or by remote control. Ironically, we think some of these genetically engineered creatures have a higher intelligence than their creators.\" \"Is Bigfoot working for any of these groups?\" \"I don't know.\" \"So, there are the Ebens, Greys and the Blond humanoids. Are they the main groups you know about?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then below the Ebens are the Big Nosed types, Eben scientist types, Men In Black, Reptoids and small worker drones?\" \"Yes. And sometimes I think they have made, or work with, small blond humanoids, which really confuses the picture!\" \"And the reptilian humanoids?\" \"The androids can be reptilian. Both groups - the Ebens and the Blond humanoids - can make robots or androids that can be anything they want them to be. Both groups know how to mix and match genomes in DNA easily. Remember, they are millions of years advanced beyond us.\" \"Recycling of Souls is Machinery of the Universe\" \"Sherman, you said there was Eben genetic experimentation in Tibet. Does that connect somehow to the Dalai Lama? I'm thinking about reincarnation through different beings and different cycles of life. Would that concept relate to an Eben supposedly telling an Air Force Captain in 1949 that recycling of souls is the machinery of the universe?\" \"Exactly. There are only so many souls that just continuously recycle.\" \"Through life form bodies that are containers?\" \"Right. Exactly.\" \"And if there are more containers than souls, what happens?\" \"I don't know. But souls are interconnected in some way. I think they told us that because the Ebens have been around so long, they have learned that there are only so many souls in this universe which must be recycled.\" \"If there is a finite number of souls in the universe and the Ebens know that and yet we are living on a planet in which there is an exponential increase in the number of bodies, does that imply that not all bodies can have souls?\" \"I guess you have a point there.\" \"And if not all body containers have souls, would the Ebens and Blond humanoids have some stake invested in souls - like souls could be the coin of the realm, so to speak?\" \"That's possible, I guess. I never thought of it that way before.\" \"Some abductee researchers such as Dr. Leo Sprinkle, a Wyoming psychologist, and Harvard University psychiatrist, Dr. John Mack, have stumbled onto what appears to be a continuity of the same Ebens or Greys present from human life to human life because the same alien being comes up in past life regressions at births and at deaths.\" \"I don't know. All I do know is that the soul - when the body container dies - the soul contains or maintains or keeps some thoughts or something from that life that was just lived.\" \"Is there a connection between Buddhism and Eben philosophy about the cosmos?\" \"Yes, if you go back and study the ancient Tibetan scrolls written in the earliest Sanskrit we have, that's Eben writing. We now know that some Tibetan scrolls written in ancient Sanskrit were actually written by Ebens and those scrolls seem to be made of something that never ages. I was on a team once that traveled to the Bhutan region to make sure the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Eben scrolls were safe. The scrolls the Ebens wrote on are indestructible, but the paper the monks wrote on is very fragile and falling apart. The monks know there is a difference. Some of their scrolls never wear out and those are the Eben writings.\" Can the Body Container Damage Its Inhabiting Soul? \"Did you learn anything more about souls and containers?\" \"It said in the Yellow Book that the Ebens are concerned about human souls if our particular species continued on its course. They are afraid we would damage our container bodies and that could damage the souls.\" \"Our body containers would damage our souls?\" \"Yeah.\" \"How?\" \"I don't know. I realize the containers are the human bodies. And that was why the Ebens were so concerned with what we have been doing, the wars and so forth. The Ebens are afraid that the souls will be damaged by our containers.\" \"One of the MJ-12 guys, who had seen more of the Yellow Book, talked to me about an analogy. He said that when you put something in a container and you pour it out, there's always some residue that remains. Something remains in that soul, so when you pass the soul on in different containers, it picks up the residues of all the different containers it has been in and a little of each remains and stays throughout. I guess there's an eternity, there's no end. That's a question I asked him: 'Does the soul wear out after so many recycles?' \"The MJ-12 guy answered, 'No - souls never wear out. The Supreme Being makes sure that does not happen.'\" While reviewing this text, attorney and research colleague, Michael Pill, of Shutesbury, Massachusetts, wrote to me: \"The notion of the 'soul picking up residues' might explain why we have memories of past lives. It might also explain why, after spending thousands of years and who knows how many wretched lifetimes trying to work out the karma from one or more evil incarnations, one can still feel the enticing charm of 'the dark side.' Those seven deadly sins are like predators - they've got you before you realize they are there.'\" T o be continued in Part 5 - Jesus Christ and the Devil More Information: If viewers have more information about non-human encounters, please email me at earthfiles@earthfiles.com For further reports about non-human intelligence, technology and interactions with Earth life, please see reports below in the Earthfiles Archive and my four books: An Alien Harvest; the 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities; and Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles in the Earthfiles Shop: EBENs (Extraterrestrial Biological Entities) • 08/30/2007 — Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 09/04/2006 — Part 1: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - M ilitary Visitor to Another Planet? • 09/05/2006 — Part 2: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - M ilitary Visitor to Another Planet? • 06/18/2006 — Viewer Letters About NASA Airbrushing Photos; EBENs and Rept ilian Humanoids • 05/12/2006 — An Extraterrestrial School for Humans • 03/17/2006 — Part 1: U.S. Navy Chief Yeoman Describes \"Extraterrestrial Biological Entities\" in TOP SECRET/MAJIC Photographs. • 03/23/2006 — Part 2: U.S. Navy Chief Yeoman Describes \"Extraterrestrial Biological Entities\" in TOP SECRET/MAJIC Photographs • 02/10/2006 — Crashed Disc Photos, \"Ebens,\" and Area 51 \"Anti-Gravity\" • 10/05/2002 — Part 1 - Two Scientists Describe Extraterrestrial Biological Entity (EBEN) Called \"J-Rod\" • 06/22/1999 — The Strange Story of J-Rod, An EBE"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Non-Humans and Aerial Craft • 08/24/2007 — Orange-Red \"Fiery\" Aerial Spheres • 08/01/2007 — Part 3, Non-Human Blonds, Greys and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Lizards • 07/31/2007 — Part 2, Non-Human Blonds, Greys and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Lizards • 07/26/2007 — Part 1, Non-Human Blonds, Lizards and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Greys • 07/28/2007 — Mysterious Aerial Lights Over Stratford-upon-Avon, July 14, and Farnborough, Hampshire, on July 22, 2007 • 07/14/2007 — Schofield Barracks, Oahu, Hawaii - Huge, Lime Green Oval Craft Hovered Over Battalion Headquarters • 03/14/2007 — Part 5: Mysterious Events At 2005 Tawsmead Copse \"Insectogram\" Crop Formation • 02/12/2007 — Part 2: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers and Listeners • 01/26/2007 — Part 1: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans • 01/26/2007 — Part 2: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans • 01/26/2007 — Part 3: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans • 01/08/2007 — Updated: Attorney Describes His Encounter with Non-Human Entities • 01/02/2007 — Grey Aerial Disk Reported by Chicago O'Hare United Airlines Pilots and Mechanics • 10/28/2006 — Close UFO Encounter by USAF Eyewitnesses • 12/31/2006 — Part 8: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue • 10/19/2006 — UFO Retaliation to U.
