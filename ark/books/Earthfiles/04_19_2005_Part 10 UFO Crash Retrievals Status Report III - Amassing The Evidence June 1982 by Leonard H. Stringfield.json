Army, Munich, Germany, 1968 Return to Part 1 To be more computer-friendly, the reprint has been divided into parts. Here begins Part 10 of Status Report III, written in June 1982. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report IV begins at Earthfiles 021205 . Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. Leonard H. Stringfield: (continued) CASE B-8: 1979, Autopsy of Tall Humanoids \"On January 14, 1982, Dr. Gille answered my request for a summary of his probes and his opinion of the Fumoux story. His appraisal follows: January 14, 1982 Letter from Dr. John Gille, Centre National De Richerche Scientific, Paris, France: '...I met this gentleman, Mr. L. B. Visse. But I had not the opportunity to check everything which would have been of interest about him (lack of money, time, maybe courage). I just talked to his employer on the phone, Brother Roy, the principal of the denominational school Visse taught at. I spoke to a Sister (or Mother) who was also in charge at the same school (her name is in my files in Paris). She, too, knew Visse. These two ecclesiastics provided me the precise address of Visse: Souitte (the hamlet where his house was), St. Pourcain-Sur-Sioule (a town between Moulins and Clermont-Ferrand.) I remind you that Mr. Visse assured me he was not the man involved in the mortuary of the Fumoux story. In fact, that he was not ever involved into any aliens' autopsy affair! (That later wit, in French, let me hoping that he was not so naive, after all.) I have no definite opinion if he was indeed the right man or not. For me, it's 50% yes and 50% no. Visse had indeed knowledge about cover operations. He had the appearance of a country (French) doctor. Shabby clothes, but very much at ease with himself. It seemed to me - but it could have been my imagination - that he was accustomed to military ways of thinking and behaviour. But all that is merely intuition from my part. As I told you, I have no further hard data. More, Prof. Andre Lwoff swore to me that he had never had any knowledge about a Visse as a biologist. In the Fumoux story, the witness (Visse?) was supposed to be a member of the Lwoff-Monod-Jacob team (1965 Medicine Nobel Prize Laureates.) I strongly presume that Fumoux used the prestigious references as a device to emphasize, to give weight to, his story. On the other hand, Visse was absolutely unmoved by the Fumoux story when I told him. I mean, he did not show any surprise. He was not shocked at all by the odd subject (Lwoff was shocked a lot!) In short, I believe Fumoux knew something about alien/retrieval affairs. But what he knew was certainly distorted and worse, we have (my analysis) the proof he further distorted whatever he had as data. (Analysis not published because of length). "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Fumoux, I felt at the time - and my companion felt the same - was a little (or more than a little) afraid of his former employers. (A few years ago, he was in the French Air Force. I did not verify it, but I am sure because of the knowledge, attitudes, jargon, etc.) That was one thing. But he told us he was approached during the time he was in the service by officers from the French Intelligence services (S.D.E.C.E. ?) Air Military Intelligence. He told us that he did not want to work for them. So, he had to eventually leave the service. What I was able to check was that he still had ties with these Intelligence people. What makes the testimony of Fumoux really important is that he delivered it to me before your bombshell at the MUFON Symposium in Dayton, Ohio. He had no way to be aware of your work. Situation Red, The UFO Siege was already available in French when I meet Fumoux, but he had not read it. He had read almost no books on Ufology. More, stories of alien occupant retrievals were totally discredited among the ufological community prior to your disclosures at the Dayton Symposium of July 29, 1978. The latest data available to the average ufologist were derogatory comments about the book by Frank Scully (out of print in French since the fifties). In conclusion, if unfortunately the Fumoux story is just a set of lies, I think it was scheduled and monitored by other people than Fumoux. In this case, we would have to unmask the 'other people.' I am ashamed of this long passage about Fumoux, but it's a little difficult for me to convey in a letter the different and subtle assessments I have because of his key testimony. I am in favor of us telling this story as we know it with the names (Fumoux, Visse, Gille). It's the only data we go on. Without them, it's just another flying saucer story, good enough to be told to grandchildren before a fire. Again, I emphasize the difficulties of communication between you and me. Such things (the Fumoux story) should be examined by both of us directly, without the handicap of mail or phone communications. My employers in France (the C. N. R. S. - National Agency for Scientific Research) respect me for that, even if they don't appreciate my involvement in Ufology. P. S. About the French UFO crash, Fumoux at the time I met him in June 1978 told me another 'unbelievable' story: a UFO supposedly crashed in 1975 (?) at Roissy (Charles DeGaulle airport about 10 miles north of Paris). I heard this from another source than Fumoux - (broadcast) about this incident. It's by no way a proof of its genuineness. I think that the French are pretty eager to not lag behind the United States, even in this matter of UFO Crash/Retrievals! It could be true. It's like for Visse - I would bet 50% - 50%.' Leonard Stringfield Comment: During my correspondence with Dr. Gille, I was led to believe by an 'inside' source that the tall 'basketball player size' alien entities had been in a mortuary of a medical center in Chicago. Attempts to get verification failed as expected. At this time of writing, the case rests on square one. Dr. Gille reminds me, however, that there is a 50-50 chance that Prof. Visse or Fumoux, or both, know the truth and might be playing masquerade. Late word from Dr. Gille, datelined April 16, 1982, Marseilles, France: 'I was able to verify that the Fumoux story about the tall humanoids was told independently to Jean Sider by a young French researcher, Thierry Pinvidic, who assured me he had read the story during a tour in the United States in late 1979. He was unfortunately unable to recall where. ...Exhibiting an independent source for the Fumoux story would be an important step forward.' Feel assured, despite our difficulty with communications, Dr. Gille and I will pursue the Visse-Fumoux affair to greater depths. CASE B-9: 1980, Photos of Alleged Extraterrestrials: Considering the seeming scarcity of Crash/Retrieval reports surfacing from Europe, researchers there, like in the United States following the Frank Scully affair, had for years avoided probing the issue. Since the release of my first two papers and later the book, The Roswell Incident by Berlitz and Moore, there is a new and strong interest. Among those making serious probes is Michael Hesemann of Neues, West Germany. His research in the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"pivotal country between the geopolitical East and West has already provided ample evidence that two aging 'little men' photographs of wide circulation are bogus and above that good deed, has uncovered some new data of possible significance. Concerning one controversial photo which shows a 'little man' escorted by two men clothed in trench coats, Hesemann states in his letter to me of June 27, 1980: '...It was published first in the Cologne newspaper, the Kolner Stadtanzeiger, April 1, 1950. In Germany we have a custom of the April Hoax. On April 1st, everybody tells lies, even the newspapers.' Thus, as his investigation proves, the photo was an April Fool's joke. In his letter of January 26, 1981, Hesemann said his probes found fuel to refute another photo of long-ago circulation. This one shows two American GIs escorting a small figure with head piece [breathing apparatus?] from which is extended a life-support hose to a canister held by one of the GIs. About this drawing of the photograph Michael Hesemann is discussing, The UFO Encyclopedia © 1980 by Margaret Sachs states: \"Artist's rendering of a photograph of an alleged non-human in the custody of U. S. Military Policemen. The photograph was allegedly found in FBI files, accompanied by the notation that it was received on May 24, 1950, from an Intelligence and Security officer at the New Orleans Port of Embarkation. The FBI does not endorse the photograph's authenticity. Drawn by Larry Blazey, UFO Information Network.\" States Hesemann: 'This photo made the rounds in German books and newspapers together with an article about a UFO crash in the Mojave Desert. The story was given to the press by an anonymous GI and because there was no known author, they attributed it to 'R. Logen' (which translates I. Lied) and 'R. Funden' (which means F. Ictitious). The unknown photographer was 'G. Falscht' (translates H. Oaxed). 'The location of the photograph, according to Hesemann, was Wiesbaden, as the large gazebo in the background is an edifice in that city. In this same letter, Hesemann notes his on-going investigation into the alleged Helgoland crash off the German coast which had been cited by Frank Stranges in his book, Flying Saucerama . He states the following: January 26, 1981 letter from Michael Hesemann: 'Some researchers speculate that the crash site might have been Helgoland, near Oslo, Norway. Stranges writes about a Dr. Larsen Loberg from Oslo who investigated the case of a crashed UFO in 1946. But no man with that name lived in Oslo. ...a woman who visited Helgoland (German) in 1961 told a researcher many people in the island would speak about the UFO crash in the North Sea, east of Helgoland. There were many rumors. A business friend of the same researcher said that he heard about a UFO falling into the seas. The Administrator of Helgoland, however, told him: 'No fragments from outer space were found on our island.' Note the cleverness of this statement about no fragments on our island. Nobody said anything about a UFO crash on Helgoland, which is near the island.' In the following excerpt from his letter of March 20, 1982, Hesemann brings a recent development into focus: 'There are many rumors here in Germany regarding an alleged crashed flying disc in the Russian occupied sector of Germany in 1981. One witness, living in Berlin, claims to have seen little aliens removed by the GDR secret agents. In fact, there was a crash of something at the alleged time in October 1981. Newspapers wrote about a green bright object seen in the sky. Scientists believe it was a meteor. It would not be the first recovered saucer in communist countries.' Leonard Stringfield Comment: "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The alleged crash incident in East Germany of October 1981 brings to mind another report of UFO activity over Moscow in October 1981. If there is a tie-in, we will not know. Secrecy around UFOs abound, whether it is in the Eastern or Western spheres of influence. In England, UFO secrecy is well known. In a letter received from Gordon Creighton of the British Flying Saucer Review , March 14, 1982, he states in part: '...Here in Britain, one of our top Defense men, Admiral Lord Hill-Norton, stated flatly on BBC television last week that there is a cover-up and that when he held Britain's top defense job, he still was prevented from knowing anything about UFOs. He said this at 10:15 p.m. on BBC 2 Television Channel in a program called 'Out of Court.' CASE B-10: 1968, Munich, Germany, Military Screening of UFO Film Military movie film on the subject of UFOs classified SECRET (or ABOVE) has been allegedly witnessed by credible informants. See Cases A-4 and A-9 in Status Report II , and Case B-7 in this Status Report III . In November 1981, a researcher, BR, in Catlettsburg, Kentucky, wrote a letter to relate that he had read in Situation Red, The UFO Seige, a reference to crashed UFOs and offered a new source - a former GI, who claimed to have witnessed a military movie on UFOs in 1968. I reached BR by phone and learned that his career in UFO research was dramatic, but brief. Not only had he talked with the ex-GI in 1968, but he also claimed to have had information about a possible UFO crash in Kentucky a couple years earlier. Whatever he had, he believes, it brought strangers of devious behavior to his home who caused such stress to him and his wife that he destroyed all of his UFO records and got out of research. That was 12 years ago. When asked about the visitors, BR explained that as a part time police officer, he considered resorting to house arrest of one visitor who posed as a magazine salesman and showed more interest in his UFO files. He also believes the visitor snatched up an important memo he had on his desk. Two subsequent letters of great length from BR explain his unusual visits and are on file. With records gone, BR said he could be of little help on the crash report, but he would try to get an updated statement from the witness of the UFO movie. On November 22, 1981, I received from BR the following letter which is paraphrased for brevity: November 22, 1981 Letter from BR: 'In 1968, I was introduced to (name confidential) who had just been discharged from the U. S. Army. He was a Spec. 5 in the 7th Army. Just before discharge while in Munich, Germany, he was ordered to report to a building on the base where others had assembled, but not told why. Then an officer in charge explained that they were to see a movie on UFOs. The movie, about a half hour in duration, showed shapes of UFOs - top-shape, saucer-shape, and so on - their ability to hover, speed and manner of sudden disappearance. He could not recall seeing UFO occupants. They were briefed after the movie and instructed to be on alert for UFO sightings States-side and report same to the Army. ...He gave me the impression that he did not want to talk to me about it or to anyone else. I had to assure him I would not use his name. He also said that the narrator of the movie believed that some UFOs had crashed. With that, my source dried up. Leonard Stringfield Comment: I believe that BR's movie source knew more than he said about its content. Under no condition would he talk to me, fearing consequences. Also of note is that BR's concern over one of his visitors gave cause to consider getting his police revolver and making a house arrest, a tactic which was employed by RT in Case A-5. Who were BR's visitors? Because of their nondescript appearance and behavior, they can be dubbed 'M. I. B.s,' but from wherever they came - the CIA, FBI, the KGB or from outer space - they certainly intimidated BR and accomplished their purpose. CASE B-11: 1948, TV Newsreel About Crashed UFO Much like the alleged enforcement of censorship cited in Case A-4, which prevented the distribution of Coronet magazine in 1948 to stifle its story on a crash/retrieval in New Mexico of that year, another case reportedly happened during the same year on television. George Fawcett, veteran UFO researcher, author, lecturer from Lincolnton, North Carolina, gave me the name of Leon Crice to call. Mr. Crice distinctly remembers station WDEL-N, Wilmington, Delaware, being cut off the air when attempting to show a newsreel about a crashed UFO. When I called Crice in April 1980, he said, 'It was about 1948, maybe later, when my wife and I were watching the news on our new TV set. The"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"story was that a disc-shaped object was shown stuck slightly tilted in a sand dune. it had a dome at the top and no windows and Mr. Crice recalled that the narrator said that it crashed on the Mexican border near the Rio Grande. As the film rolled, Crice said it clearly showed soldiers moving around the object and in the background were jeeps, a low boy rig and crane and some Mexicans watching. Crice also remembers that when the narrator mentioned bodies being recovered and that the craft had been shipped to an air base in California, the narrator's voice was cut off and the TV screen went black. There was no station apology, he said, and seconds later the news continued on another subject. Going back to another early year, Richard Hall, Editor of MUFON UFO Journal recalls a UFO retrieval report on radio. Said Hall, in the Journal of July 1981, summarizing a talk he presented on May 21, 1981 at the 5th Annual MUFON Conference in North Carolina: 'I personally heard a radio news report about a crashed saucer and occupants, one said to be still alive, about 1952 while working in a general store. Being young and naive in those days, I made little effort to document the story beyond listening for additional news on following newscasts (which, of course, never came). I could have and should have called the radio station, talked with wire service persons, checked newspapers in a library and so on. Since I did not, the story remains only an interesting anecdote rather than a documented report.'\" Continued in Part 11 - Disc Discovered Near Aztec, New Mexico, 1948 Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
