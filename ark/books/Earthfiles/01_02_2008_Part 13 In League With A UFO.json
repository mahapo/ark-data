Out of print. Return to Part 1 January 2, 2008 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Chapter 8, Meat Market, continued. A lthough Bill Smith had nothing but good feelings toward the Aliens, he was aware that there are some Aliens who stayed in the background and out of communication with him. He was not sure why, but he was thankful that those Aliens did. Bill felt shielded from the bad vibrations of the “ dark ones,” which is what he called the Aliens who struck fear in him, but which kept their distance. The Aliens never disclosed themselves as angels, nor did they mention that there are demons among them. That subject remained unanswered for Bill. It is possible that the Aliens answered, however, when they revealed to Bill that their primary concerns for humans were for the physical parts of humans. Bill understood that the Alien ability to move the soul in and out of the body containers was merely a necessary function of their work, similar to moving the furniture out of a room before cleaning the carpet! Bill was taken aboard the Alien craft shortly after he and his scientists colleagues had experimented with the bodies. The Aliens let Bill dictate the contents of that meeting. Bill's first question to the Aliens was: Why do you "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"not help human people? The Aliens had the capability to cure illness and repair all kinds of damage that did happen to humans. The Alien response was, “We take orders from someone higher than ourselves, just like humans always manage to find someone higher up to pass the buck. So, Aliens, too, follow orders and are passing the buck.” Bill asked if Aliens are both good and bad? The Alien response was: “Unlike humans, who must make decisions based on what each perceives to be right and wrong, in the realm that the Aliens occupy, there is no confusion for them in that department.” On the Alien ship, located in a separate level from where Bill was visiting with one of the Aliens, was a man who had been abducted earlier that day. Even before Bill had this visit with the Alien, the Alien knew exactly what was going to take place. The Alien knew what Bill's questions were going to be before Bill had formed them in his mind. So Bill Smith asked: What was the point of that session with the Aliens on the ship? The Alien replied that there was no point or need for them to have a discussion with humans. The session was strictly for the benefit of Bill, to give him the opportunity to feel comfortable working with the Aliens. The non-humans wanted to give Bill a sense that he could communicate with the Aliens face-to-face if he wished to do so, the way humans do. The discussion ended and Bill followed the Alien to the room where the other human man was kept. The man was lying on the surgical table and was prepped for some kind of operation. This man was in his early fifties and in good health - but not for long! Bill knew what was taking place without anyone saying anything. B ill had watched and was allowed to take part in several similar procedures that were done by the Aliens in the past. Most of Bill's internship involved the removal of tumors or fixing other ailments that plagued the bodies of those the Aliens worked on. The surgical procedure that was taking place at this time seemed sinister or evil. Whatever it was, the Alien surgery left Bill with a sick feeling. During that time, Bill Smith was given another gift: the ability to see into the future, which included the future of the man who was lying in front of him on the surgical table inside the Alien craft. Bill could see the man dying, his body racked with cancer. Bill could see the man's wife in tears when she learns of her husband's prognosis. Bill saw the man's three children - two daughters, sixteen and eighteen, and a 10-year-old son. Bill witnessed the agony that the man and his wife would go through as they struggled with how to break the medical news to their children. Bill then saw the devastation on the faces of the children when they were told. Bill did not want to see any more. All he could think about was his own family and how each would be affected if that happened to him or any one of them. Bill was angry. He shouted at the Aliens: “How could you do an evil thing like this? Are you angels from Hell?” The Aliens reminded Bill that it was not their will to do anything bad or good, but that it was the Aliens' job to do what was told to them to do. The Aliens said they could not elaborate more about that, but hinted that there was more at stake in that particular family than just the dying husband and father. Like many things that the Aliens still have to reveal to Bill Smith, Bill was not yet ready to understand the full implication of that incident. Still, Bill's biggest question was why are the Aliens revealing all this good and bad stuff to him? Was Bill expected to be a liaison between the Aliens and humans? How could Bill, now that he perceives all that is happening to be madness? Until that medical episode, most of what was revealed to Bill he thought was positive and good. Are there invisible requisition orders stamped on people's foreheads, which indicate what each is to have done on them? How do the Aliens determine who gets a tumor or who has one removed? Bill had not yet reached the level where he had that kind of knowledge. Each new step that the Aliens took Bill through, the Aliens allowed him time to adjust. Some lessons required more time than others did. The idea of taking a healthy human being and making him or her ill was one of the tougher lessons that Bill Smith had to get through. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"***** Chapter 9 The Journey to Another Planet Bill Smith was told he would be going to another planet for two months and that he should make arrangements with his family and the committee. His wife was acclimated to the level of security he worked under and accepted his word that he could not disclose where he was going. But she was a bit perplexed that Bill would be unable to have communications with her and the three children for the full two months. In the past, Bill always found ways to communicate with her. The committee members, who saw very little of him anyway, were indifferent about his sabbatical. His superiors were very excited about his going and asked if the Aliens would let him take a video camera with him. He told them that he did not need to ask the Aliens about that. Bill already knew the answer because he did not need to be physically present with the Aliens in order for them to give Bill answers or instructions. All Bill needed was to have a question on his mind. If the question was pressing, Bill received the answer to it instantly in his mind. While Bill was away, the committee decided it needed to make a few discoveries on its own. The scientists had no other choice. Independent research was either possible or the committee should disband, since it was obvious to the superiors that the scientists were adding little to the program when compared to Bill Smith's contributions. Tim alluded to the fact that the committee was ignored by the Aliens because of the group's lack of enthusiasm, which had dwindled over the years. Although Tim had the most respect for Bill Smith,Tim still felt that Bill needed a little competition from the committee. “Why should the scientists be his lackeys?” Tim asked his colleagues. Tim was certain the committee as a whole would make more progress if they were running on more than one cylinder. Bill was the only cylinder that was consistently firing. The rest of the group was just along for the ride. The scientists needed to fire up their own cylinder, or cylinders. Tim had an idea about how to do it. His plan was that the four of them who originally had experienced being inside the bodies should come up with a new project that would involve the use of the bodies. Tim suggested the scientists make a bold move and go on a mission while inhabiting the bodies. Tim was the only one of the four who was excited about that venture. The other three, as well as the rest of the committee, thought it was too risky to enter the bodies without the aid of Bill Smith. Tim told the committee that the group was doing exactly what he had pointed out earlier: their group of scientists had become too scared to do anything on their own. Tim was willing to take the risk and wanted to know who else was willing to move ahead with the program. The problem that Tim faced was that most in the committee had become completely dependent on Bill. Some of them had expressed the fear that the Aliens were not even there to monitor the committee's activities when Bill was not around. Two and a half weeks passed and Tim was not able to convince anyone in the committee to join him. Tim knew it was pointless for him to do it alone. Tim noticed that in those two and a half weeks that the committee was in turmoil and could not agree in what direction to go, that the military did not seize that indecisive opportunity to take control of the bodies. What made it more interesting was that the General who was adamant about getting possession of the bodies a few months earlier no longer showed any interest in them. Tim knew it was not like the military to pass up that kind of opportunity, especially after getting clearance from the majority of the committee. Tim concluded that the General was still under the influence of the Aliens, as Bill Smith had suggested. Therefore, Tim's intuition that the Aliens were still present and watching them must have been correct. If that were the case, Tim and the others would not be in any danger by entering into the bodies. When Bill first told Tim that the Aliens were watching the committee and all of their activities, Tim wanted to believe Bill, but remained skeptical since Tim was unable to see the Aliens himself. Tim came to the conclusion that the Aliens were, in fact, not just watching the scientists, but were present with the group in the same room when Tim and the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"committee were having their meetings. Tim intuited that the Aliens were silently placing ideas and strategy into the minds of the committee members. That was the conclusion Tim came to when during one committee meeting, he had a revelation that he would have an encounter with the Aliens that night. That evening, as he expected, Tim found himself in a spacecraft. The craft was nothing like Bill had described. It was so fantastic that Tim was convinced he would not be able to describe it correctly to the committee either. The Aliens told Tim that Bill Smith never was on this particular craft and that was partly why Bill could not describe it. The real reason that neither Bill nor Tim nor any other human can describe the inside of an Alien craft accurately is because the craft never remains the same. The interior of the Alien ships is in a constant state of flux. The change is so subtle that the human mind is fooled. The environment that Tim was surrounded by changed more than twelve times while he was there. Yet, Tim was not aware that it changed at all. Tim was on board the craft less than one hour, but that night was the longest in his life. The Aliens revealed more to Tim on his first conscious abduction than the Aliens had revealed to Bill Smith. Tim had benefited from what Bill had already learned and was prepared for more information from the Aliens. Tim did not see the exterior of the craft, but from what he observed of the ship's interior, it had to be at least as big as two football fields. Unlike some of the shows on television, there were no Aliens coming and going in the hallways or lounging around in an interstellar bar lounge. Apparently, these Aliens stay in one location for long periods of time. These Aliens did not seem to be concerned with taking coffee breaks and gossiping about co-workers or “doing lunch.” Alien lifestyle is light years different from how humans carry on their daily activities. The size of the craft indicated to Tim that there had to be hundreds of Aliens on board - what other purpose could such a big craft have? It did not appear that the Aliens were ferrying humans around. There were none on board that Tim could see. It was possible that just as Tim was unaware of the changing features of the craft that he was also unaware of all the Aliens that reside inside the ship. As Tim explored the craft, he saw on several occasions Aliens in the distance. But once Tim walked to where the Aliens had been, they were no longer there. Tim remembered that this Alien craft had a huge inner court or atrium that was about eleven stories high. At the top was a clear bubble, a huge window to outer space. It also served to magnify the size and brilliance of the stars. The ship was not in motion - or at least Tim did not think it was. If it were in motion, Tim felt no sensation of movement. Looking out through the top of the atrium, Tim had a spectacular view of the Earth and the moon. Tim was located on a level about half way to the top of the craft. Still, the method or type of glass used for the atrium cover made it look as if the stars and the planet Earth drifted in front of his face. It was so wonderful that he could have stayed there forever. Tim was marveling at the stars when an Alien approached him. He was not caught off guard by the Alien - he was aware the Alien was nearing and heard a comforting voice tell him not to be afraid, even before the Alien appeared. The voice was telepathic and sounded human, not metallic as some abductees said in past interviews. By the time the Alien arrived and greeted him, Tim was completely in a relaxed state of mind. What helped Tim keep his composure was the fact that the Alien revealed the many encounters they already had with Tim. The Alien triggered something in Tim's memory and Tim realized he knew that Alien. Still, this was more than a mind-opening experience. Tim fought hard to maintain composure. He was grateful that the Aliens talked to him telepathically. If Tim had to speak through his mouth, the Alien would have heard the chattering of his teeth. That bugged Tim. He always thought there was little that could scare him. Now he knew better - and from that night on, Tim was not as cocky as he used to be. The next day, Tim told the committee about his contact with the Aliens. He told his colleagues that the Aliens want the scientists to enter into the bodies and cry out an assignment for the Aliens. The instructions given were to go to a house that was in one of the suburbs of a city not far from the committee's base. The name of the city was deleted from the report. The scientists were to"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"take a van and some of the objects and equipment from the craft. There was no list given to Tim by the Aliens about what he needed for the mission. Tim intuitively knew what to take when he entered the craft. and he informed the scientists that they did not need to worry about using the equipment to transfer themselves from one body to the next. The Aliens, Tim explained, would monitor the group the whole time. Again, the committee members were miffed for being excluded from direct contact with the Aliens. After all, the committee members felt like they were in as deep as one can be when it came to Alien phenomena. The scientists told Tim it would not be a horrific revelation to them if they saw an Alien. Some of them have seen one or two from the first possession of the Alien craft back in 1947, although the scientists had only seen the Aliens from behind thick glass and for a brief period before the Aliens were whisked away by another government agency. Tim actually had an answer for his colleagues. He told them that the Aliens could only show themselves to humans who have gone through a series of preparations, something similar to human inoculations. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Inoculation is the placement of something to where it will grow or reproduce, and is most commonly used in respect of the introduction of a serum, vaccine, or antigenic substance into the body of a human or animal, especially to produce or boost immunity to a specific disease; but also can be used to refer to the communication of a disease to a living organism by transferring its causative agent into the organism, to implant microorganisms or infectious material into a culture medium such as a brewers vat or a Petri dish, to safeguard as if by inoculation, to introduce an idea or attitude into someone's mind, any placement of microorganisms or viruses at a site where infection is possible such as to increase soybeans’ nitrogen fixation one can treat soybeans at planting with Rhizobium japonicum inoculant. The verb ‘to inoculate’ is from Middle English ‘inoculaten.’ which meant ‘to graft a scion (a scion is a plant part to be grafted onto another plant); which in turn is from Latin 'inoculre' or 'inocult.’”] If the series of inoculations are successful, the Aliens put that individual into a certain category. That category determined if, and to what degree, that particular human can participate with the Aliens. There are hundreds of programs where humans are used to perform certain functions for the Aliens. Only a fraction of humans get to the stage that Tim and Bill had achieved. The Aliens themselves do not know with certainty which humans will emerge from the inoculation and at what level until the final stage. Therefore, who in the committee - if anyone - would be next to cross that threshold? Answer was unknown. Tim was told that the inoculations were to protect the minds of the humans and, to a lesser degree, the physical body. The Aliens emitted energy from their bodies that could damage human tissue and interfere with the human psyche. In some cases, the energy the Aliens emit triggers psychosis in humans. There were other elements of the Aliens and their craft that are harmful to humans, but the Aliens did not disclose details to Tim.
