Originally leaked to Bob and Ryan Wood for their Majestic-12 documents project at majesticdocuments.com.

[ Editor's Note: The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) was proposed by U.S. President Ronald Reagan on March 23, 1983, to use ground-based and space-based systems to protect the United States from attack by strategic nuclear ballistic missiles. The initiative focused on strategic defense rather than the prior strategic offense doctrine of mutual assured destruction (MAD). The research and technologies of SDI paved the way for some anti-ballistic missile systems of today. The Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) was set up in 1984 within the United States Department of Defense for the Strategic Defense Initiative. It gained the popular name \"Star Wars\" after the title of the 1977 George Lucas feature film, the first in a series. Under the administration of President Bill Clinton in 1993, SDI was changed to the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) and its emphasis was shifted from national missile defense to theater missile defense; from global to regional coverage. BMDO was later renamed Missile Defense Agency (MDA).] "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Return to: More Drone Photos and Other Eyewitnesses Return to: Birmingham-Type \"Drone\" Seen At Barksdale AFB, La., in Mid-1980s.
