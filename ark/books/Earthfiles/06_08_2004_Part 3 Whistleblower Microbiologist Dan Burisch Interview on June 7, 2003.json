Click here for Part 1 May 23, 2004 Las Vegas, Nevada - On June 7, 2003, Bill Hamilton - then Executive Director of Skywatch International - was given permission by microbiologist Dan Burisch, Ph.D., to interview Dr. Burisch on-the-record as a whistleblower in a videotaped session attended by five other researchers with their own videotape cameras. The subjects were Dan Burisch's 1994 work with the J-Rod entity at the S-4/5 underground laboratory, Area 51, Nellis AFB, Nevada; the Doctrine for Converging Time Line Paradox (DCTP); and Dan's concern about the future of this planet. Here is Part 3 of that June 7, 2003, videotaped interview in Las Vegas, reviewed and corrected by Danny B Burisch, Ph.D. (His family says his middle initial has no peri od. See birth certificate in More Information below) In this section of the interview, questions were asked by Bill Hamilton and the others. The questions are ALL CAPS wit hout specifying specific questioner, except where specifically noted for Bill Hamilton. Interview, Part 3: Telepathic Communication with J-Rods "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION AND THE NATURE OF IT. WHAT IS IT ACTUALLY LIKE WHEN YOU COMMUNICATE WITH ONE OF THESE BEINGS TELEPATHICALLY? I could hear my voice and it was like you hear yourself think. I could hear my voice (inside my head). However, the cadence, the affect, was something that distinguished it (as something) other than me. It was no great booming voice from the heavens or anything like that. And I'm glad I do not have a proclivity to hear voice in my head, and I have heard none since! (laughs) I could tell it was somebody other than me and I could tell because I felt drawn towards the subject (entity) that was sending the communication. When the J-Rod spoke with me prior to the bombardment of images, it was something that was part of me, but not part of me. I actually felt non-resident for a moment (out of my body). It was almost an OBE (out of body) type feeling and then I could feel myself pull back and experience the sound (inside my head). It was physical! It was more real than touching an object. That's the only real time that I ever felt anything more physical than physical. WAS THERE ANY CONVEYANCE OF EMOTION? 100% emotion. If he was upset, I could feel his pain. It got to the point where as I was doing the needle introductions, I could feel what he was feeling. So as I would inject the needle under the integument (arm muscle) and find my proper location prior to removing the sample, I could feel the needle entering him. So, I could feel his feelings. Robert Lazar and S-4 and Area 51 Robert Lazar had a U. S. Naval Intelligence tax form for the year 1989, the year that Bob said he traveled four times to S-4 Area 51 as a subcontracted engineer to examine the propulsion apparatus of a disk-shaped vehicle identified as non-terrestrial. Photograph 1989 courtesy Robert Lazar. WERE YOU AWARE OF BOB LAZAR ANY TIME YOU WERE THERE? I saw a guy out on the tarmac outside of the Galileo and 4-1 area who was barefoot. He was just standing and staring off into the distance. This was as we were coming in from a helicopter. They keep you within a very confined walking area. This was before they started taking the buses, we were choppered in. When I saw him subsequent to that when he did the famous (Las Vegas Channel 8 TV reporter George) Knapp videos, it could have been him. This was early on. This was I can't prove it. I couldn't positively identify him. I am aware of his name being mentioned out there and it was associated with the term, 'bottle washer,' which means an engineer but not a Working Group Leader or anything of the kind. They would have said a 'director' or a 'geek.' I was called a geek. His name was mentioned. I heard the name 'Lazar.' I did not hear Bob. I heard Lazar and it was not 'laser.' It was 'luh-ZAHR.' But I never had any interaction with him or anyone else from Ga lileo, Side Kick or radionics."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Medical Treatment for J-Rods? HOW SUCCESSFUL WERE YOU IN ASSISTING THE J-ROD MEDICALLY? Temporary assistance, temporary relief of pain. Temporary meaning for weeks. Temporary adjustment of muscle tone and then flat out nothing. He got worse. The exacerbation got out of control. Since then, there have been and I'm not certain if he's still resident there or not now. There has been a progress let's say progress involving what I was yammering about earlier concerning the Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT). Their (J-Rods) DNA is triplets. And it's not triplets in the way you would think of a number 3 helix wrapping around a major group of Watson-Crick double helix DNA. Their DNA is triplets to the extent that there are what we nickname 'hangars.' They look like they are rosettes. Their DNA looks like rosettes. They are triplets in that they are a super-coiled DNA situation. We had difficulty even doing anything, let anything like a single step marker or anything like that. We had difficulty even sequencing the DNA. Homo sapiens sapiens Is Result of J-Rod Manipulation of Genes in Already-Evolving Primates on Earth Our long intersperced nuclear elements in our genes that have been shut off that when combined with the appropriate Hoogstein base pairs produce a different being, what we were before they made a mistake, a grave mistake. (Editor's Note: Hoogstein base pairs were the first base pairs observed in X-ray crystallography experiments and not the Watson and Crick base pairs.) DID THEY MENTION ANY EXCHANGES (BETWEEN J-RODS AND HUMANS)? There have been exchanges going on since well, they spoke with us in 1941. Connection with Fatal Prion Disease? WHAT WAS THE NATURE OF THE EXCHANGE? They wish to find a resolution to the broken resonance between 'they' and the other half of 'they' the so-called 'Orions' and 'Zeta Reticulans.' They also wish for fear of extinction to have a relief of the paraprotein-related problem. Speaking about that just for a moment, we found out that some of the disease process under which they are (trying to survive) is a PNA it's a peptide nucleic acid, which is a protein-associated background nucleic acid. That protein associated background is a prion. (Destructive prion disease?) That leads to one of the things they wanted me to do at Sweetness. They are dangerous, were dangerous. \"T-9 Treaty\" and Trying to Prevent Catastrophe in 2012 But the exchange process is to solve the problem to prevent what went wrong in 2012. And the rogue group of the J-Rods are not cooperating with that. But a deal has been brokered for the T-9 Treaty to be held in abeyance until 2005 (March 15, 2005) When that treaty is up in 2005, once they have received what they've asked for and they should be receiving a little more. I've already mentioned some of that material that they are not aware of yet. DNA material and some of the things we can do with the nucleotides that could possibly help with the problems. But once that's up, they are supposed to come under the auspices of the general agreement between the Committee of the Majority and the respective societies (of J-rods and Brothers). If so, nothing will get turned on (star gates on Earth)"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"except what Nature and God are providing us in 2012 and we w ill separate. However, they (J-Rods and Brothers) will remain as they are their future selves as well they will remain as they are and we will remain as we are (Homo sapiens sapiens). We can't go back. That's just something that's impossible, what they've been told the Looking Glass people and the people who are overseeing STAAR FLOWER, ERBs (Einstein/Rosen Bridges) and all of that. CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT? IT'S SO COMPACTED. LET'S STRETCH IT OUT A LITTLE BIT. IT SOUNDS MORE LIKE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY (J-RODS) ARE GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS EXCHANGE. I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHAT WE ARE GOING TO GET? Oh, we're going to get not wiped out! BECAUSE THE PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE IS NOT TO BE WIPED OUT (IN 2012)? Threat of Einstein-Rosen Bridge \"Star Gate\" Time Machines The biggest problem is to make sure that there are no human-created ERB (Einstein-Rosen Bridge) machines (Star Gates). It sounds science fiction, I know, and it's hokey-sounding. OK? But to make sure there are none of those in existence which can automatically turn on when the next age begins on December 21, 2012. We are apparently going to cross over the plane of the galaxy in which there is a dense network of wormholes. There is supposed to be some sort of enlightenment. Whether or not that's the Christ event or whether that's a burp on a Sunday morning, I don't know what that's going to be. I'm not enough of a scholar in that area to figure that out. I do know that failure would result in too much energy being directed at our planet from our own star. And hence, my interest in looking at the pretty SOHO pictures of our sun. The pace at which these unusual forms (more intense solar flares? Worm holes?) are being produced is increasing. ARE WE ENTERING AN AREA AS WE APPROACH THE EQUATORIAL PLANE OF THE GALAXY WHERE THERE IS A GREATER CONCENTRATION OF DUST THAT CAN SURROUND OUR SUN? So I've heard.\" ( Editor's Note: Priscella Frisch at the University of Chicago and Mark Landgraf with the European Space Agency in Darmstadt, Germany have respectively studied the gas and dust in which our solar system moves. No gas and dust of any appreciable density is expected to affect our solar system in the next several decades.) Einstein-Rosen Bridges (ERBs) and \"Worm Holes\" WHAT THEY ARE CALLING ERBs (Einstein-Rosen Bridges) - NOW CALLED WORMHOLES ARE THERE NATURALLY OCCURRING WORM HOLES? There are a number of nodes on our planet of what I am understanding that are naturally sensitive electromagnetically? I don't know, but are naturally sensitive to the space through which we pass. These nodes activate spontaneously when we pass through them (worm holes) or can be struck with electromagnetism and be temporarily opened. WHAT HAPPENS IF WE USE A MACHINE TO OPEN AN ARTIFICIAL WORM HOLE? There are two different things. One, they have been putting Saddam Hussein did put two of them together in Iraq which conformed to the ancient cylinder seals which are now missing"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"from the Baghdad Museum. Obviously, some one looted them. They were looted by the \"best,\" I'll put it that way. HAVEN'T YOU BEEN INVESTIGATING A SITE WHERE THERE IS A NATURAL WORM HOLE? Frenchman Mountain. (Las Vegas, Nevada) Frenchman Mountain, location of the vishnu schist and granite geological Great Unconformity, near Sunrise Mountain on eastern edge of Las Vegas, Nevada marked in yellow below. Photograph © 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe. YOUR WORK CONTINUES ON FRENCHMAN MOUNTAIN? Yes, it does. Our remote viewing unit first brought the notion that this could be a wormhole situation. Yes, we have employed remote viewers for it. Since then, there have been occurrences at the mountain that are far afield from the research I have been doing for the LOTUS Project. Those are two separate things. I originally went there (Frenchman Mountain) with a team to do an endosymbiotic research program. I was trying to nail down book about the McMenamin hypersea theory.\" (Editor's Note: In 1994, Mark McMenamin, Prof. of Geology at Mount Holyoke College, introduced the theory that life forms that moved from the sea to the land diversified to a far greater extent than marine life did. In his book, Hypersea: Life on Land , the \"hypersea\" theory was called one of \"seven ideas that could change the world\" by Discover magazine. Later in 1994, McMenamin proposed that the 600- million-year-old fossils he discovered in Mexico-the oldest ever found-didn't merely push back the timeline for the earliest animals, but indicated an entirely new division of life, a division (now extinct) that was evolving heads and nervous systems apart from animals through a process called \"convergent evolution.\" The contemporary implications of his hypothesis are profound, providing evidence that the potential for development of humanlike brains is not a unique occurrence in our universe.) "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"\"Ganesh Particle,\" Seed of Life \" And also I had presumed that we were looking for what past we were in (given the time convergence paradox). So, I was looking for an artifact that might interact selectively with ourselves. That's when I fell into the issue involving the \"Ganesh particle\" when a flare (of light) passed across the surface of some algae during a test. We found out that the flare and it's included in the report that flare is associated with the speed that the Ganesh particle passes. So, for a Ganesh particle, it was actually overly flaring on us that day. It was May 31, 2001, at Frenchman Mountain. You have access to one of those reports that I'm aware of. CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THE CURRENT STATUS IS AT THE PRESENT TIME? We're in a chimera (Dan's metaphor to illustrate the multiple temporal l oop overlays).\" ( Editor's Note: Greek mythology - fire-breathing she-monster with a lion's head and a goat's body and a serpent's tail; daughter of Typhon, Greek Mythology.

Past, Present and Future Time Lines on Earth and Mars \"What we see for instance I mentioned earlier - ruins on the moon and Mars. You are probably aware that I was involved in Inca City research (on Mars). That's because the J-Rod that showed me (telepathically) the Inca City image, but didn't show it to me as a dead city. He showed it to me as a future city a living, breathing, society post-damage, post-catastrophe, here."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Mars Global Surveyor image of \"Inca City.\" Credit: NASA/JPL/Malin Space Science Systems. We are literally looking at things that are present, but according to a linear time line, have not been built yet! Now if that isn't confusing!! You said you wanted me to explain what the hell I was talking about if that's not confusing, it confuses me. According to the Doctrine of Convergent Timeline Paradox, the J-Rods to solve their para-protein problem used these ERBs (Einstein-Rosen Bridges) to go back in time. Some of them were worshiped. They were treated as gods and temples were built for them. It's so science fiction! It sounds like poppycock, I know. But this is what I got in exchange for the information that he gave me, so what the hell. Literally, there are two or more concurrent time lines that we are living in. Two separate existences. What that means exactly? That's what I read. What that means exactly, I'm not sure. I am intellectually limited in that area. I t ook some philosophy, but I'm intellectually limited in that area. And I don't want to present something that I don't know is fact. But, to solve their problem, the J-Rods messed around with us even earlier than when they were treated as gods. They went back (in time), were treated as gods, and then went further back before. In other words, they could select the time line (they enter here on Earth). How they do that? I have no clue. They manipulated our original DNA and removed a single strand from us (of DNA). This made us able to mate with another experiment that was underway at the time called Neanderthalensis . And yes, I know there is no genetic evidence concerning the mating between the Neanderthals and the other brand of our kind ( Homo sapiens sapiens ). That's because all the genes have been turned off. Any of the unusual mating sequences aside from retro-viruses that tagged along were turned off as part of our long intermittent sequences (so-called 'junk DNA'). They are part of the great repeats. In fact, in Neanderthals, take a look at the number of long interspersing elements that they have in their genomes and that will bear out what I'm saying. I THINK THERE IS A NEW ARTICLE IN THE NEW SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN BY A WOMAN ANTHROPOLOGIST WHO SAYS HER RESEARCH SHOWS THAT HOMO SAPIENS SAPIENS DID MATE WITH HOMO NEANDERTHALENSIS AT SOME TIME. It has been believed that the cross-breeding mismatched our chemical and structural architecture neurophysiologically and that was one of the primary promoters for the problem that the J-Rods now suffer. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT GOING TO TWO DIFFERENT POINTS IN THE PAST: ONE NOW AND ONE EARLIER. WHAT EXACTLY IS THE DOCTRINE OF CONVERGING TIME PARADOX? It's the paradox of k illing your grandfather. If you k ill your grandfather, you cease to exist. Michio Kaku, from what I can glean from his work, would say, 'No. It would cause two"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"separate universes, or two separate time streams.' But in accordance with the Doctrine that I read, his theory does not take into account that those two time streams could occur simultaneously that the reality could be mixed! Which is why there are so many confusing data sets involving everything from fossil finds to strata. It's why there are so many conundrums involving the speed of planetary formation. There was a recent thing out that I read about our planet being formed in a very short period of time, much shorter than they had counted for the accretion period. The way it came through to me was that it was (my source) was a Keystone DCTP flyer.\" (Editor's Note: Keystone DCTP: the process of engineering molecules with desired properties is the keystone of molecular evolution. It is achieved through a repeating process of changes in the DNA, followed by screening or selection of the optimum sequence. The changes in the DNA occur in evolution as a result of recombination and mutagenesis. DNA shuffling describes a combination of in vitro recombination of related sequences and a low rate of random point mutagenesis in one experiment. If the size of the template DNA is too similar to the size of the pr oducts, it is necessary to digest the template DNA enzymatically. Deoxycytidine 5'-Triphosphate (dCTP) : Radioactive Nucleotides .) \"That these things are happening simultaneously. That a planet can form at one rate and the reality can mix such that we can perceive it having formed at a separate rate. And then you can go back and look at it at another time and have another perception because the realities are actually mixed. ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT SOMETHING ONE DAY AND THEN GO BACK THE NEXT DAY AND IT WOULD SEEM DIFFERENT BECAUSE A DIFFERENT TIME LINE HAS COME INTO PLAY? Yes. Biologists, chemists, natural philosophers, call that 'error.' If something falls outside the acceptable range of error, they call it 'non-written' because you would call it non-publicized and they would not get their funding. That's the nature of the Big Business of science. And I asked a guy associated with my mentor at SUNY (State University of New York). His name was Carl and he had a problem in Louisiana, let's say that. He jumped ship and he wanted to measure some things having to do with free radicals. This will give you an idea of what happens if you piss people off and where you don't get enough funding. He had funding ten days prior to his separation (from the University), but they separated him anyway and he lost his funding. If you don't show the progressive upkeep for the funding, you are not there any more. It goes much deeper and wider than 'publish or perish.' T-9 Treaty with J-RODS WHAT IS IT IN THE (T-9)TREATY WE HAVE (WITH THE J-RODS)? WHAT IS IT WE ARE TRYING TO WORK WITH AND THEY WITH US? 100% cooperation in getting rid of the ERBs (Einstein-Rosen Bridges time machines now on Earth from past interactions of the J-Rods coming back in time and leaving the ERBs on this planet) in exchange for 100% cooperation to solve their physical problem and to attempt their rejoining (in this timeline). That's a big, big order. Where that will go? I'm not sure. However, the project under which I'm working right now might help some. Dan Burisch Research of the \"Ganesh Particle\" WHAT IS YOUR CURRENT WORK? It's an electro-physiological resonance which is present around, in and through our DNA, which it is believed by some of the more esoteric people to come via the Supernal Triad,"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"the Divine Sephira Tree of Life, which holds us together as intellectual and emotional beings. It is that dualism that keeps us in sync with the universe. WHAT IS YOUR WORKING ENVIRONMENT LIKE NOW? I'm in an environment I'm not going to get personal here I'm in an apartment environment. There are children around me, which is wonderful. I direct the project from that location. I do some minor microscopy work from there. Nothing of a hazardous nature, no more than dust would be hazardous to you. In times of need, I transfer to various fac ilities, not worldwide, but nationwide and work within those facilities under whatever the protocols that we need to complete. Those facilities are wide-ranging such as Dulce, New Mexico, the Shady Rest Site 4, the Groom Lake facility, Brookhaven National Lab (Long Island), the Los Alamos area (New Mexico) of the T-5 section proper, and recently in this little event near Los Alamos in the Alamo Canyon. As well as give testimony, I had to show some evidence when I was there to a mirror. (Someone) was sitting on the other side of the mirror, so I hear. As God as my witness, there maybe was not anyone on the other side of that damn mirror! But they told me they were. TO DEMONSTRATE RESULTS? To demonstrate data, yes. Show data sets relative to Project LOTUS. YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS EXCLUSIVELY FOR HOW LONG? Since 1986. I've played with local jobs around town (as cover for microbiology work). That's when I was Danny Crain. YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH EXCLUSIVELY ENGAGED IN A PROJECT WHICH IS FUNDAMENTALLY TIED TO THE FUTURE OF OUR SPECIES? It is. Fundamentally. This project without getting too deep into it, this project is an all-encompassing attempt to grab for the brass ring and make sure that that brass ring is not the fruit of the Tree of Life. To grab just until we get to that point. Aside from that, I'm not going to try to barge my way past the East Gate of Eden. The people who do that get hurt, at least so I've heard. IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE BRIDGING WHAT WE HAVE CALLED PHYSICS AND METAPHYSICS INTO ONE THING. Indeed. And that's not even pop metaphysics, but ancient esoteric sciences. For millennia, we've conceived of the supernatural and that supernatural interaction with humankind. What we are seeing in this project that it isn't so much supernatural. It's natural and it's there with us all along. We just haven't taken the time to look. In fact, our lab procedures have been mutually exclusive to find what we have now found! they would destroy or mask over the process we are now beholding. These particles have the ability, in essence, to bend light. In the report, you'll see a series of images that show clearly where the particle is changing into the shape of a yeast cell ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ). It's masking the closer it gets to it, the more it masks. But when it passes by, it looks like it. Then when it gets in close proximity, the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing steps out and it does its business. Meanwhile, the average biological investigator has ceased looking. The protocol has moved on. He or she has scaled a slide and has seen two eukaryotic cells and has moved on! HOW DO YOU WANT TO GET OUT OF ALL THIS NOW? 'Getting out' is a loaded term right now. I don't know where it's going to go, but what I do foresee is that if that same elected U. S. government is interested in information, I do see myself providing that to my elected government as I have been sworn to do so. Whether or not I'm prevented from doing so, we'll find out. Again, we all have to go some time. I see that as the logical step because once the information is presented to the elected government and once I'm no longer officially held. And it's not just the information"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"involving the Lotus. There are military applications associated with it as well, biological applications. Once that information is no longer a constraining factor (I want) freedom. Whether or not I'll end up on the chopping block, I don't know. But (I want) freedom, nonetheless. DO YOU KNOW WHO YOU SHOULD YOU BE TALKING TO? No. I would think that oh, God, I would not know which Congressional co mmittee would need to bring me under their authority! I don't know which one. There has to be one with the right name on it. Once that's done under the appropriate circumstances, I w ill tell them everything that I know, so help me God.\" Upcoming at Earthfiles: Field trip with Dan Burisch to Frenchman Mountain where he has studied \"Ganesh Particles\" and Einstein-Rosen Bridge (ERB) worm holes.

He is 40 years old now, born on February 2, 1964. His birth certificate name was Danny B (no period) Crain. I have met and talked with his mother, Dodie Crain, and with Dan Burisch, Ph.D., who confirm the name change after his marriage. Copy of Danny B Crain (aka Dan Burisch) \"Certificate of Live Birth\" at 4:28 a.m. on February 2, 1964, in St. Francis Hospital in Lynwood, California - a suburb of Los Angeles. Birth certificate provided by \"Dodie\" Crain. In 1990, he married Deborah Kay Burisch who had a child from a previous marriage. Five years later in 1995, Dan legally changed his last name from Crain to Burisch to match the child's legal last name. In 1989, as Dan Crain graduated from SUNY Stonybrook with a Ph.D. in Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Dan was at the same time employed by the U. S. Navy's DOD Naval Research Laboratory. His rank was Captain and his title Microbiologist IV. In 1994, he was assigned to work in an underground laboratory at S-4/5 at Area 51, five floors under the Papoose Mountain installation at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The fifth floor is accessible only by one secure elevator. Dr. Burisch said in the years 1991 to 1994, he suited up in the fifth floor underground laboratory in an astronaut-type suit with breathing and urination hoses. His assignment was to enter a round, \"clean sphere\" f illed with a cold atmosphere of 4% by volume hydrogen and other gases including argon. Inside the clean sphere was an entity originally called \"extraterrestrial\" by Dr. Burisch's government superiors and later described as a \"time traveler\" from 50,000 years in the future. According to Dr. Burisch, his boss reported to a MAJI committee, an extension of the Majestic-12 Special Studies Group organized by President Harry S. Truman in 1947. Majestic 12 included top scientific, military and business leaders asked to st udy the extraterrestrial phenomenon.
