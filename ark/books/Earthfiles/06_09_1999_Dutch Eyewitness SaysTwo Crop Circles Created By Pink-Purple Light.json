Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Dutch Eyewitness Says Two Crop Circles Created By Pink-Purple Light © 1999 by Linda Moulton Howe June 9, 1999 Hoeven, Holland I have received a report from Europe about an extraordinary event: an eyewitness to the creation of two crop circles in Hoeven, a southern Holland farm community about 90 minutes from Amsterdam. It was early Monday morning, June 7th at about 12:15 AM. This is the first formation in Holland this year. A 19-year-old named Robert woke up and felt compelled to look out his bedroom window. What happened next was phoned to me by Nancy Talbott, Director of the BLT Crop Circle Research Team in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Nancy has worked with biophysicist W. C. Levengood in Michigan for the past several years to analyze plants from formations in Europe, Israel, Australia, Canada and the United States. Levengood hypothesizes that plants in some sampled formations were affected by a spinning plasma vortex that contains microwave energies. The microwaves heat plant cells, softening and collapsing the stems into the fluid patterns we have come to associate with genuinely mysterious formations. But Levengood does not know the source of the spinning plasma vortex. This eyewitness in Holland has now seen two different phenomena associated with the creation of fresh formations which suggests there might be different mechanisms for different patterns. Interview: Nancy Talbott, Director, BLT Crop Circle Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts: \"This is in southern Holland - and it's concerning again this boy, Robert, who has the ability somehow to know when these things are getting ready to happen and who has been in the middle of a formation when it occurred - this was a couple of years ago. And subsequently, there has been a lot of crop circle activity around where he lives. And Sunday night - actually for several days - the entire weekend, he was having these anxiety feelings that he gets, pacing back and forth, feeling unwell physically which is a phenomenon that occurs prior to one of these situations. And his parents insisted that he go to bed finally Sunday evening, which he did. They in fact checked on him before they went to bed and he was sound asleep But what happened is that at 12:15, he woke up and knew to go to the window. He opened the curtains and looked out. His window overlooks this little garden out back and this huge farm field which is directly behind their garden. And what he saw is just incredible! He describes a small, misty, pinkish-purple light - not a sphere, more football shaped - and a little bit smaller than a football, which was coming in over the field at a height of about 10 feet, maybe 12 feet over the field from quite a distance away. It's quite an enormous field. He watched it as it came closer and closer and closer to this spot that is about 50 meters behind his house. And this is where one of the snow circles occurred a couple of years ago. There was a circle in mustard seed there last spring. He's had a couple of circles in other crops in that general area. Came right back to this area and stopped - the word he used was \"hanging\" - just stopped in the air "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"and hung over this spot. Then, it started to elongate, spread out is the easiest way to describe it - and it apparently spread out and spread out becoming thinner and thinner looking like a disc, was then how he described it. When it was about 30 feet in diameter, again, still hanging there - not moving at all except for this expanding motion - then he observed what he calls (Nancy makes sh, sh, sh sound) in Dutch for electrical discharge. He and I have these signals we give back and forth because he doesn't speak English too well and I don't speak Dutch at all. And what he means is that he watched electrical discharges coming from the underside of this disc-shaped, misty, pinkish-purple cloud or ball of light for - I would gather - it sounded like six or seven, eight, maybe ten seconds immediately over the field. Then the light phenomenon simply dissipated, was gone. He was very excited, threw on some clothes and went running out the back and squeaked through the hedge and into the field and lo' and behold, right smack where that thing had been was a 30 foot diameter circle - I think it's wheat. They say grain and I'm not sure which kind of grain they mean. And a 10 foot circle very near by, both of which had not been there at 10 o'clock PM when he went to bed. It's still light in Holland at 10 and you can see out whether it was there and it wasn't. And here they were. DID IT DISAPPEAR, FADE OUT OR WHAT? As best as I could get it, the electrical activity stopped and then it just like POOF! WHAT''S THE TIME LAPSE BETWEEN THAT POOFING OUT AND THEIR DISCOVERING THE CIRCLES? Well, he went immediately - he literally took about five minutes to throw on some clothes. He was in the field within 10 minutes, I would say, and there it was. He said he could see it from his window after this light had gone. He could see there was at least one circle, and he thought there were two - and they were in fact there. And it looks like the whole situation - as it was coming in from way in the distance - that might have taken a minute or so to get up near his windows. But once it was there, everything that happened subsequently didn't take longer than another minute - the spreading out and then the discharge of whatever this was, and the whole thing happening. DID HE HEAR ANY SOUND WHATSOEVER AS THIS TRANSFORMING TOOK PLACE? He didn't comment on sound. I think he would have commented if he heard anything, but he didn't mention. What he did say was that when he got in it, he felt this very strong energy and it was very positive, he said. \"Love, love, love!\" IN THE CIRCLES. In the circles. This wonderful surge of energy and his parents told me that he came to wake them up after he had been in the circles - he just sort of sat in this big one, I think, for awhile and then he went to tell his parents because he was so excited. They went and looked at it and they said it was remarkable because every time it happens with this kid, he feels very ill. He is not a happy camper at all several days prior to the event. And it was a transformation - he was full of beans and feeling great and energized and all the illness forgotten completely - which they've seen happen before. WHEN HE WAS WATCHING THIS TRANSFORMATION WHICH FASCINATES ME BECAUSE IT'S RARE - IT'S VERY RARE IN THE LAST 40 YEARS OR SO THAT ANYBODY HAS EVER SEEN THIS KIND OF TRANSFORMATION FROM SOMETHING SMALL TO SOMETHING LARGE, BUT IT HAS OCCURRED. AND I HAVE"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"INTERVIEWED PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN MULTIPLE MILITARY EYEWITNESSES TO WATCHING SOMETHING THAT THEY SAID REMINDED THEM OF APPROXIMATELY 10 - 20 FOOT WIDE ASPIRIN SITTING ON THE GROUND THAT SUDDENLY TURNED INTO A LARGE CRAFT. This is very interesting. He was very clear that it was not a UFO. It was a light, a misty, foggy light, and it apparently retained that character, even when it became disc-like looking. In his opinion, it did not look metallic or solid the way I know many of these reports are. In his mind, or to his eyes, it retained this sort of misty character, even when it became disc-shaped rather than football-shaped. SO IT REMAINED THE PINK, GLOWING. Yeah, and he said he had never seen a color quite like that - it was amazing to him. Pinkish-purple. DID HE EVER FEEL AT THAT POINT THAT HE GOT ANY IMAGES IN HIS MIND AS IF THERE WAS ANY KIND OF TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION? He didn't say anything about that either, although he has had encounters in the past - this time when he was in the field and these small, sort of grapefruit-sized whitish balls were in the field - that was a daytime encounter, two years ago now, and he was simply riding in the field on his bike and had stopped off in this one field that he particularly likes. And observed HUNDREDS of these grapefruit and tennis ball-sized white - milky white sort of opaquish balls, some of which approached him and began circling around him. At which point, he became unconscious and when he woke up he was in the middle of this crop circle - a brand new one. At that time, he also saw an entity - a form - that he perceived as female and it did transmit information to him, or he had the impression of that. And that figure has returned at least one more time - I think two more times - once to the garden out back of his house and once in his bedroom actually. He has a name for it. He thinks he knows its name which I believe he prefers to keep private. He has a name for it he prefers to keep quiet. And it does transmit some sort of telepathic communication about the crop circles being very important for mankind to be paying attention to and he thinks that it has something to do with the environment and deceit - that the crop circles are somehow or other an antidote or there is something about the crop circles that is to fight deceit. TO FIGHT DECEIT AS LYING AND HIDING? Yes, in humankind generally. That something like that - he doesn't understand it all. It's not clear. And he has no idea why he himself is involved, but as a parallel to all this - what has happened with him is that he has developed this incredible apparent healing abilities and he has people coming - he makes appointments all day long - now they've limited it to, I think, three days a week - where people come with all sorts of physical and mental problems and he has some ability that he doesn't understand at all to identify what their trouble is and often to heal them. In fact, apparently in the majority of cases, they become well after a session with Robert. And that happened - all this came about after he started getting involved with the crop circles. IT''S INTERESTING THAT HE WOULD SAY THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH FIGHTING DECEIT BECAUSE THE THING THAT HAS STRUCK ALL OF US OVER THE PAST DECADE IS THEY ARE WORLDWIDE, THEY ARE RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF YOU, AND IT IS AS IF SOMETHING HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO SIGNALING OR COMMUNICATION OUTSIDE OF THE RESTRICTED PARADIGMS OF POLITICAL SYSTEMS."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Yeah. I have to say, I know this boy pretty well. I know his family pretty well. These are very straight, middleclass Dutch hard-working people. There is nothing flamboyant, there is nothing foolish about these people at all. And they have questioned and questioned all this up until fairly recently. And now they have just accepted that it's happening and are doing their best to cope with whatever it means. But I am about as sure as I can be that Robert is simply telling exactly what he saw to the best of his ability. And he himself is trying like crazy to understand why it happens where he is, what he's supposed to do about all of this, and then just proceed. This is apparently the first real crop formation in Holland of this season. There was another flattened area in a potato field about the same time, but the plants in that case were not swirled, were not layered - they were simply dehydrated remarkably, visibly, and flattened very which way. It's not a typical crop circle, the potatoes. But he tends to get trains of thought when this all starts to happen, so I wouldn't be surprised if he's got more to say than what we were able to get on the phone. WERE THERE ANY CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE CIRCLES AND CORRIDORS? Apparently not, and I'm not sure how far apart the 10 foot one was from the 30 foot one, but I gather it's pretty much in the same area. And the area is almost exactly where the snow circle was and this flax seed circle that happened last spring. Here we have two very clear descriptions of crop circles occurring and in different ways. The daylight one were the spheres and you see them all over England and we have photographs from all over. They were clearly involved in that first one that he was in. And now we have this other thing - I've never heard a description quite like this. In Sussex - I remember telling you about the Sussex one a couple of years ago where an elderly man had gotten up in the middle of the night and looked out his window and he also saw balls of lights - what he described - close to the ground, several of them, multiple balls and then lights shooting from the balls down to the ground and back up to the balls. And in the morning, they found a fairly complex formation in that location. So, it seems like the formation process may not be one thing. It may be several. If your listeners are interested in this crop circle phenomenon, and particularly if they are willing to help the BLT Team - what they can do is notify us if they find such an event. And the way to do that is to call the office at (617) 492-0415. Or they can FAX the office at (617) 492-0414. Once they call, I'll call them back so it won't cost them much. And we can then discuss the event itself and figure out whether or not it's one we ought to sample and anybody out there interested in helping the sampling, I'll love you for life! It's a lot of work, but it's very rewarding. It's well worth it.\" More Information: The first unusual patterns in United States crops were recently reported south of Annapolis, Maryland. Several fields had randomly downed cereal crops that have a fluidity in the way they are laid down with multiple layers that cross at ninety degree angles. Over the past several years in the U. S., Levengood has found some of the greatest biochemical and biophysical changes in plants sampled from these odd, randomly downed crops. A similar phenomenon was reported today by an investigator in Illinois near St. Louis where fifteen fields have randomly downed winter wheat that has peculiar scalloped edges and"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"flowing lays \"as if water had swept through the plants.\" Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
