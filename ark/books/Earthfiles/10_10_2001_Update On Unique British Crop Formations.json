Aerial photograph © 2001 by Nick Nicholson, Editor, The Circular Review. October 10, 2001 Wakerley, Leicestershire, England - Nick Nicholson, Editor of The Circular Review in Calverton, Nottinghamshire, discovered an unusual crop formation in barley on Sunday, June 3, at Wakerley village near Barrowden, England. Nick's first e-mail to me with a ground photograph said: \"I found a major formation near our last year's hunting ground between Morcott and Seaton in Leicestershire County.\" He's referring to a year ago on June 6, 2000 when Nick found another unusual formation in barley near Seaton southwest of Wakerly village and Barrowden. Biophysicist W. C. Levengood was involved in the Seaton research and concluded that formation was defined by barley plants that stood at least six inches shorter than the rest of the crop, an example of controlled and very specific retarded growth. The implication was that some kind of energy touched the growing barley in the pattern at least a month before the formation was discovered in the Seaton field.

Wakerley Village Formation, June 3, 2001 About the June 3, 2001 formation, Nick continued, \"No one locally knew of it before Sunday. It's made up of an outer ring I estimate to be 120 feet in diameter and in the middle of the standing crop is a 10-12 foot diameter circle surrounded by a narrow ring. In between the inner and outer rings are a lot of lines and patterns which are hard to ascertain the exact design, but it sure looks good. Attached is ground image which I took. Waiting for aerial.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Discovered June 3, 2001 in barley in Wakerley village near Barrowden, Leicestershire, England. 120 feet in diameter. Photograph © 2001 by Nick Nicholson. At the top of this report is the aerial that Nick later got. Along with the beautifully detailed photograph, he sent me the following written report: \"I had arranged to have a meeting of the local East Midlands Crop Circle Study Group and on the afternoon of Sunday, June 3, 2001, we all sat down in the kitchen of Jane Bertrams house at Grimston near Melton Mowbray. A guest of Jane's, Iris, suggested we start the meeting with a meditation which we all agreed to do. After a few minutes this was terminated and we all were asked what we had perceived. When it came to my turn, I said all I could see during the meditation was swirling crop and then thought no more about it. \"When the meeting ended, I asked the others if they would be interested in coming to last year's area to look around (the site of the retarded growth pattern discussed in Earthfiles June 6, 2001). Bearing in mind that last year in June we had gone out as a group, at my suggestion, expecting to see three known crop circles, but in the process of looking, found two brand new ones. So, I had expectancy of new discoveries that Sunday, June 3, 2001. \"However, everyone had other arrangements. So, I went alone. This was about 4 p.m. on a lovely sunny afternoon and off I went down through Melton Mowbray to pick up the A-47 Leicester to Peterborough Road, crossing it at Morcott. Nothing there. So, down the hill past Seaton. Still nothing around. So, I headed for Wakerley village and up to the highest point beyond the church, found a pull in and got out of my car. I climbed the verge on the opposite side of the road (a high point) and looked to my left (West). To my amazement, there sat a circle about a quarter of a mile away. Barrowden and Wakerley village are circled in red. Seaton is circled in black where the odd 2000 formation consisted of barley plants six inches shorter than rest of crop."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"\"This discovery left me almost speechless and very excited. After all, in expectancy and all the driving around had left me with spirits at a low ebb. And so unexpectedly seeing this glyph so close was quite overwhelming. As I basked in the warm glow of this turn of events, I heard the sound of a motor cycle over the hedge and then a rider and vehicle exited the field. The young man crossed the road on his machine and stopped near to my car. Calling out to him, I engaged him in conversation and ascertained that he was not aware of the formation prior to this time. He was in fact the son of a local farmer. He also informed me that if I followed his directions, a better view of that field would be available to me. \"This I did and within a couple of minutes was standing on the road opposite the formation which had a windmill on the horizon acting as a marker. However, despite the fact that the design was on sloping ground opposite me, it was not sloping enough to give me more than a tantalizing view of its composition. Even using binoculars, all I could make out was a series of dashes across the circle rather like perforations. I found that there was a road that ran across the top of the field, but this afforded no view at all. I should have been more audacious and ventured in, but the foot-and-mouth disease was still in full swing and I chickened out. (Police and farmers were patrolling fields, even with guns.) Subsequently because of the meditation, many people thought this formation was for me.\" We b s it e s : http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/column/review.html ( The Circular Review ) Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
