Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon More Orange Triangular Aircraft Over Red Deer, Alberta, Canada © 2002 by Linda Moulton Howe Red Deer and Lacombe are about 100 miles south of Edmonton, Alberta, a larger city which has also had several crop formations in its fields since the late 1990s. May 9, 2002 Red Deer, Alberta, Canada - Since the first week of September 2001, six nurse's aides at the Lacombe Nursing Home near Red Deer, Alberta, Canada have witnessed several flights of unidentified orange glowing triangular craft during their night shift breaks. For background, please see previous 09/22/01 and 10/27/01 Earthfiles reports that contain drawings of earlier sightings. This morning, I received another phone call from nurse's aide, Penny Pickett, about two more sightings. Interview Penny Pickett, Nurse's Aide, Lacombe Nursing Home, Lacombe, Alberta, (near Red Deer) Canada : \"On the early morning of May 8 about 2:30 a.m., another nurse who is new and I saw two of the orange triangles fly over during our cigarette break in the early morning. And then early this morning at 12:25 a.m., we saw them again for a longer period of time, maybe half a minute, and there were six triangles. The nurse with me hadn't seen any before and she said, 'Oh, my God, what are they? They are going way to fast to have any humans inside those ships. And they are so high up! I can't believe it. What are they?' So, we've seen eight of those triangles again since I called you April 20th about seeing fourteen in the sky all at once.\" Six Triangular Craft on Thursday, May 9, 2002 at 12:25 a.m. MDT, over Lacombe Nursing Home: "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"On May 9 at 12:25 a.m. MDT above the Lacombe Nursing Home near Red Deer, Alberta, Canada, nurse's aide Penny Pickett watched six large, orange glowing, triangular aerial craft move rapidly across the sky in about fifteen seconds.

Fourteen Triangular Craft A Few Minutes Later on April 20, 2002: A few minutes after the first four craft, fourteen more appeared in a formation"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"divided into three clusters of four large, orange glowing triangular aircraft and two which moved from the rear of the traveling formation to the front and slightly above the other twelve. Drawing © 2002 by Penny Pickett. Penny Pickett: \"I was outside about five minutes to 4 a.m. MST, and looked up and saw four triangles. They divided off into two going northwest and the other two going southwest. Another nurse's aide, Beth Steiss, sat down with me and I told her, 'I can't believe it. I've been thinking about these orange triangles every day for about a week now and I can't believe they just showed up again.' Beth said, 'I wish I could have seen them.' And I said, 'Oh, my God, you can. Turn around.' And there were fourteen of them and they were coming from the north going straight south. And they broke off into three groups of four and then all of a sudden there were two more there and kind of went above all the others. So, there were three groups of four (12) and two more came off and kind of above (2). But no sound and they were brighter than they have ever been. That same cantaloupe or pumpkin orange? Ye s . The other nurse's aide saw these, too, right? Yes, clearly, and she has never seen them before. She's only heard us talk about them. What was her reaction? Her mouth was just hanging down on to the ground. How high above you do you think the triangular craft were? Maybe a thousand feet at the most. If you extend your fist at an arm's length from you and look at how much of the area that your fist covers at an arm's length, were the craft smaller? The whole cluster? No, each one of those triangles would be how big in comparison to your fist? Each one of them would be at least two finger widths wide held out at arm's length. So, each triangular craft is two finger widths wide and there were fourteen in the sky above you. How much space do you think they covered? Two hand widths open wouldn't have covered all of them. Were they flying in a formation? They were all in one cluster to begin with and then they broke off into the three groups of four. And then two more came up and curled around kind of like birds to sometimes flying above the rest of them. But there was no sound at all. It freaked me out because I have seen them too many times! This is my fifth and sixth times this morning, 3:55 a.m. MST our time here. Did you try to call police or other authorities this time since there were fourteen? No, I called Linda (another nurse) to come out and see if she could any more because we had to go in and do rounds. And to call the police in Lacombe, you have to go through Red Deer and unless it's an emergency, you can't call 911 or you get fined. You get fined if you call 911?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"If it's not a life threatening emergency. And how do you know if these are life threatening or not, you know? So far they haven't been, but the triangles certainly are unexplained. They are definitely unexplained. And it scares me. When I saw them today, I felt like I was having a freaking heart attack because it scared me so bad. What were you scared of this time? I don't know. Normally, I'm calm when I see them. But today it scared me so bad I started crying. It just kind of freaked me. It seems like the last times we've seen them, something bad happened a few days later. Like we saw them around the 5th of September and then on September 11th was the bombing (terrorist air collisions with the World Trade Towers in New York City; the Pentagon in Washington, D. C.; and crash into Shanksville, Pennsylvania). That's what went through me this morning when I saw them. Kind of fear that something bad might happen again. Because especially just the way they seemed to break off into groups. It reminded you of something military? Yeah, and it's kind of scary. But yet, thrilling at the same time. Because it is so unexpected and unexplained. Yeah. And the numbers were so increased, to fourteen! Since this has happened so often since September 2001, could you nurses aides start taking a video camera to work to use on your breaks to try to capture the orange triangles on tape? We've all talked about it, but none of us have cameras like that. And we're not sure we would be able to get anything because they move so fast. You know the way an airplane moves across the sky? These triangles seem to travel ten or fifteen times faster. Like it takes only fifteen seconds for them to go clear across the sky from one end to the other. What sense did you have about the craft on May 9, 2002? It wasn't a fearful one because it's starting to become a common thing. Like Maureen (other nurse) said to me after we saw them, 'Why are they flying over here so often? Is it because no one can detect them here for some reason? Are they too far away from major airports or military installations so nobody catches them on a scanner or anything? Is it safer for them to go this way over Red Deer?' A satellite went over right after these went by. Wouldn't a satellite pick these up?\" More Information If anyone has any information about what the large, orange glowing, triangular aerial craft might be that have been seen by six nurses aides half a dozen times over Lacombe and Red Deer since September 2, 2001, please contact me: Linda Moulton Howe Reporter and Editor Earthfiles.com e-mail: earthfiles@earthfiles.com Fax: 215-491-9842"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
