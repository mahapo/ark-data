W ingless, dragonfly aerial craft seen at 10:15 AM, Monday, March 31, 2008, in Scotts Valley, California, flying overhead, long tail leading rounded body in flight. Sketch © 2008 by Cam for Earthfiles.com. April 4, 2008 Scotts Valley, California - A video has been circulating on the internet for months as “Kaptive” - a CGI rock video manipulation of the dragonfly aerial drone photographs that first emerged in May to June 2007. Not only is it a manipulation of the photographs, the CGI operator named Kris Avery took my Earthfiles podcast news reports about the dragonfly drone phenomenon and edited in my voice and voices of people I’ve interviewed without asking permission. Now he has sent a letter to io9.com explaining his manipulation of the photographs and states that since making his video, “I have been accused of being the originator of the whole drone saga, and the photos were in fact just a viral campaign to promote the eventual video. This is definitely NOT the truth.” [ See whole letter in More Information below.] What is the truth is that a dozen people came forward to me to describe dragonfly body-shaped aerial craft each had seen. Their reports span a time line of twenty years from 1987 up to mid-November 2007, including California, Louisiana, Arizona, Alabama, Arkansas and Oklahoma locations. Now, another dragonfly aerial craft eyewitness has emerged – a sighting as recently as Monday, March 31, 2008. The two private investigators, who were hired by an international group to track down dragonfly drone eyewitnesses in the United States, talked with me on Tuesday evening, April 1. Tom Davis is the owner of TK Davis Investigations in California after retiring from police detective work. Tom hired another retired police detective, Frank Dixon, to join him on the TK Davis Investigations of the mysterious dragonfly drones. F rank Dixon, left, and T.K.

On the map, Capitola is the bottom pink circle where eyewitness “Rajman” allegedly photographed the dragonfly drone above power lines on May 16, 2007. B etween Saratoga and Big Basin Redwoods State Park, on June 5, 2007, eyewitness “Stephen” photographed a dragonfly drone. The same date, Ty B. was bicycling with others in the Big Basin Redwoods State Park when the same type of dragonfly drone flickered in and out of sight - three times. The third time it slowly rotated above the bicyclers and Ty B. took twelve photographs. Earlier on May 16, 2007, Rajman saw a dragonfly drone above a power pole in Capitola and took six photographs. In Scotts Valley, northwest of Capitola, on March 31, 2008, at 10:15 AM, Cam saw a wingless, dragonfly body moving high in the sky. Tom asked Cam if she would talk with me in a taped interview for Earthfiles and Dreamland internet radio and she agreed. Her sighting was at 10:15 AM on Monday, March 31, 2008, when she was working in her kitchen while her boyfriend, Geoff, was doing yard work outside. Interview: Cam, Scotts Valley, California: “I was getting breakfast ready. I have a pan rack that hangs from my kitchen ceiling. Up above my pan rack are two, big skylights. I was in the process of getting ready to reach up and grab a pan from the rack when all of a sudden I caught some movement up in the skylight. We live right under a flight path. We have a lot of airlines that go over and at first I thought that might have been what it was. But it looked a little smaller than a commercial plane like the 747s or whatever. I know they are up around 30,000 to 40,000 feet, I think. This thing was lower than that and I thought maybe it was a military jet. Then all of a sudden I started realizing, ‘Wait a minute! There are no wings, no sound, and we had the windows open and the door was open. We should have been able to hear something because you can hear planes in the kitchen. And then I realized that it had this huge, long nose on the front of it. So, it was a really long nose and the body had a round shape. I saw a little bit of what I thought could have been a tail, another round shape. But I had my hands up trying to figure out how long this thing was. If you held your hand straight up against a jet commercial plane – that’s a couple of inches. This thing was maybe an inch and a quarter. So, it was really high up there. It was hard to tell how long it was because I didn’t have a whole lot of reference. Later, I saw pictures (of 2007 dragonfly drones) that showed spiky appendages coming off of it (ring). I didn’t see that, but I’m thinking it’s because it was so high that I couldn’t see that. But as soon as I saw all this, I went running out the front door to yell to my boyfriend, Geoff, to look up in the sky really fast because there was this thing in the sky. But by the time I got outside, it still should have been there like planes are, but it was gone. It was just gone! I don’t know where it went. But the path it was taking – we still should have been able to see it by the time I went outside because it was not going a tremendously fast speed. We should have been able to see it somewhere in the sky. But by the time I got to the front door, it was just gone. And it was so odd that there was absolutely no sound at all. Geoff had been working outside and he had no reason to look up because there was no noise."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"DID YOU SEE A RING AND SEE THE SKY THROUGH THE RING? That’s hard for me to decide. What I saw, it was so high up that I’m not positive if there really was a ring that I could definitely see on that or not. To me, it seemed like a stainless steel color. It did not seem super shiny. But again, it was so high and the angle I was seeing at was kind of underneath it. But since it was heading away from me, it was at an angle where I couldn’t really get a good look at exactly the bottom of it and I sure could not see the top of it. It could have had a ring in it because it could have been a little bit lighter in the middle (of round part). But I couldn’t tell if I could see sky through it because it was moving. Right After Sighting, Cam Sketched Wingless, Dragonfly Aerial Craft I did a quick sketch as soon as I came back into the house because I didn’t want to forget what I saw. So I ran back in the house and drew what I saw on just the closest piece of paper I could find, which happened to be a brochure for a plant I had ordered. So, I just took an ink pen and sketched out really quickly what I had seen. THAT’S THE PAD THAT SAYS ‘LILIES’ ON IT? That’s right. “L ilies” flower brochure on which Cam sketched the wingless, dragonfly body right after she saw it through her kitchen skylight around 10:15 AM, Monday, March 31, 2008, in Scotts Valley, California. Sketch provided to Earthfiles.com by Tom Davis, TK Investigations. Didn't Look Or Move Like A Helicopter WHY DID YOU THINK IT WAS NOT A HELICOPTER? The main thing is that I’ve never seen a helicopter that had a huge, long point on it like this thing did. It was really, really long. The point of it was longer than the body was and the body was more of a round shape. It kind of came out a little on the sides (of body). [SEE: Birmingham, Alabama 2006 photograph below, which Cam picked out"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"as body shape closest to what she saw through her kitchen skylight.] So, I don’t know if it was perfectly round or had little triangular edges on the side of it. Then the back, the way it looked. But there was no way that was a helicopter! You would have heard a helicopter. It didn’t move like a helicopter at all and there was no sound. A helicopter has a really distinctive look and they don’t have that big point coming off the front. And it didn’t have wings. It wasn’t like any kind of shaped object that I’ve ever seen. And to not have any noise. We can hear plane sounds here, you can here helicopters, and they go over a lot. With our being in a flight pattern, you hear planes and you hear personal planes like Cessnas. You hear them all the time. With the windows open, there should have been sound if it were a helicopter. And there was nothing. Scotts Valley Dragonfly Craft Moved Tail First IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT WHAT YOU SAW IN THE SKY WITH YOUR OWN EYES HAD THE SHAPE OF A DRAGONFLY? Yeah, except with no wings. But it did kind of have that shape with the long point in the front. And I did some checking on the internet to see if anybody had seen anything like I saw and I have heard that they go the other direction (ring ahead of long tail). But the one I saw, the point of it was the direction it was going. So, mine would be headed tail first, I guess. Others have considered that long part to be the tail of it, but to me it was the front because I haven’t seen these before (or the photos before) and so what I was seeing was the long pointed end was the part that was headed forward. Cam Reported Sighting to Tom Davis THAT WAS MONDAY, MARCH 31. HOW DID YOU COME TO TALK WITH TOM DAVIS WHO HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING THE DRAGONFLY DRONES? This is a real interesting story. My boyfriend, Geoff, knew about the Capitola sighting we had up here. He had been checking out all this stuff on his own and had emailed him (Tom Davis) about some thoughts on it. Geoff did show me a picture of the Capitola photo that was over a telephone pole. I thought it was probably nothing, so I dismissed it and wasn’t paying much attention to it. But Geoff still was, though. When I happened to see this thing in the sky, I’m like, ‘Oh, my gosh, that looks kind of like what he’s talking about.’ I didn’t see a lot of the bottom hanging down or the stuff on top like the one photo, but it sure had that long pointy tip on it and I’ve never seen anything else like that. But it really happened and the more I thought about it, I thought, ‘Well, these guys are investigators and they are retired sheriffs, so if he wanted to hook me up to a lie detector test, I had absolutely no problem because I honestly saw this. So I said (to Geoff), ‘You can go ahead and call him and email him and tell him that I would be willing to do the lie detector test so he would know I was telling the truth.' So, that’s why I was OK with Geoff contacting Tom because I knew I could prove it. Air Traffic After Dragonfly Craft Disappeared What’s really interesting is that about five minutes after this thing headed north from where I am, a little Cessna headed south that was about 1500 or 2,000 feet. [Cam thought the dragonfly object was higher, maybe even as high as 10,000 feet.] YOU COULD HEAR THE CESSNA, RIGHT? Oh, definitely! I could see and hear it (Cessna) and it made me realize how high that other must have been. Then a little past that, a plane came south that looked like a military. Geoff thought it was a military plane because of the number of engines on it and it had that white trail that comes out the back of it. I was really curious if anybody saw this on radar because those two planes came from the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"other direction not too long afterwards. DID GEOFF HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE MILITARY PLANE SHOWED UP BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE OF THE DRAGONFLY? He didn’t know. He just thought it was a coincidence that all of a sudden here was this big military plane, up high enough that it had the white trail coming off the back of it, and we don’t see those that often up here.” Cam Sketch, April 2, 2008 “W inged” Body Like May 2006, Birmingham, Alabama? Cam made another drawing of the dragonfly aerial body for Earthfiles.com on April 2, 2008. C am of Scotts Valley, California, made this second sketch on April 2, 2008, of the wingless, dragonfly aerial craft she saw at 10:15 AM on Monday, March 31, 2008. The aerial craft moved tail first in the sky. “It seemed like a stainless steel color. It did not seem super shiny.” Sketch © 2008 by Cam for Earthfiles.com. What intrigues me is that when I asked Cam to look at all the 2006 and 2007 dragonfly photos and pick the one shape (not size) closest to her own sighting, she picked May 2006, in Birmingham, Alabama. That aerial dragonfly craft was also above a power pole and photographed by a military subcontractor. The reason for this selection, Cam explained, are the triangular “wings” that protrude from the sides of the ring body. She thought the round body of her Scotts Valley sighting had protrusions to the sides as well. Further, the segmented tail in the Birmingham May 2006 photograph reminded her of the segments in the much longer tail of the craft she saw."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"O dd, aerial object above power poles near construction site in May 2006, in Birmingham, Alabama. Photo by John Smith, military subcontractor. W hen you look at a map of the locations where people have seen or photographed the dragonfly aerial drone in California, it's from Big Basins Redwood State Park and Saratoga to Scotts Valley and Capitola and then going east to Yosemite National Park and Sequoia National Park. Private investigators, Tom Davis and Frank Dixon, also think that the May 2007 dragonfly drone photographs by the man who called himself “Chad” were taken not in the Bakersfield region, but up closer to the Capitola area. Directly to the east of the parks is the China Lake Naval Weapons Reserve. Further south near the Northridge Mall, a suburb of Los Angeles, another eyewitness on May 17, 2006, at 10 PM, saw a green, glowing aerial object shaped “like a horseshoe crab with a long tail.” China Lake Naval Weapons Center"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"U pper left red dot marks Sequoia National Park and Forest where Shirley P. and her father saw the dragonfly drone twice in May 2005.

More Information: Kris Avery's Letter to io9.com : “ The videos I created, which eventually culminated into the music video for 'Drone' the musician are all inspired by the original photos. I myself am totally unsure as to the origin of the images beyond what I already known.. i.e., anonymous witnesses. Since then, I have been accused of being the originator of the whole drone saga, and the photos were in fact just a viral campaign to promote the eventual video. This is definitely NOT the truth. In a way, I wish it had been, because that would make me some kind of viral genius, and I'd be in completely the wrong job lol. I was involved in the discussions on OMF, Alien casebook, and other places for months, and the whole thing just reached a real frustrating deadlock between the believers and the non-believers ... or real/hoax argument. I'd made my point until I was blue in the face, and was met by people telling me that the CG I had created was nowhere near as good as what was being shown in the photos. So I knuckled down and set out to create a video and images that would shut them up. So really, it is the very people who refused to believe CG was capable of creating the images that pushed me on. It is bizarre really. I'm not sure what people think I am, but honestly, I am just a normal guy who does 3D graphics for a living. I pay my b ills, have a girlfriend, a dog, and am currently looking at doing a bit of decorating around the house. ” F or further information about the dragonfly-shaped aerial craft phenomenon, please see related Earthfiles reports below in the Earthfiles Archive : • 03/21/2008 — Part 2, Dragonfly-Shaped Aerial Craft: Current Media Misinformation Versus Eyewitnesses 1987 to 2007 • 03/09/2008 — Viewer Comments About Drone Mystery and Homeland Security Ban?
