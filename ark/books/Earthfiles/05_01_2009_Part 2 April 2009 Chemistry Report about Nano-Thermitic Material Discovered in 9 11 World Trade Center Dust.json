R eturn to Part 1 May 1, 2009 Spring City, Utah - The third listed author on the April 2009 Bentham Open Chemical Physics Journal paper is Steven E. Jones, Ph.D., Prof. Emeritus of Physics from Brigham Young University and now a private citizen who has long been investigating what exactly happened to bring the two World Trade Center towers and Building 7 straight down and so quickly. Prof. Jones received his Ph.D. in Physics from Stanford University in 1978. After that, he did post-doctoral research at the Los Alamos Meson Physics facility in New Mexico and the Idaho National Engineering Lab in Idaho Falls. In 1985, Prof. Jones joined the faculty in the Dept. of Physics and Astronomy at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. He was asked to take early retirement in 2007 from the university and thinks it’s because his 9/11 research is so controversial. Interview: Steven E. Jones, Ph.D., Prof. Emeritus of Physics, Brigham Young University, and now private citizen investigating 9/11, Spring City, Utah: “There was explosive material in the World Trade Center towers – we need to find out who did this and why were we told that it was jet fires that brought these buildings down when we find explosive material? The other question, of course, for NIST – National Institute for Standards and Technology – the question to them is: why did they refuse to look for explosives in the residue, the dust of the World Trade Center? They refused, and have consistently refused, our pleas to look for residues of explosive materials in the dust. WHAT ARE THE REASONS THAT NIST GIVES FOR REFUSING? The reasons are quoted in a paper about a year ago now in April 2008. And in that paper, we quote NIST and its spokesman, Mr. Michael Newman. He said, ‘Well, why would you look if you know it’s not there?’ WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR NIST? It’s part of the Dept. of Commerce. It’s a federally funded laboratory. NIST received a "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"charge from the U. S. Congress to determine why and how the World Trade Center towers fell and World Trade Center Building 7. NIST received that charge from Congress and funding. Over $20 million has been spent. Then NIST comes up with this lame excuse for not looking for explosive materials. That’s part of the question, right? How and why did the towers come down and Building 7? Well, NIST refused to look for explosives and we’ve published now considerable evidence. Perhaps they will finally look for explosive material. But you know, beyond that, the public I think should be concerned – perhaps even outraged that there is explosive material in the World Trade Center dust and NIST has refused to look for it. We’ve requested this and they have just not replied, except that they won’t look.” Effort to Have NIST Comment On Thermite Research in Bentham Journal In the week of April 20 to 24, I repeatedly phoned and emailed the World Trade Center Investigation Team offices at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, known as NIST. NIST’s Director of Buildings and Fire Research Lab is Shyam (pronounced Shaum) Sunder, who is also the lead investigator of the NIST inquiry into the 9/11 World Trade Center catastrophe. My first indication that people in that NIST office don’t want to talk to reporters was when I simply asked a secretary answering a phone how many people were employed in the World Trade Center Investigation Team. She immediately hung up on me. Later, I was told that 30 people now work for Mr. Sunder, after I received a call back from Michael Newman, public information officer in NIST’s Public and Business Affairs office in Gaithersburg, Maryland. I told Mr. Newman I had a copy of an April 2009 Open Chemical Physics Journal paper entitled “Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe” and wanted NIST’s perspective on the nanotechnology-produced thermite evidence presented. To my surprise, Mr. Newman said. “Oh, we have just received a copy of this ourselves and don’t want to comment.” I said the journal paper provided photomicrographic and other evidence of explosive material in the WTC dust, so it seemed important to discuss the findings with NIST who was charged by Congress to find out how and why the towers and Building 7 collapsed straight down. Mr. Newman said, “We don’t want to give time and attention to these alternative theories.” I asked if I could interview his boss, Shyam Sunder. Mr. Newman said he thought Mr. Sunder was traveling and would not be available for an interview. So, I asked Mr. Newman, as a public affairs representative for NIST, if he would provide an interview. He said he did not want to talk either. I said in fairness, I needed some on-the-record comment from NIST about the nanothermite evidence. Mr. Newman’s answer was in email the next day. He sent me three NIST public Q & A papers dated August 28, 2006, December 14, 2007, and one updated on April 21, 2009 – last week - the same time I started contacting NIST for an interview. [ See Websites below.] In its 2006 question and answer paper, NIST repeated questions sent by the public: Q: “ Did the NIST investigation look for evidence of the WTC towers being brought down by controlled demolition? Was the steel tested for explosives or thermite residues? The combination of thermite and sulfur (called thermate) “slices through steel like a hot knife through butter?” A: “NIST did not test for the residue of these compounds in the steel.” Previous NIST research is referenced and the Q & A paper states, “...NIST concluded that there were no explosives or controlled demolition involved in the collapses of the WTC towers.” The next paragraph is about NIST’s estimate that “many thousands of pounds of thermite would need to have been placed inconspicuously ahead of time, remotely ignited, and somehow held in direct contact with the surface of hundreds of massive structural components to weaken the building. This makes thermite an unlikely substance for achieving a controlled demolition.” But no comment about nanotechnology -produced thermitic material. The April 2009"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"published research shows many photomicrographs of thermitic material in the millimeter and smaller range containing ingredients that the chemists and physicists concluded at the end of their paper, “is active, unreacted thermitic material, incorporating nanotechnology, and is a highly energetic pyrotechnic or explosive material.” In NIST’s updated April 21, 2009, fact sheet, it states: Q: “Is it possible that thermite or thermate contributed to the collapse of WTC7? A: “NIST has looked at the application and use of thermite and has determined that its use to sever columns in WTC7 on 9/11/01 was unlikely.” So there has been a slight change between August 2006 and April 2009 from “there were no explosives or controlled demolition” to the less dogmatic, “ unlikely.” Any Official Feedback to Nano-Thermitic Research in Bentham Journal? DR. JONES, HAVE YOU RECEIVED ANY QUESTION OR COMMENT FROM ANYONE IN THE AMERICAN CONGRESS OR ANY COMMENT FROM NIST? No comment from NIST as yet. I have not heard since the (April 2009 Bentham Journal) publication from anyone in Congress. However, shortly before publication, I spoke to my Congressman, the honorable Jason Chaffetz (R-3rd District, Utah), and requested to explain to him what we had found - the red-gray chips, these explosives in the World Trade Center dust. In November 2008, he did come to my office and I gave him some of the data. It had not yet been published. We spent a good hour going over the data and he told me after I finished that he wants an in-depth investigation, including the question of explosives on 9/11 must be undertaken. This, of course, is what we are saying in our paper that with the finding of unexploded reactive material in the World Trade Center dust, there needs to be a serious follow up - not just to confirm our results. That's been done (by two other science labs to date), but to find out who made this material and why it was in the World Trade Center? And why NIST has consistently refused to even look for explosive residue. Since NIST is charged by Congress to determine how and why the destruction of these buildings, the two towers and Building 7, then that needs to be pursued by Congress because they have not done their job. DR. JONES, WHAT DO YOU SAY TO YOUR FELLOW AMERICANS WHO ARE LISTENING AND SAYING, ‘MY GOD, THIS CANNOT BE TRUE?’ Well, unfortunately, it can be true because the science tells us there is this highly energetic, explosive material in the World Trade Center dust. That is just a fact. Now, what you do with that fact is the next problem. This nano-thermitic evidence can be ignored to our peril because something very nefarious happened on 9/11. The next step is to consider what does this mean if you care about people. I do care enough about people to say, ‘Well, we need to find out who put explosive material in the World Trade Center towers and why?’ And then we have a push for an investigation. That will take having viewers and listeners calling their Congress people to ask, ‘Have you seen these papers?’ We need to go the next step now and find out who made it and why? That's going to take some outrage.” Who Is Behind Bentham Science Publishers, Ltd.? The shocking and controversial content and implications of all this made me want to know who Bentham Science Publishers, Ltd., is that published the nano-thermitic research. That turned out to be another surprise. In 1994, a group of unnamed private investors registered Bentham Science Publishers, Ltd., in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, a federation of seven emirates, or states, on the Persian Gulf bordering Oman and Saudi Arabia. Bentham was named after Jeremy Bentham, an 18th Century British legal expert, who politically argued for separation of church and state, freedom of expression, equal rights for women and end to slavery. Over the past fifteen years, Bentham Science Publishers, Ltd., has sold online subscriptions to 90 science journals that include Current Medical Chemistry , Current Molecular Medicine, and Current Pharmaceutical Design. Then two years ago in 2007,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Bentham began releasing 235 Open Access journals online, one of which in the past year is Bentham Open Chemical Physics Journal. Oddly, Bentham's main editorial staff is in Karachi, Pakistan, with three other offices listed on its contact page: Sharjah, United Arab Emirates; Bussum, Holland; and Oak Park, Illinois. I was particularly interested in Bentham Science Publishers background because of another question: Why wouldn't The New York Times, Wa sh i n g t o n P o st , 60 Minutes, CNN and other investigative media be headlining a scientific discovery of explosive nanothermitic material in 9/11's World Trade Center dust? If the science data is not true, then that needs to be reality checked and reported. Are others in the media ignoring this journal because the chemistry research was published in Bentham and not the highly respected journals, Science or Nature? No American is comfortable with the implication that an act as horrific as the destruction of the World Trade Center buildings and nearly 3,000 people on September 11, 2001, was even more complicated than airliners hitting the tops of the two tall towers - and then seven hours later, the mysterious free fall collapse of World Trade Center Building 7 that was never hit by an airplane. If the United States under President Barack Obama is trying for a new, more honest transparency in government, shouldn’t the nanothermitic research presented by Professors Harrit, Jones and others be at least discussed and commented upon by our taxpayer- funded U. S. Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology? As of this date, I still have no other response from NIST beyond their Q & A papers that say NIST did not test for the residue of thermitic compounds in the WTC steel and that “NIST has looked at the application and use of thermite and has determined that its use to sever columns in WTC7 on 9/11/01 was unlikely.” R eturn to Part 1 More Information : F or further information about 9/11, please see Earthfiles Archived reports below: • 08/01/2008 — Part 1: Rise of Fourth Reich in America? • 11/20/2007 — Do Black Budget Tri llions Support A Secret American Space Program? • 10/06/2004 — Is NRC Making Terrorist Work Easier?
