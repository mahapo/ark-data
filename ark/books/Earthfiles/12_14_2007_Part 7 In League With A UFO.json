Return to Part 1 December 14, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - ***** Chapter 5 Alien Cover-Up Concern over the increase of the media frenzy and the public's persistence to know more about the “Alien cover-up” in the late 1970s forced the department to clamp down and make it virtually impossible for leaks to happen. Every document and report that was not essential to the committee was ordered destroyed. A new procedure was adopted for the documents that were kept. The chronological order of everything that happened, every event that took place, was coded and the time sequence scrambled. The committee was not allowed to keep records and documents for more than a week. It did not matter what they were working on or whether they felt it significant enough to carry a particular project into the next week. At the end "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"of each week every note, folder and all documentation was removed from the possession of the committee. The committee could request any information it required of past experiments and get access to them with no problem, but they could not keep their own files. Security was made tighter due to the changing times, specifically because of the new legislation that went into effect in the decade of the 1970s. The Freedom of Information Act, which was adopted in 1966 and was amended to allow more information to be accessed in 1974, primarily because of the Nixon Watergate scandal. Those who worked on the committee or under its jurisdiction were not allowed to bring “anything” to work with them. Nor were they allowed to leave with “anything,” not even a pencil. Everything they needed was provided to them. Personnel who were “independent” of the committee were the only ones allowed to remove and take office supplies and other miscellaneous items to the committee and their staff. The committee was not allowed to shred or destroy anything. Their trash was taken and incinerated by those same people. Everyone associated with the committee had to pass through a screening room before they could enter their assigned work area. They had to leave clothing and all personal belongings, wallets, purses in the locker rooms. They wore a special garb made of paper and it was collected from them whenever they left the building and burned. Everyone who left the building had to go through a body check. Their bodies were checked to make sure no one made notes or sketches on them. If someone was inclined to take information out of the facility, they needed to have a photographic memory. But for the nature of what they were studying, it was highly improbable that even that would work. As one scientist told a colleague, “Easier it would be to emerge from a tornado with a handful of sand than to grasp what was in our labs and still make any sense of it once we left the building.” It was difficult enough to communicate with colleagues about Alien items, let alone someone who had no idea what they were dealing with. For those reasons, many of them questioned the need for the strong security measures they had to endure. How could they possibly go out and prattle about the things they had discovered when they themselves do not believe what they have. When they go home after work, it is as if they come out of a dream state. The scientists are forbidden to discuss their work with their spouses and they don't. Not for fear they will be found out (they have no doubt that they would be), but the fear that their loved ones would think they were insane. Part of the contract they agreed to when they signed on for the job was that they would be kept under constant surveillance at work and at home. The surveillance technique was not unfamiliar to government personnel, especially those who were adept at working under high security clearances. One system used microwaves as a means of surveillance. The system worked by bouncing microwaves off a windowpane. The microwaves detected minute vibrations on the glass surface. Talking and noise will cause glass to vibrate. Most vibrations are so small, they cannot be detected by the naked eye. It does not matter how many conversations are going on at the same time or if there is other background noise. A computer synthesizes the vibrations and recreates any or all the conversations that take place. Conversations that take place in a crowded restaurant can be monitored using this system. Stored in a computer's memory bank are the voice prints of those in the program. With that information, the surveillance team can zero in on a particular member and listen in on his or her conversation. They also have plain clothes agents who keep watch over the scientists. In the weekly pep classes given by the committee to department heads, security is the main topic. At one of the meetings, a security officer from the CIA informed them that before the dropping of the atom bomb on Japan, there were less than a dozen individuals in the world who understood the principles required to build that kind of device. To this day, few understand how nuclear particles can be manipulated to make a powerful bomb. Yet, the knowledge was leaked out and in a short span of time, many countries around the world had nuclear capability. That same CIA agent told the committee, “It is foolish to think that America is"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"the only country to have an Alien spacecraft in its possession.” With that assumption in mind, it's plausible to believe that those countries who do have Alien “knowledge,” regardless of the extent of that knowledge, would not limit the resources expanded to acquire more of it. The fear that this information would fall into the hands of the general public was secondary. What the committee feared most was that a competing country would acquire that material. The general public was fed misinformation since the time the committee came into possession of the Alien craft. This was done to confuse the public and at the same time to make it more difficult for foreign agents to acquire reliable material. Much of the misinformation about UFOs was leaked out by an agency that worked closely with the committee. There was a bit of ambiguity in this area. At times, it seemed that those who controlled the direction of the committee members had given them specific instructions to withhold everything about the UFO phenomena from the public. They contradicted themselves when they gave orders to release certain information via the underground for the purpose of misinformation. Some of the information was truthful, but because of its bizarre nature, it was among the first to be denounced and rejected by the critics of the phenomena. The campaign to discredit the entire civilian UFO research groups is funded on a small budget. The incredibility of “ Beings” from outer sp ace alone allowed the campaign to literally perpetuate itself and required little effort by the committee. Power of the Intangibles Though there are thousands, and possibly millions, of people who believe without doubting the existence of extraterrestrials, there are billions who don't believe. Likewise, the vast majority of humanity does not believe in anything, especially if it can't be seen, tasted or touched. Tangible things are what life is all about to the vast majority of people. “Kooks who talk about Miracles, and the nuts who see Little Green Men with big eyes, should be locked up.” With prevailing public opinions such as these, the committee should not need to take many security measures. Security measures are primarily used to keep information from falling into the hands of agents from other governments - governments who not only believe in the strange and unexplainable, but who spend large sums of money gathering up as much of that “hokey-pokey” stuff as they can get their hands on! Nations and people who are caught up in the “tangible” things of the world do not stand a chance against the unseen power of fate. In the Old Testament, God gave his people something that their enemies could neither see, hear nor touch, but whatever it was, it was real enough to conquer many of their far superior enemies. So powerful was that invisible weapon that thousands of years later, historians are still mystified by it. Politics During the seventies, the committee became more determined in their search for answers. Not necessarily because of any demands from their superiors, but from a general feeling they had among themselves that they were on the brink of a major new discovery. There was no hard evidence for this. It was only a feeling they all shared. Still, the wolf was at their door. Vocal UFO groups persuaded a few in the major media to put pressure on certain congressmen to shed some light on the UFO cover-up conspiracy. Although some politicians pounded their fists and vowed to get to the bottom of the conspiracy, they did it only for show and to placate that element of their constituency. Most politicians know there is a limit to their inquiries and don't really expect to get factual answers on certain topics - UFOs being one of those off limits subjects. But they did manage to get the U. S. Air Force to release some files - albeit, insignificant dummy files that were created specifically for that dummy purpose. The politicians know, or should know, they are only getting “junk.” But, they don't care because it makes them look like at least they are trying to get to the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"truth. All democracies have their limits and the United States - with the best version of democracy in the world - will never reach the point where the common people have access to all that goes on in government. Full democracy could never work anyway. It would only invite the enemies of democracy to take it apart, one freedom at a time. Nevertheless, there is always a Firebrand Freshman from the House of Representatives or the Senate who will come along and try to kick the door down. But within a week or two, like all the rest who came before them, they emerge with the \"proverbial tail between their legs,\" no longer looking for a fight and gladly taking the crumb that was thrown to them. \"There are things in the real world that the general population need not know about. UFOs is one of them.\" That is a quote from a memo that was sent anonymously to one senator who tried and failed to get information about the UFO cover-up. In solicitude, the committee felt as if they possessed secrets and knowledge that they and humanity are not ready to accept. Many involved with the program, if they had to do it over again, would not. Unfortunately, leaving the program was impossible. The scientists knew too much. Ironically, if they were allowed to leave with no consequences, most would not. Leaving would not remove the knowledge of the Aliens from their minds. Living a normal life with the things they knew was not possible. Their only link to sanity was their ability to be around other people like themselves who were stuck in the same dilemma. Once a connection between the Aliens and human abductions was made, the committee was sure that it would be their \"Rosetta Stone\" (a stone inscribed with one message, but written in three different languages) that would unlock the secrets of human evolution. Although the scientists thought they were close to making that connection several times, the Aliens managed to elude them. The committee had given up chasing after UFOs and were hoping that they, the Aliens, would somehow guide them to their next stage of discovery. The scientists knew the Aliens were watching them (again, it was just a feeling). There were suspicions in the committee ranks that someone in \"their\" midst conspired with the Aliens, or perhaps was an Alien himself in human form. Ever since the chamber restored the damaged human body, the idea that Aliens could take human form was no longer Fantasy. It was possible that the Aliens were steering the committee to that conclusion. The committee pondered about whether the body they had in the Alien craft could be used by the Aliens as a vehicle. Perhaps it was a way for the Aliens to enter into our world unnoticed! The body was like a machine that was on idle. The engine was running, but no one was at the controls. It sat there waiting for something, or someone, to activate its circuits and put it into gear. It is known that people under hypnotic suggestion will do things they have no recollection of doing once they come out of the hypnotic state, which proves that it is possible to make the body “ perform,” even though it has no consciousness. That opens the door to the use of ESP (extra sensory perception) as a possible way of controlling someone. Could the Aliens control the body in that manner? Would the Aliens have to enter into the body? Or could the Aliens do it remotely? Or maybe the scientists could control the body with the help of psychics? These were questions the committee bounced around. Their first approach to study that theory was to see if the body would react to psychic thought waves. After several trials, one of the psychics working with the body was able to get it to move some of its fingers. Unfortunately, that wa the extent of the scientist's achievements. The committee gave up on that project after six months. The experiment did produce some negative consequences for the science team. A few weeks after they had stopped those experiments, two scientists who were working near the body reported that it came to life. According to the testimony of one of the scientists, “It got up and danced and in one instance, it turned around and looked right at me. Then it screamed a stream of profanity at me.” There was another incident where the body attacked one of the technicians who had taken it out of the craft for a short time during a different experiment. Those who were personally affected by the antics of the “body” have refused to enter the Alien craft. One skeptic on the committee attributed what"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"allegedly took place to fatigue by those who made those claims. He told the members that the incidents could be explained by the fact that the craft affects some people differently than it affects others. That did not explain the incident that supposedly took place outside the craft, but the committee member reviewing the matter did not believe that incident took place either. Other committee members were not convinced. They questioned why the body that had not moved for two years was now playing pranks on the two scientists. One on the committee belied the claims and tied them to the experiments that were performed by the psychics. He believed that the experiments somehow opened up an opportunity for “poltergeist” to enter the vacated brain of the body. “If psychics are able to have some limited success in penetrating and activating the brain, as wa shown by the moving fingers, then who is to say a ghost or some other spirit could not enter the body?” he asked. The committee was divided between those who believed in the possible existence of ghosts and those who thought it was ludicrous. (It is bizarre that anyone on the committee could be skeptical of the existence of “strange phenomena” after witnessing all that they had seen. Nonetheless, there were those in the committee who were not convinced.) The scientists all agreed that more testing would be done before they made any judgments. After a few weeks of observing the body in and out of the ship, the committee concluded that the body did, in fact, come under ghostly influences - but only when it was out of the incubator room. It was possible that the psychic research had little to do with triggering the ghostly shenanigans, as was previously thought. The researchers were able to move the body to any location by simply taking it by the hand and guiding it to the place they wanted it. When the body was left unattended for more than ten minutes at a time, it simply walked back to the incubator room by itself. If the researcher was not through with the experiments, all he needed to do was take the body by the hand and guide it back to where the experiment was taking place. The body was completely obedient. It was believed by the committee that the eerie yellow glow in the incubator room had something to do with shielding the body from unwanted spirits. After the incident with the ghosts, the scientists decided to leave the body in the incubator for several months. They thought if the poltergeists were indeed attracted by the psychic experiments “in the same way sharks are attracted to blood dropped into the ocean,” then removing the body from the area might solve the problem. It worked. There were no more strange behaviors from the body. Still, no one felt at east working around it again. All who came in contact with the body were aware that it was a vehicle that did facilitate the entry into this world (from who knows where?) “Evil things.” The body up until then was never named. It was always referred to as the “body.” But after those reports, it was called “Frankenstein.” C ontinued in Part 8 - Chapter 6: Biodegradable Alien Objects More Information: F or further reports about extraterrestrial biological entities and technologies, please see my books, An Alien Harvest and the 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities in the Earthfiles Shop.
