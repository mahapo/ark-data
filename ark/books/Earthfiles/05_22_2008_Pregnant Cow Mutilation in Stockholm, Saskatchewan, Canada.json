We found that quite strange.” - H eather Harris, Stockholm Farmer May 22, 2008 Stockholm, Saskatchewan, Canada - There has been yet another cattle mutilation in Saskatchewan, Canada, found on May 1, 2008. This time it’s a 2-year-old pregnant cow on a farm about 5 miles from Stockholm, a ranching community of about 500 residents not far from Esterhazy and the Manitoba border. Straight west is the large Saskatchewan city of Regina. T he red circle marks Stockholm near Esterhazy and the Manitoba, Canada, border east of Regina. In my past twenty-nine years of animal mutilation investigations, back in the fall of 1979 I listened to sheriffs and deputies in Colorado who did not want to talk on the record, but who told me, “We’re not dealing with predators or Satanic cults. We’re dealing with creatures from outer space.” For reasons unknown, the animal mutilators have favorite spots on Earth to which they keep returning to bloodlessly harvest ears, eyes, tongues, jaw flesh, genitals, vagina and rectal tissues. One region in Canada that has perhaps had the most reported animal mutilations, especially cattle, is the province of Saskatchewan. When I research my Earthfiles.com archives for unusual Saskatchewan animal deaths, there are many cases and interviews I have done with astonished and frustrated ranchers who want someone in authority to investigate and say on the record who the perpetrators of the eerie killings are. My first television documentary, A Strange Harvest, was broadcast about the animal "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"mutilation phenomenon on the CBS station in Denver, Colorado, on May 28, 1980. Soon afterward, I received a phone call from Lynn Lauber, then the Royal Canadian Mounted Police chief investigator of animal mutilations in the province of British Columbia. His office told the media back then that they were monitoring a Satanic cult named “O,” which the RCMP claimed was responsible for the animal mutilation mystery. But when Mr. Lauber talked to me directly by phone in June 1980, he told me that was only a cover story to keep the media and public from hasseling the RCMP. Privately he told me that he agreed with law enforcement in my documentary, which linked the global animal mutilations to “creatures from outer space.” And now comes another fresh cattle mutilation report from Saskatchewan. You can see the rancher’s clear photographs of the strange, bloodless tissue excisions from their 2-year-old pregnant cow below. I have placed this report in the Real X-Files section that is accessible only by subscription because many viewers over the years have asked me not to make animal mutilation reports openly available to public viewing because the images can be disturbing. Consider the fact that the police and RCMP did not even investigate. How is that possible unless law enforcement knows in such bloodless cases there is no one they can arrest because authorities have accepted that the perpetrators are not from this planet? Two more astonished and frustrated cattle raisers are Heather and Ed Harris, who moved onto their Stockholm, Saskatchewan farm thirteen years ago in 1995, and have been raising a herd of about 40 cows. The couple have been married for 33 years and supplement their income with Ed’s mechanic work and Heather’s cooking for a local restaurant. At 10:30 PM on Wednesday, April 30, 2008, Ed checked the herd and all were present and healthy. But the next day at noon, Thursday, May 1st, Heather found one of their pregnant 2-year-old cows laying in the pasture. Interview: Heather E. Harris, Cattle Farmer, Stockholm, Saskatchewan, Canada: “We had gone out to take some bales in for the cattle and I had walked over to turn off the electric fence and I noticed the animal was down. So, I went over there to see what the heck was going on and when I found her, her rectum was facing me and it was gone. The other parts were gone. Her ear was removed. Her eye had been removed (as well as) her tongue and parts of the top and bottom lips and the naval area and the milk bag. WAS THE UDDER REMOVED IN A CIRCLE, SQUARE OR AN OVAL? It looked more like an oval by the way she was lying. THE RECTAL AND VAGINAL AREA – WAS THE HOLE ONLY TAKING OUT RECTAL TISSUE OR DID IT INCLUDE THE VAGINA AS WELL? Both were taken. WAS THAT A CIRCULAR, FIRM HOLE? Yes. There was no blood, no signs of blood. 2 -year-old pregnant cow's head: left ear was cut off; left eyeball removed and a circle of flesh around the eye; upper and lower lips, jaw flesh excised and tongue removed. Images of bloodless excisions from pregnant cow on the Heather and Edward Harris farm"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"in Stockholm, Saskatchewan, Canada, on May 1, 2008, by Heather Harris. No Tracks Around Dead Cow, No Barking Dogs COULD YOU SEE ANY UNUSUAL TRACKS OF ANY KIND? Absolutely nothing. And our yard is quite secluded. If you drove past our place, you would not realize that we had cattle even. The one thing I found very strange is that I raise dogs out here. If you were to come out here, we would have a hard time talking out in the yard because of so much barking. And yet, that night there wasn’t any. We had the bedroom window open that night and there was no barking from our pit bull and basset hounds. We found that quite strange. No Other Animals Approached Dead Cow DID YOU NOTICE ANY PREDATORS AROUND? No. We kind of thought the body did deteriorate quite rapidly and no birds or coyotes came near it. IS THAT ABNORMAL IN YOUR AREA? It’s abnormal that my big yard dog was not over there (eating on the dead cow). Like, if we butchered an animal, he would always eat what he could get out of it. And he never went near this mutilated cow. NORMALLY, IF YOU HAVE A COW DIE, WOULD LARGER PREDATORS AND BIRDS IMMEDIATELY START WORKING ON THE CARCASS? Oh, yes. They do. We have quite a few coyotes in this area and they get on to dead stuff"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"right away. SO, RIGHT THERE, THE FACT THAT YOUR PREGNANT, MUTILATED COW WAS NOT EVEN ATTACKED BY COYOTES IN THOSE SEVERAL DAYS? Yes, that was pretty strange. Mystery of Pit Bull and Basset Hounds Not Barking in the Night HOW FAR WAS THE COW FROM YOUR HOUSE? Only about two blocks. THAT’S PRETTY CLOSE FOR DOGS TO HEAR. It is! My breeding dogs are kept in enclosures at night, except for the basset hounds. They were out that night and we have a pit bull as our yard dog. He does not miss anything. Everything needs to be in its proper place. If a cow gets out, he chases back in. He just rules the barnyard and around the house here. And the basset hounds were originally bred for hunting. They have such good noses on them. That’s why we could not understand why they were not barking. SO, THE BASSET HOUNDS AND PIT BULL DID NOT MAKE ANY SOUNDS OUTSIDE AT ALL. No, it was quiet. Our bedroom window was open and it was a quiet night. THAT’S ALMOST AS STRANGE AS THE EXCISIONS THAT THE DOGS WOULD HAVE REMAINED QUIET. Yes, in fact I even said to Ed one night, ‘Gee, I wonder if we were zapped into a frozen state while They did this? You know how you watch these TV shows and they have guns that make everything stand still and they do what they have to do and then zap you back into life. THEY WOULD HAVE ZAPPED THE DOGS AT THE SAME TIME. Yeah. Neighbor Saw Odd Aerial Lights Two Nights Later HAVE YOU ASKED ANY OF YOUR NEIGHBORS IF THEY HEARD ANYTHING UNUSUAL? No, I haven’t. There was one fellow that we were showing the pictures to and he was telling us that one night his wife had seen some strange lights in the sky. But that was after we found our dead cow on Thursday, May 1, 2008. She saw the lights on Saturday night, May 3. Apparently she does not sleep well at night and she noticed the lights and was going to wake him up to take a look. But the lights just disappeared before she could wake him. SO ONLY TWO NIGHTS LATER? Yeah. DID SHE DESCRIBE COLOR, SIZE, MOTION? I think she said there were three lights and the one in the middle was a different color – a blue or something. And the weird part is that with her telling us this, if you went down our highway here, they (neighbors) are about three miles off the highway and so are we. So, they would be pretty close to being straight south of us down in the valley. BUT SOUTH OF YOU SO FAR, NO ONE HAS REPORTED MORE STRANGE ANIMAL DEATHS? No. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"No Police or RCMP Investigation IN YOUR 13 YEARS OF RANCHING, HAD YOU EVER SEEN AN ANIMAL LIKE THIS BEFORE? No. WHAT WAS YOUR AND ED’S REACTION? Ed was coming up with the tractor and the bale and I was just dumbfounded. I went over and stopped him and said, ‘You don’t even want to go see that.’ And I came in right a way to phone the police. Ed went over to look and he was totally shocked, too. DID THE POLICE COME OUT? Nope. THEY DID NOT? No, we had taken pictures right away and that was Friday, May 2, and then on Sunday, May 4, the one officer came into the restaurant where I cook and I gave her my camera and told her to look at the last seven pictures on it. Then when I came home, I noticed that the RCMP station had been phoning here and I phoned back and the officer asked me if I would bring my camera in so they could copy the pictures and get a statement. Well, when I went on Monday, May 5, 2008, after work, he was not in and I’ve never heard anything back. When this first happened to us, we turned to the RCMP thinking we would get some answers there. One thing that scared us, too, is was any radiation used? And we’re sitting out here – we were asked not to remove the body until authorities had come. And that was Friday, May 2. Well, finally on Monday night, May 5, we just got it out of there because – I mean, the mutilated cow is there with the other cattle that have calves coming. That’s something the RCMP should be more on to. HAVE YOU ASKED THE POLICE AND THE RCMP WHY THEY HAVE NOT INVESTIGATED? No, I haven’t. The reporter in Esterhazy went and asked them and it was printed in the paper that the matter was being treated as public mischief and still under investigation. WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO POLICE AUTHORITIES SAYING THIS WAS ‘PUBLIC MISCHIEF’? I was quite disgusted with that. I felt they never came out, so how could they even come to that type of conclusion? SO NO ONE FROM THE RCMP OR POLICE EVEN WENT TO SEE THE ANIMAL? No, they did not. WHEN YOU AND YOUR NEIGHBORS AND OTHER RANCHERS IN THE COMMUNITY DISCUSSED THIS, WHAT IS EVERYONE’S SPECULATION ABOUT WHY THE POLICE AND RCMP WOULD NOT INVESTIGATE? No one has really said anything. Everybody is kind of busy here now trying to get crops in. The only person I did discuss it with was with one of the neighbors and she was quite disgusted, too, that they did not take this more seriously. It’s almost like they don't want to know. OR, THEY DON’T WANT TO INVESTIGATE WHAT THEY ALREADY KNOW THEY CAN’T ARREST ANYBODY BECAUSE NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN ARRESTED OR ARRAIGNED. OK. I don’t know, it’s left me a little nervous out here at night. DID THE VET COME OUT TO YOUR PASTURE? No, I took photos to the vet. I never thought to call her because the animal was dead. But I’m wishing now that I had called her. COULD YOU SUMMARIZE WHAT VETERINARIAN KATHLEEN FRANCIS SAID TO"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"YOU ABOUT THE PHOTOS OF THE ANIMAL THAT YOU SHOWED HER? She was shocked when I showed them to her. I don’t think she wanted to believe what she was seeing. She said she could not make any cuts like that. She didn’t think they had been made by a scalpel, even. She also found it odd that there was no blood showing. Kathleen thought it might be some instrument that cauterized as it went. Animal Mutilators from Outer Space ONE OF THE MYSTERIES HAS BEEN WHAT IS THE INSTRUMENT THAT DOES THE CUTTING ON THESE ANIMALS AROUND THE WORLD? Yes, that unique – makes me wonder if it’s from this world?! IT WAS SHERIFFS WHO STARTED TELLING ME WHEN I DID MY FIRST INVESTIGATIONS AS A REPORTER – IT WAS SHERIFFS WHO TOLD ME, ‘LINDA, WE’RE NOT DEALING WITH PREDATORS OR SATANIC CULTS. WE’RE DEALING WITH CREATURES FROM OUTER SPACE.’ Yeah. Well, I don’t rule that out because very few people even knew we had cattle. One neighbor down the road, we bought some bales after him last month (April) and he was shocked that we even had cattle out here. And I will always believe whatever it was did come from the sky. That’s my feeling because there were no signs of anything – no tracks or anything around. I don’t rule that sort of stuff out. My attitude is that we send other people to like the moon and stuff. So, anything is possible.” The Day After Roswell © 1998 by U. S. Army Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso L t. Col. Philip J. Corso on July 4, 1997, with Linda Moulton Howe at the Roswell, New Mexico, 50th Anniversary commemoration held at the Roswell AFB. Col. Corso's groundbreaking book, The Day After Roswell, was published at the same time. United States Army Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso wrote the groundbreaking book, The Day After Roswell, first published in July 1997 during the 50th Anniversary of the famous July 1947 crashes of strange, wedge-shaped craft in the deserts around Roswell, New Mexico. Lt. Col. Philip Corso served in World War II and was hand-picked by General Arthur Trudeau to work in the Pentagon specifically on the American government’s efforts to back-engineer technologies retrieved from recovered extraterrestrial craft. On Page 182 of his book, Col. Corso wrote: “Although the first public reports of cattle mutilations surfaced around 1967 in Colorado, at the White House and Pentagon we were reading about the mutilation stories that had been kept out of the press as far back as the 1950s. ... Our intelligence organizations believed that the cattle mutilations ... were the results of interventions by extraterrestrials who were harvesting specific organs for experimentation.”"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"On Pages 180-181 of his book, he wrote: “Local police reported that when veterinarians were called to the scene to examine the dead cattle left in fields, they often found evidence not just that the animal’s blood had been drained, but that entire organs were removed with surgical skill. ... Whatever device the extraterrestrial biological entities employed, it did not even cut through the surrounding tissue. ...It was as though some device had simply excised the organs with techniques that even went beyond our own surgical precision.” Col. Corso told me before he died in 1998 that he read highly classified documents about the worldwide animal mutilation phenomenon dated as early as 1951.
