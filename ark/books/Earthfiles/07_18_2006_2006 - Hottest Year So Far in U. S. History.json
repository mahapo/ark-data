History © 2006 by Linda Moulton Howe \" T he average temperature for the continental United States from January through June 2006 was the warmest first half of any year since records began in 1895.\" - NOAA J uly 17, 2006, temperature map for mainland United States. July 18, 2006 Asheville, North Carolina - The following is the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Agency's summary of America's \"record warm first half of year, widespread drought and northeast record rainfall.\" N OAA report on July 14, 2006: \"The average temperature for the continental United States from January through June 2006 was the warmest first half of any year since records began in 1895, according to scientists at the NOAA National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C. Last month was the second warmest June on record and nationally averaged precipitation was below average. The continuation of below normal precipitation in certain regions and much warmer-than-average temperatures expanded moderate-to-extreme drought conditions in the contiguous U.S. However, much of the Northeast experienced severe flooding and record rainfall during the last week of June. The global surface temperature was second warmest on record for June. U.S. Temperature Highlights The average January-June temperature for the contiguous United States (based on preliminary data) was 51.8 degrees F (11.0 degrees C), or 3.4 degrees F (1.8 degrees C) above the 20th century (1901-2000) average. Five states (Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska and Missouri) experienced record warmth for the period. No state was near or cooler than average. The nation observed the second warmest June on record this year. In the West, 11 states were much warmer than average. Only five states (Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and South Carolina) were cooler than normal for the month. The June statewide average temperature for Alaska was near average, and January-June was 0.55 degrees F (0.30 degrees C) cooler than the 1971-2000 average. U.S. Precipitation Highlights The average precipitation for June 2006 across the continental U.S. was 0.3 in. (8 mm) below the 20th century average. Record rainfall in parts of the Northeast during May and June contributed to the wetter- than-normal first half of the year for that region. Heavy precipitation along the East Coast from June 22-28 resulted in widespread flooding. For example, Washington’s Reagan National Airport reported 11.37 inches (289 mm) during that time and a record June total of 14.02 inches (356 mm). More than 10 inches (254 mm) of rain fell in Federalsburg on Maryland’s Eastern Shore in a 24-hour period. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"In June, 45 percent of the contiguous U.S. was in moderate-to-extreme drought (based on the Palmer Drought Index), an increase of 6 percent from May, while 27 percent was in severe- extreme drought (up from 20 percent in May). Additionally, from January through June, warm, dry conditions spawned more than 50,000 wildfires, burning more than 3,000,000 acres in the contiguous U.S. and Alaska, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Global Highlights It was the second warmest June on record for global land- and ocean-surface temperatures since records began in 1880 (1.08 degrees F/0.60 degrees C above the 20th century mean) and the sixth warmest year-to-date (January-June) (0.90 degrees F/0.50 degrees C). \" Eastern Gulf of Mexico Coast Temperatures C urrent water temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit near Pensacola, Florida are 90 degrees F; Naples, Florida = 87.6 F; and Key West, Florida = 84.9 degrees F.

NOAA's U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey was established in 1807 by Thomas Jefferson, followed by formation of the Weather Bureau and the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries in the 1870s. Through the emerging Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), NOAA is working with its federal partners and more than 60 countries to develop a global monitoring network of Earth.
