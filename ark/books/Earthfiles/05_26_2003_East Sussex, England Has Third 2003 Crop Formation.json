May 26, 2003 Woodingdean, East Sussex - Andy Thomas, Editor of Swirlednews.com, reports that the second formation to appear in East Sussex this month lies directly alongside the 'thought bubble' pattern reported May 14, 2003. The crop is oilseed rape after the early yellow blooms have given way to green in a field on Newmarket Hill near Woodingdean. Ringed circle with tail of five smaller circles. The diameter of the ring is 106 feet. The center circle's diameter is 53 feet. The five tail circles are 26.5 feet, 18 feet, 13 feet, 9 feet and 6.5 feet. Aerial photograph © 2003 by David Russell. Andy writes about the new S-shaped pattern, \"It is much larger than its predecessor and is comprised of a central 102-foot-diameter circle with four diminishing circles on each side (thus nine in all, forming an S-shape), both sides leading to long 200-foot paths which culminate in 25-foot-diameter circles. These paths are not unlike the design of last year's first Sompting (West Sussex) formation. This new glyph's size is highly impressive and it must rate as one of the largest Sussex formations we've yet had.\" The farmer confirmed the crop formation was not there on May 24, so it must have been created on the night of May 24-25. Yet, Andy Thomas reports, \"The night of its arrival was one of torrential rain between at least 12:30 a.m. and 1:00 a.m. - not nice conditions!\" Andy also reported about the May 14, 2003, ring and tail of circles, \"It is worth mentioning that on Tuesday afternoon (May 13), there was thunder, heavy rain and hail all afternoon and the field would have been very wet and muddy on the night of its appearance. Despite this, the stems of rape were clean and unscuffed.\" Andy also points out that the Newmarket Hill field is near a Neolithic track and that an ancient burial mound lies in the field below the ring "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"pattern. \"Crop formations have appeared in this area for many years, with a single circle having been reported in the same field as early as 1974.\" The two May 2003 formations in Woodingdean are not far from the first simple circle of the British 2003 crop formation season discovered by the farmer on or about April 12, 2003, at Cliffe Hill, Lewes, East Sussex. That circle was 56 feet in diameter, pictured below the map.
