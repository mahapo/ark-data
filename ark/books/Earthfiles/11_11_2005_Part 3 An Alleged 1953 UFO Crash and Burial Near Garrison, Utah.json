Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Part 3: An Alleged 1953 UFO Crash and Burial Near Garrison, Utah Â© 2005 by Linda Moulton Howe Return to Part 1 November 10, 2005 - Interviews: Steve Jones, Computer Systems Trainer, Dixon, California, driving toward DRES facility on July 16, 2005, with Earthfiles Reporter and Editor, Linda Moulton Howe: \"I think it's a safe house. And I'll tell you it has every sign of being that. It has all the accouterments. I mean, those kinds of directional antennas don't just show up in the middle of a little U. S. Forest Service Research Station, for God's sake! That's actually the beginning of a satellite uplink. AND THE FACT THAT AT 9/11 THIS PLACE CAME ALIVE? This place came alive after 9/11. Three or four days later, we were here down on the lakebed and this place was lit up like a Christmas tree! In every single building, the lights were on. Steve was surprised to find new solar panels, new doors, new locks, new antenna, big air vents, and other signs that the seemingly abandoned, deteriorating place hiding in plain sight. Steve Jones at solar panels: \"What we're looking at here is a brand new solar panel array that has been installed on this facility out in the middle of nowhere. Just to give you an idea of cost on this each one of these rectangles on these big panels here they are roughly 18 by 48 inches. Those are probably about $1500 a piece. So, in other words, each one of these bigger panels is approximately $50,000. So what you are looking at here is a little over $100,000 of solar panel array that is set up in the middle of this facility in the middle of nowhere. Why?\" Steve Jones on porch next to new door with new locks amid peeling paint: \"The aerial photographs were taken with the impact site over on this lake bed being the center of the aerial photographs. They took a grid pattern of aerial photographs on June 11, 1953, about 50 to 75 miles in every direction with this being the center, indicating to me they had a very keen interest on what's going on in this particular area. It intrigued me. I thought there has to be some connection between this place (DRES) and that impact (triangle). STEVE, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE STRONGEST EVIDENCE THERE MIGHT BE AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL VEHICLE BURIED UNDER THAT DRY LAKE? Again, the size of the impact. If you take a look at not only the aerial photographs that were taken I strongly believe these were taken by the U. S. Air Force because of what they look like. These photos were 24 inches x 24 inches, single shot aerial photographs on old photographic style paper and they were not cut and pasted together. I've seen aerial photographs before as early as the early 1960s and I know what they look like. I have personally seen the crash debris field of a B-52 which put down in Sacramento, California, in the 1980s. I know what an aircraft debris field looks like. This was not an aircraft. Whatever it was, was very large. What I suspect is that it had a shallow, round undercarriage to it and when it slid down this incline into the lake bed, it created havoc. It really just rained debris down field in a massive way. I've taken a look at the terra server images you can go on terra server to this day and take a look at this impact site. It has not substantially changed in over 50 years. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" L eft: July 20, 1997, United States Geological Survey TerraServer satellite image of the DRES lakebed triangle at (113W 40'29.83\" by 38N 37'). Right: High altitude aerial image of triangle feature in lake bed, June 11, 1953. Length of triangle feature is 4,400 by 2,700 feet wide. WHY IS IT TRIANGULAR? Why is it triangular? My feeling is that it was the shape of the craft that dictated the way and angle of impact, the way it hit the lakebed is what created that V-shaped pattern. And these were intelligence photographs, obviously from the way they were made up. That really impressed me and I thought, 'Why would they make this kind of effort to document and observe this particular area?' It's out in the middle of nowhere! We are sitting in a valley that is probably one of the most desolate parts of the United States. This valley is 110 miles long, 20 miles wide, and there are only two ranches around here. You would have to go 50 miles to see another human being. Out in the middle of this valley is this little village in which we are sitting that was set up originally back in 1933, built as a CCC project, and it became a Desert Research Experimental Station. But yet, based on the log book, we've got military intelligence people, for God's sake, coming to this place. Why? I mean, that asks some big questions. Talking to the locals, they know something is going on out here. I've actually interviewed a person in a little town about 30 miles from here who said he was awakened from a deep sleep when he was 12 years old, that would have placed it right around 1953, the middle of the night. The sky lit up, the ground shook for 15 minutes. It scared the heck out of his mother. She thought it was the end of the world. Something happened out here.\" Baker Resident Described Ni ght Time Crash In Early 1950s A lleged UFO eyewitness, Bart Wright, lived in Baker, Nevada, in 1953. I n 1953, a boy named Bart Wright was about 12-years-old, living with his large family of a dozen siblings on the outskirts of Baker, Nevada. Baker is a small community about 45 minutes by car from the Desert Research Experimental Station. In 2001, Rex Leonard was manager of The Outlaw Bar in Baker. He hired Bart Wright to be a bartender. Bart told Rex about a haunting memory he had from around 1953. Rex Leonard, former manager of The Outlaw Bar, Baker, Nevada, July 20, 2005: \"It was after dark and this thing came flying across the valley and landed on the other side of the mountain which would put it down near where Steve (Jones) was looking at the crash site."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"DID HE DESCRIBE ANYTHING ABOUT THE COLOR? I think he said it had a kind of pervasive blue color, like an electric light, you know? I do remember him talking about it as a little kid when he saw this thing. And the time the date, 1953, I think would coincide with the object Steve (Jones) is convinced landed, fell, hit or crashed out there in that dry lake on the other side of the mountain from where Bart was living then when he was growing up that he (Bart) saw it in the eyes of a 12-year-old. It was just a bright light and when it hit, the ground rumbled and as you say, he probably did run to his mother. It seems like he said there were people from the government came around to talk to people all over the valley after that.\" O ne of the fourth generation settlers in the town of Garrison nearest DRES is 90-year-old Ladd Davies. He told Rex Leonard that once \"long ago\" while Ladd was riding at sunup, he saw \"a UFO not more than a hundred yards away. It was making absolutely no sound and when it went by, the color was black as if light was being sucked into it. Ladd said it was like you could look into infinity looking inside of it.\" Geology Research With Ultrasound and Magnetometer in August 1999 Steve Jones wanted to know if he could find any evidence of a large buried object inside the lakebed triangle. So, in 1999, he and his colleague, Les Velez, hired Salt Lake City geologist Lamont Sorenson. Mr. Sorenson, through his company, LGS Geophysics, Inc., examined the aerial photographs of the peculiar triangle feature and studied two ends of the lakebed site with a magnetometer and ultrasound. Mr. Sorenson's report was entitled \"Results of Geophysical Investigations, Vicinity of Desert Range Experimental Station, Baker, Millard County, Utah.\" C over of August 1999 geology report about DRES triangle research by Lamont Sorenson (deceased spring 2005), LGS Geophysics, Inc., Salt Lake City, Utah. Mr. Sorenson could not find any anomalies in the end sections of the triangle that were searched for an underground anomaly, indicated in his diagram by the vertical straight lines. But he told Steve Jones that the triangle pattern, so vivid from the air and yet so difficult to detect on the ground, was \" not made by Nature.\" The triangle was not the result of natural events such as flooding or meteor impacts. The implication is that an artificial digging process might have taken place, perhaps to bury a large object that could not be transported?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"D iagram of 1999 lakebed ultrasound and magnetometer research in end portions of triangle which is 4,400 long and 2,700 feet wide. Diagram drawn by Lamont Sorenson for Steve Jones and Lester Ve l ez. Steve Jones, July 17, 2005, at the DRES facility, Utah: \"I have had a field geologist (Lamont Sorensen) come with us out here that had the EG&G ultrasound testing equipment. He was a petroleum geologist and he told me, 'This is not a natural occurring feature.' We showed him the aerial photographs. We took him out on site. He said, 'This is not a naturally occurring feature.' WHAT DID THE GEOLOGIST SAY ABOUT THE ARTIFICIALITY OF THE TRIANGULAR SHAPE? He told me that it's not something that was made by the weather, it's not something that was made by he's seen bolides and a bolide crater. Those type of craters make a different pattern. It's just that it was not made like if they had a flash flood come down the side of this valley and into the lake bed. It was not made that way. I have tried various methods we started out with the ultrasound. We have used field magnetometers on it. We have gone out and punched holes in the ground just to see how far down we could go before we hit solid hard pan or anything like that. It's a tough nut to crack. It really is. But my guess is that the best way to do it would be thermal infrared and an overflight to do an infrared of the area to see if there is anything buried out there that would show up. I mean, consider the logistics of the time, what they had to work with. If you have a craft, for example, that is made out of material like titanium and they did not have the plasma torches and that kind of technology to cut them up into pieces and haul them out. I mean, that's about the only option they have is to dig a big hole and leave it there. STEVE, ISN'T THE IMPLICATION THAT IF SOMETHING SO BIG CAME DOWN ON THAT DRY LAKEBED NEAR THE DRES, THAT IT HAD TO BE BURIED? THEY WOULD HAVE TO BRING IN SCIENTISTS HERE. THEY WOULD HAVE TO BRING IN THE CHEMISTS AND METALLURGISTS HERE BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT TAKE IT ANYWHERE ELSE? Correct. My feeling was that they had to either build a very large underground facility or have access to it in stealth to keep the local population from talking about it. The logistics are doable. The impact zone is only 3 miles away (from DRES) and here you have a facility that is perfectly suitable for doing something like that. The plant biologists that come out here don't come out that often. All the government has to do is shut off access for a little while, bring in a group of scientists and even if they built a tunnel down there to get access to where they buried it. Logistically, it would be beautiful because they could keep it secret and prevent I mean, you know that the Soviets were keeping an eye on us just as we were on them. Anything like this would have set off alarms especially thinking the way the military does about this. They would really have to keep it under wraps. This is perfect. You have a station that is set up as a scientific research station. You could bring in engineers, biologists and physicists and house them in this facility and no one would know the better. I mean, they would not know.\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" USAF Former C-141 Pi lot, October 7, 2005 Now I would like to share excerpts from a recent interview I did by phone on October 7, 2005, with a former USAF pilot who has asked for anonymity. He says he has firsthand knowledge from 1993 of an underground facility below the triangular pattern in the lakebed that was connected by a tunnel to the DRES buildings. He asserts that he also has firsthand knowledge of a thirty foot vertical by a hundred fifty-foot-long oval-shaped \"extraterrestrial vehicle\" which crashed in the lakebed and was buried in 1953, beneath the odd triangle ground pattern. According to the retired Air Force pilot, the craft was still underground at the DRES lakebed as recently as the mid-1990s. USAF former C-141 pilot: \"WHAT I UNDERSTAND FROM STEVE JONES IS THAT YOU WERE ON A RECOVERY TEAM? Well, in the Air Force which I'm not going to talk about were all kinds of things. I can't talk about it. They will shoot me. WERE THOSE THINGS RELATED TO THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITY PHENOMENON? You're making it hard. I can't talk about that stuff. They weren't from this world, let me put it that way. WHAT IS YOUR PERSONAL FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE DRY LAKE BED TRIANGLE THAT IS IN THE HIGH ALTITUDE PHOTOGRAPHS DATED JUNE 11, 1953? That's a crash that happened back in late 1952 or early 1953. I don't remember the exact date now, but it crashed there (DRES facility, Utah), and not in Kingman. They buried it there. DO YOU KNOW FOR A FACT THAT SOME SORT OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL VEHICLE WAS BURIED INSIDE OF THAT AREA THAT IS THE TRIANGULAR PATTERN NEAR THE DRES FACILITY? The ship was 150 feet in diameter. It was an oblong ship that was about 3 stories high. You can't pack that up on a car and drive it off. You can't helicopter it out and the metal they couldn't cut it up. So, they had to put it somewhere. WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF YOUR INFORMATION? (long pause) That ought to tell you. WHAT DID OUR GOVERNMENT DO? Start digging a big hole! HOW DID THEY DO THAT? With a lot of Army guys with shovels. I mean, they dug for days and days and days. It's pretty sandy out there, so it's pretty easy. Bulldozers and what not. BURYING SOMETHING THAT'S 3 STORIES HIGH AT LEAST 30 FEET HIGH BY ? 150 ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FEET IN DIAMETER. THAT'S PRETTY BIG. Half of it was already buried after it finally settled down. So, they had to dig the other half out. AND IT'S STILL BURIED IN OCTOBER 2005, AS FAR AS YOU KNOW? As far as I know, yeah. I haven't been there in a good ten years or so. It was there when I was there last. IS THE DRES FACILITY A HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT INTELLIGENCE OPERATION IN WHICH THERE ARE UNDERGROUND FACILITIES TO ACCESS THE BURIED CRAFT? It used to be. It's not active anymore. There used to be some underground walkways to the site and into the ship."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"YOU KNOW THAT FIRSTHAND? I walked into the ship myself. DO YOU KNOW WHICH TYPE OF ENTITY IT'S LINKED WITH? The Zeta Reticulan. THE GREY-SKINNED ONES WITH THE VERTICAL PUPIL, REPTILIAN EYES? The small grey, you can call them. They are not really reptilian eyes, but OK. Big round, black eyes. DO YOU HAVE ANY UNDERSTANDING WHY THE 1953 AERIAL THAT WAS TAKEN ON JUNE 11, 1953, SHOWS A LARGE TRIANGULAR, UNNATURAL PATTERN? WHY A TRIANGLE? Who knows. Those people did all kinds of weird things. IN OTHER WORDS, THE DIGGING AND THE BURYING LEAVING THAT TRIANGULAR PATTERN MIGHT HAVE BEEN FOR SOME REASON? Probably some aerial reasons for the other ships to come in and land, most likely, would be my guess.\" C ontinued in Part 4 - Remote viewing of DRES by Joe McMoneagle, Intuitive Intelligence Applications, Inc.
