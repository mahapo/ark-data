Out of print. Return to Part 1 November 25, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Alien Medical Instruments One Alien object described on one of the reports discovered during the Korean War was a rectangular device with smooth, rounded edges. [ Editor's Note: Korean War hostilities occurred from June 27, 1950, to July 27, 1953. However, the war period was extended to January 31, 1955, by Congress to define a period of benefit eligibility in the wake of uneasy peace negotiations after July 27, 1953.] It was 1 inch wide by 2 inches long and was 1/2 inch thick. The color was sapphire and so smooth it was slippery and extremely difficult to hold on to. It was also very beautiful. It looked like a large precious stone and definitely rivaled anything that could be bought at the most prestigious jewelry boutiques on New York's Fifth Avenue. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"When this item was placed on a living body, it detected tumors, both malignant and benign. Once the tumor was detected, the Alien object projected an image of the tumor on its screen-like surface. The projected image was so clear that it was like looking at the tumor itself. The object glided over the skin of the body without making contact. If tumors did not reside in the body, the object remained stationary and a cryptic message appeared on its surface. The object did not need to scan over the entire body to locate a tumor. The Alien device knew instantly where the tumor or tumors were as soon as the object touched the skin. If a tumor was detected, it levitated and moved to the tumor. When more than one tumor was present in the body, the alien device identified the one it was close to and then moved on to the next closest one and presumably catalogued it, too. Size of the tumor had no bearing on the order that it would be identified. The scientists believed that the scanner was mapping the location of each tumor and all pertinent information about the tumor and storing that information somewhere. But they never discovered how or where the information was stored, whether it was stored within the object itself or if it transmitted the information back to the Alien craft. Every tumor that was displayed on the surface of that object was accompanied by Alien symbols, presumably identifying what type of tumor it was and where on the body it was located. Another object on the report was something that looked like a cheese cutter. It had a 4-inch long tubular handle and a flat area like that of a spatula with a slit in the middle of it. The object was molded from the same stuff as the other item, but its color was ruby red. The flat part of the item was less than 1-inch-wide, the length was 1.5 inches and the thickness was less than that of a double-edged razor blade. That Alien device effortlessly removed skin from one part of the body and miraculously grafted it to another part of the body. No sutures are required to hold the skin in place. As soon as the skin is applied, the wound completely healed itself in less than five minutes. The instrument accelerated the healing process at the injury site as it fused the grafted skin to the wound. The condition of the person receiving the skin did not affect the healing process of the grafted area, even if there were lesions or other wounds that did not heal due to some underlying illness such as cancer or diabetes. The scientists were able to graft skin from one person on to another with the same rate of success. Skin color likewise did not matter. Skin from Blacks, Caucasians and Asians were all intermingled with the same astonishing results. The receiving body never rejected the grafted skin. The skin from the donor assumes the color and matrix of that of the recipient at the same rate that it healed. What is brilliant about all these medical devices was that any lay person could use them. The instruments are \"fail proof.\" Their respective functions never wavered in performance, regardless of who wielded them. The devices did the job to perfection every time. Yet, accidents did happen like the scientist who lost his eye. These were caused by not knowing the function of a device. Once the function was known, no other skill is required. Many of the mistakes and injuries that occurred early in the program were actually due to the expertise of the doctors and scientists, not the lack of it. Many times, the doctors tried to assist or force the instruments to perform in ways they thought they should perform. Often, there were fatal consequences. There are markings on some of the instruments, but probably the markings had no more significance than the markings on our own earthly tools and utensils. We don't need written instructions on our knives and forks, screwdrivers and hammers. The culture we live in teaches us what we need to know without having to be redundant. One of the most bizarre instruments discovered by the team was a triangular- shaped object about the size of a quarter (25-cent coin). When the item was placed on a person's head, it instantly embedded itself in the skull, rendered the person unconscious, then lifted that person up head first and vanished with the body. At first, those performing the experiment assumed that the body was transported back to the ship. This was before the advent of \"Star Trek,\" so none of them were familiar with the famous words, \"Beam me up, Scotty.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"This experiment was one that was done in Korea. The Alien craft was kept in Japan, so they flew back to Japan from Korea to see if the person was in the Alien ship. The scientists presumed that like all the other Alien objects connected with the ship that maybe the person (if he were still alive) and the object that attached to him would be found back on board the ship. But the body was not. However, three days later, the triangular device was back on the craft. The person or his body was never found. The prevailing theory of what might have happened to him was that he was transported to some other Alien ship in Earth's orbit or possibly to the interior of our planet, where it was suspected by one of the psychics that the Aliens had an outpost. A second psychic stated that the body or person was carried into the sun to be destroyed, for reasons he could not understand or explain to the committee members. Like al the experiments that have been carried out using the Alien objects, the triangular instrument only worked on live humans. One other theory that came from the research team who studied that last triangular medical device was that the soul of a human had something to do with the activation of that Alien instrument. This theory was supported by another team when they had discovered in the course of their experiments that all who lost brain activity during an experiment, also lost the function of the Alien instrument that was performing a procedure on a person. Even when the man was kept alive artificially or on his own, the lack of brain waves rendered the devices useless. In every situation, the Alien devices stopped working the moment the brain waves stopped. It appeared that the Aliens had jurisdiction over humans only when there was life involved. ***** Chapter 4 What are the Aliens up to? It was painfully obvious to the committee that the Aliens are capable of doing whatever they desired to do. So, what are the Aliens up to? Some of the questions that were tossed around by committee members were: - \"How many Aliens are on Earth? Dozens? Hundreds? Thousands?\" - \"Did the Aliens want humans to participate by letting us have one of their aerial vehicles full of supernatural instruments?\" - \"Why are the Aliens being so secretive and not making some kind of formal contact with Earthlings?\" - \"Did the Aliens stage the Alien shipwreck?\" - \"Was is a means of introducing their infinitely superior race to our own fragile one?\" - \"Is this a way for the Aliens to let us know that we humans could not survive a full frontal encounter with them?\" - \"Or, are they sowing the seeds of our destruction?\" If the U. S. government is keeping the Alien project under tight raps, are there other similar Alien projects going on simultaneously? If so, how many? As fragments of the puzzle came together, the committee inferred from the Alien gadgets that the Aliens had a definite interest in the human anatomy. Since many of the instruments had beneficial features to them, were the Aliens a kind of behind-the-scenes paramedic unit? If so, why are they selective? Thousands of people die every day of accidents and diseases that could easily be treated with the Alien gadgets that the scientists had. For a period of a few months, the committee switched gears and spent more time brainstorming about what was the purpose of the intruders and focused less on the instrument themselves. The scientists enlisted the air of more clairvoyants and had them concentrate solely on making contact with extraterrestrials."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"This committee had lost touch with the captured Aliens six months after the original discovery of them. At the time, the scientists did not care. They had plenty on their hands with the Alien craft and all its cargo. But during the late 1960s and early 1970s, the scientists needed to understand the connection between the two: craft and Aliens. Sure, the Aliens had some fantastic stuff, but why did they have this stuff? The committee was denied access to the Aliens and was not allowed to know their location or if the Aliens in the crash were still alive. So, the scientists had to find their own Aliens. They tried using the clairvoyants in groups of three to see if the psychics could concentrate and direct their power. That failed and the clairvoyants were split up to let each work individually. Of the six, one was predicting with a 64% accuracy on where an Alien sighting would occur. The rest of the psychics missed every time. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, members of the committee crisscrossed the United States, part of Europe and areas in South America. The scientists never made contact, but they had many successful sightings. The committee photographed the Alien ships and chased them with fighter jets and choppers. If the terrain allowed and there were no civilians in the vicinity, the committee tried to shoot the Alien craft down. But they never came close to hitting one and none of the scientists thought they ever would. Their intentions were strictly to see if the Aliens would respond, acknowledge the humans in some way by blinking their craft lights or zapping the human aircraft with a ray-beam? Something! \"Humor us\" was the cry of one frustrated committee member. After two disappointing decades of seeing UFOs without making any actual contact, the committee decided to change their approach and focus on \"what?\" or \"who?\" the Aliens were visiting on Earth. The committee members read the papers and the tabloids, so they were aware of all the stories of Alien abductions. The scientists even interviewed some of the more prominent abductees, but came away with no answers. Even though the committee was part of a secret government agency with virtually unlimited resources, not to mention high level contacts, they had the same difficulty as everyone else when they tried to get classified information about other projects or other committees who might have more knowledge about UFOs. The committee knew there had to be at least one other secret committee, but the consensus among them was that there were four: one for each of the four departments of the military. This committee was financed through the department of the U. S. Air Force. Everyone who has worked in government knows there can be no favoritism of one branch of government over another by the Congress of the United States. That's doubly true for the Pentagon. If one department of the military has a secret government committee, then all of them will have one or two or maybe dozens. Are Aliens abducting humans? The committee did not want to get involved with those who claimed to have been abducted by Aliens. The scientists were hoping that if there were another department involved that their information could be shared with their committee. Because the committee was not able to breach those hidden barriers, the scientists had to do their own investigations. They avoided anyone who claimed to have had a UFO encounter, even though the scientists knew that some were telling the truth. The committee knew that the information they obtained from researching the Alien things was due more to the generosity of the Aliens themselves than it was from anything that the committee scientists were doing. Still, there were no freebies. The committee had to go the extra distance and then some for every morsel of information they were allowed to acquire. Detecting UFOs was much easier than finding out what the Aliens were up to. Locating a UFO was just a matter of coordinating their best psychic with their ground and air teams. Once the psychic pinpointed an area where he felt a UFO might be, the ground team scoured that location. When the scientists detected the UFO, they sent a specially equipped airplane that carried a multitude of radar and other sophisticated tracking devices to that site. After the Alien craft was located and locked onto, the scientists kept their distance"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"and observed the craft with their tracking devices. The U.S. Air Force surveillance plane kept an eye on the Alien craft from a distance of several miles and transmitted pertinent information to the ground vehicle. The USAF never used more than two ordinary cars, which remained incognito throughout the surveillance. The USAF and committee knew they were not fooling the Aliens. The government entities were more concerned with tipping off ordinary citizens - and particularly UFO buffs who regularly showed up at many of the same places that the committee did.
